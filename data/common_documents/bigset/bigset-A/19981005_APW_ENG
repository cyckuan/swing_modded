 &UR; Bills 26, 49ers 21 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ORCHARD PARK, New York (AP) _ Rob Johnson threw for 254 yards
and a touchdown, and Buffalo shut down San Francisco's high-powered
offense for most of the game before surviving a late rally and
beating the 49ers 26-21 Sunday.
	   The Bills, who won only one of their previous 10 games, built a
23-0 lead in the third quarter before the 49ers staged a comeback
and pulled within 26-21 on Steve Young's 21-yard TD pass to J.J.
Stokes with 1:03 left.
	   San Francisco (3-1) then recovered an onside kick, but the play
was wiped out by an offsides penalty against the 49ers, their
NFL-record 22nd penalty of the game. Buffalo (1-3) recovered the
second onside attempt to clinch the victory.
 &UR; Bears 31, Lions 27 &QC; 
	   In Chicago, Erik Kramer threw two TD passes and ran for a score
as the Chicago Bears rallied for their first win of the season.
	   The Bears (1-4), who trailed 27-10 going into the fourth
quarter, held Barry Sanders to 28 yards on 14 carries, one of the
worst games of his career.
	   Kramer was 26-of-37 for 275 yards, while Chris Penn caught six
passes for a career-high 106 yards. Lions rookie Charlie Batch was
16-of-31 for 268 yards and two TDs, and Johnnie Morton caught two
passes for 138 yards, including a 98-yard TD catch.
 &UR; Falcons 51, Panthers 23 &QC; 
	   In Atlanta, Tim Dwight returned the opening kickoff 93 yards for
a touchdown and the Atlanta Falcons scored their most points in 25
years by routing the winless Carolina Panthers.
	   Atlanta (3-1) scored three touchdowns in a 48-second span of the
third quarter. Carolina (0-4) fumbled on its first three
possessions of the second half and finished with six turnovers.
	   Dwight set the tone when he took John Kasay's opening kickoff at
the 7, cut through a gaping hole on the left side and cruised all
the way to the end zone.
 &UR; Colts 17, Chargers 12 &QC; 
	   In Indianapolis, it was billed as the rookie showdown between
Peyton Manning and Ryan Leaf, but Elijah Alexander and Ken Dilger
stole the show and led Indianapolis to its first win of the season.
	   Alexander intercepted a pass by Leaf to set up one touchdown and
recovered a fumble to set up another. Dilger ran in a 2-point
conversion on a well-executed fake after the TD and recovered an
onside kick after the Chargers had pulled within two points with
1:48 left.
	   That led to Mike Vanderjagt's third field goal, a 40-yarder that
clinched the game for the Colts (1-4). Manning was 12-of-23 for 137
yards with an interception, while Leaf was 12-of-23 for 150 yards
with an interception for the Chargers (2-3).
 &UR; Jets 20, Dolphins 9 &QC; 
	   In East Rutherford, New Jersey, Curtis Martin rushed for 108
yards and a touchdown as the New York Jets snapped a four-game
losing streak to Miami.
	   Dan Marino had a poor day for the Dolphins (3-1), going 13-of-31
for 121 yards, getting sacked three times and throwing two
interceptions. Miami's running attack also sputtered, gaining just
34 yards.
	   Vinny Testaverde, subbing at quarterback again for injured Glenn
Foley, threw a 10-yard TD pass to Keyshawn Johnson for the Jets
(2-2).
 &UR; Cowboys 31, Redskins 10 &QC; 
	   In Landover, Maryland, Jason Garrett, Emmitt Smith and Chris
Warren had big days as Dallas routed winless Washington.
	   Garrett completed 14 of 17 passes for 169 yards and a touchdown,
while Smith and Warren each ran for 100 yards and combined for
three touchdowns for Dallas (3-2).
	   Smith ran for 120 yards and a touchdown, and Warren rushed for
104 yards and two TDs against the Redskins (0-5), who are off to
their worst start since 1981.
 &UR; Patriots 30, Saints 27 &QC; 
	   In New Orleans, Adam Vinatieri kicked a a 27-yard field goal
with six seconds left as New England handed New Orleans its first
loss of the season.
	   After New Orleans tied it on Doug Brien's 37-yard field goal
with 1:32 remaining, Drew Bledsoe completed four passes to set up
the game-winning field goal for the Patriots (3-1).
	   The Saints (3-1) had tied the game 27-27 after a heady play by
punt returner Andre Hastings. After the Patriots punted, New
England's Tebucky Jones batted the ball out of the end zone to
Larry Whigham, who unsuccessfully tried to down it. Hastings
grabbed the ball and raced 76 yards to the Patriots 26, setting up
O'Brien's field goal six plays later.
 &UR; Broncos 41, Eagles 16 &QC; 
	   In Denver, Bubby Brister, filling in for ailing John Elway,
threw four touchdown passes and Terrell Davis ran for 168 yards and
two scores as Denver routed Philadelphia.
	   The defending Super Bowl champions (5-0) built a 35-2 halftime
lead and 41-2 advantage after three quarters before Charlie Garner
ran for a pair of 3-yard scores in the final period for the winless
Eagles (0-5).
	   Davis, the NFL's leading rusher, had 120 yards and both of his
touchdowns in the first quarter and finished the half with 168
yards. He sat out the second half.
 &UR; Bucs 20, Giants 3 &QC; 
	   In Tampa, Florida, Tampa Bay bounced back from an embarrassing
Monday night loss, playing inspired defense to beat the Giants.
	   Charles Mincy returned an interception 22 yards for a touchdown
on the third play of the game, and Regan Upshaw and Ronde Barber
also picked off passes for Tampa Bay (2-3), which was coming off a
21-point loss to Detroit.
	   The Bucs held New York (2-3) to 135 yards in total offense.
 &UR; Raiders 23, Cardinals 20 &QC; 
	   In Tempe, Arizona, Donald Hollas replaced an injured Jeff George
with 50 seconds left in the first quarter and guided Oakland over
Arizona.
	   Hollas was 12-of-22 for 104 yards and scored on a 1-yard run for
the Raiders (3-2), who were trailing 7-3 when he entered the game.
	   Jake Plummer was 23-of-39 for 208 yards and two touchdowns, but
had three interceptions that cost the Cardinals (2-3) their chance
at winning three straight games for the first time in two years.
 &UR; Chiefs 17, Seahawks 6 &QC; 
	   In Kansas City, Missouri, on a rainy night when violent storms
suspended play for almost an hour, the winning team should have
been the one with Watters.
	   But Rich Gannon, atoning for three lost fumbles, scored on a
4-yard run and connected with Andre Rison on an 80-yard touchdown
as Kansas City beat Seattle 17-6 following a first-half downpour
and a 54-minute delay.
	   As torrential rains pelted the field and lightning flashed
across the nighttime sky, NFL officials halted play at 8:14 CDT,
with 7:10 left in the second quarter and the score knotted 3-all.
	   Only a light rain fell most of the second half, but the muddy
conditions contributed to more sloppy play, including two lost
fumbles by Seattle running back Ricky Watters and five for the
Chiefs (4-1), one short of the 29-year-old team record. There were
nine turnovers in all, including two interceptions by John Friesz,
the backup quarterback for Seattle (3-2).

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ With exit polls and initial
returns pointing to a landslide victory, the election was a breeze
for incumbent President Fernando Henrique Cardoso. But Cardoso's
unprecedented second term could turn stormy.
	   Cardoso has managed to hold the rudder firm long enough to
become the first Brazilian president ever re-elected, even after
Russia's debt default wiped out a good chunk of the stock market's
value and forced interest rates to near 50 percent a month.
	   Now many economists predict a recession in 1999, worsening
unemployment and pressure on the government to raise taxes, all of
which is likely to erode the president's popularity.
	   According to exit polls conducted by the respected Ibope polling
institute, Cardoso should win with 56 percent of the vote compared
to 29 percent for his closest rival, Worker's Party candidate Luis
Inacio ``Lula'' da Silva. Ibope questioned 54,000 voters
nationwide.
	   Official election results with 45.55 percent of the vote
counted, Cardoso has 50.24 percent of the vote and Lula 35 percent.

Malaysia's Anwar arrives in court with neck brace, trial set
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The trial of Malaysia's fired
deputy prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, will begin Nov. 2, but break
during an 18-nation summit of Asia-Pacific leaders, a judge ruled
Monday.
	   Anwar, who says police beat him in custody, wore a neck brace
during his arraignment in High Court as policemen surrounded him to
block any conversation with his lawyers or family.
	   ``I've been treated worse than any other criminal,'' Anwar told
the court.
	   High Court Judge Augustine Paul issued a gag order against all
public statements about Anwar's guilt or innocence and said the
trial would be conducted in English ``so that justice can be seen
to be done.''
	   The judge also ordered police to give Anwar's attorneys access
to him so that they could prepare for trial, which was set to begin
Nov. 2 with corruption charges before breaking on Nov. 14.
	   The case would then resume on Nov. 23 until it is completed.
	   Paul did not mention the reason for the break in the trial. The
Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation group of nations gathers in
Malaysia Nov. 12-18 for a summit of leaders including U.S.
President Bill Clinton.
	   ``The judge isn't only me but millions of others,'' said Paul,
noting the international press attention that has brought
expressions of concern from the presidents of the Philippines and
Indonesia, as well as the U.S. State Department, the World Bank and
the United Nations.
	   Once heir apparent to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, Anwar's
popularity increased along with his challenges of Mahathir's
17-year-rule and disagreements over economic policy. He fell out of
favor and was fired Sept. 2 as finance minister and deputy prime
minister.
	   After he conducted two weeks of rallies calling for Mahathir's
resignation and reform of the government, Anwar was arrested under
the Internal Security Act, which allows indefinite detention
without charge and restricts other rights.
	   Since his arrest Sept. 20, Anwar had been kept from seeing his
family or lawyers except during two arraignments last week in lower
court on five charges of corruption and five of illegal homosexual
acts.
	   Anwar pleaded innocent to the charges when he appeared with a
black eye, bruised neck and arms, saying police had beat him until
he was unconscious on the night he was arrested.
	   ``There should be no obstacles made in communicating with the
accused,'' Paul ordered, saying that all eight of his attorneys
should have access to him, three at a time, at reasonable hours.
	   However, when attorneys asked that no policeman be present
during their discussions with Anwar, the judge said that had to be
decided based on circumstances.
	   The prosecution also asked the judge to keep secret a report by
four government doctors who examined Anwar during a weekend
hospital stay until police complete their investigation of how
Anwar was injured.
	   Anwar has been held incommunicado and his wife has been banned
by police from addressing the public.
	   ``It isn't appropriate for anyone to comment on the guilt or
innocence of Anwar either directly or indirectly,'' Paul said. ``To
ensure a fair trial, from today onwards such statements should
cease to be made.''
	   In a clear reference to Mahathir, who described in detail the
sexual allegations against Anwar at a news conference and said he
is sure to be convicted, Anwar's chief lawyer, Raja Aziz Addruse
asked the judge to act.
	   ``A number of persons of high office have seen fit to express
publicly and in no uncertain terms their views that my client is
already guilty of the offenses,'' Raja Aziz said. ``Because of the
authoritative position these persons hold or have held, their views
are bound to influence the trial of the accused and to adversely
affect him.''
	   Mahathir and Anwar had clashed over economic policy as Malaysia
sank into recession. Mahathir also accused Anwar of plotting within
the ruling party to supplant him.
	   Police have banned all gatherings connected with Anwar's reform
movement. And they forced two peaceful protests to disperse Sunday.

One Nation senator denies she'll stand aside for Pauline Hanson

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ The only right-wing populist One
Nation party candidate to win election to Parliament on Monday
rejected rumors she will give her Senate seat to party leader
Pauline Hanson.
	   Suggestions she should hand her Queensland Senate seat to Hanson
are ``nonsense,'' Heather Hill said.
	   ``Pauline's never asked for anybody to ever do that. She's been
very clear ... if she didn't win her seat of Blair she would remain
as One Nation president,'' Hill said.
	   Hanson, who lost the new House of Representatives seat from the
Blair electoral district to the Liberals, has so far refused to
talk to the media.
	   Party adviser David Oldfield said suggestions Hill step aside to
allow Hanson to take up the Senate seat had merit, but doubted it
would happen.
	   ``I don't think Pauline would ask her and I'm sure that Heather
wouldn't be enthusiastic about it anyway,'' Oldfield said.
	   One Nation, which wants to cut off Asian immigration and abolish
Aboriginal welfare benefits, should be proud of its performance at
Saturday's election and will return even stronger at the next
polls, Hill said.
	   ``We managed to snare approximately 8 percent of the vote right
across Australia and you would think One Nation should be sitting
back and feeling very proud of itself,'' she said.
	   ``For our first time off the block, we really haven't done too
badly.
	   ``After a very short period of time _ it's only 18 months _ more
than a million people voted for One Nation and it's unfortunate
that we weren't able to secure seats in the lower house,'' she told
Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio.
	   Before the election, Hanson predicted she would win in Blair and
that One Nation would win six Senate seats and up to 15 in the
House of Representatives.
	   Hanson's former adviser John Pasquarelli said she could not
remain One Nation leader if she failed to gain a parliamentary
seat.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The head of the International Monetary Fund
said he was troubled by the arrest and apparent beating of a former
Malaysian deputy prime minister who played a leading role at annual
meetings of the IMF and its sister institution, the World Bank.
	   Michel Camdessus said Sunday that other members of the 24-nation
Development Committee also had expressed their concern to him about
the treatment of the Malaysian official Anwar Ibrahim, who had
headed the committee.
	   Anwar appeared in court last week with a black eye and bruises
and told the judge he had been beaten by police after his arrest on
charges of corruption and illegal homosexual acts. He has pleaded
innocent to the charges.
	   On Monday, Anwar arrived in a higher court for his arraignment
wearing a neck brace after a weekend checkup in a hospital. His
trial was scheduled to begin Nov. 2.
	   Anwar was once the heir apparent to Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad. But as Anwar's popularity increased along with his
challenges of Mahathir's 17-year-rule, he fell out of favor and was
ousted as deputy prime minister on Sept. 2.
	   ``I hope that the Malaysian authorities can reassure us as to
his condition when the committee meets'' on Monday, Camdessus said.
	   He described Anwar, 51, as a friend and said he demonstrated
''remarkable leadership qualities'' as head of the Development
Committee which represents the world's poorer nations.
	   ``He was a very good minister of finance'' for Malaysia and
helped his country resist Asia's financial crisis, Camdessus said.
``I was troubled by what we learned, and many members of the
committee said they were troubled.''
	   Last week James Wolfensohn, president of the World Bank, the
IMF's sister institution, also said he was ``deeply concerned, as

	   ``A lot of us are feeling saddened by that situation, and we're
certainly going to monitor it and help in whatever way we can,''
Wolfensohn said. ``I hope he gets a fair chance to state his
case.''
	   Similar statements concerning Anwar were made by U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan and U.S. State Department spokesman James Foley.
	   Thailand's finance minister, Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda, has
replaced Anwar as head of the IMF committee.

Philippine inflation dips to 10 percent in September
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Consumer prices in the Philippines
rose 10 percent in September from a year earlier, down from 10.5
percent the previous month, the government said Monday.
	   The inflation data was lower than expected, with economists
having forecast consumer prices in September rising 10.4 percent.
	   Inflation slowed for most commodity groups, including food,
clothing and housing. Prices of fuel and water, however, rose
faster.
	   Inflation hit double digits in May for the first time in nearly
two years, when it reached 10.3 percent.
	   Economists no longer expect average inflation to breach the 10
percent mark this year as the impact of a drought attributed to the
El Nino weather phenomenon on agricultural production is declining.
	   However, the impact of expected heavy rains later this year has
yet to be measured.
	   Agricultural production is crucial in determining Philippine
inflation as food makes up around half of the consumer price index.

Franchitti wins wild, rain-marred race
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Motorsports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HOUSTON (AP) _ It was hard to tell whether Dario Franchitti was
happier with his win in Sunday's inaugural Texaco Grand Prix or by
the fact that he survived the chaotic event.
	   Franchitti won his third race of the season as rain played
havoc, delaying the start, cutting the event 30 laps short and
causing moments of chaos in between.
	   The race, scheduled for 100 laps on the 1.527-mile
(2.46-kilometer), 10-turn temporary street course in downtown
Houston, was flagged to a halt after 70 laps as rain poured down,
standing water began to form on the track and lightning and thunder
prodded many of the 62,455 spectators toward the exits.
	   Franchitti, whose first CART FedEx Series victories came
consecutively earlier this season in Elkhart Lake, Wisconsin, and
Vancouver, British Columbia, started on the front row of the 28-car
field, next to pole-winner Greg Moore. The 25-year-old Scot wound
up leading every lap.
	   He beat Moore to the first turn to take the lead, then pulled
away after the Canadian driver was sidelined by a spin on the
fourth lap.
	   ``This was like Scotland today, with all the rain. The biggest
problem at the beginning was the course was like an ice rink,''
Franchitti said. ``Then, when we went to drys (slick tires), some
places had grip and some places didn't. Then the rain came and it
all changed again.
	   ``But, in wet and dry conditions, we were fast, and that was
great.''
	   The race began 35 minutes late after standing water from earlier
downpours was pushed and blown off the track. With the track still
very wet and slick, the first part of the race was a nightmare,
with three full-course caution flags and a red-flag stoppage in the
first 13 laps.
	   Before the first lap was over, Gil de Ferran spun, knocking
Bryan Herta into the wall at the same time that rookie Elio
Castro-Neves was bumping Al Unser Jr. and sending him spinning.
	   Moore spun and hit Christian Fittipaldi, knocking him into the
wall and both of them out of the race almost immediately after the
green flag waved again for the fourth lap.
	   On lap 13, Robby Gordon hit the rear of the car driven by Michel
Jordain Jr. Those two blocked a tight part of the track near the
pit entrance and, before the incident was over, seven cars were
blocking the roadway. CART officials stopped the race for 15
minutes, clearing the track and allowing the teams to make repairs
and adjustments to the cars.
	   After that, the green flag stayed out most of the way, with the
track continuing to dry out until rain began falling heavily again,
accompanied by the thunder and lightning, minutes before the early
end came.

Indonesian president attacks radical revolutionary groups
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's beleaguered president
Monday called on the nation's powerful military to safeguard his
economic and political reform program against ``radical
revolutionaries.''
	   In a speech marking the 53rd anniversary of the founding of the
military, President B.J. Habibie raised the specter of national
disintegration.
	   Habibie took power in May when riots and protests forced
President Suharto to quit after 32 authoritarian years in power.
	   In recent weeks Habibie has himself been targeted by a new wave
of protests by students and others over his inability to stem the
worst effects of a deep economic crisis and the slow pace of
promised political reform.
	   Looting and lawlessness have also erupted sporadically in some
areas hit hard by soaring prices and food shortages.
	   Newspapers on Monday reported that several retired army generals
were backing a plan by student leaders to launch a 40-day protest
campaign to force Habibie to resign.
	   In his speech at a parade of troops at Jakarta's military base,
Habibie did not name the groups he accused of threatening the
Indonesian nation, which is enduring its worst economic crisis in
30 years.
	   ``Some of the radical revolutionary movement leaders have
planned to stage actions to force their wishes on the people in the
capital and in several regions,'' Habibie said.
	   He said his reform efforts must not be ``stained by the actions
of radical revolutionary groups, which contain the potential for
destruction, disintegration and unconstitutionality.''
	   The president said national security had to be maintained to
protect the push for reform.
	   ``Efforts to overcome the economic crisis and steps toward
reform require stability and order,'' he said.
	   Under Suharto, the military was accused of widespread human
rights abuses and atrocities.
	   However, since the old leader's departure from power armed
forces commander Gen. Wiranto has promised to implement sweeping
reforms and to rethink the military's role in society and politics.
	   Newspapers quoted Wiranto on Monday as saying he did not want
his troops to be regarded by Indonesians only as ``cruel murderers
and destroyers.''
	   Habibie urged the military to upgrade its professionalism. He
also backed a plan to separate the police force from the command of
the military.

Irish head of state thanks Canadians for help in struggle for
</HEADLINE>
peace &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   OTTAWA (AP) _ Irish President Mary McAleese says she plans to
thank as many Canadians as possible for supporting efforts to end
the conflict in Northern Ireland.
	   ``I will be expressing on my visit the profound thanks of all
the Irish people of Canada's steadfast support and direct
assistance in the Northern Ireland peace process,'' McAleese said
in speech Sunday after being officially welcomed by Gov. Gen. Romeo
LeBlanc at his residence, Rideau Hall.
	   Warring factions in British-ruled Northern Ireland agreed to a
peace pact in April. Despite isolated incidents of terrorism and
bloodshed, the peace appears generally to be holding.
	   Ireland has turned the page, McAleese said.
	   ``I hope to be telling the Canadian people, including Irish
Canadians, about the modern European country which Ireland has
developed into in recent years: Very outward looking; very much
more prosperous economically; enjoying a huge cultural renaissance.
And now, at last, putting behind it a troubled history of
conflict.''
	   LeBlanc said Canadians admire the people of Ireland and the
United Kingdom for their success in pursuing a peace agreement. He
told the president he was honored to have her in Canada.
	   ``Your country of modest size occupies a large place in the
world and we rejoice to receive you among us,'' he said in French.
	   The Irish flag lined the streets leading from downtown Ottawa to
Rideau Hall. Mounties escorted McAleese and her husband Martin in a
horse-drawn carriage to the steps of Rideau Hall to meet LeBlanc,
his wife Dianne Fowler, Government House Leader Don Boudria and his
wife Maryann.
	   The Irish president inspected the Defense Department's honor
guard of 100. Somewhere beyond the grounds, cannon blasts rang out
21 times.
	   McAleese seemed touched by the reception.
	   ``I suppose it says something about the relationship between our
two countries that the first person I should meet in the guard of
honor should be a man from Belfast greeting a woman from Belfast,''
McAleese said. ``To have gone to that level of organziation says
something about the special care that the Canadians and the Irish
have for each other.''
	   The president's visit began Friday in Prince Edward Island. She
was scheduled to meet with Prime Minister Jean Chretien Monday and
to attend a state dinner at Rideau Hall. She also plans to visit
Toronto; Montreal; Sydney and Halifax, Nova Scotia; Saint John, New
Brunswick, and Quebec City before ending her visit in St. John's,
Newfoundland, on Oct. 13.
	   ``Canada has provided a haven and home for generations of Irish
people over many centuries, among them my own family,'' she said.
``I look forward to seeing how they have become loyal, proud
Canadians while at the same time keeping a hold on their Irish
heritage.''

Plunky plungee practices world record bungy jump in secret

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ A world record bungy-jump attempt
goes ahead Monday evening, with the plunky plungee diving from the
Sky Tower casino, the city's highest building, 630 feet (192
meters) toward the street.
	   The jump is actually a formality for the media _ because A.J.
Hackett, who is credited with popularizing the ``extreme sport''
pastime of diving from heights with elastic bands tied to the
ankles, has already done it.
	   In fact, Hackett has done two Sky Tower leaps _ during an early
morning Saturday practice session.
	   Monday night's leap is being described as historic, but a
handful of spectators watched the practice jumps about 6 a.m.
Saturday.
	   In constant rain, and with clouds at times lower than the launch
platform, Hackett made two perfect jumps from 630 feet (192 meters)
above the street. He started bouncing when he was about 200 feet
(60 meters) from the ground.
	   Television New Zealand is dedicating 30 minutes of prime-time
television to the jump and a website has been set up to broadcast
it live on the Internet.
	   Promoter Neil Green said there was no intention to fool people
about Monday night's jump, which would still be a world record _ as
Hackett would be going closer to the ground than in practice.
	   ``Obviously we didn't want to spoil it _ and the whole idea of
it was to create that sense of excitement.''
	   Green said there was no pretense Monday's jump was the first as
there was no way Hackett would attempt it without doing one or two
jumps first.
	   ``There's just too much danger in this one not to get it
right.''
	   Bungy jumping is a modernization of a traditional Vanuatu tribal
test of courage in which villagers plunge head-first from high
platforms with vines tied to their ankles to break their fall at
the last moment _ they hope.

Burglars steal Buddha images in Bangkok
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A band of burglars broke into a Bangkok
shop and stole six Buddha images and other religious artifacts
worth 300,000 baht (dlrs 7,500), police said on Monday.
	   Police said it appeared the burglars entered the building which
houses the shop on Friday and hid somewhere inside after closing
time. Police were alerted to the theft Saturday, said an officer,
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Crime is rising in Thailand as a severe economic crisis has left
many people unemployed. Buddha images and amulets can command high
prices from collectors and those who believe they have the power to
protect against ailments, bad luck and evil.
	   The core of the teachings of Buddha, the founder of one of the
world's great religions, was to shun material possessions and
attachment and avoid greed, anger and foolishness.

Philippine banks' bad loan ratio rises to 9.64 percent in July
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The bad loan ratio of Philippine
commercial banks rose to 9.64 percent in July from 8.94 percent a
month earlier, according to the Philippines' central bank.
	   In a weekend announcement, the bank also said, however, that the
bad-loan ratio for the country's 54 commercial banks remained at
manageable levels despite the impact of Asia's financial crisis on
corporate borrowers.
	   It also said the ratio was far better than in other countries in
the region grappling with the Asian downturn.
	   In Indonesia the ratio of non-performing loans is 50 percent,
and in South Korea 32 percent, the central bank said.
	   Corporate borrowers have been hard hit by soaring interest rates
since the Asian currency crisis erupted in July 1997 with the
devaluation of the Thai baht.
	   The central bank did not provide data for the non-performing
loan ratio of the entire Philippine banking system, which would
likely be higher than for commercial banks alone.
	   Meanwhile, the capital adequacy ratio of commercial banks rose
to 17.4 percent in July from the previous month's 16.9 percent.
Commercial banks are required to have a minimum capital adequacy
ratio of 10 percent.
	   The improvement in the capital position was attributed to
requirements set by the monetary authority for banks to steadily
increase their capital base.
	   The increase in capital adequacy gives banks more buffer to
cover potential credit risks.
	   So far, there have been no large bankruptcies in the Philippines
caused by companies unable to service their debt, although a number
of small and medium-size companies have gone under.
	   Before the currency crisis broke, the ratio of banks'
non-performing loans was around 5 percent.

Lucas Matlala, Kari McKay win Portland Marathon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PORTLAND, Oregon (AP) _ Lucas Matlala of South Africa, making
his first trip to the United States, won the 27th annual Portland
Marathon on Sunday in 2 hours, 26 minutes, 12 seconds.
	   He failed, however, to break his personal best of 2:16:01.
	   ``My pace was a little slow because I was trying to make up for
the climate change,'' Matlala said. ``And I'm just a newcomer
here.''
	   He almost didn't make it to the race.
	   Matlala had signed up for the Portland Marathon thinking it was
in Maine. Only after arriving in New York, when he discovered his
ticket price was more than double what he had expected, did he
realize his mistake.
	   ``But he just picked up and came out here anyway,'' race
director Les Smith said with a laugh. ``And then he wins it.''
	   The 26.2-mile course was just a warm-up for Matlala, who lives
in Johannesburg. The 30-year-old normally competes in 50-mile-plus
(80-kilometer-plus) ultramarathons, including the prestigious
Comrades Marathon in Pietermaritzburg, South Africa.
	   Eoin Fahy of San Diego was second in 2:28:50, with Jeff Terry of
Birmingham, Ala., third in 2:29:52.
	   In the women's division, Kari McKay of Spokane, Wash., running
her first marathon, won in 2:45:55.
	   The race ``was just something to see if this is what I want to
do,'' said McKay, 29, whose time qualified her for the U.S. Olympic
women's marathon trials. ``Now I have a lot of work to do.''
	   Chris Clark of Anchorage , Alaska, was second in 2:47:14 and
Joan McGrath of New Westminster, British Columbia, third in
2:51:14.
	   Of the 4,600 registered runners in the race, Smith said 33
percent were running their first marathon.

Report: Indonesian students hang selves by neck, torso in protest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A group of students has resorted to
hanging themselves with rope until they pass out to protest against
Indonesia's government, The Jakarta Post reported Monday.
	   The Post said 14 students had taken part in the bizarre
demonstration of dissent at St. Thomas Catholic University in
Medan, Indonesia's third largest city.
	   The paper said the students had draped thick ropes from the
third floor of the college's building and had hanged themselves by
the neck and torso.
	   Other students lowered them to safety only after they lost
consciousness.
	   It said they first performed the dangerous protest last
Thursday, when 11 students had to be treated in a nearby hospital.
	   One student leader Fransiskus Stars Sitanggang, who hanged
himself then, said he had been plagued by headaches since.
	   He said he and other students understood they could die if the
rope became too tight or broke.
	   Sitanggang said he was also willing to set himself on fire
unless the government did not lower soaring food prices and meet
other demands.
	   The students also want President B.J. Habibie to resign.

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ With exit polls and initial
returns pointing to a landslide victory, the election was a breeze
for incumbent President Fernando Henrique Cardoso. But Cardoso's
unprecedented second term could turn stormy.
	   Cardoso has managed to hold the rudder firm long enough to
become the first Brazilian president ever re-elected, even after
Russia's debt default wiped out a good chunk of the stock market's
value and forced interest rates to near 50 percent a month.
	   Now many economists predict a recession in 1999, worsening
unemployment and pressure on the government to raise taxes, all of
which is likely to erode the president's popularity.
	   According to exit polls conducted by the respected Ibope polling
institute, Cardoso should win with 56 percent of the vote compared
to 29 percent for his closest rival, Worker's Party candidate Luis
Inacio ``Lula'' da Silva. Ibope questioned 54,000 voters
nationwide.
	   Official election results with 48.18 percent of the vote,

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Dozens of police and troops Monday
blocked a street march by about 300 students who demanded an end to
the Indonesian military's role in politics.
	   The protesters carried banners and placards and got within 200
meters (yards) of the national Parliament building before being
stopped by four lines of security personnel under an overpass,
resulting in a major traffic jam.
	   A second group of 150 protesters got past a police cordon and
gathered outside the gates of the legislature.
	   Riots police with sticks and shields stood watch. There were no
reports of injuries or arrests.
	   Monday's protest coincided with celebrations marking the 53rd
anniversary of the founding of Indonesia's military.
	   The demonstration was against a so-called ``dual function''
policy that gives the military two roles: to act as legislators and
to guard Indonesia's national security.
	   Under the policy, the military has 75 seats allocated to it in
the 500-member national Parliament.
	   ``When the army plays politics only the officers benefit,'' said
one protest organizer, Ahmad Busaidin.
	   Under former autocratic President Suharto, the military was
accused of widespread human rights abuses.
	   Since Suharto quit amid riots and protests in May, senior
commanders have promised to improve the professionalism of
soldiers.
	   They have said, however, that the dual function policy will be
maintained.

	   RAWALPINDI, Pakistan (AP) _ Australia took only 13 minutes to
record its historic innings and 99-run win over Pakistan on Monday,
the fifth day of the first cricket Test against Pakistan.
	   Glen McGrath trapped Saqlain Mushtaq leg before in the fourth
over of the day as Pakistan was bowled out for 145 in its second
innings after resuming at the overnight total of 137 for nine.
	   Salim Malik remained unbeaten on 52.
	   It has been 39 years since Australia won a Test in Pakistan.
	   Steve Waugh for his 157-run effort in the Australian first
innings total of 513 was given man of the match honors. Pakistan
made 269 in its first innings.
	   It was only the third time in Pakistan's Test history that it
was beaten by an innings margin at home. West Indies had done it on
two previous occasions -- in 1958-59 and 1986-87.

Indonesia studying ways to improve capital flow monitoring
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's senior economics minister
is studying ways to improve the monitoring of capital flows, a
report said Monday.
	   Economy, Finance and Industry Coordinating Minister Ginandjar
said in the Bisnis Indonesia daily that the government is
evaluating the need for a reporting system, but stressed that it
will retain its foreign exchange regime.
	   ``(The government) has started to think about what is the right
mechanism for monitoring the flow of capital,'' Ginandjar said,
without giving further details.
	   In recent months, several business executives have called on the
government to require exporters to repatriate their foreign
exchange earnings as a means of boosting the rupiah.
	   The government has repeatedly said it would examine this
possibility, but has shown no intention of implementing it.
	   Last month, neighboring Malaysia imposed foreign exchange
controls in an attempt to reduce its exposure to what it called
excessive speculation in the global currency market that it said
was damaging its economy.

Most Asian markets open lower despite proposals to jump-start world
</HEADLINE>
economy
 &UR; By PRISCILLA CHEUNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets opened lower Monday,
uninspired by Wall Street's rally Friday and signs over the weekend
that the Group of Seven industrial countries were moving more
aggressively to jump-start the world economy.
	   In morning trading, Japanese stocks plunged through the
psychologically important 13,000 mark, and Hong Kong stocks dropped
3.6 percent after a four-day trading break. Singapore was slightly
lower at midday.
	   In Japan, the benchmark Nikkei Stock Average shed 247.27 points,
or 1.87 percent, to close the morning session at 12,976.42. On
Friday, the Nikkei gained 26.57-points, or 0.20 percent.
	   At a meeting in Washington, the Group of Seven urged Japan to
take ``swift and effective action'' to strengthen its financial
system, including the prompt enactment of measures to support
viable banks with public assistance.
	   The United States also proposed at the weekend that the
International Monetary Fund set up an emergency lending fund, while
Japan unveiled a plan to spend U.S. dlrs 30 billion to assist five
crisis-hit Asian nations over the next two years.
	   But dealers said they were skeptical if the proposals would lead
to a turnaround in the region's economic woes. Traders warned
Asia's outlook would remain uncertain until Japan's ruling and
opposition parties agree on how to strengthen its ailing financial
system.
	   ``Tokyo stocks are still looking downward, and the market hasn't
confirmed a downside support,'' said Masaaki Higashida, deputy
general manager at Nomura Securities Co.
	   Last week, the Nikkei index repeatedly set new 12-year closing
lows, and on Friday briefly touched a low of 12,973.24, the first
time the average broke below 13,000 points since January 1986.
	   In Hong Kong, investors dumped shares after the long break,
following steep falls in global markets late last week. The
blue-chip Hang Seng Index was at 7,605.07 points at midday.
	   Analysts also said investors were staying on the sidelines ahead
of Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa's policy address Wednesday, which
may give clues as to whether the government will roll out more
measures to stimulate the shrinking economy.
	   In the Philippines, worries over an uptrend in interest rates
overshadowed an improvement in September's inflation figures. The
PSE index closed 2.4 percent lower at 1,166.54.
	   In Singapore, the Straits Times Index was down 7.89 points to
892.10. Bourses in Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand all opened
slightly down.
	   Financial markets in Taiwan and South Korea were closed Monday
for public holidays.
	   On the currency market, the dollar weakened against the Japanese
yen as overseas players dumped the U.S. currency. The dollar's
failure to break above a technical barrier at around 135.50 yen
triggered a wave of selling, dealers said.
	   The dollar bought 134.55 yen at midmorning, down 0.22 yen from
late Friday in Tokyo and below its level late Friday in New York of
135.65 yen.

Cambodian king arrives as talks to form government resume
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ King Norodom Sihanouk arrived in
Phnom Penh on Monday in a trip analysts believe is intended to push
Cambodia's bickering political parties into forming a new
government.
	   Traveling from his residence in the northwestern town of Siem
Reap, Sihanouk was greeted by representatives of Cambodian leader
Hun Sen's ruling party and the two-party opposition in a low-key
arrival at the capital's international airport.
	   Negotiations between Hun Sen and his rivals were scheduled to
resume later Monday.
	   The king waved to journalists and shouted hello as his limousine
left the airport for the Royal Palace, but did not otherwise speak
to the press.
	   The 75-year-old monarch had originally planned to fly to Beijing
on Monday for medical treatment, but changed his plans at the
request of Hun Sen.
	   Because both the government and parliament are in transition as
post-election talks between Cambodia's bitterly divided factions
continue, the king's absence would have left the country without
the one unifying figure respected by all factions.
	   Diplomats in Phnom Penh, who were asked by the king not to
attend his arrival, have said Sihanouk's trip to the capital is
probably intended to spur the three parties to hasten the pace of
the negotiations.
	   Hun Sen's ruling Cambodian People's Party, winner of the July 26
national election, is eager to form a coalition government. The
opposition, however, insists that its allegations of fraud during
the polls must be thoroughly investigated first.
	   The ruling party narrowly won a majority in the election,
claiming 64 of the 122 seats in parliament, but not the two-thirds
needed to form a government alone.
	   Sihanouk's mediating efforts helped bring the three parties to
the bargaining table last month after street clashes broke out in
Phnom Penh over the results of the election.
	   The king hosted two rounds of negotiations at his Siem Reap
residence that led to the ceremonial convening of parliament on
Sept. 24, but he was not expected to take part in Monday's talks.
	   Sihanouk suffers from a variety of illnesses and regularly
travels to Beijing to receive medical treatment from his Chinese
doctors. He was diagnosed with colon cancer in 1993, but it has
since gone into remission.

Financial secretary: Asian rescue package bonds could float in Hong
</HEADLINE>
Kong &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong would welcome the issuance of bonds
in the territory as part of Japan's U.S. dlrs 30 billion economic
rescue package for Asia, Hong Kong's top financial official said
late Sunday.
	   Japan's regional rescue package would allow countries under
distress to issue bonds using guarantees from the Export-Import
Bank of Japan or multilateral agencies.
	   Financial Secretary Donald Tsang told reporters in Washington,
where he met Sunday night with Japanese Vice Minister for Finance
Eisuke Sakakibara, that Hong Kong hopes some of the highly rated
paper ends up being floated in the territory, provided it's backed
by strong guarantees.
	   ``If that is the case, Hong Kong would welcome such papers to be
floated in Hong Kong if they were denominated in yen, euro or U.S.
dollars,'' Tsang was quoted as saying in a transcript of his media
session, issued by the Hong Kong government Monday.
	   Tsang also said Japan's rescue package may have come later than
some would have liked, but that it's still important and necessary.
	   ``I think better late than never. It is certainly a very timely
initiative in my view,'' he said.
	   His talks with Sakakibara focused on the global situation and
ways to avoid worldwide recession.
	   Tsang, in Washington for the annual International Monetary
Fund/World Bank meeting, also met with China's Minister of Finance
Xiang Huaicheng.
	   The United States and a number of other nations in recent weeks
have put forward major proposals to overhaul the operations of the
IMF, which has been widely criticized for its handling of the Asian
crisis.
	   The IMF's policy committee said Sunday that the global economic
outlook has ``worsened considerably'' and pledged ``concrete and
rapid action'' to deal with the worst global economic crisis in 50
years, but disagreement over how to halt the widening financial
crisis remains.

Dissidents call on Blair to press China on rights, environment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ British Prime Minister Tony Blair should press
Chinese leaders to protect human rights and the environment,
dissidents said in an open letter Monday, the eve of Blair's visit.
	   Before Blair lands in Beijing on Tuesday morning to start his
five-day visit, China was expected to sign the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in New York.
	   The timing suggested Beijing was anxious to smooth the way for
Blair, who is making the first visit by a British prime minister in
seven years.
	   The treaty, a key U.N. document on basic rights, would not come
into force until ratified by China's legislature, which may choose
to attach reservations, effectively nullifying some provisions.
	   In their letter, the three dissidents said that while Chinese
leaders say they respect human rights principles, in law and
practice, the government allows rights abuses and persecution of
dissidents.
	   Thousands of political prisoners are believed to remain in
Chinese prisons, labor camps or detention centers, said the letter,
a copy of which was released by the Hong Kong-based Information
Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China.
	   The letter called for the release of Shi Binhai, a journalist
who compiled a popular book on political change; Fang Jue, a
businessman who called openly for political reform; and other
imprisoned activists.
	   The letter _ signed by Leng Wanbao, Wang Zechen and Xiao Lijun _
complained that visits by Western leaders to China have not
improved human rights and criticized the West for putting business
interests first.
	   The three also said Blair should urge Chinese leaders to enact
strong environmental protection plans.
	   They said the time was ripe because the summer's devastating
floods, made worse by deforestation and erosion, served as a
wake-up call on environmental abuse.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The trial of Malaysia's fired
deputy prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, will begin Nov. 2, but break
during an 18-nation summit of Asia-Pacific leaders, a judge ruled
Monday.
	   Anwar, who says police beat him in custody, wore a neck brace as
he pleaded innocent in High Court to four corruption charges.
Policemen surrounded him to block any conversation with his lawyers
or family.
	   ``I've been treated worse than any other criminal,'' Anwar told
the court.
	   High Court Judge Augustine Paul issued a gag order against all
public statements about Anwar's guilt or innocence and said the
trial would be conducted in English ``so that justice can be seen
to be done.''
	   The judge also ordered police to give Anwar's attorneys access
to him so that they could prepare for trial, to begin Nov. 2 with
four corruption charges related to abuse of power, intimidating
police officers and interfering with an investigation.
	   The trial will break Nov. 14, then resume on Nov. 23, taking up
charges of illegal homosexual acts, Paul said, without mentioning a
reason for the pause.
	   The Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation group of nations gathers
in Malaysia Nov. 12-18 for a summit of leaders including U.S.
President Bill Clinton.
	   ``The judge isn't only me but millions of others,'' said Paul,
noting the international press attention that has brought
expressions of concern from world leaders.
	   Once heir apparent to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, Anwar's
popularity increased along with his challenges of Mahathir's
17-year-rule and disagreements over economic policy. He was fired
Sept. 2 as finance minister and deputy prime minister.
	   After he conducted two weeks of rallies calling for Mahathir's
resignation and government reform, Anwar was arrested under the
Internal Security Act, which allows indefinite detention without
charge.
	   Since his arrest Sept. 20, Anwar had been kept from seeing his
family or lawyers except during two arraignments last week in lower
court. Anwar appeared with a black eye and bruised neck and arms,
saying police had beat him until he was unconscious on the night he
was arrested.
	   Requesting bail so that the 51-year-old Anwar can get treatment
for his injuries and a chronic throat problem, attorney Christopher
Fernando said of the neck brace, ``Doctors don't ask patients to
put that on for nothing.''
	   The judge was still considering the bail request Monday.
	   Anwar's attorneys asked that no policeman be present during
discussions with their client but the judge said that would be
decided based on circumstances.
	   The five plain-clothed policemen who stood behind Anwar in the
courtroom remained in place, although, his attorneys were allowed
to consult with him in lockup, during breaks.
	   While Anwar has been held, and his wife banned from addressing
the public, the government has sent ruling party leaders around the
country to explain why Mahathir fired him.
	   Police have banned all gatherings connected with Anwar's reform
movement. They forced two peaceful protests to disperse Sunday.
	   ``It isn't appropriate for anyone to comment on the guilt or
innocence of Anwar either directly or indirectly,'' Paul said. ``To
ensure a fair trial, from today onwards such statements should
cease to be made.''
	   At a recent news conference, Mahathir described in detail the
sexual allegations against Anwar and said he is sure to be
convicted.
	   In a clear reference to Mahathir, Anwar's chief lawyer, Raja
Aziz Addruse called on the judge to act.
	   ``A number of persons of high office have seen fit to express
publicly and in no uncertain terms their views that my client is
already guilty of the offenses,'' Raja Aziz said. ``Their views are
bound to influence the trial of the accused and to adversely affect
him.''
	   Anwar, clearly thinner than before his arrest, looked at
reporters and tugged at his trousers to indicate his weight loss.
He stood and sat down stiffly in the neck brace.

Fishermen find 29 bodies of passengers of crashed airliner
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; BY NIRESH ELIATAMBY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Fishermen have recovered 29 bodies of
the 55 people who were aboard an airliner that disappeared over the
Indian Ocean north of Sri Lanka last week, officials said Monday.
	   Government officials believe the Lionair passenger aircraft, an
Antonov AN-24, may have strayed too close to a Tamil Tiger
guerrilla base on the coast and may have been mistaken for an Air
Force troop transport plane.
	   Twenty bodies were found Sunday floating off the village of
Poonakary, about 260 kilometers (160 miles) north of Colombo, said
Mariyadas Croos, the government's chief administrator in the
northwestern Mannar district.
	   Six more were found Saturday at Arialai Point, and three others
on Friday off the village of Nachchikudah, all in the same
district.
	   All the bodies were highly decomposed, and were burned or buried
by the fishermen, said Croos in a telephone interview.
	   A Sri Lankan gunboat also spotted three bodies on Thursday, but
could not reach them. It was impossible to say whether they were
among the 29 recovered by fishermen.
	   The guerrillas, who control large parts of the coastline, have
offered no comments on the plane crash.
	   The guerrillas have shot down several military planes with
missiles in recent years, but have not attacked civilian aircraft
since they blew up a state-owned Air Lanka airliner on the ground
at Colombo airport in 1983, killing 14 people.
	   A life jacket with the insignia of the Lionair Antonov AN-24,
and personal belongings of passengers have also been recovered. The
exact site of the crash is not known.
	   The plane disappeared during a 50-minute flight from Jaffna to
Colombo on Tuesday. There was no distress signal from the crew.
	   Those on board the Ukrainian-built plane included four Russian
crew members, three Sri Lankan crew and 48 Sri Lankan passengers.
	   Lionair is one of two private companies providing civilian air
service between Colombo and Jaffna. The normal flight path is over
the sea, just off the coastline that is controlled by rebels.
	   The government Thursday ordered both airlines to suspend
flights.
	   The rebels are fighting for a homeland for minority Tamils, who
claim discrimination from the majority Sinhalese, who dominate the
government and military. More than 55,000 people have been killed
in the war which began in 1983.

China to impose anti-dumping rules on chemical fibers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Flooded by cheap imports due to regional currency
depreciations, China plans to impose regulations against unfair
pricing of chemical fiber products, state media reported Monday.
	   ``Anti-dumping regulations have become unavoidable since
imported products have severely disordered the domestic chemical
fiber market,'' the official newspaper China Daily quoted Xu
Kunyuan, vice director of the State Textile Industry Bureau, as
saying.
	   Continuous price cuts by foreign makers of chemical fiber
spurred China's imports of such products to 1.81 million tons last
year, equivalent to 39 percent of the country's total output, the
report said.
	   China imported 873,000 tons of chemical fibers in the first half
of this year, equal to 37.4 percent of the total domestic output
during the same period, the report said.
	   Sluggish domestic demand, cheap imports and inefficiency within
state-run industries have caused stockpiles in many sectors to
accumulate, leading companies to slash prices to compete.
	   The government has sought to prevent further price cuts, saying
they erode state company profits and tax revenues, hurt the ability
of banks to collect debt and could even threaten national economic
growth.
	   To stop sliding prices, the government has imposed price
controls on building materials, machinery, metallurgical products,
textiles and petrochemical products.
	   The Chinese government has already imposed anti-dumping rules on
flat glass and rod, hot-rolling and threading steel, the China
Daily said.

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The pace of NATO preparations to
strike at Yugoslav targets may rise or fall depending on what the
U.N. secretary general tells the Security Council about the Kosovo
crisis on Monday.
	   U.N. chief Kofi Annan plans to report on whether Belgrade is
complying with demands to halt its assault on ethnic Albanians. If
not, Washington has said NATO will start air strikes within two
weeks.
	   Reacting to the threat of strikes, Russia's defense and foreign
ministers met President Slobodan Milosevic on Sunday, as his
generals prepared to defend the country.
	   Besides Milosevic, Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and
Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, the meeting was also attended by
Milan Milutinovic, president of Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav
republic, and Yugoslavia's top defense officials.
	   Russia is the Serbs' main ally, sharing bonds of religion, and
Slavic roots.
	   In Moscow, Itar-Tass carried a government statement repeating
opposition to NATO intervention in Kosovo without the sanction of
the U.N. Security Council, of which Russia is a veto-wielding
member.
	   A Yugoslav statement afterward said the leadership wanted the
Kosovo dispute solved peacefully. ``but in case we are attacked, we
shall defend our country with all means.''
	   Richard Holbrooke, architect of the Bosnian peace accord, will
travel to Belgrade this week in an effort to convince Milosevic to
comply with U.N. demands to halt Serbia's assault on ethnic
Albanians.

Philippine police arrest sixth suspect in kidnapping of Dutch
</HEADLINE>
businessman

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Authorities have arrested a sixth
suspect in the kidnapping of a Dutch businessman who was freed
after his partners paid 20 million pesos (dlrs 454,500) in ransom,
police said Monday.
	   Criminal investigation chief Lucas Managuelod said police
arrested Jeffrey Espiritu, a 21-year-old high school student, last
Wednesday in his hometown of Calinog in central Iloilo province.
	   Managuelod said five other suspects are still being sought in
the June 3 kidnapping of Gerard Heinen, the 44-year-old owner of
Decordesign Inc., a handicraft-exporting company in Cavite province
south of Manila. Heinen is from Dinxperlo, Netherlands.
	   He was kidnapped by a group of men wearing shirts with the word
``police'' printed on them, a few kilometers (miles) from his
factory in Silang town.
	   Three business partners, including another Dutchman, were with
him when he was abducted. They were not taken so they could seek
his release, and paid the ransom the following day.
	   Heinen was freed a day later. Police then raided the alleged
hideout of his kidnappers in nearby Bacoor and arrested five
suspects, including the alleged mastermind.
	   Kidnapping for ransom is a lucrative criminal activity in the
Manila area and in the southern Philippines. Police and military
personnel are widely believed to be active in kidnapping groups.

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ With exit polls and initial
returns pointing to a landslide victory, the election was a breeze
for incumbent President Fernando Henrique Cardoso. But Cardoso's
unprecedented second term could turn stormy.
	   Cardoso has managed to hold the rudder firm long enough to
become the first Brazilian president ever re-elected, even after
Russia's debt default wiped out a good chunk of the stock market's
value and forced interest rates to near 50 percent a month.
	   Now many economists predict a recession in 1999, worsening
unemployment and pressure on the government to raise taxes, all of
which is likely to erode the president's popularity.
	   According to exit polls conducted by the respected Ibope polling
institute, Cardoso should win with 56 percent of the vote compared
to 29 percent for his closest rival, Worker's Party candidate Luis
Inacio ``Lula'' da Silva. Ibope questioned 54,000 voters
nationwide.
	   Official election results with 49.4 percent of the vote counted
had Cardoso with 50.3 percent and Lula with 35.6 percent. Ciro
Gomes of the moderate-left PPS had 10.6 percent of the vote, Eneas
Carneiro had 2.4 percent and another eight candidates shared less
than two percent of the vote. The remaining votes were either blank
or voided.

Thai government unveils new Cabinet lineup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai announced
a new Cabinet lineup Monday that he hopes will stabilize his shaky
coalition government and strengthen efforts to battle the economic
crisis.
	   Chuan's new Cabinet includes members of the Chart Pattana Party,
formerly the second largest opposition party, which agreed to join
the coalition last week.
	   Chart Pattana's 51 lawmakers gives the seven-party coalition a
commanding 257 to 132 majority in the 389-seat House of
Representatives.
	   That should make it easier for the coalition to push elements of
its economic reform package through parliament, where it has met
stiff resistance from the opposition.
	   Despite the reshuffle, Chuan's new Cabinet still has his top
technocrats Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda as finance minister and Supachai
Panichpakdi as commerce minister.
	   ``I look forward to working with Chart Pattana in the new
government,'' Supachai told reporters on Monday. ``I think they
will make a good partner.''
	   Some analysts have questioned, however, whether Chart Pattana
will ultimately destabilize the government by trying to strengthen
its own political hand, as it was accused of doing to the
government of Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, which fell last
November.
	   Critics said the new lineup was made out of political
expediency.
	   ``This new Cabinet is not for the sake of the people, but to
lengthen the life of the government,'' said Dr. Weng Tojirakarn of
the Confederation for Democracy.
	   ``But if the prime minister cannot root out corruption, then the
government will not last,'' he said.
	   Suchit Boonbongkarn, dean of the faculty of political science at
Bangkok's Chulalongkorn University said, however, that Chart
Pattana probably won't do anything to destabilize the coalition
since that would hurt its image for the next election.
	   No election is scheduled until 2000, but no elected Thai
government has ever completed its four-year term, either collapsing
because of coalition squabbles or being overthrown in military
coups.
	   Chart Pattana gained one ministry deemed crucial to economic
recovery: party Secretary General Suwat Liptapallop was named
minister of industry.
	   Chart Pattana leader Korn Dabbaransi was made a deputy prime
minister while also taking over the ministry of health, which has
been plagued by a corruption scandal.
	   Democrat Secretary General and Minister of Interior Sanan
Kachornprasart _ Chuan's political point man responsible for
forging the coalition together _ was also elevated to a deputy
prime minister.
	   The main threat to the government is the possibility of smaller
parties in the coalition, angry over losing Cabinet seats to
accommodate Chart Pattana, defect to the opposition.
	   Some high-ranking members of smaller parties voiced anger last
week at the prospect of losing coveted posts, but no party has so
far announced intentions to abandon the Chuan government.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Dozens of police and troops Monday
blocked a street march by about 300 students who demanded an end to
the Indonesian military's role in politics.
	   The protesters carried banners and placards and got within 200
meters (yards) of the national Parliament building before being
stopped by four lines of security personnel under an overpass,
resulting in a major traffic jam.
	   A second group of 150 protesters got past a police cordon and
gathered outside the gates of the legislature.
	   Riot police with sticks and shields stood watch. There were no
reports of injuries or arrests.
	   Monday's protest coincided with celebrations marking the 53rd
anniversary of the founding of Indonesia's military.
	   The demonstration was against a so-called ``dual function''
policy that gives the military two roles: to act as legislators and
to guard Indonesia's national security.
	   Under the policy, the military has 75 seats allocated to it in
the 500-member national Parliament.
	   ``When the army plays politics only the officers benefit,'' said
one protest organizer, Ahmad Busaidin.
	   Under former autocratic President Suharto, the military was
accused of widespread human rights abuses.
	   Since Suharto quit amid riots and protests in May, senior
commanders have promised to improve the professionalism of
soldiers.
	   They have said, however, that the dual function policy will be
maintained.
	   In another anti-military protest police and troops stopped about
60 young professional workers from marching from the welcome
monument in the heart of Jakarta's downtown to the nearby military
headquarters.
	   Many of the group had painted their faces or wore Halloween
skull masks to symbolize human rights abuses by troops.

Georgian and Abkhazian troops clash in Ghali district
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Gunmen from Georgia's breakaway Abkhazia republic
waged an hour-long shootout with Georgian Interior Ministry troops,
a news report said Monday.
	   The Abkhazian fighters launched the attack Sunday night from
Abkhazia's restive Ghali district against Georgian troops stationed
on the other side of the Inguri River, the ITAR-Tass news agency
said.
	   The Georgian troops returned fire, and the ensuing shootout
lasted for about an hour, the report said.
	   No Georgian troops were wounded, and Abkhazian casualties were
unknown.
	   Abkhazian separatists drove out Georgian soldiers and ethnic
Georgians in a 1992-93 civil war. Despite the presence of Russian
peacekeepers, skirmishes have been frequent since then.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's senior economics minister
is studying ways to improve the monitoring of capital flows, a
report said Monday.
	   Economy, Finance and Industry Coordinating Minister Ginandjar
Kartasasmita said in the Bisnis Indonesia daily that the government
is evaluating the need for a reporting system, but stressed that it
will retain its foreign exchange regime.
	   ``(The government) has started to think about what is the right
mechanism for monitoring the flow of capital,'' Ginandjar said,
without giving further details.
	   In recent months, several business executives have called on the
government to require exporters to repatriate their foreign
exchange earnings as a means of boosting the rupiah.
	   The government has repeatedly said it would examine this
possibility, but has shown no intention of implementing it.
	   Last month, neighboring Malaysia imposed foreign exchange
controls in an attempt to reduce its exposure to what it called
excessive speculation in the global currency market that it said
was damaging its economy.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A bus crashed into a mountain gorge in the Central
Asian nation of Kyrgyzstan, killing 18 people and wounding three
from neighboring Uzbekistan, a news report said Monday.
	   The bus, carrying a wedding party from Uzbekistan to Kyrgyzstan,
plunged into a ravine as it was crossing a mountain pass late
Saturday night, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Seventeen passengers, six of them children, died at the site of
the crash. Another died after being taken to a hospital, and three
of the 10 survivors were seriously wounded, the report said. All
the passengers were from Uzbekistan.
	   Emergency officials said the road the bus was traveling had been
out of service for a number of years because of its poor condition.
But the driver, also from Uzbekistan, wasn't aware of this.

European fires specialists to investigate fires in Russian Far East
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A United Nation mission flew to Russia's Sakhalin
Island to investigate damage caused by fires that have destroyed
thousands of acres (hectares) of forest in the Far East and are
still raging out of control, a news report said.
	   The U.N. experts, from Britain, Denmark, Germany, Finland and
Russia, will determine how much international aid is needed on the
island, located off Russia's Pacific coast, the ITAR-Tass news
agency said.
	   The fires on Sakhalin are burning out of control over 75,000
acres (30,000 hectares) of forest, though early snows have slowed
their spread, ITAR-Tass said. At least one person so far has been
killed by the blazes, when they engulfed the small Gorky township.
	   Sakhalin leaders have asked for 10 million rubles (dlrs 625,000)
from the Emergency Situations Ministry to battle the blazes, which
have burned for most of the summer. But budget shortfalls in the
federal government make significant help from Moscow unlikely.

Chinese farmers extend land use contracts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ More than 70 percent of China's farmers have
signed fresh 30-year contracts to continue using land owned by the
state, the official newspaper People's Daily reported Monday.
	   The contracts extend those which were signed in the early 1980's
as China began phasing out an unsuccessful experiment with
agricultural collectivization. Most of the old contracts were set
for 15 year periods.
	   The contracts give farmers the right to sell what they grow _
rather than turn over everything to the state to distribute _ and
underpin the government's efforts to make the agricultural sector
more market oriented.
	   In a speech reprinted Monday on the front page of the People's
Daily, the Communist Party's mouthpiece, President Jiang Zemin said
the stability of such ``household responsibility contracts'' was
the ``bedrock'' of the rural reform program.
	   Fostering modernization and the sustainable growth of China's
backward farm sector is the most difficult task the Communist Party
faces and one that is crucial to maintain social and economic
stability, Jiang was quoted as saying.
	   Increases in farmers' incomes have slowed in recent years. To
counter that trend, more small industrial enterprises are needed in
the countryside, Jiang said in the speech, made during a tour of
eastern Anhui province last month.

Economic slowdown hurts women more than men
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ More women than men were laid off as
Taiwan's employment rate fell to a 15-year low because of the
region's economic slowdown, the government said Monday.
	   The overall employment rate fell to 58 percent in the first six
months this year, the lowest since 1983, according to a report by
the Council for Economic Planning and Development.
	   The report found that women had more difficulties finding or
keeping their jobs than did the men. And the sluggish job market
forced women to give up seeking jobs.
	   The employment rate among women dropped 0.45 percentage point
from last year's 45 percent, it said.
	   During the period, women employed by the real estate sector
dropped 10.9 percent, while the number for men increased 1.1
percent.
	   Although Taiwan has largely escaped Asia's economic crisis, it
has begun to feel more of the impact in the last few months.
	   Exports have dropped 7.4 percent in the first eight months this
year, and the unemployment rate climbed to a two-year high of 3
percent in August.
	   According to a separate Economics Ministry report, the number of
new factories dropped 7.16 percent to 3,319 in the first seven
months, while factory shutdowns increased 30 percent to 2,331.
	   The government has pledged to boost the economy by spending 200
billion Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs 5.8 billion) in public projects
in the next two years.
	   The government last forecast a 1998 economic growth rate of 5.5
percent, down from the earlier 6.2 percent.

Hurricane just another plague in a nation accustomed to misery
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos NY110-116 &QL; 
 &UR; By NIKO PRICE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Hurricane Georges killed at least
150 Haitians and wiped out this year's harvest. But for most
Haitians, it was just another bump along a steady descent into
despair.
	   Port-au-Prince, the Haitian capital of 3 million people, was
hardly touched by Hurricane Georges on Sept. 23. But you wouldn't
know that by looking around.
	   Roads covered in sunbaked mud are more potholes than pavement,
and open sewers twist through the streets. Haitians use canoes to
cross canals where bridges have fallen. Electricity doesn't exist
in much of the city, and phone lines fail nearly as often as they
work.
	   Poverty and misery are nothing new to Haitians. What is new is a
sense of resignation after a heralded return to democracy _ that
they have tried every possible remedy, and none has worked.
	   ``Every day I wake up and put water on my face. I look in the
mirror, and I see nothing,'' said Fritzner Midil, 24, a resident of
a squatter camp in the old Fort Dimanche prison, where past
military dictatorships had tortured and killed their opponents.
``The government doesn't see us. We're invisible.''
	   There was a lot of poverty, but also a lot of hope, when U.S.
President Bill Clinton sent 20,000 troops to Haiti on Sept. 19,
1994, to overthrow a bloody military regime and halt a flood of
Haitian boat people to Florida.
	   Political killings stopped, and elected President Jean-Bertrand
Aristide, ousted in a 1991 coup, was restored to office. The
invasion was touted as Clinton's biggest foreign policy success.
	   Thousands of people moved into the old prison or built tin
shacks around it. They named their settlement Cite Demokrasi _
Democracy City. Aristide, the man the people trusted, was free to
govern.
	   Finally, people believed, things would get better.
	   Instead, Aristide and his hand-picked successor, Rene Preval,
proved utterly unable to turn around the economy. Per-capita income
has dropped even further, foreign investment never materialized and
the people stayed hungry.
	   Since 1990, Haiti has fallen from 124th to 159th out of 174
countries in the U.N. Human Development Index, which combines
factors such as life expectancy (57 years), average income (dlrs 20
a month) and education (most of the population is illiterate).
	   Turf wars among Haiti's politicians have blocked the naming of a
prime minister to run the government since June 1997. Haiti hasn't
passed a budget since 1996, and without a budget, hundreds of
millions of foreign aid dollars are on hold.
	   So Haitians' faith in democracy has all but evaporated.
	   In the 1990 election that Aristide won, more than 90 percent of
eligible Haitians voted. In the 1995 election to replace him, 30
percent did. In 1997, only 5 percent bothered to vote in
legislative and municipal elections.
	   Many Haitians wonder whether the country will even hold the next
presidential vote, scheduled for 2000. They're all but certain
that, despite pressure from Washington, Haiti won't hold new
legislative and municipal elections this November.
	   And many don't care.
	   Haitians overwhelmingly speak about their feuding leaders as
corrupt and uncaring. Few can name someone who they think could do
better.
	   ``The hopes of the ordinary man have not been satisfied. Those
hopes are draining away, and the longer the crisis goes on there is
less and less we can do to rekindle them,'' said Colin Granderson,
head of a joint United Nations and Organization of American States
human rights mission.
	   Hope already has drained from the gaunt face of 27-year-old Jean
Francois.
	   His piece of Democracy City is a quarter of an abandoned cell,
partitioned from his neighbors by walls of flattened cardboard
boxes. His worldly possessions: a shirt, a pair of shorts, a sheet
and a small, dirty pillow.
	   He last worked in 1994, and he is sick; neighbors say he has
AIDS. He depends on the charity of friends for an occasional plate
of rice and beans.
	   ``There is nothing left in this country, and there is no way
that will ever change,'' Francois said. ``I have no hope for the
government. And none for the people.''

Russian leaders praise Latvian citizenship referendum
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian leaders praised a Latvian referendum,
approved over the weekend, which will ease naturalization laws for
some 450,000 ethnic Russians living in the former Soviet republic,
news reports said Monday.
	   ``A clear signal was given ... that Latvian people connect the
long-term interests of their country with achievement of
inter-ethnic harmony, integration of society and observance of
human rights,'' said Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir
Rakhmanin, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   ``Latvia can gain international prestige and normalize relations
with Russia only this way,'' he said.
	   The referendum confirmed the Latvian government's earlier
decision to ease its strict naturalization laws, which had placed
high obstacles to the ethnic Russians who wanted to become Latvian
citizens.
	   About 450,000 ethnic Russians, who went to Latvia under a
half-century of Soviet rule, were made non-citizens after the
collapse of the Soviet Union. Many Latvians see the Russians as
unwelcome remnants of a hated regime.
	   The citizenship laws had opened a large rift between Russia and
Latvia, and tempers flared this spring with some Russian stores
refusing to sell Latvian goods and Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov
accusing Lativa of ``genocide.''
	   Russian Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov also praised the
vote.
	   ``It is better to have Russia as a friendly neighbor than to
violate the rights of our compatriots,'' he said on Echo Moscow
radio.

Japanese stocks fall, dollar lower in morning trading

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing stock prices, afternoon dollar and bond
rates

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo stocks fell sharply Monday after a weekend
meeting of finance officials failed to ease worries about the
Japanese economy. The U.S. dollar rose slightly against the yen.
	   The benchmark Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues shed
275.57 points, or 2.08 percent, to close at 12,948.12, below the
psychologically important 13,000 mark.
	   Monday was the first time the average finished below 13,000
since January 1986. On Friday, the Nikkei briefly dropped below
13,000 for the first time in more than 12 years but later recovered
to post a 26.57-point gain, or 0.20 percent.
	   The dollar bought 135.08 yen in afternoon trading, up 0.30 yen
from late Friday in Tokyo but below its level late Friday in New
York of 135.65 yen.
	   At a meeting in Washington, the Group of Seven industrialized
nations urged Japan to take ``swift and effective action'' to
strengthen its financial system, including the prompt enactment of
measures to support viable banks with public assistance.
	   The G-7 consists of the United States, Japan, Britain, Italy,
France, Canada and Germany.
	   Although the statement gave a boost to bank shares, traders
doubted Japan's major opposition parties would agree to the
government plan to let weak banks draw public funds.
	   ``The outlook is extremely severe,'' said Sachio Ishikawa,
general manager of the stock division at Chuo Securities.
	   Blue chips led the decline amid worries about Japan's economic
outlook and fears that earnings for the fiscal half ended September
will be weaker than expected.
	   Traders said the market outlook would remain uncertain until
Japan's ruling and opposition parties agree on how to strengthen
the ailing financial system.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section fell 17.33 points, or 1.71 percent, to close at
996.69, sinking below 1,000 for the first time since November 1985.
	   Trading on the exchange's main section was estimated at 360
million shares, down from 516 million shares Friday. Declines
outnumbered advances 818 to 319, while 157 issues were unchanged.
	   In currency trading, the yen weakened after the G-7 statement

that the G-7 countries expect the European economies to achieve
``stronger growth'' as their recoveries pick up steam.

North Korea denies expelling European charity
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ North Korea denied Monday that it has
expelled the European humanitarian group Doctors without Borders,
saying that the charity withdrew voluntarily.
	   In a news conference in Hong Kong last week, the group announced
that it was forced to pull out from North Korea because of
restrictions on its activities in the secretive communist country.
	   The agency withdrew all 13 aid professionals, including nine
doctors, after talks with North Korea broke down. It said North
Korea asked for pharmaceutical raw materials instead of treating
starving and sick people.
	   The agency also said North Korea imposed various restrictions on
its activities, including how its members can operate, where they
can go and which sectors of the public they can treat.
	   But North Korea claimed that the agency voluntarily agreed to
end its three-year operations, saying that it would introduce other
donor agencies that can provide raw materials to its pharmaceutical
plants.
	   ``This being the fact, U.S., British and some other Western mass
media broadcast incoherent reports that the DPRK (North Korea)
expelled the MSF ...'' a spokesman for the North's Flood Damage
Rehabilitation Committee said in a statement, referring to the
agency by its acronym for its French name, Medicins Sans
Frontieres.
	   The statement was carried by the North's official Korean Central
News Agency.
	   The statement also accused the Western media of spreading false
rumors that relief medicines and food have been diverted to North
Korea's 1.1 million-member military, the world's fifth largest.
	   North Korea's chronic food shortages have been aggravated by
three years of flooding and drought. It has since been relying on
outside aid to feed its 23 million people.
	   U.S. officials who toured some of the hardest-hit regions of
North Korea this summer said 2 million North Koreans may have died
in the famine.

EU debates tightening sanctions as military planners continue their
</HEADLINE>
work &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ As NATO continued with plans for a military
campaign, the EU foreign ministers on Monday debated tighter
economic sanctions against Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to
end to the violence in Kosovo.
	   However, it appeared unlikely the European Union's latest batch
of sanctions _ tighter travel restrictions and freezing more
Yugoslav assets abroad _ would be anything more than symbolic.
	   In recent month, appeals from the EU, the United States and
other nations for a peaceful solution to the Kosovo crisis have
been ignored in Belgrade and economic sanctions have made no
difference.
	   The foreign ministers debated tighter travel restrictions on
Yugoslav officials and extending a freeze on Serbian assets abroad
to cover state-owned companies, such as the national airline JAT.
	   The EU has sought to punish Yugoslavia for its crackdown against
ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo through an investment ban, an
assets freeze, visa restrictions, a ban on arms exports and flights
by Yugoslav air carriers to EU points.
	   These sanctions have not moved Milosevic closer to a peaceful
solution of the Kosovo crisis leading the United States and Britain
to push for a phased military campaign, starting with air strikes.
	   Preparing for an attack, Yugoslavia's air defenses went on high
alert even as Serbian authorities appeared ready for compromise by
installing an interim government in rebellious Kosovo. A Western
diplomat also said up to 120 Yugoslav army armored vehicles,
including tanks, have been pulled out of Kosovo so far.
	   Serbia is the larger of two republics comprising Yugoslavia.
Milosevic launched a crackdown in February against
independence-seeking rebels in Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians
constitute 90 percent of the population. Hundreds have died in the
fighting and 275,000 have been routed from their homes.
	   Crucially, the NATO allies disagree on whether they need a
United Nations Security Council mandate for a military campaign
against Milosevic.
	   Ahead of the EU meeting there was hectic diplomatic activity.
	   In New York, U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan planned to issue
a report on Milosevic's compliance with U.N. demands to halt
Serbia's assault on ethnic Albanians. On Sept. 23, the 15-member
U.N. Security Council threatened unspecified other measures if both
sides failed to abide.
	   Richard Holbrooke, architect of the Bosnian peace accord and
President Bill Clinton's nominee as U.N. ambassador, was to visit
Belgrade for talks with Milosevic.
	   On Sunday, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook held talks in
Paris with French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine. Earlier in the
day, there was a lengthy telephone conversation between Vedrine and
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
	   Also Sunday, Russia's defense and foreign ministers met with
Milosevic. A Russian government statement cautioned NATO against
military action. ``The Russian government thinks it necessary to
emphasize again that using force against a sovereign state without
the sanction of the Security Council would be a rude violation of
the U.N. charter.''

Chief secretary delivers government's report card
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Despite the regional financial turmoil, the
Hong Kong government has met most of the targets it set a year ago,
Chief Secretary Anson Chan said Monday.
	   The territory's top civil servant also pledged that the
government is committed to sharpening crisis management skills and
will ``remain sympathetic to the plight of the community'' at a
time when the public is losing confidence in the government.
	   ``As the head of the civil service, I understand the citizens'
feelings,'' she told a news conference.
	   Chan was speaking at the release of the annual Progress Report,
which details progress made on promises made by each government
department, such as introducing legislation, conducting studies or
improving public services.
	   The government has fulfilled or is in the process of meeting 923
out of 961 policy commitments made last year, representing a 96
percent success rate, slightly higher than 94 percent achieved last
year, Chan said.
	   Most of the those promises lagging behind were related to
economic services and the environment.
	   Chan said Hong Kong had faced ``an unusually challenging and
difficult year.''
	   She cited the outbreak of a mysterious avian flu late last year,
which killed six people and sparked fears of a global epidemic. The
government eventually killed all of the territory's chickens in an
attempt to stamp out the virus.
	   She also cited the 15-month Asian financial storm, which she
said has had enormous ``contagion effects on the world economy,''
and led the territory into the most ``severe economic adjustment
process in recent memory.''
	   Hong Kong people's confidence in the government has been sliding
as the economy sinks deeper into recession. The economy is expected
to shrink by 4 percent this year, unemployment is at a 15-year
high, and inflation is at a 17-year low.
	   A series of health scares and medical blunders, and the chaotic
opening of the U.S. dlrs 20 billion new airport in July, also
clipped citizens' confidence in the civil service, which is largely
a holdover from the colonial era that ended in July 1997.
	   A poll by the Chinese University, commissioned by Apple Daily,
showed that Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa's rating had plunged 18.4
percent in the past year to 55.5 points, the paper reported Monday.
	   The rating for his ability to improve Hong Kong's economic
development has plunged 31.7 percent to 45.2 points, and that for
his general ability to govern had dropped 22.3 percent to 51.8
points, it said.
	   Chan added the government is committed to developing a
heightened sense of crisis and a long-term vision to help Hong Kong
out of current problems.
	   ``Our decisions are guided by what we believe to be in the best
and long term interests of Hong Kong,'' she said.
	   The report was released two days before Tung was to deliver his
second policy address setting targets for the next 12 months.
	   Nearly 38 percent of the respondents to Apple Daily's poll said
Tung needed to address economic issues, and 31.3 percent believed
he should lay out plans to tackle rising unemployment in his policy
blueprint.

Struggling to save government, Italian premier meets with
</HEADLINE>
president &QL; 
 &UR; By CANDICE HUGHES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Struggling to save his government only months before
the launch of the European Monetary Union, Italian Prime Minister
Romano Prodi met Monday with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro.
	   The crisis was provoked by Prodi's far-left ally, the Communist
Refoundation Party, which withdrew its support over the weekend.
Prodi has said he would call a confidence vote if Refoundation
yanked its support. If he does, it could come within the next few
days.
	   Refoundation is not part of Prodi's center-left coalition, but
the government needs its 34 votes to muster a majority in the lower
house. The party rejected Prodi's deficit-cutting 1999 budget,
which is designed to meet the criteria for the common European
currency.
	   Making Italy part of the euro has been Prodi's top priority
since he took office more than two years ago. If he resigns, it
could cast doubts over Italy's ability to stick to the euro
requirements.
	   Prodi might be able to salvage the budget with help from the
centrists.
	   Centrist leader Francesco Cossiga on Sunday said Prodi might be
able to stay on temporarily as the leader of a minority government,
in order to help ensure the passage of the budget. But Cossiga said
his party has no intention of becoming part of a governing majority
led by Prodi.
	   Even if Prodi is forced to quit, political commentators do not
expect early general elections. Scalfaro, they say, would more
likely seek a new coalition with a different make-up, possibly even
led by Prodi.
	   But the embattled premier reiterated over the weekend that the
only majority he would accept was the current one formed after the
April 1996 general election.
	   ``Otherwise, the only thing to do is to go back to the ballot
box,'' Prodi said.
	   Any call for new elections, with their 60-day campaign period,
would have to come almost immediately.
	   Elections are avoided in the last six months of a presidential
term, which begins for Scalfaro in January, because parliament
elects the president and a parliamentary campaign would affect any
vote for head of state.
	   This isn't the first time Refoundation has broken ranks with
Prodi over finance or foreign affairs. The government had to turn
to opposition parties to win important votes on sending Italian
troops last year into Albania and earlier this year on approving
NATO's eastward expansion.

	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A reactor was restarted at Ukraine's
Zaporizhia nuclear power plant following a day of repairs,
officials said Monday.
	   Reactor No. 2 was restarted late Friday after it was stopped the
day before because of a turbine malfunction, the state nuclear
energy company Energoatom said.
	   Another two reactors at Zaporizhia, Europe's largest nuclear
power plant, are undergoing scheduled repairs. The plant has six
Soviet-designed VVER-1000 reactors.

Thai government unveils new Cabinet lineup
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: SUBS 3rd graf to CORRECT seat numbers to account for recent
resignations

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai announced
a new Cabinet lineup Monday that he hopes will stabilize his shaky
coalition government and strengthen efforts to battle the economic
crisis.
	   Chuan's new Cabinet includes members of the Chart Pattana Party,
formerly the second largest opposition party, which agreed to join
the coalition last week.
	   With Chart Pattana's 51 lawmakers, the seven-party coalition
controls a majority 255 seats in the 387-seat House of
Representatives.
	   That should make it easier for the coalition to push its
economic reform package through parliament, where it has met stiff
resistance from the opposition.
	   Despite the reshuffle, Chuan's new Cabinet still has his top
technocrats Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda as finance minister and Supachai
Panichpakdi as commerce minister.
	   ``I look forward to working with Chart Pattana in the new
government,'' Supachai told reporters on Monday. ``I think they
will make a good partner.''
	   Some analysts have questioned, however, whether Chart Pattana
will ultimately destabilize the government by trying to strengthen
its own political hand, as it was accused of doing to the
government of Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, which fell last
November.
	   Critics said the new lineup was made out of political
expediency.
	   ``This new Cabinet is not for the sake of the people, but to
lengthen the life of the government,'' said Dr. Weng Tojirakarn of
the Confederation for Democracy.
	   ``But if the prime minister cannot root out corruption, then the
government will not last,'' he said.
	   Suchit Boonbongkarn, dean of the faculty of political science at
Bangkok's Chulalongkorn University said that Chart Pattana probably
won't do anything to destabilize the coalition since that would
hurt its image for the next election.
	   No election is scheduled until 2000, but no elected Thai
government has ever completed its four-year term, either collapsing
because of coalition squabbles or being overthrown in military
coups.
	   Chart Pattana gained one ministry deemed crucial to economic
recovery: party Secretary-General Suwat Liptapallop was named
minister of industry.
	   Chart Pattana leader Korn Dabbaransi was made a deputy prime
minister while also taking over the ministry of health, which has
been plagued by a corruption scandal.
	   Democrat Secretary General and Minister of Interior Sanan
Kachornprasart _ Chuan's political point man responsible for
forging the coalition together _ was also elevated to a deputy
prime minister.
	   The main threat to the government is the possibility of smaller
parties in the coalition, angry over losing Cabinet seats to
accommodate Chart Pattana, defect to the opposition.
	   Some high-ranking members of smaller parties voiced anger last
week at the prospect of losing coveted posts, but no party has so
far announced intentions to abandon the Chuan government.

Sudanese warplane bombs northeastern Uganda
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ A Sudanese warplane bombed two towns in
northwestern Uganda, wounding six people, Ugandan and aid officials
said Monday.
	   The target appeared to be Sudanese refugees, said Nino Tomoko,
spokeswoman for the U.N. refugee agency. About 158,756 refugees
from Sudan's 15-year civil war are in more than two dozen
settlements in the area.
	   An Antonov dropped six bombs on Pakele and four on Adjumani on
Saturday evening, wounding four women and two children, and
destroying two huts, said Steven Kavuma, state minister for
defense.
	   ``The government of Uganda condemns this act of aggression,''
Kavuma said of the attacks on the towns 350 kilometers (220 miles)
northwest of Kampala.
	   The bombs fell outside the compounds of the U.N. World Food
Program and U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, WFP spokeswoman
Michele Quintaglie said in Nairobi, Kenya.
	   ``Our compounds are the most heavily lit buildings in the
area,'' making them good targets, she said.
	   Uganda has several times in the past accused Sudan of bombings
in the north, including in February 1997 when eight civilians were
injured in Moyo.
	   Sudan has accused Uganda of sending troops to fight in southern
Sudan since Sept. 14. Uganda has denied the reports.
	   Uganda broke diplomatic relations with Sudan in 1995 after both
sides accused the other of supporting rebel groups.
	   Sudanese rebels, drawing support from Christians and followers
of tribal religions, have been waging a military campaign against
the Islamic-led Sudanese government since 1983 for more autonomy
for the southern districts.
	   About 1.5 million people have been killed in the fighting and
resulting famines.

Kiwis confident of series win
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ New Zealand rugby league coach Frank
Endacott believes his players can overcome a long layoff to defy
the odds with a series victory over Australia on Friday.
	   The majority of Endacott's team, seeking a first series win over
the Kangaroos since 1953, play in the Australian competition for
Auckland, which failed to make the finals and have been out of
action for six weeks.
	   Australia has radically revamped its team since the loss in the
first test in April, with nine of the title winning Brisbane
Broncos side picked to play Friday.
	   Endacott has been boosted by the availability of English-based
star Robbie Paul of Bradford.
	   ``If they (Australia) are not on their game, they could find
themselves two-nil down,'' Endacott said Monday. ``All the pressure
is on the Aussie boys but they've responded to that in the past.''
	   Endacott said the Australians had not been strengthened by the
personnel changes.
	   ``We see this as a game we can win _ we beat a better team in
April,'' Endacott said. ``I'm not screaming underdog or favorite _
we just know we can beat them and that's what we'll be thinking
when we run out.''
	   The home team is quoted a 1-5 favorite to level the series in
the first test under new coach Wayne Bennett with New Zealand a 3-1
underdog.
	   The third Test is scheduled for Auckland on Oct. 16.

President's cousin dies in south, third relative lost in war
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ A cousin of Sudan's president, Lt. Gen.
Omar el-Bashir, was killed fighting rebels in southern Sudan,
state-run television announced.
	   The broadcast late Sunday did not say when the cousin, Abu Baker
el-Tayeb Mustafa, was killed. It said he died in East Equatoria,
where government troops have been countering an offensive by the
Sudan People's Liberation Army. He was in his 20s, the television
said.
	   El-Bashir's brother Ahmed was killed in southern Sudan two years
ago. Last year, he lost a niece.
	   Southern rebels have been fighting since 1983 for more autonomy
for the south's Christians and animists from the Islamic north.
	   El-Bashir took power in a military coup in 1989.

Malaysia's Anwar arrives in court with neck brace, trial set

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's charismatic politician
Anwar Ibrahim, who was arrested last month, was denied bail Monday
and ordered to face trial on four corruption charges.
	   A visibly thinner Anwar appeared in court wearing a neck brace
for injuries he has said were sustained in a police beating after
his Sept. 20 arrest. He pleaded innocent to the charges.
	   ``I've been treated worse than any other criminal,'' he said.
Turning to reporters, he tugged at his trousers to show his weight
loss.
	   Anwar, 51, was deputy prime minister until he clashed with Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad over economic policy as Malaysia sank
into recession.
	   Anwar was fired Sept. 2 but continued to challenge Mahathir,
accusing him of corruption and demanding his resignation. He has
repeatedly proclaimed his innocence.
	   Anwar was arrested under the Internal Security Act, which allows
indefinite detention without charge and restricts other rights.
	   In the courtroom, a row of burly policemen blocked Anwar from
talking with his wife, mother and daughters, who sat behind him.
	   But his wife, Azizah Ismail, reached out between two
plainclothes officers to stroke his brow, and he reached back
stiffly to hold his daughter's hand.
	   The judge set his trial date to start Nov. 2. The trial will be
suspended Nov. 14, during an 18-nation summit of Asia-Pacific
leaders, then resume Nov. 23 to take up five charges of illegal
homosexual acts.
	   High Court Judge Augustine Paul issued a gag order against all
public statements about Anwar's guilt or innocence and said the
trial would be conducted in English ``so that justice can be seen
to be done.''
	   Paul ordered police to let Anwar's lawyers visit him to discuss
the case, and denied bail, saying the prosecution had convinced him
that doctors were attending to the jailed politician regularly and
that Anwar might interfere with witnesses.
	   Anwar has not been able to see his family or lawyers except
during two arraignments last week in lower court.
	   ``The judge isn't only me but millions of others,'' said Paul.
	   He noted the international press attention that has brought
expressions of concern from the presidents of the Philippines and
Indonesia, the U.S. State Department and heads of the World Bank,
the United Nations and the International Monetary Fund.
	   Anwar is admired in international financial circles and his
local popularity increased as he challenged Mahathir's
17-year-rule.
	   Meanwhile, the government has embarked on a campaign of its own,
sending Cabinet ministers and ruling party leaders around the
country to explain why Mahathir fired him.
	   Police have banned all gatherings connected with Anwar's reform
movement. They forced two peaceful protests to disperse Sunday.
	   ``It isn't appropriate for anyone to comment on the guilt or
innocence of Anwar either directly or indirectly,'' Paul said. ``To
ensure a fair trial, from today onwards such statements should
cease to be made.''
	   In a reference to Mahathir, who described in detail the sexual
allegations against Anwar at a news conference and said he is sure
to be convicted, Anwar's chief lawyer, Raja Aziz Addruse asked the
judge to act.
	   ``A number of persons of high office have seen fit to express
publicly and in no uncertain terms their views that my client is
already guilty of the offenses,'' Raja Aziz said. ``Their views are
bound to influence the trial of the accused.''
	   The prosecution asked the judge to keep secret a report by four
government doctors who examined Anwar during a weekend hospital
stay until police complete their investigation of how Anwar was
injured.
	   Anwar appeared in court last week with a black eye, and bruises
on his neck and arms. He said police had beat him until he was
unconscious on the night he was arrested.
	   At the end of Monday's hearing, Anwar kissed one of his
daughters and held his wife's hand. But when he approached the
press, he was blocked by a policeman.

Philippine Airlines employees return to work

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine Airlines employees
returned to work after nearly two weeks Monday to prepare to reopen
Asia's oldest airline. PAL officials continued talks with at least
two airlines on an injection of much-needed capital.
	   PAL ticket offices began booking reservations and maintenance
crews readied planes at Manila's international airport in
preparation for Wednesday's reopening.
	   ``We're back to work,'' said Alex Barrientos, president of PAL's
ground crew union.
	   PAL, the Philippines' flag carrier, closed Sept. 23 after
failing to persuade the union to accept a management-proposed
recovery plan.
	   In a second referendum last Friday, a wide majority of the
workers voted to accept the plan, under which their collective
bargaining agreement would be suspended for 10 years in exchange
for a 20 percent share of the company's stock.
	   ``I still want to work and the company has been good to me,''
said Cecille Poco, an employee working at a PAL ticket office in
Manila.
	   PAL executive vice president Manolo Aquino said the airline
would resume 14 round-trip domestic flights on Wednesday, and may
restart some international flights Oct. 15.
	   He said PAL plans to eventually scale down its operations and
has returned several Airbus planes it will no longer need.
	   PAL officials, however, hope to get back two Boeing 747-400
planes seized recently in Los Angeles and Hong Kong at the demand
of one of PAL's foreign creditors, the U.S. Export-Import Bank.
	   Aquino appealed to militant union members still opposing the
recovery plan to abide by the decision of the majority of the
union's 6,700 members.
	   The militant workers said they plan to seek court action to
declare the plan illegal. They claim the plan violates the
constitution, which guarantees the right of workers to form unions
and bargain collectively for labor benefits.
	   President Joseph Estrada has assured the workers that he will
defend their rights during the 10-year suspension, saying it is
only a temporary measure to help PAL and the government cope with
the Asian financial crisis.
	   PAL's closure left much of the Philippine archipelago without
air service, prompting Estrada to enlist Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific
and Dragon Airlines to fly some of PAL's domestic routes to avoid
serious damage to the economy.
	   On Monday, the government announced that Cathay Pacific and
DragonAir will stop their domestic flights in the Philippines on
Wednesday when PAL resumes operations.
	   Cathay Pacific and the United States' Northwest Airlines are
seriously considering buying into PAL, Aquino said.
	   A Cathay Pacific team has been in the Philippines since last
week to study PAL's operations, he said. Northwest officials are
expected to arrive in Manila later this week.
	   Asia's currency crisis hit last year shortly after PAL launched
a dlrs 4 billion modernization program, greatly inflating the
amount of money it must repay to overseas creditors. It has been
unable to make payments on dlrs 2.1 billion of debt.

Tajikistan renames `Communist Peak'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The government of Tajikistan is ditching communism
all over again.
	   Leaders in the Central Asian republic have changed the name of
Communism Peak, the highest mountain in the Pamir range, to Ismail
Samani Peak, the Interfax news agency said Monday.
	   The new name for the 7,495-meter (24,733-feet) mountain honors
the 1100th anniversary of the Samanide state and commemorates its
founder, Ismail Samani, the report said.
	   The peak has gone through a number of name changes. In 1932, it
was entered on maps as Stalin Peak, to honor Soviet Dictator Josef
Stalin. In 1959, Stalin Peak was renamed Communism Peak.
	   The Samanides ruled during the 9th and 10th centuries and united
a large part of Central Asia. Their capital was Bukhara, in
present-day Uzbekistan.

Suspect released into police custody to help with investigation

<TEXT>
	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ A magistrate Monday granted a
prosecution request to release into police custody one of two
suspects charged in the bombing of the U.S. Embassy to assist in
the investigation for five days.
	   During a 10-minute hearing, Chief Resident Magistrate Projest
Rugazia granted the prosecution request that Rashid Saleh Hemed be
released into the custody of Asst. Police Commissioner Robert
Manumba.
	   Hemed, a Tanzanian from Zanzibar, and Egyptian Mustafa Mahmoud
Said Ahmed were formally charged Sept. 21 in the Aug. 7 bombing of
the embassy in which 11 people, all Africans, were killed. Another
70 were injured.
	   In a nearly simultaneous bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi
in neighboring Kenya, 248 people, 12 of them Americans, were
killed. Another 5,400 were injured.
	   After the hearing was adjourned, reporters were able to speak
briefly with Ahmed, who told them he had gone to the British High
Commission in Dar es Salaam the day after the bombing and told
British diplomats and FBI agents there what he knew about the
bombing.
	   ``I told them all what I know before ... when the bombing
happened, I was not in Dar es Salaam, I was in Arusha (northern
Tanzania),'' he said before police took him away.
	   Ahmed repeated earlier claims that he had told both Tanzanian
and Kenyan officials late last year about plans to bomb the embassy
in Dar es Salaam.
	   It was not immediately possible to obtain confirmation from the
British diplomatic mission that Ahmed had gone there three times,
the last on Aug. 18, as he claimed.
	   Both men appeared in court dressed in the same clothes they were
wearing at the Sept. 21 hearing, but their hair and beards had been
trimmed.
	   Hemed appeared to be in his mid-20s, Ahmed in his late 30s.
	   Rugazia set the next hearing for Oct. 19.
	   Two suspects have been indicted in a U.S. federal court in New
York in connection with the Nairobi bombing, a third is a fugitive,
a fourth is awaiting extradition in Germany and a fifth has been
charged in New York with lying to investigations about his
relationship to Saudi exile Osama bin Laden, the alleged mastermind
of the bombings.

Struggling to save government, Italian premier meets with

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Struggling to save his government only months before
the launch of the European Monetary Union, Italian Prime Minister
Romano Prodi met Monday with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro.
	   The crisis was provoked by Prodi's far-left ally, the Communist
Refoundation Party, which withdrew its support over the weekend.
Prodi has said he would call a confidence vote if Refoundation
yanked its support. If he does, it could come within the next few
days.
	   ``I've always acted with coherence. I've never changed strategy
and I don't want to do political gymnastics,'' Prodi told reporters
Monday morning before his meeting with Scalfaro.
	   Refoundation is not part of Prodi's center-left coalition, but
the government needs its 34 votes to muster a majority in the lower
house. The party rejected Prodi's deficit-cutting 1999 budget,
which is designed to meet the criteria for the common European
currency.
	   Making Italy part of the euro has been Prodi's top priority
since he took office in May 1996. If he resigns, it could raise
doubts over Italy's ability to stick to the euro requirements.
	   The crisis cast a pall over Prodi's summit with French Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin and French President Jacques Chirac. Like
Italy, France is a charter member of the currency club.
	   Prodi said that after his meeting with Scalfaro, ``there will be
a period of reflection because at 5.00 p.m. I'm going to Florence
for the Franco-Italian summit.''
	   Prodi heads Italy's 55th government since World War II and, at
28 months old, one of its longest-lasting.
	   But Communist Refoundation has been a difficult ally from the
outset.
	   It broke with Prodi over NATO expansion earlier this year and on
sending troops into Albania last year. Prodi was even forced to
resign a year ago after a bitter battle with Refoundation over
spending cuts linked to the euro. The crisis was resolved after
Prodi made steep concessions, cutting reductions in pension
spending and promising a 35-hour work week.
	   This time around, Prodi might be able to salvage the budget with
help from the centrists.

Flight 111 recorder data garbled, newspaper reports
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Weeks after recovering the flight data recorder
from the wreckage of Swissair Flight 111 in the Atlantic Ocean,
investigators are still struggling to determine whether the black
box has information that will help them determine the cause of the
crash off Peggy's Cove, Newfoundland.
	   Not only are the last six minutes missing from the flight and
voice recorders but the data recorder was plagued with anomalies
before that, the Toronto Globe and Mail reported Monday.
	   Investigators insist they will eventually determine the cause of
the crash that killed 229 people. But the digital record of the
critical minutes when the problems developed are so garbled that it
may offer little more than a pointer to the components or wiring
bundles where the problems began, the paper said.
	   ``We are trying to ascertain what it is telling us,'' Vic
Gerden, the Transport Safety Board's lead investigator, said
Sunday.
	   ``Is it the avionics bay? Is it a (instrument) panel? Is it a
wiring bundle?''
	   Gerden says investigators have not been able to narrow their
focus on the cause of the crash beyond the theory that something
electrical was amiss and that probably _ but not necessarily _
triggered the sequence of problems that ended with the crash.
	   Investigators believe that they must recover key components of
the wreckage that are 60 meters (198 feet) down and eight
kilometers (five kilometers) off the Nova Scotia coast.
	   And with winter fast approaching, recovering the wreckage has
become a race against time.
	   So far only a few lengths of wiring from the more than 160
kilometres (100 miles) aboard the MD-11 have been recovered and
those show no signs of faults, the newspaper reported.
	   The flight data recorder has 256 channels that keep track of
performance of the plane's systems and well as flight-control
inputs and the flight path.
	   Gerden has said that divers have recovered more ``heat
distressed'' bits of the cockpit but he would not say what they
are. He would say that it seems they suffered the consequences of
high temperatures, rather than being the likely source of the heat.
	   He has also said that about six minutes before the crash which
was about the time the pilots declared an emergency in their last
transmission to the air-traffic control tower, there was a
conversation on the cockpit voice recorder.
	   He would not say whether they were commenting about smoke, heat
or visibility or whether conditions were reaching the stage where
it would be difficult to fly the plane.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Russian envoys have warned President
Slobodan Milosevic that NATO may launch airstrikes unless he takes
``decisive measures'' to end the humanitarian crisis in the
southern province of Kosovo.
	   Fearing airstrikes, Yugoslav generals put the nation's air
defense on high alert, but tried a belated compromise by moving
some tanks and other heavy equipment out of Kosovo. A Western
diplomat said up to 120 Yugoslav army armored vehicles, including
tanks, have been pulled out.
	   Milosevic met Sunday with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov
and Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, Serbian President Milan
Milutinovic and Yugoslavia's top defense officials.
	   The Russians are against using NATO force in Kosovo. However,
Ivanov and Sergeyev said the airstrikes could occur ``if decisive
measures are not immediately taken for a radical improvement of the
situation,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin told the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   To avoid such an attack, Yugoslavia must end the hostilities,
withdraw army and security forces, take urgent measures to overcome
the humanitarian crisis, ensure that refugees can return home and
take part in peace talks, he said.
	   Richard Holbrooke, U.S. President Bill Clinton's nominee as
ambassador to the United Nations and the architect of the Bosnian
peace accord, was expected to deliver a similar message when he
meets Milosevic later Monday.
	   In Berlin, German Gen. Dieter Stockmann told German radio that
NATO action could come ``within days.''
	   NATO's decision may depend on a report U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan is scheduled to present to the Security Council Monday
on whether Yugoslavia is meeting U.N. demands.
	   Serb authorities appeared ready for compromise by installing an
interim government in the rebellious province in Serbia, the
dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
	   Serbian police and the Yugoslav army have routed separatist
Kosovo Albanian rebels in the crackdown that began in late
February. The conflict has killed hundreds _ most of them Albanian
civilians _ and left more than 275,000 refugees.
	   A Yugoslav statement said the nation's leaders wanted the Kosovo
dispute solved peacefully, ``but in case we are attacked, we shall
defend our country with all means.''
	   The government said Friday that the fighting had ended and
blamed continuing violence on ethnic Albanian rebels.
	   Serbs reported two attacks Sunday on civilian cars by Albanian
``terrorists'' 25 miles (40 kilometers) south of Pristina, Kosovo's
provincial capital. Elsewhere, a policeman was killed after
stepping on a mine, the Serb Media Center said.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, allied with the ethnic Albanians,
reported heavy fighting between government forces and the
guerrillas 25 miles (40 kilometers) southwest of Pristina.
	   Ethnic Albanian political leaders have rejected the new interim
government, which was drawn up without their participation. The
council is composed of seven Serbs, five ethnic Albanians and the
rest Turks and Muslims.
	   Momentum for outside involvement has increased in the past week
amid revelations of massacres of ethnic Albanian civilians in the
forests of Kosovo.
	   London's Sunday Telegraph reported that Britain is preparing
troops and armored units for Kosovo, to be deployed in a
post-airstrike peacekeeping role. The defense ministry refused to
confirm or deny the report but repeated that Britain was ready to
participate in a NATO attack.
	   French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine met Sunday night with his
British counterpart, Robin Cook, to discuss the situation in
Kosovo, France's Foreign Ministry said.
	   Vedrine and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had a lengthy
telephone conversation as well, the spokesman said.
	   On Sunday, Human Rights Watch said both Milosevic's government
and ethnic Albanian rebels have committed atrocities since the
conflict began, but the government abuses were on a much greater
scale.
	   The report by the New York-based human rights organization says
Milosevic has ``the primary responsibility for gross government
abuses.''

Former coach attacks Australian hierarchy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Former national soccer coach Frank
Arok called Australia's surprise Confederations Cup loss an
``incredible catastrophe'' and called for a review into the
coaching set up Monday.
	   Arok also said Soccer Australia should call off a planned Cup
warm-up match against the United States next month in San Jose.
	   Australia lost the final of the Oceania qualifying series 1-0 to
New Zealand on Sunday, its first loss to its neighbor since 1989.
	   Team coaches Raul Blanco and Les Scheinflug are acting in a
caretaker capacity following the resignation of former England
manager Terry Venables after the failed World Cup campaign earlier
this year.
	   Australia made the final of this year's Confederations Cup,
losing 6-0 to Brazil, but was without European-based stars such as
Mark Bosnich and Harry Kewell on Sunday.
	   ``In the big world people have been sacked for less,'' Arok, who
coached the team from 1983-90, said of the coaches.
	   ``If the new government at Soccer Australia is serious then it
must realize this is an incredible catastrophe, the coach and his
partner have been part of the glory and are now part of this
disaster. In any country it would be hard to defend this.''
	   With Australia missing out on the tournament, in Mexico in
January, Arok said the team should scrap next month's match against
the U.S. because it will rob National League teams of players.
	   ``There's no reason to go there now, what can we learn? If it
was against the world champions France that would be different,''
Arok said.
	   Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Bolivia and Egypt will play the first
round of the Confederations Cup in Mexico City, while France,
Brazil, the U.S. and New Zealand will play in Guadalajara.
	   The victory gave New Zealand its greatest soccer moment since
playing in the 1982 World Cup finals. The country does not have a
national league and the win has taken officials by surprise with no
friendlies scheduled before the tournament.
	   New Zealand Soccer spokesman Glenn Turner said the country might
lobby English officials in a bid to play at Wembley on Nov. 18. He
said England had been scheduled to play Yugoslavia there that day
but the match had been canceled because of fighting in Kosovo.

Cambodian government spokesman backtracks on threats against press
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The Cambodian government on Monday
denied a report it planned to shut down two English-language
newspapers and temporarily expel foreign journalists.
	   The threats against the foreign media surfaced Sunday in a
front-page article of a pro-government newspaper quoting government
spokesman Khieu Kanharith.
	   Khieu Kanharith said Monday that the report in Rasmei Kampuchea
(Light of Cambodia) was based on his responses to questions about a
U.S. congressman's efforts to have the U.S. House of
Representatives condemn Cambodian leader Hun Sen.
	   ``I said if that is the case then I might shut down some
newspapers and have some journalists leave the country. But I
always said maybe... I never took any actions,'' said the
spokesman, who accused the foreign press of exaggerating the
report.
	   However, officials at the information ministry on Sunday were
drafting letters requesting the interior ministry to expel at least
one American journalist and close the two newspapers. Senior
government officials were also believed to have met that afternoon
to discuss the issue.
	   Khieu Kanharith said letters may have been written by overeager
staff and that he never sent any requests to the interior ministry.
	   The Cambodia Daily and the Phnom Penh Post, widely seen as the
only independent newspapers in the country, faced temporary closure
for committing ``serious professional mistakes,'' Rasmei Kampuchea
had quoted Khieu Kanharith saying.
	   The newspaper also quoted him saying American and British
journalists could be temporarily expelled from Cambodia because
their security could not be guaranteed if the U.S. Congress
continued to act against Hun Sen.
	   The House International Relations Committee unanimously passed a
resolution from Representative Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.) calling
for an investigation of Hun Sen for ``possible criminal culpability
for conceiving, directing and sustaining a variety of actions in
violation of international humanitarian law,'' Rohrabacher's office
said Friday.
	   The pressure on the foreign media comes as Hun Sen's ruling
Cambodian People's Party and the two-party opposition are
negotiating to form a government following July 26 national
elections.
	   Hun Sen's party won a slight majority in the election, claiming
64 of 122 seats in parliament, but not the two-thirds necessary to
form a government alone.
	   The Cambodian leader has been heavily criticized by Rohrabacher,
who represents a district in California with a large ethnic
Cambodian community. Rohrabacher has urged the House to pass a
resolution calling for Hun Sen to be tried for genocide and war
crimes in an international court.
	   Hun Sen was a young field commander in the army of the Khmer
Rouge during the brutal communist guerrilla group's 1975-79 rule of
Cambodia.
	   More than 1 million people died from starvation, disease and
execution when the Khmer Rouge were in power. However, historians
and other researchers say there is no evidence that Hun Sen is
responsible for any mass killings.
	   Hun Sen defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1977 and fled to
Vietnam. There he became part of the nucleus of Cambodian
communists that were installed in Phnom Penh after the Vietnamese
expelled the Khmer Rouge from power.

Plunky plungee sets world record for building bungee jump

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ A world record bungee-jump went
ahead in front of thousands of spectators and a live TV audience
Monday with the plungee diving from the Sky Tower casino, the
city's highest building, 630 594 feet (180 meters) toward the
street.
	   The jump by promoter A.J. Hackett set a record for a bungee jump
from a building, and halted traffic in the central city as crowds
gathered to watch.
	   The night-time jump, using a rubber bungee along with two steel
guide cables to prevent Hackett from bouncing or drifting into the
building, took just 8 seconds.
	   ``That (system) keeps me in a nice little slot all the way
down,'' Hackett said before the jump. ``They work beautifully.''
	   In fact the rings on the steel cables slowed his take-off,
causing Hackett to curl out shortly after leaving the jump point,
before plunging headlong to within yards (meters) of the ground. A
thrilled crowd shouted and whistled as he jumped, and as the bungee
cord ended his plunge just above them.
	   He punched his fists into a bunch of yellow balloons as the
bungee tightened, halting his fall.
	   On the ground, he told the television reporter: ``It was
certainly rocking tonight. Something weird happened up the top
there but we got it under control halfway down. There was nothing
that could go wrong.
	   ``You accelerate very fast off the top and then coming down into
the bottom going like mad and I could feel the bungee coming on,
and yeah, the brakes are working, great.''
	   Asked what it does to the body, he said: ``You get a fair bit of
adrenalin pumping round your body, which is fairly nice.''
	   Hackett, a New Zealand entrepreneur and promoter who is credited
with popularizing the ``extreme sport'' pastime of diving from
heights with rubber bands tied to the ankles, had already done two
practice jumps at the weekend.
	   His new record comes 12 years after he jumped 377 feet (115
meters) from the Eiffel Tower in Paris, setting the world record
for a jump from a building.
	   Television New Zealand dedicated 30 minutes of prime-time
television to the jump and a website broadcast it live on the
Internet.
	   Among bigger bungee jumps are one of nearly 3,300 feet (one km)
from a helicopter, and one of 700 feet (200 meters) off a dam in
the 1995 James Bond movie ``Goldeneye.''
	   Bungee jumping is a modernization of a traditional Vanuatu
tribal test of courage in which villagers plunge headfirst from
high platforms with vines tied to their ankles to break their fall
at the last moment -- they hope.

Dollar higher against yen, Japanese stocks fall to new 12-year low
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; UPDATES with late-afternoon dollar and bond rates

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The benchmark index for Tokyo share prices slipped
below 13,000 points for the first time in more than 12 years Monday
amid lingering worries about the health of Japan's economy. The
U.S. dollar rose against the yen.
	   The dollar bought 135.76 yen in late-afternoon trading, up 0.98
yen from late Friday in Tokyo and above its New York level of
135.65 yen on Friday. During the day, it ranged from 134.40 yen to
136.10 yen.
	   The benchmark Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues shed
275.57 points, or 2.08 percent, to close at 12,948.12. The last
time the Nikkei closed below the psychologically important 13,000
mark was on Jan. 30, 1986, when it finished at 12,949.04.
	   On Friday, the Nikkei briefly dropped below 13,000 but later
recovered to post a 26.57-point gain, or 0.20 percent.
	   The yen weakened on disappointment officials at a meeting of the
Group of Seven industrialized nations failed to issue a more
concrete statement about what should be done to fix Japan's
debt-ridden banking sector and revitalize its recession-bound
economy.
	   The statement said G-7 countries expect European economies to
achieve ``stronger growth'' as their recoveries pick up steam,
giving a boost to the German mark, traders said.
	   Japanese institutional investors, such as life insurers and
investment trusts, bought the mark and sold the yen, which boosted
the dollar against the yen in the process, dealers said.
	   ``Everyone seems to feel safe for now in buying the German
currency,'' said Takayuki Togawa, manager of foreign exchange at
Tokai Bank.
	   Traders said stocks would remain weak until Japan's ruling and
opposition parties agree on how to strengthen the ailing financial
system.
	   At their meeting in Washington, the G-7 nations urged Japan to
take ``swift and effective action,'' including the prompt enactment
of measures to support viable banks with public assistance.
	   The G-7 consists of the United States, Japan, Britain, Italy,
France, Canada and Germany.
	   Although the statement gave a boost to bank shares, traders
doubted Japan's major opposition parties would agree to plans to
let weak banks draw public funds.
	   ``The outlook is extremely severe,'' said Sachio Ishikawa,
general manager of the stock division at Chuo Securities.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section fell 17.33 points, or 1.71 percent, to close at
996.69, sinking below 1,000 for the first time since November 1985.
	   Trading on the exchange's main section was estimated at 360
million shares, down from 516 million shares Friday. Declines
outnumbered advances 818 to 319, while 157 issues were unchanged.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 0.730 percent from 0.715 percent Friday, driving its
price down to 109.69 from 109.84 yen.

Foreign Office says British company ignored warnings over Chechnya
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A Foreign Office minister said Monday that the
British phone company whose four employees were kidnapped in
Chechnya at the weekend was specifically warned to withdraw from
Russia's breakaway region, but ignored the advice.
	   ``The advice could not have been clearer, the risks were known
to the company and to the employees,'' said Foreign Office Minister
Derek Fatchett in a British Broadcasting Corp. radio interview.
``The fact that they ignored that advice is a decision they took
themselves and is their responsibility ... It's a mature world and
people have to take mature decisions.''
	   The company, Granger Telecom, said it knew Chechnya was probably
the world's most dangerous place for kidnapping but thought its
staff would be well-protected because they were working on a
government contract to install a telecommunications system.
	   The Granger employees, three Britons and a New Zealand national,
were seized early Saturday after a shoot-out with their bodyguards.
There was no word on any ransom demand for the four men.
	   ``We had a general advice from the Foreign Office about visits
to Chechnya but no specific advice about us,'' Granger Telecom
chief executive Ray Verth told the BBC.
	   Verth, who has now suspended operations in Chechnya, said the
company had ``considered the risks were worth the effort of the
contract.''
	   ``None of our employees were forced to go, they voluntarily went
_ they knew the risks,'' said Verth. ``We understood and believed
they were well catered for because we were contracted with the
Chechen government and Chechen Telecom, who guaranteed our safety,
which obviously has not occurred.''
	   Fatchett said Britain would do all it could to get the men
released.
	   The men were seized just two weeks after Chechen warlords
released two British charity workers who had been held for 14
months.
	   London's Guardian newspaper said Monday that the latest
kidnappings ``cast fresh doubt on Foreign Office claims to have
paid no ransom'' to secure the release of the charity workers.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ In the latest tie-up aimed at preparing for Japan's
``Big Bang'' financial reforms, Sumitomo Life Insurance Co., Nissho
Iwai Corp. and Toyo Securities Co. said Monday they will join
forces in an investment trust business.
	   Sumitomo Life and Nissho Iwai will each buy a part of Toyo
Investment Trust Management Co., an affiliate of Toyo Securities,
the companies said in a statement. Sumitomo will take a 10 percent
stake while Nissho Iwai will take a 25 percent share.
	   A group of companies related to Toyo Securities will together
hold 25 percent of the business which will manage investment trust
funds, Japan's equivalent of mutual funds.
	   Toyo Investment Trust Management now offers Japanese and Asian
stock funds, but as restrictions in the industry are lifted it will
also invest in bonds and other financial products, the companies
said.
	   Through the alliance, Toyo will gain access to the huge customer
bases of Sumitomo Life and Nissho Iwai, the companies said.
	   Nissho Iwai hopes to gain a lineup of exclusive investment trust
funds that it can sell through its securities subsidiary, Nissho
Iwai Securities Co.
	   Sumitomo Life said it entered the alliance so it could offer its
customers ``high quality'' investment trusts and plans to manage
some of the money through a subsidiary it plans to set up next
year.
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A slowdown in price increases for
food and most other commodities led to lower-than-expected
inflation in the Philippines in September, with economists
forecasting further declines in coming months.
	   The government announced Monday that inflation was 10 percent in
September on a year-to-year basis, following a 10.5 percent rise in
August.
	   For the nine months through September, inflation averaged 9.4
percent, below the government's projection of 10 percent for the
year.
	   The September inflation data reflected a notable slowdown in
food prices, which account for about half the consumer price index.
All other commodity groups, except fuel, light and water, showed
similar slowdowns.
	   Economists say the steady drop in inflation since June shows
that a drought attributed to the El Nino weather disturbance in the
first half of the year is no longer affecting consumer prices.
	   The decline also reflects a recent slowdown in economic growth,
economists say.
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine Airlines employees
returned to work after nearly two weeks Monday to prepare to reopen
Asia's oldest airline, while PAL officials continued talks with at
least two airlines on an injection of much-needed capital.
	   PAL ticket offices began booking reservations and maintenance
crews readied planes at Manila's international airport in
preparation for Wednesday's reopening.
	   ``We're back to work,'' said Alex Barrientos, president of PAL's
ground crew union.
	   PAL, the Philippines' flag carrier, closed Sept. 23 after
failing to persuade the union to accept a management-proposed
recovery plan.
	   In a second referendum last Friday, however, a wide majority of
the workers voted to accept the plan, under which their collective
bargaining agreement would be suspended for 10 years in exchange
for a 20 percent share of the company's stock.
	   PAL executive vice president Manolo Aquino said the airline
would resume 14 round-trip domestic flights on Wednesday, and may
restart some international flights Oct. 15.
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ More women than men were laid off as
Taiwan's employment rate fell to a 15-year low because of the
region's economic slowdown, the government said Monday.
	   The overall employment rate fell to 58 percent in the first six
months this year, the lowest since 1983, according to a report by
the Council for Economic Planning and Development.
	   The report found that women had more difficulties finding or
keeping their jobs than did the men. And the sluggish job market
forced women to give up seeking jobs.
	   The employment rate among women dropped 0.45 percentage point
from last year's 45 percent, it said.
	   During the period, women employed by the real estate sector
dropped 10.9 percent, while the number for men increased 1.1
percent.
	   Although Taiwan has largely escaped Asia's economic crisis, it
has begun to feel more of the impact in the last few months.
	   Exports have dropped 7.4 percent in the first eight months this
year, and the unemployment rate climbed to a two-year high of 3
percent in August.
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia has agreed to buy 300,000
tons of 25 percent broken rice from Vietnam for dlrs 288.50 per
ton, on a cost and freight basis in a government-to-government
deal, an Indonesian official said Monday.
	   The official, who spoke to Dow Jones Newswires on condition of
anonymity, said the first 200,000 tons would be shipped during
October, November and December,
	   The other 100,000 tons would be sent at a later date.
	   The official from Indonesia's National Logistics Agency said the
deal was decided late Friday with Vietnam Southern Food Corp.,
which was authorized to negotiate the deal with Indonesia.
	   Indonesia, due to disappointing harvests and the worst economic
crisis in 30 years, is importing 4.1 million tons of rice this
fiscal year.
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Flooded by cheap imports due to regional currency
depreciations, China plans to impose regulations against unfair
pricing of chemical fiber products, state media reported Monday.
	   ``Anti-dumping regulations have become unavoidable since
imported products have severely disordered the domestic chemical
fiber market,'' the official newspaper China Daily quoted Xu
Kunyuan, vice director of the State Textile Industry Bureau, as
saying.
	   Continuous price cuts by foreign makers of chemical fiber
spurred China's imports of such products to 1.81 million tons last
year, equivalent to 39 percent of the country's total output, the
report said.
	   China imported 873,000 tons of chemical fibers in the first half
of this year, equal to 37.4 percent of the total domestic output
during the same period, the report said.
	   Sluggish domestic demand, cheap imports and inefficiency within
state-run industries have caused stockpiles in many sectors to
accumulate, leading companies to slash prices to compete.
	   The government has sought to prevent further price cuts, saying
they erode state company profits and tax revenues, hurt the ability
of banks to collect debt and could even threaten national economic
growth.

Captain of sunken Philippine ferry found dead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The missing captain of a Philippine
ferry that sank last month outside of Manila Bay has been
identified among unclaimed bodies at a funeral parlor,
investigators said Monday.
	   National Bureau of Investigation fingerprint expert Bayani Palad
said Capt. Esrum Mahilum, skipper of the Princess of the Orient,
was identified after a rechecking of the bodies of 11 unidentified
victims.
	   The ferry, with 505 people aboard, sank Sept. 18 in stormy
weather off Batangas province, leaving at least 70 people dead and
80 others missing.
	   Palad said he had ordered the opening of all sealed caskets at
the parlor as part of a check on reports that Mahilum may have
survived the accident and was in hiding. He said fingerprints from
one of the bodies matched Mahilum's.
	   Authorities had offered a reward for information about Mahilum's
location.
	   Meanwhile, the coast guard laid barriers along Manila's coast in
an effort to control the spread of oil leaking from the sunken
ship.
	   The ship was carrying at least 600,000 liters (160,000 gallons)
of fuel oil when it sank. In some areas, the oil slick is two
inches (5 centimeters) thick and has damaged oyster and fish farms.
It could also affect beach resorts and damage marine resources.
	   Sulpicio Lines has a total of 32 ships. It also owned the Dona
Paz, a ferry that collided with a tanker in 1987, killing 4,341 in
the world's worst peacetime shipping disaster. A year later, 250
people died in the sinking of another ship owned by the company,
the Dona Marilyn.
	   The company initially refused to pay for the oil cleanup, but
began negotiating after the coast guard warned it might face legal
charges or a suspension of its franchise.
	   Ships and ferries are the main mode of transportation is this
country of 7,107 islands. Many of the vessels are old.

Flight 111 recorder data garbled, newspaper reports
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS in lead to read Nova Scotia. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Weeks after recovering the flight data recorder
from the wreckage of Swissair Flight 111 in the Atlantic Ocean,
investigators are still struggling to determine whether the black
box has information that will help them determine the cause of the
crash off Peggy's Cove, Nova Scotia.
	   Not only are the last six minutes missing from the flight and
voice recorders but the data recorder was plagued with anomalies
before that, the Toronto Globe and Mail reported Monday.
	   Investigators insist they will eventually determine the cause of
the crash that killed 229 people. But the digital record of the
critical minutes when the problems developed are so garbled that it
may offer little more than a pointer to the components or wiring
bundles where the problems began, the paper said.
	   ``We are trying to ascertain what it is telling us,'' Vic
Gerden, the Transport Safety Board's lead investigator, said
Sunday.
	   ``Is it the avionics bay? Is it a (instrument) panel? Is it a
wiring bundle?''
	   Gerden says investigators have not been able to narrow their
focus on the cause of the crash beyond the theory that something
electrical was amiss and that probably _ but not necessarily _
triggered the sequence of problems that ended with the crash.
	   Investigators believe that they must recover key components of
the wreckage that are 60 meters (198 feet) down and eight
kilometers (five kilometers) off the Nova Scotia coast.
	   And with winter fast approaching, recovering the wreckage has
become a race against time.
	   So far only a few lengths of wiring from the more than 160
kilometres (100 miles) aboard the MD-11 have been recovered and
those show no signs of faults, the newspaper reported.
	   The flight data recorder has 256 channels that keep track of
performance of the plane's systems and well as flight-control
inputs and the flight path.
	   Gerden has said that divers have recovered more ``heat
distressed'' bits of the cockpit but he would not say what they
are. He would say that it seems they suffered the consequences of
high temperatures, rather than being the likely source of the heat.
	   He has also said that about six minutes before the crash which
was about the time the pilots declared an emergency in their last
transmission to the air-traffic control tower, there was a
conversation on the cockpit voice recorder.
	   He would not say whether they were commenting about smoke, heat
or visibility or whether conditions were reaching the stage where
it would be difficult to fly the plane.

Gerry Adams visits Basque separatists
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BILBAO, Spain (AP) _ Seeking U.S. involvement in resolving
Spain's Basque conflict, political leaders here were to hand Irish
republican leader Gerry Adams a peace proposal on Monday to pass on
to President Bill Clinton when the two meet this month.
	   Adams' one-day visit to the northern Basque region comes less
than three weeks after the armed separatist group ETA announced an
indefinite cease-fire in its campaign for an independent Basque
homeland.
	   Sinn Fein, the party headed by Adams and linked to the Irish
Republican Army, has long maintained connections with the
ETA-linked Herri Batasuna party.
	   Adams, who has already called on the Spanish government to
respond positively to the ETA cease-fire, was expected to leave for
Belfast in the evening carrying an appeal for all-party peace talks
signed by a group calling itself ``The Irish Forum.''
	   The Forum claimed inspiration from the Northern Ireland peace
process that succeeded in hammering out a political settlement for
the troubled British province.
	   Adams, who will tour the United States this month, reportedly
has promised to hand the appeal over to President Clinton, who has
been closely involved with the Northern Irish peace process.
	   A copy of the Forum's appeal _ credited with encouraging ETA to
announce the cease-fire _ has already been sent to South African
President Nelson Mandela and the United Nations.
	   During his stay in the Basque country, Adams was also due to
visit top Herri Batasuna leader Karmelo Landa in his prison cell on
the outskirts of Bilbao.
	   Landa was jailed last December along with 22 other party leaders
convicted of collaborating with terrorism by using free television
electoral broadcast time to show an ETA video calling for peace
talks.
	   ETA, an acronym in the Basque language for Basque Homeland and
Freedom, has killed nearly 800 people since beginning its violent
campaign in 1968.

Report: Shareholder sues over Japan's Yamaichi failure
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A shareholder sued former top executives of failed
Yamaichi Securities Co. for 6 billion yen (dlrs 44.4 million) in
damages Monday, accusing them of lying to hide the massive losses
that sank the company, Kyodo News agency reported.
	   The damage lawsuit _ the first over the defunct brokerage _
names eight executives, including former chairman Tsugio Yukihira,
67, and former president Atsuo Miki, 63, Kyodo said.
	   Tokyo District Court confirmed that a lawsuit had been filed but
refused to provide any details.
	   Yamaichi, formerly one of Japan's top four brokerages, collapsed
last November under the weight of more than 274 billion yen (dlrs
2.03 billion) in off-the-book losses. It was one of the country's
biggest corporate failures ever.
	   The former bosses are accused of damaging the company by
submitting false financial statements on losses incurred during
fiscal 1996, the report said. The suit also alleges the executives
of illegally providing stockholders with 6 billion yen (dlrs 44.4
million) in dividends despite the losses.
	   According to the lawsuit, Yamaichi falsely claimed a profit of
about 170 billion yen (dlrs 1.3 billion) at a stockholders meeting
in June 1997 despite losses of about 420 billion yen (dlrs 3.1
billion) for the year.
	   The lawsuit was filed by a former stockholder from the Tokyo
area, Kyodo said. Court officials refused to identify the
plaintiff.
	   Yukihira and Miki have already been arrested on charges of
making illegal payoffs to corporate racketeers. They have also been
tried on charges of violating commercial and securities laws for
window-dressing financial statements.
	   Yamaichi failed after trying for years to juggle trading losses
stemming from the collapse of real estate and stock markets earlier
in the decade. It closed the last of its branches on March 31,
ending 101 years in business.

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Struggling to save his government only months before
the launch of the European Monetary Union, Italian Prime Minister
Romano Prodi met Monday with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, then
said he'd address Parliament on the political crisis.
	   Prodi said he would consult with the speakers of both houses to
set a date for the speech, which is expected later this week.
	   The political crisis was provoked by Prodi's far-left ally, the
Communist Refoundation Party, which withdrew its support over the
weekend. In the past, Prodi has said he would call a confidence
vote if Refoundation yanked its support.
	   ``I've always acted with coherence. I've never changed strategy
and I don't want to do political gymnastics,'' Prodi said before
meeting with Scalfaro.
	   Prodi did not mention a confidence vote, but it seemed likely.
If Prodi loses, then he would offer his resignation. Once he does,
it is up to the president to decide what to do.
	   Scalfaro could ask Prodi or someone else to form a new
government or he could call elections 2 1/2 years early, something
most analysts think unlikely.
	   Refoundation is not part of Prodi's center-left coalition, but
the government needs its 34 votes to muster a majority in the lower
house. The party rejected Prodi's deficit-cutting 1999 budget,
which is designed to meet the criteria for the common European
currency.
	   Making Italy part of the euro has been Prodi's top priority
since he took office in May 1996. If he resigns, it could raise
doubts over Italy's ability to stick to the euro requirements.
	   The crisis cast a pall over Prodi's summit with French Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin and French President Jacques Chirac. Like
Italy, France is a charter member of the currency club.

Hong Kong share prices tumble
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Share prices in Hong Kong tumbled Monday, with
the key index losing 4 percent following sharp losses in world
markets last week.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index fell 318.92 points to close at
7,564.54. The Hong Kong market was closed for China's national day
on Thursday and Friday.
	   Turnover amounted to 2.85 billion Hong Kong dollars, (U.S. dlrs
365 million), up slightly from Wednesday's 2.41 billion Hong Kong
dollars (U.S. dlrs 308 million).
	   The Hong Kong market will be closed again on Tuesday for the
Chinese Mid-Autumn Festival.
	   Brokers said share prices fell on concerns over the banking
sector following the bailout of Long Term Capital Management, a
U.S. hedge fund.
	   They said several U.S. and European banks are now disclosing
losses on loans to the hedge fund.
	   Trading was light because many investors stayed on the sidelines
until they see how other markets react to the weekend meeting of
the International Monetary Fund in Washington, brokers said.
	   Friday's gains on Wall Street did little to ease worries over
the local market, they said.
	   Shares of banking giant, HSBC Holdings, led the decline, falling
8.00 Hong Kong dollars to 134.00. Hang Seng Bank fell 50 cents to
48.50.
	   Elsewhere, Hutchison Whampoa fell 2.80 dollars to 37.60, Cheung
Kong fell 1.60 dollars to 34.30, and Hong Kong Telecom fell 60
cents to 14.65.

Demonstrators vandalize town hall to protest early closing of pubs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Six people were charged with public
disturbance after demonstrators vandalized a southern Denmark town
hall last weekend to protest a decision to close pubs and cafes an
hour earlier, news reports said Monday.
	   Following complaints that the nightlife in Soenderborg, 240
kilometers (149 miles) southwest of Copenhagen had become too
noisy, local authorities ordered pubs and cafes in the town of
30,000 to close at 4 a.m. instead of 5 a.m.
	   Leaflets were distributed in pubs late Saturday urging patrons
to gather outside the Soenderborg town hall at 4.15 a.m. Sunday,
the local Jydske Vestkysten newspaper said.
	   A crowd of about 200, mainly young people and many of them
intoxicated, threw bottles and rocks at the building, the report
said. A smaller group broke in and smashed computers, furniture and
other office equipment estimated to be worth 100,000 kroner (dlrs
15,625).
	   Six people _ apparently none of the ones who broke in _ were
detained by police, charged with public disturbance and later
released.

U.S. electronics firm Hewlett-Packard to cut Asian sales staff
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ U.S. electronics company Hewlett-Packard said
Monday it hopes to cut 150 employees from its Asian sales offices,
or less than 1 percent of the total in the region.
	   The Palo Alto, California-based firm announced on Friday its
intention to trim 2,500 personnel worldwide, or 2 percent of the
global staff, through a voluntary program.
	   Cecilia Pang, Hewlett-Packard's spokeswoman in Singapore, told
Dow Jones Newswires that employees in Asia were being offered up to
a year's salary or more to leave the company.
	   She said the company is giving them a month to decide, adding
that some will also have the option of transferring to company
operations in a different country.
	   The company employs 25,700 people in Asia and the cuts will be
in South Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia, it
said.
	   Pang added that the company sees no more cuts before next
October, but it wouldn't rule out the possibility.
	   Hewlett-Packard has been hard hit by the Asian economic crisis,
especially in selling equipment to the struggling semiconductor
industry.

For 2nd time in 2 years, EU rejects cotton import duties
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ The European Union foreign ministers on Monday
decided not to impose duties on imports of unbleached cotton from
India, China, Indonesia, Pakistan and Egypt.
	   Britain, which opposed the duties sought by the EU executive
Commission, hailed the decision as a job saver and a booster shot
for fair trade
	   ``I am very pleased ... our sustained lobbying has borne
fruit,'' Deputy Foreign Secretary Joyce Quinn said in the margin of
an EU foreign ministers meeting.
	   She said the ``duties could have cost tens of thousands of jobs
in the United Kingdom alone. It is also very good news for the
developing countries (and for) fairer world trade.''
	   The European Commission proposed on July 29 to slap five-year
anti-dumping duties on imports of unbleached cotton fabrics from
China, Egypt, India, Indonesia and Pakistan. These would have
averaged 15 percent with imports from Pakistan reaching as high as
32.5 percent.
	   It was the second time in two years the EU foreign ministers
declined to follow the European Commission which proposed the
duties based on a complaint from European cotton and textile
industries that outsiders were dumping cotton at unreasonably low
prices on the EU market.
	   The issue has long split the 15 EU governments. France, Italy,
Spain and Portugal supported the duties. Seven other nations backed
Britain opposed them and warned they would raise prices of raw
material used by Europe's textile finishing sector.
	   Dumping involves selling a product abroad at a price lower than
in the producer's home market.
	   On Aug. 11, India filed complaints with the World Trade
Organization in Geneva over the proposed EU anti-dumping duties
claiming the move violated WTO rules.

U.N. agency says youngsters under increasing threat from AIDS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The world's children are under increasing threat
from the AIDS epidemic, the Joint United Nations Program on
HIV/AIDS said Monday.
	   More than 500,000 infants are estimated to have been infected
with HIV last year through mother-to-child transmission before or
during birth or by breast feeding, a press release from UNAIDS
said.
	   Almost half of new HIV infections _ some 7,000 every day _ occur
among people aged 10-24, the release said. Adolescent girls and
boys are now among those at the highest risk of HIV infection due
to having unprotected sex or sharing contaminated needles while
injecting drugs.
	   Peter Piot, executive director of UNAIDS, said restricting
access to sex education aimed at postponing first sexual
intercourse and practising safer sex is a violation of children's
rights.
	   ``Girls and boys need to understand how to help take charge of
their own lives _ to protect themselves and others from the virus
in situations of risk,'' Piot said.
	   Piot is among experts taking part in a meeting today in Geneva
organized by the Committee on the Rights of the Child, a U.N. human
rights body that monitors states' compliance with the U.N.
Convention on the Rights of the Child.
	   Adopted by the United Nations in 1989, the convention commits
the 191 governments that have ratified it to ensuring that all
children under 18 can get health care, education and psychological
and social support. The United States and Somalia have still to
sign up.

Vice president says no cooperation unless sanctions lifted

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq will not resume cooperation with U.N.
weapons inspectors unless the Security Council removes punishing
trade sanctions, a senior Iraqi official said Monday.
	   Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan said that Iraq's decision of
Aug. 5 to suspend cooperation with the inspectors ``is a decision
which cannot be reversed.''
	   ``Iraq cannot go on bearing the injustice it has been subjected
to,'' Ramadan said. ``The status quo is totally unacceptable to
Iraq.''
	   He made the remarks in an address he delivered on behalf of
Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein at the opening of a three-day
conference for Iraqis who live abroad. The conference for
expatriates drew about 1,000 people.
	   His comments came as U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan was
scheduled to report to the Security Council on Monday on meetings
he held in New York last week with Iraq's deputy prime minister,
Tariq Aziz.
	   Annan has spoken of a ``comprehensive review'' of Iraq's
disarmament efforts _ a step that could lead to the lifting of
trade sanctions _ but only if Iraq agrees to resume cooperation
with U.N. inspectors.
	   The sanctions, which limit Iraq's sale of oil and ban air travel
and other financial dealings, were imposed after Iraq's 1990
invasion of Kuwait.
	   The Security Council has said they will not be lifted until U.N.
inspectors certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass
destruction. Iraq insists it has done so, but U.N. inspectors say
Baghdad still is hiding information on chemical and biological
weapons.
	   On Aug. 5, Saddam announced that the country would not longer
cooperate with the inspectors, charging that they were working to
prolong the punishing sanctions.
	   In his speech, Ramadan said that Iraq would only allow the
inspectors to resume work after the Security Council acts ``to
close weapons files and to implement Paragraph 22'' of U.N.
Security Council Resolution 687, which calls for lifting the
sanctions.
	   Ramadan also said Iraq wants the U.N. Special Commission, which
oversees inspections, to be restructured.
	   In the past, Iraq said the inspectors were U.S. and British
spies. In his speech, Ramadan referred to recent disclosures that
UNSCOM had contacts with Western intelligence agencies and insisted
that it be freed of influence by U.S. and Israeli spy agencies.
	   Ramadan repeated Iraq's allegation that the United States was
campaigning to keep the sanctions in place to try to topple Saddam.
	   He accused Washington of ``blatant hostility against the Iraqi
people'' and added: ``America is pursuing all means to topple the
regime in Iraq.''

Talks on governing Lesotho turn to interim rule
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ The governing and opposition parties of
Lesotho opened negotiations Monday at loggerheads over who will
govern the country until early elections in 15 to 18 months.
	   The talks, brokered by representatives of the Southern African
Development Community, followed last month's military intervention
by South Africa troops to quell unrest and restore the government's
authority.
	   The intervention, under the auspices of the SADC, led to massive
destruction of the capital and the deaths of scores of people in
the mountain kingdom of 2 million people.
	   The Lesotho Democratic Congress party, which swept last May's
elections, says it will not form a government of national unity
until the next balloting, South African Press Association reported.
	   The opposition parties are demanding a role in the interim
administration. They accuse the government of stealing the last
election.
	   The parties reported progress on Friday, when they tentatively
agreed to the new elections.

EU official says Japan needs more fiscal stimulus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan should move quickly to clean up bad bank
debts, ease government regulations and boost the economy with
fiscal stimulus measures, a European Union official said Monday.
	   Ambassador Ove Juul Joergensen, who heads the European
Commission in Japan, said the widening global financial crisis
requires prompt and effective action from Tokyo.
	   ``What we need now is swift, decisive action to put forward
these policies and implement them,'' he said.
	   Joergensen, briefing reporters ahead of the EU-Japan ministerial
meeting next Monday in Tokyo, said the meeting will focus on issues
of trade and international stability.
	   Other issues to be discussed include deregulation and
international crime.
	   ``Japan and the European Union must cooperate on the structure
of the international financial architecture to make sure it meets
the needs of the 21st century,'' he said.
	   The European delegation will be lead by EU Trade Commissioner
Leon Brittan, who will meet with Japanese politicians and
businessmen in addition to his talks with the government. Foreign
Minister Masahiko Komura will head the Japanese side of the talks.
	   Brittan will be accompanied on his trip by about 20 executives
from European companies to discuss business opportunities in Japan,
Joergensen said.

	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ A Sudanese warplane bombed two towns in
northwestern Uganda, wounding six people, Ugandan and aid officials
said Monday.
	   The target appeared to be Sudanese refugees, said Nino Tomoko,
spokeswoman for the U.N. refugee agency. About 158,756 refugees
from Sudan's 15-year civil war are in more than two dozen
settlements in the area.
	   An Antonov dropped six bombs on Pakele and four on Adjumani on
Saturday evening, wounding four women and two children, and
destroying two huts, said Steven Kavuma, state minister for
defense.
	   ``The government of Uganda condemns this act of aggression,''
Kavuma said of the attacks on the towns 350 kilometers (220 miles)
northwest of Kampala.
	   In Khartoum, the government denied Sudan had bombed Uganda.
``This is not true, and they have to provide the evidence,'' said
Hassan Abdin, permanent secretary in the Sudanese Foreign Ministry.

U.S. envoy Holbrooke says Kosovo situation as bad as two weeks ago
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke
said Monday the military situation in Kosovo was as bad now as two
weeks ago.
	   Holbrooke said he will explain the ``extreme gravity of the
situation'' when he meets Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
later Monday.
	   Speaking after a meeting with NATO Secretary General Javier
Solana and Supreme Allied Commander Europe Wesley K. Clark,
Holbrooke said ``while the level of fighting (in Kosovo) may have
abated temporarily, the capacity for its resumption is there.''
	   ``The situation therefore remains fully as serious today as it
was a week or two ago,'' he told reporters before flying to
Belgrade.
	   He plans to meet with the Kosovan Albanian leaders on Tuesday.
	   ``We hope to make clear to president Milosevic and the people of
Yugoslavia the extreme gravity of the situation,'' he said.

Demonstrators vandalize town hall to protest early closing of pubs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Demonstrators vandalized a town hall
in southern Denmark after police closed pubs and cafes early, news
reports said Monday.
	   Six people were charged with public disturbance in connection
with the incident.
	   Following complaints that the nightlife in Soenderborg, 240
kilometers (149 miles) southwest of Copenhagen had become too
noisy, local authorities ordered pubs and cafes in the town of
30,000 to close at 4 a.m. instead of 5 a.m.
	   Leaflets were distributed in pubs late Saturday urging patrons
to gather outside the Soenderborg town hall at 4.15 a.m. Sunday,
the local Jydske Vestkysten newspaper said.
	   A crowd of about 200, mainly young people and many of them
intoxicated, threw bottles and rocks at the building, the report
said. A smaller group broke in and smashed computers, furniture and
other office equipment estimated to be worth 100,000 kroner (dlrs
15,625).

Indonesian president attacks radical revolutionary groups
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS details of protests, comments by president &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's beleaguered president
urged the nation's powerful military Monday to safeguard his
economic and political reform program against ``radical
revolutionaries.''
	   In a speech marking the 53rd anniversary of the founding of the
military, President B.J. Habibie said Indonesia was threatened with
national disintegration.
	   ``Some of the radical revolutionary movement leaders have
planned to stage actions to force their wishes on the people in the
capital and in several regions,'' Habibie said, without identifying
the leaders.
	   Habibie took power in May when riots and protests forced
President Suharto to quit after 32 authoritarian years in power.
	   In recent weeks Habibie has himself been targeted by a new wave
of protests by students and others over his inability to stem the
worst effects of a deep economic crisis and the slow pace of
promised political reform.
	   Looting and lawlessness have also erupted sporadically in some
areas hit hard by soaring prices and food shortages.
	   Newspapers on Monday reported that several retired army generals
were backing a plan by student leaders to launch a 40-day protest
campaign to force Habibie to resign.
	   In Jakarta, hundreds of students and others staged three
protests against the military's role in politics.
	   In one instance, about 300 protesters blocked a major road near
the Parliament after police and troops stop a street march. There
were no reports of arrests or injuries.
	   In his speech at a parade of troops at Jakarta's military base,
Habibie did not name the groups he accused of threatening the
Indonesian nation, which is enduring its worst economic crisis in
30 years.
	   He said his reform efforts must not be ``stained by the actions
of radical revolutionary groups, which contain the potential for
destruction, disintegration and unconstitutionality.''
	   Habibie also repeated earlier calls for the military to reform
``its vision, mission, policy and strategy'' after years of human
rights abuses. He said national security had to be maintained to
protect the push for reform.
	   ``Efforts to overcome the economic crisis and steps toward
reform require stability and order,'' he said.
	   Under Suharto, the military was accused of widespread human
rights abuses and atrocities.
	   However, since the old leader's departure from power armed
forces commander Gen. Wiranto has promised to implement sweeping
reforms and to rethink the military's role in society and politics.
	   Newspapers quoted Wiranto on Monday as saying he did not want
his troops to be regarded by Indonesians only as ``cruel murderers
and destroyers.''
	   Habibie urged the military to upgrade its professionalism. He
also backed a plan to separate the police force from the command of
the military.

	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss-Swedish engineering group Asea
Brown Boveri said Monday it has won a contract worth more than dlrs
350 million to build a power plant in the United States.
	   The order for a 1,000 megawatt power plant near Dallas, Texas
was placed by American National Power Inc., a subsidiary of
Britain's National Power PLC, ABB said in a statement.
	   In addition to the engineering and construction work, as the
engineering and construction work, ABB is to supply four gas
turbines and associated steam turbines, electrical generators and
heat recovery steam generators to the project.
	   The plant will be one of the largest merchant power plants in
the United States, delivering power according to short-term market
demands rather than longer-term contracts.

Jakarta's governor warns the well off not to flaunt wealth
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The governor of Indonesia's teeming
capital has warned affluent citizens not to flaunt their wealth in
front of fast-growing numbers of poor.
	   Gov. Sutiyoso was quoted by The Jakarta Post Monday as saying
that the wearing of expensive jewelry, for instance, could provoke
violent robberies.
	   He was quoted as saying that rising violent crime was ``a
consequence of the current economic crisis and never ending
hardships faced by many people here.''
	   ``To protect ourselves from becoming a target we should first do
something ourselves, such as avoid showing off our belongings,'' he
said.
	   Indonesia is beset by soaring inflation and mass unemployment in
its struggle against the worst economic meltdown in decades.
	   Looting broke out across the city of 11 million in May during
riots in which 1,200 people were killed. That violence helped force
autocratic President Suharto to quit after 32 years in power.
	   The government has warned that millions of people in the capital
and across the nation are sliding fast below its official poverty
line. Many face food shortages as prices for basic items climb
beyond their reach.
	   The paper reported that police predict violent crime will
increase as the economy crisis grinds on.
	   It cited two recent murders. Last week a man was shot to death
by robbers after he himself had stolen about dlrs 600 from his
company. Earlier a woman and her 6-year-old daughter were killed
when their house was robbed.

EU debates tightening sanctions as military planners continue their
</HEADLINE>
work &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ As NATO continued with plans for a military
campaign, EU foreign ministers on Monday debated tighter economic
sanctions against Yugoslavia.
	   However, it appeared unlikely the European Union's latest batch
of sanctions _ tighter travel restrictions and freezing more
Yugoslav assets abroad _ would be anything more than symbolic.
	   In recent months, appeals from the EU, the United States and
other nations for a peaceful solution to the Kosovo crisis have
been ignored in Belgrade and economic sanctions have made no
difference.
	   The foreign ministers debated tighter travel restrictions on
Yugoslav officials and extending a freeze on Serbian assets abroad
to cover state-owned companies, such as the national airline JAT.
	   The EU has sought to punish Yugoslavia for its crackdown against
ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo through an investment ban, an
assets freeze, visa restrictions, a ban on arms exports and flights
by Yugoslav air carriers to EU points.
	   These sanctions have not moved Yugoslav leaders any closer to a
peaceful solution in Kosovo, leading the United States and Britain
to push for a phased military campaign, starting with air strikes.

Russian delegation tells Milosevic to comply

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The United States and Russia are
ratcheting up the pressure on President Slobodan Milosevic, warning
that NATO airstrikes are inevitable unless he takes decisive action
soon to end the humanitarian crisis in the southern Serbian
province.
	   Fearing airstrikes, Yugoslav generals put the nation's air
defense on high alert, but tried a belated compromise by moving
some tanks and other heavy equipment out of Kosovo. A Western
diplomat said up to 120 Yugoslav army armored vehicles, including
tanks, have been pulled out.
	   In Brussels, Belgium, however, U.S. special envoy Richard
Holbrooke told reporters Monday that the situation in Kosovo is as
bad now as two weeks ago. Holbrooke is en route to Belgrade for a
meeting with Milosevic.
	   ``While the level of fighting (in Kosovo) may have abated
temporarily, the capacity for its resumption is there,'' Holbrooke
said after a meeting with NATO Secretary General Javier Solana and
Supreme Allied Commander Europe Wesley K. Clark.
	   ``The situation therefore remains fully as serious today as it
was a week or two ago,'' he said. ``We hope to make clear to
president Milosevic and the people of Yugoslavia the extreme
gravity of the situation.''
	   On Sunday, Milosevic met with Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov and Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, Serbian President Milan
Milutinovic and Yugoslavia's top defense officials.
	   The Russians are against using NATO force in Kosovo. However,
Ivanov and Sergeyev said the airstrikes could occur ``if decisive
measures are not immediately taken for a radical improvement of the
situation,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin told the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   To avoid such an attack, Yugoslavia must end the hostilities,
withdraw army and security forces, take urgent measures to overcome
the humanitarian crisis, ensure that refugees can return home and
take part in peace talks, he said.
	   In Berlin, German Gen. Dieter Stoeckmann told German radio that
NATO action could come ``within days.''
	   NATO's decision may depend on a report U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan is scheduled to present to the Security Council Monday
on whether Yugoslavia is meeting U.N. demands.
	   Serb authorities appeared ready for compromise by installing an
interim government in the rebellious province in Serbia, the
dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
	   Serbian police and the Yugoslav army have routed separatist
Kosovo Albanian rebels in the crackdown that began in late
February. The conflict has killed hundreds _ most of them Albanian
civilians _ and left more than 275,000 refugees.
	   A Yugoslav statement said the nation's leaders wanted the Kosovo
dispute solved peacefully, ``but in case we are attacked, we shall
defend our country with all means.''
	   The government said Friday that the fighting had ended and
blamed continuing violence on ethnic Albanian rebels, who are
fighting for independence for the Serbian province.
	   Although the United States and Europeans want an end to the
fighting, they also oppose independence for the majority Albanian
province, fearing that could destabilize other Balkan countries
with Albanian populations.
	   In the Kosovo capital Pristina, the KLA offered to help NATO
forces if asked. KLA spokesman Jakup Krasniqi said in a statement
published Monday by the Albanian language newspaper Bujku that ``we
wish they (airstrikes) would become reality'' and ``we shall
provide assistance... if it is asked of us.''
	   Krasniqi accused ethnic Albanian politicians of having ``given
up on independence'' and having become ``the servants of the
enemy,'' by agreeing to accept autonomy but not independence.
	   Serbs reported two attacks Sunday on civilian cars by Albanian
``terrorists'' 25 miles (40 kilometers) south of Pristina, Kosovo's
provincial capital. Elsewhere, a policeman was killed after
stepping on a mine, the Serb Media Center said.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, allied with the ethnic Albanians,
reported heavy fighting between government forces and the
guerrillas 25 miles (40 kilometers) southwest of Pristina.
	   Ethnic Albanian political leaders have rejected the new interim
government, which was drawn up without their participation. The
council is composed of seven Serbs, five ethnic Albanians and the
rest Turks and Muslims.
	   Momentum for outside involvement has increased in the past week
amid revelations of massacres of ethnic Albanian civilians in the
forests of Kosovo.
	   London's Sunday Telegraph reported that Britain is preparing
troops and armored units for Kosovo, to be deployed in a
post-airstrike peacekeeping role. The defense ministry refused to
confirm or deny the report but repeated that Britain was ready to
participate in a NATO attack.
	   French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine met Sunday night with his
British counterpart, Robin Cook, to discuss the situation in
Kosovo, France's Foreign Ministry said.
	   Vedrine and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had a lengthy
telephone conversation as well, the spokesman said.
	   On Sunday, Human Rights Watch said both Milosevic's government
and ethnic Albanian rebels have committed atrocities since the
conflict began, but the government abuses were on a much greater
scale.
	   The report by the New York-based human rights organization says
Milosevic has ``the primary responsibility for gross government
abuses.''

Palestinians: Only Israeli movement can bring about accord
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERICHO, West Bank (AP) _ On the eve of U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright's arrival, a top Palestinian official said
without Israeli concessions, her latest peace efforts ``won't go
anywhere.''
	   Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, speaking to Associated Press
Television News in the West Bank town of Jericho, also accused the
Clinton administration of allowing Israel to drag its feet on
living up to past accords.
	   ``I hope Madame Albright will end this cycle _ meeting and
arranging other meetings, giving (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin)
Netanyahu the extra miles _ because this must stop and we must move
to substance,'' he told APTN.
	   ``We believe that without a clear-cut Netanyahu `yes' to the
American initiative and all its components, I think we won't go
anywhere,'' Erekat said.
	   The Palestinians earlier this year accepted terms of an
American-authored plan for an Israeli troop pullback in the West
Bank, but Netanyahu balked, citing security concerns. Talks in the
United States last week apparently brought the two sides closer
together, however.
	   Albright was to meet Tuesday _ separately _ with Netanyahu and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. Her visit is meant to lay the
groundwork for an Israeli-Palestinian summit in Washington sometime
around Oct. 15.
	   Albright was to spend only two days in the region, but was
accompanied by mediator Dennis Ross, who will likely stay longer to
try to coax the two sides as close to an accord as possible before
any summit.
	   Israeli officials had no immediate comment on Erekat's remarks.
Much of the country was shut down for the Jewish holiday of Sukkot,
which lasts for one week, but main commemorations were Monday.
	   However, Netanyahu has consistently said that no deal is
possible without better security cooperation from Arafat's
Palestinian Authority. The Palestinians say even diligent efforts
cannot provide total protection against attacks on Israel by
Islamic militants.
	   On Monday's holiday, the Palestinian lands remained sealed off,
as they have been for much of the time since a series of Jewish
holidays beginning with the New Year on Sept. 20.
	   In imposing the closure, Israel cited security threats from the
radical Islamic group Hamas, which threatened revenge after two of
its top members were slain last month by Israeli troops who raided
their West Bank hideout.
	   Hamas has killed dozens of Israelis in suicide bombings since
1994.
	   In the Gaza Strip, about 500 people staged a rally to demand the
release of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. Sheik Ahmed
Yassin, the spiritual leader of Hamas, attended, but did not
address the crowd.

Scare over mutual fund causes sharp fall of stock index
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Indian stocks fell sharply Monday in
nervous selling over fears that the Unit Trust of India, the
country's largest mutual fund manager, would reduce its investment
in shares.
	   By noon Monday, the Sensex of the Bombay Stock Exchange, the
benchmark index, was down 6 percent, the sharpest fall since March
31,1997, when the index fell more than 8 percent in reaction to the
fall of the United Front coalition government.
	   Last week, UTI Chairman P.S. Subramanyam said its largest US-64
mutual fund plan was losing money because of a steep fall in share
prices. The market has dropped in response to international
sanctions slapped on India after it conducted nuclear tests in May
and because of India's downgrading by international rating
agencies.
	   UTI accounts for more than 80 percent of investments in the
mutual fund industry, and US-64 accounts for nearly a third of
UTI's investments.
	   The UTI chairman said last week the fund may reduce US-64's
investments in equity from 64 percent to 60 percent. This lead to
fears that UTI will emerge as a major seller.
	   But Subramanyam told Dow Jones Newswires on Monday there are no
redemption pressures on the US-64 fund, but new funds will be
channeled into non-equity investments.
	   ``We won't go selling our shares at their current prices,'' he
said. ``We will invest the new funds in non-equity instruments and
bring down the exposure in equities.''
	   Most of the selling appeared to be from small holders.
``Corporates have reassured me they are with us,'' Subramanyam
said. Around 30 percent of the US-64 units are held by companies.
	   Analysts said another factor in the sell-off could be fears of
political instability after the Akali Dal party, until now a
staunch ally of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, threatened to
withdraw support to the government unless a regional dispute is
solved in its favor.
	   There has been an across the board drop in share prices and
dealers said the fall was because a long weekend _ it is festival
season in India _ did not allow the market to react to political
news.
	   However, V Ramesh, general manager of Mafatlal Securities said
Monday's fall was nothing to worry about.
	   ``It's speculative hammering. I think its a good time to buy.''

Government courts foreign lenders, intends to modernize nuclear
</HEADLINE>
arsenals &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The government continued to push Monday for
foreign aid to rescue the tattered Russian economy after a top
official said modernizing the country's nuclear missile force was a
top priority.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's government is still trying to
come up with a strategy to deal with the country's economic crisis
after Russian currency and financial markets collapsed in August.
International financial institutions are reluctant to resume loans
until the government unveils its economic strategy.
	   First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov, a former top Soviet
economic official, said that in addition to dealing with the
crisis, the government must pursue long-term goals, such as
modernizing its aging nuclear arsenal.
	   ``We must guarantee that in case of any unforeseen incident we
have a strong nuclear shield that would ensure our security and be
capable of inflicting irreparable damage to the enemy,'' he said in
a television interview Sunday night.
	   Maslyukov said he backs ratification of the START II arms
reduction agreement with the United States that has been repeatedly
delayed by the Russian parliament.
	   He added, however, that the ratification must hinge on progress
on further arms cuts and Russia speeding up production of the new
Topol-M ballistic missiles to replace aging weapons.
	   ``We must take steps to produce at least 35-40 such missiles a
year,'' he said.
	   The Topol-M entered service last fall, but the cash-strapped
government has only been able to procure a small number of them,
according to media reports.
	   Primakov and Maslyukov have insisted possible plans to reduce
free economic activity were just one of many options under
consideration. Leaks in the Russian media that the new government
would roll back market reforms have worried Russian and foreign
business leaders.
	   Maslyukov specifically denied that he favors ending the ruble's
convertibility or nationalization of banks.
	   ``There are no grounds to say anyone in this government plans to
ban the use of the dollar, limit the import of dollars or the right
of residents to buy or sell dollars,'' Maslyukov said. ``That is
nonsense.''
	   But the Russian government says it must have more foreign loans.
	   Russia's Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov and Central Bank
Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko, in Washington for meetings with
international lenders, have been asking the International Monetary
Fund and the World Bank to deliver an earlier agreed loan package.
	   The IMF put the dlrs 4.8 billion loan on hold following the
previous government's decision to devalue the ruble and reschedule
domestic debt _ the very moves that the international aid package
was intended to avoid.
	   The IMF and other international lenders have made it clear that
next loans could be granted only after Russia comes up with a sound
economic program to strengthen the ruble, ease the banking crisis
and solve the debts owed on treasury bills.
	   Although the outcome of the talks with lenders remains
uncertain, the government has already stated that foreign loans
will be a chief source of revenue to cover a huge deficit in the
fourth quarter.
	   Primakov last week strongly urged the IMF and other lenders to
deliver aid and warned that their refusal would push Russia toward
``unpopular'' decisions, which he did not spell out.
	   With Russian tax collection chronically below target, the IMF's
refusal to give credits would mean that the government would have
to pay for a huge deficit nearing 100 billion rubles (dlrs 6
billion) by printing new money _ a move certain to trigger high
inflation.

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Hours before China was expected to sign a key
U.N. human rights treaty and host British Prime Minister Tony
Blair, police hauled a prominent human rights campaigner in for
questioning Monday.
	   Qin Yongmin's latest run-in with the authorities came as he
tried for the second time in a week to legally register a human
rights monitoring group. Qin said a civil affairs official in the
Hubei provincial capital of Wuhan accused him of engaging in
illegal activities. The police came soon after he returned home.
	   ``As I'm sending this statement, the Wuhan Public Security
Bureau is again taking me away,'' Qin said in a hastily scrawled
message on the bottom of the typed statement faxed to reporters.
	   Qin, detained briefly two weeks ago, was questioned for about
three hours before being released and threatened with prosecution
if he persisted in trying to set up his China Human Rights
Observer.
	   Qin hoped the harassment would stop after China signs the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, but he said
if local authorities don't observe the treaty ``we will
unswervingly push ahead with protecting human rights to the last.''
	   China plans to sign the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights on Monday at the United Nations. By the time the
ink is dry, Blair should be landing in Beijing on Tuesday morning
for the first visit by a British prime minister in seven years.
	   The treaty is supposed to guarantee freedoms of speech and
assembly. But even after China signs, the treaty would not come
into force until ratified by the legislature, which may attach
reservations effectively nullifying some provisions.
	   Blair has vowed to discuss differences over human rights with
Chinese leaders. His visit has drawn appeals from dissidents and an
international press freedom group urging him to persuade Chinese
leaders to free political prisoners.
	   In an open letter, three dissident said that while Chinese
leaders say they respect human rights principles, in law and
practice the government allows rights abuses and persecution of
dissidents.
	   Thousands of political prisoners are believed to remain in
Chinese prisons, labor camps or detention centers, said the letter,
a copy of which was released by the Hong Kong-based Information
Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China.
	   The letter called for the release of Shi Binhai, a journalist
who compiled a popular book on political change; Fang Jue, a
businessman who called openly for political reform; and other
imprisoned activists.
	   Paris-based Reporters Without Borders urged Blair to call for
the release of Gao Yu, Liu Xiaobo and Liu Jingsheng.
	   The three are among 13 journalists imprisoned ``simply for
attempting to practice their profession,'' it said in a statement.

	   On Sunday, Milosevic met with Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov and Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, Serbian President Milan
Milutinovic and Yugoslavia's top defense officials.
	   The Russians are against using NATO force in Kosovo. However,
Ivanov and Sergeyev said the airstrikes could occur ``if decisive
measures are not immediately taken for a radical improvement of the
situation,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin told the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   To avoid such an attack, Yugoslavia must end the hostilities,
withdraw army and security forces, take urgent measures to overcome
the humanitarian crisis, ensure that refugees can return home and
take part in peace talks, he said.

South Korea pushes for agreement on free economic zone
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A South Korean diplomat called Monday for Russia
and South Korea to sign a stalled agreement on a joint industrial
area in Russia's Far East, a news agency said.
	   Suk Won Tae, the Korean Consul-General in the Pacific port city
of Vladivostok, said Korea wants an agreement on a free economic
zone in the region to be signed as soon as possible, the ITAR-Tass
news agency said.
	   The zone agreement would offer tax and tariff concessions to
more than 100 South Korean light-industry enterprises who set up in
the 320-hectare (790-acre) area in Nakhodka, near Vladivostok.
	   The firms would deal mostly in textile, timber-processing, and
cannery operations, officials say.
	   The original agreement to jointly build the dlrs 160 million
complex in the zone was part of a 1992 summit agreement, but
financial problems in Russia and South Korea have delayed its
development.

Iran offers to mediate between Syria, Turkey
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Turkey-Kurdish Rebels &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran has offered to mediate between Syria
and Turkey in the deepening dispute over Kurdish rebel bases and
plans to dispatch envoys to the two countries, the Tehran Times
reported Monday.
	   Egypt already has launched a mediation effort to try to prevent
a military confrontation over Turkish allegations that Syria is
harboring Turkish Kurdish rebels.
	   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak held talks Sunday with Syrian
President Hafez Assad in Damascus and was expected to visit Turkey
later this week.
	   Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi made the offer of
mediation in a telephone conversation with his Syrian counterpart,
Farouk al-Sharaa, on Sunday, said the paper, which is close to the
Foreign Ministry.
	   It did not say when Iran planned to send its emissaries.
	   Tensions between Turkey and Syria, Iran's closest Arab ally,
have escalated in recent days.
	   Ankara has sent troops to its border with Syria, prompting fears
of an attack. There have been unconfirmed reports of Turkish jets
violating Syria airspace near the border.
	   Turkish President Suleyman Demirel warned Damascus on Sunday
that Turkey would not allow its neighbor to continue sheltering
Kurdish rebels. Syria denies the allegation.
	   Turkey long has accused Syria of providing refuge to Kurdish
rebels, who have been fighting since 1984 for more autonomy for the
Kurdish population in southeastern Turkey.
	   For its part, Syria has accused Turkey of forming military
alliances with Israel that threaten Arab security and undermine
Syria's bargaining position in peace talks with the Jewish state.
	   Turkey's military alliance with Israel has been condemned by
Iran.
	   Syria also has accused Turkey of threatening its supply of water
by building dams on the Euphrates River.

Sudanese warplane bombs northeastern Uganda

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ A Sudanese warplane bombed two towns in
northwestern Uganda, wounding six people, Ugandan and aid officials
said Monday.
	   The target appeared to be Sudanese refugees, said Nino Tomoko,
spokeswoman for the U.N. refugee agency. About 158,756 refugees
from Sudan's 15-year civil war are in more than two dozen
settlements in the area.
	   An Antonov dropped six bombs on Pakele and four on Adjumani on
Saturday evening, wounding four women and two children, and
destroying two huts, said Steven Kavuma, state minister for
defense.
	   ``The government of Uganda condemns this act of aggression,''
Kavuma said of the attacks on the towns 350 kilometers (220 miles)
northwest of Kampala.
	   In Khartoum, the government denied Sudan had bombed Uganda.
``This is not true, and they have to provide the evidence,'' said
Hassan Abdin, permanent secretary in the Sudanese Foreign Ministry.
	   The bombs fell outside the compounds of the U.N. World Food
Program and U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, WFP spokeswoman
Michele Quintaglie said in Nairobi, Kenya.
	   ``Our compounds are the most heavily lit buildings in the
area,'' making them good targets, she said.
	   Uganda has several times in the past accused Sudan of bombings
in the north, including in February 1997 when eight civilians were
injured in Moyo.
	   In Khartoum, state-run newspapers said that 98 Eritrean soldiers
were killed in fighting in East Equatoria province in southern
Sudan since mid-September.
	   There was no way to verify the claim independently.
	   Sudan has charged repeatedly that both Eritrea and Uganda were
supporting the latest offensive by the rebel Sudan People's
Liberation Army. Both countries have denied the allegations.
	   The Sudanese media said that an estimated 600 Eritreans
currently were fighting inside Sudan.
	   It said that among those killed was an Eritrean officer,
identified as Omar Tashombi, who commanded artillery units. He was
killed when a rebel howitzer was destroyed the reports said,
without elaboration.
	   Uganda broke diplomatic relations with Sudan in 1995 after both
sides accused the other of supporting rebel groups.
	   Sudanese rebels, drawing support from Christians and followers
of tribal religions, have been waging a military campaign against
the Islamic-led Sudanese government since 1983 for more autonomy
for the southern districts.
	   About 1.5 million people have been killed in the fighting and
resulting famines.

Former communists may enter east German state government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SCHWERIN, Germany (AP) _ The head of the Social Democrats said
in an interview published Monday that his party colleagues in
eastern Germany should bring the ex-communists into a state
government to make them more responsible.
	   Social Democratic chairman Oskar Lafontaine and other party
leaders have ruled out working with the successor to the East
German communists on the federal level because of its past.
	   But even Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder has softened his
stance about cooperation on the state level, saying recently that
the ``different conditions'' in the east made such a coalition
possible.
	   Lafontaine told Der Spiegel newsmagazine it would also take some
of the shine off the ex-communists and their assertion ``that they
would do everything much better, if only they were allowed to.''
	   ``I think it's wrong to allow the (former communists) to escape
responsibility for government,'' he said. ``That just gives them
the opportunity to demand everything and have to answer for
nothing.''
	   The Social Democrats finished on top in state elections in
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania on Sept. 27, but must form a
coalition to achieve a majority in parliament.
	   Governor-elect Harald Ringstorff has been talking both with the
Christian Democrats, which headed the last coalition but finished
second this time, and the Party of Democratic Socialism, successor
to the East German communists and third strongest party.
	   The Social Democrats have governed in another eastern German
state, Saxony-Anhalt, since spring with the tacit support of the
PDS, but the party has never officially been part of a coalition
government.

Russia must increase use of nuclear power, minister says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's top atomic energy official called Monday
for the country to increase its reliance on nuclear power, a news
report said.
	   Atomic Energy Minister Yevgeny Adamov said nuclear power should
provide 30 to 40 percent of Russia's energy needs, up from its
present 12 percent, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   ``Nuclear power engineering has advantages over the traditional
energy production methods and they should be used,'' he said at an
international conference on nuclear fuel held outside Moscow.
	   Russia already has nine nuclear power plants with 29 reactors,
as well as dozens of research reactors. Environmentalists have
warned that the risk of nuclear accidents is high at deteriorating
and underfunded facilities throughout the country.
	   Adamov also suggested that the Russian nuclear industry export
program be revived to increase its revenues, the report said.
Western countries, led by the United States, have tried to convince
Russia not to sell its nuclear technology abroad.
	   Fuel is also a problem. Three of the nine plants have only
enough fuel for a week, Yevgeny Ignatenko, president of the
state-run Rosenergoatom company that runs Russia's nuclear plants,
said Monday.
	   Rosenergoatom owes 15 billion rubles (dlrs 937 million) to its
suppliers, while electricity users owe the company 18 billion
rubles (dlrs 1.1 million), the ITAR-Tass news agency quoted
Ignatenko as saying.
	   In other nuclear news, the Leningrad nuclear power plant is
overhauling one of its reactors in a dlrs 300 million operation to
extend its service life and make it safer, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported Monday.
	   The plant in Sosnovy Bor, near St. Petersburg, has already shut
down its fourth reactor and begun preparations to upgrade it. The
operation is expected to take up to a year and a half, though may
take longer for lack of funds, director Yuri Garusov said.

Seven doomsday cult members believed to commit suicide
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Seven doomsday cult members were found
burned to death Monday in a suspected self-immolation ritual,
police said.
	   The seven, identified by police as members of the Youngsang
(everlasting life) Church, were found burned beyond recognition in
a mini-van on the east coast.
	   ``It appears to be a religious suicide pact,'' Kim Bong-yon, a
senior police investigator, said on MBC-TV.
	   Police, quoting relatives, said the doomsday cult leader, Woo
Jong-min, 57, left his home in Seoul in July with six followers,
saying that they were embarking on an everlasting journey.
	   The cult teaches its followers that when they die, they will
live a new, happy life in heaven, police said.

 &UR; EDS: RECASTS to UPDATE with closing figures

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets closed lower Monday on
fears of a global recession despite signs over the weekend that the
Group of Seven industrial countries were moving more aggressively
to jump-start the world economy.
	   Share prices slumped 4 percent in Hong Kong. In Tokyo, the
benchmark Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues shed 275.57
points, or 2.08 percent, to close at 12,948.12.
	   The last time the Nikkei closed below the psychologically
important 13,000 mark was on Jan. 30, 1986, when it finished at
12,949.04.
	   At a meeting in Washington, the Group of Seven urged Japan to
take ``swift and effective action'' to strengthen its financial
system, including the prompt enactment of measures to support
viable banks with public assistance.
	   The United States also proposed at the weekend that the
International Monetary Fund set up an emergency lending fund, while
Japan unveiled a plan to spend U.S. dlrs 30 billion to assist five
crisis-hit Asian nations over the next two years.
	   But dealers said they were skeptical if the proposals would lead
to a turnaround in the region's economic woes. Traders warned
Asia's outlook would remain uncertain until Japan's ruling and
opposition parties agree on how to strengthen its ailing financial
system.
	   Meanwhile, the Japanese yen weakened on disappointment that
officials at the G-7 meeting failed to issue a more concrete
statement about what should be done to fix Japan's debt-ridden
banking sector and revitalize its recession-bound economy.
	   The U.S. dollar was quoted at 135.76 yen in late-afternoon
trading, up 0.98 yen from late Friday in Tokyo and above its New
York level of 135.65 yen on Friday.
	   In Hong Kong, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index fell 318.92 points
to close at 7,564.54.
	   Brokers said share prices fell on concerns over the banking
sector following the bailout of Long Term Capital Management, a
U.S. hedge fund.
	   They said several U.S. and European banks are now disclosing
losses on loans to the hedge fund.
	   Philippine shares also closed sharply lower, dragged down by
concerns over the prospects of a possible increase in domestic
interest rates. The Philippine Stock Exchange index of 30 selected
stocks fell 29.08 points, or 2.4 percent, to 1,166.54.
	   The markets were closed in Taiwan and South Korea for holidays.
	   BANGKOK: Thai share prices closed sharply lower. The Stock
Exchange of Thailand index fell 5.30 points, or 2.1 percent, to
246.26.
	   SINGAPORE: Shares closed lower on worries over a global
recession. The benchmark Straits Times Index slumped 1.8 percent,
or or 16.13 points, to 883.86.
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian shares closed lower on continuing
concern over the upcoming trial of ousted deputy prime minister
Anwar Ibrahim. The benchmark Composite Index fell 2.96 points, or
0.8 percent, to 360.10.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed higher, with the key
index rising on the back of a few key stocks. The NZSE-40 Capital
Index rose 23.91 points, or 1.4 percent, to 1,692.15.
	   SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed broadly lower in the
first session after election Saturday when the incumbent
Liberal-National coalition government was elected for another
3-year term. The All Ordinaries Index fell 16.6 points, or 0.6
percent, to 2,515.7.
	   JAKARTA: Share prices closed lower. The Composite Index fell
1.91 points, or 0.7 percent, to 261.31.

Philippine inflation dips to 10 percent in September
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES and RECASTS throughout with analyst comments

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A slowdown in price increases for
food and most other commodities led to lower-than-expected
inflation in the Philippines in September, with economists
forecasting further declines in coming months.
	   The government announced Monday that inflation was 10 percent in
September on a year-to-year basis, following a 10.5 percent rise in
August.
	   For the nine months through September, inflation averaged 9.4
percent, below the government's projection of 10 percent for the
year.
	   The September inflation data reflected a notable slowdown in
food prices, which account for about half the consumer price index.
All other commodity groups, except fuel, light and water, showed
similar slowdowns.
	   Economists say the steady drop in inflation since June shows
that a drought attributed to the El Nino weather disturbance in the
first half of the year is no longer affecting consumer prices.
	   The decline also reflects a recent slowdown in economic growth,
economists say.
	   ``The economy is weakening, so there isn't any unusual demand
for any commodity group,'' said Luz Lorenzo, research head at ATR
Securities Inc.
	   The country's gross national product shrank by 0.7 percent in
the second quarter of the year, after expanding by 2.0 percent in
the first three months.
	   High interest rates, which have caused business activity to
slow, and the ongoing regional financial crisis remain the main
causes of the economic contraction, economists say.
	   Prime lending rates _ currently at 15 percent to 21 percent _
rose sharply after the regional financial crisis began in July
1997. In the third quarter of last year, prime lending rates rose
as high as 35 percent.
	   Before the currency crisis, banks' prime lending rates averaged
13 percent.

Palestinians: Only Israeli movement can bring about accord

<TEXT>
	   JERICHO, West Bank (AP) _ On the eve of U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright's arrival, a top Palestinian official said
without Israeli concessions, her latest peace efforts ``won't go
anywhere.''
	   Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, speaking to Associated Press
Television News in the West Bank town of Jericho, also accused the
Clinton administration of allowing Israel to drag its feet on
living up to past accords.
	   ``I hope Madame Albright will end this cycle _ meeting and
arranging other meetings, giving (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin)
Netanyahu the extra miles _ because this must stop and we must move
to substance,'' he told APTN.
	   ``We believe that without a clear-cut Netanyahu `yes' to the
American initiative and all its components, I think we won't go
anywhere,'' Erekat said.
	   The Palestinians earlier this year accepted terms of an
American-authored plan for an Israeli troop pullback in the West
Bank, but Netanyahu balked, citing security concerns. Talks in the
United States last week apparently brought the two sides closer
together, however.
	   Albright was to meet Tuesday _ separately _ with Netanyahu and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. Her visit is meant to lay the
groundwork for an Israeli-Palestinian summit in Washington sometime
around Oct. 15.
	   Albright was to spend only two days in the region, but was
accompanied by mediator Dennis Ross, who will likely stay longer to
try to coax the two sides as close to an accord as possible before
any summit.
	   Israeli officials had no immediate comment on Erekat's remarks.
Much of the country was shut down for the Jewish holiday of Sukkot,
which lasts for one week, but main commemorations were Monday.
	   However, Netanyahu has consistently said that no deal is
possible without better security cooperation from Arafat's
Palestinian Authority. The Palestinians say even diligent efforts
cannot provide total protection against attacks on Israel by
Islamic militants.

 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Man accused of killing relative for water after
hurricane &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PONCE, Puerto Rico (AP) _ A man killed his brother-in-law during
a fight over containers of water in hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico,
police reported Sunday.
	   They charged Elvin Figueroa Santiago, 33, with stabbing Carlos
Velez Rivera, 45, Friday night in Velez Rivera's house in the
southern city of Juana Diaz.
	   Most of Juana Diaz has been without running water and
electricity since the eye of Hurricane George passed overhead on
Sept. 21. Government trucks have been dispensing water to
residents.
	   The only witness to the stabbing, Velez's wife and Figueroa's
sister, told investigators the two men were arguing over possession
of containers of water, according to police Col. Hector Luis
Rodriguez.
	   Figueroa was jailed in nearby Ponce on Saturday.
 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Officials issue 200 fines for price gouging after
hurricane
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Inspectors have issued about 200
fines against Puerto Rican businesses for price gouging in the wake
of Hurricane Georges, the island's top consumer protection official
said.
	   Stores were ticketed for raising prices on items ranging from
milk to batteries, said Jose Alicea Rivera, Puerto Rican Consumer
Affairs Secretary.
	   Under Puerto Rican law, the government can freeze the prices on
staple foods, ice, candles, plywood, lanterns, electric generators
and other ``goods of basic necessity'' when a hurricane strike is
imminent. Fines range from dlrs 50 to dlrs 1000 or more.
	   The freeze called before Hurricane Georges hit Puerto Rico on
Sept. 21 will remain in effect ``as long as the period of
recuperation from the emergency lasts,'' Alicea said.
 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Agency reports 62,000 damage claims so far
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ The Federal Emergency Management
Agency has received 62,000 damage claims in Puerto Rico since
Hurricane Georges hit Sept. 21, making it one of the costliest
disasters ever for the island.
	   About 53,500 claims had been filed by telephone by Sunday, and
another 8500 were received in the first two days at application
centers around the island, said Ed Conly, a public affairs officer
for the agency.
	   At that rate, the total number of claims could eventually
eclipse those of Hurricane Hugo in 1989 or Hortense in 1996, Conly
said.
	   ``The impact of this event is huge,'' Conly said. ``This is
going to be a lot larger disaster than Hortense and it's going to
be a lot larger than Hugo.''
	   When the first of the 14 application centers opened Saturday,
thousands waited for hours in a baking sun to file claims. Inside
the centers, some complained that there were not enough
Spanish-speaking workers to handle the crush.
	   Conly said the agency had switched to giving out appointments in
order to shorten lines and was scrambling to hire temporary workers
to handle the workload.
 &UR; JAMAICA: Opposition dislikes appointment of new army chief
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Jamaica's main opposition party is
challenging the appointment of the army's new chief because of his
role during a controversial raid in inner-city Kingston in May
1997.
	   The Jamaica Labor Party said Prime Minister P.J. Patterson's
appointment of Col. John Simmonds, 52, to chief of staff of the
Jamaica Defense Force could ignite more unrest.
	   Simmonds was acting head of the army when police and troops
occupied Tivoli Gardens, a Labor Party stronghold, to quell
politically-linked gang violence. Four people were killed during
the shooting and several others were injured.
	   ``The JLP does not accept Col. John Simmonds as a fit person to
lead the JDF when people and stability are the highest priorities
on the national agenda,'' the party said in a written statement.
	   At the time of the raid, Simmonds denied witnesses' reports that
shots were fired from military helicopters. A later investigation
showed a police officer on one of the helicopters had fired an
assault rifle into the neighborhood, but that they were not the
shots that killed the four people.
 &UR; SPAIN: Jimmy Carter calls on Spain to counter U.S. policy in Cuba
	   SANTANDER, Spain (AP) _ Former President Jimmy Carter on
Saturday urged Spain to ``help correct the mistake that is U.S.
policy towards Cuba'' by investing in the Caribbean island, a news
agency reported.
	   In a lecture delivered in Spanish in this northern city, Carter
said ``through investment, visits, inspiration and example, we
should find a way to alleviate the suffering of the Cuban people
and help them find a route towards liberty and democracy,'' the
private Europa Press said.
	   Carter has criticized the 36-year-old U.S. trade embargo against
Cuba before, on grounds it allows Cuban leader Fidel Castro to
portray himself as a martyr.
	   Spanish companies have considerable investment in Cuba,
particularly in the tourist industry.
	   During his talk, given at the invitation of a local savings
bank, Carter also stressed the cultural links between Spain and its
former Latin American colonies, which, he said, should aid economic
cooperation, the agency reported.

Malaysian prime minister says nation's economy is strong
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad said Monday that fixing the local currency's exchange rate
to the U.S. dollar has given businesses stability while ensuring
competitiveness.
	   ``Our economy is the most stable in Asia, and traders can do
business with greater certainty,'' he told a business forum.
	   Malaysia remains in recession, however, and on Monday the
central bank again lowered the rate at which it lends to financial
institutions. It was an attempt by Bank Negara Malaysia to spur
lending.
	   Mahathir bemoaned the loss of 600 billion ringgit (dlrs 157
billion) in market capitalization in the past 20 months and
repeated his criticisms that short-term foreign buying and selling
can set up emerging markets for dramatic falls.
	   ``We can do without the dubious benefit of foreign direct
investment in the stock market,'' Mahathir told the Japanese
Departmental Store Association.
	   Sweeping capital controls introduced in the beginning of
September included: the fixed ringgit exchange rate, a ban on
trading of the Malaysian currency and stocks outside the country,
and restrictions that went into effect Oct. 1 on how much local and
foreign currency travelers can take with them.
	   The measures have insulated Malaysia for the time being from
foreign speculation but have frightened away the long-term
investment in manufacturing and technology that Mahathir wants.
	   Mahathir said the ringgit peg of 3.8 to the U.S. dollar would
not be changed anytime soon.
	   ``Although the government is now in full control of the exchange
rate, we have not strengthened the ringgit too much,'' said
Mahathir, who also took the title of finance minister when he fired
Anwar Ibrahim on Sept. 2. He promised no ``sudden and extreme
fluctuations.''
	   In Washington, Malaysia's Deputy Finance Minister Mustapa
Mohamed said the controls were neither permanent nor a substitute
for sound macroeconomic and financial policies, according to a
report by the national news agency, Bernama.
	   They will provide some breathing space for structural
readjustment, he told a World Bank seminar on the Malaysian
controls.
	   ``Give us a chance,'' Mustapa was quoted as saying. ``What's
important is the result.''
	   Shares were mixed on the key Composite Index on Monday, with
declines outnumbering advances, as condemnation of Anwar's injuries
in police custody pour in from governments as well as the World
Bank, International Monetary Fund and United Nations.
	   The Bernama news agency reported Monday that Malaysia is
expected to receive a dlrs 2 billion loan as part of Japan's dlrs
30 billion aid package to stabilize the battered economies of South
Korea and four Southeast Asian countries.

U.S. envoy Holbrooke says Kosovo situation as bad as two weeks ago
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details, ADDS byline
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke
said Monday the military situation in Kosovo remains critical
despite a lull in fighting and the removal of some Yugoslav tanks
and troops from the battlefield.
	   Speaking after a meeting with NATO Secretary General Javier
Solana and Supreme Allied Commander Europe Wesley K. Clark,
Holbrooke said ``while the level of fighting (in Kosovo) may have
abated temporarily, the capacity for its resumption is there.''
	   ``The situation therefore remains fully as serious today as it
was a week or two ago,'' he told reporters before flying to
Belgrade.
	   He said Solana and Clark told him that ``significant military
forces, regular forces and military uniformed police, remain in
Kosovo.''
	   Holbrooke was told NATO preparations to launch military action
against Yugoslavia continued unabated and would become inevitable
unless Milosevic takes decisive action soon.
	   ``At NATO, the planning for military action is serious, intense
and sustained,'' he said.
	   NATO has approved an ``activation request'' for the 16 allied
nations to formally commit warplanes and other forces for an
eventual air campaign.
	   However, the NATO Council, made up of ambassadors from the
allied nations, have come no closer to taking a political decision
to launch air raids and failed to overcome differences over whether
the alliance needs a clearer U.N. mandate before it can attack.
	   The political decision is expected to come closer after U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan presents a report on Kosovo to the
Security Council on Monday.
	   Annan is expected to indicate whether the Serbs are complying
with last week's Security Council resolution, which urges a
ceasefire and threatens to consider further action if fighting
continues.

Earthquake jolts Iranian province
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ An earthquake with a 5.3 magnitude rocked
several towns in western Iran on Monday, damaging houses but
causing no deaths, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
	   The quake damaged at least 100 houses in the town of Darreh
Shahr and surrounding villages in Ilam province, the agency said.
It was the second quake to hit the town in less than 24 hours.
	   On Sunday, Darreh Shahr was jolted by a 4.8 magnitude quake, it
said.
	   Also Monday, two tremors with magnitudes of 3.2 and 3.3 jolted
the town of Sisakht in the southwestern Kohkiloyeh-Boyerahmad
province, the agency reported. There were no reports of casualties.
	   A 5.3 magnitude earthquake can cause considerable damage in
populated areas, while a quake with a magnitude of about 3 is the
smallest generally felt by people.
	   Iran is prone to earthquakes and experiences thousands of small
tremors every year.

Social Dems' Persson pressed to indicate how he plans to govern
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ The main opposition group wants Prime
Minister Goran Persson to explain how the ruling Social Democrats
plan to govern the next four years after last month's desultory
election results.
	   ``It's morally wrong that the losers of the elections rule on,''
Anders Bjoerk of the conservative Moderate Party said Monday.
	   On Sept. 20, the Social Democrats won 36.6 percent of the vote _
more than any other party, but nevertheless their worst showing in
decades and far below the 45 percent they tallied in 1994.
	   The Moderates polled 22.5 percent, and the four non-socialist
parties received a total of 169 seats in the 349-seat Riksdag
parliament. That's more than the Social Democrats' 131 seats, but
six short of a majority.
	   The issue is how _ or whether _ the Social Democrats would
cooperate poltically with the ex-Communist Left Party and the
Greens.
	   When parliament resumes Tuesday, Persson was scheduled to
outline the Social Democrats' projected policies during the next
four years.
	   The Moderates were considering raising a formal challenge to
test how strong parliamentary support is for the government.
	   A challenge requires the support of just 35 members in the
Riksdag, but a majority would be needed to topple the government.
That has never happened in Swedish politics.

A dozen police officers charged with armed robbery in 1998
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Twelve police officers have been charged
with armed robbery this year, but the force is determined to weed
out criminals in its ranks, a senior officer said Monday.
	   ``When you are talking about thousands of policemen, the
percentage is very small,'' Otieno Osur, deputy commissioner of
police in charge of operations, told a news conference.
	   Osur said Police Commissioner Duncan Wachira has ordered all
provincial commanders ``to decisively deal with any officer who is
involved in any form of crime.''
	   ``Police officers, like any other Kenyans, are bound by the
law,'' Osur said. ``It is, therefore, imperative that they observe
this law.''
	   Complaints are on the rise that police officers either carry out
armed robberies themselves or rent out their service weapons to
criminals.
	   Osur said every organization has its bad elements but said he is
satisfied the majority of Kenyan officers were doing a good job.
	   On Saturday, Osur released figures for a 10-year period from
1988 that he said showed a decline in overall crime, but an
increase in murder, rape and car-jacking.
	   He also said police have seized 1,635 illegal fire arms and
20,886 rounds of ammunition since 1995.
	   Illegal weapons easily obtained in neighboring countries beset
by civil stife are used in robberies, cattle rustling and general
banditry.
	   Osur said gun-trading in northeastern Kenya was common.
	   The region borders Somalia, which has had no central government
since the 1991 ouster of the late dictator Mohamed Siad Barre when
the country split into fiefdoms protected by armed clan-based
militias.

Plunky plungee claims world record for building bungee jump
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS that world record claim cannot be verified because
Guiness doesn't recognize bungee jump records. Fixes distance of
plunge to 591 feet.
 &UR; AP Photo AUCK101 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ Using only a rubber bungee cord and
two steel guide cables, A.J. Hackett dove off Auckland's highest
building Monday, plunging 591 feet (180 meters) and claiming to set
a world record.
	   Traffic halted in the central city as crowds gathered to watch
Hackett's 8-second jump from the Sky Tower casino that was also
broadcast live to a national TV audience.
	   Hackett, a New Zealand entrepreneur and promoter credited with
popularizing the extreme sport, said he set a record for a bungee
jump from a building. The Guinness Book of World Records does not
recognize bungee jumps because of their danger.
	   For the nighttime jump, Hackett used a rubber bungee along with
two steel guide cables to prevent himself from bouncing or drifting
into the building.
	   ``That (system) keeps me in a nice little slot all the way
down,'' Hackett said before the jump. ``They work beautifully.''
	   In fact the rings on the steel cables slowed his take-off,
causing Hackett to curl out shortly after leaving the jump point,
before plunging headlong to within yards (meters) of the ground. A
thrilled crowd shouted and whistled as he jumped, and as the bungee
cord ended his plunge just above them.
	   He punched his fists into a bunch of yellow balloons as the
bungee tightened, halting his fall.
	   On the ground, he told a television reporter: ``It was certainly
rocking tonight. Something weird happened up the top there but we
got it under control halfway down. There was nothing that could go
wrong.
	   ``You accelerate very fast off the top and then coming down into
the bottom going like mad and I could feel the bungee coming on,
and yeah, the brakes are working, great.''
	   Hackett jumped 377 feet (114 meters) from the Eiffel Tower in
Paris 12 years ago.
	   ``You get a fair bit of adrenalin pumping round your body, which
is fairly nice,'' he said.
	   Television New Zealand dedicated 30 minutes of prime-time
television to the jump and a website broadcast it live on the
Internet.
	   Among bigger bungee jumps are one of nearly 3,300 feet (one km)
from a helicopter, and one of 700 feet (200 meters) off a dam in
the 1995 James Bond movie ``Goldeneye.''
	   Bungee jumping is a modernization of a traditional Vanuatu
tribal test of courage in which villagers plunge headfirst from
high platforms with vines tied to their ankles to break their fall
at the last moment _ they hope.

Sales of cholesterol-blocking margarine swells company's profit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Raisio Group increased its eight-month
pretax profit this year by more than 15 percent, to 192 million
markkaa (dlrs 37.6 million), mainly due to sales of its
cholesterol-blocking margarine, the company said Monday.
	   Net sales from January to August also increased, to 3.4 billion
markkaa (dlrs 658 million), from 3.2 billion markkaa during the
same period last year.
	   The operating profit of the Benecol division, which makes the
cholesterol-blocking bread spread, more than tripled to 140 million
markkaa (dlrs 27.5 million), up from 37 million markkaa in 1997.
	   Raisio, one of Finland's largest food, animal feed and chemical
groups, is best known for Benecol that inhibits the absorption of
the health-threatening form of cholesterol.
	   It introduced Benecol in 1995, but sales of the margarine had
been limited to Finland for more than two years due to a shortage
of the key raw material, plant sterol, a fat-soluble plant alcohol.
	   Now, the company is increasing the production of plant sterol at
Raisio, and plans to build a factory near Charleston, South
Carolina, to manufacture the heart-friendly margarine's key
ingredient. The plant is expected to be ready in early 1999.
	   Last year, Raisio increased its pretax profit by 25 percent to
208.5 million markkaa (dlrs 40.8 million), and net sales grew to
4.9 billion markkaa (dlrs 960 million).
	   The company employs 2,880 people in 14 countries.

Foreign Office says British company ignored warnings over Chechnya

	   LONDON (AP) _ A Foreign Office minister said Monday that the
British phone company whose four employees were kidnapped in
Chechnya at the weekend was specifically warned to withdraw from
Russia's breakaway region, but ignored the advice.
	   ``The advice could not have been clearer, the risks were known
to the company and to the employees,'' said Foreign Office Minister
Derek Fatchett in a British Broadcasting Corp. radio interview.
``The fact that they ignored that advice is a decision they took
themselves and is their responsibility ... It's a mature world and
people have to take mature decisions.''
	   The company, Granger Telecom, said it knew Chechnya was probably
the world's most dangerous place for kidnapping but thought its
staff would be well-protected because they were working on a
government contract to install a telecommunications system.
	   Three of the kidnaped men, Britons Darren Hickey and Rudolph
Petschi and New Zealander Stanley Shaw, worked for Granger. The
four hostage, Briton Peter Kennedy, may have been employed directly
by Chechen Telecom, the British company said.
	   The men were seized early Saturday after a shoot-out with their
bodyguards. There was no word on any ransom demand for the four
men.
	   ``We had a general advice from the Foreign Office about visits
to Chechnya but no specific advice about us,'' Granger Telecom
chief executive Ray Verth told the BBC.
	   Verth, who has now suspended operations in Chechnya, said the
company had considered the contract, worth several million dollars,
justified the risk. The company was 12 months into a five-year
contract to install 300,000 telephone lines across Chechnya..
	   Hickey had been in the region since early August and was due
back in Britain this week, said Verth. Shaw had been in Chechnya
only a week and Petschi for 2 1/2 weeks.

Schroeder backs German auto industry against ecologists
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder rallied
behind Germany's car industry in an interview published Monday,
heaping disdain on calls by the ecology-minded Greens party for a
speed limit on the autobahn.
	   Schroeder's warning to his likely junior partner _ not to attack
one of the biggest and most prestigious industries _ came as both
sides staked out stands for forming a government to replace
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's outgoing administration.
	   Schroeder, a Social Democrat, has a business-friendly reputation
and rejects some of the Greens' more radical environmental
positions. He sits on the supervisory board of Volkswagen, Europe's
biggest automaker, and has already rejected Greens demands for a
sharp hike in gasoline taxes.
	   He bristled at suggestions by Greens lawmaker Gila Altmann last
weekend that the new government might slap car-crazy Germans with a
speed limit of 120-130 kph (75-80 mph) on the autobahn
superhighways.
	   ``We haven't talked about that yet,'' Schroeder was quoted
Monday as telling the mass-circulation Bild newspaper. ``I can only
warn people against attacking the auto industry.
	   ``Industry growth isn't what it has been, and we are not going
to endanger jobs. We have entirely different worries.''
	   The autobahn currently has no general speed limit, and building
cars to handle those conditions is a selling point for German
automakers.
	   Greens and Social Democrats opened coalition talks Friday, but
bargaining over key sticking points such as foreign policy, energy
and the environment lie ahead over the next two weeks. Schroeder is
to be sworn in as chancellor on Oct. 27.
	   A Greens negotiator played down differences between the two
sides Monday.
	   Renate Kuenast, a party leader in Berlin, suggested the Greens
may have to compromise on their platform's call for immediate steps
toward scrapping nuclear energy.
	   A ``sledgehammer approach'' would result in long legal battles
with the power industry, she said on ZDF television.
	   ``We understand that we are the government now, not the
opposition,'' she said. ``We don't want to ride attacks against
anyone.''

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Kazakstan's prime minister urged U.S.-based
Phillips Petroleum Co. to speed up construction of a dlrs 500
million gas liquefaction plant so the country won't need to import
so much gas, a news agency reported Monday.
	   Kazakstan annually imports about 1 million tons (1.1 million
short tons) of liquefied gas from Russia and Uzbekistan, the
Interfax news agency quoted Prime Minister Nurlan Balgimbayev as
saying.
	   Phillips Petroleum and the Kazak government signed an agreement
last month on oil and gas exploration in Kazakstan's section of the
Caspian Sea and on building the gas plant.
	   Balgimbayev said the drilling of Kazakstan's first gas well in
the Caspian would begin this year unless the winter is unusually
severe.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1100 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets closed lower Monday on
fears of a global recession despite signs over the weekend that the
Group of Seven industrial countries were moving to jump-start the
world economy. Share prices slumped 4 percent in Hong Kong. In
Tokyo, the benchmark Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues
shed 275.57 points, or 2.08 percent, to close at 12,948.12. The
last time the Nikkei closed below the psychologically important
13,000 mark was in 1986. At a Washington meeting, the group urged
Japan to take ``swift and effective action'' to strengthen its
financial system. But the Japanese yen weakened on disappointment
that officials at the G-7 meeting failed to issue a more concrete
statement about what should be done to fix Japan's debt-ridden
banking sector and revitalize its recession-bound economy. The U.S.
dollar was quoted at 135.76 yen in late-afternoon trading, up 0.98
yen from late Friday in Tokyo. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The world's major economic powers strongly
agreed they face a deepening financial crisis, but two days of
discussion failed to resolve how to contain the problem. U.S.
President Bill Clinton, who has called the situation the worst
threat to the global economy in 50 years, planned to join the
debate Monday at a special conference of 22 rich and developing
countries. His administration was trying to demonstrate U.S.
resolve to calm turbulent markets at home and abroad even though
there is no clear agreement among the rich nations on what to do to
restore stability. The policy-making body of the International
Monetary Fund said Sunday night that the global economic outlook
has ``worsened considerably.'' The IMF's interim committee pledged
``concrete and rapid action'' to deal with the global economic
crisis but used vague language that indicated substantial
differences remain. (US-ECONOMIC CRISIS)
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian Prime Minister John Howard
says he will quickly ram his tax reforms through Parliament after a
narrow weekend re-election victory, despite senators who on Monday
pledged to thwart him. Howard's insistence on linking tax reforms
to a new 10 percent tax on all goods and services, including food,
was a millstone around the conservatives' necks in the campaign.
Voters re-elected them Saturday, but cut their majority in the
148-seat House of Representatives from 91 to a probable 78,
according to current vote counting, which is continuing in
undecided districts. The main opposition Labor Party led by Kim
Beazley boosted its seats from 49 to a probable 69. Despite the
revolt against the government, based almost solely on opposition to
the proposed tax, Howard said he would like the tax passed as soon
as possible. The Democrats, a third party that holds the balance of
power in the Senate, say they will bottle up the tax changes.
(AUSTRALIA-ELECTION)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's government continued to push Monday for
foreign aid to rescue the tattered economy after a top official
said modernizing the country's nuclear missile force was a top
priority. Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's government is still
trying to come up with a strategy to deal with the country's
economic crisis after Russian currency and financial markets
collapsed in August. International financial institutions are
reluctant to resume loans until the government unveils its economic
strategy. First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov, a former top
Soviet economic official, said that in addition to dealing with the
crisis, the government must pursue long-term goals, such as
modernizing its aging nuclear arsenal. Primakov and Maslyukov have
insisted possible plans to reduce free economic activity were just
one of many options under consideration. Leaks in the Russian media
that the new government would roll back market reforms have worried
Russian and foreign business leaders.(RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai
announced a new Cabinet lineup Monday that he hopes will stabilize
his shaky coalition government and strengthen efforts to battle the
economic crisis. Chuan's new Cabinet includes members of the Chart
Pattana Party, formerly the second largest opposition party, which
agreed to join the coalition last week. That should make it easier
for the coalition to push its economic reform package through
parliament. Despite the reshuffle, Chuan's new Cabinet still has
his top technocrats Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda as finance minister and
Supachai Panichpakdi as commerce minister. Some analysts wonder if
Chart Pattana will ultimately destabilize the government, as it was
accused of doing to the government that fell in November.

have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The United States and Russia are
ratcheting up the pressure on President Slobodan Milosevic, warning
that NATO airstrikes are inevitable unless he takes decisive action
soon to end the humanitarian crisis in Kosovo. Fearing airstrikes,
Yugoslav generals put the nation's air defense on high alert, but
tried a belated compromise by moving some tanks and other heavy
equipment out of Kosovo. NATO members are also waiting for Monday's
report by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on the province in
Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic, where government forces are
trying to crush an independence movement by the ethnic Albanian
majority. In Brussels, Belgium, U.S. special envoy Richard
Holbrooke, who negotiated the Bosnian peace accords, said Monday
that the situation has not improved. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO, UN-KOSOVO)
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's charismatic politician
Anwar Ibrahim, who was arrested last month, was denied bail Monday
and ordered to face trial on four corruption charges. A visibly
thinner Anwar appeared in court wearing a neck brace for injuries
he has said were sustained in a police beating after his Sept. 20
arrest. He pleaded innocent to 10 charges of corruption and illegal
homosexual acts. ``I've been treated worse than any other
criminal,'' he said. Turning to reporters, he tugged at his
trousers to show his weight loss. Anwar, 51, was deputy prime
minister until he clashed with Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad in
September over economic policy as Malaysia sank into recession.
(MALAYSIA-POLITICS)
	   WASHINGTON _ The House Judiciary Committee meets Monday to take
up a Republican resolution recommending an open-ended inquiry into
whether President Bill Clinton's behavior merits impeachment. After
lawmakers explain their constitutional duty and staff lawyers
review the evidence, the House Judiciary Committee plans to pass a
Republican resolution to start an impeachment investigation. The
hearing that begins Monday, and could take two days, ends the
review of evidence submitted by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr.
The committee's formal mission at the hearing was described in
simple terms Sunday by Republican Chairman Henry Hyde: ``Is there
enough to go forward, or should we shut it down?''
(US-CLINTON-CONGRESS)
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ With exit polls and initial returns
pointing to a landslide victory, Brazil's election was a breeze for
incumbent President Fernando Henrique Cardoso. But Cardoso's
unprecedented second term could turn stormy. Many economists
predict a recession in 1999, deteriorating unemployment and the
need to raise taxes, all of which are likely to erode Cardoso's
popularity. With 49.4 percent of Sunday's vote counted by early
Monday, Cardoso had 50.3 percent to 35.6 percent for his closest
rival, Worker's Party candidate Luis Inacio ``Lula'' da Silva.
Cardoso is expected to win the election without a run-off by taking
more votes than all the other candidates combined.
(BRAZIL-ELECTIONS)
	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ After a day of fighting, Congolese rebels
said Sunday they had entered Kindu, the strategic town and airbase
in eastern Congo the government used to halt their advances.
Etienne Ngangura, a rebel spokesman, said the rebel fighters were
inside Kindu and had taken the adjacent, large airbase, 380
kilometers (235 miles) west of Goma, the rebel stronghold. Rebel
military sources said the fighting continued inside Kindu where the
rebels were apparently meeting stiff resistance. The rebels _
ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted members of President Laurent Kabila's
army and opposition politicians _ took up arms Aug. 2 accusing
Kabila of mismanagement, corruption and creating division among
Congo's 400 tribes. (CONGO-REBELS)

Mongolia seeks Japan's support for APEC membership

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Mongolian foreign minister on Monday asked Japan to
support his country's bid to join the 18-nation Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation.
	   Mongolian Foreign Minister R. Amarjargal told his Japanese
counterpart Masahiko Komura that Mongolia wants to start as an
observer before becoming a full APEC member, a ministry official
said.
	   Mongolia participated in APEC's regional forum meeting in July.
	   Amarjargal also asked for Japan's continuing economic support
for the stabilization of the Mongolian economy, the official said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   During the meeting, Komura expressed sympathy over the weekend
slaying of Mongolian Infrastructure Minister Sanjaasuregiin Zorig.
	   Amarjargal arrived in Tokyo on Sunday from the United States.
Because of Zorig's death, he left Japan Monday, shortening his trip
by a day.

Oslo Conservatives require candidates to sign morality pledge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Politicians wanting to run for office in
Oslo on the Conservative Party ticket will have to sign a moral
pact pledging their closets are free of embarrassing skeletons.
	   The pact is intended to keep convicted criminals and tax
cheaters off the party ticket. It does not cover personal matters
such as sexual orientation.
	   ``It is a big advantage to play with an open hand.'' said Oslo
party leader Anders Sjaastad in an interview with the Norwegian
radio network NRK.
	   ``If exposure could lead to problems for the party, then it is
better to take precautions and perhaps drop being a candidate,'' he
added.
	   The party guideline will apply for next year's local elections
in Oslo.
	   The Norwegian news media generally respect the private lives of
public figures. However, when it comes to legal and tax matters,
the nation's reporters will dig as aggressively as any in the
world.
	   In recent years, a Central Bank governor and a top Labor Party
official both resigned following reports of tax improprieties.
	   Sjaastad said candidates should expect such investigations of
their financial matters, but that he hopes probes in Norway never
resemble those faced by President Clinton and other public figures
in the United States.

Immigrants are outsiders even in generous Sweden
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ On the outskirts of Stockholm, a small
fountain bubbles cheerfully in Rinkeby Square, surrounded by neat
pastel apartment blocks with bright tile inlays. It is not what
most people picture when they hear the word ``ghetto.''
	   But a generation after immigrants began pouring into the
country, Sweden is recognizing that it has fallen short of its aim
of being a welcoming society for all.
	   Sweden goes to considerable lengths, perhaps the world's most
extensive, to make life comfortable for immigrants. The welfare
state provides comprehensive services, immigrants can get free
Swedish lessons and immigrant children are entitled to some school
instruction in their native languages. Non-citizens can vote in
local and county elections after three years in the country.
	   And they get decent housing: Rinkeby and other
immigrant-intensive neighborhoods are clean and in good repair.
	   But immigrants feel increasingly marginalized and statistics
back them up. In 1980, unemployment among immigrants was just under
twice the average for the population as a whole; now it's about
three times higher. Because Sweden's economy has been struggling in
the 1990s, that means immigrant unemployment tops 20 percent.
	   Meanwhile, immigrants are having less daily contact with Swedes
as the percentage of native-born people declines in neighborhoods
such as Rinkeby. The Hjaellbo neighborhood of Goteborg, for
instance, went from half-immigrant in 1990 to two-thirds immigrant
today.
	   Those figures come from a ``Divided Cities'' report released by
the government last year, one of the first official recognitions of
Sweden's difficulty with integrating immigrants.
	   ``Swedes used to think that human rights were a matter of
course. ... Now they see that Sweden has changed strongly,'' said
Lars Stjernkvist, director of the government's Integration
Authority, which was established this spring.
	   One task for the agency is compiling information on whether
employers discriminate against immigrants. But many immigrants and
their advocates say even if that information is gathered, the
country's laws are too weak to make significant changes.
	   An anti-discrimination law, passed only in 1994, requires a
complainant to prove not only that he had qualifications equal to
whoever got the job but that the employer consciously intended to
discriminate.
	   Even unhappy immigrants generally don't perceive Swedes as
openly discriminatory.
	   ``It's just that between me and Swedes, there is a long
distance. I can't explain it,'' said Hassan Denir, an unemployed
Turkish immigrant playing guitar in Rinkeby Square.
	   Stjernkvist agreed with that assessment. He noted with pride
that although Sweden has absorbed an enormous number of immigrants
in the past half-century _ turning an ``unbelievably homogeneous''
country into one where one of five people is of foreign origin _
there is no strong anti-immigrant movement as in Germany or France.
	   ``People say that in 30 years, Sweden is going to be like France
... immigrants aren't accepted throughout the country,'' said
Mahmout Selik, a Kurdish immigrant in Tensta, another
foreigner-filled neighborhood.
	   ``With most Swedish people it is no problem, but some are
scared,'' he said. ``There's no racism here, but some people have
been isolated'' from foreigners.
	   There are signs intolerance is growing. The anti-immigrant
Sweden Democrats party saw a sharp increase in support in recent
national elections after a campaign that got funding from France's
National Front. The party received votes from only about 0.4
percent of those who cast ballots, but saw a 40 percent increase
from 1994.
	   Denir sees the differences firsthand.
	   ``Every day I come here, play my guitar, try to create
solidarity, but ...'' he said, his voice trailing off.
	   He launched into a trancelike minor-keyed melody, swaying while
his friend urged passers-by to dance. A few stopped to listen,
smiled hesitantly, and walked on.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ With the threat of NATO attack
mounting, Yugoslavia's prime minister warned Monday the nation
faces the ``immiment danger of war'' and claimed the government was
taking steps to comply with international demands for peace in
Kosovo.
	   But U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke said the situation in
the southern Serbian province was as bad now as two weeks ago.
Holbrooke spoke in Brussels, Belgium while en route to Belgrade,
where he planned to drive home to Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic ``the extreme gravity of the situation.''
	   Meanwhile, Yugoslavia's prime minister told an emergency session
of parliament Monday that the country ``is faced with the imminent
danger of war.'' Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the main republic
of Yugoslavia.
	   Prime Minister Momir Bulatovic said the government may call a
state of emergency, which could lead to general mobilization of all
military-aged men.
	   ``The threats are serious ... and I call on this parliament to
conclude that Yugoslavia is faced with the imminent danger of war.
Yugoslavia has to defend itself if it was attacked,'' Bulatovic
said.
	   In an attempt to head off NATO action, Bulatovic said the
government had accepted a Russian proposal for the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe to investigate the crisis.
Yugoslavia had repeatedly rejected such a mission to Kosovo until
Yugoslav membership in the 54-nation organization is restored.
	   Bulatovic also claimed there was no longer any fighting in the
rebellious, majority Albanian province. He said five of the 10
special police units had been removed from Kosovo and the others
had been returned to barracks in the province.
	   In Brussels, however, Holbrooke made clear that half-measures
would not be enough to satisfy Washington and prevent a NATO
attack.
	   ``While the level of fighting may have abated temporarily, the
capacity for its resumption is there,'' Holbrooke said after a
meeting with NATO Secretary General Javier Solana and Supreme
Allied Commander Europe Wesley K. Clark.
	   ``The situation, therefore, remains fully as serious today as it
was a week or two ago,'' he said. ``We hope to make clear to
president Milosevic and the people of Yugoslavia the extreme
gravity of the situation.''
	   Fearing airstrikes, Yugoslav generals put the nation's air
defense on high alert and moved some tanks and other heavy
equipment out of Kosovo. A Western diplomat said up to 120 Yugoslav
army armored vehicles, including tanks, have been pulled out.
	   Belgrade had been counting on Russia to block any
U.N.-sanctioned military moves by the Western Alliance. On Sunday,
Milosevic met with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and Defense
Minister Igor Sergeyev, Serbian President Milan Milutinovic and
Yugoslavia's top defense officials.
	   Although the Russians are against using NATO force in Kosovo,
Ivanov and Sergeyev said the airstrikes could occur ``if decisive
measures are not immediately taken for a radical improvement of the
situation,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin told the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   To avoid such an attack, Yugoslavia must end the hostilities,
withdraw army and security forces, take urgent measures to overcome
the humanitarian crisis, ensure that refugees can return home and
take part in peace talks, he said.
	   In Berlin, German Gen. Dieter Stoeckmann told German radio that
NATO action could come ``within days.''
	   NATO's decision may depend on a report U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan is scheduled to present to the Security Council Monday
on whether Yugoslavia is meeting U.N. demands.
	   Bulatovic told parliament he expected Annan's report to be
``biased'' and based on outdated information.
	   Serb authorities appeared ready for compromise by installing an
interim government in the rebellious province in Serbia, the
dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
	   Serbian police and the Yugoslav army have routed separatist
Kosovo Albanian rebels in the crackdown that began in late
February. The conflict has killed hundreds _ most of them Albanian
civilians _ and left more than 275,000 refugees.
	   Ethnic Albanians compromise 90 percent of the province's 2
million-strong population, and most favor independence or
substantial self-rule.
	   Momentum for outside involvement has increased in the past week
amid revelations of massacres of ethnic Albanian civilians in the
forests of Kosovo.
	   Although the United States and Europeans want an end to the
fighting, they also oppose independence for Kosovo, fearing that
could destabilize other Balkan countries with Albanian populations.
	   In the Kosovo capital Pristina, the KLA offered to help NATO
forces if asked. KLA spokesman Jakup Krasniqi said in a statement
published Monday by the Albanian language newspaper Bujku that ``we
wish they (airstrikes) would become reality'' and ``we shall
provide assistance... if it is asked of us.''
	   Krasniqi accused ethnic Albanian politicians of having ``given
up on independence'' and having become ``the servants of the
enemy,'' by agreeing to accept autonomy but not independence.
	   Ethnic Albanian political leaders have rejected the new interim
government, which was drawn up without their participation. The
council is composed of seven Serbs, five ethnic Albanians and the
rest Turks and Muslims.
	   Serbs reported two attacks Sunday on civilian cars by Albanian
``terrorists'' 25 miles (40 kilometers) south of Pristina, Kosovo's
provincial capital. Elsewhere, a policeman was killed after
stepping on a mine, the Serb Media Center said.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, allied with the ethnic Albanians,
reported heavy fighting between government forces and the
guerrillas 25 miles (40 kilometers) southwest of Pristina.

Italian premier struggles to save government

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Struggling to save his government only months before
the launch of the European Monetary Union, Italian Premier Romano
Prodi appeared headed for a vote of confidence after his meeting
with the president on Monday.
	   After his talks with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, Prodi said
he will address Parliament on the political crisis later this week.
Most observers expect this will lead to a confidence vote, possibly
in the next few days.
	   Prodi's far-left ally, the Communist Refoundation Party,
provoked the crisis by withdrawing its support over the weekend and
saying it would not vote for his deficit-cutting 1999 budget, which
is tailored to membership in the new currency club.
	   In the past, Prodi has said he would call a confidence vote if
he lost the Communists' support.
	   The break with Prodi's center-left government deeply divided
Refoundation. Armando Cossuta, leader of the moderate wing,
resigned as party president on Monday.
	   He said the party's desertion of Prodi was ``wrong and
dangerous,'' but at the same time promised to follow the party
line.
	   ``We are in a very complicated political crisis which could lead
to early elections,'' Cossuta told reporters Monday. ``And with the
divisions in the left, this would mean a victory for the right.''
	   If the crisis comes to a confidence vote and Prodi loses, he
would offer his resignation. Once he does that, it is up to
Scalfaro to decide what to do. He could ask Prodi or someone else
to form a new government or he could call elections 2 1/2 years
early, something most analysts think unlikely.
	   Prodi heads Italy's 55th government since World War II and its
longest lasting save one. He has always balked at the idea of
trying to form a new majority, saying he'd rather face new
elections.
	   ``I've never changed strategy and I don't want to do political
gymnastics,'' Prodi said before meeting with Scalfaro.
	   Refoundation is not part of Prodi's center-left coalition, but
the government needs its 34 votes to muster a majority in the lower
house. It has been a difficult ally from the outset.
	   It broke with Prodi over NATO expansion earlier this year and on
sending troops into Albania last year. Prodi was forced to resign a
year ago after a bitter battle over spending cuts linked to the
euro. The crisis was resolved after Prodi made steep concessions
and promised a 35-hour work week.
	   Making Italy part of the euro has been Prodi's top priority
since he took office in May 1996.
	   The crisis cast a pall over Prodi's summit with French Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin and French President Jacques Chirac. Like
Italy, France is a charter member of the currency club.
	   There is a chance Prodi can save his budget with votes from the
centrists, but they would likely demand that he resign in exchange.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Mercedes sedan traveling at an estimated 200
kilometers per hour (120 miles per hour) slammed into a road sign
and exploded, killing two and seriously injuring another in the
Russian Far East, a news report said Monday.
	   The car also hit a transmission line, the Interfax news agency
said. It was unclear what kind of line it was.
	   The driver apparently lost control of the vehicle, traffic
police in the city of Khabarovsk, about 6100 kilometers (3,800
miles) southeast of Moscow, told Interfax.

Former French sports tycoon releases rap single
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Former politician and sports tycoon Bernard Tapie,
convicted for rigging a soccer game, is pleading his innocence _
only this time in a French recording studio.
	   Tapie, who recently dabbled in cinema, has recorded a single _
``Life's Great'' _ with French rap star Doc Gyneco. It's due for
release on Oct. 23.
	   In the single, Gyneco asks Tapie, former owner of the Olympique
Marseille soccer team, whether it's true he paid the Valenciennes
team to throw a crucial game in 1993.
	   ``Are you kidding?'' replies Tapie, who spent six months in jail
in 1997. ``I love those Valenciennes people.''
	   Elsewhere, the stocky, 55-year-old rags-to-riches politician who
once owned the sportswear giant Adidas, says he was ``struck but
not sunk'' by the bribery charges.
	   The single will appear on Doc Gyneco's upcoming album,
``Dangerous Liaisons.''
	   Tapie was an urban affairs minister in former President Francois
Mitterrand's administration in the 1980s. Since his release from
prison last year, Tapie has been under investigation for tax
evasion and misuse of funds.

Philippine president says Anwar's human rights should be respected
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Malaysia-Politics

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada said Monday
that former Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim's human
and legal rights should be respected by Malaysian authorities.
	   Anwar was fired by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on Sept. 2
after the two differed on economic policy. He then began speaking
out against Mahathir and was arrested Sept. 20.
	   Anwar, who says police beat him in custody, was brought to a
Malaysian court on Monday wearing a neck brace. He is to be
arraigned on charges of corruption and illegal homosexual acts.
	   ``Due process and human rights are universal concepts. I think
that Mr. Anwar should be given that due process,'' Estrada told
reporters.
	   On Friday, Estrada said he was considering skipping a summit of
Asia-Pacific leaders in Malaysia in November to protest the arrest
of Anwar, whom he described as a personal friend.
	   He later said he would attend the summit and had only made the
earlier remarks out of sympathy toward Anwar.
	   Estrada and Anwar were counterparts when Estrada was Philippine
vice president.
	   Two lawmakers filed resolutions in the Philippine Senate and the
House of Representatives Monday, supporting Estrada's concern over
Anwar's arrest.
	   One of them, Sen. Blas Ople, also urged Mahathir to repeal
Malaysia's Internal Security Act, which allows indefinite detention
without charge and restricts other rights.

Pakistani Shiite Muslim judge and daughter gunned down by Sunni

<TEXT>
	   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) _ A gunman in Pakistan opened fire Monday
on a Shiite Muslim magistrate taking his 22-year-old daughter to
school, killing both of them and a security guard.
	   Gunmen, riding motor bikes, opened fire on the motorized
rickshaw in which Fida Hussain and his daughter were traveling in
Gujranwala, 45 kilometers (30 miles) north of the Punjab capital of
Lahore. The driver was injured and the culprits escaped.
	   Hussain was a supporter of the Shiite militant organization
Tehrik-e-Jafria, or Movement for Implementation of Shiite Rights.
	   Riaz Basra, a member of the militant Sunni group Sipah-e-Sahaba
or Guardians of the Friends of the Prophet, quickly took
responsibility for the attack, according to the privately run News
Network International news agency.
	   Basra's group has been blamed for hundreds of attacks on Shiite
Muslims in Pakistan, many of them in the eastern Punjab province.
Several of the group's leaders have been jailed and its activists
have held rallies demanding their release and threatening to bring
down the government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
	   Sunni and Shiite militants are waging a bloody feud that has
left hundreds of people dead in recent years.
	   Sectarian violence intensified since the September killing of
four Sunni Muslim leaders in Islamabad.

ASEAN trade ministers to reaffirm free trade, free investment
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVID THURBER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Southeast Asian trade ministers plan
to sign an agreement this week opening the region to freer
investment and speed up their plans for free trade despite Asia's
ongoing financial crisis, officials say.
	   In two days of meetings in Manila, the trade ministers from the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations are scheduled to create an
ASEAN Investment Area that will remove barriers to investment from
ASEAN countries by the year 2010 and for non-ASEAN countries by
2020.
	   ``We would like to encourage ASEAN countries to invest in each
other,'' said Melito Salazar Jr., Philippine undersecretary of
trade and industry. ``We also want to make the ASEAN region more
attractive for investment.''
	   Under the agreement, businessmen from one ASEAN country would be
granted the same privileges in areas such as land ownership and
investment rights as their counterparts in another ASEAN country in
which they wish to invest.
	   However, the agreement is subject to exemptions in cases where a
country's constitution limits equal treatment.
	   Investment in Southeast Asia has dropped sharply since the
region's currency crisis hit 15 months ago. Salazar said the AIA is
a bid to make the region once again ``very competitive, with a very
transparent and attractive investment climate.''
	   Most ASEAN members are either mired in recession or grappling
with sharply lower growth as a result of the currency crisis.
Recent controls imposed by Malaysia on currency trading have also
raised the specter of some of ASEAN's crisis-hit countries
resorting to protectionist policies to shield their economies.
	   But Edsel Custodio, Philippine assistant secretary of trade and
industry, said ASEAN members instead believe they should liberalize
trade and investment more because of the crisis.
	   ``It is important for ASEAN to continue with economic
integration at this point,'' he said. ``That's why we have AIA.
Within ASEAN we see a solution to some of our troubles.''
	   In their meetings, which begin Wednesday, the trade ministers
are expected to offer to accelerate tariff cuts on a variety of
products. Under an existing ASEAN Free Trade Area agreement,
tariffs on most products are to be reduced to less that 5 percent
by the year 2003, but that would be advanced to the year 2000 for
certain products.
	   Most of the nine ASEAN ministers are expected to offer to
accelerate several hundred products, for a combined total of about
3,000 items, Custodio said.
	   As a result, more than 90 percent of the region's total trade
will consist of products with tariffs of between 0 percent and 5
percent by the turn of the century, he said.
	   Custodio said the tariff reductions will be done on a ``best
effort and voluntary basis.''
	   In 1997, inter-ASEAN trade was valued at dlrs 148.9 billion.
	   ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

Singapore prime minister accepts opponent's offer to pay damages

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's prime minister has accepted
opposition leader J.B. Jeyaretnam's offer to pay him defamation
damages in installments, Jeyaretnam said Monday.
	   The move by Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong will allow Jeyaretnam
to avoid bankruptcy and retain his Parliament seat, at least for
now.
	   The High Court awarded Goh 100,000 Singapore dollars (dlrs
59,200) in damages in a defamation suit against the Worker's Party
chief last year. Jeyaretnam, who has been sued repeatedly by
various government ministers, said he was unable to pay unless by
installment.
	   After an impasse over Goh's offer to waive the award in exchange
for an apology, the prime minister began taking steps to declare
Jeyaretnam bankrupt in August. Under Singapore law, Jeyaretnam
would have lost his seat in the 84-member Parliament, where only
three opposition members sit.
	   ``Goh Chok Tong has accepted my offer to pay by installments,''
Jeyaretnam told The Associated Press.
	   Goh's lawyers refused to comment on the case.
	   Jeyaretnam said he will pay the first of five monthly
installments for the hefty damages, plus interest for late payment,
on Tuesday. ``For the damages, bankruptcy is no longer an issue,''
he said.
	   But the substantial legal costs Jeyaretnam must also pay, which
have been estimated at about 150,000 Singapore dollars (dlrs
88,800), are still unresolved.
	   Goh's decision to accept installment payments ``doesn't mean my
fears of being make a bankrupt are all over,'' said Jeyaretnam.
``There's the costs, and of course there are seven other suits
lined up against me.''
	   Other ministers and politicians from the ruling People's Action
Party are suing the opposition leader.
	   The Goh suit stemmed from Jeyaretnam's statement during an
election rally in 1996 that another Worker's Party leader had filed
a police report against ``Goh and his people.''
	   Even though the statement was accurate, Jeyaretnam lost the
defamation case in the Singapore courts. A lower court ruled the
statement contained defamatory innuendo, and the appeals court
increased the amount of damages, saying he acted in malice.
	   This year's U.S. State Department Human Rights Report cited the
case as an example of the Singapore government using legal
processes such as libel and defamation suits to stifle freedom of
speech and intimidate the political opposition.
	   Amnesty International and the International Commission of
Jurists have also criticized the case. But Singapore has defended
its legal and political system and rejected the criticism outright.

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ A world record bungee-jump went
ahead in front of thousands of spectators and a live TV audience
Monday with the plungee diving from the Sky Tower casino, the
city's highest building, 630 feet (180 meters) toward the street.
	   The jump by promoter A.J. Hackett set a record for a bungee jump
from a building, and halted traffic in the central city as crowds
gathered to watch.
	   The night-time jump, using a rubber bungee along with two steel
guide cables to prevent Hackett from bouncing or drifting into the
building, took just 8 seconds.
	   ``That (system) keeps me in a nice little slot all the way
down,'' Hackett said before the jump. ``They work beautifully.''
	   In fact the rings on the steel cables slowed his take-off,
causing Hackett to curl out shortly after leaving the jump point,
before plunging headlong to within yards (meters) of the ground. A
thrilled crowd shouted and whistled as he jumped, and as the bungee
cord ended his plunge just above them.
	   He punched his fists into a bunch of yellow balloons as the
bungee tightened, halting his fall.
	   On the ground, he told the television reporter: ``It was
certainly rocking tonight. Something weird happened up the top
there but we got it under control halfway down. There was nothing
that could go wrong.
	   ``You accelerate very fast off the top and then coming down into
the bottom going like mad and I could feel the bungee coming on,
and yeah, the brakes are working, great.''
	   Asked what it does to the body, he said: ``You get a fair bit of
adrenalin pumping round your body, which is fairly nice.''
	   Hackett, a New Zealand entrepreneur and promoter who is credited
with popularizing the ``extreme sport'' pastime of diving from
heights with rubber
	   bands tied to the ankles, had already done two practice jumps at
the weekend.
	   His new record comes 12 years after he jumped 377 feet (115
meters) from the Eiffel Tower in Paris, setting the world record
for a jump from a building.
	   Television New Zealand dedicated 30 minutes of prime-time
television to the jump and a website broadcast it live on the
Internet.
	   Among bigger bungee jumps are one of nearly 3,300 feet (one km)
from a helicopter, and one of 700 feet (200 meters) off a dam in
the 1995 James Bond
	   movie ``Goldeneye.''
	   Bungee jumping is a modernization of a traditional Vanuatu
tribal test of
	   courage in which villagers plunge headfirst from high platforms
with vines tied to their ankles to break their fall at the last
moment -- they hope.

German youth convicted of torching church, spraying swastikas
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUEBECK, Germany (AP) _ A 20-year-old apprentice gardener who
confessed to torching a Catholic church and spraying the walls with
swastikas was convicted Monday and given two years probation.
	   The state court in Luebeck found him guilty of arson and using
banned symbols in the May 25, 1997, fire, which gutted the St.
Vicelin church.
	   Police also found graffiti threatening a pastor in Luebeck who
has spoken out against neo-Nazis and granted an Algerian refugee
family asylum in his church.
	   The fire at St. Vicelin's was one in a series of highly
publicized acts of vandalism last year in Luebeck that raised fears
of a growing neo-Nazi movement in the northern port city.
	   In 1994, neo-Nazis set a synagogue in Luebeck ablaze _ the first
such attack in Germany since World War II.

U.N. agency says youngsters under increasing threat from AIDS
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CLARIFIES figures in 3rd graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The world's children are under increasing threat
from the AIDS epidemic, the Joint United Nations Program on
HIV/AIDS said Monday.
	   More than 500,000 infants are estimated to have been infected
with HIV last year through mother-to-child transmission before or
during birth or by breast feeding, a press release from UNAIDS
said.
	   Almost half of new HIV infections _ some 7,000 of the 16,000
that occur every day _ are among people aged 10-24, the release
said. Adolescent girls and boys are now among those at the highest
risk of HIV infection from having unprotected sex or sharing
contaminated needles.
	   Peter Piot, executive director of UNAIDS, said restricting
access to sex education is a violation of children's rights.
	   ``Girls and boys need to understand how to help take charge of
their own lives _ to protect themselves and others from the virus
in situations of risk,'' Piot said.
	   Piot is among experts taking part in a meeting Monday in Geneva
organized by the Committee on the Rights of the Child, a U.N. human
rights body that monitors states' compliance with the U.N.
Convention on the Rights of the Child.
	   Adopted by the United Nations in 1989, the convention commits
the 191 governments that have ratified it to ensuring that all
children under 18 can get health care, education and psychological
and social support. The United States and Somalia have still to
sign up.

Leeds ready to name new manager; O'Neill rumored choice
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LEEDS, England (AP) _ Leeds expects to name a manager to replace
George Graham by Wednesday with Leicester's Martin O'Neill reported
to be the top candidate.
	   Leeds chairman Peter Ridsdale said the board met Sunday to
discuss the vacancy and agreed on a choice to succeed Graham, who
moved last week to Tottenham.
	   ``We came to a unanimous decision, although we have agreed to
touch base later today (Monday) to see if anybody has anything to
add,'' Ridsdale said. ``We will also now take a day or two to
reflect on that decision.
	   ``I would expect things to become clearer and maybe something to
be made public tomorrow (Tuesday) or Wednesday, more likely the
latter because of my other business dealings.''
	   In addition to O'Neill, others reported to be under
consideration are Coventry manager Gordon Strachan and Leeds
caretaker manager David O'Leary.

Indonesia to push for use of local currencies in ASEAN trade
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia plans to push for a
controversial plan to use regional currencies for regional trade
when Southeast Asian trade ministers meet in Manila this week, an
Indonesian official said Monday.
	   ``Indonesia at present is trying to enhance regional cooperation
through using regional currencies,'' said the official, who spoke
to Dow Jones Newswires on condition of anonymity.
	   The plan follows a dramatic slide in the value of local
currencies over the past year. Southeast Asian nations now trade
among each other mostly using the comparatively expensive U.S.
dollar.
	   Indonesia's rupiah has been the worst hit of all the currencies
in the region.
	   Trade ministers from the nine-member Association of Southeast
Asian Nations are to meet on Wednesday and Thursday.
	   Economy, Finance and Industry Coordinating Minister Ginandjar
Kartasasmita will lead Indonesia's delegation, along with Trade and
Industry Minister Rahardi Ramelan and Investment Minister Hamzah
Haz.
	   The official said it was unclear whether Ginandjar would also
raise with his ASEAN colleagues Indonesian efforts to monitor the
country's foreign-exchange earnings better by asking exporters to
deposit their hard-currency revenue at the central bank.
	   Earlier, an official at the investment ministry said ongoing
discussions among various ministers _ including economics and
investment _ focused on installing a system that will require
exporters to place their foreign-exchange earnings in Bank
Indonesia.
	   He stressed that the plan under discussion wasn't a form of
capital or foreign-exchange control, adding that the exporters
would be free to withdraw their revenue at any time ``using the
spot market rate.''

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke
said Monday the military situation in Kosovo remains critical
despite a lull in fighting and the removal of some Yugoslav tanks
and troops from the battlefield.
	   Speaking after a meeting with NATO Secretary General Javier
Solana and Supreme Allied Commander Europe Wesley K. Clark,
Holbrooke said ``while the level of fighting (in Kosovo) may have

	   ``The situation therefore remains fully as serious today as it
was a week or two ago,'' he told reporters before flying to
Belgrade.
	   He said Solana and Clark told him that ``significant military
forces, regular forces and military uniformed police, remain in
Kosovo.''
	   Holbrooke was told NATO preparations to launch military action
against Yugoslavia continued unabated and would become inevitable
unless President Slobodan Milosevic takes decisive action soon.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ With the threat of NATO attack
mounting, Yugoslavia's prime minister warned Monday the nation
faces the ``immiment danger of war'' and claimed the government was
taking steps to comply with international demands for peace in
Kosovo.
	   But U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke said the situation in
the southern Serbian province was as bad now as two weeks ago.
Holbrooke spoke in Brussels, Belgium en route to Belgrade, where he
planned to drive home to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
``the extreme gravity of the situation.''
	   Meanwhile, Yugoslavia's prime minister told an emergency session
of parliament Monday that the country ``is faced with the imminent
danger of war.'' Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the main republic
of Yugoslavia.
	   ``The threats are serious,'' Prime Minister Momir Bulatovic
said. ``And I call on this parliament to conclude that Yugoslavia
is faced with the imminent danger of war. Yugoslavia has to defend
itself if it was attacked.''
	   One option could be for parliament to declare a state of
emergency _ a step which could lead to a general mobilization of
all military-aged men.
	   In an attempt to head off NATO action, Bulatovic said the
government had accepted a Russian proposal for the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe to investigate the crisis.
	   Yugoslavia had repeatedly rejected such a mission to Kosovo
until Yugoslav membership in the 54-nation organization is
restored.
	   Bulatovic also claimed there was no longer any fighting in the
rebellious, majority Albanian province. He said five of the 10
special police units had been removed from Kosovo and the others
had been returned to barracks in the province.
	   In Brussels, however, Holbrooke made clear that half-measures
would not be enough to satisfy Washington and prevent a NATO
attack.
	   ``While the level of fighting may have abated temporarily, the
capacity for its resumption is there,'' Holbrooke said after a
meeting with NATO Secretary General Javier Solana and Supreme
Allied Commander Europe Wesley K. Clark.
	   ``The situation, therefore, remains fully as serious today as it
was a week or two ago,'' he said. ``We hope to make clear to
president Milosevic and the people of Yugoslavia the extreme
gravity of the situation.''
	   Meanwhile, the head of Yugoslavia's other republic, Montenegro,
called on Milosevic to accept all international demands and avert a
NATO attack.
	   ``We have to avert a clash with the whole world, a confrontation
which we are bound to lose,'' Montenegro's pro-Western president,
Milo Djukanovic, said in a statement.
	   Djukanovic, a staunch Milosevic critic, called on the Yugoslav
president to address the nation ``with an unambiguous message''
that he has accepted all U.N. resolutions and agreements he made
with Russian President Boris Yeltsin.
	   Djukanovic blamed Yugoslavia's problems on Milosevic's
``undemocratic regime.''
	   Fearing airstrikes, Yugoslav generals put the nation's air
defense on high alert and moved some tanks and other heavy
equipment out of Kosovo. A Western diplomat said up to 120 Yugoslav
army armored vehicles, including tanks, have been pulled out.
	   Belgrade had been counting on Russia to block any
U.N.-sanctioned military moves by the Western Alliance. On Sunday,
Milosevic met with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and Defense
Minister Igor Sergeyev, Serbian President Milan Milutinovic and
Yugoslavia's top defense officials.
	   Although the Russians are against using NATO force in Kosovo,
Ivanov and Sergeyev said the airstrikes could occur ``if decisive
measures are not immediately taken for a radical improvement of the
situation,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin told the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   To avoid such an attack, Yugoslavia must end the hostilities,
withdraw army and security forces, take urgent measures to overcome
the humanitarian crisis, ensure that refugees can return home and
take part in peace talks, he said.
	   In Berlin, German Gen. Dieter Stoeckmann told German radio that
NATO action could come ``within days.''
	   NATO's decision may depend on a report U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan is scheduled to present to the Security Council Monday
on whether Yugoslavia is meeting U.N. demands.
	   Bulatovic told parliament he expected Annan's report to be
``biased'' and based on outdated information.
	   Serb authorities appeared ready for compromise by installing an
interim government in the rebellious province in Serbia, the
dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
	   Serbian police and the Yugoslav army have routed separatist
Kosovo Albanian rebels in the crackdown that began in late
February. The conflict has killed hundreds _ most of them Albanian
civilians _ and left more than 275,000 refugees.
	   Ethnic Albanians compromise 90 percent of the province's 2
million-strong population, and most favor independence or
substantial self-rule.
	   Momentum for outside involvement has increased in the past week
amid revelations of massacres of ethnic Albanian civilians in the
forests of Kosovo.
	   Although the United States and Europeans want an end to the
fighting, they also oppose independence for Kosovo, fearing that
could destabilize other Balkan countries with Albanian populations.
	   In the Kosovo capital Pristina, the KLA offered to help NATO
forces if asked. KLA spokesman Jakup Krasniqi said in a statement
published Monday by the Albanian language newspaper Bujku that ``we
wish they (airstrikes) would become reality'' and ``we shall
provide assistance... if it is asked of us.''
	   Krasniqi accused ethnic Albanian politicians of having ``given
up on independence'' and having become ``the servants of the
enemy,'' by agreeing to accept autonomy but not independence.
	   Ethnic Albanian political leaders have rejected the new interim
government, which was drawn up without their participation. The
council is composed of seven Serbs, five ethnic Albanians and the
rest Turks and Muslims.

 &UR; Scare over mutual fund causes sharp fall of stock index &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with market closing, crowds outside UTI office.
CHANGES dateline, ADDs byline &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ Indian stocks fell more than 7 percent
Monday, as nervous investors feared the Unit Trust of India, the
country's largest mutual fund manager, would reduce its investment
in shares.
	   A crowd of more than 100 people, many of them middle-aged or
retired investors, gathered at the office of the mutual fund to
sell shares. A police spokesman said there was no violence.
	   The Sensex of the Bombay Stock Exchange, the benchmark index,
fell 7.2 percent, to close at 2877.92 points from its previous
close of 3102.29. It was the sharpest drop since March 31,1997,
when the index fell more than 8 percent in reaction to the collapse
of the United Front coalition government.
	   Last week, UTI Chairman P.S. Subramanyam said its largest US-64
mutual fund plan was losing money because of a steep fall in share
prices. The market has dropped in response to international
sanctions imposed after India conducted nuclear tests in May and
because of India's downgrading by international rating agencies.
	   UTI and US-64 are important to the Indian stock market because
UTI accounts for more than 80 percent of investments in the mutual
fund industry, and US-64 accounts for nearly a third of UTI's
investments.
	   The UTI chairman said last week the fund may reduce US-64's
investments in equity from 64 percent to 60 percent. This led to
fears that UTI would emerge as a major seller.
	   Because of holidays, Monday was the first market day since
Wednesday, when UTI _ in a bid to shore up investor confidence _
announced it would repurchase US-64 units in October at a higher
price than in September.
	   Subramanyam told Dow Jones Newswires there are no redemption
pressures on the US-64 fund, but new funds will be channel into
non-equity investments.
	   ``We won't go selling our shares at their current prices,'' he
said. ``We will invest the new funds in non-equity instruments and
bring down the exposure in equities.''
	   Most of the selling appeared to be from small holders.
``Corporates have reassured me they are with us,'' Subramanyam
said. Around 30 percent of the US-64 units are held by companies.
	   Analysts said another factor in the sell-off could be fears of
political instability after the Akali Dal, until now a staunch ally
of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, threatened to withdraw
support to the government unless a regional dispute is solved in
its favor.
	   The drop in share prices across the board was partly attributed
to the long weekend, which did not let the market to react to
political news.
	   The analysts said the market should level out. ``I don't think
it will fall further,'' said Kamal Sen, an economist at DSP Merrill
Lynch.
	   V. Ramesh, general manager of Mafatlal Securities said Monday's
fall was nothing to worry about. ``It's speculative hammering. I
think its a good time to buy.''

Former prime minister denies receiving millions from convicted
</HEADLINE>
embezzler &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A former Spanish prime minister denied
Monday receiving millions of dollars in return for favors to a
flamboyant financier currently serving time for embezzlement.
	   ``I never received anything,'' Adolfo Suarez said under oath at
the National Court, the Spanish news agency EFE reported.
	   Suarez, prime minister between 1976 and 1981, was called at a
witness in the trial of former banker Mario Conde, and 10 others,
accused of defrauding the Banesto bank of seven billion pesetas
(dlrs 48 million).
	   Conde, who is already serving a four-year and two-month sentence
for a lesser corruption case involving Banesto, could get more than
40 years if convicted in the current trial.
	   As part of this case Conde has been accused of absconding with
300 million pesetas (dlrs two million) in 1989.
	   But the banker has counterattacked by alleging that the money
was given to Suarez in return for the former prime minister using
his influence at the Bank of Spain _ the country's central bank _
to get a hostile takeover bid for Banesto blocked. Suarez allegedly
used the money to finance his Democratic and Social Center party,
or CDS.
	   ``Neither me, nor the CDS ever received money from Banesto for
lobbying its case to the Bank of Spain,'' EFE quoted Suarez as
saying.
	   In 1993, four years after the alleged transaction, the Bank of
Spain took over Banesto and ousted Conde after discovering a
shortfall of 600 billion pesetas (dlrs 5 billion) on the bank's
books.
	   Suarez is now a respected elder statesman, much lauded for
overseeing Spain's remarkably smooth transition to democracy after
the death of Gen. Francisco Franco in 1975.
	   Conde, with his slicked-back hair and high-society habits, came
to symbolize the get-rich-quick mentality that characterized much
of the post-transition 1980s.

Myanmar exile groups says opposition members charged under harsh
</HEADLINE>
law &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A Myanmar exile group said Monday that
several opposition party members have been charged under the
provisions of a harsh emergency law and face long jail terms.
	   The military government said they were being held for
discussions.
	   The All Burma Students' Democratic Front, based in Thailand,
listed by name 10 elected members of parliament belonging to the
National League for Democracy who it said had been charged under
the 1950 Emergency Provision Act.
	   A similar claim last week by the student group met with a
response from a spokesman from the military government that the
five people listed were ``at present being invited and housed at
the government guest houses for exchange of views.''
	   In recent months, the government has been in a sustained
confrontation with the opposition. It began mass arrests in May and
intensified them in September in an effort to block the NLD from
carrying out a threat to convene parliament on its own. The NLD won
a landslide victory in 1990 elections, but the military never
allowed parliament to meet.
	   At the end of last month, the NLD said 961 party members,
including 202 elected representatives from the 1990 election, have
been detained so far.
	   The All Burma Students' Democratic Front, citing student sources
in the Myanmar capital Yangon, claimed Monday that if students and
political activists from other organization were included, the
total number of arrests is close to 2,000.
	   The government's refusal to admit it has detained the NLD
members, along with accurate reports in the past from the student
group, lends its claims credibility.
	   Senior NLD members last month set up a self-styled parliament,
acting as proxies for the detained members.
	   The military regime in Myanmar, also known as Burma, responded
by denouncing the group and stepping up its vitriolic campaign
against the NLD in the state-controlled media.
	   Members of the so-called Committee Representing the Parliament
include NLD leader Aung San Suu Kyi, eight senior officials in her
party and a delegate representing the country's ethnic minorities.

U.N. official urges against reported North Korean limousine
</HEADLINE>
purchase

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A reported North Korean plan to lavish U.S. dlrs
20 million on a new fleet of limousines could undermine sympathy
for the poor, famine-threatened country, a senior U.N. relief
official said Monday.
	   Officials asked a Daimler-Benz executive who visited North Korea
last month to supply 200 of the latest S500-class Mercedes cars and
offered to pay more for rapid delivery, a Hong Kong-based
newspaper, the South China Morning Post, reported Monday.
	   Asked about the report, the U.N. World Food Program's deputy
head, Namanga Ngongi, said he would rather see North Korea spend
dlrs 20 million to alleviate its chronic food shortages.
	   The reported effort to purchase the cars ``makes it harder for
those who are going to put hands in their pockets,'' Ngongi said at
a news conference on the eve of a five-day visit to North Korea.
	   Four years of chronic food shortages caused by crop-destroying
weather and government mismanagement have left North Korea's
economy in tatters, its people heavily reliant on foreign aid.
	   Before his trip to North Korea, Ngongi spent three days touring
Hunan province in south China, among the areas badly hit this
summer by the country's worst floods in decades.
	   In just one county, Anxiang, more than 200,000 homeless people
have been living on dikes since late July, he said.
	   Providing adequate shelter for the homeless remains the biggest
problem. ``Over the winter it will be terrible,'' Ngongi said.
	   The World Food Program appealed last month for a total dlrs 139
million in disaster relief to provide food, shelter, sanitation,
health care and other urgent needs of some 5.8 million people left
homeless by widespread flooding along the Yangtze River.

Bahrain records hottest September this century
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ Bahrain experienced its hottest September
this century, with mean highs of 38.5 degrees Celsius (101.3
Fahrenheit), the Gulf Daily News reported Monday.
	   The previous record was 37.8 C (100 F) in September 1975, the
English-language newspaper said.
	   The mean high ``apparent'' temperature, which factors in wind
and humidity, last month was 50.7 C (123.2 F), surpassing the 49.5
C (121.1) recorded in 1982, the paper said, quoting figures from
Bahrain's Meteorology Department.
	   Still, August retained the record for hottest month this
century. August's mean high apparent temperature was 53.8 C (129
F), or nearly 5 degrees Celsius (8.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above
normal.
	   Although a number of people on this tiny Gulf island were
treated at hospitals for sunstroke or dehydration, no deaths were
reported.

Minority government presents make-or-break 1999 budget proposal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG MELLGREN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Norway's minority government on Monday
presented what looks like a daring plan or its last will and
testament: a 1999 proposed national budget with spending cuts and
tax hikes that instantly provoked the entire political opposition.
	   ``The government wishes to reduce the pressure in the Norwegian
economy,'' Finance Minister Gudmund Restad said in presenting the
budget. ``It is necessary to tighten up.... Now it is up to
Parliament to do its part of the job by passing the budget.''
	   The ruling coalition led by Christian Democrat Kjell Mange
Bondevik took power almost a year ago as the economy was peaking
after a six-year boom linked to oil production and sales. Norway is
the world's second largest exporter.
	   There is broad agreement that the economy must cool off, or
Norway might slip into an economic slump. The question is how to do
that.
	   About what looks to be the toughest budget battle in recent
Norwegian history, analysts predict there is a good chance the
small, three-party coalition will not survive the autumn session.
	   The proposed budget of about 509.1 billion kroner (dlrs 68.8
billion) revenue tightens central government spending by 9 billion
kroner (dlrs 1.2 billion).
	   The proposal sets aside the budget's entire 55 billion kroner
(dlrs 7.4 billion) surplus for Norway's petroleum fund, a nest egg
invested abroad against the day the country's oil production
declines.
	   The three-party coalition, with just 42 representatives in the
165-seat parliament, needs support from other parties to pass its
budget and remain in office.
	   The proposed 4 billion kroner (dlrs 540 million) in tax hikes
alienated the political right, the Conservatives and the Party of
Progress.
	   To the left, Labor, the country's largest party with 65 seats,
said it won't support the budget, partly because it includes 3
billion kroner (dlrs 400 million) to pay parents to stay home with
very small children. Party officials said the program is
unwarranted and unaffordable.
	   The coalition claims to be a third bloc - the center - between
Norway's traditionally right and left politics. Bondevik, a
51-year-old Lutheran minister, said his government will decide
where to seek support after the opposition has had the chance to
study the budget draft.
	   ``I think major elements will go through,'' said Bondevik, who
recently returned to office after more than three weeks' sick leave
due to depression bought on by overwork.
	   Carl I. Hagen, leader of the Party of Progress, said budget
talks would be ``extremely tough,'' but his party, the second
largest in parliament with 25 seats, was willing to negotiate.
	   The proposal also riled trade unions by cutting one vacation day
for wage-earners, and increasing taxes, electricity rates and other
fees for households.
	   Among economic indicators, the budget projected a rise in
inflation to 3.5 percent from 2.6 percent this year; a decline in
unemployment to 3.2 percent from 3.3 percent; and wage growth of 5
percent compared to 6 percent.

	   The match, due to be played Saturday in the Yugoslav capital
Belgrade, has been put off ``in view of the political situation in
Yugoslavia and the subsequent effects at international level,'' a
press release said. A UEFA spokeswoman didn't give any further
details.

	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ An American diplomat was robbed
of her passport, jewellery and money worth about 60,000 rand (dlrs
10,000) at a South African hotel where she was staying, police said
on Monday.
	   Ruth Perry, based in Liberia, was in Cape Town for a conference
on the peace process in the Central African country of Burundi
organized by President Nelson Mandela's wife Graca Machel.
	   Perry, of Oakland, Calif., left her handbag with her luggage in
the lobby of her hotel while she ate a meal in the hotel
restaurant. When she returned the handbag was gone.
	   The crime took place on Saturday, when Perry had been due to
leave Cape Town. She was in South Africa Monday awaiting a
replacement passport, Sgt. John Abbott said.
	   South Africa is infamous for its high crime rate, but Cape Town
is considered safer than other large cities, such as Johannesburg.

	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Serious health hazards loom in Tafara
and Mabvuku, eastern suburbs of Harare, after three days without
water due to an electrical fault at the main pumping supply point.
	   ``There is no back up strategy for this area -- not even a
borehole to keep the toilets going. Can you imagine the level of
suffering being experienced?'' said a local Roman Catholic priest,
the Rev. Fidelis Mukonori.
	   Residents Sunday broke valves on the main pipes that supply the
pumping station in order to obtain muddy water for cooking purposes
while thousands trekked to Chishawasha Mission, 5 miles away, to
fetch water.
	   Local councillor Elliott Mahara said water tankers might be
deployed Monday to ease the crisis, which comes as hot weather
increases the risk of fly-borne diseases.
	   The capital is already experiencing an epidemic of meningoccocal
meningitis due to overcrowded and insanitary conditions,
particularly among the 1 million residents living in shacks.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Harsh structural adjustment plans imposed

education, particularly for girls, President Daniel arap Moi said
Monday.

International Federation of Women Laywers, Moi said primary school
enrollment of girls in Kenya had increased fThe conference, entitled ``Women of the 21st Century,'' runs

	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ A private South African railway
company has been granted a 20-year concession to operate on the
network of the state-owned Tanzania Railways Corp., a regional
newspaper said Monday.
	   The weekly East African said the first contract to allow a
private firm _ Trans Africa Railway Corp. _ to locate and run on
the Tanzanian network will take effect in December.
	   Trans Africa's general manager, Simon Fourie, told the newspaper
his company would reinforce the network with three Class 35 diesel
locomotives and 200 boxcars (wagons) adjusted to fit Tanzania's
1,000 mm narrow gauge.
	   All southern African railways from Cape Town to Zambia operate
on a 1,067 mm gauge.
	   Many of Tanzania Railways' boxcars are stranded in western
Tanzania in Lake Tanganyika ports with goods destined for the
Democratic Republic of Congo.
	   The network is expected to earn dlrs 25 million on the deal over
the next five years, depending on traffic volume.

<TEXT>
	   VIRGINIA BEACH, Virginia (AP) _ Lt. John Kainer wanted to prove
he still had the strength and stamina to compete in the grueling
sport of wilderness adventure racing, even though he has a brain
tumor.
	   He succeeded.
	   The member of the elite Navy SEAL unit was on the only
all-American team to complete the recent Raid Gauloises.
	   The four-man, one-woman Team Odyssey began the race on Sept. 19
in the Andes in Ecuador. The members crossed the finish line at the
Pacific Ocean 10 days later _ after hiking, riding horses and
mountain bikes, climbing a 20,000-foot (6,100-meter) volcano,
whitewater rafting, canoeing and kayaking along the event's
350-mile (560-kilometer) course.
	   The teammates slept as little as possible to forge ahead
quickly.
	   The team was listed 15th in the official standings, which it is
disputing because it believes it came in 13th. Either way, that's
an improvement over the team's 16th-place finish in last year's
race in South Africa.
	   ``Personally, I'm very happy with the way we did,'' said Kainer,
31, who returned home to Virginia Beach on Thursday.
	   ``As a team, I believed we worked well together,'' he said. ``We
pulled together in some pretty tough times. The weather was
extremely bad, very cold, very wet.''
	   Kainer, however, was disappointed that the team didn't place
high enough (first, second or third) to win any prize money. He had
promised to donate any winnings to the American Brain Tumor
Association.
	   ``Hopefully, what we did do is maybe raise a little awareness,''
Kainer said.
	   ``We'll be back,'' he said. ``We gained some experience out
there, each and every one of us. We'll come back a little stronger
next year. Give us a year or two, and we'll be in the money.''
	   Team captain Don Mann agreed, saying the team just needs to work
on reducing mistakes that cost too much time.
	   ``I am burning up inside knowing we have what it takes to win
one of these things and we need another chance,'' said Mann, 40, a
former Navy SEAL and president of Virginia Beach-based Odyssey
Adventure Racing, which organizes adventure races in the state.
	   The other team members were Joy Marr, of Beckley, West Virginia,
a whitewater expert who is vice president of Odyssey Adventure
Racing; Chris Burgous, a former SEAL in Virginia who now lives in
Golden, Colorado; and Mike Phillips, a SEAL who lives in
Washington, D.C.'s Maryland suburbs.
	   The Raid Gauloises, first held in New Zealand in 1989, is the
biggest and oldest annual wilderness adventure race. Such races are
patterned after survival training developed by the British military
during World War II and by the U.S. Navy in the SEAL (sea, air and
land) program.
	   Mann noted that fewer than half of the 49 teams that entered
completed the race, and that the four other teams comprised of only
American members weren't able to finish.
	   Kainer said he felt good throughout the race and doesn't believe
the tumor affected his performance.
	   ``I wasn't scared for my life _ I was scared I was going to let
the team down,'' he said. ``No one on the team wants to be the
person to slow the team down.''
	   Kainer found out about the tumor last fall after he had a
seizure when he jumped from an airplane cruising at 13,000 feet
(21,000-kilometer) during a training mission.
	   His right arm was paralyzed, and he couldn't pull the rip cord
on his parachute until he reached over with his left arm.
	   An MRI revealed the cancerous tumor, 4 centimeters in diameter.
In January, Kainer began six weeks of radiation treatment. Kainer
said doctors don't really know for sure how long he has to live.
	   Kainer has refused to let the tumor interfere with his active
personal life. He ran a marathon 10 days after his last radiation
treatment and he took part in a smaller wilderness race in August
to get ready for the Raid Gauloises.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The United States and Russia are
ratcheting up the pressure on Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic, warning that NATO airstrikes are inevitable unless he
takes decisive action to end the crisis in Kosovo province.
	   Fearing airstrikes, Yugoslav generals put the nation's air
defense on high alert, but tried a belated compromise by moving
some tanks and other heavy equipment out of Kosovo. A Western
diplomat said up to 120 Yugoslav army armored vehicles, including
tanks, have been pulled out.
	   However, U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke said Monday that the
Kosovo situation remains critical despite a lull in fighting and
the removal of some Yugoslav tanks and troops. Holbrooke spoke in
Brussels, Belgium, en route to Belgrade to meet with Milosevic.
	   ``We hope to make clear to president Milosevic and the people of
Yugoslavia the extreme gravity of the situation,'' Holbrooke said
after a meeting with NATO leaders.
	   Holbrooke said he was told that NATO preparations continued
unabated. ``At NATO, the planning for military action is serious,
intense and sustained,'' he said.
	   Serbian police and the Yugoslav army have routed separatist
Kosovo Albanian rebels in the crackdown that began in late
February. The conflict has killed hundreds _ most of them Albanian
civilians _ and left more than 275,000 refugees. Kosovo is in
southern Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
	   Milosevic met Sunday with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov
and Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, Serbian President Milan
Milutinovic and Yugoslavia's top defense officials.
	   The Russians are against using NATO force in Kosovo. However,
Ivanov and Sergeyev said the airstrikes could occur ``if decisive
measures are not immediately taken for a radical improvement of the
situation,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin told the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   To avoid such an attack, Yugoslavia must end the hostilities,
withdraw army and security forces, take urgent measures to overcome
the humanitarian crisis, ensure that refugees can return home and
take part in peace talks, he said.
	   In Berlin, German Gen. Dieter Stoeckmann told German radio that
NATO action could come ``within days.''
	   NATO's decision may depend on a report U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan is scheduled to present Monday to the Security Council
on whether Yugoslavia is meeting U.N. demands.
	   Serb authorities appeared ready for compromise by installing an
interim government in the rebellious province in Serbia, the
dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
	   On Monday, Yugoslav Prime Minister Bulatovic said the government
had accepted a Russian proposal for the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe to investigate the crisis. Yugoslavia had
repeatedly rejected such a mission until its membership in the
54-nation organization is restored.
	   Bulatovic also claimed there was no longer any fighting in the
secessionist, majority Albanian province. He said five of the 10
special police units had been removed from Kosovo and the others
had been returned to barracks in the province.
	   A Yugoslav statement said the nation's leaders wanted the Kosovo
dispute solved peacefully, ``but in case we are attacked, we shall
defend our country with all means.''
	   Although the United States and Europeans want an end to the
fighting, they oppose independence for the majority ethnic Albanian
province, fearing it could destabilize other Balkan countries with
Albanian populations.
	   In Kosovo's capital, Pristina, the separatist Kosovo Liberation
Army offered to help NATO forces if asked. KLA spokesman Jakup
Krasniqi said in a statement published Monday by the Albanian
language newspaper Bujku that ``we wish they (airstrikes) would
become reality'' and ``we shall provide assistance ... if it is
asked of us.''
	   Serbs reported two attacks Sunday on civilian cars by Albanian
``terrorists'' 25 miles (40 kilometers) south of Pristina.
Elsewhere, a policeman was killed after stepping on a mine, the
Serb Media Center said.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, allied with the ethnic Albanians,
reported heavy fighting between government forces and the
guerrillas 25 miles (40 miles) southwest of Pristina.
	   Ethnic Albanian political leaders have rejected the new interim
government, which was drawn up without their participation and in
which Serbs outnumber Albanians.
	   Momentum for outside involvement has increased in the past week
amid revelations of massacres of ethnic Albanian civilians in the
forests of Kosovo.
	   EU foreign ministers on Monday debated tighter economic
sanctions against Yugoslavia, but it appeared unlikely that the
latest batch _ tighter travel restrictions and freezing more
Yugoslav assets abroad _ would be anything more than symbolic.

Figures show Indonesia remains in severe economic crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia has plunged deeper into
recession while enduring an inflation rate of more than 80 percent,
government figures released Monday show.
	   The Central Bureau of Statistics said the economy shrank by 13.6
percent during the first nine months of this year, compared with
the same period in 1997. The annual inflation rate was running at
82.4 percent.
	   Chief statistician Sugito Suwito told reporters he doubted
inflation could be kept below the government's target of 80 percent
for the whole of 1998.
	   ``Frankly speaking, we are pessimistic that the inflation growth
could be able to be pushed below the figure,'' he told reporters.
	   The bureau predicted the Indonesian economy would contract by
13.7 percent for 1998 overall.
	   Indonesia has been hardest hit by Asia's financial meltdown.
	   A dramatic plunge in the value of the rupiah has resulted in
skyrocketing prices, mass unemployment and corporate insolvency.
Food shortages in some areas have set off sporadic looting and
rioting.
	   Protests against President B.J. Habibie, who replaced autocratic
President Suharto, have also increased in recent weeks.

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The world's children are under increasing threat
from the AIDS epidemic, the Joint United Nations Program on
HIV/AIDS said Monday.
	   More than 500,000 infants are estimated to have been infected
with HIV last year through mother-to-child transmission before or
during birth or by breast feeding, a press release from UNAIDS
said.
	   Almost half of new HIV infections _ some 7,000 of the 16,000
that occur every day _ are among people aged 10-24, the release
said. Adolescent girls and boys are now among those at the highest
risk of HIV infection from having unprotected sex or sharing
contaminated needles.

Sears to be exclusive Benetton distributor in US
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The Italian leisure wear company Benetton said
Monday that Sears department stores will be the exclusive
distributor for its new U.S. line.
	   ``Thanks to the alliance with Sears, the Benetton Group will
reinforce its presence on the U.S. market,'' said the company's
chief executive, Carlo Gilardi.
	   He said the new line combines ``the international image of the
Benetton brand with the price-quality relationship that American
clients asked us to offer.''
	   The company said the new line would go on sale starting in the
summer of 1999.
	   Benetton has been sold in the United States since 1980 and
currently has about 200 U.S. stores.

Iran offers to mediate between Syria, Turkey
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Turkey-Kurdish Rebels &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran has offered to mediate between Syria
and Turkey in the deepening dispute over Kurdish rebel bases and
plans to dispatch envoys to the two countries, the Tehran Times
reported Monday.
	   Egypt already has launched a mediation effort to try to prevent
a military confrontation over Turkish allegations that Syria is
harboring Turkish Kurdish rebels.
	   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak held talks Sunday with Syrian
President Hafez Assad in Damascus and was expected to visit Turkey
later this week.
	   Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi made the mediation offer
in a Sunday telephone conversation with his Syrian counterpart,
Farouk al-Sharaa, said the paper, which is close to the Foreign
Ministry.
	   It did not say when Iran planned to send its emissaries.
	   Tensions between Turkey and Syria, Iran's closest Arab ally,
have escalated in recent days.
	   Ankara has sent troops to its border with Syria, prompting fears
of an attack. There have been unconfirmed reports of Turkish jets
violating Syria airspace near the border.
	   Turkish President Suleyman Demirel warned Damascus on Sunday
that Turkey would not let its neighbor continue sheltering Kurdish
rebels. Syria denies the allegation.
	   Turkey long has accused Syria of providing refuge to Kurdish
rebels, who have been fighting since 1984 for more autonomy for the
Kurdish population in southeastern Turkey.
	   For its part, Syria has accused Turkey of forming military
alliances with Israel that threaten Arab security and undermine
Syria's bargaining position in peace talks with the Jewish state.
	   Turkey's military alliance with Israel has been condemned by
Iran.
	   Syria also has accused Turkey of threatening its supply of water
by building dams on the Euphrates River.

Russia sells NASA its time on international space station
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The cash-strapped Russian Space Agency has agreed
to sell its research time on the international space station to the
United States for dlrs 60 million so it can finish a long-delayed
component of the station, officials said Monday.
	   The deal to buy research time is a part of NASA's effort to bail
out its Russian counterpart and prevent costly new delays in
constructing and launching the 16-country international space
station. The project is behind schedule because Russia lacks the
funds to build the station's crew compartment.
	   Russian Space Agency spokesman Sergei Gorbunov said the deal
wouldn't change Russia's obligations and its rights under the dlrs
21 billion project. Russia would only lose research time for the
period of the station's assembly in orbit, expected to last for at
least four years, he said.
	   ``The agreement will not hurt Russia's space program,'' Gorbunov
said in a telephone interview.
	   Russia's space agency has failed to meet three target dates for
the crew module's launch because of a lack of funds, putting the
whole project more than one year behind schedule.
	   Under the deal, Russia would let NASA use research time that had
been reserved for Russian scientific experiments. Russian
cosmonauts will also help with U.S. experiments, Gorbunov said.
	   He acknowledged that Russia badly needs money to complete the
module that would house the station's crew. He insisted however,
that the deal doesn't mean that NASA is paying for the segment's
construction.
	   ``It's a separate contract that doesn't affect Russia's
obligations to build the service module,'' Gorbunov told The
Associated Press. ``We expect to spend some of the money on the
service module, but it's not like NASA ordering us to spend them on
exactly that purpose.''
	   Representatives of the 16 countries participating in the
project, including Russia, the United States, Canada and Japan, met
in Moscow last week to discuss the construction timetable.
	   Despite the delay in the service module's construction, they
decided to carry out the first two launches of parts of the station
as planned.
	   A cargo module built by the Russian Khrunichev company, under
contract with the U.S. firm Boeing, will be launched first on Nov.
20. NASA will follow in December with the launch of a second part,
an American-built passageway, Gorbunov said.
	   The Russian service module will be launched in July, not in
April as earlier planned, he said.
	   Media reports said last month that NASA will ask Congress and
the White House for approval to buy up to dlrs 660 million in goods
and services from the Russian Space Agency over the next four years
to let it meet its obligations on the international space station.
	   Gorbunov said the sum wasn't discussed at the meetings between
Russian and NASA officials last week. He said, however, that Russia
turned down a NASA proposal to buy two escape capsules for dlrs 100
million.
	   ``The price they offered was too cheap. The real price to be
discussed is between dlrs 150 and 180 million,'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   NOORDWIJK, Netherlands (AP) _ As birthday presents go, this one
was out of this world.
	   Andre Kuipers, a doctor, was named the Netherlands' second-ever
astronaut on Monday, which also just happened to be his 40th
birthday.
	   Delighting the Dutch, State Secretary for Economic Affairs
Gerrit Ybema made the announcement at a space exposition in this
North Sea coastal town.
	   Kuipers will join the European Space Agency as one of 16
European astronauts in training for scientific missions aboard a
dlrs 30 billion international space station in the making.
	   Only two Dutchmen have been named astronauts. The first, Wubbo
Ockels, flew on U.S. missions, including one on Challenger just two
months before the shuttle exploded with a crew of seven in 1986.

Hague wins party ballot on single-currency stance
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: detailed results of ballot to be announced about 1430 GMT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BOURNEMOUTH, England (AP) _ Conservative Party leader William
Hague claimed victory in a membership ballot on his opposition to a
European single currency, and said Monday he hoped the party could
move away from the damaging splits of the past.
	   Hours before the official results were announced, Hague told
reporters that he had achieved a ``pretty decisive result'' in
favor of his policy of not joining the single currency in this
Parliament or the next. Effectively, that could rule out joining
before 2007.
	   The Conservatives, whose 18-year run in government ended in a
crushing national election defeat last year, open their annual
conference Tuesday in Bournemouth.
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair's government is keeping its options
open on the single currency, which 11 of the 15 European Union
members are launching next year.
	   A decision on Britain's membership will almost certainly fall to
the governing Labor Party, and the Conservative Party vote is as
much about intra-party feuding as it is about national policy.
	   Hague said the poll would enable to the party move on from
``looking inwards and sorting ourselves out internally to looking
outwards at the problems of the country.''
	   However, former Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine said the
ballot settled nothing. ``Self-evidently, the discussion and public
debate about Europe is a real issue and is going to continue as a
real issue,'' Heseltine told a news conference in London earlier in
the day.
	   Lord Howe, a former foreign secretary, said it would be a
tragedy if the party abandoned its tradition of a ``realistic,
practical, pragmatic proponent of Britain's effective membership of
the EU.''
	   ``The fantasy that it is possible to draw a line under this
debate in this or any other party after a three-week
quasi-referendum campaign is as fanciful as the fantasy that
inspired the construction of the Maginot line,'' said Howe. ``The
Maginot line was overrun, this proposition is equally likely to be
outflanked and-or overrun by events,.''
	   Lord Parkinson, the Conservative Party chairman, conceded that
the debate would continue.
	   ``It's not going to stop those people who have a different view
from expressing it, but in the future they won't be able to claim
to be speaking for the Conservative Party.''

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Teachers nationwide went on strike Monday
to protest the government's failure to pay promised raises, closing
schools and idling 7 million students.
	   The strike fueled criticism of a government beleaguered by
charges of top-level corruption and mismanagement, which has cost
President Daniel arap Moi popular support, spending by tourists and
international loans.
	   In Nairobi, riot police armed with tear-gas rifles broke up a
demonstration by a few hundred teachers, who chanted ``People
united will never be defeated.''
	   In the western Kenyan town of Rongo, police using clubs broke up
a group of teachers discussing the strike and arrested three
representatives of the Kenya National Union of Teachers.
	   The teachers fought back with stones.
	   One teacher was hospitalized, dozens of others were treated for
minor cuts and bruises and one policeman was hospitalized.
	   Elsewhere in the region, students at a primary school went on
the rampage, breaking windows at their school.
	   Moi had agreed to raise teachers' salaries by up to 200 percent
over five years before last year's election. But the government
paid just one increase before saying in July it didn't have enough
money to pay the rest.
	   Education Minister Kalonzo Musyoka said if the raises agreed on
were put into effect, 80 percent of his ministry's 1998-99 budget
of 44 billion shillings (dlrs 733 million) would go to pay
salaries.
	   David Gitari, head of the Anglican Church in Kenya, said he did
not believe the government lacked the money to pay the promised
raises, but that it had been wasted on high-level corruption.
	   ``The government made a mistake to ... not abide by the
agreement,'' Gitari said.
	   Kenya's 260,000 teachers went on strike as secondary students
were to begin their national examinations.
	   Joseph Mathenge, who teaches at Thika High School, condemned
Moi, a former grade school teacher, for reneging on his pact with
teachers.
	   ``I want to tell the president one thing, if he is unable to
manage the affairs of this country, let him quit,'' Mathenge said.
``The president says there is no money.... This country used to
have money. Where has the money gone to?''
	   ``Look at our roads here, look at our hospitals here, look at
our schools. What is left of this country?''
	   Services provided by the government have steadily declined over
the past decade while crime has risen.
	   Riot police wearing helmets and carrying batons sealed off the
headquarters of the Kenya National Union of Teachers in downtown
Nairobi.
	   ``We are not going to allow demonstrations because they will
interrupt other activities in the city and other towns,'' said
Otieno Osur, a deputy director of police.
	   In western Kisii, KNUT branch Chairman David Mokamba said
striking teachers will not be intimidated by police wielding whips
and batons.
	   Teachers who break the strike and work under police protection
risk being beaten up by angry colleagues when they return home, he
said.

Slain Mongolian democrat's colleagues call death political crime

<TEXT>
	   ULAN BATOR, Mongolia (AP) _ Mongolia's pro-democracy leaders on
Monday condemned the slaying of a government minister, calling it a
political crime intent on bringing down a fledgling democracy.
	   Leaders from the governing democrats and opposition politicians
joined 5,000 ordinary citizens thronging the square outside
parliament to mourn the killing Friday of Sanjaasuregiin Zorig, a
leader of the 1990 triumph over Soviet-sponsored communism.
	   Police refused to speculate about motives behind the killing of
the minister of infrastructure and telecommunications. But national
police chief D. Muren said a special investigative team is hunting
for the killers.
	   Police have been placed on alert and checks along Mongolia's
long, sparsely populated borders with China and Russia tightened.
	   Zorig's death shocked Mongolia's fractious political
establishment and complicated a political standoff between
democrats and former communists that has left the impoverished
country without an effective government for four months.
	   Details previously released by police suggest the crime was
planned. Zorig's killers entered his apartment Friday night, tied
up his wife and waited for him to return home. He was then stabbed
and hacked with a knife and an ax.
	   ``This was a political crime,'' Da. Ganbold, one of several
democratic politicians now under police protection, told the
mourners Monday.
	   ``The people who killed Zorig have a desire to bring down
democracy, but this will never happen,'' said fellow democrat E.
Bat Uul.
	   Most among the crowd listened stolidly without the open displays
of grief shown at an impromptu vigil in the large square Saturday
night. Although most of the dozen speakers limited their remarks to
condolences, a few sought to lay blame.
	   B. Bilegt, head of a faction within the governing Democratic
Coalition, accused right-wing nationalist groups of engineering the
killing. A leader of one group showed up in parliament last week in
a Nazi-style uniform and made threats against the government,
Bilegt said.
	   Before his death, Zorig was emerging as a compromise candidate
to end the political stalemate. The opposition began a boycott of
parliament in June, accusing the democrats of profiting from a
merger between a state bank and a private bank.
	   The government fell in late July. While the prime minister and
his cabinet have continued as caretakers, the president has refused
to approve five nominees put forward by the democrats.
	   A presidential aide said Monday the president and Zorig
discussed his possible appointment last week and his nomination
could have been approved as early as Thursday.

Mubarak lashes out at Israel on peace process

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ President Hosni Mubarak lashed out at
Israeli leaders on Monday for accusing Egypt of trying to impede
the Middle East peace process and vowed that peace would be
achieved through Egyptian efforts.
	   In an unusual attack, Mubarak _ without naming names _ described
Egypt's detractors as ``telling lies and nursing delusion.''
	   ``By these lies and illusions you deceive nobody but
yourselves,'' Mubarak said in a speech broadcast nationwide to mark
the 25th anniversary of the 1973 Arab-Israeli War.
	   ``Those who try to distort facts and divert the attention from
their intransigence by accusing Egypt, they will fail and their
schemes are doomed because they are built on fraud and cheating,''
Mubarak said.
	   Mubarak pointed out that Egypt was the first Arab state to
initiate peace talks with Israel and vowed that Egypt also will
lead the peace process to success.
	   ``Those who are nursing delusion and speak stubbornly will
sooner or later realize that as the peace process started with an
Egyptian initiative, it will succeed, God willing, with Egyptian
efforts,'' he said.
	   Israel has accused Egypt of interfering on behalf of the
Palestinians in U.S.-brokered peace talks.
	   Last month, Israel's hard-line prime minister, Benjamin
Netanyahu, dispatched his Cabinet secretary to Egypt amid Israeli
reports that Netanyahu felt Mubarak was urging Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat not to make too many concessions in negotiations.
	   Mubarak repeated his calls to Israel to give up war-won Arab
land for peace.
	   ``I repeat my advice to the Israeli people to courageously
choose between achieving peace, security and stability or the
annexation of the Palestinian lands, which the Israelis have no
right to unjustly usurp,'' he said.
	   Mubarak added that Israel should not pass up ``this historic
chance'' to conclude a peace agreement with the Palestinians.
	   He also expressed confidence that the peace talks will end with
the establishment of an independent Palestinian state.
	   Mubarak also predicted that peace will be achieved with Syria
and Lebanon.
	   ``The (1973) October War will be the flair of light which leads
to the continuation of liberating the occupied Golan (Heights) and
the strip in southern Lebanon,'' he said.
	   Israel captured the Golan from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war
and later annexed it. Syria demands the return of the plateau as a
condition for peace.
	   In Lebanon, Israeli forces occupy a border zone to protect
against guerrilla raids.
	   Mubarak said ignoring the right of self-determination and
liberation of the lands is a ``position that contradicts the
movement of history and will never survive.''

U.S. envoy Holbrooke says Kosovo situation as bad as two weeks ago
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke
said Monday the military situation in Kosovo remains critical
despite a lull in fighting and the removal of some Yugoslav tanks
and troops from the battlefield.
	   Speaking after a meeting with NATO Secretary General Javier
Solana and Supreme Allied Commander Europe Wesley K. Clark,
Holbrooke said ``while the level of fighting (in Kosovo) may have
abated temporarily, the capacity for its resumption is there.''
	   ``The situation therefore remains fully as serious today as it
was a week or two ago,'' he told reporters before flying to
Belgrade to meet with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   Holbrooke was told NATO preparations to launch military action
against Yugoslavia continued unabated and would become inevitable
without prompt action from Milosevic, who launched a crackdown
against ethnic Albanian rebels in February.
	   Holbrooke said Solana and Clark told him that ``significant
military forces, regular forces and military uniformed police,
remain in Kosovo.''
	   ``At NATO, the planning for military action is serious, intense
and sustained,'' he said.
	   Hundreds of people _ mostly ethnic Albanian civilians _ have
been killed an estimated 275,000 have been driven from their homes
in the province in Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic.
	   NATO has approved an ``activation request'' for the 16 allied
nations to formally commit warplanes and other forces for an
eventual air campaign.
	   However, the NATO Council, made up of ambassadors from the
allied nations, are no closer to the decision to launch air raids
and failed to resolve whether the alliance needs a clearer U.N.
mandate before it can attack.
	   That decision is expected to become closer after U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan presents a report Monday on Kosovo to
the Security Council.
	   Annan is expected to indicate whether the Serbs are complying
with last week's Security Council resolution, which urges a
cease-fire and threatens to consider further action if fighting
continues.

Malaysian politician-prisoner losing weight, says wife
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Before being brought to court
Monday, the man who was once Malaysia's second most powerful man
was given bread and water for lunch, his wife told reporters.
	   Anwar Ibrahim, the ousted deputy prime minister charged with 10
counts of corruption and illegal sex, told her he had lost 18
pounds (8.1 kilograms) since his Sept. 20 arrest.
	   Azizah Ismail managed only snatches of conversation with her
husband in court, and apparently did not find out why he was
wearing a neck brace after an overnight hospital checkup Saturday.
	   ``The first thing I saw this morning was the cervical collar,''
she told reporters at her home after the arraignment. ``I was very
alarmed.''
	   She demanded that the medical report of four doctors who
examined her husband be made public.
	   The prosecution asked the judge to keep it secret until police
complete an investigation of Anwar's allegation that he was beaten
unconscious the night of his arrest and denied medical attention
for days.
	   Anwar pleaded innocent to all the charges, which he had said are
politically motivated by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, and is to
face trial on four counts Nov. 2.
	   Lawyers who were allowed to speak to Anwar, 51, for the first
time in five days told Azizah her husband was kept in solitary
confinement in a cell with one light bulb.
	   She said she did not know whether Anwar, who suffers from a
spinal defect, ulcers and throat problems, was forced to sleep on
the floor of his cell.
	   Others who have been held by police without charge under the
Internal Security Act have been denied a bed.
	   Azizah said she was most upset about the way police guards
prevented her and Anwar's mother from greeting him.
	   ``He could not even kiss her goodbye,'' said Azizah.
	   While Anwar was in court, Azizah leaned forward and slipped her
hand between two policemen to stroke her husband's brow as he
waited in the dock.
	   She said she just managed to speak to him about their six
children before policeman hushed her up.
	   Under the Internal Security Act, police usually deny prisoners
the right to see or talk to relatives and attorneys.

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran has offered to mediate between Syria
and Turkey in the deepening dispute over Kurdish rebel bases and
plans to dispatch envoys to the two countries, the Tehran Times
reported Monday.
	   Egypt already has launched a mediation effort to try to prevent
a military confrontation over Turkish allegations that Syria is
harboring Turkish Kurdish rebels.
	   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak held talks Sunday with Syrian
President Hafez Assad in Damascus and was expected to visit Turkey
later this week.
	   Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi made the offer of
mediation in a telephone conversation with his Syrian counterpart,
Farouk al-Sharaa, on Sunday, said the paper, which is close to the
Foreign Ministry.
	   It did not say when Iran planned to send its emissaries.
	   Tensions between Turkey and Syria, Iran's closest Arab ally,
have escalated in recent days.
	   Ankara has sent troops to its border with Syria, prompting fears
of an attack. There have been unconfirmed reports of Turkish jets
violating Syria airspace near the border.
	   Turkish President Suleyman Demirel warned Damascus on Sunday
that Turkey would not allow its neighbor to continue sheltering
Kurdish rebels. Syria denies the allegation.
	   Turkey long has accused Syria of providing refuge to Kurdish
rebels, who have been fighting since 1984 for more autonomy for the
Kurdish population in southeastern Turkey.
	   For its part, Syria has accused Turkey of forming military
alliances with Israel that threaten Arab security and undermine
Syria's bargaining position in peace talks with the Jewish state.
	   Turkey's military alliance with Israel has been condemned by
Iran.
	   Syria also has accused Turkey of threatening its supply of water
by building dams on the Euphrates River.
	   In Jordan, Crown Prince Hassan urged Demirel in a telephone call
to ``exert all efforts to resolve the crisis without resorting to
military confrontation,'' said Information Minister Nasser Judeh.
	   Judeh said Hassan, who is acting as regent in King Hussein's
absence, also told Demirel that Jordan was ``ready to provide any
assistance'' to help resolve the dispute.

Pakistani court indicts Bhutto and husband on corruption charges
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) _ A Pakistani court Monday indicted former
prime minister Benazir Bhutto and her jailed husband Asif Ali
Zardari on charges of taking kickbacks from two Swiss companies.
	   In separate charges, a special two-member Accountability Bench
of the Lahore High Court, indicted Bhutto and Zardari for receiving
huge commissions for giving preshipment inspection contracts to two
Swiss companies _ SGS and Cotecna.
	   Bhutto has repeatedly denied these charge, saying that
corruption cases were meant to ruin her political career. She was
out of the country and was represented by her lawyers.
	   A few months back, a Swiss court had indicted Zardari and Swiss
officials of these companies for money laundering and commissions.
	   Bhutto's government was sacked by former president Farooq
Leghari in November 1996 on the charges of corruption and misrule.
	   Zardari, who was present in the court, dismissed the charges
saying they were ``incorrect'' and ``baseless''.
	   The court has set the next date of hearing on October 12.
	   Corruption charges have dogged successive governments in
Pakistan since 1988 when 11 years of military rule ended with the
mysterious air crash that killed President Gen. Mohammed Zia-ul
Haq.
	   Bhutto was ousted from power twice on corruption charges, while
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif _ her main political rival was thrown
out of power once on similar charges.
	   A British newspaper recently accused Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
of amassing a personal fortune and siphoning off millions of
dollars from the country _ the latest scandal that has jolted the
government.

Two dead, 46 wounded, in Algerian bombing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ At least two people died and another 46
were wounded when a bomb exploded Monday at a marketplace in
western Algeria, the security services said.
	   The explosion rocked a town near Mascara, 400 kilometers (250
miles) west of Algiers, the security services said in a statement.
	   No further details were immediately available, but hospital
sources, who requested customary anonymity, said the death toll
could rise since four of the injured were in critical condition.
	   The bombing was the latest violence in a six-year Islamic
insurgency triggered by a government decision to annul 1992
elections the now-banned Islamic Salvation Front was expected to
win. More than 75,000 people have been killed.

Georgia and Azerbaijan discuss route for Caspian oil
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Azerbaijani President Geidar Aliev is expected to
decide later this month on the main export route for transporting
Caspian Sea oil, a news agency said Monday.
	   Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze met in Tbilisi on Sunday
with an Azerbaijani delegation that is drawing up the route for the
main flows of Caspian oil, Interfax reported.
	   The head of the delegation, Valekh Aleskerov, told Shevardnadze
that Georgia would soon receive draft agreements on the pipeline
route. He said Aliev would make a final decision on the route this
month.
	   The first flows of Caspian oil are being transported from Baku,
Azerbaijan's capital, to the Russian port of Novorossiisk on the
Black Sea.
	   Construction of a pipeline from Baku to the Georgian Black Sea
village of Supsa and on to the Turkish port of Ceyhan is under way.
Turkey and Georgia have pressed for the bulk of the Caspian oil to
travel through that pipeline instead of through Russia.

Russia must increase use of nuclear power, minister says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS more Adamov comments in 7th graf, edits to conform.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's top atomic energy official called Monday
for the country to increase its reliance on nuclear power, a news
agency reported.
	   Atomic Energy Minister Yevgeny Adamov said nuclear power should
provide 30 to 40 percent of Russia's energy needs, up from its
present 12 percent, Interfax said.
	   ``Nuclear power engineering has advantages over the traditional
energy production methods and they should be used,'' he said at an
international conference on nuclear fuel held outside Moscow.
	   Russia already has nine nuclear power plants with 29 reactors,
as well as dozens of research reactors. Environmentalists have
warned that the risk of nuclear accidents is high at deteriorating
and underfunded facilities throughout the country.
	   Fuel is also a problem. Three of the nine plants have only
enough fuel for a week, Yevgeny Ignatenko, president of the
state-run Rosenergoatom company that runs Russia's nuclear plants,
said Monday.
	   Rosenergoatom owes 15 billion rubles (dlrs 937 million) to its
suppliers, while electricity users owe the company 18 billion
rubles (dlrs 1.1 million), the ITAR-Tass news agency quoted
Ignatenko as saying.
	   Adamov also suggested that the Russian nuclear industry export
program be revived to increase its revenues, the report said.
Western countries, led by the United States, have tried to persuade
Russia not to sell its nuclear technology abroad.
	   He called for a speedy conclusion to a dlrs 12 billion contract
over the sale of uranium to the United States. A dive in uranium
prices has led some western buyers of the Russian uranium to seek a
lower price, a move Adamov criticized as unfair.
	   ``We cannot work on such terms,'' he said, according to
Interfax.
	   Meanwhile, the Leningrad region nuclear power plant is
overhauling one of its reactors in a dlrs 300 million operation to
extend its service life and make it safer, ITAR-Tass reported
Monday.
	   The plant in Sosnovy Bor, near St. Petersburg, has already shut
down its fourth reactor and begun preparations to upgrade it. The
operation is expected to take up to a year and a half, though may
take longer for lack of funds, director Yuri Garusov said.

World cycling union defends decision to reduce doping bans for

Festina riders

<TEXT>
	   MAASTRICHT, Netherlands (AP) _ The president of cycling's
governing body Monday defended a decision to reduce the bans for
three Swiss riders who admitted during the scandal-hit Tour de
France to taking performance enhancing drugs.
	   ``For these riders, 90 percent of the season is the Tour de
France,'' said Hein Verbruggen, president of the International
Cycling Union, adding that reducing the ban by one month would give
the riders a chance to prepare for next season's Tour.
	   The cyclists, Alex Zuelle, Laurent Dufaux and Armin Meier, all
members of the Festina Team that was kicked off the Tour because of
its systematic doping policy, were handed eight-month bans by
Switzerland's cycling federation, but the International Cycling
Union (UCI) reduced the sentences to seven months which will end
May 1, 1999..
	   ``The whole Festina team really concentrates on the Tour de
France. They have already missed one Tour de France which is 90
percent of their season,'' Verbruggen said.
	   The UCI Management Committee, meeting ahead of the cycling World
Championships that begin Tuesday in Valkenburg, said the cyclists
should be credited for ``taking responsibility for their actions.''
	   The three Swiss riders all admitted taking the banned
performance enhancer EPO while with the Festina team after they
were taking in for questioning by French justice authorities..
	   Verbruggen said the seven-month sentence was appropriate due to
the specific nature of the sport and the season.
	   ``This element of specificity is fully accepted,'' Verbruggen
said, adding that a six-month ban for a cyclist could wipe out an
entire season or have virtually no effect depending on when it came
into force.
	   The management committee also agreed to set up an anti-doping
working group funded by national federations, cycling teams and
riders to help come to terms with the widespread drug abuse in the
sport.. Verbruggen will be joined on the group by representatives
of professional teams and riders. 1996 Tour de France winner Bjarne
Riis was named as one of the riders' representatives.

Iran offers to mediate between Syria, Turkey

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran has offered to mediate between Syria
and Turkey in the deepening dispute over Kurdish rebel bases and
will dispatch envoys to the two countries, the Tehran Times
reported Monday.
	   Egypt already has launched a mediation effort to try to prevent
a military confrontation over Turkey's allegations that Syria is
harboring Turkish Kurdish rebels.
	   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak held talks Sunday with Syrian
President Hafez Assad in Damascus and was expected to visit Turkey
later this week.
	   Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi made the mediation offer
Sunday in a telephone conversation with his Syrian counterpart,
Farouk al-Sharaa, said the paper, which is close to the Foreign
Ministry.
	   It did not say when Iran planned to send its emissaries.
	   Tensions between Turkey and Syria, Iran's closest Arab ally,
have escalated in recent days.
	   Ankara has sent troops to its border with Syria, prompting fears
of an attack. There have been unconfirmed reports of Turkish jets
violating Syria airspace near the border.
	   Turkish President Suleyman Demirel warned Damascus on Sunday
that Turkey would not let its neighbor continue sheltering Kurdish
rebels. Syria denies the allegation.
	   Turkey long has accused Syria of providing refuge to Kurdish
rebels, who have been fighting since 1984 for more autonomy for the
Kurdish population in southeastern Turkey.
	   For its part, Syria has accused Turkey of forming military
alliances with Israel that threaten Arab security and undermine
Syria's bargaining position in peace talks with the Jewish state.
	   Turkey's military alliance with Israel has been condemned by
Iran.
	   Syria also has accused Turkey of threatening its supply of water
by building dams on the Euphrates River.
	   In Jordan, Crown Prince Hassan urged Demirel in a telephone call
to ``exert all efforts to resolve the crisis without resorting to
military confrontation,'' said Information Minister Nasser Judeh.
	   Judeh said Hassan, who is acting as regent in King Hussein's
absence, also told Demirel that Jordan was ``ready to provide any
assistance'' to help resolve the dispute.

Ajax in talks with Belgium club on possible cooperation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Amsterdam soccer club Ajax said
Monday it is in talks with Belgium's Germinal Ekeren on a possible
cooperation pact.
	   But a spokesman declined to confirm a report in the Amsterdam
daily Het Parool that the club wants a 51 percent stake in Germinal
Ekeren, which is in the Belgian soccer league's first division.
	   Ajax spokesman Erik van Leeuwen said the talks are part of the
club's new strategy to gain a higher profile through takeovers or
cooperation with other clubs worldwide on projects ranging from
merchandising to training.
	   The strategy has been spurred on by Ajax's listing on the
Amsterdam Stock Exchange earlier this year, he added.

European soccer chiefs to examine revamp of Cup competitions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BARRY HATTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ UEFA's executive committee meets Tuesday
in the Portuguese capital to put the finishing touches on its
new-look European Champions' Cup competition in response to
proposals for a rival European Super League.
	   Officials from European soccer's governing body will choose one
of two proposed new formats for its revamped Champions' Cup
competition _ one involving 24 clubs and another with 32.
	   The shake-up was unveiled last week in Geneva by UEFA's European
Football 2000 Task Force, which was quickly set up to combat the
breakaway Super League's promise of jackpot payouts for the
continent's top clubs if they defect from UEFA.
	   UEFA's proposal offers dlrs 440-590 million in total prize
money, with the winners pocketing dlrs 44-59 million. The final
sums depend on the format chosen by the executive committee.
	   That still falls short of the dlrs 1.2 billion reportedly
promised by Media Partners, the Milan-based marketing firm behind
the Super League. UEFA's insistence on retaining control of
broadcasting and marketing rights is another snag to be overcome.
	   UEFA favors the 24-club concept because the fewer number of
games would be easier to slot into already tight soccer schedules.
UEFA is also examining the possibility of pay-per-view and pay
television to finance the new model.
	   UEFA's scramble to make its most prestigious competition more
attractive came after Media Partners moved to lure some of the
biggest names in European soccer away from the body that has run
the sport for decades.
	   Manchester United, Inter and AC Milan, Bayern Munich and
Barcelona _ clubs which draw huge television audiences and generate
millions of dollars in spin-off businesses _ are some of the clubs
targeted by Media Partners.
	   UEFA has countered in two ways _ jacking up the cash on offer
and threatening to suspend defecting clubs from the national
leagues.
	   The executive committee will also announce the venues for next
year's finals of the three UEFA club competitions: UEFA, Cup
Winners and European Champions Cup.
	   UEFA has listed 22 possible sites, separating them into 12
stadiums described as five-star and 10 four-star stadiums across
Europe.
	   The Champions Cup final will be staged in a five-star stadium,
with the other two finals at either four- or five-star venues.

	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The Kuwait Stock Exchange announced Monday it was
making second-by-second trading information available to investors
in preparation for opening the market to foreign investors.
	   Hisham al-Otaibi, general manager of the exchange, told
reporters the information was available through pagers and mobile
phones. A 300-page Internet site is to be inaugurated Nov. 15, he
said.
	   The draft of an amendment to the investments law allowing
foreigners to trade on the Kuwait exchange is expected to be
completed within two weeks, al-Otaibi said. It then will have to be
approved by the Cabinet and the 50-seat National Assembly.
	   Trading on the exchange, which lists 76 companies, currently is
limited to Kuwaiti and Gulf nationals. Hit hard by the fall in oil
prices, Kuwait has been trying to attract foreign investors and
revitalize its private sector.
	   Al-Otaibi said the two days of futures trading have been ``very
encouraging.'' The exchange introduced futures on Saturday for an
experimental period of six months.
	   He also announced that he has been appointed head of a committee
charged with setting up the Arab Clearing and Settlement Corp., to
be headquartered in Beirut, Lebanon.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Share prices and turnover fell sharply the
stock exchange in September because of political uncertainty over
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations and U.N. weapons inspections in
Iraq, brokers said Monday.
	   They said traders dealt mainly in shares of commercial banks and
service companies.
	   A market report for September said the 60-company general share
prices index declined 4.58 percent from August to 171.25 points.
	   Shares of industrial firms dropped 7.64 percent, commercial
banks 3.73 percent, service companies 3.20 percent and insurance
firms 1.02 percent, the report said.
	   It said turnover fell 46.6 percent to 19.7 million Jordanian
dinars (dlrs 27.7 million) in 22 business days ending Sept. 30.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt will sell 20 percent of its shares in
seven major electricity companies, collectively valued at dlrs 14.7
billion, Al-Ahrar daily reported Monday.
	   Half of the shares will be sold to workers at a discount of 20
percent, while the remainder will be sold on the stock market,
Al-Ahrar quoted Mohammed Morsi, head of the Workers Syndicate, as
saying. He did not give prices.
	   The companies include the Greater Cairo Electricity Co. and the
Alexandria Electricity Co. Further shares of the companies are
expected to be sold at a later date, but Morsi gave no details.
	   The sales are part of Egypt's drive to privatize its economy.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Hassan Mokhtari, managing director of the
Mahshahr special petrochemical trade zone, has invited local and
foreign companies to invest in the zone, Iran's official Islamic
Republic News Agency said Monday.
	   He told reporters at a trade fair that 1,200 hectares (nearly
3,000 acres) of land in the zone can be purchased by locals or
leased to foreigners. Joint ventures with 51 percent local
investment will be given purchase rights, he added.
	   Mokhtari said 21 projects currently were under study at the
zone, with seven finalized.
	   Mahshahr is near Imam Khomenei, a port city on the northeastern
tip of the Gulf.

	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The U.S. ambassador to Kuwait, James Larocco, has
praised steps Kuwait has taken to liberalize its economy and
attract foreign investors. But he said more reforms were needed.
	   Last May, Larocco urged Kuwait to reform its tax laws, tighten
intellectual property laws and cut on red tape.
	   ``I am happy to note that Kuwait is taking steps to address some
of these problems,'' he said in a speech Sunday at the Arab
Research Center. A transcript was provided Monday by the embassy.
	   Larocco noted that a new foreign investments law that provides
tax holidays for foreign partners has been forwarded to the 50-seat
parliament. Also, the government ``appears ready to forward a
copyright bill'' to the legislature, and some important steps have
been taken to facilitate visas for foreign investors, he said.
	   ``In a world of globalization, countries must compete for
foreign investor interest,'' the ambassador said. ``Investors may
come and look, but they will not invest unless the conditions are
favorable.''

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The Jordanian government said Monday that
there are about a million foreign workers in the country, most of
them Arabs without valid work permits.
	   The number is much higher than earlier estimates of about
300,000.
	   Interior Minister Nayef Qadi told reporters that visa exemptions
for Arabs have facilitated the entry of workers. He declined to say
if visa restrictions might be imposed to reduce the number of
illegal workers to free up jobs for Jordanians.
	   Qadi said illegal workers included 426,000 Egyptians, 130,000
Syrians and 110,000 Iraqis. The rest are Lebanese, Sudanese and
Palestinian. The bulk of the illegal workers from outside the
region come from Sri Lanka, Pakistan and the Philippines, he said.
 &UR; ___
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq has signed contracts with three
foreign companies for a million school desks, Education Minister
Fahad Salem al-Shaqra said in remarks published Monday.
	   Iraq faces a severe shortage of desks and school materials,
which it blames on U.N. trade sanctions imposed after its 1990
invasion of Kuwait.
	   Al-Shaqra said 250,000 desks already have arrived in the
country. He also said more than 1,000 computers for Iraqi schools
were scheduled to arrive soon.
	   The minister's statement was carried by the official weekly,
Nabed al-Shebab. The computers, he said, were bought from India but
he did not reveal the countries exporting desks.
	   Some 4.5 million Iraqi children returned to school last month
but government officials say up to a million of them may have to
sit on the floor for lack of desks.

Hindu caste violence kills nine in India
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Police opened fire to break up a rioting
between rival Hindu castes in southern India over the weekend. Nine
people were killed in the incidents, six from police gunfire and
three from rioting, Press Trust of India news agency reported
Monday.
	   Police arrested 35 people and charged them with violence and
looting shops in or near Ramanathapuram, a town in Tamil Nadu
state, PTI said.
	   Clashes often occur in this area between the Thevar Peravi, who
are upper caste landowners, and Dalits, the lower castes who often
are tenant farmers and say they face discrimination.
	   More than 2,000 paramilitary police forces took position in the
troubled district Monday with instructions to shoot rioters, PTI
said. Ramanathapuram is 550 kilometers (340 miles) south of Madras,
the state capital.
	   Nearly 200 people from the upper caste began a hunger strike
Monday demanding a judicial probe into police action during the
rioting that hit the district on Saturday and Sunday.
	   Police fired on a mob of lower caste Hindus Saturday night at
Tiruppullani village, 10 kilometers (six miles) from
Ramanathapuram, when they attacked members of an upper caste group.
The rioting spread to Ramannthapuram on Sunday and police again
used gunfire to control the situation, PTI said.
	   The clashes followed attacks by the upper caste community on a
Dalit rally in the region last month, police said.

Lebanon denies sheltering Kurdish rebels, backs Syria
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HUSSEIN DAKROUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanon on Monday denied it is harboring
Kurdish rebels and blamed Israel for the rising tension between
Syria and Turkey.
	   President Elias Hrawi traveled to Damascus Monday for a summit
meeting with President Hafez Assad to show Lebanon's support for
Syria.
	   Prime Minister Rafik Hariri said his country backs Syria in the
dispute which was triggered Sunday when Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel warned Damascus that his country would not allow its
neighbor to continue sheltering Kurdish rebels. Syria denied the
allegation.
	   Ankara has sent troops to its border with Syria, prompting fears
of an attack.
	   The Turkish daily Milliyet speculated Sunday that Turkey could
stage pinpoint attacks in the Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley of
eastern Lebanon, where Turkey says rebels of Abdullah Ocalan's
Kurdish Workers Party, or PKK, maintain camps.
	   Lebanese Foreign Minister Faris Bweiz said Monday there were no
Kurdish rebels based in his country.
	   ``The Turkish authorities fully know that measures had been
taken in Syria and Lebanon more than a 1{ ago to stop the
activities of any PKK member,'' Bweiz told a news conference.
	   ``We stand by Syria's side, especially in its call for resolving
disputes with Turkey in the framework of a peaceful dialogue,'' He
said.
	   Ocalan in recent years was believed to shuttle between the Bekaa
Valley and neighboring Syria.
	   Hariri said in an interview with An-Nahar daily that Turkey's
military moves were the product of its newly forged military
alliance with Israel.
	   ``The Turkish threats are the first outcome of the
Turkish-Israeli strategic alliance,'' Hariri was quoted as saying.
	   The Lebanese press also accused Israel of inflaming the
tensions.
	   ``It is brilliant Israeli intelligence versus absolute Turkish
folly,'' wrote Talal Salman, publisher of the leftist newspaper
As-Safir.

Oslo Conservatives require candidates to sign morality pledge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Politicians wanting to run for office in the
Norwegian capital on the Conservative Party ticket will have to
sign a moral pact pledging their closets are free of embarrassing
skeletons.
	   The pact is intended to keep convicted criminals and tax
cheaters off the party ticket. It does not cover personal matters
such as sexual orientation.
	   ``It is a big advantage to play with an open hand,'' said Oslo
party leader Anders Sjaastad in an interview with the Norwegian
radio network NRK.
	   ``If exposure could lead to problems for the party, then it is
better to take precautions and perhaps drop being a candidate,'' he
added.
	   The party guideline will apply for next year's local elections
in Oslo.
	   The Norwegian news media generally respect the private lives of
public figures. However, when it comes to legal and tax matters,
Norway's reporters will dig as aggressively as any in the world.
	   In recent years, a Central Bank governor and a top Labor Party
official both resigned after reports of tax improprieties.
	   Sjaastad said candidates should expect such investigations of
their financial matters, but that he hopes probes in Norway never
resemble those faced by President Bill Clinton and other public
figures in the United States.

Greece warns ``tragic results'' from Turkish-Syrian tension
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greece on Monday warned that mounting
tension between Turkey and Syria could lead to ``tragic results''
if not dealt with in its early stages.
	   ``Sources of tension are being created in our region,''
government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said. ``We will have to deal
with these sources from their birth, because they may develop out
of control and we will be led to tragic results.''
	   Greece accused Turkey of undermining the whole region's
stability through its stand-off with Syria over the alleged
harboring of Kurdish rebels.
	   ``Sadly, the tone of certain countries is not constructive,''
Reppas said. ``Turkey in particular ... repeatedly dynamites every
effort'' for the creation of a climate of regional stability.
	   Turkish troops have reportedly massed on the frontier with
Syria, while Ankara has indicated its readiness for cross-border
raids to eradicate what it claims are guerrilla bases harboring
Kurdish rebels.
	   Syria has denied the charge.
	   In the past, Turkish officials have also accused Greece of
harboring Kurdish rebels and running guerrilla training camps.
Athens denied the charge, and no evidence has been found to support
the accusations.
	   Relations between Greece and neighboring Turkey are rarely
cordial. The two NATO allies are at odds over a variety of issues,
and have twice reached the brink of war in the past 11 years over
the Aegean Sea.
	   But as neighbors, countries in the region must learn to get
along, Reppas stressed.
	   ``No one can change geographical facts,'' he said. ``As we live
in this region of the world ... we have to strive for good friendly
relations and cooperation.''

Algeria marks a first with joint maneuvers with U.S.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ The U.S.S. Mitscher, a destroyer with
America's 6th Fleet, was leaving Algiers Monday after a three-day
stopover that included joint maneuvers -- the first such operation
since this nation's independence in 1962.
	   The Sunday aero-naval maneuvers, 25 miles (40 kms) off the coast
of Sidi Fredj, west of the capital, included search and rescue
operations with the Algerian Navy. More than 430 members of the
Algerian Navy took part, officials said.
	   The joint maneuvers come amid what appears to be warming
diplomatic and commercial ties between the United States and this
North African nation, rich in gas and oil but long considered a
preserve of its former colonial ruler, France.
	   The French-language daily El Watan said the maneuvers
underscored ``the deepening degree of Algerian-American
relations.''
	   NATO's southern European commander, Adm. T. Joseph Lopez, paid a
rare visit over the summer to Algiers.
	   A delegation of the American-Algerian Chamber of Commerce
recently visited Algiers, opening an office here, a sign that
foreign concerns which have largely shunned Algeria over the past
six years are reassessing.
	   Authorities have been engaged in a violent confrontation with
Islamic extremists waging an insurgency since 1992, when the army
canceled legislative elections that a Muslim fundamentalist party
was poised to win. An estimated 75,000 people have been killed in
the continuing violence.

	   NYON, Switzerland (AP) _ The European Championships qualifying
encounter between Yugoslavia and the Republic of Ireland this
weekend will be postponed for security reasons, European soccer's
governing body UEFA announced Monday.
	   The match, due to be played Saturday in the Yugoslav capital
Belgrade, has been put off ``in view of the political situation in
Yugoslavia and the subsequent effects at international level,'' a
press release said. A UEFA spokeswoman didn't give any further
details.
	   A new date and possible change of venue will be set by the Euro
2000 organizing committee in consultation with the Irish and
Yugoslav national soccer associations, UEFA said.
	   The corresponding under-21 match between the two countries has
been postponed for the same reasons, the release said.
	   Last week, England called off an exhibition next month at
Wembley stadium against Yugoslavia because of the conflict in
Kosovo and the possibility of military intervention.

Anwar's friend to proceed with appeal against conviction

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A key witness in the government's
sexual misconduct case against Malaysia's former deputy prime
minister remains determined to appeal his conviction, his attorney
said Monday.
	   Munawar Ahmad Aness, a friend and speech writer of Anwar
Ibrahim, pleaded guilty to the charges last month, allegedly
confessing to having sex with the political dissident.
	   Anwar has said the guilty plea was coerced. Aness, a Pakistani
with permanent residence in the United States, was sentenced to six
months in jail.
	   In a move that could deal a major setback to the case against
Anwar, Aness then filed a letter of appeal through his lawyers.
	   Another letter then appeared, saying Aness would not go through
with the appeal. His lawyers say the second letter was a fraud.
	   ``His instructions are he wants us to proceed with the appeal.
There is no change,'' said Balwant Singh, one of two lawyers
defending Aness, after a meeting with Aness.
	   One of the major charges against Anwar hinges on Aness'
confession.
	   Singh spoke to reporters after attending court proceedings
Monday where Anwar's trial was fixed for Nov. 2 on corruption
charges. He said he went to a hospital to meet Aness when the court
broke for lunch.
	   Aness was jailed on Sept. 15 but moved soon after to a hospital
where he has been under treatment for heart problems.
	   ``He has given us the written retainer. He signed a notice of
appeal. We have instructions to proceed and we are proceeding,''
said Singh, adding he filed the letter of appeal in court Sept. 29.
	   Between the visits with his client, however, Aness signed
another letter saying he would not proceed with the appeal, Singh
said. That led to confusion whether Aness really wanted an appeal.
	   ``Somebody approached him and asked him to sign a typewritten
letter,'' said Singh. ``He was asked to sign it and he did.''

Adams calls for international help to resolve of Basque conflict
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Adams quotes; ADDS further background &QL; 
 &UR; By CIARAN GILES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BILBAO, Spain (AP) _ The recent cease-fire by Basque gunmen
provides a prime opportunity to resolve Spain's Basque conflict and
the international community, particularly the United States, has a
duty to help bring this about, Irish republican leader Gerry Adams
said Monday.
	   ``Powerful nations have a duty to assist, and clearly the United
States is the most powerful,'' Adams, who heads the IRA-linked Sinn
Fein party, told a press conference shortly after arriving in this
northern Basque town.
	   ``We would be calling on the international community to assist
in every situation, but especially one like the Basque country
where an initiative has been taken,'' said Adams.
	   Adams was greeted at the start of his half-day stay by some 100
Basque independence supporters waving Irish and Basque flags.
	   The Irish leader was expected to be handed a proposal for
all-party peace talks signed by Basque nationalist parties grouped
together in the so-called ``Irish Forum.''
	   The forum is hopeful Adams will pass its proposal on to
President Bill Clinton when the two meet this month. Adams
described Clinton's input into Northern Irish peace process as
``crucial and pivotal.''
	   A copy of the appeal _ credited with encouraging the armed
Basque separatist group ETA to call the truce _ has already been
sent to South African President Nelson Mandela and the United
Nations.
	   On Sept 18, ETA began an indefinite and condition-free
cease-fire in its campaign for an independent Basque state that it
hopes would unite territory in northern Spain and southwestern
France. The organization, whose name is an acronym in the Basque
language for Basque Homeland and Freedom, has killed nearly 800
people since 1968.
	   The Spanish government has long ruled out ETA's demand for a
self-determination vote for Basques.
	   The Irish Forum claimed inspiration from the Northern Ireland
peace process and its success in opening the door for a political
settlement in the troubled British province.
	   Speaking before some 50 journalists, Adams _ whose Sinn Fein
party has long had close connections with the Herri Batasuna party
allied to ETA _ called on the Spanish government to put aside its
``distrust'' of ETA and ``grasp this opportunity'' for peace.
	   Conservative Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar has insisted that
ETA must provide greater proof of its peaceful intentions before a
peace process be set in motion.
	   During his stay in the Basque country, Adams was also to visit a
Herri Batasuna member Karmelo Landa in his prison cell on the
outskirts of Bilbao.
	   Landa was jailed last December along with 22 other party leaders
convicted of collaborating with ETA for using television electoral
broadcast time to show a video in which the gunmen called for peace
talks.
	   ETA commanded considerable support in the Basque region and
elsewhere in Spain during the final years of the 1939-75
dictatorship of Gen. Francisco Franco.
	   Today, however, most people believe an armed campaign for
independence cannot be justified given the level of self-government
the Basque region enjoys since democracy returned in 1978.
	   Adams was to return to Belfast later Monday.

<TEXT>
	   MAASTRICHT, Netherlands (AP) _ The president of cycling's
governing body Monday defended a decision to reduce the bans for
three Swiss riders who admitted during the scandal-hit Tour de
France to taking performance enhancing drugs.
	   ``For these riders, 90 percent of the season is the Tour de
France,'' said Hein Verbruggen, president of the International
Cycling Union, adding that reducing the ban by one month would give
the riders a chance to prepare for next season's Tour.
	   The cyclists, Alex Zuelle, Laurent Dufaux and Armin Meier, all
members of the Festina Team that was kicked off the Tour because of
its systematic doping policy, were handed eight-month bans by
Switzerland's cycling federation, but the International Cycling
Union (UCI) reduced the sentences to seven months which will end
May 1, 1999..
	   ``The whole Festina team really concentrates on the Tour de
France. They have already missed one Tour de France which is 90
percent of their season,'' Verbruggen said.
	   The UCI Management Committee, meeting ahead of the cycling World
Championships that begin Tuesday in Valkenburg, said the cyclists
should be credited for ``taking responsibility for their actions.''
	   The three Swiss riders all admitted taking the banned
performance enhancer EPO while with the Festina team after they
were taking in for questioning by French justice authorities..
	   Verbruggen said the seven-month sentence was appropriate due to
the specific nature of the sport and the season.
	   ``This element of specificity is fully accepted,'' Verbruggen
said, adding that a six-month ban for a cyclist could wipe out an
entire season or have virtually no effect depending on when it came
into force.
	   The management committee also agreed to set up an anti-doping
working group funded by national federations, cycling teams and
riders to help come to terms with the widespread drug abuse in the
sport.. Verbruggen will be joined on the group by representatives
of professional teams and riders. 1996 Tour de France winner Bjarne
Riis was named as one of the riders' representatives.

Euro 2000 qualifying match put off for security reasons
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NYON, Switzerland (AP) _ The European Championships qualifying
encounter between Yugoslavia and the Republic of Ireland this
weekend will be postponed for security reasons, European soccer's
governing body UEFA announced Monday.
	   The match, due to be played Saturday in the Yugoslav capital
Belgrade, has been put off ``in view of the political situation in
Yugoslavia and the subsequent effects at international level,'' a
press release said. A UEFA spokeswoman didn't give any further
details.
	   A new date and possible change of venue will be set by the Euro
2000 organizing committee in consultation with the Irish and
Yugoslav national soccer associations, UEFA said.
	   The corresponding under-21 match between the two countries has
been postponed for the same reasons, the release said.
	   Last week, England called off an exhibition next month at
Wembley stadium against Yugoslavia because of the conflict in
Kosovo and the possibility of military intervention.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The United States and Russia are
ratcheting up the pressure on Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic, warning that NATO airstrikes are inevitable unless he
takes decisive action to end the crisis in Kosovo province.
	   Fearing airstrikes, Yugoslav generals put the nation's air
defense on high alert, but tried a belated compromise by moving
some tanks and other heavy equipment out of Kosovo. A Western
diplomat said up to 120 Yugoslav army armored vehicles, including
tanks, have been pulled out.
	   However, U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke said Monday that the
Kosovo situation remains critical despite a lull in fighting and
the removal of some Yugoslav tanks and troops. Holbrooke spoke in
Brussels, Belgium, en route to Belgrade to meet with Milosevic.
	   ``We hope to make clear to president Milosevic and the people of
Yugoslavia the extreme gravity of the situation,'' Holbrooke said
after a meeting with NATO leaders.
	   Holbrooke said he was told that NATO preparations continued
unabated. ``At NATO, the planning for military action is serious,
intense and sustained,'' he said.
	   Serbian police and the Yugoslav army have routed separatist
Kosovo Albanian rebels in the crackdown that began in late
February. The conflict has killed hundreds _ most of them Albanian
civilians _ and left more than 275,000 refugees. Kosovo is in
southern Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
	   Milosevic met Sunday with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov
and Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, Serbian President Milan
Milutinovic and Yugoslavia's top defense officials.
	   The Russians are against using NATO force in Kosovo. However,
Ivanov and Sergeyev said the airstrikes could occur ``if decisive
measures are not immediately taken for a radical improvement of the
situation,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin told the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   To avoid such an attack, Yugoslavia must end the hostilities,
withdraw army and security forces, take urgent measures to overcome
the humanitarian crisis, ensure that refugees can return home and
take part in peace talks, he said.
	   In Berlin, German Gen. Dieter Stoeckmann told German radio that
NATO action could come ``within days.''
	   NATO's decision may depend on a report U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan is scheduled to present Monday to the Security Council
on whether Yugoslavia is meeting U.N. demands.
	   Serb authorities appeared ready for compromise by installing an
interim government in the rebellious province in Serbia, the
dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
	   On Monday, Yugoslav Prime Minister Momir Bulatovic said the
government had accepted a Russian proposal for the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe to investigate the crisis.
Yugoslavia had repeatedly rejected such a mission until its
membership in the 54-nation organization is restored.
	   Bulatovic also claimed there was no longer any fighting in the
secessionist, majority Albanian province. He said five of the 10
special police units had been removed from Kosovo and the others
had been returned to barracks in the province.
	   A Yugoslav statement said the nation's leaders wanted the Kosovo
dispute solved peacefully, ``but in case we are attacked, we shall
defend our country with all means.''
	   One option could be for parliament to declare a state of
emergency _ a step which could lead to a general mobilization of
all military-aged men.
	   The head of Yugoslavia's other republic, Montenegro, on Monday
urged Milosevic to accept all international demands and avert a
NATO attack.
	   ``We have to avert a clash with the whole world, a confrontation
which we are bound to lose,'' Montenegro's pro-Western president,
Milo Djukanovic, said in a statement.

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Some 2,000 protesters demonstrated
outside the European headquarters of U.S. textile giant Levi
Strauss Monday, demanding that the bluejeans company overturn its
decision to close four plants in Belgium and France.
	   Levi Strauss announced last week it wants to cut some 1,560 jobs
in three Belgian and one north French factory as part of a European
restructuring plan. Unions have demanded management save at least
part of the jobs.
	   Scuffles broke out outside the European headquarters and police
had to intervene to keep protesters at bay. The company held a
European board meeting at the same time.
	   The protesters set fire to Levi's jeans' in front of the
headquarters and were throwing eggs at the front entrance.
	   The workers have been on strike since the company announced its
plans last week. Company officials said production facilities in
Belgium and France were singled out because of high labor costs and
overcapacity.
	   About 7,500 of the company's 30,000 employees are based in
Europe. The layoffs will represent about 20 percent of the
company's European staff.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Atsunori Inaba drove in two runs on a single in the
top of the fourth inning Monday as the Yakult Swallows beat the
Central League's front-running Yokohama BayStars 4-1 at Yokohama
Stadium.
	   The BayStars faced their third loss in a row, while their magic
number was unchanged at three with seven games left.
	   Katsuyuki Dobashi singled home another run in the seventh for
the Swallows, now fourth-place in the league.
	   BayStars starter Kazuo Fukumori (1-1) gave up seven hits and
four walks, while striking out one before being withdrawn after
five innings.
	   At Koshien, Makoto Imaoka, Osamu Hamanaka and Yasuaki Taiho
connected for back-to-back singles and batted in four runs in the
bottom of the fifth inning, lifting the Hanshin Tigers to a 5-2
victory over the Hiroshima Toyo Carp.
	   Tigers' starter Keiichi Yabu threw a six-hitter, while striking
out three and walking three in eight innings and picked up his 11th
victory against 10 losses.
	   Ben Rivera, formerly of the Philadelphia Phillies, allowed no
hits, struck out two and walked three in the final inning and
picked up his 26th save.
	   The Tigers are bottom-ranked and the Carp are second from the
bottom.
	   The Pacific League was idle on Monday.

Amnesty granted to jailed ANC supporter

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ A body probing apartheid human
rights abuses on Monday granted amnesty to an African National
Congress supporter jailed in 1994 for mob violence.
	   Ben Sepato Lehloo is serving nine years for being part of a mob
that in 1993 stoned the house of a man alleged to be a supporter of
the former ruling National Party. A car was also burned in the
attack at Rustenburg, near Johannesburg.
	   Lehloo was to be released from jail.
	   Set up in 1995, a year after all-race elections ended white
rule, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission is charged with
probing atrocities committed by all sides in the fight against
apartheid.
	   It can grant amnesty to those who tell the full truth about
their crimes and prove a political motive.

<TEXT>
	   BRAZZAVILLE, Republic of Congo (AP) _ Military authorities have
arrested 20 rebels linked to the country's former government that
was ousted after a civil war last year, police announced Monday.
	   The rebels, members of the Ninja force loyal to deposed
President Pascal Lissouba, were caught about 40 kilometers (25
miles) south of the capital of Brazzaville.
	   The arrests come after military officials say pockets of rebel
forces have launched a number of attacks on civilian and government
targets.
	   ``This bandit army has attacked post offices and the homes of
government officials,'' a military spokesman said on customary
condition of anonymity. One post office just outside of Brazzaville
was fire-bombed last month.
	   Although the Republic of Congo has been relatively quiet since
the end of its civil war a year ago, the recent attacks have
rekindled fears of a new round of fighting between President Denis
Sassou-Nguesso's government troops and rebel forces still loyal to
Lissouba.
	   Sassou-Nguesso, the Republic of Congo's former Marxist dictator,
lost power in elections several years ago, but fought his way back
to power after he said Lissouba had rigged preparations for
subsequent elections.
	   His Cobra militia and allied Angolan forces drove Lissouba from
power last year after he tried to disarm the militia force.

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ With the threat of NATO attack
mounting, Yugoslavia's prime minister warned Monday the nation
faces the ``immiment danger of war'' and claimed the government was
taking steps to comply with international demands for peace in
Kosovo.
	   In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said ``systematic
terror'' had been inflicted on Kosovo civilians within recent days
and that Yugoslav forces were mostly responsible.
	   But Annan said he did not ``have the means necessary to provide
an independent assessment of compliance as required by the Security
Council'' and suggested the 15 members may want to make their ``own
judgement in this respect.''
	   But U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke said the situation in
the southern Serbian province was as bad now as two weeks ago.
Holbrooke spoke in Brussels, Belgium en route to Belgrade, where he
planned to drive home to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
``the extreme gravity of the situation.''
	   Meanwhile, Yugoslavia's prime minister told an emergency session
of parliament Monday that the country ``is faced with the imminent
danger of war.'' Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the main republic
of Yugoslavia.
	   ``The threats are serious,'' Prime Minister Momir Bulatovic
said. ``And I call on this parliament to conclude that Yugoslavia
is faced with the imminent danger of war. Yugoslavia has to defend
itself if it was attacked.''
	   One option could be for parliament to declare a state of
emergency _ a step which could lead to a general mobilization of
all military-aged men.
	   In an attempt to head off NATO action, Bulatovic said the
government had accepted a Russian proposal for the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe to investigate the crisis.
	   Yugoslavia had repeatedly rejected such a mission to Kosovo
until Yugoslav membership in the 54-nation organization is
restored.
	   Bulatovic also claimed there was no longer any fighting in the
rebellious, majority Albanian province. He said five of the 10
special police units had been removed from Kosovo and the others
had been returned to barracks in the province.
	   In Brussels, however, Holbrooke made clear that half-measures
would not be enough to satisfy Washington and prevent a NATO
attack.
	   ``While the level of fighting may have abated temporarily, the
capacity for its resumption is there,'' Holbrooke said after a
meeting with NATO Secretary General Javier Solana and Supreme
Allied Commander Europe Wesley K. Clark.
	   ``The situation, therefore, remains fully as serious today as it
was a week or two ago,'' he said. ``We hope to make clear to
president Milosevic and the people of Yugoslavia the extreme
gravity of the situation.''
	   Meanwhile, the head of Yugoslavia's other republic, Montenegro,
called on Milosevic to accept all international demands and avert a
NATO attack.
	   ``We have to avert a clash with the whole world, a confrontation
which we are bound to lose,'' Montenegro's pro-Western president,
Milo Djukanovic, said in a statement.
	   Djukanovic, a staunch Milosevic critic, called on the Yugoslav
president to address the nation ``with an unambiguous message''
that he has accepted all U.N. resolutions and agreements he made
with Russian President Boris Yeltsin.
	   Djukanovic blamed Yugoslavia's problems on Milosevic's
``undemocratic regime.''
	   Fearing airstrikes, Yugoslav generals put the nation's air
defense on high alert and moved some tanks and other heavy
equipment out of Kosovo. A Western diplomat said up to 120 Yugoslav
army armored vehicles, including tanks, have been pulled out.
	   Belgrade had been counting on Russia to block any
U.N.-sanctioned military moves by the Western Alliance. On Sunday,
Milosevic met with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and Defense
Minister Igor Sergeyev, Serbian President Milan Milutinovic and
Yugoslavia's top defense officials.
	   Although the Russians are against using NATO force in Kosovo,
Ivanov and Sergeyev said the airstrikes could occur ``if decisive
measures are not immediately taken for a radical improvement of the
situation,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin told the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   To avoid such an attack, Yugoslavia must end the hostilities,
withdraw army and security forces, take urgent measures to overcome
the humanitarian crisis, ensure that refugees can return home and
take part in peace talks, he said.
	   In Berlin, German Gen. Dieter Stoeckmann told German radio that
NATO action could come ``within days.''
	   Serb authorities appeared ready for compromise by installing an
interim government in the rebellious province in Serbia, the
dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
	   Serbian police and the Yugoslav army have routed separatist
Kosovo Albanian rebels in the crackdown that began in late
February. The conflict has killed hundreds _ most of them Albanian
civilians _ and left more than 275,000 refugees.
	   Ethnic Albanians compromise 90 percent of the province's 2
million-strong population, and most favor independence or
substantial self-rule.
	   Momentum for outside involvement has increased in the past week
amid revelations of massacres of ethnic Albanian civilians in the
forests of Kosovo.
	   Although the United States and Europeans want an end to the
fighting, they also oppose independence for Kosovo, fearing that
could destabilize other Balkan countries with Albanian populations.
	   In the Kosovo capital Pristina, the KLA offered to help NATO
forces if asked. KLA spokesman Jakup Krasniqi said in a statement
published Monday by the Albanian language newspaper Bujku that ``we
wish they (airstrikes) would become reality'' and ``we shall
provide assistance... if it is asked of us.''
	   Krasniqi accused ethnic Albanian politicians of having ``given
up on independence'' and having become ``the servants of the
enemy,'' by agreeing to accept autonomy but not independence.
	   Ethnic Albanian political leaders have rejected the new interim
government, which was drawn up without their participation. The
council is composed of seven Serbs, five ethnic Albanians and the
rest Turks and Muslims.

EU accelerates talks with `fast-track' candidates, including

	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ The European Union nations agreed Monday to
accelerate enlargement talks with five eastern neighbors and Cyprus
but ignored a demand by France and the Netherlands that Cyprus must
be cautioned it can only join if it first ends its division.
	   ``We want a political solution for the island under the aegis of
the United Nations,'' said Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang
Schuessel, whose country holds the EU presidency, said during an EU
foreign ministers meeting.
	   He reiterated the EU's stated view that simply starting
enlargement talks was bound to have a spillover effect and
``facilitate a political settlement'' of Cyprus' division.
	   Also Monday, the foreign ministers asked the European Commission
to ``reassess'' its 1993 approval of Malta's 1990 membership
application. The Mediterranean island nation reapplied Sept. 11
after its previous government put EU membership on ice.
	   They also welcomed the recent election victory of opposition
parties in Slovakia, saying they hoped for a restoration of full
democracy there after six years of autocratic rule by Prime
Minister Vladimir Meciar.
	   Schuessel told reporters ``screening'' talks to date with
Cyprus, Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Estonia and Slovenia
are going well enough to accelerate the negotiations with these
countries on Nov. 10.
	   France and the Netherlands wanted a caution to Cyprus, that it
can only join if it is first reunified. The foreign ministers did
not act on the Franco-Dutch request.
	   Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded
the north following an abortive coup by elements favoring union
with Greece. Turkish Cypriots have declared their own Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus, labeled illegal by the United Nations
and recognized only by Turkey.
	   Cyprus' Greek Cypriot government and those of the five East
European nations opened ``screening'' talks with the EU in March.
	   To become an EU member, candidates must adopt the entire
spectrum of EU rules, regulations and laws. These cover 31 chapters
_ from agriculture, energy, foreign affairs and monetary union to
corporate and banking laws, consumer health protection and
telecommunications standards and practices.
	   Estonia has said by 2002 or 2003 it will be EU-compatible in 12
chapters, Hungary in 11. Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovenia and
Cyprus say they will comply with seven chapters by then.
	   The recommendation to start more detailed talks came in a report
from the EU Commission. The EU has not fixed an entry date for any
of the six ``fast-track'' candidates.
	   In addition, Lithuania, Latvia, Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria
are also in line to join, albeit much later.

10-hour blaze damages crude oil depot, pipeline
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A crude oil depot south of the Egyptian
capital Cairo exploded on Monday after catching fire, and the
flames also damaged the Sumed pipeline.
	   Army forces joined Egyptian firefighters in a 10-hour battle to
put out the flames at the depot, which is about 60 kilometers (37
miles) south of Cairo, police said. They spoke on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   No one was injured, they said.
	   The valves leading to depot were closed to help stop the fire,
police said. They said the values would remain closed until repairs
were completed.
	   Police are investigating the cause of the blaze.
	   The depot belonged to the Sumed pipeline, which carries Gulf oil
from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean. The pipeline is jointly
owned by Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and
Qatar.

Talks on governing Lesotho turn to interim rule
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with military statement on discipline with 3 grafs at
end &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ The governing and opposition parties of
Lesotho opened negotiations Monday at loggerheads over who will
govern the country until early elections in 15 to 18 months.
	   The talks, brokered by representatives of the Southern African
Development Community, followed last month's military intervention
by South Africa troops to quell unrest and restore the government's
authority.
	   The intervention, under the auspices of the SADC, led to massive
destruction of the capital and the deaths of scores of people in
the mountain kingdom of 2 million people.
	   The Lesotho Democratic Congress party, which swept last May's
elections, says it will not form a government of national unity
until the next balloting, South African Press Association reported.
	   The opposition parties are demanding a role in the interim
administration. They accuse the government of stealing the last
election.
	   The parties reported progress on Friday, when they tentatively
agreed to the new elections.
	   Hundreds of South African soldiers are still based in Lesotho.
Responding to news reports that some have engaged in looting, rape
and mistreatment of civilians, the military command in Pretoria
acknowledged that ``the actions of individuals are jeopardizing the
reputation of the entire force.''
	   However, it said the military was ``generally satisfied'' with
discipline and that morale was ``very good.''
	   It gave no details on any incidents.

Thousands celebrate opening of Islamic court in south Mogadishu
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By OSMAN WEHELIYE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ Thousands of people cheered the
opening Monday of the third Islamic court in the southern half of
the war-torn Somali capital as concern grows over increased
lawlessness and rogue militiamen who extort money from business
people.
	   Sheikh Aden Abdulle Weyrah, one of the judges at the new court,
said its first objective was to do away with the scores of
roadblocks set up by the rogue militias along the highway heading
south out of Mogadishu to Afgoie and southern Somalia.
	   The court is sponsored by the Eyr sub-subclan, believed to be
the largest in the Habir Gedir clan of warlord Hussein Mohammed
Aidid.
	   Since Aidid's late father, Gen. Mohammed Farah Aidid, and Ali
Mahdi Mohammed, now a north Mogadishu warlord, joined forces to
oust dictator Mohamed Siad Barre in 1991, there has been no
national state or administration in the nation in the Horn of
Africa.
	   Islamic courts established in north Mogadishu and in other towns
have succeeded in reducing the number of armed robberies and other
economic crimes. They have also been successful in adjudicating
problems of marriage, family and inheritance.
	   They have had less or no success in dealing with political
disputes.
	   The courts appoint their own police _ usually militiamen
associated with the sub-subclan that sets up the court.
	   Abdullahi Dhimbil, chairman of a local truckers committee, said
the owners of the 1,800 trucks in the group are prepared to donate
3,000 assault rifles and funds to help the court get rid of the
roadblocks.
	   Some armed checkpoints still operate in Mogadishu, but they are
generally manned by militiamen loyal to Aidid, Ali Mahdi or some
other senior warlord.
	   Aidid and Ali Mahdi have created a joint administration for the
city on the Indian Ocean that would facilitate the re-opening of
the international port and airport.
	   But some militiamen and minor warlords, fearful of losing out on
the benefits of the joint administration, have taken to extortion
and kidnapping to obtain funds.
	   Last week, the Roman Catholic Missionaries of Consolation
announced they were pulling their three remaining nursing sisters
out of Mogadishu because of the rising insecurity.
	   The three had performed vital maternal and child health services
at the SOS Hospital.

No progress made in negotiations for new Cambodian government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Delegates from Cambodia's bickering
political parties reported no progress Monday in the latest round
of negotiations aimed at forming the next government.
	   Both Cambodian leader Hun Sen's ruling party and the two-party
opposition said after the talks, however, that the atmosphere of
the meeting was constructive and both sides had the opportunity to
fully express their positions.
	   Opposition negotiator Pok Than described the negotiations as
``close to deadlock'' and said his FUNCINPEC party and the ruling
Cambodian People's Party continued to argue over which side should
hold the presidency of parliament.
	   ``We agreed to disagree. There are still many differences,'' Pok
Than said.
	   Cambodian People's Party delegate Sok An was slightly more
optimistic.
	   ``I think there was some progress because we now have put all
our cards on the table,'' he said.
	   The three parties maintained the same positions they have held
since Hun Sen's party won the July 26 national election.
	   The ruling party, winners of a majority in parliament but not
the two-thirds necessary to form the government alone, is eager to
see a new coalition government installed.
	   But the two-party opposition claims that Hun Sen's electoral
victory was achieved through fraud and intimidation. The parties
insist that their allegations must be thoroughly investigated
before the parliament holds its first official meeting.
	   Hun Sen's side has pushed for the National Assembly to hold its
first official session Wednesday to designate leadership positions
in the parliament, including the presidency.
	   FUNCINPEC, which holds the interim position of parliamentary
dean because it has the oldest member of the new parliament, argued
that parliament should not open until after the next round of talks
scheduled for Friday, Pok Than said.
	   The opposition entered Monday's talks with demands for two
Cambodian princes and three generals loyal to the opposition to
receive pardons for convictions handed down by courts widely seen
as controlled by Hun Sen.
	   The two parties also called for a general amnesty to be declared
for all opposition politicians and supporters who face court action
for their roles in antigovernment demonstrations organized after
the election.
	   Hun Sen's side argued it should be given the parliament
presidency, one of the two vice president positions and
chairmanships of five of nine parliamentary commissions, Pok Than
said.
	   Both FUNCINPEC and the junior opposition party led by former
Finance Minister Sam Rainsy rejected the proposal.
	   The president of parliament controls legislative sessions and
becomes acting head of state when King Norodom Sihanouk is outside
the country.
	   Sihanouk, whose mediating efforts helped bring the three parties
to the bargaining table last month, delayed a planned trip to
Beijing for medical treatment and arrived in Phnom Penh on Monday.
	   The king hosted two rounds of negotiations at his Siem Reap
residence that led to the ceremonial convening of parliament on
Sept. 24. However, he did not take part in Monday's talks.

Lebanon denies sheltering Kurdish rebels, backs Syria

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanon on Monday denied it is harboring
Kurdish rebels and blamed Israel for the rising tension between
Syria and Turkey.
	   President Elias Hrawi traveled to Damascus Monday for a summit
meeting with President Hafez Assad to show Lebanon's support for
Syria.
	   Prime Minister Rafik Hariri said his country backs Syria in the
dispute which was triggered Sunday when Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel warned Damascus that his country would not allow its
neighbor to continue sheltering Kurdish rebels. Syria denied the
allegation.
	   Ankara has sent troops to its border with Syria, prompting fears
of an attack.
	   The Turkish daily Milliyet speculated Sunday that Turkey could
stage pinpoint attacks in the Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley of
eastern Lebanon, where Turkey says rebels of Abdullah Ocalan's
Kurdish Workers Party, or PKK, maintain camps.
	   Lebanese Foreign Minister Faris Bweiz said Monday there were no
Kurdish rebels based in his country.
	   ``The Turkish authorities fully know that measures had been
taken in Syria and Lebanon more than 1 1/2 years ago to stop the
activities of any PKK member,'' Bweiz told a news conference.
	   Ocalan in recent years was believed to shuttle between the Bekaa
Valley and neighboring Syria.
	   ``We stand by Syria's side, especially in its call for resolving
disputes with Turkey in the framework of a peaceful dialogue,''
Hariri said in an interview with An-Nahar daily.
	   He said Turkey's military moves were the product of its newly
forged military alliance with Israel.
	   ``The Turkish threats are the first outcome of the
Turkish-Israeli strategic alliance,'' Hariri was quoted as saying.
	   The Lebanese press also accused Israel of inflaming the
tensions.
	   ``It is brilliant Israeli intelligence versus absolute Turkish
folly,'' wrote Talal Salman, publisher of the leftist newspaper
As-Safir.

	   Annan said the humanitarian situation was rapidly deteriorating
and he demanded an end to the hostilities between Serb forces and
ethnic Albanians who are fighting for independence in the southern
Serb province.
	   ``In the last few weeks, the international community has
witnessed appalling atrocities in Kosovo, reminiscent of the recent
past elsewhere in the Balkans,'' Annan wrote.
	   ``It is clear beyond any reasonable doubt that the great
majority of such acts have been committed by security forces in
Kosovo acting under the authority of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia.''
	   He noted that ethnic Albanian forces have also been fighting,
and said there was reason to believe that they were responsible for
atrocities as well.
	   Serbia is the larger of two republics comprising Yugoslavia, and
Milosevic launched a crackdown in February against
independence-seeking rebels in Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians
constitute 90 percent of the population. Hundreds have died in the
fighting and 275,000 have been routed from their homes.
	   The west is opposed to independence for Kosovo, but wants
Milosevic to return the autonomy he stripped from the province in
1989.

	   BILBAO, Spain (AP) _ The recent cease-fire by Basque gunmen
provides a prime opportunity to resolve Spain's conflict and the
international community, particularly the United States, has a duty
to help bring about a resolution, Irish republican leader Gerry
Adams said Monday.
	   ``Powerful nations have a duty to assist, and clearly the United
States is the most powerful,'' said Adams, who heads the Sinn Fein
party, linked with the Irish Republican Army.
	   ``We would be calling on the international community to assist
in every situation, but especially one like the Basque country
where an initiative has been taken,'' Adams said shortly after
arriving in the northern Basque town of Bilbao.
	   A group Basque parties seeking a Basque homeland were expected
to hand Adams a proposal for all-party peace talks. The group,
known as the Irish Forum, claimed inspiration from the Northern
Ireland peace process and its success in opening the door for a
political settlement in the troubled British province.
	   The forum is hopeful Adams will pass its proposal on to U.S.
President Bill Clinton when the two meet this month. Adams
described Clinton's input into Northern Irish peace process as
``crucial and pivotal.''
	   A copy of the appeal _ credited with encouraging the armed
Basque separatist group ETA to call the truce _ has already been
sent to South African President Nelson Mandela and the United
Nations.
	   On Sept 18, ETA began an indefinite and cease-fire in its
campaign for an independent Basque state that it hopes would unite
territory in northern Spain and southwestern France. The
organization, whose name is an acronym in the Basque language for
Basque Homeland and Freedom, has killed nearly 800 people since
1968.
	   The Spanish government has long rejected ETA's demand for a
self-determination vote for Basques.
	   Adams was greeted by 100 Basque independence supporters waving
Irish and Basque flags.
	   Speaking before some 50 journalists, Adams _ whose Sinn Fein
party has long had close connections with the Herri Batasuna party
allied to ETA _ called on the Spanish government to put aside its
``distrust'' of ETA and ``grasp this opportunity'' for peace.
	   Conservative Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar has insisted that
ETA must provide greater proof of its peaceful intentions before a
peace process be set in motion.
	   During his stay in the Basque country, Adams was also to visit a
Herri Batasuna member Karmelo Landa in his prison cell outside
Bilbao.
	   Landa was jailed last December along with 22 other party leaders
convicted of collaborating with ETA for using television electoral
broadcast time to show a video in which the gunmen urged peace
talks.
	   ETA commanded considerable support in the Basque region and
elsewhere in Spain during the final years of the 1939-75
dictatorship of Gen. Francisco Franco.
	   Today, however, most people believe an armed campaign for
independence cannot be justified given the level of self-government
the Basque region enjoys since democracy returned in 1978.
	   Adams was to return to Belfast later Monday.

Explosion kills Israeli soldier, injures 4 others
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ Guerrillas detonated roadside bombs in
southern Lebanon on Monday, killing an Israeli soldier and injuring
four others, Lebanese security officials said.
	   Hezbollah, the Shiite Muslim guerrilla group fighting Israeli
forces in the south, claimed responsibility, saying its fighters
simultaneously detonated two bombs as an Israeli convoy was
passing.
	   A statement from the group said the targeted road linked bases
manned by Israeli troops and their allied South Lebanon Army
militia.
	   There was no immediate comment from Israel on the incident.
	   The Lebanese officials, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity, said the Israelis were in a vehicle on the main road
leading into the town of Hasbaya when the bombs exploded at 3 p.m.
(1200 GMT).
	   The casualties were first brought to Marjayoun, the main town in
the Israeli-occupied zone, and later taken to Israel, the officials
said.
	   Hezbollah and other Lebanese guerrillas groups are fighting to
oust Israel from its self-styled ``security zone'' in southern
Lebanon.
	   Israel established the border enclave in 1985 to try to prevent
cross-border guerrilla attacks.

	   The United States warned Milosevic on Friday that NATO will
strike Serb targets within two weeks unless he complies with every
U.N. demand to halt his assault on ethnic Albanians, allow relief
to refugees and negotiate peace.
	   In its last resolution, on Sept. 23, the 15-member U.N. Security
Council renewed the demands and threatened unspecified other
measures if both sides failed to abide.
	   Since then, photos and reports of a massacre of ethnic Albanians
have been published around the world, heightening calls for
military intervention and placing the justification squarely on
what Annan says Monday.
	   Expressing the urgency of the situation, the council urged the
U.N. chief to speed up his report _ originally expected midweek _
to Monday, so they could begin discussions on it as early as
Tuesday.
	   In his report, the U.N. chief called for the safe return of
refugees, the withdrawal of Milosevic's special police units and a
negotiated settlement.
	   Serb forces have the duty to maintain public order, he said.
``However, this can in no way justify the systematic terror
inflicted on civilians these past few days and weeks.''
	   He concluded by saying that he shared the sense of indignation
and revulsion at what has been happening in Kosovo. But he called
for the international community to ``never lose sight of the
ultimate need for a comprehensive political solution.
	   ``Otherwise, we shall be treating only the symptoms of the
problem, and not its causes,'' he wrote.
	   Britain is preparing ground troops and armored units for Kosovo,
to be deployed in a post-airstrike peacekeeping role, London's
Sunday Telegraph reported. The defense ministry refused to confirm
or deny the report but repeated Britain was ready to participate in
a NATO attack.
	   Permanent council members Russia and China have flatly objected
to any military intervention in Kosovo, and could veto any
resolution specifically authorizing force. China abstained from the
Sept. 23 resolution.
	   Nevertheless, the United States has said it already has the
authority to strike Milosevic without any more council action _ and
Britain's reported preparations indicate a similar position.

Earl Spencer's ex-wife sues London law firm over divorce
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The ex-wife of Earl Spencer, Princess Diana's
brother, is trying ``for a second bite of the cherry'' in suing the
law firm that advised her before her divorce, the firm argued in
court Monday.
	   The London-based Family Law Consortium, which did not handle the
South African divorce hearing when a 1.8 million pound (dlrs 3
million) settlement was reached in December, say Countess Spencer's
attempt to sue them for negligence is an abuse of court process and
should be thrown out.
	   The 1.6 million pound (dlrs 2.7 million) negligence suit by the
former Victoria Lockwood said she had hired the attorneys to
``contain the distress'' of the divorce proceedings, which she
wanted to be over as quickly and privately as possible.
	   Instead, ``one of the most public divorce hearings ever recorded
took place, with the world's press in general and the British press
in particular covering every detail of the proceedings,'' the suit
said.
	   Lady Spencer claims that if David Hodson, one of the firm's
lawyers, had advised her to sue for divorce sooner and in Britain
she could have won 3.75 million pounds (dlrs 6.4 million) in
London, where the press would have been excluded from the hearing
and publicity kept to a minimum.
	   Lady Spencer, 33, was married to Spencer for eight years. They
have four children.
	   They both have homes in Cape Town although Spencer has spent
more time at the family's ancestral home in England since Diana was
killed in a car crash last year.

Lebanon denies sheltering Kurdish rebels, backs Syria

 &UR; By HUSSEIN DAKROUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanon on Monday denied it is harboring
Kurdish rebels and blamed Israel for the rising tension between
Syria and Turkey.
	   President Elias Hrawi traveled Monday to Damascus to show
Lebanon's support for Syrian in a meeting with Syrian President
Hafez Assad.
	   Prime Minister Rafik Hariri said his country backs Syria in the
dispute triggered Sunday when Turkish President Suleyman Demirel
warned Damascus that his country would not let its neighbor
continue sheltering Kurdish rebels. Syria denied the allegation.
	   Ankara has sent troops to its border with Syria, prompting fears
of an attack.
	   The Turkish daily Milliyet speculated Sunday that Turkey could
stage pinpoint attacks in the Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley of
eastern Lebanon, where Turkey says rebels of Abdullah Ocalan's
Kurdish Workers Party, or PKK, maintain camps.
	   Lebanese Foreign Minister Faris Bweiz said Monday there were no
Kurdish rebels based in his country.
	   ``The Turkish authorities fully know that measures had been
taken in Syria and Lebanon more than 1 1/2 years ago to stop the
activities of any PKK member,'' Bweiz told a news conference.
	   Ocalan in recent years was believed to shuttle between the Bekaa
Valley and neighboring Syria.
	   ``We stand by Syria's side, especially in its call for resolving
disputes with Turkey in the framework of a peaceful dialogue,''
Hariri said in an interview with An-Nahar daily.
	   He said Turkey's military moves were the product of its newly
forged military alliance with Israel.
	   ``The Turkish threats are the first outcome of the
Turkish-Israeli strategic alliance,'' Hariri was quoted as saying.

Italian premier struggles to save government
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMS. LEADS throughout to UPDATE with address to Parliament
expected Wednesday; vote of confidence possibly Friday. &QL; 
 &UR; With AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By ELLEN KNICKMEYER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Premier Romano Prodi said Monday he would appeal
directly to Parliament to save Italy's second-longest government
since World War II, threatened with collapse by the defection of
its Communist ally.
	   The address to Parliament was expected Wednesday, followed
perhaps by Friday by the vote of confidence that will determine
whether Prodi's 2{-year-old, center-left alliance stands or falls.
	   Prodi's far-left ally, the Communist Refoundation Party,
provoked the crisis by withdrawing its support over the weekend and
saying it would not vote for his deficit-cutting 1999 budget, which
is vital to Italy's participation in the European common currency.
	   Prodi has said he would call a confidence vote if he lost the
Communists' support.
	   ``I've always acted with coherence,'' Prodi said before a
morning meeting with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro on the crisis.
``I've never changed strategy and I don't want to do political
gymnastics.''
	   The break with Prodi's government divided Refoundation. Armando
Cossuta, leader of the moderate wing, resigned as party president
Monday.
	   He said the party's desertion of Prodi was ``wrong and
dangerous,'' but at the same time promised to follow the party
line.
	   ``We are in a very complicated political crisis which could lead
to early elections,'' Cossuta told reporters Monday. ``And with the
divisions in the left, this would mean a victory for the right.''
	   If the crisis comes to a confidence vote and Prodi loses, he
would offer his resignation. Once he does that, it is up to
Scalfaro to decide what to do. He could ask Prodi or someone else
to form a new government or he could call elections 2 1/2 years
early, something most analysts think unlikely.
	   Working in Prodi's favor is the fact that few parties think they
would stand to gain by early elections, including the Communist
Refoundation. There was speculation Prodi would reopen negotiations
that would win back the communists' grudging support, as he has
managed to do in the past.
	   Prodi's government has held together this long in large part
because of the widely shared desire to see Italy qualify for
participation in the 1999 debut of Europe's common currency, the
euro. That happened earlier this year _ leaving the disparate
allies without so clear a reason to stay together.
	   Prodi leads Italy's 55th government since World War II. He has
outlasted all but Bettino Craxi, who served 3{ years in two
back-to-back stints from 1982 to 1986.
	   Refoundation is not part of Prodi's center-left coalition, but
the government needs its 34 votes to muster a majority in the lower
house. It has been a difficult ally from the outset.
	   It broke with Prodi over NATO expansion earlier this year and on
sending troops into Albania last year. Prodi was even forced to
resign a year ago after a bitter battle over spending cuts linked
to the euro. The crisis was resolved, and Prodi returned to work,
after he made steep concessions and promised a 35-hour work week.

Fergie makes debut as British TV chat show hostess
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ She's had problems, and so, too, have they. And
the Duchess of York is sharing it all in her debut as a chat show
host on British television which aired Monday.
	   So far, the former Sarah Ferguson, ex-wife of Prince Andrew, has
confined her paid TV appearances to the United States _ for fear of
causing more upset in the royal family.
	   But ``Sarah ... Surviving Life,'' 10 one-hour shows commissioned
by Sky TV, was launched with a rash of promotional newspaper
interviews in which she discussed her current boyfriend, a
still-married Italian count, her financial affairs, and her refusal
to move out of a wing of Andrew's house where she lives with their
two daughters.
	   On the show, Fergie, as she is popularly known, sat on a couch
dressed in a black trouser suit and discussed life's crises with
guests who included a woman who was raped by serial killer Fred
West and a hit-and-run driver who had confessed 20 years later.
	   ``You might wonder why I qualify to present a show about
surviving life,'' the 38-year-old duchess told viewers at the start
of the show. ``After all, I have led a very charmed life _ there
have been huge ups but there have been some huge downs.''
	   In newspaper interviews published Monday, Fergie said she is
giving her 50,000-pound (dlrs 85,000) fee for the series to
charity. Sky said she would, however, get the money for the foreign
rights. The company gave no estimate of the sum.
	   And in an apparent mark of royal reconciliation, Prince Charles
invited Fergie to attend a dinner party Monday night at his country
estate, Highgrove. Aides said Andrew would go too.
	   The duchess dedicated Monday's TV show to her mother, Susan
Barrantes, 61, who was killed Sept. 19 in a car accident in
Argentina.
	   ``Mum taught me so much about how to survive life,'' she said in
an introduction to the program.
	   In interviews, the duchess said she had cleared her debts _
reportedly 4 million pounds (dlrs 6.8 million) after her 1996
divorce from Andrew, but needs to keep earning for taxes, and to
ensure an income after her contract with Weight-Watchers in the
United Stares runs out.
	   Queen Elizabeth II recently bought a 1.5 million pound (dlrs
2.55 million) house in the names of the children, Princess
Beatrice, 10, and Princess Eugenie, 8. But Fergie refuses to move
there with the children, saying she can't afford it, and is looking
for a better divorce settlement from the queen..
	   On her latest beau, Count Gaddo della Gherardesca, who she has
visited regularly this summer, the duchess said, ``there is
certainly no engagement.''
	   ``Yes, of course he is my boyfriend and we are very close, yes,
and I love Italy,'' the duchess was quoted as adding. ``But I am
also, as you know, very close to Andrew and I'm not sure Andrew's
going to be too pleased about it.''

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Three weeks before a summit of European
Union leaders in Austria, Germany doesn't know whom it's sending.
	   Gerhard Schroeder won't be going to the Oct. 24-25 session in
the lakeside resort of Poertschach because he won't be officially
sworn in as Germany's new chancellor until Oct. 27.
	   And anyway, he has to attend a meeting of his Social Democratic
party on Oct. 25, spokesman Uwe-Karsten Heye said Monday.
	   Outgoing Chancellor Helmut Kohl will still be head of
government, but most likely won't go either, his office said.
	   Reports that Kohl's foreign minister, Klaus Kinkel, would make
the trip went unconfirmed. ``I can't say at this moment,'' Kinkel
said in Luxembourg on Monday when asked.

Protesters demonstrate against planned plant closures in Belgium,

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Some 2,000 protesters demonstrated
Monday outside the European headquarters of U.S. textile giant Levi
Strauss and Co., demanding a reversal of the apparel maker's plan
to close four plants in Belgium and France.
	   Levi Strauss announced last week it wants to cut some 1,560 jobs
in three Belgian and one French factory as part of a European
restructuring plan. Unions have demanded management save at least
part of the jobs.
	   Scuffles broke out outside the European headquarters and police
had to intervene to keep protesters at bay. The company held a
European board meeting at the same time.
	   The workers have been on strike since the company announced its
plans last week. Company officials said production facilities in
Belgium and France were singled out because of high labor costs and
overcapacity.
	   About 7,500 of the company's 30,000 employees are based in
Europe. The layoffs will represent about 20 percent of the
company's European staff.

Sales of cholesterol-blocking margarine swells company's profit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Raisio Group increased its eight-month
pretax profit this year by more than 15 percent, to 192 million
markkaa (dlrs 37.6 million), mainly due to sales of its
cholesterol-blocking margarine, the company said Monday.
	   Net sales from January to August also increased, to 3.4 billion
markkaa (dlrs 658 million), from 3.2 billion markkaa during the
same period last year.
	   The operating profit of the Benecol division, which makes the
cholesterol-blocking bread spread, more than tripled to 140 million
markkaa (dlrs 27.5 million), up from 37 million markkaa in 1997.
	   Raisio, one of Finland's largest food, animal feed and chemical
groups, is best known for Benecol that inhibits the absorption of
the health-threatening form of cholesterol.
	   It introduced Benecol in 1995, but sales of the margarine had
been limited to Finland for more than two years due to a shortage
of the key raw material, plant sterol, a fat-soluble plant alcohol.
	   Now, the company is increasing the production of plant sterol at
Raisio, and plans to build a factory near Charleston, South
Carolina, to manufacture the heart-friendly margarine's key
ingredient. The plant is expected to be ready in early 1999.
	   Last year, Raisio increased its pretax profit by 25 percent to
208.5 million markkaa (dlrs 40.8 million), and net sales grew to
4.9 billion markkaa (dlrs 960 million).
	   The company employs 2,880 people in 14 countries.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's prime minister has accepted J.B.
Jeyaretnam's offer to pay him defamation damages in installments,
allowing the opposition politician to avoid bankruptcy and retain
his Parliament seat.
	   The High Court awarded Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong 100,000
Singapore dollars (dlrs 59,200) in damages in a defamation lawsuit
against the Worker's Party chief last year.
	   Jeyaretnam, who has been sued repeatedly by various government
ministers, said he was unable to pay unless in installments.
	   After an impasse over Goh's offer to waive the award in exchange
for an apology, the prime minister began taking steps to declare
Jeyaretnam bankrupt in August. Under Singapore law, Jeyaretnam
would have lost his seat in the 84-member Parliament, where only
three opposition members sit.
	   Allen and Gledhill, the law firm representing Goh, said in a
statement that the prime minister had agreed to accept the payments
``in five equal monthly installments.''
	   The law firm also said the petition to bankrupt the opposition
leader will be dropped ``pending full payment by Mr. Jeyaretnam.''
	   Jeyaretnam told The Associated Press he will pay the first
installment Tuesday. But he acknowledged that fears of bankruptcy
remained.
	   His legal costs are estimated at about 150,000 Singapore dollars
(dlrs 88,800).
	   ``There's the costs, and of course there are seven other suits
lined up against me,'' he said, referring to other lawsuits filed
by other ministers and politicians from the ruling People's Action
Party.
	   The Goh lawsuit stemmed from Jeyaretnam's statement during an
election rally in 1996 that another Worker's Party leader had filed
a police report against ``Goh and his people.''
	   Even though the statement was accurate, Jeyaretnam lost the
defamation case. A lower court ruled the statement contained
defamatory innuendo, and the appeals court increased the amount of
damages, saying he acted in malice.
	   This year's U.S. State Department Human Rights Report cited the
case as an example of the Singapore government using legal
processes such as libel and defamation lawsuits to stifle freedom
of speech and intimidate the political opposition.
	   Amnesty International and the International Commission of
Jurists have also criticized the case. But Singapore has defended
its legal and political system and rejected the criticism.

U.N. not ready to resume full operations in Tajikistan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ The United Nations will not resume
full operations in Tajikistan until the investigation into the
killings of four U.N. workers is completed, the office of the
country's U.N. envoy said Monday.
	   The United Nations withdrew all non-essential workers from
Tajikistan after the employees were ambushed July 20 while on
patrol in the mountains about 90 miles (140 kilometers) east of
Dushanbe. All were shot in the the head.
	   The Tajik Interior Ministry has said three people, members of an
armed opposition group, have confessed to the killings.
	   U.N. envoy Jan Kubis said Monday his office would not resume
full operations in the former Soviet republic in Central Asia until
the reasons for the killings were known. He spoke after meeting for
two hours with Tajik President Emomail Rakhmonov.
	   Tajik officials have not made public any motive for the
killings.
	   About 70 U.N. observers are stationed in Tajikistan to monitor a
peace deal reached last year that ended the five-year civil war.
	   Despite the accord, Tajikistan remains restive. There are
periodic clashes between the hard-line government and the mostly
Islamic opposition. Also, many warlords do not recognize the peace
deal and wage turf battles with one another.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The United States and Russia are
ratcheting up the pressure on Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic, warning that NATO airstrikes are inevitable unless he
takes decisive action to end the crisis in Kosovo province.
	   Fearing airstrikes, Yugoslav generals put the nation's air
defense on high alert, but tried a belated compromise by moving
some tanks and other heavy equipment out of Kosovo. A Western
diplomat said up to 120 Yugoslav army armored vehicles, including
tanks, have been pulled out.
	   In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said ``systematic
terror'' had been inflicted on Kosovo civilians within recent days
and that Yugoslav forces were mostly responsible.
	   But Annan said he did not ``have the means necessary to provide
an independent assessment of compliance as required by the Security
Council'' and suggested the 15 members may want to make their ``own
judgement in this respect.''
	   However, U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke said Monday that the
Kosovo situation remains critical despite a lull in fighting and
the removal of some Yugoslav tanks and troops. Holbrooke spoke in
Brussels, Belgium, en route to Belgrade to meet with Milosevic.
	   ``We hope to make clear to president Milosevic and the people of
Yugoslavia the extreme gravity of the situation,'' Holbrooke said
after a meeting with NATO leaders.
	   Holbrooke said he was told that NATO preparations continued
unabated. ``At NATO, the planning for military action is serious,
intense and sustained,'' he said.
	   Serbian police and the Yugoslav army have routed separatist
Kosovo Albanian rebels in the crackdown that began in late
February. The conflict has killed hundreds _ most of them Albanian
civilians _ and left more than 275,000 refugees. Kosovo is in
southern Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
	   Milosevic met Sunday with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov
and Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, Serbian President Milan
Milutinovic and Yugoslavia's top defense officials.
	   The Russians are against using NATO force in Kosovo. However,
Ivanov and Sergeyev said the airstrikes could occur ``if decisive
measures are not immediately taken for a radical improvement of the
situation,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin told the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   To avoid such an attack, Yugoslavia must end the hostilities,
withdraw army and security forces, take urgent measures to overcome
the humanitarian crisis, ensure that refugees can return home and
take part in peace talks, he said.
	   In Berlin, German Gen. Dieter Stoeckmann told German radio that
NATO action could come ``within days.''
	   To avert a NATO attack, Serb authorities appeared ready for
compromise by installing an interim government in the rebellious
province in Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
	   On Monday, Yugoslav Prime Minister Momir Bulatovic said the
government had accepted a Russian proposal for the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe to investigate the crisis.
Yugoslavia had repeatedly rejected such a mission until its
membership in the 54-nation organization is restored.
	   Bulatovic also claimed there was no longer any fighting in the
secessionist, majority Albanian province. He said five of the 10
special police units had been removed from Kosovo and the others
had been returned to barracks in the province.
	   A Yugoslav statement said the nation's leaders wanted the Kosovo
dispute solved peacefully, ``but in case we are attacked, we shall
defend our country with all means.''
	   One option could be for parliament to declare a state of
emergency _ a step which could lead to a general mobilization of
all military-aged men.
	   The head of Yugoslavia's other republic, Montenegro, on Monday
urged Milosevic to accept all international demands and avert a
NATO attack.
	   ``We have to avert a clash with the whole world, a confrontation
which we are bound to lose,'' Montenegro's pro-Western president,
Milo Djukanovic, said in a statement.
	   Although the United States and Europeans want an end to the
fighting, they oppose independence for the majority ethnic Albanian
province, fearing it could destabilize other Balkan countries with
Albanian populations.
	   In Kosovo's capital, Pristina, the separatist Kosovo Liberation
Army offered to help NATO forces if asked. KLA spokesman Jakup
Krasniqi said in a statement published Monday by the Albanian
language newspaper Bujku that ``we wish they (airstrikes) would
become reality'' and ``we shall provide assistance ... if it is
asked of us.''
	   Serbs reported two attacks Sunday on civilian cars by Albanian
``terrorists'' 25 miles (40 kilometers) south of Pristina.
Elsewhere, a policeman was killed after stepping on a mine, the
Serb Media Center said.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, allied with the ethnic Albanians,
reported heavy fighting between government forces and the
guerrillas 25 miles (40 miles) southwest of Pristina.
	   Ethnic Albanian political leaders have rejected the new interim
government, which was drawn up without their participation and in
which Serbs outnumber Albanians.
	   Momentum for outside involvement has increased in the past week
amid revelations of massacres of ethnic Albanian civilians in the
forests of Kosovo.
	   EU foreign ministers on Monday debated tighter economic
sanctions against Yugoslavia, but it appeared unlikely that the
latest batch _ tighter travel restrictions and freezing more
Yugoslav assets abroad _ would be anything more than symbolic.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Lawrence Dallaglio was named Monday by coach Clive
Woodward and England's rugby captain for this season and the 1999
World Cup.
	   Dallaglio captained England in last season's Five Nation
compeition but lost his job when he pulled out of England's abysmal
Southern Hemisphere tour this summer.
	   ``Lawrence did a superb job in his first spell as captain last
season,'' Woodward said Monday.
	   Dallaglio said he was delighted with the job and added that he
had resigned as captain of his Wasps club team to focus on England.
	   ``I'm delighted to be reappointed. The season ahead contains an
excellent mix of matches,'' he said. ``We start with our World Cup
qualifiers before the tests against Australia and South Africa and
into the Five Nations.''
	   Woodward also praised Matt Dawson, who captained England in
Dallaglio's absence.
	   ``Matt did a superb job, but he is involved in a huge battle at
scrum-half with Kyran Bracken to hold his place in the team,''
Woodward said.

Japan Ex-Im Bank signs loans for Turkmen petrochemical project
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Export-Import Bank of Japan signed a loan
agreement worth up to 47.6 billion yen (dlrs 353 million) to
finance a petrochemical plant in Turkmenistan, Ex-Im Bank officials
said Monday.
	   The Ex-Im Bank will cover 60 percent of the total loan amount,
or 28.6 billion (dlrs 212 million), while the balance will be
co-financed by the Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd., ABN Amro Bank N.V.
Tokyo branch, the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd., and the Sumitomo
Bank.
	   The agreement was signed with the State Bank for Foreign
Economic Affairs of Turkmenistan.
	   The loan will be used to finance a modernization project of the
country's Turkmenbashi refinery, involving the construction of a
polypropylene production plant to be undertaken by state-run oil
and gas trade company Turkmenneftegas, officials said.
	   The proceeds of the loan will be used to purchase necessary
equipment and services from Itochu Corp., Nissho Iwai Corp., JGC
Corp. and Marubeni Energy and Chemical Project Corp.
	   The project will benefit the country by developing oil-related
industries and earning foreign currency from the sale of
polypropylene, all of which is intended for export, the bank
officials said.

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan told the
Security Council on Monday that he lacked the means to verify
Slobodan Milosevic's compliance with U.N. resolutions demanding a
cease-fire, forcing an assessment that could precipitate a NATO
strike back into the hands of the council.
	   Annan told the 15-member council that it should determine
whether Yugoslavia is in compliance with its resolutions _ using
his report, which blames most recent atrocities in Kosovo on
Yugoslav forces, as a guideline.
	   NATO members have been waiting for the report to determine
whether they will take military action in the southern Serb
province, where Serb forces are trying to crush an independence
movement by Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority.
	   The council, in a resolution Sept. 23, asked Annan to report on
his assessment of the compliance with council demands for a
cease-fire; the withdrawal of Milosevic's special forces; and a
negotiated settlement.
	   Annan said he was not able to supply that information because
the United Nations has no political presence on the ground in
Kosovo, and was relying on information from other organizations and
European sources.
	   He said he could provide information only about the humanitarian
situation, through the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and
other humanitarian groups.
	   In its last resolution, on Sept. 23, the 15-member U.N. Security
Council renewed the demands and threatened unspecified measures if
both sides failed to abide by its resolutions.
	   Since then, photos and reports of a massacre of ethnic Albanians
have been published around the world, heightening calls for
military intervention.
	   Expressing the urgency of the situation, the council urged the
U.N. chief to speed up his report _ originally expected midweek _
to Monday, so they could begin discussions on it as early as
Tuesday.
	   That appeared to place the burden for a clear decision on Annan
_ but instead he confined himself to calling for the safe return of
refugees, the withdrawal of Milosevic's special police units and a
negotiated settlement.
	   Annan said the humanitarian situation was rapidly deteriorating.
	   ``In the last few weeks, the international community has
witnessed appalling atrocities in Kosovo, reminiscent of the recent
past elsewhere in the Balkans,'' Annan wrote.
	   ``It is clear beyond any reasonable doubt that the great
majority of such acts have been committed by security forces in
Kosovo acting under the authority of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia.''
	   He concluded by saying that he shared the sense of indignation
and revulsion at what has been happening in Kosovo. But he called
for the international community to ``never lose sight of the
ultimate need for a comprehensive political solution.
	   ``Otherwise, we shall be treating only the symptoms of the
problem, and not its causes,'' he wrote.
	   He noted that ethnic Albanian forces have also been fighting,
and said there was reason to believe that they were responsible for
atrocities as well.
	   Serbia is the larger of two republics comprising Yugoslavia, and
Milosevic launched a crackdown in February against
independence-seeking rebels in Kosovo. Hundreds have died in the
fighting and 275,000 have been routed from their homes.
	   The west is opposed to independence for Kosovo, but wants
Milosevic to return the autonomy he stripped from the province in
1989.
	   The United States warned Milosevic on Friday that NATO will
strike Serb targets within two weeks unless he complies with every
U.N. demand.
	   Britain is preparing ground troops and armored units for Kosovo,
to be deployed in a post-airstrike peacekeeping role, London's
Sunday Telegraph reported. The defense ministry refused to confirm
or deny the report but repeated Britain was ready to participate in
a NATO attack.
	   Permanent council members Russia and China have flatly objected
to any military intervention in Kosovo, and could veto any
resolution specifically authorizing force. China abstained from the
Sept. 23 resolution.
	   Nevertheless, the United States has said it already has the
authority to strike Milosevic without any more council action _ and
Britain's reported preparations indicate a similar position.

benefits &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian Finance Ministry has cut off all
benefits for workers at the government's mission in Chechnya for
lack of funds, news agencies said Monday.
	   The family of President Boris Yeltsin's envoy to Chechnya, who
was kidnapped in April and is still missing, did not receive his
salary or benefits for months. But they have recently been
compensated, Yeltsin's spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin told the Interfax
news agency.
	   ``I do not understand the heartless decision of the finance
ministry and its leader'' to cut off benefits, Ivan Rybkin,
Russia's top negotiator with the Chechens, said Monday:
	   He accused Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov of indifference to
those who ``risk their lives defending its interests,'' the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Last week, an official at the Russian mission in Chechnya, Akmal
Saidov, was kidnapped, tortured and killed.
	   Three Britons and a New Zealander working for a British phone
company were kidnapped over the weekend. Hundreds of Russians and
foreigners have been abducted by gangs seeking ransom since
Chechnya's 1994-96 independence war with Russia, and dozens are
still being held.
	   Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and Chechen President
Aslan Maskhadov are planning to meet Oct. 10 to discuss the
increasing tensions, Interfax quoted Interior Minister Sergei
Stepashin as saying Monday.
	   The announcement riled Chechen opposition leader Shamil Basayev,
who has been leading a five-day demonstration against Maskhadov in
Grozny, the Chechen capital.
	   Basayev called such talks ``complete nonsense'' and urged
Maskhadov to cut off all contact with Russia.
	   Chechnya considers itself independent and has been running its
own affairs since Russian troops left. Moscow says Chechnya remains
part of Russia but has no control over its affairs.

Japanese police search home of poisoning suspects
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Police on Monday searched the home of a woman
accused of poisoning a man to collect his life insurance in a case
that could be linked to a mass poisoning in the same small town
that killed four people.
	   Masumi Hayashi, a 37-year-old a former insurance saleswoman, was
arrested in the western state of Wakayama on Sunday on suspicion of
serving the man food laced with arsenic in September 1997.
	   Hayashi's husband Kenji, 53, was arrested Monday in a separate
insurance scam.
	   Investigators searched the home of the couple Monday and checked
an irrigation canal which runs by the home. TV Asahi reported
police took away a carpet they suspect was stained with vomit.
	   Police also have taken dust and soil samples from the home to
search for traces of the arsenic.
	   The case could be linked to a poisoning in July in which four
people _ including two children _ died and 60 people became sick
after eating curry tainted with arsenic served at a local festival.
Wakayama is 450 kilometers (280 miles) southwest of Tokyo.
	   No arrests have been made in the July killings, but the Kyodo
News agency quoted unidentified police sources as saying Masumi
Hayashi was assigned to monitor the curry pots at the festival.
	   The curry poisoning was big news in Japan, where such killings
are rare. The crime triggered a rash of copycat poisonings around
the country, which led to one death and sickened several other
people.
	   The poisoning scare continued Monday, when 25-year-old man was
taken to a hospital after feeling sick from drinking coffee he
bought at a supermarket in Fukui, on the Sea of Japan coast, Kyodo
News reported.
	   Police said they found a tiny hole covered with cellophane tape
in the bottom of the container, but have not detected any poisonous
substance in the coffee, the report said.
	   In the insurance fraud case, the man Hayashi allegedly poisoned
spent nearly five months in a hospital before he was released in
January.
	   The couple has denied the charges, according to police sources
quoted by national broadcaster NHK and Kyodo News agency.
	   Commentators urged police to solve the curry case but warned
against assuming the Hayashi couple were involved before all the
evidence is in.
	   ``The most important thing is the probe into the poison curry
case,'' said the Mainichi newspaper in an editorial Monday. ``It's
true that arsenic was used in both cases, but that doesn't justify
any rush to judgment''

Sierra Leone rebel leader pleads `not guilty' to treason charge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ Sierra Leone's most notorious
rebel appeared in court on Monday and pleaded innocent to nine
charges, including murder, treason and crimes against humanity.
	   Foday Sankoh, the self-admitted leader of Sierra Leone's dreaded
Revolutionary United Front stood quietly before Justice Samuel
Ademosu when all nine counts were read out by the High Court clerk.
	   To each count, Sankoh declared ``Not guilty, my lord. I'm
innocent.''
	   Sankoh is accused of masterminding a campaign of terror through
his rebel movement. The RUF has been widely accused of killing and
torturing civilians. Hundreds and perhaps thousands of villagers
have been maimed and hacked to death by machete-wielding rebel
fighters looking to invoke loyalty through fear.
	   After weeks of preparations and delays, Sankoh finally answered
the nine charges Monday. Although unable to find a lawyer, Sankoh
was permitted by Ademosu to represent himself during the trial.
	   ``God almighty will defend me,'' Sankoh told the judge.
	   A 12-person jury will rule on the charges and if found guilty of
treason, Sankoh could be sentenced to death.
	   Sankoh's Revolutionary United Front are allied with Sierra
Leone's military junta that seized power in May 1997, but was
ousted in February by a coalition West African Intervention Force.
	   Although defeated in the capital, gunmen from the RUF and the
former junta continued to wage a guerrilla war in the countryside.

Nurse convicted on Saudi murder drops out of university course
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUNDEE, Scotland (AP) _ A British nurse convicted in Saudi
Arabia of murdering an Australian colleague has dropped out of a
part-time university course without explanation, Dundee University
said Monday.
	   Lucille McLauchlan, 32, is due to stand trial in December on
charges of stealing a credit card from a dying patient while
working in Scotland, and then falsifying her qualifications to get
the Saudi job.
	   McLauchlan and another British nurse, Deborah Parry, were
convicted in the 1996 murder of Yvonne Gilford, and freed in May as
an act of clemency by King Fahd.
	   Parry and McLauchlan both denied the charge and said their
confessions were falsified.
	   Dundee University spokeswoman Carole Pope said Ms. McLauchlan
was allocated a place on a program called New Opportunities.
	   ``We don't know why she has decided not to take this course. It
is designed to give people a taste of university, to see if
studying for a degree is the right thing for them to do,'' said Ms.
Pope.
	   Ms. Parry has started nursing again at a hospital in England.
	   Both women _ who fell out with each other _ sold their stories
to tabloids, and Ms. McLauchlan has also written a book, ``One
Nurse's Hell,'' due to be published next month.

Japan landowners oppose expansion of Tokyo Airport
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Landowners opposed to the expansion of Tokyo's
international airport urged the government Monday to scrap a plan
to complete a second runway by the end of fiscal 2000, Kyodo News
reported.
	   Representatives from seven families and a factory made the
demand in a joint statement issued at a news conference held on the
site of the proposed runway at Narita airport east of Tokyo, the
report said.
	   Two of the seven families live on the proposed runway site,
while the other five families and the factory own plots of land on
the site. They represented three factions of opponents of the
airport.
	   It is the first time since 1991 that the three factions held a
joint news conference after an alliance opposing the construction
of the airport divided into the three groups in the 1980s.
	   In recent years, several farmers opposed to the airport
expansion have settled their disputes with the government, agreeing
to sell their land to make room for the runway.
	   In 1966, the government announced a plan to build the airport,
setting off strident opposition from local farmers who complained
they had not been consulted.
	   Protests against the airport crested in the 1970s in violent
clashes between police and farmers along with leftist radicals
backing the farmers. The airport opened in 1978 with a single
runway.

Explosion kills Israeli soldier, injures 4 others

<TEXT>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ Guerrillas detonated roadside bombs
Monday in southern Lebanon, killing an Israeli soldier and injuring
four others, Lebanese security officials said.
	   Hezbollah, the Shiite Muslim guerrilla group fighting Israeli
forces in the south, claimed responsibility, saying its fighters
simultaneously detonated two bombs as an Israeli convoy was
passing.
	   A statement from the group said the targeted road linked bases
manned by Israeli troops and their allied South Lebanon Army
militia.
	   There was no immediate comment from Israel.
	   The Lebanese officials, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity, said the Israelis were in a vehicle on the main road
leading into the town of Hasbaya when the bombs exploded Monday
afternoon.
	   The casualties were first brought to Marjayoun, the main town in
the Israeli-occupied zone, and later taken to Israel, the officials
said.
	   Hezbollah and other Lebanese guerrillas groups are fighting to
oust Israel from its self-styled ``security zone'' in southern
Lebanon.
	   Israel established the border enclave in 1985 to try to prevent
cross-border guerrilla attacks.

Russian railways refuse to carry mail over post office's debt
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Many of Russia's railways have stopped carrying
mail because the post office isn't paying its bills, stranding
hundreds of rail cars around the country stuffed with letters and
packages.
	   The post office owes the railways about 210 million rubles (dlrs
13 million), said Valery Zudin, a spokesman for the Railways
Ministry. Many of the country's 17 railways are refusing to carry
mail until the post office pays up.
	   The problem is part of the overall crisis in Russia where a
tangled web of non-payment of bills and wages has all but paralyzed
the economy. The government is the largest debtor, failing to pay
wages and pensions to millions of Russians or pay for goods and
services.
	   Russians rely heavily on mail as their main method of
communication, especially in far-flung regions where there are few
telephones. Few Russian TV networks broadcast throughout the
country, so people also depend on newspapers delivered by mail for
news.
	   The Railways Ministry also accused the post office of carrying
commercial cargo in mail cars, then charging customers commercial
rates while paying the railways the special cheap rates set for
mail delivery and pocketing the difference.
	   ``We don't believe the post office's claim they lack cash to pay
us,'' Zudin told The Associated Press.
	   ``We wouldn't complain if they only carried mail, but they are
involved in commerce. They carry vodka and cigarettes in mail
cars.''
	   The post office, which is chronically in debt, says it is owed
money by the government and others. It refused to give any figures
on its revenue or debt.
	   Officials at the Railways Ministry were also unable to cite the
total amount of money owed to them, or their debt to the
government.
	   ``It's too complicated,'' Zudin said. ``In some cases, our
customers, like the military, fail to pay us for carrying their
goods, but we are still supposed to pay taxes for that income we
never got.''

Two top political leaders gunned down in violent port city

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Gunmen with automatic weapons shot and
killed two top political leaders in this troubled port city on
Monday in an bloody ethnically motivated battle that has claimed
600 lives so far this year.
	   Another four people were injured, police said.
	   The gunmen opened fire on a car carrying Aamir Zaki, 30, and his
companion, Abdul Qadir, both senior members of the Muttiheda Qami
Movement (MQM) or United People's Movement, they said.
	   The MQM, formerly known as the Mohajir Qami Movement, represents
Indian Muslims who settled in Pakistan in 1947 after the
subcontinent was given its independence from Britain. The MQM
dominates in the cities of southern Sindh, including Karachi, the
provincial capital.
	   Two of the injured in the shooting were in the vehicle and two
were passers by caught in the cross fire, police said.
	   The two men had left the Karachi Municipal Corporation, where
Zaki, worked as assistant director when the shooting occurred.
	   No one has taken responsibility for the killing, but most of the
deaths in Karachi have been the result of a bloody feud between
rival factions of the MQM.
	   The victims of Monday's shooting belonged to the largest MQM
faction, led by Altaf Hussein, who has been living in self-imposed
exile in Britain for more than five years.
	   The country's financial and manufacturing heart has been wracked
by bitter violence between the rival factions since the beginning
of the year.
	   The larger Hussein faction is a member of a coalition government
that rules southern Sindh province. It is allied to Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League.
	   In recent weeks the MQM has threatened to withdraw from the
coalition government demanding Sharif's government put an end to
the ongoing violence in Karachi.
	   Without the support of the Hussain faction, which has 28 seats
in the 43-seat government, it would collapse.
	   ``The killers are the people were do not want to see peace in
karachi,'' said Shoiab Bokhari, a spokesman for the Hussein faction
of the MQM.
	   One of the leading demands of Bokhari's faction has been the
removal from Karachi of the paramilitary Ranger force. The MQM
claim that the Rangers have fomented violence between the rival
factions.
	   This Bokhari says has been done in an attempt to reduce the
strength of the MQM in Karachi, where it dominates.
	   After the shooting police tried to clear M.A. Jinnah Road, a
congested thoroughfare where the shooting occurred. Scores of
policemen in riot gear and wielding machine guns patrolled outside
the Karachi Municipal Corporation and the nearby Civil Hospital
where the bodies were taken.

World cycling union defends decision to reduce doping bans for
</HEADLINE>
Festina riders

<TEXT>
	   MAASTRICHT, Netherlands (AP) _ The president of cycling's
governing body vowed Monday to continue the fight against doping in
his sport, the day after softening penalties against three riders
who admitted taking banned substances.
	   ``For these riders, 90 percent of the season is the Tour de
France,'' said Hein Verbruggen, president of the International
Cycling Union, which cut a month off eight-month bans handed to the
riders by the Swiss cycling federation.
	   The cyclists, Alex Zuelle, Laurent Dufaux and Armin Meier, all
members of the Festina Team that was ejected from the Tour because
of its systematic doping policy, will now be back in action May 1,
1999 _ in time to prepare for next year's Tour.
	   At the UCI's first international congress since doping scandals
rocked the 1998 Tour de France, Verbruggen told delegates cycling
was still hurting.
	   ``No doubt a sport like ours which depends so much on sponsoring
money must feel the negative ramifications from what happened,'' he
said. ``I know that _ we all know that _ and we have to fight to
make things better.''
	   The UCI stepped up the battle by forming an anti-doping work
group, funded by national federations, cycling teams and riders.
	   The group, which includes representatives of the UCI, riders and
professional teams, will consider ways of fighting the acknowledged
widespread drug abuse among cyclists.
	   The International Olympic Committee is expected to launch a
similar body, dedicated to coordinating drug testing throughout the
world, at an anti-doping summit scheduled for next February in
Lausanne, Switzerland.
	   Denmark's Bjarne Riis, winner of the 1996 Tour de France, and
1988 World Champion Maurizio Fondriest of Italy will represent
riders on the UCI group.
	   The UCI Management Committee, meeting ahead of the cycling World
Championships, said the Swiss Festina riders should be credited for
``taking responsibility for their actions.''
	   The three riders all admitted taking the banned performance
enhancer EPO while with the Festina team after they were taken in
for questioning by French justice authorities.
	   The World Championships begin Tuesday with the junior women's
time trial and the men's under-23 time trial around a hilly course
ending in the southern Dutch town of Valkenburg and end Sunday with
the elite men's 258-kilometer (162-mile) road race.
	   Defending the reduction of the bans for the Swiss riders,
Verbruggen said the seven-month sentence was appropriate due to the
specific nature of the sport and the season.
	   He said a six-month ban for a cyclist could wipe out an entire
season or have virtually no effect depending on when it came into
force.
	   He added that long bans also would not eliminate doping from the
sport and emphasized that cycling's governing body was in line with
International Olympic Committee policy advocating a maximum
two-year ban for a first offense.
	   ``A ban for two years for a rider means a ban for life,''
Verbruggen said, adding that such a sanction would almost certainly
lead to costly legal battles from professionals whose careers were
ended.
	   While acknowledging the problem of doping, the combative UCI
president stressed that cycling was already working hard to clean
up its act.
	   ``Just give me an example of another sport that does as much as
we do,'' he angrily snapped at reporters. ``We spend a lot of money
... we do a lot of controls.''

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso has won a second term despite Brazil's economic meltdown in
the last month, becoming the first Brazilian president ever
re-elected.
	   The last hope of his rivals to avert a first-ballot victory
seemed to fade Monday as Cardoso's total increased with returns
from the interior, where the government historically does well.
	   Now it's time for some bitter medicine: Many economists predict
a recession in 1999, deteriorating unemployment and the need to
raise taxes, all which are likely to erode Cardoso's popularity.
	   With 49.4 percent of Sunday's vote counted by Monday, Cardoso
had 50.3 percent to 35.6 percent for his closest rival, Workers
Party candidate Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. Ciro Gomes of the
moderate PPS party had 10.6 percent of the vote and nine other
candidates shared the rest.

Protest against Bangladeshi author under death threat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Islamic extremists on marched Monday
through Bangladesh's capital urging the death penalty for author
Taslima Nasrin, who allegedly blasphemed Islam.
	   Nasrin, 36, faces death threats from the extremists and an
arrest warrant for allegedly suggesting in a newspaper interview
that the Koran, the Islamic holy book, be rewritten. Ignoring her
claim she was misquoted, Islamic conservatives have announced a
cash reward of 200,000 takas (dlrs 5,000) to anyone who kills her.
	   ``Taslima is an enemy of Islam and we want to see her hanged to
death,'' shouted the protesters. The demonstration of about 500
people, many wearing white prayer caps, was organized by Islami
Oikya Jote, an Islamic alliance that demands her arrest.
	   Unlike Sunday when helmeted police fired tear gas to scatter
thousands of demonstrators, riot police watched the Monday's march
without interfering.
	   Nasrin, who returned home last month after four years of
self-imposed exile in Europe and the United States, says she wants
to be with her mother who has colon cancer. ``This is my country
and I've every right to freely live here,'' she said Sunday in a
telephone interview with The Associated Press from her hideout.
	   Last month, a Dhaka magistrate revived the 1994 arrest warrant
ordered in a civil suit. This was in addition to a state-sponsored
blasphemy case for which she was granted bail and permission to
leave the country in 1994.
	   Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's liberal government has so far
shown little interest in arresting Nasrin.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ With the threat of NATO attack
mounting, Yugoslavia's prime minister warned Monday the nation
faces the ``immiment danger of war'' and claimed the government was
taking steps to comply with international demands for peace in
Kosovo.
	   In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said ``systematic
terror'' had been inflicted on Kosovo civilians within recent days
and that Yugoslav forces were mostly responsible.
	   But Annan said he did not ``have the means necessary to provide
an independent assessment of compliance as required by the Security
Council'' and suggested the 15 members may want to make their ``own
judgement in this respect.''
	   But U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke said the situation in
the southern Serbian province was as bad now as two weeks ago.
Holbrooke spoke in Brussels, Belgium en route to Belgrade, where he
planned to drive home to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
``the extreme gravity of the situation.''
	   Meanwhile, Yugoslavia's prime minister told an emergency session
of parliament Monday that the country ``is faced with the imminent
danger of war.'' Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the main republic
of Yugoslavia.
	   ``The threats are serious,'' Prime Minister Momir Bulatovic
said. ``And I call on this parliament to conclude that Yugoslavia
is faced with the imminent danger of war. Yugoslavia has to defend
itself if it was attacked.''
	   One option could be for parliament to declare a state of
emergency _ a step which could lead to a general mobilization of
all military-aged men.
	   In an attempt to head off NATO action, Bulatovic said the
government had accepted a Russian proposal for the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe to investigate the crisis.
	   Yugoslavia had repeatedly rejected such a mission to Kosovo
until Yugoslav membership in the 54-nation organization is
restored.
	   Bulatovic also claimed there was no longer any fighting in the
rebellious, majority Albanian province. He said five of the 10
special police units had been removed from Kosovo and the others
had been returned to barracks in the province.
	   In Brussels, however, Holbrooke made clear that half-measures
would not be enough to satisfy Washington and prevent a NATO
attack.
	   ``While the level of fighting may have abated temporarily, the
capacity for its resumption is there,'' Holbrooke said after a
meeting with NATO Secretary General Javier Solana and Supreme
Allied Commander Europe Wesley K. Clark.
	   ``The situation, therefore, remains fully as serious today as it
was a week or two ago,'' he said. ``We hope to make clear to
president Milosevic and the people of Yugoslavia the extreme
gravity of the situation.''
	   Holbrooke said Solana and Clark told him that ``significant
military forces, regular forces and military uniformed police,
remain in Kosovo,'' despite claims of significant withdrawals.

KLA refutes accusation that it too commits atrocities

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ As hundreds of Swiss-based Kosovo Albanians
gathered outside the United Nations to call for military
intervention in Kosovo, rebels fighting for independence for the
province on Monday denied claims that they have committed
atrocities against Serbs.
	   ``We have never committed acts which violate human rights,''
said Bardhyl Mahmuti, political representative of the Kosovo
Liberation Army.
	   Last Sunday, human rights groups reported the alleged slaughter
by Serbs of 18 ethnic Albanians near Obrija village in the Drenica
region northwest of Pristina.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said on Monday that although
the United Nations believes Serb forces are responsible for the
great majority of atrocities so far in Kosovo, there is reason to
believe ethnic Albanian forces have also committed them. He didn't
give examples.
	   Last Wednesday, the chief of the U.N. refugee agency, Sadako
Ogata, said she believes the KLA is also guilty of using
``excessive force.''
	   Mahmuti called the claims ``absolutely inaccurate'' and demanded
proof to back them up.
	   Hundreds of people brandishing banners sporting slogans reading
``peace and liberty for Kosovo,'' ``military intervention for
Kosovo'' and ``Kosovo _ yes to self-determination'' protested
outside the U.N. European headquarters Monday in favor of military
strikes by NATO against Serb forces.
	   ``We are here to protest against the indifference of the
international community to what is happening in Kosovo,'' Avdija
Ramadan, one of the organizers of the demonstration, said.
	   The United States warned Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
on Friday that NATO will strike Serb targets within two weeks
unless he complies with every U.N. demand to halt his assault on
ethnic Albanians, allow relief to refugees and negotiate peace.
	   To try to show the sincerity of plans to withdraw its forces and
avoid the threat of NATO air strikes, Belgrade has invited Annan to
visit Kosovo. Annan turned down the offer, and world leaders made
their skepticism clear.
	   Jashar Salihu, another KLA spokesman, condemned the invite,
saying the Serbs would show Annan only areas they wanted him to
see.
	   The two spokesmen called for immediate military action against
the Serb security forces and reiterated the KLA's determination to
continue fighting for independence for the province.
	   ``The international community must stop this hypocrisy and
double gaming,'' Mahmuti said.
	   ``The only language the Serb regime understands is the language
of force,'' Salihu added.
	   Serbia is the larger of two republics comprising Yugoslavia, and
Milosevic launched a crackdown in February against
independence-seeking rebels in Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians
constitute 90 percent of the population. Hundreds have died in the
fighting and 275,000 have been routed from their homes.
	   Meanwhile, the Swiss government announced that 68 percent of
asylum applications made in September in the country came from
Yugoslavia. Some 4,581 applications were made, almost double the
figure for last year.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Teachers nationwide went on strike Monday
to protest the government's failure to pay promised raises, closing
schools and idling 7 million students.
	   The strike fueled criticism of a government beleaguered by
charges of top-level corruption and mismanagement, which has cost
President Daniel arap Moi popular support, spending by tourists and
international loans.
	   In Nairobi, riot police armed with tear-gas rifles broke up a
demonstration by a few hundred teachers, who chanted ``People
united will never be defeated.'' Ten teachers were hauled off in a
police van.
	   In the western Kenyan town of Rongo, police used clubs to break
up a group of teachers discussing the strike and arrested three
representatives of the Kenya National Union of Teachers. The
teachers fought back with stones.
	   One teacher and one policeman were hospitalized. Dozens of
others were treated for minor cuts and bruises.
	   Elsewhere in the region, students at a primary school rampaged,
breaking windows at their school.
	   Moi had agreed a year ago to raise teachers' salaries by up to
200 percent over five years in a desperate bid to end a 12-day
strike before last December's election. But the government paid
just one increase before saying in July it didn't have enough money
to pay the rest.
	   Education Minister Kalonzo Musyoka said if the raises agreed on
were put into effect, 80 percent of his ministry's 1998-99 budget
of 44 billion shillings (dlrs 733 million) would go to pay
salaries.
	   David Gitari, head of the Anglican Church in Kenya, said he did
not believe the government lacked the money to pay the promised
raises, but that it had been wasted on high-level corruption.
	   ``The government made a mistake to ... not abide by the
agreement,'' Gitari said.
	   Currently, the highest salary is 29,400 Kenyan shillings (dlrs
490) per month, and the lowest is 2,730 Kenyan shillings (dlrs
45.50) per month. In addition, teachers receive monthly medical,
housing and commuter allowances ranging from 14,901 Kenyan
shillings (dlrs 248) down to 1,667 Kenyan shillings (dlrs 28).
	   Kenya's 260,000 teachers went on strike as secondary students
were to begin their national examinations.
	   Joseph Mathenge, who teaches at Thika High School, condemned
Moi, a former grade school teacher, for reneging on his pact with
teachers.
	   ``I want to tell the president one thing, if he is unable to
manage the affairs of this country, let him quit,'' Mathenge said.
``The president says there is no money.... This country used to
have money. Where has the money gone to?''
	   ``Look at our roads here, look at our hospitals here, look at
our schools. What is left of this country?''
	   Services provided by the government have steadily declined over
the past decade while crime has risen.

	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ With the old chancellor leaving soon and
the new one not yet sworn in, Germany decided Monday to send its
still-serving foreign minister to a summit of European Union
leaders this month.
	   Outgoing Chancellor Helmut Kohl confirmed he would not attend
the Oct. 24-25 session in the lakeside resort of Poertschach.
	   Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder won't be going either because
he won't be officially sworn into office until Oct. 27.
	   Schroeder also has to attend a crucial meeting of his Social
Democratic party on Oct. 25, spokesman Uwe-Karsten Heye said.
	   Kohl's government spokesman said the two discussed the problem
on Saturday and decided Germany would be represented by Klaus
Kinkel, Kohl's vice-chancellor and foreign minister.

U.S., Britain begin new round of air transport liberalization
</HEADLINE>
talks &QL; 
 &UR; By SUE LEEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ After a two-year break, U.S. and British
transportation officials resumed talks Monday aimed at forging an
``open skies'' agreement on trans-Atlantic air travel. But the two
sides appeared deeply divided.
	   The three days of talks will focus on liberalizing air services
by allowing an unlimited number of carriers to serve any U.S. or
British airport. The United States has signed similar deals with 31
nations, but Britain has resisted such an arrangement.
	   A lucrative proposed alliance between British Airways and
American Airlines depends on an '' open skies'' deal being reached.
	   Britain has said an ``open skies'' deal depends on the U.S.
government approving the British Airways-American deal, the world's
largest airline alliance. A British Airways spokesman said Monday
that the airline ``expects no conclusion to the open skies
negotiations before there is a U.S. government decision on the
British Airways-American Airlines alliance.''
	   But officials in Washington say there will be no approval until
Britain agrees to an ``open skies'' arrangement.
	   ``All we can say is that the current aviation treaty is being
reevaluated,'' a spokeswoman for Britain's Department of Transport
said Monday, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Under the 1977 treaty, known as Bermuda II, only two U.S.
carriers _ American and United Airlines _ are allowed to fly to
Heathrow, which offers the most connections to international
points.
	   U.S. officials say as a result, Americans face limited flights,
and far less competition, on flights to England.
	   Britain has said that any ``open skies'' deal must include
``competition safeguards'' that let authorities deal with two
common problems in the United States: predatory pricing and
airlines dumping extra seats onto competitive markets to kill off
rivals.
	   News reports said Britain also wants to address the issue of
``cabotage,'' the right of a foreign airline to operate domestic
services within the United States, and U.S. rules preventing
non-American companies owning more than 25 percent of a U.S.
airline.
	   News reports said British negotiators, led by head of aviation
at the Foreign Office Norman Ling and Tony Baker, a senior
Department of Transport official, also wants the United States to
relax its policy requiring government personnel to travel
exclusively on U.S. carriers.
	   U.S. negotiators, led by Deputy Assistant Secretary for
Transportation Affairs at the State Department, David Marchick, are
reported to be pushing for an undertaking that once Heathrow is
opened up to all carriers, other U.S. airlines will be guaranteed
runway slots free of charge.
	   American and British Airways want to merge their operations, but
not their corporations, in a deal that would let them set prices
and share revenues on some of the world's most lucrative routes.
	   Rivals, who include United and Britain's Virgin Atlantic,
complain they would control 60 percent of the American-British
market, leaving travelers at their mercy.

Congolese rebels shell Kindu, gear up for battle for air base
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KALIMA, Congo (AP) _ Reinforced by troops from eastern Congo,
rebels on Monday shelled the eastern town of Kindu and surrounded
its strategic air base used by the government to halt rebel
advances, a commander said.
	   Despite initial reports that the rebels had entered Kindu, 380
kilometers (235 miles) west of Goma, the rebel stronghold, rebel
army commanders said Monday their troops were at least 19
kilometers (11 miles) outside the town but were gearing up for
battle.
	   Rebel leaders hope the capture of Kindu will boost morale and
demonstrate they have what it takes to carry their rebellion into
the rest of Africa's third-largest nation as well as open routes to
Katanga and Eastern Kasai provinces, rich in copper and diamonds.
	   Far to the west in the capital, Kinshasa, Information Minister
Didier Mumengi dismissed claims that Kindu had fallen.
	   ``It is regrettable that foreign radio stations are being used
as springboards for propaganda reports by the aggressors,'' Mumengi
said over state-run radio.
	   President Laurent Kabila wants to use Kindu as a launching point
for a counter-offensive in eastern Congo.
	   ''We're shelling Kindu, and most of people in town are running
away,'' said rebel commander Richard Mondo. ``But we're still
outside the town.''
	   The rebels _ ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted members of the
Congolese army and opposition politicians _ took up arms Aug. 2,
accusing Kabila of mismanagement, corruption and creating division
among Congo's 400 tribes.
	   The rebels have targeted Kindu since late August, when they were
forced to retreat from the outskirts of Kinshasa after Angola and
Zimbabwe sent troops to bail out Kabila.
	   In Kalima, a small trading post deep in the tropical forest 80
kilometers (50 miles) northeast of Kindu, a rebel aircraft landed
on a grassy strip and offloaded food and some troops who
immediately left in the direction of Kindu.
	   Most of the rebel fighters, clad in brand-new Rwandan-made dark
green uniforms, rubber rain boots and toting Kalashnikov assault
rifles and rocket-propelled grenade launchers, have been on the
240-kilometer (150-mile) march northwest to Kalima since they left
Bukavu at the south end of Lake Kivu two weeks ago.
	   Local trader Gilbert Tumba said Kalima fell to the rebels
Saturday with little resistance.
	   Rebel commanders said at least 19 enemy soldiers were killed in
an hour-long gun battle that drove most everyone from town.
	   The main street was eerily quiet Monday. Houses were empty, and
the only sound was the singing of birds.
	   ``Everybody fled to the bush, but we expect them to start coming
back,'' Tumba said. ``People are scared.''
	   Rebel fighters said Sudanese troops were involved in the
fighting Saturday. Sudan denies it has sent troops, along with
Chad, Angola and Zimbabwe, to prop up Kabila.
	   The rebels want direct negotiations with Kabila, but the
president Rwanda and Congo helped place in office has so far
refused, accusing them of being puppets of his former allies.
	   The Congo conflict has sucked in several if the vast central
African nation's nine neighbors, and regional diplomatic
initiatives have so far failed to halt it.

EU accelerates talks with `fast-track' candidates, including
</HEADLINE>
Cyprus &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ European Union nations agreed Monday to
accelerate membership talks with five eastern neighbors and Cyprus
but ignored a demand by France and the Netherlands that Cyprus must
be cautioned it can only join if it first ends its division.
	   Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel reiterated the EU
view that simply starting enlargement talks would have a spillover
effect and ``facilitate a political settlement'' of Cyprus'
division.
	   ``We want a political solution for the island under the aegis of
the United Nations,'' Schuessel, whose country holds the EU
presidency, said during an EU foreign ministers meeting.
	   Schuessel told reporters that preliminary talks that began in
March with Cyprus, Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Estonia and
Slovenia are going well enough to begin substantive negotiations
with them on Nov. 10. Before, the preliminary screening process had
no fixed end.
	   France and the Netherlands wanted to caution Cyprus that it
could only join if it is first reunified. The foreign ministers did
not act on the Franco-Dutch request.
	   Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded
the north following an abortive coup by elements favoring union
with Greece. Turkish Cypriots have declared their own Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus, labeled illegal by the United Nations
and recognized only by Turkey.
	   Cyprus' Greek Cypriot government and those of the five East
European nations opened ``screening'' talks with the EU in March.
	   To become an EU member, candidates must adopt the entire
spectrum of EU rules, regulations and laws. These cover 31 chapters
_ from agriculture, energy, foreign affairs and monetary union to
corporate and banking laws, consumer health protection and
telecommunications standards and practices.
	   Estonia has said by 2002 or 2003 it will be EU-compatible in 12
chapters, Hungary in 11. Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovenia and
Cyprus say they will comply with seven chapters by then.
	   The recommendation to start more detailed talks came in a report
from the EU Commission. The EU has not fixed an entry date for any
of the six ``fast-track'' candidates.
	   Lithuania, Latvia, Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria are also in
line to join, albeit much later.
	   Also Monday, the foreign ministers asked the European Commission
to ``reassess'' its 1993 approval of Malta's 1990 membership
application. The Mediterranean island nation reapplied Sept. 11
after its previous government put EU membership on ice.
	   They also welcomed the recent election victory of opposition
parties in Slovakia, saying they hoped for a restoration of full
democracy there after six years of autocratic rule by Prime
Minister Vladimir Meciar.

With protest looming, government promises to pay back wages
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Seeking to ease tensions before a nationwide
workers' protest Wednesday, President Boris Yeltsin's government
claimed that the days of chronic wage delays would end soon.
	   But cynical workers have grown weary of the unfulfilled
promises, and several million could take part in demonstrations
planned for cities, towns and factories across the country.
	   ``The government will do its utmost to pay wages regularly to
public sector workers, starting in October,'' Deputy Prime Minister
Valentina Matviyenko said Monday, according to the ITAR-Tass news
agency.
	   Matviyenko has the unenviable task of handling social issues,
including overdue wage payments, and she met Wednesday with
teachers, one of the groups hardest hit by the wage delays. She
acknowledged that rough times were still ahead.
	   ``Improvement of the economic and financial situation in the
country is not to be expected in the near future,'' she warned.
``The crisis is not over.''
	   A group of teachers protested Monday outside the White House,
the main government office building, the latest in a series of
recent demonstrations leading up to Wednesday's march.
	   An economic crisis that hit in August has made bad conditions
worse, and strikes have become commonplace in many industries. But
in most cases, the protests have been uncoordinated and have not
caused major disruptions to the economy.
	   Wednesday's demonstration, organized by trade unions and the
Communist Party, has been months in the making. A similar protest
last year drew an estimated 2 million people in hundreds of
demonstrations across Russia.
	   But it only lasted a day and did not seriously threaten the
government. Yeltsin's administration is hoping for a similar
outcome this year.
	   The protest organizers have had some difficulty coordinating
their aims.
	   The trade unions see it as an economic protest, with the main
focus on the wages owed to millions of Russian workers. The
Communist Party, meanwhile, sees the demonstration as a political
event aimed at weakening Yeltsin's hold on power.
	   The issues have become even murkier in recent days, because a
number of Communists have agreed to take part in the new government
led by Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
	   Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov has said he expects the
protests to be peaceful, and most large demonstrations in recent
years have taken place without confrontations.
	   Meanwhile, striking coal miners began heading home Monday after
spending the past four months camped out just outside the gates of
the White House.
	   The miners' union said it had reached agreement with the
government on paying back wages. The protesters, who once numbered
200, have dwindled to about 50. But a handful of defiant miners
remained at their muddy, tent city on Monday and vowed to remain.
	   ``We will stay until all our demands are met, until this
criminal regime is gone,'' said the leader of the camp, Vladimir
Potishny.

 &UR; Situation calm in Kosovo as U.N. and NATO face bombing decision
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) - The guns were largely silent in
Kosovo Monday as the United Nations and NATO wrestled with the
question of air strikes, and diplomats said the Yugoslav forces
have made significant withdrawals.
	   U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan told the Security Council he
was unable to determine whether or not President Slobodan Milosevic
had complied with U.N. demands he end his crackdown on ethnic
Albanians in this poor southern province in which they represent
the vast majority of the population.
	   Diplomats on the ground in Kosovo, however, say they have
observed an informal cease-fire since last Thursday and were not
aware of any aggressive operations by government troops or police
against ethnic Albanians or the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   One diplomat, who spoke on condition he not be identified, said
there has been a significant redeployment of Yugoslav army troops
to Serbia, including a mechanized brigade that pulled out on
Sunday.
	   Some army units remain in the field, and there is enormous fear
among the people that the violence will resume, particularly among
the huge numbers of displaced people, many of whom are living in
the hills and forests without shelter.
	   Serbian police have pulled back from many checkpoints, and at
others are merely waving road traffic through.
	   Diplomats have observed a substantial reduction in the number of
police in the province, but say a major police presence remains.
Many of the police units are settled into areas where the KLA is
known to be strong, a move some assume is to prevent the KLA from
taking advantage of NATO airstrikes.
	   Significant Yugoslav army units also remain in the Albanian
border region, but diplomats feel this is largely defensive.
	   Kosovo remains a very dangerous place, nonetheless, with lots of
hostility and plenty of guns.
	   What diplomats fear is a major provocation that could force one
side or the other to respond, setting off escalating violence.
	   They also fear that an allied air campaign against the Yugoslav
positions might lead Serb police might exact revenge on the
Albanians.
	   ``If there is a military strike, these guys could just go in and
whack, take off the gloves and go after them,'' said one diplomat.
``There are a lot of innocent Albanians out there that have already
been badly whacked.''

Italian premier struggles to save government

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Premier Romano Prodi said Monday he would appeal
directly to Parliament to save Italy's second-longest government
since World War II, threatened with collapse by the defection of
its Communist ally.
	   The address to Parliament was expected Wednesday, followed
perhaps by Friday by the vote of confidence that will determine
whether Prodi's 2 1/2-year-old, center-left alliance stands or
falls.
	   Prodi's far-left ally, the Communist Refoundation Party,
provoked the crisis by withdrawing its support over the weekend and
saying it would not vote for his deficit-cutting 1999 budget, which
is key to Italy's participation in the European common currency.
	   Prodi has said he would call a confidence vote if he lost the
Communists' support.
	   ``I've always acted with coherence,'' Prodi said before a
morning meeting with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro on the crisis.
``I've never changed strategy and I don't want to do political
gymnastics.''
	   The break with Prodi's government divided Refoundation. Armando
Cossuta, leader of the moderate wing, resigned as party president
Monday.
	   He said the party's desertion of Prodi was ``wrong and
dangerous,'' but at the same time promised to follow the party
line.
	   ``We are in a very complicated political crisis which could lead
to early elections,'' Cossutta told reporters Monday. ``And with
the divisions in the left, this would mean a victory for the
right.''
	   If the crisis comes to a confidence vote and Prodi loses, he
would offer his resignation. Once he does that, it is up to
Scalfaro to decide what to do. He could ask Prodi or someone else
to form a new government or he could call elections 2 1/2 years
early, something most analysts think unlikely.
	   Working in Prodi's favor is the fact that few parties think they
would stand to gain by early elections, including the Communist
Refoundation. There was speculation Prodi would reopen negotiations
that would win back the communists' grudging support, as he has
managed to do in the past.
	   Prodi's government has held together this long in large part
because of the widely shared desire to see Italy qualify for
participation in the 1999 debut of Europe's common currency, the
euro. That happened earlier this year _ leaving the disparate
allies without so clear a reason to stay together.
	   Prodi leads Italy's 55th government since World War II. He has
outlasted all but Bettino Craxi, who served 3{ years in two
back-to-back stints from 1982 to 1986.
	   Refoundation is not part of Prodi's center-left coalition, but
the government needs its 34 votes to muster a majority in the lower
house. It has been a difficult ally from the outset.
	   It broke with Prodi over NATO expansion earlier this year and on
sending troops into Albania last year. Prodi was even forced to
resign a year ago after a bitter battle over spending cuts linked
to the euro. The crisis was resolved, and Prodi returned to work,
after he made steep concessions and promised a 35-hour work week.

UNHCR: kidnapped French staffer alive, believed held in Chechnya
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A French aid worker kidnapped in southern Russia
eight months ago is alive and well, but his whereabouts remain
unknown, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said Monday.
	   Vincent Cochetel, 37, who headed the UNHCR's office in North
Ossetia, near breakaway Chechnya, was seized by three masked gunmen
in his apartment in the region's capital of Vladikavkaz on Jan. 29.
	   His whereabouts are still unknown, but he is believed to be held
in Chechnya, the UNHCR office in Moscow said, according to the
ITAR-Tass news agency. ITAR-Tass also cited UNHCR officials as
saying Cochetel was alive and well, but provided no details.
	   Russian media have said kidnappers have demanded dlrs 1.5
million in ransom for Cochetel's release.
	   Since Chechnya's two-year war of independence against Russia
ended in 1996, hundreds of people have been kidnapped in the
breakaway republic and neighboring regions by armed gangs who are
mostly motivated by ransom. Dozens of people are currently held
captive.
	   The most high-profile captive is Valentin Vlasov, Yeltsin's
envoy to Chechnya. He was kidnapped at gunpoint May 1.

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso has won a second term despite Brazil's economic meltdown in
the last month, becoming the first Brazilian president ever
re-elected.
	   The last hope of his rivals to avert a first-ballot victory
seemed to fade Monday as Cardoso's total increased with returns
from the interior, where the government historically does well.
	   Now it's time for some bitter medicine: Many economists predict
a recession in 1999, deteriorating unemployment and the need to
raise taxes, all which are likely to erode Cardoso's popularity.
	   With 49.4 percent of Sunday's vote counted by Monday, Cardoso
had 50.3 percent to 35.6 percent for his closest rival, Workers
Party candidate Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. Ciro Gomes of the
moderate PPS party had 10.6 percent of the vote and nine other
candidates shared the rest.
	   The outcome was no surprise to the 106 million Brazilians who
chose a president, 27 governors, all 513 federal deputies, a third
of the 81-seat Senate and 1,405 state legislators. Cardoso had been
the front-runner for the entire campaign.
	   Voting is mandatory for Brazilians. And for the first time, more
than half of them used electronic voting machines instead of paper
ballots. The electronic votes were tallied quickly, but the rest
weren't to be counted until Friday, electoral officials said.
	   ``It's very good for Brazil that the president has received this
mandate from the Brazilian people and that he can now do what is
needed to protect the real (the local currency) and the Brazilian
people,'' Foreign Minister Luis Felipe Lampreia told reporters in
Brasilia.
	   Cardoso's popularity stems largely from the success of the
``Real Plan'' _ the economic stabilization plan he helped design
and which dropped inflation from around 2,400 percent a year to
near zero now.
	   Even the country's deepening financial woes _ partly due to
fallout from Russia's economic crisis _ and the inevitability of
harsh measures to contain them failed to persuade voters to change
the man at the helm.
	   ``The electorate approved his clear message that he would do all
in his power to guarantee the survival of the Real Plan and the
stability it brought to prices,'' said Joaquim Eloy de Toledo, an
economist at the University of Sao Paulo.
	   But Cardoso may have little room to maneuver.
	   Brazil's Congress has little party discipline and has managed to
delay essential reforms throughout most of the president's first
term.
	   Cardoso earned high marks with the international investment
community when he pledged strong measures to control a ballooning
budget deficit of more than dlrs 60 billion, but the effects of
those measures have yet to be felt at home.
	   Widespread popular support may give the president a honeymoon
period to push through desperately needed fiscal reforms, but that
support is likely to erode as the effects of austerity measures
sink in.
	   Finance Minister Pedro Malan is heading negotiations for an
emergency loan package reportedly worth dlrs 30 billion with the
International Monetary Fund and other public and private lenders.
	   In Washington, White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said:
``The elections results seem to be a statement of support for
reform and it's important for them to get on with the reforms that
they've been considering.''

EU accelerates talks with `fast-track' candidates, including
</HEADLINE>
Cyprus &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments, details; CLARIFIES Nov. 10 start date
of detailed talks; ADDS Germany wanting to see Cyprus reunified
prior to enlargement &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ The European Union nations agreed Monday to
accelerate enlargement talks with five eastern neighbors and
Cyprus, but ignored a demand by France, the Netherlands and Germany
that Cyprus be told it can only join if it first ends its division.
	   ``We want a political solution for the island under the aegis of
the United Nations,'' said Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang
Schuessel, the chairman of an EU foreign ministers meeting.
	   He reiterated the EU's stated view that simply starting
enlargement talks will help ``facilitate a political settlement''
of Cyprus' division.
	   The ministers also asked the European Commission to ``reassess''
its 1993 approval of Malta's 1990 membership application. The
Mediterranean island nation reapplied Sept. 11 after its previous
government put EU membership on ice.
	   And they welcomed the recent election win of opposition parties
in Slovakia, saying they hoped for a restoration of full democracy
after six years of autocratic rule by Prime Minister Vladimir
Meciar.
	   Schuessel told reporters ``screening'' talks that began March 31
with Cyprus, Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Estonia and
Slovenia have gone so well the foreign ministers said detailed
negotiations can begin Nov. 10.
	   France, Germany and the Netherlands insisted Cyprus should be
cautioned it can only join if its Greek and Turkish communities are
reunified first. The foreign ministers did not act on the
suggestion.
	   Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos said Turkish Cypriots
have rebuffed efforts by Nicosia to include them in an all-Cyprus
negotiating team.
	   He said it would be ``regrettable'' if a divided Cyprus joined
the EU but that division ``will be no obstacle.'' He said ``a
divided Germany'' helped create the EU and the world recognizes a
Bosnia-Herzegovina comprising three ethnic camps.
	   Pangalos said several countries insisted on a reunification of
Cyprus prior to EU membership ``but only France made that a
precondition. And they received an appropriate response.''
	   However, French Foreign Minister Hubvert Vedrine insisted
``there cannot be automatic membership (in the EU) for a divided
Cyprus.''
	   Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded
the north following an abortive coup by elements favoring union
with Greece. Turkish Cypriots have declared their own Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus, labeled illegal by the United Nations
and recognized only by Turkey.
	   To become an EU member, candidates must adopt the entire
spectrum of EU rules, regulations and laws. These cover 31 chapters
_ from agriculture, energy, foreign affairs and monetary union to
corporate and banking laws, consumer health protection and
telecommunications standards and practices.
	   Estonia has said by 2002 or 2003 it will be EU-compatible in 12
chapters, Hungary in 11. Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovenia and
Cyprus say they will comply with seven chapters by then.
	   The recommendation to start more detailed talks came in a report
from the EU Commission. The EU has not fixed an entry date for any
of the six ``fast-track'' candidates. In addition, Lithuania,
Latvia, Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria are also in line to join,
albeit much later.

Ghosts of Communists haunt another French-Italian meeting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By FRANCES D'EMILIO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FLORENCE, Italy (AP) _ French President Jacques Chirac and
Premier Lionel Jospin, traveling here Monday, were likely to give a
boost to Italian Premier Romano Prodi as he fights to stay in
office despite a key ally's rebellion.
	   For a second straight year, the ghost of Italian Communists
haunted a summit between Rome and Paris.
	   Last year, the annual top-level bilateral talks, then held in
Chambery, France, came as Communist unhappiness over Prodi's
planned budget cuts forced the premier to offer his resignation.
	   This year, the crisis is worse. On Sunday, the leadership of
Italy's Communists, who give Prodi's center-left Olive Tree
coalition a majority in the lower Chamber of Deputies, voted to
yank support for the government and to veto the latest budget
proposal.
	   Prodi appeared headed for a confidence vote this week. A loss
could lead to early elections or a reshuffled Cabinet.
	   In 1997, Prodi wooed back the Communists by embracing Jospin's
push for a 35-hour work week, a key demand by Italian Communist
leader Fausto Bertinotti, who also provoked the latest crisis.
	   This year's French-Italian talks were scheduled to start Monday
evening. More talks are set for Tuesday.
	   Jospin recently described the prospects for an Italian political
mess for the country's left, ``hardly comprehensible,'' given world
market turmoil.
	   In an interview published Monday in Milan's Corriere della Sera
daily, the French foreign minister took pains to indicate that the
current political uncertainty in Italy would not exclude Rome as a
major European player.
	   ``Why would (Italy) need to be reassured?'' Minister Hubert
Vedrine asked. ``It deserved its place in the euro .... In France,
we have never doubted that Italy was indispensable for the
equilibrium of Europe and for that of the single currency.''
	   Two years ago, another cloud hung over the summit, which was
almost canceled at the last minute when Chirac questioned the
soundness of Italian finances in Italy's drive for participation in
Europe's common currency, the euro.
	   Keeping up with deficit cutting has convinced Prodi to stick to
his proposed 1999 budget, despite Bertinotti's demands that more
funds be found for creating jobs and helping the poor.

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Azerbaijani President Geidar Aliev is
expected to decide later this month on the main export route for
transporting Caspian Sea oil, the president of neighboring Georgia
said Monday.
	   Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze met in Tbilisi on Sunday
with an Azerbaijani delegation that is drawing up the route for the
main flows of Caspian oil.
	   The head of the delegation, Valekh Aleskerov, told Shevardnadze
that Georgia would soon receive draft agreements on the pipeline
route, the Georgian leader's press service said.
	   It quoted Aleskerov as saying Aliev would make a final decision
on the route this month.
	   The first flows of Caspian oil are being transported from Baku,
Azerbaijan's capital, to the Russian port of Novorossiisk on the
Black Sea.
	   Construction of a pipeline from Baku to the Georgian Black Sea
village of Supsa and on to the Turkish port of Ceyhan is under way.
Turkey and Georgia have pressed for the bulk of the Caspian oil to
travel through that pipeline instead of through Russia.

Iranian parliament says Rushdie death edict still in force
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ More than half the members of Iran's
hard-line parliament have signed a letter saying the death edict
against British author Salman Rushdie stands.
	   The letter, broadcast Sunday on Iranian television, was prompted
by Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi's announcement last month
distancing the government from the fatwa and the dlrs 2.5 million
bounty placed on Rushdie's head in 1989 by a semi-official Iranian
foundation.
	   ``As Majlis deputies, we assure Muslims all over the world that,
in this case, nothing except the decrees issued by God and
(Khomeini) in Iran have any credibility and no one has the power to
follow any other path,'' said the letter, according to the
television report.
	   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the late Iranian leader, said that
Rushdie must die for blaspheming Islam in his novel ``The Satanic
Verses.''
	   The Rushdie affair strained ties with the European Union.
Moderate President Mohammad Khatami, who defeated Nateq-Nouri in
elections in 1997, has been trying to improve ties with the West
since he took office.
	   Britain announced the resumption of ties after Kharrazi's
announcement
	   Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri, the parliament speaker left Sunday for
talks in Italy and Spain, to discuss political issues and to expand
trade relations between Tehran and the two countries.
	   Nateq-Nouri, also known as a hard-liner, has not publicly
commented on the government's distancing itself from the fatwa.

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ With the threat of NATO attack
mounting, Yugoslavia's prime minister warned Monday the nation
faces the ``imminent danger of war'' and claimed the government is
taking steps to comply with international demands for peace in
Kosovo.
	   But NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana told reporters that the
Alliance believed Yugoslavia had not yet met the conditions
demanded by the U.N. Security Council.
	   ``The reality coming to us is that the compliance is not yet in
place,'' Solana said. ``As far as we are concerned, once again, I
can tell you we are ready.''
	   In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said ``systematic
terror'' had been inflicted on Kosovo civilians within recent days
and that Yugoslav forces were mostly responsible.
	   But Annan said he did not ``have the means necessary to provide
an independent assessment of compliance as required by the Security
Council'' and suggested the 15 members may want to make their ``own
judgement in this respect.''
	   Following a meeting with Solana in Brussels, Belgium, U.S.
special envoy Richard Holbrooke said the situation in the southern
Serbian province was as bad now as two weeks ago. Holbrooke left
later for Belgrade to tell Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic of
``the extreme gravity of the situation.''
	   Meanwhile, Yugoslavia's prime minister told an emergency session
of parliament Monday that the country ``is faced with the imminent
danger of war.'' Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the main republic
of Yugoslavia.
	   ``The threats are serious,'' Prime Minister Momir Bulatovic
said. ``And I call on this parliament to conclude that Yugoslavia
is faced with the imminent danger of war. Yugoslavia has to defend
itself if it was attacked.''
	   One option could be for parliament to declare a state of
emergency _ a step which could lead to a general mobilization of
all military-aged men.
	   In an attempt to head off NATO action, Bulatovic said the
government had accepted a Russian proposal for the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe to investigate the crisis.
	   Yugoslavia had repeatedly rejected such a mission to Kosovo
until Yugoslav membership in the 54-nation organization is
restored.
	   Bulatovic also claimed there was no longer any fighting in the
rebellious, majority Albanian province. He said five of the 10
special police units had been removed from Kosovo and the others
had been returned to barracks in the province.
	   In Brussels, however, Holbrooke made clear that half-measures
would not be enough to satisfy Washington and prevent a NATO
attack.
	   ``While the level of fighting may have abated temporarily, the
capacity for its resumption is there,'' Holbrooke said after
meeting with Solana and Supreme Allied Commander Europe Gen. Wesley
K. Clark.
	   ``The situation, therefore, remains fully as serious today as it
was a week or two ago,'' he said. ``We hope to make clear to
president Milosevic and the people of Yugoslavia the extreme
gravity of the situation.''
	   Holbrooke said Solana and Clark told him that ``significant
military forces, regular forces and military uniformed police,
remain in Kosovo,'' despite claims of significant withdrawals.

Blair Cabinet united on Kosovo air strikes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES to add cancellation of soccer match between Ireland
and Yugoslavia in graf 6 &QL; 
 &UR; With NATO-Kosovo, EU-Kosovo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prime Minister Tony Blair's Cabinet met in special
session Monday and were united in urging imminent air strikes
against Serb forces in Kosovo, officials said.
	   ``We are getting ready for NATO action and later this week we
will expect a decision to be taken,'' Foreign Secretary Robin Cook
said after the meeting. ``Milosevic (Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic) has only a few days this week to listen to the
international community.''
	   Britain's Chief of Defense Staff, Gen. Sir Charles Guthrie, was
at the morning meeting, arranged before Blair left on a visit to
China.
	   Blair's government has been the most forthright in Europe in
urging military action against Serb forces in retaliation for
brutal treatment of the ethnic Albanian majority of the Yugoslav
province.
	   ``All members of the Cabinet of this government are united in
our determination that President Milosevic must be compelled to
abide by the terms of the Security Council resolution,'' Cook told
reporters. ``He must stop hostilities in Kosovo and allow the
refugees to return in safety and he also has to start real dialogue
with the international community.''
	   Meanwhile, a European Championship soccer qualifying match
between Ireland and Yugoslavia, due to have been played in Belgrade
on Saturday, was canceled Monday. The game was postponed by UEFA,
the game's European governing body, for security reasons. Last
week, a match between England and Yugoslavia was scrapped for
similar reasons.

<TEXT>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ Guerrillas detonated roadside bombs in
southern Lebanon on Monday, killing two Israeli soldiers and
injuring three others, Lebanese security officials said.
	   Hezbollah, the Shiite Muslim guerrilla group fighting Israeli
forces in the south, claimed responsibility, saying its fighters
simultaneously detonated two bombs as an Israeli convoy was
passing.
	   A statement from the group said the targeted road linked bases
manned by Israeli troops and their allied South Lebanon Army
militia.
	   There was no immediate comment from Israel on the incident.
	   The Lebanese officials, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity, said the Israelis were in a vehicle on the main road
leading into the town of Hasbaya when the bombs exploded at 3 p.m.
(1200 GMT).
	   The casualties were first brought to Marjayoun, the main town in
the Israeli-occupied zone, and later taken to Israel, the officials
said. One of the soldiers was killed instantly and four were
wounded. One of the wounded later died, the officials said.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah and other Lebanese guerrilla groups
are fighting to oust Israel from its self-styled ``security zone''
in southern Lebanon.
	   Israel established the border enclave in 1985 to try to prevent
cross-border guerrilla attacks.

Crimean Tatar activist honored for refugee integration efforts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ A Crimean Tatar activist was awarded a dlrs
100,000 prize Monday for his efforts in helping his people
reintegrate in Ukraine since they were allowed to return in 1989.
	   Mustafa Dzhemilev, 55, was chosen to receive the 1998 Nansen
Medal ``for his commitment to the right of return of the Crimean
Tatar people,'' said U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako
Ogata.
	   Soviet dictator Josef Stalin exiled the Tatars to Central Asia,
mainly Uzbekistan and Kazakstan, in 1944 for allegedly helping the
Nazi cause during World War II.
	   Dzhemilev, born in Ukraine's Crimean peninsula, was less than
one year old at the time. From 1966 to 1986, he lived under
surveillance, in hard-labor camps, forced exile and Soviet prisons,
UNHCR said.
	   He returned to Crimea in 1989 and is a Ukrainian lawmaker,
working with UNHCR to help returning Tatars.
	   More than 250,000 Crimean Tatars have returned to their homeland
since then, leading to financial and citizenship problems.
	   Ukrainian authorities say some 81,000 Tatars holding another
passport cannot become Ukrainian citizens because of legislation
banning double citizenship. About 15,000 Tatars have no citizenship
at all.
	   Those problems prompted clashes between Tatars and Ukrainian
police earlier this year. Tatars demanded voting rights for
non-citizens and a representation quota in the Crimean parliament.
	   Ukraine and Uzbekistan have recently signed an agreement
simplifying the procedure for changing citizenship. Ogata welcomed
it as a ``major step toward finding a durable solution.''
	   The Ukrainian government has spent about dlrs 300 million since
1992 to accommodate the returning Tatars, but at least half of the
returnees still have no permanent place to live.
	   The prize, donated by Norway and Switzerland, was created in
1954 to call attention to the plight of refugees. It was named
after Norwegian explorer Fridtjof Nansen, the refugee chief for the
League of Nations, forerunner of the United Nations.

Algerian prime minister rules out rescheduling his country's debt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Algeria has dlrs 8 billion in foreign
exchange reserves and does not intend to try to reschedule its
foreign debt, the country's prime minister said in a newspaper
interview published Monday.
	   Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia told the El Moudjahid daily the
country's foreign exchange reserves would protect it from economic
turmoil despite the drop in oil prices which cuts into its hard
currency earnings.
	   Neighboring Morocco just last week signed a debt easing
agreement with France in order to alleviate the costly burden of
repaying the interest on its international obligations.
	   Algeria's foreign debt amounts to dlrs 30 billion, the most
important part of which was rescheduled in 1994 and 1995.
Reimbursement of the principal on the largest part of the debt is
to begin this year and will be spread over the next 12 years.
	   Algeria owes dlrs 5.6 billion in s debt payments this year.
	   But Ouyahia said that rescheduling the debt was ``absolutely not
on today's agenda,'' the newspaper quoted him as saying.

KLA refutes accusation that it too commits atrocities

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ As hundreds of Kosovo Albanians gathered outside
U.N. offices in Switzerland to demand military intervention, rebels
fighting for independence for the Serbian province denied Monday
that they have committed atrocities against Serbs.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said on Monday that although
the United Nations believes Serb forces are responsible for the
great majority of atrocities so far in Kosovo, there is reason to
believe ethnic Albanian forces have also committed them. He didn't
give examples.
	   On Wednesday, the chief of the U.N. refugee agency, Sadako
Ogata, said she believes the KLA is also guilty of using
``excessive force.''
	   ``We have never committed acts which violate human rights,''
said Bardhyl Mahmuti, political representative of the Kosovo
Liberation Army.
	   Mahmuti called the claims ``absolutely inaccurate'' and demanded
proof to back them up.
	   The United States warned Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
on Friday that NATO will strike Serb targets within two weeks
unless he complies with every U.N. demand to halt his assault on
ethnic Albanians, to allow relief to reach refugees and to
negotiate peace.
	   Hundreds of people brandishing banners reading ``Peace and
Liberty for Kosovo'' and ``Military Intervention for Kosovo''
protested Monday outside the U.N. European headquarters in Geneva,
demanding NATO military strikes against Serb forces.
	   Forces from Serbia, the larger of two republics comprising
Yugoslavia, have been trying since February to crush the ethnic
Albanian KLA. Hundreds of people have died in the fighting in the
largely ethnic Albanian province and 275,000 have been routed from
their homes.
	   ``We are here to protest against the indifference of the
international community to what is happening in Kosovo,'' Avdija
Ramadan, one of the organizers of the demonstration, said.
	   Jashar Salihu, another KLA spokesman, urged immediate military
action against the Serb security forces and reiterated the KLA's
determination to continue fighting for independence for the
province.
	   ``The only language the Serb regime understands is the language
of force,'' Salihu added.
	   Meanwhile, the Swiss government announced that 68 percent of
asylum applications made in September in the country came from
Yugoslavia. Some 4,581 applications were made, almost double the
figure for last year.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana
said Monday Yugoslavia had not yet complied with United Nations
resolutions on Kosovo and stressed that NATO was ready to launch a
military attack.
	   ``The reality coming to us is that the compliance is not yet in
place,'' Solana told reporters. He was reacting to U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan's statement in New York that he lacked
the means to verify whether Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
had complied with the U.N. demands.
	   ``As far as we are concerned, once again, I can tell you we are
ready,'' Solana said.
	   Solana had already met earlier Monday with U.S. special envoy
Richard Holbrooke, who said the military situation in Kosovo
remains critical despite a lull in fighting and the removal of some
Yugoslav tanks and troops from the battlefield.
	   After a meeting with Solana and Supreme Allied Commander Europe
Wesley K. Clark, Holbrooke said ``while the level of fighting (in
Kosovo) may have abated temporarily, the capacity for its
resumption is there.''
	   ``The situation therefore remains fully as serious today as it
was a week or two ago,'' he told reporters before flying to
Belgrade.
	   He said Solana and Clark told him that ``significant military
forces, regular forces and military uniformed police, remain in
Kosovo.''
	   The United States has strongly urged NATO to act but European
allies have shown caution and resisted calls for NATO to set a
deadline for Milosevic to pull his Kosovo forces back.
	   Holbrooke was told NATO preparations to launch military action
against Yugoslavia continue.
	   ``At NATO, the planning for military action is serious, intense
and sustained,'' he said.
	   Solana said that ``Mr. Holbrooke will tell Milosevic that the
resolution of the U.N. Security Council is there to be complied
with. If not, he knows that NATO is prepared to act.''
	   NATO has approved an ``activation request'' for the 16 allied
nations to formally commit warplanes and other forces for an
eventual air campaign.
	   However, the NATO Council, made up of ambassadors from the
allied nations, has come no closer to taking a political decision
to launch air raids and failed to overcome differences over whether
the alliance needs a clearer U.N. mandate before it can attack.
	   NATO sources said U.S. Secretary of State Madeline Albright is
coming to Brussels for a NATO Council meeting on Thursday. It was
unclear how many other NATO foreign ministers would join her.
	   A NATO source who declined to be named said no final conclusion
should be expected before then.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan told the
Security Council Monday that most of the recent atrocities in
Kosovo were committed by Yugoslav forces and their attacks on
ethnic Albanians increased following a U.N. resolution demanding a
cease-fire.
	   However, in a widely anticipated report, the U.N. chief said he
didn't have the means to verify whether Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic had complied with U.N. resolutions demanding an end to
the hostilities. Annan recommended that the Security Council
determine such compliance using his report as a guideline.
	   NATO members had been waiting for the report to decide whether
they would take military action in the southern Serb province,
where Serb forces have tried to crush an independence movement by
Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority.
	   It wasn't clear if Annan's report would be the decision-making
document NATO had sought. The document essentially reiterates what
others have said for weeks and dodges the thornier issue of
actually determining Serb compliance with U.N. resolutions.
	   In his report, Annan decried the ``appalling atrocities in
Kosovo, reminiscent of the recent past elsewhere in the Balkans.''
	   ``It is clear beyond any reasonable doubt that the great
majority of such acts have been committed by security forces in
Kosovo acting under the authority of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia,'' he wrote.
	   But he noted that ethnic Albanian forces also have been fighting
and said there was reason to believe that they were responsible for
atrocities as well.
	   In its latest resolution, adopted Sept. 23, the council
specifically asked the U.N. chief to report on his assessment of
the compliance with council demands for a cease-fire, the
withdrawal of Milosevic's special forces from Kosovo and a
negotiated settlement.
	   In Monday's report, Annan said he couldn't supply that
assessment because the United Nations has no political presence on
the ground in Kosovo and was relying on information from other
organizations and European sources.
	   He said he could provide information only about the humanitarian
situation through the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and other
humanitarian groups in Kosovo.
	   ``Therefore, the council may wish to make its own judgment in
this respect on the basis of the present report,'' Annan wrote,
referring to Serb compliance.
	   However, Annan did report that in the week following the Sept.
23 resolution, government security forces ``intensified their
operations, launching another offensive in the Drenica region,''
and elsewhere.
	   Fighting continued Sept. 28-29 despite the Serb prime minister's
statement that Serb operations had ended and peace reigned in
Kosovo, he said.
	   Serbia is the larger of two republics comprising Yugoslavia.
Milosevic launched a crackdown in February against
independence-seeking rebels in Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians
constitute 90 percent of the population. Hundreds have died in the
fighting, and 275,000 have been routed from their homes.
	   The West is opposed to independence for Kosovo, but wants
Milosevic to return the autonomy he stripped from the province in
1989.
	   The United States warned Milosevic on Friday that NATO will
strike Serb targets within two weeks unless he complies with every
U.N. demand.
	   In its Sept. 23 resolution, the council renewed demands and
threatened unspecified measures if both sides failed to abide.
	   Since then, photos and reports of a massacre of ethnic Albanians
have been published around the world, heightening calls for
military intervention.
	   The council urged the U.N. chief to speed up his report _
originally expected midweek _ to Monday so it could begin
discussions as early as Tuesday.
	   In his report, the U.N. chief called for the safe return of
refugees, the withdrawal of Milosevic's special police units and a
negotiated settlement.
	   Serb forces have the duty to maintain public order, he said.
	   ``However, this can in no way justify the systematic terror
inflicted on civilians these past few days and weeks,'' he said.

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso has won a second term despite Brazil's economic meltdown in
the last month, becoming the first Brazilian president ever
re-elected.
	   The last hope of his rivals to avert a first-ballot victory
seemed to fade Monday as Cardoso's total increased with returns
from the interior, where the government historically does well.
	   Now it's time for some bitter medicine: Many economists predict
a recession in 1999, deteriorating unemployment and the need to
raise taxes, all which are likely to erode Cardoso's popularity.
	   With 53 percent of Sunday's vote counted by Monday, Cardoso had
50.5 percent of the valid votes, compared to 34 percent for his
closest rival, Workers Party candidate Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.
Ciro Gomes of the leftist PPS party had 11.2 percent of the vote
and nine other candidates shared the rest.

Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands from
the National Weather Service.
	   High pressure centered over the southwest Atlantic and a strong
tropical wave located across the west-central Atlantic between 45
and 50 degrees west are combining to produce the strong trade winds
across the region.
	   This high pressure will drift west during the next few days,
with the tropical wave continuing to attempt to intensify. Locally,
this is expected to sustain breezy conditions and scattered passing
trade wind showers through Tuesday morning.
	   Isolated thunderstorms are possible this afternoon across west
and southwestern Puerto Rico.
	   Rough marine conditions will improve slightly during the next 24
hours as winds begin to gradually diminish. The tropical wave will
move west towards the eastern Caribbean through Tuesday, but beyond
that time the forecast remains uncertain for our area.
	   Should the tropical wave intensify, it will likely move
northwest, then north and miss the northeast Caribbean.
	   Should the tropical wave have a difficult time intensifying, it
could then move into the northeast Caribbean to bring heavy rain
and gusty winds to our region. Local interests are therefore
advised to closely monitor this tropical system.

	   Qin told reporters after signing the accord that China believed
in dialogue on the question of human rights ``on the basis of
mutual respect.'' He said a recent trip to China by the top U.N.
human rights official, Mary Robinson, helped both sides understand
each other better.
	   ``I would like to reaffirm here the willingness of the Chinese
government to further its cooperation with the U.N. in the field of
human rights in an effort to push forward together the development
of the international cause of human rights.''
	   Qin's signing came exactly 31 years after Taiwan signed the
accord, when it was still a member state of the United Nations. The
Taiwanese government lost its seat in the United Nations in 1971
when the organization accepted the Communist government in Beijing
as the sole representative of the Chinese people.
	   Qin concluded his comments by declaring Taiwan's signature
illegal and ``null and void.''
	   The treaty was adopted by the U.N. General Assembly in 1966 and
went into force a decade later. Since then, 140 countries have
ratified it or acceded to it.
	   The treaty states that all people have the right of
self-determination. It prohibits torture, cruel or degrading
punishment and provides for freedom of movement, thought, religion
and expression, among other things.
	   States that have signed on to the treaty are required to submit
an initial report within one year of ratification, and periodic
reports every five years thereafter.

Arrests in skinhead attack on Iranian; Beating of teacher probed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DRESDEN, Germany (AP) _ Four German teen-agers were arrested
Monday on attempted murder charges stemming from a neo-Nazi gang
attack on two Iranian refugees that left one seriously injured.
	   The two Iranian teen-agers were headed home Sept. 26 in Leipzig
when they were attacked by a large group wielding baseball bats,
iron rods and fists.
	   One managed to flee, but the other Iranian, who is 16 years old,
was beaten so severely he remains hospitalized in serious condition
and may have permanent injuries, police in the eastern state of
Saxony said.
	   The four suspects arrested Monday are between 17 and 19 years
old, police said. Nine others from the far right scene were
questioned and released, but the investigation against them remains
open.
	   Also Monday, police in the nearby city of Erfurt said they had
opened an investigation into a week-old attack on a teacher who was
beaten up while trying to protect his students on a school trip
from a group of 10 skinheads.
	   Police director Reiner Grube said no complaints had been filed
about the attack, which they only learned about Monday by reading a
report in the Bild tabloid newspaper.
	   Bild identified the teach only as Lothar B., 47, from western
Germany and said he suffered several broken ribs and a broken
tooth.
	   Grube said police had not yet been able to contact the teacher.

Trial begins for young couple accused of killing schoolmate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The trial of a young couple accused of killing a
16-year-old schoolmate during an intimate encounter began Monday at
a juvenile court in suburban Paris.
	   The parents of Abdeladim, the victim, burst into tears as the
accused, Veronique Herbert, now 20, and Sebastien, now 19, entered
the courtroom.
	   Under French law, the last names of Sebastien and Abdeladim have
not been released because they were minors at the time of the
killing.
	   Prosecutors say Veronique and Sebastien lured Abdeladim to
Sebastien's house in March 1996, telling him Veronique was
attracted to him.
	   In Sebastien's room, Veronique and Abdeladim took off their
clothes and became intimate as Sebastien watched, prosecutors said.
	   Then, on Veronique's cue, Sebastien began stabbing Abdeladim,
and Veronique joined in, prosecutors said. The two allegedly buried
the body and fled. They were captured three days after the murder.
	   At Monday's trial, when judges asked Veronique for her
occupation, the young woman with long, dark hair responded without
hesitation, ``I am a student.''
	   Sebastien, wearing jeans, told judges he was studying to be a
professional cleaner at a trade school.
	   The evidence presented to the jury included a videotape of
Oliver Stone's 1994 movie ``Natural Born Killers.''
	   According to the prosecution, Veronique had a morbid fascination
for the film, which follows a young, much-in-love couple on a
killing spree, with the attendant media attention.
	   Although the first 40 minutes of the trial were open to
reporters and the public, the rest of the trial will be held behind
closed doors until Friday, when the verdict is expected.
	   The young couple face life imprisonment if convicted.

Italy's foremost art critic and historian dies at 77
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Federico Zeri, Italy's leading art critic and
historian, died of a heart attack Monday in his artwork-filled
villa in Mentana, outside Rome. He was 77.
	   An expert in Italian paintings of the 14th-16th centuries, Zeri
had won respect in foreign art circles as well as Italy's.
	   ``It's a great loss for the culture of Italy and of the whole
world,'' Culture Minister Walter Veltroni said. Zeri had been the
vice president of the National Council for Cultural Patrimony since
1993.
	   In 1995, he became the only Italian to be awarded foreign
membership of France's Academy of Fine Arts.
	   Zeri was an art history professor in the University of Rome and
taught at several American universities, including Columbia and
Harvard. A consultant with several galleries and private
collections, he had also been the trustee for the Paul Getty Museum
in Malibu.
	   He lived in a villa-museum in Mentana, his hometown, about 60 km
(40 miles) north of Rome, surrounded by his private collections and
his own paintings and sculptures.
	   In Italy, Zeri's fame went beyond literary and academic circles.
His ironic and outspoken personality made him a perfect guest for
national TV shows _ a role he didn't disdain.
	   In the early 1980s, he was the first one _ and, for a long time,
the only one _ to realize that some newly found sculptures were not
attributable to Modigliani, as all the other experts claimed. The
case drew national attention _ and the sculptures were proven to be
fake.
	   Zeri was also a prolific writer. Among his major publications
were the 1959 essay ``Pittura e Controriforma'' (``Painting and
Counterreformation'') and a four-volume catalogue of the Italian
paintings in New York's Metropolitan Museum.
	   No funeral plans were announced for Zeri, who was single.

China signs key human rights pact

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ China signed a key human rights treaty
Monday that calls for freedom of expression, religion and
self-determination and pledged its willingness to safeguard human
rights.
	   The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is one
of two accords seen as fundamental to protecting human rights.
China has signed the other one _ the International Covenant on
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights _ but hasn't ratified it.
	   In a signing ceremony at U.N. headquarters, China's U.N.
ambassador, Qin Huasun, said the Chinese government was
deliberating now on ratifying that accord.
	   ``All these have demonstrated the firm resolve of China to
promote and protect human rights,'' Qin said.
	   Meanwhile, in Beijing police hauled a prominent human rights
campaigner in for questioning Monday. Qin Yongmin's latest run-in
with the authorities came as he tried for the second time in a week
to legally register a human rights monitoring group.
	   The Chinese ambassador told reporters after signing the accord
that China believed in dialogue on the question of human rights
``on the basis of mutual respect.'' He said a recent trip to China
by the top U.N. human rights official, Mary Robinson, helped both
sides understand each other better.
	   ``I would like to reaffirm here the willingness of the Chinese
government to further its cooperation with the U.N. in the field of
human rights in an effort to push forward together the development
of the international cause of human rights.''
	   Qin's signing came exactly 31 years after Taiwan signed the
accord, when it was still a member state of the United Nations. The
Taiwanese government lost its seat in the United Nations in 1971
when the organization accepted the Communist government in Beijing
as the sole representative of the Chinese people.
	   Qin concluded his comments by declaring Taiwan's signature
illegal and ``null and void.''
	   The treaty was adopted by the U.N. General Assembly in 1966 and
went into force a decade later. Since then, 140 countries have
ratified it or acceded to it.
	   The treaty states that all people have the right of
self-determination. It prohibits torture, cruel or degrading
punishment and provides for freedom of movement, thought, religion
and expression, among other things.
	   States that have signed on to the treaty are required to submit
an initial report within one year of ratification, and periodic
reports every five years thereafter.

Three ANC members killed in violence-torn region
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ Gunmen fatally shot three brothers,
all of them members of the African National Congress, in a region
of smouldering political violence, police said on Monday.
	   George Ngubane, an ANC branch secretary, and his brothers
Zenzamuhle and Sipho were slain as they were driving on Sunday
afternoon at Inadi in the Midlands region of KwaZulu-Natal.
	   Police said six other people were seriously injured in the
ambush and 53 spent AK-47 cartridges were found at the scene.
	   The Indian Ocean province of KwaZulu-Natal was the scene of a
low-level civil war in the 1980s and 1990s between the ruling ANC
and the Zulu nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party that killed 10,000
people.
	   Though now more peaceful, political violence in the region still
flares. Recently a feud between the ANC and another opposition
group, the United Democratic Movement, has cost dozens of lives in
the Midlands' town of Richmond near Durban.
	   Political analysts fear that violence may be on the rise again
as the country gears up for national elections next year.
	   Sipho Gcabashe, ANC provincial secretary in KwaZulu-Natal,
called for calm in the wake of the latest murders. He blamed them
on unnamed political opponents trying to stop the ANC from
organizing in the area.
	   ``This is an act by those elements who still believe that their
selfish sectarian political interest can be safe if the ANC remains
a banned organization in their areas,''Gcabashe said.

Foreign Office says British company ignored warnings over Chechnya

Chechen official says one kidnapper wounded; ADDS in graf 4 that
Chechen company offers reward. No pickup &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A Foreign Office minister said Monday that the
British phone company whose four employees were kidnapped in
Chechnya at the weekend was specifically warned to withdraw from
Russia's breakaway region, but ignored the advice.
	   ``The advice could not have been clearer, the risks were known
to the company and to the employees,'' said Foreign Office Minister
Derek Fatchett in a British Broadcasting Corp. radio interview.
``The fact that they ignored that advice is a decision they took
themselves and is their responsibility ... It's a mature world and
people have to take mature decisions.''
	   The company, Granger Telecom, said it knew Chechnya was probably
the world's most dangerous place for kidnapping but thought its
staff would be well-protected because they were working on a
government contract to install a telecommunications system.
	   Three of the kidnaped men, Britons Darren Hickey and Rudolph
Petschi and New Zealander Stanley Shaw, worked for Granger. The
British company said the fourth hostage, Briton Peter Kennedy, may
have been employed directly by Chechen Telecom, which has offered a
reward for information about the kidnapping.
	   The men were seized early Saturday after a shoot-out with their
bodyguards. There was no word on any ransom demand for the four
men.
	   ``We had a general advice from the Foreign Office about visits
to Chechnya but no specific advice about us,'' Granger Telecom
chief executive Ray Verth told the BBC.
	   Verth, who has now suspended operations in Chechnya, said the
company had considered the contract, worth several million dollars,
justified the risk. The company was 12 months into a five-year
contract to install 300,000 telephone lines across Chechnya.
	   Hickey had been in the region since early August and was due
back in Britain this week, said Verth. Shaw had been in Chechnya
only a week and Petschi for 2 1/2 weeks.
	   ``None of our employees were forced to go, they voluntarily went
_ they knew the risks,'' said Verth. ``We understood and believed
they were well catered for because we were contracted with the
Chechen government and Chechen Telecom, who guaranteed our safety,
which obviously has not occurred.''
	   Fatchett said Britain would do all it could to get the men
released.
	   Hickey's sister said Monday his family is devastated. ``He was
just out there doing a job to help the country get their
communications back,'' said a tearful Deborah Hickey, 21.
	   Hickey, who is single and lives with his parents at Thames
Ditton, south of London, had been to Chechnya twice before, she
said, ``and he thought there was no danger at all,'' despite having
heard gunfire on a previous trip _ ``he said that was part of it.''
	   She did not blame Granger. ``Darren is old enough to make his
own decision to go out there or not,'' she said.
	   The Russian news agency ITAR-Tass on Monday quoted Magomed
Magomadov, Chechen deputy procurator-general, as saying one of the
kidnappers was wounded and received treatment at the district
hospital in Urus-Martan.
	   The men were seized just two weeks after Chechen warlords
released two British charity workers who had been held for 14
months.
	   London's Guardian newspaper said Monday that the latest
kidnappings ``cast fresh doubt on Foreign Office claims to have
paid no ransom'' to secure the release of the charity workers.

Italian premier struggles to save government

	   ROME (AP) _ Premier Romano Prodi said Monday he would appeal
directly to Parliament to save Italy's second-longest government
since World War II, threatened with collapse by the defection of
its Communist ally.
	   The address to Parliament was expected Wednesday, followed
perhaps by Friday by the vote of confidence that will determine
whether Prodi's 2 1/2-year-old, center-left alliance stands or
falls.
	   Prodi's far-left ally, the Communist Refoundation Party,
provoked the crisis by withdrawing its support over the weekend and
saying it would not vote for his deficit-cutting 1999 budget, which
is key to Italy's participation in the European common currency.
	   Prodi has said he would call a confidence vote if he lost the
Communists' support.
	   ``I've always acted with coherence,'' Prodi said before a
morning meeting with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro on the crisis.
``I've never changed strategy and I don't want to do political
gymnastics.''
	   The break with Prodi's government divided Refoundation. Armando
Cossutta, leader of the moderate wing, resigned as party president
Monday.
	   He said the party's desertion of Prodi was ``wrong and
dangerous,'' but at the same time promised to follow the party
line.
	   ``We are in a very complicated political crisis which could lead
to early elections,'' Cossutta told reporters Monday. ``And with
the divisions in the left, this would mean a victory for the
right.''
	   If the crisis comes to a confidence vote and Prodi loses, he
would offer his resignation. Once he does that, it is up to
Scalfaro to decide what to do. He could ask Prodi or someone else
to form a new government or he could call elections 2 1/2 years
early, something most analysts think unlikely.
	   Working in Prodi's favor is the fact that few parties think they
would stand to gain by early elections, including the Communist
Refoundation. There was speculation Prodi would reopen negotiations
that would win back the communists' grudging support, as he has
managed to do in the past.
	   Prodi's government has held together this long in large part
because of the widely shared desire to see Italy qualify for
participation in the 1999 debut of Europe's common currency, the
euro. That happened earlier this year _ leaving the disparate
allies without so clear a reason to stay together.
	   Prodi leads Italy's 55th government since World War II. He has
outlasted all but Bettino Craxi, who served 3{ years in two
back-to-back stints from 1983 to 1987.
	   Refoundation is not part of Prodi's center-left coalition, but
the government needs its 34 votes to muster a majority in the lower
house. It has been a difficult ally from the outset.
	   It broke with Prodi over NATO expansion earlier this year and on
sending troops into Albania last year. Prodi was even forced to
resign a year ago after a bitter battle over spending cuts linked
to the euro. The crisis was resolved, and Prodi returned to work,
after he made steep concessions and promised a 35-hour work week.

Hague wins party ballot on single-currency stance
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES to add detailed results of ballot; UPPICKS pvs graf 6 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BOURNEMOUTH, England (AP) _ Conservative Party leader William
Hague won overwhelming backing from party members for his
opposition to a European single currency, and said Monday he hoped
the party could move away from the damaging splits of the past.
	   ``The party has spoken,'' Hague said after winning 84.4 percent
of the vote in favor of his policy of not joining the single
currency in this Parliament or the next. Effectively, that could
rule out joining before 2007.
	   ``By any standards, this is a result which demonstrates there is
a settled will in the Conservative Party to fight the next election
in favour of keeping the pound and that we will certainly do,''
Hague said.
	   The Conservatives, whose 18-year run in government ended in a
crushing national election defeat last year, open their annual
conference Tuesday in Bournemouth.
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair's government is keeping its options
open on the single currency, which 11 of the 15 European Union
members are launching next year.
	   A decision on Britain's membership will almost certainly fall to
the governing Labor Party, and the Conservative vote was as much
about intra-party feuding as it is about national policy.
	   More than 202,000 party members voted on the issue, or 59
percent of those who received ballots.

President hints at renewed efforts to solve border conflict
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ President Negasso Ghidada Monday
suggested that new international efforts would soon be underway to
resolve the border conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea that
erupted into fighting four months ago.
	   ``Countries that were involved with the facilitation process in
the beginning ... are coming up with fresh and renewed peace
endeavors,'' Negassao told the opening session of the 1998-99
parliament.
	   Although he did not name any countries, he appeared to be
referring to the United States and Rwanda, whose joint mission to
both countries in June failed to come up with a solution.
	   Former U.S. national security adviser Anthony Lake is scheduled
to arrive in Asmara, the Eritrean capital, Tuesday, and will leave
for Ethiopia Thursday. He may return to Asmara Friday.
	   Ethiopia has expressed willingness to hold talks with Eritrea
but only after Asmara withdraws its troops from territories
occupied after May 12, when the fighting broke out.
	   Eritrea has refused, saying it is on its own territory as
deliniated in Italian colonial maps in the first part of the
century.
	   Leaders of Burkina Faso, Zimbabwe and Djibouti, named by the
Organization of African Unity to come up with peace proposals, are
to meet Oct. 15 in Ouagadougou, the Burkina capital, to discuss
what they have come up with.
	   Negasso said Ethiopia was still committed to a peaceful
resolution of the conflict but was rapidly losing patience.
	   ``The governmentof Ethiopia still views war as a last resort to
settle inter-state disputes and is committed to exhaust all
possible avenues of peace, whereas the Eritrean regime has
demonstrated time and again its intransigence,'' he said.

Two test positive in Commonwealth Games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Two athletes _ cyclist Stephen Alfred of Trinidad
and Tobago and shooting competitor Rustam Khan of Pakistan _ tested
positive for banned substances in last month's Commonwealth Games
in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, officials said Monday.
	   Alfred, who placed eighth in the men's cycling sprint event,
tested positive for the banned substance norandrosterone. As a
consequence, Commonwealth Games officials based in London
disqualified him from the Kuala Lumpur games and also banned him
from the 2002 games in Manchester, England.
	   Khan, who tested positive for propanolol, also had his results
nullified. His case was referred to the Commonwealth Games
Association of Pakistan and the International Shooting Federation
to impose sanctions.

Social Dems' Persson pressed to indicate how he plans to govern
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS figures for non-socialist parties in 4th graf to 159
sted 169, CORECT spelling of prime minister's first name to Goeran
to conform with transliteration style. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ The main opposition group wants Prime
Minister Goeran Persson to explain how the ruling Social Democrats
plan to govern the next four years after last month's desultory
election results.
	   ``It's morally wrong that the losers of the elections rule on,''
Anders Bjoerk of the conservative Moderate Party said Monday.
	   On Sept. 20, the Social Democrats won 36.6 percent of the vote _
more than any other party, but nevertheless their worst showing in
decades and far below the 45 percent they tallied in 1994.
	   The Moderates polled 22.5 percent, and the four non-socialist
parties received a total of 159 seats in the 349-seat Riksdag
parliament. That's more than the Social Democrats' 131 seats, but
short of a majority.
	   The issue is how _ or whether _ the Social Democrats would
cooperate poltically with the ex-Communist Left Party and the
Greens.
	   When parliament resumes Tuesday, Persson was scheduled to
outline the Social Democrats' projected policies during the next
four years.
	   The Moderates were considering raising a formal challenge to
test how strong parliamentary support is for the government.
	   A challenge requires the support of just 35 members in the
Riksdag, but a majority would be needed to topple the government.
That has never happened in Swedish politics.

Amsterdam stocks hit 16-month low
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Buffeted by troubles at home and
abroad, prices on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange closed sharply lower
Monday, pushing the benchmark index to the lowest close since early
June 1997.
	   The 27-share AEX Index finished Monday at 829.31 points, down
19.28 points, or 2.3 percent, but off its intraday low of 825.98
points.
	   A profit warning late Friday by ABN Amro, the largest Dutch
bank, pushed down its shares by 3.1 percent. Internationally, the
lack of concrete measures coming out of the Group of Seven's
weekend meeting to fight the global financial crisis and ongoing
troubles in Asia was responsible for the overall gloomy sentiment
in Amsterdam.
	   The lower opening on Wall Street Monday weighed on stocks even
further.

Georgia turns to NATO to develop its sciences
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Georgia seeks closer ties with NATO to
promote the country's integration in Europe and to support Georgian
sciences that used to serve the Soviet military, President Eduard
Shevardnadze said Monday.
	   NATO Secretary General-Javier Solana met with Shevardnadze last
week, when he visited Georgia as part of his tour of Caucasus
countries.
	   ``We use cooperation with NATO not so much for developing our
military potential _ that is impossible for us _ but for speeding
up the integration into European structures,'' Shevardnadze said in
a radio interview Monday. ``We consider this a political guarantee
of stability and sovereignty.''
	   ``We are working more actively with NATO also to save and
develop our fundamental sciences that used to serve the military
industry in the Soviet times,'' Shevardnadze said.
	   Georgia joined NATO's Partnership for Peace program in 1994, but
has not sought membership in the alliance. Georgian officials have
said the republic was not ready for such a step, and they do not
want to antagonize Russia, which adamantly objects to NATO
membership by former Soviet republics.

Iranian parliament says Rushdie death edict still in force
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW to some lines &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ More than half the members of Iran's
hard-line parliament have signed a letter saying the death edict
against British author Salman Rushdie stands.
	   The letter, broadcast Sunday on Iranian television, was prompted
by Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi's announcement last month
distancing the government from the fatwa and the dlrs 2.5 million
bounty placed on Rushdie's head in 1989 by a semi-official Iranian
foundation.
	   ``As Majlis deputies, we assure Muslims all over the world that,
in this case, nothing except the decrees issued by God and
(Khomeini) in Iran have any credibility and no one has the power to
follow any other path,'' said the letter, according to the
television report.
	   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the late Iranian leader, said that
Rushdie must die for blaspheming Islam in his novel ``The Satanic
Verses.''
	   The Rushdie affair strained ties with the European Union.
Moderate President Mohammad Khatami, who defeated Nateq-Nouri in
elections in 1997, has been trying to improve ties with the West
since he took office.
	   Britain announced the resumption of ties after Kharrazi's
announcement
	   Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri, the parliament speaker left Sunday for
talks in Italy and Spain, to discuss political issues and to expand
trade relations between Tehran and the two countries.
	   Nateq-Nouri, also known as a hard-liner, has not publicly
commented on the government's distancing itself from the fatwa.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ International leaders are ratcheting
up the pressure on Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, warning
that NATO airstrikes are inevitable unless he takes decisive action
to end the crisis in Kosovo province.
	   Fearing airstrikes, Yugoslav generals put the nation's air
defense on high alert, but tried a belated compromise by moving
some tanks and other heavy equipment out of Kosovo. A Western
diplomat said up to 120 Yugoslav army armored vehicles, including
tanks, have been pulled out.
	   In New York, U.N. chief Kofi Annan told the U.N. Security
Council that ``systematic terror'' had been inflicted on Kosovo
civilians recently and Yugoslav forces were mostly responsible.
	   But Annan said he did not have the means to verify Milosevic's
compliance with U.N. resolutions demanding a cease-fire. He
suggested the panel's 15 members make their own judgment.
	   NATO's secretary-general Javier Solana, however, said Monday
that Yugoslavia had not complied with U.N. resolutions on Kosovo
and stressed that NATO was ready to launch a military attack.
	   ``The reality coming to us is that the compliance is not yet in
place,'' Solana told reporters.

	   GENEVA (AP) _ As hundreds of Kosovo Albanians protested outside
U.N. offices in Switzerland for military intervention, rebels
fighting for independence for the Serbian province on Monday denied
committing atrocities against Serbs.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said on Monday that although
the United Nations believes Serb forces are responsible for the
great majority of atrocities so far in Kosovo, there is reason to
believe ethnic Albanian forces have also committed them. He didn't
give examples.
	   On Wednesday, the chief of the U.N. refugee agency, Sadako
Ogata, said she believes the KLA is also guilty of using
``excessive force.''
	   U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Julia Taft, speaking in Geneva
on Monday, blamed Milosevic for the Kosovo refugee crisis but added
that he had ``had some help'' from the KLA.
	   ``We have never committed acts which violate human rights,''
insisted Bardhyl Mahmuti, political representative of the Kosovo
Liberation Army.
	   Mahmuti called the claims ``absolutely inaccurate'' and demanded
proof to back them up.
	   The United States warned Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
on Friday that NATO will strike Serb targets within two weeks
unless he complies with every U.N. demand to halt his assault on
ethnic Albanians, to allow relief to reach refugees and to
negotiate peace.
	   Taft, who visited Kosovo in August, said if Belgrade doesn't
comply, any NATO action would be an ``investment that would have to
be made'' to ensure the humanitarian crisis doesn't continue into
winter and beyond.
	   She said any action would be short term and wouldn't target
people. ``We have been working with the (aid agencies) and the U.N.
agencies to ensure they will have every warning so they can
withdraw from Kosovo in time,'' Taft added.
	   Hundreds of people brandishing banners reading ``Peace and
Liberty for Kosovo'' and ``Military Intervention for Kosovo''
protested Monday outside the U.N. European headquarters in Geneva,
demanding NATO military strikes against Serb forces.
	   Forces from Serbia, the larger of two republics comprising
Yugoslavia, have been trying since February to crush the ethnic
Albanian KLA. Hundreds of people have died in the fighting in the
largely ethnic Albanian province and 275,000 have been routed from
their homes.
	   ``We are here to protest against the indifference of the
international community to what is happening in Kosovo,'' Avdija
Ramadan, one of the demonstration's organizers, said.
	   Jashar Salihu, another KLA spokesman, urged immediate military
action against Serb security forces and reiterated the KLA's
determination to continue fighting for independence for the
province.
	   ``The only language the Serb regime understands is the language
of force,'' Salihu added.
	   Meanwhile, the Swiss government said 68 percent of asylum
applications made in September in the country came from Yugoslavia.
Some 4,581 applications were made, almost double last year's
figure.

Policeman fined for injuring nuclear protester with tear gas
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DANNENBERG, Germany (AP) _ A policeman was found guilty and
given a large fine Monday for injuring a protester during a
demonstration at the Gorleben nuclear waste storage site in
northern Germany last year.
	   The state administrative court in Dannenberg, 75 kilometers (40
miles) southeast of Hamburg, fined the officer 16,800 marks (dlrs
30,300) for what it ruled was an unprovoked tear gas attack on the
protester, who told the court he had only wanted to talk to the
policeman.
	   While the policeman claimed he had felt threatened when he was
approached by the protester, a video clip of the March 2, 1997
incident gave no indication the officer was in danger, the court
said.
	   Court spokesman Peter Reif said the policeman had accepted the
decision and did not plan to appeal.

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana
said Monday that Yugoslavia had not yet complied with United
Nations resolutions on Kosovo and stressed that NATO was ready to
launch a military attack.
	   Supreme Allied Commander Europe Wesley K. Clark said that, once
given the green light, NATO's military operation would likely be
fast and furious.
	   ``NATO action, should a political decison be taken, could come
in a matter of hours and days,'' Clark told reporters.
	   Solana went beyond the assessment of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan, who said in a report in New York that he lacked the means to
verify whether Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic had complied
with U.N. demands aimed at halting the conflict.
	   ``I'm sure that Mr. Annan has put in his document what he thinks
is the reality. The reality according to us is that the compliance
has not taken place,'' said Solana.
	   Solana had already met earlier Monday with U.S. special envoy
Richard Holbrooke, who said the military situation in Kosovo
remains critical despite a lull in fighting and the removal of some
Yugoslav tanks and troops from the battlefield.
	   After a meeting with Solana and Clark, Holbrooke said that
``while the level of fighting (in Kosovo) may have abated
temporarily, the capacity for its resumption is there.''

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ With the threat of NATO attack
mounting, Yugoslavia's prime minister warned Monday the nation
faces the ``imminent danger of war'' and claimed the government is
taking steps to comply with international demands for peace in
Kosovo.
	   But NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana told reporters that the
Alliance believed Yugoslavia had not yet met the conditions
demanded by the U.N. Security Council.
	   ``The reality coming to us is that the compliance is not yet in
place,'' Solana said. ``As far as we are concerned, once again, I
can tell you we are ready.''
	   In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said ``systematic
terror'' had been inflicted on Kosovo civilians within recent days
and that Yugoslav forces were mostly responsible.
	   But Annan said he did not ``have the means necessary to provide
an independent assessment of compliance as required by the Security
Council'' and suggested the 15 members may want to make their ``own
judgement in this respect.''
	   Following a meeting with Solana in Brussels, Belgium, U.S.
special envoy Richard Holbrooke said the situation in the southern
Serbian province was as bad now as two weeks ago. Holbrooke said he
would tell Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic of ``the extreme
gravity of the situation.''
	   Sources speaking on condition of anonymity said Holbrooke
arrived in Belgrade late Monday afternoon and was expected to meet
Milosevic in the evening.

Spanish kidnappers of missing businessman go on trial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS throughout and ADDS background on GRAPO; CORRECTS last
action of Grapo was in June sted January. STANDS as first story to
some points. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The confessed abductors of a Spanish
businessman went on trial Monday, claiming they released the victim
two months after kidnapping him in 1995.
	   Three members of a small armed leftist group called the GRAPO
have admitted abducting businessman Publio Cordon in June 1995 and
demanding 500 million pesetas (dlrs three million) in ransom from
his family. The group has repeatedly insisted that Cordon was freed
after the negotiated ransom was received in August, but the
businessman never reappeared.
	   On the eve of the National Court trial in Madrid, the pro-Basque
newspaper Euskadi Informacion published an alleged GRAPO communique
saying that Cordon was alive, well and living in the Dominican
Republic.
	   The defense intends to argue that the businessman decided to go
underground because of serious financial problems in his companies,
national Spanish radio reported.
	   Family members have claimed that he remains a captive, possibly
held by a fourth GRAPO member involved in the kidnapping.
	   The fugitive, Fernando Silva is being tried in his absence
alongside his three colleagues Enrique Cuadra, Concepcion Gonzalez
and Jose Ortin.
	   GRAPO, a Spanish acronym for October First Antifascist
Resistance Group, is blamed for killing 60 people in infrequent
bombing and shooting attacks since it first appeared in the early
1970s. Its political aims have never been very clear and police are
unsure what the group sought to achieve with the kidnapping.
	   The prosecution is seeking 28 year sentences for the accused.
Defense attorneys are expected to argue for lesser terms of up to
10 years.
	   The last action attributed to the group was a small package bomb
which slightly injured two police officers and caused minor damage
to a private insurance company in June.

NATO air attacks unlikely to give Albanians a military boost
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ NATO air attacks on President
Slobodan Milosevic's Yugoslav forces might give ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo a psychological lift but are unlikely to help rebel fighters
on the ground.
	   Some critics, the Serbs among them, say attacking Milosevic
would turn NATO into the Kosovo Liberation Army's air force, doing
what the rag-tag bands of mountain fighters have been unable to
accomplish on their own since the conflict began in February.
	   Veljko Odalovic, head of the local government in the Pristina
region, says NATO strikes would be direct support to separatist
rebels the Serbs call ``terrorists.''
	   ``I expect an escalation of the conflict and an increase in
terrorist activity,'' he said.
	   But military experts and political observers say this isn't so.
	   The primary aim of any allied missile and bomb attacks would be
coercive, an attempt to force the tough Yugoslav leader to cease
his relentless crackdown on the Albanian population of this
southern Serbian province where hundreds have died and 275,000 have
been displaced _ most of them civilians.
	   While the allies want to see Milosevic back down, they do not
want to support ethnic Albanian aspirations for independence, which
would be yet another sliver in the slicing of the former
Yugoslavia.
	   If the attacks forced Milosevic to withdraw substantial numbers
of police and troops from Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians make up
the vast majority of the population, it would ease the pressure on
the KLA and perhaps even let them regain territory. But it would
not present them with any substantial military advantage, the
experts say.
	   ``I think NATO can carry out strikes and not militarily help the
KLA by hitting targets like air defense and command and control
centers,'' said Paul Beaver, a Balkans expert for Jane's Defense
Group in London.
	   ``If they started to attack heavy artillery on the ground, or
vehicles on the ground, however, that might help the KLA.''
	   That is not part of the NATO plan _ at least not initially.
	   The most likely scenario is phased air attacks, starting with
targets like air defense and radar in order to protect the NATO
forces themselves, followed by a period of reflection and
negotiations, then more strikes.
	   The KLA released a statement Monday in Pristina, the provincial
capital, supporting NATO strikes.
	   ``The international community's and NATO's latest threats of a
military intervention are the most serious yet and we wish they
would become reality,'' KLA spokesman Jakup Krasniqi said in a
statement published in the Albanian language newspaper Bujku.
	   Milos Vasic, a military analyst at Belgrade's weekly Vreme
magazine, said airstrikes certainly would boost KLA morale.
	   ``They are going to call it their own air support,'' he said.
``It will be a political tool to try to get more supporters.''
	   None of the allies want to be seen taking sides against one of
the warring factions. The reality is, however, Western nations are
repulsed by Serb conduct in Kosovo, particularly the heavy toll on
civilians.
	   At the same time, many also believe that the KLA is not the
heroic band of freedom fighters they often are made out to be, and
are responsible themselves for much of the fighting that has gone
on in the province.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said on Monday that although
the United Nations believes Serb forces are responsible for most
atrocities in Kosovo, there is reason to believe Serb claims that
ethnic Albanian forces have also committed them.
	   Veton Surroi, a member of the ethnic Albanian negotiating team
in Kosovo, says the strikes wouldn't give the KLA _ which has no
known command structure _ a real advantage against the Serbs.
	   ``Anything that hurts Milosevic helps everybody else,'' he
acknowledged, but ``the question is, help it do what? The KLA
doesn't have the force to create a substantially different
situation here.''

Nuclear agency, North Korea resume inspection talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Trying to end a four-year deadlock, the
U.N.'s nuclear watchdog agency resumed talks with North Korea
Monday on permission to verify how much plutonium the country has
in hand.
	   North Korea put a halt to inspections of its nuclear facilities
in 1994, said Hans-Friedrich Meyer, spokesman for the International
Atomic Energy Agency.
	   The North Koreans were upset after agency officials told the
U.N. Security Council that the country hadn't given an accurate
accounting of its nuclear facilities and fissionable material.
	   IAEA inspections that began in 1992, ``detected that there must
be more plutonium,'' than the country had declared, Meyer said.
	   North Korean officials refused to answer questions on how much
nuclear material was in the country and where it was stored, and
broke off cooperation with the IAEA.
	   Since that time, talks have been held twice a year to try to
resume cooperation. But the situation looks unlikely to improve any
time soon.
	   ``There is no indication of any surprise outcome,'' Meyer said.
``One can only hope.''

Jewish holiday passes quietly despite security fears
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israelis on Monday celebrated the Jewish
holiday of Sukkot with festive meals served up in hut-like
structures built on urban balconies and suburban backyards.
	   Despite fears of terror attacks, the day passed uneventfully,
with the Palestinian lands remaining sealed off. The West Bank
stayed quiet too, even the town of Hebron, where there had been
clashes on the previous five days.
	   Sukkot, or the Feast of the Tabernacles, is one of the more
joyous holidays on the Jewish calendar. Many Israelis, both
religious and secular, build a sukkah, or hut, of materials ranging
from wood and palm branches to prefab metal and plastic.
	   The huts are meant to commemorate ancient Israelites' wanderings
in the desert. Religious Jews sleep and pray in theirs; the more
secular mainly use the structures for hearty celebratory meals in
keeping with Sukkot's tradition as a harvest festival.
	   The holiday also has strong traditional associations with
nature, and Israelis headed in droves to the country's beaches and
national parks. Tour buses backed up by the dozens at the crossing
point into Egypt's Sinai peninsula, and hiking tours were fully
booked.
	   The festival lasts a week, but the main day of commemoration was
from sundown Sunday to sundown Monday, when shops, offices,
restaurants and schools were closed. Hours at many establishments
were to be curtailed all week.
	   As it has during other recent holidays, Israel sealed off the
Palestinian lands and imposed tight security. The closure, with
some brief easings, has been in effect since just before the start
of the Jewish New Year on Sept. 20.
	   Last month, the radical Islamic group Hamas threatened revenge
attacks and kidnappings of soliders during the holiday season. The
threat came after Israeli troops killed two top Hamas fugitives in
their West Bank hideout.

Bangladesh wins its first match of ACC cricket tournament
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) _ Favorites Bangladesh easily won its
opening match against Malaysia in the 10-nation Asian Cricket
Council (ACC) tournament in the Nepalese capital on Monday.
	   Batting first, Bangladesh scored 239 runs for nine wickets with
opener Omar Javed htting 79 runs. Its bowlers then struck,
dismissing Malaysia cheaply for 98 runs.
	   In the second match, Japan, which is better known for baseball
skills, was skittled out for just 19 runs by Hong Kong. It turned
out to be a farce with seven Japanese batsmen getting out without
scoring.
	   Takasi Kato was top scorer with four runs. Hong Kong reached the
victory target in just 2.3 overs.
	   In another match, the United Arab Emirates put up a big score of
364 runs losing only four wickets against Thailand. Captain Saeed
Al Saffar hit a double century and remained 209 not out.
	   Saffar and Nasir Siddiqi put up 206 runs for the opening wicket.
	   Thailand were bowled out for mere 72 runs in 31 overs.
	   In the fourth match of the day, Singapore defeated Papua New
Guinea by five wickets, scoring the required 158 runs in 43.1
overs.
	   Papua New Guinea scored 157 runs but Singapore batsmen had no
difficulty in reaching the target with Zubin Shroff scoring 51
runs.
	   All matches scheduled for Monday were played. Rain and soggy
ground conditions on the first two days forced cancellation of all
but one matches.
	   Malaysia defeated the Maldives on better run rate after rain
curtailed play.
	   The final of the 10-nation trophy is scheduled for Oct. 13.

Talks on governing Lesotho turn to interim rule
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Leads with 9 grafs to UPDATE with rival parties agreeing to
consider proposals for transitional body that would prepare for new
elections &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ Lesotho's governing and opposition
parties agreed Monday to consider forming a transitional body that
would pave the way for new elections, but remained at loggerheads
over who will govern until then.
	   Monday's talks, brokered by representatives of the Southern
African Development Community, followed last month's military
intervention by South Africa troops to quell unrest and restore the
government's authority.
	   The intervention, under the auspices of the SADC, led to massive
destruction of the capital and the deaths of scores of people in
the mountain kingdom of 2 million people.
	   The Lesotho Democratic Congress party, which swept last May's
elections, says it will not form a government of national unity
until the next balloting, South African Press Association reported.
	   Opposition parties, which accuse the government of stealing the
last election, are demanding a role in the interim administration.
	   The rival parties agreed Monday to consider SADC proposals for
the formation of a transitional structure while preparations for
new elections are made, SAPA reported.
	   It would create and promote conditions for free and fair
elections, ensure equitable treatment of all political parties by
state-owned media and would decide all electoral matters, including
the role of the police, military and intelligence services in the
election process.
	   The body, which would consist of one or two members from each
political party, would also appoint a new Independent Electoral
Commission to review Lesotho's electoral system with a view to
making it more efficient and fair.
	   The parties on Friday tentatively agreed to hold new elections
in 15 to 18 months.
	   Hundreds of South African soldiers are still based in Lesotho.
Responding to news reports that some have engaged in looting, rape
and mistreatment of civilians, the military command in Pretoria
acknowledged that ``the actions of individuals are jeopardizing the
reputation of the entire force.''
	   However, it said the military was ``generally satisfied'' with
discipline and that morale was ``very good.''
	   It gave no details on any incidents.

 &UR; Holbrooke warns Milosevic of NATO strikes
 &UR; Eds: AMs; UPDATES with Holbrooke arriving; Yugoslav defense
minister says no state of emergency; no fighting in Kosovo. RECASTS
and TRIMS. CHANGES byline; no pickup &QL;

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) - With NATO attacks said to be only
days away, a top U.S. envoy arrived Monday for an 11th-hour warning
to Slobodan Milosevic to comply with international demands to halt
his crackdown in Kosovo or face airstrikes.
	   Richard Holbrooke said before he met the Yugoslav president in
Belgrade that the situation in the southern Serbian province was as
bad now as two weeks ago when NATO started finalizing airstrike
plans to force Milosevic to halt his violent crackdown against
Kosovo Albanian separatists.
	   Holbrooke said in Brussels, Belgium, that he planned to drive
home to Milosevic ``the extreme gravity of the situation.''
Holbrooke negotiated the Bosnia peace deal with Milosevic in 1995.
	   In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said ``systematic
terror'' had been inflicted on Kosovo civilians within recent days
and that Yugoslav forces were mostly responsible.
	   But Annan said he did not ``have the means necessary to provide
an independent assessment of compliance as required by the Security
Council'' and suggested the 15 members may want to make their ``own
judgment in this respect.''
	   NATO members had been waiting for Annan's report to determine
whether they would take military action against Milosevic's forces.
	   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said in Brussels, however,
that the Alliance believed Yugoslavia had not yet met the
conditions demanded by the U.N. Security Council.
	   ``The reality coming to us is that the compliance is not yet in
place,'' Solana said. ``As far as we are concerned, once again, I
can tell you we are ready.''
	   Meanwhile, Yugoslavia's prime minister told an emergency session
of parliament Monday that the country ``is faced with the imminent
danger of war.'' Yugoslavia is comprised of dominant Serbia and
smaller Montenegro.
	   ``The threats are serious,'' Prime Minister Momir Bulatovic
said. ``And I call on this parliament to conclude that Yugoslavia
is faced with the imminent danger of war. Yugoslavia has to defend
itself if it was attacked.''
	   One option could be for parliament to declare a state of
emergency _ a step which could lead to a general mobilization of
all military-aged men. But Yugoslav Defense Minister Pavle
Bulatovic told reporters that no such declaration would be made
Monday.
	   In an attempt to head off NATO action, Bulatovic said the
government had accepted a Russian proposal for the 54-nation
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to investigate
the crisis.
	   Yugoslavia had repeatedly rejected such a mission to Kosovo
until Yugoslav membership in the organization is restored.
	   The prime minister also said there was no longer any fighting in
Kosovo, where Albanian represent 90 percent of the 2-million
population. He said five of the 10 special police units had been
removed from Kosovo and the others had been returned to barracks in
the province.
	   In Brussels, however, Holbrooke made clear that half-measures
would not be enough to satisfy Washington and prevent a NATO
attack.
	   ``While the level of fighting may have abated temporarily, the
capacity for its resumption is there,'' Holbrooke said after a
meeting with NATO Secretary General Javier Solana and Supreme
Allied Commander Europe Wesley K. Clark. German Gen. Dieter
Stoeckmann told German Radio that air attacks could be only days
away.
	   The guns were largely silent in Kosovo Monday.
	   Diplomats in Kosovo said they have observed an informal
cease-fire since last Thursday and were not aware of any aggressive
operations by government forces against ethnic Albanians or the
rebel Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   One diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there
has been a significant redeployment of Yugoslav army troops out of
Kosovo to other parts of Serbia, including a mechanized brigade
that pulled out on Sunday.
	   Some army units remain in the field, and there is enormous fear
among the people that the violence will resume, particularly among
tens of thousands of refugees -- many of whom are living in the
hills and forests without shelter.
	   Meanwhile, the head of Yugoslavia's other republic, Montenegro,
called on Milosevic to accept all international demands and avert a
NATO attack.
	   ``We have to avert a clash with the whole world, the
confrontation which we are bound to lose,'' Montenegro's
pro-Western president, Milo Djukanovic, said in a statement.
	   Belgrade had been counting on Russia to block any
U.N.-sanctioned military moves by the Western Alliance. On Sunday,
Milosevic met with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and Defense
Minister Igor Sergeyev, Serbian President Milan Milutinovic and
Yugoslavia's top defense officials.

EU looks at tightening sanctions as military planners continue

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with divisions in Western Europe over air strikes
without UN mandate &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ As the NATO headquarters reiterated its
readiness for a military campaign, the European Union nations were
divided Monday on whether to launch air strikes without United
Nations Security Council backing.
	   At a meeting, the EU foreign ministers debated tighter economic
sanctions against Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to end the
violence in Kosovo. It was unlikely, however, that tighter travel
restrictions and freezing more Yugoslav assets abroad would be
anything more than symbolic.
	   Appeals from the EU, the United States and others for a peaceful
solution to the Kosovo crisis have been repeatedly been ignored in
Belgrade to the point that the United States is pressing its allies
for air strikes.
	   The Europeans are wavering, however, wondering about the wisdom
of NATO attacking a sovereign nation without a specific nod from
the United Nations.
	   In Brussels, NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana stressed the
alliance was ready to launch a military attack.
	   ``The reality coming to us is that the compliance is not yet in
place,'' Solana said in reaction to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan's statement that he lacked the means to verify if Milosevic
had complied with U.N. demands.
	   French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said his government would
first have to ``evaluate all the elements of the situation.'' He
suggested that could take two days.
	   France is keen that NATO gets a formal U.N. endorsement for air
strikes which raises the possibility of a Russian veto in the U.N.
Security Council.
	   Britain is Washington's staunchest ally in pursuing air strikes
without U.N. blessing and Foreign Secretary Robin Cook was at pains
to get European support for that here.
	   ``Milosevic must change his conduct. We are determined to send
him a very clear message and we are working determinedly with the
international community to make sure that we are all united in
sending him a very clear message,'' Cook said on arrival here.
	   But Manfred Hoyer, Germany's Deputy Foreign Minister, cautioned,
``It is far too early to talk about military action. This is going
too far.''
	   Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos said for NATO to
attack a sovereign nation ``requires a very strong legal basis.''
Unless the U.N. provides that, he said, there was a danger of
``generalized war'' in the Balkans.
	   Lamberto Dini, the Italian foreign minister, told reporters,
``We must negotiate. It is too early to talk about military
intervention.'' The Dutch and the Belgians also said they want a
U.N. mandate.
	   The foreign ministers debated tighter travel restrictions on
Yugoslav officials and extending a freeze on Serbian assets abroad
to cover state-owned companies, such as the national airline JAT.
	   The EU has sought to punish Yugoslavia for its crackdown against
ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo through an investment ban, an
assets freeze, visa restrictions, a ban on arms exports and flights
by Yugoslav air carriers to EU points.
	   These sanctions have not moved Milosevic any closer to a
peaceful solution of the Kosovo crisis leading the United States
and Britain to push for a phased military campaign, starting with
air strikes.
	   Serbia is the larger of two republics comprising Yugoslavia, and
Milosevic launched a crackdown in February against
independence-seeking rebels in Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians
constitute 90 percent of the population. Hundreds have died in the
fighting and 275,000 have been routed from their homes.
	   In a Sept. 23 resolution, the U.N. Security Council renewed
demands for a ceasefire and negotiations and threatened unspecified
measures if both sides failed to abide. Since then, photos and
reports of a massacre of ethnic Albanians have been published
around the world, heightening calls for military intervention.

Schroeder backs German auto industry against environmentalists
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Germany-Politics &QL; 
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germans have voted for change, but a speed
limit on the autobahn?
	   Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder rallied behind the nation's
powerful automakers and much of the public Monday, warning his
future coalition partner, the environmentalist Greens, not to spoil
Germany's love affair with fast driving.
	   Schroeder's comments to the nation's most-read newspaper, Bild,
came as both sides haggled over policies for a government to
replace Chancellor Helmut Kohl's outgoing administration.
	   With no general speed limit, Germany's autobahn is unique among
European highways and a symbol of freedom in a rule-bound country.
Building cars to handle autobahn conditions is also a selling point
for companies from Volkswagen to Mercedes.
	   Those arguments carry weight with Schroeder, a Social Democrat
with a business-friendly reputation _ he sits on VW's supervisory
board.
	   And the Social Democrats are in no mood to start off their
return to government after 16 years with a shock to the nation.
	   But Schroeder needs a coalition partner to have a majority in
parliament. Talks with the Greens began last week, and already look
like they might get bumpy.
	   Schroeder bristled at suggestions by Greens lawmaker Gila
Altmann that the new government might slap a speed limit of 120-130
kph (75-80 mph) on the autobahn.
	   ``I can only warn people against attacking the auto industry,''
Schroeder was quoted Monday as telling Bild. ``Industry growth
isn't what it has been, and we are not going to endanger jobs. We
have entirely different worries.''
	   Speed limit backers, including the Greens, have long pointed to
studies showing pedal-to-the-metal driving leads to more highway
deaths and pollution.
	   A recent autobahn trial with a speed limit of 130 kph (80 mph)
showed that accidents declined by 11 percent, the Federal Highway
Office said. Deaths and serious injuries fell even more, by 23
percent.
	   But a government survey this year found only about half of
Germans support slowing down the autobahn. Motorist groups argue
the German network is still safer than superhighways in other
countries that have a speed limit, such as France and Italy.
	   ``I believe you can drive at very high speeds and still be safe
in German cars,'' said Gerhard Glogowski, Schroeder's successor as
Lower Saxony state governor.
	   Schroeder has already ruled out a sharp hike in gasoline taxes.
He favors an increase of 6 pfennigs (3.5 cents), not 30 pfennigs
(18 cents) or more favored by some Greens.
	   National and local Social Democratic leaders who met Monday in
Bonn backed Schroeder's stand.
	   One Social Democratic governor, Kurt Beck, suggested that one
compromise with the Greens would be to widen the 30 kph (20 mph)
limit already in force in many urban areas.
	   Talks with the Greens ``aren't going to fall apart over speed
limits,'' Beck said.
	   The parties still have to address key areas like foreign policy,
energy and the environment _ each with its own potential sticking
points.
	   Yet Schroeder, who won Sept. 27 elections, says he's optimistic
the coalition negotiations will be wrapped up so that he can be
sworn in as chancellor on Oct. 27.

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ A meeting of Germany's victorious Social
Democrats on Monday backed chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder in
his drive to focus on fighting unemployment when he takes office
later this month.
	   The support by the party's national and local leaders came as
Schroeder negotiates a coalition deal with the environmentalist
Greens party.
	   Declaring jobs at stake, Schroeder rallied behind Germany's car
industry in an interview published Monday _ a contrast to Greens
demands for a sharp hike in gasoline taxes and a general speed
limit on Germany's autobahns.
	   Schroeder avoided reporters after addressing the party meeting
in Bonn. But participants said there was unanimous support for his
policies.
	   ``The emphasis was on the need to fight unemployment,'' said
party general secretary Franz Muentefering. ``We have to live up to
voters' expectations.''
	   Greens and Social Democrats opened coalition talks Friday, but
bargaining over key sticking points such as foreign policy, energy
and the environment lie ahead over the next two weeks. Schroeder is
to be sworn in as chancellor on Oct. 27.
	   Monday's meeting did not make any decisions about the Social
Democrats' bargaining positions.
	   But several leading Social Democrats said after the session they
did not expect the speed limit tiff to blow up the coalition talks.
	   On another contentious issue, a Schroeder aide on energy issues
took up the Greens' call for a law setting a timetable for
scrapping nuclear power. However, Wolfgang Juettner left open what
the timetable should be.
	   Though the Greens want quicker steps to turn off nuclear plants
than the Social Democrats, a Greens negotiator also played down
differences between the two sides Monday.
	   Renate Kuenast, a party leader in Berlin, suggested the Greens
may have to compromise on their platform's call for immediate steps
toward scrapping nuclear energy.
	   A ``sledgehammer approach'' would result in long legal battles
with the power industry, she said on ZDF television.
	   ``We understand that we are the government now, not the
opposition,'' she said. ``We don't want to ride attacks against
anyone.''

Powerful army chief seeks National Security Council
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KATHY GANNON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) - Pakistan's powerful army chief called
Monday for the establishment of a National Security Council to
steer his beleaguered nation out of its economic and political
morass.
	   In a strongly worded statement, Gen. Jehangir Karamat, warned
that Pakistan could not afford ``the destabilizing effects of
polarization, vendettas and insecurity-driven expedient policies.''
	   A National Security Council would give the powerful military
direct involvement in policy making in Pakistan.
	   Karamat's call for a National Security Council comes as Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif's beleaguered government faces increasing
pressure both from within and outside his ruling Pakistan Muslim
League.
	   Disgruntled party members and opposition politicians have
attacked Sharif for a proposed constitutional amendment that would
bring a new Islamic order to Pakistan, some fear in the tradition
of neighboring Afghanistan's Taliban rulers.
	   As well Sharif's government is in the midst of negotiations with
international lending institutions to try to stave off an economic
collapse.
	   Added to his troubles has been a corruption scandal that alleges
Sharif, his family members and friends have been involved in
kickbacks and money laundering.
	   Already several of Sharif's coalition partners in Pakistan's
smaller provinces either have abandoned his ruling party or
threatened to leave.
	   The only province where Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League has a
comfortable majority is in the largest and most populous Punjab
province.
	   Karamat's warning and subsequent call for a National Security
Council is the strongest indication to date that the military is
losing patience.
	   In Pakistan where the army has ruled for 25 of the country's
51-year history the army chief is a powerful man. When he speaks
politicians generally listen.
	   In his statement Karamat warned that Pakistan, which has had
four elections in 10 years will have a ``permanent election
campaign environment,'' unless its politicians strengthen the
democratic institutions.
	   Pakistan ended 11 years of military rule in 1988 with the
mysterious plane crash that killed army chief and president Gen.
Mohammed Zia-ul Haq. The crash paved the way for the election of
former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, whose term was cut short on
charges of corruption.
	   Ms. Bhutto was twice dismissed from power, while Sharif was
dismissed once and resigned another time.
	   Karamat warned that Pakistan is passing through a difficult
time.
	   ``The need of the hour was total focus on the economy, the
external linkages with China, Iran, Afghanistan, India, the United
States, the internal situation, especially Sindh, the sectarian
aspect and finally the fears of the smaller provinces,'' the army
chief said in a statement.
	   To address these concerns, Karamat said a National Security
Council should be formed.
	   Also Karamat called for a ``neutral, competent and secure
bureaucracy and administration at the federal and provincial
levels.''
	   Karamat said a National Security Council that would
``institutionalize decision making''.

Iranian student group calls for freedom of the press
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: EDITS previous. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A student committee on Monday called for
freedom of speech in Iran and criticized the arrest of several
writers and journalists.
	   The Committee of Students Defending Political Prisoners accused
a Tehran court of using ``illegal and undemocratic methods'' when
it questioned five writers last week for trying revive a writers'
association.
	   It warned in a statement that these measures ``would lead only
to a security crisis.'' It did not elaborate.
	   During the past few days, five prominent authors were summoned
to a state security court and warned against reviving the
association, which was abolished shortly after the 1979 Islamic
Revolution.
	   One of the writers told the British Broadcasting Corporation
that they were told their association was an illegal underground
political organization and they could be put on trial for
anti-state activities.
	   The five writers are Mansour Kooshan, Houshang Golshiri, Kazem
Kardavani, Mohammad Pooyandeh and Ali Darvishian.
	   Iran's press has been facing its most difficult period since it
gained more freedom with last year's election of moderate President
Mohammad Khatami. Four newspapers were closed last month and six
journalists arrested.
	   Journalists have said that the new press freedoms have angered
powerful hard-liners in the regime, who have found themselves under
increasing attack.
	   They also claim that the hard-liners have been using the recent
tensions between Iran and Afghanistan as an excuse to crack down on
civil liberties.
	   Meanwhile, Deputy President Abdollah Nouri _ a moderate former
interior minister who was impeached in June by hard-line members of
parliament _ said he was ready to hire the staff of the closed Tous
daily at a newspaper he planned to start, the Iran Daily reported.
	   He plans to publish the daily Khordad in the near future, the
English-language paper said.
	   Tous, which had the second-highest circulation in Iran, was shut
down last month for publishing articles the judiciary deemed
detrimental to the country's national interests and security.
	   The paper angered hard-liners by calling for a diplomatic
solution rather than military strikes in the dispute with the
Taliban militia in Afghanistan.
	   It also angered hard-liners by questioning the authority of
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's spiritual leader.
	   The deputy director and an editor of Iran's official Islamic
Republic News Agency also were arrested briefly last month after a
hard-line official filed a complaint with a Tehran court.
	   Khamenei, a hard-liner, has called on the judiciary to deal with
what he calls ``the abuse of press freedom'' by the media.
	   Last week, the monthly Jameah-e Salem was banned for insulting
the late spiritual leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and its owner
was given a five-year suspended jail sentence.
	   The Rah-e Nou and Tavana weeklies were ordered banned for
angering hard-liners.

Malaysia will not extend amnesty for illegal immigrants
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ All foreign workers without permits
have been advised to leave Malaysia in October, before the end of a
two-month amnesty, a minister said Monday.

<TEXT>
	   The government will not extend the two-month amnesty to let an
estimated 200,000 illegal immigrants leave the country, which ends
on Oct 31, Deputy Home Minister Ong Ka Ting said, according to the
national news agency Bernama.
	   ``We have given a lot of chances and this is final,'' he said in
the eastern city of Kuala Trengganu. Ong said the amnesty protected
only those with valid travel documents who left through legal exit
points.
	   Ong said there were now over a million foreigners working in the
country and about 800,000 of them had work permits.
	   During Asia's boom years, Malaysia welcomed millions of foreign
workers in the construction and plantations industries. Now with
rising unemployment and a plunging economy, they are no longer
welcome.
	   Employers of more than five illegal immigrants can now receive a
mandatory jail sentence of at least six months since the
Immigration Act was amended last year, Ong said.
	   They could also be compounded between 10,000 ringgit (dlrs
2,500) and 50,000 ringgit (dlrs 12,500) for each illegal worker and
be blacklisted by the Immigration Department, he added.
	   At the height of Malaysia's economic prosperity and construction
boom, about 700 Indonesian workers ``illegally sneaked in daily.
Most illegal workers are Indonesians, while others are
Bangaldeshis, Filipinos, Thais and Nepalese.

Germany's roster for Turkey game will feature new faces after all
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROY KAMMERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ New coach Erich Ribbeck had planned to lean on
some familiar veterans to carry Germany's demoralized national team
through the Euro 2000 qualifying round.
	   But after a wave of recent injuries, the 22-man roster he named
Monday for the key match against Turkey resembles a rebuilding team
more than the aging World Cup troop after all.
	   The team includes five debutantees, while most have played only
a handful of caps for the national team. In fact there are only
five players nominated that have been regular starters.
	   Libero Lothar Matthaeus, at 37 the symbol of the team's age at
the World Cup, is injured. Now its likely that new faces like
Rostock defender Marko Rehmer, Dortmund's Lars Ricken or
Leverkusen's Stefan Beinlich will line up against Turkey Saturday
and Moldavia four days later.
	   ``I'm not afraid to bring a new person against Turkey,'' said
Ribbeck. ``It's now like we're scratching the bottom of the barrel.
We have players that will represent Germany worthily.''
	   Ribbeck, making his debut in Turkey, has taken over a three-time
World champion badly shaken by the dismal quarterfinal ousting in
France.
	   But Ribbeck, saying he had no grace period for losing, quickly
scratched predeccesor Berti Vogts' plans for a wholesale
housecleaning of declining heros who had carried the national team
for a decade.
	   The plans to rely on veterans, while integrating new faces
slowly, were scrambled last week by a rash of injuries.
	   Matthaeus, Mario Basler, Thomas Strunz und Olaf Marschall pulled
out with injuries, joining World Cup starters Dietmar Hamann and
Christian Ziege. Defender Christian Woerms is also suspended.
	   All had played prominent roles under former coach Berti Vogts,
who resigned under pressure after the poor World Cup showing.
	   Vogt's own attempts to rebuild the team backfired in a pair of
ill-fated friendlies featuring new players. His fate was sealed
after a slim 2-1 victory over lowly Malta and a 1-1 draw with
Romania.
	   Ribbeck has named five players with no national team experience:
Mustafa Dogan, reserve goalkeeper Stefan Klos of Borussia Dortmund,
defender Yves Eigenrauch of Schalke, midfielder Carsten Ramelow of
Bayer Leverkusen and striker Carsten Jancker of Bayern Munich.
	   Dogan, Turkish-born but with German citizenship, has played in
the Bundesliga but is now with Fenerbahce Istanbul. The second
foreign-born player is Rostock striker Oliver Neuville, a former
Swiss.
	   The rest of the squad is dotted with players that have appeared
in a handful of caps like Ricken, Berlin midfielder Dariusz Wosz,
Beinlich, Rehmer or Schalke defender Yves Eigenrauch.
	   Even at forward, Ribbeck isn't sure he can count on veteran Ulf
Kirsten to line up next to captain Oliver Bierhoff. The Leverkusen
player skipped Saturday's Bundesliga match because of bruises.
	   Ribbeck won't make a final decision on who will start against
Turkey until Saturday.
	   ``The backbone of the team is there, with about seven or eight
places taken, but you can see what could happen between now and the
match,'' he said.
	   The roster:
	   Goalkeepers: Oliver Kahn (Bayern Munich), Stefan Klos (Borussia
Dortmund), Jens Lehmann (AC Milan).
	   Defenders: Markus Babbel (Bayern Munich), Mustafa Dogan
(Fenerbahce Istanbul), Yves Eigenrauch (Schalke), Jens Nowotny
(Bayer Leverkusen), Marko Rehmer (Hansa Rostock)
	   Midfielders: Stefan Beinlich (Bayer Leverkusen), Marco Bode
(Werder Bremen), Joerg Heinrich (Fiorentina), Jens Jeremies (Bayern
Munich), Christian Nerlinger (Borussia Dortmund), Carsten Ramelow
(Bayer Leverkusen), Lars Ricken (Borussia Dortmund), Michael Tarnat
(Bayern Munich), Ralf Weber (Eintracht Frankfurt), Dariusz Wosz
(Hertha Berlin)
	   Forwards: Oliver Bierhoff (AC Milan), Carsten Jancker (Bayern
Munich), Ulf Kirsten (Bayer Leverkusen), Oliver Neuville (Hansa
Rostock).

Pope steps into Balkan disputes during visit to Croatia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VICTOR L. SIMPSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Pope John Paul II stepped into the Balkan
minefield during a three-day visit to Croatia, plunging into a
historical dispute and current politics.
	   The visit was planned for his beatification of World War II
Cardinal Alojzije Stepinac, a hero to Roman Catholics for his
resistance to communism but viewed by Serbs as a Nazi sympathizer.
Beatification is the last step before possible sainthood.
	   About 80 percent of Croatia's 4.7 million people are Roman
Catholics, making the country the major Catholic outpost in the
former Yugoslavia, amid Orthodox Christians and Muslims.
	   Hundreds of thousands attended John Paul's open-air Masses while
many others watched live television coverage.
	   John Paul urged Europe to support Croatia's bid to join Western
institutions, saying that ``on the path leading to the European
common home, no one should be forgotten.''
	   John Paul was virtually shadowed by President Franjo Tudjman,
whose authoritarian rule is often cited by Western governments in
rejecting Croatia's admission to such institutions. Tudjman has
also been criticized by Zagreb's archbishop.
	   Tudjman attended the pope's public events and received him at
the presidential palace _ a former residence of the late Yugoslav
strongman Josip Broz Tito _ for private talks Saturday.
	   In his parting words Sunday evening before returning to Rome,
the pope said Croatia must be willing to make sacrifices and
undergo a moral renewal.
	   ``Without values, there can be neither true liberty nor true
democracy,'' the pope said in a phrase that the Vatican's daily
newspaper used as its front-page headline Monday.
	   Stepinac has been a subject of dispute between Croats and Serbs
for decades.
	   As Zagreb's archbishop in 1941, he supported a German-backed,
fascist puppet government, but later denounced the regime's
genocidal policies.
	   He died at 62 in 1960 while under house arrest following his
conviction on charges of collaborating with the Nazis.
	   Speaking before a half-million people Saturday, the pope said
the cardinal earned the ``radiant badge of martyrdom'' for having
``endured in his own body and his own spirit the atrocities of the
communist system.''

Jewish holiday passes quietly despite security fears
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israelis on Monday celebrated the Jewish
holiday of Sukkot with festive meals served up in hut-like
structures built on urban balconies and suburban backyards.
	   Despite fears of terror attacks, the day passed uneventfully,
with the Palestinian lands remaining sealed off. The West Bank
stayed quiet too, even the town of Hebron, where there had been
clashes on the previous five days.
	   Sukkot, or the Feast of the Tabernacles, is one of the more
joyous holidays on the Jewish calendar. Many Israelis, both
religious and secular, build a sukkah, or hut, of materials ranging
from wood and palm branches to prefab metal and plastic.
	   The huts are meant to commemorate ancient Israelites' wanderings
in the desert. Religious Jews sleep and pray in theirs; the more
secular mainly use the structures for hearty celebratory meals in
keeping with Sukkot's tradition as a harvest festival.
	   The holiday also has strong traditional associations with
nature, and Israelis headed in droves to the country's beaches and
national parks. Tour buses backed up by the dozens at the crossing
point into Egypt's Sinai peninsula, and hiking tours were fully
booked.
	   The festival lasts a week, but the main day of commemoration was
from sundown Sunday to sundown Monday, when shops, offices,
restaurants and schools were closed. Hours at many establishments
were to be curtailed all week.
	   As it has during other recent holidays, Israel sealed off the
Palestinian lands and imposed tight security. The closure, with
some brief easing, has been in effect since just before the start
of the Jewish New Year on Sept. 20.
	   Last month, the Islamic militant group Hamas threatened revenge
attacks and kidnappings of soliders during the holiday season. The
threat came after Israeli troops killed two top Hamas fugitives in
their West Bank hideout.

Yeltsin presses Russia's view on Kosovo in round of phone calls
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia underlined its opposition to NATO
airstrikes against Kosovo in a flurry of phone calls Monday to U.S.
President Bill Clinton, the U.N. secretary-general and Germany's
chancellor-elect.
	   Russian President Boris Yeltsin told the German that Yugoslavia
accepted a Russian proposal to invite an international delegation
to investigate the crisis in its southern province, Yeltsin's press
service said.
	   Russia had proposed that a delegation from the 54-country
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe go to Kosovo to
investigate ways to end the crisis and avoid NATO airstrikes.
	   Yeltsin also spoke by telephone Monday to U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan and to Clinton, his press service said.
	   The conversation with Annan was ``long and substantive,'' the
ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Russia has for months strongly opposed the use of force against
the Serbs, their traditional allies and Orthodox Slav brethren, but
has agreed with NATO that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's
violent campaigns had to be stopped.
	   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev went to Yugoslavia on Sunday to warn Milosevic that
airstrikes are inevitable unless he acts to end the crisis.

Holbrooke warns Milosevic of NATO strikes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to drop attribution on Holbrooke presence in Belgrade;
meeting underway; RESTORES first name of prime minister to
distinguish him from another minister with same surname &QL; 
 &UR; By DUSAN STOJANOVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) - With NATO attacks said to be only
days away, a top U.S. envoy arrived Monday for an 11th-hour warning
to Slobodan Milosevic to comply with international demands to halt
his crackdown in Kosovo or face airstrikes.
	   Richard Holbrooke began his meeting with the Yugoslav president
Monday evening after arriving from Brussels, Belgium, where he
conferred with senior NATO officials.
	   In Brussels, Holbrooke said the situation in the southern
Serbian province was as bad now as two weeks ago when the Alliance
started finalizing airstrike plans to force Milosevic to halt his
violent crackdown against Kosovo Albanian separatists.
	   Holbrooke said he planned to drive home to Milosevic ``the
extreme gravity of the situation.'' Holbrooke negotiated the Bosnia
peace deal with Milosevic in 1995.
	   In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said ``systematic
terror'' had been inflicted on Kosovo civilians within recent days
and that Yugoslav forces were mostly responsible.
	   But Annan said he did not ``have the means necessary to provide
an independent assessment of compliance as required by the Security
Council'' and suggested the 15 members may want to make their ``own
judgment in this respect.''
	   NATO members had been waiting for Annan's report to determine
whether they would take military action against Milosevic's forces.
	   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said in Brussels, however,
that the Alliance believed Yugoslavia had not yet met the
conditions demanded by the U.N. Security Council.
	   ``The reality coming to us is that the compliance is not yet in
place,'' Solana said. ``As far as we are concerned, once again, I
can tell you we are ready.''
	   Meanwhile, Yugoslavia's prime minister told an emergency session
of parliament Monday that the country ``is faced with the imminent
danger of war.'' Yugoslavia is comprised of dominant Serbia and
smaller Montenegro.
	   ``The threats are serious,'' Prime Minister Momir Bulatovic
said. ``And I call on this parliament to conclude that Yugoslavia
is faced with the imminent danger of war. Yugoslavia has to defend
itself if it was attacked.''
	   One option could be for parliament to declare a state of
emergency _ a step which could lead to a general mobilization of
all military-aged men. But Yugoslav Defense Minister Pavle
Bulatovic told reporters that no such declaration would be made
Monday.
	   In an attempt to head off NATO action, Momir Bulatovic said the
government had accepted a Russian proposal for the 54-nation
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to investigate
the crisis.
	   Yugoslavia had repeatedly rejected such a mission to Kosovo
until Yugoslav membership in the organization is restored.
	   The prime minister also said there was no longer any fighting in
Kosovo, where Albanian represent 90 percent of the 2-million
population. He said five of the 10 special police units had been
removed from Kosovo and the others had been returned to barracks in
the province.
	   Holbrooke made clear that half-measures would not be enough to
satisfy Washington and prevent a NATO attack.
	   ``While the level of fighting may have abated temporarily, the
capacity for its resumption is there,'' Holbrooke said after
meeting Solana and the Supreme Allied Commander Europe, Gen. Wesley
K. Clark.
	   German Gen. Dieter Stoeckmann told German Radio that air attacks
could be only days away.
	   The guns were largely silent in Kosovo Monday.
	   Diplomats in Kosovo said they have observed an informal
cease-fire since last Thursday and were not aware of any aggressive
operations by government forces against ethnic Albanians or the
rebel Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   One diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there
has been a significant redeployment of Yugoslav army troops out of
Kosovo to other parts of Serbia, including a mechanized brigade
that pulled out on Sunday.
	   Some army units remain in the field, and there is enormous fear
among the people that the violence will resume, particularly among
tens of thousands of refugees -- many of whom are living in the
hills and forests without shelter.
	   Meanwhile, the head of Yugoslavia's other republic, Montenegro,
called on Milosevic to accept all international demands and avert a
NATO attack.
	   ``We have to avert a clash with the whole world, the
confrontation which we are bound to lose,'' Montenegro's
pro-Western president, Milo Djukanovic, said in a statement.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Jose Ortiz, a Puerto Rican center who
played for his national team at this summer's Goodwill Games and
World Basketball Championships, received a two year ban for using
steroids.
	   According to a statement issued Monday by the Greek Basketball
Federation, the 35-year-old Ortiz tested positive for the banned
drug stanozolol in a test taken during the World Championships held
here from July 29 to Aug. 9. A second sample tested positive on
Sept. 17. Puerto Rico finished 11th at the Worlds.
	   Stanozolol is the same steroid that Canadian sprinter Ben
Johnson tested positive for at the 1988 Seoul Olympic Games.
	   The decision to ban Ortiz, who plays for PAOK Salonica, was in
line with international regulations, the Greek federation said. It
did not provide any more details on the case.
	   The 2.10-meter (6-foot-10 1/2 inches) Ortiz has in the past
played for Oregon State, the Utah Stars, Spain's Saragosa, Real
Madrid and Barcelona. In Greece, he played for Larissa, Heraklion
and last season for Aris Salonica.

China signs key human rights pact

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with UN human rights chief praising signing, urging
China to implement treaties before ratification; Picks up 7th graf

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ China signed a key human rights treaty
Monday that calls for freedom of expression, religion and
self-determination, and pledged its willingness to safeguard human
rights.
	   The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is one
of two accords seen as fundamental to protecting human rights.
China has signed the other one _ the International Covenant on
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights _ but hasn't ratified it.
	   In a signing ceremony at U.N. headquarters, China's U.N.
ambassador, Qin Huasun, said the Chinese government was
deliberating now on ratifying that accord.
	   ``All these have demonstrated the firm resolve of China to
promote and protect human rights,'' the ambassador said.
	   Although China has signed both treaties, they won't come into
force until ratified by China's legislature, which may attach
reservations effectively nullifying some provisions.
	   Just hours before China signed the document, police in Beijing
hauled a prominent human rights campaigner in for questioning. Qin
Yongmin's latest run-in with the authorities came as he tried for
the second time in a week to legally register a human rights
monitoring group.
	   In a statement, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights,
Mary Robinson welcomed Monday's signing and called on China to
``take an extra step and apply the standards enshrined in the two
covenants even before ratification.''
	   Qin Huasun told reporters after signing the accord that China
believed in dialogue on the question of human rights ``on the basis
of mutual respect.'' He said a recent trip to China by Robinson,
helped both sides understand each other better.

Lyuboslav Penev quits national team
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Bulgaria's high-scoring forward Lyuboslav
Penev said Monday he was quitting the national team.
	   Penev, 32, has played in Spain for seven years and moved
recently from Compostella to Celta. He has scored five goals in his
last two matches.
	   ``My decision is final,'' Penev told journalists at the Sofia
airport. Earlier he had been boycotting the national team because
of run-ins with former coach Hristo Bonev.
	   Bonev resigned last month amid harsh criticism following the
national squad's poor performance at the World Cup and a
humiliating loss in the first European qualifying game against
Poland.
	   ``Bulgaria needs a young and fresh new natioanl squad,'' Penev
said.
	   Penev's resignation is the latest in a number of such
announcments made by members of Bulgaria's ``dream team,'' which
reached the '94 World Cup semifinals.
	   Stuttgart's midfielder Krasimir Balakov, defender Trifon Ivanov
and forward Emil Kostadinov left the team immediately after the
team's poor performance in France, where the side was beaten 6-1 by
Spain and failed to get past the first round.

Holbrooke warns Milosevic of NATO strikes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES throughout with Holbrooke meeting
underway; Yugoslav defense minister says no state of emergency; no
fighting in Kosovo. CHANGES byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By DUSAN STOJANOVIC &QC;

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ With NATO attacks said to be only
days away, a top U.S. envoy met with Slobodan Milosevic in a
last-minute warning to halt his crackdown in Kosovo or face
airstrikes.
	   Richard Holbrooke began his meeting with the Yugoslav president
Monday evening after arriving from Brussels, Belgium, where he
conferred with senior NATO officials.
	   In Brussels, Holbrooke said the situation in the southern
Serbian province was as bad now as two weeks ago when the alliance
started finalizing airstrike plans to force Milosevic to halt his
violent crackdown against Kosovo Albanian separatists.
	   Holbrooke said he planned to drive home to Milosevic ``the
extreme gravity of the situation.'' Holbrooke negotiated the Bosnia
peace deal with Milosevic in 1995.
	   Hundreds of people _ mostly ethnic Albanian civilians _ have
been killed and 275,000 uprooted since the crackdown began in
February. Most ethnic Albanians want independence for the province,
which Milosevic stripped of its autonomy in 1989.
	   In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said ``systematic
terror'' had been inflicted on Kosovo civilians in recent days and
that Yugoslav forces were mostly responsible.
	   NATO members had been waiting for Annan's report to determine
whether they would take military action against Milosevic's forces.
But Annan said he did not ``have the means necessary to provide an
independent assessment of compliance as required by the Security
Council'' and suggested the 15 alliance members make their ``own
judgment in this respect.''
	   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said in Brussels, however,
that the Alliance believed Yugoslavia had not yet met the
conditions demanded by the U.N. Security Council.
	   ``The reality coming to us is that the compliance is not yet in
place,'' Solana said. ``As far as we are concerned, once again, I
can tell you we are ready.''
	   Meanwhile, Yugoslavia's prime minister told an emergency session
of parliament Monday that the country ``is faced with the imminent
danger of war.'' Yugoslavia is comprised of dominant Serbia and
smaller Montenegro.
	   ``The threats are serious,'' Prime Minister Momir Bulatovic
said. ``And I call on this parliament to conclude that Yugoslavia
is faced with the imminent danger of war. Yugoslavia has to defend
itself if it was attacked.''
	   One option could be for parliament to declare a state of
emergency _ which could lead to a general mobilization of all
military-aged men. But Yugoslav Defense Minister Pavle Bulatovic
told reporters that no such declaration would be made Monday.
	   In an attempt to head off NATO action, Momir Bulatovic said the
government had accepted a Russian proposal for the 54-nation
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to investigate
the crisis.
	   Yugoslavia had repeatedly rejected such a mission to Kosovo
until Yugoslav membership in the organization is restored.
	   The prime minister also said there was no longer any fighting in
Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians represent 90 percent of the
2-million population. He said five of the 10 special police units
had been removed from Kosovo and the others had been returned to
barracks in the province.
	   Holbrooke made clear that half-measures would not be enough to
satisfy Washington and prevent a NATO attack.
	   ``While the level of fighting may have abated temporarily, the
capacity for its resumption is there,'' Holbrooke said after
meeting Solana and the Supreme Allied Commander Europe, Gen. Wesley
K. Clark.
	   German Gen. Dieter Stoeckmann told German Radio that air attacks
could be only days away.
	   The guns were largely silent Monday in Kosovo.
	   Diplomats in Kosovo said they have observed an informal
cease-fire since last Thursday and were not aware of any aggressive
operations by government forces against ethnic Albanians or the
rebel Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   One diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there
has been a significant redeployment of Yugoslav army troops out of
Kosovo to other parts of Serbia, including a mechanized brigade
that pulled out on Sunday.
	   Some army units remain in the field, and there is enormous fear
that violence will resume, particularly among refugees -- tens of
thousands of whom are living in the hills and forests without
shelter.
	   Meanwhile, the head of Yugoslavia's other republic, Montenegro,
called on Milosevic to accept all international demands and avert a
NATO attack.
	   ``We have to avert a clash with the whole world, the
confrontation which we are bound to lose,'' Montenegro's
pro-Western president, Milo Djukanovic, said in a statement.

<TEXT>
	   CALGARY, Alberta (AP) _ The goaltender of Canada's national
women's hockey team will miss the next season because she is
pregnant.
	   Manon Rheaume, who married national in-line hockey player and
former minor leaguer Gerry St. Cyr during the summer, is expected
to give birth in May. She will miss the entire 1998-99 season,
including the 1999 women's world hockey championship in Espoo,
Finland.
	   Rheaume, 26, was the first woman to play in an NHL game,
appearing in an exhibition game for the Tampa Bay Lightning in
1992. She was a member of Canada's Olympic silver-medal winning
team at the Nagano Olympics.

A German energy corperation looks for a change in landsacape
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Vasa Energy, the daughter of a major
Scandinavian alternative energy concern called Monday for the new
German government to take a stand for ecologically friendly forms
of energy.
	   In contrast to most other energy companies, the Scandinavian
Vatenfell AB, called for an end to nuclear energy and would like to
take part in the implementation in Germany of water and wind energy
plans.
	   Micheal Saalfeld, chairman of Vasa Energy, said he feels sure
that the ideas of eventually replacing nuclear energy, the
development of reusable forms of energy and more energy efficieny
can be resolved.
	   ``We agree with the overall goals of SPD and Alliance '90/Greens
in the area of energy policies,'' Saalfeld said.
	   In April a law was passed ending the practical monopoly of
nuclear energy. This made way for alternative forms of energy and
provides incentive for companies to invest in other power sources.
	   Since natural gas is a relatively clean form of energy and is
indispensible in the mid-term for energy reforms, lowering of
Germany's artificially-high natural gas tax to the level of other
European countries is also needed, Saalfeld said.

Adams calls for international help to resolve Basque conflict

<TEXT>
	   BILBAO, Spain (AP) _ The recent cease-fire by Basque gunmen
provides a prime opportunity to resolve Spain's conflict and the
international community, particularly the United States, has a duty
to help bring about a resolution, Irish republican leader Gerry
Adams said Monday.
	   ``Powerful nations have a duty to assist, and clearly the United
States is the most powerful,'' said Adams, who heads the Sinn Fein
party, linked with the Irish Republican Army.
	   ``We would be calling on the international community to assist
in every situation, but especially one like the Basque country
where an initiative has been taken,'' Adams said shortly after
arriving in the northern Basque town of Bilbao.
	   A group of Basque political parties seeking a Basque homeland
handed Adams a proposal for all-party peace talks. The group, known
as the Irish Forum, claimed inspiration from the Northern Ireland
peace process and its success in opening the door for a political
settlement in the troubled British province.
	   ``I am very pleased to be here and to be in anyway helpful in
your search for peace,'' Adams said as he was presented the
proposal, known as the Lizarra Declaration. It has been credited
with encouraging the armed Basque separatist group ETA to call its
indefinite cease-fire.
	   The forum wants Adams to pass along its proposal to U.S.
President Bill Clinton when the two meet this month. Adams
described Clinton's input into Northern Irish peace process as
``crucial and pivotal.''
	   A copy of the proposal has already been sent to South African
President Nelson Mandela and the United Nations.
	   The ETA began the cease-fire Sept. 18 in its campaign for an
independent Basque state that it hopes will unite territory in
northern Spain and southwestern France. The ETA _ an acronym in the
Basque language Euskera for Basque Homeland and Freedom _ has
killed nearly 800 people since 1968.
	   The Spanish government has long rejected ETA's demand for a
self-determination vote for Basques.
	   Adams was greeted by 100 Basque independence supporters waving
Irish and Basque flags.
	   Speaking before some 50 journalists, Adams _ whose Sinn Fein
party has long had close connections with the Herri Batasuna party
allied to ETA _ called on the Spanish government to put aside its
``distrust'' of ETA and ``grasp this opportunity'' for peace.
	   Conservative Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar has insisted that
ETA must provide greater proof of its peaceful intentions before a
peace process be set in motion.
	   During his stay in the Basque country, Adams was also to visit a
Herri Batasuna member Karmelo Landa in his prison cell outside
Bilbao.
	   Landa was jailed last December along with 22 other party leaders
convicted of collaborating with ETA for using television electoral
broadcast time to show a video in which the gunmen urged peace
talks.
	   ETA commanded considerable support in the Basque region and
elsewhere in Spain during the final years of the 1939-75
dictatorship of Gen. Francisco Franco.
	   It has lost ground in recent years, with little public support
for an armed campaign given the level of self-government the Basque
region has enjoyed since democracy returned in 1978.
	   Adams was to return to Belfast later Monday.

<TEXT>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ Guerrillas detonated roadside bombs in
southern Lebanon on Monday, killing two Israeli soldiers and
injuring three others, Lebanese security officials said.
	   Hezbollah, the Shiite Muslim guerrilla group fighting Israeli
forces in the south, claimed responsibility, saying its fighters
simultaneously detonated two bombs as an Israeli convoy was
passing.
	   A statement from the group said the targeted road linked bases
manned by Israeli troops and their allied South Lebanon Army
militia.
	   There was no immediate comment from Israel on the incident.
	   The Lebanese officials, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity, said the Israelis were in a vehicle on the main road
leading into the town of Hasbaya when the bombs exploded at Monday
afternoon.
	   The casualties were first brought to Marjayoun, the main town in
the Israeli-occupied zone, and later taken to Israel, the officials
said. One of the soldiers was killed instantly and four were
wounded. One of the wounded later died, the officials said.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah and other Lebanese guerrilla groups
are fighting to oust Israel from its self-styled ``security zone''
in southern Lebanon.
	   Israel established the border enclave in 1985 to try to prevent
cross-border guerrilla attacks.

Romance captures the end-of-the-century runway

 &UR; AP Fashion Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Italian designers plan to bid a romantic
farewell to the century, and the millennium.
	   In fact the spring-summer 1999 collections are all about love,
not lust, with ultra-soft fabrics and delicate, feminine touches.
	   Even a designer with an edge as sharp as that of Donatella
Versace filed down her spike heels and lowered her hemlines to keep
pace with the new mood.
	   But not to fear. The infamous Versace slits still prevailed at
the latest Versus collection, presented in a former warehouse
Sunday evening. They came as a rip down the front of a blouse, or a
slash up the back of a boot, creating a raunchy rather than
romantic effect.
	   Heavy makeup, especially around the eyes, fits the urban style
of the Versus girls, but the prevailing look is pale and
soap-polished. Hair-styles, too, are demurely pinned-up with
delicate clips and combs. Red is the preferred hue to better set
off the ivory skin.
	   Alberta Ferretti, who has made a trademark out of femininity,
had little trouble adjusting to the current look.
	   Her new Philosophy collection presented Sunday looked like a
19th-century bucolic painting with country girls in full, quilted
skirts and delicately embroidered tops. Colors ranged from pale
beige to geranium red. Dainty slippers and clogs completed the
modern maiden look.
	   The same old-world feeling permeated the runway at Blumarine by
Anna Molinari early Monday.
	   Hundreds of pink roses hung from the runway backdrop, to
underline the floral theme of the warm weather collection. Black
slip dresses printed with large pink roses and covered in a veil of
black tulle; sweet pink cashmere sweaters with cozy, fur collars;
and the delicately embroidered bodices of floor-length gowns all
combined to create a yesteryear atmosphere.
	   For hip American designer Lawrence Steele, the step back in time
must have been giant, but on the runway it looked effortless. Greek
maidens in breast-revealing white toga dresses, prima ballerinas in
plumed skirts and career women in simple _ but oh so feminine _
light wool floor length shifts, made up the contemporary charm of
the collection.
	   Unfortunately, the underage models used to emphasize the current
romantic mood strike an off-note in all this fashion harmony.
	   British model Devon, 16, part of the bucolic scene at
Philosophy, just passes for a full fledged teen-ager. But
13-year-old Jeisa Chiminizzo of Brazil, who modeled Sunday for
Lambros Milona rather than walking under the floodlights, should be
bending over her schoolbooks.

Blair Cabinet united on Kosovo air strikes

 &UR; RETRANSMITTING  &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES to add cancellation of soccer match between Ireland
and Yugoslavia in graf 6 &QL; 
 &UR; With NATO-Kosovo, EU-Kosovo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prime Minister Tony Blair's Cabinet met in special
session Monday and were united in urging imminent air strikes
against Serb forces in Kosovo, officials said.
	   ``We are getting ready for NATO action and later this week we
will expect a decision to be taken,'' Foreign Secretary Robin Cook
said after the meeting. ``Milosevic (Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic) has only a few days this week to listen to the
international community.''
	   Britain's Chief of Defense Staff, Gen. Sir Charles Guthrie, was
at the morning meeting, arranged before Blair left on a visit to
China.
	   Blair's government has been the most forthright in Europe in
urging military action against Serb forces in retaliation for
brutal treatment of the ethnic Albanian majority of the Yugoslav
province.
	   ``All members of the Cabinet of this government are united in
our determination that President Milosevic must be compelled to
abide by the terms of the Security Council resolution,'' Cook told
reporters. ``He must stop hostilities in Kosovo and allow the
refugees to return in safety and he also has to start real dialogue
with the international community.''
	   Meanwhile, a European Championship soccer qualifying match
between Ireland and Yugoslavia, due to have been played in Belgrade
on Saturday, was canceled Monday. The game was postponed by UEFA,
the game's European governing body, for security reasons. Last
week, a match between England and Yugoslavia was scrapped for
similar reasons.

Holbrooke warns Milosevic of NATO strikes

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) - With NATO attacks said to be only
days away, a top U.S. envoy arrived Monday with an 11th-hour
warning to Slobodan Milosevic to comply with international demands
to halt his crackdown in Kosovo or face airstrikes.
	   Richard Holbrooke began his meeting with the Yugoslav president
Monday evening after arriving from Brussels, Belgium, where he
conferred with senior NATO officials.
	   In Brussels, Holbrooke said the situation in the southern
Serbian province was as bad now as two weeks ago when the Alliance
started finalizing airstrike plans to force Milosevic to halt his
crackdown against Kosovo Albanian separatists.
	   Holbrooke said he planned to drive home to Milosevic ``the
extreme gravity of the situation.'' Holbrooke negotiated the Bosnia
peace deal with Milosevic in 1995.
	   In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said ``systematic
terror'' had been inflicted on Kosovo civilians within recent days
and that Yugoslav forces were mostly responsible.
	   But Annan said he did not ``have the means necessary to provide
an independent assessment of compliance as required by the Security
Council'' and suggested the 15 members may want to make their ``own
judgment in this respect.''
	   NATO members had been waiting for Annan's report to determine
whether they would take military action against Milosevic's forces.
	   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said in Brussels, however,
that the Alliance believed Yugoslavia had not yet met the
conditions demanded by the U.N. Security Council.
	   ``The reality coming to us is that the compliance is not yet in
place,'' Solana said. ``As far as we are concerned, once again, I
can tell you we are ready.''
	   Meanwhile, Yugoslavia's prime minister told an emergency session
of parliament Monday that the country ``is faced with the imminent
danger of war.'' Yugoslavia is comprised of dominant Serbia and
smaller Montenegro.
	   ``The threats are serious,'' Prime Minister Momir Bulatovic
said. ``And I call on this parliament to conclude that Yugoslavia
is faced with the imminent danger of war. Yugoslavia has to defend
itself if it was attacked.''
	   One option was for parliament to declare a state of emergency _
a step which would lead to a general mobilization of all
military-aged men. But the parliament voted to introduce the
measure ``when the first bomb drops on our territory.''

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's former No. 2 leader,
wearing a neck brace, accused police Monday of treating him worse
than a criminal as he was ordered to face trial next month on four
charges of abusing his former powers.
	   The landmark trial of ex-Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim,
seen as a test for Malaysia's judicial and political system, starts
Nov. 2 on corruption charges. There will be a separate trial later
on charges of engaging in illegal homosexual acts.
	   But then it will halt as leaders of 18 nations assemble in Kuala
Lumpur for the Asia-Pacific Economic Conference from Nov. 14 to 23.
	   Although Judge Augustine Paul did not give any reasons for the
recess, it will allow Malaysia to concentrate on the summit to be
attended by President Bill Clinton and Russia's Boris Yeltsin.
	   For Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, the political crisis
sparked by the Sept. 2 firing of his former heir apparent has
already captured international attention during the Commonwealth
Games and the visit of Queen Elizabeth II.
	   Now it threatens to overshadow the APEC summit, being attended
by many governments which have criticized Malaysia for throttling
dissent. Indonesian President B.J. Habibie and Philippines
President Joseph Estrada have called Anwar their friend and raised
the prospect of not attending.
	   Anwar is admired in international financial circles and his
local popularity increased as he challenged Mahathir's
17-year-rule. They disagreed over economic policy as Malaysia sank
into recession and Mahathir grew suspicious that Anwar wanted to
oust him before he was ready to retire.
	   After two weeks of rallies calling for Mahathir's resignation
and reform of the government, Anwar was arrested on Sept. 20. Nine
days later he appeared for his first arraignment with a black eye,
bruised neck and arms.
	   Anwar has alleged that he was beaten until he fell unconscious
on his first night in jail Sept. 20. But a hospital medical report
has been kept secret and there was no explanation in court for the
sudden appearance of the neck brace.
	   ``I've been treated worse than any other criminal,'' Anwar said,
pleading innocent to all the charges.
	   Although the court denied bail to Anwar, charged with five
counts of corruption and five of illegal homosexual acts, his
lawyers won access to him to discuss the case, something that many
would take for granted.
	   Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail, reached her hand between two burly,
plain-clothed officers at Monday's court appearance to stroke his
brow, and he reached back stiffly to hold his daughter's hand.
	   Anwar's wife is prohibited from addressing the public. Police
have banned all gatherings connected with the reform movement, and
are holding several of Anwar's associates.
	   There are fears that journalists dispatched to cover APEC may
find the Anwar legal story juicier. Malaysia last month criticized
reporters who came for the Commonwealth Games, then rushed off to
cover Anwar's rallies, arrest and police action against
demonstrators.
	   High Court Judge Augustine Paul denied bail for Anwar, saying
the prosecution had convinced him that the jailed politician might
interfere with witnesses.
	   He faces a maximum of 20 years imprisonment for each sex charge,
and 14 years if found guilty on any count of abusing his powers as
Malaysia's second-most powerful man.
	   Judge Paul also issued a gag order against all public statements
about Anwar's guilt or innocence and said the trial would be
conducted in English ``so that justice can be seen to be done.''
	   ``The judge isn't only me but millions of others,'' said Paul,
noting the international attention.
	   The gag order came after Anwar lawyer Raja Azia Addruse said:
``A number of persons of high office have seen fit to express
publicly ... that my client is already guilty of the offenses.''
	   It appeared to be a clear reference to Mahathir, who described
in detail the sexual allegations against Anwar at a news conference
and said in a newspaper interview his former deputy was sure to be
convicted.

Libyan lawyers head to U.N. to discuss trial
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A team of Libyan lawyers has left for New
York for meetings with U.N. officials to clarify questions about a
proposal to try two suspects in the 1988 Pan Am bombing, Libya's
JANA news agency reported Monday.
	   Libya has accepted a compromise proposal by the U.S. and British
governments to try the suspects in the Netherlands by Scottish
judges under Scottish law. But it has demanded assurances for the
men's safety.
	   JANA did not say when the lawyers left Tripoli for New York nor
did it say when they are expected to begin their meetings with U.N.
officials.
	   U.N. legal counsel Hans Corell has been consulting with the
Libyan government since last month when Tripoli requested in a
letter that Secretary-general Kofi Annan help clarify some issues
in the U.S.-British proposal.
	   The Libyan team is to discuss the legal and security
arrangements as well as guarantees that the two men will be in the
Netherlands ``on the basis that it is the first and final stop,
rather than a transit point to another country,'' said JANA,
monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation.
	   The team will also discuss Libya's demand that in case of
indictment, the men would serve their sentences ``in a country to
be agreed upon provided that it is not the United States or Britain
and that the trial is fair and just, the agency said.
	   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi said last week that he will not
hand over the suspects because the United States may kidnap them.
	   The U.N. Security Council imposed sanctions that ban direct
flights to an from Libya in 1992 to try to force Tripoli into
surrendering the two Libyans wanted in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am
passenger plane over Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270 people.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan told the
Security Council on Monday that most of the recent atrocities in
Kosovo were committed by Yugoslav forces and their attacks on
ethnic Albanians increased following a U.N. resolution demanding a
cease-fire.
	   In a widely anticipated report, the U.N. chief said he didn't
have the means to verify whether Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic had complied with U.N. resolutions demanding an end to
the hostilities. Annan recommended that the Security Council
determine such compliance using his report as a guideline.
	   NATO members had been waiting for the report to decide whether
they would take military action in the southern Serb province,
where Serb forces have tried to crush an independence movement by
Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority.
	   It wasn't clear if Annan's report would be the decision-making
document NATO had sought. Though strongly worded in its
condemnation of the atrocities and Serb attacks, Annan reiterates
what others have said for weeks and dodges the thornier issue of
making a final determination of Serb compliance with U.N.
resolutions.
	   But U.S. State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said the
report was strong because it documented the continued armed
presence of special police in Kosovo and that no fundamental change
had occurred to allow people to return home.
	   ``We think it's a very strong report that makes clear Milosevic
has not complied with all relevant provisions of the Security
Council resolution,'' Rubin told reporters.

Iranian student group calls for freedom of the press
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 8-13 with two more publications banned. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A student committee on Monday called for
freedom of speech in Iran and criticized the arrest of several
writers and journalists.
	   The Committee of Students Defending Political Prisoners accused
a Tehran court of using ``illegal and undemocratic methods'' when
it questioned five writers last week for trying revive a writers'
association.
	   It warned in a statement that these measures ``would lead only
to a security crisis.'' It did not elaborate.
	   During the past few days, five prominent authors were summoned
to a state security court and warned against reviving the
association, which was abolished shortly after the 1979 Islamic
Revolution.
	   One of the writers told the British Broadcasting Corporation
that they were told their association was an illegal underground
political organization and they could be put on trial for
anti-state activities.
	   The five writers are Mansour Kooshan, Houshang Golshiri, Kazem
Kardavani, Mohammad Pooyandeh and Ali Darvishian.
	   Iran's press has been facing its most difficult period since it
gained more freedom with last year's election of moderate President
Mohammad Khatami. Four newspapers were closed last month and six
journalists arrested.
	   The official Islamic Republic News Agency reported Monday that a
Tehran court has temporarily banned two editors from publishing
their periodicals.
	   Mohammad Salamati, the owner and editor-in-chief of the Asr-e
Ma, was banned from publishing his paper for six months.
	   ``He was charged with repeated publication of offensive articles
on a large scale,'' the agency.
	   Salamati, accused of insulting and defaming figures and
disseminating lies, was also fined three million rials (dlrs
1,000).
	   The court also banned Mehdi Nasiri, the owner and
editor-in-chief of the monthly Sobh from publishing for four
months.
	   ``The sentence was issued in accordance with Article 19 of the
Islamic Punishment Law,'' IRNA said. It gave no further details.

France denies Pinochet a visa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The French Foreign Ministry has denied a visa to
Gen. Augusto Pinochet to visit France, Ministry spokeswoman Anne
Gazeau Secret said Monday.
	   Gazeau-Secret told a regular news briefing she would not comment
on the decision, which she said spoke for itself.
	   The former Chilean dictator, who is now a senator-for-life, is
currently on a trip to London.
	   Pinochet was in power from 1973 after he led the military coup
that ousted Salvador Allende until 1990.
	   Thousands of Chileans fled their country, and many of them
settled in France.

Russian oil companies attack government's emergency budget
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's top oil companies attacked the
government's emergency budget for the remainder of the year Monday,
saying they will be crippled by its heavy taxes.
	   Details of the budget have not been released, but the
cash-starved government is expected to rely heavily on oil export
taxes for revenue. Russian oil companies are extremely dependent on
exports for cash, since much of the domestic economy is based on
barter.
	   ``These measures proposed by the Ministry of Finance are
unacceptable and they will bring about a catastrophe,'' said Vasily
Shakhnovsky, vice-chairman of the board of Yukos-Moscow.
	   The executives also asked for more time to address their
internal problems and for government credits to support the
industry.
	   ``Give us four to five months to breathe,'' said Leonid Fedun,
vice-president of Russia's premier oil producer, Lukoil.
	   The executives also said the government's budget estimates for
oil export revenues are unrealistic in view of the decline in world
oil prices and oil companies' debts to foreign creditors.
	   The executives said they expect the country's oil production to
drop by 10 million metric tons (70 million barrels) to 15 million
metric tons (105 million barrels) in 1998, a decline of about 5
percent. Oil production totaled about 297 million metric tons (2
billion barrels) in 1997, according to the State Statistics
Committee.
	   Fedun and Shakhnovsky said they expect the decline in production
to continue in 1999 and 2000 because of the need to make capital
improvements to the industry.
	   The new government's economic plan should include tax subsidies
and other measures for stimulating investment, with particular
support for exporters, Fedun and Shakhnovsky said.
	   They added that Russia's oil companies should be actively
involved in the formation of the program, which should also include
support for a realistic ruble exchange rate.

U.N. health conference ends meetings in Beirut
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ A U.N. health conference of the eastern
Mediterranean countries ended here Monday with a call to fight
emerging diseases.
	   Representatives from 22 countries discussed wide-ranging issues,
including health care provision, illness prevention and health
education during the three-day conference.
	   ``The objective of such meetings is to build health, prevent
illness and pursue the goal of health for all,'' said Gro Harlem
Bruntland, director-general of the World Health Organization.
	   The conference is organized by WHO's Regional Committee for the
Eastern Mediterranean.
	   Bruntland said discussions focused on means of eradicating
diseases such as tuberculosis and polio and attaining
self-sufficiency in the production of medicine and vaccines, as
well as emerging illnesses, particularly malaria and AIDS.
	   Harlem Bruntland called on governments to step up the fight
against smoking by legislating anti-smoking laws and banning
tobacco advertisements.
	   She urged compliance with WHO resolutions, adding that the
organization ``will be more active'' in building partnerships with
the private sector to help achieve its goals.

Moms' prenatal cocaine use linked to kids' classroom behavior
</HEADLINE>
problems &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: Hold for release at 5 p.m. EDT. (2100 GMT) &QL; 
 &UR; By LINDSEY TANNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Children born to mothers who used cocaine during
pregnancy run a higher risk of developing long-term behavior
problems, a study of first-graders suggests.
	   Teachers who were asked to rate classroom behavior reported that
cocaine-exposed children showed more problems in 11 of 14 areas,
including distractibility, social skills, hyperactivity and
disorganization.
	   ``Clearly, children exposed to cocaine were at risk for
behavioral problems,'' said the researchers, led by Dr. Virginia
Delaney-Black of Wayne State University's School of Medicine.
	   However, the researchers cautioned that the study did not take
into account other factors that could have caused the problems _
such as inattentive mothers, or trouble in the home _ and said
larger studies are needed to learn whether cocaine really does have
a long-term biological effect.
	   The study of 102 youngsters appears in the October issue of
Pediatrics, published by the American Academy of Pediatrics.
	   Numerous studies have linked mothers' cocaine use to problems in
their newborns, including low birth weight, prematurity,
irritability and trembling. But whether cocaine causes any lasting
effects is less settled.
	   Some research has shown normal cognitive development in older
children whose mothers used cocaine during pregnancy. But other
studies have suggested that the drug may cause some long-term
neurological damage.
	   Dr. Ira J. Chasnoff, a Chicago pediatrician and president of the
National Association for Families and Addiction Research and
Education, believes that cocaine use during pregnancy causes
neurological changes in the fetus that impair the ability to
``self-regulate'' behavior.
	   Chasnoff said Delaney-Black's findings echo his research
involving school-age children. But he noted that in many cases
cocaine users may also be drinking alcohol and taking other drugs
that might be the cause of behavioral problems in their children.
	   In the Delaney-Black study, none of the mothers reported using
either heroin or methadone. The researchers took drinking and
smoking by the mothers into account, but not marijuana use, which
was reported by 30 percent of the cocaine users.
	   The researchers also noted that other variables not studied
could explain the behavior problems, such as a lack of mother-child
interaction or emotional trauma that may have occurred if the
mothers continued using drugs after childbirth.
	   ``It is quite likely that other maternal and environmental
factors play a significant role in determining child behavior,''
they wrote.

Newspaper: German unemployment down slightly in September
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Joblessness in September was down slightly in
Germany to under 4 million, a newspaper said Monday.
	   In an early report preceding the official release of
unemployment figures by the Federal Labor Office in Nuremberg
Tuesday, the daily Berliner Morgenpost said 3.965 million people
were out of work, or 130,000 less than in August.
	   The unofficial figure if confirmed Tuesday means 10.3 percent of
Germany's work force were out of work last month, compared to 10.6
percent in August.
	   It is also 343,000 less than in September 1997, the report said.
	   According to the newspaper, there were 1.232 million jobless or
16.3 percent in the eastern states, which are still struggling to
boost their economies eight years after unification.
	   In the west, there were 2.733 million - or 8.8 percent - people
out of work, said the report that appears in the newspaper's
Tuesday editions.

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana
said Monday that Yugoslavia had not yet complied with U.N.
resolutions on Kosovo and stressed that NATO was ready to launch a
military attack.
	   Supreme Allied Commander Europe Wesley K. Clark said that, once
given the green light, NATO's military operation would likely be
fast and furious.
	   ``NATO action, should a political decision be taken, could come
in a matter of hours and days,'' Clark told reporters.
	   Solana went beyond the assessment of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan, who said in a report in New York that he lacked the means to
verify whether Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic had complied
with U.N. demands aimed at halting the conflict.
	   ``I'm sure that Mr. Annan has put in his document what he thinks
is the reality. The reality according to us is that the compliance
has not taken place,'' said Solana.
	   Solana met earlier Monday with U.S. special envoy Richard
Holbrooke, who said the military situation in Kosovo remains
critical despite a lull in fighting and the removal of some
Yugoslav tanks and troops from the battlefield.
	   After a meeting with Solana and Clark, Holbrooke said that
``while the level of fighting (in Kosovo) may have abated
temporarily, the capacity for its resumption is there.''
	   ``The situation therefore remains fully as serious today as it
was a week or two ago,'' he told reporters before flying to
Belgrade.
	   He said Solana and Clark told him that ``significant military
forces, regular forces and military uniformed police, remain in
Kosovo.''
	   The United States has strongly urged NATO to act but European
allies have shown caution and resisted calls for NATO to set a
deadline for Milosevic to pull his Kosovo forces back.
	   Holbrooke was told NATO preparations to launch military action
against Yugoslavia continue.
	   ``At NATO, the planning for military action is serious, intense
and sustained,'' he said.
	   Solana said that ``Mr. Holbrooke will tell Milosevic that the
resolution of the U.N. Security Council is there to be complied
with. If not, he knows that NATO is prepared to act.''
	   NATO has approved an ``activation request'' for the 16 allied
nations to formally commit warplanes and other forces for an
eventual air campaign.
	   However, the NATO Council, made up of ambassadors from the
allied nations, has come no closer to taking a political decision
to launch air raids and failed to overcome differences over whether
the alliance needs a clearer U.N. mandate before it can attack.

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) - With NATO attacks said to be only
days away, a top U.S. envoy arrived Monday with an 11th-hour
warning to Slobodan Milosevic to comply with international demands
to halt his crackdown in Kosovo or face airstrikes.
	   Richard Holbrooke began his meeting with the Yugoslav president
Monday evening after arriving from Brussels, Belgium, where he
conferred with senior NATO officials.
	   In Brussels, Holbrooke said the situation in the southern
Serbian province was as bad now as two weeks ago when the Alliance
started finalizing airstrike plans to force Milosevic to halt his
crackdown against Kosovo Albanian separatists.
	   Holbrooke said he planned to drive home to Milosevic ``the
extreme gravity of the situation.'' Holbrooke negotiated the Bosnia
peace deal with Milosevic in 1995.
	   In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said ``systematic
terror'' had been inflicted on Kosovo civilians within recent days
and that Yugoslav forces were mostly responsible.
	   But Annan said he did not ``have the means necessary to provide
an independent assessment of compliance as required by the Security
Council'' and suggested the 15 members may want to make their ``own
judgment in this respect.''
	   NATO members had been waiting for Annan's report to determine
whether they would take military action against Milosevic's forces.
	   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said in Brussels, however,
that the Alliance believed Yugoslavia had not yet met the
conditions demanded by the U.N. Security Council.
	   ``The reality coming to us is that the compliance is not yet in
place,'' Solana said. ``As far as we are concerned, once again, I
can tell you we are ready.''
	   Meanwhile, Yugoslavia's prime minister told an emergency session
of parliament Monday that the country ``is faced with the imminent
danger of war.'' Yugoslavia is comprised of dominant Serbia and
smaller Montenegro.
	   ``The threats are serious,'' Prime Minister Momir Bulatovic
said. ``And I call on this parliament to conclude that Yugoslavia
is faced with the imminent danger of war. Yugoslavia has to defend
itself if it was attacked.''
	   One option was for parliament to declare a state of emergency _
a step which would lead to a general mobilization of all
military-aged men. But the parliament voted to introduce the
measure ``when the first bomb drops on our territory.''
	   Parliament also adopted ``emergency financing'' of the army
because of the NATO threats. It calls for the increase of the sales
tax between 0.6 percent to 4 percent.
	   In an attempt to head off NATO action, Bulatovic said the
government had accepted a Russian proposal for the 54-nation
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to investigate
the crisis.
	   Yugoslavia had repeatedly rejected such a mission to Kosovo
until Yugoslav membership in the organization is restored.
	   The prime minister also said there was no longer any fighting in
Kosovo, where Albanian represent 90 percent of the 2-million
population. He said five of the 10 special police units had been
removed from Kosovo and the others had been returned to barracks in
the province.
	   Holbrooke made clear that half-measures would not be enough to
satisfy Washington and prevent a NATO attack.
	   ``While the level of fighting may have abated temporarily, the
capacity for its resumption is there,'' Holbrooke said after
meeting Solana and the Supreme Allied Commander Europe, Gen. Wesley
K. Clark.
	   German Gen. Dieter Stoeckmann told German Radio that air attacks
could be only days away.
	   The guns were largely silent in Kosovo Monday.
	   Diplomats in Kosovo said they have observed an informal
cease-fire since last Thursday and were not aware of any aggressive
operations by government forces against ethnic Albanians or the
rebel Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   One diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there
has been a significant redeployment of Yugoslav army troops out of
Kosovo to other parts of Serbia, including a mechanized brigade
that pulled out on Sunday.
	   Some army units remain in the field, and there is enormous fear
among the people that the violence will resume, particularly among
tens of thousands of refugees -- many of whom are living in the
hills and forests without shelter.
	   Meanwhile, the head of Yugoslavia's other republic, Montenegro,
called on Milosevic to accept all international demands and avert a
NATO attack.
	   ``We have to avert a clash with the whole world, the
confrontation which we are bound to lose,'' Montenegro's
pro-Western president, Milo Djukanovic, said in a statement.

Azerbaijan accuses Armenian soldiers of firing at its territory
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) _ Azerbaijan accused Armenian soldiers on
Monday of firing shots into an Azerbaijani enclave located inside
Armenia.
	   The shots were fired late Sunday and early Monday into the
Nakhichevan autonomous region, which is part of Azerbaijan but
separated from it by Armenia, the Azerbaijani Defense Ministry
said.
	   No one was injured, it said.
	   Nakhichevan is a periodic flashpoint between Muslim Azerbaijan
and Christian Armenia. The enclave also borders Iran and Turkey.
	   There was no immediate comment from Armenia.

Lebanon denies sheltering Kurdish rebels, backs Syria

leaders sending messages of support to Syria in last two grafs. &QL; 
 &UR; By HUSSEIN DAKROUB &QC;

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanon on Monday denied it is harboring
Kurdish rebels and blamed Israel for the rising tension between
Syria and Turkey.
	   President Elias Hrawi traveled to Damascus Monday for a summit
meeting with President Hafez Assad to show Lebanon's support for
Syria. He called for a ``diplomatic dialogue'' to defuse the
tension, said Assad's spokesman Jubran Kourieh.
	   Prime Minister Rafik Hariri said his country backs Syria in the
dispute which was triggered Sunday when Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel warned Damascus that his country would not allow its
neighbor to continue sheltering Kurdish rebels. Syria denied the
allegation.
	   Ankara has sent troops to its border with Syria, prompting fears
of an attack. The Turkish daily Milliyet speculated Sunday hat
Turkey could stage pinpoint attacks in the Syrian-controlled Bekaa
Valley of eastern Lebanon, where Turkey says rebels of Abdullah
Ocalan's Kurdish Workers Party, or PKK, maintain camps.
	   Lebanese Foreign Minister Faris Bweiz said Monday there were no
Kurdish rebels based in his country.
	   ``The Turkish authorities fully know that measures had been
taken in Syria and Lebanon more than 1 1/2 years ago to stop the
activities of any PKK member,'' Bweiz told a news conference.
	   Ocalan in recent years was believed to shuttle between the Bekaa
Valley and neighboring Syria.
	   ``We stand by Syria's side, especially in its call for resolving
disputes with Turkey in the framework of a peaceful dialogue,''
Hariri said in an interview with An-Nahar daily.
	   He said Turkey's military moves were the product of its newly
forged military alliance with Israel.
	   ``The Turkish threats are the first outcome of the
Turkish-Israeli strategic alliance,'' Hariri was quoted as saying.
	   The Lebanese press also accused Israel of inflaming the
tensions.
	   ``It is brilliant Israeli intelligence versus absolute Turkish
folly,'' wrote Talal Salman, publisher of the leftist newspaper
As-Safir.
	   Meanwhile, Syria's Assad received messages of support from Saudi
Crown Prince Abdullah bin Abdel-Aziz and from the leaders of Yemen
and Sudan, said Syria's official news agency, SANA.
	   The Arab leaders called for diplomatic solution to the crisis.

Leeward Islands to play United States in Red Stripe cricket opener
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Title holders Leeward Islands will
begin the defense of their Red Stripe Bowl cricket crown in
Kingston, Jamaica Tuesday with a match against newcomers the United
States.
	   The game marks the beginning of the regional one-day cricket
tournament season.
	   The Leewards squad boasts several members of the powerhouse West
Indies team, including fastbowlers Curtley Ambrose and Kenneth
Benjamin.
	   They are heavily favored over the U.S. team, which is stocked
with many Caribbean expatriates, but Leewards manager Carlisle
Powell said the team is not taking the underdog lightly.
	   ``Every match match for us is serious,'' Powell said.
	   The Leewards, United States, Jamaica and Barbados will contest
Group B of the Red Stripe Bowl. Last season's runners-up _ Guyana,
Trinidad and Tobago, the Windward Islands and Bermuda _ will fight
for Group A.
	   The top two teams in each group will meet in the semi-finals,
and the championship is scheduled for Oct. 19 in the northern
Jamaica city of Ocho Rios.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey's and Syria's neighbors sought
Monday to mediate a crisis that they feared could engulf the Middle
East in war, while Turkey said its armed forces were ready to act
against Syria should diplomacy fail.
	   Turkey accuses Syria of sheltering Kurdish rebels, allowing them
to keep battling Turkey from cross-border bases after largely being
neutralized on their home turf.
	   ``We are a country that loves peace,'' said Gen. Ilhan Kilic,
chief of the air force. ``But we do not let our national interests
get harmed.''
	   President Suleyman Demirel echoed the peaceful part of the
general's message. ``We want no war,'' he said.
	   Demirel and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak are to hold talks
Tuesday in Ankara to seek a solution to the crisis. Mubarak talked
with his Syrian counterpart, Hafez Assad, in Damascus on Sunday.
	   Relations between Turkey and Syria have always been troublesome.
Damascus is uneasy with Ankara's plans to build dams on the
Euphrates River, a key source of water for Syria, while Turkey
accuses Damascus of having designs on a Turkish border province,
Hatay, which has a sizable Arab population.
	   Syria also feels threatened by the bolstering military and
diplomatic ties between Turkey and Israel.
	   But Turkey has rarely used such harsh rhetoric against Damascus.
Turkey's tough stance against Syria appears part of a push to end a
14-year-old Kurdish insurgency that has killed 37,000 people.
	   The Turkish army has been relatively successful in fighting the
autonomy-seeking rebels in southeastern Turkey, forcing them into
neighboring Iraq. It has also carried out frequent incursions into
northern Iraq.
	   It has not been able to eradicate the rebels, however. According
to Murat Karayalcin, head of the Parliament's foreign relations
commission, the source of the problem lies in Syria.
	   ``It is extremely difficult to reach success against terrorism
as long as it is nourished by a neighboring country,'' Karayalcin
said, referring to Syria.
	   Cengiz Candar, a commentator for Turkey's Sabah daily, said any
military move by Turkey would trigger a chain-reaction in the Arab
world because of Turkey's close relationship with Israel.
	   ``All Arab countries will mobilize along with Syria,'' Candar
wrote on Monday.
	   With Egypt, Iran and Jordan have offered to mediate in the
crisis.
	   Although Turkish newspapers reported increased military activity
along the border, there was no footage of such a reinforcement on
news broadcasts, which were limited to interviews with Turkish
truckers at the Syrian border. They reported minimal military
activity on the Syrian side.
	   Seyfi Tashan, head of the Ankara-based Foreign Diplomacy
Institute, noted Turkey's get-tough decision coincided with the
recent U.S. airstrikes against suspected terrorism camps.
	   ``The U.S. attacks on suspected terrorist targets in Sudan and
Afghanistan have become an example for Turkey,'' Tashan told The
Associated Press.
	   A military officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Turkey has the capability to stage pinpoint air raids in the
Syrian-controlled Bekaa valley of Lebanon, where it reports rebel
camps.
	   Lebanon denied that it is harboring the rebels and President
Elias Hrawi traveled to Damascus on Monday in a show of support for
Syria.
	   The officer claimed that Syria was giving both financial and
military support to the rebels, but said it refused to allow them
to set up bases on its territory.

NATO planes ready to strike within hours of political decision

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ If last-ditch diplomatic efforts fail
to resolve the Kosovo crisis, NATO's military will be ready to
launch airraids against the Serbs within hours of receiving the
order to attack, officials said Monday.
	   If the order comes, a senior NATO military official said a first
strike would be launched to ``make a strong statement of resolve by
forceful means.''
	   If that fails, the alliance could unleash a ``fully fledged air
campaign'' involving hundreds of planes which risked imposing ``the
hardship of war'' on the Serbian people, said the official speaking
on condition of anonymity.
	   NATO said a decision on whether to strike was close, and that
much depended on talks in Belgrade between Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke.
	   ``Mr. Holbrooke will tell Milosevic that the resolution of the
U.N. Security Council is there to be complied with. If not, he
knows that NATO is prepared to act,'' said NATO Secretary General
Javier Solana after meeting Holbrooke at NATO's headquarters.
	   NATO top commander in Europe, U.S. Gen. Wesley K. Clark, said
that, once given the green light, the military would act swiftly.
``NATO action, should a political decision be taken, could come in
a matter of hours and days,'' he told reporters.
	   However, the 16 NATO nations remained divided over whether to
launch air strikes without a specific U.N. mandate. The United
States and Britain say NATO has all the authority it needs to
strike, other European allies are wavering.
	   In a report NATO officials said would be an important benchmark
in determining the international response, U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said he could not verify whether Milosevic was
complying, but he said Yugoslav forces had stepped up attacks on
ethnic Albanians following the U.N. resolution.
	   Solana said Milosevic had not complied with the U.N. resolution
demanding an end to hostilities and the senior official at NATO
military headquarters outside the southern Belgian city of Mons
said a ``substantial'' Serbian security presence remained in Kosovo
despite the return of some units to garrison.
	   For security reasons, NATO officials are refusing to release
full details of the air force the 16 alliance nations are preparing
for possible raids or say exactly which targets would be hit.
	   To make the skies over Yugoslavia safe for NATO pilots,
Yugoslavia's anti-aircraft missiles sites, air bases and radar
stations would would likely be among the early targets.
	   The NATO military official said the alliance had ``a great deal
of respect'' for the Yugoslav air-defense system but that NATO
hardware superiority was overwhelming.
	   ``It's useful to view a heavily armed enemy with respect,'' he
said. ``On the other hand this is NATO.'' He stressed NATO targets
were not limited to Kosovo. ``There should be no assumption of
sanctuary anywhere (in Yugoslavia),'' he told reporters.
	   The official brushed aside Serb threats of reprisals against the
NATO-led troops keeping the peace in Bosnia, saying they ``are
fully capable of defending themselves. If threatened they will take
the appropriate response.''
	   He said NATO's military was studying options for sending ground
troops to Kosovo to monitor an eventual truce, but said it was
``premature'' to talk about the content or mission of such a force.

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) - With NATO attacks said to be only
days away, a top U.S. envoy arrived Monday with an 11th-hour
warning to Slobodan Milosevic to comply with international demands
to halt his crackdown in Kosovo or face airstrikes.
	   Richard Holbrooke began his meeting with the Yugoslav president
Monday evening after arriving from Brussels, Belgium, where he
conferred with senior NATO officials.
	   In Brussels, Holbrooke said the situation in the southern
Serbian province was as bad now as two weeks ago when the Alliance
started finalizing airstrike plans to force Milosevic to halt his
crackdown against Kosovo Albanian separatists.
	   Holbrooke said he planned to drive home to Milosevic ``the
extreme gravity of the situation.'' Holbrooke negotiated the Bosnia
peace deal with Milosevic in 1995.
	   In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said ``systematic
terror'' had been inflicted on Kosovo civilians within recent days
and that Yugoslav forces were mostly responsible.
	   But Annan said he did not ``have the means necessary to provide
an independent assessment of compliance as required by the Security
Council'' and suggested the 15 members may want to make their ``own
judgment in this respect.''
	   NATO members had been waiting for Annan's report to determine
whether they would take military action against Milosevic's forces.
	   Nevertheless, State Department spokesman James Foley said Monday
the United States believed that Milosevic had not met the
conditions laid down by the Security Council.
	   Foley cited the absence of a formal cease-fire, the failure to
arrange a meaningful dialogue with Kosovo Albanian leaders and
restrictions on the return of refugees and the work of
international monitors in the province.
	   He also noted the continued presence of ``major army units'' in
southeastern Kosovo near the Albanian border. Foley urged Milosevic
to take ``strategic, definitive and irreversible'' steps toward
peace.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbia's government denounced
foreign and independent media Monday for their coverage of the
Kosovo crisis and threatened unspecified punishment for those who
transmit ``lies.''
	   The attack came as Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia,
faces a possibility of a NATO intervention in the southern Kosovo
province. The government has accused independent and foreign media
of fabricating reports about Kosovo in order to provoke NATO
intervention.
	   ``Western media have manipulated their own public using numerous
fabrications and lies about the situation in Kosovo,'' the Serbian
information minister, Aleksandar Vucic, told parliament.
	   The attacks appeared in response to reports last week that Serb
police massacred dozens of ethnic Albanian civilians. Police have
denied responsibility.
	   Vucic said a number of foreign news organizations ``lied so that
the use of (NATO) force would gain legal basis.''
	   During the parliament session, Serbian Deputy Premier Vojislav
Seselj warned that ``those who serve the West in conducting the
propaganda war, must know that they will be held criminally
responsible.''
	   ``They spread lies and fabrications. Whoever is helping them
will bear consequences,'' said Seselj. ``We must not tolerate
internal subversion.''
	   Some independent radio and television stations in Serbia
received a written warning from the information ministry to stop
broadcasting Serbian-language programs by Western media, or face
``punishment.''
	   The ministry said ``it would not tolerate any kind of subversive
activity and undermining of the combat readiness of the country,''
Beta news agency quoted the statement as saying.
	   The fledgling independent media in Serb-dominated Yugoslavia
have been subjected to government pressure for years.
	   Control over the media has been one of the key elements of
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's decade-long rule. However,
Milosevic so far has failed to fully silence the independent media.
	   The Association of Independent Electronic media said in a
statement that NATO attacks on Serbia would be ``wrong and
politically damaging'' because they would give Milosevic an alibi
to silence opponents at home.
	   ``Independent media in Yugoslavia will most probably face
pressure and challenge characteristic of totalitarian regimes in
war time,'' said the statement. ``Most probably a massive closure
and ban of these media and additional state censorship will
follow.''

Inquiry probes Canadian police crackdown on protesters
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) _ With the credibility of
Canada's prime minister and national police force at stake, an
inquiry commission opened hearings Monday into the suppression of
student protests at an Asia-Pacific summit last year.
	   The central questions are whether Royal Canadian Mounted Police
officers violated the protesters' rights to free speech, and
whether the officers were under orders from the prime minister's
office to quash protests that might embarrass Indonesia's
authoritarian leader, Suharto.
	   The inquiry is being conducted by the RCMP's Public Complaints
Commission, an independent panel which investigates cases of
alleged wrongdoing by the Mounties.
	   The panel held a brief procedural session last month, but Monday
marked the formal start of the hearings, which are expected to last
several weeks. More than 100 witnesses will testify, including two
men who were top aides to Prime Minister Jean Chretien when the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit took place in Vancouver
last November.
	   ``we will go wherever the evidence from witnesses leads us,''
said the inquiry chairman, Gerald Morin. ``These are grave matters
which strike at the heart of who we are as Canadians.''
	   During the APEC summit, hundreds of protesters demonstrated at
the University of British Columbia to oppose a meeting on campus of
18 Asia-Pacific leaders. Suharto _ who was ousted from office
earlier this year _ was the principal target because of his
questionable record on human rights.
	   Some demonstrators were pepper-sprayed by police. Dozens were
arrested and some strip-searched during detention, yet no one was
prosecuted.
	   Over the past several months, numerous documents related to the
case have been leaked to the media _ many suggesting that
Chretien's office asked the Mounties to contain the protests. A key
question is whether such directives were prompted by legitimate
security concerns or by a desire to spare Suharto embarrassment.
	   Other police documents indicate that several of Suharto's
personal security guards were allowed to carry guns while in
Vancouver, and that five of them were arrested by the Mounties for
breaching security arrangements.
	   The case has became a potentially serious embarrassment for
Chretien. Opposition parties in Parliament have accused him of
trying to duck responsibility for the crackdown, though he insists
he never gave instructions to police.
	   The protesters want Chretien to be subpoenaed by the inquiry
commission. The commission's lawyer has not ruled this out, saying
a decision will be made later.

	   BILBAO, Spain (AP) _ The recent cease-fire by Basque gunmen
provides a prime opportunity to resolve Spain's conflict and the
international community, particularly the United States, has a duty
to help bring about a resolution, Irish republican leader Gerry
Adams said Monday.
	   ``Powerful nations have a duty to assist, and clearly the United
States is the most powerful,'' said Adams, who heads the Sinn Fein
party, linked with the Irish Republican Army.
	   ``We would be calling on the international community to assist
in every situation, but especially one like the Basque country
where an initiative has been taken,'' Adams said shortly after
arriving in the northern Basque town of Bilbao.
	   A group of Basque political parties seeking a Basque homeland
handed Adams a proposal for all-party peace talks. The group, known
as the Irish Forum, claimed inspiration from the Northern Ireland
peace process and its success in opening the door for a political
settlement in the troubled British province.
	   ``I am very pleased to be here and to be in anyway helpful in
your search for peace,'' Adams said as he was presented the
proposal, known as the Lizarra Declaration. It has been credited
with encouraging the armed Basque separatist group ETA to call its
indefinite cease-fire.
	   The forum wants Adams to pass along its proposal to U.S.
President Bill Clinton when the two meet this month. Adams
described Clinton's input into Northern Irish peace process as
``crucial and pivotal.''

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A collection of period jewelry _ including the
celebrated Bird of Paradise brooch _ went on display in London on
Monday ahead of a planned sale by Sotheby's auction house.
	   The brooch, created by Van Cleef and Arpels in 1942, has been
heralded as one of the most famous bird ornaments in the history of
jewelry, Sotheby's said. The bird's tail and wings are set with
rubies and sapphires and its beak with diamonds. The bird's eye is
a ruby, and its plumage is tipped in gold. The piece is expected to
fetch dlrs 95,000.
	   The entire Birds of Paradise collection, comprising 73 items, is
expected to sell for dlrs 7 million when it goes under the hammer
in Geneva on Nov. 19.
	   Other items in the collection include an emerald and diamond
necklace worth about dlrs 150,000 and a wide-band bracelet
decorated with rubies and diamonds expected to fetch dlrs 150,000.
	   ''The Bird of Paradise collection is one of the most important
to appear at auction since the war and compares in quality and
design with other celebrated period collections,''' said David
Bennett, chairman of Sotheby's Switzerland and director of
international jewels in Europe.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan reported
Monday that Yugoslav forces increased their attacks on Kosovo's
ethnic Albanians after a U.N. resolution demanded a cease-fire and
that special police units are still on the ground.
	   In a widely anticipated report to the Security Council, Annan
listed apparent violations of a Sept. 23 U.N. resolution but said
he couldn't give an independent assessment of whether Serb forces
had complied with the council's demands.
	   NATO countries had been awaiting the U.N. chief's report to
determine whether to use military force to stop the offensive on
ethnic Albanians who are seeking independence from Yugoslavia.
	   Despite Annan's unwillingness to declare Serb noncompliance,
NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana and the United States
proclaimed he had said enough in reporting that Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic still had special units on the ground and hadn't
allowed an estimated 275,000 refugees to return to their homes.
	   ``We think it's a very strong report that makes clear Milosevic
has not complied with all relevant provisions of the Security
Council resolution,'' U.S. State Department spokesman James P.
Rubin told reporters.
	   NATO's supreme allied commander for Europe, Gen. Wesley K.
Clark, said action could come in a matter of hours and days once a
political decision had been reached.
	   The 15-member council was expected to take up the report
Tuesday.
	   In its Sept. 23 resolution, the council demanded an immediate
end to the fighting that has left hundreds of people _ mostly
ethnic Albanian civilians _ dead and uprooted 275,000 since a Serb
crackdown began in February. Most ethnic Albanians want
independence for the province, which Milosevic stripped of its
autonomy in 1989.
	   In its resolution, the council demanded Milosevic withdraw his
special forces from the province and allow for the safe return of
refugees and for humanitarian access to them. It demanded both
sides work toward finding a political solution.
	   In Monday's report, Annan reported that in the week following
the Sept. 23 resolution, government security forces ``intensified
their operations, launching another offensive in the Drenica
region,'' and elsewhere.
	   Fighting continued Sept. 28-29 despite the Serb prime minister's
statement that Serb operations had ended and peace reigned in
Kosovo, Annan said.
	   As a result, another 20,000 people were reportedly displaced, he
said.
	   While fighting began to wind down in the last days of September,
with troops returning to their barracks and a limited number of
police units being withdrawn, the United Nations has received
information ``that the government's armed presence remains
significant and that the operations of the special police
continue,'' Annan wrote.
	   In his report, Annan decried the ``appalling atrocities in
Kosovo,'' and said it was ``clear beyond any reasonable doubt''
that Yugoslav forces were responsible for the bulk of them.
	   Ethnic Albanian forces also have been fighting, he said, adding
that there was reason to believe that they were responsible for
atrocities as well.
	   The U.N. chief said he couldn't give the council a clear-cut,
independent assessment of compliance with the Sept. 23 resolution
because the United Nations doesn't have the people on the ground in
Kosovo to determine that. He noted his report was based on
information provided by the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, the European Union, NATO and individual
states.
	   ``Therefore, the council may wish to make its own judgment in
this respect on the basis of the present report,'' he said,
referring to Serb compliance.
	   Annan said he was outraged by recent reports of mass killings of
civilians in Kosovo _ reports which galvanized international
threats to intervene with military force.
	   Annan recounted two reported massacres _ in Obrinje, in central
Drenica on Sept. 28, in which 20 ethnic Albanians were killed, some
severely mutilated. Most were children and women, aged 18 months to
95 years. A day earlier in Golubovac, 12 to 23 males were summarily
executed, he said.

Canadian company denies supplying eight reactors to India
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Canadian company that manufactures CANDU
nuclear power reactors says it supplied one of the heavy water
reactors to India and halted construction on a second after India
detonated a nuclear device in 1974.
	   Atomic Energy of Canada Limited took issue with a report in the
October issue of Jane's Intelligence Review that said eight of
India's 10 nuclear power reactors are CANDUs.
	   India completed the second Canadian reactor on its own in 1981
and built additional heavy water reactors with different features,
the company said.
	   Larry Shewchuk, manager of media relations at Atomic Energy of
Canada Limited, said the safety shutdown system and radiation
containment structures of the Indian-built reactors ``are vastly
different than those of the CANDU design.''
	   T.S. Gopi Rethinaraj, a science writer based in Bombay who
writes for Jane's on nuclear issues, said two reactors at Madras,
two at Narora and two at Kakrapar, ``were done indigenously but
were all based on the basic CANDU design which uses natural uranium
as fuel and heavy water as moderator.''
	   Peter Felsted, editor of Jane's Intelligence Review, said the
London-based magazine stands by the story ``that they are
CANDU-type reactors.''
	   ``They may have been stored in slightly different buildings.
They may have changed the safety measures, but it's essentially the
same type of reactor as supplied by Canada, indigenously built,''
he said.
	   The Jane's report on nuclear reactor performance indicated that
India is now capable of producing 455 atomic bombs and Pakistan can
build 105 nuclear weapons.

NBA cancels preseason games
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The NBA canceled the final 90 preseason games
Monday because of stalled labor negotiations with the players
union.
	   ``At this point, our teams cannot possibly be ready to play any
games before November,'' deputy commissioner Russ Granik said in a
statement. ``It's sad that we have been unable to have any
meaningful negotiations.''
	   The next collective bargaining session is set for Oct. 8. The
league said decisions concerning possible cancellation of
regular-season games would be made next week.
	   The league earlier had canceled 24 games.
	   Union officials had no immediate response to the decision.
	   When they finally meet again, the sides will have only a few
days to strike a deal that would preserve the 82-game regular
season schedule which starts Nov. 3.
	   Once a new agreement is reached, it will take at least three
weeks to sign players, make trades and hold abbreviated training
camps.
	   But a quick settlement seems extremely unlikely with the parties
so far apart on the main economic issue.
	   The owners made their latest proposal 10 days ago, still calling
for a system with an absolute ceiling on salaries _ or a ``hard''
salary cap. The union said the owners included 16 pages of new
demands that hadn't been discussed in any previous meetings.
	   ``Our proposals would result in an average player salary of more
than dlrs 3.1 million and a minimum salary for 10-year veterans of
dlrs 750,000,'' Granik said. ``Unfortunately, the union leadership
has been unwilling to give any serious consideration to what we
have offered.''
	   Both sides await a ruling from arbitrator John Feerick on the
union's grievance over whether players with guaranteed contracts
should be paid during the lockout. Feerick's decision could come at
any time before Oct. 19.

Italian premier struggles to save government
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout with Prodi quoted as saying he hopes to
survive politically through splits in communist bloc. &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Premier Romano Prodi said Monday he would appeal
directly to Parliament to save Italy's second-longest-serving
government since World War II, threatened with collapse by the
defection of its Communist ally.
	   The address to Parliament was expected Wednesday, followed
perhaps by Friday by the vote of confidence that will determine
whether Prodi's 2 1/2-year-old, center-left alliance stands or
falls.
	   Prodi's far-left ally, the Communist Refoundation Party,
provoked the crisis by withdrawing its support over the weekend and
saying it would not vote for his deficit-cutting 1999 budget, which
is key to Italy's participation in the European common currency.
	   Prodi has said he would call a confidence vote if he lost the
Communists' support.
	   ``I've always acted with coherence,'' Prodi said before a
morning meeting with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro on the
emergency. ``I've never changed strategy and I don't want to do
political gymnastics.''
	   The break with Prodi's government divided Refoundation. Armando
Cossutta, leader of the moderate wing, resigned as party president
Monday.
	   He said the party's desertion of Prodi was ``wrong and
dangerous,'' but at the same time promised to follow the party
line.
	   ``We are in a very complicated political crisis which could lead
to early elections,'' Cossutta told reporters Monday. ``And with
the divisions in the left, this would mean a victory for the
right.''
	   Prodi discussed the crisis later Monday at a summit with French
Premier Lionel Jospin in Florence, making clear he hoped to survive
politically by ``playing on divisions and divergences within
Communist Refoundation,'' a senior French aide said. The aide spoke
on condition of anonymity.
	   If the crisis does comes to a confidence vote and Prodi loses,
he would offer his resignation. Once he does that, it is up to
Scalfaro to decide what to do. He could ask Prodi or someone else
to form a new government or he could call elections 2 1/2 years
early, something most analysts think unlikely.
	   Working in Prodi's favor is the fact that few parties think they
would stand to gain by early elections, including the Communist
Refoundation. There was speculation Prodi would reopen negotiations
that would win back the communists' grudging support, as he has
managed to do in the past.
	   Prodi's government has held together this long in large part
because of the widely shared desire to see Italy qualify for
participation in the 1999 debut of Europe's common currency, the
euro. That happened earlier this year _ leaving the disparate
allies without so clear a reason to stay together.
	   Prodi leads Italy's 55th government since World War II. He has
outlasted all but Bettino Craxi, who served 3{ years in two
back-to-back stints from 1983 to 1987.
	   Refoundation is not part of Prodi's center-left coalition, but
the government needs its 34 votes to muster a majority in the lower
house. It has been a difficult ally from the outset.
	   It broke with Prodi over NATO expansion earlier this year and on
sending troops into Albania last year. Prodi was even forced to
resign a year ago after a bitter battle over spending cuts linked
to the euro. The crisis was resolved, and Prodi returned to work,
after he made steep concessions and promised a 35-hour work week.

Ghosts of Communists haunt another French-Italian meeting

 &UR; EDS: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with comments on Chirac-Prodi,
Jospin-Prodi talks on Kosovo, Italian political crisis; EDITS to
TRIM. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   FLORENCE, Italy (AP) _ Premier Romano Prodi briefed French
Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin on Monday on his plans to
survive in office despite a key ally's rebellion.
	   For a second straight year, the ghost of Italian Communists
haunted a summit between Rome and Paris.
	   Last year, the annual top-level bilateral talks, then held in
Chambery, France, came as Communist unhappiness over Prodi's
planned budget cuts forced the premier to offer his resignation.
	   This year, the crisis is worse. On Sunday, the leadership of
Italy's Communists, who give Prodi's center-left Olive Tree
coalition a majority in the lower Chamber of Deputies, voted to
yank support for the government and to veto the latest budget
proposal.
	   Prodi appeared headed for a confidence vote this week. A loss
could lead to early elections or a reshuffled Cabinet.
	   But Prodi appeared confident he had a fighting chance at winning
the vote, said a senior French advisor, briefing reporters on
condition of anonymity about the premier's pre-dinner talks with
Jospin.
	   The aide said Prodi was counting on defections from the
Communist Refoundation party to help him get close to a Chamber
majority. The other needed votes would presumably come from
centrists now in the opposition.
	   In 1997, Prodi wooed back the Communists by embracing Jospin's
push for a 35-hour work week, a key demand by Italian Communist
leader Fausto Bertinotti, who also provoked the latest crisis.
	   This year's talks began about a half-hour late Monday evening,
as sometimes driving rain slowed the arrival of some of the French
being driven to Renaissance-era Pitti Palace near the Arno River.
	   More talks are set for Tuesday. Among the topics were possible
NATO intervention in Kosovo and how to better coordinate policy
among France, Italy and Germany.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ With NATO attacks said to be only
days away, a top U.S. envoy arrived Monday with a last-minute
warning to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to comply with
international demands to halt his crackdown in Kosovo or face
airstrikes.
	   Richard Holbrooke began his meeting with Milosevic Monday
evening after arriving from Brussels, Belgium, where he conferred
with senior NATO officials.
	   In Brussels, Holbrooke said the situation in the southern
Serbian province was as bad now as two weeks ago when the alliance
started finalizing airstrike plans to force Milosevic to halt his
crackdown against Kosovo Albanian separatists.
	   Holbrooke said he planned to impress upon Milosevic ``the
extreme gravity of the situation.'' Holbrooke negotiated the Bosnia
peace deal with Milosevic in 1995.
	   In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said ``systematic
terror'' had been inflicted on Kosovo civilians within recent days
and that Yugoslav forces were mostly responsible.
	   But, Annan said, he did not ``have the means necessary to
provide an independent assessment of compliance as required by the
Security Council'' and suggested the 15 members may want to make
their ``own judgment in this respect.''
	   NATO members had been waiting for Annan's report to determine
whether they would take military action against Milosevic's forces.
	   Nevertheless, U.S. State Department spokesman James Foley said
Monday that the United States believed that Milosevic had not met
the conditions laid down by the Security Council.
	   Foley cited the absence of a formal cease-fire, the failure to
arrange a meaningful dialogue with Kosovo Albanian leaders and
restrictions on the return of refugees and the work of
international monitors in the province.
	   He also noted the continued presence of ``major army units'' in
southeastern Kosovo near the Albanian border. Foley urged Milosevic
to take ``strategic, definitive and irreversible'' steps toward
peace.
	   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana also said in Brussels that
the alliance believed Yugoslavia had not yet met the conditions
demanded by the U.N. Security Council.
	   ``The reality coming to us is that the compliance is not yet in
place,'' Solana said. ``As far as we are concerned, once again, I
can tell you we are ready.''
	   Meanwhile, Yugoslavia's prime minister told an emergency session
of parliament Monday that the country ``is faced with the imminent
danger of war.'' Yugoslavia is composed of dominant Serbia and
smaller Montenegro.
	   ``The threats are serious,'' Prime Minister Momir Bulatovic
said. ``Yugoslavia has to defend itself if it was attacked.''
	   One option available to the parliament was to declare a state of
emergency _ a step that would lead to a general mobilization of all
military-aged men. But the parliament voted to introduce the
measure ``when the first bomb drops on our territory.'' Parliament
also called for the increase of the sales tax to provide emergency
financing of the army because of the NATO threats.
	   In an attempt to head off NATO action, Bulatovic said the
government had accepted a Russian proposal for the 54-nation
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to investigate
the crisis.
	   Yugoslavia had repeatedly rejected such a mission to Kosovo
until Yugoslav membership in the organization is restored.
	   The prime minister also said there was no longer any fighting in
Kosovo, where Albanians represent 90 percent of the 2-million
population. He said five of the 10 special police units had been
removed from Kosovo and the others had been returned to barracks in
the province.
	   Holbrooke made clear that half-measures would not be enough to
satisfy Washington and prevent a NATO attack.
	   ``While the level of fighting may have abated temporarily, the
capacity for its resumption is there,'' Holbrooke said after
meeting Solana and the Supreme Allied Commander Europe, Gen. Wesley
K. Clark.
	   The European Union nations were divided Monday on whether to
launch air strikes without U.N. Security Council backing.
	   The EU foreign ministers, meeting in Luxembourg, agreed to
tighten economic sanctions against Milosevic, but it was unlikely
that stricter travel curbs for Yugoslav officials and freezing more
Yugoslav assets abroad would be anything more than symbolic.
	   German Gen. Dieter Stoeckmann told German Radio that air attacks
could be only days away.
	   The guns were largely silent in Kosovo Monday.
	   Diplomats in Kosovo said they have observed an informal
cease-fire since last Thursday and were not aware of any aggressive
operations by government forces against ethnic Albanians or the
rebel Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   One diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there
has been a significant redeployment of Yugoslav army troops out of
Kosovo to other parts of Serbia, including a mechanized brigade
that pulled out on Sunday.
	   Some army units remain in the field, and there is enormous fear
among the people that the violence will resume, particularly among
tens of thousands of refugees _ many of whom are living in the
hills and forests without shelter.
	   Meanwhile, the head of Yugoslavia's other republic, Montenegro,
called on Milosevic to accept all international demands and avert a
NATO attack.
	   ``We have to avert a clash with the whole world, the
confrontation which we are bound to lose,'' Montenegro's
pro-Western president, Milo Djukanovic, said in a statement.

Mubarak: bloodshed if Israeli-Palestinian talks fail
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ If the talks between Israel and the
Palestinians fail, there will be ``bloodshed for ever and ever,''
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said in an interview broadcast
Monday.
	   Appearing on Israel's Channel 2 television, Mubarak was asked
what would happen if the current negotiations on a second Israeli
withdrawal in the West Bank break down and the pull-back does not
take place.
	   ``There will be murders and killing ... for ever and ever,''
Mubarak replied, adding that he did not wish to go into details for
fear of setting off the bloodshed by incitement.
	   The Egyptian President rejected Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's demands that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat clamp
down on Islamic militants as a condition for the withdrawal. In
Mubarak's view Netanyahu was using security as an excuse for not
honoring Israel's commitments in the Oslo accords with the
Palestinians.
	   ``There will be no security for the people of Israel and the
Palestinian people unless you give them the land and get out of
it,'' he said. ``Hand over the land to the Palestinians and that
will be the best guarantee of the security of the Israeli
citizen.''
	   Mubarak said he has no trust in Netanyahu, and accused him of
breaking Israel's commitments in the peace process. ``From the day
Netanyahu was elected and until today, nothing has been
implemented. The peace process has stopped,'' the Egyptian leader
said.
	   The interview was broadcast as US Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright was on her way to Israel in an attempt to bridge the gap
between the Israeli and Palestinian positions.
	   If she succeeds, a tripartite summit of President Bill Clinton,
Arafat and Netanyahu may be held at Camp David, Maryland, to clinch
the deal.

Austerity measures to test real strength of Cardoso's popularity

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ The first Brazilian president to ever
win re-election, Fernando Henrique Cardoso must now put his
popularity through an even tougher test _ harsh austerity measures
needed to break Brazil's economic meltdown.
	   Cardoso inched closer Monday to a first-ballot victory as
returns came in from the interior, where the government
historically does well. Cardoso must win more than half the vote in
Sunday's election to avoid a second-round runoff _ a feat he is
expected to easily accomplish.
	   But a tougher task lies ahead: to rein in the international
financial crisis that began in Asia and now threatens his country,
the newly reelected Cardoso is expected to slash government
spending and may increase taxes.
	   With 61 percent of the ballots counted Monday, Cardoso was
leading with 51 percent. His closest rival, Luiz Inacio Lula da
Silva of the leftist Workers Party had 34.2 percent, while Ciro
Gomes of the Popular Socialist Party had 11 percent. Nine other
candidates shared the rest.
	   A Cardoso victory was no surprise to the 106 million Brazilians
who voted for president, 27 governors, all 513 federal deputies,
one-third of the 81-seat Senate and 1,405 state legislators.
Cardoso had been the front-runner for the entire campaign.
	   To most observers, Cardoso has received a clear mandate not only
to run Latin America's largest nation for the next four years, but
also to protect its economy from the financial turmoil rocking
emerging countries, including Brazil.
	   ``In re-electing Cardoso, voters clearly demonstrated their
confidence in his political leadership and his ability to steer
Brazil through the world financial crisis,'' said Carlos Esteban
Martins, a political scientist at the University of Sao Paulo.
	   ``Voters showed they were unwilling to rock the boat with a
change in leadership,'' Martins added. ``Cardoso has shown during
his four years in office that he knows exactly where he wants to go
and that he is unwilling to change course, and this was a message
voters wanted to hear.''
	   Cardoso's popularity is largely the result of the success of the
``Real Plan'' _ the economic stabilization plan he helped put
together in 1994 when he was finance minister. It dropped inflation
from around 2,400 percent a year to near zero now.
	   Since its introduction, the Real Plan has been shored up by high
interest rates and an overvalued real, the Brazilian currency.
Together, they guaranteed price stability, but caused recession,
unemployment and public and trade deficits.
	   And now, like other emerging markets, Brazil is suffering from a
loss of investor confidence and a strong outflow of capital. The
country's foreign reserves have fallen below dlrs 50 billion from
the dlrs 70 billion posted at the end of July.
	   To prevent a collapse of the real, and stem capital flight,
interest rates were hiked to 50 percent a year.
	   On the eve of the elections, Cardoso promised to tackle the
economy's main Achilles' heel _ a budget deficit equal to 7.3
percent of gross domestic product _ and hinted that taxes would be
increased.
	   It was exactly this kind of tough talk from the incumbent
president that voters wanted to hear, said Joaquim Eloy de Toledo,
an economist at the University of Sao Paulo.
	   ``The electorate approved his clear message that he would do all
in his power to guarantee the survival of the Real Plan and the
stability it brought to prices,'' he said.
	   But the president will have to move swiftly to implement
austerity measures, which have yet to be clearly defined.
	   ``As the population gets a better notion of the seriousness of
the crisis and the severity of the measures that will certainly be
adopted, Cardoso's popularity will erode,'' said Ricardo Ribeiro, a
Sao Paulo political consultant.
	   ``And if his popularity drops, so will his chances to get
Congress' approval for these measures,'' he added.
	   Alexandre Barros, a Brasilia-based political consultant agrees.
	   ``The measures have to adopted immediately, before the new
congressmen are sworn in,'' Barros said. ``The political price to
be paid for approving unpopular austerity measures is much lower
for an outgoing congressman.''

Cereal is children's No. 1 source of vitamins and minerals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Hold for release at 5 p.m. EDT (2100 GMT) &QL; 
 &UR; By LINDSEY TANNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ A U.S. government study found cold breakfast
cereal was the main source of key vitamins and minerals for
American children. And that's not necessarily a good thing.
	   Children may be eating fortified cereal in place of vitamin-rich
fruits and vegetables, which contain fiber and cancer-fighting
substances, said Amy Subar, a research nutritionist with the
National Cancer Institute.
	   Her findings were published Tuesday in the October issue of
Pediatrics, a journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics.
	   The findings show just how little of the foods with naturally
occurring nutrients kids are eating, she said.
	   Kellogg, the world's leading maker of ready-to-eat cereal, sees
the study as good news. ``It really does show the role cereal can
play in delivering important nutrients in kids diets,'' spokeswoman
Karen Kafer said.
	   Subar said cereal is not necessarily unhealthy. In fact,
fortified cereal appears to be among the more nutritious foods
children are eating.
	   ``We just shouldn't kid ourselves that they're necessarily
getting all that they need'' from cereal, she said.
	   The study of 4,008 children ages 2 through 18 looked at 20 foods
they ate between 1989 and 1991, and cereal was the No. 1 source of
vitamin A, iron and folic acid for every age. Folic acid has been
shown to reduce the risk of certain types of cancer.
	   Researchers also found that cereal was the third-highest source
of zinc and magnesium.
	   The researchers did not reach a conclusion on whether the
children were getting a nutritionally sound diet, but the findings
suggested their diets may be lacking.
	   For example, sugary drinks were the No. 2 source of
carbohydrates, behind bread. And high-fat foods such as cakes and
cookies ranked among youngsters' top 10 sources of vitamin E,
protein, fiber, calcium and iron.
	   Gail Frank, a California dietitian and spokeswoman for the
American Dietetic Association, said the findings were not
surprising but also not terribly worrisome. After all, she said, at
least the children weren't skipping breakfast or eating high-fat
fast food.
	   She said parents shouldn't discourage cereal eating but
encourage their youngsters to have it with, say, fruit on top or a
glass of juice.

Israel extends bockade of Palestinian areas
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's blockade of the Palestinian areas will
continue at least until Saturday, the army said Monday.
	   The West Bank and the Gaza Strip were sealed off Friday when
Israeli security services warned that the Islamic Hamas group
planned to carry out a major suicide bomb attack or kidnap an
Israeli soldier in retaliation for the killing of two of its
leaders by Israeli special forces.
	   As a result of the closure thousands of Palestinian workers have
been unable to reach their jobs in Israel.
	   Earlier reports implied that the closure would continue
throughout the Jewish festival of Sukkot which ends on Monday, but
the army said there would be a separate announcement regarding the
last two days.
	   Hamas is opposed to the Oslo agreements between Israel and the
Palestinians and has killed scores of Israelis in bombings and
other attacks since they were signed.

Italian premier struggles to save government
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with color on Prodi supporters;
Prodi quoted as saying he can muster 312 votes, short of what he
needs. No pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By ELLEN KNICKMEYER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Premier Romano Prodi said Monday he would appeal
directly to Parliament to save Italy's second-longest government
since World War II, threatened with collapse by the defection of
its Communist ally.
	   The address to Parliament was expected Wednesday, followed
perhaps by Friday by the vote of confidence that will determine
whether Prodi's 2 1/2-year-old, center-left alliance stands or
falls.
	   Prodi's far-left ally, the Communist Refoundation Party,
provoked the crisis by withdrawing its support over the weekend and
saying it would not vote for his deficit-cutting 1999 budget, which
is key to Italy's participation in the European common currency.
	   Prodi has said he would call a confidence vote if he lost the
Communists' support.
	   ``I've always acted with coherence,'' Prodi said before a
morning meeting with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro on the
emergency. ``I've never changed strategy and I don't want to do
political gymnastics.''
	   The break with Prodi's government divided Refoundation. Armando
Cossutta, leader of the moderate wing, resigned as party president
Monday.
	   He said the party's desertion of Prodi was ``wrong and
dangerous,'' but at the same time promised to follow the party
line.
	   ``We are in a very complicated political crisis which could lead
to early elections,'' Cossutta told reporters Monday. ``And with
the divisions in the left, this would mean a victory for the
right.''
	   Prodi discussed the crisis later Monday at a summit with French
Premier Lionel Jospin in Florence, making clear he hoped to survive
politically by ``playing on divisions and divergences within
Communist Refoundation,'' a senior French aide said. The aide spoke
on condition of anonymity.
	   ``Hang in there!'' a small crowd of supporters shouted to Prodi
outside Florence's Pitti Palace, where the French and Italian
leaders were meeting.
	   ``Why did you think I wouldn't?'' Prodi answered, going over to
shake their hands.
	   If the crisis does come to a confidence vote and Prodi loses, he
would offer his resignation. Once he does that, it is up to
Scalfaro to decide what to do. He could ask Prodi or someone else
to form a new government or he could call elections 2 1/2 years
early, something most analysts think unlikely.
	   Working in Prodi's favor is the fact that few parties think they
would stand to gain by early elections, including the Communist
Refoundation.
	   Prodi's government has held together this long in large part
because of the widely shared desire to see Italy qualify for the
1999 debut of Europe's common currency, the euro. It qualified
earlier this year _ leaving the disparate allies without so clear a
reason to stay together.
	   As it is, Prodi has outlasted all but Bettino Craxi, who served
3{ years in two back-to-back stints from 1983 to 1987. Prodi's is
Italy's 55th government since World War II.
	   Refoundation is not part of Prodi's center-left coalition, but
the government needs its 34 votes to muster a majority in the lower
house.
	   It has been a difficult ally from the outset. It broke with
Prodi over NATO expansion earlier this year and on sending troops
into Albania last year. Prodi was even forced to resign a year ago
after a bitter battle over spending cuts linked to the euro. The
crisis was resolved, and Prodi returned to work, after he made
steep concessions and promised a 35-hour work week.
	   In this latest crisis, Prodi figures he can muster 312 votes,
according to the French official's account of his conversation
Monday night. That leaves him still a few short of the majority he
needs in the 630-member Chamber of Deputies.

Sudan begins trial of 26 dissidents
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Amid tight security at a military base,
Sudan on Monday began the trial of 26 dissidents accused of
planning to set off bombs during a government celebration.
	   The defendants were charged with subversive activities and
inciting war against the state. If convicted, they could face the
death penalty.
	   The defendants, some of whom were southerners who could not
speak Arabic, are being tried in a military court in the Grand Air
Defense Hall in southern Khartoum.
	   They are accused of planting bombs in Khartoum in crowded areas,
power stations and under a bridge.
	   The bombs were scheduled to go off during the July celebrations
marking the ninth anniversary of the 1989 military coup that
overthrew the elected government and brought President Omar
el-Bashir to power. One bomb exploded, causing a fire at an oil
depot in Khartoum, but no casualties. The other eight were defused.
	   The defendants include Father Hilary Boma, 56, of St. Peter's
Church, Father Lino Sabit, of the Martyr's Church in southern
Khartoum, a southern Sudanese tribal chief, a Sudanese aid worker
and a retired soldier.
	   Six of the defendants are being tried in absentia.
	   Reporters at the trial said the defendants appeared to be in
good health after being in custody for three months, but added that
their clothes were torn and soiled. They said some of the
defendants appeared confused during the court's preliminary
hearings because they didn't understand Arabic. Many southerners
speak tribal dialects and not Arabic.
	   The case was adjourned until Oct. 12.
	   Southern rebels have been fighting since 1983 for more autonomy
for the south's Christians and animists from the Islamic north.

Government takes over bleeding savings and loan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Moving to stem a run by nervous
depositors, the Colombian government has bailed out and assumed
control over one of the country's largest financial institutions.
	   The injection of about dlrs 100 million (157 billion pesos) into
Granahorrar _ a savings-and-loan ranked last year as Colombia's
eight-largest financial entity _ reflected strains in the banking
system whose profits have been squeezed in recent months by stiff
hikes in interest rates.
	   The rate increases resulted from government efforts to defend
the peso, which has lost about 20 percent of its value this year
against the dollar.
	   News of financial problems at Granahorrar, which has 178 offices
in 39 cities, had prompted massive withdrawals by many of the
savings and loan's 1.6 million depositors.
	   The government assumed ``total control'' over the entity last
Saturday, after major stockholders failed to negotiate a private
sale of their shares.

Nine players taken in NHL waiver draft
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The expansion Nashville Predators took former
Edmonton center Zdeno Ciger with the first pick of the National
Hockey League waiver draft Monday.
	   Ciger, who played the last two seasons in his native Slovakia,
had 31 goals and 39 assists in his last NHL season (1995-96) with
the Oilers.
	   Tampa Bay selected Brent Gilchrist, a forward who helped the
Detroit Red Wings win a second straight Stanley Cup title, with the
second pick in the nine-player draft. The Lightning later traded
Gilchrist back to Detroit for a sixth-round pick in the 1999 entry
draft.
	   Gilchrist, entering his 11th NHL season, had 27 points (13
goals, 14 assists) in 61 games last season with Detroit. He is not
expected to play before early November because of a hernia injury.
	   The Anaheim Mighty Ducks, selecting third overall, took
defenseman Pascal Trepanier from the Colorado Avalanche. The
Chicago Blackhawks then selected enforcer Dennis Bonvie, who had
295 penalty minutes in 57 games with the AHL's Hamilton Bulldogs,
Edmonton's minor league affiliate.
	   The Toronto Maple Leafs then took defenseman Kevin Dahl from the
St. Louis Blues. Dahl spent most of last season with the IHL's
Chicago Wolves.
	   Montreal re-acquired goaltender Frederic Chabot from the Los
Angeles Kings. Chabot spent four years in the Canadiens'
organization before being traded to Philadelphia for cash in 1994.
	   The other players selected were defensemen Maxim Galanov
(Pittsburgh from the New York Rangers) and Rory Fitzpatrick (Boston
from St. Louis) and center Kip Miller (Pittsburgh from the New York
Islanders).
	   Among the veterans bypassed in the draft were goaltenders Kay
Whitmore (New York Rangers), Jim Carey (Boston) and Glenn Healy
(Toronto), defensemen Zarley Zalapski (New York Rangers), Neil
Wilkinson (Pittsburgh) and Al Iafrate (Carolina) and forwards John
Cullen (Tampa Bay) and Randy Cunneyworth (Buffalo).
	   Vancouver filled its back-up goaltending spot by re-signing
restricted free agent Corey Hirsch to a one-year deal 90 minutes
before the draft. Canucks president and general manager Brian Burke
urged Hirsch to agree to the deal before the draft or the Canucks
would select one of the goalies in the draft. Hirsch, who played
only one NHL game last season, will back up starter Garth Snow.

Lebanon denies sheltering Kurdish rebels, backs Syria
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in 2nd graf with Hrawi's meeting with Assad; with Arab
leaders sending messages of support to Syria in last two grafs. &QL; 
 &UR; With Turkey-Syria &QL; 
 &UR; By HUSSEIN DAKROUB &QC;

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanon on Monday denied it is harboring
Kurdish rebels and blamed Israel for the rising tension between
Syria and Turkey.
	   President Elias Hrawi traveled to Damascus Monday for a summit
meeting with President Hafez Assad to show Lebanon's support for
Syria. He called for a ``diplomatic dialogue'' to defuse the
tension, said Assad's spokesman Jubran Kourieh.
	   Prime Minister Rafik Hariri said his country backs Syria in the
dispute, which was triggered Sunday when Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel warned Damascus that his country would not allow its
neighbor to continue sheltering Kurdish rebels. Syria denied the
allegation.
	   Ankara has sent troops to its border with Syria, prompting fears
of an attack. The Turkish daily Milliyet speculated Sunday hat
Turkey could stage pinpoint attacks in the Syrian-controlled Bekaa
Valley of eastern Lebanon, where Turkey says rebels of Abdullah
Ocalan's Kurdish Workers Party, or PKK, maintain camps.
	   Lebanese Foreign Minister Faris Bweiz denied Monday that Kurdish
rebels were based in his country.
	   ``The Turkish authorities fully know that measures had been
taken in Syria and Lebanon more than 1 1/2 years ago to stop the
activities of any PKK member,'' Bweiz said at a news conference.
	   Ocalan in recent years was believed to shuttle between the Bekaa
Valley and neighboring Syria.
	   ``We stand by Syria's side, especially in its call for resolving
disputes with Turkey in the framework of a peaceful dialogue,'' the
Lebanese prime minister said in an interview with An-Nahar daily.
	   Hariri said Turkey's military moves were the product of its
newly forged military alliance with Israel.
	   ``The Turkish threats are the first outcome of the
Turkish-Israeli strategic alliance,'' Hariri was quoted as saying.
	   The Lebanese press also accused Israel of inflaming the
tensions.
	   ``It is brilliant Israeli intelligence versus absolute Turkish
folly,'' wrote Talal Salman, publisher of the leftist newspaper
As-Safir.
	   Israeli officials had no immediate comment because it is the
Sukkot holiday and all government offices are closed.
	   Since the Syrian-Turkish crisis began, Israeli defense minister
Yitzhak Mordechai has said Israel is not a party to it and that the
Israeli-Turkish military coooperation is not directed against any
third state.
	   Meanwhile, Syria's Assad received messages of support from Saudi
Crown Prince Abdullah bin Abdel-Aziz and from the leaders of Yemen
and Sudan, said Syria's official news agency, SANA.
	   The Arab leaders called for diplomatic solution to the crisis.

Spencer making his mark in playoffs after years in minor leagues
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HAL BOCK &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ It's as if Roy Hobbs stepped right out of the
film ``The Natural'' and into the New York Yankees' clubhouse.
	   Shane Spencer has heard that sort of talk and laughs it off.
	   ``Roy Hobbs was a movie,'' he said. ``This is real life.''
	   And Spencer knows all about that. The rookie slugger needed nine
years to become an overnight success. That's how it goes for
28th-round draft picks.
	   Now, at age 26, it has all come together for the outfielder. He
hit 10 home runs in 67 at-bats during the regular season and three
grand slams in 10 days.
	   He homered in his first postseason at-bat against Texas,
becoming the 27th player in major league history to do that and the
first Yankee to do so since Elston Howard in 1955.
	   Then he hit a three-run shot among claps of thunder in the
first-round clincher against the Rangers. The homer in Texas was
followed by a thunder storm.
	   ``You could feel it get cold,'' Spencer said. ``It was kind of
weird.''
	   Spencer was an afterthought in the 1990 draft. But he was built
like a hitter and scouts liked his compact swing, so they took a
shot.
	   The youngster drifted through the farm system, putting together
ordinary seasons at Tampa, Greensboro, Oneonta and Norwich. The
highlight may have come one year in Greensboro, North Carolina when
Mickey Mantle breezed through the clubhouse and was introduced to
Spencer.
	   ``There was a glow about him,'' the rookie remembered.
	   By last season, Spencer had graduated to Columbus, the Yankees'
Triple-A affiliate in Ohio, where he hit 30 homers and 34 doubles,
extra base numbers that attracted attention in New York.
	   When Chili Davis hurt his leg the first week of the season, the
Yankees summoned Spencer.
	   ``My first time up, I got a taste of it and I was excited to be
here,'' he said. ``After that, I was disappointed when I didn't
stay.''
	   Spencer spent the summer on the Yankees' shuttle to Columbus, up
and down four times in roster shuffles. In between the call-ups, he
put together his best season, batting .322 with 18 home runs and 67
RBIs in 87 games.
	   By the end of August, with the Yankees tidying up their roster
for the postseason, general manager Brian Cashman did a little
manipulating, promoting first baseman Scott Seabol, placing him on
the disabled list and using the flexibility created by the DL move
to activate Spencer.
	   ``I never thought about the postseason,'' Spencer said. ``I just
wanted a chance to play in September, maybe open some eyes for next
year.''
	   He certainly accomplished that, hitting eight homers in the
month, a Yankees rookie record. During the home run record chase,
the Yankee Stadium scoreboard posted updates on three sluggers _
Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa and Spencer.
	   The grand slam spree impressed manager Joe Torre, who needed 17
years to hit three of them, something Spencer did in less than two
weeks. Only seven Yankees have done that. The list includes Lou
Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio and Babe Ruth.
	   ``He spent eight years in the minor leagues,'' Torre said.
``That's probably more frightening than trying to produce in the
postseason. It's an opportunity he's taking advantage of, not only
to help us win now but to put him right in the mix for next year.''

Pierce beats Coetzer as Davenport poised to claim world No. 1
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FILDERSTADT, Germany (AP) _ France's Mary Pierce routed Amanda
Coetzer 6-2, 6-2 on Monday to kick off the Porsche Grand Prix.
	   But the match just set the stage for the real battle at the dlrs
450,000 event _ the question of who will be the world's No. 1
player next week.
	   Pierce next faces Lindsay Davenport, the second-ranked American
who could lose that second-round match and still end Hingis' long
reign as the world's top-ranked player.
	   In fact, Davenport seems more likely to finish the event as No.
1 than Hingis amidst a tough field where 18 of the world's Top
players 20 players are entered.
	   Hingis, the defending champion, must reach the final or be
automatically be bumped from the top by her tall American rival.
	   And the Swiss teenager has a tough draw, where her three matches
to the final could find her slugging it out against Russia's Anna
Kournikova, Venus Williams and world No. 3 Jana Novotna.
	   Davenport would also advance to No. 1 if she wins two matches
and Hingis loses the final, or if she reaches the final herself.
	   Pierce, ranked 11th in the world, needed just 65 minutes to oust
Coetzer, the No. 10. Lisa Raymond of the United States outlasted
Romania's Ruxandra Dragomir, 3-6, 6-2, 6-4 in the only other match.
	   Neither Coetzer or Pierce, despite their high rankings, were
among the eight seeds since the only Top 10 player missing is
Monica Seles.
	   Seles refuses to play in Germany since she was stabbed in
Hamburg in 1993.

Setback for Tyson on psychological records
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TIM DAHLBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ Mike Tyson lost another battle on Monday to
keep his psychological reports from being made public.
	   A judge rejected a request for a stay pending an appeal to the
Nevada Supreme Court.
	   The decision left the former heavyweight champion with only the
option of a direct appeal to the Supreme Court. That would almost
certainly delay a tentative Oct. 19 hearing in which Tyson will try
to regain his boxing license.
	   Tyson's lawyers are trying to decide whether to give up the
fight to keep the records private and go ahead with the Oct. 19
date. An early hearing date is important if Tyson is to fight this
year as planned, if he gets his license.
	   ``It doesn't look real good for them for an appeal to the
Supreme court so they just might have to face the music and release
the reports,'' said Kirk Hendrick, a deputy attorney general for
the Nevada Athletic Commission.
	   The same judge who rejected Tyson's effort last week to keep the
reports of psychiatrists who examined the former heavyweight
champion for five days last month turned down today's effort for a
stay that would keep them private pending an appeal to the Supreme
Court.
	   Tyson's lawyers indicated after last week's ruling that they
would release the reports despite their potential to embarrass the
boxer.
	   Tyson adviser Shelly Finkel said today he believes the report
from doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston will be
good enough to show Tyson if fit to fight.
	   ``I don't think there's anything to hide,'' Finkel said. ``But
if you were going to go through five days of questioning from
psychiatrists, I don't think you would want all your answers made
public.''
	   Nevada commissioners have said they want at least four working
days to review the reports before the hearing, meaning they would
have to be given to the commission by next Monday for an Oct. 19
hearing.
	   Commissioners demanded the reports following a hearing last
month in which they said they were not satisfied with the limited
psychological testing done on Tyson since he bit Evander
Holyfield's ears and was stripped of his license to box.

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The United Nations is investigating some
members of the U.N. peacekeeping force in Cyprus for allegedly
selling huge amounts of duty-free liquor and cigarettes illegally,
U.N. officials said Monday.
	   The officials wouldn't say how many people were targeted, but
indicated most were from Ireland. Also unclear was how much illegal
goods were sold, though a U.N. official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said it was a large amount.
	   U.N. troops are allowed to buy a certain amount of liquor and
cigarettes at duty-free, subsidized prices around the world.
Duty-free prices in Cyprus are generally less than half the market
price.
	   U.N. officials wouldn't say where the peacekeepers bought the
goods or where they were sold. A formal report is expected within
days, said U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard.
	   Punishment could include being shipped back home, said the U.N.
official who spoke of condition of anonymity.
	   Cyprus has been divided since a 1974 Turkish invasion sparked by
an abortive coup by supporters of union with Greece. A breakaway
Turkish Cypriot state in the north is recognized only by Turkey.
	   The 2,500-member U.N. peacekeeping force patrols the division
between the two sides.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan reported
Monday that Yugoslav forces increased their attacks on Kosovo's
ethnic Albanians after a U.N. resolution demanded a cease-fire and
that special police units are still on the ground.
	   In a widely anticipated report to the Security Council, Annan
listed apparent violations of a Sept. 23 U.N. resolution but said
he couldn't give an independent assessment of whether Serb forces
had complied with the council's demands.
	   NATO countries had been awaiting the U.N. chief's report to
determine whether to use military force to stop the offensive on
ethnic Albanians who are seeking independence from Yugoslavia.
	   Despite Annan's unwillingness to declare Serb noncompliance,
NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana and the United States
proclaimed he had said enough in reporting that Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic still had special units on the ground and hadn't
allowed an estimated 275,000 refugees to return to their homes.
	   Starkly laying out Yugoslavia's repressive actions, ``the
secretary-general detailed the failure of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia authorities to comply,'' with the Sept. 23 resolution,
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said in a statement.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ As U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's
left for another round of Mideast mediation, Israeli and the
Palestinian leaders both said they would not make concessions
unless the other side did.
	   Albright was to make a two-day visit to Israel and the
Palestinian areas in the hope of closing the gap between the two
sides on the terms of a second Israeli troop withdrawal in the West
Bank. The United States hoped to close the deal at a tripartite
summit of President Clinton, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in Washington.
	   Netanyahu said Monday there would be no agreement unless the
Palestinian Authority carried out its commitment to clamp down on
Islamic militants opposed to the peace process.
	   ``If they (the Palestinians) honor their part, there will be an
agreement. If they do not, we will not make unilateral
concessions,'' Netanyahu told an audience of Christian supporters
of Israel in Jerusalem.
	   The Palestinians say even diligent efforts cannot provide total
protection against attacks on Israel by Islamic militants.
	   A top Palestinian official said without Israeli concessions,
Albright's latest peace efforts ``won't go anywhere.''
	   Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, speaking to Associated Press
Television News in the West Bank town of Jericho, also accused the
Clinton administration of allowing Israel to drag its feet on
living up to past accords.
	   ``I hope Madame Albright will end this cycle _ meeting and
arranging other meetings, giving (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin)
Netanyahu the extra miles _ because this must stop and we must move
to substance,'' he told APTN.
	   ``We believe that without a clear-cut Netanyahu `yes' to the
American initiative and all its components, I think we won't go
anywhere,'' Erekat said.
	   The Palestinians earlier this year accepted terms of an
American-authored plan for an Israeli troop pullback in the West
Bank, but Netanyahu balked, citing security concerns. Talks in the
United States last week apparently brought the two sides closer
together, however.
	   Albright was to meet Tuesday _ separately _ with Netanyahu and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. Her visit is meant to lay the
groundwork for the Israeli-Palestinian summit in Washington
sometime around Oct. 15.
	   Albright was to spend only two days in the region, but was
accompanied by mediator Dennis Ross, who will likely stay longer to
try to coax the two sides as close to an accord as possible before
any summit.
	   On Monday's holiday, the Palestinian lands remained sealed off,
as they have been for much of the time since a series of Jewish
holidays beginning with the New Year on Sept. 20. The latest
closure, which was imposed on Friday, will remain in force at least
until Saturday, the army said Monday.
	   In imposing the closure, Israel cited security threats from the
radical Islamic group Hamas, which threatened revenge after two of
its top members were slain last month by Israeli troops who raided
their West Bank hideout.
	   Hamas has killed dozens of Israelis in suicide bombings since
1994.
	   Three pistol shots were fired at Israeli soldiers Monday in the
divided West Bank city of Hebron, but nobody was hurt. An officer,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said the shots were fired from
the Palestinian-controlled part of the city.
	   In the Gaza Strip, about 500 people staged a rally to demand the
release of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. Sheik Ahmed
Yassin, the spiritual leader of Hamas, attended, but did not
address the crowd.

King's company loses appeal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURIE ASSEO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Boxing promoter Don King's company lost a
Supreme Court appeal Monday in an insurance fraud case that
prosecutors have decided not to pursue.
	   Don King Productions had asked the high court to hear its
argument that King's testimony in a 1995 insurance fraud trial
should not be used against the company. The high court turned down
the company's appeal without comment.
	   The 1995 trial ended in a hung jury. In the second trial that
ended last July, King was acquitted of all charges while the jury
was unable to reach a verdict on charges against his company.
Prosecutors said they will not seek a retrial of the company.
	   King was accused of altering a contract with a fighter to cheat
Lloyd's of London out of dlrs 350,000. He had taken out an
insurance policy with Lloyd's in case a 1991 fight between Julio
Cesar Chavez and Harold Brazier was canceled.
	   The fight was called off when Chavez got hurt during training.
Prosecutors said King altered his contract with Chavez in a way
that would force Lloyd's to reimburse King for all training
expenses and then fraudulently collected dlrs 350,000.
	   The 1995 trial involved charges against King but not against his
company, and the boxing promoter testified that the contract was
altered without his knowledge or approval. The 2nd U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals ruled the testimony could be used against King's
company in the subsequent trial.
	   In appealing to the Supreme Court, lawyers for Don King
Productions said allowing use of King's testimony would violate the
company's right to confront the witnesses against it.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ With NATO attacks said to be only
days away, top U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke delivered an 11th-hour
warning Monday to Yugoslavia's president to halt his crackdown on
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo or face airstrikes.
	   But there was no sign that Slobodan Milosevic was backing down.
Following his meeting with Holbrooke, Milosevic's office issued a
statement denouncing NATO threats as a ``criminal act'' which
favored separatist ethnic Albanian guerrillas.
	   The statement, broadcast by government television, said there
had been no fighting in the Serbian province for the past seven
days and that the crisis represented no threat to other countries
in the southern Balkans.
	   Holbrooke, the U.S. ambassador-designate to the United Nations,
met with Milosevic for several hours late Monday after arriving
from Brussels, Belgium, where he conferred with senior NATO
officials.
	   There was no statement from Holbrooke after the meeting. Before
boarding a plane for Belgrade, however, Holbrooke said conditions
in the southern Serbian province had not improved since the
alliance started two weeks ago to finalize plans for air raids to
force Milosevic to halt his offensive against Kosovo Albanian
separatists.
	   Holbrooke said he planned to drive home to Milosevic ``the
extreme gravity of the situation.'' Holbrooke negotiated the peace
deal with Milosevic and other Balkan leaders that ended the 3 and
one-half year Bosnian war in 1995.
	   In Washington, President Clinton expressed concern that
Milosevic was ``playing the classic game of making false promises''
to avoid NATO military strikes.
	   Clinton, in a telephone call with Russian President Boris
Yeltsin, said Milosevic's compliance with U.N. demands ``must be
verifiable, tangible and irreversible,'' press secretary Joe
Lockhart said at the White House.
	   ``What happens next depends on President Milosevic,'' Lockhart
quoted the president telling the Russian leader, who has opposed
the use of force against Moscow's longtime ally.
	   As Holbrooke tried to resolve the crisis through negotiations,
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said a decision on NATO
military action was imminent.
	   ``We are getting ready for NATO action and later this week we
will expect a decision to be taken,'' Cook told reporters after a
special session of the Cabinet called by Prime Minister Tony Blair.
	   In Brussels, NATO officials said they were ready to launch
airstrikes within hours of receiving an order to attack.
	   If that first airstrike failed to deter Serb forces, a senior
NATO official said on condition of anonymity, the alliance could
unleash a ``fully fledged air campaign'' involving hundreds of
planes.
	   At the United Nations, Secretary-General Kofi Annan said
Yugoslav forces had increased their attacks on Kosovo's ethnic
Albanians even after a U.N. resolution demanded a cease-fire.
	   In a widely anticipated report to the Security Council, Annan
listed apparent violations of a Sept. 23 U.N. resolution, decried
the ``appalling atrocities in Kosovo,'' and said it was ``clear
beyond any reasonable doubt'' that Yugoslav forces were responsible
for the bulk of them.
	   The U.N. chief also said rebel forces of the Kosovo Liberation
Army also were responsible for human rights violations, a charge
the KLA quickly denied.
	   NATO countries had been awaiting the U.N. chief's report to
determine whether to use military force to stop the offensive on
ethnic Albanians, who are seeking autonomy like they had until
1989, if not independence, from Yugoslavia. Albanians in the
province outnumber Serbs 9-to-1.
	   Despite Annan's unwillingness to declare Serb noncompliance,
State Department spokesman James Foley said the Clinton
administration believed Milosevic had not met the conditions laid
down by the Security Council.
	   Briefing reporters in Washington, Foley cited the absence of a
formal cease-fire, the failure to arrange a meaningful dialogue
with ethnic Albanian leaders and the continued presence of ``major
army units'' in southeastern Kosovo near Albania's border.
	   Meanwhile, Yugoslavia's prime minister told an emergency session
of parliament Monday that the country ``is faced with the imminent
danger of war.'' Yugoslavia is comprised of dominant Serbia and
smaller Montenegro.
	   ``The threats are serious,'' Prime Minister Momir Bulatovic
said. ``And I call on this parliament to conclude that Yugoslavia
is faced with the imminent danger of war. Yugoslavia has to defend
itself if it was attacked.''
	   One option was for parliament to declare a state of emergency _
a step toward a mobilization of all military-aged men. But the
parliament voted to introduce the measure ``when the first bomb
drops on our territory.''
	   In an attempt to head off NATO action, Bulatovic said the
government had accepted a Russian proposal for an investigation by
the 54-nation Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
	   Yugoslavia had repeatedly rejected such a mission to Kosovo
until Yugoslav membership in the organization is restored.
	   The prime minister also said there was no longer any fighting in
Kosovo, which has 2 million residents. He said five of the 10
special police units had been removed from Kosovo and the others
had been returned to their barracks in the province.
	   One diplomat in Kosovo, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said there has been a significant redeployment of Yugoslav army
troops out of Kosovo to other parts of Serbia, including a
mechanized brigade that pulled out Sunday.
	   Some army units remain in the field, and there is enormous fear
that violence will resume, particularly among refugees, tens of
thousands of whom are living in the hills and forests without
shelter.

British soldiers drop appeal and seek shortening of their sentence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Three British soldiers found guilty in 1996 of the
rape and killing of a Danish tour guide in Cyprus have dropped
efforts to overturn their conviction, their lawyer announced
Monday.
	   Instead, defense lawyers will argue that the island's supreme
court should reduce the men's life sentence on the grounds that it
is ''excessively harsh,'' lawyer Antonis Andreou told the British
Press Association.
	   ''We decided it would be more beneficial if we concentrated on
the issue of sentencing since we were not able to overrule the
abduction, conspiracy to abduct and attempted rape charges,'' he
said.
	   The three _ Justin Fowler, 30, from Falmouth, Alan Ford, 29,
from Birmingham, and Geoffrey Pernell, 27, of Oldbury, West
Midlands _ were convicted of kidnapping 23-year-old Louise Jensen
in 1994 outside a night spot in the tourist resort of Ayia Napa.
Prosecutors said the men then raped her and beat her to death with
a shovel.
	   The three admitted during the trial that they kidnapped the tour
guide. But they claimed they were too drunk to remember details and
tried to blame each other. They were sentenced to life in prison
without remission.
	   Defense lawyers had hoped to persuade the court to overturn the
convictions on the grounds that the soldiers were arrested
illegally and the lower court erred during the trial, but the
lawyers changed tactics after an appeal hearing Monday, the Press
Association said. The hearing is scheduled to continue on
Wednesday.
	   At the time of their arrest, the men were serving with the Royal
Greenjackets Regiment at a British military base on the island.
They were discharged after their conviction.

launch air strikes without U.N. Security Council backing.
	   The EU foreign ministers, meeting in Luxembourg, agreed to
tighten economic sanctions against Milosevic, but it was unlikely
that stricter travel curbs for Yugoslav officials and freezing more
Yugoslav assets abroad would be anything more than symbolic.

LPGA plans tournament to honor Harvey Penick
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MICHAEL HOLMES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) _ After a lengthy absence, the LPGA tour will
return to Texas next year with a tournament honoring Harvey Penick,
the local teaching pro whose students included some of the game's
best players _ both men and women.
	   The 72-hole, dlrs 800,000 tournament will be played at Austin's
Onion Creek Club, the course which played host to the first Legends
of Golf and helped give birth to the men's Senior PGA Tour.
	   Penick, who died in 1995, ``was one of the true pioneers, one of
the truly important figures, not just in golf but in all of women's
sports,'' said LPGA commissioner Jim Ritts.
	   ``Harvey taught almost half of the players in the LPGA Hall of
Fame. He was among the first to recognize that women could play
golf and play well at all levels.''
	   As pro at Austin Country Club, Penick's pupils included two-time
Masters champion Ben Crenshaw; U.S. Open winner Tom Kite; Kathy
Whitworth, winner of 88 tournaments; Mickey Wright; and Betsy
Rawls.
	   The new tournament, called the Philips Invitational Honoring
Harvey Penick, will be held May 20-23 and televised by CBS. The
winner will take home dlrs 120,000, Ritts said.
	   The LPGA has played an annual Skins Game at Frisco, Texas, for
most of the 1990s, and the 1991 U.S. Women's Open was held at Fort
Worth's Colonial Country Club.
	   But the last full-field LPGA tournament in Texas was the Mazda
Hall of Fame Championship, played at Sugar Land, in 1985 and 1986.
Ritts, a native Texan, said he wasn't sure why it has been so long
since the women played a tournament in the state.
	   ``There was absolutely no doubt in my mind. I strongly believed
in the state of Texas as a home for women's golf,'' he said.
	   ``I know the players are going to be hungry to play in Texas.
It's been a long time since we've been here,'' said Cindy
Figg-Currier, a 15-year LPGA pro and Austin resident.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey's and Syria's neighbors sought
Monday to mediate a crisis that they feared could engulf the Middle
East in war, while Turkey said its armed forces were ready to act
against Syria should diplomacy fail.
	   Turkey accuses Syria of sheltering Kurdish rebels, allowing them
to keep battling Turkey from cross-border bases after largely being
neutralized on their home turf.
	   ``We don't a war with Syria, we want it to cut its support to
Turkish Kurdish rebels and extradite their leaders to Turkey for
trial,'' Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz told private Star television
late Monday.
	   ``Syria has been at least 10 years late in doing that,'' he
said. ``If it further delays it, then it will be the side which
will get harmed.''
	   Yilmaz said that Syria has been waging an undeclared war against
Turkey for decades through its support to the rebels and thus
Turkey has the right to self-defense according to the 51st article
of the charter of the United Nations.
	   Syria on Monday called for a dialogue to end the crisis.
	   ``Syria knows how to defend its interests,'' the National
Progressive Front, a high-level advisory body to the government,
said. The front is controlled by the ruling Baath Party.
	   ``The language of threats is not suitable to deal among states.
The language of dialogue is the only one that can solve all the
remaining problems,'' the front said.
	   Earlier in the day, the military and President Suleyman Demirel
also stressed that Turkey was seeking peace not war.
	   ``We are a country that loves peace,'' said Gen. Ilhan Kilic,
chief of the air force. ``But we do not let our national interests
get harmed.''

Brazilian markets slide despite Cardoso's almost certain
</HEADLINE>
reelection &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Brazilian stocks dropped sharply
Monday in the lowest trading volume of the year despite the almost
certain re-election of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso.
	   Brazil's largest stock exchange, Sao Paulo Bovespa, lost 4.5
percent while the smaller Rio de Janeiro stock exchange fell 3.4
percent.
	   Although Cardoso seems to have clinched a first-round win,
investors feared that he would put off any announcement of the
harsh economic measures deemed necessary until the second round of
voting for a number of governors, senators and federal deputies
takes place on Oct. 25.
	   ``Cardoso has won in the first round, but the market is thinking
that all the measures we are waiting for will only take place after
the second round,'' said Fabio Lara, director at Schahin Cury
brokerage in Sao Paulo.
	   Lara said that the Cardoso government doesn't want to announce
anything detrimental _ such as tax increases _ to its allied
candidates in the state governments until they are through the
second round of voting.

Jewish holiday mostly quiet despite security fears

 &UR; UPDATES with shots fired in Hebron, extension of closure &QL;

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israelis on Monday celebrated the Jewish
holiday of Sukkot with festive meals served up in hut-like
structures built on urban balconies and suburban backyards.
	   Despite fears of terror attacks, the day passed almost without
incident, with the Palestinian lands remaining sealed off. In the
divided West Bank town of Hebron, where there had been clashes on
the previous five days, three pistol shots were fired Monday at
Israeli soldiers, but nobody was hurt.
	   An Israeli officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
shots came from the Palestinian-controlled part of the city.
	   Sukkot, or the Feast of the Tabernacles, is one of the more
joyous holidays on the Jewish calendar. Many Israelis, both
religious and secular, build a sukkah, or hut, of materials ranging
from wood and palm branches to prefab metal and plastic.
	   The huts are meant to commemorate ancient Israelites' wanderings
in the desert. Religious Jews sleep and pray in theirs; the more
secular mainly use the structures for hearty celebratory meals in
keeping with Sukkot's tradition as a harvest festival.
	   The holiday also has strong traditional associations with
nature, and Israelis headed in droves to the country's beaches and
national parks. Tour buses backed up by the dozens at the crossing
point into Egypt's Sinai peninsula, and hiking tours were fully
booked.
	   The festival lasts a week, but the main day of commemoration was
from sundown Sunday to sundown Monday, when shops, offices,
restaurants and schools were closed. Hours at many establishments
were to be curtailed all week.
	   As it has during other recent holidays, Israel sealed off the
Palestinian lands and imposed tight security. The closure has been
in effect, with some brief interruptions, since just before the
start of the Jewish New Year on Sept. 20. On Monday the army
announced that it would remain in force at least until Saturday.
	   Last month, the radical Islamic group Hamas threatened revenge
attacks and kidnappings of soldiers during the holiday season. The
threat came after Israeli troops killed two top Hamas fugitives in
their West Bank hideout.

EU looks at tightening sanctions as military planners continue

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with meeting over, divisions in Western Europe; EDITS
to tighten and conform. &QL; 
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ As NATO officials reiterated their readiness
for a military campaign in the restive Serbian province of Kosovo,
European Union nations were divided Monday on whether to launch
airstrikes without U.N. Security Council backing.
	   The EU foreign ministers agreed to tighten economic sanctions
against Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to end the violence
in Kosovo. It was unlikely, however, that stricter travel curbs for
Yugoslav officials and freezing more Yugoslav assets abroad would
be anything more than symbolic.
	   International appeals for a peaceful solution to the Kosovo
crisis have been repeatedly been ignored in the federal Yugoslav
capital of Belgrade to the point that the United States is pressing
its allies for airstrikes.
	   The threats have had at least a temporary effect on Milosevic,
whose offensive is designed to repress sentiment among the majority
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo province to break away from Yugoslavia,
which is composed of Serbia and the smaller republic of Montenegro.
	   Milosevic has ordered most of his Serb army units back to their
barracks, withdrawn police units and apparently ordered a halt to
the burning of villages. Some 250,000 people remain homeless, with
winter approaching.
	   The Europeans are wavering, however, wondering about the wisdom
of NATO attacking a sovereign nation without a specific nod from
the United Nations.
	   The EU foreign ministers did, however, debate tighter travel
restrictions on Yugoslav officials and extending a freeze on
Serbian assets abroad to cover state-owned companies, such as the
national airline JAT.
	   The EU has sought to punish Yugoslavia for its crackdown against
ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo through an investment ban, an
assets freeze, visa restrictions, a ban on arms exports and flights
by Yugoslav air carriers to EU points.
	   In Brussels, NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana stressed the
alliance was ready to launch a military attack.
	   ``The reality coming to us is that the compliance is not yet in
place,'' Solana said in reaction to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan's statement that he lacked the means to verify if Milosevic
had complied with U.N. demands to end the crackdown.
	   French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said his government would
first have to ``evaluate all the elements of the situation.'' He
suggested that could take two days.
	   Britain is Washington's staunchest ally in pursuing airstrikes
without the U.N.'s blessing and Foreign Secretary Robin Cook was at
pains to get European support for that here.
	   ``Milosevic must change his conduct. We are determined to send
him a very clear message and we are working determinedly with the
international community to make sure that we are all united in
sending him a very clear message,'' Cook said.
	   But Manfred Hoyer, Germany's Deputy Foreign Minister, cautioned,
``It is far too early to talk about military action. This is going
too far.''
	   Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos said for NATO to
attack a sovereign nation ``requires a very strong legal basis.''
Unless the U.N. provides that, he said, there was a danger of
``generalized war'' in the Balkans.
	   Lamberto Dini, the Italian foreign minister, told reporters,
``We must negotiate. It is too early to talk about military
intervention.'' The Dutch and the Belgians also said they want a
U.N. mandate.

Death toll rises in Haitian town washed away by Hurricane Georges
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MICHAEL NORTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Searchers recovered more bodies
over the weekend from tons of gravel deposited by storm flooding in
a southeastern Haitian town, pushing the national death toll from
Hurricane Georges past 150, officials said Monday.
	   Seventeen bodies were recovered in Fonds Verrettes, a mountain
town 50 miles (80 kilometers) east of Port-au-Prince, bringing the
town's death toll to 102, said Rep. Francois Sanozier, who
represents the area.
	   Earlier, officials said at least 85 people were killed in Fonds
Verrettes, population 27,000. The nationwide death toll of at least
150 people was released before the 17 new victims of the Sept. 23
floods were recovered.
	   In all, Georges killed at least 430 people throughout the
Caribbean.
	   Forty years ago, Fonds Verrettes flourished at the foot of
wooded mountains, but farm incomes fell and impoverished peasants
cut down trees to make charcoal. With no forest cover to absorb
Georges' torrential rains, storm runoff crashed through the town,
destroying dozens of homes and buildings.
	   ``We asked the government to build drainage canals. But nothing
was done. Now it is too late,'' said Fonds Verrettes Mayor Nelson
Frankel.
	   An Interior Ministry spokesman, Phares Pierre, told Radio
Haiti-Inter on Monday that the central government had decided to
relocate the town out of harm's way, but gave no further details.
	   A government delegation brought rice, sugar, beans and water for
hurricane victims on Saturday, and more aid was expected this week.

Annan briefs council on meetings with Iraqi officials
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Amid renewed defiance from Iraq over
allowing arms inspectors to return to work, the U.N. chief briefed
the Security Council on Monday about his three meetings with Iraq's
deputy prime minister and his efforts to end the standoff.
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan was also told by individual council
members about their negotiations last week with Tariq Aziz.
	   Annan met with Aziz three times last week in an attempt to
convince Iraqi leaders to rescind their Aug. 5 decision breaking
off cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors. The move has prevented
any spot inspections from taking place because U.N. experts must be
accompanied by Iraqi escorts on searches of suspected weapons
sites.
	   The U.N. chief and Aziz are scheduled to meet again Wednesday.
	   Iraq has said it won't reverse course until the council
undertakes a so-called ``comprehensive review'' of U.N. economic
sanctions imposed in 1990 after the invasion of Kuwait.
	   In Baghdad on Monday, Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan
said that Iraq's decision of Aug. 5 to suspend cooperation with the
inspectors ``is a decision which cannot be reversed.''
	   ``Iraq cannot go on bearing the injustice it has been subjected
to,'' Ramadan said. ``The status quo is totally unacceptable to
Iraq.''
	   The council, which suspended its regular reviews of sanctions in
response to the Aug. 5 decision, unanimously agreed that Iraq must
allow inspectors to resume their work before a ``comprehensive
review'' can go forward.
	   ``(Annan) will be giving them the state of play as of today,''
said U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard. ``And I guess trying to pave the
way for some kind of agreement before Tariq Aziz would go back to
Baghdad.''
	   Aziz postponed his scheduled weekend return to Baghdad after his
last meeting with Annan on Friday.
	   Weapons inspectors must report Iraq free of chemical, biological
and nuclear weapons, and long-range missiles, before the council
can consider lifting sanctions.
	   Baghdad hopes that the comprehensive review will recognize
Iraq's efforts to meet disarmament mandates, and acknowledge that
it no longer possesses certain weapons, particularly its nuclear
arsenal.

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co.
said Monday it has received 3,000 claims on damage caused by
Hurricane Georges in Puerto Rico.
	   The Columbus, Ohio-based company said it expects total claims in
Puerto Rico to reach dlrs 6 million. Hurricane Georges hit the
island on Sept. 21 before continuing on to the Dominican Republic,
Haiti, Cuba and the United States.
	   Puerto Rico's insurance commissioner has estimated total damages
to the island at about dlrs 2 billion.
	   Total claims on Nationwide-insured properties in the Caribbean
and the United States will probably top dlrs 66 million, the
company said.
	   The majority are in Mississippi, where the company expects dlrs
38 million in claims, including a school, apartment buildings and
other costly commercial buildings.

Mexico's ruling party appears to do well in Chiapas elections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) _ Candidates of Mexico's
ruling party appeared Monday to have dominated local elections in
southern Chiapas state, especially because many supporters of a
rebel movement didn't vote, instead electing their own local
officials.
	   Few disruptions were reported in Sunday's elections, in which
voters in 102 municipalities picked mayors and delegates to the
state legislature.
	   Eight municipalities didn't vote because heavy flooding last
month made it impossible to distribute and collect ballots. Voting
was annulled in another municipality where residents boycotted the
election.
	   Election officials said turnout was below 50 percent.
	   With 90 percent of the votes counted, candidates of the ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, appeared to have won
mayoral races in 57 municipalities; the center-left Democratic
Revolution Party, or PRD, in 14; and the center-right National
Action Party, or PAN, in three.
	   The other races were too close to call until the rest of the
votes were counted. Final results were expected Wednesday.
	   According to the preliminary results, the PRI appeared to have
recaptured 27 mayorships that it lost in 1995 elections, said Lino
Celaya Luria, a PRI congressman from Chiapas.
	   Authorities annulled the voting in one municipality, San Juan
Chamula, because residents boycotted the vote to protest the
jailing a year ago of five men accused of murder.
	   In the voting for state legislature candidates, the PRI won 17
races, the PAN, two, and the PRD, one. The race in the district
that includes San Juan Chamula was annulled.
	   Because of San Juan Chamula and the eight flooded
municipalities, the state legislature cannot be installed until
special elections that must be called before Nov. 16.
	   In addition to 24 directly elected lawmakers, 16 more are named
based on overall party percentages. Officials must wait until all
municipalities vote before determining those percentages.
	   More than half of eligible voters didn't cast their ballots.
Many of the absentees were supporters of the Zapatista National
Liberation Army, which staged a brief revolt in 1994 to demand
democracy and better living conditions for the state's poor
Indians.
	   Many pro-rebel communities have set up parallel governments and
chosen their own leaders.
	   The ruling party traditionally has held onto power in Chiapas
through repression and fraud at the polls.

EPA outlines mass testing of possible chemical risk
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By H. JOSEF HEBERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The Environmental Protection Agency outlined
plans Monday to test thousands of chemicals to determine if they
disrupt hormonal systems and lead to increases in cancer and
infertility.
	   The screening process, which will be worked out over the next
six months, is a major step in a project likely to take years to
determine if certain chemicals cause risky hormonal changes in
humans and animals.
	   The agency initially is targeting some 15,000 chemicals,
including pesticides and ingredients found in thousands of products
in homes and the workplace.
	   Environmentalists and some health experts have argued that there
is growing evidence that a large number of synthetic chemicals
affect estrogen levels and thus lead to cancers and neurologic and
fertility problems. Such chemicals are called ``endocrine
disruptors.''
	   While no conclusive link has been found, the concerns led
Congress two years ago to require the EPA to develop a testing
procedure that ultimately will determine the potential risks.
	   An EPA advisory panel that included industry representatives,
environmentalists and health experts concluded as many as 62,000
chemicals eventually may have to be examined, but that the EPA
should start with 15,000 that are produced in high volumes and, in
most cases, are toxic.
	   ``Testing chemicals on this scale for endocrine disruption has
never been done before,'' said Lynn Goldman, the EPA's assistant
administrator for toxic substances. She called it a ``technological
challenge,'' but one that also represents ``a major step forward in
public health protection.''
	   First, scientists will prioritize which chemicals have the
greatest potential risk. Then they'll go through an initial
screening, followed by more detailed testing of the chemicals or
chemical mixtures that appear to pose the greatest concern.
	   Theo Colborn, whose book ``Our Stolen Future'' focused public
attention on endocrine disruptors several years ago, said the
screening process was a major step forward.
	   But she called it only ``the tip of the iceberg'' in dealing
with a problem. ``We have years and years ahead of us ... before we
find that these tests are foolproof,'' said Colborn, a zoologist
with the World Wildlife Fund and a member of the EPA advisory
panel.

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ The first Brazilian president to ever
win re-election, Fernando Henrique Cardoso must now put his
popularity through an even tougher test _ harsh austerity measures
needed to break Brazil's economic meltdown.
	   Cardoso moved closer Monday to a first-ballot victory as returns
came in from the interior, where the government historically does
well. Cardoso must win more than half the vote in Sunday's election
to avoid a second-round runoff _ a feat he is expected to easily
accomplish.
	   But a tougher task lies ahead: to rein in the international
financial crisis that began in Asia and, like a domino, now
threatens his country.
	   The prospect that the newly re-elected Cardoso may slash
government spending and increase taxes helped lead the Brazilian
stock markets lower Monday, closing off 4.5 percent in Sao Paulo
and 3.4 percent in the smaller Rio de Janeiro exchange.
	   The United States and other major industrialized nations, deeply
concerned about Brazil, worked Monday on a multibillion-dollar
bailout package as US. President Bill Clinton convened a meeting in
Washington of officials from 22 nations trying to overcome the
economic crisis.
	   The financial crisis, which has already prompted the IMF to
assemble more than dlrs 100 billion in bailouts for Thailand,
Indonesia, South Korea and Russia, created a distinctly somber mood
at this year's meetings.
	   With 64.5 percent of the ballots counted Monday, Cardoso was
leading with 51.2 percent. His closest rival, Luiz Inacio Lula da
Silva of the leftist Workers Party had 34 percent, while Ciro Gomes
of the Popular Socialist Party had 11 percent. Nine other
candidates shared the rest.
	   A Cardoso victory was no surprise to the 106 million Brazilians
who voted for president, 27 governors, all 513 federal deputies,
one-third of the 81-seat Senate and 1,405 state legislators.
Cardoso had been the front-runner for the entire campaign.
	   Argentine President Carlos Menem called Cardoso on Sunday
evening to congratulate him, saying Cardoso's victory would provide
continuity in the ongoing construction of the regional trade bloc
Mercosur.

	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ Guerrillas detonated roadside bombs in
southern Lebanon on Monday, killing two Israeli soldiers and
wounding at least three others.
	   Hezbollah, the Shiite Muslim guerrilla group fighting Israeli
forces in the south, claimed responsibility, saying its fighters
simultaneously detonated two bombs as an Israeli convoy was
passing.
	   A statement from the group said the targeted road linked bases
manned by Israeli troops and their allied South Lebanon Army
militia.
	   In Israel, the military said two soldiers were killed and six
wounded in the incident. Security officials in Lebanon said earlier
that two soldiers were killed and three wounded.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan reported
Monday that Yugoslav forces intensified attacks on Kosovo's ethnic
Albanians even after a U.N. resolution demanded a cease-fire and
that special police units remained in the southern Serb province.
	   In a widely anticipated report to the Security Council, Annan
listed apparent violations of a Sept. 23 U.N. resolution but said
he couldn't give an independent assessment of whether Serb forces
had complied with the council's demands.
	   NATO countries had been awaiting the U.N. chief's report to
determine whether to use military force to stop the offensive on
ethnic Albanians who are seeking independence from Yugoslavia.
	   Despite Annan's unwillingness to declare Serb noncompliance,
NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana and the United States
proclaimed he had said enough in reporting that Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic still had special units on the ground and hadn't
allowed an estimated 275,000 refugees to return to their homes.
	   Starkly laying out Yugoslavia's repressive actions, ``the
secretary-general detailed the failure of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia authorities to comply,'' with the Sept. 23 resolution,
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said in a statement.
	   NATO's supreme allied commander for Europe, Gen. Wesley K.
Clark, said action could come in a matter of hours and days once a
political decision had been reached.
	   The 15-member council was expected to take up the report
Tuesday.
	   In its Sept. 23 resolution, the council demanded an immediate
end to the fighting that has left hundreds of people _ mostly
ethnic Albanian civilians _ dead and uprooted 275,000 since a Serb
crackdown began in February. Most ethnic Albanians want
independence for the province, which is 90 percent ethnic Albanian.
Milosevic stripped Kosovo's autonomy in 1989.
	   In its resolution, the council demanded Milosevic withdraw his
special forces from the province and allow for the safe return of
refugees and for humanitarian access to them. It demanded both
sides work toward finding a political solution.
	   In Monday's report, Annan reported that in the week following
the Sept. 23 resolution, government security forces ``intensified
their operations, launching another offensive in the Drenica
region,'' and elsewhere.
	   Fighting continued Sept. 28-29 despite the Serb prime minister's
statement that Serb operations had ended and peace reigned in
Kosovo, Annan said.
	   As a result, another 20,000 people were reportedly displaced, he
said.
	   While fighting began to wind down in the last days of September,
with troops returning to their barracks and a limited number of
police units being withdrawn, the United Nations has received
information ``that the government's armed presence remains
significant and that the operations of the special police
continue,'' Annan wrote.
	   Russian ambassador Sergey Lavrov said his country agreed with
most of Annan's observations but said Russia wanted updated
information about an apparent easing of the military offensive over
the weekend. ``We understand things have been moving and in the
right direction,'' he said.
	   In his report, Annan decried the ``appalling atrocities in
Kosovo,'' and said it was ``clear beyond any reasonable doubt''
that Yugoslav forces were responsible for the bulk of them.
	   Ethnic Albanian forces also have been fighting, he said, adding
that there was reason to believe that they were responsible for
atrocities as well.
	   The U.N. chief said he couldn't give the council a clear-cut,
independent assessment of compliance with the Sept. 23 resolution
because the United Nations doesn't have the people on the ground in
Kosovo to determine that. He noted his report was based on
information provided by the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, the European Union, NATO and individual
states _ though U.N. staff did provide independent information on
the humanitarian situation.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ If last-ditch diplomatic efforts fail
to resolve the Kosovo crisis, NATO's military will be ready to
launch airstrikes against the Serbs within hours of receiving the
order to attack, officials said Monday.
	   If the order comes, a senior NATO military official said a first
strike would be launched to ``make a strong statement of resolve by
forceful means.''
	   If that fails, the alliance could unleash a ``fully fledged air
campaign'' involving hundreds of planes which risked imposing ``the
hardship of war'' on the Serbian people, said the official speaking
on condition of anonymity.
	   NATO said a decision on whether to strike was close, and that
much depended on talks in Belgrade between Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke.
	   ``Mr. Holbrooke will tell Milosevic that the resolution of the
U.N. Security Council is there to be complied with. If not, he
knows that NATO is prepared to act,'' said NATO Secretary General
Javier Solana after meeting Holbrooke at NATO's headquarters.
	   Holbrooke, the U.S. ambassador-designate to the United Nations,
met with Milosevic for several hours late Monday. But Milosevic
showed no signs of backing down.
	   Following his meeting with Holbrooke, Milosevic's office issued
a statement denouncing NATO threats as a ``criminal act'' that
favored separatist ethnic Albanian guerrillas. Holbrooke issued no
statement after the meeting.
	   NATO's top commander in Europe, U.S. Gen. Wesley K. Clark, said
that, once given the green light, the military would act swiftly.
``NATO action, should a political decision be taken, could come in
a matter of hours and days,'' he told reporters.
	   However, the 16 NATO nations remained divided over whether to
launch airstrikes without a specific U.N. mandate. The United
States and Britain say NATO has all the authority it needs to
strike, other European allies are wavering.
	   In a report NATO officials said would be an important benchmark
in determining the international response, U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said he could not verify whether Milosevic was
complying, but he said Yugoslav forces had stepped up attacks on
ethnic Albanians following the U.N. resolution.
	   Solana said Milosevic had not complied with the U.N. resolution
demanding an end to hostilities and the senior official at NATO
military headquarters outside the southern Belgian city of Mons
said a ``substantial'' Serbian security presence remained in Kosovo
despite the return of some units to garrison.
	   For security reasons, NATO officials are refusing to release
full details of the air force the 16 alliance nations are preparing
for possible raids or say exactly which targets would be hit.
	   To make the skies over Yugoslavia safe for NATO pilots,
Yugoslavia's anti-aircraft missiles sites, air bases and radar
stations would likely be among the early targets.

Jewish holiday passes quietly despite security fears

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israelis on Monday celebrated the Jewish
holiday of Sukkot with festive meals served up in hut-like
structures built on urban balconies and suburban backyards.
	   Despite fears of terror attacks, the day passed almost without
incident, with the Palestinian lands remaining sealed off. In the
divided West Bank town of Hebron, where there had been clashes on
the previous five days, three pistol shots were fired Monday at
Israeli soldiers, but nobody was hurt.
	   An Israeli officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
shots came from the Palestinian-controlled part of the city.
	   Sukkot, or the Feast of the Tabernacles, is one of the more
joyous holidays on the Jewish calendar. Many Israelis, both
religious and secular, build a sukkah, or hut, of materials ranging
from wood and palm branches to prefab metal and plastic.
	   The huts are meant to commemorate ancient Israelites' wanderings
in the desert. Religious Jews sleep and pray in theirs; the more
secular mainly use the structures for hearty celebratory meals in
keeping with Sukkot's tradition as a harvest festival.
	   The holiday also has strong traditional associations with
nature, and Israelis headed in droves to the country's beaches and
national parks. Tour buses backed up by the dozens at the crossing
point into Egypt's Sinai peninsula, and hiking tours were fully
booked.
	   The festival lasts a week, but the main day of commemoration was
from sundown Sunday to sundown Monday, when shops, offices,
restaurants and schools were closed. Hours at many establishments
were to be curtailed all week.
	   As it has during other recent holidays, Israel sealed off the
Palestinian lands and imposed tight security. The closure has been
in effect, with some brief interruptions, since just before the
start of the Jewish New Year on Sept. 20. On Monday the army
announced that it would remain in force at least until Saturday.
	   Last month, the Islamic militant group Hamas threatened revenge
attacks and kidnappings of soliders during the holiday season. The
threat came after Israeli troops killed two top Hamas fugitives in
their West Bank hideout.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ With NATO attacks said to be only
days away, top U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke delivered an 11th-hour
warning Monday to Yugoslavia's president to halt his crackdown on
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo or face airstrikes.
	   But there was no sign that Slobodan Milosevic was backing down.
Following his meeting with Holbrooke, Milosevic's office issued a
statement denouncing NATO threats as a ``criminal act'' which
favored ``Albanian villains and not the Albanian people.''
	   The statement, broadcast by government television, said there
had been no fighting in the Serbian province for the past seven
days and that the crisis represented no threat to other countries
in the southern Balkans.
	   ``A political solution is the only possible solution,'' the
statement added. It expressed hope ``that the international
community will finally contribute to reviving the political process
instead of issuing threats.''
	   Holbrooke, the U.S. ambassador-designate to the United Nations,
met with Milosevic for several hours late Monday after arriving
from Brussels, Belgium, where he conferred with senior NATO
officials.
	   Following the meeting here, Holbrooke said he sought to convince
Milosevic of ``the grave situation we are facing.'' Holbrooke
planned to visit the Kosovo capital Pristina on Tuesday for talks
with ethnic Albanian leaders _ several of whom have called openly
for NATO intervention.
	   ``The military planning is going forward on a serious, intense
and sustained basis as we talk,'' Holbrooke added. Asked if
Milosevic got the message, Holbrooke replied, ``you'll have to ask
him that.''
	   In Brussels, Holbrooke said conditions in the southern Serbian
province had not improved since the alliance started two weeks ago
to finalize plans for air raids to force Milosevic to halt his
offensive against Kosovo Albanian separatists.
	   Holbrooke negotiated the peace deal with Milosevic and other
Balkan leaders that ended the 3 and one-half year Bosnian war in
1995.
	   In Washington, President Clinton expressed concern that
Milosevic was ``playing the classic game of making false promises''
to avoid NATO military strikes.
	   Clinton, in a telephone call with Russian President Boris
Yeltsin, said Milosevic's compliance with U.N. demands ``must be
verifiable, tangible and irreversible,'' press secretary Joe
Lockhart said at the White House.
	   ``What happens next depends on President Milosevic,'' Lockhart
quoted the president telling the Russian leader, who has opposed
the use of force against Moscow's longtime ally.
	   As Holbrooke tried to resolve the crisis through negotiations,
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said a decision on NATO
military action was imminent.
	   ``We are getting ready for NATO action and later this week we
will expect a decision to be taken,'' Cook told reporters after a
special session of the Cabinet called by Prime Minister Tony Blair.
	   In Brussels, NATO officials said they were ready to launch
airstrikes within hours of receiving an order to attack.
	   If that first airstrike failed to deter Serb forces, a senior
NATO official said on condition of anonymity, the alliance could
unleash a ``fully fledged air campaign'' involving hundreds of
planes.
	   At the United Nations, Secretary-General Kofi Annan said
Yugoslav forces had increased their attacks on Kosovo's ethnic
Albanians even after a U.N. resolution demanded a cease-fire.
	   In a widely anticipated report to the Security Council, Annan
listed apparent violations of a Sept. 23 U.N. resolution, decried
the ``appalling atrocities in Kosovo,'' and said it was ``clear
beyond any reasonable doubt'' that Yugoslav forces were responsible
for the bulk of them.
	   The U.N. chief also said rebel forces of the Kosovo Liberation
Army also were responsible for human rights violations, a charge
the KLA quickly denied.
	   NATO countries had been awaiting the U.N. chief's report to
determine whether to use military force to stop the offensive on
ethnic Albanians, who are seeking autonomy like they had until
1989, if not independence, from Yugoslavia. Albanians in the
province outnumber Serbs 9-to-1.
	   Despite Annan's unwillingness to declare Serb noncompliance,
State Department spokesman James Foley said the Clinton
administration believed Milosevic had not met the conditions laid
down by the Security Council.
	   Briefing reporters in Washington, Foley cited the absence of a
formal cease-fire, the failure to arrange a meaningful dialogue
with ethnic Albanian leaders and the continued presence of ``major
army units'' in southeastern Kosovo near Albania's border.
	   Meanwhile, Yugoslavia's prime minister told an emergency session
of parliament Monday that the country ``is faced with the imminent
danger of war.'' Yugoslavia is comprised of dominant Serbia and
smaller Montenegro.
	   ``The threats are serious,'' Prime Minister Momir Bulatovic
said. ``And I call on this parliament to conclude that Yugoslavia
is faced with the imminent danger of war. Yugoslavia has to defend
itself if it was attacked.''
	   One option was for parliament to declare a state of emergency _
a step toward a mobilization of all military-aged men. But the
parliament voted to introduce the measure ``when the first bomb
drops on our territory.''
	   In an attempt to head off NATO action, Bulatovic said the
government had accepted a Russian proposal for an investigation by
the 54-nation Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
	   Yugoslavia had repeatedly rejected such a mission to Kosovo
until Yugoslav membership in the organization is restored.
	   The prime minister also said there was no longer any fighting in
Kosovo, which has 2 million residents. He said five of the 10
special police units had been removed from Kosovo and the others
had been returned to their barracks in the province.
	   One diplomat in Kosovo, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said there has been a significant redeployment of Yugoslav army
troops out of Kosovo to other parts of Serbia, including a
mechanized brigade that pulled out Sunday.
	   Some army units remain in the field, and there is enormous fear
that violence will resume, particularly among refugees, tens of
thousands of whom are living in the hills and forests without
shelter.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexico and the European Union have agreed on
a negotiating framework for a free-trade agreement, less than three
months after talks began in Brussels, Belgium, the Department of
Commerce said Monday.
	   Negotiators agreed to form three technical groups during a
three-day meeting that ended Friday in Mexico City, the department
said in a press release. One group will address access to markets,
another will address trade in services and capital flows and a
third group will address ``institutional aspects'' of the
agreement.
	   All three technical groups will report to a negotiating group
that will coordinate the talks.
	   The Mexico City meeting was the first since Mexico and the
15-nation E.U. opened talks July 14. Negotiators agreed to meet
again Nov. 9-13 in Mexico.

Quisenberry: player, family man, friend
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CRAIG HORST &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LEAWOOD, Kansas (AP) _ Dan Quisenberry was remembered Monday as
a man filled with passion and humor and whose life was so much more
than the uncanny ability to put a quirky spin on a baseball.
	   ``The beauty of Dan was that he had a profound love for
people,'' the Rev. David Krueger said at a memorial service. ``Dan
was always a regular guy. He always had the right perspective.''
	   Quisenberry, who died of a brain cancer last week at 45,
side-armed his way into the record books with the Kansas City
Royals. The pitcher loved to quote Peggy Lee when asked about the
sinker.
	   ``Hitters see it and say is that all there is,'' Quisenberry
would say, but it was enough for 244 saves in 12 years, including
what was then a major-league record 45 in 1983.
	   Some 200 people attended the memorial at Quisenberry's church.
The family held private services earlier.
	   Among his former teammates on hand were George Brett, Frank
White, John Wathan, Jamie Quirk, Steve Balboni, Mark Gubicza,
Willie Wilson and others from the 1985 club that defeated St. Louis
to give Kansas City its only championship.
	   Quisenberry won the pivotal sixth game for a team managed by
Dick Howser, who also died of brain cancer.
	   ``What a team, what a town, what a game,'' Quisenberry said on
the 10th anniversary of the championship, the twinkle in his eyes

Yankees and Indians talk of grudges and `head hunting'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RONALD BLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ One inside pitch is all it may take to transform
the American League championship series into a brawl.
	   All the ingredients are there: Cleveland's upset win over New
York last year, Jaret Wright's drilling of Luis Sojo last spring,
the 114 wins by the Yankees, breaking the AL record set by the '54
Indians.
	   So watch out for chin music. High heat could mean trouble.
	   ``You don't have to pitch up and in and head hunt,'' David Wells
said Monday, a day before starting the opener against Cleveland's
Jaret Wright.
	   ``Sometimes it can be personal through the course of the year.
... They are an aggressive team, and I think we are, too. It is
something _ you just got to go out there and fight to the death.
When you go out there and try to win ballgames, things can happen,
guys get a little bit out of control at times.''
	   The Yankees have hunger in their eyes, still angry at themselves
for losing to Cleveland in the first round last year, when New York
was defending its '96 World Series title.
	   Wright beat the Yankees twice in that five-game series and twice
more this season _ half the Indians' wins in their 11 games against
the Yankees. Sojo says Wright deliberately hit him during spring
training March 2, fracturing a bone in the his left hand and
sidelining the infielder until April 27.
	   ``Jaret is not a head hunter, but to be effective, anybody has
to throw inside,'' Indians manager Mike Hargrove said. ``I don't
think we should all get carried away in dragging out old grudges or
new grudges. As far as I know, there is no bad blood between these
two teams.''
	   In a way, that's true. After going 114-48 during the regular
season and sweeping Texas in the first round, the Yankees want to
steamroll any and all opponents.
	   Holding Texas to a .141 batting average in the first round
wasn't luck, the way New York sees it.
	   ``It's tough to make a bad decision when you have the quality
that I have,'' New York manager Joe Torre said.
	   And now New York has rookie Shane Spencer, the hottest hitter in
the game. And the incentive to win for Darryl Strawberry,
recovering from surgery last weekend to remove a cancerous tumor
from his colon.
	   ``The Straw factor is part of it,'' Torre said. ``He keeps
giving orders to go out and do it. He did it again yesterday.''
	   Given the Yankees' strength, it's almost overlooked that
Cleveland is the defending AL champion, trying to win its third
pennant in four seasons.
	   ``We're always the underdog. That doesn't matter. We have
enjoyed being the underdog,'' said Cleveland's Sandy Alomar Jr.,
who homered off Mariano Rivera to tie Game 4 last year when the
Yankees were four outs from advancing.
	   The Indians, who have won four straight AL Central titles, are
coming off a four-game win over Boston. They have lost seven
straight postseason openers and really don't want to be down a game
when David Cone pitches in Yankee Stadium's famous October shadows
Wednesday against Charles Nagy.

 &UR; Tough talk from Israel and Palestinians on eve of Albright visit &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Albright's departure, Netanyahu's
statement, extension of closure and shots fired in Hebron; CHANGES
dateline &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ As U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's
left for another round of Mideast mediation, Israeli and the
Palestinian leaders both said they would not make concessions
unless the other side did.
	   Albright was to make a two-day visit to Israel and the
Palestinian areas in the hope of closing the gap between the two
sides on the terms of a second Israeli troop withdrawal in the West
Bank. The United States hoped to close the deal at a tripartite
summit of U.S. President Bill Clinton, Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in
Washington.
	   Netanyahu said Monday there would be no agreement unless the
Palestinian Authority carried out its commitment to clamp down on
Islamic militants opposed to the peace process.
	   ``If they (the Palestinians) honor their part, there will be an
agreement. If they do not, we will not make unilateral
concessions,'' Netanyahu told an audience of Christian supporters
of Israel in Jerusalem.
	   The Palestinians say even diligent efforts cannot provide total
protection against attacks on Israel by Islamic militants.
	   A top Palestinian official said without Israeli concessions,
Albright's latest peace efforts ``won't go anywhere.''
	   Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, speaking to Associated Press
Television News in the West Bank town of Jericho, also accused the
Clinton administration of allowing Israel to drag its feet on
living up to past accords.
	   ``I hope Madame Albright will end this cycle _ meeting and
arranging other meetings, giving (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin)
Netanyahu the extra miles _ because this must stop and we must move
to substance,'' he told APTN.
	   ``We believe that without a clear-cut Netanyahu `yes' to the
American initiative and all its components, I think we won't go
anywhere,'' Erekat said.
	   The Palestinians earlier this year accepted terms of an
American-authored plan for an Israeli troop pullback in the West
Bank, but Netanyahu balked, citing security concerns. Talks in the
United States last week apparently brought the two sides closer
together, however.
	   Albright was to meet Tuesday _ separately _ with Netanyahu and
Arafat. Her visit is meant to lay the groundwork for the
Israeli-Palestinian summit in Washington sometime around Oct. 15.
	   Albright was to spend only two days in the region, but was
accompanied by mediator Dennis Ross, who will likely stay longer to
try to coax the two sides as close to an accord as possible before
any summit.
	   The Palestinian lands remained sealed off Monday during the
Jewish holiday of Sukkot, as they have been for much of the time
since a series of Jewish holidays beginning with the New Year on
Sept. 20. The latest closure, which was imposed on Friday, will
remain in force at least until Saturday, the army said Monday.
	   In imposing the closure, Israel cited security threats from the
radical Islamic group Hamas, which threatened revenge after two of
its top members were slain last month by Israeli troops who raided
their West Bank hideout.
	   Hamas has killed dozens of Israelis in suicide bombings since
1994.
	   Three pistol shots were fired at Israeli soldiers Monday in the
divided West Bank city of Hebron, but nobody was hurt. An officer,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said the shots were fired from
the Palestinian-controlled part of the city.
	   In the Gaza Strip, about 500 people staged a rally to demand the
release of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. Sheik Ahmed
Yassin, the spiritual leader of Hamas, attended but did not address
the crowd.

	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ Guerrillas detonated roadside bombs in
southern Lebanon on Monday, killing two Israeli soldiers and
wounding at least three others.
	   Hezbollah, the Shiite Muslim guerrilla group fighting Israeli
forces in the south, claimed responsibility, saying its fighters
simultaneously detonated two bombs as an Israeli convoy was
passing.
	   A statement from the group said the targeted road linked bases
manned by Israeli troops and their allied South Lebanon Army
militia.
	   In Israel, the military said two soldiers were killed and six
wounded in the incident. Security officials in Lebanon said earlier
that two soldiers were killed and three wounded.

South Korean fishing crew abandon ship as it drifts onto rocks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) - A helicopter rescued 39 South
Korean fishermen from the sea off New Zealand's southern tip
Tuesday as their 200 foot (60 meter) fishing boat listed sharply
after drifting onto rocks.
	   The crew of the Dong Won 529 abandoned the vessel after it
drifted up onto rocks, apparently without power on the small island
of Breaksea at the eastern tip of Stewart Island, rescue officials
said.
	   National Rescue Coordination Center spokeswoman Emma Peel told
National Radio a scoop-net was lifting three crew at a time from
the listing vessel and from inflatable lifeboats to a ferry.
	   Apart from one crew member reported with a broken ankle, Peel
said the
	   rescue was proceeding well in calm sea conditions.
	   The captain and four other crew had remained aboard the vessel,
maintaining radio contact with rescue services.
	   She said the captain hoped the fishing boat might refloat later
in the morning on the incoming tide.
	   She said the captain had reported to the rescue center that his
boat was not taking in water, but so far had given no explanation
as to why it had washed up onto the remote rocky shore.
	   ``It (the boat) is about half out of the water and lisitng over
to one side,'' she said.
	   Good weather and calm sea conditions were assisting the rescue
effort.
	   Stewart Island, some 20 miles (35 km) across Foveaux Strait from
South Island, is the smallest and most rugged of New Zealand's
three main islands, with fewer than 2,000 residents, mainly fishers
and farmers.

Leeward Islands to play United States in Red Stripe cricket opener
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Title holders Leeward Islands will
begin the defense of their Red Stripe Bowl cricket crown in
Kingston, Jamaica on Tuesday with a match against newcomers the
United States.
	   The game marks the beginning of the regional one-day cricket
tournament season.
	   The Leewards squad boasts several members of the powerhouse West
Indies team, including fastbowlers Curtley Ambrose and Kenneth
Benjamin.
	   They are heavily favored over the U.S. team, which is stocked
with many Caribbean expatriates, but manager Carlisle Powell said
the team is not taking the underdog lightly.
	   ``Every match match for us is serious,'' Powell said.
	   The Leewards, United States, Jamaica and Barbados will contest
Group B of the Red Stripe Bowl. Last season's runners-up _ Guyana,
Trinidad and Tobago, the Windward Islands and Bermuda _ will fight
for Group A.
	   The top two teams in each group will meet in the semi-finals,
and the championship is scheduled for Oct. 19 in the northern
Jamaica city of Ocho Rios.

Austerity measures to test real strength of Cardoso's popularity

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ The first Brazilian president to ever
win re-election, Fernando Henrique Cardoso must now put his
popularity through an even tougher test _ harsh austerity measures
needed to break Brazil's economic meltdown.
	   Cardoso moved closer Monday to a first-ballot victory as returns
came in from the interior, where the government historically does
well. Cardoso must win more than half the vote in Sunday's election
to avoid a second-round runoff _ a feat he is expected to easily
accomplish.
	   But a tougher task lies ahead: to rein in the international
financial crisis that began in Asia and, like a domino, now
threatens his country.
	   The prospect that the newly re-elected Cardoso may slash
government spending and increase taxes helped lead the Brazilian
stock markets lower Monday, closing off 4.5 percent in Sao Paulo
and 3.4 percent in the smaller Rio de Janeiro exchange.
	   The United States and other major industrialized nations, deeply
concerned about Brazil, worked Monday on a multibillion-dollar
bailout package as US. President Bill Clinton convened a meeting in
Washington of officials from 22 nations trying to overcome the
economic crisis.
	   The financial crisis, which has already prompted the IMF to
assemble more than dlrs 100 billion in bailouts for Thailand,
Indonesia, South Korea and Russia, created a distinctly somber mood
at this year's meetings.
	   With 66.3 percent of the ballots counted Monday, Cardoso was
leading with 51.3 percent. His closest rival, Luiz Inacio Lula da
Silva of the leftist Workers Party had 34 percent, while Ciro Gomes
of the Popular Socialist Party had 11 percent. Nine other
candidates shared the rest.

After 14 years, Gwynn's finally back in NLCS
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BERNIE WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) _ The last time Tony Gwynn was in the National
League championship series, he was in his second full season in the
majors and had just won his first batting title.
	   Back then, in 1984, the Padres thought they'd be regular playoff
participants. Batting titles and gaudy averages piled up for Gwynn,
but not trips to the postseason.
	   Here he is, at age 38, just now returning to this stage of the
playoffs.
	   ``It stunk having to wait 14 years to get back here,'' Gwynn
said with his trademark hearty laugh Monday morning. The clubhouse
still smelled of champagne from Sunday night's celebration after
the Padres beat Randy Johnson and the Houston Astros 6-1 to clinch
their best-of-5 division series in four games.
	   ``I am happy as heck and I'm sure everybody in this room is,''
Gwynn said before the Padres flew to Atlanta, where they will face
the Braves for the NL pennant beginning Wednesday night at Turner
Field.
	   The Braves of the 90s probably feel that reaching the NLCS is
their birthright, because they've done it seven straight times.
Still, the Padres aren't merely happy to be here. They want to get
to the World Series, too.
	   ``We're coming in euphoric, man,'' said Gwynn, who's won eight
batting titles. ``We just won a series nobody gave us a chance to
win and now we're playing Atlanta. It's baseball. We feel like
we've got a good chance to win this series if we play our game. I
wouldn't expect them to feel any different than they probably feel
right now, and they expect to win this series and go on to the
World Series.''
	   Getting past the first round was imperative to the Padres, Gwynn
said. There was lingering disappointment from getting swept by St.
Louis in the 1996 playoffs. There was the big offseason investment
in ace Kevin Brown. There was the acquisition down the stretch of
players like Jim Leyritz, who once again is a playoff hero after
homering in the final three games of the division series, and
reliever Randy Myers, which bumped up the payroll.
	   Off the field, the future of baseball in San Diego depends on a
proposition for a new downtown ballpark on the Nov. 3 ballot.
	   With John Smoltz, Tom Glavine and Greg Maddux coming up, Gwynn
knows that the Padres batters better start contributing as much as
their pitchers have.
	   Brown and Sterling Hitchcock were brilliant in the division
series. Brown struck out 16 in the opener, then came back and
started Saturday night on three days' rest. He allowed just one
earned run in 14 2-3 innings. Hitchcock was masterful with his
split-fingered fastball Sunday night, striking out 11 and allowing
three hits and one run in six innings.
	   Trevor Hoffman, the best closer in baseball, saved the first two
wins and wrapped up Sunday's with a perfect ninth.
	   ``This is the biggest thrill of my career,'' said Gwynn, the
lone player left from the Padres team that won the 1984 NL pennant.
``Going to the World Series in 1984 was great, but the long wait in
between makes this really nice right now.''

Fan who caught McGwire's 70th loaning ball to museum
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By R.B. FALLSTROM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ The fan who ended up with Mark McGwire's record
70th home run ball has loaned it to the St. Louis Cardinals' Hall
of Fame while he decides what to do with it.
	   The ball, which is worth millions of dollars on the collectibles
market, will be on display indefinitely starting next Monday at the
museum that shares space with the Bowling Hall of Fame across the
street from Busch Stadium.
	   Gerald Baltz, the museum's executive director, said at a news
conference Monday he expects to have the ball for a month or so.
	   By that time, Baltz expects that Phil Ozersky, a 26-year-old DNA
lab researcher from suburban Olivette, will have decided what to do
with the prize. Ozersky said he'd like the ball to end up at
Cooperstown, but then again he's not as willing as some of the
other lucky ball recipients to just give it away.
	   ``It's been pretty intense with the media, and I'm starting to
figure out what Mr. McGwire felt like at the end of the season,''
Ozersky said. ``If he needs four months to figure out how he felt
about his 70 home runs, I need a little time to bask in the glow.''
	   The Baseball Hall of Fame is a non-profit organization and does
not pay for items displayed. But Ozersky could have it both ways by
selling the ball to a well-heeled individual who wouldn't mind the
positive publicity to be gained from donating it to the Hall of
Fame. Another option: selling sponsors for a ball tour.
	   Ozersky's attorney, David Krathen of Miami, said his client has
received countless proposals since snaring No. 70 in the St. Louis
Cardinals' finale Sept. 27. There's been everything but a call from
McGwire, who has said he's not interested in paying for the ball.
	   ``He's been besieged by agents, auctions houses, individuals,''
Krathen said. ``You name it, they've contacted us.
	   ``I think the right thing to do is take your time, take a deep
breath, step back and see what the various options are.''
	   Ozersky said it's hard to believe how much people are willing to
pay.
	   ``It's a dlrs 9 ball,'' Ozersky said. ``It's pretty amazing to
think about it.''
	   For now, it'll be front and center at the museum in a glass case
that also includes the bat McGwire used to hit his 400th career
home run, a large photograph of Ozersky holding his prize, and
several photographs of McGwire launching the record shot off Carl
Pavano of the Montreal Expos. The exhibit is called ``Hunt for the
Long Ball.''
	   The case is protected by electronic sensors and there are
several other security measures in place, including an
around-the-clock police guard, to ensure that nobody walks off with
the ball.
	   ``This is not just a baseball, this is history,'' police chief
Ronald Henderson said. ``We will do whatever it takes to make sure
this ball is secured.''

	   LONDON (AP) _ A Foreign Office minister said Monday that the
British phone company whose four employees were kidnapped in
Chechnya at the weekend was specifically warned to withdraw from
Russia's breakaway region, but ignored the advice.
	   ``The advice could not have been clearer, the risks were known
to the company and to the employees,'' said Foreign Office Minister
Derek Fatchett in a British Broadcasting Corp. radio interview.
``The fact that they ignored that advice is a decision they took
themselves and is their responsibility ... It's a mature world and
people have to take mature decisions.''
	   The company, Granger Telecom, said it knew Chechnya was probably
the world's most dangerous place for kidnapping but thought its
staff would be well-protected because they were working on a
government contract to install a telecommunications system.
	   Three of the kidnaped men, Britons Darren Hickey and Rudolph
Petschi and New Zealander Stanley Shaw, worked for Granger. The
British company said the fourth hostage, Briton Peter Kennedy, may
have been employed directly by Chechen Telecom, which has offered a
reward for information about the kidnapping.
	   The men were seized early Saturday after a shoot-out with their
bodyguards. There was no word on any ransom demand for the four
men.
	   ``We had a general advice from the Foreign Office about visits
to Chechnya but no specific advice about us,'' Granger Telecom
chief executive Ray Verth told the BBC.
	   Verth, who has now suspended operations in Chechnya, said the
company had considered the contract, worth several million dollars,
justified the risk. The company was 12 months into a five-year
contract to install 300,000 telephone lines across Chechnya.
	   Hickey had been in the region since early August and was due
back in Britain this week, said Verth. Shaw had been in Chechnya
only a week and Petschi for 2 1/2 weeks.
	   ``None of our employees were forced to go, they voluntarily went
_ they knew the risks,'' said Verth. ``We understood and believed
they were well catered for because we were contracted with the
Chechen government and Chechen Telecom, who guaranteed our safety,
which obviously has not occurred.''
	   Fatchett said Britain would do all it could to get the men
released.
	   Hickey's sister said Monday his family is devastated. ``He was
just out there doing a job to help the country get their
communications back,'' said a tearful Deborah Hickey, 21.
	   Hickey, who is single and lives with his parents at Thames
Ditton, south of London, had been to Chechnya twice before, she
said, ``and he thought there was no danger at all,'' despite having
heard gunfire on a previous trip _ ``he said that was part of it.''
	   She did not blame Granger. ``Darren is old enough to make his
own decision to go out there or not,'' she said.
	   Shaw's wife, Lilly, 40, said Monday she had been beside herself
with worry and that their four-year-old daughter, Priscilla, had
been crying for her father .
	   ``I am sure he (Mr. Shaw) knows Chechnya is dangerous but he did
not say so _ he would not want to worry me,'' Mrs. Shaw said. ``I
just hope he will come back safe and soon. It would be awful if he
were held for a year like those other hostages. I don't know if I
could cope.''
	   The Russian news agency ITAR-Tass on Monday quoted Magomed
Magomadov, Chechen deputy procurator-general, as saying one of the
kidnappers was wounded and received treatment at the district
hospital in Urus-Martan.
	   The men were seized just two weeks after Chechen warlords
released two British charity workers who had been held for 14
months.
	   London's Guardian newspaper said Monday that the latest
kidnappings ``cast fresh doubt on Foreign Office claims to have
paid no ransom'' to secure the release of the charity workers.

Ghosts of Communists haunt another French-Italian meeting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: SUBS last graf, More talks, with defense ministers discussing
possible NATO intervention for Kosovo situation &QL; 
 &UR; With AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By FRANCES D'EMILIO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FLORENCE, Italy (AP) _ Premier Romano Prodi briefed French
Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin on Monday on his plans to
survive in office despite a key ally's rebellion.
	   For a second straight year, the ghost of Italian Communists
haunted a summit between Rome and Paris.
	   Last year, the annual top-level bilateral talks, then held in
Chambery, France, came as Communist unhappiness over Prodi's
planned budget cuts forced the premier to offer his resignation.
	   This year, the crisis is worse. On Sunday, the leadership of
Italy's Communists, who give Prodi's center-left Olive Tree
coalition a majority in the lower Chamber of Deputies, voted to
yank support for the government and to veto the latest budget
proposal.
	   Prodi appeared headed for a confidence vote this week. A loss
could lead to early elections or a reshuffled Cabinet.
	   But Prodi appeared confident he had a fighting chance at winning
the vote, said a senior French advisor, briefing reporters on
condition of anonymity about the premier's pre-dinner talks with
Jospin.
	   The aide said Prodi was counting on defections from the
Communist Refoundation party to help him get close to a Chamber
majority. The other needed votes would presumably come from
centrists now in the opposition.
	   In 1997, Prodi wooed back the Communists by embracing Jospin's
push for a 35-hour work week, a key demand by Italian Communist
leader Fausto Bertinotti, who also provoked the latest crisis.
	   This year's talks began about a half-hour late Monday evening,
as sometimes driving rain slowed the arrival of some of the French
being driven to Renaissance-era Pitti Palace near the Arno River.
	   More talks are set for Tuesday. In a late after-dinner meeting
that lasted into early Tuesday, the Italian and French defense
ministers discussed possible NATO intervention in Yugoslavia over
the Kosovo situation. An Italian defense ministry spokesman
declined to give details of the discussion.

Conference targets child sexual exploitation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Britain's plan to treat child prostitutes as
victims rather than offenders in graf 9; No pickup &QL; 
 &UR; By MITCH STACY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Child welfare experts and government officials
from 25 European and Asian countries will meet here this week to
attack the problem of commercial sexual exploitation of children.
	   The three-day Asia-Europe Meeting beginning Tuesday will address
child prostitution and child pornography, and further develop a
network among member countries so ideas and solutions can be
shared.
	   An estimated 1 million children worldwide are lured or forced
into the sex market every year, experts say. The problem is
especially serious in Asia, where pedophiles from Europe often
travel to take advantage of the many street children there.
	   ``This is a major new initiative,'' British Foreign Office
Minister Derek Fatchett said Monday. ``It will guide and strengthen
cooperation in Asia and in Europe between governments, voluntary
organizations and international organizations.''
	   Fatchett said the conference will examine the international
dimension to the child sex trade, focusing on better systems to
prosecute and deter ``child sex tourists'' from Europe.
	   Participants will consider such ideas as a Dutch plan for a
multinational digital pornography library to help keep tabs on the
child-sex industry, Vietnamese drop-in centers for child
prostitutes, and exploitation awareness programs for children in
the Philippines.
	   Also, plans are in the works for a clearing house and site on
the World Wide Web so information can be more easily shared,
Fatchett said.
	   ``We need to bring people together, because here we are talking
about a global problem,'' he said. ``The issues we are facing are
happening on scale we find both difficult to understand and
distressing to believe.''
	   Britain plans to announce new guidelines on Tuesday that would
treat child prostitutes as victims rather than offenders. The
guidelines are being prepared for police forces and will rely on
cooperation between numerous agencies to assist the youth, Home
Office Minister Alun Michael will tell the conference.
	   Christine Beddoe, the United Kingdom coordinator for End Child
Prostitution, Child Pornography and Trafficking (ECPAT), said she
hoped the conference would put some new momentum behind the
campaign. She said she was dismayed by the lack of effort following
the 1996 World Congress Against the Commercial and Sexual
Exploitation of Children in Stockholm, during which the 122
participating nations agreed to develop action plans.
	   ``It is a disappointment and an embarrassment that only a
handful of countries have even gone down the track of starting to
initiate these programs,'' she said.
	   Participating this week are the 15 member countries of the
European Union, along with Brunei, China, Indonesia, Japan, Korea,
Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

	   FORT-DE-FRANCE, Martinique (AP) _ Police said Monday they have
arrested five people on charges of attempting to smuggle drugs from
the French Caribbean to mainland France.
	   Investigators in Martinique would not reveal the suspects'
identities, but they said four are Venezuelan and one is from
Martinique. The Venezuelans, three men and one woman, had been
under police surveillance for four months in a hotel room in
southern Martinique.
	   Investigators seized 43 kilograms (95 pounds) of cocaine and
three guns in the hotel room.
	   A sixth suspect, Patrice Charlery, was arrested last week in the
outskirts of Paris and was to be transferred to Fort-de-France late
Monday.

	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Venezuela's leading presidential
candidate on Monday denied a newspaper report that he has links to
guerrillas and is forming a secret armed militia.
	   ``I tell you simply, it's false,'' Hugo Chavez told reporters.
He said he has been the victim of numerous false reports fabricated
by intelligence police in Venezuela and Colombia.
	   The Miami Herald, citing mostly unidentified officials and
secret intelligence reports, reported Monday that Colombian rebels
provided military training in 1996 and 1997 to a 200-member militia
controlled by Chavez.
	   Chavez, 44, a former paratrooper, has an 11-point lead over
former state Gov. Henrique Salas Romer in the Dec. 6 presidential
race, according to the latest major poll.
	    &UR; ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ President Ernesto Zedillo stood guard Monday
beside the body of Gov. Hector Teran Teran of northern Baja
California state, and state officials gathered to discuss choosing
the governor's replacement.
	   Teran Teran died of a heart attack Sunday morning. He was 67.
	   Zedillo, who is from Baja California, flew with his wife to the
state capital of Mexicali on Sunday. A funeral was planned for
later Monday.
	    &UR; ___
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ A former provincial governor and
presidential candidate was absolved Monday of pocketing millions of
dollars while he was a public official.
	   Eduardo Angeloz, who served three terms as governor of Cordoba
province during the 1980s, was cleared of charges he took about
dlrs 4 million while governor. Prosecutors had sought a five-year
sentence.
	   Two of Angeloz's sons were among 14 other people also cleared of
charges associated with the investigation.
	   Angeloz ran for president as a Radical party candidate in 1989
but lost to current Argentine President Carlos Menem.

	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ An intense police search began
Monday for the killers of a senior prosecutor in a western province
of Honduras.
	   The 31-year-old chief district attorney, Pedro Garcia
Villanueva, was shot dead by two gunmen Sunday night when walking
toward his apartment in the city of Santa Barbara, 100 miles west
of the capital, Tegucigalpa.
	   Investigators did not specify a possible motive.
	   Human rights groups have denounced rising crime in Honduras,
where more than 700 people have died in unclear circumstances since
1990.

	   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) _ More than 1,000 former
paramilitary fighters launched a hunger strike Monday in front of
the presidential palace, saying they would starve themselves until
they were compensated for their service during El Salvador's civil
war.
	   Many fought alongside army soldiers during the 1979-92 civil
war, but they have not been paid, and are demanding dlrs 2,000 each
plus housing and farm land.
	   President Armando Calderon Sol has offered all fighters over 45
and with more than 20 years of service a pension of dlrs 34.50 a
month, but the men have rejected that proposal.
	   ``We don't want pensions. We want compensation _ paid now,''
yelled Juan Pablo Paniagua, leader of the former fighters. The
group has held protests for a month.

Canadian company denies supplying eight reactors to India
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS spelling of Felstead STED Felsted in 6th graf. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Canadian company that manufactures CANDU
nuclear power reactors says it supplied one of the heavy water
reactors to India and halted construction on a second after India
detonated a nuclear device in 1974.
	   Atomic Energy of Canada Limited took issue with a report in the
October issue of Jane's Intelligence Review that said eight of
India's 10 nuclear power reactors are CANDUs.
	   India completed the second Canadian reactor on its own in 1981
and built additional heavy water reactors with different features,
the company said.
	   Larry Shewchuk, manager of media relations at Atomic Energy of
Canada Limited, said the safety shutdown system and radiation
containment structures of the Indian-built reactors ``are vastly
different than those of the CANDU design.''
	   T.S. Gopi Rethinaraj, a science writer based in Bombay who
writes for Jane's on nuclear issues, said two reactors at Madras,
two at Narora and two at Kakrapar, ``were done indigenously but
were all based on the basic CANDU design which uses natural uranium
as fuel and heavy water as moderator.''
	   Peter Felstead, editor of Jane's Intelligence Review, said the
London-based magazine stands by the story ``that they are
CANDU-type reactors.''
	   ``They may have been stored in slightly different buildings.
They may have changed the safety measures, but it's essentially the
same type of reactor as supplied by Canada, indigenously built,''
he said.
	   The Jane's report on nuclear reactor performance indicated that
India is now capable of producing 455 atomic bombs and Pakistan can
build 105 nuclear weapons.

They're back! Leyritz, Brown haunt Braves
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL NEWBERRY &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ They're a couple of guys who rekindle bad
memories for the Atlanta Braves.
	   Jim Leyritz turned the 1996 World Series with a three-run homer,
and the New York Yankees went on to beat the Braves in six games.
	   ``Some guys always seem to rise to the occasion,'' Denny Neagle
said. ``He's one of them.''
	   A year ago, it was Kevin Brown's turn to break Atlanta's heart.
He had two wins for the Florida Marlins in the NL championship
series, including a Game 6 triumph that ended the Braves' season.
	   ``Facing him is not one of the more enviable tasks in the
National League,'' Chipper Jones said. ``He's nasty and dominating
and as tough a competitor as anybody there is.''
	   Now, Brown and Leyritz are teammates for the San Diego Padres,
who will meet Atlanta in the NLCS that begins Wednesday night at
Turner Field.
	   If the Braves are the favorite based on their 106 regular-season
wins and seven straight postseason appearances, the combined karma
of Brown and Leyritz might be enough to even things up for the
Padres.
	   Neagle was the starting pitcher on that night two years ago when
the Braves seemed poised to win their second straight World Series.
Leading two games to one, Atlanta built a 6-0 lead in Game 4.
	   The Yankees cut the margin in half before Leyritz tied it up
with a three-run homer in the eighth against Mark Wohlers. New York
won 8-6 in 10 innings and took the next two games as well to
capture the championship.
	   ``Obviously, he's been a thorn in the side around here, probably
more so than anywhere else,'' Neagle said. ``Well, I take that
back. I'm sure he's ringing in the ears of a lot of Houston Astros
fans right now. He's been unbelievable.''
	   Leyritz added to his postseason lore in the division series
victory over Houston, homering three times in four games. Among his
victims: Randy Johnson and Billy Wagner.
	   ``Wohlers is in some pretty good company,'' said John Smoltz,
who'll start Game 1 for the Braves, followed by Tom Glavine and
Greg Maddux.
	   Manager Bobby Cox will use a four-man rotation against the
Padres, going with 16-game winner Neagle in Game 4. The left-hander
was bothered by bursitis in the final weeks of the season and
didn't pitch at all in the division series.
	   Cox doesn't plan any changes to his 25-man roster.
Forty-three-year-old Dennis Martinez and 20-year-old rookie Odalis
Perez will remain in the bullpen, and Marty Malloy will be carried
as a spare infielder because of lingering concerns about the health
of second baseman Keith Lockhart and shortstop Walt Weiss.

Like everyone else, 49ers live on edge
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVE GOLDBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Football Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Unnoticed in San Francisco's 3-0 start was the
fact that the 49ers had flaws.
	   Yes, they were averaging an unheard of 544 yards and 37 points a
game. But they also were next to last in defense, allowing 405
yards.
	   So it probably shouldn't have been a surprise that Buffalo beat
them Sunday. And clearly it was no surprise the unbeaten Saints
lost. They were defeated at home by New England.
	   The Dolphins went down, too. They've been 3-0 four of the last
five seasons, but the Jets sent them tumbling.
	   A week ago, it was the Seahawks' turn. They lost 13-10 in
Pittsburgh after routing Philadelphia, Arizona and Washington.
	   In Buffalo, the 49ers committed 22 penalties for 178 yards. They
did come back from a 23-0 deficit with three fourth-quarter TDs,
but were finally done in by their last penalty _ offside on an
onside kick they recovered.
	   Penalties weren't the only problem.
	   Jamie Brown, who had a troubled training and lost his left
tackle job to Dave Fiore, had a difficult time filling in for the
injured Fiore against Bruce Smith. Smith ended up with a sack and
four pressures on Steve Young.
	   There also are problems in the secondary, where Antonio Langham
is either getting beat or getting flagged. The free-agent flip-flop
_ Langham from Baltimore to the 49ers and Rod Woodson to the Ravens
_ isn't working out as San Francisco had hoped.
	   Coach Steve Mariucci doesn't quite know what to do about the
penalties, some of which were stupid, such as a 15-yard body slam
by safety Tim McDonald, a 12-year veteran.
	   ``I don't think we're going to run sprints for every penalty or
anything like that,'' Mariucci said. ``But it has to be
addressed.''
	   That the Saints and Dolphins lost was less startling.
	   New Orleans was a one-touchdown underdog against New England
despite playing at home. The Saints actually gave a good account of
themselves, losing 30-27 on Adam Vinatieri's field goal in the
final seconds.
	   That might be a major breakthrough for New England _ Drew
Bledsoe needs a few game-winning drives to move into the elite
quarterback class.
	   Miami was 3-0 on running and defense. Running doesn't usually
work well against Bill Parcells and Bill Belichick, who had two
weeks to prepare. So the Jets limited the Dolphins to 34 yards on
the ground and forced Dan Marino to pass 32 times. That exposed
Miami's shortcomings at receiver _ Marino completed just 13 passes
for 121 yards and two interceptions, and the Jets won 20-9.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; LIVING ON THE EDGE: &LR;  Two years ago, the Carolina Panthers made
it to the NFC title game in their second year behind a defense
laden with veterans, good special teams, and a mistake-proof
offense.
	   This season, they're 0-5 and lost 51-23 to Atlanta on Sunday.
They still have veterans, some the same, some retreads (Kevin
Greene) and some new ones (Greg Lloyd).
	   But Tim Dwight's 93-yard TD on the opening kickoff demonstrated
how things have changed on special teams, and the Falcons scored
two TDs of two turnovers 22 seconds apart in the third quarter.
Overall, Carolina had six turnovers.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; LIVING ON THE EDGE II &LR;  Last season, the Giants won the NFC East
at 10-5-1, making up for a dull offense with a solid defense and
the NFL's best turnover ratio _ plus-25.
	   This year, they're 2-3 with a turnover ratio of minus-2,
including an interception by Tampa Bay's Charles Mincy that gave
the Bucs what turned out to be an insurmountable 7-0 lead in their
20-3 victory.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; LIVING ON THE EDGE III &LR;  The Bears, who have led at halftime in
all four of their losses, finally figured out how to win _ get
behind. On Sunday, they overcame a 27-10 deficit to beat the Lions
31-27.
	   But they still have to do something about the third quarter _ in
five games they've been outscored 61-0.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; NFC LEAST: &LR;  With Arizona and Philadelphia losing to Oakland and
Denver Sunday, the AFC West has a 10-1 advantage over the NFC East.
The only NFC win was the Giants' 34-16 victory in San Diego a week
ago. Overall, the division is 2-13 against outside opponents, the
other win a 20-17 decision by the Cardinals over the Rams
	   At this rate, the Cowboys win the division by default, the
Giants and Cards can hang in if they stay close to .500, and the
Redskins (outscored 74-169) and Eagles (52-137) are racing for the
second draft pick (behind expansion Cleveland). At least they have
each other to play.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ With NATO attacks said to be only
days away, top U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke delivered a last-minute
warning Monday to Yugoslavia's president to halt his crackdown on
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo or face airstrikes. But Slobodan
Milosevic showed no signs of backing down. Following his meeting
with Holbrooke, Milosevic's office issued a statement denouncing
NATO threats as a ``criminal act'' that favored separatist ethnic
Albanian guerrillas. The statement, broadcast by government
television, said there had been no fighting in the Serbian province
for the past seven days and that the crisis represented no threat
to other countries in the southern Balkans. Holbrooke, the U.S.
ambassador-designate to the United Nations, said he sought to
convince Milosevic of ``the grave situation we are facing.''
Holbrooke planned to visit the Kosovo capital, Pristina, on Tuesday
for talks with ethnic Albanian leaders _ several of whom have
called openly for NATO intervention. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ U.S. officials worked behind the scenes Monday
on a multibillion-dollar bailout package for Brazil as President
Bill Clinton told top finance offiicals from 22 nations that more
must be done to combat a widening economic crisis. ``Every country
has a role to play,'' Clinton told finance ministers and central
bank presidents from the world's richest countries and a
representative group of developing nations. He specifically
mentioned the need for Japan to move quickly to jump-start its own
economy. Clinton opened the discussions, which were to focus on
three reports prepared by the 22 nations on recommended changes to
the global architecture. The recommendations concerned the need to
improve banking regulation and provide quicker, more accurate
financial data reports. (US-ECONOMIC CRISIS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ In a blend of constitutional solemnity and
partisan tension, the House Judiciary Committee met Monday to
consider whether to open an impeachment inquiry. The Republicans'
chief investigator laid out 15 alleged offenses by President Bill
Clinton. Chairman Henry Hyde opened the hearing with a call for
``an honest effort to do what is best for the country.'' Democrats
were quick to criticize the Republicans' plan for an open-ended
inquiry into Clinton's conduct that could go beyond the allegations
in Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's report. But they were unable
to get the Republican-dominated committee to agree to a narrower
investigation. (US-CLINTON-CONGRESS)
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ As U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's
left for another round of Mideast mediation, Israeli and the
Palestinian leaders both said they would not make concessions
unless the other side did. Albright was to make a two-day visit to
Israel and the Palestinian areas in the hope of closing the gap
between the two sides on the terms of a second Israeli troop
withdrawal in the West Bank. The United States hoped to close the
deal at a tripartite summit of U.S. President Bill Clinton, Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat in Washington. Albright was to meet Tuesday _ separately _
with Netanyahu and Arafat. Her visit is meant to lay the groundwork
for the Israeli-Palestinian summit in Washington sometime around
Oct. 15. (ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's former No. 2 leader,
wearing a neck brace, accused police Monday of treating him worse
than a criminal as he was ordered to face trial next month on four
charges of abusing his former powers. The High Court judge also
denied bail for Anwar Ibrahim, saying the politician might
interfere with witnesses before the Nov. 2 trial in a case that
will test the nation's judicial and political system. The former
deputy prime minister faces 14 years in prison if found guilty on
any count of abusing his powers. He is also accused of engaging in
illegal homosexual acts, charges that will be addressed in a
separate trial. Anwar, 51, has pleaded innocent to all the charges,
arguing that they were trumped up by political opponents. Last
week, he appeared in court with bruises on his face and hands,
saying police beat him in custody. (MALAYSIA-POLITICS)

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Blue-chip shares rebounded again Monday after
flirting with 1998's lows for a second session, but most stock
measures posted heavy losses amid doubts that anything will be done
to halt the global economic crisis. The Dow Jones industrial
average rallied back from an afternoon deficit of 232 points,
briefly edging into positive terrain before finishing 58.45 points
_ or by 0.75 percent _ lower at 7,726.24. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The dollar fell against major currencies Monday
as stocks swooned following a lack of concrete action from the
world's leading powers to rectify global economic hardships. In
late New York trading, the dollar weakened to 1.6315 German marks,
down from 1.6458 late Friday. The dollar also was changing hands at
134.25 yen, lower than 135.65 yen Friday. The dollar and U.S.
stocks took a hit Monday after a weekend meeting of International
Monetary Fund officials in Washington produced little in the way of
proposals for stemming the global financial crisis. (US-DOLLAR)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ U.S. officials worked behind the scenes Monday
on a multibillion-dollar bailout package for Brazil as President
Bill Clinton convened a meeting of officials from 22 nations
searching for ways to fight a widening economic crisis. Clinton has
called the crisis the biggest threat to the world's economy in 50
years. His presence at the special conference of finance leaders
from rich and developing nations, and the efforts to help Brazil,
are designed to send a reassuring signal to jittery markets. But
the effort so far has failed. (US-ECONOMIC CRISIS)
	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ Indian stocks fell more than 7 percent
Monday, as nervous investors feared the Unit Trust of India, the
country's largest mutual fund manager, would reduce its investment
in shares. A crowd of more than 100 people, many of them
middle-aged or retired investors, gathered at the office of the
mutual fund to sell shares. A police spokesman said there was no
violence. The Sensex of the Bombay Stock Exchange, the benchmark
index, fell 7.2 percent, to close at 2877.92 points from its
previous close of 3102.29. It was the sharpest drop since March
31,1997, when the index fell more than 8 percent in reaction to the
collapse of the United Front coalition government. (INDIA-SHARES)
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Raisio Group increased its eight-month
pretax profit this year by more than 15 percent, to 192 million
markkaa (dlrs 37.6 million), mainly due to sales of its
cholesterol-blocking margarine, the company said Monday. Net sales
from January to August also increased, to 3.4 billion markkaa (dlrs
658 million), from 3.2 billion markkaa during the same period last
year. The operating profit of the Benecol division, which makes the
cholesterol-blocking bread spread, more than tripled to 140 million
markkaa (dlrs 27.5 million), up from 37 million markkaa in 1997.
Raisio, one of Finland's largest food, animal feed and chemical
groups, is best known for Benecol that inhibits the absorption of
the health-threatening form of cholesterol. (FINLAND-EARNS-RAISIO)
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Some 2,000 protesters demonstrated
Monday outside the European headquarters of U.S. textile giant Levi
Strauss and Co., demanding a reversal of the apparel maker's plan
to close four plants in Belgium and France. Levi Strauss announced
last week it wants to cut some 1,560 jobs in three Belgian and one
French factory as part of a European restructuring plan. Unions
have demanded management save at least some of the jobs. Scuffles
broke out outside the European headquarters and police had to
intervene to keep protesters at bay. The company held a European
board meeting at the same time. (BELGIUM-LEVIS)

astronaut, Bernard Tapie, Thai Princess Rajanakarin and American
behinds; Some of the items may have moved as separates. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The ex-wife of Earl Spencer is trying ``for a
second bite of the cherry'' in suing the law firm that advised her
before her South African divorce, the firm argued in court Monday.
	   The London-based Family Law Consortium didn't handle the hearing
when a dlrs 3 million settlement was reached in South Africa in
December and said the Countess Spencer's negligence suit is an
abuse of court process and should be thrown out.
	   The former Victoria Lockwood was married to Princess Diana's
brother for eight years. They have four children.
	   Her dlrs 2.7 million lawsuit suggest that she could have won
dlrs 6.4 million if Family Law lawyer David Hodson had advised her
to sue for divorce sooner and in Britain. The press would have been
excluded in London from the hearing and publicity kept to a
minimum, she said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Duchess of York discussed life's crises,
including a few problems of her own, in her debut Monday as a talk
show host.
	   Prince Andrew's ex sat on a couch in a black pants suit and
talked with a woman raped by a serial killer and a hit-and-run
driver who confessed 20 years later.
	   She dedicated the first ``Sarah ... Surviving Life'' to her
mother, Susan Barrantes, who was killed Sept. 19 in a car accident.
	   ``Mum taught me so much about how to survive life,'' Fergie
said.
	   It was the first of 10, one-hour segments commissioned by Sky
TV. She's giving her dlrs 85,000 to charity but will get money for
the foreign rights.
	   The show was launched with a pile of newspaper interviews in
which she discussed her boyfriend, a still-married Italian count:
``There is certainly no engagement.''
	   ``Yes, of course he is my boyfriend and we are very close, yes,
and I love Italy,'' she said. ``But I am also, as you know, very
close to Andrew.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   NOORDWIJK, Netherlands (AP) _ As birthday presents go, this one
was out of this world.
	   Andre Kuipers, a doctor, was named the Netherlands' second-ever
astronaut on Monday, which also just happened to be his 40th
birthday.
	   State Secretary for Economic Affairs Gerrit Ybema made the
announcement at a space exposition in this North Sea coastal town.
	   Kuipers will join the European Space Agency as one of 16
European astronauts in training for scientific missions aboard a
dlrs 30 billion international space station.
	   Only two Dutchmen have been named astronauts. The first, Wubbo
Ockels, flew on U.S. missions, including one on Challenger just two
months before the shuttle exploded with a crew of seven in 1986.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ Former politician and sports tycoon Bernard Tapie,
convicted of rigging a soccer game, is pleading his innocence _
only this time in a French recording studio.
	   Tapie, who recently dabbled in cinema, has recorded a single _
``Life's Great'' _ with French rap star Doc Gyneco. It's due for
release on Oct. 23.
	   In the single, Gyneco asks Tapie, former owner of the Olympique
Marseille soccer team, whether it's true he paid the Valenciennes
team to throw a crucial game in 1993.
	   ``Are you kidding?'' replies Tapie, who spent six months in jail
in 1997. ``I love those Valenciennes people.''
	   Elsewhere, the stocky, 55-year-old rags-to-riches politician who
once owned the sportswear giant Adidas, says he was ``struck but
not sunk'' by the bribery charges.
	   The single will appear on Doc Gyneco's upcoming album,
``Dangerous Liaisons.''

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The elder sister of Thailand's
king, accompanied by 70 Buddhist monks, will attend a
robe-presentation ceremony in Malaysia on Wednesday as part of a
pilgrimage.
	   The Thot Krathin ceremony, involving visits to several Buddhist
temples in Southeast Asia, is being held in commemoration of the
72nd birthday of King Bhumibol Adulyadej.
	   The princess _ Galayani Vadhana Kromluang Narathiwat Rajanakarin
_ will fly in, attend the ceremony at the Wat Chetawan temple, and
leave the same day, Malaysia's Foreign Ministry announced.
	   During the ceremony, robes are presented to monks in gratitude
for maintaining and propagating the teachings of Buddha.

	   SEATTLE (AP) _ How big is the average American's behind?
	   The U.S. Coast Guard says it's 18 inches (46 centimeters). At
least that's the standard allotment per person on the ferry between
Seattle and a suburb, Vashon Island.
	   But officials say the posterior standard hasn't kept pace with
American's expanding bottom line.
	   Using the old standard, the Coast Guard measured benches on the
ferry boat Skagit and set the maximum load at 250 people.
	   But ferry officials noticed many of their passengers couldn't
squeeze in and were forced to sit in the aisles. They cut the
maximum capacity to 240.
	   They didn't cut enough. With passengers still squeezed out, they
cut the maximum down to 230.
	   ``Eighteen-inch butts are a thing of the past,'' said ferry
spokeswoman Susan Harris. ``We have all expanded.''

Indians' Gooden to visit Strawberry
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Darryl Strawberry remained hospitalized Monday,
recovering from cancer surgery but cheered by a visit from New York
Yankees teammates, who showed him the caps they will wear in his
honor during the American League championship series.
	   Strawberry had a 2 1/2-inch (6.4-cm) cancerous tumor removed
from his colon Saturday and remained hospitalized Monday at
Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. Doctors think the cancer had
not spread and were optimistic.
	   About half a dozen Yankees visited Strawberry on Sunday and more
said they were going following Monday's workout.
	   ``I couldn't have been more pleased,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre
said. ``Straw was very alert. He looked real good. I mean, he was
sitting up. Of course, the one complaint he had is he is not going
to be able to eat for a couple of days.
	   ``But he shook hands with everybody, and we really had to say,
`Let's go,' because he was chatting away.''
	   The players gave Strawberry a cap with his No. 39 stitched on
the back, and told him they plan to wear similar caps during the
playoff series against Cleveland.
	   Dwight Gooden, his close friend and former New York Mets
teammate, plans to visit Strawberry before the Yankees and Indians
play Game 1 on Tuesday night.
	   ``Any time you see a good friend like that go through something
like that,'' Gooden said, ``you feel for that person.''

NBA cancels entire preseason

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ After canceling the rest of its exhibition
schedule, the National Basketball Association's perfect record of
never missing a regular season game because of a labor dispute is
in serious jeopardy.
	   The league, which had earlier called off the first 24 exhibition
games, canceled the final 90 Monday because of stalled labor
negotiations with the players.
	   ``At this point, our teams cannot possibly be ready to play any
games before November,'' deputy commissioner Russ Granik said
Monday. ``It's sad that we have been unable to have any meaningful
negotiations.''
	   The next collective bargaining session is set for Thursday. The
league said decisions concerning possible cancellation of regular
season games would be made next week. The season is scheduled to
begin Nov. 3.
	   When the two sides finally meet again, they will have only a few
days to strike a deal that would preserve an 82-game schedule.
	   Once a new agreement is reached, it will take at least three
weeks to sign players, make trades and hold abbreviated training
camps. So unless a deal can be completed a few days after the sides
reconvene, there appears to be no way the season can start on its
scheduled date.
	   The owners made their latest proposal 10 days ago, still calling
for a system with an absolute ceiling on salaries _ or a ``hard''
salary cap. The union said the owners included 16 pages of new
demands that hadn't been discussed in any previous meetings.
	   ``Our proposals would result in an average player salary of more
than dlrs 3.1 million and a minimum salary for 10-year veterans of
dlrs 750,000,'' Granik said Monday. ``Unfortunately, the union
leadership has been unwilling to give any serious consideration to
what we have offered.''
	   Union officials had no immediate response.
	   Both sides await a ruling from arbitrator John Feerick on the
union's grievance over whether players with guaranteed contracts
should be paid during the lockout. Feerick's decision could come at
any time before Oct. 19.
	   The union plans to have players at about a dozen arenas Tuesday
to try to gain public support for their position.

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Dithering over an international plan to quell
turmoil in global financial markets led to wild stock volatility
Monday in Toronto and New York.
	   The Canadian dollar also made a dramatic slide backward, giving
up almost a half cent to close at 64.25 cents US as rumors swirled
about a possible election in Quebec at the end of next month.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average plunged more than 232 points in
afternoon trading before staging a stunning comeback. By the end of
the session, the index was down 58.45 points at 7,726.24.
	   The TSE 300 index also dropped about 200 points in the early
afternoon, but the late-day bargain hunting wasn't as brisk as it
was in New York. The index closed at 5,336.01, down 181.12 points,
wiping out Friday's 79-point gain.

	   OTTAWA (AP) _ The military's 30-year-old Labrador rescue
helicopters, grounded after a fatal crash last Friday, can still be
used in life-and-death emergencies, Defense Minister Art Eggleton
said Monday.
	   Opposition MPs urged the government to beg or borrow
replacements for the aging choppers to bridge the gap until new
Cormorant search-and-rescue aircraft come into service in two or
three years.
	   Eggleton said rescue work will continue, even while the fleet of
12 Labradors is grounded pending the results of an investigation
into the Quebec crash this weekend that killed six crewmen

	   TORONTO (AP) _ Health Canada cleared the way for The Body Shop
to sell its new line of hemp skin-care products on Monday, just
hours after the cosmetic giant publicly belittled the federal
agency for its anti-hemp stance.
	   ``I don't know of another member of the vegetable kingdom that
has been so maligned and misunderstood,'' Anita Roddick, founder of
The Body Shop International, told a news conference Monday
afternoon.
	   By day's end Health Canada, which issued a warning Friday
threatening to seize the hemp goods if they showed up in Body Shop
stores, had backed down.
	   On Friday, the agency had asked Body Shop management to disclose
the THC levels in its products, he said. After discussions Monday
between government and Body Shop officials, Health Canada concluded
the products are safe.
	   ---
	   OTTAWA (AP) _ Consumer, environmental and industry groups in
Canada and the U.S. say they now have more than enough evidence to
force their respective governments to ban the use of a growth
hormone that increases milk production in cows.
	   A leaked Health Canada report pointing to serious flaws in
studies assessing the safety of bovine somatotropin, or BST, is now
widely available, giving critics the ammunition they believe will
help their cause.
	   The internal report, posted on the National Farmers Union Web
site, is a damning review of what little evidence there is that BST
is safe for use in cows and for human consumption.
	   On the eve of Senate hearings into whether Canada should approve
BST use, Canadian farmers and anti-BST groups say the report will
figure prominently in their case to show the growth hormone should
never be approved in Canada.
	   ---
	   OTTAWA (AP) _ Solicitor General Andy Scott has already prejudged
the public inquiry into the 1997 Asia-Pacific summit and should
resign his job for doing so, says New Democrat MP Dick Proctor.
	   Proctor told the Commons on Monday he was sitting near Scott on
an airline flight from Ottawa to New Brunswick last week and
overheard the solicitor general tell a seatmate that ``at the end
of the day four or five Mounties will have been found to ... have
used excessive force.''
	   Proctor also quoted Scott as mentioning that he wanted to get
away from Ottawa to see the World Series but couldn't because he
had to be ``the cover'' for Prime Minister Jean Chretien.
	   Proctor conceded later, outside the House, that the meaning
wasn't entirely clear. Scott may simply have been saying he had to
cover for Chretien by acting as his stand-in to field opposition
questions in the Commons.

Australians praised for beating Pakistan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australia faces another Ashes cricket
series against old enemy England this year, but for now they have
achieved something much more than that contest can hope to deliver.
	   ``Hallelujah! At last, an unconditionally professional
Australian cricket team,'' wrote Mike Coward in The Australian
newspaper after Monday's first test victory by Australia in
Pakistan for 39 years.
	   Australia last won matches on Pakistani soil under Richie Benaud
when he claimed the 1959-60 series 2-1. There have been five
subsequent tours until this one, with Pakistan winning six matches,
Australia none and six drawn.
	   Captain Mark Taylor, who made several selection gambles before
the match, was widely praised for the innings and 99 run victory
which put his team 1-0 up in the three match series.
	   ``Australia has achieved some outstanding results under the
inspired leadership of Taylor in recent years but none has been
more memorable or satisfying than this,'' wrote Coward.
	   The victory was a sign that Australian players had matured and
improved their attitude to make success on the subcontinent
possible.
	   ``There is clear evidence that the paranoia which has beset
Australian teams to the region has been expunged _ the rat, riot
and rort mentality is finally something of the past,'' Coward
wrote.
	   Australia's press agreed the win means the country stands atop
the world cricket ladder.
	   ``For the first time in four decades Australia can stand proudly
and claim with substance that they can beat anyone anywhere,''
wrote Malcolm Conn in The Australian.
	   ``For all the misty-eyed fuss made about a string of Ashes
triumphs, they have been against soft English sides in relatively
soft conditions.''
	   Australia won without its No.1 bowler Shane Warne, who is
sidelined with a shoulder injury and is trying to regain fitness in
time to play England in the coming five test series.
	   ``There's no mixed emotions for me _ that's fantastic, the first
time they've won for 39 years,'' Warne said. ``Obviously it's
disappointing not being there, not being part of it, but good luck
to them.''
	   While Australia's victory was so convincing there were also
words of warning from The Age newspaper's cricket writer Greg Baum.
	   ``Still, and Taylor will know this, they must beware, for
Pakistan remain the most contrary team in cricket, never more
likely to win when all is seemingly lost,'' he wrote. The next two
tests will be played at Peshawar and Karachi.

Howard: not changing position on 10 percent sales tax on food
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Prime Minister John Howard said Tuesday
he will slap a 10 percent sales tax on food despite arguments from
the opposition that it unfairly hurts poor and working-class
families.
	   But the Australian Democrats, a third party that won the balance
of power in the Senate, insists there be no goods and services tax
on food, education expenses, and several other items if the support
the rest of Howard's tax reforms.
	   Howard and his governing conservative coalition barely won
re-election in Saturday's parliamentary polling, with opposition to
the new 10 percent goods and services tax being the main issue used
against them.
	   Counting of votes continues Tuesday, but the conservatives won
66 of the 148 House of Representatives seats to Labor's 62, with
one going to an independent. In undecided seats, the government is
leading in 12 out of 19.
	   In the old Parliament, the conservatives had held 91 seats to
Labor's 49.
	   Howard openly challenged the Democrats on Tuesday:
	   ``What I'm going to do is exactly what I said in the election
I'd do and I can't understand why people think I'd in any way
change my position,'' he told a radio station.
	   ``I read these amusing stories about how Howard's going to trade
off this or that. What Howard is going to do is exactly what he
said. He's going to call the Parliament together and he's going to
present the legislation,'' he said.
	   But Democrats leader Meg Lees said the party would not back down
on its insistence that a goods and services tax be taken off food.
	   ``There is a lot of work to do. They don't know as yet where
they're going to draw the line on things like health, education,
and I find it extraordinary that he wants to move this quickly,''
Lees said.
	   Australians, including church representatives, business groups
and the tourism and housing industries, would want to have a say.
	   The legislation could not be finalized before mid- to late 1999,
Lees said.
	   The Democrats would ensure the tax legislation was properly
scrutinized and the social and environmental impacts, as well as
the short-term economics, were taken into account.
	   Meanwhile, right-wing populist Pauline Hanson, who lost her own
House of Representatives seat in Saturday's election, will become
the paid president of the One Nation party she founded.
	   Hanson became famous across Asia and around the world for
blaming crime, disease and drugs in Australia on Asian immigrants
and calling for an end to Asian immigration.
	   She also wanted to abolish Aoriginal welfare progrfams, and
repeal the nation's stringent new gun control laws.

U.S. envoy warns Yugoslav president of NATO strikes

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ President Slobodan Milosevic is
denouncing NATO threats of airstrikes as a ``criminal act'' despite
a personal warning from a senior American envoy to halt his
crackdown in Kosovo province or face military attack.
	   Milosevic told special envoy Richard Holbrooke late Monday that
his government is willing to seek a ``political solution'' to the
seven-month crisis in Kosovo, where ethnic Albanian rebels are
battling for independence.
	   But he also said that ``threats of aggression ... are a criminal
act'' that provide ``support for the Albanian villains, not the
Albanian people,'' according to a statement broadcast by
television.
	   Holbrooke met with Milosevic for several hours late Monday,
telling the Yugoslav president of the ``the grave situation we are
facing.'' Holbrooke planned to visit the Kosovo capital Pristina on
Tuesday for talks with ethnic Albanian leaders _ several of whom
have called openly for NATO intervention.
	   ``The military planning is going forward on a serious, intense
and sustained basis as we talk,'' Holbrooke told reporters Monday
after the meeting. Asked if Milosevic got the message, Holbrooke
replied, ``you'll have to ask him that.''
	   Publicly, however, Milosevic and his government appeared
defiant. State television said the Yugoslav leader told Holbrooke
that ``a political solution is the only possible solution'' and
expressed hope ``that the international community will finally
contribute to reviving the political process instead of issuing
threats.''
	   Holbrooke, who negotiated the 1995 agreement that ended the
Bosnian war, was dispatched to the federal Yugoslav capital of
Belgrade in what appeared to be a last-ditch effort to persuade
Milosevic to halt his crackdown and enter talks with ethnic
Albanians on the future of the province.
	   Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
But ethnic Albanians form 90 percent of the 2 million-strong Kosovo
population, and many of them favor self-rule.
	   Hundreds have been killed and tens of thousands have been forced
from their homes since Milosevic launched his crackdown Feb. 28
against the secessionist Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   International efforts to solve the crisis accelerated after
reports that Serb police had massacred dozens of ethnic Albanian
civilians. Serb police deny the allegation.
	   In Brussels, Belgium, NATO officials said they were ready to
launch airstrikes within hours of receiving an order to attack. If
that first airstrike failed to deter Serb forces, a senior NATO
official said on condition of anonymity, the alliance could unleash
a ``fully fledged air campaign'' involving hundreds of planes.
	   Before arriving in Belgrade, Holbrooke conferred in Brussels
with senior NATO officials. Holbrooke said conditions in Kosovo had
not improved since the alliance started two weeks ago to finalize
plans for air raids to force Milosevic to halt his offensive
against Kosovo Albanian separatists.
	   In Washington, U.S. President Bill Clinton expressed concern
that Milosevic was ``playing the classic game of making false
promises'' to avoid NATO military strikes.
	   Clinton, in a telephone call with Russian President Boris
Yeltsin, said Milosevic's compliance with U.N. demands ``must be
verifiable, tangible and irreversible,'' press secretary Joe
Lockhart said at the White House.
	   ``What happens next depends on President Milosevic,'' Lockhart
quoted the president telling the Russian leader, who has opposed
the use of force against Moscow's longtime ally.
	   As Holbrooke tried to resolve the crisis through negotiations,
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said a decision on NATO
military action was imminent.
	   ``We are getting ready for NATO action and later this week we
will expect a decision to be taken,'' Cook told reporters after a
special session of the Cabinet called by Prime Minister Tony Blair.
	   At the United Nations, Secretary-General Kofi Annan said
Yugoslav forces increased their attacks on Kosovo's ethnic
Albanians even after a U.N. resolution Sept. 23 demanded a
cease-fire.
	   U.S. State Department spokesman James Foley said the Clinton
administration believed Milosevic had not met the conditions laid
down by the Security Council.
	   Briefing reporters in Washington, Foley cited the absence of a
formal cease-fire, the failure to arrange a meaningful dialogue
with ethnic Albanian leaders and the continued presence of ``major
army units'' in southeastern Kosovo near Albania's border.

Gas reconnected to more industry; Holden automakers go back to
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By ANDREW TROUNSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ More gas will flow to Victoria
state's industries Tuesday, but 1.4 million households have been
warned to wait for permission before turning their gas meters back
on later this week.
	   Gas started flowing to industry Monday, amid estimates the gas
crisis cost Victoria 100 million Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 58
million) a day with 150,000 workers stood down.
	   Victorian state Premier Jeff Kennett said supplies should flow
to all industrial gas users by Wednesday afternoon.
	   Domestic users could have gas services reconnected on Thursday,
Kennett said.
	   Millions of state residents are taking cold showers and using
electric griddles and frying pans to cook their food. Many
industries have had to suspend operations; funeral homes have
turned to bottled gas in order to keep crematoriums operating.
	   The state has opened sports stadiums and other public facilities
so people can shower there.
	   In Adelaide in neighboring South Australia, Holden auto factory
employees returned to work after a shutdown due to parts shortages
caused to Victoria's gas crisis.
	   Holden spokesman Geoff Weatherley said the factory had resumed
production and 4,300 production line workers would return to the
job Tuesday.
	   The state's gas supply was shut down after a massive explosion
10 days ago in one of three plants at Esso's Longford operation.
Two workers were killed and eight injured.
	   The facility, which takes gas and oil from the offshore Bass
Strait fields, supplies 98 percent of Victoria's gas demand.
	   Esso has so far been unable to determine the cause of the blaze
and explosions Sept. 25, which took two days to extinguish.
	   Victoria state is south of New South Wales, and Melbourne is
about 450 miles (720 km) southwest of Sydney.

US outlines its requirements for a `comprehensive review' on Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous to update with Unite States outlining its
position on comprehensive review. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The United States told the Security
Council on that there should be no predetermined outcome of any
``comprehensive review'' of Iraq's compliance with U.N.
resolutions.
	   In addition, the timing of a review should be based on Iraq's
resumed cooperation with inspectors _ not any fixed timeline,
according to the U.S. position contained in talking points by
deputy ambassador Peter Burleigh.
	   Burleigh outlined Washington's position during a briefing to the
council by Secretary-General Kofi Annan on his proposal for a
``comprehensive review'' to end the most recent impasse over arms
inspections.
	   Baghdad announced Aug. 5 it was halting cooperation with arms
inspectors who are searching for Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction. The move has paralyzed spot inspections in Iraq
because U.N. weapons experts must be accompanied by Iraqi escorts.
	   In a resolution last month, the Security Council said it would
consider conducting a comprehensive review of Iraq's seven-year
effort to disarm itself if Baghdad rescinded its Aug. 5 decision
and inspectors reported they could do their jobs again.
	   Iraq has indicated it wants a fixed timeline of when the review
would be carried out, and what it would do to ease 8-year-old
sanctions that have crippled its economy and halted its sales on
the open market of oil, its most valuable commodity, diplomats say.
	   The U.N. chief indicated to council members that Iraq could
reverse the decision if it was sure when a comprehensive review
would be carried out, a French official said, speaking on condition
of anonymity. The official noted, however, that the indication was
purely Annan's view after holding three meetings last week with
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz.
	   Annan was to meet again Wednesday with Aziz.
	   On Monday, Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan said that
Iraq's Aug. 5 decision ``is a decision which cannot be reversed.''
	   ``Iraq cannot go on bearing the injustice it has been subjected
to,'' Ramadan said. ``The status quo is totally unacceptable to
Iraq.''
	   The key issue shaping up within the council is when _ after
Baghdad reverses the decision _ the review would start. Several
council members say one to two weeks would be enough, but the
United States said six to eight weeks was more reasonable.
	   ``The length of time depends on the quality of the
cooperation,'' according to the outline of Burleigh's notes.
	   The review should cover all of Iraq's obligations, not just the
ones Iraq wants to discuss, Burleigh's notes say, adding that
issues specifically dealing with disarmament should be handled by
technical experts.
	   ``Under no circumstances will we accept a predetermined
outcome,'' the notes say. ``No promises should be made to Iraq with
respect to the outcomes of a review.''
	   He told reporters that the review must be factual in nature and
would evaluate ``every one of these resolutions and the state of
compliance or noncompliance of Iraq under all the requirements of
these resolutions going back to the period right after the Gulf
war.''
	   U.N. weapons experts must certify that Iraq has destroyed its
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons before the council will
lift sanctions imposed after Baghdad invaded Kuwait in 1990.

Kosovo awaits its fate in hostility and fear
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The guns have fallen largely silent
in Kosovo, but an atmosphere of hostility and fear envelops the
province as it awaits the judgment of the United Nations and NATO.
	   Has President Slobodan Milosevic done enough to avert punishing
airstrikes from the 16-nation NATO alliance, or will the United
States and its allies feel obliged to make a show of force to
coerce the tough Yugoslav leader to go even further?
	   Many ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of the population
in this poor southern province of Serbia, want NATO to send its
missiles and bombs.
	   ``The Kosovo people have been asking for NATO intervention for a
long time,'' said Enver Maloku, director of the Kosovo Information
Center.
	   Out on the streets of Pristina, capital of the province, Adam
Suliman was of the same opinion: ``This time NATO should take
action, because the population here is suffering.''
	   The minority Serbs, who rule the province, unsuprisingly
disagree.
	   ``There are no reasons for such an intervention,'' said Veljko
Odalovic, head of the local government. ``What is certain is that
if such a thing occurs, that will be a denial of the facts.''
	   Odalovic said NATO attacks ``mean direct support to the
terrorists,'' which is what Serbs call the rebel Kosovo Liberation
Army.
	   The United Nations has demanded that Milosevic call a
cease-fire, pull Serb Army and special police forces out of areas
where guerrilla groups are seeking independence from Yugoslavia and
negotiate with ethnic Albanians, perhaps returning the autonomy
they lost in 1989.
	   U.N. Secrerary-General Kofi Annan's report on Yugoslavia's
compliance did not make a clear judgment. However, NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana and officials in Washington felt it
was clear enough: noncompliance. The 15-member U.N. Security
Council was expected to take up the report Tuesday.
	   The ethnic Albanian political leadership has refused
negotiations until after airstrikes. Milosevic has pulled back some
police and army troops, but how much is still not clear.
	   Diplomats on the ground in Kosovo say the Serbs have observed an
informal cease-fire since last Thursday and that they were not
aware of any aggressive operations by government troops or police
against civilians or the KLA.
	   One diplomat, who spoke on condition he not be identified, said
there has been a significant redeployment of Yugoslav army troops
to Serbia, including a mechanized brigade that pulled out on
Sunday.
	   Some critics, including many Serbs, say that if NATO launches
airstrikes it will effectively become the KLA air force, helping
them accomplish what the rag-tag guerrilla fighters have not been
able to do in seven months of conflict with Serbian forces.
	   Military experts and political observers, however, say that's
simply not true.
	   The primary aim of any allied missile and bomb attacks would be
coercive, an attempt to force the tough Yugoslav leader to cease
his relentless crackdown on the Albanian population of this
southern Serbian province, where hundreds have died and hundreds of
thousands have been displaced.
	   ``I think NATO can carry out strikes and not militarily help the
KLA by hitting targets like air defense and command and control
centers,'' said Paul Beaver, a Balkans expert for Jane's Defense
Group in London.
	   ``If they started to attack heavy artillery on the ground, or
vehicles on the ground, however, that might help the KLA.''
	   Veton Surroi, a member of the ethnic Albanian negotiating team
in Kosovo, doesn't see any real advantage for the KLA either.
	   ``Anything that hurts Milosevic helps everybody else,'' he
acknowledged. But he added: ``The question is, help it do what? The
KLA doesn't have the force to create a substantially different
situation here.''
	   The KLA will no doubt get a morale boost out of NATO strikes,
but diplomatic observers noted that strong police forces remain in
place near most KLA strongholds and appear ready to keep them from
moving out.
	   What diplomats fear is that an allied air campaign against the
Yugoslav positions might lead Serb police to exact revenge on the
Albanians.
	   ``If there is a military strike, these guys could just go in and
whack, take off the gloves and go after them,'' said one diplomat.
``There are a lot of innocent Albanians out there that have already
been badly whacked.''

British tourist shot in Barbados is stable after surgery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRIDGETOWN, Barbados (AP) _ A British tourist who was shot
during a robbery in her hotel was in stable condition following
surgery to remove the bullet, hospital officials said.
	   Doctors removed the bullet from near Paula Bridges' heart on
Friday, and government officials have been visiting her at Queen
Elizabeth Hospital in Bridgetown.
	   Bridges was hit by a ricocheting bullet during a robbery of the
bar at the Palm Garden Hotel and Restaurant on Thursday. The
robbers fled the bar, and police believe they may have later robbed
a gasoline station.
	   Acting Prime Minister David Simmons promised ``a relentless
police pursuit of the perpetrators of the crime.''
	   A string of shooting deaths in Barbados this summer prompted the
government in August to increase the punishment for illegal
firearms possession. Maximum sentences were increased 10 times,
from two years in jail to 20 years.

Howard: not changing position on 10 percent sales tax on food
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Clarifies 2nd graf by restoring dropped letter in word `they.'
 &UR; By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Prime Minister John Howard said Tuesday
he will slap a 10 percent sales tax on food despite arguments from
the opposition that it unfairly hurts poor and working-class
families.
	   But the Australian Democrats, a third party that won the balance
of power in the Senate, insist there be no goods and services tax
on food, education expenses, and several other items if they
support the rest of Howard's tax reforms.
	   Howard and his governing conservative coalition barely won
re-election in Saturday's parliamentary polling, with opposition to
the new 10 percent goods and services tax being the main issue used
against them.
	   Counting of votes continues Tuesday, but the conservatives won
66 of the 148 House of Representatives seats to Labor's 62, with
one going to an independent. In undecided seats, the government is
leading in 12 out of 19.
	   In the old Parliament, the conservatives had held 91 seats to
Labor's 49.
	   Howard openly challenged the Democrats on Tuesday:
	   ``What I'm going to do is exactly what I said in the election
I'd do and I can't understand why people think I'd in any way
change my position,'' he told a radio station.
	   ``I read these amusing stories about how Howard's going to trade
off this or that. What Howard is going to do is exactly what he
said. He's going to call the Parliament together and he's going to
present the legislation,'' he said.
	   But Democrats leader Meg Lees said the party would not back down
on its insistence that a goods and services tax be taken off food.
	   ``There is a lot of work to do. They don't know as yet where
they're going to draw the line on things like health, education,
and I find it extraordinary that he wants to move this quickly,''
Lees said.
	   Australians, including church representatives, business groups
and the tourism and housing industries, would want to have a say.
	   The legislation could not be finalized before mid- to late 1999,
Lees said.
	   The Democrats would ensure the tax legislation was properly
scrutinized and the social and environmental impacts, as well as
the short-term economics, were taken into account.
	   Meanwhile, right-wing populist Pauline Hanson, who lost her own
House of Representatives seat in Saturday's election, will become
the paid president of the One Nation party she founded.
	   Hanson became famous across Asia and around the world for
blaming crime, disease and drugs in Australia on Asian immigrants
and calling for an end to Asian immigration.
	   She also wanted to abolish Aboriginal welfare programs, and
repeal the nation's stringent new gun control laws.

Dollar lower in Tokyo, Japanese stocks rise in early trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo stock prices rebounded in early trading
Tuesday on optimism the Japanese government will come up with new
stimulus steps to boost the economy. The U.S. dollar fell against
the yen.
	   The benchmark Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues rose
239.26 points, or 1.85 percent, to 13,187.38 in the first 30
minutes of trading.
	   On Monday, continued worries about the health of Japan's economy
sent the Nikkei down a sharp 275.57 points, or 2.08 percent. It
closed at 12,948.12, the lowest closing level since Jan. 30, 1986,
when it finished at 12,949.04.
	   The dollar bought 134.16 yen in early trading Tuesday, down 1.60
yen from late Monday in Tokyo and also below its late New York
level of 134.25 yen overnight.
	   On the stock market, the Nikkei started slightly lower but
quickly turned back into positive territory on futures-led
short-covering and bargain hunting following sharp falls in recent
recessions.
	   The market was was also encouraged by local news reports that
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's government will come up with a new
package of measures to bolster the economy as early as early next
month, traders said.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 7.47 points, or 0.75 percent, to 1,004.16. The
TOPIX closed down 17.33 points, or 1.71 percent, the day before.
	   Tokyo's rise came on the heels of volatile trading overnight on
Wall Street where the Dow Jones industrial average rallied back
from an afternoon deficit of 232 points to close Monday's session
58.45 points lower at 7,726.24.
	   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar moved lower following
overnight weakness in New York, where it fell after finance
ministers from the world's major economies failed to offer concrete
steps at their weekend meeting to relieve global financial turmoil.
	   Traders said expectations of lower U.S. Interest rates and the
overnight drop on Wall Street also weighed on the dollar in
overnight trading.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 0.750 percent from Monday's finish of 0.730
percent, driving its price down to 109.49 yen from 109.69 yen.

Trial for rebel leader escalates blood-letting in Sierra Leone

<TEXT>
	   KENEMA, Sierra Leone (AP) _ In chains and behind bars in Sierra
Leone's capital, Foday Sankoh still casts a dark shadow over this
lush West African country, where his name has become a catch-word
for savagery.
	   Sankoh, the charismatic and mysterious leader of Sierra Leone's
feared Revolutionary United Front, appeared in court Monday to
plead innocent to an array of charges ranging from murder, treason
and crimes against humanity.
	   To each count, he slowly and deliberately responded to the
judge: ``Not guilty, my lord. I'm innocent.''
	   In the countryside, however, his fanatical rebel followers have
been stepping up a macabre campaign of revenge _ ripping off limbs,
raping and slaying unarmed villagers.
	   That furor, witnesses and aid workers say, is Sankoh's
brainchild and now his legacy.
	   A rebel without a cause? Sankoh's goals are murky, but his
methods clear and often horrifying.
	   Blamed for sparking Sierra Leone's descent into civil war in
1991, Sankoh is an enigmatic man believed to be in his late 50s who
has attempted to topple several governments. He is revered by his
fighters but widely reviled and feared.
	   For years, he and his gunmen ran amok until he was arrested in
Nigeria in February 1997. He was held until August on gun-running
charges linked to the rebel war in Sierra Leone.
	   While in captivity, Sankoh was named deputy commander of a
military junta that took power in Sierra Leone May 1997. The rebels
had joined the military in launching the bloody coup.
	   The junta was ousted earlier this year, but Sankoh's rebels and
remnants of the military junta continue to wage war in the
countryside _ often targeting civilians.
	   Masa Koroma, a refugee in the quiet one-street town of Kenema in
Sierra Leone's diamond-rich Eastern Province, has witnessed the
terror.
	   When rockets and machine-gun fire crashed down on her village
near Kenema, Koroma was forced to flee.
	   ``I am still afraid,'' said Koroma, huddled with her four
children in a dusty warehouse where aid workers give shelter to
hundreds of women and children fleeing the fighting . ``I don't
know where my husband or the rest of my family is.''
	   At least 17 people were gunned down in another attack before
dawn last Thursday on the town of Joru, about an hour's drive
southeast of Kenema, witnesses and aid workers said. Hundreds of
old people, women and children fled, while some of the men
disappeared.
	   Women were raped in front of their loved ones and several
peoples' eyes were poked out with knives.
	   For months now, hospitals around the country have filled with
hapless civilians who had their arms and legs hacked off by rebels
bidding to expand their influence through fear.
	   Now, refugees from the latest massacres believe the rebels and
their allies have acquired a new battle-thirst from Sankoh's trial.
Among civilians weary from almost eight years of instability and
bloodshed, Sankoh's trial has opened up raw emotional wounds.
	   A self-proclaimed practitioner of traditional African magic who
in his fighting days wore robes of burlap, head-dresses resembling
the gnarled tresses of blond women and mystical beads for
protection, Sankoh is a colorful, but feared figure.
	   In battle, he has claimed to have a supernatural ability to stop
bullets and kill foes with the mere gaze of his eyes. Observers say
his threats _ often grisly and deadly _ are often executed by his
followers.
	   Former rebels say his loyalists are fanatical devotees who kill
and die on their leader's orders. In his absence, it is unclear who
controls the renegades, who have no clear goals and apparently do
not have a new public leader.
	   ``The rebels are stronger with him than they are without him,''
said 17-year-old Ansam Sadou, who was captured and enslaved by the
Revolutionary United Front in 1995 until he escaped last year.
	   Most observers believe Sankoh's followers use terror as a tactic
to force the government to release Sankoh.
	   ``If he is dead, the RUF has nothing to lose but to continue
fighting until they are dead,'' said Sadou. ``But if the government
lets him go, maybe it will let the rebels live too if they stop
fighting.''

Howard pushing ahead with 10 percent sales tax on food
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Prime Minister John Howard said Tuesday
he will slap a 10 percent sales tax on food despite arguments from
the opposition that it unfairly hurts poor and working-class
families.
	   But the Australian Democrats, a third party that won the balance
of power in the Senate, insists there be no goods and services tax
on food, education expenses, and several other items if they
support the rest of Howard's tax reforms.
	   Howard and his governing conservative coalition barely won
re-election in Saturday's parliamentary polling, with opposition to
the new 10 percent goods and services tax being the main issue used
against them.
	   Counting of votes continues Tuesday, but the conservatives won
66 of the 148 House of Representatives seats to Labor's 62, with
one going to an independent. In undecided seats, the government is
leading in 12 out of 19.
	   In the old Parliament, the conservatives had held 91 seats to
Labor's 49.
	   Howard openly challenged the Democrats on Tuesday:
	   ``What I'm going to do is exactly what I said in the election
I'd do and I can't understand why people think I'd in any way
change my position,'' he told a radio station.
	   ``I read these amusing stories about how Howard's going to trade
off this or that. What Howard is going to do is exactly what he
said. He's going to call the Parliament together and he's going to
present the legislation,'' he said.
	   But Democrats leader Meg Lees said the party would not back down
on its insistence that a goods and services tax be taken off food.
	   ``There is a lot of work to do. They don't know as yet where
they're going to draw the line on things like health, education,
and I find it extraordinary that he wants to move this quickly,''
Lees said.
	   Australians, including church representatives, business groups
and the tourism and housing industries, would want to have a say,
she said, adding that the legislation could not be finalized before
mid- to late 1999.
	   Lees added that the Democrats would ensure the tax legislation
was properly scrutinized and the social and environmental impacts,
as well as the short-term economics, were taken into account.
	   Meanwhile, right-wing populist Pauline Hanson, who lost her own
House of Representatives seat in Saturday's election, will become
the paid president of the One Nation party she founded.
	   Hanson became famous across Asia and around the world for
blaming crime, disease and drugs in Australia on Asian immigrants
and calling for an end to Asian immigration.
	   She also wanted to abolish Aboriginal welfare programs, and
repeal the nation's stringent new gun control laws.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Sony Corp. Chairman Norio Ohga has never been one
to keep his opinions to himself, and if there was ever a time for
sounding off now would certainly seem to be it.
	   Japan's economy _ the home market for the Walkmans and HandyCams
and other stuff Ohga's company sells _ is in its worst recession in
decades. Consumers are gloomy, companies are going under.
	   But unlike just about everybody else in this country, Ohga is
upbeat. Contrary to popular opinion, he says, Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi isn't so bad.
	   And Sony, thank you very much, is humming along just fine.
	   ``It's in the hard times that companies grow,'' Ohga said in an
interview.
	   A harsh critic of the fiscal reform-obsessed administration of
former Japanese leader Ryutaro Hashimoto, Ohga is guardedly
optimistic about his successor, Obuchi.
	   ``I think now things are better than they were under
Hashimoto,'' he said, noting Obuchi's willingness to grease the
wheels of the economy by boosting deficit spending. ``At the very
least, this Cabinet seems to understand.''
	   An accomplished opera singer, Ohga, 68, has never had much
trouble getting people's attention.
	   He is an unabashed maverick who can fly his own corporate jet,
speak German and boast of having conducted an orchestra before a
sellout crowd at New York's Lincoln Center.
	   His penchant for offering unsolicited advice is not a newly
acquired trait. It won him his first job at Sony back in the 1950s,
when he was taken on as an adviser because of his frank criticism
of the company's tape recorders while still a student.
	   He went on to help develop the compact disk and champion
MiniDisk technology.
	   Now, he has the government's ear as well, both as head of one of
Japan's best-known companies and as vice-chairman of Keidanren, the
nation's leading big business lobby.
	   Ohga has repeatedly voiced concerns about the government's
efforts to deal with the roughly dlrs 1 trillion in bad loans
racked up by Japanese banks.
	   Obuchi's ruling party and opposition forces have wrangled over
legislation to ease the banking crisis, debating whether ailing
banks should be rescued with taxpayer money.
	   Ohga believes Obuchi is on the right track, but says action must
be sped up.
	   ``Japan has got to act rapidly to prevent a worldwide
recession,'' he said, adding that ``as much public money as
necessary'' should be used to clean up the bad debt morass.
	   In the meantime, Ohga happily notes that his own backyard is the
picture of tranquility.
	   While other Japanese electronics makers will have trouble
avoiding red ink this year, Sony is flush with cash _ even though
it expects falling prices to start eroding profits after several
years of record earnings.
	   Sony's strength is partially due to the widely respected
managerial talents of Nobuyuki Idei, 60, who was named president
three years ago when Ohga became chairman.
	   The company has also been able to ride out the prolonged
economic slump in Japan with an old formula for success _ exporting
to more vibrant markets, the United States in particular.
	   Not so long ago, sales in the United States accounted for about
one-quarter of Sony's revenue stream. Ohga said American sales have
recently shot up to more than one-third of the total revenue,
making it Sony's biggest single market.
	   But that export formula, however good it may be for Sony's
bottom line, has been criticized as way of spreading around Japan's
economic woes.
	   The rub is that while exports may keep factories in Japan busy,
they threaten to undermine manufacturers in the overseas markets
where they are sold, and potentially drag those economies down as
well.
	   Some of that pressure may be eased as Sony diversifies its focus
away from its core electronics hardware division.
	   Though still best known for its televisions and video camera
recorders, non-hardware businesses have grown to about a third of
the company's sales in recent years.
	   The company has successfully branched out into areas such as
Hollywood film production, music recording and insurance. It now
plans to pioneer discount broker services in Japan.
	   That's a long leap from its roots as a manufacturer of cheap
portable transistor radios in the 1950s. But it's increasingly the
direction Ohga has charted for the company in his new role as
Sony's sole senior statesman.
	   Company co-founder Masaru Ibuka died last December at age 89 and
founding partner Akio Morita, perhaps the best known face of Sony,
has retired to Hawaii after suffering a debilitating stroke in
1993.
	   Some things never change, however.
	   ``We are always chasing after things that other companies won't
touch,'' Ohga said. ``That is a big secret to our success as a
company today.''

	   MONTERREY, Mexico (AP) _ Nearly two years after Mexico began
privatizing its railroads, the country is drawing a wave of new
foreign investment from the rail industry.
	   From the northern border states of Nuevo Leon and Coahuila to
central Mexico, freight car and locomotive manufacturers, along
with related businesses, are expanding operations.
	   It is the direct result of the Mexican government's move to
auction the nation's 16,000-mile (25,600-kilometer) freight rail
system.
	   ``Rail was not a growth industry in Mexico before
privatization,'' said Raleigh Sheffield, a consultant to several
major freight haulers in the country. ``The government was just not
buying new equipment.''
	   But now Mexico's new private rail operators are on a spending
spree. They have pledged more than dlrs 1 billion over the next
five years to upgrade their fleets of locomotives and rail cars in
a bid to boost market share, which is now about 12 percent of
freight traffic compared to nearly 40 percent in the United States.
	   The massive upgrade has sparked a rush among companies that
build and service locomotives, rail cars and their component parts,
including GE Transportation Systems Inc., the rail car division of
Trinity Industries Inc., MotivePower Industries Inc. and France's
Alsthom.
	   ``It's major investment from all directions,'' said Gilbert
Carmichael, vice chairman of MotivePower.
	   Under Ferrocariles Nacionales de Mexico, the national railroad,
the system had outdated equipment and a chronic shortage of rail
cars as well as slow and unpredictable service and a high theft and
damage rate.
	   ``When times were good and the government had the money, they
invested in locomotives, and we sold hundreds and hundreds,'' said
Dave Tucker, general manager of global service for GE
Transportation Services. But in tough times, investment in the rail
system was not a national priority.
	   That changed with the privatization, when equipment upgrades
became a necessity for the new owners of the nation's three major
railroads.
	   At issue is competitiveness. Newer locomotives are more fuel
efficient and powerful, and therefore able to pull longer trains _
a key factor in lowering costs to compete with ships and trucks.
	   In addition, the new railroads need to buy or rent additional
cars and to increase the number of specialized models _ such as
those used to haul grain and coal _ to be competitive.
	   Xavier Garcia de Quevedo, president of railroad Grupo
Ferroviario Mexicano SA, a consortium that paid dlrs 527 million
for Mexico's Pacific-North Railway in June 1997, said the company
will have invested dlrs 131 million in infrastructure by the end of
this year and has plans for dlrs 150 million in 1999.
	   Ferromex, as the railroad is known, is building on its current
locomotive fleet of 454 _ considering models from GE Transportation
Systems and the Electro-Motive Division of General Motors. The plan
is to buy nine more this year, rent 34, and purchase an additional
50 in 1999, Garcia said.
	   Besides replacing those engines that are in ``a bad state,'' the
railroad _ a partnership between Grupo Mexico SA, Empresas ICA SA
and Union Pacific _ is expecting another year of double-digit
growth.
	   Also on an expansion tear is Transportacion Ferroviaria
Mexicana, or TFM, the partnership between Mexico's Transportacion
Maritima Mexicana SA and Kansas City Southern Industries. The
partners took control of the country's Northeast Railway in
November 1996 for dlrs 1.4 billion.
	   TFM budgeted more than dlrs 700 million in investment between
1997 and 2002. A company official said the railroad is in the
process of buying 150 new locomotives _ divided evenly between GE
and GM _ for about dlrs 2 million each.
	   The third biggest block of investment is from construction firm
Grupo Tribasa SA, which operates the country's Southeast line.
	   With investments on this scale, it was just a matter of time
before the companies that service and make engines, cars and
component parts would head south. ``There is just unbelievable
potential for growth,'' said GE's Tucker.

Industry in Australia's Victoria state to get more gas
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANDREW TROUNSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ More gas will flow to Victoria
state's industries Tuesday, but 1.4 million households have been
warned to wait for permission before turning their gas meters back
on later this week.
	   Victoria's gas supply was shut down after a massive explosion 10
days ago in one of three plants at Esso's Longford operation. Two
workers were killed and eight injured.
	   Gas started flowing to industry Monday, amid estimates the
crisis cost Victoria 100 million Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 58
million) a day with 150,000 workers stood down from work.
	   Victorian state Premier Jeff Kennett said supplies should flow
to all industrial gas users by Wednesday afternoon, while domestic
users could have gas services reconnected on Thursday.
	   Millions of state residents are taking cold showers and using
electric griddles and frying pans to cook their food. Many
industries have had to suspend operations; funeral homes have
turned to bottled gas in order to keep crematoriums operating.
	   The state has opened sports stadiums and other public facilities
so people can shower there.
	   In Adelaide in neighboring South Australia, Holden auto factory
employees returned to work after a shutdown due to parts shortages
caused to Victoria's gas crisis.
	   Holden spokesman Geoff Weatherley said the factory had resumed
production and 4,300 production line workers would return to the
job Tuesday.
	   The facility, which takes gas and oil from the offshore Bass
Strait fields, supplies 98 percent of Victoria's gas demand.
	   Esso has so far been unable to determine the cause of the blaze
and explosions Sept. 25, which took two days to extinguish.
	   Victoria state is south of New South Wales, and Melbourne is
about 450 miles (720 km) southwest of Sydney.

Albright sees Netanyahu, Arafat; says time is runnign out
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Stands as Recap to US-Mideast. Lead expected after
Albright-Netanyahu meeting at 0800 GMT. &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY SCHWEID &QC; 
 &UR; AP Diplomatic Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ With the admonition that ``time is running
out,'' Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is holding
back-to-back meetings with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
	   Her aim is to narrow differences on a West Bank accord before
President Bill Clinton hosts a summit with the two Mideast leaders
later in the month.
	   ``There is a sense of urgency,'' Albright said on her way to
Jerusalem Monday from Washington for two days of talks.
	   ``The United States can do a great deal, but the leaders have to
be willing to make decisions,'' Albright said.
	   But Netanyahu said there would be no agreement for an Israeli
pullback unless the Palestinian Authority carried out its
commitment to clamp down on Islamic militants opposed to the peace
process.
	   And Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, speaking to Associated
Press Television News in the West Bank town of Jericho, accused the
Clinton administration of allowing Israel to drag its feet on
living up to past accords.
	   If Albright is unable to bridge the differences, Clinton could
come up short in his bid to play peacemaker in the Middle East as
he successfully did in Northern Ireland.
	   ``I don't expect her to come back with all the issues
resolved,'' State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said Monday.
	   Albright's aim is to ``whittle away, clear some underbrush'' to
set the stage for intensive negotiations in Washington, he said.
	   Clinton brought Netanyahu and Arafat to the White House last
week to try to set up a timetable for forging an agreement.
	   After months of U.S. prodding, Netanyahu has agreed to
relinquish 13 percent of the West Bank, with 3 percent turned into
a nature preserve under joint Israeli-Palestinian security.
	   Arafat said he had accepted the arrangement. But Netanyahu made
it clear an accord was conditional on Palestinian territory not
being used to launch attacks against Israeli civilians.
	   The Palestinian Authority has said it is working to contain
militant groups like Hamas, but that even its best efforts cannot
provide an ironclad guarantee against attacks.

Broadcasting watchdog says its OK to call Japan ``the enemy''
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ New Zealand's broadcasting
watchdog agency said Tuesday that a conservative talk radio host
may call Japanese `the enemy'' but he pushed the limits by calling
them `the meanest spirited people in the world.''
	   The Broadcasting Standards Authority rejected a complaint from a
listener to John Banks' Radio Pacific show, who objected to the
radio host and National Party member of Parliament's remarks on
July 31 about Japan.
	   In a discussion about New Zealand's stance on visits by
nuclear-powered warships, Banks said it did not make sense to turn
away American warships but to allow Japanese warships to visit.
	   He recalled World War II when the United States had been New
Zealand's ally and Japan the enemy. He referred to Japan several
times as ``the enemy'' during the three-hour show.
	   Listener Taeko Knight complained his remarks were `ignorant and
irresponsible'' and that his intention was to show his dislike for
the Japanese and to provoke negative feelings towards them in New
Zealand.
	   Radio Pacific said Banks was expressing his own opinion and that
talk radio was a ``robust medium'' and listeners could respond
immediately if they did not agree.
	   The authority said that while Banks' comments revealed his
prejudices, they appeared to have little support from listeners who
failed to respond to his calls for comment.
	   His references to Japan as the ``enemy'' did not encourage
denigration or discrimination of the Japanese, and even though his
description of them as ``the meanest spirited people in the world''
was borderline, it was still only a personal opinion so did not
breach standards, the authority said.

Rockies sign Leyland to three-year pact as manager
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DENVER (AP) _ The Colorado Rockies signed former Florida Marlins
manager Jim Leyland to a three-year contract Monday night.
	   ``Mr. Leyland has agreed to a three-year contract to manage the
Rockies through the year 2001. He will be introduced at a press
conference Wednesday morning at Coors Field,'' said Rockies public
relations director Jay Alves.
	   Rockies owner Jerry McMorris and general manager Bob Gebhard met
with Leyland in Pittsburgh on Monday where the deal was made.
	   Terms of the contract were not announced.
	   Leyland, 53, replaces Don Baylor, the only manager Colorado had
in its six-year history, who was fired a week ago.
	   Leyland led the Marlins to the World Series championship in
1997, his only year with the franchise. However, the team stumbled
to a 54-108 record this season as the roster was decimated by moves
aimed at keeping the payroll low. Leyland exercised an escape
clause and resigned from Florida last week. He told the Los Angeles
Dodgers earlier this week he wasn't interested in their manager's
post.
	   Earlier, Detroit Tigers general manager Randy Smith said he
contacted Leyland about their manager's job.
	   Leyland managed the Pittsburgh Pirates from 1986 until 1996,
reaching the National League championship series three times.

Australia's Downer says Asia will welcome Hanson's defeat
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Australia-Politics
 &UR; By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Right-wing populist Pauline Hanson's
departure from Parliament will be warmly welcomed in the Asian
region, Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said Tuesday.
	   Hanson became famous across Asia and around the world for
blaming crime, disease and drugs in Australia on Asian immigrants
and calling for an end to Asian immigration.
	   She also wanted to abolish Aboriginal welfare programs, and
repeal the nation's stringent new gun control laws.
	   The One Nation party leader almost certainly lost the seat of
Blair in Saturday's federal election, though her party drew about 8
percent support nationwide.
	   The only One Nation candidate to get elected was Heather Hill in
the Senate, who happened to oust the only Australian senator of
Asian heritage, Bill O'Chee.
	   Downer said Hanson's ouster would help Australia's image in
Asia, adding that relations with regional neighbors were fine.
	   ``It's a question of the image of Australia having this emergent
racist party which is extremely unhelpful,'' he told Australian
Broadcasting Corp. radio.
	   ``Pauline Hanson's departure will be warmly welcomed in the
region. It'll be good for Australia for her to have gone,'' he
said.
	   Most international newspapers that commented on Australia's
election have focused on Hanson's repudiation.
	   From Bangkok, Thailand, The Nation newspaper said:
	   ``There are two pieces of good news coming out of last weekend's
election in Australia. First, the demise of the ultra-conservative
and racist One Nation party led by maverick Pauline Hanson. Second,
the return of John Howard's coalition government.
	   In Beijing, however, The People's Daily warned that although
Hanson failed in the election, the vote shows her party has a
support rate of over 7 percent.
	   ``This shows that in Australia it represents a political power
that cannot be disregarded _ something that causes unease and puts
people on alert.''
	   But Hong Kong's South China Morning Post said the ``specter of a
divided country, driven by ethnic conflicts should now permanently
disappear.''
	   ``Ms. Hanson's strident calls for an end to Asian immigration
and cuts to aboriginal welfare schemes damaged the country's
international image,'' the editorial said.
	   ``Her platform was founded on the familiar theme of blaming
minorities for economic ills, but, as recent events in Indonesia
have shown, that is by no means confined to Australia.''
	   In London, The Guardian newspaper said Monday that while the
good news was that ``Pauline Hanson and her One Nation party have
come a cropper,'' the internal problems exposed in Australia by the
rise of One Nation would remain.
	   Rupert Murdoch's The Times cheered the result and gave Howard
most of the credit for One Nation's poor showing, which it said was
``critically important'' to social harmony and race relations in
Australia, and to the country's image abroad.
	   But The Financial Times said the racial tensions on which One
Nation thrived would not go away _ ``Indeed, they could intensify
as the economy weakens under the impact of the Asian economic
crisis.''

Austerity measures to test real strength of Cardoso's popularity
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous to CLARIFY that Cardoso appazeNply the winner,

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ After apparently winning re-election,
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso must now put his popularity
through an even tougher test _ harsh austerity measures needed to
break Brazil's economic meltdown.
	   Returns from the interior, where the government historically
does well, overwhelmingly showed Caroso ahead in Sunday's election.
He must win more than half the vote to avoid a second-round runoff
_ a feat he is expected to easily accomplish.
	   Cardoso's evident re-election was made possible by a
constitutional amendment passed in 1997 that for the first time
allowed presidents, governors and mayors to be re-elected. Cardoso
pushed the amendment through, arguing his re-election was essential
to maintain Brazil's newfound economic stability.
	   Now, that stability is threatened and Cardoso must rein in the
international financial crisis that began in Asia and is now poised
to strike his country.
	   The prospect that the re-elected Cardoso may delay any
announcement of belt-tightening measures needed to stabilize
Brazil's economy until a second round of voting occurs Oct. 2
helped lead the Brazilian stock markets lower Monday, closing off
4.5 percent in Sao Paulo and 3.4 percent in the smaller Rio de
Janeiro exchange.
	   While Cardoso was expected to easily win re-election, some
regional posts faced the prospect of a second round.
	   The United States and other major industrialized nations, deeply
concerned about Brazil, worked Monday on a multibillion-dollar
bailout package as U.S. President Bill Clinton convened a meeting
in Washington of officials from 22 nations trying to overcome the
economic crisis.
	   The financial crisis, which already has prompted the IMF to
assemble more than dlrs 100 billion in bailouts for Thailand,
Indonesia, South Korea and Russia, created a distinctly somber mood
at this year's meetings.
	   With 69.17 percent of the ballots counted Monday, Cardoso was
leading with 51.5 percent. His closest rival, Luiz Inacio Lula da
Silva of the leftist Workers Party had 34 percent, while Ciro Gomes
of the Popular Socialist Party had 11 percent. Nine other
candidates shared the remainder.
	   Electoral officials announced that with the latest result, all
the votes placed on electronic voting machines had been counted,
leaving only paper ballots to be tallied _ a task they did not
expect to finish until Friday.
	   A Cardoso victory will be no surprise to the 106 million
Brazilians who voted for president, 27 governors, all 513 federal
deputies, one-third of the 81-seat Senate and 1,405 state
legislators. Cardoso was the front-runner for the entire campaign.
	   Argentine President Carlos Menem called Cardoso on Sunday
evening to congratulate him on his apparent victory, saying Cardoso
would provide continuity in the ongoing construction of the
regional trade bloc Mercosur.
	   To most observers, Cardoso has received a clear mandate not only
to run Latin America's largest nation for the next four years, but
also to protect its economy from the financial turmoil rocking
emerging countries, including Brazil.
	   ``In re-electing Cardoso, voters clearly demonstrated their
confidence in his political leadership and his ability to steer
Brazil through the world financial crisis,'' said Carlos Esteban
Martins, a political scientist at the University of Sao Paulo.
	   Cardoso's popularity is largely the result of the success of the
``Real Plan,'' the economic stabilization plan he helped put
together in 1994 when he was finance minister. It dropped inflation
from around 2,400 percent a year to near zero now.
	   Since its introduction, the Real Plan has been shored up by high
interest rates and an overvalued real, the Brazilian currency.
Together, they guaranteed price stability, but caused recession,
unemployment and public and trade deficits.
	   And now, like other emerging markets, Brazil is suffering from a
loss of investor confidence and a strong outflow of capital. The
country's foreign reserves have fallen below dlrs 50 billion from
the dlrs 70 billion posted at the end of July.

DNA records of native animals taken to stem illegal trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Queensland will use DNA
fingerprinting of birds and animals to stem illegal trading in
wildlife.
	   Initially, the database will concentrate on four species of
birds and one reptile popular with overseas buyers.
	   High prices are paid to smugglers for golden-shouldered parrots,
red-tailed black cockatoos, yellow-tailed black cockatoos, glossy
black cockatoos and green pythons.
	   The state government and the Queensland University of Technology
had teamed up to develop a database to check if protected species
were bred in captivity or bought legally through licensed dealers,
Natural Resources Minister Rod Welford said Tuesday.
	   ``As the database broadens we'll have a foolproof method of
catching that small group of unscrupulous and unprincipled people
who flout the law and try to profit from the sale of protected
wildlife,'' Welford said.
	   Test samples will be taken from wildlife bred in captivity and
from the wild to establish a range of genetic fingerprints,
professor Peter Timms of the university's School of Life Sciences
said.
	   Welford said authorities had faced problems tracing and proving
the origin of wildlife thought to be traded illegally, and the DNA
testing was ``a fantastic step'' in safeguarding Australian fauna.

UN review would force inspectors to prove Iraq still holding
</HEADLINE>
weapons &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with UN chief proposal for
comprehensive review. No pickup &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. chief has outlined his proposal
for a ``comprehensive review'' of Iraq's compliance with U.N.
resolutions, suggesting it now be up to U.N. arms inspectors to
prove that Iraq hasn't completely disarmed itself.
	   If accepted by the Security Council, Secretary-General Kofi
Annan's recommendation would represent a major shift in the way
U.N. arms experts have worked for the past seven years. The
proposal, presented Monday night, puts the onus on the inspectors
to produce evidence that Iraq still has weapons of mass
destruction.
	   Previously, Iraq had to provide evidence of cooperation.
Inspectors have told the council that while they haven't found
evidence that Iraq still has such weapons, they can't be sure that
the evidence doesn't exist.
	   That argument, boosted by charges that Iraq had developed an
advanced concealment program to keep evidence from inspectors, has
been sufficient for the council to agree to keep sanctions on Iraq,
depriving it of its most valuable commodity, oil.
	   It wasn't clear if the council would go along with Annan's
proposal. Other elements of the plan could be troubling, such as
his asking the council _ not inspectors _ to make a final list of
what Iraq needs to do to have sanctions lifted and stating when
that day might come.
	   In outlining its position Monday, the United States flatly
objected to any ``predetermined outcome'' of a review.
	   U.N. weapons experts must certify that Iraq has destroyed its
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons before the council will
lift sanctions imposed after Baghdad invaded Kuwait in 1990,
touching off the Gulf War.
	   Baghdad announced Aug. 5 it was stopping inspections because the
chief U.N. inspector, Richard Butler, refused to certify Iraq had
destroyed its banned weapons.
	   In a resolution last month, the Security Council said it would
consider conducting a comprehensive review of Iraq's effort to
disarm itself if Baghdad rescinded its Aug. 5 decision.
	   Annan briefed the council Monday on his thoughts on how the
review should be carried out. The council doesn't have to accept
his proposal, and could make changes to it.
	   Annan has been meeting with Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq
Aziz to discuss the proposal, and a decision from Baghdad on
whether to accept it was expected after Aziz returns home following
a Wednesday meeting with Annan.
	   In his report, Annan suggested the review be carried out ``a few
weeks at most'' after Iraq reverses its decision.
	   The United States, according to briefing notes read to the
council Monday by deputy ambassador Peter Burleigh, says the review
should come once inspectors have reported that they can do their
jobs _ some six to eight weeks later. ``The length of time depends
on the quality of the cooperation,'' his notes say.
	   Annan said the review would be conducted in two parts: The first
phase would be to define a course of action and timetable that
``would be so designed as to make it possible for the Security
Council to satisfy itself whether all the necessary conditions for
lifting the oil embargo have been fulfilled.''
	   The first phase would determine if Iraq still has weapons of
mass destruction or was trying to rebuild them; confirm allegations
of non-compliance; establish a timetable to investigate remaining
issues and answer whether Iraq still constitutes a military threat
to the region.
	   The U.N. Special Commission and the International Atomic Energy
Agency _ which conduct inspections _ would submit reports detailing
Iraq's achievements in destroying its banned weapons, the proposal
states. They would also report on what needs to be done and the
time it should take. They would provide ``relevant evidence'' to
substantiate charges that Iraq hasn't fulfilled its disarmament
obligations.
	   Iraq would be invited to provide its own account of how it has
complied.
	   With all that information, the council would list the remaining
requirements to be fulfilled by Iraq as a condition of lifting
sanctions, with a timeframe established, Annan's proposal says.

Japan says economy will shrink for a second straight year

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Sharp declines in spending on new homes and
factories forced the Japanese government to reverse an earlier
forecast Tuesday and predict that its economy would contract for a
second straight year.
	   The revision comes as Tokyo struggles to meet international
demands that it do more to resuscitate its recession-hit economy
and ease the Asian financial crisis.
	   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi ordered his Cabinet to look into new
measures _ which may include new income tax cuts _ to supplement an
earlier 17 trillion yen (dlrs 126 billion) economic stimulus
package, government spokesman Hiromu Nonaka said.
	   ``The world economy is facing a crisis that can't be ignored,''
Obuchi said Tuesday in Parliament, where lawmakers were debating
bills to clean up Japan's biggest economic headache, its teetering
banking system.
	   ``Reviving the economy is our biggest task,'' Obuchi said.
	   The Economic Planning Agency said it now believes the world's
second-largest economy will shrink by 1.8 percent this year,
revising a previous forecast of 1.9 percent growth.
	   The contraction would mark the first time the economy has
declined two years in a row since 1955, when the government started
calculating the gross domestic product _ the sum of all goods and
services produced within the country.
	   The rate of contraction would also be much steeper than this
year's minus 0.7 percent growth, suggesting Japan's economic slide
may only be gathering speed.
	   The EPA's report offered little optimism that Japan's economy
will return to growth in the near future. The problems cited
include:
	   _ Faltering domestic demand for new goods and services, which is
expected to drop by 2.4 percent in the current fiscal year ending
March 1999.
	   _ A fall in demand for new housing. The EPA now sees spending
tumbling 11.6 percent compared to its previous estimate of a 4.9
percent increase.
	   _ Less investment by businesses in new factories and equipment.
Such spending is now seen down 10.1 percent this year, its worst
showing in five years.
	   The EPA predicted the shrinking economy will cause more
bankruptcies and corporate belt-tightening, driving the
unemployment rate to 4.2 percent for the year from last year's 3.3
percent. That would be the highest yearly rate on record.
	   The revision also showed that the slowdown in spending threatens
to push the economy into a deflationary spiral, a 1930s-style
crisis where the bottom falls out on wages and prices. The agency
said it expects wholesale prices to slide 1.7 percent this year.
	   The agency said the one bright spot was exports.
	   It said overseas demand for Japanese products is expected to
rise 0.6 percent, driving up the country's current account surplus
_ the broadest measure of trade _ to 16.6 trillion yen (dlrs 122
billion) from its earlier forecast of 12.4 trillion yen (dlrs 92
billion).

Japanese stocks rise in morning trading, dollar lower
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with morning stock close, bond and dollar rates,
trader quote &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo stock prices rebounded in morning trading
Tuesday on optimism the Japanese government will come up with new
stimulus steps to boost the slumping economy. The U.S. dollar fell
against the yen.
	   The benchmark Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues rose
183.94 points, or 1.42 percent, to 13,132.06 by the end of the
morning session at 11 a.m. (0200 GMT).
	   On Monday, worries about the health of Japan's economy sent the
Nikkei down a sharp 275.57 points, or 2.08 percent. It closed at
12,948.12, the lowest closing level since Jan. 30, 1986, when it
finished at 12,949.04.
	   The dollar bought 133.69 yen at 11 a.m. (0200 GMT) Tuesday, down
2.07 yen from late Monday in Tokyo and also below its late New York
level of 134.25 yen overnight.
	   On the stock market, the Nikkei started slightly lower but
quickly turned back into positive territory on futures-led
short-covering and bargain hunting following sharp falls in recent
sessions.
	   ``There are also expectations for additional economic stimulus
measures,'' said Yasuo Ueki, a general manager at Nikko Securities
Co.
	   The government drastically slashed its official economic growth
forecast for the current fiscal year on Tuesday, saying it expects
gross domestic product to shrink by 1.8 percent.
	   The new figure, released by the Economic Planning Agency,
represents a stark turnaround from the government's initial
forecast for 1.9 percent growth, and fueled expectations that Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi would come up with a supplementary budget
larger than originally planned.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 5.72 points, or 0.57 percent, to 1,002.41. The
TOPIX closed down 17.33 points, or 1.71 percent, the day before.
	   Tokyo's rise came on the heels of volatile trading overnight on
Wall Street where the Dow Jones industrial average rallied back
from an afternoon deficit of 232 points to close Monday's session
58.45 points lower at 7,726.24.
	   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar moved lower following
overnight weakness in New York, where it fell after finance
ministers from the world's major economies failed to offer concrete
steps at their weekend meeting to relieve global financial turmoil.
	   Traders said expectations of lower U.S. interest rates and the
overnight drop on Wall Street also weighed on the dollar in
overnight trading.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 0.755 percent at midday from Monday's
finish of 0.730 percent, driving its price down to 109.44 yen from
109.69 yen.

Earthquake strikes Tibet again
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A strong earthquake jolted a sparsely populated
county in Tibet, but there were no reports of casualties, state-run
media said Tuesday.
	   The quake with a preliminary magnitude of 5.2 struck Xainza
county shortly before 6:30 p.m. (1030 GMT) Monday, the Xinhua News
Agency reported.
	   It was the second earthquake in six days to hit Xainza, about
300 kilometers (180 miles) northwest of the Tibetan capital of
Lhasa. Over the weekend quakes of similar strength hit the Xinjiang
region and Yunnan province, which both border Tibet.

Gas reconnected to more industry; Holden automakers go back to work
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Updates with Mitsubishi planning to reopen next week. &QL; 
 &UR; By ANDREW TROUNSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ More gas will flow to Victoria
state's industries Tuesday, but 1.4 million households have been
warned to wait for permission before turning their gas meters back
on later this week.
	   Gas started flowing to industry Monday, amid estimates the gas
crisis cost Victoria 100 million Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 58
million) a day with 150,000 workers stood down.
	   Victorian state Premier Jeff Kennett said supplies should flow
to all industrial gas users by Wednesday afternoon.
	   Domestic users could have gas services reconnected on Thursday,
Kennett said.
	   Millions of state residents are taking cold showers and using
electric griddles and frying pans to cook their food. Many
industries have had to suspend operations; funeral homes have
turned to bottled gas in order to keep crematoriums operating.
	   The state has opened sports stadiums and other public facilities
so people can shower there.
	   In Adelaide in neighboring South Australia, Holden auto factory
employees returned to work after a shutdown due to parts shortages
caused to Victoria's gas crisis.
	   Holden spokesman Geoff Weatherley said the factory had resumed
production and 4,300 production line workers would return to the
job Tuesday.
	   Meanwhile, Mitsubishi expects to fully reopen its two Adelaide
plants next week as planned after the gas shortage forced the
company to shut down production here.
	   Mitsubishi Motors Australia public relations manager Kevin
Taylor said about 2,000 employees would return to work this week,
with the remaining 3,000 workers to return next Tuesday.
	   The state's gas supply was shut down after a massive explosion
10 days ago in one of three plants at Esso's Longford operation.
Two workers were killed and eight injured.
	   The facility, which takes gas and oil from the offshore Bass
Strait fields, supplies 98 percent of Victoria's gas demand.
	   Esso has so far been unable to determine the cause of the blaze
and explosions Sept. 25, which took two days to extinguish.
	   Victoria state is south of New South Wales, and Melbourne is
about 450 miles (720 km) southwest of Sydney.

Thai opposition threatens to censure new Cabinet in two months
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai opposition leader Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh said he will give Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai's new
Cabinet a two month grace period before lodging a censure motion
against the government, local papers reported Tuesday.
	   ``I expect it to be very soon. In a couple of months,'' Chavalit
was quoted as saying in the Bangkok Post.
	   Chuan, who succeeded Chavalit as prime minister last November
after street protests erupted in Bangkok over the former general's
disastrous handling of the economy, strengthened his government's
position in parliament on Monday by adding a seventh party to his
coalition.
	   Chuan's coalition now commands 255 of the 387 seats in the House
of Representatives.
	   Although he instituted a sweeping Cabinet reshuffle to apportion
ministries to the Chart Pattana (National Development) Party, the
new partner, Chuan kept control of key economic ministries under
technocrats in his Democrat Party.
	   With only 132 lawmakers in the opposition, Chavalit does not
have the votes necessary to topple Chuan's coalition in a censure
debate, also known as a no-confidence debate.
	   Chuan's government is also more popular with the public than any
the last three years. However, it has been tainted by scandal, with
corruption allegations surfacing at the Education, Public Health
and Agriculture ministries.

Indonesian oil company ends insurance with firm linked to Suharto
</HEADLINE>
crony

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's state oil and gas company
PT Pertamina won't renew major insurance policies with a company
linked to a crony of ex-President Suharto, the newspaper Kompas
reported Tuesday.
	   Pertimina's president Soegianto said the decision to stop buying
insurance from PT Tugu Pratama Indonesia was part of a program to
end corrupt, collusive and nepotistic deals set up by the petroleum
giant during the Suharto era.
	   Pertamina holds a 45 percent stake in PT Tugu Pratama, while PT
Nusantara Ampera Bhakti, which is controlled by former president
Suharto's close ally Mohamad ``Bob'' Hasan, holds a 35 percent
stake in the venture, Kompas reported.
	   ``Actually, the (insurance) premiums were competitive, but there
are several parties that say (the arrangement) involves corruption,
collusion, and nepotism and monopolistic practices, so we made the
decision,'' said Soegianto as quoted by the daily.
	   The insurance policies covered Pertamina's refinery and project
engineering activities. They expire at the end of the year.
	   The daily reported that Pertamina will hold an open tender for a
new insurance arrangement immediately.
	   Many sectors of Indonesia's crisis-ridden economy are trying to
wash their hands of corrupt practices that were instituted during
Suharto's 32 years in power.
	   Suharto quit in May after a wave of protests and riots ended
with 1,200 people killed.
	   Critics of his regime say it was riddled with corruption.
	   Suharto now stands at the center of a corruption inquiry.
However, he denies any wrongdoing, and many commentators doubt
investigators will uncover much.
	   Under a multibillion dollar economic bailout deal with the
International Monetary Fund, Indonesia has agreed to attack
institutionalized corruption by auditing Pertamina along with
several other state-owned companies.

DNA records of native animals taken to stem illegal trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Officials in Australia will record
the DNA ``fingerprints'' of protected animals in an effort to stem
illegal trading in wildlife.
	   Queensland state government and a local university are teaming
up to develop a database of the DNA of protected species to
determine if animals for sale were from licensed dealers or
obtained illegally, the state's top environmental official said
Tuesday.
	   ``As the database broadens we'll have a foolproof method of
catching that small group of unscrupulous and unprincipled people
who flout the law and try to profit from the sale of protected
wildlife,'' Natural Resources Minister Rod Welford said.
	   Initially, the database will concentrate on four species of
birds and one reptile popular with overseas buyers.
	   High prices are paid to smugglers for golden-shouldered parrots,
red-tailed black cockatoos, yellow-tailed black cockatoos, glossy
black cockatoos and green pythons.
	   Test samples will be taken from wildlife bred in captivity and
from the wild to establish a range of genetic fingerprints,
professor Peter Timms of Queensland University of Technology's
School of Life Sciences said.
	   Welford said authorities had faced problems tracing and proving
the origin of wildlife thought to be traded illegally.
	   He said the DNA testing was ``a fantastic step'' in safeguarding
endangered species.

reaching as high as 76 percent in some areas, human rights
observers are reporting incidents of government pressure on voters
in recent Chiapas state elections.
	   The ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party continued to lead
in most counties statewide, with 95 percent of 3,341 precincts
reporting by late Monday, recovering some counties it had lost to
the opposition in county races three years ago.
	   However, the conservative National Action Party retained control
of the capital of Tuxtla Gutierrez.
	   Voters elected governments in 102 of the state's 111 counties,
and members of the 40-seat state legislature.
	   Despite the unusually calm balloting Sunday in this conflictive
state, human rights organizations on Monday reported numerous
irregularities in counties with tight races.
	   In the highlands county of Huixtan, Indian peasants were called
to the central plaza to pick up federal agriculture subsidy checks
on Sunday, and were required to bring along their voter
credentials, said Francisco Gallardo of the national election
watchdog group Civic Alliance.
	   In Ocosingo county, a bastion of support for the rebel Zapatista
National Liberation Army, leftist opposition leaders accused
federal troops and pro-government paramilitary groups of inhibiting
voters by erecting checkpoints on main roads and being present in
peasant villages.
	   There, only about 24 percent of the electorate voted, leaders of
the leftist Democratic Revolution Party reported.
	   In the Pacific Coast Tonala county, devastated by floods last
month, National Action leaders accused the victorious ruling party
candidate of having used humanitarian aid to proselytize.
	   Foreign election observers with the San Francisco-based group
Global Exchange said the natural disaster, combined with the
permanent presence of troops and paramilitary troops, diminished
voter presence in 68 percent of the state.
	   ``The state's political and social situation, represented by the
direct conflict between the Zapatista National Liberation Army and
the government, cannot be resolved through an electoral process
that does not reflect the authentic voice of Chiapan society,''
Global Exchange observers said in a prepared statement.
	   Politicians have yet to decide how to resolve a potential crisis
in seating the state legislature, caused by the postponement of
elections in eight flood-wrecked counties and an election-day
boycott in the highlands county of San Juan Chamula.

Fighter jet refit draws protest from Timor activists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ A contract to refurbish two old
Indonesian Air Force Skyhawk training aircraft has angered the East
Timor Independence Committee which opposes military links with
Indonesia.
	   The two-seater aircraft are being refitted by Blenheim-based Air
New Zealand subsidiary Safe Air at a cost of several million
dollars each, Safe Air general manager Des Ashton said Tuesday.
	   East Timor Independence Committee spokeswoman Maire Leadbeater
has protested to the New Zealand government, saying: ``New Zealand
now compounds the evil of its ongoing military training role with
the Indonesian armed forces by becoming an arms exporter.''
	   Ashton said the two planes were unarmed training aircraft and
were not fitted with armaments. Their export had been approved by
the United States government and the work had been approved by the
New Zealand government.
	   He said it was the first aircraft refit for the Indonesian
military, though it had done a lot of work previously for
Indonesian civilian airlines.
	   The company stood to gain from the Asian economic crisis as
countries were now more inclined to refurbish older aircraft rather
than buy more expensive new planes.

Malaysia's ruling party begins choosing new deputy prime minister
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Party meeting to begin about 1200 GMT

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The leaders of Malaysia's ruling
party met Tuesday to discuss a replacement for ousted deputy prime
minister Anwar Ibrahim, who faces trial next month in a case that
will test the country's legal system.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, 72, warned last week he could
``drop dead'' at any time. But because of the large number of
candidates for the job within the ruling United Malays National
Organization, a decision on a potential successor was not expected
quickly.
	   The party leaders, who have been waging a national campaign to
explain to Malaysians why the popular Anwar was fired Sept. 2, will
also confer on what to do now that a High Court judge has banned
all comments on Anwar's guilt or innocence.
	   The ruling coalition has scheduled a giant rally in the capital
Saturday, aimed at drawing in the youth to whom Anwar's campaign of
reform has the most appeal.
	   Mahathir, who had heart bypass surgery in 1989, had groomed
Anwar, 51, as his successor. But he later fired his protege from
his posts as deputy prime minister and finance minister on grounds
he was morally unfit to lead. The two had differed over economic
policy, and Anwar has said Mahathir feared he was a threat to his
17-year rule.
	   After two weeks of nationwide rallies at which he called for
government reform and Mahathir's resignation, Anwar was arrested
under a law that allows police to hold him indefinitely and prevent
him from seeing family and lawyers.
	   After appearing in court with a black eye and bruised face, neck
and arms, Anwar's case drew international attention, particularly
from the presidents of the Philippines and Indonesia, who have
raised the possibility they might not attend an 18-nation summit in
Malaysia next month.
	   Wearing a neck brace Monday after a court-ordered hospital
checkup, Anwar was ordered to stand trial Nov. 2 on four charges of
abusing his powers to interfere with a police investigation. His
trial will be halted Nov. 14 and resumed after the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation group of leaders meets in Kuala Lumpur.
	   He pleaded innocent to all charges, including another corruption
count and five charges of sodomy. He faces 14 years in prison and a
fine on each corruption count and 20 years, plus whipping, on each
sexual charge.
	   High Court Judge Augustine Paul ordered police to give Anwar's
lawyers access to their client but denied him bail, saying his
medical needs were being taken care of and he might intimidate
witnesses.
	   The prosecution said that Anwar's neck brace was ordered by
doctors because pre-existing spinal problems had recently been
aggravated. He did not explain but asked the judge to keep the
medical report secret until police complete their investigation
into Anwar's charges that policemen beat him unconscious.
	   Paul also ordered that the trial be conducted in English for the
international news media. And he acceded to a defense request that
all comments on Anwar's guilt or innocence stop.
	   While deciding what to do about complying with that order, the
party supreme council was expected to prepare a list of top
candidates for Anwar's job for Mahathir's final decision.
	   The Star newspaper, which is close to the government, listed the
favorites as Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi and Education
Minister Najib Tun Razak.
	   Other top contenders were Mahathir's confidant Daim Zainuddin, a
former finance minister brought back into the Cabinet in June as
``special functions minister'' in charge of economic recovery.
