SERENA WILLIAMS CAN'T FIND HER RHYTHM AND IS OUSTED 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   MELBOURNE, Australia _ The surface was still green, hard and
quick. The lines were still white. But the tennis that Serena
Williams produced in this Grand Slam event bore little resemblance
to the tennis she produced on her way to the title at the U.S. Open
in September.
</P>
<P>
   There will be no surprised stumble along the baseline after
match point on the final weekend; no phone conversation with Bill
Clinton and his daughter, Chelsea. Williams made sure of that on
Monday in the fourth round of the Australian Open, when she beat
herself as much as Yelena Likhovtseva beat her.
</P>
<P>
   The final score was 6-3, 6-3 and Williams, seeded third, was off
rhythm nearly from the start against the 16th-seeded Russian, who
has an all-court game but rarely had to make full use of it against
her gaffe-prone opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Williams made 32 unforced errors: an average of nearly two per
game. And it was altogether appropriate that her last shot of this
surprisingly short match was a backhand that struck the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no excuse for me to have lost this match,'' she said.
``I couldn't find my rhythm throughout the match. It was strange. I
was moving well in practice and not making any errors, but I just
couldn't find it.''
</P>
<P>
   Under normal circumstances, there might be another Williams
still in the draw to keep the family's hopes alive. But Serena's
older sister, Venus, withdrew from this event shortly before it
began, citing a wrist injury, and now there will be no beaded,
seeded Floridians to occupy the opposition and the
autograph-seekers for the rest of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Serena was not certain that she would even play in this event at
one stage in December. ``I just changed my mind,'' she said last
week. ``I thought that if I didn't come that maybe my ranking would
slip because I saw that Mary Pierce was coming up behind me.''
</P>
<P>
   That at least is no longer a worry. Pierce was upset in the
fourth round by Ai Sugiyama on Sunday. But in a sense, Williams'
indecision about playing here was reflected by her indecision on
the court. She was pushed to three sets in her opening match by
Amanda Grahame, a little-known Australian, and though she played
better in the third round against Sabine Appelmans, she resumed
struggling again today after taking a 3-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' she said. ``I just started making too many
errors. Maybe I started thinking too far in the match.''

VIVA LA FEMINISTA: WOMEN'S LIVES ARE SLOWLY IMPROVING IN MACHO
MEXICO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Not long ago, the Mexico City government tried to
make a switch. It called for a one-day experiment in which all
married women would exchange jobs with their husbands.
</P>
<P>
   On that day, husbands were asked to clean house, wash dishes, do
laundry and take care of kids.
</P>
<P>
   It's an idea that would have been unthinkable only a few years
ago, when Mexico's middle class was the confirmed center of
masculine privilege.
</P>
<P>
   But things are slowly changing in this homeland  &QL; 
of machismo.
</P>
<P>
   For example, beginning in August, 900 policemen in Mexico City
lost their authority to write traffic tickets. That authority was
given only to policewomen, who were deemed less corruptible by the
city's police chief.
</P>
<P>
   And consider some numbers: 50 percent of the people now
graduating from universities in Mexico are women, and half a dozen
women occupy high-ranking posts in Mexican governments, including
Rosario Robles, the first female mayor of Mexico City _ the biggest
city in the world _ and Rosario Green, Mexico's foreign relations
secretary.
</P>
<P>
   The changes perhaps were best summed up by Monica Almazan, a
policewoman patrolling the Condessa neighborhood: ``Finally, we
have the opportunity to show the men that we can take on a job
which is supposed to be for men only. We now have the chance to
prove ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Is feminism taking root in the hard soil of Mexican culture? The
answer is complicated because it depends on what kind of feminism
you mean. But it is accurate to say that a Mexican women's movement
is emerging on the American model, with women making some gains in
industry and government, while still blocked by institutional and
cultural barriers.
</P>
<P>
   But it's also true that the struggle for women's rights in
Mexico is nearly as old as the country itself. &QL; 
GROWING INDEPENDENCE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It can be seen today in the growing independence of
working-class women along the border, and in a National Women's
Commission that is confronting stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   Or in Mexico's efforts to improve family planning, because
unwanted teenage pregnancies are high and legal abortion is
restricted tightly.
</P>
<P>
   More women are entering legislative bodies and demanding more
laws to ban job discrimination and provide more money and health
care to women in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   And in pop culture, women are flocking to male strip shows that
feature some of the country's biggest soap-opera stars, prompting a
Catholic priest in Guanajuato to admonish on the radio, ``Rush to
confession!''
</P>
<P>
   The events, and the history behind them, defy outside notions of
a nation content with machismo.
</P>
<P>
   Among what loosely might be called the Spanish aristocracy of
Mexico and, in a vastly different way, among its peasants and
working women, Mexico has been a cradle of feminism for the entire
Western Hemisphere. &QL; 
FIRST FEMINIST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Mexicans and feminists everywhere celebrated the 300th
anniversary of the death in 1695 of Sor (Sister) Juana Ines
(EDITORS: ACCENT over ``E'' in InEs) de la Cruz, often acknowledged
as the ``first feminist of the Americas.''
</P>
<P>
   Sor Juana lived from 1651 to 1695 and now is regarded widely as
Mexico's greatest writer, akin to Shakespeare in the
English-speaking world. Her published works include more than 120
sonnets and ballads, many more short poems, three one-act dramas,
two comedies, more than two dozen prologues to plays and numerous
songs, carols and hymns.
</P>
<P>
   Her most popular work, however, is the poem that begins:
``Hombres necios que acusais (EDITORS: ACCENT MARK ove ``A'' in
acusAis) . . .'' _ ``You foolish men who accuse women . . .'' The
poem is memorized by literature students across Latin America
because it strikes at the heart of male attitudes toward women.
</P>
<P>
   But Sor Juana's best defense of women's role is found in a more
obscure work, a response to a bishop who had written a letter
attempting to silence her. (This work and the poem, ``Philosophical
Satire,'' are translated and edited by Electa Arenal and Amanda
Powell in ``The Answer/La Respuesta, Including a Selection of Poems
(by) Sor Juana Inez de la Cruz,'' City University of New York
Press).
</P>
<P>
   Still, Sor Juana was an aristocrat. More commonly, the tough
work for equality was performed by women who were literally in the
trenches, the ``soldaderas'' (soldiers), who included many officers
in their numbers and fought in the revolutionary armies of Pancho
Villa and Emiliano Zapata (their story has been preserved in a book
by Elizabeth Salas, ``Soldaderas: Mitos e Historia.''. Even today,
as soldiers in the largely Mayan independence movement in Chiapas
state, women take up arms, not least for the fact that Indian women
still may be sold into marriage for the equivalent of $400.
</P>
<P>
   Three decades after the revolution, there were women such as
Benita Galeana, a grass-roots leader who led the first squatter
land-takeovers in Mexico City in the Depression years of the 1930s.
She was arrested 60 times and almost lost her eyesight from hunger
strikes while fighting for Mexican women's suffrage, which was
finally won in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let the companera (TILDE OVER ``N'' in compaNera) in the
braids speak,'' was the cry in the 1930s when Benita Galeana would
come to address the crowds in Mexico City. &QL; 
 &QL; 
PRIMER FOR FEMINISTS
</P>
<P>
   In 1940, she wrote her autobiography, ``Benita,'' which became a
primer for the women's movement. Her book and her legacy were
rediscovered in the 1980s, when Mexican women formed a coalition to
fight for democracy and an end to violence against women.
</P>
<P>
   Benita Galeana was able to unite working- and middle-class women
for the first time despite profound philosophical differences
between the two groups concerning the role of men and class in the
struggle. But even she wasn't able to bring the movement to the
point that the Mexican government would identify its own interests
with those of the women's movement. That took nearly three
generations of factory women, the foot soldiers of a blue-collar
cultural insurgency in Tijuana that is slowly spreading from the
border south into the rest of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Prompted by economic crisis, the immigration to the United
States of male heads of household and the demand for female
employees at border factories, these women, like Rosie the Riveter
of World War II America, were the first to break en masse into
Mexico's male-dominated industrial workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Their relative autonomy, accelerated by liberal U.S. social
attitudes and economic benefits that have drifted across the
border, has granted working-class women an unusual degree of
domestic clout and social freedom, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The forces of progress are stirring themselves up much more
along the border,'' said Susan Tiano, a sociology professor at the
University of New Mexico and author of ``Patriarchy on the Line,''
a book on the effect of the ``maquiladoras'' on border gender
roles. ``Some amazing changes happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Women in Tijuana come and go as they please, working night
shifts and shopping at 24-hour supermarkets. Women hit the discos
on weekends, with or without male escorts. Some wear tight pants
and miniskirts. Unmarried mothers are not pariahs.
</P>
<P>
   There are serious social problems for women in the border
workplace. Low pay (the average wage is around 80 cents an hour,
and independent unions are discouraged), sexual harassment and
gender barriers to higher-paying jobs prevent factory women from
raising their status.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies, including a number of U.S.-owned factories and
border-region ``maquiladora'' manufacturing plants, force job
applicants to take pregnancy tests and will hire them only if the
exams are negative. And although women's role in the workforce has
doubled to 30 percent since 1980, female workers still earn 25
percent less than men in the same jobs, says Elena Azaola, a social
anthropologist.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is widely acknowledged that blue-collar women are
creating a new female archetype to reckon with in Mexican society,
and that has been lost neither on the government nor on
middle-class women.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, known by
its Spanish acronym PRI, and its standard-bearer, President Ernesto
Zedillo, taking note of the fact that 70 percent of Mexicans who
are illiterate are women, announced a new social-service program
aimed primarily at women and girls. &QL; 
LEGISLATIVE GAINS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Revolutionary Party, known by its Spanish acronym
PRD, which focused heavily on women's issues in the past
presidential campaign, has been contributing to the rise of women
in Mexico's legislative bodies.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1997 elections, the party doubled its number of female
deputies in the lower house to 30, giving it the largest percentage
of female elected officials of any of the three major parties
represented in the 500-seat Mexican parliament.
</P>
<P>
   All of these changes contributed to the creation of a National
Women's Commission, intended to confront double standards. In 1998,
it launched an American-style advertising campaign questioning
whether society could advance if comments such as these were
allowed to go unchallenged:
</P>
<P>
   ``She is the director. I wonder how she got there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband can do what he wants, because he is a man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are you pregnant? I told you to take care of yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, the campaign offered statements affirming a new
attitude:
</P>
<P>
   ``I am the director, and I did not sleep with anybody to get
here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't need to sleep around to be a man, and I also use
protection.''
</P>
<P>
   Machismo will not make for a smooth adjustment to any changes,
but some see change as inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mexican man idolizes women as `the Mother,' and he will
not tolerate her being contaminated,'' said Alejandro Radchik,
president of the Psychoanalytic Society in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a society where `la casa chica' _ the little house for
the mistress _ is common, not because the husband no longer loves
his wife but because, once she becomes the mother of his children,
sex becomes a dirty act that will contaminate her,'' Radchik said.
</P>
<P>
   `The Mother is her own worst enemy. She is the one educating her
sons, the Mexican men, to be macho and preparing her daughters to
be good mothers and housewives.''
</P>
<P>
   How about the future? Many women believe there is good reason to
hope. With women representing 53 percent of Mexican voters,
presidential candidates campaigning for what is hoped could be the
most competitive democratic election in Mexican history in July,
middle-class women could achieve a measure of political power _
eventually.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, (the Mexican man) will react by trying to belittle
her and by being condescending,'' Radchik said. ``When this
attitude does not lead to his desired effect, he will acquiesce to
this new feminine authority.'' &QL;

RAMS SHADE TAMPA BAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ This whole dream of a season was slipping away and
Ricky Proehl knew it. It was the fourth quarter, ``and we've been
explosive all season and when you look up at the scoreboard and
it's 6-5,'' said the St. Louis wide receiver, ``you just feel so
frustrated.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing was coming easily. ``They seemed to know what was
coming,'' Rams quarterback Kurt Warner said of the Buccaneers, and
never more so than earlier in that fourth quarter when Tampa Bay
defensive back Brian Kelly saw the St. Louis formation, signaled
back to his safety, and confidently stepped inside Torry Holt's
slant pattern and picked off a Warner pass.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis eventually won this tractor pull of an NFC
Championship Game, 11-6, Sunday and clinched the city's first Super
Bowl appearance, but with just under five minutes left, the
scoreboard was frozen in that 6-5 baseball mode, and the Rams'
once-explosive offense seemed dead.
</P>
<P>
   And Warner's big sister for this magical season, Cinderella,
seemingly had left the Trans World Dome.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams had the ball on the Tampa Bay 30 but Rams kicker Jeff
Wilkins's leg was hurting and St. Louis needed many more yards
before even a field goal could be attempted. All game long the
Bucs' ``Cover-2'' zone pass defense had stolen the Rams' passion _
the deep ball _ and forced Warner to dink and dab underneath. But
even those short passes now were suspect because Tampa Bay was
reading the Rams' formations and jumping those routes.
</P>
<P>
   It was third and 4. The play called, said Proehl, was named
``585-H'' and it called for Proehl to run an 18-yard route to the
left sideline. But the play's primary target was Marshall Faulk
coming out of the backfield for the short pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there had been a TV timeout before the play,'' Proehl went
on, ``and Kurt and I were able to talk in the huddle before the
play. Kurt said, `If the safety comes (on a blitz) from the middle
of the field, we're going on a fade.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Proehl lined up on the left. He had 35 catches this season and
25 of them had been for first downs, so the veteran was clearly a
clutch, possession receiver. But he had yet to catch a touchdown
pass.
</P>
<P>
   When he lined up, Proehl noticed that ``their guy (Kelly) was
`squatting,' expecting me to run a slant or a hitch.'' But, at the
last instant, Proehl noticed that a Tampa Bay safety indeed was
coming on a blitz, just as Warner had warned, ``and I adjusted to a
fade route deep.''
</P>
<P>
   As Warner saw the safety coming, ``I didn't think I'd have
enough time to look anywhere, and I knew Ricky was adjusting to a
`go' route,'' said the Rams QB. ``So I threw it deep to Ricky.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the only time all game that any St. Louis receiver had
gotten behind a Tampa Bay defender, ``and I just knew I had to
catch the ball. But their guy hit me a little just as the ball got
there, and I think I juggled it a little,'' said Proehl. To be
precise, the tip of the ball was sticking out of the crook of one
arm and seemed ready to fall to the ground until ``I was able to
grab it and get it back home'' and cradle the ball for a TD.
</P>
<P>
   And home erupted. The dome exploded in noise as the Rams finally
took a lead of more than 2 points this day, their margin all the
way to 5. And if it seemed the Bucs, with rookie Shaun King at
quarterback and conservative offensive coordinator Mike Shula
calling the plays, would be unable to score, all that changed when
King looked for Karl Williams from the Rams' 44 with 1:31 to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on him pretty good,'' said veteran Rams cornerback Todd
Lyght, ``but my feet got crossed up in his and I fell and he just
kept on running.'' He caught King's pass for a 22-yard gain to the
Rams 22. ``I wasn't feeling good after that play, but I just knew I
had to make up for it. I had to come up with a big play to stop
them,'' Lyght said.
</P>
<P>
   Bucs defensive end Warren Sapp was on the sideline, watching the
drama build and the anxiety tighten for all. ``The kid (King) has
taken us from behind to win five games,'' said Sapp, ``and I was
sure he was going to do it a sixth time.''
</P>
<P>
   Lyght never did make a big play to atone for his tripping and
falling. But St. Louis defensive end Grant Wistrom did, sacking
King for a 13-yard loss on the next play, setting up a
second-and-25. And then the Bucs, the replay official, former
referee Jerry Markbreit, and an oh-so-close decision cut off so
much of the drama that was building.
</P>
<P>
   King completed a 15-yard pass to Bert Emanuel that set up a
more-manageable third and 10 from the 22 with 51 seconds left.
Tampa Bay then used its last timeout _ after squandering its second
timeout for a silly replay challenge earlier in the fourth quarter
that would have given them only 5 more yards if it were upheld, and
it wasn't _ and it seemed that if that timeout were not taken the
replay official might not have had time to challenge the catch.
</P>
<P>
   But, with the timeout, Markbreit was able to study the play and
signaled to referee Bill Carollo to take another look. After
looking at the play, ``It was apparent that the player, as he was
catching the ball, he used the ground and the tip of the ball hit
the ground. By rule, you cannot use the ground, or have assistance
from the ground, to make the catch.''
</P>
<P>
   It made no difference, Carollo went on, that Emanuel's knees may
have hit the ground before the tip of the ball did, just as it made
no difference that Emanuel seemed to have possession of the ball
even though the tip of the ball touched the ground. ``Because the
ball hit the ground, by rule it's an automatic incomplete pass,''
said Carollo.
</P>
<P>
   Now faced with a third and 25 with no timeouts, King fired
incomplete passes on third and fourth downs. And Ricky Proehl
grabbed the George Halas trophy awarded to the NFC champion and
dashed around the Trans World Dome. ``I've been waiting 10 years
for this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And Kurt Warner led a victory lap around the field, exulting
that ``this has been a dream of a season, except for one more win
next week.''

TENNESSEE TAMES JACKSONVILLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ It was one of the most painful days in Tom
Coughlin's football life, but he had to accept it.
</P>
<P>
   The Tennessee Titans, champions of the American Football
Conference, are better than his Jacksonville Jaguars.
</P>
<P>
   ``They beat us three times this year,'' said Coughlin, ``so I
have to take my hat off to them. They are a very good football
team. They deserve to be going to the Super Bowl. We just didn't
play the quality game we had to play today to beat them.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither team played a pretty game, but Tennessee was more
resilient, making the bigger plays on both sides of the ball on the
way to an impressive 33-14 victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans, formerly the Houston Oilers, are making the first
trip to the Super Bowl in franchise history, and they dominated the
second half, outscoring Jacksonville, 23-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we led, 14-10, at the half,'' said Coughlin, ``I felt
very good about our chances. I thought we were going to win. We had
energy in our locker room at the half. I had no idea what was about
to happen was going to happen. I just didn't think anything like
that could happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Titans deserve to be going to Atlanta. They have beaten the
best the NFL has to offer. They whipped St. Louis during the
regular season, then beat Buffalo, Indianapolis, and Jacksonville
in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We enjoy being the underdog,'' said Titans defensive tackle
Josh Evans, who made the biggest play of the game when he and Jason
Fisk sacked Jaguars quarterback Mark Brunell for a safety in the
third quarter. That helped swing the game Tennessee's way,
particularly when Derrick Mason returned the ensuing free kick 80
yards for a score that put the Titans up, 26-14. ``Every week
people think we are going to lose, and then we win. I hope they
make the same mistake in the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville, behind an electric sellout crowd, looked like the
better team in the first 28 minutes. It led, 14-7, when the first
sign of trouble appeared.
</P>
<P>
   With fewer than two minutes left in the half, Jaguars punt
returner Reggie Barlow fumbed inside his 10, and Al Del Greco
knocked home a 34-yard field goal with 20 seconds left to reduce
the lead to 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't like it, but I still felt good at that point,'' said
Coughlin. ``But then those kinds of things continued. Penalties,
dropped passes, fumbles, terrible play on our kickoff coverage.
Those kinds of things haven't happened that way to us all year.''
Jacksonville had six turnovers and nine penalties for 100 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Steve McNair carried the Titans when Jacksonville
shut down Tennessee running back Eddie George.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had an idea that Jacksonville was going to do everything on
defense to stop George,'' said Titans offensive coordinator Les
Steckel. ``So we had Steve throw a little more, and run more than
he had, and he made some great plays.''
</P>
<P>
   McNair ran nine times for 91 yards, scoring two touchdowns. He
also threw a 9-yard touchdown pass in the first quarter that tied
the game at 7.
</P>
<P>
   But the second half was the game.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 14-10, Tennessee waltzed 76 yards in six plays, scoring
on a 1-yard sneak by McNair with 9:24 left in the third. Two
penalties vs. the Jaguars gave the Titans 43 of those 76 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Then, trailing 17-14, the Jaguars were backed up on their 1.
``We called a play we worked on in practice for a situation just
like this,'' said Brunell, who did not have a good day. ``We had
the play. They gave us the defense we were looking for. But we made
a mistake, and I couldn't get the ball away. It happened to us all
day. Bad reads, dropped passes, missed blocks, that was it.''
</P>
<P>
   Brunell was sacked in the end zone by Evans and Fisk. ``The guy
in front of me tried to kill me,'' said Evans. ``He came hard down
the line at me, and I beat him with a swim move and had the
opening.''
</P>
<P>
   That gave Tennessee a 19-14 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point we were still in the game,'' said Coughlin. ``We
were only 5 points down, the game was still in reach. But the
kickoff return made things different. We worked on that all week.
We had great respect for this Mason kid, and he still took it all
the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Mason rolled 80 yards for the score with the ensuing free kick,
opening a 26-14 bulge heading into the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The tenacious McNair capped off the great win with a brilliant
51-yard run straight up the middle to the Jacksonville 1, and he
sneaked over on the next play for the final touchdown with 6:59
left.
</P>
<P>
   McNair was 14 of 23 for 112 yards. Brunell, who had receivers
open all day and either couldn't get the ball to them or had them
drop it, finished 19 of 38 for 226 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Taylor of Jacksonville had the edge over George. Taylor
carried 19 times for 110 yards, George 25 times for 86 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was smash-mouth football out there,'' said Titans tight
end Frank Wycheck, ``but they couldn't stop us from marching down
the field. We set our minds to do that, and we did it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a game that's going to stick with us all year,'' said
Coughlin. ``And it's going to be painful.''

GIANT STEP FOR TITANS QB 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ They are the Sons of the Houston Oilers,
which makes quarterback Steve McNair a direct descendant of George
Blanda, Dan Pastorini, and Warren Moon.
</P>
<P>
   The Tennessee Titans _ with their Oliver Stone uniforms and AFL
Mayflower bloodlines _ are going to Super Bowl XXXIV, also known as
Yahoo Bowl I. They will be led by a QB worthy of his Texan
forefathers.
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday's often-hideous AFC Championship Game, a
mistake-packed thriller on the shores of the St. John River, McNair
led the Titans to a 33-14 victory over the favored hometown
Jaguars. He sealed the deal with a 51-yard keeper followed by a
1-yard TD plunge with seven minutes to play.
</P>
<P>
   Oft-critiqued for his dearth of touchdown passes and 300-yard
passing games, the 26-year-old, third-year starter has emerged as a
player who gets the job done. He can throw the ball as far as
anybody on the planet, but Tennessee's short-passing game utilizes
his mobility more than his cannon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm out there just to play football,'' said the Missouri
native. ``We can strike with the passing game, we can strike with
the running game . . . whatever they take away. I've been through a
lot from start to finish: back surgery, not winning the Heisman,
not throwing for so many yards like so many other quarterbacks.''
McNair had surgery for a disk injury earlier this year, and in
1994, after a record-setting career at Division 1-AA Alcorn State,
finished third in voting for the Heisman Trophy behind Rashaan
Salaam and Ki-Jana Carter.
</P>
<P>
   ``But regardless of what numbers I put up on touchdown passes or
300-yard passing games, we're winning. That's what it's all about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes that criticism kind of bothers you mentally. I threw
for over 4,000 yards every year in college, but coming here we had
a different game plan and mentally I had to get used to it.''
</P>
<P>
   McNair was not immune from the fumbles and foibles that plagued
players on both squads in this Super Bowl semifinal. He was
intercepted once and lost a fumble. But as Jacksonville's Mark
Brunell melted in the Florida sun (the Jaguars QB was exposed in a
stunning second-half sequence of bad decisions and misplays),
Tennessee's QB took the hits and stood tall to the finish.
</P>
<P>
   He'd been suffering from turf toe (big toe, left foot) and wore
a boot all week in practice, but the deepest pain Sunday came from
the helmet of Jacksonville defensive end Tony Brackens (he was the
guy Bill Parcells wanted instead of Terry Glenn). McNair took a
pile-driver shot to the chest, got the wind knocked out of him, and
hit the deck at Alltel Stadium. Nashville cats back home shuddered
at the sight of backup Neil O'Donnell warming up in the bullpen as
three trainers attended to the Titans starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hit me in the chest and I lost my breath,'' said McNair.
``With that, you just have to be patient and it comes back.''
</P>
<P>
   His breath came back. He threw one touchdown pass and ran for
two other scores. He was a modest 14 of 23 for only 112 yards
passing with a long gain of 15 yards. That's less than an average
half for Drew Bledsoe, but Bledsoe has all the mobility of Al Gore.
McNair can run. McNair can make plays. He ran for 91 yards on nine
carries, including the 51-yard clinching sprint in the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Estimable Jacksonville coach Tom Coughlin said, ``He's a strong,
strong, physical football player. He's very difficult once he comes
out of that pocket. We had guys with their arms around him a couple
times and they couldn't bring him down.''
</P>
<P>
   In Tennessee, there's a phrase for the strategy teams toss at
the Titans. It's called the Dare McNair game plan. It seems to be
failing in this year's playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We throw high-percentage passes and Steve was good with his
decisions,'' said Tennessee coach Jeff Fisher. ``You have to
surround your quarterback with good people and we've done that. For
him to get to the Super Bowl in his third year as a starter, he
should get more respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Twelve years ago Doug Williams led the Redskins into the Super
Bowl, which produced a media-day question that still ranks with the
worst of all-time. A reporter asked Williams, ``Doug, how long have
you been a black quarterback?''
</P>
<P>
   Williams led the Redskins over the Broncos, winning the MVP
Award. McNair already has started hearing the ``black QB''
questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a quarterback in the Super Bowl, that's the way I see
it,'' he said. ``I don't get into variations of how people think.
Organizations these days look for people to go out and run a team
and get the job done, regardless of color. There are some great
black quarterbacks in the NFL, but this is something we all dream
of, black or white.''

ST. LOUIS DEFENDERS ARE BATTERING RAMS 
</HEADLINE>
 CHAMPIONSHIP-ANALYSIS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ The St. Louis Rams got to the Super Bowl Sunday the
old-fashioned way. They played defense.
</P>
<P>
   For four quarters they played the kind of defense in the NFC
Championship Game that leaves your elbows bleeding and your fingers
gnarled and your body dehydrated. They played the kind of defense
that suffocates an opponent and, in the end, gives life to your own
offense.
</P>
<P>
   That is what was needed to beat the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, proud
owners of the NFL's highest-rated defense, and that is what was
supplied. Suffocating defense. A champion's defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew they couldn't beat us with 6 points,'' said Rams
defensive tackle Ray Agnew, who once played that position in New
England and will play it in Sunday's Super Bowl against the
Tennessee Titans because he and his mates played so well Sunday
that the Buccaneers could not score a touchdown despite starting
drives at the Rams' 20, 45, 42, and 49 as well as from their own
31, 32, and 34.
</P>
<P>
   On the day, Tampa's average drive began on its 39, meaning on
average it had to go only 61 yards to a touchdown. It never got
there, losing, 11-6, because no one was going to beat the explosive
Rams' offense without scoring a touchdown no matter how good their
own defense was.
</P>
<P>
   ``All week all the talk was about what Tampa Bay's defense could
do,'' Agnew said. ``No one mentioned our defense. We knew we had to
match their defense and we knew we could.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the Buccaneers know they could too because they did. The
Rams played the Buccaneers' game and won. They beat the best
defense in the league at its strength, which led Pro Bowl
cornerback Todd Lyght to make light of the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We showed today that we are the best (defense in the NFL),''
Lyght said, not long after he had slipped and fallen on what
appeared to be a crucial third-down play on Tampa's final drive.
Lyght's slip allowed rookie Shaun King to complete a 21-yard pass
on third and 7 that temporarily put the ball at the Rams' 23 with
85 seconds to play.
</P>
<P>
   We say temporarily because one play later Grant Wistrom sacked
King for a 13-yard loss and two plays later King was nearly sacked
again on third down and forced to throw the ball away, leaving his
team facing fourth and 23 from the St. Louis 36 with 41 seconds to
play.
</P>
<P>
   The way the Rams had played defense all day, they were not going
to fail to make one more play, which they did by covering King's
receivers so closely he ended up throwing the ball out of the back
of the end zone as the crowd at the Trans World Dome roared its
salute to its suddenly Super Bowl team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we showed the NFL and the world something today,''
said defensive tackle D'Marco Farr. ``The Bucs thought their
defense was going to come in here and walk all over us. We held
them without a touchdown and proved to everyone that we're a pretty
good defensive team, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``People said Tampa Bay had the best defense but as everyone can
see they're going home. Stats do not mean anything. All that
matters at the end of the game is who has more points. It doesn't
matter what the stats say. You have to go out and perform.''
</P>
<P>
   That the Rams' defense did, limiting the Buccaneers to 203 total
yards with an average gain of just 3.6 yards (to 4.8 yards per play
by the Rams). Most important, they stuffed Tampa's powerful running
game down its throat. In 23 carries, the Bucs' backs averaged just
3.3 yards a carry, gaining only 77 yards on the day to join a list
of 17 previous opponents who could not produce a 100-yard rusher
against this defense nobody knows.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Bucs' defense did more harm to the Rams' running
game and thus forced St. Louis into the kind of defensive struggle
it wanted to avoid, in the end it could not do as much harm to its
adversary as St. Louis did to King and Co.
</P>
<P>
   The Bucs, for example, intercepted three Kurt Warner passes
while St. Louis grabbed only two from King, but the Rams made the
biggest play when Dre Bly picked off a King throw midway through
the fourth quarter with St. Louis trailing, 6-5, and returned it to
the Tampa 48. Six plays later, Warner completed a beautiful fade
route pass to seldom-used Ricky Proehl for a 30-yard touchdown over
cornerback Brian Kelly and the Bucs' fate was sealed because the
Rams' defense sealed in their offense for the remainder of the day.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis finished with five sacks to Tampa's none despite the
fact the Rams threw 43 times to Tampa's 29. And the Rams got two of
those sacks in Tampa's final possession after Proehl's touchdown,
sacks that knocked the Bucs back a total of 18 yards when they
could ill afford to lose 18 inches.
</P>
<P>
   That is what championship defense is all about. Knocking people
back when it is most needed. Knocking them back the way the Rams
did all day but did most of all over the game's final 4:44, when
Tampa had the ball and was struggling to find some way to do what
St. Louis had just done on the best defense in football.
</P>
<P>
   The Buccaneers struggled to score a touchdown and they failed
because the defense nobody thought much about stopped them when
they had to. Stopped them where the Bucs had failed to. Stopped
them short of the end zone one last time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were trapped into playing their kind of game with our
turnovers and their stopping our running game,'' Rams coach Dick
Vermeil said. ``Give them credit for that but we played an
outstanding defensive game. The pressure that rookie (King) was
under. We hit him. We hit him pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   They hit him and Mike Alstott and Warrick Dunn and the Bucs'
receivers time and time again. They hit them harder and more often
than Tampa's defense hit Warner or St. Louis's receivers. Not by
much, perhaps, but by enough to be going to Atlanta to begin
preparations for the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just made plays in pressure situations,'' Bly said after
having made perhaps the biggest one of all with his interception
that set up the winning score. ``We knew we could make plays on
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   And so they did, forcing three turnovers, scoring a safety, and
battering the Bucs regardless of where they started. Normally a
team that has to go only 61 yards on average to score, scores a lot
of touchdowns. Sunday the Buccaneers didn't score any.
</P>
<P>
   That may not mean the St. Louis Rams have the best defense in
football, but it did mean one thing. It meant they're the only
defense in the NFC that's going to the Super Bowl.

PRADA, AMERICAONE OPEN DUEL 
</HEADLINE>
 CUP-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ The natives here almost can't take it
anymore. The wait is excruciating. Like children sleepless at 2
a.m. Christmas morning, it seems an eternity before the opening of
presents.
</P>
<P>
   And the presents on this waterfront, where natives prowl by the
thousands daily watching the action, take the form of two black,
sleek _ nay dangerous looking _ 75-foot International America's Cup
Class racing boats.
</P>
<P>
   The New Zealand sailing team hasn't sailed in anger since May
1995, when its ``Black Magic'' swept the America's Cup series
against the United States, 5-0, in one of the most lopsided wins in
history. The Kiwi boat won all 25 marks in five races, and gained
time in all 30 legs.
</P>
<P>
   So, from the shoreside throng to the TV watchers far from the
waterfront, natives here _ who anticipate another 5-0 sweep _ just
want the thing to get going.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the celebrating for months has been for the challengers,''
said Byron Serle, whose family strolled Sunday along the Viaduct
Basin seawall that looks across at all the competitors' docks.
``It's time to start some celebrating for our home team.''
</P>
<P>
   But for the remaining two challengers _ Prada of Italy and
AmericaOne _ it is far from over. And some huge questions remain as
the challenger finals of the Louis Vuitton Cup get under way.
</P>
<P>
   If New Zealand is beaten, will the Cup next go to Europe, to be
sailed on the Mediterranean coast, or to the breezy port of San
Francisco?
</P>
<P>
   The further import of the question is this: Should Paul Cayard
win it all here and take the Cup to San Francisco, then no other
American syndicate could challenge for the Cup until some non-US
team took it to another country to put the United States in the
role of challenger again.
</P>
<P>
   If Prada goes all the way and takes the Cup to Cote d'Ur or some
such port, then after 151 years, the America's Cup finally will
make its debut in Europe. Most observers believe this would
stimulate a huge European regatta that would pull in Germany,
England, and Scandinavia along with France and Spain, who have been
involved right along.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, a European Cup would give top US sailors who would
like to challenge for the Cup again the opportunity to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly would like the chance to challenge again,'' said
Dewey Isdale, commodore of the New York Yacht Club whose Young
America Challenge derailed after its initial boat broke apart in
rough Hauraki Gulf seas in November. ``It just depends on what
happens and where the Cup ends up. We would love to come back
here.''
</P>
<P>
   So, even as the Kiwis are waiting for bigger things, much hangs
in the balance as the challengers take to the racecourse Monday for
Race 1 in the best-of-nine series.
</P>
<P>
   Like a couple of Super Bowl teams, Prada and AmericaOne have
been analyzed, picked over, and number-crunched since the day both
qualified for the finals two weeks ago. They even have been
psychoanalyzed in trying to determine which team is more aggressive
and which is likely to crack under pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The widest consensus is that Prada holds a very slight speed
edge, while Cayard and crew sail tougher and steadier and remain
unflappable no matter what comes their way.
</P>
<P>
   ``This series is going to come down to whose head is in the
game,'' said Bill Koch, the 1992 America's Cup winner who has made
a close analysis of the two teams and boats.
</P>
<P>
   In the semifinals _ the most important races since October _
Cayard's AmericaOne won eight straight races, said Koch, whereas
Prada lost three critical matches under pressure. ``Experts now
give AmericaOne a slight edge. The sole reason: experience.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Koch, who sailed a race with Cayard last series,
``(Tactician John) Kostecki and Cayard really have their act
together. They don't get sucked into going off on your own looking
for windshifts. They know how to stay in front and match-race.
That's important.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he added ``the Italians' big weakness is not covering
downwind. If they get their act together, cover downwind, and don't
get rattled under pressure, Prada could win it.''

THANK RAMS FOR KEEPING BUCS OUT OF SUPER BOWL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ The nation of sports journalists turns its grateful
eyes to this town, says ``thank you,'' and sighs heavily.
</P>
<P>
   If the St. Louis Rams had not come through late in the fourth
quarter Sunday in the NFC Championship Game, the scribes would have
to explain all this week how it was that the Tampa Bay Buccaneers
made it to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   There aren't words in the language sufficient to have described
it. Shakespeare would have busted his quill. Darwin and Einstein
would have declared the natural laws immutable, and denied that the
Bucs were even in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The only adequate expression would have been found in the NFL's
own pretentious affectation, the use of Roman numerals:
</P>
<P>
   All records of Sunday's game at the Georgia Dome could simply
read, ``Tennessee Titans vs. X.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the Rams delivered us. Not to mention themselves.
</P>
<P>
   It's not as if anyone was screaming for the St. Louis-Tennessee
matchup. Certainly not Super Bowl broadcaster ABC, whose executives
by this morning should be scraped off the Manhattan sidewalk below
their windows.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bucs? The worst half-bad team to ever reach this
pinnacle? Whose offense not only didn't score a touchdown, but gave
up two points on a bad snap? Who started a rookie quarterback who
still lives with his parents? Whose offensive linemen are unknown
to most of their mothers?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most impressive unimpressive thing about the Bucs is
that they are so bad they were able to suck the entertainment right
out of the Rams, the 14-point favorites who came into the game with
an offense ranked 34th, just behind the 33-car field in the
Indianapolis 500.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rams won. Eleven to six.
</P>
<P>
   That isn't a pro football score. It's a work shift at state
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we look at the tapes and they look at the tapes,'' Rams
coach Dick Vermeil said, ``we will say, `Jeez, there was a lot of
things that we could have done or should have done.'''
</P>
<P>
   Like pursue amnesty. Declare bankruptcy. Merge with Disney.
</P>
<P>
   Anything but this.
</P>
<P>
   This was sumo wrestling for the heavily garbed. But that's not
fair to sumo wrestling, whose matches rarely go more than 20
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty seconds into this one, St. Louis quarterback Kurt Warner
had already thrown an interception to a defensive lineman, and
Tampa was in the midst of screwing up its first of many
opportunities for an easy touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Not until the third hour approached in this one was there
glimpsed a flicker of pro football majesty. But for fans of the
Seahawks, it came with a bittersweet little twist.
</P>
<P>
   Former Seahawk Ricky Proehl, mostly lost this season in the
Rams' receiver rotation of speedsters, made the play of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Spotting the Bucs in a blitz on a third-and-four at the Tampa
30-yard line, which allowed him to match up on a single defender,
Proehl changed his route and headed straight to the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Warner lofted a fade pass that intersected with Proehl, defender
Brian Kelly and the end zone sideline simultaneously. All Proehl
did was make the biggest catch of his 10-year career, as well as
his first TD of this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of contact,'' said Proehl, who appeared in 24
games for the Seahawks in 1995 and 1996, starting seven, before
being released. ``He had his hand in there, and I think I pinned
the ball against my hip or side.''
</P>
<P>
   One splendid play, and that was the ballgame.
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say that both defenses didn't play well, and
occasionally spectacularly. But the playoff game last week at the
Trans World Dome was won by St. Louis over Minnesota 49-37, and
even the Bucs beat Washington 14-13 the same weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's game was not only a drudge match, it nearly dropped the
final safe on the head of the NFL in this cartoon of a season.
</P>
<P>
   Little did Seahawks fans know that back on Thanksgiving weekend
at the Kingdome, they nearly witnessed the making of an unmade
champion. Tampa beat the Seahawks 16-3 despite just 156 yards of
total offense.
</P>
<P>
   That was the game in which a tackle by Seahawks defensive end
Phillip Daniels broke the clavicle of Bucs quarterback Trent
Dilfer. That ushered in the, ahem, era of rookie Shaun King, a
second-round draft choice from Tulane who should never have beaten
the Seahawks that day, and had no business scaring the bejeezus out
of the Rams at home Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But there he was at the end of the game, throwing the ball 36
yards into the end zone with a chance to go to the Super Bowl with
a lucky catch.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't happen, but that didn't mean the shaken Rams weren't
fearful until the toss hit the turf and their stupendously
improbable 15-3 season could take a bow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watching that last pass ... it was in slow motion,'' said
D'Marco Farr, the Rams defensive tackle from the University of
Washington who had five tackles and a sack.
</P>
<P>
   ``What flashed through my mind was training camp, and all the
work it took to get from there to here. And if that pass was
completed ...''
</P>
<P>
   As much as Farr didn't want to see it, the sports journalistic
nation didn't want to write it.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, the cosmic whammy held off, just in time for many to
savor the fact that the Rams, who never made the playoffs in the
'90s, are in the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best I've ever been was 8-8,'' said Proehl, offering an
attribute that should have made him a Seahawk for life. ``I've
never had a sniff of the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Breathe deeply, Ricky. In Tennessee-St. Louis, some may smell a
Super Bowl stinker.
</P>
<P>
   But it could have been worse.

`AMERICAN BEAUTY' WINS 3 GOLDEN GLOBE AWARDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By RICK LYMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Box-office giants mixed with independent-film
newcomers at the 57th annual Golden Globe Awards on Sunday night at
the drizzle-drenched Beverly Hilton Hotel, with established stars
like Jim Carrey, Tom Cruise and Denzel Washington joining relative
movie newcomers like Hilary Swank, Janet McTeer and Angelina Jolie
among the winners.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Beauty,'' a scabrous comedy about dysfunctional
suburbanites that is considered a front-runner for the Academy
Awards, won for best drama. In something of a surprise, the
enormously popular, computer-animated ``Toy Story 2'' won for best
comedy or musical, perhaps edging it toward an Oscar nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The mix of independent film sensibilities with the Hollywood
mainstream was a dominant theme among movies in 1999 and it was
well in evidence on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Carrey won for best actor in a comedy or musical for ``Man on
the Moon,'' a studio film that, like ``American Beauty,'' had an
independent-film sensibility. Cruise, one of Hollywood's biggest
stars, won for his supporting role in an independent film, Paul
Thomas Anderson's ``Magnolia.'' Ms. Swank won for best actress in a
drama for ``Boys Don't Cry'' and Ms. McTeer for best actress in a
comedy or musical for ``Tumbleweeds,'' both independent films. And
Ms. Jolie won best supporting actress for playing a sociopath in
``Girl, Interrupted,'' another studio film with the feel of an
independent effort.
</P>
<P>
   A more traditional Hollywood film, ``The Hurricane'' from Norman
Jewison, about the wrongful imprisonment of the boxer Ruben Carter,
won Washington his award for best actor in a drama. He was joined
onstage by Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Shut out of the Golden Globes on Sunday night were such films as
``The Insider,'' ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' and ``Being John
Malkovich,'' all of which had been considered strong Oscar
contenders.
</P>
<P>
   The most significant trend of the evening, though, might well
have been in the television awards _ normally overshadowed by the
Globes' better-known movie honors _ which were dominated by cable
channels, particularly ``The Sopranos'' on HBO, at the expense of
the networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sopranos,'' about a dysfunctional Mafia family in New
Jersey, won for best dramatic series, and awards went to two of its
lead stars, James Gandolfini and Edie Falco, and to Nancy Marchand
as supporting actress.
</P>
<P>
   Another HBO series, ``Sex and the City,'' won big, too, taking
the award for best comedy series and for best lead actress, Sarah
Jessica Parker. HBO's ``RKO 281'' won best movie or mini-series,
Peter Fonda won best supporting actor in a series or movie for
Showtime's ``Passion of Ayn Rand,'' Halle Berry won best actress in
a television movie or mini-series for HBO's ``Introducing Dorothy
Dandridge'' and Jack Lemmon won best actor in a television movie or
mini-series for Showtime's ``Inherit the Wind.''
</P>
<P>
   Only one television award went to a network show: Michael J.
Fox, who has Parkinson's disease and recently announced that this
would be his last season on ABC's ``Spin City,'' won for best actor
in a television comedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am the establishment I once rejected,'' said Carrey in
accepting his second consecutive best-actor Globe. (He won for
``The Truman Show'' last year, another comedy.) ``I am the Tom
Hanks of the Golden Globes.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanks, who Carrey joins on the very short list of the
highest-paid movie stars in Hollywood, won two Academy Awards in a
row (for ``Philadelphia'' in 1994 and ``Forrest Gump'' in 1995) and
Carrey had expressed a sense of rivalry with Hanks.
</P>
<P>
   The Cecil B. De Mille Award for lifetime achievement went to
Barbra Streisand. Recent winners of the award have included Jack
Nicholson, Shirley MacLaine and Sean Connery.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Mendes, the British stage director who brought the
Tony-winning ``Cabaret'' to Broadway, won best director for his
first motion picture, ``American Beauty,'' which also won best
screenplay honors for Alan Ball.
</P>
<P>
   The award for best foreign-language film went to ``All About My
Mother,'' from the Spanish director Pedro Almodovar, who had the
audience in stitches with a stream-of-consciousness acceptance
speech. ``Just look at me and see how happy I am,'' he said, later
refusing to end his speech when the prompter flashed ``adios,''
saying he didn't know what the word meant.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Parker seemed stunned when she was named best actress in a
comedy, beating out favorites Calista Flockhart (``Ally McBeal'')
and Jenna Elfman (``Dharma and Greg'').
</P>
<P>
   Lemmon also drew a laugh when someone shouted ``Ving'' at him as
he walked to the podium. This referred to a famous Golden Globes
incident in 1998 when an emotional Ving Rhames accepted his award
for best supporting actor and announced he was going to give it to
Lemmon, whom he hardly knew but whom he admired and who was in the
audience. He dragged the startled Lemmon onstage.
</P>
<P>
   When he heard the shout on Sunday night, Lemmon responded, ``In
the spirit of Ving Rhames, I'm going to give this award to Jack
Lemmon.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   This year's assortment of nominees was more interesting than in
most recent years because there was no real favorite in any
category, so those who wondered what might end up winning the
Oscars in March were looking more closely to Sunday night's
ceremony for clues.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the films touted as early Oscar favorites _ ``American
Beauty,'' ``The Talented Mr. Ripley,'' ``The Insider,'' ``The
Hurricane'' _ were among the Globe nominees. And even many of those
films seen as possible dark-horse Oscar candidates _ ``Being John
Malkovich,'' ``The Straight Story,'' ``The End of the Affair,''
``Boys Don't Cry'' _ were contenders.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Golden Globes are handed out by the Hollywood Foreign Press
Association, a group of 84 journalists who cover entertainment. Not
long ago the awards were considered little more than a joke, but
not so today. The event has increased greatly in profile and
importance since 1996 when it began to be broadcast on NBC and its
audience skyrocketed.
</P>
<P>
   The oft-stated reason is that the Golden Globes are predictors
of the upcoming and much more important Academy Awards, which are
voted by members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and
Sciences. In fact, what luck the Globes have had in predicting the
Oscars has largely come because of the dual nominating system of
the Globes, in which separate sets of nominees are named for
dramatic films and for comedy or musical films, so the association
has 10 nominees to the Oscar's five and thus twice the chance of
stumbling upon the eventual Oscar winner.

UNDERDOG TITANS EARN RESPECT WITH AFC CHAMPIONSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ No one, it seems, was willing to give the
Tennessee Titans any respect.
</P>
<P>
   Despite beating Jacksonville twice in the regular season and
outlasting the Buffalo Bills and Indianapolis Colts in the
playoffs, the nomadic Titans entered the AFC Championship Game
Sunday a 7-point underdog to the Jaguars.
</P>
<P>
   No problem.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans remedied their season-long respect problem the same
way they handled this game at Alltel Stadium: They took it.
</P>
<P>
   The underappreciated, and now Super Bowl-bound, Titans broke
open a close game by using a safety and an 80-yard punt return to
score nine points in 17 seconds during the third quarter in
coasting to a 33-14 victory before a disbelieving and disgruntled
crowd of 75,206 mostly Jaguars fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``My only regret,'' offered Titans defensive coordinator Gregg
Williams as wild celebration broke out around him on the field
seconds after the game, ``is that we don't play them a fourth
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Titans will meet the NFC champion St. Louis Rams
next Sunday in Super Bowl XXXIV at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've prepared for a lot of things over the years; I didn't
prepare for this, so bare with me,'' an emotional Titans coach Jeff
Fisher said after the franchise that moved from Houston to
Tennessee three years ago advanced to its first Super Bowl. ``We're
there, but we're not finished yet. The goal is to win the
championship and be the world champions.''
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected outcome left the Jaguars trying to explain what
had gone so wrong on a day they expected only their best. They
turned the ball over six times. They committed nine penalties for
100 wrong-way yards. They dropped four passes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frustration, yes. Disappointment, yes. The whole day is
frustrating,'' Jaguars coach Tom Coughlin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give (the Titans) a lot of credit. Any team that can come in
here and beat us twice (at home) in one year, I take my hat off
to.''
</P>
<P>
   If he hadn't taken his hat off to them, the Titans'
opportunistic and aggressive defense undoubtedly would have taken
it from him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all the times to do it, we did today,'' Jaguars quarterback
Mark Brunell said of the turnovers and other miscues that choked
the life from Jacksonville's comeback hopes. It was unfortunate.
Bad reads. Bad blocking. Bad throws. You can't afford a game like
this, especially against a team like the Titans.''
</P>
<P>
   The Titans made up for being outgained (360 yards to 289),
outpassed (216-112) and outnumbered _ they lost free safety Marcus
Robertson and wide receiver Yancy Thigpen to first-half injuries _
by making big plays. Lots of them.
</P>
<P>
   --There was Steve McNair's 9-yard touchdown pass to Thigpen on
third down to tie the score at 7 in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   --There was Robertson's interception of a Brunell pass after the
Jaguars had driven to the Titans' 6-yard line in the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   --There was Steve Jackson's recovery of a muffed punt to set up
a Titans field goal just before the half.
</P>
<P>
   --There was McNair lowering his head and ramming his 225-pound
body into the end zone to give Tennessee a 17-14 lead in the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   --There was the defense twice stopping the Jaguars on downs in
the final 16 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   --There was McNair exploding up the gut for 51 yards on a
third-down scramble to set up his 1-yard TD that pushed the Titans'
lead to 33-14.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest plays on this day of big plays came in that
17-second span of the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   After Jaguars linebackers Kevin Hardy and Lonnie Martz teamed up
to force and recover a fumble by Titans tight end Frank Wycheck at
the Jacksonville 1-yard line, the Jags appeared to have regained
the momentum in a game where it had swung dramatically in both
directions.
</P>
<P>
   But on second down, Josh Evans, the Titans' 288-pound defensive
tackle, mauled his way past Jaguars guard Zach Wiegert and wrapped
his huge arms around Brunell's legs. Before Brunell could get rid
of the ball, Jason Fisk, the Titans' other defensive tackle, was
all over him for a safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just clubbed him to the inside and swimmed over him,'' Evans
said of the double move that gave him a clear path to Brunell.
``That was a momentum driver for us. We knew after the fumble we
had to get out there and make a play.
</P>
<P>
   ``A team like Jacksonville is so confident. Once we start doing
stuff like that, it seems like they started getting down,'' Evans
added. ``To them, they felt like they should blow us out and beat
the hell out of us. Once we started throwing punches back at them,
they started to give. We just have more heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Offered Brunell, the left-hander from the University of
Washington: ``I think there were a number of turning points, and
certainly that was a big play for them. Unfortunately for us, we
had the right play on, we had the right protection. We just got
beat.''
</P>
<P>
   The two-point play gave Tennessee a 19-14 lead with 5 minutes,
13 seconds remaining in the third quarter. But the opportunistic
Titans were not done yet.
</P>
<P>
   Derrick Mason took the ensuing free kick _ a punt by Bryan
Barker _ and returned it 80 yards for another score. Quicker than
Coughlin could tug on the bill of his cap and sputter, `What's
going on here?'' the Titans had a 26-14 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came out of the huddle saying, `This has got to be a
touchdown.''' Mason said. ``We've been so close the last two weeks.
We needed one, and we got one.''
</P>
<P>
   The Titans got it this time because Mason's special-teams mates
opened what he called ``a ridiculously huge hole.'' He then juked
past one Jaguar and Isaac Byrd took care of Barker, which allowed
Mason to veer back into what was then a vacant middle of the field.
</P>
<P>
   It was all Titans after that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that pretty much put a dagger in their heart,'' Mason
said. ``I shot a look at their sideline, and I don't know if they
really wanted to regroup after that one.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Coughlin: ``Our special teams were non-existent in terms of
our coverage. They were able to return kickoffs and punts despite
the fact that about everything we did through the week in practice
was to stop that. We knew we would have to neutralize their
outstanding field position. Obviously, we did not get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   The Titans did, for the third consecutive time against the
Jaguars and the third week in a row in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   That's why it is the Titans, and not the favored Jaguars, who
are off to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy this moment finally came for this team,'' said
McNair, who passed for only 112 yards but ran for 91 and two
scores. ``This team really dedicated themselves and deserves this
moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Who knows, they might even get some respect now.

OREGON STATE EMBARRASSES HUSKIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM MOORE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Huskies not only laid an egg Sunday, they
scrambled it and poached it. Looking for sunny side up? You
couldn't find it in the locker room, where the disposition was
somber and the outlook grim.
</P>
<P>
   A team that built its personality around hard work took the
afternoon off, allowing Oregon State to frolic all over KeyArena
and post a 74-57 victory.
</P>
<P>
   It was an inexplicable development to all involved. The Beavers
are more accustomed to dragging their feet out of enemy territory,
going 3-34 in their previous 37 Pac-10 road games.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies, even if overmatched, usually defend the homecourt,
losing their last two KeyArena games in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   And Washington had never lost to Oregon State in Seattle during
Bob Bender's seven years here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a whole lot of answers for you,'' the coach told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   His players didn't either, failing to come up with responses
during and after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even know what to say,'' junior guard Greg Clark said.
``We flat out got embarrassed, we really did.''
</P>
<P>
   With emphasis on flat. Washington answered the opening tip with
no hint of urgency or intensity, and Oregon State rolled to leads
of 8-0, 19-3, 31-9 and 45-18.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has a tradition in which fans stand at the start of a
game until the Huskies score. The few that stuck it out didn't sit
down until Deon Luton drained a 3-pointer nearly five minutes after
the opening tip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's got the pride? Who's got the pride?'' Bender shouted at
his players during the first timeout. ``They're dictating
everything!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Where's the pride? Where?'' he shouted during the second
timeout.
</P>
<P>
   Bender himself was not an endearing sight. With the Beavers
racing to the rack and the Huskies backpedaling, Bender rode the
referees, wondering about calls in a public display of frustration.
</P>
<P>
   The Beavers tore it up, inside and out, Clifton Jones collecting
unlucky numbers for the Huskies _ 13 points and 13 rebounds.
Ramunas Petraitis is hard to pronounce and defend, the Lithuanian
scoring 17 points to lead Oregon State. And Deaundra Tanner, the
Beavers' director, supplied several key baskets on his way to 13
points.
</P>
<P>
   Washington countered with two scoring leaders, the familiar name
belonging to Deon Luton, who had 12 points. Surprisingly, David
Dixon did too. The 280-pound junior college transfer had gone
0-for-10 in his UW career before finally showing his advertised
power moves.
</P>
<P>
   None of his blows were enough to startle the Beavers, who
resisted a surge that got the Huskies within 59-49. Oregon State
scored the next 12 points to secure the win and prompt the
curiosity about Bender's team.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies are 6-12 overall and 1-5 in Pac-10 play, losing five
conference games in a row for the first time in five years. The
streak could very well grow to six on Thursday when Washington
plays at No. 2 Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly a team on its heels,'' Bender said. ``If there
are some guys with heads down, can we get 'em back up? If not, we
have to go to other people.''
</P>
<P>
   Personnel and playing-time changes loom with Dixon, Marlon
Shelton, Bryan Brown and Ben Coffee figuring more prominently.
Senque Carey will still have his significant role at the point, but
he needs to find a way to be more productive _ for the second
consecutive game, the sophomore guard was scoreless in the first
half.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's struggling, no question,'' Bender said.
</P>
<P>
   Bender harped on the togetherness theme in his post-game review,
the importance of which apparently is lost on the Huskies, who
can't get it done individually but try to anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's down, everyone's upset, everyone's trying to figure
out what's wrong, why we're losing,'' Dixon said. ``If we come
together, I don't think anyone in the conference can beat us.''
</P>
<P>
   As it is, without defense and team play, the Huskies are a game
out of last place.

KANSAS CITY CHIEFS' DERRICK THOMAS INJURED IN AUTO ACCIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 ADAM TEICHER AND MARK MORRIS  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Nine-time Chiefs Pro Bowler Derrick Thomas
was seriously injured Sunday in a single-car accident on Interstate
435 in Kansas City, North, that killed one person and injured
another, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas and another passenger, who was pronounced dead at the
scene, were thrown from the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   A source close to the family, who asked not to be identified,
said that as Thomas was treated at the scene, he was conscious and
said he had no feeling in his legs.
</P>
<P>
   Later at the Liberty Hospital emergency room in Liberty, Mo.,
Thomas, 33, reportedly still had no feeling in his legs.
</P>
<P>
   A close friend, who also asked not to be identified, said
physicians made a preliminary diagnosis that Thomas was suffering
from a broken vertebra in his back and that his spinal cord had
been damaged, but not severed.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians also said he may be able to walk again, though not
play football, the friend said.
</P>
<P>
   Reports from the Missouri Highway Patrol identified the man who
was killed as Michael D. Tellis, 49, of Kansas City, Kan., a friend
of Thomas' who once was a business partner in a limousine venture.
</P>
<P>
   A third man, John C. Hagebusch, 34, of Raymore, Mo., suffered
minor injuries in the accident. He was taken to Liberty Hospital
but was not admitted. Only Hagebusch was wearing his seat belt,
according to the Missouri Highway Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   Chiefs President and General Manager Carl Peterson would not
confirm the nature of Thomas' injuries, only their severity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been seriously injured,'' Peterson said. ``The extent
of those injuries are still being determined. He is alert,
comfortable, stable and will be in the hospital in Liberty
overnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are following the dictates of the medical people and will
provide you with information as it becomes available to us. We ask
for Kansas City fans and fans everywhere for their prayers for
Derrick.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Crossett, Liberty Hospital administrator, said members of
Thomas' family had asked the hospital not to discuss his injuries
in detail.
</P>
<P>
   Other members of the Chiefs organization reacted to news of
Thomas' accident with shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's devastating to me,'' coach Gunther Cunningham said Sunday
night. ``Forget about the football aspect of it. He has given a lot
to this city and to this organization. It's a tough thing to deal
with.''
</P>
<P>
   Teammates also were stunned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm shocked,'' tight end Tony Gonzalez said. ``It's
unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just been praying for him, his family and for Mike and
his family,'' said fullback Tony Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson, who was attending the NFC championship game between
the Rams and Buccaneers on Sunday in St. Louis, tried to leave
early to return to Kansas City, said Chiefs public relations
director Bob Moore. However, weather prevented Peterson from
catching a flight in.
</P>
<P>
   Chiefs owner Lamar Hunt also planned to return to Kansas City
from Jacksonville, Fla., where he awarded the AFC Championship
trophy that bears his name to the Tennessee Titans.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas was reportedly on his way to Kansas City International
Airport to catch a flight to St. Louis for the game, where he had
sideline passes.
</P>
<P>
   According to the police report, Thomas was driving about 1:30
p.m. when he lost control of the vehicle on the snow- and
ice-covered road. The car traveled into the median and rolled
several times.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas and Tellis were thrown from the vehicle. Tellis was
pronounced dead at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' 1999 Chevrolet Suburban looked as though it had rolled
at least twice, said tow truck driver Jerry Thomas, no relation to
Derrick Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The roof was smashed down in on it, I'd say at least 8 inches
on the driver's side,'' Jerry Thomas said. ``The hood was squashed
down on top.''
</P>
<P>
   The vehicle's right rear tire and brake drum was ripped off as
well, Jerry Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   The grassy median where Thomas crashed rests along a serene,
deserted stretch of I-435.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas arrived at Liberty Hospital about 2:30 p.m. and was
conscious when he came in, said Crossett, who briefed reporters
about 6:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians had not operated but had conducted diagnostic tests
on Thomas, Crossett said, declining to specify the nature of the
tests.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas was with family members, Liberty Hospital physicians and
Chiefs doctors. Thomas' mother, Edith Morgan, was in Orlando, Fla.,
earlier Sunday and didn't learn of her son's injury until she
returned to her Miami-area home later in the day. She was
attempting to reach Kansas City Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Crossett would not characterize Thomas' spirits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a number of calls, and there are a number of his
friends and family here,'' Crossett said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' sister was among the visitors. Other visitors included
Dennis Thum, the Chiefs' executive vice president and assistant
general manager, Jon Browne, team physician, and Joe Waeckerle, a
trauma specialist who works on the sidelines at Chiefs games.
</P>
<P>
   Teammates Marcus Spears and Bracy Walker and former teammate
Tracy Simien also were at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas has been one of the NFL's most dominant pass rushers. He
could single-handedly dominate games and became feared by opponents
for his ability to not only rush from a quarterback's blind side,
but also for his skill in creating turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas had a league-record seven sacks in a 1990 game against
Seattle. He had six sacks in a 1998 game against Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas had 20 sacks in 1990, putting him fifth on the NFL's
single-season list.
</P>
<P>
   His production slowed the past two seasons, and he was even
benched during running situations in 1998. But he was still
respected by opponents, who game-planned to account for Thomas on
every pass play.

KANSAS CITY CHIEFS' DERRICK THOMAS INJURED IN AUTO ACCIDENT 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Nine-time Chiefs Pro Bowler Derrick Thomas
was seriously injured Sunday in a single-car accident on Interstate
435 in Kansas City, North, that killed one person and injured
another, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas and another passenger, who was pronounced dead at the
scene, were thrown from the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   A source close to the family, who asked not to be identified,
said that as Thomas was treated at the scene, he was conscious and
said he had no feeling in his legs.
</P>
<P>
   Later at the Liberty Hospital emergency room in Liberty, Mo.,
Thomas, 33, reportedly still had no feeling in his legs.
</P>
<P>
   A close friend, who also asked not to be identified, said
physicians made a preliminary diagnosis that Thomas was suffering
from a broken vertebra in his back and that his spinal cord had
been damaged, but not severed.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians also said he may be able to walk again, though not
play football, the friend said.
</P>
<P>
   Reports from the Missouri Highway Patrol identified the man who
was killed as Michael D. Tellis, 49, of Kansas City, Kan., a friend
of Thomas' who once was a business partner in a limousine venture.
</P>
<P>
   A third man, John C. Hagebusch, 34, of Raymore, Mo., suffered
minor injuries in the accident. He was taken to Liberty Hospital
but was not admitted. Only Hagebusch was wearing his seat belt,
according to the Missouri Highway Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   Chiefs President and General Manager Carl Peterson would not
confirm the nature of Thomas' injuries, only their severity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been seriously injured,'' Peterson said. ``The extent
of those injuries are still being determined. He is alert,
comfortable, stable and will be in the hospital in Liberty
overnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are following the dictates of the medical people and will
provide you with information as it becomes available to us. We ask
for Kansas City fans and fans everywhere for their prayers for
Derrick.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Crossett, Liberty Hospital administrator, said members of
Thomas' family had asked the hospital not to discuss his injuries
in detail.
</P>
<P>
   Other members of the Chiefs organization reacted to news of
Thomas' accident with shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's devastating to me,'' coach Gunther Cunningham said Sunday
night. ``Forget about the football aspect of it. He has given a lot
to this city and to this organization. It's a tough thing to deal
with.''
</P>
<P>
   Teammates also were stunned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm shocked,'' tight end Tony Gonzalez said. ``It's
unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just been praying for him, his family and for Mike and
his family,'' said fullback Tony Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson, who was attending the NFC championship game between
the Rams and Buccaneers on Sunday in St. Louis, tried to leave
early to return to Kansas City, said Chiefs public relations
director Bob Moore. However, weather prevented Peterson from
catching a flight in.
</P>
<P>
   Chiefs owner Lamar Hunt also planned to return to Kansas City
from Jacksonville, Fla., where he awarded the AFC Championship
trophy that bears his name to the Tennessee Titans.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas was reportedly on his way to Kansas City International
Airport to catch a flight to St. Louis for the game, where he had
sideline passes.
</P>
<P>
   According to the police report, Thomas was driving about 1:30
p.m. when he lost control of the vehicle on the snow- and
ice-covered road. The car traveled into the median and rolled
several times.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas and Tellis were thrown from the vehicle. Tellis was
pronounced dead at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' 1999 Chevrolet Suburban looked as though it had rolled
at least twice, said tow truck driver Jerry Thomas, no relation to
Derrick Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The roof was smashed down in on it, I'd say at least 8 inches
on the driver's side,'' Jerry Thomas said. ``The hood was squashed
down on top.''
</P>
<P>
   The vehicle's right rear tire and brake drum was ripped off as
well, Jerry Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   The grassy median where Thomas crashed rests along a serene,
deserted stretch of I-435.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas arrived at Liberty Hospital about 2:30 p.m. and was
conscious when he came in, said Crossett, who briefed reporters
about 6:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians had not operated but had conducted diagnostic tests
on Thomas, Crossett said, declining to specify the nature of the
tests.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas was with family members, Liberty Hospital physicians and
Chiefs doctors. Thomas' mother, Edith Morgan, was in Orlando, Fla.,
earlier Sunday and didn't learn of her son's injury until she
returned to her Miami-area home later in the day. She was
attempting to reach Kansas City Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Crossett would not characterize Thomas' spirits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a number of calls, and there are a number of his
friends and family here,'' Crossett said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' sister was among the visitors. Other visitors included
Dennis Thum, the Chiefs' executive vice president and assistant
general manager, Jon Browne, team physician, and Joe Waeckerle, a
trauma specialist who works on the sidelines at Chiefs games.
</P>
<P>
   Teammates Marcus Spears and Bracy Walker and former teammate
Tracy Simien also were at the hospital.

   Thomas has been one of the NFL's most dominant pass rushers. He
could single-handedly dominate games and became feared by opponents
for his ability to not only rush from a quarterback's blind side,
but also for his skill in creating turnovers.
</P>

THORNTON BRUINS' FAR-LESS-ORDINARY JOE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ He is still only 20 years old, hardly a grizzled
veteran, but Bruins center Joe Thornton has changed a lot since he
was first introduced to Boston fans after being drafted with the
No. 1 pick three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The FleetCenter was simulcasting part of the event, which was
taking place in Pittsburgh in June 1997, and Thornton was able to
greet his newest fans immediately. But even before that day, the
expectations for Thornton _ both reality-based and fantastically
silly _ were difficult for anyone to handle.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Thornton has had to work through all kinds of
situations. There was the expectations vs. reality scenario, there
was the rookie getting his feet wet scenario, there was the
rookie's first slump scenario. On top of that, there were injuries,
benchings, and lectures from the coaches. At one point last year, a
frustrated Thornton said he wasn't sure exactly what message he was
supposed to be getting.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the on-ice challenges, Thornton had to learn
basic lifestyle skills such as proper nutrition, working out
regularly, and one of the most difficult _ learning to deal with
fame.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, he's maintained his sense of humor, his modesty,
and his purpose. When he discusses being a better player now, he
knows exactly what he is talking about instead of guessing how it
might be someday.
</P>
<P>
   There is still much to be learned, but Thornton has mastered
enough by now that he's no longer confused by the demands of his
job. Thornton still has some inconsistencies to iron out, but it's
clear that coach Pat Burns is right when he says Thornton can be as
good as he wants to be.
</P>
<P>
   Thornton's latest challenge is assuming a greater role in
double-shifting. With center Jason Allison out of commission after
wrist surgery, Thornton and Anson Carter have had to carry the bulk
of the center duties. For example, in Saturday's 4-3 overtime loss
to the Florida Panthers, Thornton played 25 minutes 47 seconds over
29 shifts. The only forward who played more was Panthers superstar
Pavel Bure, against whom Thornton played much of the night.
</P>
<P>
   Thornton centered the top defensive line with left wing P.J.
Axelsson and right wing Rob DiMaio. He also rotated with several
other players, such as playing on a line with Steve Heinze and Joe
Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   Offensively, Thornton is well ahead of his sophomore season.
Through 48 games, Thornton has 12 goals and 39 points. It took him
81 games last year to get 16 goals and 41 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to get better real quick,'' he said. ``I think I'm
pushing myself each and every day right now. I'm getting a lot of
ice time, so I can't complain about that. I just want to keep
bettering myself each and every day and just hopefully be a (much
better) player at the end of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter and Thornton both said when Allison was sidelined they
knew they were going to have to assume a good amount of the
offensive responsibility. Thornton said he's OK with that.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a key player like Jason goes out of the lineup, a lot of
us have got to pick up our games,'' said Thornton. ``I've got a lot
of weight on my shoulders right now and I just want to go out there
and help the team win as much as I can.''
</P>
<P>
   To do that, Burns is going to have to play Thornton more than
ever. That also suits him just fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good out there,'' he said. ``I feel strong. I like
being on the ice all the time. It's been pretty good for me so
far.''
</P>
<P>
   Thornton admitted that he has had to juggle his mindset slightly
to handle the dual roles of shutting down the other teams' top
lines while trying to generate offense. Burns has often said the
two go hand in hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like playing against Bure,'' said Thornton. ``He likes to
sneak back there (in order to get open). You've got to be a little
cautious when he's out there. Robbie and P.J. are good offensive
players as well, so if we get the puck in the other team's end a
lot, they can't get any offensive chances on us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins have a tough road the rest of the season, and the
push to make it to the postseason is on. Thornton said the fact
Boston earned 5 of a possible 6 points on its three-game road trip
has it back on track _ especially the point against the Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We outshot them, we were in their end a lot, and we played
right with them,'' he said. ``We knew it was going to be tough. I
think we're pretty happy we got the point.''
</P>
<P>
   The same likely could be said of Thornton himself.

`SOFT' SONICS COLLAPSE; GRANT, PAYTON BLAST TEAMMATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ There were times when Sonics coach Paul Westphal
violently slammed his water bottle near the bench.
</P>
<P>
   But after the Sonics were dominated Sunday in a 94-77 loss to
the Toronto Raptors, Westphal showed restraint. It was clearly
difficult and safe to assume his words might have been fierce, too.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing held back Gary Payton and Horace Grant. They were
the ones uncut and uncensored before the Sonics left Air Canada
Centre.
</P>
<P>
   They are tired of this.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of hustle. The lack of rebounding. The lack of help,
dedication, desire and heart on the Sonics. Essentially, Grant and
Payton are exhausted, mentally and physically, and sick of being
associated with a ``soft'' team.
</P>
<P>
   So the two guys most revered for being warriors said as much
after the Sonics dropped their second straight game on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of sugar-coating this (expletive),'' Grant said.
``If the big guys don't get in there and rebound, we're not going
to win. Anybody can score given the opportunity but it takes a real
man to go down there and rebound and play defense and have some
heart doing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been reading our press clippings too much. That has to
stop. Period. Right now, we're not hustling. Guys want to score.
You don't win championships like that. You don't win games like
that. This is ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Payton vehemently agreed, alluding that the team's recent
seven-game win streak was a mirage.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of guys on this team are not playing,'' Payton said.
``Either we're going to have to do something about it, or these
guys are going to have to sit down. We can't win with just me doing
everything, then a couple of guys coming here and there. We've got
to have consistency every night, and we don't have that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The starting five is just ridiculous, from me to everybody,''
Payton said. ``Every now and then we play good, and want to come
back and revert to this (stuff). That's not the sign of a good
team. That's the sign of a team that got satisfied, and we're going
to fool around and go on another losing streak. We have to
understand we haven't proven anything. We've got some good wins,
but this defeats what we did when we had a seven-game streak. We've
got another big game (Monday against the New York Knicks) that we
need, and we don't even know how we're going to respond.''
</P>
<P>
   Payton and Grant did not say specific names. However, some of
their comments clearly had to do with power forward Vin Baker. At
6-foot-11, Baker is not a consistent force down low.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from shaky defense, Baker is often out of position for
rebounds because he lags on the perimeter looking for outside
shots.
</P>
<P>
   One example would be when Baker found himself in a mismatch
against 5-foot-3 Muggsy Bogues. Instead of posting Bogues under the
basket, Baker shot a fadeaway jumper and missed.
</P>
<P>
   Baker finished with just six rebounds in 35 minutes on a day
when the Sonics were beaten 53-34 on the boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all you need to know,'' said Westphal, who spoke
abruptly.
</P>
<P>
   As a team, the Sonics appeared confused running their offense,
which is partly why they tied a season-low for points. Those inept
qualities are nothing new but were hidden during the team's winning
streak because of Payton's stellar play and Grant covering for
teammates in the paint.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no hustle,'' said Grant, who is always assigned to
defend the opponents' best post player. ``It takes every guy out
there to hustle, not just a couple of guys. If one guy breaks down,
it just breaks down our defense. ... But it's stopping now. If I
offend someone after (Sunday), if they don't get in there and
rebound, (forget) it. The hell with it. Guys know who they are.
They should look themselves in the mirror.''
</P>
<P>
   Payton was slightly less diplomatic. The 6-foot-4 point guard
said this team needs toughness from several players. Baker stands
out because he signed a seven-year, $86 million contract last
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys down low have got to play basketball. When I go to
the basket teams are trying to beat me down,'' Payton said.
``They're trying to make a statement saying we don't want him to
come back in there. Our guys don't do that. Somebody will come in
there for a wide-open layup and we let them. Put them on their back
sometimes and make them understand they can't go in there.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the scouting report probably is if you go to the basket
you can get to the basket. That's the way we play. We play soft all
the way around. We've been working on defense for three months and
we don't know nothing. We don't know how to switch. We don't know
how to get through picks. We don't know nothing. And a good team
will beat us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Raptors (21-19) are talented. But they are a young and
inexperienced group the Sonics should beat. If anything, the Sonics
had been proficient in beating the weaker teams.
</P>
<P>
   But following a 111-86 loss at Boston with a subpar showing
against Toronto is perhaps what led to the verbal diatribe.
</P>
<P>
   After falling behind 53-43 at halftime, the Sonics trailed by as
many as 17 points in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics showed fight only after Westphal inserted Chuck
Person for Baker with 3:15 left in the third. Person, Payton,
Grant, Jelani McCoy and Emanual Davis were mostly responsible for
getting the Sonics within 78-71 with 7:18 left in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chuck is 35 years old and if he comes in and outhustles the
young guys, that's a shame. A crying shame,'' Payton said. ``These
young guys on our team are only 20, 23, 24 years old. If he comes
in and outhustles them, they should be ashamed. ... Don't come in
there lackadaisical, let people push you around and don't get
rebounds. What are you out there for? But that's the way we play.''
</P>
<P>
   Payton and Grant said they did not say anything to the media
that they haven't said behind closed doors.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't want to respond, you're not taking your job
right,'' Payton said.

PIERCE STATUS HOT TOPIC WITH CELTICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ There is no snow here. The Celtics got out of Charlotte,
N.C., and its wintry grip and landed here early Sunday, where the
weather was exponentially better. Rick Pitino can only hope the
basketball is as well.
</P>
<P>
   The team plays Monday night in the new American Airlines Arena,
where the Heat have been, well, tepid. (Miami played in Houston
Sunday &UR;  &LR; night.) Miami hasn't been in its new digs for even a month
and already has lost to Chicago, New Jersey, and Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   But Miami's problems are not high on Pitino's list. He has other
things on his mind, such as the status of Paul Pierce. Boston's
best all-purpose player pulled his left hamstring Saturday night
and played only 11 minutes vs. the Hornets.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics without Pierce are not a pretty sight. He missed
seven games in December with an ankle sprain and they went 1-6 in
that span. They were 0-2 last year when he was out. If you add
Saturday night's performance, the team is 1-9 in games Pierce
either missed or was injured.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that the team had two days between games and
Pierce said he did not think his injury was serious. The rest
should help him. But it won't help Eric Williams, who is going on
the injured list (knee), possibly Monday or Tuesday. Adrian Griffin
(sprained ankle) isn't ready yet, but he will be activated to take
Williams's roster spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely need the time with all the injuries we have and
everyone being hurt,'' forward Antoine Walker said. ``Hopefully,
we'll be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffin, who has been out since Jan. 8, is due to return to
practice Monday. He may even be activated, although Pitino said
Griffin won't be able to play immediately. He's still limping
slightly.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two weeks, Griffin said he spent 6-9 hours a day
in rehab, working in 2- to 3-hour shifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a lot of rehab,'' he said. ``But it also was tough. You
wish you could be out there contributing, and you can't.''

planes and fly to Bosnia. Ultimately, they will take command of the
American sector in NATO's multinational operation there. The
Pentagon has deployed Guard and Reserve units overseas before; more
than 265,000 were called up to support the Persian Gulf war in
1990. But the 49th's mission is something new. Not since the Korean
War has a National Guard division commanded an overseas operation.

   NYC-SUBWAY (New York) _ With the exception of radio, crude

train in the city subway system on more than 650 miles of track has
remained almost unchanged since the subways first started rolling
in 1904. Workers basically watch for trains coming into stations,
then note in writing the arrival and departure times. The exact
location of the trains is usually not known at any given moment.
But over the next three years, at a cost of $128 million, a
revolution will begin that will essentially drag the system out of

 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ With two minutes left and ahead by 19
points, the Tennessee Titans paced their sideline and offered mild
and measured congratulations among themselves. The Titans, though,
looked worried. They wondered if this three-peat against the
Jacksonville Jaguars was really complete, if their apparent spot in
Super Bowl XXXIV would somehow vanish in an odd twist of surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Was it truly over?
</P>
<P>
   Had Jacksonville hidden a miracle in its pocket? Or, indeed,
were the Tennessee Titans these playoffs' lone miracle team?
</P>
<P>
   With 1 minute 22 seconds left, Titans linebacker Eddie Robinson
forced a fumble _ the sixth Jacksonville turnover this afternoon _
and cornerback Denard Walker recovered the ball near midfield. Jeff
Fisher, the Tennessee coach, then jumped higher than any player had
managed all afternoon. Fisher leaped into the waiting arms of
Titans place-kicker Al Del Greco. Their embrace was joyful and
their words flowed while focusing on each others' eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's over with!'' Fisher yelled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going!'' Del Greco responded.
</P>
<P>
   To the Super Bowl. To play the St. Louis Rams, 11-6 winners over
Tampa Bay on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   As Fisher and Del Greco completed their merry spin, all of the
Tennessee Titans turned Jacksonville's Alltel Stadium into their
house. Their dance floor. Their party. It was fitting, especially
since the Titans had done that all afternoon in a too-physical,
too-confrontational, too-tough game for the Jaguars. It was
Tennessee in a breezy 33-14 victory in the American Football
Conference championship game Sunday before 75,206 fans, the largest
crowd ever in this stadium and the quickest group ever to exit,
exasperated after their Jaguars were disjointed and exposed.
</P>
<P>
   As the game's final seconds ticked away, the Titans _ having
scored the game's final 26 points _ were celebrating on the
sideline full throttle, handshakes and hugs all around. Some
players were even shooting with their own personal video cameras,
savoring the scene, the moments. Out came the AFC championship
shirts and hats. It was bizarre that in this conference
championship title game, with a Super Bowl berth at stake, with
Tennessee on the road trying to beat Jacksonville in a historic
manner, that the final seconds would end this way, not with any
twinge of drama, but so relaxed and carefree for the Titans.
</P>
<P>
   But that was exactly what happened for Tennessee, a team that
has won seven straight games. A team that opened its postseason
with a victory at home in the wild-card game, beating Buffalo on a
miracle lateral on a last-seconds kickoff, on a majestic play when
it seemed there was no Titans pulse, no Titans chance. A team that
won at Indianapolis against Peyton Manning and Edgerrin James and
Marvin Harrison, controlling a dynamic offensive threesome that few
teams contained this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Tennessee Titans are a team of destiny and more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were here today to make history!'' yelled receiver Yancey
Thigpen across the Titans' locker room. Thigpen, who will miss the
Super Bowl because of a broken right foot sustained Sunday, knew
that no team had ever won a conference championship game on the
road as part of a three-games-in-one-season sweep of an opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee did it Sunday and made glimmering history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe in ourselves, we've got a lot of talent, a lot of
depth, team speed and aggressive guys that fly to the ball and with
the ball,'' said Anthony Dorsett, a Titans safety. ``We expected
Jacksonville to start fast. We also expected them to be unable to
sustain that.''
</P>
<P>
   Those expectations became reality.
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville exploded to a 7-0 lead. Tennessee tied the game at
7-7. Jacksonville jumped ahead, 14-7, with 4:36 left before
halftime. And then, with 1:34 left, came one of the game's two
signature plays _ the Jaguars' Reggie Barlow fumbled a punt at his
19-yard line that was recovered by Titans safety Steve Jackson.
That play led to Del Greco's 34-yard field goal only 20 seconds
before halftime. The Jacksonville lead at halftime was 4 points
instead of 7.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee absorbed that momentum. It won the third quarter,
16-0. It won the final quarter, 7-0.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half there were two 1-yard touchdown runs by
quarterback Steve McNair, a safety and Derrick Mason's 80-yard
return of a free kick for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   A fast Jacksonville start _ and then a Jaguars crawl.
</P>
<P>
   ``They talked all week about matching us as a physical team,''
Thigpen said. ``But their mouth said one thing and their mind said
another. Any time you've already lost twice to a team that stays
close at the start of the next game, you start to doubt yourselves.
That's what they did. They made a lot of mistakes but we forced
them into some of those mistakes. They tried to get physical with
us, but if you haven't played that way all year, how are you going
to do that in one game?''
</P>
<P>
   In the second quarter, Jaguars quarterback Mark Brunell, on a
pass from the Tennessee 6, was intercepted in the Tennessee end
zone by safety Marcus Robertson. (Robertson later broke his left
ankle and, like Thigpen, will miss the Super Bowl.) And then, to
end the half, there was the Barlow fumble.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I looked up, they weren't that close to me,'' Barlow
said. ``But those guys came full speed and after I dropped it, I
should have just fallen on it. I messed up. I catch balls like that
every day during the week, in practice before the game, and that
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   After the first two turnovers, Jacksonville was tight. It would
make four more for a total of two interceptions and four fumbles.
It would commit nine penalties for 100 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``The penalties, the turnovers, you're not going to win football
games that way,'' said Tom Coughlin, the Jacksonville coach. ``They
work you to the point where you are the team that makes the errors.
When we play them, we find the way to make the errors. However it
happens, when we play Tennessee, we get a little out of our element
and we turn the ball over, for whatever reason. We were never able
to get the crowd back in the game and energize ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the stern Tennessee defense and the marvelous legs of
McNair that helped bury Jacksonville for good. In addition to
scoring twice in the second half, he offered the game's second
signature play in spectacular fashion.
</P>
<P>
   It was McNair's third-and-1 run of 51 yards to the Jacksonville
1 that set up his final 1-yard touchdown run, with 6:59 left. It
put the game squarely in Tennessee's hands. McNair scrambled nine
times for 91 yards, outrushing running back and teammate Eddie
George (25 carries, 86 yards).
</P>
<P>
   And McNair did it with a sore big toe that had hampered him in
practice all week. McNair passed for a touchdown and ran for two
more and that easily offset Brunell's 226 passing yards and minus-1
rushing yards.
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville too frequently lost both line battles. It got
pushed around more than it shoved. It could not effectively tackle
McNair.
</P>
<P>
   The game proved too big for too many Jaguars.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the fourth quarter came, they couldn't score and pretty
much knew it was over,'' Tennessee safety Blaine Bishop said.
``They knew we had their number.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tennessee Titans are made of miracles and more.

NAVY TORPEDOES HOLY CROSS 
</HEADLINE>
 CROSS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WORCESTER _ These are tough times for Holy Cross men's
basketball. Misfortune has clung to the Crusaders like a wet,
undersized T-shirt: Injuries often have kept them from practicing
at full strength, and have led coach Ralph Willard to use five
starting lineups involving 12 players.
</P>
<P>
   That's why a victory Sunday against Patriot League foe Navy
would have been a confidence-booster. Early in the second half, it
appeared the locals might pull off the upset against the third-best
team in the league; Holy Cross had outscrapped Navy, and with 17:29
to go trailed by only 3.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Crusaders' luck soured. Navy's John Williams sank a
3-pointer. Holy Cross's Josh Sankes, the team's best center, picked
up his fourth foul and went to the bench. Navy staged a 37-10 run,
attacking the undermanned Crusader interior.
</P>
<P>
   So much for momentum-builders. Holy Cross never threatened
again, and Navy went on to an 81-49 rout before a Hart Center crowd
of 2,173 (many of them stuck around to cheer on the home team even
when the outcome was well in hand).
</P>
<P>
   The loss dropped Holy Cross to 6-11, 1-3 in the league, and
marked its sixth loss in eight games. Sankes and Jared Curry led
the Crusaders with 9 points each. Curry added a team-high seven
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Willard knows when his team returns to full stength, it could be
formidable. It recorded wins against Providence and
Alabama-Birmingham this season.
</P>
<P>
   But will it return to full strength? Two starters, Juan Pegues
and Patrick Whearty, have each missed 11 consecutive games. Guard
Ryan Serravalle (4 points Sunday) has missed 10 games with knee
problems, while Curry has missed eight with back problems.
</P>
<P>
   It got so bad that one player who didn't make the roster _ James
Stowers _ was invited back when the injuries hit. He flew from his
native Florida and joined the team at the Hoosier Classic in
Indianapolis and scored 14 points against UAB.
</P>
<P>
   If Holy Cross could be so fortunate the rest of the season. ``We
have so many injuries you can't simulate a good five-on-five in
practice,'' said Willard. ``When you get in game situations, it
just seems like they keep running athletes at you.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the Crusaders played tough defense on Navy pivot Sitatha
Savane, and it limited the Senegalese senior's effectiveness. But
when Sankes went to the bench with foul trouble, Savane took
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   He scored 10 points during the Midshipmen's surge and finished
with a game-high 22, with team highs in rebounds (6) and blocks
(5). His free throws with 5:42 left made the score 64-36.

JETS SETTLE ON GROH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ The New York Jets will name Al Groh their
coach Monday and also will announce that former coach Bill Parcells
will remain in an advisory capacity for the immediate future.
</P>
<P>
   Groh, who has coached under Parcells for more than 15 years, was
linebackers coach of the Jets the past three years and defensive
coordinator with the Patriots when they went to the Super Bowl
under Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   Groh was the personal choice of Parcells after Bill Belichick
resigned from the position less than 48 hours after becoming coach
Jan. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick, by a contractual arrangement he had with late Jets
owner Leon Hess, moved into place as head man when Parcells retired
following the final game of the regular season against Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   However, two days later, Belichick resigned and subsequently
filed a grievance with National Football League commissioner Paul
Taglaibue trying to free himself from the Jets to accept an offer
as coach and general manager of the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Tagliabue ruled against Belichick, saying he had a
contract for the next three years with the Jets and he could not
coach in the league during that time unless allowed to do so by the
Jets.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots offered New York two draft choices, neither in the
top two rounds, to pry Belichick loose, but the Jets rejected the
deal. Reportedly they still are looking for a first-round and a
middle-round pick as compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells and new Jets owner Robert Wood Johnson IV met with Groh
over the weekend, the first time Johnson had met Groh. But after
the meeting, Johnson decided to go along with the strong
recommendation by Parcells, who considered Groh the best available
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   There was no movement on the Belichick issue over the weekend,
which is fueling speculation that the Patriots are losing interest
in Belichick and turning their attention toward such candidates as
University of Miami coach Butch Davis and reportedly Jacksonville
defensive coordinator Dom Capers.
</P>
<P>
   Davis has said in the last couple of weeks that he wants to stay
at Miami. There also have been reports Davis might be the next
coach in Dallas, where he served on Jimmy Johnson's staff when the
Cowboys won two Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   Romeo Crennel, longtime defensive line coach with the Giants,
Patriots, and Jets under Parcells, left over the weekend to become
defensive coordinator with Chris Palmer in Cleveland, leaving New
York depleted on the defensive side of its staff.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Belichick was the coordinator, Groh the linebackers
coach, and Crennel the line coach. The Jets' offensive staff is
expected to stay intact, with the possible exception of coordinator
Charley Weis, who testified on behalf of Belichick in the grievance
hearing and is very close to Belichick.

PATRIOTS EXPLORE PLAN B

<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ There were no talks over the weekend between
the Patriots and Jets regarding compensation to free Bill Belichick
from his contract with New York, so New England began to formulate
an alternative regarding its coaching situation.
</P>
<P>
   With Jacksonville being knocked out of the playoffs Sunday, the
Patriots have asked for permission to speak to Jaguars defensive
coordinator Dom Capers about their coaching job, according to two
sources close to the Patriots. And New England will interview
former Pittsburgh director of football operations Tom Donahoe for
the general manager's job Tuesday in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick's attorney said Sunday &UR;  &LR; night he expects to file an
antitrust suit against the NFL Monday in federal court in New York.
Jeffrey Kessler said commissioner Paul Tagliabue's decision Friday
was ``a travesty'' and said Belichick's legal team will pursue all
avenues to make sure the coach is free to seek jobs without it
requiring compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Kessler also will seek a temporary restraining order against the
Jets that would allow Belichick to negotiate with another team.
</P>
<P>
   If the Patriots or another team can work out compensation, the
lawsuit would be dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Capers-Donahoe likely would come as a team, having worked
together for three years in Pittsburgh (1992-95) when Capers was
defensive coordinator under Bill Cowher and Donahoe was director of
football operations, a position he held until he was fired at the
end of the season, losing a power struggle with Cowher.
</P>
<P>
   Donahoe has been highly sought after. He could take the GM job
in Miami and work with another friend, Dave Wannstedt. But Donahoe
is attempting to see if he and Capers would be attractive to teams
looking for a coach-GM tandem. Another team that might be
interested would be New Orleans. Dallas also has a coaching
vacancy, but is reportedly looking for someone more offense-minded.
</P>
<P>
   By talking with Capers and Donahoe, the Patriots may be sending
a message to the Jets that they could get nothing for Belichick if
they don't play ball. There is also speculation that University of
Miami coach Butch Davis is moving up on their list.
</P>
<P>
   Capers's Jacksonville defense didn't have the best of games in a
33-14 loss to Tennessee in Sunday's AFC Championship Game. But
Capers is known for being tough and instilling discipline, and he
has experience leading a team into the playoffs. His resume is
similar to Belichick's in that regard.
</P>
<P>
   Capers was 31-35 from 1995-98 in Carolina, but was fired after
going 4-12 and replaced by George Seifert. He landed as Tom
Coughlin's defensive coordinator in Jacksonville and upgraded an
already decent defense.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets have scheduled a news conference for Monday to announce
they've signed Al Groh to a five-year deal to be their new coach.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots own the 16th pick in the first round and are trying
to hold on to it, figuring they could get a top offensive lineman
or Wisconsin running back Ron Dayne.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have backed off on former Kansas City coach Marty
Schottenheimer, who also would require compensation.

WAR IS HELL FOR BUCS ON TWO FRONTS 
</HEADLINE>
 CHAMPIONSHIP-ANALYSIS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ The Tampa Bay Buccaneers love to talk about war.
They say pro football is more than a game and more than a
billion-dollar industry. It is 60 nationally televised minutes of
blood sport. They say they have the scars, broken bones, and
chilling stories to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   I don't necessarily agree with that. I think Warren Sapp would
rather land on the turf at Trans World Dome than the sand at
Normandy Beach. But let's use the Bucs' battle terminology to gain
an understanding of their 11-6 NFC Championship Game loss to the
Rams Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   There is at least one enemy in every war, but the Bucs had two
working against them here. The enemies worked the same way running
backs Mike Alstott and Warrick Dunn should have worked. That is,
they did damage inside and out.
</P>
<P>
   Public Enemy No. 1: The NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Public Enemy No. 1A: Mike Shula.
</P>
<P>
   The first one, the outsider, is obvious. In the final 51
seconds, the league's officials affected the outcome of the game.
This should never happen. The NFL has a replay policy which states
that, in the final two minutes, officials automatically control and
review questionable calls. I don't think there is anything in the
rules that gives the officials the right for absurd nitpicking,
which is what they did Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   With less than a minute remaining and the Bucs facing a
second-and-22 at the Rams 35, Tampa quarterback Shaun King threw a
pass receiver Bert Emanuel caught at the 23. Emanuel caught the
ball, but replay official Jerry Markbreit (one of my all-time
favorites, by the way) challenged the catch. I wouldn't have had a
problem if Markbreit had said that the ball hit the ground.
Instead, he said he thought Emanuel used the ground to help him
make the catch. Even after replays, it was hard to say that
definitively.
</P>
<P>
   Before Bucs coach Tony Dungy realized that the completion was
being challenged, he used his final timeout of the game.
Essentially, the officials affected his game management as well
because he used a timeout even though their review was going to
stop the clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used the ground to assist that catch,'' referee Bill
Carollo said. ``And because the ball hit the ground, by rule it's
an automatic incomplete pass.''
</P>
<P>
   This is supposed to be war? In war, a soldier doesn't plant a
claymore mine and then have an official step in and say, ``Well,
that doesn't count because you were too far out of your bunker when
you positioned the claymore.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point, I should tell you one of my deepest sports
secrets: In the last minute of any game, I become a borderline
hypocrite. I may scream for a penalty in the second quarter and
hope that the same penalty is ignored in the final 60 seconds.
Sometimes, I wish there were a playground-type, self-policing
system in the final minute. If someone is guilty of blatant
cheating, you call it. Everything else? Please, swallow the
whistle.
</P>
<P>
   As you can imagine, the officials' intrusion took the glimmer
out of an overall dreadful game. Instead of third and 10 it was
third and 23. There were two incompletions and the game was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they told me it wasn't a catch,'' Emanuel said, ``I was
like, `I can't believe it. Why?' All they told me was that the
replay official said I didn't catch it. There's no doubt in my mind
that I did.''
</P>
<P>
   For those Rams fans who are waiting for me to say, ``The Rams
were simply the better team Sunday,'' well, I can't say it because
I don't believe it. I think the Rams were fun to watch in the
regular season and just as entertaining in their divisional playoff
win over the Vikings. But they played two playoff teams in the
regular season and lost to both of them. One of the losses was to
their Super Bowl opponent, the Tennessee Titans.
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't played a defense like us all year,'' Sapp said of
the Rams. ``If they didn't learn from what we did to them, I
guarantee you that they will have some major problems with
Tennessee in the Super Bowl. I guarantee you that.''
</P>
<P>
   At least they will have the opportunity to have problems. The
Bucs will not have that luxury, in part, because Shula is their
offensive coordinator. Now, there are two very good things about
Shula. One is that he went to Dartmouth. Another is that his father
is one of the greatest coaches in the history of the game. But
neither fact has anything to do with calling good plays.
</P>
<P>
   Consider that the Bucs had drives that began at the Rams' 20,
45, 42, and 49 and could not score a touchdown. Alstott and Dunn
combined for 21 rushing attempts, which is about 20 attempts short
of where they should have been. I don't know if I was seeing things
after the game, but Shula's play-calling was so conservative his
entire body seemed to be leaning to the right.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Sapp sat at his locker with a wad of tobacco
stuffed in his mouth. He would say a few words and then spit,
littering a white towel with tiny brown drops. He was hurt and he
was angry. He talked about war. It's one thing to talk about a war.
It's a bit more painful to acknowledge how you lost it.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BEVERLY HILLS -- The Hollywood Foreign Press Association went
for sex and star power Sunday night in handing out the 57th annual
Golden Globes awards.
</P>
<P>
   Superstars like Tom Cruise and Jim Carrey (``the Tom Hanks of
the Golden Globes'') took home some of the top prizes, and voters
also went for HBO's seductive comedy series ``Sex and the City'' as
well as the cable network's provocative ode to organized crime,
``The Sopranos.''
</P>
<P>
   ``American Beauty'' was also a big winner, taking home Globes
for best picture (drama), director Sam Mendes and screenwriter Alan
Ball. ``Toy Story 2'' was named best picture, comedy.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the Globes have taken on a weightier legitimacy
as a gauge of Hollywood's most revered treasure hunt -- the Academy
Awards.
</P>
<P>
   As such, last night paid huge dividends for such stars as Cruise
(best supporting actor for ``Magnolia''), Denzel Washington (best
actor, drama, ``The Hurricane'') and Carrey (best actor in a comedy
or musical, ``Man on the Moon''). But then Carrey also won in the
same category last year, and was later denied an Oscar nomination
for a much worthier film, ``The Truman Show.'' Leave it the Academy
to compound the error by nominating him this year. ``I'm the
establishment I once rejected,'' joked Carrey. ''I'm the Tom Hanks
of the Golden Globes.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington, who portrayed wrongfully imprisoned boxer Rubin
``Hurricane'' Carter, gave one of the evening's most eloquent
accept speeches. Bringing Carter to the podium, Washington said,
``When I was a kid, we used to say grace at the table. `God is
love.' This man right here is love. He lost 7,300 days of his life
and, still, he is all love.''
</P>
<P>
   Backstage Washington commented on his chances for an Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago I was standing here in this building for
`Glory.` It was a good night and it is a good night again.
Hopefully in a couple months it will be another good night again
(Oscar hopes). I can't say enough that this is about Rubin and the
story and how we wanted to share his life.''
</P>
<P>
   Actress Hilary Swank cemented her front-runner status in Oscar's
actress race, winning yet another prize for her gender-bending turn
in ``Boys Don't Cry.'' Swank acknowledged fellow nominee Meryl
Streep from the podium, calling her ``my acting god.''
</P>
<P>
   In her acceptance speech, Swank repeatedly referred to her
''Boy'' character as a man. (Brandon Teena was a woman who passed
herself off as a man.) Swank elaborated backstage.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I was trying to do was honor Brandon for what he wanted
when he died.''
</P>
<P>
   British stage star Janet McTeer certainly saw her Oscar
prospects improve as well, winning the best actress comedy award
for her role as the mother in the little-seen independent film
``Tumbleweeds.''
</P>
<P>
   McTeer wasn't buying into the Oscar hype.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is if I do go, I'll have to buy another frock.''
(Hopefully, she won't be soliciting any fashion tips from Courtney
Love.)
</P>
<P>
   One of the evening's most popular winners was Michael J. Fox,
who won his fourth Globe and third consecutive honor for his work
on the ABC comedy ``Spin City.'' (It was the only award given to a
network television program. HBO won eight Globes; Showtime took
two.)
</P>
<P>
   Fox announced Wednesday that he would not be returning to ``Spin
City'' in order to focus his energies on battling the Parkinson's
disease which afflicts him.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mission tonight is not to weep,'' an emotional Fox said
backstage. ``Bittersweet is the word that keeps coming out. It's a
very emotional moment.'' Fox added that he would like to see ``Spin
City'' continue.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise, like best television actress winner Sarah Jessica Parker
(``I've never even won a spelling bee,'' she howled), seemed
genuinely surprised by his win.
</P>
<P>
   Backstage, Cruise recounted his methods for getting into the
character of ``Magnolia's'' infomercial sex guru.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did practice those speeches with (wife) Nicole (Kidman),''
Cruise said. ``We just made sure the doors were closed so the kids
wouldn't hear.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbra Streisand was given the Cecil B. De Mille lifetime
achievement award. Shirley MacLaine gave Streisand the honor,
filling in for John Travolta. (Travolta canceled at the last minute
due to an eye infection.)
</P>
<P>
   ``What a great business; you get to age in public,'' Streisand
quipped after watching the highlight reel of her career.
</P>
<P>
   Backstage Streisand said, ``I don't enjoy performing in public.
I just don't like being up on stage strutting my stuff. I can't
explain it to you. I guess it's a shyness I have. It makes me feel
exhibitionist. When I was 18, I was fine with it. It's like I'm on
display now. That's why I enjoy directing so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Call the HFPA many things, but these people are not stupid. They
know what gets ratings. The award show was once considered a fun
but minor lead-up to the Oscars. Now it is considered a bellwether.
Many Globe winners go on to pick up Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   Also, in the past HFPA's ethics have been questioned. Three
years ago the group of foreign journalists instituted stricter
rules about accepting gifts.
</P>
<P>
   So if a fine actress like Angelina Jolie is awarded her third
consecutive Globe (``Someone must be paying you or something,'' she
joked), you can't exactly begrudge her the honor. She looks great.
(Even with the weird blue hair.)

 By JOHN McCLAIN  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ When the gun sounded Sunday and the first
Super Bowl appearance in franchise history was assured, it was a
magical moment for the Tennessee Titans, a team that suffered
through four tumultuous years as lame ducks in Houston and
vagabonds in Tennessee.
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the Titans were Oilers, they were called the biggest
chokers in NFL history. After their 33-14 victory over the
Jacksonville Jaguars in the AFC Championship Game, you can call the
Oilers/Titans a Super Bowl team for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   No one could blame them for the unabashed emotion they showed in
a postgame celebration during which some grown men cried as the
enormity of their accomplishment began to seep in.
</P>
<P>
   They are the last original AFL team to reach the Super Bowl, and
they are the first team in NFL history to sweep three games from an
opponent in a season with the third on the road. When they tangle
with St. Louis _ a team they defeated 24-21 on Oct. 31 _ they will
try to join the Oakland Raiders and Denver Broncos as the only
wild-card teams to win the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess you could say we're just a bunch of ordinary guys
doing an extraordinary thing,'' guard Bruce Matthews said after
earning his first trip to the Super Bowl in a 17-year career. ``The
circumstances we've played under the last few years have defined
this team. We're battle-hardened, and it shows in our character.''
</P>
<P>
   Titans owner Bud Adams, who co-founded the AFL in 1959 with
Kansas City Chiefs owner Lamar Hunt, was presented the Lamar Hunt
Trophy by _ who else? _ Lamar Hunt. The trophy goes to the AFC
champion each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's taken me 40 years to get this far, and at least I won't
have to go to the Super Bowl in a wheelchair,'' said Adams, 77.
``We have great fans in Nashville, but we had great fans in
Houston, too. We miss our Houston fans, and we appreciate their
support through the years.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston fans suffered through one disappointment after another,
but once the franchise changed its name, logo, colors and uniforms
and moved into its new stadium and practice facility, the Oilers
were transformed from frogs to princes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, we've all died and gone to heaven,'' offensive
tackle Brad Hopkins said in the jubilant Titans dressing room.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, they're just going to the Georgia Dome in Atlanta. And
no one can say they didn't earn the trip to Super Bowl XXXIV.
</P>
<P>
   After falling behind the Jaguars 14-7, the Titans scored 26
consecutive points before an Alltel Stadium crowd of 75,206. The
Titans forced six turnovers and followed the leadership of
quarterback Steve McNair, who overcame a severe case of turf toe to
rush for two touchdowns and throw for another.
</P>
<P>
   ``My only misgiving is that we won't be able to play them in the
Super Bowl,'' said Titans defensive coordinator Gregg Williams,
whose team allowed 16, 16 and 14 points in playoff victories over
Buffalo, Indianapolis and Jacksonville. ``They're so arrogant, they
continue to go to their money people even when nothing's there.''
</P>
<P>
   Familiarity breeds contempt, and the Titans and Jaguars don't
like each other. Many of the Tennessee players thought the Jaguars
were too cocky entering the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, they were pretty arrogant,'' Titans linebacker Barron
Wortham said. ``You know, if you haven't learned anything from two
butt-whippings, then you're going to get a third one.''
</P>
<P>
   The Titans outscored the Jaguars 94-47 in three games, forcing
13 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their hearts were in it, but their bodies couldn't take the
pounding we were giving them,'' Hopkins said.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans march on Atlanta with a 5-0 record in games against
teams with at least 13 victories. They defeated 14-2 Jacksonville
three times and 13-3 St. Louis and 13-3 Indianapolis once each.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always the underdogs, but we continue to prove the
naysayers wrong,'' Wortham said. ``When you experience adversity
like we did, it makes you hungry. It makes situations like that
almost second nature.''
</P>
<P>
   The Titans are eight-point underdogs against the Rams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've prepared for a lot of things over the years, but I've
never prepared for anything like this,'' Tennessee coach Jeff
Fisher said. ``This team's special. They've overcome so many
distractions. I wouldn't wish those four years on any team. We'll
reflect on those four years after next week. Our goal is still to
be world champion.''
</P>
<P>
   The Titans' seventh consecutive victory was earned the hard way.
The Jaguars scored a touchdown on their first series on Mark
Brunell's seven-yard pass to tight end Kyle Brady. The Titans
responded when McNair threw a nine-yard TD pass to Yancey Thigpen.
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville moved in front again when reserve running back
James Stewart broke loose for a 33-yard touchdown run for a 14-7
advantage. At that point, the Jaguars had the upper hand, but there
was a huge momentum change when Reggie Barlow fumbled Craig
Hentrich's punt and Steve Jackson made a diving recovery at the
Jacksonville 19.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans had to settle for Al Del Greco's 34-yard field goal
that pulled them within 14-10 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   ``No defense plays harder than ours,'' Fisher said. ``They
challenged the receivers and attacked the ball. Our secondary
played as well as I've ever seen them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the guys we'd have to weather an early storm, and we
did. The key was coming back to score after they went up 7-0. In
the second half, we could see a little loss of enthusiasm on their
part. We were able to take advantage of the momentum swing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Titans blew open the game with a 16-point third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``That fumbled punt was a big play,'' Wortham said. ``They were
shocked. The guy dropped the ball, and everything changed. I don't
know if they quit then, but we kept pounding them. I thought they'd
do a better job of taking it to us, but they just seemed to lose
steam.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars could do nothing right in the third quarter. It was
just the opposite for the Titans.
</P>
<P>
   On their first series, they took advantage of a 15-yard penalty
for a late hit on McNair by defensive end Tony Brackens and a
28-yard interference penalty against cornerback Fernando Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   McNair, who led the Titans with 91 yards rushing _ five more
than Eddie George _ scored on a one-yard sneak. Del Greco's extra
point boosted the lead to 17-14.
</P>
<P>
   The next time they got the ball, the Titans lost it when tight
end Frank Wycheck fumbled at the one-yard line. That led to a
safety when Brunell was sacked in the end zone by tackles Josh
Evans and Jason Fisk to make it 19-14.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did all that roaring, but their bite sure wasn't
vicious,'' Titans defensive end Jevon Kearse said. ``The more hits
we put on Brunell, the slower he got up.''
</P>
<P>
   Receiver Derrick Mason broke open the game when he returned the
free kick after the safety 80 yards for a touchdown to make it
26-14.
</P>
<P>
   McNair finished the scoring with another one-yard sneak in the
fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing this team can't accomplish,'' Fisher said.
``When people told us we couldn't beat them three times, we didn't
even bat an eye. Right now, our goal is to win the Super Bowl.''

THE WAIT IS OVER: TITANS ANSWER DESTINY'S KNOCK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ Just as Bum Phillips swore that they would
do, the Houston Oilers kicked down the blanketty-blank door to the
Super Bowl yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Dan Pastorini was nowhere around. Bum neither,
for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   They are the Tennessee Titans now, which proves that the Federal
Witness Relocation Program really works. In Nashville, Tenn., Bum
and Earl's old team has forged a new beginning and, as of
yesterday, made a semblance of peace with its past.
</P>
<P>
   After all those years of frustration, of losing to the Steelers
and the Raiders and blowing a 32-point lead in Buffalo, owner K.S.
``Bud'' Adams' team has finally answered destiny's knock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forty years Mr. Adams has been trying to get here,'' head
coach Jeff Fisher said, after the Oilers-turned-Titans had silenced
the Jacksonville Jaguars, 33-14, in the AFC Championship Game.
``Forty years _ that's what this is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   In an afternoon of earnest, if not flawless, redemption,
quarterback Steve McNair, running back Eddie George and a swarming,
ball-hawking defense punched the franchise's ticket for Super Bowl
XXXIV.
</P>
<P>
   More than four years have passed since Adams first announced
that he planned to spirit the Oilers out of Houston. But what was
roundly tsk-tsked as a rich fool's threat turned into a hastily
fabricated reality.
</P>
<P>
   Memphis, indignant that it was viewed as only a temporary home,
gave the Oilers a hunka-hunka chilling shoulder. In one game at the
Liberty Bowl, only an alleged 17,071 showed up.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we settled there, it was like Tennessee was going to be
the land of milk and honey,'' guard Bruce Matthews, 38 and in his
17th NFL season, said. ``But as we learned, those first couple of
years were pretty lean.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeff sold you on the hope that things would get better. The
guy doesn't say much. But when he does say something, he means
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Fisher, the Titans have built a big-play defense bent on
pressuring the quarterback. On offense, Fisher summed up the
philosophy as ``Run the football, throw high-percentage passes and
have a quarterback who's mobile.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys critics, take note: ``Dare'' McNair had only four
200-yard passing games all season and none in the playoffs. Yet,
he's headed for the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy's a winner,'' Matthews said. ``He shows you that
football games don't always have to be won by the guy who throws
the prettiest spiral.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if he's the most unconventional quarterback I've
ever seen, but he's the most unconventional I've played with. No,
wait _ Bucky Richardson was pretty unconventional.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthews smiled at the memory. After 17 seasons, after the Ed
Biles years, the Jerry Glanville years and the ] Buddy
Ryan-as-angry-coordinator years, after Richardson and Warren Moon,
after lockers in four different home stadiums in four seasons,
Matthews was smiling a lot yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   One of the NFL's eternal axioms has been that no team can beat
another three times in a single season. The Titans debunked that in
the Jaguars' own back yard. The blemishes on Jacksonville's 15-3
season came at the hands of Tennessee, twice at Alltel Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The four years of wanderings, from Memphis to Opry-ville, from
one practice field to another, schooled the Titans well, the
players said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what defines our team,'' Matthews, the 17-year veteran,
said. ``Those four years are what we're all about.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gone through a lot of stuff. My brother was talking the
other day and said, `You know, you guys are battle-hardened,' and
we are. We haven't experienced any luxuries until this year.''
</P>
<P>
   With 75,206 screaming in their ears, McNair and the Titans
seldom seemed ruffled. McNair tried to force a big play to George
early in the second quarter and was intercepted. But the Tennessee
defense responded, and safety Marcus Robertson made a diving
interception of a Mark Brunell pass in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   The second half was dominated by the vagabond visitors. Lining
up Jevon Kearse opposite his usual left side for one snap, the
Titans smothered Brunell for a safety in the third period. When
Derrick Mason ran the ensuing free kick back 80 yards for a
touchdown, Tennessee had a 12-point lead and the ``Music City
Miracle,'' the kickoff-lateral that saved the day against Buffalo
two weeks ago, became just a footnote.
</P>
<P>
   There are fans in Houston who will never forgive Adams _ or the
new ``Oilers'' _ for this. The Astrodome is empty. The ``Luv Ya
Blue'' signs are long gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope they can enjoy what we've done,'' Matthews said. ``I
still live in Houston in the off-season, and I know there are a lot
of fans there that still pull for this team. I'm happy for them
today.''
</P>
<P>
   After 17 seasons, Matthews is headed to the Super Bowl. After 40
years, owner Bud Adams, one of the AFL's founding fathers, has
finally seen his team answer destiny's knock.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Bum promised.

MAVS' WIN, REACH NELSON MILESTONE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN HILLS, Mich. _ Don Nelson finally got the keys to the
prestigious 900 club.
</P>
<P>
   After being denied entry into the exclusive club Saturday by an
emotional loss to the New Jersey Nets, Nelson was able to post his
900th-career victory last night with a 99-91 triumph over the
Detroit Pistons. He joins Lenny Wilkens (1,165), Pat Riley (973),
Bill Fitch (944), Red Auerbach (938) and Dick Motta (935) as the
only coaches to win at least 900 games.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks overcame an eight-point deficit in the fourth
quarter, and now start a five-game homestand tomorrow against the
Golden State Warriors. But Nelson and company werestill savoring
last night's victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my 900th win and I don't mean to underplay that,'' said
Nelson, the coach and general manager of the Mavericks. ``But it
was won the way it should have been won.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a hard-fought game; I'm all sweaty. There were a lot of
decisions that went in the game and a lot of different strategies.
I guess if I'm going to remember that one, that's what I'm going to
remember.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson will also remember seven key points guard Greg Buckner
scored in the fourth quarter. Buckner, a defensive specialist,
isn't normally an offensive threat. But the rookie from Clemson
found himself wide open a couple of times, and buried critical
jumpers that helped the Mavericks go home with a 14-26 record.
Buckner wound up 3-of-4 from the field and finished with eight
points and six rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael Finley told me that I have to shoot to get the respect
of the guys in this league,'' said Buckner, who came in averaging
2.9 points and shooting 38.5 percent from the field. ``Tonight I
had to make the shots because they were leaving me open.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teams double off me because I don't shoot that much, and I'm a
rookie.''
</P>
<P>
   The hard-fought victory eased some of the pain from Saturday's
loss to the Nets, which prevented the Mavericks from going 3-0 on
the road trip. In the game against the Nets, the Mavericks blew a
five-point lead with less than four minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were hurting from that Jersey game emotionally,'' said
Cedric Ceballos, who had22 points and 10 rebounds last night. ``I
hadn't seen that locker room that quiet in awhile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the bus ride \Rafter the Nets game\S, the plane ride, the
bus ride today was quite, even the locker room today was quiet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great thing about back-to-back games, when you have a bad
loss you can always come back and shake it and get a win. But we
should have had a sweep on this trip.''
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 80-72 early in the fourth quarter, the Mavericks clawed
their way back and eventually took an 88-87 lead on a 19-foot
jumper by Buckner. Another basket by Buckner pushed the Mavericks
ahead for good _ 90-89 with 2:27 left.
</P>
<P>
   After a bucket by Ceballos, Bucnker drained a 17-footer to give
the Mavericks a comfortable 94-89 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't blame them for leaving him, because he's not known to
be a shooter,'' Nelson said. ``He's known to be a defender.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we saw him make shots in the summer league, and I think
it's a confidence thing. He's got the heart of a lion.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant Hill of the Pistons did not play because of a bruised hip,
and Jerry Stackhouse led the Pistons with 33 points.
</P>
<P>
   Other Mavericks who made strong contributions includes Erick
Strickland (16 points, six assists), Shawn Bradley (14 points,
eight rebounds), and Finley (18 points, 10 rebounds, six assists).
But the night clearly belonged to Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love winning,'' Ceballos said. ``It's much better than
losing.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The abundance of dot.com commercials on this
year's Super Bowl telecast might bring ABC generous advertising
dollars, but it could also have a backlash _ first, enticing
viewers to leave the TV to check out a Web site, and also jamming
Internet use that could affect access to the network's Enhanced TV
content.
</P>
<P>
   There are 250,000 spots available for Enhanced TV, which offers
additional game stats through a data base in the TV production
truck, interactive polls and games in which you guess play calls
against others across the country. It will be accessible through
ESPN.com, NFL.com and Superbowl.com, as well as Disney's GO.com
site.
</P>
<P>
   Enhanced TV executive producer Jonathan Leess says the
technology has been ``tremendously successful'' when used during
ABC's ``Monday Night Football'' and ESPN's Sunday night package, 39
telecasts in all since September, but ``we don't know the kind of
Internet use there will be on a Super Bowl Sunday ... that's the
fear I have right now.''
</P>
<P>
   ETV research shows a typical user stays logged into the service
for an average of 37 minutes. More than 2.2 million have tried the
service since September's regular-season launch.
</P>
<P>
   __Magic Johnson plans to launch an African- American-geared
portal for entertainment, retail and community known as
UrbanMagic.com sometime in April, according to a special report on
minority sites in a recent issue of The Industry Standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was heavily recruited by other black portals, but I wanted
to do my own thing,'' Johnson told the magazine. ``We'll make some
money, but we'll also do some good.''

RAMS' TRIP TO SUPER BOWL LEAVES BAD AFTERTASTE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I have to admit I'm surprised.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't think I would feel so resentful if the St. Louis Rams
made it to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   I never flinched once during this fairy tale of a season for the
ex-L.A. Rams. I shared the same sense of wonderment as everyone
else watching the worst NFL franchise of the '90s find a truffle
and a quarterback out of a Disney story go from mini-football to
NFL MVP.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no bile or anger, at least not until Sunday, when
all of the negative emotions arrived at the same time like the
onset of food poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   I metaphorically felt like John Hurt in that scene from
``Alien'' when the bug pops out of his chest, except the acrid
monster emerging from my soul has had several face lifts.
</P>
<P>
   I should have expected this. Before Sunday's NFC title game
against Tampa Bay began, Lawrence McCutcheon was introduced as an
honorary captain and the crowd responded with a murmur. It was
foreshadowing, and Tampa Bay only made the sense of dread worse by
bitterly hanging on until the very end.
</P>
<P>
   Each visual thereafter left a deep gash. Sideline camera pans on
cheering Melonheads, hearty fans no doubt, but they never saw
Deacon Jones and Merlin Olsen converge on a quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs camera finds Georgia Frontiere on the sidelines, the
woman whose husband perished with a poorly-written will, the owner
of the team who never saw Jon Arnett or Dick Bass run the football,
much less knows who they are.
</P>
<P>
   Long-range Fox camera pans on Rams celebration, which happens to
be accompanied by the stadium PA playing Ray Charles' ``Georgia.''
The stomach knots.
</P>
<P>
   Camera goes close-up on the former dinner theatre queen as she
accepts a trophy and, momentarily, appears to start singing. This
is for the coach, she warbles. That would be the coach she almost
fired a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Proehl has a microphone in his face, and while I wonder
why his not-altogether-secure catch of the game-winning touchdown
counted and Bert Emanuel's two-hand catch on the game's climactic
play didn't, he says ``St. Louis fans are the best.''
</P>
<P>
   At which time I just lose it.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from a few part-time politicians who didn't anticipate the
resolve of Carroll Rosenbloom to leave the Coliseum or the
shrewdness of John Shaw negotiating a buyout of his Anaheim Stadium
lease, no one in Los Angeles or Anaheim did anything to cause the
Rams to leave town.
</P>
<P>
   Long before there were Dodger fans, there were Ram fans, and
they treated the team well for 49 years. The Rams were treated a
lot better than a franchise with one NFL title (in 1951) and one
Super Bowl appearance probably deserved.
</P>
<P>
   In 1949, 86,080 watched the Rams beat George Halas' Bears. There
were crowds of 85,865 and 93,751 in 1953, five crowds between
68,690 and 90,535 in 1955, and three crowds of more than 100,000 in
1957 and 1958.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams were supported during the dismal '60s before George
Allen's arrival, and faithfully in the '70s despite heart-wrenching
playoff losses. The 1974 Rams averaged 76,456 fans a game. A crowd
of 62,538 sat through torrential rain to see the Rams lose a 1977
playoff game to Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams drew well in Anaheim, too, at least until ownership
punted the concept of winning. In their first 12 years in Anaheim
(1980-91), which included two fan-unfriendly strike seasons, the
Rams played before crowds of 60,000 or more 35 times.
</P>
<P>
   Let's put it this way: There are more Los Angeles Rams in the
Pro Football Hall of Fame than there are L.A. Dodgers in baseball's
shrine. From the recently passed Tom Fears to Eric Dickerson, and
including one Pete Rozelle, the one-time Rams publicist and G.M.
and NFL commissioner, who I have to believe might have stopped the
Rams from moving if he had still been commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, any resentment over the Rams here is no greater than
the bitterness Brooklyn Dodgers fans and Oakland Raider fans felt
when their teams left home for Los Angeles. As a kid, I luxuriated
in the joy of the Dodgers' 1959 World Series, and as an adult, I've
advised any New Yorker still feeling any pain to get over it.
</P>
<P>
   So this is karma.
</P>
<P>
   My question is, when is karma going to visit Georgia?
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Frontiere had the good fortune to meet and wed Carroll
Rosenbloom, and for her husband's will to leave the franchise in
her hands instead of those of his son, Steve.
</P>
<P>
   She inherited the team just as it was not only making the
financially rich leap to Anaheim but finding its way into its first
Super Bowl. When a subsequent ticket controversy emerged from that
Super Bowl, new husband Dominic took the fall.
</P>
<P>
   When the city of Anaheim decided to build the Pond, they had to
go through Georgia's consigliere, Shaw, who negotiated buyout
language, having realized before most that a team's greatest
resource is the flexibility of its lease.
</P>
<P>
   When St. Louis officials fumbled a chance at an expansion team,
they began looking at other teams, and there was Georgia, who
always has an eye out for new suitors.
</P>
<P>
   And now she gets an all-expenses-paid trip to the Super Bowl,
not on merit but via total serendipity.
</P>
<P>
   Because the players hated Vermeil last year, and he only
returned because management didn't want to pay off his contract.
Because trading for Marshall Faulk was financially cheaper than
signing a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Because they didn't know what they had in Kurt Warner, who
Cleveland passed over in the expansion draft. Because the new
offensive coordinator was fired by Washington. Because the NFL
legislates parity, and the Rams caught Dallas, Green Bay and San
Francisco all descending at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure this resentment will pass soon enough. Life moves much
too quickly these days to gnaw on the same bone, a la Brooklynites.
And I'm truly happy for Vermeil, scout McCutcheon, publicist Rick
Smith, Todd Lyght, Marshall Faulk and even Shaw, a likeable fellow
once you get past his employer.
</P>
<P>
   Give me a week and one more win for Jeff Fisher's Titans, and
I'm sure I'll be fine.

   LOS ANGELES _ Quiz: The 20-minute Super Bowl halftime show
provides ample time to a) run outside to toss around the football
before the second half starts, b) run to the bathroom, c) just run
away from the TV screen.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are some who actually look forward to non-football
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   To please this attention-deficit demo, this year's
Disney-produced halftime show in Atlanta pulls together Toni
Braxton, Phil Collins, Christina Aguilera and Enrique Iglesias,
along with 125 drummers and percussionists, a full 80-person
symphony orchestra and a choir.
</P>
<P>
   All singing the soundtrack of ``Toy Story 2,'' no doubt.
</P>
<P>
   For old-time's sake, here's a look at the de-evolution of the
Super Bowl not-so-spectacular:
</P>
<P>
   Super Bowl I: The University of Arizona and Michigan bands
played at the Coliseum. Ooooh, pinch me.
</P>
<P>
   Super Bowl X: The bicentennial marked the first of four
sugar-coated ``Up With People'' presentations during a 10-year
period. Teeth-capping costs made this show too prohibitive after
SBXX.
</P>
<P>
   Super Bowl XI: A Disney-produced show with the theme ``It's a
Small World.'' It's also a small budget: The L.A. Unified All-City
Band was the star attraction.
</P>
<P>
   Super Bowl XXI: A Disney-produced ``Salute to Hollywood's 100th
Anniversary'' wasn't much flashier, using a compilation of
L.A.-area high school drill teams and dancers. Now !ital!that's
Hollywood entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Super Bowl XXVII: Michael Jackson at the Rose Bowl. C'mon
everyone, grab your crotch.
</P>
<P>
   Super Bowl XXXIII: You don't remember last year's ``Soul, Salsa
and Swing'' show with Stevie Wonder, Gloria Estefan and the Big Bad
Voodoo Daddy?
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry. No one else does either.

Miami was suckered in. The Rockets came out clanging, and the Heat
fell for it.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Miami went merrily along Sunday night with the game plan that
seemed to be working, having no idea what was about to hit it. Then
the Rockets bombed the Heat into a 101-88 collapse at Compaq Center
that was not that close.
</P>
<P>
   After making one of their first 11 3-pointers, the Rockets
ripped 12 of their next 13, turning Matt Bullard into a
point-a-minute machine and one of the league's most tenacious gangs
of defenders into a sieve.
</P>

   Just 17 days after they were routed in Miami, the Rockets rolled
to a 20-point fourth-quarter lead. They extended their winning
streak to six, the longest current roll in the NBA. And they almost
_ not quite, but almost _ made their horrible start to the season
look like a setup itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is so much talent on this team,'' Rockets center Hakeem
Olajuwon said. ``It was just a matter of time. This team has a lot
of weapons. We do not just beat you one way. That's very unusual.
The record (16-24) is deceiving. Teams come in and know it will be
a tough game.''
</P>
<P>
   The game was the Rockets' first of the winning streak in which
no one claimed a personal career best. But Bullard had a
season-high 24 points, making nine of 16 shots and six of 10
3-pointers. It was the most points he had scored in his eight
Rockets seasons. His career best of 28 came with the Hawks in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Guard Shandon Anderson had 12 rebounds, one shy of the career
best he established Thursday. And the Rockets had their most
prolific 3-point shooting game of the season, sinking 15 of 31
treys, the most 3s made in the NBA this season and an
accomplishment made more remarkable by their 1-of-11 start. Cuttino
Mobley had 18 points in 25 minutes off the bench, nailing four of
six 3s.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the first quarter, it was 22-16 and we were
ahead,'' Heat coach Pat Riley said. ``It was really fool's gold.
They had every shot they wanted. They just missed them. It was just
a matter of time before they started hitting them. We did not play
hard, and they played great, absolutely great.''
</P>
<P>
   They played well enough to earn what Rockets coach Rudy
Tomjanovich called the ``most satisfying victory of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets had played Portland tough previously before
recording a breakthrough win Tuesday. But they trailed by as much
as 27 against the Heat in Miami on Jan. 6 and had lost eight
straight games against the Heat.
</P>
<P>
   And since beating the Knicks in Game 7 of the 1994 NBA Finals,
the Rockets had lost 10 in a row to Riley-coached teams. They also
had lost 17 consecutive games to Florida teams since taking the
1995 title with a sweep of Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can win,'' Rockets guard Steve Francis said. ``All we have
to do is keep playing hard, and the sky's the limit for this team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We proved we can play with the best in the East and the best
in the West.''
</P>
<P>
   Francis, averaging 25 points, 10.2 assists and 5.8 rebounds in
the first five games of the Rockets' streak, was limited to 10
points, nine assists and four rebounds. But in many ways, he keyed
the Rockets' offensive onslaught.
</P>
<P>
   Miami was so determined to prevent a Francis attack that Riley
ran a second defender at him throughout the game, trying to force
Francis to go to his left and give up the ball. Though the Rockets
expected it, Francis was given treatment the Heat normally does not
give even to Allen Iverson, Stephon Marbury or Gary Payton.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the plan was to help Tim Hardaway defensively. Hardaway
played in just his second game since missing 26 with a jammed knee.
But the Heat also dared the Rockets' shooters to beat them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach told me before the game, `They're going to come out and
double-team, so don't try to force it. Just look for the open guy.
Take advantage of it, and try to pick it apart,''' Francis said.
``I think we did a great job of finding the open man and finishing.
Those guys, every time I turned around they were throwing a
3-pointer in.''
</P>
<P>
   After years of failing to get Riley to double-team Olajuwon or
Charles Barkley, Tomjanovich said he expected Miami to try to get
the ball out of Francis' hands and had his shooters ready to burn
the Heat for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always been a team that tries to get players that are
good enough that people have to do something to get the ball out of
their hands,'' Tomjanovich said. ``But usually playing Miami, even
if we had big players, they don't double-team in the post. So we've
got these good shooters, and usually against these guys we never
get our shooters into their game because (Miami) is going
one-on-one.
</P>
<P>
   ``But because we do have a penetrator now, they did double
there. We made 15 3-pointers. We worked on some of the things we
thought they were going to do, and sure enough they did, and our
guys were ready for it. I can't tell you how well these guys
executed the swinging of the ball on the double teams out on the
wing. I just feel real good about our guys taking the game plan and
executing it.''
</P>
<P>
   But then, there is a lot to feel good about these days, to the
point that even the oddest explanations seem plausible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it was,'' Kenny Thomas said of the Rockets'
hot shooting. ``Maybe we had some chili somewhere we shouldn't have
it.''
</P>

``What kind of surrealistic nonsense is this?'' asks Howard Cosell
as Anita Bryant, Huey Lewis and the News and Boyz II Men team up to
sing the National Anthem in the first Millennium Bowl. Surreal is
right. Nonsense? NFL Films doesn't think so. Steve Sabol's knack of
editing archival NFL clips with computer-generated ``Forrest
Gump''-like special effects has resulted in a fascinating piece of
fantasy. Watch Ronnie Lott cover Lynn Swann and Joe Montana avoid
Jack Lambert as the Pittsburgh Steelers of the 1970s battle the San
Francisco 49ers of the 1980s in a two-part mythical ``Matchup of
the Millennium.'' The first half is ``played'' at Candlestick (or
3Com, if you want to get technical), with the second half at Three
Rivers. And, yes, Cosell is there, interviewing Richard Nixon.
``Millennium Bowl'' first half, ESPN2, 4:30 p.m. (repeats on ESPN
Friday at 5:30 p.m.) ESPN2 has the second half Monday, Jan. 31, at
5 p.m. 
TUESDAY 
The Lakers have the night off. Catch Harvard-Westlake's Russell
Lakey instead. Prep basketball: Harvard-Westlake at Crespi, Fox
Sports Net 2, 7 p.m. (replays Wednesday at 1 p.m.) 
WEDNESDAY 
Arizona tries to pull itself together. Arizona State isn't a great
place to start. College basketball: Arizona at Arizona State, Fox
Sports Net, 7 p.m. 
THURSDAY

Memo to NBC when it comes to the 2000 Summer Olympics: You see,
they can show live sporting events from Down Under. Australian
Open: Women's final, ESPN, 6:30 p.m. (ESPN has the men's final
Saturday at 7 p.m.) 
SATURDAY 
Mike Tyson's trip to England the past few weeks has been quite
educational. ``Everybody in America is so money hungry,'' he told
reporters as he dodged women's rights protesters who can't believe
the government allowed the convicted rapist into the country so he
can rejuvenate Manchester's economy. ``It's like a rat race,'' he
continued, ``and even when you win, you are still a freaking rat.''
By the way, have you seen the size of the rats in England? Boxing:
Mike Tyson vs. Julius Francis, Showtime, 8 p.m.

In an event so conducive to X's and I's and V's, how is it Roman

CLIPPERS LOSE TO MAGIC

 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ At least we know where they've been hiding ``The
Gong Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Too bad nobody could find the mallet.
</P>
<P>
   So without a weapon required to gong them off the Staples Center
floor, the Clippers were allowed to finish Sunday's routine. With
weeks of rehearsal kicking in, they shifted their transition game
into high gear, smoothly going from bad to worse.
</P>
<P>
   Conquering the squad representing Loss Angeles was the Orlando
Magic, a cast of glorified stunt doubles that had lost 13 of its
last 15 games. But Orlando (18-24) now claims two road victories in
as many nights, including a 102-89 victory over the Clips (10-30)
before a studio audience of 10,312.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers, who continue performing like a team of density,
now have eight consecutive defeats, 12 in their last 13 games.
</P>
<P>
   Some numbers: Clips forward Maurice Taylor scored 19 points and
had a dozen rebounds. Derek Anderson had 20 points, center Michael
Olowokandi had 13 rebounds and 12 points, with Lamar Odom
contributing 18 points and 3 momentum-killing first-half fouls.
</P>
<P>
   And now the defining numbers: The Clippers committed 18
turnovers that were converted in 24 Orlando points.
</P>
<P>
   Darrell Armstrong had 17 points and Tariq Abdul-Wahad added 15
points to lead the Magic, who _ in concert with the Clippers _
defined the difference between scrappy and scrap.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Sunday's center matchup suggests that one of the most
underrated hoop hotbeds on the planet is England. OK, that's a
ridiculous notion, but the Magic and Clippers do start pivot men
who grew up in the UK. Orlando center John Amaechi (Penn State) was
born in Ohio, but was raised in Manchester, England. Clips center
Michael Olowokandi (Pacific) was born in Nigeria and raised in
London. And while, Olowokandi _ the first pick in the 1998 NBA
Draft _ has greater name recognition in the United States, he
admits Amaechi is the man in England. ``The name John Amaechi is
synonymous with British basketball,'' said Olowokandi, who doesn't
know the 29-year-old Amaechi personally. ``All the basketball
publications over there have him on the cover.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   The silver lining in last week's losses to Sacramento and
Minnesota was the mini-renaissance of veteran point guard Eric
Murdock. The first-year Clipper, whose participation this season
has been compromised by a bum knee, scored 11 points and had 5
steals while having his way with Sacramento hotshot Jason Williams.
Against the Timberwolves, he came off he bench for a dozen points
and 4 assists. ``I've felt good the last week or so,'' said the
31-year-old Murdock, who realizes the team struggles without his
graybeard savvy. ``I'm going to be active on defense, I'm going get
some steals,'' Murdock, who led the NCAA in steals while at
Providence College, said. ``I'm going to hit shots and be
aggressive going to the hole. I'm trying to create shots for my
teammates, not myself.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   It was definite that backup center Keith Closs was indefinitely
suspended after missing Saturday's practice, but Coach Chris Ford,
who spoke with Closs by phone Sunday, didn't expect him to be at
Staples Center for the Orlando game. Ford said he and Closs would
meet this morning before the team leaves for San Antonio.

ST. LOUIS _ Tampa Bay was right: Defense does win championships.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But it won't be the Buccaneers' NFC-leading defensive unit
heading to the Super Bowl to play the Tennessee Titans. Instead, it
will be St. Louis' after the Rams scratched out an 11-6 victory in
the NFC Championship Game on Sunday before 66,496 at the Trans
World Dome.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams (15-3), who moved from Los Angeles in 1995 and will be
making their first Super Bowl trip in 20 years, made big play after
big play on defense, limiting the Bucs (12-6) to a pair of field
goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``All week, all we heard about was Tampa's defense,'' Rams
defensive tackle D'Marco Farr said. ``We didn't say anything, not
to the coaches, not to the other players, but it got to us. It was
like, `Hey, we can play, too. If we get into a slugfest, we're not
going to bend.'''
</P>
<P>
   They were definitely in a battle.
</P>
<P>
   Rams quarterback Kurt Warner, who threw five touchdown passes
Jan. 16 to beat Minnesota, struggled at times Sunday. Warner was
26-of-43 for 258 yards with three interceptions, only one of which
was converted into points. He was picked off by Steve White at the
St. Louis 20 on the opening play of the game. The Rams then held
the Bucs to 13 yards on six plays, and Martin Gramatica kicked a
25-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   The other two interceptions netted Tampa Bay nothing but
frustration, with one drive stalling after five plays and the other
after three.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I was in an Oliver Stone movie,'' Farr said. ``It
was 11-6. There were noses bloodied at the end of the game. You
just can't write a better script than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that St. Louis would have minded scoring a few more points
and winning in a less dramatic manner. But the Rams found
themselves trailing 6-5 when they got the ball with 8:01 to play.
They had managed only one drive of more than six plays in the
second half and only three all afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Their drive began at the Tampa Bay 47, and the Rams moved to a
third-and-four at the Bucs' 30. The plan was for a short pass
outside to Marshall Faulk, but the Buccaneers blitzed and Warner
found Ricky Proehl in man-to-man coverage against Brian Kelly.
Proehl, who caught six passes for 100 yards Sunday, made a leaping
catch in the end zone, fighting off Kelly for his first touchdown
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams failed on a two-point conversion pass, but they had an
11-6 edge with 4:44 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came down, his (Kelly's) hand was in there, but I
pinned it against my hip and kept my body between the defender and
the ball,'' Proehl said.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay threatened on its final drive, with a questionable
call helping to end its season. The Bucs drove to a first down at
the St. Louis 22 with 1:25 to play, but rookie quarterback Shaun
King (13-for-19 for 163 yards, two interceptions) was sacked at the
35 by Grant Wistrom. King then connected with former Rice standout
Bert Emanuel on an 11-yard pass, but the catch was ruled an
incompletion after a video review, leaving the Bucs with
third-and-23 and 47 seconds to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was apparent that the player (Emanuel), as he was catching
the ball, he used the ground and the tip of the ball hit the
ground,'' referee Bill Carollo told a pool reporter after the game.
``It was one continuous motion. He wasn't down by contact.''
</P>
<P>
   King then threw two more incomplete passes, including a Hail
Mary that was batted down in the end zone, and the Rams were headed
to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay kept St. Louis' No. 1-ranked offense out of the end
zone for most of the day. The Rams scored on a first-quarter field
goal _ a 24-yarder by Jeff Wilkins _ that tied the game at 3 with
4:17 remaining in the period.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis then added a safety only seconds into the second
period after the snap from Bucs center Tony Mayberry flew over
King's head and into the end zone. King kicked it out of the back
of the end zone and took the safety, giving the Rams a 5-3 lead,
which they took into halftime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought our guys played well, tackled well, and we did what
we thought we could do,'' Tampa Bay coach Tony Dungy said. ``We
just gave up one big play (the touchdown to Proehl) at the wrong
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially considering that the 14-point underdog Bucs took the
lead on their first drive of the second half. King led his team on
a nine-play, 66-yard drive, highlighted by a third-and-eight pass
to Jacquez Green for 32 yards. A facemask penalty on the play gave
the Bucs the ball at the St. Louis 12. They eventually reached the
five but could get no closer, and Gramatica kicked a 23-yard field
goal for a 6-5 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very tough feeling, difficult to be that close to a
Super Bowl and not get it done,'' Dungy said.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay's stifling defense blanketed the Rams' deep-threat
receivers and surrendered only short gainers underneath the
coverage until Proehl finally broke free for the decisive score.
</P>
<P>
   ``They trapped us into their type game a little bit,'' St. Louis
coach Dick Vermeil said. ``We don't see the slanting, stunting
scheme with quick people like they have very often.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rams' offense, which averaged slightly more than 400 yards
per game this season, was limited to 309. Faulk, the league's
Offensive Player of the Year, carried 17 times for 44 yards. Isaac
Bruce caught only three passes for 22 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough battle,'' Bruce said. ``We had to fight for
everything we got. They didn't give us anything out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rams will face the Tennessee Titans on Sunday in Super Bowl
XXXIV. Tennessee handed St. Louis one of its three losses this
season, beating the Rams 24-21 at Nashville, Tenn., on Oct. 31.

SERENA WILLIAMS UPSET 
</HEADLINE>
 OPEN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MELBOURNE _ Serena Williams waved with a smile to the throng
jamming Court 1 Sunday &UR;  &LR; night _ only it was a farewell salute at
the Australian Open, and came unexpectedly soon, leaving her
faithful stony-faced.
</P>
<P>
   Gone in the fourth round was the 18-year-old US Open champion,
beaten by a Russian slight in physique and world ranking, No. 18
Elena Likhovtseva, 6-3, 6-3. Williams had won both their previous
engagements.
</P>
<P>
   Extremely under-prepared for this, her eighth major
championship, Williams hadn't played a match since an early October
defeat by Sandrine Testud at Filderstadt, Germany, that snipped a
10-match streak.
</P>
<P>
   She had been hampered by a back strain that kept her out of the
season-ending Chase Championships. And she was also affected, she
said, ``by going to school,'' attending the Art Institute of
Florida in Miami after completing high school.
</P>
<P>
   Her three early victories were clearly a struggle, her timing
off as she piled up errors in beating three lesser players, Nos.
261 and 58 Aussies Amanda Grahame and Nicole Pratt, and No. 31
Sabine Appelmans of Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   ``No excuses. I didn't make my shots; she made hers,'' said
Williams, who had opened fast to a 3-1 lead, then was avalanched by
Likhovtseva's eight-game burst to 3-0 in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Williams caught up to 3-3 and faded once more, succumbing on a
third match point with a familiar stroke _ a backhand into the net.
</P>
<P>
   Australia had anticipated a two-pronged assault on its
championship by the Sisters Sledgehammer, Venus and Serena (ranked
3-4 on the planet).
</P>
<P>
   But Venus was a no-show, asking to be excused because of
tendinitis in her right wrist. Their father/coach, Richard
Williams, sometimes has pursued a strategy of keeping them apart,
entering them in separate tournaments, although they did meet in
the Lipton final last spring at Miami with Venus the victor.
</P>
<P>
   With Venus absent, Serena took her third seed, behind Martina
Hingis and Lindsay Davenport, her victims in the final and
semifinal of the US Open. Despite her shaky performances here,
Serena believed she would play herself into the proper rhythm, and
appeared ready to face Conchita Martinez in the quarters and Hingis
in the semis _ if Likhovtseva hadn't intruded.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't take any of these players for granted,'' Serena said
accurately, a bit disconsolately, after the 74-minute defeat in
which she presented Likhovtseva with half of her 69 points: 32
unforced errors, mostly on backhands that couldn't get over the
net.
</P>
<P>
   Likhovtseva, who seemed puny across the net from Williams, grew
up in Alma Ata, Kazakstan, the granddaughter of a man whose family
had been exiled from Moscow because he had made some sort of unwise
political statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what he said, and he wasn't sure himself what had
got him in trouble,'' said the 24-year-old, who deported Williams
back to Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., because she kept the ball in
court more often.
</P>
<P>
   Her groundies were more reliable than Williams's. She kept her
forehand along the line to Williams's wayward two-fisted backhand,
earning her first quarterfinal slot in 25 major championship
appearances. Her best had been the fourth round here in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to go home and practice with my dad. I got to 3-1,
and I guess I started looking too far ahead,'' Williams said. It
seemed she might recover as she fought off three set points at 3-5,
a six-deuce game, but Likhovtseva broke her anyway with a pair of
screaming forehands.
</P>
<P>
   Impassive throughout, Oracene Williams offered a quizzical Mona
Lisa smile as her youngest daughter banged a last misdirected
backhand.
</P>
<P>
   Serena, woefully lacking in recent tournament experience,
insisted she was ready enough to handle anybody here. But mama's
smile seemed to indicate otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   No. 10 Martinez reached the quarters via a 6-1, 6-1 victory over
American Kristina Brandi. No. 13 Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario got there
by beating No. 6 Barbara Schett, 1-6, 6-0, 7-5.
</P>
<P>
   In fourth-round singles, Ai Sugiyama defeated fourth seed Mary
Pierce, 7-5, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   On the men's side, No. 4 Nicolas Kiefer of Germany beat South
Africa's Wayne Ferreira, 6-3, 6-4, 6-2, to reach the quarterfinals,
joining No. 1 Andre Agassi and No. 3 Pete Sampras, who got there a
day earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras defeated Slava Dosedel, 6-1, 6-2, 3-6, 6-1, in
fourth-round singles.
</P>
<P>
   Australian teenager Lleyton Hewitt's 13-match winning streak
ended with a 6-3, 6-1, 7-6 (6) loss to No. 12 Magnus Norman.

 OVERFISHING IS PUTTING THE DUNGENESS CRAB IN A TIGHT SPOT  &HT;     By GLEN MARTIN 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Dungeness crabs may not be lovely, but they are
by no means unloved. These big, brown crustaceans are as much a
symbol of San Francisco as cable cars and the Golden Gate, a
gastronomic emblem as enduring for Northern California as lobsters
for Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Unhappily, their populations may not be as enduring as their
image.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial Dungeness landings at San Francisco have recovered
modestly from their nadir during the early 1970s, thanks to
steadily tightening regulations. Now, only males may be
commercially taken, and their carapaces must measure at least 61/4
inches across.
</P>
<P>
   But today's annual catches of 2 million to 3 million pounds
still don't approach the glory years of the 1950s, when crab boats
hauled 9 million pounds one year from the waters off the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Several factors may be at work, including long-term ocean
temperature cycles and loss of habitat. But many fishermen, at
least, think overfishing is still a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Collins, a San Francisco fisherman who has crabbed for 13
years, said things started getting particularly bad about four
years ago when tough quotas were put on groundfish, such as rock
fish. Last week, the U.S. Department of Commerce declared a federal
disaster for West Coast groundfish.
</P>
<P>
   ``After groundfish tanked,'' Collins said, the large groundfish
trawlers rigged for crab. ``You're talking 125-foot boats that are
setting out one to two thousand pots. They can fish all day and
night in any weather. Little guys like me running 50-foot boats and
200 pots can't compete. And the crabs can't handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins said new recreational fisheries also are hurting Bay
Area Dungeness.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few years ago, the party boats started setting out crab pots
and then hauling them up after everyone got their limit of
rockfish,'' he said. ``They're taking crates and crates of crabs
out there now, including females and small ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Hankin, a professor of fisheries at Humboldt State
University who has studied Dungeness for 20 years, said he is also
concerned about overfishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dungeness have risen in commercial importance as other
California coastal fisheries have fallen apart,'' Hankin said. ``We
need to make sure they aren't overexploited. People always
underestimate the impact recreational fisheries have on local
stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Human appetites aren't the only problem facing Dungeness. Their
numbers also fluctuate in response to habitat conditions. Because
Dungeness like estuaries, most scientists agree that local
populations are highly dependent on the biological integrity of San
Francisco Bay. State researchers estimate 85 percent of the
Dungeness caught in the Gulf of the Farallones cq &LR;  are reared in
the bay.
</P>
<P>
   Dungeness begin life as minute, free-swimming larvae that form
part of the vast shoals of zooplankton that periodically bloom in
coastal waters. Eventually, they ``settle out,'' transforming into
bottom-dwelling crustaceans. Through a series of molts, they
ultimately reach edible size within three to six years.
</P>
<P>
   State studies have demonstrated that crabs lucky enough to
settle out in San Francisco Bay grow about twice as fast as crabs
that settle out in the open waters of the Gulf of the Farallones.
</P>
<P>
   Once they go through a few molts, bay-reared Dungeness migrate
to the open sea to mature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Estuarine marshes are far richer than the open sea in the
particulate food young crabs need,'' said William Kier, a
Sausalito-based fisheries consultant. ``The marshes also provide
abundant shelter. Part of the problem facing the crabs is that
we've lost so much salt marsh in the Napa-Suisun area, where many
of the young mature.''
</P>
<P>
   Zeke Grader, executive director of the Pacific Coast Federation
of Fishermen's Associations, said Dungeness populations are highest
near areas of freshwater outflows.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a sizable population in the Gulf of the Farallones
near San Francisco Bay; there's one off the Eel River and one off
the Klamath River,'' Grader said. ``It continues like that all the
way up through Canada. That's why we have to do everything possible
to preserve and enhance the biological health of our estuaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Hankin agrees that the density of young Dungeness is
particularly high in estuaries, but he believes the open ocean is
also important nursery habitat. ``It constitutes such a vast area
that it ultimately produces many more crabs than the estuaries,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor can affect Dungeness: water temperature. They
like it cold. That means El Ni &LR; n &LR; o years aren't particularly
healthy for them, observed Kathy Hieb, an associate biologist with
the California Department of Fish and Game who conducts crab and
shrimp surveys in San Francisco Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The warm water is especially hard on the embryos and larvae,''
Hieb said. ``Also, El Ni &LR; n &LR; o usually brings heavy storms. That
means heavy south winds, which set up a near-shore surface current
in this area called the Davidson Current. That can sweep young
crabs out the bay and north of Point Reyes, far enough so they
can't get back.''
</P>
<P>
   Hieb said the rash of major El Ni &LR; n &LR; os during the past decade
probably is negatively affecting Dungeness populations. But that
may be normal in the context of oceanographic history, she added.
</P>
<P>
   ``San Francisco is at the extreme southern end of Dungeness
range, and during El Ni &LR; n &LR; o years, crab larvae production seems to
be significantly curtailed here,'' she said. ``But this doesn't
appear to be exceptional. We have sediment cores that show
fluctuations in sardine and anchovy scale depositions. Sardines
like warm water, anchovies like cold water, and the deposits go
back and forth. This has all happened before.''
</P>
<P>
   Hankin also feels it is important to take a long-range
perspective on temperature fluxes and Dungeness densities.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some compelling evidence to suggest that the warm
water temperature changes (affecting Dungeness) are measured in
decades, not in the months or years that individual El Ni &LR; n &LR; os are
measured,'' he said. ``The argument has been made that we need to
see a major shift to a cold-water regime before Dungeness can
thrive again around San Francisco, and I think there's some merit
to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, scientists from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory said
new satellite images suggest a ``giant horseshoe'' of warm water
may dominate the Pacific Ocean for the next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Hankin isn't necessarily pessimistic. With reasonable
regulations and adequate research funds, he feels Dungeness
populations can be maintained.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am alarmed by the lack of research, however,'' he said.
``It's basically nil at this point. As other fisheries are
depleted, the pressure on Dungeness will inevitably increase.
Typically, management agencies ignore a natural resource until it
collapses, then they look into it. But by then, it's too late.''

CANDIDATES HEAT UP IOWA RACE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  DES MOINES, Iowa _ With Vice President Al Gore and Texas
Governor George W. Bush holding huge leads in voter polls, an army
of presidential hopefuls fanned out across the frigid farms and
hamlets of Iowa as voters prepared to officially raise the curtain
on the 2000 presidential contest tonight.
<P>
   sub graf &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Ten months before the November election, the Iowa vote _ held
in thousands of schools, meeting halls and homes beginning at 7
p.m. tonight (CST) _ will serve to further winnow the field of
presidential hopefuls.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome will provide mo- &LR; ir,5l,6p6  &LR; mentum, or deflate
expectations, for candidates heading into the New Hampshire primary
on February 1 and to the crucial Super Tuesday contests on March 7,
including the California primary.
</P>
<P>
   sub graf &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Bush and Gore enter the caucuses guarding formidable 2-to-1
leads in the latest polls in Iowa, where just 200,000 voters _
about one in 10 _ are expected to come out to the caucuses. Their
choices haven't been a consistent harbinger of the party nominees
on either side, selecting the eventual winner only three times
since 1976. Democrats here in 1992 gave Bill Clinton just 3 percent
of their vote.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the stakes are enormous.
</P>
<P>
   new graf &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  ``Iowa has boosted some people, and it's also eliminated a lot
of folks,'' said Hugh Winebrenner, political historian at Drake
University.
</P>
<P>
   In a final round of furious campaigning, a fired-up Gore urged
supporters at a union meeting in Newton last night not to be
complacent. Challenger Bill Bradley, who has spent more time and
money in Iowa than any Democrat in history, continued to battle
against concerns about his health and the perceptions that he has
lost momentum.
</P>
<P>
   sub graf &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Yesterday, despite a ringing endorsement by the Des Moines
Register, the state's largest newspaper, and a promise to remain
``in this campaign for the duration,'' Bradley all but conceded
tonight's contest, calling Iowa ``a difficult state to penetrate.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a confident Bush, pressed again on the issue of
abortion, said he would support the current anti-abortion plank in
the Republican platform. Yet despite his wide lead, the GOP
front-runner, who has spent 30 days and $1.6 million in TV ads in
Iowa, knows he must meet enormous expectations when tonight's votes
are counted.
</P>
<P>
   Publisher Steve Forbes, hoping for a strong second-place showing
with Arizona Senator John McCain not on the Iowa ballot, aired a
new TV ad attacking Bush and continued to insist that he is the
``true conservative'' in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, who has doubled Bush in both time and money spent in
Iowa, must contain an upstart challenge from conservative Alan
Keyes. Now third in the polls, Keyes' impassioned speeches have
electrified Iowans, often attracting bigger crowds than either Bush
or Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   GOP commentator Gary Bauer also needs a critical boost, and Utah
Senator Orrin Hatch said he must be a strong fourth to continue.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Nonstop Visits
</P>
<P>
   Even with frigid weather putting a chill on last week's
appearances, candidates flew, bused and walked the ice-shrouded
terrain nonstop into the final hours. Iowa, said Bush with a grin,
is a test for candidates and voters alike _ ``a look-see, what we
call a tire-kicker.''
</P>
<P>
   And through it all, their homespun appeals _ some eloquent, some
absurd _ provided glimpses of both the candidates' strengths and
the voters' hearts.
</P>
<P>
   Some standout moments:
</P>
<P>
   _In bone-shattering 5-degree weather, wind-chill 20 below,
Bauer's press conference outside the golden-domed state capital in
Des Moines to address the nation's ``moral crisis.'' Bauer,
battling not to finish last, watched his words freeze in mid-air as
a handful of reporters and camera crews buried in hats and mittens
captured the moment, clearly believing the only real looming crisis
was frostbite.
</P>
<P>
   _Bush, inching his way down the Main Street in Grinnell , Iowa &LR; 
 &LR; (population 9,000), as mobs of cameras and reporters climbed on
cars, elbowed old ladies and trampled other ``real people'' who
came to see the candidate. ``There's more of you people than there
are of us,'' sniped one frustrated Grinnellian to the media hordes.
``You guys are like a bunch of maggots.''
</P>
<P>
   _Bradley, the former basketball and Olympic great, patiently
taking questions about his health from senior citizens. ``I wish
you'd put us at ease,'' said one 66-year-old Muscatine resident to
the New Jersey Democrat, who has suffered bouts of irregular
heartbeats. Bradley announced a bowling outing to show off his
stuff, and his campaign spokesman joked that he would get back on
the court, ``five on one, just to show off.''
</P>
<P>
   _Gore, standing in front of a shiny green and spanking clean &LR; 
 &LR; John Deere tractor parked in a heated barn on the Manz family farm
in Perry and showing he knew just how long he had to keep up the
rigorous campaign pace. ``The fight is going to take place right
here in Iowa 99 hours and 7 minutes from now,'' he told the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Iowans See What Fuss Is About
</P>
<P>
   All this political activity was not taken lightly by the
citizens of Iowa. Bundled up, with kids in tow, they turned out to
see, hear and touch the presidential hopefuls. And they came armed
with tough questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iowans have a culture of being very one-on-one. They see these
candidates and say, `You're equal to me, and I'm equal to you,'''
said Peggy Elliot, an attorney and City Council member in Grinnell.
``It's a very strong community. We like what we have, and we want
to keep it. There's a very strong level of organization.''
</P>
<P>
   There were thoughtful, concerned people like Ruth Harris, a &LR; 
minister in Des Moines, who sat at the back of the city's &LR;  historic
Val Air Ballroom to watch Bradley speak on issues of &LR;  health care.
When he finished, Harris, an independent voter, was &LR;  convinced.
``It's great to see someone who would be a real &LR;  leader, take a
stand and go against the grain,'' she said.  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  And there was Matt Smith, a conservative, churchgoing man who
farms 1,500 acres of corn and soybeans near Marshalltown and who
came to the Best Western Hotel in town to hear Bush at a GOP rally
.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he cares deeply about issues such as abortion and
education and bringing back dignity to the White House. He said he
has considered Forbes, Bauer and Keyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a thousand questions that must be addressed, and you
have to have a man who is right in his heart,'' he said. But in the
end, he said, Bush will get his vote because ``how do you do
anything if you can't get elected? I know he connects with ordinary
people.''
</P>
<P>
   It was those ``ordinary people'' whom candidates - surrounded &LR; 
by consultants, spokespeople and press entourage - worked &LR;  mightily
to reach.  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   That was one reason why hamlets like Grinnell, with its old &LR; 
brick downtown, friendly bakery, and ``come on in coffee shops &LR;  was
swamped with politicians this week.  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Forbes showed up for a chili dinner, his third visit; Keyes &LR; 
stopped by to pump up the conservative vote; Tipper Gore came &LR; 
Saturday to meet with caucus leaders.  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   And Bush, trailed by two packed media busses, descended on the &LR; 
town Friday for a `Main Street walk.'' As he poured coffee for &LR; 
seniors at the Cunningham Drug Store fountain, he urged them to &LR; 
not to pay attention to the polls.  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   `Monday, January 24, 7 p.m.,'' he reminded them, time and &LR; 
again. And while media pundits suggest he's the GOP candidate &LR; 
who's got it made, Bush argued to Iowans, ``the only time when &LR; 
you've got it made..is when people show up at the caucuses.'' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Gore, like Bush, appeared not to take anything for granted,
batting back the suggestion from Bradley that he represents
``entrenched power,'' not the power of change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fighting for people is what the Iowa caucuses are all about,''
yelled Gore at a meeting at Iowa Western Community College.
``Fighting to save the family farm is not entrenched power. That's
about fighting for people!''
</P>
<P>
   But with the political tug-of-war down to the wire on television
and in the field, Iowans such as Mary Dean Rasmussen, 71, suggested
it all may come down to last-minute decisions.
</P>
<P>
   She sat at the counter of Cunningham's Drug Store, under the
``Cappuccino, 39 cents'' sign as Bush himself refilled her coffee
cup. A nice young man and a nice sales pitch, Rasmussen said with a
twinkle in her eye, but she still ``wasn't sure'' if he would get
her support.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all good,'' she said of the candidates. ``If they can
only follow through ... .''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Japanese still in denial over WWII atrocities
 &HT;    (For release Jan. 26, 2000.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I am thumbing through Life magazine's 1950 ``Picture History of
World War II.''
</P>
<P>
   On Page 92 are two shocking photos of a Chinese man being
bayonetted by Japanese soldiers. In the first, a soldier is running
a sword through the victim, who is blindfolded and tied to a post.
In the second photo, another Japanese soldier is running a bayonet
into the chest of the man.
</P>
<P>
   What sent me to looking into the book is the continuing denial
by many Japanese that the so-called ``Rape of Nanking'' _ a brutal
slaughter of thousands of Chinese civilians in 1937 _ was an
exaggeration. Last week, those of that attitude held an unpopular
one-day conference in Osaka.
</P>
<P>
   This denial of a Nanking slaughter followed on the heels of a
Japanese publishing house's decision last May to cancel publication
of a translation of ``The Rape of Nanking'' by American author Iris
Chang.
</P>
<P>
   In this era of soothing through apology, Japan remains reluctant
to own up to its atrocities of World War II. At this late date, an
apology is not necessary; just an acknowledgement will do.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about any misgivings he might have had in ordering
atomic bombs dropped on Japan, Harry Truman reportedly responded:
``I'm still waiting for them to apologize for Pearl Harbor.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, they didn't, and they won't. But that's all right; at
least they admit they participated.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who insist the Holocaust did not occur either.
No amount of grisly photographs or German-kept records will
convince them, because they do not want to be convinced.
Nevertheless, the German government has acknowledged the genocide,
displayed contrition and paid reparations to survivors.
</P>
<P>
   It's different with the Japanese. They are reluctant to own up
to anything. It took until October 1998 for Japan to publicly
acknowledge (and apologize) for its brutality toward the Korean
people (women forced into sex slavery and other crimes) during the
period of occupation from 1910 to 1945.
</P>
<P>
   For whatever reason, the Japanese don't appear prepared to
acknowledge their other atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   In 1937, Tillman Durdin, a veteran foreign correspondent for The
New York Times, was eyewitness to what occurred in Nanking, then
the Chinese capital. Part of his story for the Times read: ``Just
before boarding the ship for Shanghai, the writer watched the
execution of 200 men. The killings took 10 minutes. The men were
lined against the wall and shot. Then a number of Japanese, armed
with pistols, trod nonchalantly around the crumpled bodies, pumping
bullets into any that were still kicking.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems the issue over the Rape of Nanking is muddied in
nuance. Much of the world accepts that as many as 300,000 were
slaughtered in Nanking. Those who disagree never do say how many
they think were slaughtered but denounce the higher numbers as
``myth.''
</P>
<P>
   So, let's assume 300,000 weren't killed; would they accept
150,000? 75,000? What will they acknowledge? Something happened in
Nanking; too many saw it. Pick a number, it still adds up to an
atrocity.
</P>
<P>
   (The number of Vietnamese civilians slaughtered by American
troops in My Lai ranges from 100 to 200 and we acknowledge it as an
atrocity. That's roughly the same amount as the Times's Durdin saw
in just 10 minutes in Nanking.)
</P>
<P>
   Japan's World War II aggressions are steeped in brutality. Look
no further than the vivid Life picture history of the war. On Page
337 is a photograph of a Japanese executioner about to behead a
blindfolded and bound Australian pilot in New Guinea.
</P>
<P>
   All this happened at least 50 years ago; the Rape of Nanking,
the Bataan Death March, the flagrant dismissal of the Geneva
Convention rules of war, and still Japan is reluctant to admit its
heinous behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Own up to it, Japan! If you don't want to apologize, don't. But
at least admit to the crimes your predecessors committed. We can
argue about precise numbers later.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Bush brothers battle it out on death row
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like rival NASCAR drivers revving their engines, the Bush boys
are gunning for the trophy. And it will be a dangerous race, you
may be sure.
</P>
<P>
   Not, of course, for the governors themselves, Jeb in Florida and
George W. in Texas, but for the inmates on their death rows. George
is the points leader by far, but Jeb, not to be done in by an
enervating case of brotherly penal envy, has tuned his own killing
machine to catch up.
</P>
<P>
   After the states were cut loose by the Supreme Court to resume
capital punishment in 1976, Texas rushed to the lead and has held
it for years _ racking up 201 deaths by the end of '99. That was
more than a third of all the executions in the country, and Texas
is now in the midst of a 15-day spree that will kill another seven.
</P>
<P>
   In his mere five years as governor, George W. Bush has presided
over more than half of those executions _ 112 before the current
slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is not unique in this role. Texas politics sometimes
degenerates into contests in which candidates try to outbid each
other in the number of people they promise to execute.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, however, a self-described compassionate conservative and a
professing Christian, has been an especially happy executioner, not
only shrugging off a record rate of execution but opposing
legislation that would have spared mentally retarded defendants and
vetoing a bill to upgrade his state's notoriously awful public
defender system.
</P>
<P>
   Texas has legendarily executed men represented by attorneys who
were drunk or on drugs in court and, in one case, a convict whose
lawyer slept during the trial.
</P>
<P>
   All this puts little brother Jeb at a disadvantage. Florida,
with 44 executions since '76, is third among states after Virginia,
and trails Texas 393 to 458 in the number on death row.
</P>
<P>
   But putting the pedal to the metal, Bush called a special
session of the Florida Legislature this year, which dutifully
enacted legislation to speed up the execution process, with the
goal of cutting the time between conviction and execution to five
years.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that it took an average of 7 1/2 years to free the 87
people sentenced to death but found to have been wrongly convicted
since '76. Two in Florida served 12 years before another man
confessed.
</P>
<P>
   Actual guilt or innocence is of decreasing importance to
legislatures and courts impatient with appeals, including even,
shamefully, the Supreme Court. Congress voted to crimp the federal
appeals process in 1996 and President Clinton signed on. (No
surprise. Running for president in 1992, he theatrically flew back
to Arkansas to oversee the execution of a retarded man.)
</P>
<P>
   The new rules in Florida don't mean Jeb can catch up with
George, or even overtake Virginia, but they will let him make more
of a race of it.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, a 1997 study pegged the murder rate in the 38 states
with capital punishment at 6.6 per 100,000. In the 12 others and
the District of Columbia, it was 3.5. Go figure.

BUSH, GORE EXPECTED TO WIN IN IOWA; FOES LOOK TO N.H.

   DES MOINES _ With front-runners Republican George W. Bush and
Democrat Al Gore holding large leads in the polls for Monday's
caucuses, their opponents in the presidential campaign Sunday began
looking ahead to a much different type of race in next week's New
Hampshire primary and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Former senator Bill Bradley, who is trailing Gore by a 2-to-1
margin in the Iowa polls, Sunday put aside his talk of a
``surprise'' showing and all but conceded defeat to what he called
Iowa's ``entrenched power.'' He vowed to stay in the race for
weeks, at least until the March 7 round of primaries, and said he
hoped to take his fight to the Democratic convention this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Bradley prepared for the prospect of defeat, he received
bad news from New Hampshire, where a CNN poll showed Gore leading
Bradley by 52 percent to 43 percent. Bradley had been ahead in
several polls recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've come a long way from beginning a campaign where I wasn't
known by anybody in Iowa,'' Bradley said on CBS-TV's ``Face The
Nation.'' ``This is the first step of several steps in the
journey.'' Later, his spokeswoman, Anita Dunn, said bluntly, ``We
don't have any doubt that the vice president is going to win this
caucus.'' But she said Bradley would do well in parts of the state.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, Bush tried to make amends for skipping
an antiabortion rally here Saturday night that was attended by his
three of his opponents, Steve Forbes, Gary Bauer and Alan Keyes.
All three have said that Bush is waffling because he will not
commit to an antiabortion litmus test on judges or a vice
presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes, generally regarded as the best orator in the race,
emerged in the final days of campaigning as a potentially
significant factor. While he garnered only 8 percent in the latest
Des Moines Register poll, even a small gain in support could give
him outright possession of third place and hurt the standings of
his closest competitors. The poll showed Bush with 43 percent,
Forbes with 20 percent, Keyes and Senator John McCain with 8
percent, Bauer with 6 percent and Senator Orrin Hatch with 1
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes, addressing a crowd of 500 people at an old dance hall in
West Des Moines Sunday night, continued what he called a moral
crusade, saying that the failure to ban abortion ``could result in
the destruction of our republic, the corruption of our hearts and
the corruption of our discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bush battled his opponents over abortion in Iowa, he faced
a second and possibly more difficult fight on a second front, the
first primary state of New Hampshire. While Bush has a 2-to-1
margin in the Iowa polls, the CNN survey said that McCain, who is
not campaigning in Iowa, leads Bush in New Hampshire 42 percent to
33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   McCain spent Sunday in New Hampshire, where he expects to hold
his 100th town meeting in the state Monday. McCain, asked whether
he would drop out if he does poorly in the early states, including
the Feb. 1 vote in New Hampshire and the Feb. 19 contest in South
Carolina, said he would remain in the race at least until a major
round of primaries on March 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see no scenario where we don't go to March 7,'' McCain said,
referring to the day when New York and California hold their
primaries.
</P>
<P>
   McCain visited Salem High School, where one voter stood up and
seemed to refer to President Clinton's sexual relationship with a
former White House intern. ``I have a request. . . . Don't lie,''
the voter said. ``We don't expect you to be celibate but we do
expect you to be faithful.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain blushed and said that he would never lie as president of
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In Iowa, after months, and for some candidates, years of
campaigning, some 100,000 Democrats and 100,000 Republicans are
expected to attend the caucuses in high schools, church basements
and private homes. The caucuses have a checkered history. Jimmy
Carter used the caucuses as a first step toward winning the White
House in 1976. But other winners here have had less success. Bush's
father, George Bush, won here in 1980 but was defeated in New
Hampshire by Ronald Reagan, who eventually picked Bush as his
running mate.
</P>
<P>
   The last days of the Republican campaign here have been taken
over by a debate over abortion and how intensely the various
candidates oppose it. With Bush's rivals pressuring him to pledge
to pick a ``prolife'' running mate as well as Supreme Court
justices committed to overturn the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision
affirming abortion rights, the Texas governor has been thrown off
stride.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night, Bush skipped an antiabortion rally. But
Sunday, he attended a service at the same site, a Des Moines
Assembly of God church.
</P>
<P>
   Noting Bush's absence on Saturday night, Bauer warned that the
leading Republican candidate imperiled his campaign if he ignored
the religious right. ``Governor,'' he shouted, ``if you are not
going to stand with them, they are not going to stand with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Bush insisted Sunday that he was not being pushed to the
right, his intensified efforts to appeal to religious conservatives
raised the memory of his father's campaign in 1992, when President
Bush sought to appease the deeply conservative forces in his party
and wound up projecting, in the minds of some, an image of
intolerance that may have cost him the general election.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, meanwhile, faced questions during an appearance on
NBC-TV's ``Meet The Press'' about his abortion stance. Tim Russert,
the program's moderator, pointed out that the antiabortion crusader
Phyllis Schlafly had faulted Forbes's commitment on the issue four
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes said his position had been misunderstood. Schlafly agreed
to campaign with him in Iowa this month, he said, after becoming
convinced that his opposition to abortion had been consistent.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Forbes accused the Bush campaign of engineering
phone calls to voters that attacked his positions.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes aides said the calls were made this week by the
Republican Leadership Council, a moderate group based in
Washington. But Forbes portrayed the group Sunday as an arm of the
Bush campaign, saying the two share many of the same officials and
financial backers. He also noted the RLC has run advertisements
defending Bush against Forbes's criticisms.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Forbes campaign, voters received calls asking
whom they are supporting in the caucus. Those who said they are
Forbes supporters soon received another phone call from the RLC
providing negative information about Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really do a job on me,'' Forbes said.
</P>
<P>
   Other calls, said Forbes campaign manager Bill Dal Col, told
voters that Forbes was running a negative campaign, and patched
them through to Forbes's headquarters with an encouragement to
complain. Dal Col said the campaign would file a complaint with the
Federal Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   RLC officials and the Bush campaign could not be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, like many of the challengers, looked ahead to New
Hampshire, noting that his campaign manager expected the race there
to be a Forbes-McCain contest.
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaigned confidently, but he voiced concern that
supporters won't venture out into the bitter cold Iowa weather to
vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't believe the polls,'' Gore said, referring to a Des
Moines Register survey that shows him beating Bradley by 56 percent
to 28 percent. ``Don't let anything foster the slightest bit of
complacency or overconfidence, because the only decision that
matters is the one that will come out of the caucus itself, the one
in your precinct.''
</P>
<P>
   In his most pointed remarks of the day, Gore told an audience at
a Davenport high school that Bradley has treated education reform
as an ``afterthought.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, while digesting the bad news from the polls, was buoyed
by Sunday's endorsement by the Des Moines Register, which lauded
his ``compelling'' vision. The former New Jersey senator promptly
began an airing a last-minute television commercial touting the
endorsement of the state's largest newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley vowed to remain in the race. ``I hope we are going to
have major wins down the road and we'll be able to move onto the
convention,'' he said. ``No question about that.''

IOWA'S STORY IS AMERICA'S 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORIENT, Iowa _ Walk the land out back beyond the white clapboard
house _ press your boots onto the corn and soybean fields that
start where the dirt road ends _ and along with the chill winds you
will feel the two elements that shaped modern Iowa:
</P>
<P>
   Isolation. Possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Here, 55 miles southwest of the street corners of Des Moines, is
the endless horizon that is Iowa's, and that stands as a metaphor
for America, from pioneer days to the present. Here, an hour from
the world of malls and machines, are some of the richest farmlands
in the world, the source of Iowa's wealth, and of America's.
</P>
<P>
   And here, in obscure Adair County, is the birthplace of Henry
Agard Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace _ publisher, philosopher, politician _ stood firmly at
the center of all the important tensions that formed the state that
today holds the first important political test of this presidential
election year.
</P>
<P>
   In a career that began with family-owned Wallaces' Farmer
magazine and included the founding of the Hi-Bred Corn Co., service
as secretary of agriculture and vice president in the New Deal
years, and a longshot 1948 presidential campaign on the Progressive
ticket, Wallace personified the transformation from local to
national control in agriculture and politics; the application of
science to traditional ways of life and of thinking; and the
movement toward stronger, more activist government.
</P>
<P>
   That is the story of Iowa, and of America, in the last 100
years.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Iowa's precinct caucuses are the opening of the
political season is merely a happy coincidence of the calendar. But
stretching 310 miles, from the Mississippi to the Missouri, and
standing right here in the center of the country, Iowa is marked by
the wagon tracks of history's march from the East and by the
highways and the fiber-optic cable that ease the movement of
technology and trends from the West.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa has a physical shape much like America's _ and an outlook
much like the country's.
</P>
<P>
   ``We . . . hold to our two major aims,'' Wallace wrote in his
magazine in April 1926, half a decade before the Depression, ``to
make the readers of Wallaces' Farmer efficient enough to survive in
the bitter struggle now going on; to bring about mass action of
farmers as a class that will put agriculture on a level with other
occupations.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past 100 years many of the great themes of modern
American history _ the ``bitter struggle'' that Wallace chronicled,
and conducted _ have been played out in the prairies, farm towns,
rail centers, river towns, and urban markets of Iowa. Here, all of
the historic tensions between insiders and outsiders _ the American
story _ have been made real.
</P>
<P>
   Like the country, modern Iowa was shaped by the struggle of
Catholics and Protestants; of natives and immigrants; of labor and
capital; of wet and dry; of those who favor isolationism and those
who favor international engagement; and by struggle between the
dreams of whites and the aspirations of racial minorities, whether
they be the blacks who lived in de facto segregation in Des Moines
and had their own branch of the NAACP as early as 1915, or the
Asians who in the 1980s crowded into meat-packing centers like
Dubuque and Sioux City, or the Latinos who even now are flocking to
river cities like Muscatine and small industrial centers like
Marshalltown.
</P>
<P>
   This was the home of Herbert Hoover, who, like Wallace, prided
himself on being a scientist and on feeding the multitudes but
whose leadership was repudiated in his home state, and around the
country, in the depths of the Depression; of James Van Allen, who
discovered the high-intensity radiation bands around the earth and
who symbolizes the state's, and the nation's, willingness to look
to the far beyond; of Meredith Willson, who wrote ``The Music Man''
and spoke of trouble in River City, which is to say, in Hometown,
USA; of Carrie Chapman Catt, who organized for women's rights and
sought to mobilize half the nation's citizens; of Norman Borlaug,
the crop geneticist who exported Iowa knowhow (and agricultural
fecundity) around the world; and of George Gallup, who popularized
the notion of public opinion and is one of the high priests of the
political arts being celebrated in the caucus at more than 2,000
sites.
</P>
<P>
   At the very beginning, Iowa was formed by glaciers, which, like
the settlers who followed many thousands of years later, carried
the pebbles of the past to Iowa. But unlike the cattle frontier of
the Great Plains, the mining frontier of the mountain West, and the
fur-trading frontier of the Great Lakes, all settled by single men
who were only temporary visitors, Iowa was settled by farmers. They
planted crops and planted roots.
</P>
<P>
   It was, and remains, the family-farming frontier. The state had
women and children from the beginning. No domestic culture ever was
imposed on this state. It grew here naturally. ``We've been G-rated
from the beginning,'' says Thomas J. Morain, who once taught
history at Iowa State University but who today is the administrator
of the State Historical Society of Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason _ because, nearly alone among the pioneers of
frontier states, Iowans weren't just passing through _ all the
struggles of Iowa history have been intimate and intense. And they
can all be traced to the relationship between Iowans and the land _
and to the conviction, expressed by the first Henry Wallace, the
founder of the family magazine, that the prairies and the people
who worked them were the ``underlying foundation of our republican
institutions'' and ``the stay and character of the country in times
of war and its guiding and controlling interest in times of peace
and prosperity when other classes lose their heads.''
</P>
<P>
   That theme is planted deep in the character of the people, and
the farmlands, of Iowa. In his 1913 history of Fort Dodge and
Webster County, L.S. Coffin spoke of how Iowans broke the sod in
the early spring: ``A man with an axe would follow the line of
every second or third furrow, strike the blade deep in the ground,
a boy or girl would follow and drop three or four kernals of corn
in the hole and bring one foot down right smart on the hole in the
sod, and the deed was done.''
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between the ``beautiful lands'' that Father
Jacques Marquette noted in his journal in 1673 and Iowa's men,
women, and children has always been organic, in every sense of the
word.
</P>
<P>
   And so when the compact between man and the land _ between the
family frontier and the needs of the family _ has been broken,
whether by nature or by markets, there has been disappointment,
despair _ and rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 100 years, rebellion has flared twice.
</P>
<P>
   It came first when Henry Wallace's readers _ isolated, their
children in bad schools, their homes without electric lights or
indoor plumbing _ were excluded from the prosperity of the 1920s.
Almost every issue of Wallaces' Farmer in 1920 carried this ad:
``Time for farm women to learn about Jell-O like city women.''
</P>
<P>
   But the rebellion wasn't about Jell-O. In the 1920s, Iowa led
the nation in bank suspensions. By 1932, farm products were selling
for half, or less, of their average price in the 1920s. In the
first nine months of 1932 alone, 257 Iowa farms were sold at
foreclosure. The situation was so bad, Iowa farmers came to believe
that state testing of cattle for bovine tuberculosis was a
conspiracy to lower meat prices. The result was the Iowa Cow War, a
mass protest by farmers determined to prevent veterinarians from
performing the test.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the Cow War led to war in the streets and in the chambers
of the state legislature. With grain prices frighteningly low,
pitchfork-wielding farmers invaded the Capitol. Farmers blocked all
10 highways leading into Sioux City, sometimes with spiked
telephone poles, hoping to prevent any milk from entering the city
and calling for a ``farmers' holiday.'' Mobs halted farm
foreclosures in Pocahontas, Dakota City, and Roland. The effort to
stop foreclosures led angry farmers in Le Mars, in the western part
of the state, to drag a judge from his bench, strip him down to his
long johns, put him on a truck, threaten him with castration, and
nearly hang him.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think of Iowa as a pretty quiet place,'' says George
Mills, 93, who covered the farm rebellion for the Marshalltown
Times Republican. ``But it was pretty wild in this state.''
</P>
<P>
   It was pretty wild, too, a half-century later, when the rural
credit crisis of the 1980s brought Iowa's family-farm culture under
new strains and pressures. With land prices dropping and farm debt
growing, farmers were caught in a classic squeeze. By the end of
1986, two dozen banks in Iowa had failed, along with farm-implement
manufacturers and dealerships.
</P>
<P>
   ``The '80s was a decade when many Iowans affected by the
economic crisis lost whatever innocence they had left, when the
social fabric of long-standing personal and community relationships
built on mutual trust and common purpose unravelled in the heat of
economic chaos and unleashed market forces,'' wrote David
Ostendorf, who was a cofounder of PrairieFire Rural Action, perhaps
the principal group of farm activists in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The continuing struggle to preserve the family farm is a symbol
of larger struggles in Iowa and across the country. In the years
from 1973 to 1987, a period that marked the ascendancy of the
corporation from coast to coast and across international
boundaries, Iowa lost 22,000 farms. In the past half-century, more
than 100,000 family farms have disappeared from Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Farm struggles, moreover, have stood as emblems of larger
tensions throughout Iowa's history.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle between rural America and urban America is neatly
encapsulated in the bitter, bruising Iowa fight over the otherwise
prosaic product called oleomargarine. Iowa had regulated oleo since
1886 and had imposed regulations restricting descriptions of oleo
that ``suggested any connection . . . with a cow, dairy or
creamery.'' During the Depression, the state even imposed a
nickel-a-pound tax on the product. It wasn't until 1953 that the
legislature legalized oleo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The oleo legislation, allowing margarine to compete on equal
terms with butter, represented a victory for the growing urban
forces in Iowa and, as such, underscored the most significant
change under way in Iowa in the 1950s,'' wrote the Iowa State
University historian Dorothy Schweider in ``Iowa: The Middle
Land.''
</P>
<P>
   All these changes have been reflected in the politics of Iowa,
which for much of its early years was so devoutly Republican that
Senator James Dolliver proclaimed in 1883 that ``Iowa will go
Democratic when Hell goes Methodist.'' Nobody dissented from that
view. Indeed, the few Democrats were primarily in the railroad
towns and river cities, where Irish and German Catholic outsiders,
working in roundhouses, rail shops, packing houses, and small
factories, mingled uneasily with the Methodists,
Congregationalists, and Presbyterians who until that time dominated
small-town Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   But the farm distress of the 1920s and 1930s shook Iowa to its
rural roots, and eventually the state rejected its favorite son,
Herbert Hoover of West Branch, giving a stunning 60 percent victory
(and a 65 percent margin in rural areas) to Franklin Delano
Roosevelt in the 1932 election.
</P>
<P>
   The 1930s was a decade of immense change, accompanied by the
revival of the Democratic Party in the state. The Agricultural
Adjustment Act and Farm Credit Act of 1933 provided swift and
effective assistance, and as late as 1936, the Works Progress
Administration provided work relief to 10,000 farmers. All this
contributed to the centralization of power in big government. A big
strike at the Maytag plant in 1938 underlined the growing power of
big labor _ and divided the farm/labor coalition that so changed
the political character of Iowa in the New Deal years.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the traditional Republican cities that strayed to FDR's
column in 1932 and 1936 veered back to the Republicans shortly
thereafter, in part because foreign-policy issues began to dominate
political discourse.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans thrived in statewide elections and the Democratic
strength of the New Deal disappeared by the 1950s and 1960s. Terry
Branstad, a conservative Republican who represented a break from
the moderate Republicanism that was ascendant in the 1970s, won
election to four consecutive terms as Iowa's governor in the 1980s
and 1990s. But in national elections, many of the country towns
remained Democratic, and in the decade of the modern farm crisis,
Governor Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts ran stronger in Iowa
in 1988 than even Roosevelt had in 1932 and 1936.
</P>
<P>
   Today's Iowa is less rural and less isolated than ever before _
but more rural and more isolated than much of the rest of the
country. The sense of possibility that filled the fields around
Henry Agard Wallace's homestead is as durable as ever. So, too, is
the ethos of Wallace, which combined the rural and the scientific,
the romantic and the rational, the cultural and the political.
</P>
<P>
   For years the front cover of Wallaces' Farmer carried its
guiding credo: ``Good Farming, Clear Thinking, Right Living.'' The
magazine is still in business, and though the publishers dropped
the credo, so evocative of old Iowa, last fall, the sentiment
remains in the new Iowa that the caucus provides the nation with
its political guidance.

MONTREAL IS EDUCATION CAPITAL, STUDY SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN BARRY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new study from McGill University asserts that the North
American city most densely packed with scholars lies not across the
Charles, but across the St. Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
   Experts from the Canadian university's Planning Office said that
Montreal has edged out Boston for the highest concentration of
university students. Using data from the 1996 census, McGill's
Planning Office reported that Montreal has 4.38 students per 100
residents _ compared to 4.37 students per 100 in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   If true, that statistic could be hard to swallow in Boston,
which, as a McGill press release diplomatically puts it, ``is often
admired as the intellectual capital of North America.''
</P>
<P>
   University officials said they did not set out to compete with
Boston's burnished academic image. But when they crunched the
numbers, they were surprised to discover that Montreal came in
first _ a boast that is likely to prove useful to city officials
trying to broadcast the availability of educated workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're ecstatic,'' said Real Del Degan, a spokesman for the
McGill Planning Office. ``I've had colleagues who have been to City
Hall since the study came out, and the guys are in a wonderful
mood.''
</P>
<P>
   Montreal is home to four universities with more than 30,000
students each: McGill, the University of Montreal, Concordia, and
the University of Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics have raised a few eyebrows south of the 49th
parallel, especially in cities where higher-education officials
have ranked themselves higher on the list than McGill did.
</P>
<P>
   A dense population of university students can improve a city's
image to burgeoning businesses, said Michael A. Gerber, of the
Atlanta Regional Consortium for Higher Education, which released
its own ranking last spring.
</P>
<P>
   But a review of McGill's claims seemed to inspire little fear in
Boston City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that students are going to stop coming to Boston
anytime soon,'' said John Dorsey, a spokesman for Mayor Thomas M.
Menino. ``A lot of these schools are household names for people
from the time they're growing up. Boston is synonymous with higher
education.''
</P>
<P>
   By McGill's calculations, Montreal and the
Boston-Worcester-Lawrence area are neck-and-neck at the top of the
list, with the Denver-Boulder-Greely area third with 4.1 university
students per 100 city residents, the Minneapolis-St. Paul area
fourth with 3.24, and the Norfolk-Virginia Beach-Newport News area
fifth with 3.09 students per 100 citizens. The study excluded
two-year colleges and community colleges, and took into account
large suburban expanses as well as city centers.
</P>
<P>
   Those factors _ and the resulting rankings _ seem wrong to
Gerber. His Atlanta-based Consortium came up with entirely
different rankings last spring in a survey that included two-year
colleges and excluded suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Boston came first in his survey, with 4.3 higher-education
students per 100 people; New York came second, with 4.0 per 100;
and Atlanta came third, with 3.72.
</P>
<P>
   Because his study focused only on American cities, it has no
ranking for Montreal. However, Gerber said he's sure it would not
have come out on top.
</P>
<P>
   Boston has no reason to worry, he said. ``If you've got brand
identity to begin with you don't have to worry so much about these
numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Other observers doubted whether a high per-capita student
population was any kind of a measure of academic excellence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd really like to compare the academic research and
development in Boston with the academic research and development in
Montreal,'' said John Hoy, president of the New England Board of
Higher Education. ``We'd just wipe them off the map.''
</P>
<P>
   And at Boston University's Sherman Union, students said they
doubted any city could rival Boston's academic brand name.
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel like you're at the center of where everything goes,''
said Jaime Jenkinson, a 19-year-old freshman from Cedar, Minn.
``You're sure that the most brilliant people who ever walked the
face of the earth are literally two blocks from you.''

   ULAN BATOR -- Father Gilbert knows every open manhole in
Mongolia's capital, Ulan Bator, and, more important, the children
who live below them.
</P>
<P>
   Every Wednesday this Filipino priest delivers hot tea and mutton
pancakes across the city.
</P>
<P>
   The first port of call, a manhole between the Hard Rock Club and
the Ulan Bator Hotel, has half-a-dozen children living in it. Last
year, one child stabbed another to death here. A second child died
in an alcohol-induced coma.
</P>
<P>
   During the day, the girls from this manhole offer themselves to
men for $5 a time. That is good money, if they get it.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent day, they had money and only one of the children, a
boy of 14, came up the ladder to greet Father Gilbert. The others,
he said, had been drinking vodka and had passed out. With a grin,
the boy took the food and went below again.
</P>
<P>
   The manholes, in which many of Ulan Bator's nearly 3,000 street
children live, are fetid places that lead either to the sewers or
to the city's heating system. Underground life does nothing to
reduce the high incidence among the children of scabies,
tuberculosis, urinary infections and sexually transmitted diseases.
</P>
<P>
   But at least it is warm. Ulan Bator is the world's coldest
capital city, with sub-zero winter temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   By leaving the covers open, the government acknowledges that the
manholes have become life-savers. Indeed, aid workers say that
deaths from hypothermia are more common in the summer, when a cold
snap can catch the homeless off guard.
</P>
<P>
   The street children of Mongolia have earned plenty of attention
from aid agencies because of where they live. Some 20 ``shelters''
for those in Ulan Bator are now paid for by non-governmental
organizations (NGOs). They range from a simple ger (a felt tent)
that acts as a half-way house, to the well-organized home for 130
children run by Father Gilbert.
</P>
<P>
   Children's charities, such as the Christina Noble Children's
Foundation, have launched international appeals to help Mongolia's
street children.
</P>
<P>
   The thought of children having to live in sewers is one that can
wrench almost any heart. The country's winter temperatures,
however, are one of only two differences between homeless children
in Ulan Bator and those, say, in Manila or Rio de Janeiro.
</P>
<P>
   Another is the speed with which street children have become a
problem. In communist days, the Soviet Union supplied subsidies
that approached one-third of Mongolia's GDP. As a result, Mongolia,
though poor, had a decent enough social-welfare system, and few
Mongolians fell through its cracks.
</P>
<P>
   Uranbileg Bergen, who works for the government's National Center
for Children, says that in 1992--just after Mongolians threw off
Soviet protection in favor of democracy and capitalism--there were
just 300 known street children in all of Mongolia. The number is
likely to reach 4,000 this year.
</P>
<P>
   This has shocked many Mongolians. Yet some, inside government
and outside it, cling to the belief that the problem of children
living in the streets--or under them--has come about because people
are too lazy to look after their children and too ready to accept
handouts. This is naive. The majority of children are driven on to
the streets by plain poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Families may not be able to afford school books or uniforms, so
their children drop out of school. They then hang out on the
streets, earning money by begging, prostitution or theft.
</P>
<P>
   Other families, particularly in the countryside, cannot afford
to look after their children, who are sent to relations. Given
Mongolia's tradition of nomadic herding, it is not difficult for
these children to be passed from one relation to another, until the
parents have lost touch with them.
</P>
<P>
   Others are driven from home by strains within their families: by
abusive, alcoholic fathers or by the consequences of parental
divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes whole families are driven on to the streets,
particularly if their ger, their most valuable possession,
accidentally burns down.
</P>
<P>
   Poverty and family break-up have risen sharply during the
``transition'' from communism. Miss Uranbileg believes that the
roots of the problem lie with poverty. She says the NGOs are
falling over each other to treat the symptom--the street
children--but not the cause. Better to provide family support to
help children stay at school, or to get them medical attention.
Better still to provide the means for families to earn an income.
</P>
<P>
   Several NGOs are trying. Save the Children Fund, which runs
shelters in Mongolia to get children back into society, also pays
for mobile kindergartens that follow nomadic herders. It has
encouraged schemes for single mothers to earn money.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty with such ventures, which often involve the
provision of micro-credit, is that cash is scarce in Mongolia's
countryside. More successful, says Marc LaPorte of Save the
Children, is a herd-restocking scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Yet money remains a problem. The average Mongolian household
earns less than $400 a year. The government is bust. Miss Uranbileg
has files on 4,000 families that her department has identified as
being most in need of ``sponsorship,'' or the $20 a month they need
to keep children at school. Last year 400 of those families were
promised such sponsorship, but the money from the central
government dried up after only two months.
</P>
<P>
   The National Center for Children itself, responsible for all
aspects of children and child poverty, has an annual budget of only
$100,000. Of the original 4,000 families, says Miss Uranbileg as
she pushes the dossiers back in the cupboard, only 30 are currently
getting any money at all.

   MOSCOW -- Mobile phones used to symbolize the nasty side of the
new Russia: prices were high, service bad, and the customers were
an unsavory bunch of well-connected show-offs.
</P>
<P>
   But a combination of foreign ideas and chilly market conditions
is changing the picture. The mobile-phone industry, centered on
Moscow, is now an encouragingly competitive and mass-market
business.
</P>
<P>
   Until the summer of 1998, two companies had the market largely
sewn up between them. One, VimpelCom, had good connections with the
federal authorities, thanks to its top managers' background in
government communications. The other, MTS, was one of many
lucrative businesses in the capital with close links to the Moscow
city government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spooks versus cronies'' was one pithy characterization.
</P>
<P>
   There was little real competition. MTS used the European
standard, GSM, convenient when travelling abroad, but with skimpy
coverage in Moscow. VimpelCom had started earlier, with somewhat
inferior American technology, but had a slightly better set-up in
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   A typical Moscow biznesmen might have an MTS phone for himself
(handy for those trips to offshore financial centers), while his
driver and wife would have VimpelCom ones. Tariffs were remarkably
similar.
</P>
<P>
   The financial crisis in August 1998 turned this cozy world
upside down. The market shrank drastically.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, VimpelCom's shares (listed in New York), fell by
more than 80 percent. The company also suffered from the ruble's
devaluation, because it kept its cash in Russian government
securities, which defaulted. It announced a $43.9 million loss in
the third quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The turnaround has been rapid. By the end of 1998, it had struck
an alliance with a Norwegian company, Telenor, swapping a 25.7
percent stake for a $160 million cash injection. (MTS already had a
foreign partner, Deutsche Telekom, but the alliance had been
hamstrung by financial wrangles). Telenor's advice was simple:
volume.
</P>
<P>
   In October last year, VimpelCom launched a new pre-paid service,
centered on a $49 box containing a handset (worth around $64) and a
$10 calling card. To many Russians, the idea of selling something
for less than it cost seemed absurd--but irresistible. The first
10,000 handsets sold out within days.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to this and other schemes, VimpelCom has now almost
caught up with MTS, with around 350,000 subscribers at the end of
the year, more than double the level in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Yet VimpelCom's approach has two potential weaknesses. One is
that pre-paid systems tend to attract stingy customers. The other
is the danger of relying on its old technology.
</P>
<P>
   The first of these is muted by Russia's primitive financial
system. Without direct debit from bank accounts or credit cards,
paying a monthly mobile bill is a chore. VimpelCom's pre-paid
cards, by contrast, are sold at hundreds of retail outlets in
Moscow. Even rich customers may find that more convenient than
queuing to pay their telephone bill.
</P>
<P>
   The company is sidestepping the technological problem by rapidly
building a modern GSM network, spending $60 million this year
(compared with almost nothing on its old network). The aim is to
get the best customers to switch to GSM, encouraged by, for
example, discounts on handsets.
</P>
<P>
   VimpelCom's competitors are trying to catch up by using even
newer technology. One, Sonet, which uses the latest CDMA system,
provides excellent sound quality, but unfortunately lacks a mobile
license in Russia. Sonet salesmen solemnly warn new customers that
they may use their new handsets only from their offices.
</P>
<P>
   Another, MCC, which operates an almost obsolete system that was
common in Scandinavia a decade ago, plans to launch a GSM service.
</P>
<P>
   The big question, however, is how the former market leader, MTS,
will react to VimpelCom's recovery. It is cutting prices (but not
as hard) and upgrading its congested network (but not as fast).
</P>
<P>
   ``VimpelCom is that rare bird: a Russian management that changes
a failing strategy,'' says Tom Adshead, a telecom analyst at Troika
Dialog in Moscow. ``MTS is going to have to learn a harsh lesson:
that you cannot be a large operator and an elite brand at the same
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia's mobile-phone market has a long way to go before it
becomes normal: subscribers still pay up to 50 cents a minute for
incoming calls. With average salaries below $200 a month,
penetration is still only 1.3 million in a country of 148 million.
</P>
<P>
   All the more potential for an outfit like VimpelCom, which, like
MTS, has a swathe of mobile licenses across Russia? Perhaps. But
the huge discount on VimpelCom shares compared with mobile
companies elsewhere shows the worries investors have about anything
that depends on Russian political and economic stability.

the year, more than double the level in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Yet VimpelCom's approach has two potential weaknesses. One is
that pre-paid systems tend to attract stingy customers. The other
is the danger of relying on its old technology.
</P>
<P>
   The first of these is muted by Russia's primitive financial
system. Without direct debit from bank accounts or credit cards,
paying a monthly mobile bill is a chore. VimpelCom's pre-paid
cards, by contrast, are sold at hundreds of retail outlets in
Moscow. Even rich customers may find that more convenient than
queuing to pay their telephone bill.
</P>
<P>
   The company is sidestepping the technological problem by rapidly
building a modern GSM network, spending $60 million this year
(compared with almost nothing on its old network). The aim is to
get the best customers to switch to GSM, encouraged by, for
example, discounts on handsets.
</P>
<P>
   VimpelCom's competitors are trying to catch up by using even
newer technology. One, Sonet, which uses the latest CDMA system,
provides excellent sound quality, but unfortunately lacks a mobile
license in Russia. Sonet salesmen solemnly warn new customers that
they may use their new handsets only from their offices.
</P>
<P>
   Another, MCC, which operates an almost obsolete system that was
common in Scandinavia a decade ago, plans to launch a GSM service.
</P>
<P>
   The big question, however, is how the former market leader, MTS,
will react to VimpelCom's recovery. It is cutting prices (but not
as hard) and upgrading its congested network (but not as fast).
</P>
<P>
   ``VimpelCom is that rare bird: a Russian management that changes
a failing strategy,'' says Tom Adshead, a telecom analyst at Troika
Dialog in Moscow. ``MTS is going to have to learn a harsh lesson:
that you cannot be a large operator and an elite brand at the same
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia's mobile-phone market has a long way to go before it
becomes normal: subscribers still pay up to 50 cents a minute for
incoming calls. With average salaries below $200 a month,
penetration is still only 1.3 million in a country of 148 million.
</P>
<P>
   All the more potential for an outfit like VimpelCom, which, like
MTS, has a swathe of mobile licenses across Russia? Perhaps. But
the huge discount on VimpelCom shares compared with mobile
companies elsewhere shows the worries investors have about anything
that depends on Russian political and economic stability.

   CAIRO -- Their women are sluttish schemers. Their men are
scowling thugs, prone to blood-spilling and to a strange guttural
barking.
</P>
<P>
   Two decades of peace have done little to soften the image.
Egyptian popular culture still pictures Israelis as the enemy
everyone loves to hate.
</P>
<P>
   Demonization pervades the press, publishing and movie
industries. So much so that when Cairo tabloids alleged that a
millennium-eve concert at the pyramids was in fact a satanic
Zionist ritual, the jittery government cancelled parts of the show.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, some Egyptians actually believed that a golden
pyramidion, which was to have been placed on top of the Great
Pyramid, was secretly intended to represent a Jewish skullcap.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the blame for such attitudes lies with Egyptian film
makers. Israeli villains have featured in half a dozen Egyptian
television serials and a dozen full-length films since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, of the 20 films released by Cairo studios last year, a
quarter exploited anti-Israeli themes. Plots vary, but tend to
travel well-worn ground. There is the wicked Israeli woman who
ensnares innocent Egyptian youth, as in the films ``Love in Taba''
(1992) or ``A Girl From Israel'' (1999). There is the savvy
Egyptian hero who foils Israeli intelligence, as in ``The Road to
Eilat'' (1995), ``48 Hours in Israel'' (1998) or ``Al Kfir''
(1999).
</P>
<P>
   In the climax to the popular 1998 comedy ``A Country Bumpkin
goes to College,'' the politically correct hero burns the Israeli
flag.
</P>
<P>
   Even more disturbingly, some of this movie fare includes scenes
that are frankly anti-Semitic. Last year's most popular film,
``Hamam in Amsterdam'' follows the comic trials of an Egyptian
emigre whose struggle to make it in Europe is thwarted at every
turn by a bad guy called Yehuda.
</P>
<P>
   In ``A Girl from Israel,'' the father of the Israeli seductress
is portrayed as a satanic manipulator. When the naive Egyptian
youth's father--a man who has a habit of quoting sagely from ``The
Protocols of the Elders of Zion''--washes after shaking hands with
the devilish Israeli, the water runs red.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli diplomats express anger that the Egyptian government
refrains from using its wide powers of censorship against such
stereotyping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would Egyptians be so patient if their flag was burned in an
Israeli film?'' asks Israel's press counsellor in Cairo. Speaking
more philosophically, however, he suggests that the hostility
reflects a culture with deep fears of losing its dominant role in
the region.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptians generally attribute the fashion for Israel-bashing to
the commercial success of the first hostile films, whose release
coincided with events that had already blackened Israel's image,
such as the brutal suppression of the Palestinian intifada and the
bombing of civilians in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Egypt's leading film critic, Mostafa Darwish, believes there
is truth to the charge that the censors remain too lenient.
</P>
<P>
   How seriously does the Egyptian public take all this? Luckily,
not very. Cairo critics have panned most of the recent films.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Kfir'', which tells the story of a dashing Egyptian
aviation engineer who sabotages an Israeli fighter prototype,
lasted barely a week in Cairo's cinemas after audiences laughed out
loud at the hero's supposed seductive power over Israeli Amazons.
</P>
<P>
   Darwish is hopeful that such flops spell the end of the
trend--and, in fact, none of the new films this winter touches on
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the ugly imagery may have an enduring impact. Egyptian
sensibilities aside, it has certainly made Israelis feel
increasingly unwelcome. Ten years ago, tourists from the Jewish
state travelled all over Egypt. Of the 300,000 who visited in 1998,
90 percent never left the Hebrew-accented beach resorts of southern
Sinai.

TOP ATHLETES NOT IMMUNE TO TESTICULAR CANCER
</HEADLINE>
  (Includes color photos of Lance Armstrong, Ken Dennard and Scott
Hamilton) 
 By SCOTT IRWIN 
 c.1999 NYT Regional Newspapers 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pro athlete Ken Dennard was the picture of good health. At
6-foot-8 and 250 pounds, the 23-year-old was a lean, muscular
forward starting a career in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Then, one week before the Kansas City Kings' training camp began
in 1982, he discovered a tiny lump in his left testicle.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was about the size of a BB and it didn't hurt,'' said
Dennard, who played on the Duke team that reached the 1978 NCAA
finals. ''When I felt it, I knew it wasn't supposed to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Athletes have a keen awareness of their bodies, so Dennard
didn't hesitate. He consulted with the Kings' trainer, who referred
him to a urologist. The urologist told him he should undergo
surgery immediately to have the testicle removed.
</P>
<P>
   Dennard balked before the urologist explained.
</P>
<P>
   ''He told me that nine times out of 10 it's malignant,'' Dennard
said. ''When you hear that, of course, you go numb.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennard was stricken with testicular cancer, a disease that is
still fairly rare. The American Cancer Society estimates that 7,400
new cases will be diagnosed this year. But while it represents only
1 percent of all male cancers, it's the leading cause of cancer for
men in their 20s and 30s.
</P>
<P>
   Testicular cancer can strike even the healthiest young men.
Figure skater Scott Hamilton had it, as did professional baseball
player John Kruk. Lance Armstrong, who recently won the Tour de
France, had an advanced case of it. And Green Bay Packers punter
Josh Bidwell was recently diagnosed with it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Testicular cancer, for some reason, seems to be on the rise,''
said Dr. Ed Whitesides of Urology Associates of Southeastern North
Carolina. ''It used to be about three to five per 100,000 men; now
it's more like eight to 10. No one knows why.''
</P>
<P>
   Men should conduct self-examinations once a month, say
urologists and oncologists.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't stress how important that is,'' said Dr. Mary Raab, an
oncologist at the East Carolina School of Medicine. ''It's so
important. Women start doing a breast check when they begin
menstruating. At the same time, boys should start checking
themselves as early as age 13.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennard, a volunteer for Coaches vs. Cancer, often counsels
victims and speaks publicly on battling testicular cancer. He
credits early detection with saving his life.
</P>
<P>
   ''You should not be ashamed of your body,'' he said. ''You have
to take care of yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennard had the testicle removed, then went through 20 sessions
of radiation therapy. The radiation cured him of cancer, although
it damaged his digestive system.
</P>
<P>
   Radiation, a common form of treatment that follows surgery, is
primarily used to treat cancer that has spread from the testicle to
lymph nodes.
</P>
<P>
   Breakthroughs in platinum-based chemotherapy drugs have helped
increase the survival rate of men with testicular cancer to 95
percent, Raab said. The American Cancer Society estimates that 300
people in America will die of testicular cancer this year.
</P>
<P>
   As with radiation, some patients treated with chemotherapy have
long-term side effects, such as kidney damage and nerve damage.
</P>
<P>
   Because he didn't detect his testicular cancer early, pro
cyclist Armstrong had to endure months of chemotherapy in 1996. The
cancer spread to his lungs and brain, and he underwent surgery to
remove a testicle and lesions from his brain. Doctors gave him a 50
percent chance of survival.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong did survive, and he went on to win one of sports' most
demanding events last summer. His recovery, like Dennard's,
illustrates that with treatment, victims of testicular cancer can
go on to live normal lives.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a man who came from the depths of chemotherapy . . . and
came out on top,'' said Karl Hausmann, who heads the Lance
Armstrong Foundation, which raises money for cancer research.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the Tour de France ''really brought back some feelings
of thankfulness,'' Dennard said. ''His recovery was even more
courageous because of where his cancer had spread.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennard also returned to competitive athletics after surgery and
treatment. He played 30 games for the Kings during the 1982-83
season, then another two years for the Denver Nuggets and in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Like many men who survive testicular cancer, Dennard started a
family. He now has a 4-year-old son, Mason.
</P>
<P>
   Chemotherapy can result in a temporary reduction in sperm count,
Raab said, but in most cases that rate returns to normal. Because
of the sensitive nature of testicular cancer, many men need
counseling in addition to the treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ''Especially in the younger population, when the cancer often
strikes, this is a threat to their manhood or masculinity,'' Raab
said. ''Some of these young men go through a tough time. They feel
it's almost like they're being castrated.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennard, who now owns an investor-relations firm in Houston,
said attitudes have changed since the Kansas City Kings' publicly
announced that he suffered from ''cancer of the lower intestine''
rather than reveal where the cancer really was.
</P>
<P>
   ''More men are sensitive to their feelings than 20 years ago,''
he said. ''My counsel is, 'Don't let fear paralyze you,''' he said.
''It's OK to feel fear _ just don't let it control you.''

KIDS NEED TO LEARN THAT DIFFERENT DOESN'T MEAN BAD

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)   All the
Difference in the World: Living In A Multicultural Society
<TEXT>
<P>
   When I was in school we learned that this country was a melting
pot, a society of immigrants on the way to becoming as uniform and
homogenized as milk. We touted the fact that we were Americans,
never noticing that the image _ blonde haired, blue eyed, white
skinned, and male _ clearly left a great many of us out of the
picture.
</P>
<P>
   We all sang Christmas carols at holiday time, whether it was
part of our family's tradition or not. We weren't taught that some
people might not want to give up their cultural identity, or that
other groups were kept marginal, barred from the mainstream, with
no chance of ''melting'' in. Prejudice got a cursory mention.
</P>
<P>
   But the message today's children are getting is different.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're making a fundamental shift in how we portray our
national past and the make-up of this country,'' said Tim Mitchell,
multicultural coordinator for the Cleveland Heights-University
Heights school system in Ohio. ''We're looking at who has been left
out. We want to present a more inclusive and accurate reflection of
the fact that we live in a multicultural society.''
</P>
<P>
   Multicultural is a word most parents didn't grow up hearing, but
now it's a concept we need to understand. ''Diversity is not only
about differences of skin color or ethnicity,'' said Fay Sholiton,
trustee of National Council of Christians and Jews.
''Multiculturalism looks at all divisions of gender, class,
economic status, age, and ability that exclude people in our
society.''
</P>
<P>
   What children need to learn is that different doesn't mean bad.
It's natural to notice differences, and kids tend to group
impressions under two basic headings, ''like me'' and ''not like
me.'' They'll point out and comment, usually in an embarrassingly
loud voice, on what they see.
</P>
<P>
   I've cringed when my boys described someone as fat, or old, or
crippled. But James Banks, professor of education and the director
of the Cehter for Multicultural Eduction at the University of
Washington, Seattle, who has written extensively about
multiculturalism over the past twenty years, disagrees. He tells
his students that if they don't see that he's black, something's
wrong. ''It's what you do,'' he says, ''with what you see.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Professor Banks, learning to live with diversity is
a 'demographic imperative'. ''We are becoming a nation without a
clear majority.'' The U.S. Department of Labor predicts that by the
year 2000, 1 out of 3 Americans will be a person of color, 83
percent of the new entrants to the workforce will be women and
minorities. 34.9 million people will be age 65 or over. Banks, like
many educators, feels that all children need to know how to deal
with diversity in positive ways.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must reach children at an early age with messages about
understanding, respect, and amity among people,'' says Sandi
Holmes, program specialist with the National Council of Christians
and Jews. ''As schools and institutions begin to change how they
define and describe our society, individuals need to do that too.''
</P>
<P>
   Families can start by discussing their own heritage. That's
important because children need a clear sense of identity in order
to recognize and respect that in others. 'Them' vs. 'us' attitudes
often reflect low self esteem and lack of confidence. ''Everyone
belongs to some kind of group,'' says Sholiton, ''and it's
important to encourage pride in one's own identity, while at the
same time dispelling intolerance through understanding the culture
of others. That's how we can each begin to recognize what we have
in common as human beings.''
</P>
<P>
   Children acquire their judgments from adults and the biased
messages of television, books, and movies. The prejudices they copy
are rooted in fear and misunderstanding. If parents want their
children to develop an appreciation for differences, they should
find ways to expose them to a wide world of people. Challenge
children's stereotypes with information. Include many different
kinds of people among your own friends, read stories that show
different groups in a positive light, sample the foods, festivals
and customs of other cultures .
</P>
<P>
   Robert Coles, a Harvard professor, child psychiatrist, and
author of over 50 books including ''The Moral Life of
Children,''and ''The Spiritual Life of Children,'' urges parents
and educators to share their own experiences of being ostracized
with children and to talk about fear and dislike of otherness.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of us,'' he says, ''have experienced the pain of prejudice
when we are not favored by someone who matters to us. All of us
have been singled out for our differences. And all of us have
dismissed someone or some group as not worthy of our concern and
compassion. Let children know there are always things that make
people different from one another. Prejudice is when we place value
judgements on what we observe.
</P>
<P>
   ''Multiculturalism is not a subject to teach, but something to
be talked about in a natural way. What's needed is not only
cultural literacy but a moral literacy that emphasizes the respect
and kindness we must practice if we're to live together. This a
movement not only of the mind but of the heart.''
</P>
<P>
   When my twin boys were eight years old, I took them to a
heritage festival held each year in our city. Twenty-four different
nationality groups had displays, featuring native products and
handicrafts. It was a delight to watch the kids eat Thai satay and
Greek souvlaki with the same enthusiasm they usually applied to a
hamburger.
</P>
<P>
   They boogied to the beat of African drums, and swayed to the
tunes of a Bohemian brass band. They were at ease in shorts and
T-shirts, wandering among people dressed in saris, turbans, and
kimonos. Although everything was unfamiliar, my boys felt at home.
For them, the new image of America as a mosaic, not a melting pot,
isn't an idea whose merits are still being argued by politicians
and academics. It's a fact. I asked Nathan what he thought about
the event. ''It's good,'' he said. ''It could help stop dis...,
dis..., what's that word for when people are against each other?''
</P>
<P>
   ''Discrimination,'' I replied.
</P>
<P>
   ''It could end that because all these different people get to
show off who they are and all their wonderful things, and we get to
find out that they're people, just like us.''

 &HT;    Why can't I do time-lapse refinishing?
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA, Fla. _ The man on the television was refinishing a
dresser and it was beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make the finish remover do the work,'' he advised. Before my
eyes, old finish floated away from a dresser. The dark, nasty tide
of yellowed varnish and discolored stain receded, revealing the
lush, fine-grain hardwood beneath.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why look at that! Brazilian bonchacudawood. You don't see this
very often because its importation is banned under three
international treaties. That means this piece we picked up for $18
at Repoman's Used Furniture Barn and Mower Repair is probably worth
close to $62,000.
</P>
<P>
   He gently wiped the piece with a towel, collecting finish that
puddled off as though it were nothing more than mud that
unaccountably was tracked on the dresser by mischievous children.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, my project, a $15 headboard, stood sulking in a
corner.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to accept change, it clung tenaciously to an ugly finish
that unconvincingly attempted to tart up the pine beneath it as
some sort of exotic hardwood.
</P>
<P>
   If successful in my project, I would take this $15 piece of wood
and turn it into something you would be glad to pay $25 for. All it
takes is skill, determination and $87 worth of dangerous
petrochemicals, any one of which, if mishandled, could turn my home
into an EPA Superfund site.
</P>
<P>
   ``There!'' he said. ``By letting the remover do the work, all
that's left is some sanding to get out those glass rings and plug
the bullet hole put there by someone who had tried to refinish this
before me.''
</P>
<P>
   The avuncular figured in the work apron began sanding and the
picture faded out to indicate the passage of time.
</P>
<P>
   As an aficionado of home-improvement television, I love
time-lapse photography. Without it, you would have five or six
shows devoted to the fine points of sanding. The host would spend
the half-hour rubbing the furniture, muttering darkly to himself
and revisiting the mistakes he made throughout his life. Sanding
demands inner peace. The finish remover can't always do the work.
</P>
<P>
   Time-lapse photography is what makes home-repair television what
it is _ the only place where projects go smoothly, nobody's clothes
are stained and things don't come to a screeching halt for second
and third trips to the hardware store.
</P>
<P>
   Watching this makes me happy. Particularly when I leave my own
projects behind to painlessly view People Who Know What They're
Doing getting things done neatly.
</P>
<P>
   Nor am I alone. The last time my cable company rearranged its
channels, I discovered vast new areas of television including Home
&AMP; Garden Television, a channel dedicated to all home improvement
all the time. Every time I surfed by it, somebody else on the
screen was neatly doing jobs that would turn most homes upside down
for the better part of a week. A channel of other people
accomplishing things painlessly 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   We live in a wonderful age.
</P>
<P>
   When the program ended, I returned to my labors. I had hoped my
own fade-out from the project might have accomplished something. It
had not.
</P>
<P>
   There are two neat things about furniture refinishing that they
don't tell you about on TV. The first is that no job works
according to plan. You discover wood that is entirely different
from what you thought. The stain turns out to be nothing like the
can label. What was labeled ``Ye Olde Forest Pine'' looks like ``Ye
Olde Stealth Bomber.'' Things happen to alter your plans
dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   Like writing, you just start working and be watchful for what
emerges.
</P>
<P>
   The other cool thing is, unlike any other home improvement,
imperfection works for you. Holes, discoloration, worn spots,
bumps, odd spots of old finish that won't come off ... all give it
character. It's antiquing. I've read about people firing shotguns
at dressers and beating them with chains. It gives them
authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   You can't have enough authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   My headboard now is done. The finish remover didn't do the work
for me. It looks very, very authentic.

 &HT;    As old barns disappear, so do the rich stories that fill them
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ When the lunch bell rang, about half the students
dashed to the cloak room to grab their sack lunches.
</P>
<P>
   The other half rushed for the cafeteria next to our schoolhouse,
a brick building that held grades one-12.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, I ate in the cafeteria. The food was fantastic. My
opinion was shared by no one. At least no one admitted it.
</P>
<P>
   My school's herd mentality held that cafeteria food _ cooked and
served by great country cooks _ was not fit to eat.
</P>
<P>
   Kids with the sack lunches looked down on cafeteria students,
who often felt obligated to complain about food better than many of
them ate at home.
</P>
<P>
   One time, in the fifth grade, three of my friends talked me into
bringing a sack lunch the next day. That decision resulted in a
paddling.
</P>
<P>
   I was reminded of this paddling, which was not my first or last,
when I read a story in the New York Times about the steady
disappearance of old wood barns across America.
</P>
<P>
   The story quoted Iowa farmer John Berdo, whose family has farmed
for seven generations, as observing that ``old barns are as
obsolete as the manual typewriter in the computer age.''
</P>
<P>
   Old wood barns are rapidly being replaced by metal storage
buildings that are bigger, less expensive to build and cost less to
maintain. They also lack the character and style of old wood barns.
</P>
<P>
   Old wood barns also will not hold the huge combines, tractors
and other over-sized equipment that have become mainstays of modern
farming.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that more than half of the nation's wood barns have
been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the cost of repairing old wood barns, which can include
up to $20,000 for a new roof, old barns also are disappearing
because family farms are disappearing.
</P>
<P>
   My fifth-grade friends wanted me to bring a sack lunch one
particular day so we could eat our lunches in the old Lacy barn
about a mile west of the school. A couple of the boys had built a
fort out of hay bales in the barn.
</P>
<P>
   When the lunch bell rang, we grabbed our sacks from the cloak
room and ran for the barn.
</P>
<P>
   The fort was great. It had a tunnel to get inside the fort,
which had hay-bale battlements on top.
</P>
<P>
   The Lacy barn, which we more or less had permission to use as
long as we didn't break any bales, also had a rope hanging from a
block and tackle attached to the roof beam. We could swing from one
side of the barn to the other and drop down inside the fort, just
like Errol Flynn, Douglas Fairbanks, Tarzan or the Three
Musketeers.
</P>
<P>
   We made swords from wood laths and took turns attacking or
defending the fort. Someone finally realized that it may be time to
return to school. No one had a watch, but we reluctantly agreed. We
ran back to school.
</P>
<P>
   To our surprise, we got back only in time for the final school
bell.
</P>
<P>
   Charged with playing hooky, we were marched into the principal's
office where we each were told to empty our back pockets, bend over
and take our punishment.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't much of a paddling. I think the principal also would
have preferred swinging across the Lacy barn and attacking our
hay-bale fort.
</P>
<P>
   Returning from a Colorado vacation a few years ago, I made a
detour to see if my old school house was still standing. It was,
but it was vacant.
</P>
<P>
   The old Lacy barn was gone. In its place was a subdivision
called Lacy Estates.
</P>
<P>
   It's too bad that the old wood barns are disappearing. Metal
storage buildings will never generate as many good memories.

 &HT;    Height hang-ups
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ I come from a long line of short folks.
Grandmother Parker was 4 feet 10, and Granddaddy, before arthritis
bent him over, stood a whopping 5 feet 6. My mother barely made it
to 5 feet, and my father was 5 feet 7. So how did it happen I was
the tallest kid in the first grade (except for Artie Kuminski who
didn't count because he'd been sick and was already 7 going on 8)?
</P>
<P>
   Being tall was really cool because teachers always had neat jobs
for tall kids _ like washing blackboards. The chipped spatterware
basin and raggedy sponge, power symbols of a 6-year-old, were all
mine because even though Artie was taller, he was allergic to chalk
dust.
</P>
<P>
   Once the teacher learned I could be trusted with thumbtacks, she
added bulletin boards to my job specs. Pumpkins in October, elves
in December _ I did it all. Come spring, it was a cardboard
punch-out of purple iris, butter-yellow daffodils, and a pudgy,
crepe-paper bunny with one ear that flopped over. I tried sticking
it back up with a white tack that matched the fur but Ronald Gorsky
copped the tack and put it on Phyllis Hoffstetter's chair and made
her
</P>
<P>
   cry.
</P>
<P>
   In choir, since I was tall, I never had to stand in the front
row, which was important to me because my petticoat always seemed
to be hanging a couple of inches below the hem of my chintz
pinafore and grubby Bobby Kinkaid would break into sing-song: ``I
see London, I see France, I see Lizzie's underpants.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Stupid!'' I yelled just before I slugged him. ``Don't know the
difference between a slip and underpants.''
</P>
<P>
   Once, the gym teacher let me help her string up the volleyball
net, which was a big deal because I was never much good at
athletics. Helping out made me feel special.
</P>
<P>
   I was as ill-coordinated as I was tall, and my two big feet were
my own worst enemies. It seemed like one was always getting in the
way of the other, and as if neither was connected to my brain. When
I ran, my father likened the motion to that of an out-of-control
wind-up toy with an overstressed mainspring.
</P>
<P>
   Mother sadly confessed to her lady friends that her daughter had
the biggest feet she'd ever seen on a woman _ 7AAAA by the time I
was 11. With obvious embarrassment, she would remark to all within
sight of my flippers that no one in her family had big feet (hers
were 3B) so mine must be my father's fault (his were 8AA). I
learned to sit on my feet instead of letting them hang out for
comment _ particularly around the relatives.
</P>
<P>
   But then, sometime before my 12th birthday, an odd thing
happened _ I stopped growing. Suddenly, there were no more hems to
let down or barely scuffed shoes to send to the Salvation Army. My
11-year growth spurt had come to an end and by the time I hit high
school, short guys were asking me out because I didn't tower over
their pompadours when we danced.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, I became the one in the front row of class pictures, and
the one who watched parades between tall folks' armpits. Now I was
the kid who, when the football game got exciting and everybody
jumped up for a better look, was left standing on the seat yelling,
``WHAT HAPPENED?''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years I've learned to accept the fact that at 5 feet 3,
no one is ever going to describe me as ``willowy,'' and that my
feet are no longer considered a regressive trait inherited from the
yeti. But there's still a problem.
</P>
<P>
   What I've been thinking about a lot lately is the probability
that my son Kristofor (6 foot 4 with feet the size of a Nash
Rambler) and his lovely wife Amy (also tall) will one of these days
produce an heir, a veritable Gulliver who will no doubt refer to me
as ``Little Grandmother,'' a designation I shall resent as well as
resemble.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, in an attempt to level the playing field, I've put
the children on notice. Offspring will call me ``Stretch'' or
everybody's out of the will.

 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Deep in the heart of Texas, Hollywood's sweetheart spends her
time sitting on her rickety front porch, with a beer in one hand
and a rawhide bone in the other.
 &HT;    At Sandra Bullock's house in Austin, people read Texas Monthly,
not Variety. They wear tank tops, not beaded gowns. And personal
trainers ... well, don't get her started.
 &HT;    ``When I need any exercise, I just go jump in the lake with my
dogs,'' Bullock says. ``At night I just like to sit outside, drink
a beer and listen to great blues music. For the first time in my
life, I can breathe.''
 &HT;    Oh, she's still a movie star _ her latest, ``Gun Shy,'' opens
nationwide on Feb. 4 _ but the star of ``Speed'' (1994) and ``While
You Were Sleeping'' (1995) is a long way from Tinseltown.
 &HT;    ``When I lived in L.A., right after the success of `Speed,' I
never went out to dinner,'' she says. ``I never saw my friends _ I
was hiding out. I would sit around reading the trades. I was
suddenly worrying about what other people were doing _ I was
operating from a base of fear.
 &HT;    ``I even had road rage,'' she says, laughing. ``My spirit was
being crushed. I had to get out.''
 &HT;    So Bullock beat a retreat, buying a house in Austin and settling
down.
 &HT;    ``I tell you, my new attitude even makes these interviews
easier,'' the actress says during a chat at a Los Angeles hotel,
looking absolutely stunning in a gray, clinging sweater/dress, her
long, straight hair falling loosely on her shoulders and bangs
shading her eyes. ``I woke up this morning and thought, `I have
nothing to lose, nothing to prove.' It made me feel, for the first
time in a long time, free as a bird.''
 &HT;    It was only a year ago that Bullock announced that she'd be
taking an extended break from show business.
 &HT;    ``I felt I was burned out,'' she recalls. ``Dried up. Seriously,
I wanted to concentrate on my family and friends. My heart was very
full with other things _ I felt done with acting, finished.''
 &HT;    Famous last words. When the script for ``Gun Shy,'' a black
comedy about a drug-enforcement agent (Liam Neeson) on the verge of
retirement, arrived at her production office, Bullock couldn't
resist cracking it open. One thing led to another, and suddenly she
was producing the film and co-starring with Andy Lauer, Mitch
Pileggi, Oliver Platt and Dusty Kay.
 &HT;    ``It has always been a dream of mine to be Liam Neeson's arm
candy,'' she says, laughing.
 &HT;    She gets a little more serious in ``28 Days,'' due out in March.
Betty Thomas' drama casts Bullock as a newspaper reporter forced
into rehab by alcoholism.
 &HT;    ``I really intended to take a year off, but these two projects
were just too good,'' Bullock says, laughing. ``I actually did make
it to the eighth month of my time-off plan, which is the longest
break I've had in several years.''
 &HT;    Ever since Bullock drove that big bus in ``Speed'' ( 1994), she
had been working nonstop. And she'd been a big star, despite her
share of clunkers _ ``Two If By Sea'' (1996), ``In Love and War''
(1996) and the disastrous ``Speed 2: Cruise Control'' (1997) _ in
the intervening years.
 &HT;    ``I still find that the strangest part of stardom is going to a
department store to shop for bras,'' she says, giggling. ``You're
in the fitting room, struggling with the straps, and all of a
sudden someone pops their head over the stall and screams, `Sandra
Bullock, I love you!'
 &HT;    ``I'm all naked and tangled, going `Oh, thank you so much for
dropping by.'''
 &HT;    Actually, Bullock says, she's not that upset by her spotty track
record lately _ ``Hope Floats'' (1998) was her only recent hit.
 &HT;    ``Honestly, the best part of the last couple of years has been
the criticism I've gotten, because it's brought things back to a
more normal level,'' the actress says. ``Now it's nice and quiet. I
can go back to scratch and start building things up again. Everyone
is off my back.
 &HT;    ``Honestly, I found it paralyzing _ the good heat that has been
on me for the last few years has been the most frightening thing in
the world,'' Bullock admits. ``This instant fame is just something
I couldn't understand. It wasn't warranted, and it was for all the
wrong reasons _ it was for something that I had no control over.
 &HT;    ``I mean, who knew `Speed' was going to work? It was a movie
about a bus.''
 &HT;    With her fame came intense scrutiny in an industry which rarely
spares its own, especially if they happen to be female.
 &HT;    ``Hollywood loves to pit women up against each other,'' Bullock
says. ``For instance, I just saw a magazine cartoon with Cameron
Diaz literally sitting on top of a squashed Julia Roberts. The
little blurb said, `Cameron has the edge.'''
 &HT;    She frowns.
 &HT;    ``That's so insulting and degrading,'' she says, fuming. ``Here
are two incredibly powerful, beautiful women who are opening films
where they said women couldn't open films. Let's be happy about
that fact, and not pit them against each other.''
 &HT;    It wasn't that long ago that Bullock was in Diaz's spot as ``the
next Julia Roberts.''
 &HT;    ``And how annoying that must have been for her,'' the actress
says. ``Poor Julia. But you'll notice Julia is always on top, which
is a great testament to her. She broke the mold _ that's why she
deserves to sit where she sits.''
 &HT;    Nowadays, Bullock says, she's less interested in duplicating the
$300 million success of ``Speed'' than in gaining control over her
own career. That's why she produced ``Hope Floats,'' ``Practical
Magic'' (1998) and ``Gun Shy.''
 &HT;    ``As an actor,'' she says, ``sometimes you feel like a throw
pillow they toss in the corner as decoration. I want to be the
architect.''
 &HT;    So is the woman many hail as the nicest person in Hollywood
learning to be a bit less nice?
 &HT;    ``Just because you assert yourself doesn't mean you have to stop
being nice,'' she says. ``You don't have to be a bitch to get your
point across. I've said no this year more than I ever have in my
life.''
 &HT;    Which is why, after she's through promoting ``Gun Shy,'' she'll
be heading back to Austin _ where, yes, her ``A Time to Kill''
(1997) co-star Matthew McConaughey happens to live nearby. But
Bullock denies the persistent rumors that they're romantically
involved.
 &HT;    ``Sorry, we're just friends,'' she says cheerfully. ``No major
agenda there.''
 &HT;    In fact, Bullock is rather proud of not having any major agenda
at all.
 &HT;    ``I want to ground myself in the next year,'' she says. ``When I
drive onto my property and see my lake and my dogs running around,
it just boosts my spirits. I finally have a place I can call home
at the end of the day.
 &HT;    ``I feel like I can finally breathe.''

WHAT CHRISTINA AGUILERA WANTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.) 
 (She also has information on how to subscribe to StarBeat, a weekly
package of five intriguing features with color art.) 
 (Includes a color slide of singer Christina Aguilera.) 
 By GARY GRAFF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Her song was called ``Genie in a Bottle,'' but Christina
Aguilera seems to have gotten more than three wishes out of it.
 &HT;    Six months after ``Genie,'' the first single from her debut
album, took the 19-year-old pop singer to pop stardom, she's scored
a second No. 1 hit with ``What a Girl Wants'' and watched her
self-titled album bow atop the Billboard charts, selling more than
5 million copies so far.
 &HT;    An alumna of the same ``Mickey Mouse Club'' class that produced
Britney Spears, two members of 'N Sync and actress Keri Russell,
Aguilera will be part of this year's Walt Disney-produced Super
Bowl halftime extravaganza, dueting with Enrique Iglesias.
 &HT;    Oh, and she's also nabbed two Grammy Award nominations,
including Best New Artist.
 &HT;    ``Oh my gosh, it was so unbelievable,'' Aguilera says. ``I was
the first name after they announced the category, and I was dying.
I was shocked _ I wasn't expecting it at all, just because I'd only
had one single out this year, `Genie in a Bottle,' and I didn't
think that's all it took. So I was really excited.''
 &HT;    A few names later came Spears, Aguilera's friend since their
``Mickey Mouse'' days but nonetheless often portrayed as a rival
princess of the teen-pop scene.
 &HT;    ``I know the press and whatnot have always wanted to make this
sort of rivalry between Britney and I,'' Aguilera says, ``I guess
because of certain similarities. But, come on, we are very
different artists. People will see more and more how different we
are, so maybe that will stop this idea that we're competing with
each other.
 &HT;    ``I'm just so proud of her for making it this far,'' the singer
adds. ``I can honestly say that, because we were really close on
the show, too. I've always known her to be a really sweet girl. And
it's funny, because on the show me and Britney were never compared
with each other, even though we were the youngest on the show.''
 &HT;    Aguilera began performing almost before she could walk. Her
mother recalls a 2-year-old Christina lining up her stuffed
animals, setting out a towel as a stage and belting out songs into
a baton that served as her ``icophone.''
 &HT;    Music, in fact, provided her with a refuge, first from the
family's frequent moves _ her father, an Ecuadoran-American, was an
Army sergeant _ and then from her parents' divorce when she was 5.
 &HT;    ``Singing was always my outlet, my form of release,'' explains
Aguilera, who has a stepbrother, stepsister and half-brother from
her mother's second marriage. ``Maybe it made me feel connected to
myself, even though my surroundings kept changing. I think singing
was something I grasped as an outlet from a lot of times in my
childhood that weren't exactly pleasant.
 &HT;    ``It was hard growing up.''
 &HT;    After the divorce, Aguilera's mother took the future singer and
her sister Rachel, now 13, back to Pittsburgh to be near her
family. There she encouraged her older daughter's singing, exposing
her to singers such as B.B. King and Etta James, whose song ``At
Last'' Aguilera covers in concert.
 &HT;    The young singer lost her first ``Star Search'' competition at
age 8, but her performance got her onto ``The Mickey Mouse Club's''
talent list, and a few years later she was on the show.
 &HT;    That didn't make growing up any easier, however.
 &HT;    ``I was always living a different sort of lifestyle than my
peers, which created certain alienation and whatnot at certain
times,'' she recalls. ``It was weird, just because I was in school
one minute, in math class with my peers, and then they would go
home and see me on television.
 &HT;    ``It would create weird situations for me, a lot of no-win
situations.''
 &HT;    Aguilera remembers friends constantly, half-tauntingly asking
her to sing for them.
 &HT;    ``If I'd break down and finally sing for them, they'd be like,
`Oh, she's showing off again,''' she says. ``And then if I wouldn't
do it, it would be like `She's too good to sing for us.'
 &HT;    ``It was hard,'' the singer says. ``It made me introvert into
myself, into my music. It created this drive that I was going to
prove to myself that I was going to make this dream happen. I put
all my energy and focus into my goal.''
 &HT;    Aguilera lived a relatively normal life throughout high school,
but she was also on the radio with ``Reflection'' from the Disney
film ``Mulan'' (1998), and she had a hit duet in Japan, ``All I
Wanna Do,'' with native pop hero Keizo Nakanishi.
 &HT;    Signed to RCA Records, Aguilera found making her first album all
but overwhelming.
 &HT;    ``I was 17 when I was recording, and it was my first time away
from home, in Los Angeles, up against all these big record-company
heads, people who are 20 years my senior, and it was really tough
sometimes to get my opinions or ideas across,'' Aguilera says. ``I
definitely knew what I wanted, but it was a little tough.''
 &HT;    It's the songs other than the hits on ``Christina Aguilera''
that really show what she's capable of. Torchy ballads such as ``I
Turn to You'' and the album-closing ``Obvious'' _ which Aguilera
says is a particular favorite _ reveal a big, mature voice that
draws as much from the classic singers she grew up listening to as
it does from contemporary favorites such as Whitney Houston or
Mariah Carey.
 &HT;    And while ``Genie'' and ``What a Girl Wants'' are the money
songs right now, Aguilera says the ballads ``really allow me to let
go a lot more. On a slow song, you get to get into it more, you
have more time to take your time with it and really stretch your
notes and whatnot. I think that's when an audience gets to see what
I'm about as a vocalist.''
 &HT;    Of course, Aguilera realizes that some of her fans are less
interested in her voice than in her frequently bared midriff _
which remains svelte, despite her declared love of fast food.
 &HT;    ``Sometimes I'm on stage, belting my heart out through a song,
and all some guys can do in the front row is say `Take it off!'''
Aguilera says, frowning. ``It's like, why do I work so hard to be
the best vocalist I can be when I've got people that really just
stare at my tummy?
 &HT;    ``So it can be a little bit of a disadvantage,'' she says, ``but
I'm also a performer. I'm an entertainer, and when I'm onstage I do
come across as a bit sexual sometimes in the way that I dance, move
my hips or whatever. It's all part of being a performer and an
entertainer to me, and my sexuality is part of that.''
 &HT;    Despite tabloid rumors to the contrary, Aguilera says she's too
busy to date _ though she admits to regular crushes. It seems
plausible, since she's at work on an all-new, Spanish-language
album, as well as a holiday album for release at Christmas 2000.
She has another tour in the works and, yes, a few more typical
teen-age things as well.
 &HT;    ``Right now I'm a teen,'' she says, ``and besides singing I'm
still the same old girl that loves going to the movies and loves
going to shop, loves to go dancing _ you know what I mean?
 &HT;    ``But my artistry is really important to me, too,'' she adds.
``That's why I want to fight a little bit being categorized with a
lot of premanufactured teen acts.
 &HT;    ``I want to make sure that people take it seriously as something
that's not just a come-and-go thing.''

STOP THE `SCREAM'-ING: DAVID ARQUETTE'S FINAL ROUND WITH `SCREAM' 
</HEADLINE>

 (Includes a color slide of David Arquette with Neve Campbell in a
scene from ``Scream 3.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    As far as David Arquette is concerned, the secrecy surrounding
``Scream 3'' was a pain in the ... eyes.
 &HT;    ``I got a script with red stripes down the middle of the pages,
just like everyone else got,'' the actor says. ``It was really hard
to read the script. You had to strain your eyes.''
 &HT;    The red lines were an anti-photocopying measure, only one of
many adopted by the production in the wake of widespread plot leaks
for ``Scream 2'' (1998).
 &HT;    ``It was a little bit of a drag,'' Arquette adds, ``and you
don't know if a `Scream' movie is really important enough to do
that. But they're (reacting to) the situation on `Scream 2,' where
people were trying to get the story off the Internet.
 &HT;    ``They are taking all the precautions they can this time,'' he
says, ``though people will talk about it anyway and try to figure
out what's going to happen before the film comes out. You really
can't stop it.''
 &HT;    Given that this is the third _ and allegedly final _ installment
in the ``Scream'' saga, it's impressive that people are still so
eager to find out what's going to happen in the new film, which
will open on Feb. 4.
 &HT;    Don't expect us to give away much, but it's no secret that
Arquette reprises his role as good guy Deputy Dewey, while
Courteney Cox Arquette _ more on that later _ and Neve Campbell
once again portray ambitious reporter Gale Weathers and luckless
murder magnet Sidney Prescott, respectively. The setting is
Hollywood, on the set of ``Stab 2,'' a sequel to the
movie-within-a-movie of ``Scream 2.''
 &HT;    Arquette, speaking by cellular telephone while driving his car
in Los Angeles, takes a stab at setting up ``Scream 3'' without
giving anything away.
 &HT;    ``You've got a movie within a movie,'' he says. ``In the second
one they made a movie of the first film, and it kind of played on
that. In this one, they take it a step further. A lot of `Scream 3'
takes place behind the scenes of a movie being shot.
 &HT;    ``Parker Posey plays Courteney's character in this one,'' he
adds, ``and Matt Keeslar plays Dewey.''
 &HT;    Getting an alternative take on his own popular character was a
lot of fun, Arquette says.
 &HT;    ``Matt's really funny,'' he says, ``and he's a good actor. It
was neat to see other actors walk around in our old costumes and
basically play our characters.''
 &HT;    Otherwise, Arquette will talk only in generalities.
 &HT;    ``Neve's character is still haunted by the murder of her mother
and also by the first murders,'' he says cautiously. ``It's all
still scary and exciting, and everybody is covered with blood
again.''
 &HT;    Whether Dewey is dead or alive after the final drop of blood is
spilled remains to be seen, but just as the ever-limping character
won Gale's heart in the earlier films, so Arquette walked off with
the girl in real life. Arquette and ``Friends'' star Cox met while
making the first ``Scream'' (1996), and they wed on June 12, 1999.
 &HT;    ``We got married right before we did `Scream 3,' so this is our
first movie as husband and wife,'' the actor says. ``It was great.
We had actually done another movie, `The Shrink Is In,' just before
`Scream 3,' when we were still engaged. So we were actually very
fortunate and got to spend the whole summer together.
 &HT;    ``It's hard to make time for each other in this business,'' he
adds, ``so the fact that we can work together just makes it so much
easier.''
 &HT;    As for marriage itself, count Arquette among the believers.
 &HT;    ``It is everything I ever wished for,'' he says ardently. ``I'm
very honored and respectful of my marriage. Courteney's special, in
her personality, her sense of humor. We have fun together and with
our friends and family _ I'm really happy.''
 &HT;    Only a few years ago, Arquette wasn't so happy. The son of Lewis
Arquette, grandson of Cliff Arquette _ better known as Charlie
Weaver of the old ``Hollywood Squares'' _ and sibling of actors
Patricia, Rosanna and Alexis, he fought through a substance-abuse
problem that nearly destroyed his life and his fledgeling career.
 &HT;    ``Everybody has their learning experiences,'' he says softly.
``You just have to be the best person you can, learn from your
mistakes and not repeat them as you move on with your life.''
 &HT;    Professionally, Arquette has been working steadily since his
film debut in ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' (1992). His subsequent
credits include a mix of major releases and independent features,
among them ``Wild Bill'' (1995), ``Beautiful Girls'' (1996),
``Johns'' (1997), ``Dream with the Fishes'' (1998), ``The
Alarmist'' (1999) and ``Never Been Kissed'' (1999), as well as two
previous ``Scream'' frightfests.
 &HT;    The actor, who on the ``Scream 3'' soundtrack performs a song
with his band Ear2000, will next be seen in the aforementioned
``The Shrink Is In,'' a romantic comedy produced by his wife. She
plays a therapy patient who assumes the identity of her
psychiatrist, then falls for another patient (Arquette).
 &HT;    After ``Shrink'' wrapped and the shrieking stopped on ``Scream
3,'' Arquette headlocked ``Ready to Rumble,'' a road movie in which
he and Scott Caan play obsessive wrestling fans who worship the
talents of The King (Oliver Platt), a dethroned champ. Both
``Shrink'' and ``Rumble'' will be released sometime in 2000.
 &HT;    ``Just working in this town is an accomplishment in and of
itself,'' Arquette says. ``I'm working, so I'm pretty happy with
where my career is right now.
 &HT;    ``I just want to keep doing work I believe in and enjoy.''
 &HT;    Right now there are no other projects on Arquette's dance card.
He's taking some time off, reading scripts and relaxing at home in
Los Angeles with Cox Arquette.
 &HT;    Don't count on his turning up in a ``Scream 4,'' however.
 &HT;    ``We were all happy to do this one, but there was also a feeling
for a lot of us that we're done with it now,'' he says. ``We kind
of wanted to finish this one and put it to rest.
 &HT;    ``If the studio does more `Scream' movies, that's up to them.
But I don't think the rest of us will do them anymore.''

 `ALLY' CAT: THERE'S MORE TO JANE KRAKOWSKI THAN `McBEAL'S' ELAINE

 (Includes a color slide of Jane Krakowski in a scene from ``Ally
McBeal.'')

<TEXT>
<P>
   Even Jane Krakowski finds it hard to believe what's been
happening in her life these days.
</P>
<P>
   Not only has she become one of the most popular attractions on
``Ally McBeal,'' a fan favorite as the snoopy, sex-obsessed
secretary Elaine, but she's recently finished playing Betty Rubble
in ``Viva Rock Vegas,'' the upcoming big-screen prequel to ``The
Flintstones'' (1994).
</P>
<P>
   As if that weren't enough, the Broadway-musical veteran is
heading into the studio to record her first solo album, due out in
May, the same month the film opens. And, best of all, the
30-year-old actress finds herself madly in love.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am always pinching myself,'' Krakowski says. ``I am always
saying, `How the hell did I get here? Whose life am I living?'''
</P>
<P>
   Raised in Parsippany, N.J., just a short bus ride from
Manhattan, Krakowski has been a show-biz pro since she was 15, when
she was cast as precocious T.R. Kendall on the daytime soap
``Search For Tomorrow,'' a role that would earn her two Emmy
nominations
</P>
<P>
   She then set her sights on Broadway, appearing in the hit
musicals ``Starlight Express'' (1984) and ``Grand Hotel'' (1989).
The latter, directed by Tommy Tune, won her rave reviews and a Tony
nomination _ but, after the show closed, no more substantial stage
offers were forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, Krakowski admits, she panicked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a dry spell that lasted several years,'' she recalls,
``and, as a result, I sort of lost my confidence. I'm still
reluctant to fully trust any success that comes my way.''
</P>
<P>
   She's not kidding. Though ``Ally McBeal'' was an instant hit,
Krakowski spent her first two years on the Los Angeles-based show
living the life of a visitor from New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I rented my apartment, my furniture, my car,'' she says. ``I
even rented my television. I had real trouble with the dreaded `C
word' _ commitment. I still do.''
</P>
<P>
   Even now, with the show still drawing big ratings in its third
season, she can't bring herself to buy a house.
</P>
<P>
   ``But at least I'm out of my apartment and renting a house,''
she says with a self-deprecating laugh. ``And I finally own a TV. I
bought one for myself when I turned 30 _ I figured I should give
something back to the institution that's been so good to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I own a car now, too,'' she adds, ``but that's because I
did a promotional spot for Mazda and they gave me one. I am sooo
pathetic!''
</P>
<P>
   She's less afraid of the ``C word,'' too. Two summers ago,
Krakowski fell head-over-heels for London-based lyricist Charles
Hart, whose credits include the Andrew Lloyd Webber musicals
``Phantom of the Opera'' (1986) and ``Aspects of Love'' (1989). The
two have been having a transatlantic love affair ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Krakowski says, she'd first met Hart nearly a decade
earlier, backstage at ``Grand Hotel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He came with my `Starlight Express' director, Trevor Nunn,''
Krakowski recalls. ``Trevor was going on and on about my
performance _ `Oh, well done, dahling! Well done!' And there's this
unbelievably gorgeous man standing behind him, who never said
anything to me. That was Charles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't even look him in the eye because he was so
beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, much to Krakowski's surprise, Hart left a note
at the stage door, asking her out. The two dated for a few weeks,
then he returned to London.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't see each other again until 1998, when Krakowski and
an old friend, actress Camryn Manheim of ``The Practice,''
vacationed together in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Camryn wanted to go to London and I wanted to go to Paris,''
Krakowski recalls, ``so we made a deal that I'd go where she wanted
if she went where I wanted. We hit London first. I called Charles
and invited him to tea and, well, we've been together ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``Camryn and I never got to Paris!''
</P>
<P>
   The actress admits that a long-distance relationship can be
quite a strain: Because of her tight shooting schedule for ``Ally
McBeal,'' Hart usually flies to Los Angeles to spend time with her.
Occasionally they meet halfway, in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss him so much when he's gone,'' she says, ``but it's just
so amazing when we're together that the separations are bearable.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we make it through this commuting period, I think we'll be
able to go the long haul,'' Krakowski adds. ``I adore him. He's
definitely the one.''
</P>
<P>
   If her big-screen debut goes well, that commuting period might
be close to an end. Early buzz says that she steals ``Viva Rock
Vegas'' right out from under the noses of a formidable cast which
includes Mark Addy, the chubby stripper from ``The Full Monty''
(1998), as Fred. Kristen Johnson of ``Third Rock From the Sun''
plays Wilma, with Stephen Baldwin as Barney.
</P>
<P>
   The film, which tells how the Flintstones and the Rubbles first
met and became best friends, also stars Joan Collins and Harvey
Korman as Wilma's parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole experience was so incredible it was surreal,''
Krakowski gushes. ``Harvey is, like, my all-time idol, and Joan
Collins is, like, Joan Collins! We have this dinner-party scene
where we're all together and, between takes, Joan was asking how I
get my eye-liner to do what it does _ and I'm thinking, `Oh, my
God, Joan Collins is asking me for beauty tips? This is sooo
bizarre!'
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still this little kid from Jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosie O'Donnell, who played Betty in the first ``Flintstones''
film, has been very supportive.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she heard I'd been cast,'' Krakowski recalls, ``she sent
a huge bouquet of flowers with a card that said, `From Betty One to
Betty Two, Yabba Dabba Doo!' A week later, she brought me on her
show and gave me pointers.''
</P>
<P>
   No one was available to provide tips on playing her pushy,
calculating alter ego on ``Ally McBeal,'' but Krakowski says she
didn't need much help.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a little of Elaine in everybody, at least in our
fantasies,'' she says. ``I think we all secretly want to be her.
She doesn't edit herself, she doesn't apologize for who she is or
what she does, and she gets away with everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it took a while for ``Ally'' watchers to warm up to
her character.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first year our show was on the air, people would come up
to me on the street and groan, `Oh, we have an Elaine in our
office, too,''' Krakowski says. ``And then they would roll their
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now people come up to me with great pride and say, `I'm the
Elaine in our office!'''
</P>

 (Includes a color slide of Sandra Bullock with Liam Neeson in a
scene from ``Gun Shy.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Deep in the heart of Texas, Hollywood's sweetheart spends her
time sitting on her rickety front porch, with a beer in one hand
and a rawhide bone in the other.
 &HT;    At Sandra Bullock's house in Austin, people read Texas Monthly,
not Variety. They wear tank tops, not beaded gowns. And personal
trainers ... well, don't get her started.
 &HT;    ``When I need any exercise, I just go jump in the lake with my
dogs,'' Bullock says. ``At night I just like to sit outside, drink
a beer and listen to great blues music. For the first time in my
life, I can breathe.''
 &HT;    Oh, she's still a movie star _ her latest, ``Gun Shy,'' opens
nationwide on Feb. 4 _ but the star of ``Speed'' (1994) and ``While
You Were Sleeping'' (1995) is a long way from Tinseltown.
 &HT;    ``When I lived in L.A., right after the success of `Speed,' I
never went out to dinner,'' she says. ``I never saw my friends _ Iwas hiding out. I would sit around reading the trades. I was
suddenly worrying about what other people were doing _ I was
operating from a base of fear.
 &HT;    ``I even had road rage,'' she says, laughing. ``My spirit was
being crushed. I had to get out.''
 &HT;    So Bullock beat a retreat, buying a house in Austin and settling
down.
 &HT;    ``I tell you, my new attitude even makes these interviews
easier,'' the actress says during a chat at a Los Angeles hotel,
looking absolutely stunning in a gray, clinging sweater/dress, her
long, straight hair falling loosely on her shoulders and bangs
shading her eyes. ``I woke up this morning and thought, `I have
nothing to lose, nothing to prove.' It made me feel, for the first
time in a long time, free as a bird.''
 &HT;    It was only a year ago that Bullock announced that she'd be
taking an extended break from show business.
 &HT;    ``I felt I was burned out,'' she recalls. ``Dried up. Seriously,
I wanted to concentrate on my family and friends. My heart was very
full with other things _ I felt done with acting, finished.''
 &HT;    Famous last words. When the script for ``Gun Shy,'' a black
comedy about a drug-enforcement agent (Liam Neeson) on the verge of
retirement, arrived at her production office, Bullock couldn't
resist cracking it open. One thing led to another, and suddenly she
was producing the film and co-starring with Andy Lauer, Mitch
Pileggi, Oliver Platt and Dusty Kay.
 &HT;    ``It has always been a dream of mine to be Liam Neeson's arm
candy,'' she says, laughing.
 &HT;    She gets a little more serious in ``28 Days,'' due out in March.
Betty Thomas' drama casts Bullock as a newspaper reporter forced
into rehab by alcoholism.
 &HT;    ``I really intended to take a year off, but these two projects
were just too good,'' Bullock says, laughing. ``I actually did make
it to the eighth month of my time-off plan, which is the longest
break I've had in several years.''
 &HT;    Ever since Bullock drove that big bus in ``Speed'' ( 1994), she
had been working nonstop. And she'd been a big star, despite her
share of clunkers _ ``Two If By Sea'' (1996), ``In Love and War''
(1996) and the disastrous ``Speed 2: Cruise Control'' (1997) _ in
the intervening years.
 &HT;    ``I still find that the strangest part of stardom is going to a
department store to shop for bras,'' she says, giggling. ``You're
in the fitting room, struggling with the straps, and all of a
sudden someone pops their head over the stall and screams, `Sandra
Bullock, I love you!'
 &HT;    ``I'm all naked and tangled, going `Oh, thank you so much for
dropping by.'''
 &HT;    Actually, Bullock says, she's not that upset by her spotty track
record lately _ ``Hope Floats'' (1998) was her only recent hit.
 &HT;    ``Honestly, the best part of the last couple of years has been
the criticism I've gotten, because it's brought things back to a
more normal level,'' the actress says. ``Now it's nice and quiet. I
can go back to scratch and start building things up again. Everyone
is off my back.
 &HT;    ``Honestly, I found it paralyzing _ the good heat that has been
on me for the last few years has been the most frightening thing in
the world,'' Bullock admits. ``This instant fame is just something
I couldn't understand. It wasn't warranted, and it was for all the
wrong reasons _ it was for something that I had no control over.
 &HT;    ``I mean, who knew `Speed' was going to work? It was a movie
about a bus.''
 &HT;    With her fame came intense scrutiny in an industry which rarely
spares its own, especially if they happen to be female.
 &HT;    ``Hollywood loves to pit women up against each other,'' Bullock
says. ``For instance, I just saw a magazine cartoon with Cameron
Diaz literally sitting on top of a squashed Julia Roberts. The
little blurb said, `Cameron has the edge.'''
 &HT;    She frowns.
 &HT;    ``That's so insulting and degrading,'' she says, fuming. ``Here
are two incredibly powerful, beautiful women who are opening films
where they said women couldn't open films. Let's be happy about
that fact, and not pit them against each other.''
 &HT;    It wasn't that long ago that Bullock was in Diaz's spot as ``the
next Julia Roberts.''
 &HT;    ``And how annoying that must have been for her,'' the actress
says. ``Poor Julia. But you'll notice Julia is always on top, which
is a great testament to her. She broke the mold _ that's why she
deserves to sit where she sits.''
 &HT;    Nowadays, Bullock says, she's less interested in duplicating the
$300 million success of ``Speed'' than in gaining control over her
own career. That's why she produced ``Hope Floats,'' ``Practical
Magic'' (1998) and ``Gun Shy.''
 &HT;    ``As an actor,'' she says, ``sometimes you feel like a throw
pillow they toss in the corner as decoration. I want to be the
architect.''
 &HT;    So is the woman many hail as the nicest person in Hollywood
learning to be a bit less nice?
 &HT;    ``Just because you assert yourself doesn't mean you have to stop
being nice,'' she says. ``You don't have to be a bitch to get your
point across. I've said no this year more than I ever have in my
life.''
 &HT;    Which is why, after she's through promoting ``Gun Shy,'' she'll
be heading back to Austin _ where, yes, her ``A Time to Kill''
(1997) co-star Matthew McConaughey happens to live nearby. But
Bullock denies the persistent rumors that they're romantically
involved.
 &HT;    ``Sorry, we're just friends,'' she says cheerfully. ``No major
agenda there.''
 &HT;    In fact, Bullock is rather proud of not having any major agenda
at all.
 &HT;    ``I want to ground myself in the next year,'' she says. ``When I
drive onto my property and see my lake and my dogs running around,
it just boosts my spirits. I finally have a place I can call home
at the end of the day.
 &HT;    ``I feel like I can finally breathe.''

WHAT CHRISTINA AGUILERA WANTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.)

 (Includes a color slide of singer Christina Aguilera.) 
 By GARY GRAFF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Her song was called ``Genie in a Bottle,'' but Christina
Aguilera seems to have gotten more than three wishes out of it.
 &HT;    Six months after ``Genie,'' the first single from her debut
album, took the 19-year-old pop singer to pop stardom, she's scored
a second No. 1 hit with ``What a Girl Wants'' and watched her
self-titled album bow atop the Billboard charts, selling more than
5 million copies so far.
 &HT;    An alumna of the same ``Mickey Mouse Club'' class that produced
Britney Spears, two members of 'N Sync and actress Keri Russell,
Aguilera will be part of this year's Walt Disney-produced Super
Bowl halftime extravaganza, dueting with Enrique Iglesias.
 &HT;    Oh, and she's also nabbed two Grammy Award nominations,
including Best New Artist.
 &HT;    ``Oh my gosh, it was so unbelievable,'' Aguilera says. ``I was
the first name after they announced the category, and I was dying.
I was shocked _ I wasn't expecting it at all, just because I'd only
had one single out this year, `Genie in a Bottle,' and I didn't
think that's all it took. So I was really excited.''
 &HT;    A few names later came Spears, Aguilera's friend since their
``Mickey Mouse'' days but nonetheless often portrayed as a rival
princess of the teen-pop scene.
 &HT;    ``I know the press and whatnot have always wanted to make this
sort of rivalry between Britney and I,'' Aguilera says, ``I guess
because of certain similarities. But, come on, we are very
different artists. People will see more and more how different we
are, so maybe that will stop this idea that we're competing with
each other.
 &HT;    ``I'm just so proud of her for making it this far,'' the singer
adds. ``I can honestly say that, because we were really close on
the show, too. I've always known her to be a really sweet girl. And
it's funny, because on the show me and Britney were never compared
with each other, even though we were the youngest on the show.''
 &HT;    Aguilera began performing almost before she could walk. Her
mother recalls a 2-year-old Christina lining up her stuffed
animals, setting out a towel as a stage and belting out songs into
a baton that served as her ``icophone.''
 &HT;    Music, in fact, provided her with a refuge, first from the
family's frequent moves _ her father, an Ecuadoran-American, was an
Army sergeant _ and then from her parents' divorce when she was 5.
 &HT;    ``Singing was always my outlet, my form of release,'' explains
Aguilera, who has a stepbrother, stepsister and half-brother from
her mother's second marriage. ``Maybe it made me feel connected to
myself, even though my surroundings kept changing. I think singing
was something I grasped as an outlet from a lot of times in my
childhood that weren't exactly pleasant.
 &HT;    ``It was hard growing up.''
 &HT;    After the divorce, Aguilera's mother took the future singer and
her sister Rachel, now 13, back to Pittsburgh to be near her
family. There she encouraged her older daughter's singing, exposing
her to singers such as B.B. King and Etta James, whose song ``At
Last'' Aguilera covers in concert.
 &HT;    The young singer lost her first ``Star Search'' competition at
age 8, but her performance got her onto ``The Mickey Mouse Club's''
talent list, and a few years later she was on the show.
 &HT;    That didn't make growing up any easier, however.
 &HT;    ``I was always living a different sort of lifestyle than my
peers, which created certain alienation and whatnot at certain
times,'' she recalls. ``It was weird, just because I was in school
one minute, in math class with my peers, and then they would go
home and see me on television.
 &HT;    ``It would create weird situations for me, a lot of no-win
situations.''
 &HT;    Aguilera remembers friends constantly, half-tauntingly asking
her to sing for them.
 &HT;    ``If I'd break down and finally sing for them, they'd be like,
`Oh, she's showing off again,''' she says. ``And then if I wouldn't
do it, it would be like `She's too good to sing for us.'
 &HT;    ``It was hard,'' the singer says. ``It made me introvert into
myself, into my music. It created this drive that I was going to
prove to myself that I was going to make this dream happen. I put
all my energy and focus into my goal.''
 &HT;    Aguilera lived a relatively normal life throughout high school,
but she was also on the radio with ``Reflection'' from the Disney
film ``Mulan'' (1998), and she had a hit duet in Japan, ``All I
Wanna Do,'' with native pop hero Keizo Nakanishi.
 &HT;    Signed to RCA Records, Aguilera found making her first album all
but overwhelming.
 &HT;    ``I was 17 when I was recording, and it was my first time away
from home, in Los Angeles, up against all these big record-company
heads, people who are 20 years my senior, and it was really tough
sometimes to get my opinions or ideas across,'' Aguilera says. ``I
definitely knew what I wanted, but it was a little tough.''
 &HT;    It's the songs other than the hits on ``Christina Aguilera''
that really show what she's capable of. Torchy ballads such as ``I
Turn to You'' and the album-closing ``Obvious'' _ which Aguilera
says is a particular favorite _ reveal a big, mature voice that
draws as much from the classic singers she grew up listening to as
it does from contemporary favorites such as Whitney Houston or
Mariah Carey.
 &HT;    And while ``Genie'' and ``What a Girl Wants'' are the money
songs right now, Aguilera says the ballads ``really allow me to let
go a lot more. On a slow song, you get to get into it more, you
have more time to take your time with it and really stretch your
notes and whatnot. I think that's when an audience gets to see what
I'm about as a vocalist.''
 &HT;    Of course, Aguilera realizes that some of her fans are less
interested in her voice than in her frequently bared midriff _
which remains svelte, despite her declared love of fast food.
 &HT;    ``Sometimes I'm on stage, belting my heart out through a song,
and all some guys can do in the front row is say `Take it off!'''
Aguilera says, frowning. ``It's like, why do I work so hard to be
the best vocalist I can be when I've got people that really just
stare at my tummy?
 &HT;    ``So it can be a little bit of a disadvantage,'' she says, ``but
I'm also a performer. I'm an entertainer, and when I'm onstage I do
come across as a bit sexual sometimes in the way that I dance, move
my hips or whatever. It's all part of being a performer and an
entertainer to me, and my sexuality is part of that.''
 &HT;    Despite tabloid rumors to the contrary, Aguilera says she's too
busy to date _ though she admits to regular crushes. It seems
plausible, since she's at work on an all-new, Spanish-language
album, as well as a holiday album for release at Christmas 2000.
She has another tour in the works and, yes, a few more typical
teen-age things as well.
 &HT;    ``Right now I'm a teen,'' she says, ``and besides singing I'm
still the same old girl that loves going to the movies and loves
going to shop, loves to go dancing _ you know what I mean?
 &HT;    ``But my artistry is really important to me, too,'' she adds.
``That's why I want to fight a little bit being categorized with a
lot of premanufactured teen acts.
 &HT;    ``I want to make sure that people take it seriously as something
that's not just a come-and-go thing.''

STOP THE `SCREAM'-ING: DAVID ARQUETTE'S FINAL ROUND WITH `SCREAM'

 (Includes a color slide of David Arquette with Neve Campbell in a
scene from ``Scream 3.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    As far as David Arquette is concerned, the secrecy surrounding
``Scream 3'' was a pain in the ... eyes.
 &HT;    ``I got a script with red stripes down the middle of the pages,
just like everyone else got,'' the actor says. ``It was really hard
to read the script. You had to strain your eyes.''
 &HT;    The red lines were an anti-photocopying measure, only one of
many adopted by the production in the wake of widespread plot leaks
for ``Scream 2'' (1998).
 &HT;    ``It was a little bit of a drag,'' Arquette adds, ``and you
don't know if a `Scream' movie is really important enough to do
that. But they're (reacting to) the situation on `Scream 2,' where
people were trying to get the story off the Internet.
 &HT;    ``They are taking all the precautions they can this time,'' he
says, ``though people will talk about it anyway and try to figure
out what's going to happen before the film comes out. You really
can't stop it.''
 &HT;    Given that this is the third _ and allegedly final _ installment
in the ``Scream'' saga, it's impressive that people are still so
eager to find out what's going to happen in the new film, which
will open on Feb. 4.
 &HT;    Don't expect us to give away much, but it's no secret that
Arquette reprises his role as good guy Deputy Dewey, while
Courteney Cox Arquette _ more on that later _ and Neve Campbell
once again portray ambitious reporter Gale Weathers and luckless
murder magnet Sidney Prescott, respectively. The setting is
Hollywood, on the set of ``Stab 2,'' a sequel to the
movie-within-a-movie of ``Scream 2.''
 &HT;    Arquette, speaking by cellular telephone while driving his car
in Los Angeles, takes a stab at setting up ``Scream 3'' without
giving anything away.
 &HT;    ``You've got a movie within a movie,'' he says. ``In the second
one they made a movie of the first film, and it kind of played on
that. In this one, they take it a step further. A lot of `Scream 3'
takes place behind the scenes of a movie being shot.
 &HT;    ``Parker Posey plays Courteney's character in this one,'' he
adds, ``and Matt Keeslar plays Dewey.''
 &HT;    Getting an alternative take on his own popular character was a
lot of fun, Arquette says.
 &HT;    ``Matt's really funny,'' he says, ``and he's a good actor. It
was neat to see other actors walk around in our old costumes and
basically play our characters.''
 &HT;    Otherwise, Arquette will talk only in generalities.
 &HT;    ``Neve's character is still haunted by the murder of her mother
and also by the first murders,'' he says cautiously. ``It's all
still scary and exciting, and everybody is covered with blood
again.''
 &HT;    Whether Dewey is dead or alive after the final drop of blood is
spilled remains to be seen, but just as the ever-limping character
won Gale's heart in the earlier films, so Arquette walked off with
the girl in real life. Arquette and ``Friends'' star Cox met while
making the first ``Scream'' (1996), and they wed on June 12, 1999.
 &HT;    ``We got married right before we did `Scream 3,' so this is our
first movie as husband and wife,'' the actor says. ``It was great.
We had actually done another movie, `The Shrink Is In,' just before
`Scream 3,' when we were still engaged. So we were actually very
fortunate and got to spend the whole summer together.
 &HT;    ``It's hard to make time for each other in this business,'' he
adds, ``so the fact that we can work together just makes it so much
easier.''
 &HT;    As for marriage itself, count Arquette among the believers.
 &HT;    ``It is everything I ever wished for,'' he says ardently. ``I'm
very honored and respectful of my marriage. Courteney's special, in
her personality, her sense of humor. We have fun together and with
our friends and family _ I'm really happy.''
 &HT;    Only a few years ago, Arquette wasn't so happy. The son of Lewis
Arquette, grandson of Cliff Arquette _ better known as Charlie
Weaver of the old ``Hollywood Squares'' _ and sibling of actors
Patricia, Rosanna and Alexis, he fought through a substance-abuse
problem that nearly destroyed his life and his fledgeling career.
 &HT;    ``Everybody has their learning experiences,'' he says softly.
``You just have to be the best person you can, learn from your
mistakes and not repeat them as you move on with your life.''
 &HT;    Professionally, Arquette has been working steadily since his
film debut in ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' (1992). His subsequent
credits include a mix of major releases and independent features,
among them ``Wild Bill'' (1995), ``Beautiful Girls'' (1996),
``Johns'' (1997), ``Dream with the Fishes'' (1998), ``The
Alarmist'' (1999) and ``Never Been Kissed'' (1999), as well as two
previous ``Scream'' frightfests.
 &HT;    The actor, who on the ``Scream 3'' soundtrack performs a song
with his band Ear2000, will next be seen in the aforementioned
``The Shrink Is In,'' a romantic comedy produced by his wife. She
plays a therapy patient who assumes the identity of her
psychiatrist, then falls for another patient (Arquette).
 &HT;    After ``Shrink'' wrapped and the shrieking stopped on ``Scream
3,'' Arquette headlocked ``Ready to Rumble,'' a road movie in which
he and Scott Caan play obsessive wrestling fans who worship the
talents of The King (Oliver Platt), a dethroned champ. Both
``Shrink'' and ``Rumble'' will be released sometime in 2000.
 &HT;    ``Just working in this town is an accomplishment in and of
itself,'' Arquette says. ``I'm working, so I'm pretty happy with
where my career is right now.
 &HT;    ``I just want to keep doing work I believe in and enjoy.''
 &HT;    Right now there are no other projects on Arquette's dance card.
He's taking some time off, reading scripts and relaxing at home in
Los Angeles with Cox Arquette.
 &HT;    Don't count on his turning up in a ``Scream 4,'' however.
 &HT;    ``We were all happy to do this one, but there was also a feeling
for a lot of us that we're done with it now,'' he says. ``We kind
of wanted to finish this one and put it to rest.
 &HT;    ``If the studio does more `Scream' movies, that's up to them.
But I don't think the rest of us will do them anymore.''

 `ALLY' CAT: THERE'S MORE TO JANE KRAKOWSKI THAN `McBEAL'S' ELAINE  
 (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not

DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.)

 (Includes a color slide of Jane Krakowski in a scene from ``Ally
McBeal.'') 
 By MICHAEL LOGAN  
 c.2000 TV Guide Canada  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even Jane Krakowski finds it hard to believe what's been
happening in her life these days.
</P>
<P>
   Not only has she become one of the most popular attractions on
``Ally McBeal,'' a fan favorite as the snoopy, sex-obsessed
secretary Elaine, but she's recently finished playing Betty Rubble
in ``Viva Rock Vegas,'' the upcoming big-screen prequel to ``The
Flintstones'' (1994).
</P>
<P>
   As if that weren't enough, the Broadway-musical veteran is
heading into the studio to record her first solo album, due out in
May, the same month the film opens. And, best of all, the
30-year-old actress finds herself madly in love.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am always pinching myself,'' Krakowski says. ``I am always
saying, `How the hell did I get here? Whose life am I living?'''
</P>
<P>
   Raised in Parsippany, N.J., just a short bus ride from
Manhattan, Krakowski has been a show-biz pro since she was 15, when
she was cast as precocious T.R. Kendall on the daytime soap
``Search For Tomorrow,'' a role that would earn her two Emmy
nominations
</P>
<P>
   She then set her sights on Broadway, appearing in the hit
musicals ``Starlight Express'' (1984) and ``Grand Hotel'' (1989).
The latter, directed by Tommy Tune, won her rave reviews and a Tony
nomination _ but, after the show closed, no more substantial stage
offers were forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, Krakowski admits, she panicked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a dry spell that lasted several years,'' she recalls,
``and, as a result, I sort of lost my confidence. I'm still
reluctant to fully trust any success that comes my way.''
</P>
<P>
   She's not kidding. Though ``Ally McBeal'' was an instant hit,
Krakowski spent her first two years on the Los Angeles-based show
living the life of a visitor from New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I rented my apartment, my furniture, my car,'' she says. ``I
even rented my television. I had real trouble with the dreaded `C
word' _ commitment. I still do.''
</P>
<P>
   Even now, with the show still drawing big ratings in its third
season, she can't bring herself to buy a house.
</P>
<P>
   ``But at least I'm out of my apartment and renting a house,''
she says with a self-deprecating laugh. ``And I finally own a TV. I
bought one for myself when I turned 30 _ I figured I should give
something back to the institution that's been so good to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I own a car now, too,'' she adds, ``but that's because I
did a promotional spot for Mazda and they gave me one. I am sooo
pathetic!''
</P>
<P>
   She's less afraid of the ``C word,'' too. Two summers ago,
Krakowski fell head-over-heels for London-based lyricist Charles
Hart, whose credits include the Andrew Lloyd Webber musicals
``Phantom of the Opera'' (1986) and ``Aspects of Love'' (1989). The
two have been having a transatlantic love affair ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Krakowski says, she'd first met Hart nearly a decade
earlier, backstage at ``Grand Hotel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He came with my `Starlight Express' director, Trevor Nunn,''
Krakowski recalls. ``Trevor was going on and on about my
performance _ `Oh, well done, dahling! Well done!' And there's this
unbelievably gorgeous man standing behind him, who never said
anything to me. That was Charles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't even look him in the eye because he was so
beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, much to Krakowski's surprise, Hart left a note
at the stage door, asking her out. The two dated for a few weeks,
then he returned to London.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't see each other again until 1998, when Krakowski and
an old friend, actress Camryn Manheim of ``The Practice,''
vacationed together in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Camryn wanted to go to London and I wanted to go to Paris,''
Krakowski recalls, ``so we made a deal that I'd go where she wanted
if she went where I wanted. We hit London first. I called Charles
and invited him to tea and, well, we've been together ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``Camryn and I never got to Paris!''
</P>
<P>
   The actress admits that a long-distance relationship can be
quite a strain: Because of her tight shooting schedule for ``Ally
McBeal,'' Hart usually flies to Los Angeles to spend time with her.
Occasionally they meet halfway, in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss him so much when he's gone,'' she says, ``but it's just
so amazing when we're together that the separations are bearable.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we make it through this commuting period, I think we'll be
able to go the long haul,'' Krakowski adds. ``I adore him. He's
definitely the one.''
</P>
<P>
   If her big-screen debut goes well, that commuting period might
be close to an end. Early buzz says that she steals ``Viva Rock
Vegas'' right out from under the noses of a formidable cast which
includes Mark Addy, the chubby stripper from ``The Full Monty''
(1998), as Fred. Kristen Johnson of ``Third Rock From the Sun''
plays Wilma, with Stephen Baldwin as Barney.
</P>
<P>
   The film, which tells how the Flintstones and the Rubbles first
met and became best friends, also stars Joan Collins and Harvey
Korman as Wilma's parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole experience was so incredible it was surreal,''
Krakowski gushes. ``Harvey is, like, my all-time idol, and Joan
Collins is, like, Joan Collins! We have this dinner-party scene
where we're all together and, between takes, Joan was asking how I
get my eye-liner to do what it does _ and I'm thinking, `Oh, my
God, Joan Collins is asking me for beauty tips? This is sooo
bizarre!'
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still this little kid from Jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosie O'Donnell, who played Betty in the first ``Flintstones''
film, has been very supportive.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she heard I'd been cast,'' Krakowski recalls, ``she sent
a huge bouquet of flowers with a card that said, `From Betty One to
Betty Two, Yabba Dabba Doo!' A week later, she brought me on her
show and gave me pointers.''
</P>
<P>
   No one was available to provide tips on playing her pushy,
calculating alter ego on ``Ally McBeal,'' but Krakowski says she
didn't need much help.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a little of Elaine in everybody, at least in our
fantasies,'' she says. ``I think we all secretly want to be her.
She doesn't edit herself, she doesn't apologize for who she is or
what she does, and she gets away with everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it took a while for ``Ally'' watchers to warm up to
her character.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first year our show was on the air, people would come up
to me on the street and groan, `Oh, we have an Elaine in our
office, too,''' Krakowski says. ``And then they would roll their
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now people come up to me with great pride and say, `I'm the
Elaine in our office!'''
</P>

 &HT;    The closer you look, the better it getsBy Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If the holidays came and went and you still don't have
a DVD player, drop in on a friend and check one out. DVD was one of
the two hottest gift items, and it's time to find out why.
</P>
<P>
   Like the other big gift item, the digital camera, DVD takes on a
favorite pastime, movie watching, and adds so many dimensions that
it creates a fresh, new excitement.
</P>
<P>
   It provides video pictures of unmatched sharpness and detail and
a stream of sound that extends the viewing experience, making even
familiar films worth a new look.
</P>
<P>
   It lets you do a lot of little things like stop the movie and
analyze scenes, see extra footage and watch the director discuss
the movie in some instances. It offers many other extras impossible
with cumbersome videotapes.
</P>
<P>
   But what really sells DVD is this: The videos look and sound
gorgeous.
</P>
<P>
   I was aware of those features just from reading about them and
sneaking a peek into the sound rooms at my local HiFi Buys, but my
personal, hands-on experience revealed some surprises, too. I
discovered that even regular audio CDs sound better on the DVD
player _ so much better that I pulled my CD player and stored it in
the bedroom, where I may put up a small music system. I now play
DVD and CD on the same machine, such as my Toshiba SD-3109, which
has two separate disc trays. A nice net gain.
</P>
<P>
   Even better news is that if you have a reasonably up-to-date
sound system and a TV in the 30-inch range, you can step up to the
DVD experience at moderate cost.
</P>
<P>
   The players range from about $200 to about $800, with very good
machines in the middle at about $400, the cost of the Toshiba 3109
that I bought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Higher-priced machines do have noticeably higher quality, in
even better pictures and sound, better mechanical operation, and
storage of discs,'' said Michael Brough, a specialist at a HiFi
Buys store.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the machines such as the Sony DVP-CX850D, which sells
for $799 at HiFi Buys, actually store and organize up to 200 discs,
an entire library at your fingertips, Brough said.
</P>
<P>
   The Sony, like some others, will display on the TV screen the
whole library of discs, organized in ways to be located easily and
played at will.
</P>
<P>
   But even on the lower end, where I live, there is a very clear
difference in performance when compared with videotapes played on
the same audio and TV equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The noticeably superior CD playback was a tipoff as to why DVDs
perform so well. The DVD player, with its new electronics, does
more with the information from the disc, and the super supply of
extra information on the latest DVDs provides the amplifier and TV
with a torrent of picture and sound.
</P>
<P>
   While many people try to sell DVD superiority with the
excitement of movies featuring careening trains and fiery
explosions, it turns out that even the subtle sounds of crickets in
the night, the rustle of silk and the fine voice quality also add
pleasure and dimension to ordinary movies.
</P>
<P>
   Also for devoted listeners, the thrill of the audio is in the
way small things are highlighted, contributing to a sense of
presence _ like the swish of the brush against the jazz player's
cymbals, the eloquence of the tiny piccolo against the full voice
of the 100-piece orchestra and even the whir of a fan in the
corner.
</P>
<P>
   The good news on this front is that the choice of DVD movies is
no longer limited, as it was in 1996 when the medium was brand new.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Freeman, Atlanta regional media manager of Best Buy, says
his local outlets have found DVD discs to be among the hottest
items, with floor space constantly expanding for discs and
shrinking for videotapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect to have an inventory of 3,000 titles by the end of
this year,'' he said, ``and even though action movies have been our
best sellers, the appearance of Disney animation titles has
practically moved the focus from the home theater to the family
room.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the DVD player, the best quality of performance
depends on a good amplifier and the proper array of speakers.
</P>
<P>
   With DVD playback in Dolby digital, it is very important to have
a quality center speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``The center speaker, for most movies and audio CDs, presents
the voices, and without it there is a definite gap or hole in the
sound,'' said Brough of HiFi Buys.
</P>
<P>
   Read the label describing the features on the DVD player. One
desirable feature is the ability of the DVD to produce a Dolby
digital signal, especially if the amplifier is an older model
without its own Dolby decoder.
</P>
<P>
   With Dolby, the sound can come from up to six speakers,
including the center, two main front speakers, two rear speakers
and a powered subwoofer that gives the richness our ears have
become accustomed to.
</P>
<P>
   On the TV front, most people prefer the biggest screen they can
afford, often the projection TVs in the 50- to 60-inch range.
</P>
<P>
   Other DVD fans, like Freeman, lean toward the tube TVs, though
smaller at a maximum of 36 inches.
</P>
<P>
   The brightness and clarity of the tube machine more than make up
for the smaller size.
</P>
<P>
   With the push to reduce the inventory of analog TV sets and
replace them with inventories of digital TV sets, sales on
projection TVs now have them available in the $1,500-$2,000 range,
with tube sets at $800.
</P>
<P>
   DVD titles come in various formats, among the most popular being
the letter box or wide-screen format, which to some eyes looks
better on a big screen.
</P>
<P>
   For fans who dote on the technical aspects of video, and
especially DVD, there is plenty of material on the Internet to
slake your appetite.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most helpful is www
</P>
<P>
   .dvddemystified.com, which carries 100 pages of frequently asked
questions and answers about DVD, its technical history and other
details for beginners and veterans.

 &HT;    A smart way to target women
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you believe what you see on television, even the
most technophobic women have made peace with the Internet thanks to
a site called iVillage.com.
</P>
<P>
   A slew of TV commercials for the woman-oriented Web site feature
ordinary women telling heartwarming tales of how, thanks to
iVillage.com, they got advice about nutrition or learned about
computers or what to expect when they were expecting.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, no Web site is going to solve all your work, family,
money and relationship problems, but the site's mix of articles,
community topics and shopping tips really is a good way for women
to get started on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The woman-only Web site is one of a growing handful that
honestly pay attention to what their readers are doing and
thinking, as rival Web site Oxygen put it in its ``smart talk for
smart women.'' Borrowing a page from Web magazine Salon, this new
generation of women's Web sites knows the women and teen-age girls
who visit their sites have IQs above room temperature. They also
know how to involve their readers, and that's an exciting and
welcome change from many content sites on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   IVillage.com is a mix of the conventional and the offbeat, with
a something-for-everyone approach that will probably bring a
variety of women to the site, just as the ads say.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it's predictable, other times surprising. Tuesday
night's online chat with Hillary Rodham Clinton was a definite
coup, but iVillage really shines when it offers readers a chance to
comment on what they've read or voice their own opinions.
</P>
<P>
   The company began life on America Online, a place where talking
back and voicing opinions has always been an integral part of the
user experience. Clicking on iVillage's compilation of the 100
greatest books, the reader has no idea whether to expect a litany
of gothic novels or cookbooks. Happily, it's neither.
</P>
<P>
   Topping the list is ``Gone With the Wind,'' followed by ``To
Kill a Mockingbird,'' ``A Prayer for Owen Meany'' and ``Atlas
Shrugged.'' The book list is cleverly linked to Amazon.com and
peppered with member comments about the books and how a novel has
influenced a particular reader.
</P>
<P>
   To get the most out of iVillage, go beyond the start page with
its run-of-the-mill tips on romance, kids and money and check out
the book club, careers and election 2000. For women who want to
sample what the Web has to offer without straying too far away from
the community and structure of AOL, this is a good place to start.
</P>
<P>
   While iVillage has been around for a while, Oxygen
(www.oxygen.com) is a fairly new site from a powerful collection of
women executives, the most notable being Oprah Winfrey.
</P>
<P>
   Oxygen, which will also be a cable TV channel, combines the
traditional modes of online interactivity, such as chat and message
boards, with multimedia applications, such as video storytelling.
When users click on a story, a second browser window pops up and
the story is told through streaming video, a cutting-edge technique
not found on many Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Oxygen's users will probably be frustrated with the time
it takes for these ``video articles'' to load, but most of the
stories are worth the wait. It is a sign of the eventual merger of
TV and Internet technology that users are likely to see in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   If iVillage suffers a little from being too mainstream aiming
squarely at Mrs. America _ Oxygen scores points for targeting women
of all ages and offering a more offbeat selection of subjects.
Mothers who think and their daughters will appreciate Oxygen's mix
of articles and attitude. Users aren't just asked to post comments
but to submit whole stories on a variety of subjects. For example,
it incorporated the ``Girls On'' Web site into its ``family'' of
sites. ``Girls On'' lets teen-agers offer their own opinions on
film, movies, TV, books and a variety of other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Oxygen's reader contributions and iVillage's member comments
feel similar to the way women talk to each other face-to-face. Some
comments are thoughtful and witty, others are just silly, but their
authors all use the interactive medium of the Web to express their
ideas for an audience of peers.
</P>
<P>
   Both of these sites have a long way to go before they build the
reputations earned by sites like Salon and Slate, but those two
publications could take a lesson from the myriad opportunities
Oxygen and iVillage offer for reader input. They both make good use
of content and community that's missing in a lot of online
publications, especially those aimed at women. Online women's
magazines are a different kind of medium designed for a different
kind of woman _ one who likes to talk and not be talked down to.

 &HT;    Friendly skies get annoying with oversized carry-ons
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ You are on a plane, carrying a small bag.
Overhead compartment after overhead compartment is filled with one
humongous carry-on bag after another. After a fruitless search, you
cram your bag under the seat and have a miserable, cramped flight.
Technology has come to the luggage market and has made the carry-on
bag the most annoying thing flying the friendly skies. In recent
years, carry-on bags have become more than carriers of magazines
and toothbrushes; they are now lumbering, canvas Winnebagos on
wheels, craftily designed to fit into the overhead bin exactly. Not
only that, they crowd aisles, slow down boarding and deplaning and
they make a heckuva bump on the noggin when they shift during
flight. While we know we can't outlaw them, we can at least make
them the annoying gadget of the week.

 &HT;    Chat rooms with firepower
 &HT;    By Joe Stafford
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ After the massacre in Littleton last year,
investigators discovered that the two killers loved Doom, the
granddaddy of frenetic, kill-everything computer games. Often
played online, these are the games for which blood-spattered terms
such as fragfest and gibs were invented to describe the carnage.
Calls rang out to ban them, to stop the spread of the virtual
ultra-violence.
</P>
<P>
   But some experts think that type of game play is a dead end
anyway _ more and more spectacular environments in which to kill
and kill again, yawn _ and that the real future of online game play
is toward more complex social worlds that emphasize teamwork and
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   I've played computer games for years, but I wanted to test that
theory from the inside, to enter these strange realms, these
fabulously realistic 3-D worlds, to play the games, meet the
players virtual-face to virtual-face, to dodge the flying shrapnel
and the acid arrows, to ask the questions and to coyly turn down
the sexual propositions.
</P>
<P>
   Did I mention these are strange realms?
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the Holodeck, the brave new world, the chat room with
firepower. Where the future lies. Where the $10 monthly fees on
credit cards lie. Where your dreams and nightmares all come true,
but, more than anything, where you meet people, make friends and,
oh, yeah, kill them.
</P>
<P>
   None of these virtual worlds is a place I'd want my 8-year-old
daughter to venture. Everyone is a stranger, everyone is in
disguise, represented by a fantasy figure of their own choosing,
from futuristic missile-launching soldier to troll. These are
high-powered masquerades where anything can happen, with anonymity
fueling the worst in some people. Especially in first-person
shooters, played on unregulated private servers where anything
goes, the conversation can get primitive really fast.
</P>
<P>
   How would you explain how it works to an 8-year-old girl,
anyway? Well, it's like this. First you buy the game, choosing from
a huge variety of titles such as Warcraft, Rainbow Six, Quake,
Unreal, Tribes. You get the game home, remove the shrink wrap from
the CD, follow the directions and install the game on your
computer's hard drive. Then, hooked up via modem, you connect to a
distant computer over the Internet, sometimes for free, sometimes
for a small monthly fee. Other players connect to the same computer
and together you enter the game and interact in real-time.
</P>
<P>
   In the world of the first-person shooters, you see through the
eyes of your character. In other realms you see over your
character's shoulder, or from above at an angle. You meet others,
you play together, you chat.
</P>
<P>
   But in the frenetic butcher halls of games like Quake and
Unreal, it's hard to talk to anyone. People hop into these worlds
from their work computers, often, from all around the globe, to
jump around and blast away for 20 minutes, to get a quick fix. Just
try to chat with them:
</P>
<P>
   ``Pardon me!'' I type.
</P>
<P>
   SPLAT! I'm dead, pulverized by a rocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to ask ...'' I type after respawning, or coming back
to life.
</P>
<P>
   POW! Dead again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, forget it ...'' I type.
</P>
<P>
   SPLAP! Dead.
</P>
<P>
   Hmm. That didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   WHAP!
</P>
<P>
   Thank goodness there are other, less angry worlds.
</P>
<P>
   I knew I wasn't in Kansas anymore when I logged onto Everquest,
Sony's massively multiplayer online role-playing game (known by the
easy-off-the-tongue MMORPG) and found myself running through a
dripping-wet rainforest as a huge ogre, hunting frogs with dozens
of other trolls and ogres uttering phrases like ``Blorg kill frog
dead.''
</P>
<P>
   The people playing these games are adult-ish, computer-wise
modern people and yet here they're bounding through pretend forests
using pretend clubs to kill pretend frogs. I bounce up to an ogre,
a mean-faced thing dressed in skins, wagging a club. I type the
message: ``Beg pardon, I'm a reporter for a newspaper and I wanted
to ask you a couple questions about online gaming.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Og no talk now. Og kill stuff,'' he types in return. Og
shuffles off into the gloom. Hmm. That didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, though, you do make friends and meet people who
aren't too busy killing stuff to chat.
</P>
<P>
   THE FUTURE OF ONLINE GAMING
</P>
<P>
   Back in the real world, one expert says games that emphasize the
greatest strength of the Internet _ communication _ are where the
future lies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really a surprise that shooters became as important as
they are, because they are definitely anti-social,'' says Greg
Costikyan, author of ``The Future of Online Gaming.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're returning to what online games were 10 years
ago,'' he says, referring to text-based games _ MUDs or Multiple
User Dungeons _ popularized on college campuses in the late '80s.
``The ability to play online gives you an intelligent opponent,
which is always better than artificial intelligence, and it gives
you contacts. You can talk to people.''
</P>
<P>
   There is solid evidence of a shift. Austin's own Origin Systems
is a case in point. In July, the company, a subsidiary of the
California gaming giant Electronic Arts, set off a storm of
disappointed protests from fans when it dropped its A-10 Warthog
flight simulator and announced plans to devote all its efforts to
online gaming.
</P>
<P>
   Origin pioneered the multiplayer genre with Ultima Online, in
which approximately 150,000 subscribers populate a dragon-infested
magical world. The company plans to add much more social structure
to its new version of the game, UO2, due out this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've learned a lot about online entertainment over the past
two years since we launched Ultima Online,'' said Jeff Anderson,
executive producer for UO2. ``But most important, we've learned
that we are not just making games anymore. We're building virtual
worlds that will offer new ways for people to interact and
socialize.''
</P>
<P>
   Another example of the trend is hinted at in the
much-anticipated Team Fortress 2: Brotherhood of Arms, due out this
year from Valve, the makers of the hit shooter Half-Life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about deathmatch with better graphics,'' game
producer Gabe Newell says in the January issue of the gaming
magazine Incite. ``It's about really thinking about what groups of
friends are going to enjoy doing together.'' Team Fortress 2 will
force players to work as a close-knit team to defeat enemies in a
war zone and will include a built-in voice communication system _ a
first.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies are moving in a similar direction. Microsoft
released its own MMORPG, Asheron's Call, to good reviews in time
for Christmas and plans an outer-space-style massive player game
soon, both leaning heavily on the social aspect of the experience.
In Asheron's Call, players spend half their time standing around
chatting, planning trips into the large 3-D world and exchanging
virtual equipment.
</P>
<P>
   MEET MY PATRON, THE WARRIOR ANGMAR
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps my most revealing experience was in befriending Angmar,
a warrior who dwells in the world of Asheron's Call.
</P>
<P>
   The game calls for pledges of loyalty to other players, and I
picked Angmar more or less at random. My only stipulation was that
I wanted someone who was online a lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``How often do you play this game?'' I typed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enough that it's hurting my GPA,'' he typed back.
</P>
<P>
   Good enough for me. Figuring he was a college kid, I vowed
loyalty and he gave me some nifty equipment and advice and we
hunted several strange species of creatures together. Only later
did I find out he lives in Austin. And goes to Westwood High
School. And is 15 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly I felt very old. ``I had the impression you were
older,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the equal anonymity of the Internet,'' Angmar said.
``Age really doesn't matter online.''
</P>
<P>
   For those seeking proof that online games are about more than
just killing, Angmar is a good case. In real life his name is Alex
Dodwell, a sophomore who plays cello in the orchestra, competes in
soccer and is on the debate team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talking is the main reason to play games online,'' he said.
``Even while you're killing monsters, you're still chatting. It has
all the allure of a chat room but you get to play a fun game at the
same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Angmar hasn't been online as much lately since his dad put his
foot down. ``I'm pretty embarrassed to say it does occupy a lot of
my time,'' Alex said, ``but it doesn't really cut into my studies
too bad. I spend probably two or three hours a night online.''
</P>
<P>
   The upside of Angmar's _ Alex's _ interest in computers is that
he has become something of an expert with them, building computers
from scratch and even considering a high-tech career someday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been able to swim elbow-deep in my computer,'' he
said. ``My mom and dad are always asking me to fix things on
theirs. So my interest in computers might result in a career. It
helps my typing skills, if nothing else.''
</P>
<P>
   THE LATE SHOW GETS A LITTLE BLUE
</P>
<P>
   A big part of the fun is choosing how you'll appear to others.
Even the shooters let you choose from dozens of options. Cyborg?
Bodacious, gun-toting cyberbabe? Cigar-chomping drill sergeant?
</P>
<P>
   And maybe it's the testosterone of the game designers or the
players or both, but these worlds almost universally feature
characters who are pumped up, steroidal and sexy in a freakish way.
In the fragfest games the men bulge with muscles that make
Schwarzenegger look like Olive Oyl and the women are cut-looking
with gleaming metal bustiers.
</P>
<P>
   Playing as a male woodland elf one night in Everquest I was
propositioned by a female woodland elf, a really good-looking
blonde.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make a sign if your interested,'' the good-looking elf thing
typed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interested in what?'' I typed back.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' the elf thing said. ``Doing things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Things?'' I typed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Together. Anything you want,'' the elf thing said. ``I'll do
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure what you mean,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   Exasperated, I guess, the good-looking elf thing ran away into
the gloom.
</P>
<P>
   It's just as well. As my friend Angmar later said, ``It was
probably a 40-year-old pot-bellied guy sitting at his keyboard in
his underwear.''
</P>
<P>
   THIS IS YOUR LIFE
</P>
<P>
   As these encounters hint, for some people, the games are much
more than games. They're more like an alternative life or even a
second job. And, anecdotally at least, they're filled mostly with
males. In point of fact, the games are so male-dominated that
female players have a tough time convincing others that they're not
``role-playing'' a woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had someone ask me this weekend if I was really female,''
said Debbie Johnson of Tulsa, Okla., who plays a war magician, Lia
of Leafcull, in Asheron's Call. ``I replied yes, and then he asked
what age. When I replied `Over 40,' he said, `Yeah, sure, I bet.'''
</P>
<P>
   A Web site administrator for Avis Rent-a-Car, married 25 years
with no kids, Lia/Debbie started playing these kinds of games two
years ago and has since persuaded her 70-year-old dad to join her
online.
</P>
<P>
   Another female player for whom online gaming is a family affair
_ of another kind _ is Judy Winget of Cincinnati, who also plays
Asheron's Call. She's 41, a mother of two young children, a
professional business analyst who spends her free time as Reiki
Anzho, the magical monarch of The Mystic Order of Blackthorn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been through a divorce because my ex found `the love of
hs life' playing (the online game) Yserbius,'' she said, citing
what is apparently not an uncommon occurrence in the these worlds.
``Though he's still single three-and- a-half years after the
divorce,'' Reiki/Judy added.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the separation, I met a wonderful man playing (online
games) and we've since married,'' she said. Now the two of them
play online together, often meeting in the virtual world.
</P>
<P>
   For Reiki/Judy, the games are as much about conversation as
about hunting and adventuring.
</P>
<P>
   ``The upshot is, yes, I play because of the social
interaction,'' Judy/Reiki said. ``If I had to do it alone and had
no friends to share the joy with, what would be the point?''
</P>
<P>
   VIRTUAL GAMES, REAL-LIFE MONEY
</P>
<P>
   But for some people the games are, partly at least, about making
money.
</P>
<P>
   Though not officially sanctioned by the game makers, the selling
of items and characters from the persistent worlds such as Ultima,
Asheron and Everquest has become common on Internet auction sites
such as eBay.
</P>
<P>
   For Terry King, 30, who has played Ultima Online since the
beginning two years ago, this phenomenon translates into more than
pocket change. The five-year Dell employee spends 35 hours a week
in the fantasy world, generally playing Red Alkeistarte, an evil
lord who can summon giant demons to his defense. Terry creates
virtual characters and buildings he can sell in the real world.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, he recently sold his virtual castle from the
Ultima realm at an online auction site for some $3,000 cash money
and sold a tower for $1,500 and a couple of houses for about $500
each. These bits of virtual real estate give a character great
prestige and take months or years of steady playing to build.
Terry/Red said he also makes an extra $200 a week selling
characters he has created.
</P>
<P>
   All that said, Terry/Red maintains that he plays mostly for the
people he meets. ``I have 350 people on ICQ (an instant online
messaging service), and most of them play with me every single
week, if not day,'' he said. ``What I like most is the people I
play with, the sense of community and identity.''
</P>
<P>
   King's wife, Christy, is also an avid gamer, and with four
computers in their house the couple often plays in the same world
at the same time, but hardly ever see each other in the virtual
world. That's because their guilds, the online gaming groups to
which they belong, are sworn enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Christy plays a war mage, Kitty, in the world of Ultima, and
finds the online experience very alluring. ``I tried Final Fantasy
VII (a single-player game), but I didn't like it because it was
just me sitting at a computer,'' she said. ``What keeps you there
is the interaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Many players she meets online want to know if she's a ``real''
female, Christy said, ``And then they immediately want to be your
online boyfriend.''
</P>
<P>
   GAME OVER
</P>
<P>
   One last experience: I entered the PK server of Asheron's Call _
the so-called Player Killer world where warriors and enchanters can
frag you and steal your most valuable stuff, no questions asked _
and I purposely and with some difficulty took my lowly character to
the most brutal part of that world, the Direlands.
</P>
<P>
   And for some reason, seeing a lowly archer in this harsh region
where death always lurks touched a chord with many of the
high-level players there. Any one of these dozens of mages and
warriors could have killed and robbed me instantly, but instead
they gave me all kinds of marvelous gifts. At one point I found
myself in the midst of three powerful warlords as they
simultaneously showered me with magical weapons and jewelry and
wished me well.
</P>
<P>
   If anonymous gaming brings out the worst in some people, in
others it seems to bring out the best. And perhaps that is what
makes online games so fascinating _ they offer human experience at
its least complicated. That means killing. But it also means
befriending.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that making friends is what distinguishes
online games from computer games you play without going online.
What fascinates, what attracts, is that these universes are
peopled, after all, with people.

 &HT;    Stowaway keyboard wins awards, support for innovation
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Out of the thousands of products displayed at the
Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas earlier this month, only a
few win awards from the show sponsor, the Consumer Electronics
Association, as outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   The Stowaway Portable Keyboard won two: an Innovation award for
cres own right, should satisfy the requirements of anyone who isn't
getting paid to use it.
</P>
<P>
   A 250-page manual takes the edge off the complexity, although it
would be nice if it included a tutorial. There is also the standard
aggravation of any Adobe program, which is to say they were all
originally created for Macintosh and Adobe prints one manual for
both platforms, giving side-by-side instructions for both machines
where there is a difference in a given operation.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the photo-editing programs I've seen have provening
means to allow more light to strike a specific portion of the
image, thus darkening it; it's usually done by putting the hands
together in such a way that light falls only on the desired area.
Dodging is just the opposite, done by wiggling a piece of cardboard
on a stiff wire over the area to be lightened.
</P>
<P>
   Photoshop's dodging and burning tools work in an intelligent
manner. If you hold the dodging tool over an area of shade, the
entire area _ not just the part of it directly under the tool _ is
lightened, gradually revealing the detail you wanted to bring out.
The burning tool will take a light shadow and bring it all the way
to black if you desire. If you use the tools judiciously, the
results appear perfectly natural.
</P>
<P>
   Cropping is another simple matter here. It can be done through a
dialog box, but the easy way is with the cropping tool. Simply
outline the area you want to keep, hit return and you've got it.
While this is the way all programs ought to work, it frequently
doesn't seem to happen that way.
</P>
<P>
   Every program of this sort has some filters to make a picture
look more like a painting, or like anything but a picture.
Photoshop LE, however, has dozens of them, nearly all of them
infinitely adjustable in their effect. You can even change the
source of light in the picture.
</P>
<P>
   Photoshop Limited retails for $95. It's worth it.

 &HT;    No need to rush for upgrade to Windows 2000
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Back when I started messing with computers, I thought
operating systems _ the software that literally tells a computer
how to be a computer _ were fascinating. But I had a propeller on
my hat, was shunned by right-thinking people and was generally
considered to be lost in a fantasy world.
</P>
<P>
   I would wait for the new version of MS-DOS, the operating system
I used in those days, with the same anticipation and hope that
normal people felt as they waited for the next great movie. Regular
people looked at me funny.
</P>
<P>
   So I am more surprised than most that operating systems now are
considered to be big news by average folk. When Microsoft brings
out a new version of Windows, newspapers and TV devote the sort of
attention that used to be paid to dictators, rock stars and moon
landings.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of making things easier for consumers, all the hype has
made it more difficult. Should you upgrade from Windows 95 to 98?
Should you be the first in line to buy Windows 2000 when it comes
out? Or should you wait for the next consumer-grade edition of
Windows, called Millennium?
</P>
<P>
   Windows 2000 _ which is priced for and aimed at the business
user _ will be out in February. Millennium, which will replace
Windows 98, won't be far behind. Let's take a look at operating
systems today and try to make sense out of what you should do, when
to replace your old system and when to stand pat.
</P>
<P>
   First, the headlines.
</P>
<P>
   For those of you running Windows 95: Upgrade now. Windows 98 is
less likely to crash, uses memory better and does a better job of
protecting your security online.
</P>
<P>
   If you have Windows 98: Stand pat for a while. Don't upgrade
immediately to Millennium or Windows 2000. Let the bugs crawl out
of the woodwork first.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the details.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 95 is showing its age. Even with the literally dozens of
software upgrades and patches that can be found and downloaded for
free at www.microsoft.com, you will see an improvement in almost
all areas by immediately moving to Windows 98. With the Windows 98
Upgrade disc you won't lose any of your data or programs; the icons
and commands don't change substantially, so there is little
confusion involved.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 98 is a relatively stable operating system. If you buy a
copy, make sure the box says Second Edition, since considerable
improvements have been made since 98 was created. Then, once you've
installed it, use the built-in upgrade feature that automatically
takes you to the Microsoft Web site and installs any software fixes
and patches. Even with the Second Edition there are some important
upgrades, including three or four that help patch some holes in the
security it provides while you are online. To use the built-in
upgrade feature, click on the Start button and click on the Upgrade
menu item while connected to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   I've used both the upcoming and yet-to-released versions of
Windows in beta. Beta versions aren't complete and have some bugs
that will be fixed before these versions hit the shelves, but they
do offer a good picture of what the product will be like.
</P>
<P>
   Millennium has some nifty new features. It automates some file
repair tasks and is generally just as fast and (once it moves out
of beta) will be more reliable. But there's no rush (besides, it's
not on the market yet). When it becomes available, wait at least a
month before installing it.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 2000 is aimed at the high-end user, not the home
computer. But it's my guess (and it's only a guess) that many of
the new and powerful computers will come with it as a pre-installed
option. I think that _ since 2000 is built on Windows' almost
bullet-proof NT technology _ it will be important to both
businesses and home users. But if you are running Windows 98, you
have the option of watching and waiting once it's on the market.
</P>
<P>
   That's my best advice for today. Wait and see. As strange as it
feels, since I loved 'em before it was cool, don't get too eager
when it comes to new operating systems.

 &HT;    An extra e-mail account can sometimes come in handy
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ All you need is another e-mail account, right?
</P>
<P>
   There are dozens, maybe hundreds, of Web sites offering free
e-mail accounts. At first blush, that looks like a dumb idea. You
need an Internet connection to use these free accounts, and
Internet service includes an e-mail account. So why do you need
another one?
</P>
<P>
   Actually there are several reasons. For one, the Web-based
accounts are easy to check while traveling. You needn't set up your
computer for your ISP's local number or dial in by long-distance if
it doesn't have one. You may find times when you like having a
second, relatively anonymous address. Since replying to online
offers and posting messages often lands you on junk e-mail lists,
it's handy to have a second address.
</P>
<P>
   Today we'll look at some of the most popular free e-mail
services.
</P>
<P>
   Hotmail: This is Microsoft's offering. You can sign up at
lc4.law5.hotmail.passport
</P>
<P>
   .com/cgi-bin/login?lang &QC;  (or just look for the e-mail link to
the service at www.msn.com if that's too much typing). The sign-up
process is painless. You can _ if you like _ also download
Microsoft's Instant Messenger. Besides letting you keep an online
buddy list and send instant messages to people on that list, the
Instant Messenger service will notify you when you have e-mail
waiting. The downside of this service (and many of the others) is
that you'll almost certainly receive a lot of junk mail.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo Mail: Flip a coin. It's almost identical to Hotmail
(including the ability to use the Yahoo Instant Messenger service).
Since the actual Web address of the service is untypably long,
simply go to www.yahoo.com and look for the link that says e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Bigfoot: Known as one of the best directory services on the Web
where you can find a person's telephone number, street address or
e-mail address, Bigfoot is a natural when it comes to free e-mail.
Again, the address for the e-mail service itself is long and
unwieldy, so go to www.bigfoot.com and press the link that says
e-mail. The pitch made here _ and the way that e-mail is handled _
is slightly different. Here's the Bigfoot explanation of the
service: ``Bigfoot will deliver your messages to any e-mail account
you want. Regardless of how often you change providers, which
provider you choose or how many accounts you might have,
you(at)bigfoot.com will always be with you!''
</P>
<P>
   AltaVista: Since AltaVista, like Yahoo, is primarily known as a
search engine and start page, it must feel obliged to match Yahoo.
So you'll find AltaVista's entry into the Web e-mail derby as a
link on its Web page at www.altavista.com. While you're there, you
may want to check out AltaVista's offer for free Internet service
as well as e-mail at www.zdnet.com/downloads/altavista/.
</P>
<P>
   GeoCities: This Web service has been around for a long time and
was a pioneer when it comes to free Web sites. It also offers free
e-mail service. You'll find all the details at geocities.yahoo
</P>
<P>
   .com/home/.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape: You know it as the maker of the Netscape Web browser,
but the company also offers free e-mail and more through a free
membership program. You'll find the details at
home.netscape.com/home
</P>
<P>
   /services.htmlcontact. Since you've noticed a certain sameness
to these free e-mail offers by now, you'll not be surprised to
learn that you can also get a free Instant Messenger service and a
free personalized start page.
</P>
<P>
   You've noticed there are a bewildering number of choices. The
good news is that it would be difficult to go wrong with any of
these services. At the price (free), you can afford to sign up for
several if you wish.

 &HT;    AppleWorks suite 6.0 a major improvement
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ At long last, Apple Computer is preparing to release a
vastly improved version of its AppleWorks suite of productivity
applications.
</P>
<P>
   Most of you will remember this program as ClarisWorks.
Regardless of its name, this is a great piece of software, and
Apple has made it even better, redesigning the program from the
bottom up.
</P>
<P>
   Like Microsoft Office, AppleWorks is a collection of integrated
applications. They include word processing, database, spreadsheet,
painting and page layout. In version 6.0, Apple has replaced the
communications module with one for making presentations.
</P>
<P>
   AppleWorks never was a powerhouse with advanced features
equaling those of Microsoft Office. But it has always been the
easiest program of its kind to learn and use. That hasn't changed
with version 6.
</P>
<P>
   What Apple has done, though, is add a lot of the power features
that are already in Office. Among them are an interactive outline
mode, a thesaurus, document password protection and seamless
integration with the Internet without the need for a Web browser.
</P>
<P>
   You can also draw tables within a document, auto-save your work
and tap in free to a Web database of more than 25,000 images and
150 templates. Images, video and sound clips and photos can be
dragged and dropped into any AppleWorks document.
</P>
<P>
   What you'll notice first about AppleWorks is the look. It has
been redesigned to take advantage of the improved graphic
capabilities of Apple's latest operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   The program now features a series of floating toolbars. They are
tabbed and feature sharply rendered icon representations of
documents, functions and images.
</P>
<P>
   The toolbars are highly customizable. You add or remove icons
through drag and drop. Make the icons big or small, and orient your
toolbars vertically or horizontally.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the toolbars are semi-transparent, letting you see
through them to documents underneath.
</P>
<P>
   Many users will appreciate the addition of drag-and-drop tables
in AppleWorks. Tables are added now by simply dragging an icon from
the toolbar to the document. Text automatically wraps around the
table.
</P>
<P>
   Writers will especially appreciate two new features. One is the
inclusion of a thesaurus, although it's not as good as the printed
version of Roget's. But then again, neither is Microsoft Word's
thesaurus.
</P>
<P>
   The other feature is an interactive outline tool, long one of
the best features of Word. With AppleWorks, you can now start
writing with an outline and expand that outline into a finished
document. Or you can do the reverse, start writing and then view
your work as a reorganizable outline.
</P>
<P>
   Not every new feature of AppleWorks has been described. This is
a big upgrade, and surely there'll be some bugs. But at first
glance it looks like a winner.
</P>
<P>
   Apple expects to release AppleWorks 6.0 in February for $79. The
program also will probably be included with most new Macs sold
after that date.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, check out Apple's Web presentation of
AppleWorks. You'll find it at www.apple
</P>
<P>
   .com/appleworks.

 &HT;    Doctors watching Willie B.
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta's favorite gorilla, Willie B., is battling
pneumonia. The great ape took sick several weeks ago, when many of
the zoo's 23 gorillas also caught colds or the flu. The others got
better, but the 41-year-old Willie, who is elderly for a gorilla,
got worse and developed pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
   Willie is being kept indoors where he's mostly resting. Gail
Eaton, Zoo Atlanta's marketing director, says the keepers give him
peanut M&AMP;M's as a reward when he takes his medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Eaton explains that ``gorillas have very similar bodies to
humans. They are susceptible to many of same upper respiratory
infections, like colds and flu, that affect people.''
</P>
<P>
   But don't worry about making your pets sick. Eaton says their
bodies aren't enough like ours to share germs.
</P>
<P>
   2 KIDS' BOOKS HONORED
</P>
<P>
   ``Bud, Not Buddy'' and ``Joseph Had a Little Overcoat'' have won
the most prestigious awards in children's literature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bud,'' by Christopher Paul Curtis, won the John Newbery Medal
for outstanding writing. ``Joseph,'' by Simms Taback, won the
Caldecott Medal for outstanding illustrations.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Bud,'' published by Delacorte Press, 10-year-old Bud
Caldwell runs away from a foster home and begins a journey in
search of his father. His only clues are old flyers left by his
dead mother that point to a legendary jazz bandleader.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joseph,'' published by Viking, is based on a Yiddish folktale
of a resourceful tailor who transforms his worn-out overcoat into
smaller and smaller garments. The book is illustrated in
watercolor, gouache, pencil, ink and collage.
</P>
<P>
   Check them out for yourself and see what you think!

 &HT;    Friendly skies get annoying with oversized carry-ons
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ You are on a plane, carrying a small bag.
Overhead compartment after overhead compartment is filled with one
humongous carry-on bag after another. After a fruitless search, you
cram your bag under the seat and have a miserable, cramped flight.
Technology has come to the luggage market and has made the carry-on
bag the most annoying thing flying the friendly skies. In recent
years, carry-on bags have become more than carriers of magazines
and toothbrushes; they are now lumbering, canvas Winnebagos on
wheels, craftily designed to fit into the overhead bin exactly. Not
only that, they crowd aisles, slow down boarding and deplaning and
they make a heckuva bump on the noggin when they shift during
flight. While we know we can't outlaw them, we can at least make
them the annoying gadget of the week.

 &HT;    Consumer Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane Greig
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Q: I need your help in finding the date for the
next Bud Light Bullnanza in Las Vegas. I need this information as I
am trying to plan my wedding. We also need to get information on
price and tickets.
</P>
<P>
   _Jeanie C.
</P>
<P>
   A: Oct. 26-29 at Thomas &AMP; Mack Arena. The Bud Light Cup Series
works like NASCAR with bull riders accumulating points in yearlong
competitions in 29 cities. Bullnanza is held four times during the
year. The season-culminating event will be held in Las Vegas.
Participants are the top 45 bull riders in the world. Tickets are
sold by Professional Bull Riders Inc., at (719) 471-3008 as well as
by tickets.com at (888) 464-2468. Ticket prices begin at $36.50
</P>
<P>
   Q: I keep seeing newspaper articles about parents losing their
tax deduction because their babies were born after the New Year. I
heard there is a stipulation in the tax code that allows babies
born within the first few days of the new year to claim them on the
previous year's taxes and that there is also a new stipulation this
year for families of multiples to get an additional $1,000 tax
credit. _N. Landing
</P>
<P>
   A: Sorry, but a tax credit for a qualified child as a dependent
can only be taken in the year in which the child was born or alive.
There is no grace period, says Internal Revenue Service's Kenneth
Vargas. The 1998 tax credit for a qualified child was $400; for
1999, $500. So yes, if you have twins, the total deduction for 1999
is $1,000. But no, not an extra $1,000. Nice try. To ask other
tax-related questions ('tis the season), call the IRS at (800)
829-1040.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If the universe, by definition, consists of everything that
exists, and the universe is expanding, what is the universe
expanding into? Does this have something to do with ``curved
space''?
</P>
<P>
   _ Michael N.
</P>
<P>
   A: Common-sense question without a common answer. Those who
study the universe's expansion say this question is not ``part of
our science right now.'' (Science-speak for ``We really don't
know.'')
</P>
<P>
   But you are correct: The answer has something to do with
``curved space,'' the fusion of space and time. Craig Wheeler,
University of Texas astronomy professor (and great guy), is writing
an entire book on the subject. Official title? ``Cosmic
Catastrophes: Supernovae, Gamma-ray Bursts and Adventures in
Hyperspace.'' Wheeler notes, ``Einstein's equations for curved
space and gravity allow astronomers to describe the expansion of
the universe without needing to refer to what it is expanding
into.'' (Convenient.) The medium into which expansion occurs would
have to have a higher dimension (beyond front to back, side to
side, and up and down). Scientists agree they have no perception or
need right now for such a dimension, Wheeler adds.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Have you heard if the TV station that had the all-day New
Year's Eve celebrations from around the world is going to be
selling a video of all the different places? That would be great to
have as a keepsake of the New Year 2000. _ M. Nielson
</P>
<P>
   A: Loved those fireworks from Paris to Miami? Call (800)
CALL-ABC to purchase a two-hour tape of New Year's Eve coverage
(obviously condensed). The price? $14.95, plus shipping and
handling. Remember, videotape only lasts for a decade or so.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you have any ideas on how to easily peel hard-boiled eggs
(or how to boil them to make them easy to peel)?
</P>
<P>
   _ Fran Werner
</P>
<P>
   A: Using fresh eggs? The American Egg Board warns fresh eggs may
be difficult to peel. Eggs stored for a week to 10 days before
cooking usually peel more easily. The board's recommended cooking
method? Place eggs in a single layer in a saucepan. Add enough tap
water to come at least 1 inch above eggs. Cover and quickly bring
just to boiling. Turn off heat. Let stand, covered, about 15
minutes for large eggs (add time, up or down, by about three
minutes for larger or smaller eggs). Immediately run cold water
over eggs or place in ice water until completely cooled. To remove
shell, crackle it by tapping gently all over. Roll egg between
hands to loosen shell, then peel, starting at large end. Hold egg
under running cold water or dip in bowl of water to help ease off
shell. (By the way, a hen requires 24 to 26 hours to produce an
egg. Thirty minutes later, she starts all over again.)
</P>
<P>
   Q: There is a roadrunner that patrols our neighborhood. Is there
anything we can put out to help him get through the lean winter
months?
</P>
<P>
   _Dave and Ladine Conley
</P>
<P>
   A: Happen to have a plate of spiders, lizards and snakes? That's
what gets a roadrunner salivating, according to ornithologist Cliff
Shackelford at Texas Parks and Wildlife. Oh yes, the creepy
crawlers need to be alive. Roadrunners prefer to kill and eat their
own dinners. Natural predators? Roaming cats and cars (and Wile E.
Coyote).
</P>
<P>
   Q: I bought a house where the former owner went wild with
contact paper. All the cupboards are lined with the stuff. It's
fairly easy to peel off, but what about the sticky residue? I've
tried rubber cement thinner (my favorite solvent), but it's not
working very well. I need to unpack my dishes! _Martha Grenon
</P>
<P>
   A: Try Goof Off, available at hardware stores. Other popular
remedies include wallpaper remover, mineral oil, fabric presoak
(let rest for a bit) or a hair dryer to soften the adhesive.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I need the answer to a trivia question for students at the
University of Oregon. How many high-tech businesses are there in
Austin? _Anne B.
</P>
<P>
   A: ``The area's current high-tech job base is 125,000 workers in
2,000 companies, or about 20 percent of all Austin-area jobs,''
says Angelos Angelou of Angelou Economic Advisors Inc. By the way,
Oregonians are welcome to vie for some of the expected 24,600 new
tech jobs in the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you once more tell us what to do with those Christmas
poinsettias so they will bloom again? I know you're supposed to put
them in a dark place, but what else? _M. Grenon
</P>
<P>
   A: Poinsettias are tropicals that do not like temperatures below
65 degrees, and must be well-drained. Prune your poinsettias,
leaving a few leaves and branches. Let the plants enjoy full sun
and heat. In mid- to late August, pinch the poinsettias back to
make them fuller, and in September, place them in the shade (not in
a closet). In October, give the plants as much sunlight as
possible. Look for blooms to begin forming at Thanksgiving, with
full blooms by Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is Susan Lucci the daughter of Phyllis Diller? We received
some little-known facts from a friend, and that blew my wife away.
_Jack Geis
</P>
<P>
   A: Maybe the two are sisters in plastic surgery, but they're
definitely not mother and daughter, according to Robin Chandler of
ABC publicity. Lucci's parents are alive and well and living in
Florida. Q: Could you please tell me what to use to cover my velvet
clothes that I purchased this winter? I cover my leather jackets
with old cotton dresses.
</P>
<P>
   _S. St. Martin
</P>
<P>
   A: Good method. Protecting beaded or crushable fabrics with a
cotton item (I use old T-shirts) works well. The natural fiber
allows the clothing to breathe and provides a cushion while hanging
in the closet. Do not forget to moth-proof, also. Should the velvet
develop deep wrinkles, Karen Martin of Silk Road suggests tossing
the clothing in the dryer (alone and on a low setting) for a few
minutes or gently steaming in the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   Upshot/Update/Uproar:

``Porfirio Salinas'' by Ruth Hunnicutt Goddard. A few books
(regular binding for $100 or leather for $150) as well as the video

 &HT;    The closer you look, the better it getsBy Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If the holidays came and went and you still don't have
a DVD player, drop in on a friend and check one out. DVD was one of
the two hottest gift items, and it's time to find out why.
</P>
<P>
   Like the other big gift item, the digital camera, DVD takes on a
favorite pastime, movie watching, and adds so many dimensions that
it creates a fresh, new excitement.
</P>
<P>
   It provides video pictures of unmatched sharpness and detail and
a stream of sound that extends the viewing experience, making even
familiar films worth a new look.
</P>
<P>
   It lets you do a lot of little things like stop the movie and
analyze scenes, see extra footage and watch the director discuss
the movie in some instances. It offers many other extras impossible
with cumbersome videotapes.
</P>
<P>
   But what really sells DVD is this: The videos look and sound
gorgeous.
</P>
<P>
   I was aware of those features just from reading about them and
sneaking a peek into the sound rooms at my local HiFi Buys, but my
personal, hands-on experience revealed some surprises, too. I
discovered that even regular audio CDs sound better on the DVD
player _ so much better that I pulled my CD player and stored it in
the bedroom, where I may put up a small music system. I now play
DVD and CD on the same machine, such as my Toshiba SD-3109, which
has two separate disc trays. A nice net gain.
</P>
<P>
   Even better news is that if you have a reasonably up-to-date
sound system and a TV in the 30-inch range, you can step up to the
DVD experience at moderate cost.
</P>
<P>
   The players range from about $200 to about $800, with very good
machines in the middle at about $400, the cost of the Toshiba 3109
that I bought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Higher-priced machines do have noticeably higher quality, in
even better pictures and sound, better mechanical operation, and
storage of discs,'' said Michael Brough, a specialist at a HiFi
Buys store.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the machines such as the Sony DVP-CX850D, which sells
for $799 at HiFi Buys, actually store and organize up to 200 discs,
an entire library at your fingertips, Brough said.
</P>
<P>
   The Sony, like some others, will display on the TV screen the
whole library of discs, organized in ways to be located easily and
played at will.
</P>
<P>
   But even on the lower end, where I live, there is a very clear
difference in performance when compared with videotapes played on
the same audio and TV equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The noticeably superior CD playback was a tipoff as to why DVDs
perform so well. The DVD player, with its new electronics, does
more with the information from the disc, and the super supply of
extra information on the latest DVDs provides the amplifier and TV
with a torrent of picture and sound.
</P>
<P>
   While many people try to sell DVD superiority with the
excitement of movies featuring careening trains and fiery
explosions, it turns out that even the subtle sounds of crickets in
the night, the rustle of silk and the fine voice quality also add
pleasure and dimension to ordinary movies.
</P>
<P>
   Also for devoted listeners, the thrill of the audio is in the
way small things are highlighted, contributing to a sense of
presence _ like the swish of the brush against the jazz player's
cymbals, the eloquence of the tiny piccolo against the full voice
of the 100-piece orchestra and even the whir of a fan in the
corner.
</P>
<P>
   The good news on this front is that the choice of DVD movies is
no longer limited, as it was in 1996 when the medium was brand new.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Freeman, Atlanta regional media manager of Best Buy, says
his local outlets have found DVD discs to be among the hottest
items, with floor space constantly expanding for discs and
shrinking for videotapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect to have an inventory of 3,000 titles by the end of
this year,'' he said, ``and even though action movies have been our
best sellers, the appearance of Disney animation titles has
practically moved the focus from the home theater to the family
room.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the DVD player, the best quality of performance
depends on a good amplifier and the proper array of speakers.
</P>
<P>
   With DVD playback in Dolby digital, it is very important to have
a quality center speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``The center speaker, for most movies and audio CDs, presents
the voices, and without it there is a definite gap or hole in the
sound,'' said Brough of HiFi Buys.
</P>
<P>
   Read the label describing the features on the DVD player. One
desirable feature is the ability of the DVD to produce a Dolby
digital signal, especially if the amplifier is an older model
without its own Dolby decoder.
</P>
<P>
   With Dolby, the sound can come from up to six speakers,
including the center, two main front speakers, two rear speakers
and a powered subwoofer that gives the richness our ears have
become accustomed to.
</P>
<P>
   On the TV front, most people prefer the biggest screen they can
afford, often the projection TVs in the 50- to 60-inch range.
</P>
<P>
   Other DVD fans, like Freeman, lean toward the tube TVs, though
smaller at a maximum of 36 inches.
</P>
<P>
   The brightness and clarity of the tube machine more than make up
for the smaller size.
</P>
<P>
   With the push to reduce the inventory of analog TV sets and
replace them with inventories of digital TV sets, sales on
projection TVs now have them available in the $1,500-$2,000 range,
with tube sets at $800.
</P>
<P>
   DVD titles come in various formats, among the most popular being
the letter box or wide-screen format, which to some eyes looks
better on a big screen.
</P>
<P>
   For fans who dote on the technical aspects of video, and
especially DVD, there is plenty of material on the Internet to
slake your appetite.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most helpful is www
</P>
<P>
   .dvddemystified.com, which carries 100 pages of frequently asked
questions and answers about DVD, its technical history and other
details for beginners and veterans.

 &HT;    AppleWorks suite 6.0 a major improvement
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ At long last, Apple Computer is preparing to release a
vastly improved version of its AppleWorks suite of productivity
applications.
</P>
<P>
   Most of you will remember this program as ClarisWorks.
Regardless of its name, this is a great piece of software, and
Apple has made it even better, redesigning the program from the
bottom up.
</P>
<P>
   Like Microsoft Office, AppleWorks is a collection of integrated
applications. They include word processing, database, spreadsheet,
painting and page layout. In version 6.0, Apple has replaced the
communications module with one for making presentations.
</P>
<P>
   AppleWorks never was a powerhouse with advanced features
equaling those of Microsoft Office. But it has always been the
easiest program of its kind to learn and use. That hasn't changed
with version 6.
</P>
<P>
   What Apple has done, though, is add a lot of the power features
that are already in Office. Among them are an interactive outline
mode, a thesaurus, document password protection and seamless
integration with the Internet without the need for a Web browser.
</P>
<P>
   You can also draw tables within a document, auto-save your work
and tap in free to a Web database of more than 25,000 images and
150 templates. Images, video and sound clips and photos can be
dragged and dropped into any AppleWorks document.
</P>
<P>
   What you'll notice first about AppleWorks is the look. It has
been redesigned to take advantage of the improved graphic
capabilities of Apple's latest operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   The program now features a series of floating toolbars. They are
tabbed and feature sharply rendered icon representations of
documents, functions and images.
</P>
<P>
   The toolbars are highly customizable. You add or remove icons
through drag and drop. Make the icons big or small, and orient your
toolbars vertically or horizontally.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the toolbars are semi-transparent, letting you see
through them to documents underneath.
</P>
<P>
   Many users will appreciate the addition of drag-and-drop tables
in AppleWorks. Tables are added now by simply dragging an icon from
the toolbar to the document. Text automatically wraps around the
table.
</P>
<P>
   Writers will especially appreciate two new features. One is the
inclusion of a thesaurus, although it's not as good as the printed
version of Roget's. But then again, neither is Microsoft Word's
thesaurus.
</P>
<P>
   The other feature is an interactive outline tool, long one of
the best features of Word. With AppleWorks, you can now start
writing with an outline and expand that outline into a finished
document. Or you can do the reverse, start writing and then view
your work as a reorganizable outline.
</P>
<P>
   Not every new feature of AppleWorks has been described. This is
a big upgrade, and surely there'll be some bugs. But at first
glance it looks like a winner.
</P>
<P>
   Apple expects to release AppleWorks 6.0 in February for $79. The
program also will probably be included with most new Macs sold
after that date.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, check out Apple's Web presentation of
AppleWorks. You'll find it at www.apple
</P>
<P>
   .com/appleworks.

 &HT;    A smart way to target women
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you believe what you see on television, even the
most technophobic women have made peace with the Internet thanks to
a site called iVillage.com.
</P>
<P>
   A slew of TV commercials for the woman-oriented Web site feature
ordinary women telling heartwarming tales of how, thanks to
iVillage.com, they got advice about nutrition or learned about
computers or what to expect when they were expecting.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, no Web site is going to solve all your work, family,
money and relationship problems, but the site's mix of articles,
community topics and shopping tips really is a good way for women
to get started on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The woman-only Web site is one of a growing handful that
honestly pay attention to what their readers are doing and
thinking, as rival Web site Oxygen put it in its ``smart talk for
smart women.'' Borrowing a page from Web magazine Salon, this new
generation of women's Web sites knows the women and teen-age girls
who visit their sites have IQs above room temperature. They also
know how to involve their readers, and that's an exciting and
welcome change from many content sites on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   IVillage.com is a mix of the conventional and the offbeat, with
a something-for-everyone approach that will probably bring a
variety of women to the site, just as the ads say.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it's predictable, other times surprising. Tuesday
night's online chat with Hillary Rodham Clinton was a definite
coup, but iVillage really shines when it offers readers a chance to
comment on what they've read or voice their own opinions.
</P>
<P>
   The company began life on America Online, a place where talking
back and voicing opinions has always been an integral part of the
user experience. Clicking on iVillage's compilation of the 100
greatest books, the reader has no idea whether to expect a litany
of gothic novels or cookbooks. Happily, it's neither.
</P>
<P>
   Topping the list is ``Gone With the Wind,'' followed by ``To
Kill a Mockingbird,'' ``A Prayer for Owen Meany'' and ``Atlas
Shrugged.'' The book list is cleverly linked to Amazon.com and
peppered with member comments about the books and how a novel has
influenced a particular reader.
</P>
<P>
   To get the most out of iVillage, go beyond the start page with
its run-of-the-mill tips on romance, kids and money and check out
the book club, careers and election 2000. For women who want to
sample what the Web has to offer without straying too far away from
the community and structure of AOL, this is a good place to start.
</P>
<P>
   While iVillage has been around for a while, Oxygen
(www.oxygen.com) is a fairly new site from a powerful collection of
women executives, the most notable being Oprah Winfrey.
</P>
<P>
   Oxygen, which will also be a cable TV channel, combines the
traditional modes of online interactivity, such as chat and message
boards, with multimedia applications, such as video storytelling.
When users click on a story, a second browser window pops up and
the story is told through streaming video, a cutting-edge technique
not found on many Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Oxygen's users will probably be frustrated with the time
it takes for these ``video articles'' to load, but most of the
stories are worth the wait. It is a sign of the eventual merger of
TV and Internet technology that users are likely to see in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   If iVillage suffers a little from being too mainstream aiming
squarely at Mrs. America _ Oxygen scores points for targeting women
of all ages and offering a more offbeat selection of subjects.
Mothers who think and their daughters will appreciate Oxygen's mix
of articles and attitude. Users aren't just asked to post comments
but to submit whole stories on a variety of subjects. For example,
it incorporated the ``Girls On'' Web site into its ``family'' of
sites. ``Girls On'' lets teen-agers offer their own opinions on
film, movies, TV, books and a variety of other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Oxygen's reader contributions and iVillage's member comments
feel similar to the way women talk to each other face-to-face. Some
comments are thoughtful and witty, others are just silly, but their
authors all use the interactive medium of the Web to express their
ideas for an audience of peers.
</P>
<P>
   Both of these sites have a long way to go before they build the
reputations earned by sites like Salon and Slate, but those two
publications could take a lesson from the myriad opportunities
Oxygen and iVillage offer for reader input. They both make good use
of content and community that's missing in a lot of online
publications, especially those aimed at women. Online women's
magazines are a different kind of medium designed for a different
kind of woman _ one who likes to talk and not be talked down to.

 &HT;    Chat rooms with firepower
 &HT;    By Joe Stafford
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ After the massacre in Littleton last year,
investigators discovered that the two killers loved Doom, the
granddaddy of frenetic, kill-everything computer games. Often
played online, these are the games for which blood-spattered terms
such as fragfest and gibs were invented to describe the carnage.
Calls rang out to ban them, to stop the spread of the virtual
ultra-violence.
</P>
<P>
   But some experts think that type of game play is a dead end
anyway _ more and more spectacular environments in which to kill
and kill again, yawn _ and that the real future of online game play
is toward more complex social worlds that emphasize teamwork and
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   I've played computer games for years, but I wanted to test that
theory from the inside, to enter these strange realms, these
fabulously realistic 3-D worlds, to play the games, meet the
players virtual-face to virtual-face, to dodge the flying shrapnel
and the acid arrows, to ask the questions and to coyly turn down
the sexual propositions.
</P>
<P>
   Did I mention these are strange realms?
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the Holodeck, the brave new world, the chat room with
firepower. Where the future lies. Where the $10 monthly fees on
credit cards lie. Where your dreams and nightmares all come true,
but, more than anything, where you meet people, make friends and,
oh, yeah, kill them.
</P>
<P>
   None of these virtual worlds is a place I'd want my 8-year-old
daughter to venture. Everyone is a stranger, everyone is in
disguise, represented by a fantasy figure of their own choosing,
from futuristic missile-launching soldier to troll. These are
high-powered masquerades where anything can happen, with anonymity
fueling the worst in some people. Especially in first-person
shooters, played on unregulated private servers where anything
goes, the conversation can get primitive really fast.
</P>
<P>
   How would you explain how it works to an 8-year-old girl,
anyway? Well, it's like this. First you buy the game, choosing from
a huge variety of titles such as Warcraft, Rainbow Six, Quake,
Unreal, Tribes. You get the game home, remove the shrink wrap from
the CD, follow the directions and install the game on your
computer's hard drive. Then, hooked up via modem, you connect to a
distant computer over the Internet, sometimes for free, sometimes
for a small monthly fee. Other players connect to the same computer
and together you enter the game and interact in real-time.
</P>
<P>
   In the world of the first-person shooters, you see through the
eyes of your character. In other realms you see over your
character's shoulder, or from above at an angle. You meet others,
you play together, you chat.
</P>
<P>
   But in the frenetic butcher halls of games like Quake and
Unreal, it's hard to talk to anyone. People hop into these worlds
from their work computers, often, from all around the globe, to
jump around and blast away for 20 minutes, to get a quick fix. Just
try to chat with them:
</P>
<P>
   ``Pardon me!'' I type.
</P>
<P>
   SPLAT! I'm dead, pulverized by a rocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to ask ...'' I type after respawning, or coming back
to life.
</P>
<P>
   POW! Dead again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, forget it ...'' I type.
</P>
<P>
   SPLAP! Dead.
</P>
<P>
   Hmm. That didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   WHAP!
</P>
<P>
   Thank goodness there are other, less angry worlds.
</P>
<P>
   I knew I wasn't in Kansas anymore when I logged onto Everquest,
Sony's massively multiplayer online role-playing game (known by the
easy-off-the-tongue MMORPG) and found myself running through a
dripping-wet rainforest as a huge ogre, hunting frogs with dozens
of other trolls and ogres uttering phrases like ``Blorg kill frog
dead.''
</P>
<P>
   The people playing these games are adult-ish, computer-wise
modern people and yet here they're bounding through pretend forests
using pretend clubs to kill pretend frogs. I bounce up to an ogre,
a mean-faced thing dressed in skins, wagging a club. I type the
message: ``Beg pardon, I'm a reporter for a newspaper and I wanted
to ask you a couple questions about online gaming.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Og no talk now. Og kill stuff,'' he types in return. Og
shuffles off into the gloom. Hmm. That didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, though, you do make friends and meet people who
aren't too busy killing stuff to chat.
</P>
<P>
   THE FUTURE OF ONLINE GAMING
</P>
<P>
   Back in the real world, one expert says games that emphasize the
greatest strength of the Internet _ communication _ are where the
future lies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really a surprise that shooters became as important as
they are, because they are definitely anti-social,'' says Greg
Costikyan, author of ``The Future of Online Gaming.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're returning to what online games were 10 years
ago,'' he says, referring to text-based games _ MUDs or Multiple
User Dungeons _ popularized on college campuses in the late '80s.
``The ability to play online gives you an intelligent opponent,
which is always better than artificial intelligence, and it gives
you contacts. You can talk to people.''
</P>
<P>
   There is solid evidence of a shift. Austin's own Origin Systems
is a case in point. In July, the company, a subsidiary of the
California gaming giant Electronic Arts, set off a storm of
disappointed protests from fans when it dropped its A-10 Warthog
flight simulator and announced plans to devote all its efforts to
online gaming.
</P>
<P>
   Origin pioneered the multiplayer genre with Ultima Online, in
which approximately 150,000 subscribers populate a dragon-infested
magical world. The company plans to add much more social structure
to its new version of the game, UO2, due out this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've learned a lot about online entertainment over the past
two years since we launched Ultima Online,'' said Jeff Anderson,
executive producer for UO2. ``But most important, we've learned
that we are not just making games anymore. We're building virtual
worlds that will offer new ways for people to interact and
socialize.''
</P>
<P>
   Another example of the trend is hinted at in the
much-anticipated Team Fortress 2: Brotherhood of Arms, due out this
year from Valve, the makers of the hit shooter Half-Life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about deathmatch with better graphics,'' game
producer Gabe Newell says in the January issue of the gaming
magazine Incite. ``It's about really thinking about what groups of
friends are going to enjoy doing together.'' Team Fortress 2 will
force players to work as a close-knit team to defeat enemies in a
war zone and will include a built-in voice communication system _ a
first.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies are moving in a similar direction. Microsoft
released its own MMORPG, Asheron's Call, to good reviews in time
for Christmas and plans an outer-space-style massive player game
soon, both leaning heavily on the social aspect of the experience.
In Asheron's Call, players spend half their time standing around
chatting, planning trips into the large 3-D world and exchanging
virtual equipment.
</P>
<P>
   MEET MY PATRON, THE WARRIOR ANGMAR
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps my most revealing experience was in befriending Angmar,
a warrior who dwells in the world of Asheron's Call.
</P>
<P>
   The game calls for pledges of loyalty to other players, and I
picked Angmar more or less at random. My only stipulation was that
I wanted someone who was online a lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``How often do you play this game?'' I typed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enough that it's hurting my GPA,'' he typed back.
</P>
<P>
   Good enough for me. Figuring he was a college kid, I vowed
loyalty and he gave me some nifty equipment and advice and we
hunted several strange species of creatures together. Only later
did I find out he lives in Austin. And goes to Westwood High
School. And is 15 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly I felt very old. ``I had the impression you were
older,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the equal anonymity of the Internet,'' Angmar said.
``Age really doesn't matter online.''
</P>
<P>
   For those seeking proof that online games are about more than
just killing, Angmar is a good case. In real life his name is Alex
Dodwell, a sophomore who plays cello in the orchestra, competes in
soccer and is on the debate team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talking is the main reason to play games online,'' he said.
``Even while you're killing monsters, you're still chatting. It has
all the allure of a chat room but you get to play a fun game at the
same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Angmar hasn't been online as much lately since his dad put his
foot down. ``I'm pretty embarrassed to say it does occupy a lot of
my time,'' Alex said, ``but it doesn't really cut into my studies
too bad. I spend probably two or three hours a night online.''
</P>
<P>
   The upside of Angmar's _ Alex's _ interest in computers is that
he has become something of an expert with them, building computers
from scratch and even considering a high-tech career someday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been able to swim elbow-deep in my computer,'' he
said. ``My mom and dad are always asking me to fix things on
theirs. So my interest in computers might result in a career. It
helps my typing skills, if nothing else.''
</P>
<P>
   THE LATE SHOW GETS A LITTLE BLUE
</P>
<P>
   A big part of the fun is choosing how you'll appear to others.
Even the shooters let you choose from dozens of options. Cyborg?
Bodacious, gun-toting cyberbabe? Cigar-chomping drill sergeant?
</P>
<P>
   And maybe it's the testosterone of the game designers or the
players or both, but these worlds almost universally feature
characters who are pumped up, steroidal and sexy in a freakish way.
In the fragfest games the men bulge with muscles that make
Schwarzenegger look like Olive Oyl and the women are cut-looking
with gleaming metal bustiers.
</P>
<P>
   Playing as a male woodland elf one night in Everquest I was
propositioned by a female woodland elf, a really good-looking
blonde.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make a sign if your interested,'' the good-looking elf thing
typed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interested in what?'' I typed back.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' the elf thing said. ``Doing things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Things?'' I typed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Together. Anything you want,'' the elf thing said. ``I'll do
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure what you mean,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   Exasperated, I guess, the good-looking elf thing ran away into
the gloom.
</P>
<P>
   It's just as well. As my friend Angmar later said, ``It was
probably a 40-year-old pot-bellied guy sitting at his keyboard in
his underwear.''
</P>
<P>
   THIS IS YOUR LIFE
</P>
<P>
   As these encounters hint, for some people, the games are much
more than games. They're more like an alternative life or even a
second job. And, anecdotally at least, they're filled mostly with
males. In point of fact, the games are so male-dominated that
female players have a tough time convincing others that they're not
``role-playing'' a woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had someone ask me this weekend if I was really female,''
said Debbie Johnson of Tulsa, Okla., who plays a war magician, Lia
of Leafcull, in Asheron's Call. ``I replied yes, and then he asked
what age. When I replied `Over 40,' he said, `Yeah, sure, I bet.'''
</P>
<P>
   A Web site administrator for Avis Rent-a-Car, married 25 years
with no kids, Lia/Debbie started playing these kinds of games two
years ago and has since persuaded her 70-year-old dad to join her
online.
</P>
<P>
   Another female player for whom online gaming is a family affair
_ of another kind _ is Judy Winget of Cincinnati, who also plays
Asheron's Call. She's 41, a mother of two young children, a
professional business analyst who spends her free time as Reiki
Anzho, the magical monarch of The Mystic Order of Blackthorn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been through a divorce because my ex found `the love of
his life' playing (the online game) Yserbius,'' she said, citing
what is apparently not an uncommon occurrence in the these worlds.
``Though he's still single three-and- a-half years after the
divorce,'' Reiki/Judy added.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the separation, I met a wonderful man playing (online
games) and we've since married,'' she said. Now the two of them
play online together, often meeting in the virtual world.
</P>
<P>
   For Reiki/Judy, the games are as much about conversation as
about hunting and adventuring.
</P>
<P>
   ``The upshot is, yes, I play because of the social
interaction,'' Judy/Reiki said. ``If I had to do it alone and had
no friends to share the joy with, what would be the point?''
</P>
<P>
   VIRTUAL GAMES, REAL-LIFE MONEY
</P>
<P>
   But for some people the games are, partly at least, about making
money.
</P>
<P>
   Though not officially sanctioned by the game makers, the selling
of items and characters from the persistent worlds such as Ultima,
Asheron and Everquest has become common on Internet auction sites
such as eBay.
</P>
<P>
   For Terry King, 30, who has played Ultima Online since the
beginning two years ago, this phenomenon translates into more than
pocket change. The five-year Dell employee spends 35 hours a week
in the fantasy world, generally playing Red Alkeistarte, an evil
lord who can summon giant demons to his defense. Terry creates
virtual characters and buildings he can sell in the real world.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, he recently sold his virtual castle from the
Ultima realm at an online auction site for some $3,000 cash money
and sold a tower for $1,500 and a couple of houses for about $500
each. These bits of virtual real estate give a character great
prestige and take months or years of steady playing to build.
Terry/Red said he also makes an extra $200 a week selling
characters he has created.
</P>
<P>
   All that said, Terry/Red maintains that he plays mostly for the
people he meets. ``I have 350 people on ICQ (an instant online
messaging service), and most of them play with me every single
week, if not day,'' he said. ``What I like most is the people I
play with, the sense of community and identity.''
</P>
<P>
   King's wife, Christy, is also an avid gamer, and with four
computers in their house the couple often plays in the same world
at the same time, but hardly ever see each other in the virtual
world. That's because their guilds, the online gaming groups to
which they belong, are sworn enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Christy plays a war mage, Kitty, in the world of Ultima, and
finds the online experience very alluring. ``I tried Final Fantasy
VII (a single-player game), but I didn't like it because it was
just me sitting at a computer,'' she said. ``What keeps you there
is the interaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Many players she meets online want to know if she's a ``real''
female, Christy said, ``And then they immediately want to be your
online boyfriend.''
</P>
<P>
   GAME OVER
</P>
<P>
   One last experience: I entered the PK server of Asheron's Call _
the so-called Player Killer world where warriors and enchanters can
frag you and steal your most valuable stuff, no questions asked _
and I purposely and with some difficulty took my lowly character to
the most brutal part of that world, the Direlands.
</P>
<P>
   And for some reason, seeing a lowly archer in this harsh region
where death always lurks touched a chord with many of the
high-level players there. Any one of these dozens of mages and
warriors could have killed and robbed me instantly, but instead
they gave me all kinds of marvelous gifts. At one point I found
myself in the midst of three powerful warlords as they
simultaneously showered me with magical weapons and jewelry and
wished me well.
</P>
<P>
   If anonymous gaming brings out the worst in some people, in
others it seems to bring out the best. And perhaps that is what
makes online games so fascinating _ they offer human experience at
its least complicated. That means killing. But it also means
befriending.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that making friends is what distinguishes
online games from computer games you play without going online.
What fascinates, what attracts, is that these universes are
peopled, after all, with people.

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The purpose of Disney's Magic Artist Studio
($29.99 for Mac and PC; disney.go.com/disneyinteractive/) is
anything but black and white. Is it an animation tutor? A drawing
and painting program? Usually when a product tries to cover too
many bases it ends up lacking in all of them. Not so here. While
the anim-
</P>
<P>
   ation tutorials are basic and the creation of cartoon scenes is
limited to placing looped character movements and canned
soundtracks into pre-drawn scenes, kids seem to love it. And the
painting, drawing and text features are powerful for a program
aimed at children (our test kid was well on his way to producing
his own newspaper featuring Mickey and the gang). It's easy enough
to assemble and save slide shows of favorite creations to show off
to family and friends. Be warned, though ... you could be starring
in one of these epics. Magic Artist Studio lets young Rembrandts
import and doctor photos, making you look potentially, well, Goofy.

<P>
   STEP INTO THE RING
</P>
<P>
   Looking for some WWF Wrestlemania action? Look no further than
Toymax's WWF Slamcam ($70; www.toymax.com). The Slamcam is a
digital camera for the PC that allowsusers to put themselves in the
middle of the action. The camera is simple. Once you aim and shoot,
you can superimpose yourself as a fan in the crowd, on the body of
a referee or (ouch!) the receiving end of a Steve Austin headlock.
The camera also comes with its own software, which allows you to do
fun, if not strange, photo effects like adding hair or replacing
limbs with chicken legs and fish flippers. The software also
contains templates for fan ID cards, posters and calendars. While
the Slamcam is a digital camera, it's only to be used with the
Slamcam software. This makes photographing your mom's birthday
party rather difficult, unless, that is, you wanted a picture of
her pinned to the mat by the British Bulldog.

 &HT;    Amazon.com more than a store
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Who has not read of the Internet stock riddle: An
Internet company can incur staggering losses but still have a stock
market valuation like a Dow industrials company?
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com, the online retailer, is one of the most obvious
examples of that. The company has made founder Jeff Bezos a
billionaire several times over. Yet Amazon.com still spends far
more than it makes. Bezos has said he knows Wall Street is giving
him the benefit of the doubt for now, banking on the assumption
that Amazon.com is reshaping our definition of retail and cannot be
measured by old standards.
</P>
<P>
   An article by Miguel Helft in The Industry Standard, an online
and print magazine about the Internet economy, offers another
explanation. The piece, at www.thestandard.net
</P>
<P>
   /article/display/0,1151,8784,00.html, asks whether Amazon, the
so-called biggest store on Earth, is even really a store.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, retailing remains at the core of everything Amazon
does,'' writes Helft. ``During the peak holiday season, Amazon
sales reached a staggering $16 million a day. But Amazon is a new
type of retailer _ and not just because it does business over the
Internet. It has found a way to leverage its customer base,
e-commerce know-how and marketing muscle not only to build its
existing business but also to create new kinds of businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   The article lists the companies that Amazon has bought a piece
of during the past 18 months, all this buying done while Amazon.com
was losing money. Amazon has invested about $160 million for equity
stakes in six online retailers: Drugstore.com, HomeGrocer.com,
Pets.com, Ashford.com, Gear.com and Della.com. Helft writes that
those investments are now worth between $900 million and $1.5
billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means Amazon's paper gains from those investments vastly
exceed _ and might even double _ the $559 million in losses Amazon
has racked up in its five-year history. And those gains could soon
soar when HomeGrocer.com and Pets.com complete their pending
IPOs,'' the article reads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, these investments don't make Amazon a venture fund.
Nor is it a holding company of the likes of Internet Capital Group,
which has no operations of its own but has stakes in more than two
dozen business-to-business e-commerce companies. Amazon's goal
isn't to boost its balance sheet with these investments, but if
Amazon's greatest profit potential comes not from sales but from
investments, Bezos may have succeeded in creating a company that
defies categorization. The question is, what is Amazon's real
model?''
</P>
<P>
   SITE OFFERS SELF-HELP GURUS _ IN A COMPUTERIZED SENSE
</P>
<P>
   A Red Herring article looks at who, or what, is behind the
advice being offered from a new Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The article, www.herring.com/insider
</P>
<P>
   /2000/0113/vc-umagic.html, examines the business model behind
Umagic.com, a site designed to offer advice from noted self-help
gurus. But the advice won't be coming from them. The answers will
come from a computer version of the expert.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this bizarre idea, Umagic has attracted $8 million in
venture funding, including a $3.6 million bridge round landed last
week from Wheatley Partners, Woodland Ventures advertising mogul
Jay Chiat (founder of Chiat/Day and now chief executive of
Screamingmedia),'' the article said. ``The company plans next to
raise $20 million in fourth-round funding with J.P. Morgan's
help.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an opportunity for the experts to multiply themselves by
a million,'' Umagic founder and CEO David Post told Red Herring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be anybody's guess whether technology can replace humans
in the self-help department,'' the article states, ``at least until
Umagic launches its Web site in March.''
</P>
<P>
   WEB SITE HOPES TO CONNECT INVESTORS, ENTREPRENEURS
</P>
<P>
   A new Web site hopes to be a catalyst for venture capital
investing.
</P>
<P>
   The site, www.angeltips.com, opened for testing late last year.
The site will officially launch this month. It had planned to run a
TV ad during the Super Bowl but had second thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   The site hopes to connect Web resources and investors looking to
invest in high-technology and Internet firms.
</P>
<P>
   Accredited investors will have to pay a $1,000 yearly
subscription. The charge gives access to the Screening Room, which
will include the business plans and private placement deals offered
at the site. Entrepreneurs pay a $250 fee to post their business
plans on the site. Posting can include a video clip of the founder
describing the company's plan.

 &HT;    Adobe Photoshop LE a good `light' version of photo-editing tools
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Adobe Photoshop LE (which stands for Limited Edition)
is not as limited as you might think.
</P>
<P>
   Usually these light versions of standard programs are created to
be bundled with another program or a hardware item. Photo-editing
software, for instance, is generally included with page or Web
design programs and with a new scanner.
</P>
<P>
   They are simplified and limited versions of the original, and
you're encouraged to upgrade to the parent program.
</P>
<P>
   Photoshop is, of course, the reigning professional tool for
computer editing and image enhancing of photographs and other
graphics. It is a large and complex program.
</P>
<P>
   Photoshop Limited Edition, a powerful and complex tool in its
own right, should satisfy the requirements of anyone who isn't
getting paid to use it.
</P>
<P>
   A 250-page manual takes the edge off the complexity, although it
would be nice if it included a tutorial. There is also the standard
aggravation of any Adobe program, which is to say they were all
originally created for Macintosh and Adobe prints one manual for
both platforms, giving side-by-side instructions for both machines
where there is a difference in a given operation.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the photo-editing programs I've seen have proved rather
baffling, doing things to an image that didn't seem very useful.
Photoshop LE is another matter.
</P>
<P>
   Take the dodging and burning tools, for instance. If you've ever
printed photos in a darkroom, you'll recognize the terms. Burning
means to allow more light to strike a specific portion of the
image, thus darkening it; it's usually done by putting the hands
together in such a way that light falls only on the desired area.
Dodging is just the opposite, done by wiggling a piece of cardboard
on a stiff wire over the area to be lightened.
</P>
<P>
   Photoshop's dodging and burning tools work in an intelligent
manner. If you hold the dodging tool over an area of shade, the
entire area _ not just the part of it directly under the tool _ is
lightened, gradually revealing the detail you wanted to bring out.
The burning tool will take a light shadow and bring it all the way
to black if you desire. If you use the tools judiciously, the
results appear perfectly natural.
</P>
<P>
   Cropping is another simple matter here. It can be done through a
dialog box, but the easy way is with the cropping tool. Simply
outline the area you want to keep, hit return and you've got it.
While this is the way all programs ought to work, it frequently
doesn't seem to happen that way.
</P>
<P>
   Every program of this sort has some filters to make a picture
look more like a painting, or like anything but a picture.
Photoshop LE, however, has dozens of them, nearly all of them
infinitely adjustable in their effect. You can even change the
source of light in the picture.
</P>
<P>
   Photoshop Limited retails for $95. It's worth it.

 &HT;    No need to rush for upgrade to Windows 2000
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Back when I started messing with computers, I thought
operating systems _ the software that literally tells a computer
how to be a computer _ were fascinating. But I had a propeller on
my hat, was shunned by right-thinking people and was generally
considered to be lost in a fantasy world.
</P>
<P>
   I would wait for the new version of MS-DOS, the operating system
I used in those days, with the same anticipation and hope that
normal people felt as they waited for the next great movie. Regular
people looked at me funny.
</P>
<P>
   So I am more surprised than most that operating systems now are
considered to be big news by average folk. When Microsoft brings
out a new version of Windows, newspapers and TV devote the sort of
attention that used to be paid to dictators, rock stars and moon
landings.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of making things easier for consumers, all the hype has
made it more difficult. Should you upgrade from Windows 95 to 98?
Should you be the first in line to buy Windows 2000 when it comes
out? Or should you wait for the next consumer-grade edition of
Windows, called Millennium?
</P>
<P>
   Windows 2000 _ which is priced for and aimed at the business
user _ will be out in February. Millennium, which will replace
Windows 98, won't be far behind. Let's take a look at operating
systems today and try to make sense out of what you should do, when
to replace your old system and when to stand pat.
</P>
<P>
   First, the headlines.
</P>
<P>
   For those of you running Windows 95: Upgrade now. Windows 98 is
less likely to crash, uses memory better and does a better job of
protecting your security online.
</P>
<P>
   If you have Windows 98: Stand pat for a while. Don't upgrade
immediately to Millennium or Windows 2000. Let the bugs crawl out
of the woodwork first.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the details.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 95 is showing its age. Even with the literally dozens of
software upgrades and patches that can be found and downloaded for
free at www.microsoft.com, you will see an improvement in almost
all areas by immediately moving to Windows 98. With the Windows 98
Upgrade disc you won't lose any of your data or programs; the icons
and commands don't change substantially, so there is little
confusion involved.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 98 is a relatively stable operating system. If you buy a
copy, make sure the box says Second Edition, since considerable
improvements have been made since 98 was created. Then, once you've
installed it, use the built-in upgrade feature that automatically
takes you to the Microsoft Web site and installs any software fixes
and patches. Even with the Second Edition there are some important
upgrades, including three or four that help patch some holes in the
security it provides while you are online. To use the built-in
upgrade feature, click on the Start button and click on the Upgrade
menu item while connected to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   I've used both the upcoming and yet-to-released versions of
Windows in beta. Beta versions aren't complete and have some bugs
that will be fixed before these versions hit the shelves, but they
do offer a good picture of what the product will be like.
</P>
<P>
   Millennium has some nifty new features. It automates some file
repair tasks and is generally just as fast and (once it moves out
of beta) will be more reliable. But there's no rush (besides, it's
not on the market yet). When it becomes available, wait at least a
month before installing it.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 2000 is aimed at the high-end user, not the home
computer. But it's my guess (and it's only a guess) that many of
the new and powerful computers will come with it as a pre-installed
option. I think that _ since 2000 is built on Windows' almost
bullet-proof NT technology _ it will be important to both
businesses and home users. But if you are running Windows 98, you
have the option of watching and waiting once it's on the market.
</P>
<P>
   That's my best advice for today. Wait and see. As strange as it
feels, since I loved 'em before it was cool, don't get too eager
when it comes to new operating systems.

 &HT;    An extra e-mail account can sometimes come in handy
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ All you need is another e-mail account, right?
</P>
<P>
   There are dozens, maybe hundreds, of Web sites offering free
e-mail accounts. At first blush, that looks like a dumb idea. You
need an Internet connection to use these free accounts, and
Internet service includes an e-mail account. So why do you need
another one?
</P>
<P>
   Actually there are several reasons. For one, the Web-based
accounts are easy to check while traveling. You needn't set up your
computer for your ISP's local number or dial in by long-distance if
it doesn't have one. You may find times when you like having a
second, relatively anonymous address. Since replying to online
offers and posting messages often lands you on junk e-mail lists,
it's handy to have a second address.
</P>
<P>
   Today we'll look at some of the most popular free e-mail
services.
</P>
<P>
   Hotmail: This is Microsoft's offering. You can sign up at
lc4.law5.hotmail.passport
</P>
<P>
   .com/cgi-bin/login?lang &QC;  (or just look for the e-mail link to
the service at www.msn.com if that's too much typing). The sign-up
process is painless. You can _ if you like _ also download
Microsoft's Instant Messenger. Besides letting you keep an online
buddy list and send instant messages to people on that list, the
Instant Messenger service will notify you when you have e-mail
waiting. The downside of this service (and many of the others) is
that you'll almost certainly receive a lot of junk mail.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo Mail: Flip a coin. It's almost identical to Hotmail
(including the ability to use the Yahoo Instant Messenger service).
Since the actual Web address of the service is untypably long,
simply go to www.yahoo.com and look for the link that says e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Bigfoot: Known as one of the best directory services on the Web
where you can find a person's telephone number, street address or
e-mail address, Bigfoot is a natural when it comes to free e-mail.
Again, the address for the e-mail service itself is long and
unwieldy, so go to www.bigfoot.com and press the link that says
e-mail. The pitch made here _ and the way that e-mail is handled _
is slightly different. Here's the Bigfoot explanation of the
service: ``Bigfoot will deliver your messages to any e-mail account
you want. Regardless of how often you change providers, which
provider you choose or how many accounts you might have,
you(at)bigfoot.com will always be with you!''
</P>
<P>
   AltaVista: Since AltaVista, like Yahoo, is primarily known as a
search engine and start page, it must feel obliged to match Yahoo.
So you'll find AltaVista's entry into the Web e-mail derby as a
link on its Web page at www.altavista.com. While you're there, you
may want to check out AltaVista's offer for free Internet service
as well as e-mail at www.zdnet.com/downloads/altavista/.
</P>
<P>
   GeoCities: This Web service has been around for a long time and
was a pioneer when it comes to free Web sites. It also offers free
e-mail service. You'll find all the details at geocities.yahoo
</P>
<P>
   .com/home/.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape: You know it as the maker of the Netscape Web browser,
but the company also offers free e-mail and more through a free
membership program. You'll find the details at
home.netscape.com/home
</P>
<P>
   /services.htmlcontact. Since you've noticed a certain sameness
to these free e-mail offers by now, you'll not be surprised to
learn that you can also get a free Instant Messenger service and a
free personalized start page.
</P>
<P>
   You've noticed there are a bewildering number of choices. The
good news is that it would be difficult to go wrong with any of
these services. At the price (free), you can afford to sign up for
several if you wish.

cough, congestion, aches and pains, runny nose or fever.
Naturopathic and herbal practitioners approach colds and flu from
another direction, accelerating the immune system response that
causes the unpleasant symptoms. Their therapies tend to be gentler,
although herbal medicines also can have unwanted side effects.

 &HT;    `Second season' brings a crop of new contenders
 &HT;    By Diane Holloway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A television executive once compared scheduling
to playing checkers in a speeding motorboat. You line up all the
pieces only to have them fly off the board or slide onto other
squares.
</P>
<P>
   With the holidays behind us and the February sweeps around the
corner, we're heading into that TV time known as midseason or
``second'' season. Network honchos have to do something to fill the
holes left by all the fall failures, so the hype-and-optimism
factory is burping and churning once again.
</P>
<P>
   Two midseason biggies already have arrived _ and both have been
tentatively embraced by viewers. In the early going, CBS's ``City
of Angels,'' a Steven Bochco hospital drama with a mostly
African-American cast, and Fox's outrageous family sitcom,
``Malcolm in the Middle,'' are cruising.
</P>
<P>
   Midseason has been around since the early '70s, when the
networks stopped ordering 35 episodes (it's now down to 22) and
failures became more rampant. As long as there are hours to fill,
replacement series will abound. It used to be considered the kiss
of death to be relegated to midseason and miss out on all the fall
promotion, but not anymore. Some observers _ especially producers _
believe midseason series have an advantage because the competition
is less intense. Bochco, who's never shy about complaining, didn't
object to his January premiere.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees that midseason is better.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a crock,'' counters Preston Beckman, NBC's vice
president for program scheduling. ``Before I did scheduling I
worked in research, and at one point I looked at the probability of
success with midseason vs. fall. To the shock of most people, I
found that the chances of success are greater in fall than
midseason. The bottom line is a good show in a good time period
that's marketed well will succeed regardless of when it's
introduced.''
</P>
<P>
   With all due respect to Beckman, his study didn't examine the
types of shows that succeed in midseason. Shows that are unusual
and may need a bit more time for viewers to figure them out seem to
have a better shot in the January-March season. ``The Wonder
Years,'' with its unusual narration from the grown-up kid hero,
debuted in January, and the totally bizarre ``Twin Peaks'' arrived
in April.
</P>
<P>
   Beckman disagrees, but it's possible that NBC's midseason drama
entry last year, the soft-focus family show ``Providence,'' might
not have caught on in the fall crush.
</P>
<P>
   ``There could be situations where you hold back the premiere of
a show because you look at your schedule and can't find a time
period where you think it can succeed,'' Beckman concedes, noting
that ``Freaks and Geeks'' might have done better if it had waited
for its current Monday time slot rather than debut in the fall on
Saturdays. ``But this business is really more random and chaotic
than we all want to think. Shows will pop up at all times of the
year, and some work. You just don't know. We're great
after-the-fact experts.''
</P>
<P>
   If any of the proposed newcomers succeeds, perhaps it will be a
scheduling fluke. But maybe not. In January, February and March,
viewers aren't alternately preoccupied with back-to-school madness
and holiday preparations. Although Central Texas seems to be
afflicted with perpetual summer, many parts of the country are
imprisoned by bitter cold _ thus encouraging folks to sample new
shows.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the upcoming programs are good, and many haven't even
been sent out for preview. Networks say that's because they don't
have airdates yet, but it may also be because executives don't want
the bad ones reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a quick look at a few.
</P>
<P>
   ABC
</P>
<P>
   ``Wonderland'' _ A psychiatric hospital drama produced by former
``Chicago Hope'' star Peter Berg. A total unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clerks'' _ A cartoon comedy (based on Kevin Smith's '94 indie
film) about four lazy friends who become comic book heroes in their
own minds. Perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   CBS
</P>
<P>
   ``Grapevine'' _ Based on a '92 summer series (which the network
feels was ahead of its time), a Miami-based sitcom about four
people who share their self-absorbed thoughts with the audience.
Too whiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``Falcone'' _ A mob drama based on real-life undercover agent
Joe Pistone, starring Jason Gedrick and Titus Welliver, that was
pulled off the fall schedule because of concern over violence (now
supposedly toned down). The original was good.
</P>
<P>
   NBC
</P>
<P>
   ``The Others'' _ Do you see dead people? The folks in this
sci-fi drama do. The pilot, coming Feb. 5, was uneven but had a
couple of good scares.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sammy'' _ A really stupid animated comedy based on the unhappy
relationship between David Spade (creator and voice actor) and his
father.
</P>
<P>
   ``God, the Devil and Bob'' _ Animated series with voice-overs by
French Stewart (Bob), James Garner (a scruffy-looking God) and Alan
Cumming (the Devil) about a Detroit car worker who must prove why
mankind should be saved. Mildly offensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Battery Park'' _ Described as a ``Barney Miller'' type show,
this comedy starring Elizabeth Perkins as a cop captain comes from
Gary David Goldberg (``Family Ties,'' ``Spin City''). Unknown.
</P>
<P>
   FOX
</P>
<P>
   ``The Opposite Sex'' _ Drama about three teen boys in all-girl
prep school. How original.
</P>
<P>
   ``Titus'' _ Sitcom built around little-known stand-up
Christopher Titus about (what else?) a dysfunctional family. Do we
need more of these? No.
</P>
<P>
   WB
</P>
<P>
   ``DC'' _ Good drama from Dick Wolf about twenty-something
roommates working in the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brutally Normal'' _ Debuting Sunday (Jan. 24) at 8, a comedy
about (yet again) four high school chums struggling through
adolescence.
</P>
<P>
   UPN
</P>
<P>
   ``The Beat'' _ Disappointing drama from Barry Levinson and Tom
Fontana about young undercover cops in NY.

 &HT;    Stowaway keyboard wins awards, support for innovation
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Out of the thousands of products displayed at the
Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas earlier this month, only a
few win awards from the show sponsor, the Consumer Electronics
Association, as outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   The Stowaway Portable Keyboard won two: an Innovation award for
creative design and Best of Show honors in the computer hardware
category.
</P>
<P>
   The Stowaway is a collapsible keyboard for users of handheld
organizers such as the Palm Pilot series, the Handspring Visor
series and others.
</P>
<P>
   When stored, the Stowaway folds to about the size of a pocket
organizer, 3.6 inches by 5.1 inches and only 0.8 of an inch thick.
It weighs 7.9 ounces.
</P>
<P>
   But it folds out accordion-style to become a full-size QWERTY
keyboard with extra keys to call up functions such as calendars,
address books, memos and to-do lists. When attached to the pocket
organizer, the Stowaway reduces the need for the stylus handheld
organizer users normally use to choose options on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   When the Stowaway is set up, it has a plug into which the
handheld organizer is set. No connecting wires are required. The
keyboard lies flat and the organizer stands up like the screen of a
laptop computer.
</P>
<P>
   The keys travel the same distance as a normal computer when
pressed, so the Stowaway has the feel and response of standard
office keyboards. It lies flat on a desk, so no wrist supports are
required.
</P>
<P>
   It's made of durable glass-filled polycarbonate and aluminum and
requires no batteries.
</P>
<P>
   The Stowaway was developed by Think Outside Inc., a startup
company based in Solana Beach, Calif. Both Palm Computing Inc. and
Handspring Inc. have been working with Think Outside to develop
Stowaway versions for their products.
</P>
<P>
   For additional information on the Stowaway, visit the Web site
at www.thinkoutside.com.

   TEEN-EXECUTION (San Antonio) _ Leta Ann Jones Wilkerson was
killed nine years ago by 17-year-old Glen McGinnis during a
robbery. Because of his age at the time of the murder, McGinnis'
scheduled execution Tuesday touched off a wave of international
protests last week, including a direct appeal from Pope John Paul

   COPS-TRIAL-NEIGHBORS (Bronx, N.Y.) _ Some residents of the Bronx
neighborhood in which Amadou Diallo died in a hail of police
bullets say the shooting would not have happened if local beat
police _ rather than the four members of the city's elite Street
Crime Unit _ had been the ones who encountered the 22-year-old man
that night. By MELISSA GRACE.

   COPS-TRIAL-CAMERA (Albany,N.Y.) _ Cameras, or at least one

With courtroom seating at a premium in the Albany County Courthouse

is seriously considering a closed-circuit transmission of the
proceedings, at least to another courtroom, so more people can

of commuter marriages are being revisited and re-examined these
days, especially in light of the arrangement of Bill and Hillary
Rodham Clinton and open speculation on the state of the first

<P>
   Youki Kudoh isn't exaggerating when she says she's the Madonna
of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Discovered on the streets of Tokyo at age 12, Kudoh immediately
threw herself into a full-time career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even at 12, I knew I wanted to be financially independent,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   Her first film was the Japanese cult hit ``The Crazy Family,''
in which she played a crazed pop star. That performance quickly led
to a recording contract and real-life pop stardom.
</P>
<P>
   By age 22, Kudoh had released 11 major albums.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least, I think it's 11,'' says Kudoh, now 27. ``I've lost
count.''
</P>
<P>
   For a while, she abandoned acting entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that actors didn't sing, and singers didn't act,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   But parts in Jim Jarmusch's ``Mystery Train,'' Kayo Hatta's
``Picture Bride'' and an Australian black comedy called ``Heaven's
Burning'' lured her back to the movies _ and brought her to the
attention of American casting agents.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, she snagged Hollywood's ultimate part for an Asian
female: Hatsue in the hot new film ``Snow Falling on Cedars,''
directed by Scott Hicks (``Shine'') and costarring Ethan Hawke.
</P>
<P>
   Kudoh plays the lost love Hawke is still pining for when
Japanese-American relations turn sour in Puget Sound, Wash., during
World War II. (The film is adapted from David Guterson's
best-selling 1994 novel.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I never expected I would get cast in an American studio
film,'' Kudoh says. ``I had just gotten married, and I didn't want
to work in a foreign country. But after I read the book on a
camping trip, I decided I must be in the film. I sent a video
audition, even though I knew it was a long shot.''
</P>
<P>
   After auditioning for Hicks, Kudoh read with would-be co-star
Ethan Hawke, who told her not to be nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I was very, very, very nervous,'' she says, laughing.
``When we made the film, I discovered he is a total gentleman, very
quiet. And he really loves Uma! He's always expecting her call.''
</P>
<P>
   Kudoh may release a record in the U.S. next year, but she's not
sure about her next acting move. She thinks she might have been
spoiled by ``Snow Falling on Cedars.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very poetic film,'' she says. ``I haven't read a script
in two years as good. So I'll wait for another part that talks to
me.''

<P>
   The biggest beauty pageant this side of Miss Universe can be
found on the Internet, thanks to the recent explosion in Web sites
selling cosmetics, toiletries and fragrances.
</P>
<P>
   To entice shoppers away from traditional beauty haunts, the
sites are piling on the extras, like free gift wrapping, free
shipping, gift with purchase, advice columns and on-line magazines.
</P>
<P>
   The downside to this modern method of shopping is obvious: no
sampling or spritzing to test the colors, textures and fragrances.
But the convenience can't be beat.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the newest options for the virtual beauty
junkie.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Beauty.com &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a staggering product selection, you'll find a
number of hot makeup brands here, from Anna Sui to Face Stockholm.
And the site has several celebrity experts doling out advice, like
model/cosmetics entrepreneur/rock-star wife Iman, makeup artist
Kevyn Aucoin and hairstylist Sally Hershberger.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Beautyjungle.com &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It may be a jungle out there, but that's no reason not to look
your best. For the time-starved, this site has more than 75 brands,
from department store names to drugstore staples. Extras include
on-line beauty advisers and a sleek, info-packed magazine.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Beautyscene.com &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Looking to upgrade your man's beauty routine? Hide his Ivory
soap and start surfing here for no-nonsense skin-care lines like
eShave, Heavy Duty, Joey New York, Peter Thomas Roth and Cellex-C.
His skin will look great and he won't mind displaying the unisex
packaging in his bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Bluemercury.com &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dominated by indie brands like T. LeClerc, Fresh, Aesop, Red
Flower, Nars and Antonia's Flowers, this site is the beauty
equivalent of the Sundance cable channel. For the holiday season,
look for the site's gift sets.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Eve.com &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Beer of the Month Club? Forget it. How about ordering Eve.com's
``Year of Beauty,'' in which a different product from the likes of
Carolina Herrera and Perlier is shipped each month throughout 2000.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Gloss.com &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you're into aromatherapy or color therapy, surf no further.
Tony &AMP; Tina and Philosophy, both major proponents of making
customers feel better through fragrance and color, offer a wide
range of their products here, from lipstick to bubble bath.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Indulge.com &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In addition to fashion accessories like pashmina pajamas and
Selima glasses, this site has products for head-to-toe pampering,
from Mason Pearson brushes to Diamancel foot files.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Ingredients.com &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The exclusive retailer for ingredients.com toiletries, which
boast a variety of benefits. Green tea scent spray relaxes,
lavender body lotion soothes, peppermint foot balm invigorates and
the St. John's wort candle just might light up your life.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Jasmin.com &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Know someone who collects perfume bottles? Jasmin.com, the site
devoted exclusively to fragrances, has a Baccarat bottle filled
with Shalimar, plus limited editions of Joy, Royal Doulton and
Lucien Lelong's Pour Femme.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Sephora.com &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This virtual version of the French emporium has an enormous
selection of beauty booty, but it's also a stellar source for
candles, like its transparent gel candles, available in a
kaleidoscope of colors.
</P>
<P>
   New offerings include Tocca's candle collection.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Spacadet.com &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This adorable low-budget site, run by New York esthetician
Jillian Ratensperger, is great for small gifts, like Loofah Loafers
and Sniff decorated tissues. And for those who have been naughty
rather than nice _ a bar of soap and a washcloth from Dirty Girl. &QL;

<P>
   The eastern face of the mountain is avalanche terrain. There are
no trees to anchor the snow. A screaming wind picks up even more
snow from the mountain's far side and deposits it onto a bulging
cornice that threatens to crack under its growing weight.
</P>
<P>
   The slope of this mountain in Davos, Switzerland, is steep _ 40
degrees. To ski it after a heavy snowstorm, you would have to be
either exceptionally unwise or an avalanche researcher. Four of the
latter _ Bob Brown, Ed Adams, Jim Dent and Karl Birkeland, of
Montana State University _ are making plans to do just that.
</P>
<P>
   Their destination is a plywood shack in the protective embrace
of a small rock outcropping _ directly in the path of an avalanche.
The structure is 9-by-6 feet, enough room, barely, for two
scientists (the rest retreat to the edge of the slide path), an
array of instrumentation, a gas-powered generator and one rather
nervous journalist.
</P>
<P>
   One of the men will ski to the top of the ridge, hoist four
pounds of explosives on a pulley out over the crown of the slope,
and light the fuse, sending vast amounts of snow down on his
colleagues' heads.
</P>
<P>
   Why do researchers risk their lives like this? In part, because
few other jobs require one to ski through some of the planet's most
reliably gorgeous scenery. And although there is an inescapable
sense that the danger itself is appealing, they do it to save
lives. The more that is known about the dynamics of avalanches, the
easier it becomes to accurately predict where, and how far, they'll
tumble.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't take a big avalanche to kill people _ the vast
majority of deaths occur in slides that run no farther than 200
yards.
</P>
<P>
   Avalanche debris is nothing like the airy, fresh-fallen snow of
skiers' dreams. The snow crystals in the debris pile left by an
avalanche are packed together so densely that they feel like
concrete.
</P>
<P>
   The snow that buries the typical victim is only 50 percent air,
as opposed to fresh snow, which is 80 percent air. You cannot move
_ or even expand your chest to breathe _ let alone dig your way
free.
</P>
<P>
   Suffocation is the means to the end in two-thirds of avalanche
deaths. The remaining third die from the trauma of being flung
against boulders and trees at speeds of up to 80 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Some victims are done in by their own breath, which condenses
and then freezes on their faces, forming an ice mask that slowly
cuts off what little air remains. Only one avalanche burial victim
in four lives to remember it ...
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Car four of the Davos Cable Car holds the regular assortment of
brightly hued skiers and teen-age snowboarders. But one man carries
no skis. It's Martin Schneebeli, the resident snowpack structures
expert, commuting to the field research area of the Swiss Federal
Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research in Davos.
</P>
<P>
   The research area is a series of cold labs at the top of a
mountain directly above the town.
</P>
<P>
   Three-quarters of the way up the mountain, Schneebeli, my guide
for the day, points out a patch of snow checkered with deep square
pits. These snow pits are the basic tools of avalanche prediction.
</P>
<P>
   The layers visible on the walls of the pits reveal the history
of the past few months' snowfalls. To determine avalanche risk,
forecasters visually assess these layers to ascertain the stability
of the resulting snowpack.
</P>
<P>
   In the world of avalanche prediction, weather calls the shots.
Spring thaws can weaken the bonds that form between crystals as the
snow melts and refreezes, paving the way for deadly, heavy, wet
snow avalanches.
</P>
<P>
   A strong sun will melt surface snow, which then refreezes at
night into an icy crust, off of which the next layer of snow can
easily slip.
</P>
<P>
   A similar slippery and fragile snow layer is something called
``surface hoar'' _ essentially a morning frost on top of the snow
that gets buried by more snow.
</P>
<P>
   Sharing top billing in the rogues' gallery of weak layers is a
wily meteorological entity known as ``depth hoar.'' In early
winter, when the ground is still warm, heated and moistened air
rises through the snow and cools into a layer of angular,
recalcitrant, depth-hoar crystals _ pretty to look at, but weak as
kittens.
</P>
<P>
   In a 32-degree Fahrenheit room in the Institute's field station,
researchers Charles Fierz and Thorsten Baunach create depth hoar in
a box to determine how quickly it grows under various snow and
weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
   In the corner are 12 cardboard Chiquita banana boxes filled with
snow. Fierz scoops some of it into a sieve and hands it to Baunach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we make a snowfall!'' Baunach says, grinning like a kid.
He shakes the sieve over a box to recreate inside the lab what has
been happening outside for the past 12 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Like a picky head chef, Fierz points to lumps in the mound of
sifted white: ``Try double sifting,'' he suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Fierz and Baunach will take snow samples from their boxes every
12 hours, as the snow's temperature rises from minus 4 to 30
degrees Fahrenheit. The snow is shallow _ only about 2.5 inches.
The shallower the snow, the steeper the temperature gradient
between the ground-warmed bottom (being played, in this case, by a
heated metal plate) and the air-chilled top of the snow. The warm
air rises, cools quickly and becomes frost crystals.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the shack, Ed Adams and Karl Birkeland are busy with
shovels, clearing space in the snow to lay down equipment that will
log the snow's temperature as the avalanche passes.
</P>
<P>
   I ask Adams what would happen if the avalanche let go on its own
while we were out here.
</P>
<P>
   ``See those flats?'' Adams points down the slope. ``You'll end
up down there.'' Brown sticks his head out of the shack. ``But
first, you'll have to go through those trees. That'll beat you up
real bad.''
</P>
<P>
   I ask Jim Dent what it's like in the shack during an avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just gets grayer,'' he says. ``I like to stick my hand out
into the avalanche as it goes by. It's like putting your hand into
a river.''
</P>
<P>
   He tells me that if I want a good view, I should climb up onto a
platform nailed to a tree 100 yards downhill and 30 feet to the
side of the slide path. So I do. From my perch, I watch Adams ski
up to the top, his backpack bulky with explosives. Then two other
researchers ski off to the side, much farther to the side than my
tree.
</P>
<P>
   The path from Adams to me looks like a straight line.
Apparently, the avalanche turns as it flows downhill. I try not to
think about it.
</P>
<P>
   Five, four, three, two ... A tumble of choppy white emerges from
beneath the bomb's sooty smoke cloud: Avalanche!
</P>
<P>
   Having only seen the slow-motion rendition of an avalanche, I'm
shocked at how fast it is. By the time the slide passes me, it has
spread and flattened itself out, becoming a rippling disturbance in
the snow. It's as though something had gotten under the mountain's
skin.
</P>
<P>
   There's an eerie quality to the sight: fallen snow, something
I've always thought of as stationary and benign, suddenly come to
life.
</P>
<P>
   Back up at the shack, Adams sits in the rubble, holding a
thermometer in the snow like a concerned mother. Brown is shaking
his head. He had hoped a 15-inch layer would break loose and slide.
It was considerably smaller.
</P>
<P>
   ``The snow set up too much,'' he says. ``It was too warm.''
</P>
<P>
   He sounds like a chef assessing a failed souffle. But Brown has
high hopes for another big slide before the season ends. It's late
February now, so he figures he's got one more shot at it. Or it's
got one more shot at him.

   ``Can't move,'' said Rita, the new intern, after examining her
latest patient. ``Twenty-three-year-old Chinese male. Says his
brother has the same problem sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Her face scrunched up. She was stumped.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had it before?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you ever hear of familial periodic paralysis?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No.'' She frowned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither had I until my first case seven years ago. Pretty odd,
but very real.''
</P>
<P>
   There are thousands of Mendelian diseases, so called because
they are passed from parent to child in much the same way Gregor
Mendel's pea plants inherited traits such as color, height and
wrinkly pods.
</P>
<P>
   The periodic paralyses, a group of genetic diseases, are
autosomal dominant, so a child with one affected parent has a 50-50
chance of acquiring the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Although the conditions are not common _ they occur in roughly
one in 100,000 people _ certain ethnic groups have a higher
frequency of the mutations that cause them.
</P>
<P>
   Rita and I strolled over to her patient, Mr. Chang. On the way,
Karen, our translator, joined us.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the matter?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can't move his legs,'' Karen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since when?''
</P>
<P>
   ``This morning. Says he ate too many pancakes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How many times has he stopped moving before?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Three or four. Where he comes from in China, he says,
everybody has it.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as he said, Mr. Chang couldn't lift his legs. His reflexes
_ ankle and knee jerks _ had disappeared as well. But his toes
betrayed a faint wiggle. The rest of his exam was completely
normal.
</P>
<P>
   Something was going wrong in Mr. Chang's ion channels. Millions
of them, staggeringly intricate in design and function, dot certain
cell membranes, and Mr. Chang's muscle cells weren't about to move
unless his nerves prompted their ion channels to spring open like
molecular sluice gates.
</P>
<P>
   For the channels to work, the cells must reach a certain
internal electrical charge. Only then will they let sodium and
calcium rush in and potassium rush out. This flow of ions
kick-starts the contractile proteins actin and myosin.
</P>
<P>
   Each type of ion channel allows only one particular ion, whether
potassium, sodium or calcium, to pass through. And each type of
channel opens at a different voltage. Yet the channels must act in
flawless harmony each time you so much as blink an eye.
</P>
<P>
   The key to restoring Mr. Chang's mobility was to create
conditions in the blood that would help the cells reach the
electrical charge they needed to fire. Getting his potassium to a
normal level would do the trick. But we had to act fast.
</P>
<P>
   Although the paralysis is usually partial and transient, I had
seen how quickly it could turn complete. Once I was on duty with an
attending physician who recognized the syndrome but then got busy
and didn't get around to checking the patient's potassium levels.
After a few hours, the nurse rushed over, shouting that the patient
wasn't breathing.
</P>
<P>
   Two anesthesiologists came charging down to intubate him. The
respirator assisted his failing diaphragm while we pumped potassium
down a nasogastric tube. He recovered, but it was a close call.
</P>
<P>
   ``Check his K,'' I told Rita. ``There are two versions of
periodic paralysis, one associated with low potassium, the other
high. If you give potassium to a high, you can really paralyze
him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So we wait for the lab results,'' Rita said, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``You bet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes the potassium go up or down?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knows. High-carbohydrate meals do stimulate insulin
secretion, which can push potassium into cells. But most of us
don't end up paralyzed after a binge at International House of
Pancakes,'' I explained.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Chang's potassium came back a startlingly low 1.5. Normal is
3.5 to 5 milliequivalents per liter. We gave him some potassium to
drink and sat back to watch.
</P>
<P>
   These strange paralytic conditions have been described for
nearly a century. Patients can often learn to prevent attacks by
avoiding strenuous exercise, which can cause swings in potassium
levels, and eating foods that are either high or low in potassium.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the new tools of molecular biology, researchers have
begun to tease out the genetic origins of diseases like the
periodic paralyses.
</P>
<P>
   A landmark 1990 study of a large family with a tendency toward
hyperkalemic (high-potassium) periodic paralysis helped identify
the mutation responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers decided to take a look at the gene that encodes the
sodium channel in muscle. By comparing the gene in family members
with and without the condition, they found the key difference. The
mutant gene causes one wrong amino acid to be inserted in the
proteins that form the channel, and that misfit amino acid causes
the channel to malfunction.
</P>
<P>
   A few years later, a similar slight change in the gene encoding
the calcium channel in muscle was linked to hypokalemic
(low-potassium) paralysis. But no one yet knows how it
malfunctions, nor how a defective calcium channel could cause low
levels of potassium in the blood.
</P>
<P>
   And other questions about the disorder remain. Why are men
affected three times more often than women? Why do some people with
the gene never show symptoms?
</P>
<P>
   Despite what we know about the genetics of the periodic
paralyses, the origins of the disease are far from fully
understood. For instance, just when the molecular details of
hypokalemic paralysis appeared locked up, researchers discovered a
family with normal calcium channels who still had symptoms of the
disease. The family's problem was caused by a different mutation.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even when the disease is caused by the same mutation, it can
provoke dramatically different degrees of illness.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours after his first dose of potassium, Mr. Chang lifted
his legs. We gave him another slug, and soon he was strolling about
the emergency room, none the worse for his episode of paralysis.
</P>
<P>
   A day later, Rita got ready to discharge Mr. Chang.
</P>
<P>
   ``See if he would like to try acetazolamide,'' I told her.
``It's a diuretic that seems to help by preventing potassium
shifts. And one more thing.'
</P>
<P>
   ``What?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell him to lay off the pancakes.''

   ``Can't move,'' said Rita, the new intern, after examining her
latest patient. ``Twenty-three-year-old Chinese male. Says his
brother has the same problem sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Her face scrunched up. She was stumped.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had it before?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you ever hear of familial periodic paralysis?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No.'' She frowned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither had I until my first case seven years ago. Pretty odd,
but very real.''
</P>
<P>
   There are thousands of Mendelian diseases, so called because
they are passed from parent to child in much the same way Gregor
Mendel's pea plants inherited traits such as color, height and
wrinkly pods.
</P>
<P>
   The periodic paralyses, a group of genetic diseases, are
autosomal dominant, so a child with one affected parent has a 50-50
chance of acquiring the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Although the conditions are not common _ they occur in roughly
one in 100,000 people _ certain ethnic groups have a higher
frequency of the mutations that cause them.
</P>
<P>
   Rita and I strolled over to her patient, Mr. Chang. On the way,
Karen, our translator, joined us.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the matter?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can't move his legs,'' Karen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since when?''
</P>
<P>
   ``This morning. Says he ate too many pancakes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How many times has he stopped moving before?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Three or four. Where he comes from in China, he says,
everybody has it.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as he said, Mr. Chang couldn't lift his legs. His reflexes
_ ankle and knee jerks _ had disappeared as well. But his toes
betrayed a faint wiggle. The rest of his exam was completely
normal.
</P>
<P>
   Something was going wrong in Mr. Chang's ion channels. Millions
of them, staggeringly intricate in design and function, dot certain
cell membranes, and Mr. Chang's muscle cells weren't about to move
unless his nerves prompted their ion channels to spring open like
molecular sluice gates.
</P>
<P>
   For the channels to work, the cells must reach a certain
internal electrical charge. Only then will they let sodium and
calcium rush in and potassium rush out. This flow of ions
kick-starts the contractile proteins actin and myosin.
</P>
<P>
   Each type of ion channel allows only one particular ion, whether
potassium, sodium or calcium, to pass through. And each type of
channel opens at a different voltage. Yet the channels must act in
flawless harmony each time you so much as blink an eye.
</P>
<P>
   The key to restoring Mr. Chang's mobility was to create
conditions in the blood that would help the cells reach the
electrical charge they needed to fire. Getting his potassium to a
normal level would do the trick. But we had to act fast.
</P>
<P>
   Although the paralysis is usually partial and transient, I had
seen how quickly it could turn complete. Once I was on duty with an
attending physician who recognized the syndrome but then got busy
and didn't get around to checking the patient's potassium levels.
After a few hours, the nurse rushed over, shouting that the patient
wasn't breathing.
</P>
<P>
   Two anesthesiologists came charging down to intubate him. The
respirator assisted his failing diaphragm while we pumped potassium
down a nasogastric tube. He recovered, but it was a close call.
</P>
<P>
   ``Check his K,'' I told Rita. ``There are two versions of
periodic paralysis, one associated with low potassium, the other
high. If you give potassium to a high, you can really paralyze
him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So we wait for the lab results,'' Rita said, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``You bet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes the potassium go up or down?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knows. High-carbohydrate meals do stimulate insulin
secretion, which can push potassium into cells. But most of us
don't end up paralyzed after a binge at International House of
Pancakes,'' I explained.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Chang's potassium came back a startlingly low 1.5. Normal is
3.5 to 5 milliequivalents per liter. We gave him some potassium to
drink and sat back to watch.
</P>
<P>
   These strange paralytic conditions have been described for
nearly a century. Patients can often learn to prevent attacks by
avoiding strenuous exercise, which can cause swings in potassium
levels, and eating foods that are either high or low in potassium.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the new tools of molecular biology, researchers have
begun to tease out the genetic origins of diseases like the
periodic paralyses.
</P>
<P>
   A landmark 1990 study of a large family with a tendency toward
hyperkalemic (high-potassium) periodic paralysis helped identify
the mutation responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers decided to take a look at the gene that encodes the
sodium channel in muscle. By comparing the gene in family members
with and without the condition, they found the key difference. The
mutant gene causes one wrong amino acid to be inserted in the
proteins that form the channel, and that misfit amino acid causes
the channel to malfunction.
</P>
<P>
   A few years later, a similar slight change in the gene encoding
the calcium channel in muscle was linked to hypokalemic
(low-potassium) paralysis. But no one yet knows how it
malfunctions, nor how a defective calcium channel could cause low
levels of potassium in the blood.
</P>
<P>
   And other questions about the disorder remain. Why are men
affected three times more often than women? Why do some people with
the gene never show symptoms?
</P>
<P>
   Despite what we know about the genetics of the periodic
paralyses, the origins of the disease are far from fully
understood. For instance, just when the molecular details of
hypokalemic paralysis appeared locked up, researchers discovered a
family with normal calcium channels who still had symptoms of the
disease. The family's problem was caused by a different mutation.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even when the disease is caused by the same mutation, it can
provoke dramatically different degrees of illness.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours after his first dose of potassium, Mr. Chang lifted
his legs. We gave him another slug, and soon he was strolling about
the emergency room, none the worse for his episode of paralysis.
</P>
<P>
   A day later, Rita got ready to discharge Mr. Chang.
</P>
<P>
   ``See if he would like to try acetazolamide,'' I told her.
``It's a diuretic that seems to help by preventing potassium
shifts. And one more thing.'
</P>
<P>
   ``What?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell him to lay off the pancakes.''

<P>
   The eastern face of the mountain is avalanche terrain. There are
no trees to anchor the snow. A screaming wind picks up even more
snow from the mountain's far side and deposits it onto a bulging
cornice that threatens to crack under its growing weight.
</P>
<P>
   The slope of this mountain in Davos, Switzerland, is steep _ 40
degrees. To ski it after a heavy snowstorm, you would have to be
either exceptionally unwise or an avalanche researcher. Four of the
latter _ Bob Brown, Ed Adams, Jim Dent and Karl Birkeland, of
Montana State University _ are making plans to do just that.
</P>
<P>
   Their destination is a plywood shack in the protective embrace
of a small rock outcropping _ directly in the path of an avalanche.
The structure is 9-by-6 feet, enough room, barely, for two
scientists (the rest retreat to the edge of the slide path), an
array of instrumentation, a gas-powered generator and one rather
nervous journalist.
</P>
<P>
   One of the men will ski to the top of the ridge, hoist four
pounds of explosives on a pulley out over the crown of the slope,
and light the fuse, sending vast amounts of snow down on his
colleagues' heads.
</P>
<P>
   Why do researchers risk their lives like this? In part, because
few other jobs require one to ski through some of the planet's most
reliably gorgeous scenery. And although there is an inescapable
sense that the danger itself is appealing, they do it to save
lives. The more that is known about the dynamics of avalanches, the
easier it becomes to accurately predict where, and how far, they'll
tumble.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't take a big avalanche to kill people _ the vast
majority of deaths occur in slides that run no farther than 200
yards.
</P>
<P>
   Avalanche debris is nothing like the airy, fresh-fallen snow of
skiers' dreams. The snow crystals in the debris pile left by an
avalanche are packed together so densely that they feel like
concrete.
</P>
<P>
   The snow that buries the typical victim is only 50 percent air,
as opposed to fresh snow, which is 80 percent air. You cannot move
_ or even expand your chest to breathe _ let alone dig your way
free.
</P>
<P>
   Suffocation is the means to the end in two-thirds of avalanche
deaths. The remaining third die from the trauma of being flung
against boulders and trees at speeds of up to 80 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Some victims are done in by their own breath, which condenses
and then freezes on their faces, forming an ice mask that slowly
cuts off what little air remains. Only one avalanche burial victim
in four lives to remember it ...
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Car four of the Davos Cable Car holds the regular assortment of
brightly hued skiers and teen-age snowboarders. But one man carries
no skis. It's Martin Schneebeli, the resident snowpack structures
expert, commuting to the field research area of the Swiss Federal
Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research in Davos.
</P>
<P>
   The research area is a series of cold labs at the top of a
mountain directly above the town.
</P>
<P>
   Three-quarters of the way up the mountain, Schneebeli, my guide
for the day, points out a patch of snow checkered with deep square
pits. These snow pits are the basic tools of avalanche prediction.
</P>
<P>
   The layers visible on the walls of the pits reveal the history
of the past few months' snowfalls. To determine avalanche risk,
forecasters visually assess these layers to ascertain the stability
of the resulting snowpack.
</P>
<P>
   In the world of avalanche prediction, weather calls the shots.
Spring thaws can weaken the bonds that form between crystals as the
snow melts and refreezes, paving the way for deadly, heavy, wet
snow avalanches.
</P>
<P>
   A strong sun will melt surface snow, which then refreezes at
night into an icy crust, off of which the next layer of snow can
easily slip.
</P>
<P>
   A similar slippery and fragile snow layer is something called
``surface hoar'' _ essentially a morning frost on top of the snow
that gets buried by more snow.
</P>
<P>
   Sharing top billing in the rogues' gallery of weak layers is a
wily meteorological entity known as ``depth hoar.'' In early
winter, when the ground is still warm, heated and moistened air
rises through the snow and cools into a layer of angular,
recalcitrant, depth-hoar crystals _ pretty to look at, but weak as
kittens.
</P>
<P>
   In a 32-degree Fahrenheit room in the Institute's field station,
researchers Charles Fierz and Thorsten Baunach create depth hoar in
a box to determine how quickly it grows under various snow and
weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
   In the corner are 12 cardboard Chiquita banana boxes filled with
snow. Fierz scoops some of it into a sieve and hands it to Baunach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we make a snowfall!'' Baunach says, grinning like a kid.
He shakes the sieve over a box to recreate inside the lab what has
been happening outside for the past 12 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Like a picky head chef, Fierz points to lumps in the mound of
sifted white: ``Try double sifting,'' he suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Fierz and Baunach will take snow samples from their boxes every
12 hours, as the snow's temperature rises from minus 4 to 30
degrees Fahrenheit. The snow is shallow _ only about 2.5 inches.
The shallower the snow, the steeper the temperature gradient
between the ground-warmed bottom (being played, in this case, by a
heated metal plate) and the air-chilled top of the snow. The warm
air rises, cools quickly and becomes frost crystals.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the shack, Ed Adams and Karl Birkeland are busy with
shovels, clearing space in the snow to lay down equipment that will
log the snow's temperature as the avalanche passes.
</P>
<P>
   I ask Adams what would happen if the avalanche let go on its own
while we were out here.
</P>
<P>
   ``See those flats?'' Adams points down the slope. ``You'll end
up down there.'' Brown sticks his head out of the shack. ``But
first, you'll have to go through those trees. That'll beat you up
real bad.''
</P>
<P>
   I ask Jim Dent what it's like in the shack during an avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just gets grayer,'' he says. ``I like to stick my hand out
into the avalanche as it goes by. It's like putting your hand into
a river.''
</P>
<P>
   He tells me that if I want a good view, I should climb up onto a
platform nailed to a tree 100 yards downhill and 30 feet to the
side of the slide path. So I do. From my perch, I watch Adams ski
up to the top, his backpack bulky with explosives. Then two other
researchers ski off to the side, much farther to the side than my
tree.
</P>
<P>
   The path from Adams to me looks like a straight line.
Apparently, the avalanche turns as it flows downhill. I try not to
think about it.
</P>
<P>
   Five, four, three, two ... A tumble of choppy white emerges from
beneath the bomb's sooty smoke cloud: Avalanche!
</P>
<P>
   Having only seen the slow-motion rendition of an avalanche, I'm
shocked at how fast it is. By the time the slide passes me, it has
spread and flattened itself out, becoming a rippling disturbance in
the snow. It's as though something had gotten under the mountain's
skin.
</P>
<P>
   There's an eerie quality to the sight: fallen snow, something
I've always thought of as stationary and benign, suddenly come to
life.
</P>
<P>
   Back up at the shack, Adams sits in the rubble, holding a
thermometer in the snow like a concerned mother. Brown is shaking
his head. He had hoped a 15-inch layer would break loose and slide.
It was considerably smaller.
</P>
<P>
   ``The snow set up too much,'' he says. ``It was too warm.''
</P>
<P>
   He sounds like a chef assessing a failed souffle. But Brown has
high hopes for another big slide before the season ends. It's late
February now, so he figures he's got one more shot at it. Or it's
got one more shot at him.

   ``Can't move,'' said Rita, the new intern, after examining her
latest patient. ``Twenty-three-year-old Chinese male. Says his
brother has the same problem sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Her face scrunched up. She was stumped.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had it before?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you ever hear of familial periodic paralysis?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No.'' She frowned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither had I until my first case seven years ago. Pretty odd,
but very real.''
</P>
<P>
   There are thousands of Mendelian diseases, so called because
they are passed from parent to child in much the same way Gregor
Mendel's pea plants inherited traits such as color, height and
wrinkly pods.
</P>
<P>
   The periodic paralyses, a group of genetic diseases, are
autosomal dominant, so a child with one affected parent has a 50-50
chance of acquiring the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Although the conditions are not common _ they occur in roughly
one in 100,000 people _ certain ethnic groups have a higher
frequency of the mutations that cause them.
</P>
<P>
   Rita and I strolled over to her patient, Mr. Chang. On the way,
Karen, our translator, joined us.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the matter?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can't move his legs,'' Karen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since when?''
</P>
<P>
   ``This morning. Says he ate too many pancakes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How many times has he stopped moving before?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Three or four. Where he comes from in China, he says,
everybody has it.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as he said, Mr. Chang couldn't lift his legs. His reflexes
_ ankle and knee jerks _ had disappeared as well. But his toes
betrayed a faint wiggle. The rest of his exam was completely
normal.
</P>
<P>
   Something was going wrong in Mr. Chang's ion channels. Millions
of them, staggeringly intricate in design and function, dot certain
cell membranes, and Mr. Chang's muscle cells weren't about to move
unless his nerves prompted their ion channels to spring open like
molecular sluice gates.
</P>
<P>
   For the channels to work, the cells must reach a certain
internal electrical charge. Only then will they let sodium and
calcium rush in and potassium rush out. This flow of ions
kick-starts the contractile proteins actin and myosin.
</P>
<P>
   Each type of ion channel allows only one particular ion, whether
potassium, sodium or calcium, to pass through. And each type of
channel opens at a different voltage. Yet the channels must act in
flawless harmony each time you so much as blink an eye.
</P>
<P>
   The key to restoring Mr. Chang's mobility was to create
conditions in the blood that would help the cells reach the
electrical charge they needed to fire. Getting his potassium to a
normal level would do the trick. But we had to act fast.
</P>
<P>
   Although the paralysis is usually partial and transient, I had
seen how quickly it could turn complete. Once I was on duty with an
attending physician who recognized the syndrome but then got busy
and didn't get around to checking the patient's potassium levels.
After a few hours, the nurse rushed over, shouting that the patient
wasn't breathing.
</P>
<P>
   Two anesthesiologists came charging down to intubate him. The
respirator assisted his failing diaphragm while we pumped potassium
down a nasogastric tube. He recovered, but it was a close call.
</P>
<P>
   ``Check his K,'' I told Rita. ``There are two versions of
periodic paralysis, one associated with low potassium, the other
high. If you give potassium to a high, you can really paralyze
him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So we wait for the lab results,'' Rita said, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``You bet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes the potassium go up or down?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knows. High-carbohydrate meals do stimulate insulin
secretion, which can push potassium into cells. But most of us
don't end up paralyzed after a binge at International House of
Pancakes,'' I explained.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Chang's potassium came back a startlingly low 1.5. Normal is
3.5 to 5 milliequivalents per liter. We gave him some potassium to
drink and sat back to watch.
</P>
<P>
   These strange paralytic conditions have been described for
nearly a century. Patients can often learn to prevent attacks by
avoiding strenuous exercise, which can cause swings in potassium
levels, and eating foods that are either high or low in potassium.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the new tools of molecular biology, researchers have
begun to tease out the genetic origins of diseases like the
periodic paralyses.
</P>
<P>
   A landmark 1990 study of a large family with a tendency toward
hyperkalemic (high-potassium) periodic paralysis helped identify
the mutation responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers decided to take a look at the gene that encodes the
sodium channel in muscle. By comparing the gene in family members
with and without the condition, they found the key difference. The
mutant gene causes one wrong amino acid to be inserted in the
proteins that form the channel, and that misfit amino acid causes
the channel to malfunction.
</P>
<P>
   A few years later, a similar slight change in the gene encoding
the calcium channel in muscle was linked to hypokalemic
(low-potassium) paralysis. But no one yet knows how it
malfunctions, nor how a defective calcium channel could cause low
levels of potassium in the blood.
</P>
<P>
   And other questions about the disorder remain. Why are men
affected three times more often than women? Why do some people with
the gene never show symptoms?
</P>
<P>
   Despite what we know about the genetics of the periodic
paralyses, the origins of the disease are far from fully
understood. For instance, just when the molecular details of
hypokalemic paralysis appeared locked up, researchers discovered a
family with normal calcium channels who still had symptoms of the
disease. The family's problem was caused by a different mutation.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even when the disease is caused by the same mutation, it can
provoke dramatically different degrees of illness.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours after his first dose of potassium, Mr. Chang lifted
his legs. We gave him another slug, and soon he was strolling about
the emergency room, none the worse for his episode of paralysis.
</P>
<P>
   A day later, Rita got ready to discharge Mr. Chang.
</P>
<P>
   ``See if he would like to try acetazolamide,'' I told her.
``It's a diuretic that seems to help by preventing potassium
shifts. And one more thing.'
</P>
<P>
   ``What?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell him to lay off the pancakes.''

IT STARTS WITH A SEED ....

(Eds: With GARDEN-STARTING-SEEDS and GARDEN-STARTING-CATALOGS) 
 
 
By CAROL BIDWELL 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So you've never even planted a petunia ... but those six-packs
of flowers and veggies are beginning to beckon you from the
nursery. You picked up a magazine at the dentist's office the other
day, looked at the colorful photos and really considered, just for
a minute, putting in a primrose border.
</P>
<P>
   The yen to plant, as any seasoned gardener will tell you, is one
of the primal urges that strikes about this time every year. It's
why home and garden centers are filled on the weekends with people
pushing empty carts and wandering aimlessly through the greenery.
</P>
<P>
   There are those tantalizing terms: mulch, compost, bare-root,
ground cover, high-nitrogen whatever.
</P>
<P>
   It would be easy for a novice to just set down the watering can
and slowly back away. But gardening isn't brain surgery or rocket
science; it's not even algebra. Even novices who wouldn't know a
trowel from a teacup can actually put plants in the ground and
watch then bloom and flourish.
</P>
<P>
   A garden, after all, is built like a fixer-upper mountain cabin;
season by season, success upon success and, yes, failure upon
failure. You learn what works and what doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best places to start is with the colorful garden
catalogs that begin to appear in your mailbox, the ones you can use
that pesky little card in magazines or the Internet to send for. If
you're ready to explore the wonderful world of getting your hands
dirty, you can order seeds, plants, roots, rhizomes and corms. If
you're still a bit timid, all those beautiful pictures of blooming
flowers and bursting-with-flavor veggies can give you just the
nudge you need to at least buy a big pot, fill it with soil and
stick in a few seeds.
</P>
<P>
   But before you run off to the North 40 in your megawave of
enthusiasm, think for a moment about the garden you hope to have.
Here are a few things to consider:
</P>
<P>
   How big a garden can you accommodate? No matter what size your
garden is, you can probably find a spot for a few tomato plants, at
the very least. And while most garden books advocate planting
vegetables in rows, some garden experts recommend using spaces as
small as 1 square foot (that'll hold a cabbage, a couple of heads
of lettuce, a few carrots, or a salad bowl full of green onions) to
plant in.
</P>
<P>
   A tiny but productive plot means no more getting tired before
you finish hoeing to the end of a row. Pull a few weeds from this
tiny patch today and that one tomorrow; water on the same staggered
schedule, and you've taken the tedium out of gardening.
</P>
<P>
   Want a bigger garden? Simply plant more tiny plots. Their small
size makes them easier to weed and harvest; you can separate them
with stepping stones, a wooden walkway, layers of old newspapers or
gravel.
</P>
<P>
   How much sun is available? Even in shady yards, there are
usually a few spots that get sun for several hours. That's where
you can plant your sun-loving vegetables like tomatoes and
zucchini, and flowers like snapdragons, petunias and day lilies. If
you can find a spot that gets at least six hours of sunshine in the
morning, that's where roses will be happy. Shady spots are the
places to plant impatiens, violets, coleus and other shade-loving
flowers. Cool-season vegetables like lettuces and other greens
often last into warmer weather if grown in a shady location.
</P>
<P>
   How much time will you spend gardening? If you're an indifferent
weeder or waterer, it's a waste of time and money to plant a big
garden that'll burn to a crisp for want of care in the summer sun.
Many novice gardeners have trouble containing their enthusiasm when
the first seedlings appear in the nursery, but consider your
gardening style before overcommitting yourself. If you know that in
August you'll be too lazy to do more than water a single container,
that should guide your planting.
</P>
<P>
   Is your garden to eat, or to admire? If you yearn for vases of
fresh-cut flowers for your dining table or desk, a flower garden is
what you want. If sinking your teeth into a home-grown tomato is
your thing, go for veggies. Or you can do both _ together. There's
no law that says you can't plant flowers and veggies side by side.
Leaf lettuce, in colors ranging from burgundy to light green, makes
a lush background for many low-growing spring flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Plants or seeds? It takes lots of patience to plant seeds, which
is why so many of us opt instead for seedlings from the nursery.
Many seed lovers get their gardens going early, planting seeds
indoors under grow lights, but that takes a good deal of inside
space and a commitment in time all its own. On the other hand, you
can buy many more varieties of seeds from seed catalogs than you
can find plants already growing in the nursery. If you'd like to
try gourmet beets, Asian cucumbers or heirloom varieties of
tomatoes, seeds are probably your best bet.
</P>
<P>
   How's the land? Is the area you plan to plant nice and flat, or
full of rocks that'll need to be hauled off, full of gopher holes
that must be filled in, or bumpy and hilly and in need of
smoothing? Is the ground workable, or hard as a brick and in need
of mulch, compost or other amendments? Check with your local
University of California Extension office for information on
analyzing your soil.
</P>
<P>
   What's your theme? Before you plant, decide whether you'd like
an English cottage garden, one filled with herbs, a rose garden, a
yardful of native plants, a container garden or expanses of grass
with a flowery border.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be afraid to be creative. You don't have to hide the herbs
near the kitchen door; put them in the front yard with roses and
other flowers where your guests can enjoy the fragrance as they
walk up the path.
</P>
<P>
   Enjoying the garden? Are you planning to plant a wilderness of
native plants you can wander through? A formal garden with benches
to rest on? Are dirt paths sufficient, or do you want to outline
them with rocks or bricks? Would stepping stones add to the
ambience, or a brick walkway? What about a sundial, a gazing ball,
a bird bath or statuary? Check out local garden shops to see what's
available.
</P>
<P>
   Then get back to those waiting garden catalogs. Every gardener's
got to start somewhere.

<P>
   If you're one of those thrifty folk who saves seeds of a
favorite variety from one year to the next, it's a good idea to
make sure your seeds are still viable. From Burpee, here's how-to
information:
</P>
<P>
   Wrap a few seeds in a moist paper towel, and enclose the towel
in a plastic bag. (Label the bag if you'll be testing more than one
variety.) Place the bag in a warm location and check the seeds
after a week. If none of the seeds has begun to sprout, throw them
all out and order new seeds. If only one or two of the seeds have
germinated, either throw them all out or sow them thickly to make
sure you'll have enough seedlings.

</P>
<P>
   &UR; By JUDITH SHULEVITZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What scares people about the trial going on in London over
whether Jewish historian Deborah Lipstadt libeled Holocaust denier
David Irving by calling him a liar is that British law requires
Lipstadt to show that her statement was true. If she can't prove
beyond a doubt that the Holocaust took place, Irving might win.
</P>
<P>
   That would be a devastating blow to historical accuracy if it
happens, but I think it won't. There's a lot of truth on Lipstadt's
side, and very little on Irving's.
</P>
<P>
   Lipstadt has one of the best lawyers in London and is planning
to call several heavyweight scholars to testify.
</P>
<P>
   Irving, on the other hand, is acting as his own lawyer and so
far has named very few witnesses and experts, none of whom anyone
has ever heard of.
</P>
<P>
   If Irving doesn't appear to be taking the necessary steps to
win, why else might he have brought the lawsuit? For publicity, is
the obvious answer--to air his own views, as well as those of his
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   And that's what scares us. Irving's claim that there were no gas
chambers at Auschwitz is bad enough, but since it bears directly on
the question of his truthfulness, it will be refuted on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   Irving's experts, on the other hand, are being called to testify
on issues tangential to the case, and their twisted theories could
well go unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   One expert, John Fox, the former editor of a British Holocaust
journal, will probably argue that Lipstadt and the Jews are trying
to shut down free discussion of the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Irving's other expert is an American professor named Kevin
MacDonald, whose ideas about Jews have almost no relevance to the
case but represent the broadest, ugliest, and most vicious
anti-Semitism passing for scholarship in this country today.
</P>
<P>
   We know more or less what McDonald will say on the stand,
because he recently put a copy of his written statement to the
British court on the Internet. The bulk of his testimony will be a
summary of his three books about Jews:
</P>
<P>
   --A People That Shall Dwell Alone: Judaism as a Group
Evolutionary Strategy (Praeger, 1994).
</P>
<P>
   --Separation and Discontents: Toward an Evolutionary Theory of
Anti-Semitism (Praeger, 1998).
</P>
<P>
   --The Culture of Critique: An Evolutionary Analysis of Jewish
Involvement in Twentieth-Century Intellectual and Political
Movements (Praeger, 1998).
</P>
<P>
   Here is what he says in them--in my words, not his. (To read a
fuller account of his books, go to his Web page
http://www.csulb.edu/~kmacd/. That's a tilde in front of
``kmacd.'')
</P>
<P>
   MacDonald's central thesis is that Judaism is best understood
not as a religion but as a blueprint for an experiment in
eugenics--a ``group evolutionary strategy,'' he calls it--designed
to maximize a single trait: intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   For thousands of years, he says, Jews have separated themselves
from their neighbors, choosing to confine themselves to a closed
society with strict rules against marrying outside the group. They
have lived by policies of extreme group loyalty and obedience to
rabbinical authority, which served to maintain their racial purity;
and they practiced low-birth-rate, high-investment parenting, which
is the royal road to a high group I.Q.
</P>
<P>
   They conferred social status (which brings along with it the
most desirable women) on men according to their brilliance--indeed,
says MacDonald, study of the Talmud was nothing more than a
casuistic exercise meant to weed out the dim.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, their highly developed genes for mental and verbal
acuity, as well as their social aggression (also carefully
bred-in), gave the Jews powerful tools that enable them to dominate
neighboring ethnic groups in the endless war of all against all for
food and resources.
</P>
<P>
   In his second book, MacDonald explains why Jews have encountered
so much anti-Semitism for so many years: It was justified. Gentiles
reacted to Jews the way any group of animals on the veldt would
when confronted with a group of superior animals likely to
challenge them successfully for control of the available
resources--they tried to destroy the Jews before the Jews destroyed
them.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most extreme forms of anti-Semitism, such as Nazism,
can be seen not as aberrations but as ``a mirror image'' of
Judaism, with its emphasis on creating a master race. (MacDonald
does not deny that the Holocaust occurred, but he appears to think
it was rooted in an immutable biological chain reaction that the
Jews set off.) Faced with the hatred of gentiles, Jews have often
resorted to a ``strategy of crypsis''--that is, they have pretended
not to be Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Do the Jews themselves realize what they're up to? MacDonald
goes back and forth on this point; one moment he'll chastise Jews
for believing their own religious rationalizations, the next he'll
explain that they can't help it--they're genetically ``prone to
self-deception.''
</P>
<P>
   In his third book, MacDonald takes on what he calls the
``Jewish'' intellectual movements of the 20th century, from
psychoanalysis to Marxism to ``Boasian anthropology'' and ``the
Frankfurt School of social research.''
</P>
<P>
   His argument is that the ideas of secular Jewish intellectuals
are merely a device to promote tolerance of the Jewish presence by
gentiles--so that the Jews can more efficiently pursue their
nefarious agenda of systematic breeding and control of resources. A
good example of this is cultural anthropology: Its Jewish founder,
Franz Boas, shifted the focus of anthropology away from Darwinism
and eugenicism and toward the study of culture in order to bring an
end to the criticism of Jews as a race.
</P>
<P>
   Even if an intellectual movement (such as liberalism) was
founded by non-Jews, the minute Jews join it, they'll take it over,
because their ancestral history predisposes them to form ``highly
cohesive groups'': ``Intellectual activity is like any other human
endeavor: Cohesive groups outcompete individualist strategies.''
</P>
<P>
   Ideas that MacDonald identifies as Jewish, he invariably finds
to be not only subtly self-interested but also repellent by any
ordinary (which is to say gentile) moral or intellectual standard.
Freud ``conceptualized himself as a leader in a war on gentile
culture.'' When Stephen Jay Gould and Richard Lewontin expressed
doubts about sociobiology back in the 1970s, their approach
exemplified the kind of ``skeptical thrust of Jewish intellectual
activity'' that results in Jewish ``nihilistic anti-science.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of the third book, MacDonald lays out his
solution for restoring what he calls ``parity'' between the Jews
and other ethnic groups: systematic discrimination against Jews in
college admission and employment and heavy taxation of Jews ``to
counter the Jewish advantage in the possession of wealth.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not a coincidence that MacDonald spends much of his time
in his third book attacking the enemies of Darwinism and
sociobiology--or evolutionary psychology, as it is usually called
today. MacDonald identifies himself as an evolutionary
psychologist, and indeed, most prominent figures in the field would
at least know his name.
</P>
<P>
   But, remarkably, to my knowledge, no American evolutionary
psychologist has publicly objected to his work. This is not to say
that it has been celebrated. A man in his 50s, MacDonald is still
an associate professor of psychology at a third-rate school,
California State University in Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   But much more important to an academic than his title is his
standing among his peers, and there MacDonald is on firmer ground:
He's the secretary, archivist, newsletter editor, and executive
board member of the professional organization, the Human Behavior
and Evolution Society (HBES), to which the majority of America's
leading evolutionary psychologists belong.
</P>
<P>
   He edits a small journal called Population and Environment. And
the three books summarized above appeared in a series edited by
Seymour Iztkoff, a well-known if extremely conservative scholar of
the genetics of intelligence at Smith College.
</P>
<P>
   Are MacDonald's peers aware of what he's writing in the name of
a field long accused of fostering--unfairly, many of them would
say; by Jews, MacDonald would say--sexist and racist stereotypes?
Do other evolutionary psychologists have an opinion on MacDonald?
</P>
<P>
   I called several well-known members of HBES, specifying in voice
messages that I was writing an article about MacDonald. Very few
returned the phone calls, but those who did said they'd never read
his Jewish trilogy.
</P>
<P>
   At least two scholars said they had read papers of his on other
subjects and found them ``muddled.''
</P>
<P>
   When I described MacDonald's books to them, they expressed shock
and said he contradicted the basic principles of contemporary
evolutionary psychology. ``The notion that Jews are a genetically
distinct group doesn't make it on the basis of modern population
genetics,'' said John Tooby, a professor of psychology at the
University of California at Santa Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   Also, he said, ``group-selection theory''--the idea that natural
selection can occur at the level of a group (such as a bunch of
Jews) as opposed to individuals--was debunked in the 1960s, and
though some scholars are working to bring group-selection theory
back, it remains a minoritarian view.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone in the field is as critical as Tooby, however. A
review praising MacDonald's first book appeared in the HBES journal
four years ago; the author, John Hartung, a professor at the State
University of New York and a former secretary of HBES, concluded
that the Holocaust, ``the most enormous act of reactive racism ever
perpetrated,'' had been misrepresented as an unjustified evil so as
to cow non-Jews into looking the other way while Jews ``purloin''
land in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lingua Franca, which covered the incident, the only
reaction to Hartung's review was a ``tepid'' letter by the
journal's editor saying he didn't realize that it could be
offensive, and an outright defense of Hartung by HBES's
then-president, Dick Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   As for MacDonald, the author of the book that inspired these
remarks, there was apparently no effort by anyone in HBES to refute
him or to challenge the appropriateness of having him serve in so
many key positions.
</P>
<P>
   On the contrary. MacDonald thanks several prominent evolutionary
psychologists in the acknowledgments to his trilogy. Among them is
David Sloane Wilson, the leading advocate of group-selection
theory. (Wilson and Itzkoff, the editor of the series in which
MacDonald's books published, did not return phone calls.)
</P>
<P>
   Can we blame the field of evolutionary psychology for Kevin
MacDonald? Intellectually speaking, no, or at least not exactly.
Evolutionary psychology is a fairly new endeavor trying to overcome
an extremely disturbing past, and you can't make serious scholars
accountable for all the discredited notions their peers cling to.
</P>
<P>
   But we can hold specific academics responsible--Itzkoff comes to
mind--and we can ask what on earth the officers of HBES were
thinking when they allowed MacDonald to become such an active
member of their organization.
</P>
<P>
   If the response to Hartnung's review is any indication, they
would probably say that they don't believe in censoring their
members. But it is the job of a scholarly association not just to
foster discussion but also to police the boundaries of its
discipline.
</P>
<P>
   When this evolutionary psychologist and HBES officer testifies
in the Irving trial, he is bound to get his counterparts in a lot
of trouble. In many ways, they deserve it.

THE IN-YOUR-FACE ART OF BARBARA KRUGER
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
 
 
 
 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As you wend your way through the emotional gantlet that is the
Museum of Contemporary Art's ``Barbara Kruger'' exhibition, you
enter a long, narrow room where human rage is literally bouncing
off the walls At the far end, six projected talking heads spew
wounded accusations and nasty invective at unsuspecting onlookers.
The verbal onslaught stops you dead in your tracks. The dim
lighting underscores your sense of psychological dislocation.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few seconds, the room seems to be closing in, and the
epigrams splashed across its interior _ some angrily menacing,
others coolly mocking _ make you feel as if you'd accidentally
strayed onto a shooting range with a bull's eye pinned to your
back.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's words, not .38-caliber rounds, that constitute
the fusillades in a Barbara Kruger show.
</P>
<P>
   Funny words. Provocatively ugly words. Discordantly truthful
words that usually emanate from an ambiguous speaker (``We'') and
explode outward before lodging themselves in an amorphous ``You.''
</P>
<P>
   Words that seem to have been lifted, oozing anxiety and
resentment, from a festering collective unconscious. Words that
make you question. Words that make you want to run for your life.
</P>
<P>
   What sort of mind would devise this assaultive audio-visual
funhouse? Who is this woman whose barbed maxims (``I shop therefore
I am,'' ``Your body is a battleground'') have been smeared across
T-shirts and tote bags as if they were toothpaste ads?
</P>
<P>
   And does she truly believe that if we see our fears and biases
hauled kicking and screaming to the surface like this, we may
someday repudiate them and learn to treat each other decently?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, she truly does.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really is something interesting in the Golden Rule, in
terms of `Do unto others as you would have others do unto you,'''
Kruger says in her warm, forthright manner. ``That's an old
chestnut, but it really works.''
</P>
<P>
   That might sound like a pretty plain-vanilla message coming from
an L.A.-based artist considered a paragon of pop-culture
sophistication.
</P>
<P>
   Bear in mind, however, that Kruger's vision, for all its
subtlety, is in some ways a monochromatic one. What's black and
white and read all over? Why, just about any of the 70 works in
``Barbara Kruger,'' which runs through Feb. 13 at the MOCA's Geffen
Contemporary space on the edge of Little Tokyo in downtown Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Socking viewers right between the eyes, these images and objects
may seem strangely familiar: A woman holding a magnifying glass,
bracketed by the caption, ``It's a Small World'' and the
smile-inducing tagline, ``but not if you have to clean it.''
</P>
<P>
   A picture of a goofy, bug-eyed hand puppet with the doubtful
injunction, ``Buy me _ I'll change your life.''
</P>
<P>
   A grainy photo of a panicked bridegroom surrounded by his
laughing friends, spatially subdivided by an inscription that reads
like a fortune cookie with an attitude: ``You construct intricate
rituals which allow you to touch the skin of other men.''
</P>
<P>
   Most succinctly, a billboard hovering in downtown Melbourne,
Australia, with this all-purpose aphorism: ``Don't be a jerk.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of Kruger's quarter-century career, these and
other distinctive fusions of image and text etched in a tilted
Futura Bold typeface have become almost as recognizable in
contemporary art circles as a Fortune 500 logo. They've appeared on
billboards and in bus shelters, on gallery walls and coffee mugs.
</P>
<P>
   A former commercial graphic designer, art director and picture
editor for Mademoiselle and House and Garden magazines, Kruger, 55,
has eagerly co-opted the tools of consumer culture to coin her
trademark visual epigrams. She takes the inaudible sign language
previously used to sell Edsels and refrigerators, slices it into
visual sound bites and weaves it together with images to form her
neo-constructivist collages.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 10 years, Kruger has produced a number of
large-scale installations, inflating her words and pictures to the
scale of architectural environments that take up entire walls or
rooms. MOCA's exhibition also includes her early photo collages and
another series focusing on images of public figures such as Marilyn
Monroe and Malcolm X.
</P>
<P>
   Having come of age artistically during the first wave of
feminism in the 1970s, Kruger has devoted much of her career to
exploring Madison Avenue and Hollywood's depictions of sexuality
and identity, the cliches and archetypes that are beamed daily into
our brains.
</P>
<P>
   While her art is designed to get in your face and upside your
head, once you step back and take a deep breath you realize that
Kruger wants to engage her audience rather than simply confront it.
</P>
<P>
   Although most of her work implicitly interrogates the powers
that be and the moral status quo, Kruger rejects ``political'' as a
description of her art. Her targets, it appears, aren't politicians
or institutions per se, but bigoted stereotyping, self-righteous
moralizing and serial cruelty in any form.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really almost never use the term political,'' she says. ``I
do make art about power, for sure. But whenever people say
`political' I usually ask, `What do you mean by that?' Because it
tends to narrow the discourse. And I think that all ways of using
or changing notions of power can happen in a million ways everyday.
I think that we can change those, quote, politics, in our everyday
lives, just by how we conduct ourselves with other human beings.''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, despite her accessibility and popularity, Kruger hasn't
always been welcomed by major U.S. museums. MOCA's show, which
covers her career from 1978 to the present, is her first-ever major
solo exhibition in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``This museum (MOCA) has always been the one museum to really
support me,'' Kruger says evenly. ``For me it was such a gift to be
able to work in that space. It's the best space in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Although she has kept an apartment in New York's TriBeCa
neighborhood for decades, Kruger now spends 10 months of the year
at her Los Angeles home. At times she misses ``the density in New
York,'' the way ``people are packed together, passing each other on
the street.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a forced socialness, which I think is good for
people,'' she observes.
</P>
<P>
   But she says she's grown partial to L.A., its warm winters and
disjointed landscapes. We're also the city that inadvertently
coined the phrase that resounds throughout ``Barbara Kruger'':
Can't we all just get along?
</P>
<P>
   Wonder how would that look on a coffee mug. &QL;

IS THERE A ROBOT IN THE HOUSE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LISA GUTIERREZ  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Her name is Flo and she is a nurse unlike any you have ever met.
</P>
<P>
   She can perform ``nurse'' duties. Remind you to take your
medicine. Take your vital signs and even e-mail them to your
doctor. If she does a good job, though, don't bother patting her on
the back, because Flo doesn't respond to such positive
reinforcement.
</P>
<P>
   She is a robot, a robo nurse.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers from the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon
University in Pennsylvania have created Flo, a personal service
robot, to serve as nurse and companion to elderly and housebound
patients. Still a prototype, Flo is not available yet to the
public. Researchers working to equip her with other humanlike
skills _ like being able to open jars or bottles for arthritis
patients _ expect her to evolve greatly in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   All of which sounds very ``Jetson''-esque, but not everyone
likes the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may open cans. It may remind someone on the screen to take
their medications. But it cannot hold a hand. It cannot make eye
contact. It cannot touch,'' says Carol Bentley, a nurse currently
caring for a housebound 60-year-old Shawnee Mission woman with
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she (her patient) were in her last moments, she can feel my
hand, she can feel my presence. If the family can't be there, I can
be here, one human being with another. I am not a machine. I am a
warm, caring human being.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Flo or not, technology is already changing the way health
care is delivered to the homebound. Giving a whole new meaning to
the words ``house calls,'' doctors can listen to a patient's
heartbeat long distance and even regulate a pacemaker through a
phonelike device.
</P>
<P>
   TV screens set up in a patient's home can allow a nurse in an
office miles away to monitor symptoms or help a diabetes patient
read the tiny, hard-to-see hash marks on an insulin syringe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think this (technology) is going to be commonplace
soon,'' says Carol Smith, a professor in the School of Nursing at
the University of Kansas Medical Center, who consulted on the Flo
project last month.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, whose expertise is home health care, recently received a
multimillion-dollar grant from the National Institutes of Health to
research how to use ``telehealth'' monitors in the homes of rural
elderly patients who use ventilators or hook themselves up to
catheters overnight.
</P>
<P>
   She and Flo's designers believe that robots could make life
easier for one of the fastest growing populations in America _
elderly people. About 6.5 million senior citizens need assistance
with their daily living activities, according to the Assisted
Living Federation of America in Fairfax, Va. That number is
expected to double by 2020.
</P>
<P>
   Flo, who stands about 4 feet with big, goggle eyes,
Groucho-esque metal eyebrows and a computer screen for a tummy, is
helping researchers understand how autonomous mobile robots _ think
robot maid Rosie from the ``Jetsons'' or R2-D2 from ``Star Wars'' _
can interact with humans to improve their lives.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the Nursebot _ Flo's official name _ can follow an
elderly patient around the house, preventing them from getting
lost. Using the Internet and Flo's two-way screen, patients can
communicate with their nurses and physicians. Flo can even call for
help in case of a medical emergency.
</P>
<P>
   ``As baby-boomers age, they are computer literate ... they have
already embraced computers and they are not going to see this as
out of the ordinary,'' predicts Cindy Keim, a registered nurse and
director of operations for Home Health Plus of Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   All this new technology ``allows patients to be independent and
function at their highest level, which people want to do,'' Keim
said. ``They don't want to be in a position where they can't take
care of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``From an agency's point of view, instead of sending a nurse 20
miles away, they can actually call and talk to their patient, and
see more patients in a day. You don't want to put all your patients
on this, though. You would never be able to do this with patients
who are not stable.''
</P>
<P>
   Keim admits that one challenge of using all this new technology
is helping some seniors over their fear of high-tech tools. And
when nurse Bentley considers the worth of Flo and other high-tech
kin sure to come, she wonders how expensive robots will be and
whether everyone will have access to them. (There's no word yet on
how much Flo would cost.)
</P>
<P>
   No matter how smart you make a pile of nuts and bolts, it still
can't replace the flesh-and-blood nurse, insists Bentley, who works
for Elder Care of Kansas City. And even Smith, the researcher,
agrees on that point.
</P>
<P>
   The last few weeks Bentley has been taking care of Christine
Braughton, a widow with ovarian cancer so weakened by chemotherapy
treatments that she has been bedridden since last August.
</P>
<P>
   Braughton spends her days lying on a bed in her living room, in
the company of home-health nurses during the day and nuns who
volunteer to stay with her overnight. She does not like the idea of
robot nurses.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, a robot can't cook, Braughton points out. And
what kind of companion would it be ``because you couldn't talk with
them,'' wondered Braughton, whose own voice now is weak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you ever tried to hug a metal box, Christine?'' Bentley
asked her patient. ``Unless it was a refrigerator?'' And both women
laughed.

2000 years later--Jerusalem has spent millions to properly welcome
this year's Christian pilgrims 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(With art) By Richard Irwin 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM -- As I reached out to touch the wall, I felt the
presence of God. Tears welled up in my eyes as I prayed for my
family and friends at the Wailing Wall here. I began to believe
that this was indeed a very special place, where prayers rose
straight to the Lord.
</P>
<P>
   I experienced a similar feeling in the Temple of the Mount, one
of the holiest sites in the Islamic religion. As I touched the rock
from which Mohammed is believed to have descended to heaven, I felt
another spiritual presence.
</P>
<P>
   A religious pilgrimage was one of my main reasons for visiting
Israel. As a Christian, I had always wanted to visit the places
where Jesus walked and taught and died.
</P>
<P>
   The Jewish state has geared up for an influx of tourists in
this, the 2000th year since Christ's birth. Only the size of New
Jersey, Israel is expecting double, perhaps triple, the usual
number of visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the events which took place in my country 2,000 years
ago which literally were to change the world,'' said Arie Sommer,
Israel tourism spokesman, ``at the same time as it was to transform
the way we count time.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, Israel has invested $300 million to
improve tourist sites for the new century. Existing facilities have
been expanded, and many new rest rooms, restaurants and rest areas
have been built. Efforts are also being made to extend visiting
hours at the many museums and attractions.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is being done, according to Moshe Katzav, deputy
prime minister and minister of tourism, because ``the Holy Land, as
the birthplace of Jesus and the three monotheistic religions, is
expected to be the chosen place for millions of pilgrims to
celebrate the beginning of the new millennium.'' The Israeli
Ministry of Tourism is anticipating 4 million visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Upon arrival at Ben Gurion International Airport, located
between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, visitors will find a site completed
in the past year, a giant free-form menorah designed by the late
Franco-Spanish artist Salvador Dali. Sitting outside the main
entrance to the central terminal, the menorah bears Dali's
inscription ``I wish you to see in the radiance of these clear and
joyous lights an homage to your people.''
</P>
<P>
   Most tourists will then take the 45-minute drive to Jerusalem, a
3,000- year-old metropolis that is being revitalized. As they climb
up from the coastal plain, tourists will glimpse a grand city
clinging to the Judean Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting at an altitude of 3,000 feet, Jerusalem offers crisp,
dry air, with warm days and cool nights. Not quite the hot, arid
desert that many visitors expect.
</P>
<P>
   Tourists may also be surprised to find that everything is built
from age-old limestone. In 1920, one of the first decrees of the
new British regime was that all construction in Jerusalem be of
local stone. The law has been retained to this day.
</P>
<P>
   Far from a monochromatic city, the buildings glow with a patina
ranging from cream to gold to pink as the sun makes its rounds.
</P>
<P>
   The first images of Jerusalem are often of the Old City, whose
16th- century walls enclose the holy places of Judaism,
Christianity and Islam. And, indeed, the Old City is still lined
with hundreds of busy stores, stalls and bazaars much as it was in
the days of Solomon and Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   The Old City was all there was until the mid-19th century. Begun
in the 1860s, the new city of Jerusalem now spreads over an area 20
times larger than the original one.
</P>
<P>
   The capital of a modern state, it is home to close to three
quarters of a million people. Jerusalem truly is unique, with many
cultures and religions blending together. Where else would you find
black-clad men and boys with long sideburn locks hurrying to
synagogue, while in the background church bells and the muezzin
call their faithful to prayer?
</P>
<P>
   But it is the history of the city that draws tourists to
Jerusalem, a beacon for billions of people around the world.
</P>
<P>
   When Jesus of Nazareth was born 2,000 years ago, it was the year
3760 of the Jewish calendar. King David had proclaimed Jerusalem
capital of Israel 10 centuries earlier. And in 2100, Abraham had
received the Covenant from God atop the city's Mount Moriah.
</P>
<P>
   Little wonder that the Jewish state calls itself ``The Land
Where Time Began.'' The actual dating of Jesus' birth as year 1 was
proclaimed in the fourth century at the Council of Nicacea,
following the Roman Empire's adoption of Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   As travelers approach the Old City, they can't help but be
impressed by the massive ramparts built to protect it. Constructed
by Suleiman the Magnificent from 1536 to 1542, Jerusalem's walls
are some of the most complete medieval city walls standing anywhere
in the world today.
</P>
<P>
   As with public projects throughout history, there were a few
problems. When Suleiman discovered that the new city walls left
Mount Zion, with its tomb of King David and Room of the Last
Supper, outside the ramparts, he was so angry that he ordered the
architects and engineers hanged from the new walls.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers still guard the gates, this time searching for
terrorists. During my visit, a bomb went off a few blocks from my
hotel, but I only found out about it from the television news and
the newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   I had expected a police state with machine-gun-toting soldiers
everywhere. Instead, I found soldiers casually manning strategic
checkpoints. The police were much more evident.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone just went about their regular business, so I went about
mine. Overall, I felt safe. Safe enough that friends and I would
venture out at night.
</P>
<P>
   Special lighting has been installed on the walls and monuments
of the Old City, making an evening walk breathtaking. The
magnificent wall can be seen glistening from many miles away in the
soft darkness of a Jerusalem night.
</P>
<P>
   Be sure to walk along the stone ramparts during the day. The
stone catwalks give visitors a chance to see what it must have been
like for the Crusaders defending the city.
</P>
<P>
   The Ramparts Walk has been renovated, providing new access
points at the Citadel, the Jaffa Gate and the Damascus Gate. The
footpaths have been refurbished, with loose paving stones
strengthened, and handles and ladders repainted.
</P>
<P>
   The views from the towers are spectacular. New signs explain the
ancient architecture, which includes spires, minarets and bell
towers. Looking outside the Old City, visitors have panoramic
vistas of Mount Zion, the Mount of Olives and the Garden of
Gethsemane.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the city wall, the Tower of David Museum occupies the
superbly restored Citadel that guarded the western entrance to
Jerusalem throughout history. This excellent museum illustrates
Jerusalem's eventful history through state-of-the-art displays and
exhibits.
</P>
<P>
   It brings 4,000 years of history to life -- from the life of
King David, who united the children of Israel, to his son, King
Solomon, who built the First Temple and a home for the Ark of the
Covenant. Other exhibits trace the life of Jesus and the adoption
of Christianity by the Roman world, while many displays unveil the
Moslem conquest of the Middle East and the Crusaders' battles to
recapture the Holy City.
</P>
<P>
   The animated film ``Jerusalem'' tells the history through humor
and is a good beginning. The 14-minute film is in Hebrew with
English translations.
</P>
<P>
   Guided tours are included in the entrance fee, with the English
tour beginning at 11 a.m. Sunday through Friday. Personal audio
guides are also available in English.
</P>
<P>
   A sound-and-light show is offered in the evenings, presenting
4,000 years of history in 40 minutes in the courtyard. The shows
are held Monday, Wednesday and Saturday in various languages.
</P>
<P>
   King Herod's palace once stood on this site, and many scholars
believe it was in his palace, now hidden beneath the Citadel, that
Jesus was tried and sentenced to death. From here, Jesus walked to
Calvary, where he was crucified.
</P>
<P>
   Winding its way through the Old City's Muslim and Christian
quarters, the Via Dolorosa follows the route along which the
condemned Jesus carried the cross. Fourteen chapels, each called a
Station of the Cross, commemorate incidents from the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   The stations have been refaced, and special lighting now
illuminates the path. While other streets in the Old City have been
repaved with modern materials, the Via Dolorosa has been paved with
cobblestones.
</P>
<P>
   Paving stones from the Herodian period, unearthed earlier from
beneath the surface, have been incorporated in this new surface.
Thus, pilgrims walking in the footsteps of Jesus are actually
walking on stones from that very age.
</P>
<P>
   Just as in Jesus' day, the route traverses the bustling markets,
and it is difficult to reflect on Christ's last journey when
children and merchants are hawking cheap souvenirs. I spent more
time fending off salesmen than thinking about Christ's last day.
</P>
<P>
   The crowded and narrow streets certainly are not for the
claustrophobic. And the streets take so many twists and turns that
it is extremely easy to become lost and disoriented. Twice I paid
someone to lead me out of the maze.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of Via Dolorosa is the Church of the Holy Sepulcher,
to many the holiest place in Christendom. Since the fourth century,
this has been accepted as the traditional site of Jesus'
crucifixion, entombment and resurrection.
</P>
<P>
   The Byzantines built the first church. The current church was
constructed by the Crusaders in the 12th century atop the ruins of
earlier churches.
</P>
<P>
   The vast, three-story stone church is home to six different
denominations. The three largest are the Greek Orthodox, the
Armenians and the Roman Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, the church is crammed with religious icons and visitors.
Crowds push in from all around as they attempt to ascend the steep,
narrow steps to the site of the crucifixion.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the church was still a dark, gloomy place when I
visited. But after 17 years of construction, a sparkling new dome
now floods the interior with sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   Many Protestants and Evangelical Christians consider the Garden
Tomb outside the city walls to be the true site of Calvary. An
ancient, rock-cut tomb in a tranquil garden gives visitors a quiet
place to reflect on Christ's sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   Other places important to Christians include the Mount of
Olives, where Jesus descended the mountain on a donkey on the first
Palm Sunday and wept over the city's impending destruction.
</P>
<P>
   At the base of the Mount of Olives is the Garden of Gethsemane,
where the Romans arrested Jesus on the morning after the Last
Supper, the disciples' Passover Seder. Scientific tests have shown
that the gnarled olive trees are as much as 2,000 years old and
could have sheltered Jesus at prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Jerusalem is also sacred to two other great religions. The
Western Wall of the Temple Mount and the treasures of the Jewish
Quarter have special meaning to Jews. Also known as the Wailing
Wall, it is here the faithful flock to lift their prayers to the
Lord.
</P>
<P>
   According to tradition, Mohammed's night ride to heaven to
receive the Koran started from the Temple Mount. The beautiful
mosques are built on the top of Mount Moriah.
</P>
<P>
   One word of caution, however: Visitors should dress
conservatively. An American couple in my tour group was accosted by
a young Muslim man, who apparently was taking issue with their
apparel. (The woman's dress was above her knees.)
</P>
<P>
   Our Israeli guide politely listened to the man rant and rave,
until mosque officials gently led him away. Nevertheless, the point
was made that these holy sites must be revered by all visitors. The
requirements are particularly strict for women: long sleeves,
dresses below the knee, no shorts, head coverings. Men should not
wear shorts.
</P>
<P>
   If you like your history a la Disney, the new Time Elevator in
Jerusalem is just the ride for you. The simulator ride is actually
a large theater, with seats on hydraulic platforms.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers bump and bounce along as the 4,000-year history of the
city unfolds before them. The 30-minute show uses all kinds of
multimedia devices to keep the audience entertained. From talking
statues to film clips, the action was lively as we tagged along
with kings David and Solomon, and witnessed the birth of
Christianity, the Muslim conquest, the Crusades and finally the
rebirth of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   On a much more serious note, the Shrine of the Book at the
Israel Museum offers a chance to see the oldest surviving biblical
texts. Shaped to resemble the lid of the clay jars in which the
Dead Sea Scrolls survived two millennia until their discovery in
1947, this structure -- and its contents -- are a highlight of the
capital's venerable museum.
</P>
<P>
   My pilgrimage gave me a newfound appreciation for the importance
that religion plays in the lives of many cultures around the world.

ONE PORTFOLIO LOAFS, ANOTHER IS WAY TOO AGGRESSIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I would like your advice on a portfolio for my wife and
myself as we enter retirement. I am 58 and will retire soon. I have
been a teacher for 34 years, and will retire with a state pension
of $2,500 a month. My wife is 54 and not working. We plan to draw
$600 a month from her IRA for a five-year period. At age 62 I will
receive $255 a month from Social Security, and my wife will receive
Social Security of $465 a month when she reaches 62. At present we
have 20 percent of our mutual fund investments in equity funds and
the rest in money markets. My wife has $19,000 in Fidelity Dividend
Growth fund, $12,000 in Fidelity Disciplined Equity, $5,000 in
Vanguard Wellington, $6,000 in Vanguard Index 500, $23,000 in
Fidelity Cash Reserves, and $84,000 in Vanguard Prime Money Market.
I have $14,000 in Fidelity Dividend Growth fund and $102,000 in
Fidelity Cash Reserves. We also have $135,000 in a liquid advantage
account at our bank.
</P>
<P>
   D.F., Huntington Beach, Calif. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I would do the arithmetic a little differently, coming up
with a total of $344,000, or 86 percent of your savings, in money
markets and other cash investments. You have built a staggeringly
conservative portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say it may not work to some extent. I guess I
just hate to see so much money loafing, and loafing so mightily.
</P>
<P>
   I presume that your plan is to use the withdrawals from your
wife's IRA during the first five years of retirement to bring your
income to $3,100 a month, which is satisfactory to your needs.
</P>
<P>
   In four years, when your Social Security kicks in, your
dependence upon this would be somewhat lessened, and in eight years
your combined Social Security benefits would, in theory, take the
place of the IRA withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
   There would be a three-year period during which you would need
to take some of the yield from your savings to meet living
expenses, and after you would probably have to continue drawing
some to counter inflation, but the pool would continue to grow
modestly, providing you further protection against inflation in the
later years of your retirement.
</P>
<P>
   I am always loath to suggest that people who have built
ultra-conservative portfolios change their ways. I assume that
since your total portfolio is likely to return 5.5 percent to 6
percent, and since inflation hasn't been that high for some time,
you would be able to cruise through retirement with the portfolio
chugging along safely ahead of the ravages of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, would likely be true _ except that if you
expect to continue maintaining a $3,100-a-month lifestyle, you will
soon be spending some of it.
</P>
<P>
   Let's look at the picture in eight years, when your wife
qualifies for Social Security, bringing your total income from
pension and combined Social Security to $3,220.
</P>
<P>
   Let's suppose that inflation averages 3.5 percent a year during
those first eight years, that your portfolio remains at a $400,000
balance, and that it returns a portfolio average of 5.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   To keep step with inflation, you would need $4,082 a month to
maintain a standard of living equivalent to what $3,100 a month now
buys.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, you would be drawing $862 a month, or $10,344 a year, from
your retirement portfo-lio. The effect of this is that after the
withdrawals, the growth of your principal would shrink to 2.91
percent _ no longer keeping pace with inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The real trouble comes later on. Let's jump 10 years into the
future. By then you would need $5,758 a month to maintain the
current $3,100 monthly spending power, meaning that withdrawals
would run at a rate of $2,538 a month _ more than the portfolio
would produce.
</P>
<P>
   Advances in Social Security payments would help, but not enough
to solve the problem. Even if you still had $400,000 in the
portfolio, making such withdrawals would mean that the fund would
be depleted in a little more than 15 years _ and you'd have no
capacity to increase withdrawals to offset future inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is that you really can't afford to be so
conservative. Do some research into CDs, intermediate-term bond
funds such as GNMAs, and other reasonably conservative fixed-income
investments, seeking at least to pull your anticipated portfolio
returns into the 7 percent range, at which point you would have a
much better chance of making your strategy work.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My wife and I are 65, and we have these investments, totaling
$308,000: $11,000 in US Savings Bonds, $15,000 in CDs, $18,000 in
Gabelli Westwood Balanced fund, $10,000 in Gabelli Westwood Equity
fund, $23,000 in Gabelli Asset fund, $13,000 in Janus fund, $33,000
in Janus Worldwide fund, $14,000 in T. Rowe Price Dividend Growth
fund, $19,000 in T. Rowe Price Equity Income fund, $4,000 in John
Hancock Sovereign Investors fund (an IRA), $5,000 in Sound Shore
fund, $8,000 in American Century Ultra fund, $40,000 in USAA Income
Strategy fund, $28,000 in USAA Income Stock fund (another IRA),
$44,000 in Vanguard Index 500, and $23,000 in Vanguard Health Care
fund. Our only debt is a $1,000 monthly mortgage payment. Would you
suggest any changes in our investments?
</P>
<P>
   J.W., San Diego &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, perhaps you could merge with D.F., the writer of the
letter above, and come out with a fairly well-balanced portfolio
between you.
</P>
<P>
   I tally a bit more than 21 percent of this portfolio on the
fixed-income side (with your balanced fund as half equity and half
fixed income). That's putting too much reliance upon the market for
most people your age.
</P>
<P>
   You say nothing about your financial position aside from this
portfolio, but unless you have an income stream from other sources
that is well in excess of your current needs, you are taking too
much risk.
</P>
<P>
   Such a portfolio might be appropriate for a person who wouldn't
need for the funds within a 10-year period, and I'd be more
comfortable if that number were 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   At a minimum, double the fixed-income side of the portfolio, and
indeed, go further, taking it to 50 percent or more, looking for
the same kind of investments I suggested for D.F.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am a widow, age 89, and I have $350,000 in CDs. My monthly
Social Security is $914, I have a $156 monthly pension, and I earn
$200 a month. Do you think I should put some of my CDs in the
market? My concern is that I may need long-term health care and
will not have enough assets to cover the cost. I do not want to be
a burden on my daughter. What do you suggest?
</P>
<P>
   L.L., Woodland Hills, Calif. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I think the stock market is a place that's simply too
dangerous at this point. In the near term, a chance of a
significant loss is as strong as that of any substantial gain. In
fact, I'm hoping for a fairly long period of moving sideways, which
might bring earnings and potential earnings into a better alignment
with stock prices. Going sideways isn't anything that will help
you. And remember, that's what I'm hoping for, not what I fear.
</P>
<P>
   For a person in your situation, CDs look mighty good to me right
now. Entering this week, the nation's highest rate was 7.42 percent
for a jumbo ($100,000 or above) five-year CD. The best rate on a
one-year jumbo was 6.72 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If you can achieve such rates, and hold the accounts to $100,000
each so that they enjoy federal insurance, that route is safer, and
quite possibly more rewarding, than joining hands with the very
tired bull that has been driving Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   The important thing is to keep careful tabs on the best rates,
which many Sunday newspapers publish each week.

TEXAS GOVERNOR'S CAMP REAPS SOFT MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ALOYSIUS FARRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ George W. Bush's elite crew of fund-raising
``pioneers'' has won national attention for vowing to raise
$100,000 each for the Texas governor's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's premier fund-raisers have largely avoided the
spotlight for another role they are playing in the 2000 campaign:
collecting chunks of ``soft money'' for the national and state
Republican parties.
</P>
<P>
   A Globe study of Federal Election Commission records shows that
Bush's fund-raisers have worked diligently at raising the
unlimited, and virtually unregulated, donations known as soft money
for the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   Of the $34 million in soft money collected by the Republican
National Committee and its affiliates, some $3.2 million was given
by just 41 members of the pioneers, their families, or firms,
election commission records show.
</P>
<P>
   And the Republican Party has raised another $5 million in soft
money from firms whose officers and employees contributed bundles
of more than $10,000 to the Bush campaign, the records show.
</P>
<P>
   Such shared ties between the party and a leading presidential
campaign are not surprising, said Bush spokesman Scott McClellan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously our leadership team is supporting the Republican
Party at the state and national level,'' McClellan said.
</P>
<P>
   But the use of soft money is controversial because it has
emerged as the principal loophole in federal campaign finance laws,
which were designed to rid US politics of the corrupting influence
of big money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soft money is absolutely the worst money in politics today,''
said Common Cause president Scott Harshbarger, the former
Massachusetts attorney general. ``It is completely unlimited,
virtually unregulated _ a way for wealthy corporations,
individuals, or unions to get around the law by laundering their
money.''
</P>
<P>
   GOP Senator John McCain of Arizona has sponsored legislation
that would ban soft money and, along with Democrat Bill Bradley,
has promised not to use such funds in the 2000 election should he
become his party's nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Bush opposes McCain's proposed ban on soft money because, the
governor says, it would hurt Republicans more than Democrats. The
Texas governor has instead been a champion of full disclosure. He
is the first presidential candidate to post the names and donations
of all his contributors on the Internet, and in a searchable
format.
</P>
<P>
   But Howard Opinsky, a spokesman for the McCain campaign, said in
reaction to Globe findings that disclosure is not enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no surprise to us that the major soft money donors, who
want to protect the status quo of the campaign finance system that
benefits them, are supporting a candidate who is not interested in
reform,'' Opinsky said.
</P>
<P>
   After watching Bush raise $67 million in regulated ``hard
money'' under a law that limits donations to presidential
candidates to $1,000 per individual, Democrats are nervously
wondering what the Texas governor's fund-raisers will do if freed
of such restraints when collecting soft money.
</P>
<P>
   The November FEC records _ the latest available for study _
offer glimpses of what could be in store as the pioneers switch
from $1,000 donations and begin to collect funds in bigger amounts.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 16 the investment firm of Hicks, Muse, Tate &AMP; Furst _
tied to Texas pioneer Steven Hicks _ gave the GOP $25,000. The next
day Boston pioneer Herbert Collins gave $20,000 in ``soft money''
to the Republican National Committee, raising his cumulative total
in this election cycle to $180,000.
</P>
<P>
   Like Collins, 11 other Bush pioneers or their firms have already
made six-figure soft money donations to the GOP, led by Michigan's
Michael Kojaian ($300,000) and California's Alexander Spanos
($250,000).
</P>
<P>
   The average soft money donation of the 41 pioneers was about
$80,000, according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush pioneers' soft money donations are particularly
noteworthy because the big soft money season, which traditionally
arrives after the primaries are over, is still months away.
</P>
<P>
   McClellan said that the Bush campaign had not yet directed its
fund-raisers to shift their focus from hard to soft money, but that
the pioneers _ as they continue to collect hard money _ have a
simultaneous goal of raising soft money for Republican Party
organizations in the 20 most important states.
</P>
<P>
   Though McCain wants to do away with soft money, he does not
refuse hard money contributions from individuals who give soft
money to the party.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the firms that donated the biggest chunks of soft
money to the GOP _ like Microsoft ($230,000) and AT&AMP;T ($525,000) _
also have employees who contributed to McCain.
</P>
<P>
   But records show that the amount of money that McCain received
from corporations like Microsoft and AT&AMP;T was modest. The senator
does not have 150 or so wealthy individuals like the pioneers, who
work exclusively for one candidate, raising soft money for the
party on the side.
</P>
<P>
   When McCain does get funds from big soft money sources he
generally shares the donor with his fellow candidates.
</P>
<P>
   According to a computerized database run by the Center for
Responsive Politics, a Washington-based public interest group,
Microsoft employees gave some $29,000 to Bush, $22,000 to Bradley,
$16,000 to McCain, and $13,000 to Vice President Al Gore. AT&AMP;T
employees gave $20,000 to Gore, $9,000 to Bush, $6,000 to McCain,
and $3,000 to Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Though soft money is supposed to be used only for party-building
activities, recent court decisions have widened the loophole, and
the two major parties now use it to fund massive television
advertising campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The exemption was made to encourage party-building activities
which benefit the political parties . . . but not specific
candidates,'' said Michael Stewart, a spokesman for the center.
``In reality the loophole has emerged as the parties' primary way
to raise tens of millions of dollars from wealthy contributors
during the general election campaign when direct contributions to
the candidates are prohibited.''
</P>
<P>
   Soft money fueled the Democratic Party's massive TV ad campaign
in the spring and summer of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   GOP presidential challenger Bob Dole, caught unaware and
momentarily short on funds, never recovered.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison with the GOP's $34 million, the Democrats have
raised $24 million in soft money in this election cycle: roughly on
par with the 3-to-2 edge that Republicans traditionally enjoy in
soft money.
</P>
<P>
   But after the Republicans announced that their fund-raising goal
for the 2000 election is $177 million, some Democrats worried aloud
that their party's nominee might emerge from a debilitating primary
campaign and run into an advertising blitz financed by Bush's
leading fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders ``assume the same cast of characters will
come through for the RNC,'' said Jim Jordan, spokesman for the
Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. ``Presumably, that is
what has encouraged them to construct a $177 million fund-raising
plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, however, said the Democrats will raise enough soft money
of their own to keep their candidate from suffering Dole's fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear the Republicans will be on the air heavy with soft
dollar party advertising _ that is what that budget is for, in
large measure,'' said Jordan. ``But as has become increasingly
obvious over the last cycle or two, we Democrats have a lot of
experience, and you don't need to match your opponent dollar for
dollar in advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   The increased role of soft money, and Bush's decision to reject
public finance funds and spending limits, causes Harshbarger to
worry that the United States is returning to the pre-Watergate days
of the early 1970s, when five- and six-figure donations from
wealthy interests was seen to have a corrupting influence on
American politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The presidential public finance system was to be the real
reform in this arena, to make sure the presidential race wasn't on
the auction block,'' Harshbarger said. ``Now these pioneers have
pioneered a dramatic escalation in the political arms race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It creates a real impression in the average person that their
vote doesn't count,'' said Harshbarger. ``It creates an apathy and
cynicism.''

CHIP IMPLANTS TO LINK PEOPLE, COMPUTERS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No, he's not quite the bionic man some have suggested, but if
everything goes as Kevin Warwick hopes, he may soon become one of
humankind's first real cyborgs.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the notion of being part man and part computer has
been the stuff of science fiction. But in the next two years, a
surgeon will slice open Warwick's left arm, fix a delicate collar
around his nerve fibers, attach an array of electrodes, and wire
them to an inch-long microelectronic implant capable of recording
neural signals and transmitting them to an external computer.
</P>
<P>
   Thus Warwick, a cybernetics professor at Reading University in
England will become a human guinea pig in the effort to merge man
and machine.
</P>
<P>
   Presuming no glitches with Warwick's implant, his wife, Irena,
will also receive one. The couple will then see if one can trigger
not simply motion but emotion in the other.
</P>
<P>
   Should the experiment succeed, a panoply of possibilities _ and
a host of moral and ethical questions _ will stretch like the new
century on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   In the first phase _ involving only Warwick _ a research team
will try, for example, to record the electric nerve signals that
move a hand or a finger, store them in a computer, and then see if
the data, transmitted back to his implant and into his neural
network, will trigger the same muscle movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the work that's being done on the medical side, we are
99.9 percent sure that it will re-create the movement,'' Warwick
says. ``The big question is, what will my brain make of that? Will
it be like a nervous twitch, where you are not quite in control of
things, or will it be far more sinister than that?''
</P>
<P>
   Warwick's hopes are far grander than just using stored
neurological messages to re-create muscle movement in himself,
however.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I would really like to achieve is being able to
communicate from person to person by means of thought signals
alone,'' Warwick says. ``This is a step on the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Warwick, optimist that he is, doesn't see actual conceptual
thought being transferred via his temporary implant. That would
take a brain implant.
</P>
<P>
   He does, however, believe it's realistic to theorize that nerve
impulses in one person may trigger muscle motion in the other.
</P>
<P>
   And he wants to prove it in a way that makes an intercontinental
splash via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing we would like to try is, let my wife have a trip to
Boston, and from here I would move my finger and see if, at the
exact same time, her finger moves.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet another experiment will take him across the boundary into a
strange new world where technology could change the very nature of
what it means to be human. He'll feed extrasensory information,
such as ultrasonic impulses, into his nervous system to see if it
allows him to sense objects in his path, the way, say, a bat would.
He'll also test whether his nervous system can make any sense of
infrared data to detect heat from afar.
</P>
<P>
   If any of that works, it would be stunning.
</P>
<P>
   But his hopes are higher still: to transfer sensation, such as
pain and emotion itself, to his wife. That, Warwick says, could
open up a whole new world of communication, where two people might
actually share a state of feeling, even at great distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology is there, once we are hooked in via implants,
of having impulses sent across the Internet to anyone else with an
implant,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly that would be a great advance in existing research,
which at its most promising has seen neurosurgeons at Emory
University in Atlanta implant a neurotropic electrode in the brain
of a paralyzed stroke victim, enabling him to move a computer
cursor, and thus communicate, by thought impulse.
</P>
<P>
   If Warwick does succeed, it will surprise many skeptics, who,
citing the current state of knowledge, believe his prospects to be
slim. Even Warwick's recylcling his own nerve signals to re-create
similar muscle movement in himself would be a real breakthrough,
says Steve M. Potter, a senior research fellow in biology at the
California Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be quite a few scientists who will be very
surprised if he does that,'' said Potter. ``They are nowhere near
at that stage. That kind of thing is 10 years down the line.'' And
as for Warwick's hopes to transfer emotion?
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like science fiction to me,'' says Bruce McNaughton,
director of the University of Arizona's graduate program in
cognition and neural systems. ``I would say the technology is a few
centuries away.''
</P>
<P>
   A second problem, says Thomas Murray, president of the Hastings
Center, the well-known bioethics research institute, is that
emotion is not merely neurological messages, but a complex matrix
of feeling and thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an enormous leap to say, well, we can measure a few
electrical nerve impulses, so if I can somehow transmit them to me,
I can feel the same emotion,'' says Murray.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone is as pessimistic. Dr. Roy Bakay, one of the
Emory neurosurgeons who did the pioneering brain-implant work, says
that at least the initial part of Warwick's experiment _ trying to
trigger motion in his hand by reintroducing his own nerve signals _
is feasible.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an interesting idea,'' says Bakay. ``I see a lot of
potential technical difficulties, but there is nothing wrong with
it scientifically, and the technology is there.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, with Warwick's plans beginning to attract international
attention, both fascinating possibilities and thorny questions
swirl in the background.
</P>
<P>
   For example, says Warwick, could doctors use neural signals from
a healthy person to help someone learn to walk again after an
injury that damaged motor functions?
</P>
<P>
   And if moods can be shared, could depression be treated by
storing a person's nerve signals during a happy state and then
transmitting them back when he or she is depressed?
</P>
<P>
   More fancifully, Warwick wonders if a person could get tipsy
merely by recording impulses when inebriated and then
retransmitting them when the subject is sober.
</P>
<P>
   And consider the new ways to gauge a person's true feelings. No
more lover's angst: One partner might demand proof in the form of
an interpersonal emotional readout.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, one person might even be able to experience the
moment of another's death, he suggests.
</P>
<P>
   ``If two people are hooked up and one dies, will the other get
some sort of feeling or impression of what that person goes through
when dying?'' Warwick wonders.
</P>
<P>
   If Thanatos isn't particularly appealing, well, there's always
sex. Warwick hopes he and his wife will be able to share the
sensations of sexual arousal by intermingling nerve impulses.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a part of the experiment I will be looking forward
to,'' laughs Warwick. ``What if it would be possible to get the
sexual stimulation of intercourse without actually doing it?''
</P>
<P>
   It's wild speculation, to be sure, but if that's possible,
Warwick says, cybersex might someday lead to a fantasy land where a
person could, say, buy a computer disc that would let him or her
share the sexual stimulation of a celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe you could go and get Tom Cruise's signals or Meg Ryan's
signals, if those people were willing to have their feelings
recorded,'' he speculates.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the question about whether the experiment can work
scientifically, bioethicists raise some other concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be very skeptical when a guy uses his wife or a
family member for an experiment like that,'' says George Annas,
professor of health law at the Boston University School of Public
Health. ``The coercion is almost inherent, certainly, in a spousal
relationship. The inherent threat,'' if the other partner doesn't
want to participate, is: ``I am going to resent you for not
participating in something that is extraordinarily important to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   So what does Irena Warwick say?
</P>
<P>
   She insists that her participation truly is voluntary. ``It is
very scary, because I don't like operations, but I couldn't let
somebody else read my husband's deep thoughts,'' she says. (That
said, it is not actually thoughts but impulses and, possibly,
emotions, at issue here.)
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the philosophical issues about the natural and
desirable boundaries of human relationships. Even if technology
should realize all Warwick's hopes, allowing some sort of shared
emotional awareness with another, would the average person want
that sort of fused relationship, even with a loved one?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, absolutely not, I think it's a terrible idea,'' answers
social critic Barbara Dafoe Whitehead, author of ``The Divorce
Culture.'' ``A lot of people think what keeps a good marriage
together is a certain amount of discretion, not disclosing every
single thought or feeling you have, and maintaining some sort of
emotional privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that is sick, personally,'' says McNaughton, of the
University of Arizona. ``I think it is unnatural and an invasion,
and I don't see any necessity for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet curiosity has a way of following technology where
afterthought might fear to tread. And in this instance, Warwick is
undaunted by the naysayers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a belief that if we are looking around the corner, we
are going to find something there, and I want to have a look,''
says Warwick. ``I am certainly not going to stop just because
somebody else doesn't like the looks of it or they don't think it
is going to work. There were people 100 years ago . . . who said it
wasn't possible for heavier-than-air machines to fly.''

TWO-BIT CRIMINAL _ OR PATRIOT? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE _ One night last spring, when NATO fighters had bombed
the electricity grid for the umpteenth time, the lights at the
Hyatt Hotel went out yet again, and the Tea House lounge was
plunged into darkness.
</P>
<P>
   When, a few moments later, a generator kicked in and the lights
came back on, Zeljko Raznatovic sat as he had before, a drink in
his hand, a laugh on his lips. The only difference was that, in the
darkness, two bodyguards had sprung from chairs to his side.
</P>
<P>
   If Raznatovic sensed danger in the dark, he did not show it,
then or ever. ``I am not afraid of your CIA,'' said the man better
known as ``Arkan.'' ``They cannot kill me here.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if they had wanted to, they could have. Arkan lived
openly during the Kosovo war. He was a creature of habit, his
patterns, such as the nightly rounds of drinks at the Tea House,
well established. His regular duo of bodyguards, one of them
usually a woman, provided little deterrent against professional
assassins _ as events of last weekend proved.
</P>
<P>
   Arkan, 47, was gunned down on Jan. 15 in the lobby of the
Inter-Continental hotel in Belgrade. One of the bodyguards who had
leapt to Arkan's side in the darkness last year was cut down with
him, as was another man in the perpetual hotel-hopping entourage.
</P>
<P>
   For all his talk about Western governments conspiring to kill
him, much of it aimed at adding to his mystique, Arkan was never as
vulnerable to the outside world as he was to the society that
spawned him.
</P>
<P>
   That a stickup man turned gangster turned paramilitary leader
turned war criminal would become a celebrity in Serbia is a symptom
of a deeply dysfunctional society, as good an explanation as any
for why what remains of the former Yugoslavia is a pariah in the
Western world.
</P>
<P>
   Arkan was a postmodern gangster. Historically, the biggest and
the most notorious organized crime groups in the world, such as the
Italian Mafia and the Chinese triads, began as nationalist militias
that morphed into criminal organizations after their raison d'etre
melted away.
</P>
<P>
   With Arkan and his Tigers paramilitary unit, it was just the
opposite. They were a bunch of hoodlums given a political mandate
to kill by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic in his regime's
campaign to create an ethnically pure Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The quickest way to drive out any segment of a civilian
population is to terrorize them, and the best way to terrorize
people is to summarily execute some of them, be they men, women or
children.
</P>
<P>
   Arkan and the Tigers were accomplished ethnic cleansers, first
in Croatia, then in Bosnia, and finally in Kosovo, although by the
time Serb forces rolled into Kosovo last year, Arkan saw no need to
accompany them. He had long ago traded his camouflage fatigues for
Armani suits. His nightly cocktail circuit in Belgrade was not so
much about establishing an alibi in Kosovo as it was about reaping
the rewards of a criminal empire he built when he wasn't doing
Milosevic's dirty work.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Slovenia, the son of a senior officer in the Yugoslav
air force, Arkan dropped out of school at 17 and a few years later
was robbing banks in Western Europe. He was suspected of being
among those who assassinated exiled Yugoslav dissidents in various
European capitals in the 1970s and '80s. He was arrested in Belgium
for bank robbery and given a 15-year prison sentence in 1975, but
escaped four years later.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities throughout Europe kept arresting him, but Arkan kept
escaping, from jails in Holland and Germany, from police in Sweden
and Italy. Arkan had friends in high places in the Yugoslav secret
police, which helped him slip across borders and return to Serbia
without fear of extradition. Indeed, his nickname was drawn from
one of the many passports he obtained with the help of the secret
police.
</P>
<P>
   Despite being one of Interpol's most wanted men, he was able to
return to Belgrade in 1986 and open a cake and ice cream shop
across the street from the stadium that was home to Serbia's most
popular soccer team, Red Star Belgrade. Arkan became chairman of
the team's fan club and found recruits for his criminal gang, and
later the Tigers, among the rowdies who peopled the cheap seats.
</P>
<P>
   War crimes prosecutors say that in 1991, Arkan and the Tigers
slaughtered civilians in the Croatian town of Vukovar, including
some 250 people who were dragged from a hospital and shot.
Prosecutors say Arkan and his Tigers repeated the slaughter of
civilians in Bosnia, aiding and abetting Radovan Karadzic, the
Bosnian Serb leader, and Bosnian Serb General Ratko Mladic, both of
whom, like Arkan, were indicted for war crimes but have not been
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   In much of Serbia, many people acknowledged Arkan was a
gangster; but he was also seen as a patriot, someone who did
nothing different from what the Croats did to Serbs in Croatia and
what Bosnian Muslims did to Serbs in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Arkan fathered nine children by three wives. His third wife,
Svetlana Velikovic, is a pop singer known as Ceca, and their 1995
wedding was treated as a celebrity event. Once, on a live call-in
TV show, a caller admired a piece of jewelry she was wearing. When
the caller asked Ceca if it was inscribed with certain lettering on
back, a startled Ceca replied that it was. The caller then said it
had been stolen from her by Arkan. The line immediately went dead.
</P>
<P>
   With the Yugoslav dinar all but collapsed, the true currency in
Belgrade these days is conspiracy theories, and there is no
shortage of them when it comes to who killed Arkan. Opposition
parties have blamed the Milosevic regime, saying it had the most to
gain by silencing someone who literally knew where the bodies were
buried. Others suggest gangland competitors did him in.
</P>
<P>
   There is evidence that Arkan was distancing himself from
Milosevic and cozying up to Serbian opposition leaders, including
Zoran Djindjic, and Montenegro President Milo Djukanovic, a bitter
Milosevic foe. That Djindjic and Djukanovic saw nothing wrong with
striking up a relationship with Arkan raises questions about why
the Clinton administration believes those two leaders hold the key
to ousting Milosevic and building a better society in what remains
of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Jacques Klein, head of the United Nations mission in Bosnia,
spoke for many when he said crying for Arkan would be like crying
for Adolf Eichmann, the Nazi war criminal.
</P>
<P>
   But there were tears shed for Arkan at his funeral Thursday in
Belgrade. He was dispatched from this world in a ceremony befitting
the national hero he styled himself as.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, Arkan sat on a couch in the Drawing Room, a small,
plush lounge at the Hyatt, watching Manchester United battle Bayern
Munich for the European soccer championship on a widescreen TV.
While his father had fought as a partisan against the Nazis, Arkan
cheered for the German team and heaped abuse on the English team,
even though Britain and Germany are part of NATO.
</P>
<P>
   ``The British are bombing us,'' he reasoned. ``The Germans are
harmless.''
</P>
<P>
   On one of the walls, a smaller TV set was tuned to CNN, its
sound turned down as everyone focused on the big game. Suddenly,
without consulting the two dozen people who were glued to the
soccer match, Arkan grabbed a remote control and hit the mute
button on the big screen and turned up the volume on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   As he listened to correspondent Christiane Amanpour report that
The Hague tribunal had indicted Milosevic, Arkan's jaw stiffened
and his eyes narrowed. He could not mask his contempt for Amanpour,
who had made a devastating documentary about him. As if that was
not bad enough, Amanpour's husband, US State Department spokesman
Jamie Rubin, was on TV every day, defending the bombing of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   After describing Amanpour in language that is unprintable, Arkan
turned the game's sound back on, tossed the remote aside, settled
back into the comfortable couch and dismissed as ridiculous the
charges lodged against his president and patron.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's crazy,'' Arkan said. ``He's no war criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, having seen what happened to Arkan, it could be that
Karadzic and Mladic might prefer the justice that awaits them at
The Hague than the kind doled out in the lobby of the
Inter-Continental.

   IN SOUTH CAROLINA, GOP TAKES OVER FROM RACIST DEMOCRATS OF
CENTURIES PAST. One hundred years ago, Sen. Ben ``Pitchfork''
Tillman, a South Carolina Democrat, stood on the floor of the U.S.
Senate and described his state's strategy for keeping blacks from
exercising their 15th Amendment right to vote. His words: ``We have
scratched our heads to find out how we could eliminate the last one
of them. We have stuffed ballot boxes. We shoot them. We are not
ashamed.'' ``If Tillman were alive today, it is very likely that he
and his ilk would tone down their racial rhetoric, but they might
become registered Republicans,'' columnist Vernon Jarrett writes.
Witness the controversy over the Confederate War Flag that now
waves over South Carolina's capitol dome. In this commentary,
Jarrett reports on how the presidential frontrunners stand on this
issue and offers an historical context to bolster his argument that
the flag must be removed.

   BUSH FOR PRESIDENT? DEFINITELY NOT _ An admitted fan of CNN,
MSNBC and the ``Jim Lerher News Hour,'' columnist James Garcia
likes to think he is a step ahead of the public in being able to
anticipate political trends. In this commentary, Garcia offers his
opinion on the presidential frontrunners. ``Like most Americans,
I've narrowed my list to ... Texas Gov. George W. Bush, Vice
President Al Gore, Sen. John McCain and former Sen. Bill Bradley.
Where I split with most Americans is that I'm ready to drop a name
from that short list: Bush,'' Garcia writes. He goes to explain why
he thinks Bush is off-base on the issues.

   FOR ME, THE NEW YEAR IS AN OPEN ROAD. One of columnist Bill
Maxwell's resolutions for the New Year is to travel more both in
the United States and abroad. ``For me, travel is spiritual
nourishment, especially when I do not have a strict plan,'' he
writes. ``I love to travel intuitively, to let things happen, to
find a smooth place in a rough sea or a piece of level ground on
craggy terrain. The trick is to find balance in a foreign place.''
In this article, Maxwell recounts his travel adventures of last
year _ including his trip to Gaza city, where he was arrested for
taking pictures of the Palestinian Authority's intelligence
building _ and explains why today's budding journalists need to hit
the road as often as possible.

   DIABETES DOES NOT DISCRIMINATE. Diabetes is the sixth leading
cause of death in the United States, affecting 16 million
Americans, writes Theresa Kim in this article from A. Magazine. Of
the afflicted, an estimated one-third are undiagnosed. A National
Institutes of Health Study reports that the rates of
Asian-Americans with diabetes are double, and nearly triple, that
of Caucasians. In this article, Kim defines diabetes for the
average reader, cites the alarming statistics that show an increase
in the numbers of Asian-Americans suffering from it and reports on
the work of many health organizations that are involved in the
Asian-American communities.

   THE WIND BENEATH HER WINGS. On the Pine Ridge Indian
reservation, where the unemployment rate hovers at 70 percent and
the county within the reservation (Shannon) has been proclaimed the
poorest county in the United States, role models are hard to come
by. SuAnne Big Crow, however, counts as one. SuAnne was a model
teen-ager who lived her life to the fullest and was proud of her
Native-American heritage. Teens and adults looked to her for
inspiration. Unfortunately, her life was cut short when she was
killed in an automobile accident. Her legacy lives on with The
SuAnne Big Crow Memorial Boys and Girls Club. In this fascinating
feature, columnist Tim Giago explains why SuAnne will never be
forgotten among Native-Americans.

CENTURIES PAST. One hundred years ago, Sen. Ben ``Pitchfork''
Tillman, a South Carolina Democrat, stood on the floor of the U.S.
Senate and described his state's strategy for keeping blacks from
exercising their 15th Amendment right to vote. His words: ``We have
scratched our heads to find out how we could eliminate the last one
of them. We have stuffed ballot boxes. We shoot them. We are not
ashamed.'' ``If Tillman were alive today, it is very likely that he
and his ilk would tone down their racial rhetoric, but they might
become registered Republicans,'' columnist Vernon Jarrett writes.
Witness the controversy over the Confederate War Flag that now
waves over South Carolina's capitol dome. In this commentary,
Jarrett reports on how the presidential frontrunners stand on this
issue and offers an historical context to bolster his argument that
the flag must be removed.

   BUSH FOR PRESIDENT? DEFINITELY NOT _ An admitted fan of CNN,
MSNBC and the ``Jim Lerher News Hour,'' columnist James Garcia
likes to think he is a step ahead of the public in being able to
anticipate political trends. In this commentary, Garcia offers his
opinion on the presidential frontrunners. ``Like most Americans,
I've narrowed my list to ... Texas Gov. George W. Bush, Vice
President Al Gore, Sen. John McCain and former Sen. Bill Bradley.
Where I split with most Americans is that I'm ready to drop a name
from that short list: Bush,'' Garcia writes. He goes to explain why
he thinks Bush is off-base on the issues.

   FOR ME, THE NEW YEAR IS AN OPEN ROAD. One of columnist Bill
Maxwell's resolutions for the New Year is to travel more both in
the United States and abroad. ``For me, travel is spiritual
nourishment, especially when I do not have a strict plan,'' he
writes. ``I love to travel intuitively, to let things happen, to
find a smooth place in a rough sea or a piece of level ground on
craggy terrain. The trick is to find balance in a foreign place.''
In this article, Maxwell recounts his travel adventures of last
year _ including his trip to Gaza city, where he was arrested for
taking pictures of the Palestinian Authority's intelligence
building _ and explains why today's budding journalists need to hit
the road as often as possible.

   DIABETES DOES NOT DISCRIMINATE. Diabetes is the sixth leading
cause of death in the United States, affecting 16 million
Americans, writes Theresa Kim in this article from A. Magazine. Of
the afflicted, an estimated one-third are undiagnosed. A National
Institutes of Health Study reports that the rates of
Asian-Americans with diabetes are double, and nearly triple, that
of Caucasians. In this article, Kim defines diabetes for the
average reader, cites the alarming statistics that show an increase
in the numbers of Asian-Americans suffering from it and reports on
the work of many health organizations that are involved in the
Asian-American communities.

   THE WIND BENEATH HER WINGS. On the Pine Ridge Indian
reservation, where the unemployment rate hovers at 70 percent and
the county within the reservation (Shannon) has been proclaimed the
poorest county in the United States, role models are hard to come
by. SuAnne Big Crow, however, counts as one. SuAnne was a model
teen-ager who lived her life to the fullest and was proud of her
Native-American heritage. Teens and adults looked to her for
inspiration. Unfortunately, her life was cut short when she was
killed in an automobile accident. Her legacy lives on with The
SuAnne Big Crow Memorial Boys and Girls Club. In this fascinating
feature, columnist Tim Giago explains why SuAnne will never be
forgotten among Native-Americans.

REGARDING THE BATHS NOT TAKEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``You only have one bathroom?'' a friend asked, after looking
around our house. She seemed shocked.
</P>
<P>
   It's true. We have only one bathroom. And it's not even a great
bathroom. It's basic.
</P>
<P>
   My friend couldn't believe that we had moved willingly from a
house with two and a half bathrooms to a place with just one.
</P>
<P>
   Neither could I, at first.
</P>
<P>
   Now I look back on those years we lived in the
two-and-a-half-bath house as a kind of lavatory golden age. I know
I'll never again have so many bathrooms. At least I have my
memories.
</P>
<P>
   Two and a half bathrooms were more bathrooms than I'd ever
dreamed of, or would have dreamed of, if I'd dreamed about
bathrooms, which I didn't, until we scaled down from two and a half
to one.
</P>
<P>
   Now I think about bathrooms all the time.
</P>
<P>
   I'm far from alone in this. There's a kind of plumbing frenzy in
the air. In these prosperous times everybody's going nuts over
bathrooms. They're not just conveniences anymore, they're status
symbols, more numerous and fancier than ever. Isn't this how the
decline of Rome started?
</P>
<P>
   Three and a half bathrooms. That's the norm these days for a new
five-bedroom house, says property developer John Ciccolo. That's
norm as in ``average.'' Many people want more, a bathroom for every
bedroom, plus another on the first floor, and not the traditional
puny half bath, but a full bath.
</P>
<P>
   The smallest room is getting bigger and bigger, says Ciccolo, to
hold all sorts of fixtures, accessories, and equipment. Whirlpool
baths. Giant shower stalls that accommodate two or three people,
even a crowd. Multiple shower jets at various levels. Steam baths.
Saunas. Pedicure benches. Skylights. Radiant under-floor heating.
Dressing rooms. Make-up benches. Linen storage. Towel warmers.
Granite counter tops. Marble walls. Bidets. And silent, streamlined
toilets, artfully camouflaged or, preferably, hidden from view
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   All I wanted was a new sink. I had to have the best. I may have
imagined that a really nice sink would transform the dismal
bathroom in our new house and make me forget about the one and a
half baths we'd lost.
</P>
<P>
   Off I went to Splash, a bath emporium so upscale that no prices
are displayed. It's like a museum of plumbing. People mill around,
gaping at the latest in bathtubs and bidets, waiting for a
receptionist to summon them to a sales representative. It's best to
phone ahead for an appointment. Walk-ins may have a long wait.
</P>
<P>
   By the time it was my turn, I had examined every detail of every
sink in the place. I knew exactly what I wanted. I wanted to flee
Splash as quickly as possible. But first, I needed a sink. ``Good
choice,'' said the salesman when I told him what I wanted. He
consulted a catalog. ``You're lucky,'' he said. ``It's in stock:
$435.''
</P>
<P>
   Now for the faucets. ``Ooh, excellent choice,'' he said, looking
in the catalog. ``They're $857.''
</P>
<P>
   I was speechless. ``They're German, the finest made,'' the
salesman said. ``Your friends will be so impressed when they see
these faucets.''
</P>
<P>
   I told him we don't have that sort of friends. He recommended
some faucets in the $200 range. I wrote a check. He handed me a
yellow rubber duckie, the store mascot. I made fast tracks for the
parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I made a mistake. If I'd bought those $857 imported German
faucets, it's possible my friend would have been so dazzled by them
she would have overlooked the fact that we have only one bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   My real mistake, I think, was not going to Home Depot.
</P>

HOLBROOKE PUTS UN FOCUS ON AFRICA'S WARS, AIDS EPIDEMIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SAM ALLIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's Africa month at the United Nations, produced and
directed by Richard Holbrooke.
</P>
<P>
   As impresario, the US ambassador has earned kudos for using his
role as temporary president of the Security Council to orchestrate
an unprecedented focus on the troubled sub-Saharan region.
</P>
<P>
   From Vice President Al Gore to Nelson Mandela and a half-dozen
sub-Saharan leaders, Holbrooke has assembled a strong cast to
deliver a pointed message to UN diplomats and the rest of the world
that, morality tone poems aside, war and an AIDS pandemic will
destroy the continent if left unaddressed. And they threaten the
rest of the world as well.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when Holbrooke turns over the seat to his Argentine
counterpart at the end of the month, the limits of rhetorical power
will be clear. After the wave of Africa oratory has crested, the
same intractable issues will remain.
</P>
<P>
   To wit: How can the bloodshed in Burundi, the Congo, and Angola
be stopped for good? How can the sexual behavior of men and women
in the region be altered to reduce HIV transmission rates? Where is
the moral and political backbone of African leaders to stop war and
destigmatize HIV? What is the proper posture of the developed world
in general, and the United States in particular, in all of this?
</P>
<P>
   And, perhaps thorniest of all, what role will the pharmaceutical
giants play in an African AIDS solution?
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke has lauded Gore for his UN address Jan. 10 on AIDS at
the first Security Council meeting in the organization's history to
address a health issue. Gore promised at that time to help poor
countries obtain anti-HIV medicine at affordable prices, and
pledged to increase by $100 million the US commitment to fight AIDS
in Africa, bringing the total for its worldwide program to $325
million.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Holbrooke nor Gore has provided specifics about how such
inexpensive medical help will materialize. And while the increase
in funding is admirable, it remains puny compared to the $1.6
billion that the Clinton administration proposed last week in
foreign aid to Colombia to fight the drug war there. In Washington
Realpolitik, drugs at home trump AIDS abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council meeting on AIDS was historic less for the
presence of Gore, the first sitting vice president to chair the
body, than for the belated recognition that health crises are
security concerns.
</P>
<P>
   It shattered the distinction between ``soft'' and ``hard''
issues, according to Holbrooke, that has been delineated by Joseph
Nye, head of Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government and a
former Clinton State Department official.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of us have believed since the end of the Cold War that
the definition of security had to be broadened to include these
issues,'' Holbrooke said in an interview last week at his office
across the street from the United Nations. ``Joe Nye should stop
making those distinctions, because while they may work as a
taxonomy at the Kennedy school, they work to the disadvantage of
his goal in the real world.''
</P>
<P>
   Semantics aside, the harrowing numbers are now familiar to much
of the public: More than 22 million people in sub-Saharan Africa
carry HIV, almost 14 million have died from the disease, another 30
million will die in the next 20 years. Each day, 11,000 new HIV
infections occur.
</P>
<P>
   As public awareness grows, so will the pressure on
pharmaceutical giants like Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merck, and Glaxo
Wellcome to provide, at reduced cost or for free, more of their
life-saving anti-HIV medicine such as AZT, 3TC, and protease
inhibitors. At the World Trade Organization meeting last month in
Seattle, Clinton offered vague words about relaxing the
international intellectual property laws that protect the rights of
the pharmaceutical companies over the drugs they have invested
hundreds of millions of dollars to develop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intellectual property protections are very important to a
modern economy,'' Clinton said. ``But when HIV and AIDS epidemics
are involved, and like serious health care crises, the United
States will henceforward implement its health care and trade
policies in a manner that ensures that people in the poorest
countries won't have to go without medicine they so desperately
need.''
</P>
<P>
   No one knows just what this means. But some in the
pharmaceutical industry are clear about what it will not tolerate.
``We are not willing to abandon our intellectual property rights,''
said Shannon Herzfeld, vice president for international affairs of
the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the
Washington-based industry trade group. ``They are our lifeblood.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the large outfits Herzfeld represents have launched
their own projects in sub-Saharan Africa to improve the health care
delivery systems there. Last year, for example, Bristol-Myers
launched a $100 million program called ``Secure the Future'' to
train health care professionals and build health infrastructures in
five countries.
</P>
<P>
   According to the World Bank, sub-Saharan countries spent about
$5 per person on health care between 1990 and 1995. The annual
per-capita income in the region, excluding South Africa, is about
$300. Activists concede that these countries would be unable to
distribute and monitor anti-AIDS medication today even if the
pharmaceuticals decided to give away their medicine to the
HIV-infected poor.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have dismissed such efforts as window dressing. ``A few
million dollars here and a few million there do not constitute a
good-faith effort,'' said Sandy Thurman, who heads the White House
AIDS office. ``At the end of the day, somebody has to budge.''
</P>
<P>
   The industry as a whole has yet to consider a comprehensive,
long-term program addressing the incendiary issue of reduced
pricing of their anti-AIDS drugs for poor African countries.
</P>
<P>
   At the root of their hesitancy is the specter of activists in
this country demanding similar discounts here as well. And if the
industry bends on AIDS, what about heart disease? Or hypertension?
Where do you draw the line? Also, more than 90 percent of new HIV
infections occur in developing countries that are least able to pay
for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Differential pricing scares the pharmaceuticals. ``As an
industry, we can't address that. The individual companies make
those decisions all the time,'' Herzfeld said, referring to a
tiered approach. ``I don't think we can get together and carve up
the world in terms of pricing.''
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke doesn't buy it. ``They have to,'' he countered. ``This
is a catastrophic epidemic of plague dimensions. They are all
beginning to recognize, belatedly, that the policy has to evolve.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet movement has been glacial. Peter Young, who used to direct
Glaxo Wellcome's global HIV business and now runs Alphavax, a small
North Carolina biotech firm working on an AIDS vaccine, knows the
industry well.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the industry had been dealing with this whole thing
constructively, they could have preempted a lot of this,'' he said.
``It's always an easy choice to stay in the bunker. Most at this
point are keeping their heads down and hope it will just move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Some activists are about to mount a public campaign vilifying
the pharmaceutical groups to force them to bend. The Rev. Eugene
Rivers, the Boston minister who has launched a much-publicized
program to change sexual practices in sub-Saharan region, is
girding for battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The utopian view, which will go nowhere, is that they should
surrender their claims on intellectual property. It's a silly
proposition,'' Rivers said. ``The more realistic is a knock-down,
drag-out public fight that will lead to a negotiated settlement.
There has not yet been a full-scale movement to transform them into
the moral equivalent of Bull Connors.''
</P>
<P>
   Strong stuff. And counterproductive, according to Seth Berkley,
president of the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, a New
York-based nonprofit group that works with pharmaceuticals to find
a cure. ``That's the worst thing we could do,'' he said of the
Rivers stratagem. ``They need carrots, not sticks. Our challenge is
to get them to the table. You have to protect intellectual
property. Otherwise, a company will say, `We'd rather make Viagra.'
''
</P>
<P>
   Funded in part by Bill and Melinda Gates, who have donated $25
million, the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative has a pot of $80
million to provide venture capital to biotech companies working on
an AIDS vaccine. Rather than take an equity position, it gains the
marketing rights for the drugs, at cost, plus a small percentage in
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   Berkley is convinced that tiered pricing is critical to an AIDS
solution in Africa. But the pharmaceuticals need the political
cover of governments to adopt that approach. Thus far, such backing
has been absent, according to Young.
</P>
<P>
   ``Western governments must aggressively say that differential
pricing must be part of the picture,'' he said. ``I can't think of
a single Western government that has made an official statement
that they applaud differential pricing, or that they will structure
tax breaks or incentives based on price breaks.''
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke agreed with the tiered approach in principle, but he
steered clear of the specifics that flummox all sides. And he
flatly rejects the notion that the United States can affect change
in the sexual behavior of sub-Saharan Africans. ``This is the role
of the local leaders,'' he said. ``Even if we want to, the United
States cannot go out and do this.''
</P>
<P>
   His month of focus on Africa, then, is a campaign of words. The
hard part must occur elsewhere. Come February, his rhetorical
playbook on the AIDS pandemic gets thin. Then, when the klieg
lights are dark, it remains to be seen what his January offensive
will have produced. One need not be a cynic to wonder.

<P>
   LONDON _ Many Brits are pleased as punch with themselves these
days, as American celebrities increasingly ditch the States to take
up residence here in the capital of Cool Britannia.
</P>
<P>
   Madonna had bought a home and intended to educate her daughter
here. Tom Cruise and his Australian wife, Nicole Kidman, have
settled in St. John's Wood, near Regents Park, lauding the civility
of London over the madness of Hollywood. Woody Allen reportedly
will soon abandon his muse, Manhattan, for London.
</P>
<P>
   This has led many commentators here to remark on how London is
far more livable than big American cities like New York or Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   But not every American celeb is welcome here.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit A: Mike Tyson.
</P>

   The former heavyweight champ's arrival here to train for a fight
with a local underdog named Julius Francis has been one of high
drama and low farce. Because of his rape conviction and ear-biting
history in the ring, Tyson's entry into the country had to be
cleared at the highest levels of government and was challenged in
court by a feminist group. Tyson prevailed in court, and celebrated
by going out to the exclusive New Bond Street shopping district and
dropping more than $1.5 million on a bracelet and watch studded
with diamonds and sapphires.
</P>
<P>
   Then Tyson horrified Middle England, that imaginary barometer of
mainstream British opinion, by saying he was thinking about moving
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel more at home here than I do at home,'' Tyson said.
</P>
<P>
   While most people seem either appalled or apathetic that Tyson
is here, there is a small but vocal minority who see him more as a
misunderstood rebel than an ex-con. Hundreds of fans have been
drawn each day to the posh Grosvenor House Hotel, across from Hyde
Park, where Tyson is staying in a pair of adjoining suites which go
for $3,200 a night. The hotel's $16,000-a-day Park Suite has been
converted into a gym.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Tyson was given a hero's welcome in Brixton, the
heart of London's black community. Local politicians had said Tyson
should stay away. The people said otherwise, mobbing him and
chanting his name. The crowds became so frenzied that Tyson had to
take shelter in a place he normally doesn't go to willingly: a
police station.
</P>
<P>
   One can only imagine what Middle England made of the sight of
Tyson addressing an adoring throng by megaphone from the window of
the Brixton police station.
</P>
<P>
   But as 18-year-old William Jeffrey explained after he jostled to
get a glimpse of Tyson, many people in Brixton identify with Tyson
as someone who has faced the animus of the white establishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police stop me all the time, when I haven't done anything
wrong,'' the teenager said.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson was allowed into the United Kingdom last week despite a
law that bans anyone with a felony conviction from entering the
country. The British home secretary, Jack Straw, who next to Prime
Minister Tony Blair is arguably the most powerful man in the
nation, made an exception, saying too many small businesses in
Manchester, the northern English city where the fight is scheduled
for next Saturday, stood to go bankrupt if the bout was canceled.
Straw's decision set off a storm of protest and the ill-fated legal
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that the Brits don't like boxers. They finally have a
world heavyweight champion in Lennox Lewis. Muhammad Ali, who got
an even bigger reception when he visited Brixton last year, was the
near unanimous choice of British sportswriters as athlete of the
century in the year-end polls.
</P>
<P>
   But while Ali is revered here as a great athlete of great
principle, especially for his refusal to fight in the Vietnam War,
Tyson is widely seen as a vile and venal man. But Tyson's most
vocal critics are middle-class whites, a fact that engenders
support for him among minorities here who, while not defending
Tyson's past, can identify with being demonized.
</P>
<P>
   The Grosvenor, which is usually peopled by old money from both
sides of the Atlantic, has been transformed into a Fawlty Towers
episode. One day, a group from the Socialist Women's Party holding
placards denouncing Tyson and chanting ``Take rape seriously, no
respect for Tyson!'' had to be hustled out of the hotel's opulent
marble lobby. Tyson's bodyguards got jumpy and had to be restrained
from beating up the hotel gardener when they spied him snooping
around the bushes outside.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take Tyson long, meanwhile, to break the law. In the
wee hours of the morning, he went jogging in Hyde Park. The police
informed his handlers it is illegal to enter Hyde Park after
midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson's roadwork led one Metropolitan Police officer to resume
the crowing over London's superiority to Tyson's native New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care how tough Mike Tyson is,'' said the copper,
standing near the Grosvenor, ``he wouldn't go running in Central
Park at 3 in the morning.''

PROUD GERMAN PARTY MAY BE A VICTIM OF THE KOHL SCANDAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ As Helmut Kohl struggles for his legacy, and as his
Christian Democrats struggle for survival as a major party, the
political landscape of Germany has changed forever, even as the
campaign financing scandal caused by Kohl rages on.
</P>
<P>
   The suicide on Thursday of Wolfgang Huellen, who headed the
Christian Democrats' parliamentary finance office, gave a more
human aspect to the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   But the larger question, analysts say, is whether the Christian
Democrats who have ruled Germany for most of the time since the end
of World War II have mortally wounded themselves as a political
force.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl has admitted to taking at least $1 million in unreported
donations from 1993 to 1998, when he was defeated in his attempt
for a record fifth term as chancellor and stepped aside as party
leader. He said the money had been used to pay party expenses, and
that he gave his word not to identify the donors, although such
secrecy is a blatant violation of campaign finance laws enacted
under his administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will fight for my honor, and part of my honor is keeping my
word,'' Kohl said Thursday, after his forced resignation as the
party's honorary chairman. Kohl has characterized the scandal as a
witch hunt. It has triggered a criminal investigation and
parliamentary hearings in an effort to establish if his
administration traded favors for cash.
</P>
<P>
   While Kohl insists that the cash was good for the party, and
that the party was good for the country, politics in which the ends
justify the means seem to have ended in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, another German politician went to prison saying he
could not understand why he was being held accountable for the way
politics used to work. Egon Krenz, the last communist leader of
East Germany, was imprisoned in connection with border guards
killing people trying to flee from East to West.
</P>
<P>
   Krenz says he did nothing wrong, and insists that the end,
protecting the sovereignty of East Germany, justified the means,
shooting unarmed civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Joachim Krause, deputy director of the German Society for
Foreign Affairs, a Berlin-based think tank, has voiced doubt about
predictions that the Christian Democrats would implode because of
the finance scandal. But he said Kohl has placed the party in ``the
worst trial'' of its 55-year history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kohl did not change with the times; he did not modernize the
party,'' Krause said. ``He did away with good, bright people. They
were pushed aside and they were replaced with people who obeyed
Kohl, who did not contradict Kohl.''
</P>
<P>
   Krause said Kohl, the man who presided over the collapse of the
Berlin Wall, had borrowed a page from the communists when it came
to creating a party structure in which there was one boss, and in
which dissent was not tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``He centralized the party leadership, not with the same methods
of the communists, but with the same results,'' Krause said. ``The
party needs transparency and new people who have seen something
different.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who have had success in recent German politics have been
parties and politicians able to change traditional positions,
abandoning what they once considered nonnegotiable principles in a
pragmatic trade-off for real power.
</P>
<P>
   Like Bill Clinton and Tony Blair before him, Gerhard Schroeder
moved his Social Democrats from left to center, and he ended the
conservative Kohl's 16-year tenure. Likewise, Germany's Green Party
abandoned one of its core planks, pacifism, to back the war in
Kosovo and remain junior partner of Schroeder's ruling coalition.
The Green leader and the foreign minister, Joschka Fischer,
defended the first deployment of German troops since 1945 as a
necessary response to ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts say Kohl had never adapted, and had prevented
his party from doing so. He began as a provincial politician in the
Rhineland, the prosperous western state next to the border. For 25
years he ran the nation's biggest party _ and for 16 years its most
powerful office _ with all the parochialism and insouciance of a
rural constituency office. Ronald Reagan, George Bush, Francois
Mitterrand, and Mikhail Gorbachev were charmed by Kohl's
informality. Margaret Thatcher, however, found it repulsive.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to imagine Germany without the Christian Democrats,
whose conservatism and conventionality have made it the most
popular and dominant party for decades. Founded in 1945 with the
encouragement, and some would say at the direction, of the Allies,
the party has led the federal government, either alone or as the
senior partner of a coalition, from 1949 to 1969 and from 1982
until 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But many analysts have suggested that the Christian Democratic
parties that sprang up across Europe after World War II are losing
their relevance in a more politically sophisticated Europe,
especially since their role as a bulwark against communism became
meaningless after the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Democratic Party was a dominant force in postwar
Italy until 1993, when a corruption scandal initiated its
self-destruction. Such a fate now threatens Germany's Christian
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Hajo Schumacher, a journalist for Der Spiegel whose stories
alleging Kohl's corruption of German politics used to be dismissed
as left-wing propaganda, says the party is doomed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no one in the leadership that is not tainted by
this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Krause, the analyst, says the party will survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 600,000 party members,'' he said. ``There are good
people with new ideas among them. They need to be given a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Gunter Nooke, a Christian Democratic member of the Bundestag,
Germany's parliament, could be one of those to rise above the
scandal. Nooke has been a party member for just three years. He
says predictions of the party's demise are exaggerated, and are
usually partisan.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that ever happened, it would be horrible for German
democracy,'' he said, adding that is the reason he believed it
would not happen.
</P>
<P>
   Germans, he said, know that democracy has transformed their
society and would be reluctant to do anything rash to undermine it.
</P>
<P>
   Nooke says the answers for his party's survival lie within.
Offering what could become a mantra, he said, ``Only the party can
emancipate itself.''

BRADLEY TEMPERS LINE ON WELFARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL CROWLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES _ When Bill Bradley announced last year that he would
run for president, he strove to lay out clear differences between
him and his Democratic opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bradley and Vice President Al Gore had few disputes on
major policies. But Bradley singled out one contentious issue,
welfare reform, as a point of divergence that would highlight his
compassion for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   The sweeping welfare overhaul law, passed by Congress in 1996
and signed by President Clinton with Gore's support, ended federal
guarantees of cash assistance to poor mothers, transferred vast
amounts of money and control from Washington to the states, and
imposed new work requirements and time limits on welfare
recipients.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, the former senator from New Jersey, vehemently opposed
the legislation, calling it ``a poor person's nightmare.'' His
position had promise of a lively debate within the Democratic Party
over the historic shift in Washington's approach toward poverty.
</P>
<P>
   With the primary voting season starting, however, Bradley has
muted criticism of the law and discusses it only when asked. At
forums where welfare might be a natural topic _ like last Monday's
Democratic debate on racial issues in Des Moines _ Bradley did not
raise the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has Bradley proposed significant changes in the law,
although he does call for a $10 billion plan to eliminate child
poverty in America. Instead, he offers more of a wait-and-see
approach.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that states have been given ``essentially total
flexibility,'' Bradley said there was no certainty that governors
would adhere to the law's work requirements and time limits, which
allow a recipient a maximum of two years of federal aid without
working and five years of aid over a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll watch very carefully how it's implemented,'' Bradley said
in a recent interview. ``I'll be watching very carefully what
governors do or do not do.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's circumspect position might reflect the extent that the
measure, once denounced by many Democrats, has lost appeal as a
political issue, especially among the independent voters. With the
welfare rolls down by 43 percent from a 1993 level of more than 6
million families, many moderate Democrats describe the law as a
success of the Clinton-Gore era.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's position is a liability with mainstream Democratic
voters, said Will Marshall, president of the centrist Progressive
Policy Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Welfare reform ``collapsed the scaffolding on which much of
liberal policy rests,'' Marshall added. ``It was important for
Democrats to show they could move past good intentions and instead
produce a good result.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is hardly alone in tempering his words on an issue that
could prove politically perilous, especially in a general election.
Gore, for instance, is the author of the 1988 environmental
manifesto ``Earth In the Balance,'' but does not dwell on
environmental issues in stump speeches.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard University professor Cornel West, a Bradley supporter
who calls welfare reform ``Reagan-like,'' acknowledged the
difficulty in mustering public outrage at a time when the welfare
rolls are plummeting. ``It's hard to get a rational discussion of
it,'' West said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore supporters say Bradley has been forced to admit that a
central triumph of the Clinton-Gore administration has been
chopping the national welfare rolls by almost half and putting tens
of thousand of people into jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Bradley began by criticizing welfare reform but has yet
to offer anything in lieu of it,'' said Gore spokesman Chris
Lehane. ``To me that is something of a metaphor for his campaign.
He has big ideas, but you have yet to see these big ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley notes that the welfare bill he opposed in 1996 with 20
other senators, has since been improved by Congress by repealing a
cutoff of benefits to legal immigrants and adding billions of
dollars for job-training and placement programs.
</P>
<P>
   But he also argues that welfare reform has yet to be vindicated.
He says an economic boom has covered up the measure's flaws and
notes that while overall poverty is down in America, deep poverty
is rising slightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``That tells me there are underlying questions,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   The new system has done little to combat a breakdown of the
family, Bradley added, pledging to ``think of innovative ways to
deal with single parenthood.''
</P>
<P>
   If Bradley has avoided a clear plan for changing the welfare
system, however, his supporters say his overall campaign is largely
devoted to fighting poverty and includes specific proposals to
improve health care, education, and child care for the poor.

 UNDATED: ... to kids.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At Frank's network, appealing to younger kids has previously
been the exclusive province of the Nickelodeon channel, which is
beefing up its music programming to meet the demand of these new
consumers. Albie Hecht, president of film and TV entertainment for
Nickelodeon, voices the throw-up-your-hands sentiment echoed by
many adults. ``I think times have changed in general and we've all
just adjusted. I recently made a compilation of Beatles songs, and
it struck me that the innocence of that pop music just doesn't
happen anymore. We've all adjusted from `I wanna hold your hand' to
`Hit me, baby.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Ali's mother, Linda Gallagher, agrees. ``It's what the world is
like,'' she says. ``Short of home schooling, there's nothing to do.
I don't want to be Church Lady. You just try to set a great example
at home, cross your fingers, and throw them out into the world.''
Linda Gallagher has never even listened to the lyrics. ``All I know
is they're probably not saying `kill your parents.' It's, like,
`la, la, la, love is in the air,' right?''
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly. But interestingly, Ali doesn't listen to the lyrics
either. Asked what ``Baby, One More Time'' and ``Genie in a
Bottle'' are about, Ali says that _ despite the fact she can recite
all the words _ she ``doesn't really pay attention to what they're
talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Nickelodeon's Hecht believes that ``kids at each age
hear and see what their developmental level is adjusted to. At 6,
they're not translating the lyrics or the suggestions.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Jacobs Brumberg, however, parsing the lyrics may be
immaterial. A quick glance at the magazine layouts (Britney
Spears's recent Lolita-style spread in Rolling Stone showed her in
a strapless push-up bra, tight white briefs, and towering pumps,
surrounded by dolls and stuffed animals in her bedroom at home),
the come-hither videos, and provocative live shows bears out Jacobs
Brumberg's assertion that ``what girls learn from this phenomenon
is that female power resides in the ability to attract the opposite
sex.''
</P>
<P>
   The Disney Channel, which has functioned as a virtual
clearinghouse for the teen pop stars, and which features them
prominently in music specials and video programming, puts a rosy
spin on the phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The young kids look at them as big Barbie dolls,'' says Tina
Treadwell, executive director of talent development and music
specials for the Disney Channel, whose target age is 9 to 14.
``They want the outfits. The older kids are starting to feel a
sense of commonality. When Britney came out with the `Baby . . . '
video, she's in a school environment with the shirt and the little
skirt, the whole parochial thing. Yeah, she gave it a little bit of
rebel by tying her shirt up. But she was like an extension of the
cheerleading squad.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, but this particular cheerleader happened to be on her
knees, asking in no uncertain terms to be roughed up by an
ex-lover. ``It's an interpretation,'' Treadwell insists, echoing
songwriter Kipner. ``If we're not projecting our adult awareness,
`hit me' could mean `with your love,' or `with your dynamic
personality.' It's not what we might put on it. These are young
people trying to express themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but they're not. These are young people desperate to make it
in show business, willing to defer to the powerful men who can make
their dreams of stardom come true. Deborah Gibson, now 29 and
working in musical theater, remembers it well. ``Oh, they tried to
put that image on me, too. The male record executives always want
to put young girls in sexy clothes. It probably goes back to
caveman days.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibson fought tooth and nail to record her own songs and
preserve her identity. At 16, she says, ``I really wasn't in touch
with my sexuality enough to jump,'' as her handlers were urging her
to do, ``from point A to point D. I didn't want to skip B and C.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are tender years,'' says Gibson. And that goes for both
the ambitious young stars and the starry-eyed kids who adore them.
``You don't get them back.''

SEEING THROUGH PLACES 
Reflections on Geography and Identity 
By Mary Gordon. Scribner. 254 pp. $23. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is a staircase recalled from childhood simply a blend of wood
and light encased in memory, or does it hold far greater things _
joy and confusion and a certain color, say, or fear and intrigue?
Cloistered within the castle of the imagination, Mary Gordon has
spent much of her writing life describing interiors: the melancholy
hues of an introspective youth; the somber, even drab, tones of
Irish Catholic family life; the shadows of a father who promised
mystery and then died too young. These are all themes of her own
life narrative, and yet they have each appeared in various guises
throughout her fiction _ in several novels and a collection of
stories, she's created a milieu of such moody texture it could
scarcely belong to anyone else. In ``Seeing through Places'' she
returns to the palpable stone and shingle of that reality, sifting
through the detritus of the past in order to comprehend the
blueprint of the present.
</P>
<P>
   It's a Proustian notion, of course, romantic even as it's
hellbent on being anti-sentimental. So it doesn't surprise one that
Gordon spends the finest part of each of her days in the company of
Proust _ armed with her coffee and toast and dog, she faces the
dawn of a working life by reading 10 pages, every morning, from the
master. Precious few madeleines here, though: What we have instead
is the daunting house in Queens where her maternal grandmother
lived, to where she and her mother would return after Gordon's
father died when Mary was 7, and where a young intellectual's soul
and spirit would have to fight domestic ghosts _ those of shame,
ennui, and alcoholism _ in order to take flight.
</P>
<P>
   With each of its eight essays organized around a tangible
external influence, whether Gordon's physical world of play as a
child or her relationship with several priests, ``Seeing through
Places'' has set itself up as an architectural warren of memories.
It doesn't always work. The commanding first essay, ``My
Grandmother's House,'' creates a world thick with consciousness _ a
kitchen smelling of ricotta and cinnamon, a sick room with a far
less consoling ambience _ and yet Gordon's subsequent efforts to
maintain that depth often feel like the tacked-on wing of a house.
(Revealing what may be her own unease at this construction, she
continually posits rhetorical questions that end, oddly, with
periods instead of question marks, a desultory error that turns
them into muddy sentences instead of lofty inquiries.) But the real
story within these artifices is Gordon's autobiography, which is
what the reader wishes to glean. One scans the thematic conceit of
the book _ the neighbors in the house next door, the Catholic
retreats she accompanied her mother on, her later trips to Rome _
searching for the dark emotional reality that was taking shape.
This rich and more amorphous realm is what Gordon would transform
into fiction, from the suffocating bonds of familial love and duty
to the multilayered disappointments of a bad first marriage. Here,
such potential treasures are like too many fine possessions in a
cramped apartment: You want to see them shown off, under good
light, to far better effect.
</P>
<P>
   So my complaint is structural: Gordon's life narrative needed no
such add-on buttressing to support it. But so much sadness and
lonely alienation lurks within these pages _ hinted at, described
deadpan or stoically _ that perhaps she believed those confidences
required some superimposed edifice. What we find is a girl born in
oppressive though not uncommon circumstances. Gordon's father was
57, her mother 41; their marriage was not a happy one, but then joy
does not seem a commodity in great supply in the extended family
tree. When Gordon's mother left her own parents' home to marry, at
the age of 39, her father handed her a card with these words of
counsel: ``You will work till the day you die.''
</P>
<P>
   There are moments of grim cruelty all over the place in this
young life, only some of them unintentional; the very climate of
that house on the border of Long Island and Queens, where Gordon
would return for weekends even after she'd started college, seemed
surfeited with desolate withholding. In a cooking collaboration,
her grandmother continually let Mary the child burn her little
pastries in the oven, then taunted her with her own superior
efforts; when Mary the adolescent harmlessly back-talked her
mother, the woman slapped her. Watching her bedridden grandmother
die of stomach cancer, Mary, then 12, was inducted to change her
colostomy bag. But perhaps the oddest shock here comes from a
charismatic priest whom both her parents had befriended; the man
worshiped Mary's father, greatly admiring his mind and his
intellectual pursuits. When Gordon was a teenager, some years after
her father's death, she found a letter the priest had written her
mother just after the funeral. ``Say nothing to me of your grief,''
he had written. ``You, at least, had a child of his loins. I have
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   What is further surprising about such revelations is Gordon's
equanimity in recording them. Not for her the line of martyr; she
gave up that dream fairly early, along with an unquestioning
adoration of the lives of the saints and her belief in the supreme
cleansing of the confessional. For this was a child whose
introspection led her into dangerous alleys of freethinking _ of
art and literature and her own curiosity _ in preference,
eventually, to the more accepted corridors of religious passion. A
freshman at Barnard in the mid-'60s, she quickly traded in her
conservative woolens for bell-bottom jeans and found herself
chanting antiwar slogans instead of the rosary. Those days turned a
lot of would-be bankers and housewives into firebrands and seekers,
but the actual spiritual transformation she must have made _ from
pious Catholic girl to collegiate literary star _ is one Gordon
mostly skirts. Did it rock her world or break her heart, to give up
her utter devotion to religion's ordered universe? This
fragmentation is glimpsed near the end of ``The Architecture of a
Life with Priests,'' and it may be the most touching moment in the
book _ when the air itself seemed to change and the skies opened a
little, revealing neither overarching metaphor nor a judgmental
deity, but, simply, the light of day.
</P>
<P>
   Good writers of fiction do not choose their path casually; to go
there is to step away from reality in order to manipulate it, to
mold it into something deeper or higher. And it is usually a
disappointment to view the writer's ``place'' as though it might
present a key to the work: a room in Key West, say, or in Truro, or
on the Upper West Side. What you generally get when you look there
is four walls and a typewriter or computer screen; what matters, of
course, is the daily dose of Proust and the internal rhythms of
private song and the abiding passion to fill the page. Accordingly,
the presence residing within ``Seeing through Places'' is far more
vital than the room it seeks to describe.

GLASS ON `AKHNATEN' 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Philip Glass's ``Akhnaten'' is a famous opera by a popular
composer. There is a recording on Sony Classical, and two scholarly
books have been devoted to the work. Nevertheless, no one in the
world has seen a production of ``Akhnaten'' in 11 years _ it's been
that long since the final performance of the original production in
Stuttgart.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Lyric Opera's production of ``Akhnaten,'' which opens
Wednesday in the Shubert Theatre, is the third staging in the
work's history. The first was Achim Freyer's production in
Stuttgart; the second, seen in Houston, London, and at the New York
City Opera, was by David Freeman.
</P>
<P>
   Glass will not be in the Lyric's audience opening night,
although he plans to see a performance later in the run; he's
touring Australia with his ``Dracula'' music. Before heading for
the antipodes, he came to the phone to talk about ``Akhnaten''
(1984), the third work in his trilogy of ``portrait operas''
devoted to figures and issues that changed the world _ Einstein
(``Einstein on the Beach,'' 1976, ``science, technology and
ecology'') and M. K. Gandhi (``Satyagraha,'' 1980, ``politics:
violence and non-violence''). The subject of ``Akhnaten'' is not
only the Egyptian ruler from the 14th century BC but also
``religion: orthodoxy and reaction.'' Collectively the three works
created a major redefinition of opera and marked important
evolutionary steps in Glass's style; the works aroused interest,
praise, condemnation, and controversy. What is unquestionable is
that they also brought a whole new generation into the opera house
for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Glass says the idea of creating a trilogy was not his at all.
``The conductor Dennis Russell Davies was behind that. In those
days, he was moving around among opera houses. We had done
`Satyagraha' in Rotterdam, and then he became music director in
Stuttgart. They expected him to bring a new work with him, and he
asked me to think about one. I came up with the idea of Akhnaten
after stumbling across Immanuel Velikovsky's book `Oedipus and
Akhnaton.' Finally in 1989, all three operas were done together,
twice, over two weekends. People came from all over Europe and the
theater was completely packed. The productions by Achim Freyer were
really beautiful, although I wasn't as crazy about `Einstein' as I
was about the other two, but no one could have expected that any of
us involved in the original production would be _ we were too
committed to what we had done to accept something different so
easily. Then, as so often happens in Europe, the whole opera house
administration changed, and the new people decided they were not
going to do the trilogy anymore, even though it had been such a
great success with the public. The three operas never came together
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Glass admits he hasn't had much luck with trilogies. ``Since
then, of course, I did a second trilogy, this one based on works by
Cocteau. Two parts of it were performed in Boston.'' (``La Belle et
la Bete'' was presented by BankBoston Celebrity Series, and
`Orphee' by the American Repertory Theatre; the dance-opera ``Les
Enfants Terribles'' has not been seen here). ``No one has been able
to perform this trilogy together yet. Even if you consider the
works separately, it seems you have to wait about 10 years for any
piece to get into the next cycle of productions. Most companies
feel that if they are going to go to the trouble of putting on
something different, then they want to do a premiere. There's
something to be said for that _ I've been one of the beneficiaries
of this process!''
</P>
<P>
   For ``Akhnaten,'' Glass arranged an unusual double premiere in
Stuttgart and in Houston. ``With `Akhnaten,' I wanted two
productions coming out about the same time so that that the opera
could get off the ground in different versions, so that people
would not make the mistake of confusing the production with the
opera. There is an essential `Akhnaten' behind any individual
production that can be interpreted in different ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Glass does count himself lucky that ``Akhnaten,'' unlike some of
his other major operatic works, was recorded. ``The recording is
still available and it is rather good. One of the things I've
learned in this funny opera business is that a composer should
place as much priority on getting a recording made as he does on
rushing around trying to the get the opera produced. A recording is
what will eventually bring people back to the work. I wrote two
operas with Doris Lessing (`The Making of the Representative for
Planet 8' and `The Marriages Between Zones Three, Four and Five')
and because neither one of them was recorded, it has been a real
problem trying to get them done again. . . . In a certain way, a
recording of an opera is a lot more important than a production!''
</P>
<P>
   Looking back to his search for ``Akhnaten,'' Glass recalls a
drive down New York's Major Deegan Expressway with his young son,
now 27. ``He asked me who Major Deegan was, and I had no idea. It
turned out he ran the munitions dump during the La Guardia days. In
other words, he was a complete nobody who got a highway named after
him because he was a friend of a politician. In this country, we
honor politicians and soldiers, but the thing America is known for
in the rest of the world is its music, painting, sculpture, and
literature. Imagine naming an airport after Jackson Pollock! What
this got going through my mind was that I was interested in people
who changed the world through ideas, not through force of arms or
politics. I stumbled across Akhnaten through Velikovsky's book and
that was it.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that I moved on to Freud's `Moses and Monotheism.' We
don't really know whether Akhnaten was the guy who was the first
monotheist, but what an astonishing idea it was for this
18th-dynasty pharaoh to get rid of the whole pantheon of gods and
replace it with just one, identified with the sun _ not really the
sun, but the principle of the sun, the abstractness of the sun. The
Egyptians were very upset with him and the opera shows him being
overthrown, which may have been what happened. Akhnaten came from a
very conservative society, and for thousands of years, nothing much
happens, just one faceless pharoah after another, and then you go
to the Cairo Museum and walk into a room, and suddenly there's a
face, a human face. What an astonishing event this person must have
been in that culture, every bit as astonishing as Einstein or
Ghandi were in the 20th century _ even more astonishing, because
Akhnaten challenged every aspect of that culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Velikovsky, who published his book in 1960, was an amazing,
eccentric, and prescient figure. ``He was a very great intuitive
thinker who sometimes had trouble getting his facts together,''
Glass says. ``Many of his theories that people thought were
crackpot are now accepted; in his time he was dismissed as a
charlatan and an idiot. From Velikovsky's book, my first idea was
to write a double opera, an Oedipus opera and an Akhnaten opera
happening at the same time. During that very avant-garde period,
the way I was going to do it was to write one of them in two acts,
the other in three, so that while one of them was having its
intermission, the other one would still be going on. There's a
first libretto for this around somewhere. But the more I worked on
Akhnaten the more I got interested in him, and the less interesting
Oedipus became, so I said, `Why not get rid of this Oedipus
character?' Everything that is interesting about Oedipus is in the
Akhnaten story. Unloading the double opera problem released my
energy entirely to do `Akhnaten,' and to focus on what I was really
interested in.''
</P>
<P>
   What was there about Akhnaten's story that particularly
interested Glass? ``It was the fact that the history was in such
fragments. I got this idea of doing an opera made out of pieces,
like an Egyptian vase found scattered in pieces on the floor. I
thought of myself as looking at the pieces of history scattered
about. I liked the idea that I was like an archeologist in that
way; I didn't have to invent anything.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   There are several unusual and interesting technical aspects of
``Akhnaten.'' One of them was a matter of choice: Glass's decision
to entrust the title role to a countertenor. ``Akhnaten is such a
fabulously interesting and bizarre character _ how would I present
him in the opera house? I wanted in one stroke to set him off as
completely unique. Deciding to make him a countertenor did that.
Further, I had the idea that we wouldn't hear him sing until the
third scene, when this amazing sound comes out. Oh my God, this was
such a device, to set him off in that way. (The British
countertenor) Paul Esswood went over the whole vocal part with me,
because I didn't know that much about countertenors and had no idea
of how to write for them. Through his help, I was able to write a
singable countertenor part. He also looked at details of
orchestration, and showed me how the voice would work with them. He
is a very kind man, and I owe him a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   A second aspect is the absence of violins in the scoring. ``That
was a great stroke of luck, although I didn't realize it at the
time. The opera house was closed for renovations at that time, so
we had to perform in the playhouse next door, where they had room
for only 45 musicians in the pit. This was where we had to do it,
and I wasn't going to give up the commission. The simplest thing to
do was to get rid of the violins. I don't think I really understood
what was going to happen, but I wound up with a very dark
orchestra, with violas acting like the first violins, creating a
brooding, dark sound which became emblematic of the whole piece.''
</P>
<P>
   Akhnaten himself is associated with the shining sound of the
trumpet; the score also has an elaborate part for percussion _
neither brass nor percussion was featured in ``Satyagraha.' ``The
orchestras for the trilogy complement each other, which works out
well from the practical point of view when it comes to rehearsal.''
</P>
<P>
   The score contains several episodes that ought to appeal to the
Lyric's backbone, the mainstream operatic audience, including
Akhnaten's ``Hymn to the Sun'' (which is sung in English _ the rest
of the opera's libretto, assembled by Glass, Shalom Goldman, Robert
Israel, and Richard Riddell, is sung in Akkadian, Egyptian, and
Hebrew; there is also some spoken text in English, drawn from
Frommer's tourist guide to Egypt). There is a ravishing duet
between Akhnaten and Nefertiti, and a remarkable trio at the end of
the first act for Akhnaten, Nefertiti, and Queen Tye. ``I worked
out that trio with Paul Esswood so that when you listen, you might
not be able to tell who is singing which part, mezzo, soprano, and
countertenor; doing the cross-writing was very interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   In an amusing postscript to a lively conversation, Glass spoke
briefly about his next operatic project. ``I'm working on `The
Penal Colony,' based on Kafka, which will open in Seattle in
August. Herbert Perry, who was in `Orphee,' will be in it, and it
will be directed by JoAnne Akalaitis _ you will remember her
because she did so much work at the American Repertory Theatre.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed I did remember her for that _ but I also remember her as
the wife of Philip Glass. ``I've had such a long relationship with
her as a composer,'' he replied, ``that I sometimes forget I was
married to her! We have two children, but our real and lasting
relationship is an artistic one. I did a lot of Shakespeare with
her, and wrote the music for all her Mabou Mines pieces back in the
'60s and early '70s. We haven't done an opera together since 1983,
when she did `The Photographer.' She's a very interesting woman. .

GREETING THE MILLENNIUM OUTSIDE THE DOME 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINE TEMIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ A thousand years ago, at the last millennium,
Romanesque churches and cathedrals were going up all over Europe,
all dedicated to the glory of a Christian God and the sacrifice of
his son.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, Britain has marked the new millennium with a
$1.6 billion dome, paid for with National Lottery money, dedicated
to the glory of absolutely everything. Looking like a giant skull
pierced with spikes, the Millennium Dome's interior is a sprawling
mess divided into ``Zones'' that are superficial nods to every
aspect of life on planet Earth: ``Body,'' ``Mind,'' ``Talk,''
``Play,'' ``Money,'' and so on, all linked by stairs and catwalks,
and interspersed with commercial enterprises from McDonald's to
oyster bars.
</P>
<P>
   The art and architecture of those Romanesque churches had
purpose: The nave directed you to the altar; the statues encouraged
you to venerate saints. The Millennium Dome's most disturbing
aspect is its utter lack of purpose and direction, its namby-pamby
unwillingness to take any stand on anything _ including design.
</P>
<P>
   During my week and a half in London, just after New Year's, the
Dome made headlines every day, in every British paper, virtually
all the stories reveling in nastiness. Critic Adrian Searle got the
ball rolling last fall, writing in ``The Guardian'' that ``It has
beenmy millennium fantasy that the artist Christo will gift-wrap
the Dome for New Year's Eve, and that we mustn't unwrap it until
about August 2003.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the questions swirling around the unwieldy structure is
its fate after its scheduled one-year stint as mega-attraction.
It's not a space that lends itself to many uses. You can see it as
the Disneyesque theme park it already resembles, or maybe a
convention center, or maybe just a colossal objet, like the Eiffel
Tower, which was also intended to be temporary. Meanwhile, at least
on the day of my visit, the predicted crowds were not queuing up to
pay the Dome's $32-a-person entry fee.
</P>
<P>
   It's vast _ more than three times the size of the Colosseum in
Rome, and, the promotional literature tells you, big enough to hold
1,495 blue whales, although you can't imagine why they'd want to
live there. Despite the size, I can't recall ever being in a more
cluttered or claustrophobic environment. Dozens of designers
contributed to the interior; visual discord is the result. The
exterior, for all the eccentricity of those mastlike spikes
anchoring what is the world's largest roof, is more unified, thanks
to the Richard Rogers Partnership, the chief architects. And the
approach via the new North Greenwich underground station is a
marvel of comfort, convenience, and good design. Exiting the train,
you find yourself in a hall clad in gleaming dark-blue mosaics: Now
here's something that does evoke the mystical interior of a
Romanesque church.
</P>
<P>
   There is a paltry public-art component at the Dome, a few works
by such distinguished Brits as Richard Wilson and Anish Kapoor.
Most are swamped by their surroundings; even the super-friendly
guides (who outnumbered the paying customers when I arrived)
couldn't direct me to the art. An unmissable exception was Antony
Gormley's 80-foot-tall ``Quantum Cloud,'' a figure poised on the
remains of a jetty in the Thames, composed of 3,500 square steel
tubes, a bristling mass that magnetizes into a human being at the
center. Gormley's Everymen are big without blustering: His 65-foot
``Angel of the North'' looms protectively over the A1 highway in
the north of England, where 90,000 people drive past it each day.
``Quantum Cloud'' has been dubbed ``The Hedgehog,'' but to my mind,
it's a dazzling dissection of matter and man.
</P>
<P>
   You'd hardly know from the Dome, which is earnestly
multicultural, that there's still an official Church of England.
And the idea that the millennium celebrates a particular religious
event is all but buried. The ``Faith Zone'' represents every
religious sect with more than three believers, and spirals to an
exhausted conclusion in an oval room by the American artist James
Turrell. Turrell has spent 20 years turning an extinct Arizona
volcano into a maze of tunnels, pools, and places to watch the
moon. His Dome piece is typical in its perceptual disorientation _
you're sitting in it, yet you can't judge its size or even its
shape _ but Turrell's usual serenity is undermined by the sound of
the carnival chaos outside.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Rest Zone,'' meanwhile, reads like a corruption of a real
Turrell. It's a huge, curvy white womb room where you sprawl on
undulating, couchlike walls. Changing lighting effects and a
soothing soundtrack of gongs and echoes complete the atmosphere.
``Rest'' is what I felt the need of half an hour into my Dome
experience. &QL; 
 &QL; 
A bevy of collectors &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, advertising mogul Charles Saatchi, he of the
recent ``Sensation!'' sensation, was one of the few significant
contemporary collectors in London. Now there are many, thanks in
part to the cultivation efforts of the Tate Gallery, which has to
think ahead to filling its vast new Tate Modern, opening in May on
the South Bank of the Thames. (I'll write separately about the
Tate, which is poised to become the most exciting new museum in
Europe.)
</P>
<P>
   There are dedicated collectors on a sub-Saatchi stratum, too.
One of them, Gordon Campbell Gray, owns One Aldwych, the erstwhile
Edwardian newspaper building he's converted into one of London's
top new hotels, and filled with a collection of 368 (and counting)
artworks he selected himself, after ditching three art consultants.
The hotel lobby is dominated by Andre Wallace's sculpture ``Boatman
With Oars,'' a chunky figure wedged into a bathtub-size boat,
grasping 10-foot oars that stretch into a giant V. Sitting right on
the floor, the ``Boatman'' becomes a fifth at a table otherwise
seating four. You wonder what conversations he overhears.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety percent of what Campbell Gray owns he's bought directly
from artists: He's an habitue of open studio events in London's
East End. ``I have almost no artists anyone's heard of,'' he says
proudly, pointing to several postindustrial, rather gloomy
Sheffield townscapes by Richard Bartle: Campbell Gray's patronage
has enabled Bartle to give up his day job as a roofer and paint
full time. In One Aldwych's Indigo Restaurant is a particularly
daring choice, given the context: Tracey Davidson's ``Toast for
breakfast, toast for lunch, toast for tea and more . . . '' _ 192
slices of burnt toast sunk into wax, an homage to Davidson's youth,
when her father was in prison and her mother so short of money she
fed her children toast at every meal.
</P>
<P>
   There's no shortage of fine food at Indigo, and to work it off,
One Aldwych offers a spa and pool where another provocative artwork
is installed: Pol Bury's relief of white arrows on a blue ground,
some with poor posture and bulgy midriffs, as if in need of a
workout, and one that's supermodel perfect. It's the only work
Campbell Gray has ever bought at auction: He paid about $10,000 for
it at Sotheby's, on a whim. ``I'm not safe to be let loose in an
auction house,'' he says. &QL;

 LONDON: ... he says.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Around the corner from One Aldwych is the newly and glamorously
refurbished Royal Opera House at Covent Garden. Across the street
from the hotel is the Courtauld Gallery, which contains, among
other things, one of the world's great caches of Impressionist and
Post-Impressionist art, including Manet's ``Bar at the
Folies-Bergere.'' The Courtauld is housed in Somerset House, one of
England's most important 18th-century Georgian buildings, currently
under a restoration scheduled for completion in this millennial
year. (In architectural terms, the Brits took the millennium more
seriously than any other country, raising more than $6 billion for
various construction and restoration projects.) The facade of
Somerset House impresses; the vast courtyard is even more dazzling,
surrounded by majestic wings that were the first home to the Royal
Academy of Arts, which opened in 1780.
</P>
<P>
   In 1837, the Academy decamped to the 18th-century splendor of
Burlington House, on Piccadilly, where it's remained ever since,
steadily outgrowing its reputation for stodginess during the 23
years it's been led by exhibitions secretary Norman Rosenthal.
During Rosenthal's tenure, spectacularly popular shows ranging from
``Monet in the 20th Century'' (organized by Boston curator Paul
Tucker) to ``Sensation!'' to ``Africa: The Art of a Continent''
have drawn record crowds. (The irony of staging the most
comprehensive-ever examination of African art in a British building
that reeks of Empire occurred to not a few observers.) The smaller
of the two current shows at the RA is ``Amazons of the
Avant-Garde,'' up through Feb. 6, and transferring to New York's
Guggenheim Museum in June. It's a stab at catching up with the
women artists of early-20th-century Russian art, overshadowed by
male colleagues the caliber of Kasimir Malevich. The women in the
show _ Alexandra Exter, Natalia Goncharova, Liubov Popova, Olga
Rozanova, Varvara Stepanova, and Nadezhda Udaltsova _ were no
slouches, either. Their experiments with Cubism, Futurism, and
Suprematism were bold. Goncharova's ``Evangelists'' series of gaunt
Biblical figures, darkly outlined in the manner of Rouault, were
deemed sacrilegious by the Moscow censor. Popova, working in an
extremely sophisticated variation of Cubism, was the most
experimental, the least tied to her Russian roots. Rozanova, the
only one of the six who never visited Europe, developed the purest
abstract style of them all. As impressive as their individual
accomplishments as painters is their existence as a group of women
artists who would inspire others decades later. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More Royal treatment &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Academy's nod to the year 2000 is ``1900: Art at the
Crossroads,'' in London through April 3, and moving to New York's
Guggenheim in May. Through more than 250 paintings and sculptures,
the curators take a focused look at the years just before and after
the Paris World's Fair, the biggest international event of 1900,
one that showed off a brave new world of art and technology that
was not already accessible on the Internet and television, as the
world of the Millennium Dome is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Art at the Crossroads'' is a great counterpoint to the current
``ModernStarts'' exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New
York, although nowhere near as imaginative as the MoMA show, which
brings photography, advertising, industrial design, furniture, and
even a subway entrance into the mix, to show cross-currents in the
art and design world of 1880-1920. ``Crossroads'' may open with
Rodin's iconic ``The Kiss,'' but it's dominated by figurative
painting in many guises, a great deal of it academic, some of it
edging up to abstraction. It's fun to see what was prized a century
ago _ established masters such as Cezanne, upstarts like Picasso
and Kandinsky, and artists who now seem like nonentities.
</P>
<P>
   Artists from 28 countries, from Iceland to Japan to Australia,
were represented at the Paris Fair. Pluralism is likewise the RA
show's theme, along with the idea that Impressionism wasn't the
sole parent of Modernism, that there wasn't a tidy progression of
styles.
</P>
<P>
   Winslow Homer's dignified starlit close-up of a sailor, ``The
Lookout _ All's Well,'' on loan from the Boston Museum of Fine
Arts, holds up well against Alfred Guillou's overwrought 1892
``Farewell,'' in which two drowning lovers draped on an overturned
boat meet for a final kiss. She's already lost her blouse, poor
thing, perhaps a painterly ploy to attract turn-of-the-century
viewers.
</P>
<P>
   In a room of portraits _ the show is arranged thematically _ one
of the most radical is Russian painter Michail Vrubel's ``Portrait
of Nadeschda Sabela-Vrubel at the Piano,'' composed of discrete
splotches of paint, thickly laid on, barely describing a figure.
Next to it hangs Sargent's ``Mrs. Carl Meyer and Her Children,''
recently shown in Boston, which, except for its bird's-eye
perspective, is all silken conservatism by comparison; it reminds
you how unadventurous Sargent could be.
</P>
<P>
   The wackiest work in the show is Leon Frederic's giant triptych
``The Stream,'' in which hundreds of naked babies tumble forward
from an idyllic landscape of waterfalls and birch forests. The
oddest label accompanies Henry Ossawa Tanner's ``The
Annunciation,'' in which the angel is represented only by light and
the Virgin slouches casually. Tanner's is the only label I noticed
with any biographical material: It identifies him as an
African-American, which seems a self-righteous touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crossroads'' ends with a room of self-portraits from the age
that saw the dawn of psychoanalysis. Most radical of all,
surprisingly, is by that arch-academic, Jean-Leon Gerome, whose
``Optician,'' an ad for that profession, shows the artist's eyes in
a pair of disembodied glasses. The painting was later praised as a
forerunner of Surrealism by none other than Salvador Dali.

FOR `ANGELA'S ASHES' EMILY WATSON SHELVES HER `MAD SCREAMER' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Yes, Emily Watson says, she's playing a pained
character again: Frank McCourt's struggling mother in the film
version of ``Angela's Ashes,'' based on McCourt's recollections of
growing up poor in Limerick, Ireland. But this time there's a big
difference. Since bursting upon the film world in 1996, as the
devout, tormented wife of a paralyzed oil-rig worker in ``Breaking
the Waves,'' Watson proceeded to portray a woman smothered by
Ireland's civil strife in ``The Boxer'' and the late cellist
Jacqueline du Pre, beset by emotional pressures and multiple
sclerosis in ``Hilary and Jackie.''
</P>
<P>
   To exorcise those heavy-duty roles and the psychic toll attached
to them, Watson has come to refer to them as ``mad screamers.'' But
Angela McCourt, trapped in endless rain and poverty, constantly
struggling to keep her kids fed, is the opposite of a screamer,
says Watson, fighting jet lag while soldiering through a round of
interviews. Soon she'll phone her husband, writer-actor Jack
Waters, at their home in London, where she snatched a few hours of
sleep before heading to Manhattan from a shoot in Budapest. Angela
is loaded with strong feelings, Watson continues, ``but they're
never expressed, they're not revealed. There's no explosion.
There's no kind of emotional payoff. It's just a slow burn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Which is true to life,'' Watson says. ``You know. You don't
get your third act for Christmas. You don't get a big dramatic
climax in real life. And this is a true story. It travels a very
direct and pure route from the pain of Frank McCourt about his own
life. No producer has meddled with the honesty of the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a challenge working with the children. Angela had seven
children altogether. Three died. When you ask me if Angela was a
defeated woman, I have to say yes and no. She has a nervous
breakdown at the word go, really, when she loses her first child,
and then struggling to keep her head above water. The material is
so powerful, it's bewildering. At the end of the day, Alan (Parker,
the director) would say, `Great work,' but something would be
nagging at the back of your mind. Then you'd think, `Oh yeah, my
baby died.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Angela does keep her family together. She manages somehow to
feed them and keep them alive. She's very human, very fallible. She
has a very strong mother-fighting-for-her-children instinct. Her
life is very much a life of self-sacrifice for her children. And
then her husband just sort of drifts out of their life. There's not
even a goodbye. The biggest challenge was trying to convey all
Angela was feeling without the outbursts. With no outbursts. It's
interesting because everything in the book is perceived from
Frank's point of view. Her perception comes from somebody else. So
in a sense I had to take her away from Frank and make her my own.
Tens of millions of people have an idea of Angela, and you can
never compete with that. You just have to approach it from a point
of, well, this is how I feel.''
</P>
<P>
   There were other challenges attached to the specifics of
personifying a character with whom millions of readers strongly
identify. Watson, costar Robert Carlyle, and director-adapter
Parker realized they would not have the luxury of working things
out on the set or improvising because they were acting with
children, for whom things had to be clear, defined, and direct.
Almost all the work of character formation, therefore, had to be
done off the set in Dublin.
</P>
<P>
   ``My point of departure for a role is the sound of the voice.
That, and the kind of physical energy,'' Watson says. ``I went to
Limerick, just trying to connect. I struggled for a few days to
find the rhythm. There's a rhythm of Irish construction, and it's
very different from English. The Irish just have a turn of phrase.
It's just never prosaic in any way. So it was literally finding the
physical voice, not as mimicry, but because within the sound of the
physical voice is encapsulated almost everything you need to
know.''
</P>
<P>
   What Watson didn't foresee was how tired she'd get at the end of
a day of shooting that required her to hold baby twins in her arms.
Also, there was the real-life Angela's tobacco habit: Every day,
Watson smoked 40 Woodbines, Angela's favorite brand.
</P>
<P>
   Watson, whose face can encompass an enormous range of
expression, is also prominent in Tim Robbins's current ``Cradle
Will Rock,'' playing a jobless, homeless street person who ends up
singing the lead in Marc Blitzstein's 1937 social-protest opera _
and making theatrical history when the show goes on in the face of
government efforts to shut it down. Watson loved the passion of the
project and the passion of the era. ``I'm surprised that more
Americans don't know the story of censorship in America in the
1930s,'' Watson says. ``Every city was doing plays about
up-to-the-minute events. There was all this upheaval and unrest,
and the theater was right there dealing with it.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a certain irony, Watson is the first to admit, in her
having been catapulted to prominence by a series of roles depicting
women struggling against their surroundings. ``I had a very happy
childhood,'' says Watson, who grew up in the north of London. Her
mother was a teacher, her father an architect. ``I had a particular
combination of being quite protected, and in a liberal and
imaginative atmosphere. In a way, I feel safe. I'm able to take it,
as it were, in very difficult situations. I think you have to allow
yourself the possibility of being absolutely floored and not
protected by something.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Watson doesn't look forward to working the sunny side
of the street for a bit. She plays the title role in Alan Rudolph's
upcoming ``Trixie,'' describing it as ``a would-be private
detective in Chicago who's several sandwiches short of a picnic.''
The film she's shooting in Europe, ``The Luzhin Defense,'' based on
a Nabokov adaptation, finds Watson playing a character she
describes as ``a bit of a first for me, a nice girl, from a
chess-playing Russian emigre family living in the Italian lake
district. I fall in love with John Turturro's unsuitably wild,
crazy, genius chess player. He's the mad screamer in this one. It's
nice to have somebody else do it!''

VOTERS NOT EASILY WON OVER IN NEW HAMPSHIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MERRIMACK, N.H. _ Wendy Greenland is the kind of vital voter
that George W. Bush calls a ``tire kicker.'' She has heard four
presidential candidates in person, and she stopped at a Bush rally
here last week to give the Texas governor a last chance to win her
over.
</P>
<P>
   But if Greenland was hoping for a new reason to back Bush, she
did not hear it. Bush's speech was almost word-for-word identical
to what he has said here for nearly a year. And his campaign
refuses to acknowledge any reason to change its strategy, even
though Senator John McCain is running ahead of him in polls here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a lot of canned answers,'' Greenland said. She
said she will vote for McCain. To be sure, others in the audience
were impressed. Sally Zink of Bedford, for example, said Bush's
comments were reassuring. ``I really liked his message of hope and
optimism,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bush campaign is likely to rise or fall in the first
primary state on how the candidate connects with tire kickers such
as Greenland. US Representative Charles Bass of New Hampshire, who
accompanied Bush, warned the governor as long ago as last May that
the state's undecided voters could move against him in the last two
weeks before the Feb. 1 vote.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Bass said after watching Bush's performance, he is more
convinced than ever that the race will be a blowout. Bass is just
not sure whether Bush or McCain will be the victor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it will be close,'' said Bass, a knowledgeable
observer of state politics. ``It will either break one way or the
other. It could go either way.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unusual for such a high-ranking elected official to
acknowledge that his candidate could lose by a large margin. But to
Bass, it is a simple matter of understanding New Hampshire
politics. In the past, whoever wins the Iowa Republican caucuses
usually is defeated here. In the most telling example, Bush's
father, George Bush, won the Iowa caucuses in 1980 but then lost
here to Ronald Reagan. George W. Bush, who well remembers his
father's defeat here 20 years ago, is trying not to repeat history.
</P>
<P>
   But for longtime Republican observers, the trend is alarming.
Bush is expected to win the Iowa caucuses easily, where McCain is
not competing, but New Hampshire may be poised to repeat its
history and go for the insurgent, McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Another top Bush adviser, Thomas D. Rath, has repeatedly warned
Bush about the way New Hampshire voters tend to move quickly in the
final days. Rath said he would not be surprised if two-thirds of
the voters change their minds or decide in the few days before
casting ballots.
</P>
<P>
   But even as he has dropped in the poll standings here, Bush has
firmly resisted any temptation to change his style, his substance,
or his strategy. Bush is convinced he will win the nomination
regardless of what happens in New Hampshire, so he doesn't want to
make a desperation move that would look bad elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``A campaign is, by the way, to say the same thing at the
beginning of the campaign as at the end of the campaign, so people
are clear about my positions,'' Bush said. ``I'm not going to
change my tax cut plan. It is going to be the same thing I say
today as I will say next October, so should I win, there will be no
doubt in anybody's mind that this has been endorsed by the American
people.''
</P>
<P>
   While all candidates repeat the same phrases, Bush's speeches
are notable for being practically verbatim from early last year. He
jokes that he ``did a fabulous job of picking parents'' and that
his wife, Laura, has ``been a fabulous first lady of Texas'' and
that one of his daughters told him, ``You're not as cool as you
think you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some of the most tortured avenues of speech remain. Bush
still says, ``I've got a plan to keep prosperity alive. It starts
with tort reform.'' The line gets the same quizzical looks as it
did a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he long ago decided to campaign on only a few big
issues. ``It is important not to campaign on all kind of issues,''
Bush told a crowd of mostly students at Merrimack High School. He
recalled that when he was elected governor of Texas, reporters
asked when he would talk about more than the four major issues he
addressed in the campaign. Bush said he never gave in to the
questioners.
</P>
<P>
   But the danger for Bush is that the major focus of his campaign,
spending the budget surplus on tax cuts, may not be resonating with
voters. Polls show that the majority of Republicans prefer smaller
tax cuts and using the surplus to shore up Social Security, similar
to a proposal made by McCain. The result is that Bush's campaign
here has been played lately on McCain's turf, even though the
Arizona senator said little about his tax plans until a few weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone listening to McCain will often hear him say that his plan
is more ``prudent'' than Bush's. This reference alludes to Bush's
father, who was so concerned about carefully dealing with the
budget and other matters that one of his best-known phrases was
``wouldn't be prudent.'' McCain's message is that George W. Bush's
plan wouldn't be prudent.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Hughes, Bush's spokeswoman, said it is important for the
governor to stay ``on message'' every day.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to court the tire kickers, the Bush campaign
recently began to target mailings to such groups as professional
women, veterans, retirees, and younger voters. The campaign also
arranged for Bush's brother, Florida Governor Jeb Bush, to write a
letter to thousands of New Hampshirites who head to the Sunshine
State at this time of year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may know my older brother, George W. Bush,'' Jeb Bush
wrote, urging residents to apply for an absentee ballot ``if your
plans call for a winter getaway. . . . The election will be
close.''
</P>
<P>
   The tire kickers Bush is courting tend to be Independents, who
make up 37 percent of the electorate in this state. The problem for
Bush is they not only kick the tires, but also they change them
frequently.
</P>
<P>
   Even Sally Zink, the Bedford woman who ``really liked'' Bush's
speech, wouldn't commit herself.

GORE TARGETS EDUCATION, ECONOMY FOR FINAL N.H. PUSH  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Shifting into the final phase of his New
Hampshire primary campaign, Vice President Al Gore arrives here
Tuesday with a question for voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm asking people, `Can we do even better?' '' said Gore
during a telephone interview this weekend from Waterloo, Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   The question, he said, comes in response to another question his
opponent, Bill Bradley, has posed to the farmers of Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of weeks ago, Senator Bradley said, `Are we better
off now than we were seven years ago?' Throughout New Hampshire and
New England, the answer is obvious,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   As he crisscrosses the Granite State, Gore said he plans to
remind voters of a not-so-distant but very bleak past, when the
state was losing 10,000 jobs a year. He wants voters to remember
how far they have come from that recession. And he intends to issue
a challenge, too, for an even better future on education, the
economy, and health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer to his question is obviously yes, but the question
is, can we do even better?'' Gore said. ``This message is one that
embodies proposals in the economy, health care and education and
really provides a blueprint for answering that question with a
resounding yes.''
</P>
<P>
   --On the economy, Gore plans to remind voters here that today,
jobs are being created at a rate of 16,000 a year, and New
Hampshire has the highest concentration of high-tech jobs in the
nation. He said he wants to continue the pace by maintaining a
balanced budget and paying down the national debt each year.
</P>
<P>
   --On health care, Gore will reminisce about protecting Medicaid
from assaults by Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker. Now, he
said he wants to provide coverage for every child by taking steps
that ``are both bold and practical.''
</P>
<P>
   --On education, Gore said he will remind voters that the
administration hired 100,000 new teachers and connected students to
the Internet. Now, he said, he wants to bring ``revolutionary
change'' to education from pre-kindergarten to post-high school.
``I will make the greatest commitment to education since the GI
bill,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is winnowing his message into a few easy-to-remember
topics, similar to the way Bradley has campaigned this year.
Bradley has said that he is seeking a mandate, should he be elected
president, and he sticks to health care, gun control, child poverty
and race relations when speaking to voters.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has criticized Bradley for that approach, and he insisted
that he is laying out an agenda not just on a single challenge, but
on all the challenges facing the voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in my heart it's just the beginning,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past year, Gore has made several adjustments to his
campaign style and message, struggling for the right tone and
substance to impress voters. Initially, he approached the Granite
State as a vice president, with staged backdrops of blue drapery
and the official seal on a tall, formal podium. When a Boston Globe
poll showed his appeal to voters was plummeting in the face of
Bradley's challenge, Gore decided to throw out the White House
props and get closer to the people.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore was also paying close attention to the lofty rhetoric
and the limited number of issues Bradley was using to inspire
people. Frequently, Bradley will ask voters, ``if not now, when?''
And Bradley himself was the first to insist ``we can do better.''
</P>
<P>
   As Gore focuses on education, health care, and the economy, and
as he asks voters if it is not possible to do better, it appears he
is engaging in the sincerest form of flattery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gotten a whole lot better as a communicator and a
candidate,'' Gore said of the metamorphosis of his message over the
year. ``Partly, it's in response to the stiff competition from
Senator Bradley and the fine people helping him. Partly, it's in
response to the suggestions and advice my friends and supporters
have offered. But mostly, it's the result of total immersion in
this intensive conversation with people in New Hampshire and Iowa
and elsewhere and learning the music of the year 2000,'' Gore said.
``Once you catch the tune, it stays with you.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are voters who have yet to make up their minds, and
Gore calls these last days crucial to his race.
</P>
<P>
   ``For one thing, there are people I have not yet met personally
and I want to continue and even step up my efforts in the final
week to meet as many people as possible,'' he said. His schedule
includes rallies to energize supporters, tours of successful
businesses to show off the economic progress of the state, and a
whirlwind of hand-shaking at factory gates, cafes, and in
neighborhoods. He will be hitting Democratic strongholds, such as
Manchester, Nashua, Portsmouth, Concord, and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he does not believe any of the polls that have just
begun to show his support slightly surpassing Bradley's.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said the polls are ``just fleeting snapshots in time'' and
that the majority of them still show Bradley ahead in New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he continues to approach the race as if he were far
behind his opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm campaigning like an underdog, whether I am or not,'' said
Gore, who is also banking that his volunteers will feel the same
way. ``All of these folks that are helping me are filled with the
kind of determination that is not deterred by any of these public
opinion polls that are going up or down or sideways.''

BUSH'S ATTACKS ON MCCAIN TAKING THEIR TOLL _ ON BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; PELLA, Iowa -- Not to put too fine a point on it, but George
W. Bush has attacked John McCain in a television commercial for
sins he has not committed, on the basis of information whose
veracity Bush cannot support, and in violation of a promise he made
with McCain that he sealed with a public handshake.
</P>
<P>
   And he keeps attacking fellow preppie Steve Forbes for the crime
of negative campaigning, which he and his supporters are themselves
engaging in with rapacious intensity.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder it's beginning to look like Forbes has the potential
to embarrass Bush here, to hold our president-in-waiting to his
standard gentleman's C in the Iowa caucuses. No wonder McCain ties
him in knots in New Hampshire with a deft blend of accessibility,
authenticity, and common-sense conservative reform. And no wonder
his mom has taken to saying that Bush ``should'' be president, as
if the Oval Office were a codicil in his trust fund.
</P>
<P>
   But the best evidence that the governor is having more than the
standard near-death experience that every front-runner must endure
is the lack of response to his message, which for the moment is
flat as a pancake.
</P>
<P>
   I've caught the act a half-dozen times down the stretch, and the
desultory atmosphere never varies from what it was here in heavily
Dutch south-central Iowa, known for manufacturing windows and
growing tulips. With 500 residents listening at Central College,
the pitch for his massive tax cut gets the polite applause of
perhaps a third of the audience _ about what happens when he
promises to ``earn the respect of our men in uniform.''
</P>
<P>
   The lines that get loud, sustained applause are always the same
_ the pledge to bring ``dignity'' to the White House that touches
the anti-Bill Clinton chord in all Republicans, and his vow to run
a positive, optimistic campaign focusing on issues. Polling data
now confirm this, but the point that income taxes are something
less than the holy grail has been apparent since last summer, when
GOP legislators dashed home to sell their
almost-as-preposterous-as-Bush tax bill, only to find the public
more interested in paying down the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is only compounding his problems by attacking McCain and by
making a charge that even he admits has no supportive evidence. It
started in the debate last weekend, when Bush asked McCain a
leading question that anticipated his false TV commercial. The Bush
thesis was that McCain would raise income taxes by $40 billion over
five years on ``working people'' by ``taxing'' their ``benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush was playing an old trick. McCain's proposal is sketchy in
parts, and it doesn't specify which fringe benefits would no longer
be tax deductible for employers as part of the $151 billion in
so-called corporate welfare tax breaks for special interests that
McCain wants to end to help fund a tax cut roughly twice that
amount.
</P>
<P>
   What Bush did was fill in the blank himself, assuming without
evidence that McCain was proposing the elimination of deductibility
for all fringe benefits, including continuing education and health
care provisions. He then falsely claimed the result would ``impose
a $40 billion tax increase on employees'' and was off to the races,
even invoking its alleged impact on a ``single mom.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor was not doing anything different from what his dad
did in New Hampshire 12 years ago with a similar attack that
destroyed Bob Dole on taxes without benefit of truth. But this is
now, and not only are a lot of people sick of this kind of
campaigning, but this is an era of budget surpluses when the notion
of paying down debt has traction, including with many Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   He also has hurt himself with a silly argument that the
alternative to his $1.4 trillion proposal is ``keeping the money in
Washington'' for spending by dastardly politicians. This has left
him open to McCain's counter that by ``spending'' he must be
refferring to the senator's proposals to invest in Social Security,
Medicare, and defense, and that no legislator has a better record
as a pork-fighter than McCain.
</P>
<P>
   When a bunch of us pinned him down after his appearance here,
Bush could not defend the assertion in the commercial, could not
cite anything resembling it in the material McCain has released,
and was left with the lame assertion that at least his proposal is
more detailed.
</P>
<P>
   He also bristled, and his staff was truly angry, at questions
suggesting that his campaign tactics against McCain aren't really
different from Forbes's assaults on his proposal two years ago in
Texas that mixed some business and sales tax increases in with a
property tax cut to reform the system for funding education.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference is I had a real tax cut,'' he said. Well, so
does McCain.
</P>
<P>
   When he then protested, famous smirk in clear view, ``I'm not
criticizing Senator McCain,'' the only response was titters.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Ronald Reagan, who beat the other Bush 20 years ago for
the nomination, Governor Bush is going after that prize from the
top down, not from the grass roots up. It still may be enough to
prevail in the end in this still-hierarchical party.
</P>
<P>
   But ever since the straw poll put on by the party her last
August, Bush has been at best a mediocre candidate in Iowa and a
wretched one in New Hampshire. Adversity made Al Gore better; it is
making Bush worse.

LABOR OF LOVE AIMS TO MAKE GORE THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. JORDAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Despite the risk, organized labor is going all out for Al Gore
_ in New Hampshire and across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that labor supporters have been out in force for
Monday's Iowa caucuses may be contributing to the huge lead Gore is
holding over Bill Bradley, his rival for the Democratic
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   As Hugh Winebrenner, a political specialist at Drake University
in Des Moines, said in a recent New York Times interview, ``The
Democratic Party in Iowa depends on the activism of organized
labor. Labor will play a very significant role in the caucuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Labor officials say that Iowa has 184,000 union workers; that
means that one out of every seven workers is union-affiliated.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's campaign aides have acknowledged that labor is playing
a significant role in Iowa. As one spokesperson said, ``Their
organized clout is real.'' He said that Bradley had tried to enlist
their support,``but they went the other way. We respect that.''
</P>
<P>
   While Gore is expected to win in Iowa, the stakes are higher for
him, and for organized labor, in New Hampshire, where only one out
of 10 workers is a union member.
</P>
<P>
   A Gore victory in New Hampshire would be viewed as a victory for
organized labor and working families. If Gore loses, it may viewed
by his opponents and some political pundits as a big loss for
labor.
</P>
<P>
   But national labor officials, including John Sweeney, president
of the AFL-CIO, believe it's worth the risk to make a big
commitment to Gore even in New Hampshire, where organized labor is
not as strong as in other New England states.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls have shown Gore closing the gap on Bradley there,
if not moving slightly ahead. Much of Gore's momentum comes from
his performances in debates against Bradley. But labor's efforts
may also be paying off. Activists from Massachusetts, Maine, and
Connecticut have gone to New Hampshire to canvass on behalf of the
Gore campaign, and they believe their efforts have contributed to
his recent edge.
</P>
<P>
   As one Massachusetts labor activist pointed out, about 20
percent of the New Hampshire residents who are union members
actually belong to locals headquartered in Massachusetts, and the
vast majority of them are expected to back Gore. In addition,
political activists from national as well as local AFL-CIO offices
have been working in New Hampshire on Gore's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Rogers, political director for the Massachusetts
AFL-CIO, noted that Sweeney's commitment to Gore began early, has
intensified in recent weeks, and will continue throughout primary
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been moving some volunteers up there for the past few
weeks,'' Rogers said, ``and the response among unions based on our
phone banks is very good. The union density in New Hampshire is not
as strong as it is in Massachusetts, so that limits us to a certain
extent.''
</P>
<P>
   On a national level, labor leaders have been viewing the growth
of union membership to 16.5 million in 1999 _ an increase of
265,000 workers from the year before _ as a growth in political
clout for the 2000 election. Sweeney himself predicted that, with
this increase, the nation is ``going to see the largest and most
significant activity that grass-roots workers have exercised in any
political election.''
</P>
<P>
   Organized labor is working to counter huge corporate spending on
its apparent chosen candidate, George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a survey from the Center for Responsive Politics, a
political think tank, businesses contributed $666.6 million to
candidates and parties in the 1998 election, while unions
contributed $60.8 million, an 11-to-1 ratio.
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO attempted to counter this spending mismatch by
bringing more working families into the political process. That
mobilization helped Democrats gain five seats in the House in the
1998 election, and prompted Sweeney to say that those elections
ushered in ``a new era of people-powered politics.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt Sweeney and other labor leaders are also aware that if
Gore loses in states where labor is even stronger than in New
Hampshire, states such as Massachusetts, it could further diminish
the political clout of organized labor, as well as demoralize
unions and working families backing Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But even if Gore loses New Hampshire, organized labor is not
going to throw in the towel. Gore is still expected to win the
Democratic nomination. And what Sweeney and other labor leaders are
looking toward is the Gore-Bush showdown.
</P>
<P>
   Organized labor's active involvement in the 2000 election sends
a strong message that its growing numbers for Gore may carry as
much political weight as the number of dollars filling Bush's
campaign coffers.

MORAL LEADERSHIP CALLS FOR TAKING A STAND 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The Confederate flag in South Carolina and
ballot access in New York may be totally unrelated issues in the
real world. But in the supercharged atmosphere of presidential
politics, they have found a common target in George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   And the Republican front-runner's efforts to dodge both weaken
his own vow to usher in an era of moral leadership in the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   To the Texas governor, a growing controversy over the
Confederate banner is a mine field. Whatever his personal feelings,
he has repeatedly refused to say whether South Carolina should
continue to fly the flag over its statehouse. It's a local issue to
be decided by South Carolinians, he says.
</P>
<P>
   The flag that represents slavery and racism to millions of
Americans represents something else _ heritage _ to many of the
voters that Bush is wooing in South Carolina's Feb. 19 primary.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts by some New Yorkers to keep Arizona Sen. John McCain,
Bush's main competitor for the GOP nomination, off the March 7 New
York primary ballot also are a local issue, Bush contends.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, pass the buck to someone else, he insists.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, Bush is correct. The people of South Carolina,
through their elected state officeholders, should have the right to
decide what to put atop their state capitol.
</P>
<P>
   And the people of New York, within constitutional restraints,
should be able to set the criteria that political candidates must
meet to qualify for the ballot in their state.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's ``local issues'' dodge also is pretty thin.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, New York has one of the toughest _ if not the
toughest _ ballot access laws in the country. Bush supporters there
are largely behind the effort to disqualify McCain's petitions in
17 of New York's 31 congressional districts, and if they are
successful, Bush would largely benefit.
</P>
<P>
   So it's disingenuous of Bush to try to suggest that he is a long
arm's length removed from a ``local'' ballot fight.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has repeatedly vowed to avoid ``negative'' campaigning. But
what's more negative than an effort to keep your main GOP opponent
off the ballot in one of the largest states?
</P>
<P>
   In hundreds of campaign speeches around the country, moreover,
the Texas governor has vowed to usher in the ``responsibility'' era
in the United States and set a high moral leadership tone in the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   He ends virtually every speech by raising his right hand and
promising to uphold the ``dignity'' of the nation's top office.
</P>
<P>
   But there is more to providing moral leadership and dignity in
the Oval Office than keeping the presidential hands off White House
interns, telling other young Americans to behave and vowing to lock
up criminals who fail the responsibility test.
</P>
<P>
   An aspiring moral leader also is someone who practices fair
play, who is not afraid to win _ or lose _ in a fair election and
doesn't pretend to look the other way while an opponent is being
victimized by unnecessarily restrictive rules.
</P>
<P>
   And he or she shouldn't be afraid to take a public stand on
divisive issues.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina's Confederate flag is being singled out partly
because of that state's early role in the presidential nominating
process. But remnants of the Confederacy _ symbols of racism to
some and history to others _ are prominent throughout the South.
</P>
<P>
   The Confederate battle flag is a dominant part of the Georgia
state flag, and a memorial to Confederate heroes is one of the
largest monuments on the grounds of the Texas Capitol in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   And McCain, who had ancestors who fought for the South during
the Civil War, has been as uncomfortable as Bush on the Confederate
flag issue.
</P>
<P>
   Historic monuments have their place. But flying the Confederate
banner atop a state's most important public building is going too
far. It's an affront _ intended or not _ to millions of Americans
whose Southern heritage was one of slavery.
</P>
<P>
   As indicated earlier, South Carolina has a right to keep the
flag atop its statehouse. But presidential candidates also have a
moral obligation to tell us what they think about it, because it's
an issue of much more than local importance.

FOCUS SHIFTS TO THE LEGACY OF CARDINAL JOHN O'CONNOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For New York's Catholics, the big news out of Rome
this week was that there was no news at all.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly everyone had assumed that Cardinal John O'Connor, the
city's, and possibly the country's, most controversial cardinal in
more than 30 years, would be leaving his post.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly he seemed to be giving a farewell address last
Saturday at a gala to celebrate his 80th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will soon be evicted,'' he joked to the hundreds of
religious and political luminaries who turned out at a midtown
ballroom in his honor.
</P>
<P>
   Yet by noon Tuesday, the time when popes traditionally announce
personnel changes, O'Connor still held the keys to St. Patrick's
Cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   With his declining health, O'Connor is clearly approaching his
final days as cardinal. That has prompted many observers, Roman
Catholic and otherwise, to reflect on the future of the New York
Archdiocese, especially in a city where Catholics now consist not
so much of Irish and Italians, as was the case in O'Connor's youth,
but of Latinos and Asians, who see themselves little-reflected in
the church's higher orders.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1984, when he was appointed to lead the archdiocese _ a
realm that includes 2.3 million Catholics in New York City, the
surrounding suburbs, and up through the Hudson Valley _ O'Connor
has cut an imposing, at times contradictory image.
</P>
<P>
   --He has vigorously condemned abortion and gay and lesbianism,
but has set up AIDS clinics and anonymously volunteered in them,
washing patients' hair and emptying bedpans.
</P>
<P>
   --He has riled liberals by linking himself with conservative
political causes, but he has marched with labor unions and
advocated an increase in the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   --He has pushed the church to acknowledge, and apologize for,
its history's darker episodes, yet he has engaged in deception over
some of his own political positions.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor has submitted his resignation in each of the last five
years, but the pope has turned it down. Recently, though, the
cardinal has been ailing. After surgery for a brain tumor, he was
too weak to attend several Sunday Masses and stumbled twice when he
did.
</P>
<P>
   A cardinal loses his voting rights in the Vatican councils upon
turning 80. Maybe this time, some were guessing, the pope would let
him go.
</P>
<P>
   Rome's silence this week means he will stay, but nobody knows
for how long.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
First, not lasting, impression
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor made it clear he would be a very public cardinal from
the moment he ascended to the post 16 years ago. Unlike nearly all
his predecessors, who spent many years in New York before assuming
the helm, O'Connor had been a bishop in Scranton, Pa., and before
that, vicar of the US armed forces. Perhaps because he was new, he
made bad impressions right off.
</P>
<P>
   First, he compared abortion to the Holocaust, an argument that
many Jews considered tasteless.
</P>
<P>
   Then, he lashed out at Geraldine Ferraro, the local Democratic
congresswoman who was running for vice president, for her advocacy
of abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Ferraro had provoked the attack, telling a
reporter that Catholic dogma was not monolithic on the question.
O'Connor fired back: ``Geraldine Ferraro has said some things about
abortion, relative to Catholic teaching, that are not true.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not he intended it, his remarks were widely
interpreted as an endorsement of Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   This impression was reinforced when he agreed to distribute a
voters' guide on local school-board elections prepared by the Rev.
Pat Robertson's Christian Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor, through his press spokesman, declined to be
interviewed for this story. But he admitted to The New York Times
in 1993 that he ``possibly'' made mistakes early on.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got off to a bad start,'' recalled Margaret O'Brien
Steinfels, editor of the lay Catholic magazine Commonweal. ``He was
a cultural conservative, and New York is the most culturally
liberal city in America. But then he made one of the most
spectacular comebacks imaginable.''
</P>
<P>
   The comeback was made largely through his budding friendship
with the Jewish mayor of New York, Edward I. Koch.
</P>
<P>
   In his midtown law office last week, Koch recalled of O'Connor,
``He told me his major role would be to strengthen ties between
Catholics and Jews. Time and time again, he'd say he was
spiritually a Semite, meaning a Jew. He'd mention in his sermons
that Mary and Jesus were Jews, most of the apostles were Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, he went to Jerusalem and, setting aside his prepared
speech, apologized for the Church's history of anti-Semitism. He
was the chief advocate in persuading the Vatican to recognize
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   He also turned around many of his liberal critics with his
support for labor, though this should not have been a surprise.
Growing up in a working-class neighborhood of Philadelphia, he saw
his father give fiery pro-union speeches.
</P>
<P>
   Nat Hentoff, the Village Voice columnist who wrote a positive
biography of the cardinal a few years ago, recalled their first
meeting. It was during a strike of Catholic hospital workers. ``I
was waiting outside his office,'' Hentoff said, ``and I heard him
yelling, `Over my dead body are there going to be scabs in my
hospital!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Hentoff contrasted him with Cardinal Francis Spellman, who ran
the archdiocese with an iron fist from 1937 to 1967. ``When the
gravediggers in a Catholic cemetery went on strike, Spellman
drafted seminarians to go dig graves,'' he said. ``Spellman himself
pushed the first shovel.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor's approach to his job has been very different _ partly
because the times are different, partly because he is.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `The Powerhouse' legacy
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Spellman's nickname was ``The Powerhouse.'' The city's
Democratic Party was run out of political clubhouses. The party's
ticket for the top offices _ mayor, comptroller, and City Council
chairman _ always included one Catholic and one Jew, and Spellman
picked the Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   Hentoff noted, ``Spellman could stop any legislation in the
State House that he didn't like.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Spellman died, in 1967, New York's Catholic
population had shifted and Democratic politics had changed. No
archbishop could have such power as he had, so his handpicked
successor, Cardinal Terence Cooke, took on a quieter, more pastoral
role, rarely speaking out in public, attending mainly to the
growing number of poor immigrants filling the pews.
</P>
<P>
   When Cooke died in 1983, and O'Connor got the call from Rome,
the atmosphere had changed again.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Macciarola, president of St. Francis College and a former
deputy mayor to Koch who had many dealings with the cardinal, said,
``With O'Connor, you got the sense that the pope had sent a
representative, at a time when he was demanding a higher level of
orthodoxy than before.''
</P>
<P>
   As a tone-setter, O'Connor started his reign by speaking out
strongly against abortion and gay and lesbianism in a city where
most Catholics were highly tolerant toward both.
</P>
<P>
   ``As time went on, as he grew more comfortable in his
position,'' Macciarola continued, ``you saw more reflection, a more
pastoral approach to his job.'' Hence his work with hospices, AIDS
clinics, and unions.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, O'Connor has become a more admired, even
trusted, figure. However, he has continued to draw criticism and
suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Key omissions
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, when President Clinton offered clemency to
long-jailed members of a Puerto Rican nationalist terrorist group,
he cited O'Connor among those who had influenced him on the issue.
O'Connor rebutted this and attacked Clinton for being soft on
crime.
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal released the text of a letter he had sent US
Attorney Janet Reno, asking her merely ``to review'' the prisoners'
cases, not to shorten their sentences.
</P>
<P>
   However, New York Daily News columnist Juan Gonzalez revealed _
reluctantly, because he likes the cardinal _ that O'Connor had
omitted ``two key words'' in reciting his letter to Reno: He had
asked Reno to review their cases ``for pardon.'' As Gonzalez noted,
a pardon, which would wipe a person's criminal slate clean, is even
more forgiving than Clinton's offer.
</P>
<P>
   A more serious question about O'Connor's legacy concerns
Hispanics in another sense. Every archbishop or cardinal in the
history of the New York Archdiocese, including O'Connor, has been
of Irish or Italian descent, yet Dominicans, Puerto Ricans,
Haitians, and Asians are nearly the majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a concern that the city's Catholic Church has not been
attentive to this new wave of immigrants,'' said Walter DelGrado,
head of the Audubon Partnership, a Dominican business group in
upper Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times poll last month indicated that while two-thirds
of all Catholics in the archdiocese have a favorable view of him,
fewer than half of its Hispanic Catholics do, mainly because they
pay little attention to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the influx of immigrants, the Catholic population in this
city is going to be growing again,'' said William Stein, a Catholic
historian who writes for City Journal. Whether the next cardinal
has much influence over them could depend on who _ or, perhaps
more, what _ he is. ``It would be interesting to see a cardinal
who's a power,'' Stein added, ``the way they used to be.''

WHY GOOD PEOPLE EAT BAD FOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Americans aren't stupid.
</P>
<P>
   They've known for years that the fast food they're eating
probably isn't good for them. Back in 1988, 60 percent of fast food
diners told Consumer Reports that they were ``worried'' about the
nutrient value of fast food, and only four percent felt the food
deserved top health marks.
</P>
<P>
   The worriers had reason to fret. Although McDonald's and other
fast food chains have added salads, grilled chicken, and other
healthful entrees in recent years, today's menus are still full of
foods that are bad for the heart, such as Burger King's Double
Whopper with cheese, which contains a whole day's fat allowance
under one wrapper.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't stop Americans from spending one in every seven
food dollars on fast food, as the lure of quick and inexpensive
meals outweighs their health concerns. In fact, more than three
quarters of fast food eaters believe they're getting good value for
their money, according to a recent survey by the National
Restaurant Assocation.
</P>
<P>
   Now, health researchers warn that many fast foods may be more
hazardous than previously believed because so many contain ``trans
unsaturated fatty acids'' or so-called transfats, a particularly
hazardous type of fat that doesn't appear on food labels. Many
fast-food french fries and other products are cooked in transfats,
used to harden the vegetable oils restaurants now use instead of
animal fat.
</P>
<P>
   Walter C. Willett, chairman of nutrition at the Harvard School
of Public Health, has called on the US Food and Drug Administration
to require transfat labelling on fast foods as part of the agency's
new transfat labelling regulations, arguing that consumers are
confused by ``deceptive labels such as `cholesterol-free' or
`cooked in vegetable oil.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But, even if the FDA agrees with Willett, few expect transfats
to spur a revolution among fast food diners. McDonald's officials
thought the anti-fat revolution was at hand once before, in the
early 1990s when they trotted out a hamburger with half the fat of
normal burgers. By 1997, with sales languishing, the McLean Deluxe
was cancelled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was launched with high hopes and seeming demand, but . . .
there wasn't really very much consumer interest in it,'' said
McDonald's spokesman Walt Riker.
</P>
<P>
   However, for those who want to eat healthfully, there are plenty
of choices at fast food restaurants, partly because chains know
that vegetarians or people on diets can veto the choice of
restaurant for an entire group of diners if there is nothing on the
menu that they want to eat.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the fast-growing Subway restaurant chain is going
directly after health-conscious diners with a national advertising
campaign that stresses the low-fat content of their sandwiches. The
menu features seven submarine sandwiches containing less than six
grams of fat; among hamburgers, only a vegetarian ``garden burger''
can beat that.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, there are plenty of guides to help consumers
navigate the world of fast food from books such as ``The Fast Food
Freeway Guide: A Map to Lower Fat and Calories at Fast Food
Restaurants,'' to Internet sites.
</P>
<P>
   With a few clicks on Cyberdiet.com's ``Fast Food Quest''
section, users can compare fat, salt, cholesterol, calories, and
other nutrition issues among hundreds of fast foods, comparing
individual restaurants directly or seeking out the healthiest foods
from all of them. The fast food chains often have nutritional
information on-line as well.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Americans' food choices are a contradictory matter
in which health and nutrition are just one concern. People consume
less fat and more fruit juice than they did 20 years ago, but at
the same time they consume far more soda and about 35 percent more
calories than the 2,000 recommended by the FDA. And so, they
continue to line up to place their orders for such menu items such
as the ``supersize'' Big Mac dinner _ all 1,410 calories of it.

THE GREENING OF MCDONALD'S 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   City councils banned its styrofoam burger boxes, calling them
``McToxics'' that pollute the environment. Martha's Vineyard and
other places banned the Golden Arches altogether, blaming
McDonald's for everything from litter to traffic congestion. And
there were dark rumors, never substantiated, that tropical rain
forest land was being cleared for its cattle to graze.
</P>
<P>
   To many Americans, McDonald's once symbolized consumer society
run amok. The company was probably no more wasteful than its
rivals, but, as the world's biggest fast food chain, it paid for
the sins of an industry where food was slapped in elaborate
wrappers that were thrown away by hungry customers minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   But, in one of the great Houdini acts of modern conservation,
McDonald's has gone from villain to role model in the past 10
years. Turning to professional environmentalists for advice,
McDonald's has reduced its waste by more than 30 percent since
1990, become one of the country's leading buyers of recycled
materials, and cut its energy use to boot.
</P>
<P>
   ``This company has been a leader on the environment, not only
for the industry, but also for corporate America as a whole,'' said
Fred Krupp, director of Environmental Defense, a nonprofit group
formerly known as the Environmental Defense Fund, which helped
McDonald's reduce waste. ``They've made a long series of
commitments and they've hit every target.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, environmental analysts are asking whether fast food could
be considered ``environmentally sound'' after all, a notion that is
anathema to many activists. Even if McDonald's and other chains
produced no waste at all, they would still face criticism about
their menus' heavy reliance on beef, one of the most
environmentally damaging foods to produce due to cattles' food
needs and waste.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's ``may have gotten rid of styrofoam cups, but they
haven't gotten rid of styrofoam buildings,'' joked Ronald Lee
Fleming of Cambridge, Mass.'s Townscape Institute, which works with
communities to pressure fast food chains to build restaurants that
blend in with the architecture of surrounding buildings.
</P>
<P>
   But Environmental Defense's ongoing work with McDonald's
reflects the reality that Americans flock to fast food whether or
not their dinner is healthy for the planet (or their arteries).
Burger King sales continued to rise even when activists called for
a boycott of the restaurant in 1988 over the company's alleged
purchase of beef raised on cleared Costa Rican rain forest land.
Indeed, fast food industry sales have risen from one quarter to one
half of all restaurant sales since 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Americans spend one-seventh of their food budget on Big
Macs and other fast food, making it the second most important
source of nutrition next to home cooking. And, with 12,500
McDonald's restaurants in the United States, most Americans live
within three miles of one.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, ironically, the sheer omnipresence of fast food could
actually prove to be an environmental advantage. When McDonald's
insisted on cardboard boxes made of recycled paper, the order was
so large that box companies adopted McDonald's standard as the one
for all of its customers, both in and outside the restaurant
business.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the efficiency of fast food restaurants make them less
wasteful than many conventional restaurants, according to Warren
Leon, author of the book ``The Consumer's Guide to Effective
Environmental Choices.'' If McDonald's succeeds in a plan it has to
turn food waste into fertilizer, eating at McDonald's could
generate less waste than eating at many homes.
</P>
<P>
   So Jackie Roberts, one of the Environmental Defense scientists
who has worked with McDonald's since 1990, continues to strive for
greener fast food rather than cursing its shortcomings. Nobody's
perfect, she said, and the point is to try to improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel like there is anything in my life that I can do
that is guilt-free. Even if I go for a hike . . . I drive a long
way to get there,'' said Roberts, who helps businesses reduce waste
at Environmental Defense's Alliance for Environmental Innovation in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The greening of McDonald's has been perceptible only to the most
observant customers. The change most people noticed was the 1990
disappearance of the controversial polystyrene ``clamshell'' box
that once held the Big Mac _ since replaced by a special
lightweight paper _ but there has been a steady parade of changes
in the dining area since then as well. For example:
</P>
<P>
   --Napkins are 1 inch shorter, cutting down on needed paper by 21
percent, and they are now made from recycled newspapers, giving
them a slightly off-white color. Most food is wrapped in paper now,
too, instead of plastic or cardboard, cutting down on materials
needed to make wrappers by 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   --The company has cut back on plastic use as well, making the
straws shorter, the dining trays lighter, and the garbage bags
thinner. Much of the playground equipment is now made of recycled
plastic as well, part of a corporation-wide $3 billion purchase of
recycled materials since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   --McDonald's periodically uses the liners of its food trays to
tell customers about its environmental progress, such as its
commitment to protecting tropical rain forests through financial
support of the group Conservation International.
</P>
<P>
   In general, however, McDonald's has avoided asking for any
sacrifices from consumers, largely because it hasn't worked in the
past. When the company introduced bins for recyclable materials,
they found the paper was too contaminated with grease to recycle,
or a bagful of otherwise perfectly recyclable polystyrene boxes had
Coke spilled on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a struggle to recycle in our stores,'' admitted Robert
Langert, McDonald's director of environmental affairs. ``Even if
you've got 99 percent of the people doing a good job, you've still
got a problem with that one percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, scientists from Environmental Defense discovered
early on that the real opportunities were behind the food counter _
in reducing the cardboard boxes, egg shells, coffee grounds, and
other materials that, collectively, account for 80 percent of
McDonald's waste.
</P>
<P>
   Working for a day in a Falls Church, Virginia, McDonald's,
Roberts of Environmental Defense realized that the path to
improvement lay in making waste reduction part of the highly
regimented system that allows McDonald's to feed 40 million people
a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, the choreography was just amazing,'' she recalled.
``And I was thinking, `anything we do has to fit into this system.'
''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, waste reduction and recycling fit beautifully
into the McDonald's system, in part because it saved money.
Recycling cardboard immediately cut restaurants' waste disposal
bills by 30 percent, while the company saves $5 million a year by
requiring lighter and smaller packaging and supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond money, the unusual partnership between McDonald's and
Environmental Defense worked because the two sides trusted each
other. McDonald's officials knew they needed outside help to
restore their battered image, while Environmental Defense braved
criticism from fellow environmentalists for a chance to work inside
a corporate nemesis.
</P>
<P>
   Today, other companies are following McDonald's lead on
environmental issues. Burger King, the number two hamburger chain,
copied McDonald's switch to paper hamburger wrappers in 1991, while
Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, and Kentucky Fried Chicken recently shrunk
their napkins as McDonald's did earlier.
</P>
<P>
   However, McDonald's has done far less on more complex
environmental issues. Their burger-dominated menu, for instance,
would require a change in their business strategy and the
cooperation of millions of customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the bigger, more harmful impacts associated with food
aren't from the packaging of food, but from the production of food
itself,'' said John C. Ryan, author of the book ``Stuff: The Secret
Life of Everyday Things,'' which examines the environmental impact
of consumer goods.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan estimates that a quarter-pound hamburger requires 616
gallons of water to produce, from the water for corn and other
crops fed to the cattle, to the water pollution caused by the
animals' feces. Analyst Leon calculates that the production of beef
does 15 times more damage per serving than poultry because cattle
grazing tends to denude and erode the land.

   ``Almost any kind of farm-raised meat is an inefficient use of
resources, but red meat is most wasteful of all,'' said Ryan.
``Have a veggie burrito next time.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's officials say that if customers wanted veggie
burritos, they would gladly serve them, but most people don't want
them. McDonald's already offers chicken, fish, salads, muffins, and
other non-beef alternatives, but ``the hamburger continues to be
the flagship sandwich,'' said McDonald's spokesman Walt Riker. ``We
have to be responsive to our customers.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's also faces criticism for its role in ``sprawl,''
those unattractive commercial strips on the outskirts of towns that
critics say drain business from existing downtowns, encourage
people to drive more, and eat up open space. In part because of
McDonald's reputation for shrewd real estate choices, its
restaurants can trigger new sprawl as other retailers try to locate
near the new McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's kind of a huge blindspot with many of the largest
corporations,'' said Constance Beaumont of the National Trust for
Historic Preservation in Washington D.C. ``They don't really look
at the big picture, for example, the `auto-centricity' of their
operations . . . in the middle of nowhere accessible only by car.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, McDonald's doesn't have an anti-sprawl policy, but it
does respond to community demands, such as building a restaurant in
an existing Victorian house in downtown Freeport, Maine, and
building an earth-tone and teal restaurant to blend in with the
mountains in Sedona, Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't do anything without official approval,'' said
spokesman Riker, pointing out that it's up to communities to decide
what the ground rules are for commercial development.
</P>
<P>
   More generally, some public officials argue that McDonald's
actually helps preserve urban areas by providing entry-level jobs
that keep some people from moving away. Chicago Mayor Richard Daley
even held a ``Golden Arches'' day last year, declaring that the 115
McDonald's in the city have ``been a great partner in revitalizing
Chicago's neighborhoods.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, environmental analysts are humbler today about passing
judgment on McDonald's than activists were when the company was
under attack a decade ago. Looking back, they believe that some
issues, such as the industry's links to cattle raised on cleared
rain forest, were overblown, and that assessing the true
environmental impact of any industry, especially one as complex as
fast food, is nearly impossible.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, neither authors Leon and Ryan nor even
Environmental Defense's Roberts could finally answer the question
as to whether an environmentalist can eat at McDonald's with a
clear conscience.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear, however, is that McDonald's is moving ahead with
more plans to reduce its restaurants' environmental impact,
starting an experiment in California to compost food waste into
fertilizer and, by April, announcing timetables for a 10 percent
cut in energy use across the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to do the right thing,'' said McDonald's Langert.

WHO SAYS BANNING GAY MARRIAGE IS IMMORAL? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In its long opinion in Baker v. State, the same-sex marriage
case, the Vermont Supreme Court tries very hard to stay on legal
ground. Writing for the majority, Chief Justice Jeffrey Amestoy
begins by insisting that ``the issue before the Court . . . does
not turn on the religious or moral debate over intimate same-sex
relationships.'' And for most of the next 45 pages, he confines his
analysis to familiar legal territory: the rules of constitutional
interpretation, the intentions of the Legislature, issues of equal
protection, rights and remedies.
</P>
<P>
   Yet by Page 44, he has arrived exactly where he said he wasn't
going. The ``essential aspect'' of the plaintiffs' demand for a
marriage license is, he writes, ``fundamentally for inclusion in
the family of state-sanctioned human relations.'' In the end, he
holds that same-sex couples are entitled to the benefits and status
of marriage as a matter of basic decency. Or, as a much-quoted line
in the opinion puts it: Stretching the Vermont Constitution so it
gives gay couples ``legal protection and security for their avowed
commitment to an intimate and lasting human relationship is simply,
when all is said and done, a recognition of our common humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those quoting that passage is The New Republic, which in
its Jan. 10 edition vigorously endorses the opinion in Baker _ with
none of the court's reluctance to cast the issue in explicitly
moral terms. ``A ban on same-sex marriage . . . violates civil
equality itself,'' TNR's full-page editorial asserts. It is ``a
moral anomaly that dehumanizes and excludes a significant portion
of the human race.'' The ``ultimate moral . . . answer'' is to
legalize full marriage for homosexuals, so good people must ``keep
marshaling the moral, religious, civic, and human reasons why it is
an eminently important and noble thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the heart of the campaign for same-sex marriage _ the
claim that it is (itals)immoral(unitals) not to permit men to marry
men or women to marry women. Marriage statutes must be changed, the
same-sex marriage advocates argue, because they are indecent,
because they violate our ethical code. As slavery was wrong _ the
Vermont court actually cites Dred Scott _ so is it wrong to limit
marriage to couples of the opposite sex.
</P>
<P>
   Just one question: Says who?
</P>
<P>
   If something is morally wrong, it is morally wrong always. That
a society may tolerate _ or embrace _ an indecent practice does not
make it less indecent. Chattel slavery was and is an abomination,
no matter how many 19th-century Americans (or 20th-century
Sudanese) thought otherwise. Suttee _ the Hindu custom of cremating
a deceased man together with his living widow _ was evil, no matter
how many Hindus believed it honorable. Apartheid was immoral, no
matter how many South Africans approved of it.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, if barring men from marrying men is an affront to
``our common humanity,'' as the Vermont justices write _ if it is
an ugly ``moral anomaly,'' as The New Republic says _ than it has
(itals)always(unitals) been so.
</P>
<P>
   But where in the long record of human moral instruction do we
find anyone saying such a thing?
</P>
<P>
   All through the centuries of American slavery, there were men
and women who cried out against it. There were always voices raised
against suttee. Apartheid was condemned the world over.
</P>
<P>
   And likewise every other wrongful societal practice. Europeans
abused Indians in the New World? Bartolome de Las Casas, who sailed
with Columbus, spent his last 50 years denouncing ``the robbery,
evil, and injustice'' done by European colonists. Women were denied
political rights? In 1777, Abigail Adams begged, ``Do not put such
unlimited power into the hands of husbands.'' From child sacrifice
to anti-Semitism, from selling indulgences to selling women, there
have always been moral teachers and people of conscience who
refused to keep silent.
</P>
<P>
   But where are the humanitarians and the great souls who said
that limiting marriage to a man and a woman is wrong? Did Francis
of Assisi plead for same-sex unions? Did the Buddha? Did Sojourner
Truth? Did the Prophet Micah, who yearned for justice and kindness,
yearn also for male-male and female-female weddings? Did Martin
Luther King, who devoted his life to ``our common humanity?'' Did
Raoul Wallenberg, who risked all to thwart evil? Is there
(itals)anyone(unitals) _ any foe of intolerance, any living saint _
who decried even once the laws that kept homosexuals from marrying
each other?
</P>
<P>
   This is not an argument against same-sex marriage. (That's a
different column). It is an argument against the pretense that
same-sex marriage is required as a matter of decency. There is no
valid moral claim absent moral authority, and there is no moral
authority for the claim that restricting marriage to opposite-sex
couples is unjust.
</P>
<P>
   It is a safe guess that no member of the Vermont Supreme Court
grew up believing that the ban on same-sex marriage was a stain on
society. None heard it from his pastor in church. None was taught
to believe it in school. Until very recently, that idea simply did
not exist.
</P>
<P>
   By all means let us debate whether the timeless definition of
marriage should be changed. But let us do so without the sham claim
that (itals)morality(unitals) clamors for a change. Our moral
tradition, after all, speaks loudly and clearly about what marriage
means. And what it says _ what it has always said _ sounds nothing
like the ruling in Vermont.

TAKING EACH OTHER, FOR BETTER OR VERSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOANNA WEISS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The groom was a physician, a dignified type, and at his wedding
he insisted on reading poetry to his bride. Already that made Rabbi
Bob Alper nervous. There's no accounting for taste.
</P>
<P>
   And when the groom started into his selection, from a rock song,
Alper felt his fears confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, baby, be mine,'' the doctor started, deadly serious. ``Oh,
baby, be mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, many clerics say they've seen it before: wedding readings
that are somewhat out of touch with the occasion. There are rock
songs that sound great, but there are rock songs that sound a
little over the top. Just like the personalized vows that Alper, a
Vermont spiritual leader-turned-stand-up comic, says are ``so
overboard, you think, `This isn't going to last.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Poetry has troubles of its own _ too many bland passages that
sound like greeting cards, too many pretty lines that are really
about divorce or promiscuity or death. And the Bible is full of
readings that sound beautiful if you don't know the context. A few
lines past your short selection, you're likely to come across a
verse about vengefulness, or punishment, or how wives should submit
to their husbands.
</P>
<P>
   But if the prospective bride and groom included no readings,
they figure, the guests would be aghast. Whether it's
sentimentality, peer pressure, or romance, a wedding seems to
scream out for verse, something that sums up your unique
relationship in 15 pithy lines and leaves the guests dabbing tears
from their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel compelled to have this very special passage . . .
because that's what everyone else has done,'' said Dan Zevin, the
author of ``The Nearly-Wed Handbook: How to Survive the Happiest
Day of Your Life'' (Avon Books). ``There comes a point where you
realize `We don't have a special passage.' ''
</P>
<P>
   So the hunt begins. When Zevin planned his wedding, he and his
wife spent hours in the library, scouring the shelves and filling
the pages of poetry books with Post-It notes.
</P>
<P>
   Every week, a stream of brides, grooms, and bridesmaids strides
into Grolier Poetry Book Shop in Cambride, Mass. seeking ``a poem
for a wedding,'' owner Louisa Solano said. They might not might
know Keats from ``The Cat in the Hat,'' but they figure it won't be
a difficult hunt.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, it's not so easy to find a poem that fits _
suitably sentimental without being corny, suitably deep without
being dark. And suitably original, so your guests won't feel deja
vu. One summer, Zevin says, he heard the same reading at three
weddings in a row, a passage by proto-new-age philosopher Kahlil
Gibran. ``Love one another, but do not make a bond of love,'' it
warned. ``Let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your
souls. . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   In the wedding-selection anthologies that line the library
shelves, Zevin found scores of ``generic warm and fuzzy passages''
with similar themes. They're plastered all over the Internet, too,
and available from your neighborhood rabbi or minister. Among the
greatest hits: an Apache wedding song (``Now you will feel no cold
/ For each of you will be warmth to the other''), an ungrammatical
poem called ``Love Is'' (``Love is being happy for the other person
when they are happy / Being sad for the person when they are
sad''), and a fairly self-centered offering called ``Love'' (``I
love you / Not only for what you are / But for what I am / When I
am with you. . . . '').
</P>
<P>
   Zevin blended them into what he calls ``All-Purpose Wedding
Reading.'' He included it in his book and read it aloud at a
friend's ceremony:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We're together, we're independent &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We're the same, we're not the same &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We're one, we're two &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Love, love, love &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Blah, blah, blah &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Amen. &QL; 
 &QL; 
(end poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If that thought leaves something to be desired, perhaps it
should, says US poet laureate Robert Pinsky, who teaches at Boston
University. ``Good poems,'' he says, ``are meant to be specific
rather than generic, urgent rather than reassuring, memorable
rather than genial, sharp rather than bland.'' In other words, they
aren't supposed to be uplifting. Which leads to another problem:
The deeper you dig into the poetry books, searching for tales of
undying love, the more likely you are to grow profoundly depressed.
</P>
<P>
   For one, you won't find much about undying love at all. Happy
marriage, it turns out, is far down on the list of common poetry
themes _ well below aging, dying, death, and the people you leave
behind when you die. Leaf through Norton's Anthology of Poetry, and
you'll find these titles: ``Dead Boy,'' ``The Dead Butterfly,''
``Death of the Day,'' ``The Death of the Hired Man,'' ``The Death
of a Toad.''
</P>
<P>
   And even the poems about love and marriage tend to be things you
wouldn't want at your wedding ceremony. There is Robert Creeley's
``Ballad of the Despairing Husband'':
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   My wife and I lived all alone,
</P>
<P>
   contention was our only bone.
</P>
<P>
   I fought with her, she fought with me,
</P>
<P>
   and things went on right merrily.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Bryant Voigt's ``For My Husband,'' is about an aging
couple working a Ouija board together. They get to ``L'' and ``O''
just fine, but then the Ouija ``veers toward loss and the long
past.'' A Robert Frost poem starts, ``Love at the lips was touch /
As sweet as I could bear . . . '' but goes on into pain and
weariness; its title is ``Earthward.'' Adrienne Rich wrote a dark
love poem called ``Living in Sin.''
</P>
<P>
   Even poems that seem wedding-appropriate can be trouble, if you
take the time to understand them. Pinsky acknowledges that
Shakespeare's oft-used sonnet that begins ``Let me not to the
marriage of true minds admit impediments,'' contains ``a lot of
strange stuff'' that doesn't exactly celebrate marriage.
</P>
<P>
   And some readings are nice in sentiment, but still don't fit the
couple, said one local priest, who didn't want to use his name. He
recalls the day he wed ``a little bit of a thing'' to a groom built
like a linebacker _ well over 6 feet tall and about 300 pounds. The
reading selection was from the ``Song of Solomon.'' ``Look, he
comes, leaping over the mountains, bounding over the hills,'' it
said. ``My beloved is like a gazelle.''
</P>
<P>
   Other religious passages sound nice in a vacuum, but wouldn't
work so well if you knew the whole story. Many brides love the
sweet lines about marriage in the Book of Tobit. They don't know
that the book is about a woman who married seven men, all of whom
dropped dead on their wedding night.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, when you examine every word of some poems, you're bound
to find some problems. Anything by Walt Whitman runs the risk of
sounding a bit, well, easy _ unless you commit the cardinal sin of
changing the author's words. ``Miracles,'' from ``Leaves of
Grass,'' shows up in one wedding poem anthology after a little
careful surgery. An editor has discreetly removed the word ``any''
from Whitman's original line, ``Or sleep in the bed at night with
any one I love.''
</P>
<P>
   In such cases, it could be that ignorance is bliss. Solano says
some of her favorite poems about marriage are by poets who,
themselves, are well beyond spouse No. 1. One Katherine Soniat poem
that could work in a wedding, Solano said, is in a volume
``primarily about her getting a divorce'' and finding someone new.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people don't realize that there's a context to most of
these poems,'' Solano says. ``Which is OK, unless someone in the
audience happens to know about it and starts laughing
hysterically.''
</P>
<P>
   Which almost happened at another wedding author Zevin attended.
The couple ``thought they were being really groovy'' by getting
someone to sing an opera selection in Italian, he said. But one
savvy guest knew the language, and shared that the song was about
splitting up.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to blame the couple; when the search for great poetry
gets overwhelming, it's awfully tempting to cheat. A Romance
language song would sound soft and sentimental, even if it were
about fleas. Fortunately, Zevin and his wife didn't have to resort
to such measures. After a vigorous probe, they found a poem in
English.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really incredibly meaningful at the time,'' he says,
``and right now, I have a hard time remembering what it was.''
</P>
<P>
   But Zevin says he came away from his big event with a lesson
more important than any poem can offer: No one listens to the
wedding readings, anyway. ``A, they can't hear it, or B, they're
just looking at what you're wearing,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   That won't stop most brides and grooms, lost deep in wedding
tunnel vision. So console yourselves, at least, with the thought
that as you search, you might be getting a serious Bible lesson, or
reading all of the poetry you ignored in high school and college,
and discovering that some of it is actually quite good. You might
find a poem that doesn't suit a wedding, but clearly bears hanging
on the refrigerator door. You'll be making the poet laureate proud:
``I like imagining them looking around, hunting through
anthologies,'' Pinsky says.
</P>
<P>
   And if your search for meaningful verse still leaves you empty,
it might help to forget about being deep. Try practical, instead,
as in Ogden Nash's ``Advice to Husbands:''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
To keep your marriage brimming &QL; 
With love in the loving cup, &QL; 
Whenever you're wrong, admit it; &QL; 
Whenever you're right, shut up. &QL; 
 &QL;

   COKE-JAPAN (Walnut Creek, Calif.) _ For years, Japanese
consumers have had two Coca-Colas to choose from _ identical except
for their packaging, but at vastly different prices. There is the
locally bottled brand, labeled Coca-Cola, and ``American Coke,''
labeled Coca-Cola Classic _ bottled in America and shipped abroad.
Despite the thousands of miles American Coke has to travel, it is
usually cheaper than Japanese-made Coke. That price gap is at the
heart of a complex legal confrontation between Coca-Cola and two
small California exporter now nearing trial in a federal courtroom
in San Francisco. The stakes are high. Coke makes more money per

HEART DOESN'T SKIP A BEAT IN SURGERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KAREN HSU  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a recent morning, Dr. Robert Lancey of UMass Memorial Health
Care in Worcester, Mass. was ready to perform a quadruple bypass
operation on 75-year-old Olga Andujar. As he opened up her chest,
his assistants extracted a vein from her leg, which was about to be
used to reroute blood past a blockage in a diseased vessel.
</P>
<P>
   But the operation then deviated dramatically from the norm.
Lancey did not hook up Andujar to a piano-sized heart-lung machine,
which temporarily stops the heart, often for an hour or more as it
oxygenates and pumps blood through the body. Instead, Lancey sewed
the vein to a beating heart, a feat he could not accomplish were it
not for a one-inch square plastic device.
</P>
<P>
   The device compresses the blocked vessel so it doesn't bleed,
and stablizes the surrounding area so the surgeon can graft the
healthy vessel to the blocked one. All the while, the heart thumps
normally.
</P>
<P>
   The technique, called ``off-pump'' or ``beating-heart'' surgery,
is one of several minimally-invasive methods now being used to
minimize the trauma and side effects of bypass surgery.
</P>
<P>
   After a bypass operation, a third to half of patients suffer
from cognitive problems ranging from short-term confusion and
memory loss to major strokes. Some studies have suggested that
these problems stem not from the surgery itself, but from stopping
the heart using the heart-lung machine.
</P>
<P>
   As blood is pumped outside the body and recirculated by the
machine, inflammatory changes occur in the body's tissue linings,
which can lead to dangerous fluid buildup. And as the machine
artificially oxygenates the blood, bubbles and debris enter the
circulation, which activate platelets that can form clots, blocking
small blood vessels, which can potentially trigger a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians say beating-heart surgery is best for older and
sicker patients, who may suffer the most serious side effects from
being on a heart-lung machine.
</P>
<P>
   The technique, which Lancey started doing 18 months ago and now
uses in 90 percent of the bypass operations he performs, is one of
the latest advances in heart bypass surgery. But, ironically, it's
also a throwback to the days before the invention of the heart-lung
machine: operating on a beating heart.
</P>
<P>
   It's estimated that of the approximately 360,000 coronary bypass
operations performed annually in the US, beating-heart devices are
used in about 18 percent of all cases. But since the technique has
only been widely used within the past three years, there have been
only a few studies, most of them small, that have compared the
outcomes of beating-heart surgery to those of conventional bypass
operations.
</P>
<P>
   The data so far indicate that patients that have the procedure
have shorter hospital stays and recovery periods.
</P>
<P>
   However, Lancey said the procedure is difficult to master.
``It's a mindset change. Surgeons are used to working on a heart
that doesn't move,'' he said. Because the heart pulses in all
different directions, it makes the operation particularly tricky,
Lancey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much more difficult; probably my blood pressure goes
higher when I do it,'' said Dr. Sari Aranki, a cardiac surgeon at
Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. Of the 800 patients at the
Brigham who undergo bypass surgery, the off-pump technique is
reserved for the 50 to 80 sickest or oldest ones, he said.
</P>
<P>
   One heart surgeon at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in
Boston, Dr. William Cohn, invented one of the several surgical
tools for the beating-heart technique using $5.99 Stop and Shop
soup spoons as a model.
</P>
<P>
   Cohn and Beth Israel patented the product, and Genzyme Corp., a
Cambridge, Mass. biotechnology company, bought the right to license
the technology and started selling it in 1998. Other companies,
including Cardiothoracic Systems, Inc., in California and Medtronic
Inc., in Minnesota, also have cardiac stabilizers on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Before the heart-lung machine was invented in 1953, some
surgeons tried to accurately stitch vessels onto a moving heart,
but most considered it too dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   In bypass surgery, a segment of a vein from the leg and part of
a chest artery are sewn onto a coronary artery above its blocked
portion, and then to the normal part of the artery below the
obstruction. Blood then ``bypasses'' the blocked part, like a road
detour around a construction site.
</P>
<P>
   While a few daring surgeons worldwide, in South America and
Europe, have tried techniques that kept the heart beating during
surgery, it wasn't until the early 1990s that American physicians
became interested in the technique.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1990s, an earlier version of the off-pump surgery was
nicknamed ``keyhole surgery,'' because a small incision was made on
the front of the chest and a surgical tool was used to stablize the
area of the heart where the surgeon sewed the vessel.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, a lot of people jumped on the
``minimally-invasive'' bandwagon, said Beth Israel's Cohn, even
though early results were not very good, and it limited surgeons to
working on a single coronary artery. ``But it exposed us to
techniques on a beating heart, and we all realized that it was a
technologically possible hurdle,'' said Cohn.
</P>
<P>
   Cohn, who has a metal shop in his basement, was intrigued with
the idea, and went to Johns Hopkins in 1996 to watch a couple of
the keyhole operations in which doctors used a device that looked
like a bent tuning fork, but he thought the surgery looked too
technically demanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought there must be a better way,'' Cohn said. So, he
bought a bunch of soup spoons, stayed up until 2 a.m. in his metal
shop cutting different holes in them, and started doing surgery on
pigs with his hand-made stabilizer.
</P>
<P>
   Genzyme, like other companies, has hosted workshops for heart
surgeons to learn to use the device.
</P>
<P>
   But long-term studies still need to be done. For example, it is
unclear how long the grafts sewn on a beating heart will hold up.
``A lot of people are saying beating heart surgery will be the rule
rather than the exception. But I'm still waiting for the data,''
Cohn said.

RESPONSIBLE FUNDS SHOW GOOD RETURNS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By SHANNON BUGGS 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Did you boycott Texaco when you heard about the tapes?
Did you start riding your bike when Houston's air became the
filthiest in the nation?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you don't take things quite that far, but you did stop
smoking after a loved one died of lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Or did you feel better about buying Barbie dolls because
Mattel's top executive is a woman? Or cancel HBO because of the
cable channel's late-night adult programming?
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, we all use our ethics and values to guide
financial decisions. We spend money with companies that validate
our beliefs and avoid those that don't.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses know this and they spend billions of dollars to
market themselves as diverse, charitable, family-friendly,
environmentally conscious or any other trait that their target
consumers esteem.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly 30 years, small money-management firms have dug
beneath companies' public personas to see if they really are good
corporate citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The mutual funds they run screen stocks for environmental
responsibility, consumer protection, fair employment policies and
health-conscious products, as well as financial performance and
earnings potential.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
MARKET TAKES CONCEPT SERIOUSLY &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Only recently has socially responsible investing been taken
seriously by Wall Street, which had dismissed the concept as losing
money to do good.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, however, that has been far from the truth.
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey by the Social Investment Forum, a trade group,
found that $2.16 trillion _ or one of every $8 invested in the
United States _ is invested using socially responsible guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Domini Social Equity, an index fund that tracks a socially
screened index of 400 stocks, has three- and five-year returns that
beat the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these funds do well because they tend to invest in
nonpolluting industries, such as technology and health care. And
value stocks that they avoid, such as tobacco manufacturers, have
fallen out of favor in the past few quarters of this bull market.
</P>
<P>
   Morningstar, a mutual fund tracking company based in Chicago,
awarded 14 percent of the 80 socially responsible funds it follows
its highest rating of five stars, compared with just 10 percent of
all mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   Vanguard, the nation's second-largest fund group, announced
plans last month to start a new index fund tied to a group of
stocks screened for their companies' social and environmental
policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Socially responsible investing now has an air of
respectability, for lack of a better word, that it didn't have 10
years ago,'' says Emily Hall, a Morningstar editorial analyst.
</P>
<P>
   For a long time, this method of stock and fund picking has been
associated with the polar opposite groups that espouse it. Some
investors have been turned off by liberal agendas condemning guns
and animal testing or conservative Christian vitriol against
abortion and gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   And the ``holier than thou'' moniker doesn't help.
</P>
<P>
   But socially responsible funds are starting to make it clear
that they are not a part of a monolithic movement.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
PROUD OF WHAT THEY OWN &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has a different idea of what is good and what isn't
and we're starting to see more funds clearly define themselves on
the socially responsible spectrum,'' says John Montgomery, manager
of the five-star Bridgeway Social Responsibility, a large-company
growth fund based in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the Humane Society of the United States announced
last week it has teamed up with Salomon Brothers Asset Management
to launch a no-load portfolio for people concerned with animal
welfare issues.
</P>
<P>
   Niche funds that target a specific issue will make socially
responsible investing more relevant to a wider range of investors.
By being able to target values and skip over an array of issues
that are not a concern, investors will be more likely to put their
money where their beliefs are.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to get started in socially responsible investing is
through mutual funds. First, you need to know what you value and
what you disdain.
</P>
<P>
   Then, you have to decide if you want to reward companies for
having certain products or policies by making an investment, or do
you want to punish them by screening them out of your portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   The strength of your convictions will also help you determine if
you want to become a shareholder activist and push a company to
adopt or change its practices.
</P>
<P>
   Next, you need to decide if your ethical commitment includes a
willingness to pay more for your beliefs. On average, these funds
are smaller and charge more than the average fund.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgeway Social Responsibility is an exception. It's an
actively managed fund with a total expense ratio of 1.5 percent and
a pledge to donate a portion of its profits to charity every year.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever you decide, examine funds and their investing
philosophies. Visit their Web sites and research them through at
www.morningstar.com, www.domini.com, www.socialinvest.org or
www.crosswalk.com.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, decide if the fund is a good investment. The rules of
responsible investing still apply. Whatever fund you choose, it
needs to be a good fit with your overall portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, socially responsible investors are shareholders who
take seriously their duties as part owners. They don't ignore their
consciences to concentrate on making as much money as possible
because they want to be proud of what they own.
</P>
<P>
   By having their undivided attention, Corporate America will be
better off.

FEMALE MANAGERS BETTER, STUDY SHOWS

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The old conventional wisdom is women aren't good
managers. They aren't tough enough. They don't play team sports, so
they have no idea how to work together in a common effort. Women
have a particularly hard time managing women, since one woman
doesn't like to work for another.
</P>
<P>
   There's a new conventional wisdom emerging. In a new kind of
workplace where employees are expected to use their brains as well
as their brawn, women make better managers. They relate better.
They coax better performance, instead of demanding it. They are
better able to motivate, not simply give orders.
</P>
<P>
   I suspect the truth is, men and women can be equally capable.
</P>
<P>
   However, there is evidence that in some specific kinds of
situations, women do make superior managers. The evidence isn't
conclusive. But it does bear thinking about.
</P>
<P>
   That's the conclusion of a study by three academics _ Nigel F.
Pierce and Nikala Lane of Cardiff University in Great Britain and
David W. Cravens of Texas Christian University in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SALES WAS THE ARENA EXAMINED &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The three studied the effectiveness of female sales managers at
an unnamed large British commercial directory publisher that
employs about 1,000 sales people. The trio interviewed both sales
people and their managers at a sample of its 102 sales offices.
</P>
<P>
   They chose the company because it used behavior, rather than
outcome-based, sales management. In outcome-based organizations,
sales people are not given specific direction by managers and are
primarily paid commissions. Behavior-based companies look not just
at sales but at establishing closer relationships with their
customers. They rely heavily on salaries for salespeople and
closely supervise them.
</P>
<P>
   The study compared results between teams headed by male and
female sales managers in a number of different areas. Here's what
they found:
</P>
<P>
   _ Female sales managers were much more likely to try to control
the behavior of their team. That was reported by both male and
female sales personnel.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sales teams led by female managers displayed higher job
involvement and lower job ambiguity _ a stressful situation in
which a person lacks clear direction about the organization's
expectations. They also felt less conflict about their roles in the
company, less job anxiety and displayed lower burnout rates.
</P>
<P>
   _ Female-led sales teams reported significantly higher levels of
job satisfaction and commitment to the company, and employees were
less likely to quit.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
FEMALE-LED TEAMS EXCELLED &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Sales teams led by females had higher levels of effectiveness.
There were substantial differences in work outcomes and sales unit
effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   _ Female sales people are likely to be more effective when
working for a female than a male sales manager. However, both male
and female sales people reported higher job satisfaction and
commitment to the organization when working for female, rather than
male, bosses. Surprisingly, male salespeople were less likely than
females to quit when they worked for a female, rather than a male,
sales manager.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this study has its limits when attempting to apply
its lessons everywhere. It's one company in another country.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the question of bias. The authors of the study
found none, but that doesn't mean it didn't exist.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the company might have been _ consciously or
unconsciously _ favoring female sales managers. Top managers might
have given female sales managers better people or better
territories, which could produce the finding of apparently superior
performance by female sales managers.
</P>
<P>
   Or conversely, the bias might have worked the other way. Only
the very best females got promoted to manager positions. If that
were the case, women should do a better job than male managers.
After all, males with much lower intrinsic skills would be promoted
to supervisory jobs, since they did not face the same high barrier
to promotion.
</P>
<P>
   However, if the findings are correct and universal, they lead to
some interesting thoughts. It used to be gospel that the macho
world of sales was one where women did not fit. But the rise of a
different kind of sales climate, where buyers and sellers are more
partner than adversary, could mean that macho is out and that the
traditionally female skill of nurturing is in.

THE TRUE LIFE OF `MR. DEATH' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Fred A. Leuchter Jr. is an unremarkable
looking man. Thinning hair, thick glasses, overeager. Under
ordinary circumstances, you'd never give him a second glance. But
none of the circumstances attached to the life of Fred A. Leuchter
Jr. are ordinary. Leuchter is the subject of Errol Morris's new
film, ``Mr. Death,'' and if you think that title may perhaps be a
little tabloid-y, consider the life and works of the man. Until the
early 1990s, he made a nice living as a self-taught execution
specialist, designing, maintaining, and repairing electric chairs,
gas chambers, lethal injection systems, and gallows. As capital
punishment was stepped up, Leuchter's death-chamber business grew.
</P>
<P>
   Leuchter saw himself as a modern Dr. Guillotine, offering a
quick, clean death instead of a messy one. Then he tripped over his
own hubris. In 1988, a neo-Nazi being brought to trial for
violating Canada's anti-hate law by denying that the Holocaust
happened called on Leuchter to bolster his defense. For a fee,
Leuchter went to Auschwitz, measuring what was left of the gas
chambers, looking for traces of cyanide gas in the bits of wall he
illegally chipped out and took away in plastic bags. Leuchter,
newly married, took his wife on the only documented honeymoon in
Auschwitz. Leuchter concluded that the Holocaust couldn't have
happened. His report was never allowed in court. But it received
wide circulation. Leuchter became a neo-Nazi poster boy.
</P>
<P>
   Leuchter also ruined himself. States where he had death-chamber
maintenance contracts let the contracts lapse. He was too much of a
hot potato. But not, however, for Morris, who tracked Leuchter down
by calling upon his skills as a private investigator, a job he
worked at before the filmmaking began and which provided key
elements in ``Vernon, Florida'' and Morris's breakthrough film,
``The Thin Blue Line.'' In
</P>
<P>
   1992, Morris persuaded Leuchter to be interviewed, one reason
being Morris's wish to test his new interviewing device, which he
calls the Interrotron and allows eye contact between subject and
interviewer. Leuchter talked willingly for hours, Morris says. On
and off, over the next several years, as this or that bit of
funding became available, Morris assembled the film piecemeal,
adding as well various experts and bits of documentary footage.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I shot that initial interview in 1992, I went down to
Tennessee with Fred and shot those scenes with Fred in the death
chamber at this new Tennessee prison outside Nashville. Fred was
already persona non grata by then. The warden did not want to be
photographed with Fred. And to ensure that no one who worked at the
prison would be seen with Fred, they locked us inside the death
chamber with Fred the entire day. We were able to send out for
pizza and sandwiches.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just one of those 20th-century lessons _ don't get in bed
with Nazis. Fred never learned it,'' Morris says, in the living
room of the Cambridge house he shares with his wife, art historian
Julia Sheehan, and their son, Hamilton. ``In my first film, `Gates
of Heaven,' there's a character, Floyd McClure, who operated an
unsuccessful pet cemetery,'' Morris says, ``but he kept talking
about his motivation. `Find a need and fill it,' he'd say. There's
Fred's story in a nutshell.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it's saying about this society, and secondarily about
Canada, is that Fred actually looks reasonable when he's saying,
`Well, if you're going to fry people, isn't it better that their
eyeballs don't fly across the room and hit the wall? If you're
going to kill people.' And as far as Canada goes, Fred doesn't
appear altogether unreasonable when he sits up there and says,
`Look, if I didn't do this, this guy wouldn't have a completely
fair trial.' Look at all the self-described Freds in the movie:
Fred the humanitarian, Fred the Florence Nightingale of death row,
Fred as the man who took the ouch out of the death penalty, Fred as
civil libertarian, Fred as champion of the underdog, Fred as
objective scientist, culminating with Fred as pariah. Quite a
Whitman Sampler!''
</P>
<P>
   Irony is always an ingredient of Morris's films. One of the
ironies here, among many, is that if Leuchter had simply stuck to
his death job, he likely would have continued to prosper. It was
when he hitched his reputation to neo-Nazi Holocaust deniers that
he undid himself. ``You know, every single movie that I've made is
about subjective stuff, as well as objective stuff. Or the
interplay between the two,'' Morris says. `` `Fast, Cheap &AMP; Out of
Control' was pretty much a movie about how people saw the world. I
guess the objective stuff in that movie was the objects of desire,
whether they be topiary animals or mole rats or circus animals.
Here's it's Fred's fantasies about himself. If you like, it's an
extended dream about himself. If you were to be unkind, a
narcissistic dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a kind of growing-up story. You know, growing up is when
your childhood fantasies collide _ and collision is exactly the
right world, an auto wreck of major proportions _ with the world.
And it becomes necessary to modify them accordingly if one is to
survive. Of course, you can go on, but the danger is that people
stop talking to you, you have no friends, you have no career, you
have no real place in the world. And I think it's just such a very
very funny and very sad story. Fred functioned OK as a
self-described execution technologist. But when he moved onto a
larger stage, the stage of world history, he got himself into big
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm asked very often whether I like Fred, and the answer is,
yes, I like Fred. There's something strangely endearing about the
man. Sometimes I wonder, am I just being taken in? Am I missing
something? Like, for example, the whole point? Am I being as
self-deceived as my protagonist? Which, I might add, is entirely
possible. But liking Fred is not tantamount to condoning what he's
done. Because the movie doesn't demonize Fred, there have been
complaints, to which I am not entirely unsympathetic. If you say
that Fred isn't an anti-Semite, or at least certainly not a
conventional anti-Semite, if you say he's not the devil incarnate,
that becomes in some quarters unacceptable. Two days before the
movie was to be screened at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art,
they got phone calls from the Museum of Tolerance, insisting that
my film be withdrawn! But this is not a movie about how Fred is
Satan. It's not a movie whose goal is demonizing Fred.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see myself as refuting (Holocaust denial) because I
don't really take it seriously enough. I don't think that the
movie, properly considered, is an attempt to refute Holocaust
denial. Although I became convinced in the course of making the
movie that it was essential to make it clear in the movie that Fred
was wrong. If you like: wrong, wrong, and wrong. By the end of the
movie, he's actually convinced that he has the expertise to do
almost anything. Even though he does not. He becomes convinced that
he can pass judgment on historical matters of which he has little
or no knowledge. At that point, the movie, at least for me, becomes
truly absurd, ridiculous. I was taken to task in a review that said
it was clear that I wanted Fred to be perceived as Everyman. The
reviewer said, `We are not all like Fred.' My answer is yes and no.
I would pose a slightly different question. Are we capable of
deceiving ourselves about what we do? And my answer is most
certainly yes.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Leuchter is keeping a low profile. Morris is sworn
to secrecy by Leuchter on the subject of Leuchter's whereabouts,
but says that Leuchter is no longer in the death business. ``He
says he's working on the world's fastest modem that would
`revolutionize communication as we know it.' You know my line about
the one thing that would revolutionize communication as we know it?
Silence.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that silence fills Morris's days. He describes his working
life as a hodgepodge, working on a lot of things at the same time.
Every couple of years a movie gets made. Right now, Morris is
working on a TV series for Bravo and Channel 4 in the United
Kingdom. ``It's called `First Person,' just that, people telling
their stories, but in a television half-hour. Like, if a
psychiatric hour is 50 minutes, a television half-hour is 22 or 23
minutes. I just interviewed a guy who invented a keyboard the size
of a credit card, an ex-CIA operative, and an aerospace technician
who built a creature called Robo-saurus. It's this huge 60-foot
robotic dinosaur that eats cars.'
</P>
<P>
   Morris has carved a niche for himself as a maker of TV
commercials. In the last year he has done commercials for Honda,
IBM, Dell Computers, and Datek, an on-line brokerage. Also Levi's.
``That was their so-called truth campaign, which I think was a
little too truthful in the long run. They wanted to do a series
with real kids, unscripted spots where kids were in fact honestly
talking about themselves. There was one spot about group sex,
another about truancy, another about homosexuality, another about
drug abuse, and so forth. What really amazed me was the spot that
became the most controversial of the lot was the one that involved
capitalism. Even with my fondness for irony, there are things that
even I can't begin to imagine. There was one spot where this young
woman spoke about how you have to work for what you get. Rush
Limbaugh loved it. NPR excoriated me.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris is currently represented on the tube with what he calls
the ``beer-amid'' commercial for Miller, the one where a guy sends
beer cascading down a pyramid of champagne glasses and says, ``If
the French know so much about champagne, how come they never
figured out a way to put it in cans?'' No small part of the obvious
pleasure he takes in it comes from its yahoo component. One of the
things Morris and Sheehan share is an against-the-grain
perspective. It extended to their marriage, which they happily
agree was as anti-romantic as marriages get. ``We went to the
Brooklyn criminal courts building,'' Sheehan says. ``We were
married in a judge's chambers, between two prostitution cases he
was hearing that day. Next to his desk was an American flag in a
pot. In the pot was rat poison. We couldn't have scripted it
better.''

HIGGINSON'S JOURNAL FURTHER COLORS WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KENNEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
THE COMPLETE CIVIL WAR JOURNAL AND SELECTED LETTERS OF THOMAS
WENTWORTH HIGGINSON 
Edited by Christopher Looby 
University of Chicago Press, 393 pp., illustrated, $35 
 
WHERE DEATH AND GLORY MEET 
Colonel Robert Gould Shaw and the 54th Massachusetts Infantry 
By Russell Duncan 
University of Georgia Press, 179 pp., illustrated, $35 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Colonel Thomas Wentworth Higginson took command of the 1st
South Carolina Volunteer Regiment in November 1862, he saw it as
not a military posting but as ``the beginnings of a momentous
military experiment.'' For the unit that Higginson was to lead for
19 months comprised black soldiers _ mainly former slaves, both
freed and escaped.
</P>
<P>
   And Higginson knew _ as Christopher Looby, a professor at the
University of Pennsylvania, writes in his introduction to the new
collection of Higginson's writings _ that the unit's ``real mission
was one of propaganda,'' of ``blazoning forth'' what he described
as ``the military availability of the colored race.''
</P>
<P>
   Higginson, then 39, was a natural choice for the command. He was
from a prominent old Massachusetts family with abolitionist
sympathies, and in the years just before the Civil War was one of
the ``Secret Six'' who had funded John Brown's antislavery
activities in Kansas and later at Harper's Ferry.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, Higginson was to draw on the journal for his
classic account, ``Army Life in a Black Regiment,'' but its entries
and his letters to his wife and other family members have a
sharp-eyed vitality and an untempered certainty of opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Just three days after taking command at a camp near Beaufort, S.
C., Higginson wrote that ``it needs but a few days to show the
absurdity of doubting the equal military availability of these
people, as compared with whites.'' The black soldiers, he observed,
had ``as much average comprehension of the need of the thing'' as
white ones; they also possessed as much courage and (a judgment
that might surprise a modern reader) ``as much previous knowledge
of the gun.''
</P>
<P>
   Higginson was also a sensitive observer of his men during
off-duty hours. That same evening, as he walked through the
encampment, Higginson came upon a group sitting around a campfire
listening to one of their fellows tell them how he escaped from his
slave master. Higginson recorded _ as he would do frequently _ the
dialect and locutions of the narrator and the reactions of his
listeners. But he also candidly recorded his own reactions. ``This
very narrator,'' he wrote, ``is one whom you would point to as he
hoed lazily in a cotton field, as one the light of whose brain had
gone out.'' But his actions demonstrated ``caution, foresight (and)
patient cunning'' _ leading Higginson to conclude that if he were
``to get into the enemy's country, I should be only too glad to put
myself as a child into (his) hands.''
</P>
<P>
   As Higginson became more familiar with his troops, and even more
confident of their ability, he complained that ``their best
qualities will be wasted by merely keeping them for garrison duty.
For partizan warfare they are admirably fitted,'' liking adventure
and having ``a great deal of dash and abundant resources.''
</P>
<P>
   And later, in a comment reflective of the deeply held beliefs of
the abolitionists, Higginson wrote that ``machines cannot make
soldiers like mine.'' And ``the better soldiers they become, the
more they are spoiled for slaves. I see that the latest rule
proposed in the rebel Congress is to sell by auction all slaves
taken in arms _ but no rational man would buy them; they know too
much.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Higginson's 1st South Carolina did not see
major action _ certainly nothing on the scale of the 54th
Massachusetts Infantry, another black unit whose bloody assault on
Fort Wagner is immortalized in that greatest of national monuments,
the Saint-Gaudens monument across from the Massachusetts State
House.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, Higginson makes little mention of the 54th or of its
commander, Colonel Robert Gould Shaw. He visited the 54th when it
arrived in South Carolina, but does not mention meeting Shaw. And
when Shaw is killed at Fort Wagner, Higginson gives it but a brief
mention in a letter to his mother.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Shaw, in a letter home to his mother after
Higginson's visit, speaks admiringly of him as one who ``put his
whole soul into his work'' and a man of ``open-heartedness and
purity of character.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw's letters _ as vivid and filled with a sense of mission as
Higginson's _ were published in 1994 as ``The Blue-Eyed Child of
Fortune.'' Their editor, Russell Duncan, has now written a fine
biography of Shaw, and together with Higginson's journal and
letters it provides an insight into the sense of misson that
animated men who not only fought a war but espoused a cause.

FILMS RECENTLY REVIEWED IN THE BOSTON GLOBE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   !! 1/2 ``Angela's Ashes'' More than an exquisitely photographed
coffee-table book of Frank McCourt's scrappy, luminous memoir of
growing up crushingly poor in Ireland in the 1930s and '40s _ but
not much more. Emily Watson is excellent in the title role of
self-sacrificing mother, and Robert Carlyle projects a softness
that allows us to understand why the boys loved their disappointing
alcoholic father. What the film hasn't got that the book has is
McCourt's voice. (R) &QL; 
 &QL; 
(FR) !!! ``Boondock Saints'' Two vigilantes, Irish Catholic
brothers, embark on a mission from God to rid Boston of evil _
namely the Russian mob, the Italian mob, and various dregs of
society. Reams of violence and profanity collide with whip-smart
dialogue, a generous helping of religious mysticism, and a gay FBI
agent smashingly portrayed by Willem Dafoe. It's not for the
faint-hearted, but this debut film from twentysomething
writer-director Troy Duffy, a Boston native, is a fresh, hip look
at the age-old question: What's more important, to do good or to do
right? (NC-17) (Joan Anderman) &QL; 
 &QL; 
! 1/2 ``Play It to the Bone'' Ron Shelton has written and directed
more lively sports comedies than anyone else. This just isn't one
of them. Over-the-hill boxers Antonio Banderas and Woody Harrelson
head from LA to Vegas to fill a last-minute hole in the prelim
card. Driving them is Lolita Davidvich, who means to cut a few
deals of her own there. They keep going, but the movie runs out of
gas and we run out of interest in them. (R) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!! ``The Third Miracle'' Agnieszka Holland's potentially
interesting take on faith and belief turns muddle-headed and
implodes, wasting another authentic working-class-textured
performance from Ed Harris as a Chicago priest in crisis, assigned
to investigate a candidacy for sainthood. Armin Mueller-Stahl, as
his nemesis, is given hopelessly corny lines, and Anne Heche, as a
woman with whom the priest gets involved, seems to be there just so
he can have a love interest. (R) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!! 1/2 ``Titus'' A brilliant film of a mediocre play. There's too
much stage blood and fustian in Shakespeare's gorefest striving for
tragedy, and not enough depth or complexity of character. Julie
Taymor brings it to striking life, though, filling the stage with
visuals that mesh the play's classic Roman imagery with modern
fascist architecture, projecting a cruel metaphysical world.
Anthony Hopkins is an accomplished title-
</P>
<P>
   roleist, especially when he slips into the Hannibal Lecter mode
in the play's most famous scene. Jessica Lange is a tigress as the
fierce queen of the Goths, and Harry Lennix excels in the only
really complex and interesting role _ that of her black lover,
Aaron. (R) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!! 1/2 ``Topsy-Turvy'' Mike Leigh's take on Gilbert and Sullivan
succeeds, but only up to a point, as he takes their contentious
relationship through a slump that ends with ``The Mikado.'' Jim
Broadbent is a sturdy, melancholy, pessimistic but persevering
Gilbert; Allan Corduner is an appealingly hedonistic Sullivan, and
the backstage bustle of the Victorian theater world raises the
wattage. But something's missing. Perhaps Leigh's working method _
his actors discover their characters in long improvisational
preliminaries, so that they own them _ just didn't work as well
with characters borrowed from history. There are enjoyable things
here, but it doesn't have the verve and vigor, the inner life, of
Leigh's contemporary films. (R)

<P>
   MOJI DAS CRUZES, BRAZIL _ At lightning speed, mammoth sewing
machines shoot aloe vera or baking soda into the lining of
disposable diapers.
</P>
<P>
   Another machine spits out ink that decorates diapers with the
lipstick kisses and signature of Brazilian superstar Xuxa.
</P>
<P>
   The last assembly line in this factory makes a no-frills diaper
called Baby Pop (short for Popular) that's decorated only with
ladybugs on the waistband.
</P>
<P>
   The economy diaper line is Houston-based Drypers' effort
to &UR;  &LR; react to the effects of Brazil's devaluation of its currency,
the real.
</P>
<P>
   The January 1999 devaluation was one of a series of events in
Latin America that soiled Drypers' earnings. The change in the
value of the real alone caused the cost of raw materials to
increase by 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the disposable diaper maker was reeling from
an August 1998 fire that destroyed its Argentine operation and a
price war in Mexico that gutted its sales.
</P>
<P>
   Drypers has survived the beatings and learned important lessons
about international markets along the way.
</P>
<P>
   The string of negative events forced it to restructure its
operations.
</P>
<P>
   In Argentina, Drypers suffered its biggest losses from the fire.
It then saw its sales fall because of the reduced buying power from
the currency devaluation of its customers in neighboring Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   So Drypers moved some of its Argentine production to its
factories in Malaysia and Mexico. The factories in those locations
allowed it to stay out the price war and beef up its overall
production. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; It reduced its work force in Argentina by not replacing
retiring employees, cutting 17 people from a total of 97.
</P>
<P>
   In Brazil, the company increased efficiency by shutting down its
oldest production line. That meant that employees who examine
individual diapers for rips and defects threw out fewer
``fraldas,'' as they're called in Portuguese.
</P>
<P>
   After the devaluation, officials at this mountainside factory
immediately started working to launch a new, cheaper brand of
diapers. Three months later, they were manufacturing Baby Pop.
</P>
<P>
   Baby Pop's price helped struggling parents in the wake of the
devaluation. A package of 16 large diapers sells for about $1.50,
compared with $2.50 for competing economy brands.
</P>
<P>
   Baby Pop quickly gained popularity and now accounts for 30
percent of the company's sales in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Prices of Drypers' premium line of diapers _ the ones with aloe
vera and baking soda in the lining and Sesame Street characters on
the waistband _ run about $4 in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its efforts to combat its troubles in Latin America, the
problems there still led to the corporation losing $780,000 in the
third quarter of 1999, compared with a profit of $1.5 million for
the same period of a year before. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Its share price has fallen to 2 3/16 Friday, down from a
52-week high of 4 4/16.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not thrilled with the profitability that's coming out of
South America, but at least the bleeding has stopped,'' Walter
``Wally'' Klemp, Drypers chairman and chief executive officer, said
at the company's headquarters in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Although Drypers blamed its loss on problems in its South
American operations &UR;  &LR; _ the company does not disclose how much of an
operating profit or loss it earns in each region _ &UR;  &LR; that hasn't
made Klemp shy away from the region, because he predicts big
profits from it in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we do well, we'll be a $2 billion company,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the company reported $332.6 million in revenues, $118.9
million from its international operations. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; About a quarter of Drypers' sales come out of Latin America, so
to reach its $2 billion goal, it must continue to focus on the
region.
</P>
<P>
   Conditions have improved since this time last year for the
diaper maker. Mexico's diaper price war is over, Drypers has
rebuilt its plant in Argentina into a new and better facility, and
Brazil has survived its economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the triple whammy hit Drypers when it was a
relative newcomer in the Latin American market.
</P>
<P>
   The baby products company expanded into Latin America in 1995,
first entering Argentina, the most stable economy in the region at
the time.
</P>
<P>
   It followed with Mexico in 1996. The country offered a large
population and it was quickly recovering from the 1994 peso
devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Drypers entered Brazil, mostly because of its enormous
population of 164 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to say you're a major player in Latin America
without being in Brazil,'' Klemp said.
</P>
<P>
   The move southward originally was made so Drypers could avoid
relying exclusively on the U.S. market, where it was pummeled in
1995 by a price war with diaper giants Kimberly Clark Corp. and
Procter &AMP; Gamble Co.
</P>
<P>
   Skyrocketing pulp prices were another reason the company's
profits plunged at the time.
</P>
<P>
   However, Drypers surprised its critics by staging a remarkable
recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Domestically, it teamed up with grocery stores such as Kroger
and mass merchandisers such as Kmart &UR;  &LR; to make private-label
diapers, which are similar to a generic brand in that they're
cheaper for the consumer.
</P>
<P>
   However, they typically don't have the store name on the
package, like generic brands.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1998, Drypers started a $10 million national
advertising campaign that helped it increase its domestic sales by
12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Internationally, Drypers aligned with retail giant Wal-Mart to
make the private-label diaper line Cozies.
</P>
<P>
   Then, it licensed the Sesame Street characters, which now appear
in advertisements, on packaging and on the diaper waistbands of its
premium Drypers around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The moves proved successful, and Drypers has registered sales
gains nearly every quarter. For the three months ended Sept. 30,
it's revenues totaled $94 million, compared to $86 million for the
same period of 1998 and $80 million for that quarter in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've proven time and time again we have what it takes to
survive some pretty awful stuff,'' said Klemp, who dreamed up the
company over coffee with his two partners in a Vancouver, Wash.,
diner.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE) &QL; 
$$$
</P>
<P>
   Despite recent world economic turmoil, Klemp is determined to
continue focusing on the international marketplace to fuel the
company's growth. Even after the Latin American woes began, the
company invested in a manufacturing facility in Cali, Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   However, that likely will be Drypers' last expansion for some
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had to consciously pull ourselves back,'' Klemp said.
``We're having to say the opportunity is out there to double our
company size, but financially that's not the smart thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Analyst John Rogers agreed that the company must focus on
improving its earnings, which he describes as far from stellar.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've put all the building blocks in place and now they
really have to capitalize on those investments,'' said Rogers, of
D.A. Davidson &AMP; Co. in Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   Drypers mut increase its international sales because the U.S.
market isn't growing. Not only is the fertility rate in the United
States stable at 2.5 children per woman, but nearly every American
baby wears disposable diapers instead of cloth diapers _ which
means there is no opportunity to switch mothers from cloth to
disposables.
</P>
<P>
   Both domestically and internationally, diaper makers face the
problem of customer turnover. That's because a mother uses diapers
for only a couple of years _ until her child becomes potty-trained.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to reinvent ourselves ever two years because there's
mothers leaving the market every year,'' said Graciela Picazo,
Drypers' marketing director in Guadalajara.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest marketing problem is competing with the Goliaths of
the industry, Irving, Texas-based Kimberly Clark and
Cincinnati-based Procter &AMP; Gamble. Those competitors sell a broad
array of products, so they are less vulnerable when a particular
market faces economic problems or one product's price fluctuates.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to gain market share in the United States is to
steal some of the business from someone else _ either Kimberly
Clark and Procter &AMP; Gamble or small players.
</P>
<P>
   That's tough to do with the giants when the two big consumer
products companies spend millions annually marketing their famous
diaper lines, Huggies for Kimberly Clark and Luvs and Pampers for
Procter &AMP; Gamble.
</P>
<P>
   ``How this company can ever, ever, ever compete with Procter &AMP;
Gamble, I just don't see how it's possible,'' said Marvin Roffman,
president of the Philadelphia-based money management company
Roffman Miller Associates, who follows Procter &AMP; Gamble's stock.
</P>
<P>
   While Drypers trails its huge competitors in the United States,
where it was a latecomer, it has gained a foothold in Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brand identity is less important in these markets,'' said
Klemp. ``They're more focused on getting a diaper that works for
the lowest possible price''
</P>
<P>
   Also, Drypers arrived in Latin America when disposable diapers
were becoming more accepted and more affordable.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were able to get into those markets early, before they
developed, and became a significant player,'' Rogers said.
</P>
<P>
   Latin America and the Caribbean are important to baby products
companies because of the region's higher fertility rate of 2.9
children per mother.
</P>
<P>
   Mothers there did not use disposable diapers for decades because
they were considered a luxury item, but that has changed, with more
mothers entering the work force and wanting goods that make their
lives easier.
</P>
<P>
   It is still common to see babies wearing cloth diapers. However,
even cloth diapers are too expensive for many in the region, where
the income level can be as low as a few hundred dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's vast areas with vast populations that use virtually
zero diapers today,'' said Joe Tanner at Dryers' operation in
Vancouver, Wash. ``It's always hot. (Babies) don't wear anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Latin America's higher fertility rate, coupled with the low
penetration rate of disposable diapers, means the market is growing
by 10 percent annually in number of diapers sold.
</P>
<P>
   Drypers controls 12 to 14 percent of the disposable diaper
market in Argentina and Brazil. In Mexico, it has about 2 percent
of the market because it does not yet have national distribution
there.
</P>
<P>
   Drypers became successful in Latin America by adapting to the
market there. It hired marketing experts from the region who had
worked at top consumer products companies there and also learned
from companies it bought that were already established in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Drypers hired Brazilian children's program host Xuxa
(pronounced Shu-Sha) as its spokeswoman shortly after she had her
daughter, Sasha. The company's Xuxa brand accounts for 30 percent
of its sales in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   The product is especially popular in Xuxa's home state of Rio de
Janeiro and the northeast region of Brazil. Many residents in the
northeast, descendants of Indians, are captivated by her blonde
hair and blue eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Another adaptation to the Brazilian market was to sell diapers
in smaller packages. Like its competitors, Drypers sells packages
of 10 to 18 diapers instead of the jumbo packages of 50 diapers
common in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult for the customer to double the out of pocket
(costs) and just have a 1 or 2 percent (price) advantage,'' said
Sofia Mata Martin, Drypers marketing director in Sao Paulo, as she
examined the diaper shelves at Carrefour, the French-owned
supermarket chain &UR; . &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Brazilian consumers just don't have the money to buy the bigger
packages.
</P>
<P>
   Some day the economy will improve, so buyers will have more
money in their pockets _ and that is likely to mean that Drypers'
sales will improve. Drypers is watching the market and ready to
react.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market will move to jumbo packages,'' Martin said. ``It's
not the time yet.''

LOLITAS WITH A BEAT

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like many young American females, Ali Gallagher is slightly
obsessed. She's a passionate music fan, a 24-7 lover of pop. She
wakes up to her favorite songs on ``Kiss 108.'' The Boston radio
station's music plays in the background while Ali works. If she
needs to be on the computer at home, there's always a music disc in
the CD drive. A lifelong dancer, Ali choreographs her own moves to
hit tunes. She spends most of her disposable income on her
fast-growing CD collection.
</P>
<P>
   Ali Gallagher is 10 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Mandy Moore and Britney Spears and Christina
Aguilera,'' gushes Ali, a fifth-grader at the Countryside School in
Newton, Mass. She's not alone. Somewhere on the order of 27 million
children ages 8 to 14, a brand new consumer group known to
marketers as tweens, helped Spears and Aguilera collectively sell a
staggering 14 million albums last year. Newcomer Mandy Moore _
whose debut CD, ``So Real,'' was released on Dec. 7 and has already
shipped half a million copies _ is following close behind.
</P>
<P>
   Gorgeous, blond, and nubile all, the current female pop stars
dominating the charts have a number of things in common. They are
themselves teenagers. They sell music to even younger fans. They're
singing about sex. And most of their songs were written by
middle-aged men.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give it to me / I'm so addicted to the loving that you're
feeding me / Ohhh / Can't do without it, this feeling's got me weak
in the knees/Oh, baby / Body's in withdrawal every time you take it
away / Ohhh/Can't you hear me callin'? / Begging you to come out
and play? / Aw, yeah . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   The song is called ``Candy,'' and the singer _ 15-year-old Mandy
Moore _ seems a bit confused about whether she's craving a trip to
the Sweet Shoppe or to Lover's Lane. But then ``Candy'' has little
to do with Moore's desires at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hooked up with two producers, Tony Battaglia and Sean
Fisher. Well, they kind of found me,'' she says. ``They basically
wrote the songs on the album.'' Moore, who lives at home with her
parents, confirms that she hasn't experienced everything that she
sings about. ``But it's stuff I could experience. Most of it.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't, of course, the first generation of pretty young
songbirds to have their careers shaped by powerful older men. From
Lesley Gore's classic adolescent angst and Brenda Lee's lovesick
ballads in the 1960s to the fresh-faced dance-pop of Tiffany and
Debbie Gibson in the '80s, the industry's male powerhouses have
paved the way for young girls to express adolescent yearning in
song. This, however, is the first generation of female teen singers
to emerge as unabashed bona fide sex symbols _ down to their
fashions, their makeup, and their lyrics. Perhaps more important,
these young stars are the first group of female idols to be
marketed so aggressively to teen and preteen girls.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, young girls _ pop stars and fans alike _ are
naturally sexual, grappling with their own physical and emotional
awakenings. They're growing up in a postfeminist culture that
allows an unprecedented freedom of expression; many of them have
parents influenced by the free-spirited '60s and '70s. But their
``liberated'' culture also carries a very real potential for
exploitation.
</P>
<P>
   When 17-year-old Spears begs her ex-boyfriend to ``give me a
sign, hit me baby one more time,'' she's expressing the fantasies
of the Swedish songwriter/producer Max Martin, who has penned hits
for the Backstreet Boys and also works with the Norwegian duo M &AMP; M
(both girls, ages 15 and 16) and Swedish ex-model Jessica Folker
(first single: ``Tell Me What You Like''). Moore's hit ``Candy''
was dreamed up by no fewer than four grown men (Jive, Dennis Rich,
Dave Katz, and Tony Battaglia). Similarly, when Christina Aguilera,
19, alerts her suitor, ``If you want to be with me / Baby, there's
a price to pay / I'm a genie in a bottle / You gotta rub me the
right way,'' she is giving voice to the sentiments of the
songwriting team of Steve Kipner and David Frank (Pam Sheyne is
also credited).
</P>
<P>
   Kipner, a seasoned songwriter whose previous hits include
``Let's Get Physical'' for Olivia Newton-John and ``The Hardest
Thing'' for 98 Degrees, has learned that ``that sort of shock value
is something you need to make people pay attention. Obviously
there's a sexual connotation in `Genie.' But it doesn't have to be
construed in a sexual way. It could also be `you've got to impress
me.' To be honest, Christina wasn't so sure about it. But Ron Fair
at RCA said he had to have this song. Now, Christina signs her
autographs `From Genie.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It's the latest trend in pop: older men writing sexy scenarios
for lovely teenage girls to sing. And younger kids are lapping it
up. These tweens have cash to burn: 10-to-14-year-olds now account
for about 9 percent of all CD sales. They're buying these fantasies
because the defining feature of tweendom is the nearly fanatical
impulse to aspire up _ to look older, act older, be older. ``We
asked 12-year-olds what age they would be if they could be any age,
and the answer was 17,'' says Michael Wood, vice president of
Teenage Research Unlimited, a market research firm based in
Northbrook, Ill., that specializes in the youth market. ``That's
who they're taking their cues from.''
</P>
<P>
   Teenage Research Unlimited conducts a twice-yearly study on teen
trends, lifestyles, attitudes, and product and media behavior, to
which more than 100 high-profile companies _ among them Disney,
ABC, the NFL, and a handful of record companies _ subscribe.
``Because of the strong numbers,'' Wood says, ``you've got people
who never targeted this age coming on. Look at Tommy Hilfiger,
Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch, all trying to capitalize on this new consumer.
Behind the scenes, you've got record companies recognizing the size
of this demographic, not only for record sales but for the
merchandising side as well. You talk about kids growing up fast . .
. a lot of it is based in commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   Commerce, as it translates for the impressionable tweens,
represents something more complex than the exchange of goods. And
music is much more than simple entertainment. It's a way to help
define who they are. ``It's not new to have children caught up in
pop-culture styles, fashion, or music,'' says Cornell University
historian Joan Jacobs Brumberg, author of ``The Body Project,'' a
history of American girls. ``What's new is that the girls are
younger than ever, and they have disposable income.'' The ages of
these artists, she says, makes them ``infinitely more seductive.''
And there's no question in her mind that the adult image projected
by the current teen stars has an impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every social science study done and every historical account
suggests that girls are maturing earlier than ever before. Some of
it is good _ the result of improved nutrition and decline in
infectious disease. But we have a lot of 9-, 10-, and 11-year-old
girls who are precociously sexual, who are interested in adult,
erotic things. If very early on you are encouraged by the culture
to be sexual _ not necessarily sexually active, but engage in
sexualized behavior, with language and clothes _ it changes you,''
says Jacobs Brumberg. ``It changes the nature of romance. Girls who
really get into this are seduced by the idea that their appearance
is the critical thing.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an idea that's being given fresh life by those with a
vested interest in perpetuating it: the movers and shakers in the
recording industry. ``I don't think that middle-aged men in the
music industry necessarily understand what's best for a developing
girl,'' Jacobs Brumberg says.
</P>
<P>
   They do, however, understand what's best for the bottom line.
Today's tweens represent the largest number in that age group in
two decades. By 2010, as the tweens morph into teens, there will be
more teenagers alive than ever before _ just shy of 35 million.
Teens spent $153 billion in 1999, an increase of 8.5 percent over
1998.
</P>
<P>
   The tweens, and their induction into the ranks of music
consumers, present new challenges for people like Betsy Frank, vice
president for research and planning at MTV networks, which includes
MTV, VH1, and Nickelodeon. ``At MTV, whose target audience is 12 to
34, we're winding up with kids who are younger than you'd expect
them to be,'' says Frank. ``So yes, there's been lots of discussion
about whether kids are growing up faster, whether they're going
through some things sooner. I think certainly the popularity of
Britney Spears over the last year has not been seen before. It
presents some unique challenges for how to appeal to kids.''

This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-to,

WAYS TO STOP THE STRESS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
By PHIL DAVIS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stress test: Los Angeles, morning rush hour. Traffic is finally
moving on the 101. The driver behind you is tailgating at 70 mph,
talking on a cell phone and checking the hairdo in the rearview
mirror. Do you:
</P>
<P>
   (A) Slam on your brakes, gesture wildly and then pull up right
on the car's tail.
</P>
<P>
   (B) Honk, shake your fist and scream unprintable obscenities.
</P>
<P>
   (C) Fire shots at the car.
</P>
<P>
   (D) Signal, change lanes, let the tailgater pass and bask in the
knowledge you're not as dumb as the other driver?
</P>
<P>
   If the correct answer is clearly D, why do traffic studies
constantly peg Southern California drivers as the rudest and most
aggressive in the nation?
</P>
<P>
   We're stressed _ jaw-clenching, neck muscle-cramping,
are-you-out-of-your-bleepin'-mind? S-T-R-E-S-S. And most of us _
especially in the middle of the L.A. freeway system _ are clueless
about how to get rid of it or not let it kill us.
</P>
<P>
   There are some simple ways to take the edge off, but first let's
look at how people get stressed out.
</P>
<P>
   It's not surprising that the pressures of life in the big city
keep most people boiling in a constant stew of stress hormones best
suited for storming Omaha Beach during World War II. The hormones _
adrenaline, for example _ increase alertness and divert blood from
vital internal organs to muscles, the so-called ``fight or flight''
response.
</P>
<P>
   ``The body is saying you've got to deal with this situation
somehow _ you have to resolve it or leave it,'' said Jean Hardesty,
an Encino psychologist who studies the effects of stress at the
University of California, Los Angeles. ``If you're being chased by
a lion, hopefully you run fast enough and you get rid of that
stress right away.''
</P>
<P>
   If fight-or-flight hormones stay elevated, stress becomes a slow
poison. Blood pressure rises, causing strain on the heart; rigid
muscles can cause back pain. The perpetually stressed also often
suffer from severe headaches and gastrointestinal stress _
including ulcers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of like putting your car in neutral and pushing the
gas pedal to the floorboard,'' Hardesty said. ``You're using up
your body faster and not going anyplace or resolving anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, most people need to relax, but it's not that easy,
especially in a city that prides itself on leading the world's
movers and shakers, said Linda Daniels-Hernandez, a licensed
clinical social worker at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in
Woodland Hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're so production-oriented. We try to pack so much into
every day,'' Daniels-Hernandez said. ``We need to think about not
doing so much, to prioritize what's really important. I know a lot
of people who sit at their desk and eat lunch. They don't even take
a real break. Getting away from your desk, just walking around the
building and getting fresh air for 15 minutes can make a tremendous
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are more stress-busting techniques:
</P>
<P>
   _ Breathe: A technique called ``cleansing breaths'' is the
cornerstone of any stress-reduction plan. It's also something you
can do in any situation. Take a deep breath, hold it for a few
seconds. Imagine the stress leaving your body as you exhale. This
also floods the body with oxygen, which also feels good.
</P>
<P>
   _ Progressive relaxation: This technique works best with the
help of a therapist or friend, Hardesty said. ``You go head to
toe,'' she explains. ``Tense up your forehead muscles, hold it for
three or four seconds and then relax it. You go right down the body
to your toes, clenching and relaxing. Imagine your stress melting
away.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Spot relaxation: If you don't have time to go head to toe,
concentrate on the muscles that hold tension _ frequently the jaw,
shoulders and neck. Hardesty said just relaxing the jaw, letting it
drop as if you just nodded off, will release loads of tension.
Again, this only works if you visualize the stress leaving your
body.
</P>
<P>
   _ Switch sides of your brain: If you write computer code or fix
car engines _ exercising the left brain _ try to do something
social when you get home. Right-brainers who spend the day in
social situations may want do something more solitary _ taking a
bath, making a salad or playing the piano.
</P>
<P>
   _ Just say no: Think before accepting new tasks. Do you have
time?
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't sweat things you can't control: If someone is driving
badly, ``Let it go, let it go,'' advises Daniels-Hernandez. ``Don't
take it on. You don't have control over other people, only your
reaction to them.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Exercise: Take a walk. Use the stairs instead of the elevator.
Join a tae kwon do class. Getting a workout doesn't have to be a
big production. Daniels-Hernandez offers this urban example:
Instead of battling for a parking place close to where you're going
_ a stressful situation _ park in the farthest space. There's no
stress, and the walk will do wonders for your stress level and your
muscles.
</P>
<P>
   _ Visualize: Stuck in traffic? Use the time to think about
something else. The color of the sky. Blades of grass popping
through the edges of the freeway. Play your favorite music. Listen
to a book on tape. Breathe.
</P>
<P>
   The key, Hardesty said, is experimenting: ``Everyone needs to
find what works for them.'' &QL;

<P>
   Read the tea leaves and the message is clear _ green is best.
</P>
<P>
   Green tea's long history is steeped in its medicinal powers and
studies continue to uncover more of its health benefits. All tea
comes from the camellis sinensis bush, a flowering evergreen
indigenous to China and India, but green tea leaves are the least
processed of all the teas, preserving the natural active substances
of the leaf.
</P>
<P>
   Monks used green tea as a mild mental stimulant and
traditionally it has been used to treat coughs, colds and
respiratory ailments. Today, research shows green tea may help
protect against many cancers, including lung, liver, pancreatic,
stomach, colon, mouth, throat, kidney, breast and skin.
</P>
<P>
   Green tea's natural chemical compounds, called polyphenols, are
powerful antioxidants. The primary polyphenols in tea are called
catechins, which protect against damaging forms of oxygen known as
free radicals. Catechins increase activity in the blood to help
lower cholesterol and regulate blood sugar and insulin levels.
</P>
<P>
   The more green tea you drink, the better, because it is full of
vitamins and minerals.
</P>
<P>
   A cup of green tea can give you a good dose of vitamin C, about
as much as you'll find in a lemon. It also contains several B
vitamins. Five cups of green tea a day provide 5 to 10 percent of
the daily requirement of riboflavin, niacin, folic acid and
pantothenic acid, 5 percent of the daily requirement of magnesium,
25 percent of potassium and 45 percent manganese. A cup of green
tea also contains 0.1 milligrams of fluoride, an amount higher than
in fluorinated water, helping protect against cavities.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   HOW TO MAKE A CUP OF TEA
</P>
<P>
   You can plop a tea bag in a mug with some water and microwave it
a minute or two if you don't care much what your tea tastes like.
But to make a flavorful and aromatic cup, follow these suggestions
from Linda Smith of Divinitea in Schenectady, N.Y.:
</P>
<P>
   _ Always use fresh, filtered cold water. Do not use water that
has already been boiled.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rinse the cup and/or pot with hot water before adding the tea.
</P>
<P>
   _ Place tea in cup or pot, add water and then cover. If making
black tea, let the water come to a boil and boil for 1 minute to
ensure the water is at the proper temperature. Allow black tea to
steep for 3 to 5 minutes, depending on your taste. Green tea
requires water that is only 165 to 185 degrees. Bring the water to
a boil, remove from heat and let sit for a minute to cool down.
Pour water over tea and steep for only 1 to 2 minutes. Green teas,
if allowed to steep too long, can become bitter.

   The New York Times News Service plans the following  &UR; Science
Times &LR;  stories for papers of Tuesday, Jan. 25:
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WEINBERG-PHYSICS (Austin, Texas) _ Scientist at Work: Dr.
Steven Weinberg, perhaps the world's most authoritative proponent
of the idea that physics is hurtling toward a ``final theory,'' a
complete explanation of nature's particles and forces that will
endure as the bedrock of all science for evermore. His withering
essay on the dangers of utopian thought was prominently featured in
this month's Atlantic Monthly. The third volume of his ``Quantum
Theory of Fields,'' a weighty work on matter and energy at its most
fundamental levels, is soon to be released by Cambridge University
Press. And he recently received the Lewis Thomas Prize, awarded to
the researcher who best embodies ``the scientist as poet.'' By
James Glanz. (1725 words)

</P>
<P>
   SCI-SHUTTLE (Undated) _ A new 11-day shuttle mission will
provide the most detailed topographic map of the entire earth ever
produced. By Warren E. Leary. (1700 words)
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-ASTRONOMY-PAPERS (Undated) _ A new 1,283-page compendium
lists what have been judged as the 53 most important papers to
appear in The Astrophysical Journal and The Astronomical Journal,
the most important journals in the field, in the 20th century.
Among them are the works of Edwin Hubble and a paper predicting the
existence of quasars. By James Glanz. (950 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-CELLS-EVOLUTION (Undated) _ New findings challenge the idea
that mitochondria, small bodies inside the cell, can be used to
track evolution. Specifically, several articles have challenged the
assumption of clonal inheritance in mitochondria, suggesting that
fathers, not just mothers, might be contributing mitochondrial DNA
to their offspring, a process called recombination. By Brenda
Fowler. (800 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-EXPLOSIVE (Undated) _ A cube shaped molecule, only a few
grams of which have been synthesized, may be the most powerful
non-nuclear explosive ever made. The chemical's creators have high
hopes for it. It might one day become the basis of an ultrapowerful
military explosive, a rocket fuel or drugs effective against some
types of cancer. By Malcolm Browne. (1050 words)
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-ORCHIDS (Undated) _ An appreciation of orchids and their
stunning variety and evolutionary cleverness. An essay by Carol
Kaesuk Yoon. (1000 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-PLUTONIUM-WEAPONS (Undated) _ Russian scientists have
discovered that weapons-grade plutonium is far more unstable than
previously suspected, a finding that could have implications for
the aging and reliability of America's arsenal of 10,000 or so
nuclear warheads. American scientists who recently learned of the
Russian discovery say they did so in the course of an exchange
program. But such teamwork has been curtailed by recent espionage
fears. By William J. Broad. (1050 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-PARRANDOS-PARADOX (Undated) _ A Spanish physicist has
discovered what appears to be a new law of nature that may help
explain, among other things, how life arose out of a primordial
soup, why President Clinton's popularity rose after he was caught
in a sex scandal, and why investing in losing stocks can sometimes
lead to greater capital gains. It's called Parrando's paradox. By
Sandra Blakeslee. (1200 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WATCH (Undated) News and notes on science: Items on behavior
patterns of endangered species and butterflies that have their own
sonar to alert them to bats. By Henry Fountain.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-SPINAL-INJURY (Undated) _ New research, particularly some
with rats, is showing promise in an area that has always perplexed
doctors: treating people permanently paralyzed as a result of
severed, crushed or diseased spinal cords. By Holcomb B. Noble.
(1800 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-DIET-GUIDELINES (Undated) _ Watch the sodas and don't eat
the chicken skin, but if you feel like having a glass or wine, or
two, help yourself. If the working version of the latest federal
dietary guidelines revision becomes the final version later this
month that advice will be part of the government's basic message.
By Marian Burros. (970 words)
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ Personal Health: The pain and fever
reliever acetaminophen, popularly called Tylenol, its first
over-the-counter trade name, is a very safe drug for children as
well as for adults. However, as with any medication, the dose makes
the poison. And in the case of acetaminophen, which has properly
replaced aspirin as the drug most often given to infants and
children, there is a relatively small window of safety. By Jane E.
Brody. (1100 words)
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-VITAL-SIGNS (Undated) _ News and notes on health and
fitness:
</P>
<P>
   _ Over the last decade, the fear of tainted blood led to a sharp
increase in the number of patients who stored their own blood
before surgery. Now a new Mayo Clinic study suggests that the
practice, known as autologous donation, is usually ineffective
except for those with low red-blood-cell levels. (245 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ An old brain may have a harder time learning new tricks, but
as a result may be less likely to be fooled, according to a study
that used a computer model of the mind's functioning to come up
with this counterintuitive finding. (310 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ Recent research appears to establish that finasteride and
minoxidil, known more commonly as Propecia and Rogaine, do help
stabilize hair loss and in some cases reverse it. But when the men
in one trial involving Procepia and a placebo were asked to rate
the cosmetic value of the treatment, the response from those who go
the drug were not all that more enthusiastic than from those who
did not. (175 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ Tests performed on frozen blood taken from Air Force
servicemen a half-century ago appear to show that the long-term
risk of liver disease from hepatitis C is lower than has been
commonly feared. (230 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ Implanting a substance known to slow cell growth into coronary
bypasses could cut down on the rate at which they clog up and need
replacement, British researchers report. (260 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ A science question answered: Why does eating
something really cold, like ice cream, sometimes give me a
headache? By C. Claiborne Ray. (290 words)

<HEADLINE>
AT 50, SIGOURNEY WEAVER PROVING IT GETS EASIER TO DO IT ALL
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Over the course of her 20-year film career, Sigourney Weaver has
played tough and shown her smarts, displayed some potent chemistry
with monkeys and Mel Gibson and, above all, established a screen
persona that is a potent combination of steely resolve and icy
remoteness. Warmth has never been her thing. Her husband, New York
theater director Jim Simpson, teases her for typically playing
women that you'd ``walk across the street to avoid.''
</P>
<P>
   Weaver, herself, is not one of those women. In fact, she says
she's not a serious person at all. Not that there's anything wrong
with being serious, she hastens to add.
</P>
<P>
   But when push comes to shove, Weaver describes herself as a
mother first, an actress second and ... well ... an idiot third.
Gravity, she says simply, is not her style.
</P>
<P>
   And now, just as she has passed her 50th birthday (and given her
astounding beauty, it's safe to say that Weaver is aging most
gracefully), the three-time Oscar nominee is getting the chance to
show the world just how stupid she can be. In ``Galaxy Quest,''
Weaver dons a blond wig and catsuit to play a washed-up sci-fi TV
actress who helps save the universe.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-foot-10 Weaver displays expert comic chops (and a fair
amount of skin, as her character's uniform becomes comically
tattered as the movie progresses), proving her contention that she
can make people laugh if given the chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always regretted having had such a serious career when
comedy is the one thing I feel I'm good at,'' Weaver says. ``The
response to `Galaxy Quest' has definitely been interesting. I think
I've surprised a lot of people who didn't think I had it in me.''
</P>
<P>
   Weaver's role in another new film, ``A Map of the World'' (which
returned to theaters last week after a brief Oscar-qualifying run
in December), is more in line with her overall body of work.
There's comedy here, too, in this story of a mother trying to cope
with everyday parental responsibilities and an unspeakable tragedy,
but the humor is arch and rueful, not the kind of stuff that's
going to appeal to audiences looking for mindless entertainment.
Weaver's performance is typically outstanding and earned her a
Golden Globe nomination and a great deal of Oscar buzz.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Map of the World'' (which is adapted from Jane Hamilton's
best-selling novel) also earned Weaver the opportunity to explore
another facet of her personality _ motherhood _ previously unseen
in her work. It's the first time she has played a mother on screen
_ a big deal for Weaver, given how devoted she is to her 9-year-old
daughter, Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sigourney is a mother; I've seen her in action,'' says Scott
Elliott, who directed ``A Map of the World.'' ``She's not a society
woman or Hollywood mom. She's someone very much in the thick of the
day-to-day responsibilities of raising a daughter. And she really
seems to love it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She does love it,'' adds Julianne Moore, Weaver's ``Map''
co-star. ``I think the fact that we're both mothers is one reason
the film works so well.''
</P>
<P>
   In the movie, Weaver's character, Alice, an acerbic school nurse
and a mother of two young daughters, endures and, at times, almost
embraces a litany of trials. She is wrongfully accused of child
abuse, sent to jail and, if that's not enough, witnesses an
inconceivable accident that produces a mountain of grief and guilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It stops just short of Job,'' Weaver jokes about Alice's fall
from grace. ``Nevertheless,'' she adds, ``it's a very universal
story. Every mother will be able to empathize with Alice.''
</P>
<P>
   Weaver says her experiences as a parent completely informed
every facet of her performance in the film and often paralleled
what she was experiencing on the set.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a low-budget film, so we typically had to move fast
and get through as many scenes as we could in a day,'' Weaver says.
``So the spontaneity of family life and the spontaneity of the way
we had to work was very similar. Sometimes, you're simply too tired
to think so you just have to do it. It may not end up perfect, but
it can be a very joyous experience because its so involving.''
</P>
<P>
   Weaver came to motherhood relatively late in her life; she was
41 when Charlotte was born. Prior to that, she used to look at her
friends who were mothers and marvel at their patience and
self-sacrifice. ``I had known them before, and they weren't always
that way,'' Weaver says, laughing. She wondered how one became so
selfless so fast. It didn't take her long to find out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great joy about being a parent is that it realigns you
totally to care for someone who is not yourself,'' Weaver says.
``Before I became a mother, I was basically nurturing myself or my
career or my husband, and all of a sudden there's this little
person and the rest just seems to fall away, as I think nature
intended it to do. You never look at life the same way again.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor does she seem to be looking at her career the same way, now
that she has played a mother in ``Map'' and a goofball in ``Galaxy
Quest.'' Her next film, ``The Breakers,'' has her playing Jennifer
Love Hewitt's mom in a broad comedy about a mother-daughter con
team who pull outrageous scams on rich men in Palm Beach, Fla.
Weaver and Hewitt will don numerous disguises and personas in the
comedy, which will begin shooting in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of wonderful comic possibilities,'' Weaver
says. ``And I'm playing a mother again, even if it is a grown
daughter this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Weaver is terribly bothered by playing the mother of a
young woman on screen. Turning 50 last October doesn't seem to have
produced any sadness or soul searching. She celebrated her birthday
at a party held on the same night as her 15th wedding anniversary,
and for Weaver, the big 5-0 was almost an afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get to be 49, you see how young 50 is,'' Weaver says.
``I always thought that it would be tougher. I've known the
occasional person who's turned 50 and I'd think, `Oh, God, that's
the beginning of the end there.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But it doesn't feel like that. It feels like you're inching
toward perhaps some sort of ... I don't know ... mastery. And
that's not a bad place to be at all.'' &QL;

   POETRY-DISABILITY (New York) _ Vanessa Cole writes poetry with
her toe. She cannot move her arms or legs. She cannot talk, nod,
smell, or taste, though she has a brilliant smile that compels a
response. She writes by pointing her toe at letters on a plastic
sheet that someone holds in front of her foot. For nine years Ms.
Cole, who is paralyzed from a stroke, has been a patient at a
hospital for the severely disabled, and for six of those years she
has been in a class taught by students in New York University's
graduate creative writing program. By Dinitia Smith.

   TV-MILLIONAIRE (Hollywood) _ On Sunday night, a contestant on
ABC's ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' embraced his gay partner
on the stage after winning $500,000. The audience cheered, Regis
Philbin, the host, grinned, and the network was not flooded with
protest calls. In its own quirky way, the quiz show, which is a
ratings juggernaut and the No. 1 show in the nation, has quietly,
and quite unwittingly, broken sexual and racial barriers on
television. By Bernard Weinraub.

   TV-CANADA (Toronto) _ If Canadians want to watch Hollywood
movies on television, they may have to switch the channel. On Jan.
6 Canada's broadcasting regulator told the Canadian Broadcasting
Corp. to phase out foreign ``blockbusters'' by 2003. What is new
and hotly debated here is the defiant stance taken by Robert
Rabinovitch, the CBC president. In a statement after the
regulator's report on Jan. 6, Rabinovitch said he would resist
efforts ``to transform CBC into the PBS of the North, with nothing
but elitist programming.'' By Susan Catto.

&HT;     AT LAST: A POLITICIANS WHO DOES MORE THAN TALK 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROB MORSE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., wants to make
sure that women who are victimized once won't be victimized twice,
or three times. She is drafting a bill to protect immigrants who
testify in criminal exploitation cases from being deported.
</P>
<P>
   In a world of sound bites and talking points, how many
politicians actually do something _ immediately and with absolutely
no self-serving rhetoric? On one recent morning, I buttonholed
Feinstein after a press conference on her bill to protect consumers
from unknowingly buying previously totaled used cars.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein hadn't heard of the case of Lakireddy Bali Reddy, the
Berkeley landlord accused of illegally importing and sexually
exploiting young women from India. I told her that women who might
testify against him have not been offered immunity from deportation
by the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   She got it immediately and quietly sprang into action. Feinstein
called over her field representative, Deborah Mesloh.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a case of a landlord in Berkeley who is accused of
importing and sexually abusing young women from India,'' she said,
while Mesloh took notes on a yellow legal pad. ``I want to make a
very strong appeal for them to the INS.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should go straight to the top, to (INS Commissioner
Doris) Meissner. These women should be able to get refugee status,
because if they go back to India they face a terrible stigma.''
</P>
<P>
   None of this was for my benefit. It was for the women's benefit.
I stood there taking notes, astonished at Feinstein's seriousness,
efficiency and comprehension of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Within an hour, a spokesman for Feinstein called to make a
clarification. He said that, because of current law, it may be hard
for the women to get refugee status. Therefore, Feinstein is
working on a bill that would prevent the deportation of immigrants
who testify against their exploiters.
</P>
<P>
   As yet, the scope of the bill, or the kind of crimes it would
cover, is being worked out.
</P>
<P>
   But Dianne Feinstein is on the case, along with her close
friend, the INS commissioner, so something will be done to protect
these women from being triply victimized.
</P>
<P>
   Any woman who testifies in a sexual molestation case may find
herself doubly victimized, whether by invasive cross-examination or
stigmatization.
</P>
<P>
   If a young Indian woman is deported after testifying in such a
case, the triple victimization would be unimaginable to most
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``My understanding from the affidavits is that the parents of
these girls sold them so that they could send money home,'' said
Hina Shah, a staff attorney for the Asian Law Caucus in San
Francisco. ``Their fate may not be very good if they're sent back
to India. If sexual molestation occurred, there may not be any
family members willing to take them in.''
</P>
<P>
   Or as a Pakistani friend, whose husband is from India, put it
over morning coffee, ``If they go back, they're dead.''
</P>
<P>
   My friend told a story about an Indian woman who found two
sexually abused girls whose families wouldn't take them back. The
Indian woman eventually adopted the girls. They were among the
lucky few.
</P>
<P>
   Americans should not feel too superior, though. Last week,
public health researchers at Johns Hopkins University reported that
one-third of the women in the world, across all countries and
cultures, had been beaten, raped, coerced into sex or otherwise
seriously abused.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't easy to bring an end to that. It is possible to keep
deportation, and possible death, from being imposed on victims of
abuse.
</P>
<P>
   The phrase ``tip of the iceberg'' keeps coming up in the case of
the Berkeley landlord and the young women he allegedly imported.
</P>
<P>
   What we have here is the tip of an iceberg that may be the tip
of a bigger iceberg, namely all immigrants who are afraid of
testifying in court. Feinstein hopes to address such fears, and fix
that flaw in our legal system.
</P>

   &UR; SCIENCE &LR;  (``a'' code)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WEINBERG-PHYSICS (Austin, Texas) _ Scientist at Work: Dr.
Steven Weinberg, perhaps the world's most authoritative proponent
of the idea that physics is hurtling toward a ``final theory,'' a
complete explanation of nature's particles and forces that will
endure as the bedrock of all science for evermore. His withering
essay on the dangers of utopian thought was prominently featured in
this month's Atlantic Monthly. The third volume of his ``Quantum
Theory of Fields,'' a weighty work on matter and energy at its most
fundamental levels, is soon to be released by Cambridge University
Press. And he recently received the Lewis Thomas Prize, awarded to
the researcher who best embodies ``the scientist as poet.'' By
James Glanz. (1725 words)

   SCI-ASTRONOMY-PAPERS (Undated) _ A new 1,283-page compendium
lists what have been judged as the 53 most important papers to
appear in The Astrophysical Journal and The Astronomical Journal,
the most important journals in the field, in the 20th century.
Among them are the works of Edwin Hubble and a paper predicting the
existence of quasars. By James Glanz. (950 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-CELLS-EVOLUTION (Undated) _ New findings challenge the idea
that mitochondria, small bodies inside the cell, can be used to
track evolution. Specifically, several articles have challenged the
assumption of clonal inheritance in mitochondria, suggesting that
fathers, not just mothers, might be contributing mitochondrial DNA
to their offspring, a process called recombination. By Brenda
Fowler. (800 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-EXPLOSIVE (Undated) _ A cube shaped molecule, only a few
grams of which have been synthesized, may be the most powerful
non-nuclear explosive ever made. The chemical's creators have high
hopes for it. It might one day become the basis of an ultrapowerful
military explosive, a rocket fuel or drugs effective against some
types of cancer. By Malcolm Browne. (1050 words)
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   SCI-ORCHIDS (Undated) _ An appreciation of orchids and their
stunning variety and evolutionary cleverness. An essay by Carol
Kaesuk Yoon. (1000 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-PLUTONIUM-WEAPONS (Undated) _ Russian scientists have
discovered that weapons-grade plutonium is far more unstable than
previously suspected, a finding that could have implications for
the aging and reliability of America's arsenal of 10,000 or so
nuclear warheads. American scientists who recently learned of the
Russian discovery say they did so in the course of an exchange
program. But such teamwork has been curtailed by recent espionage
fears. By William J. Broad. (1050 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-PARRANDOS-PARADOX (Undated) _ A Spanish physicist has
discovered what appears to be a new law of nature that may help
explain, among other things, how life arose out of a primordial
soup, why President Clinton's popularity rose after he was caught
in a sex scandal, and why investing in losing stocks can sometimes
lead to greater capital gains. It's called Parrando's paradox. By
Sandra Blakeslee. (1200 words)

   SCI-WATCH (Undated) News and notes on science: Items on behavior
patterns of endangered species and butterflies that have their own

doctors: treating people permanently paralyzed as a result of
severed, crushed or diseased spinal cords. By Holcomb B. Noble.

</P>
<P>
   SCI-DIET-GUIDELINES (Undated) _ Watch the sodas and don't eat
the chicken skin, but if you feel like having a glass or wine, or
two, help yourself. If the working version of the latest federal
dietary guidelines revision becomes the final version later this
month that advice will be part of the government's basic message.

   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ Personal Health: The pain and fever
reliever acetaminophen, popularly called Tylenol, its first
over-the-counter trade name, is a very safe drug for children as
well as for adults. However, as with any medication, the dose makes
the poison. And in the case of acetaminophen, which has properly
replaced aspirin as the drug most often given to infants and
children, there is a relatively small window of safety. By Jane E.
Brody. (1100 words)

</P>
<P>
   SCI-VITAL-SIGNS (Undated) _ News and notes on health and
fitness:
</P>
<P>
   _ Over the last decade, the fear of tainted blood led to a sharp
increase in the number of patients who stored their own blood
before surgery. Now a new Mayo Clinic study suggests that the
practice, known as autologous donation, is usually ineffective
except for those with low red-blood-cell levels. (245 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ An old brain may have a harder time learning new tricks, but
as a result may be less likely to be fooled, according to a study
that used a computer model of the mind's functioning to come up
with this counterintuitive finding. (310 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ Recent research appears to establish that finasteride and
minoxidil, known more commonly as Propecia and Rogaine, do help
stabilize hair loss and in some cases reverse it. But when the men
in one trial involving Procepia and a placebo were asked to rate
the cosmetic value of the treatment, the response from those who go
the drug were not all that more enthusiastic than from those who
did not. (175 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ Tests performed on frozen blood taken from Air Force
servicemen a half-century ago appear to show that the long-term
risk of liver disease from hepatitis C is lower than has been
commonly feared. (230 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ Implanting a substance known to slow cell growth into coronary
bypasses could cut down on the rate at which they clog up and need
replacement, British researchers report. (260 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ A science question answered: Why does eating
something really cold, like ice cream, sometimes give me a
headache? By C. Claiborne Ray. (290 words)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ENTERTAINMENT &LR;  (``e'' code)

<P>
   POETRY-DISABILITY (New York) _ Vanessa Cole writes poetry with
her toe. She cannot move her arms or legs. She cannot talk, nod,
smell, or taste, though she has a brilliant smile that compels a
response. She writes by pointing her toe at letters on a plastic
sheet that someone holds in front of her foot. For nine years Ms.
Cole, who is paralyzed from a stroke, has been a patient at a
hospital for the severely disabled, and for six of those years she
has been in a class taught by students in New York University's
graduate creative writing program. By Dinitia Smith.
</P>
<P>
   TV-MILLIONAIRE (Hollywood) _ On Sunday night, a contestant on
ABC's ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' embraced his gay partner
on the stage after winning $500,000. The audience cheered, Regis
Philbin, the host, grinned, and the network was not flooded with
protest calls. In its own quirky way, the quiz show, which is a
ratings juggernaut and the No. 1 show in the nation, has quietly,
and quite unwittingly, broken sexual and racial barriers on
television. By Bernard Weinraub.
</P>
<P>
   TV-CANADA (Toronto) _ If Canadians want to watch Hollywood
movies on television, they may have to switch the channel. On Jan.
6 Canada's broadcasting regulator told the Canadian Broadcasting
Corp. to phase out foreign ``blockbusters'' by 2003. What is new
and hotly debated here is the defiant stance taken by Robert
Rabinovitch, the CBC president. In a statement after the
regulator's report on Jan. 6, Rabinovitch said he would resist
efforts ``to transform CBC into the PBS of the North, with nothing
but elitist programming.'' By Susan Catto.

<P>
   MINGO, IOWA _ It is a perfect winter's morning _ the sun
sparkling off the snowy fields, the sky a perfect blue with just a
brush stroke of cloud across the horizon. Out in the woods, the
deer are scudding through the snow, and two red-tailed hawks are
circling lazily through the oak and hickory trees.
</P>
<P>
   But John Parsons has no time to watch the wildlife today. He is
clearing the snow from his drive in his bright green John Deere
tractor.
</P>
<P>
   This is democracy at work, Iowa-style.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight (Monday), Parsons and his wife, Jenifer, will welcome a
dozen or so of their neighbors to help choose the next president of
the United States in the first electoral event of the 2000
election.
</P>
<P>
   Like a hundred or so others across Iowa, they will be holding a
caucus to decide who they think should be the candidate, in their
case for the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the grass-roots level,'' he says. ``This is the bottom
of the ladder.''
</P>
<P>
   What will be going on Monday, on this bottom rung, will be the
first stage in the process of choosing representatives who will
finally, at the party's convention in August, choose the Democrats'
man.
</P>
<P>
   It is a peculiarity of the U.S. system that Iowa gets to choose
first, ahead of far larger states. ``I don't know how Iowa ever got
to be first,'' says Parsons with a grin. Asked if it makes any
sense, he says simply: ``Somebody's got to be first.''
</P>
<P>
   He is backing Al Gore, the front-runner for the Democrats and
likely victor. ``He's always been a strong supporter of the
environment,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Parsons, a wiry man with a grizzled beard and a ready laugh, is
the park ranger here at the Ashton Wildwood Nature Reserve, a
hundred hilly acres of woods thick with deer and wild turkey.
Outside the window, purple finches, goldfinches and bright red
cardinals peck at the seed he has set out.
</P>
<P>
   It is a world away from Washington, D.C., and the popular image
of power in America, propelled by television advertisements,
thousand-dollar lunches and corporate jets.
</P>
<P>
   But the solid heritage of rural democracy is fading. Only a
hundred or so of the caucuses out of 2,100 are still held in homes.
The rest are in schools, churches, community centers, American
Legion halls and fire stations, the infrastructure of civil society
that is spread across this large, flat state.
</P>
<P>
   Once, Iowa was mainly agricultural; now, the small farmers are
in retreat, and from Ankeny and Bondurante and a hundred other
towns, suburbs are sprouting into the cornfields speckled with
snow.
</P>
<P>
   Half of those gathered around the tables at the Parsons' will be
farmers; the rest are in business, commuting into Des Moines or
Newton, where there is a big Maytag factory making dishwashers.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Parsons was still at church Sunday, but much of the work
had already been done. Loads of cookies are stacked on paper plates
under tin foil in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Today (Monday) they will move back the solid wooden furniture in
the front room, and extend the dining room table. There will be
coffee, though Parsons doesn't drink it himself. He will eat the
cookies, though. &QL;

   MINGO, IOWA _ It is a perfect winter's morning _ the sun
sparkling off the snowy fields, the sky a perfect blue with just a
brush stroke of cloud across the horizon. Out in the woods, the
deer are scudding through the snow, and two red-tailed hawks are
circling lazily through the oak and hickory trees.
</P>
<P>
   But John Parsons has no time to watch the wildlife today. He is
clearing the snow from his drive in his bright green John Deere
tractor.
</P>
<P>
   This is democracy at work, Iowa-style.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight (Monday), Parsons and his wife, Jenifer, will welcome a
dozen or so of their neighbors to help choose the next president of
the United States in the first electoral event of the 2000
election.
</P>
<P>
   Like a hundred or so others across Iowa, they will be holding a
caucus to decide who they think should be the candidate, in their
case for the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the grass-roots level,'' he says. ``This is the bottom
of the ladder.''
</P>
<P>
   What will be going on Monday, on this bottom rung, will be the
first stage in the process of choosing representatives who will
finally, at the party's convention in August, choose the Democrats'
man.
</P>
<P>
   It is a peculiarity of the U.S. system that Iowa gets to choose
first, ahead of far larger states. ``I don't know how Iowa ever got
to be first,'' says Parsons with a grin. Asked if it makes any
sense, he says simply: ``Somebody's got to be first.''
</P>
<P>
   He is backing Al Gore, the front-runner for the Democrats and
likely victor. ``He's always been a strong supporter of the
environment,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Parsons, a wiry man with a grizzled beard and a ready laugh, is
the park ranger here at the Ashton Wildwood Nature Reserve, a
hundred hilly acres of woods thick with deer and wild turkey.
Outside the window, purple finches, goldfinches and bright red
cardinals peck at the seed he has set out.
</P>
<P>
   It is a world away from Washington, D.C., and the popular image
of power in America, propelled by television advertisements,
thousand-dollar lunches and corporate jets.
</P>
<P>
   But the solid heritage of rural democracy is fading. Only a
hundred or so of the caucuses out of 2,100 are still held in homes.
The rest are in schools, churches, community centers, American
Legion halls and fire stations, the infrastructure of civil society
that is spread across this large, flat state.
</P>
<P>
   Once, Iowa was mainly agricultural; now, the small farmers are
in retreat, and from Ankeny and Bondurante and a hundred other
towns, suburbs are sprouting into the cornfields speckled with
snow.
</P>
<P>
   Half of those gathered around the tables at the Parsons' will be
farmers; the rest are in business, commuting into Des Moines or
Newton, where there is a big Maytag factory making dishwashers.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Parsons was still at church Sunday, but much of the work
had already been done. Loads of cookies are stacked on paper plates
under tin foil in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Today (Monday) they will move back the solid wooden furniture in
the front room, and extend the dining room table. There will be
coffee, though Parsons doesn't drink it himself. He will eat the
cookies, though. &QL;

&HT;     TRAFFIC RELIEF AT THE PUSH OF A BUTTON 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By HARRY ROSENFELD  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Quantities of studies inform us that it's getting
harder to get around town, almost anywhere in America. Even areas
merely holding their own in population are nevertheless finding
their roads and highways more congested as more autos take to the
road.
</P>
<P>
   That's certainly true for Albany, where we cling for dear life
to the magical 100,000 population figure and the federal largess
that accompanies it. Authoritative reports detail the growth in
traffic over the decades. Absent the surveys, drivers would know
from personal experience how often they have to sit and wait in a
long line for the light to change to green.
</P>
<P>
   All manner of devices are promised in the near future to
measurably reduce these annoyances, for that is what they are. On
our worst days, our problems are not in the running compared to New
York City or Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Appreciating that modest size does not in every circumstance
equate with a disadvantage should not mean, however, that we settle
for what we've got when something better is readily available.
</P>
<P>
   While we await the installation of high-tech super smart
devices, software, fiber-optics and video cameras that will
accurately gauge traffic flow, adjust the duration of traffic
lights accordingly and redirect traffic away from jams, we can turn
to technology available today to upgrade.
</P>
<P>
   All it takes is adjusting the lights so that at a given moderate
speed a driver will be able to proceed for blocks upon many blocks
without having to stop at nearly each intersection.
</P>
<P>
   From time to time, in fact, that is already happening. Only
recently, a hardly comprehensive personal survey found that one
could proceed through as many as three traffic lights without
having to stop. While that is not the perfection, it is still very
much an improvement.
</P>
<P>
   How disheartening, then, to find that immediately after that
first red light, the second was only a block down the road. Some
more tinkering is in order.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be that Albany was notorious for a system that
guaranteed a car would have to come to a halt at every
intersection.
</P>
<P>
   To account for this peculiar situation, Albany residents, long
experienced to living in the fiefdom of an entrenched political
machine, found the explanation in politics. It was widely believed
that the frequency of traffic stops was part of a fix. The machine,
the reasoning went, wanted to reward its special supporters in the
auto repair and gas station trade. Forcing cars to pull up at every
block or second block guaranteed heavy wear and tear on the brakes
and the tires, along with the consumption of extra gallons of
gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   The misalliance between the City Hall machine and certain repair
shops was also said to account for the long life potholes enjoyed
in season.
</P>
<P>
   As equivocal as that explanation appears given the absence of
iron-clad proof, its wide acceptance says something about our
culture.
</P>
<P>
   At all events, that took place in long-gone bad old days. Here
we are in the year 2000, and those sorts of things no longer
happen, if they ever did. Consequently there should be no
impediment to staggering the lights and speeding up traffic as an
everyday sort of thing.
</P>
<P>
   The temperament of drivers would be infused with a beneficial
dose of internal calm. Road rage would be mitigated. While we would
remain a city standing on our tippy toes to come up with 100,000
souls, we would be a happier community.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the fewer stops would lead to a measurable
reduction in the hundreds of tons of bad stuff, like carbon
monoxide and hydrocarbons, put into the air we and our families and
friends inhale each year.
</P>
<P>
   By using up less fuel, we would help our nation's balance of
trade. Importation of oil has helped take that imbalance to a
record high.
</P>
<P>
   Adding up all the savings, each driver is sure to pocket
something in the neighborhood of $300 a year, money which could be
spent in the state lottery or in the state-sanctioned casinos that
are being planned.
</P>
<P>
   In short, those people with their finger on the traffic button
have the opportunity to create so much good, for so many, so
quickly. All they need to do is to do it.
</P>

<P>
   DES MOINES - George W. Bush, the leading Republican candidate
for U.S. President, has built his political career on donations
from a small group of wealthy corporate donors, a new report
alleges.
</P>
<P>
   All of the candidates have raised large sums from business and
all are subject to charges of pandering to corporate interests. But
Bush is particularly vulnerable to charges of buying the election.
</P>
<P>
   He has raised a record $67 million already, far more than any of
his opponents, Democrat or Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats accuse him of letting big business run the state while
he was Governor of Texas. And after the fund-raising scandals of
the Clinton Administration, the seamy side of campaign finance is
finally starting to raise America's concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Texans for Public Justice, a lobby group, calculates that Bush
received $3 million from just 100 wealthy businessmen and women for
his Texas Governor's campaigns in 1994 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``A small group of business tycoons were instrumental in putting
George Bush in the Governor's Mansion,'' said Craig L. McDonald,
Director of Texans for Public Justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``A disturbing number of these profiteers made a fortune off
government handouts or by bending or breaking regulatory rules.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no limits on campaign donations in Texas state
contests. ``Bush raised $10 million from just 207 donors who gave
at least $25,000,'' says the report.
</P>
<P>
   Top of the list of donors are Charles and Sam Wyly, who gave
Bush over dollars 200,000 for his two campaigns. Their firm,
Maverick Capital Fund, received a state contract to invest
University of Texas funds in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Other donors sought reforms to limit damage payouts in civil
lawsuits, a reform which was subsequently agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Other donors include Kenneth &AMP; Linda Lay, of the energy giant
Enron; Ray L. Hunt, heir to the family oil fortune; Robert
Mosbacher and James Baker, former officials in the administration
of Bush's father, President George Bush, both of whom became paid
consultants to Enron (Baker was secretary of state during the Gulf
War); Jim Bob Moffett, who runs Freeport-McMoRan, which operates
the world's biggest gold mine in Indonesia; George and Richard
Wackenhut of the giant prison and security company Wackenhut, which
has large contracts with the state of Texas; and members of the
very wealthy Bass family, who financed one of Bush's earlier
ventures in the oil industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush is the candidate of the Lear Jet set, not the minivan
crowd, and people need to know that,'' said McDonald.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign rejects this, arguing that Bush does not grant
favors to contributors and that Bush's sweeping election victories
prove he has support across the state, not just amongst
businessmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texans know that Governor Bush has received broad-based
support from people of all walks of life across the state for his
agenda of improving public schools and cutting taxes,'' said a Bush
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the large donors also feature in the list of Bush's
Pioneers, each of whom promised to raise $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   In federal campaigns there is an individual limit of $1,000 on
contributions to candidates. But more can be given to Political
Action Committees, and in some companies, many individuals combine
to give money to candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``What George W. Bush and his money men are really `pioneering,'
is the next generation of the political arms race, where the sky's
the limit on spending and on special-interest money in our
presidential primaries,'' said Donald J. Simon, acting president of
the lobby group Common Cause last year.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate list of the top career donors to Bush, the
Campaign for Public Integrity put Enron at the top of the lost with
more than $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   Close behind were credit card company MBNA, Vinson and Elkins, a
large Houston law firm, and the Bass family. The same names, along
with Ernst &AMP; Young, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America
and Goldman Sachs, figure on a list of top donors to Bush's
presidential campaign compiled by the Center for Responsive
Politics. &QL;

<P>
   DES MOINES - George W. Bush, the leading Republican candidate
for U.S. President, has built his political career on donations
from a small group of wealthy corporate donors, a new report
alleges.
</P>
<P>
   All of the candidates have raised large sums from business and
all are subject to charges of pandering to corporate interests. But
Bush is particularly vulnerable to charges of buying the election.
</P>
<P>
   He has raised a record $67 million already, far more than any of
his opponents, Democrat or Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats accuse him of letting big business run the state while
he was Governor of Texas. And after the fund-raising scandals of
the Clinton Administration, the seamy side of campaign finance is
finally starting to raise America's concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Texans for Public Justice, a lobby group, calculates that Bush
received $3 million from just 100 wealthy businessmen and women for
his Texas Governor's campaigns in 1994 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``A small group of business tycoons were instrumental in putting
George Bush in the Governor's Mansion,'' said Craig L. McDonald,
Director of Texans for Public Justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``A disturbing number of these profiteers made a fortune off
government handouts or by bending or breaking regulatory rules.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no limits on campaign donations in Texas state
contests. ``Bush raised $10 million from just 207 donors who gave
at least $25,000,'' says the report.
</P>
<P>
   Top of the list of donors are Charles and Sam Wyly, who gave
Bush over dollars 200,000 for his two campaigns. Their firm,
Maverick Capital Fund, received a state contract to invest
University of Texas funds in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Other donors sought reforms to limit damage payouts in civil
lawsuits, a reform which was subsequently agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Other donors include Kenneth &AMP; Linda Lay, of the energy giant
Enron; Ray L. Hunt, heir to the family oil fortune; Robert
Mosbacher and James Baker, former officials in the administration
of Bush's father, President George Bush, both of whom became paid
consultants to Enron (Baker was secretary of state during the Gulf
War); Jim Bob Moffett, who runs Freeport-McMoRan, which operates
the world's biggest gold mine in Indonesia; George and Richard
Wackenhut of the giant prison and security company Wackenhut, which
has large contracts with the state of Texas; and members of the
very wealthy Bass family, who financed one of Bush's earlier
ventures in the oil industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush is the candidate of the Lear Jet set, not the minivan
crowd, and people need to know that,'' said McDonald.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign rejects this, arguing that Bush does not grant
favors to contributors and that Bush's sweeping election victories
prove he has support across the state, not just amongst
businessmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texans know that Governor Bush has received broad-based
support from people of all walks of life across the state for his
agenda of improving public schools and cutting taxes,'' said a Bush
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the large donors also feature in the list of Bush's
Pioneers, each of whom promised to raise $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   In federal campaigns there is an individual limit of $1,000 on
contributions to candidates. But more can be given to Political
Action Committees, and in some companies, many individuals combine
to give money to candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``What George W. Bush and his money men are really `pioneering,'
is the next generation of the political arms race, where the sky's
the limit on spending and on special-interest money in our
presidential primaries,'' said Donald J. Simon, acting president of
the lobby group Common Cause last year.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate list of the top career donors to Bush, the
Campaign for Public Integrity put Enron at the top of the lost with
more than $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   Close behind were credit card company MBNA, Vinson and Elkins, a
large Houston law firm, and the Bass family. The same names, along
with Ernst &AMP; Young, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America
and Goldman Sachs, figure on a list of top donors to Bush's
presidential campaign compiled by the Center for Responsive
Politics. &QL;

<P>
   DES MOINES _ Al Gore and George W. Bush, the front-runners for
the Democrat and Republican nominations for U.S. president, both go
into today's (Monday's) Iowa caucuses as the favorites to win.
</P>
<P>
   The first event of the U.S. electoral season will see thousands
of voters trooping along to fire stations, community halls,
churches, schools and each others' houses tonight (Monday) to vote
for their candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The results are sometimes hard to interpret or measure; the
significance, in a state that is hardly representative of America
in the 21st century, is uncertain in the broader context. But for
both candidates, victory would mean the first step on the road to
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley, the Democratic challenger to Vice President Gore,
received an unexpected fillip Sunday when the Des Moines Register
endorsed his candidacy. The state's leading paper said that it had
found the choice very difficult, but on balance, the former
basketball player and U.S. senator was their man.
</P>
<P>
   ``The task involves looking for the leader whose ideas and
approach to governing most closely match the needs of the times,''
said the paper. ``That's where we give the edge to Bradley.''
</P>
<P>
   But the opinion polls have less good news. A poll in the
Register gave Gore a comfortable 56 percent, rising from 54 percent
earlier this month, while Bradley had slipped from 33 percent to 28
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The challenger has been weakened by indecision about whether and
how to respond to criticism from Gore, and by reports of his own
heart problems, which while not life-threatening undercut the image
of a vital and healthy former athlete.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know we're behind,'' said Bradley at the weekend. ``Maybe
we'll surprise a few people.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore now has the advantage over Bradley in New Hampshire
according to several polls, but given the difficulties of measuring
opinion it is probably too close to call.
</P>
<P>
   Less surprising was the Register's decision to endorse Bush, the
Governor of Texas. He seems set for a wide victory in Iowa: the
only element that remains to be decided is his margin of victory,
which could have a big impact on the New Hampshire primary in a
week's time, the next big campaign event.
</P>
<P>
   In the northeastern state Bush is behind Senator John McCain,
his main Republican challenger, according to most polls, but again
realistically it is too close to call.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes, the billionaire publisher, seems assured of second
place for the Republicans in Iowa. Third place is a much tighter
race, but Alan Keyes, the Christian conservative broadcaster and
the only black candidate, was making a strong showing.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion has been one of the key issues in a religious,
conservative state, and Keyes has run some very strongly worded,
clear advertisements on television.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer, another Christian conservative, was fighting for
third place with Keyes, but his campaign looked to be in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has the support of 43 percent of likely Republican
participants, the poll says, a little down from the last such
sounding. But Forbes is stuck at 20 percent; Keyes and Bauer are
all at 4 percent. So is McCain, the senator from Arizona, even
though he has not campaigned in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   The number of voters from both parties who are either not sure
or uncommitted remains well above 10 percent. One of the biggest
dangers for all the candidates is that voters will assume that the
result is a foregone conclusion and fail to turn out.
</P>
<P>
   There are many nicer places to be on a cold winter's night than
the local American Legion post, arguing about politics. &QL;

<P>
   DES MOINES _ Al Gore and George W. Bush, the front-runners for
the Democrat and Republican nominations for U.S. president, both go
into today's (Monday's) Iowa caucuses as the favorites to win.
</P>
<P>
   The first event of the U.S. electoral season will see thousands
of voters trooping along to fire stations, community halls,
churches, schools and each others' houses tonight (Monday) to vote
for their candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The results are sometimes hard to interpret or measure; the
significance, in a state that is hardly representative of America
in the 21st century, is uncertain in the broader context. But for
both candidates, victory would mean the first step on the road to
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley, the Democratic challenger to Vice President Gore,
received an unexpected fillip Sunday when the Des Moines Register
endorsed his candidacy. The state's leading paper said that it had
found the choice very difficult, but on balance, the former
basketball player and U.S. senator was their man.
</P>
<P>
   ``The task involves looking for the leader whose ideas and
approach to governing most closely match the needs of the times,''
said the paper. ``That's where we give the edge to Bradley.''
</P>
<P>
   But the opinion polls have less good news. A poll in the
Register gave Gore a comfortable 56 percent, rising from 54 percent
earlier this month, while Bradley had slipped from 33 percent to 28
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The challenger has been weakened by indecision about whether and
how to respond to criticism from Gore, and by reports of his own
heart problems, which while not life-threatening undercut the image
of a vital and healthy former athlete.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know we're behind,'' said Bradley at the weekend. ``Maybe
we'll surprise a few people.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore now has the advantage over Bradley in New Hampshire
according to several polls, but given the difficulties of measuring
opinion it is probably too close to call.
</P>
<P>
   Less surprising was the Register's decision to endorse Bush, the
Governor of Texas. He seems set for a wide victory in Iowa: the
only element that remains to be decided is his margin of victory,
which could have a big impact on the New Hampshire primary in a
week's time, the next big campaign event.
</P>
<P>
   In the northeastern state Bush is behind Senator John McCain,
his main Republican challenger, according to most polls, but again
realistically it is too close to call.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes, the billionaire publisher, seems assured of second
place for the Republicans in Iowa. Third place is a much tighter
race, but Alan Keyes, the Christian conservative broadcaster and
the only black candidate, was making a strong showing.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion has been one of the key issues in a religious,
conservative state, and Keyes has run some very strongly worded,
clear advertisements on television.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer, another Christian conservative, was fighting for
third place with Keyes, but his campaign looked to be in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has the support of 43 percent of likely Republican
participants, the poll says, a little down from the last such
sounding. But Forbes is stuck at 20 percent; Keyes and Bauer are
all at 4 percent. So is McCain, the senator from Arizona, even
though he has not campaigned in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   The number of voters from both parties who are either not sure
or uncommitted remains well above 10 percent. One of the biggest
dangers for all the candidates is that voters will assume that the
result is a foregone conclusion and fail to turn out.
</P>
<P>
   There are many nicer places to be on a cold winter's night than
the local American Legion post, arguing about politics. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Just 12 years ago, a certain U.S. senator by the
name of Al Gore dismissed the presidential selection process that
takes place in the Midwestern state of Iowa this evening (Monday)
as ``an arcane procedure that produces crazy results.''
</P>
<P>
   It was, he said of the small local gatherings known as the Iowa
caucuses, ``a ridiculous test'' and he ignored the whole charade,
proceeding directly to what he then regarded as the more sane and
sensible primary election in the Northeastern state of New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Today, it need hardly be said, Gore has rethought his view of
the Iowa caucuses, the first formal leg of the four-yearly race for
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Now vice-president of the United States and favorite for the
Democratic Party's nomination, Gore has the might of the party
machine behind him and claims to have learned his lesson: ``You
gotta come here and campaign here, you gotta work hard here,'' he
says in the Southern demotic he adopts when he wants to present
himself as a man of the people.
</P>
<P>
   Lavishing time, money and attention on this small, sparsely
populated state may indeed be the way to win in Iowa, and in New
Hampshire, too, and everywhere else. But whether Iowa and New
Hampshire are the most appropriate places for Americans to start
choosing their president is quite another matter.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was surely right the first time: it is ``ridiculous'' that
these two states get to vote for the party nominees before anywhere
else, and so set the tone for what is to come.
</P>
<P>
   As Gore's original comments showed, there have long been
misgivings about the preeminence of these two states in the
selection process, largely because they are so untypical of the
United States as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   They are smaller, wealthier, more rural and more white _ much
more white _ than most other states. Yet no candidate wants to
attack their preeminence while he needs their votes.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa and New Hampshire, of course, have a host of well-rehearsed
arguments for keeping the system exactly as it is, which range from
the conservative _ ``We've always done it this way and it works'' _
to the patronizing: ``Our voters are especially well informed and
take their responsibilities especially seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   A more down to earth justification would be that these two early
rounds have not had much bearing on the final choice: crisscrossing
Iowa and New Hampshire is more a rehearsal for the election proper,
a test of stamina and political resilience that weeds out the
no-hopers, allowing the rest to proceed to the later rounds.
</P>
<P>
   A candidate who wins in Iowa, in fact, has almost never emerged
at the end of the primary process with his party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does every Iowan or New Hampshirite accept that their states
are untypical. Neither state is nearly as rural as it used to be;
many thousands of people have moved from the land to the cities and
work in the new tech or service sectors.
</P>
<P>
   Immigrants from Mexico and former Yugoslavia have moved in to
Iowa to work in the giant meat packing plants (otherwise known as
slaughter houses); drugs, crime and racial tensions have
proliferated in a state unaccustomed to such problems.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire, too, claims to be ``typical'' in the decline of
manufacturing jobs, the boom generated by the high-tech sector, the
widening gap between rich and poor and the competition for land
between development and conservation.
</P>
<P>
   Such arguments, though, stretch the point. The fact is that for
all the changes they have experienced in the past 12 years, these
states may be demographically even less representative of the
country than they were.
</P>
<P>
   Both have lost population in that time, while the Southern
states have gained. The proportion of nonwhites, especially
Hispanics, in the population as a whole has increased, while these
states have remained more than 95 percent white.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, they are conservative. What is more, the election
timetable has evolved in such a way as to boost the influence of
the early primary states, for this year at least.
</P>
<P>
   Many states advanced their primaries this year, compressing the
main part of the season into just a few weeks. By March 15, 28
states will have chosen their nominee, including those like
California, New York, New Jersey and Texas, with large numbers of
delegates to the nominating conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa brought its caucuses forward by three weeks, and New
Hampshire followed suit. The result is that _ despite intensive
campaigning by the candidates _ voters have hardly woken up to the
idea that an election campaign is in progress, and the compression
of the season means that there is less time for a lesser known
candidate to become more widely recognized or for a candidate
disappointed in an early primary to regroup and recover.
</P>
<P>
   It is entirely possible that if and when the voters do wake up _
to find that the nominations have been decided almost without them
_ they will call foul and force a change in the timetable in four
years' time.
</P>
<P>
   For this year, though, Iowa and New Hampshire are dictating both
the pace and the issues of the campaign, and they are the concerns
of farmers, pensioners and the relatively well off.
</P>
<P>
   While other issues _ those of urban poverty, race and trade _
will undoubtedly make themselves heard in the weeks to come, the
contest could be effectively over by then.
</P>
<P>
   Nor will any other state attract the same attention or money
from would be presidential nominees as Iowa and New Hampshire. This
year there is simply no time.
</P>
<P>
   If a shorter primary season leaves more time for the
presidential campaign proper, then perhaps some will deem that not
much has been lost.
</P>
<P>
   But as Iowans prepare for their caucuses, the impression is of a
contest that was over almost before it began, where the party
establishments dictated the terms and where a gifted outsider _
like President Bill Clinton _ would have had neither the time nor
the geographical space to present his case to the people. &QL;

rounds have not had much bearing on the final choice: crisscrossing
Iowa and New Hampshire is more a rehearsal for the election proper,
a test of stamina and political resilience that weeds out the
no-hopers, allowing the rest to proceed to the later rounds.
</P>
<P>
   A candidate who wins in Iowa, in fact, has almost never emerged
at the end of the primary process with his party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does every Iowan or New Hampshirite accept that their states
are untypical. Neither state is nearly as rural as it used to be;
many thousands of people have moved from the land to the cities and
work in the new tech or service sectors.
</P>
<P>
   Immigrants from Mexico and former Yugoslavia have moved in to
Iowa to work in the giant meat packing plants (otherwise known as
slaughter houses); drugs, crime and racial tensions have
proliferated in a state unaccustomed to such problems.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire, too, claims to be ``typical'' in the decline of
manufacturing jobs, the boom generated by the high-tech sector, the
widening gap between rich and poor and the competition for land
between development and conservation.
</P>
<P>
   Such arguments, though, stretch the point. The fact is that for
all the changes they have experienced in the past 12 years, these
states may be demographically even less representative of the
country than they were.
</P>
<P>
   Both have lost population in that time, while the Southern
states have gained. The proportion of nonwhites, especially
Hispanics, in the population as a whole has increased, while these
states have remained more than 95 percent white.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, they are conservative. What is more, the election
timetable has evolved in such a way as to boost the influence of
the early primary states, for this year at least.
</P>
<P>
   Many states advanced their primaries this year, compressing the
main part of the season into just a few weeks. By March 15, 28
states will have chosen their nominee, including those like
California, New York, New Jersey and Texas, with large numbers of
delegates to the nominating conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa brought its caucuses forward by three weeks, and New
Hampshire followed suit. The result is that _ despite intensive
campaigning by the candidates _ voters have hardly woken up to the
idea that an election campaign is in progress, and the compression
of the season means that there is less time for a lesser known
candidate to become more widely recognized or for a candidate
disappointed in an early primary to regroup and recover.
</P>
<P>
   It is entirely possible that if and when the voters do wake up _
to find that the nominations have been decided almost without them
_ they will call foul and force a change in the timetable in four
years' time.
</P>
<P>
   For this year, though, Iowa and New Hampshire are dictating both
the pace and the issues of the campaign, and they are the concerns
of farmers, pensioners and the relatively well off.
</P>
<P>
   While other issues _ those of urban poverty, race and trade _
will undoubtedly make themselves heard in the weeks to come, the
contest could be effectively over by then.
</P>
<P>
   Nor will any other state attract the same attention or money
from would be presidential nominees as Iowa and New Hampshire. This
year there is simply no time.
</P>
<P>
   If a shorter primary season leaves more time for the
presidential campaign proper, then perhaps some will deem that not
much has been lost.
</P>
<P>
   But as Iowans prepare for their caucuses, the impression is of a
contest that was over almost before it began, where the party
establishments dictated the terms and where a gifted outsider _
like President Bill Clinton _ would have had neither the time nor
the geographical space to present his case to the people. &QL;

THE REAL COST OF AN HMO CURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALAN SAGER AND DEBORAH SOCOLAR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Harvard Pilgrim Health Care's distress is the latest and loudest
warning yet that health insurance and care in Massachusetts are in
crisis. While serious, the problems can be addressed _ but not
without a direct dollar cost today to all who work or do business
here, a fact easily ignored in the current debate.
</P>
<P>
   The question is: Which pocket will we pay from? If Harvard
Pilgrim Health Care sells itself to a for-profit insurer, consumers
will bear even higher premium costs. If it defaults, doctors,
hospitals, and Wall Street all raise the prices they charge us. If
state-subsidized private loans rescue it, we pay higher premiums
and possibly higher taxes.
</P>
<P>
   None of these three options is ideal. But something must be
done; our health maintenance organizations and hospitals are too
big and too important to let fail.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge is to help Harvard Pilgrim address its short-term
revenue problem, and its middle-term management problem, without
worsening patients' long-term cost and coverage problems. The
further challenge is to do so in a way that builds a foundation for
improving the system.
</P>
<P>
   The first option, a takeover by a for-profit insurer, would cost
the most, both in dollars and in compromised care. Finding the
extra money required to pay stockholders would mean raising
premiums even faster than they are go
</P>
<P>
   ing up now _ the equivalent of spraying gasoline on a fire. And
doctors would have to squeeze care to pump profits through the
money pipeline to Hartford or Minneapolis. Quality would suffer.
</P>
<P>
   Relying on a for-profit takeover allows state government to wash
its hands of a problem that its inaction helped create, freeing it
to repeat its mistakes, rather than learn from them.
</P>
<P>
   The second option, default, would destabilize many hospitals and
doctors. It would prompt Wall Street to raise the cost of much
capital loaned in Massachusetts _ a cost that would quickly be
passed on to consumers. This at a time when Massachusetts health
care costs are already stratospheric.
</P>
<P>
   At $6,100 per person this year, Massachusetts has the world's
costliest care _ more than 30 percent above the US average.
Statewide health spending this year will reach $38 billion, almost
double the total state budget.
</P>
<P>
   And the cost was headed sharply up even before the Harvard
Pilgrim crisis. Annual 8 to 15 percent premium increases will total
perhaps 25 to 40 percent over the next three or four years. This
would force many employers and workers to drop health insurance,
leaving hundreds of thousands more people without coverage here,
even before the next recession.
</P>
<P>
   The third option, a state-supported bailout, means that
taxpayers face some risks. As undesirable as this is to many, it is
preferable to the other two options.
</P>
<P>
   State grants should not be needed; a state-supported loan
guarantee for Harvard Pilgrim's short-term financing should
suffice. While it would impose a small dollar risk on taxpayers, it
would probably amount to the most modest cost increases for health
care consumers, and best move us toward durably affordable care.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, unless state government faces some financial exposure,
however small, it will not have reason to protect HMOs from the
cost of their own mistakes in the future. And it won't protect us
from the cost of those mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A workable solution must reflect a thorough understanding of how
we got to where we are.
</P>
<P>
   The HMO, hospital, nursing home, and drug industries blame their
problems on low revenue. Anti-hospital groups blame excess
hospitals and beds. Some economists blame patients for resisting
HMOs' restrictions on care. Anti-government factions blame
regulation.
</P>
<P>
   These explanations are largely untrue. The main problem is high
cost, not inadequate revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Why is Massachusetts health spending so high? In part, it is
because we face legitimately higher costs in such areas as research
and physician training. Mainly, however, it is because our doctors
use more elaborate and costly services than the norm. This reflects
both the teaching hospitals' dominance and a huge number of doctors
_ 64 percent above the national average.
</P>
<P>
   No villains drove Massachusetts hospital spending to 42 percent
above the US average in 1998, while hospitals cut nurses but had to
hire more clerks to collect money owed by HMOs. Costs rose and
quality fell when Massachusetts gambled on price competition,
managed care, and hospital closings to contain costs during the
1990s. All failed.
</P>
<P>
   A decade of intense price competition has not contained cost.
The few HMOs or hospitals competing in each region of the state
often merged or low-balled prices to build regional monopolies.
Powerful hospitals have tried to engineer their survival behind
smokescreens of competition rhetoric, often at the expense of
smaller institutions. Many needed hospitals are in very bad
financial shape because they cost more than we are able to afford.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing close to a free market exists in health care. Many
wealthy hospitals survived, while many efficient and needed
hospitals closed. Costs rose while access deteriorated. Further,
managed care bred strange new layers of private bureaucracy faster
than it contained clinical cost. Our state's share of people
enrolled in HMOs is 79 percent greater than the nation's, but our
health costs exceed the national average by 30 percent, or $9
billion, this year.
</P>
<P>
   To compete by price, HMOs increasingly relied on bribing
hospitals and doctors to withhold care, thus angering and
frightening patients.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How do we get out of the mess highlighted by the Harvard Pilgrim
debacle?
</P>
<P>
   Government-financed care for all would facilitate covering
everyone and controlling costs, reducing administrative and
clinical waste. But that seems unlikely to pass soon. Here is a
nine-step alternative:
</P>
<P>
   First, in exchange for financial security, HMOs and hospitals
must accept careful and sustained public oversight _ including caps
on administrative spending and limits on revenue growth. Both must
accept uniform industry-wide accounting. HMOs must completely and
accurately report monthly on reserves, revenues, and accrued costs.
Instead of relying on mergers and price increases, HMOs should test
new ways to work with their physicians to spend finite dollars
better.
</P>
<P>
   Second, state government must identify the hospitals, beds, and
emergency rooms required to protect the public's health now, and as
baby boomers age. It must also identify hospitals facing financial
distress.
</P>
<P>
   Third, the state should create a new security fund, financed by
a 0.25 percent assessment on all hospitals' revenue, that would
offer emergency aid to distressed but needed hospitals. The state
should also help endangered hospitals with debt refinancing, and
seek receivership authority to stabilize failing but vital
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth, the state must guarantee adequate (but capped) revenue
for all needed hospitals, as long as they are operated efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   Fifth, HMOs, which have failed to win lower prices from drug
producers, should support government negotiation with drug makers
for statewide discounts. Government should also press drug makers
to contribute, in cash or in capsules, prescription drugs for
people who cannot afford even discounted prices. Drug makers can
afford it. Even after financing research, their profit margins are
the highest in the country, 39.4 percent of equity in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Sixth, the role of government and the role of competition in
health care should be reversed. It is futile to continue to use
market competition to contain cost, and government to protect
quality. Instead, let government contain cost and let HMOs,
doctors, and hospitals compete by quality and compassion.
</P>
<P>
   Relying on either competition or government alone is reckless.
Had our Navy relied solely on battleships _ and not also deployed
aircraft carriers _ in the 1930s, the Battle of Midway would have
been only an unopposed Japanese occupation.
</P>
<P>
   Seventh, state government must assure coverage for everyone.
That requires briefly slowing the rise in payments to caregivers.
Less than half of one year's increase in statewide health spending
would buy conventional coverage for all 625,000 people now
uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   Eighth, state government must wake from its 10-year health care
siesta and work with all parties to design and test solutions.
Federal action may come too late for our state. (Critics of
government programs in Canada or England should recognize that
waiting times there for elective surgery reflect economies too weak
to finance care at US levels, not flaws in their health care
systems.)
</P>
<P>
   Ninth, pay doctors fairly, without incentives to give too little
or too much care. Freeing them from financial risk allows them to
think clinically. But we should also hold doctors accountable for
spending our money carefully.
</P>
<P>
   All this will require many years of continuous engagement, not
just occasional postcards, from business, workers, and especially
state government. Without a free market, government's absence makes
anarchy inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   We should begin these changes now, during the fat years of our
state's economy. We already enjoy the dollars and the doctors, the
competence and compassion, to take good care of all who live here.
If we heed the wake-up call from Harvard Pilgrim's crash, we can
avert the crisis in coverage, cost and caregiver survival that
looms before us all.

   DISPATCHES FROM DREAMSVILLE: A storehouse of knowledge
</P>
<P>
   (''Dispatches from Dreamsville'' is an occasional series in
which readers share with Cox Newspapers senior writer Joe Murray
their memories of growing up in small-town America. Back then, or
at least the way we remember it, life was like a dream.)
</P>
<P>
   By C. Merrell Calhoun
</P>
<P>
   Special to Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   A gentle giant in spirit and outlook, that was my father.
</P>
<P>
   He was gentlemanly, gracious, big hearted and soft-spoken, but
oh so strong in mind and body.
</P>
<P>
   He led by example, and I learned from the deft patience of his
teaching and in the reflected glow of his wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   And through his leadership and camaraderie as a father, I
learned the meaning of being a son truly blessed.
</P>
<P>
   My classrooms were his '37 Chevrolet pickup truck, the sales
floor, stockrooms and loading docks of Calhoun's Market in our
hometown of Talbotton, Ga., our churches and meeting halls, and the
shady banks of the area's myriad ponds and streams.
</P>
<P>
   I'll forever treasure the many early mornings of my pre-teen
years when we journeyed together to Columbus in the Chevy pickup
for our regular visits to the city's curb markets, grain mills and
wholesale grocery emporiums.
</P>
<P>
   We were there for the replenishment and expansion of his store's
rich and varied inventories.
</P>
<P>
   The Farmers' Co-Op, located beneath the railroad viaduct, was a
veritable horn of plenty for every imaginable fruit and vegetable.
</P>
<P>
   Across town, the Cosby-Hodges Milling Co. and other bulk
granaries supplied the heavy demand for flour, meal, chicken
``scratch'' and animal foods.
</P>
<P>
   On the town's western border near the shores of the
Chattahoochee River stood the venerable Sol Loeb Co., the region's
mecca for just about every canned food, staple, spice and flavoring
yet produced.
</P>
<P>
   It was there, at those and other adventurous stops, my father
would shrewdly negotiate lower prices or discounts for volume
purchases, and compute the savings in his head.
</P>
<P>
   And it was there that I absorbed his priceless lessons in
frugality and economics that have stayed with me throughout my
life.
</P>
<P>
   Our solitary truck rides _ indeed, joy rides _ to and from these
Columbus vendors lent added hours of quality time for a seemingly
endless stream of questions and answers on every subject. You might
call it ``home-schooling on wheels.''
</P>
<P>
   In moments like these, Father's zany, off-the-wall sense of
humor would also surface.
</P>
<P>
   While some folks today might call it corny, I remembered it as
breakthrough comedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are your feet smelling and your nose running?'' he might ask.
``Or are your feet running and your nose smelling?''
</P>
<P>
   The unforgettable jokes and stories, intermingled with more
serious dialogue, became the glue of permanent bonding.
</P>
<P>
   Once back at the store in Talbotton, it was always a thrill to
help with the off-loading of the merchandise ... then to unpack it,
price-mark it, put it on display in the bins and shelves ... and
finally to pitch its purchase to the incoming customers and deliver
it by bike to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   It was a sort of start-up course in Distributive Education, as
it were, carefully monitored by the master teacher himself.

   Like pioneers on the plains, species that are threatened or
endangered have long been thought to take a circle-the-wagons
approach. That is, a population headed toward extinction responds
by contracting inward, reducing its range to a central core. Those
left on the periphery, in less favorable habitats, are thought to
have less chance to survive.
</P>
<P>
   But a new study of 245 endangered or recently extinct species
around the world, everything from giant pandas to tiny mollusks,
shows that this idea does not necessarily hold. And the finding has
major implications for conservation biology.
</P>
<P>
   The study, by researchers from Kansas and Oklahoma and reported
in the journal Nature, compared present-day distribution of the
species with their historical ranges. About two-thirds of the
species had greater than expected portions of their populations on
the periphery. And 91 species had all of their population on the
periphery; only 5 had all in the core.
</P>
<P>
   Not unexpectedly, the researchers point to humans as the major
reason for this. Habitat destruction and pollution, among other
things, can overwhelm the natural tendency of a population to
contract inward. The creatures that survive are those on the edge,
at high elevations or otherwise isolated in pockets.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the study may cause some conservation biologists
to reconsider where they focus their efforts. The researchers note
that peripheral areas used to be known as the ``land of the living
dead,'' but now they may be viewed as the places to keep species
alive. &QL;

   Muhammad Ali aside, some butterflies do not really float. M.
heliconiaria, for instance, a nocturnal Central American butterfly,
dives, sputters, darts and swoops, all to avoid becoming a bat's
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Just how it figures out the location of the bat is the subject
of a study reported in Nature by two Canadian scientists. And the
result is surprising: M. heliconiaria is the only known butterfly
that has ultrasonic hearing. It picks up a bat's echolocation
signals and maneuvers quickly out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists studied live specimens of the butterflies and
discovered that they have tiny ears that move with the wings. When
the butterflies were exposed to ultrasound, they responded by
climbing steeply, spiraling and otherwise swooping around, in no
predictable fashion. The researchers note that this maneuverability
is of selective advantage in a dogfight with a bat.
</P>
<P>
   Most butterflies, of course, seldom get in such dogfights. Most
are diurnal, active during the day, when bats are back in the
belfry. In fact, the researchers say, fossil evidence suggests that
it was intense pressure from bats that aided most butterflies'
evolution as daytime creatures about 50 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
   For a butterfly without ultrasonic hearing, being active during
the day offered an evolutionary advantage, allowing it to avoid
bats and float to its heart's content. &QL;

   Astronomers with the Southwest Research Institute may be
forgiven if they seem to have developed a certain Chuck Yeager-like
swagger lately. A program that puts astronomers in the back seat of
high performance military-type jets is now operational.
</P>
<P>
   The program is designed to collect data about planets or
asteroids during occultations, or the passing of one of these
bodies in front of a star. Using a plane enables astronomers to
observe more of these events and also practically eliminates the
possibility that cloud cover will spoil the viewing.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers have made airborne observations for years, of
course, but mostly from larger or slower aircraft. The Southwest
Research Institute program uses two NASA jets, a high-altitude
weather plane and a modified F-18.
</P>
<P>
   Although they do not actually fly the planes, the astronomers
have had to go through some flight training, including learning how
to eject.

&HT;     CLINTONS AREN'T THE ONLY COMMUTER COUPLE

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Gary McLouth, a college professor and the at-home
spouse in a commuter marriage, wasn't prepared for the fallout from
the job his wife, a lawyer, took in New York City eight months ago.
</P>
<P>
   McLouth was suddenly alone in a rambling old colonial house in
near Albany with Sam, his wife's cat, a feline both distressed and
spiteful about the new arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cat was really mad at me for what was going on, and the
cat was throwing up, and I had the cat in a box, carrying it around
this big house,'' McLouth said. His wife's once-lush houseplants
began withering on the vine, too, under McLouth's amateur care.
</P>
<P>
   The cat and the plants weren't the only ones suffering.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very depressed about commuting,'' said his wife,
Providence Baker. ``I'm tired, stressed and unhappy about being
away from home.''
</P>
<P>
   Since last May, Baker has commuted to lower Manhattan, where she
works as deputy counsel for New York state Division of Housing and
Community Renewal.
</P>
<P>
   Baker got caught in what she called a political battle and was
fired last spring after 18 years in the state attorney general's
office, where she managed the tort unit. Baker took the New York
City job because she couldn't find anything locally at the same
level of responsibility or salary.
</P>
<P>
   McLouth and Baker said the grind of the commute and spending
weekdays apart has strained their 12-year marriage and caused them
to become uncharacteristically sullen and snappish with each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither of us expected it to be this difficult,'' Baker said.
``We've changed in ways we don't like. We're both unhappy and
generally frustrated.''
</P>
<P>
   They are not alone.
</P>
<P>
   The trials and tribulations of commuter marriages are being
revisited and re-examined these days, with the eyes of the world on
the arrangement of Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton and open
speculation on the state of the first couple's union.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Hillary Clinton _ the putative U.S. Senate
candidate who needed to establish New York residency _ moved into a
$1.7 million Dutch colonial at 15 Old House Lane in Chappaqua,
Westchester County. For now, the President Clinton's permanent
address is 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons' commuter marriage is the talk of the therapist
community, and the tongue-wagging is not positive, according to
Maureen Sullivan, a clinical social worker with a private therapy
practice in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Hillary moved into the house and they started living
separately, it raised all kinds of red flags for me,'' Sullivan
said. ``I think the Clintons are still avoiding dealing with the
real intimacy and betrayal issues they have as a couple, and living
apart doesn't begin to heal a deeply wounded marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan believes commuter marriages can survive and even grow
stronger despite a long-distance relationship. ``It takes a solid
and established marriage that has a high degree of trust built into
it to make a commuter marriage work,'' said Sullivan, who is
currently counseling a couple struggling with issues that have
arisen from commuting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The marriage has to be the priority and not the job,''
Sullivan said. ``Marriage is always hard work, and a commuter
marriage is even harder.''
</P>
<P>
   For 11 years, Kathy Doolittle, a bank administrator, flew
between her home in Schodack in eastern New York and her job in
Buffalo. Her husband, Larry, a lawyer, stayed behind to raise a
niece the couple takes care of and to tend to domestic duties.
</P>
<P>
   Doolittle's weekly Friday return from Buffalo sent a ripple of
fear through the house: ``Clean up. The wicked witch of the West is
coming home,'' her niece and husband joked.
</P>
<P>
   The Doolittles _ she's now a banking consultant and her husband
is retired _ haven't had to juggle the commuter arrangement since
1992. Not that she loathed everything about the experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``The job was invigorating to me professionally,'' said
Doolittle, whose 25-year marriage survived the weekly shuffle.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't like the hermit-like existence she had, though. ``I
stayed in a hotel for 10 years, and I got tired of living that way,
even room service,'' she said. As a result of being isolated,
Doolittle said she spent 12 hours at the office most days and
brought work back to the hotel. ``There was nothing else to do. It
made me a lot more introverted,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Financially, though, the sacrifice paid off. The couple _ who
are middle-aged and do not have children of their own _ recently
sold their Schodack home of 25 years and are moving to a
condominium in Florida. They also have a weekend place in Rhode
Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we were lucky in that we both adjusted well to living
independently,'' Doolittle said. ``I wouldn't do a commute like
that at this stage of my life, although it made sense at the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Staying flexible and taking it one month at a time has worked
for Betsy Lopez-Abrams and her husband, Andy Viglucci, who has
commuted for the past five years between Albany and his job in
Puerto Rico as editor of the San Juan Star newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty damn routine now, and we take plane delays and the
rest of it as it comes,'' Viglucci said.
</P>
<P>
   For two years, Viglucci was based in San Juan and his wife
stayed at their Albany row house, raising their daughter, Cara, now
a junior at Princeton University. Periodically, he would fly home
or she would fly to San Juan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just adapted to it. I never felt like it was a big
strain,'' said his wife, a former newspaper reporter and editor in
Puerto Rico, where she grew up and where the couple raised their
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't plan their commuter marriage. In 1993, Viglucci
retired from newspaper work and they relocated to Albany (where
Viglucci has roots). He only came out of retirement because the
editorship package was too good to refuse _ airline food
notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   For the past three years, Viglucci has restructured his job in a
way that gives him the best of both worlds. He works in San Juan
one week each month and then works from Albany by phone, fax and
e-mail the other three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not typical, but it works for us,'' said Lopez-Abrams,
who has been married to Viglucci for 20 years. ``My women friends
kept asking me how I could stand Andy commuting. I told them I'm
doing what I please and I don't have to cook every day.''

</P>
<P>
   The logistics can be daunting in maintaining residences and jobs
in two different locales.
</P>
<P>
   Baker, the attorney, tried renting an apartment in
Hastings-on-Hudson in Westchester County.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it was $1,500 a month in rent and that was crazy for two
or three nights a week,'' Baker said. ``I tried to decorate the
apartment and make it feel homey, but I was miserable there
alone.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past few months, Baker has been staying with friends at
their Manhattan apartment. ``My friends insist I'm not imposing,
but I don't know how long I can stay with them,'' Baker said. For
now, she leaves Schodack at 5 a.m. Mondays and commutes to
Manhattan by train. She reverses the routine on Thursday nights. A
four-day workweek was part of the job package.
</P>
<P>
   Although she worked late most nights in Albany, and her husband,
an associate professor of communications at the College of Saint
Rose, sometimes taught night classes, Baker missed cooking
late-night meals for the two of them in her big kitchen. And going
out to restaurants with her husband or getting together with their
friends. (The middle-aged couple has three grown children.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The simple, day-to-day things we enjoyed as a couple are gone,
and I really miss it,'' Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   On the home front, McLouth has had to face the harsh revelation
that his wife carried the load domestically. ``Prov (Providence)
was the decorator, the cook, the creative force around the house,''
McLouth said. ``I'm lucky if I can keep the cat alive and not kill
any more plants. Then there's the house budget, the car repairs,
the dry cleaning, all the consumer middle-class stuff that doesn't
get advertised. But I'm stressed about it.''
</P>
<P>
   McLouth's work on a novel hasn't progressed, either. ``I thought
this extra time alone would help my writing, but it's done the
opposite. I can't concentrate and I'm unhappy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan, the therapist, saw that ache of absence between the
couple as a good sign. ``If you have a good marriage, you're going
to miss your partner,'' Sullivan said. ``And good marriages can
survive a commuting relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan, a mother of two, who has been married for 17 years,
may be facing the commuting conundrum herself one day.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband is interested in moving down South,'' Sullivan
said. ``I can't imagine it working, with him down there and me
staying here. Neither of us would be happy with that.''

   LONDON _ A controversial historical writer who denies as a ``big
lie'' that Jews were slaughtered in gas chambers at Auschwitz
admitted in court Monday that the study upon which he originally
based his contention was substantially flawed.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, David Irving said he still believes that no Jews
were gassed at Auschwitz because he is unimpressed with evidence
supporting the traditional account.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are entitled to at least one unambiguous, not
read-between-the-lines, document that would give us a clear smoking
gun,'' Irving testified Monday. ``That document does not exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Irving is suing Emory University professor Deborah Lipstadt and
her publisher Penguin Books for libel over assertions made about
him in her 1994 book, ``Denying the Holocaust: The Growing Assault
on Truth and Memory.''
</P>
<P>
   Lipstadt portrayed Irving, 62, as a prominent and dangerous
``Holocaust denier,'' who believes the systematic murder of 6
million Jews by the Nazis during World War II never took place. She
also depicts him as an extremist who manipulates, distorts and
falsifies history for his own purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Lipstadt's attorneys are trying to prove that Irving either has
lied or ignored evidence available to him when he has denounced
accepted accounts of the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the overwhelming body of documents, physical
evidence and eyewitness accounts of the mass killings at the
infamous Nazi concentration camp, Irving said he could not accept
the accepted conclusion that the Nazis systemically killed as many
as 2 million Jews in gas chambers at the camp and then burned their
bodies in specially built furnaces.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I don't agree with this,'' Irving said. ``There are other
arguments that are just as plausible.''
</P>
<P>
   Irving, who has never visited Auschwitz, said it was more likely
that the structures identified as gas chambers were used as
air-raid shelters or as places to administer poison gas to corpses
to kill typhus-carrying fleas and lice.
</P>
<P>
   Irving bases his assertions about Auschwitz on a 1998 report by
Fred Leuchter, an American with expertise in execution facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Leuchter concluded that the residual traces of hydrogen cyanide
_ the killing agent in the Zyklon B pellets used by the Nazis _ in
the buildings identified as chambers were too low to support the
contention that people were put to death inside. He also noted that
hydrogen cyanide levels were much higher in the nearby de-lousing
chambers.
</P>
<P>
   Leuchter studied Auschwitz to provide evidence in a Canadian
court case of a man accused of publishing material that denied the
existence of gas chambers at Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
   The judge in the Canadian case disallowed the report because he
ruled the Leuchter lacked the necessary qualifications.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Richard Rampton, who is representing Lipstadt
and Penguin, dismissed the Leuchter report as ``bunk.''
</P>
<P>
   Rampton argued that it would be expected that residual levels of
hydrogen cyanide in the gas chambers would be lower than in
de-lousing rooms because it takes 22 times more cyanide to kill
lice than it does to kill people.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent analyses of the Leuchter report have attacked the
study's methodology as well as its conclusions, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Rampton said that Irving has persisted in basing his
assertions on the Leuchter report, even though the historian knows
it is faulty.
</P>
<P>
   In speeches, press conferences and other public statements,
Irving has portrayed the study as conclusively discrediting the
existence of gas chambers at Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
   ``You say publicly what you know to be untrue about the Leuchter
report,'' Rampton said.
</P>
<P>
   Irving acknowledged that the report was seriously flawed, but he
said he still believes that its findings about the poison residue
was an important breakthrough. ``I accept that the Leuchter report
was flawed, but its findings have been replicated,'' he said.
``It's been superceded.''
</P>
<P>
   The trial, which is expected to last until March, will continue
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a new study shows that claims attacking the Holocaust
have reached a widespread audience but have so far failed to
convince many people.
</P>
<P>
   The American Jewish Committee on Monday released a survey of 11
countries during a Holocaust education conference in Stockholm this
week.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that interpretations of World War II events
varied from country to country but few people denied the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent survey, conducted in Sweden in December, found
that 86 percent of 1,000 people had heard these claims but only 1
percent believed it possible the mass slaughter of Jews during
World War II never happened.
</P>
<P>
   The surveys, which began in 1992, found that 70 percent of
Australians, 67 percent of the French, about 60 percent of Germans
and Austrians, and about 50 percent of Britons and Americans had
heard about Holocaust denial.
</P>
<P>
   The highest proportion of people who said it seemed possible the
Nazi extermination of 6 million Jews never happened was in East
Germany, with one out of every 10 believing this.
</P>
<P>
   Seven percent of Britons and Austrians, 5 percent of French, 4
percent of Australians, 2 percent of Russians and 1 percent of
Americans and Poles said it was possible the Holocaust did not
happen.

 &HT;    SURVEY: MEN RELAX, WOMEN WORK OUTSIDE OF SCHOOL
 &HT;    (400&AMP;add)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After the formal workday ends, many women keep
working and many men veg out.
</P>
<P>
   That Dagwood-and-Blondie pattern emerges as early as the senior
year of high school, according to a survey published Monday by
researchers at the University of California at Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, UCLA researchers asked 364,546 freshmen at 462
four-year and two-year American colleges and universities to fill
out questionnaires about their activities _ beyond school and a
paid job _ during their senior year of high school.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers examined 261,217 responses selected as a
balanced sample that mirrors all of the 1.6 million seniors who
entered college last year.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The boys were 15 times as likely as the girls to report
spending six hours or more a week playing video games.
</P>
<P>
   By smaller margins, they also were more likely than girls to
report spending that much time exercising or playing sports,
watching TV and partying.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The girls were twice as likely as the boys to report spending
six hours or more a week on housework and child-care.
</P>
<P>
   By smaller margins, they were also more likely than boys to
report spending that much time studying, taking part in student
clubs or groups, or performing volunteer work.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at some of the problems working women face, you
see the same pattern,'' said Linda J. Sax, who directed the survey
by UCLA's Higher Education Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women tend to multi-task, taking on a lot of different
responsibilities simultaneously all their lives, whether they're
students trying to balance their course work and extracurricular
activities, or career women trying to balance their paid jobs and
responsibilities at home.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, she said, a lot of men seem to spend a lot of
time chilling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be that men are releasing their stress, while women
concentrate on activities that produce stress,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That would help explain another of the findings from the latest
of the annual surveys of college freshmen that UCLA began in 1966:
While 39 percent of this year's first-year women said they felt
overwhelmed ``frequently'' in the past year, that was true of only
20 percent of the first-year men.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA plans to post a free summary, and information on how to
order the full report, on the Internet at
www.gseis.ucla.edu/heri/heri.html.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Activities that college freshmen reported took up six or more
hours a week during their senior year of high school:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Exercising, sports: 42 percent of girls, 59 percent of boys.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Studying: girls, 37 percent; boys, 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Partying: girls, 26 percent; boys, 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Watching TV: girls, 24 percent; boys, 35 percent
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Student clubs, groups: girls, 16 percent; boys, 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Housework, child care: girls, 14 percent; boys, 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Volunteer work: girls, 11 percent; boys, 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Playing video games: girls, 1 percent; boys, 15 percent.

   THAILAND-BURMA (Bangkok, Thailand) _ A handful of Burmese rebels
apparently under the command of 12-year-old twin boys crossed into
Thailand on Monday and took over a hospital, holding as many as 800
patients and staff hostage throughout the day. The black-masked
gunmen, from a splinter group of ethnic Karen rebels that calls
itself God's Army, fired off automatic weapons as they rode a
hijacked blue public bus into the hospital compound in the Thai
border town of Ratchaburi, 75 miles west of here. By Seth Mydans.

   SCOTUS-FUNDRAISING (Washington) _ Ruling in a Missouri campaign
finance case with important national implications, the Supreme
Court on Monday decisively upheld limits on campaign contributions
and rejected the argument that inflation has rendered
unconstitutionally low the $1,000 limit it upheld 24 years ago. The
6-3 decision left states with considerable latitude either to adopt
the federal limit, still the $1,000 the court upheld in its
much-disputed Buckley vs. Valeo decision, or to experiment with
even lower contribution caps, as a number of states recently have.

   LONDON _ A controversial historical writer who denies as a ``big
lie'' that Jews were slaughtered in gas chambers at Auschwitz
admitted in court Monday that the study upon which he originally
based his contention was substantially flawed.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, David Irving said he still believes that no Jews
were gassed at Auschwitz because he is unimpressed with evidence
supporting the traditional account.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are entitled to at least one unambiguous, not
read-between-the-lines, document that would give us a clear smoking
gun,'' Irving testified Monday. ``That document does not exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Irving is suing Emory University professor Deborah Lipstadt and
her publisher Penguin Books for libel over assertions made about
him in her 1994 book, ``Denying the Holocaust: The Growing Assault
on Truth and Memory.''
</P>
<P>
   Lipstadt portrayed Irving, 62, as a prominent and dangerous
``Holocaust denier,'' who believes the systematic murder of 6
million Jews by the Nazis during World War II never took place. She
also depicts him as an extremist who manipulates, distorts and
falsifies history for his own purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Lipstadt's attorneys are trying to prove that Irving either has
lied or ignored evidence available to him when he has denounced
accepted accounts of the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the overwhelming body of documents, physical
evidence and eyewitness accounts of the mass killings at the
infamous Nazi concentration camp, Irving said he could not accept
the accepted conclusion that the Nazis systemically killed as many
as 2 million Jews in gas chambers at the camp and then burned their
bodies in specially built furnaces.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I don't agree with this,'' Irving said. ``There are other
arguments that are just as plausible.''
</P>
<P>
   Irving, who has never visited Auschwitz, said it was more likely
that the structures identified as gas chambers were used as
air-raid shelters or as places to administer poison gas to corpses
to kill typhus-carrying fleas and lice.
</P>
<P>
   Irving bases his assertions about Auschwitz on a 1998 report by
Fred Leuchter, an American with expertise in execution facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Leuchter concluded that the residual traces of hydrogen cyanide
_ the killing agent in the Zyklon B pellets used by the Nazis _ in
the buildings identified as chambers were too low to support the
contention that people were put to death inside. He also noted that
hydrogen cyanide levels were much higher in the nearby de-lousing
chambers.
</P>
<P>
   Leuchter studied Auschwitz to provide evidence in a Canadian
court case of a man accused of publishing material that denied the
existence of gas chambers at Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
   The judge in the Canadian case disallowed the report because he
ruled the Leuchter lacked the necessary qualifications.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Richard Rampton, who is representing Lipstadt
and Penguin, dismissed the Leuchter report as ``bunk.''
</P>
<P>
   Rampton argued that it would be expected that residual levels of
hydrogen cyanide in the gas chambers would be lower than in
de-lousing rooms because it takes 22 times more cyanide to kill
lice than it does to kill people.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent analyses of the Leuchter report have attacked the
study's methodology as well as its conclusions, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Rampton said that Irving has persisted in basing his
assertions on the Leuchter report, even though the historian knows
it is faulty.
</P>
<P>
   In speeches, press conferences and other public statements,
Irving has portrayed the study as conclusively discrediting the
existence of gas chambers at Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
   ``You say publicly what you know to be untrue about the Leuchter
report,'' Rampton said.
</P>
<P>
   Irving acknowledged that the report was seriously flawed, but he
said he still believes that its findings about the poison residue
was an important breakthrough. ``I accept that the Leuchter report
was flawed, but its findings have been replicated,'' he said.
``It's been superceded.''
</P>
<P>
   The trial, which is expected to last until March, will continue
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a new study shows that claims attacking the Holocaust
have reached a widespread audience but have so far failed to
convince many people.
</P>
<P>
   The American Jewish Committee on Monday released a survey of 11
countries during a Holocaust education conference in Stockholm this
week.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that interpretations of World War II events
varied from country to country but few people denied the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent survey, conducted in Sweden in December, found
that 86 percent of 1,000 people had heard these claims but only 1
percent believed it possible the mass slaughter of Jews during
World War II never happened.
</P>
<P>
   The surveys, which began in 1992, found that 70 percent of
Australians, 67 percent of the French, about 60 percent of Germans
and Austrians, and about 50 percent of Britons and Americans had
heard about Holocaust denial.
</P>
<P>
   The highest proportion of people who said it seemed possible the
Nazi extermination of 6 million Jews never happened was in East
Germany, with one out of every 10 believing this.
</P>
<P>
   Seven percent of Britons and Austrians, 5 percent of French, 4
percent of Australians, 2 percent of Russians and 1 percent of
Americans and Poles said it was possible the Holocaust did not
happen.

 &HT;    SURVEY: MEN RELAX, WOMEN WORK OUTSIDE OF SCHOOL

   WASHINGTON _ After the formal workday ends, many women keep
working and many men veg out.
</P>
<P>
   That Dagwood-and-Blondie pattern emerges as early as the senior
year of high school, according to a survey published Monday by
researchers at the University of California at Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, UCLA researchers asked 364,546 freshmen at 462
four-year and two-year American colleges and universities to fill
out questionnaires about their activities _ beyond school and a
paid job _ during their senior year of high school.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers examined 261,217 responses selected as a
balanced sample that mirrors all of the 1.6 million seniors who
entered college last year.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The boys were 15 times as likely as the girls to report
spending six hours or more a week playing video games.
</P>
<P>
   By smaller margins, they also were more likely than girls to
report spending that much time exercising or playing sports,
watching TV and partying.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The girls were twice as likely as the boys to report spending
six hours or more a week on housework and child-care.
</P>
<P>
   By smaller margins, they were also more likely than boys to
report spending that much time studying, taking part in student
clubs or groups, or performing volunteer work.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at some of the problems working women face, you
see the same pattern,'' said Linda J. Sax, who directed the survey
by UCLA's Higher Education Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women tend to multi-task, taking on a lot of different
responsibilities simultaneously all their lives, whether they're
students trying to balance their course work and extracurricular
activities, or career women trying to balance their paid jobs and
responsibilities at home.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, she said, a lot of men seem to spend a lot of
time chilling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be that men are releasing their stress, while women
concentrate on activities that produce stress,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That would help explain another of the findings from the latest
of the annual surveys of college freshmen that UCLA began in 1966:
While 39 percent of this year's first-year women said they felt
overwhelmed ``frequently'' in the past year, that was true of only
20 percent of the first-year men.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA plans to post a free summary, and information on how to
order the full report, on the Internet at
www.gseis.ucla.edu/heri/heri.html.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Activities that college freshmen reported took up six or more
hours a week during their senior year of high school:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Exercising, sports: 42 percent of girls, 59 percent of boys.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Studying: girls, 37 percent; boys, 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Partying: girls, 26 percent; boys, 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Watching TV: girls, 24 percent; boys, 35 percent
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Student clubs, groups: girls, 16 percent; boys, 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Housework, child care: girls, 14 percent; boys, 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Volunteer work: girls, 11 percent; boys, 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Playing video games: girls, 1 percent; boys, 15 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
   It is both beauty and beast: a cube-shaped molecule that
chemists regard as beautiful and that may also be the most powerful
nonnuclear explosive ever made.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few grams of this powdery white substance, called
octanitrocubane (ONC), have been synthesized, and it has not been
completely tested to determine its physical and chemical
properties.
</P>
<P>
   But the chemical's creators have high hopes for it. It might one
day become the basis of an ultrapowerful military explosive, a
rocket fuel or drugs effective against some types of cancer. In
laboratory experiments, compounds based on similar cube-shaped
molecules have shown some ability to bind to cancer cells and
destroy them.
</P>
<P>
   It is far from certain that ONC, which is very costly to make,
will find practical uses. But its creation, which was announced in
the current issue of Angewandte Chemie, a leading international
journal of applied chemistry, was hailed as a triumph of chemical
synthesis.
</P>
<P>
   The synthesis, which took nearly 20 years to complete, was
achieved by Dr. Philip E. Eaton, a professor at the University of
Chicago, and his assistant, Dr. Mao-Xi Zhang.
</P>
<P>
   The creation of a tiny pinch of ONC required a long succession
of difficult steps toward a chemical goal inspired by Plato, the
ancient Greek philosopher. Plato taught that existence is dominated
by form, and that the five regular polyhedrons known to
mathematicians _ the 4-sided tetrahedron, the 6-sided cube, the
8-sided octahedron, the 12-sided dodecahedron and the 20-sided
icosahedron _ have symbolic significance. (A regular polyhedron is
a three-dimensional form whose faces are all regular polygons; the
cube, for example, is made up of 6 regular polygons called
squares.)
</P>
<P>
   According to Plato, the tetrahedron represented fire, the cube
symbolized earth, the octahedron stood for air, the icosahedron
represented water, and the dodecahedron symbolized the universe.
</P>
<P>
   To a few chemists, the platonic solids, as these five forms are
called, posed an intriguing challenge: Would it be possible to
create molecules modeled on the platonic solids, using a carbon
atom to define each corner?
</P>
<P>
   Carbon atoms can be made to join with one another or with
different atoms in any number of ways; some 18 million distinct
chemical compounds, most of them containing carbon atoms, have been
identified.
</P>
<P>
   But there are some arrangements that are difficult or impossible
to construct. In a string of carbon atoms, adjacent atoms tend to
link together forming angles of 109.5 degrees. If that angle is
forcibly changed to squeeze carbon atoms into some desired pattern,
the electronic bond between the atoms may be strained, and the
electronic linkages between atoms may be impeded or blocked
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Some molecules based on the platonic solids are thus ruled out.
For example, it is probably impossible to synthesize tetrahedrane,
a carbon-based molecule with four faces. Since each face would be
an equilateral triangle, each corner atom would make a bonding
angle with the other three corner atoms of 60 degrees, an angle far
smaller than the 109.5 degrees carbon bonds prefer.
</P>
<P>
   Cubane, a cube-shaped molecule with a carbon atom at each of its
eight corners (and a hydrogen atom attached to each carbon), was
also thought to be too difficult to synthesize, because the bonding
angle of 90 degrees between any three adjacent carbon atoms in its
structure would be too strained.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1964, Eaton achieved the seemingly impossible synthesis
of a small quantity of cubane, a molecular cube of eight carbon
atoms with a hydrogen atom linked to each carbon.
</P>
<P>
   The next challenge was to substitute other atoms for the eight
hydrogen atoms attached to cubane's corners. With financial support
from the Army, which was seeking a more powerful military explosive
than any available, Eaton and his colleagues embarked on a program
aimed at removing the hydrogen atoms attached to a cubane
molecule's corners, and substituting nitro groups in their places.
</P>
<P>
   A nitro group is a molecular fragment consisting of a nitrogen
atom bonded to two oxygen atoms. Many carbon-based compounds
containing nitro groups, TNT and nitroglycerine among them, are
explosives, and it was reasoned that a cubane-based compound
containing as many nitro groups as possible would be an especially
powerful explosive.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling their way a step at a time, Eaton's team eventually
succeeded in replacing four of cubane's eight hydrogen atoms with
nitro groups, thereby creating a compound called tetranitrocubane.
Later, the chemists found a way to substitute six nitro groups for
hydrogen atoms, yielding hexanitrocubane.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, developing increasingly complex synthesis
techniques, the team added yet another nitro group, yielding
heptanitrocubane. At that point, only one nitro group needed to be
added to complete the substitution of nitro groups for hydrogen
atoms at all eight corners of the cubane framework.
</P>
<P>
   Eaton said the final stage was reached by bubbling ozone gas
through an ultracold solution of ingredients that included a
seven-nitro version of cubane (heptanitrocubane). When this witch's
brew turned blue, Eaton knew he had arrived at the goal _
octanitrocubane.
</P>
<P>
   ``After nearly 20 years of chasing ONC,'' he said, ``we've
finally developed the necessary new chemistry to make it, and have
done so. It's a good feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Calculations show, he said in an interview, that ONC is 15
percent to 30 percent more powerful than the most powerful military
explosive now in use: HMX.
</P>
<P>
   Eaton and his associates plan to synthesize a family of many
peculiar molecules related to cubane. ``We hope to expand the
horizons and possibilities of organic chemistry, but it may be slow
going,'' he said. ``Funding agencies these days are much less
interested in the pursuit of fundamental chemistry than in
practical applications. People don't always realize how important
basic scientific research is as the basis for future
applications.''

   When Giving Blood Before Surgery Helps &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many patients preparing for surgery donate their own blood in
the hope of avoiding transfusions from strangers. But a new Mayo
Clinic study has found that the procedure, known as autologous
donation, is generally effective only for people with moderately
low red blood cell counts.
</P>
<P>
   The study, published in this month's edition of the Mayo Clinic
Proceedings, examined 165 patients who had undergone hip
replacement surgery. What the researchers found is that only those
patients whose red blood cell, or hemoglobin, counts fell within a
certain range _ 11.4 to 14.7 grams per deciliter for men, and 13.2
to 14.7 grams per deciliter for women _ managed to lower their risk
of receiving blood bank transfusions.
</P>
<P>
   For those patients, the drop in red blood cell count caused by
the autologous donation triggered the body's mechanism for making
new red blood cells. As a result, they were able to increase their
total blood cell supply by the amount they were expected to lose
during surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Patients with lower levels had trouble generating enough new
cells; patients with more normal levels didn't lose enough when
donating their own blood to trigger the make-more alarm _ in
effect, all they accomplished was shifting some of their blood from
their body to a transfusion bag.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a lot of blood in you, you gain very little from
the procedure,'' the study's lead author, Dr. Gregory A. Nuttall,
said in an interview. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   The main thrust of the research by Dr. Todd Braver and Dr.
Deanna Burch, a husband-and-wife team of psychologists at
Washington University in St. Louis, was establishing the usefulness
of their computer model, which mimics the way information is routed
among different areas of the brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``One advantage of a model is that you can do stuff that you
can't do in humans, like damage the brain,'' said Braver. So after
gathering baseline data on the computer's ability to pick out the
letters ``AX'' from a series of two-letter combinations, the couple
ran the simulation again after altering its equations in a way they
thought would replicate effects of aging on the workings of
dopamine, a brain chemical that carries messages.
</P>
<P>
   The damaged model scored lower in general, but managed to do a
better job of avoiding one particular kind of mistake. The
researchers then put groups of healthy young and old people through
the same paces and got the same result.
</P>
<P>
   The younger people were better able to recognize and respond to
what Braver called ``contextual clues,'' recognizing quickly that
if the first letter was not A, it did not matter what the second
letter was. But when the test began with a lot of ``AX'' sequences,
that same contextual reflex led the younger people to start to
expect all As to be followed by Xs, leading to more mistakes and
lags when the pattern changed. By contrast, Braver said, the older
minds' diminished ability to recognize and remember context led
them to be misled less often. &QL;

   Expert Advice to Bald Men: Get Over It &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Do antibalding treatments work? That depends in part on how
success is defined, according to an article last week in The
Lancet, a medical journal.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Julian H. Barth of the General Infirmary at Leeds in
England, wrote that recent research appears to establish that
finasteride and minoxidil, known more commonly as Propecia and
Rogaine, do help stabilize hair loss and in some cases reverse it.
</P>
<P>
   But when the men in one trial involving Procepia and a placebo
rated the value of the treatment, the response from those who got
the drug were not much more enthusiastic than from those who did
not.
</P>
<P>
   Until one remedy or another offers a clear alternative to hair
loss, Barth wrote, the only sure way of reducing dissatisfaction is
the oldest way: ``Men should be encouraged to come to terms with
their hair loss.'' &QL;

<P>
   Less Risk to Liver From Hepatitis C &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tests performed on blood taken from Air Force servicemen a half
century ago and frozen appear to show that the long-term risk of
liver disease from hepatitis C is lower than has been commonly
feared.
</P>
<P>
   Because hepatitis C is a slowly progressing illness that has
been studied intensely only in recent years, no one is certain just
how much of a risk it poses in otherwise healthy people over the
course of their lives. The question has been especially pressing
because available treatments are expensive and can cause serious
side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers from Georgetown University School of Medicine tested
for hepatitis C in the thawed blood samples that had been taken
from more than 8,000 men as part of streptococcus study at the Fort
Francis E. Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming from 1948 to 1954.
Seventeen of the samples tested positive, a rate similar to that
found among current recruits.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at later medical records, the researchers found that
11.8 percent of those with the disease had liver disease, a figure
that was higher than the 2.4 percent found among the uninfected,
but far lower than indicated by earlier studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``If our data represent an accurate estimate,'' the authors
wrote last week in the Annals of Internal Medicine, ``the current
concern that progression to liver disease is common or inevitable''
may be unfounded. &QL;

   PREVENTION &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That Second Bypass, and How to Avoid It &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Implanting a substance known to slow cell growth into coronary
bypasses could cut down on the rate at which they clog up and need
replacement, British researchers reported Monday in Circulation,
the journal of the American Heart Association.
</P>
<P>
   In bypass operations, a stretch of a healthy vein from elsewhere
in the body is grafted onto a coronary artery to detour blood
around a choked-off passageway. But something about the procedure
often sets off abnormally fast growth of cells within the graft,
leading eventually to a new blockage.
</P>
<P>
   Up to half of all bypasses fail within 10 years, and 20 percent
of bypass operations are now performed to replace failed grafts,
said the study's lead author, Dr. Sarah J. George of the University
of Bristol.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we could find a way to block that abnormal layer from
growing, it could make the grafts last longer,'' Dr. George wrote.
</P>
<P>
   She and her colleagues focused on molecules called matrix
metalloproteinases, which help speed the growth of cells, as when
scar tissue is formed. Earlier studies had found that a substance
called TIMP-3 could block the activity of metalloproteinases and
help destroy cells that formed.
</P>
<P>
   The research team first implanted TIMP-3 cells in graft tissue
in a laboratory culture, and found that it produced 84 percent
fewer cells in two weeks than untreated tissue. Then they implanted
TIMP-3 in graft tissue in live pigs. Those receiving the inhibitor
produced 58 percent fewer new cells over the next 28 days.

&HT;     SCANDAL PUTS PRIZED VERMONT HOCKEY TEAM IN THE HOT SEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By BUZZ GRAY

<P>
   BURLINGTON, Vt. _ When the administration at the University of
Vermont pulled the plug on the men's hockey team Jan. 14, winter
suddenly got colder and darker here.
</P>
<P>
   With one somber proclamation by university President Judith
Ramaley, the magic vanished. Not just in the dorms and study halls
of the 209-year-old institution, but in the shops and stores in the
downtown open-air mall, in the string of fast-food restaurants
along Route 7, and in the service stations that fly the green and
gold banner of Vermont hockey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still shocked. It hasn't really sunk in yet,'' said Todd
Corbett, an attendant at the Mobil Station near the 425-acre campus
overlooking Lake Champlain. ``I'm sure when Friday and Saturday
nights roll around, I'll realize there won't be hockey anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The final 15 games of the Catamounts' season were canceled after
a hazing scandal involving several players. The action came after a
panel of investigators appointed by the university determined that
players had lied to the panel, a finding based on information,
reported to be a videotape, that the university obtained on Jan.
13.
</P>
<P>
   ``First we were criticized for not doing enough,'' Vermont
athletic director Rick Farnham said. ``Now we're being criticized
by some for being too harsh. The message is: Two wrongs never,
never, never make a right.''
</P>
<P>
   The repercussions have been felt throughout the state,
especially in Montpelier, the capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very sad thing for the university hockey program,''
Gov. Howard Dean, a longtime fan, said in a statement after school
officials suspended the season. ``But it's a good thing for
establishing a tenor that hazing will not occur.''
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Nancy Chard, head of the Senate Education Committee,
backed the university's decision. If the school hadn't acted as it
did, she was planning to hold hearings in her committee. That
wouldn't be good for the state university, which relies on the
Legislature for yearly appropriations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is going to reduce the harm that might have come to them if
they had not done this,'' Chard said about the university's
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the Division I hockey programs in the Northeast, maybe
the nation, this would be perhaps the last that anyone would expect
to find embroiled in scandal. Vermont has been a glowing example of
all that is good about college hockey during the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Gutterson Field House, where the Cats play, is not merely a
hockey rink surrounded by 4,000 occupied seats. It's practically a
shrine that bursts to life with the rhythmic beat of the college
band, the dancing mascot, and catchy chants from the student body.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the most uplifting environments you can be in,''
said Margaret Corson, president of Friends of UVM Hockey. ``We hear
it from everybody who comes here to watch a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Gutterson is a gathering spot, a crossroads for generations and
genders. It's the home of the most popular sports team in a state
that has no major-league franchise. There is a 20-year waiting list
for season tickets to Vermont home games.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the biggest show in town,'' said Peter Maher, who
described himself as an avid fan since 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Maher spoke as he walked through the Hall of Honor at Gutterson,
a place decorated with photographs of Vermont's greatest legends,
including current NHL star John LeClair.
</P>
<P>
   There's no place quite like Gutterson. Most of the seats are
stacked high at each end of the field house. Spectators file in
through a narrow passage at one end. Vendors sell home-baked goods,
and senior citizens whistle through their teeth when they don't
like a referee's call.
</P>
<P>
   The Gutterson glitter is gone. The arena sits eerily silent now.
The season has come to an abrupt halt.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think we like this?'' sports information director Gordon
Woodworth said. ``You think we like losing close to $250,000 in
revenue for the remainder of the season? Of course we don't. But
I'll tell you one thing, the action taken here will send a wake-up
call to every campus across the country. If it doesn't, it
should.''

</P>
<P>
   The unraveling of Vermont's season started slowly. In September,
a 19-year-old goalie, a walk-on, was told he could try out for the
team. Corey LaTulippe, who grew up in Williston, just east of
Burlington, didn't figure to have much of a chance of beating three
other goalies on full scholarship, but he was living out a dream.
</P>
<P>
   Then he got caught up in an ugly hazing incident that mushroomed
into a lawsuit and lies and finally the suspension of the remainder
of Vermont's season. While school officials still refuse to divulge
all that they learned in the investigation, citing the federal
Family Educational and Privacy Rights Act, it's known that all nine
freshmen, including LaTulippe, were told to report to a veteran
player's off-campus apartment for an initiation party on Oct. 1.
There, the freshmen were subjected to various forms of humiliation
and degrading acts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that hazing took place, and that some players were
not completely honest about it, are deeply disappointing to me, to
our athletic staff and to our entire university community,'' said
Ramaley, the university president.
</P>
<P>
   It's not like the administration or coaching staff were unaware
of the potential for hazing. That's why a zero-tolerance policy on
hazing is distributed to all student-athletes at the beginning of
the school year. The evidence suggests that the policy was ignored
by some members of the hockey team.
</P>
<P>
   LaTulippe dropped out of school and hired a lawyer, Gail
Westgate. She sent a letter to Ramaley on Oct. 28, in which she
cited specific allegations of misconduct against her client at the
party. The university responded with an internal investigation by a
private law firm but did not disclose the results. It appeared then
that the matter might fade away. But when LaTulippe on Dec. 10
filed a federal civil lawsuit naming the university, Ramaley, coach
Mike Gilligan and three players as defendants. That's when the
flames spread.
</P>
<P>
   The damages sought by LaTulippe were not specified, but The
Associated Press reported that when investigators from the school
sought to interview him, he refused unless he was paid $350,000.
</P>
<P>
   None of the players are talking to the media about the issue
because of the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of disgusting to say the least,'' Alice Furman said
about the details of the hazing. ``I've been a big fan of Vermont
hockey for years. It's hard for me to understand why some players
would act in that way. Are they that uncivilized? What were they
trying to accomplish?''
</P>
<P>
   But Furman, a clerk in a department store at the University Mall
next to campus, is not so turned off that she won't root for the
Cats next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope this (suspension of the season) clears everything
up,'' she said. ``I'd hate to see something like this leave a black
mark on the team forever.''

SCIENTISTS FIND PLUTONIUM HAS AGING PROBLEM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.M.)   (Science Times)  
 (af)  
 By WILLIAM J. BROAD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Russian scientists have discovered that weapons-grade plutonium
is far more unstable in form than previously suspected, a finding
that could have implications for the aging and reliability of
America's arsenal of 10,000 or so nuclear warheads.
</P>
<P>
   American scientists who recently learned of the Russian
discovery say they did so in the course of an exchange program. But
such teamwork has been curtailed by recent espionage fears, which
American scientists fault as exaggerating the risks of cooperation
and ignoring benefits like the plutonium insight.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian disclosure has prompted a number of new American
studies of plutonium storage and aging meant to pinpoint the
potential hazards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're changing our experimental and theoretical approach to
take this information into account,'' Dr. Siegfried S. Hecker, a
leader in Russian cooperation at the Los Alamos National Laboratory
in New Mexico, said in an interview. ``We're doing things today
that we had not planned to do one year ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Edward F. Hammel, a plutonium pioneer at Los Alamos, told a
laboratory forum last month that the Russian insight could shake up
the way nuclear weapons were made, handled, repaired and stored.
</P>
<P>
   ``The implications for the stockpile are immense,'' Hammel said,
adding that the exchange visits with foreign scientists had
produced ``tremendous benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Plutonium is one of the most complex and mysterious elements
known to science. Only minute traces of it exist in nature and most
has been made artificially, first in 1940; so plutonium studies
span little more than half a century.
</P>
<P>
   The silvery element yellows when exposed to the air and is warm
to the touch because of energy released through alpha-particle
decay, a kind of radiation. Its complexity stems in part from its
large number of stable forms, or allotropes. Carbon has three _
diamond, graphite and amorphous.
</P>
<P>
   But plutonium exists in six structural forms, all with differing
densities and volumes, that vary according to temperature. They
range from jumbled crystals typical of minerals to the highly
ordered ones of metals, the latter allotrope being the form used in
weapons. But keeping it in the metallic state can be tricky.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ease with which plutonium transforms itself from one
crystallographic phase to another is exasperating,'' Hecker and Dr.
Joseph C. Martz, his Los Alamos colleague, wrote recently. ``The
resultant phases have such radically different properties.''
</P>
<P>
   Added to such fickleness, plutonium is highly reactive with
other metals and materials, especially oxygen and hydrogen. That
can make it difficult to cast and manipulate.
</P>
<P>
   During the Manhattan Project, scientists at Los Alamos found
that plutonium behaved more reliably if alloyed with elements like
aluminum and gallium. During cooling, these helped the element stay
in its most metallic allotrope, known as delta phase.
</P>
<P>
   Such alloys of plutonium behaved like normal metals, being
relatively plastic, compressible and resistant to corrosion. Most
important for making weapons, they were easy to cast and work into
special shapes because they had little or no brittleness.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, the mandarins of American science assumed that the
delta phase of plutonium alloyed with gallium was rock stable, a
kind of Gibraltar on which the American nuclear arsenal could be
erected and expected to weather centuries of storms and service.
</P>
<P>
   Hints of Russian disagreement first emerged in 1975. While the
Americans held that the delta phase of plutonium mixed with gallium
was in a stable equilibrium at room temperature, the Russians found
that it was poised to decompose to the alpha form, which is more
brittle than ductile. And it is far denser, with a smaller volume,
raising the threat of ruined mechanical assemblies and perhaps
changes in the critical mass needed to start a nuclear chain
reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russian work was not accepted in the West because
insufficient detail was presented about the precise nature of the
experiments,'' Hecker and Martz wrote in a manuscript for a
forthcoming book.
</P>
<P>
   But that changed last year at an international conference in
Oxford, England. The basis for the disclosure, Hecker said, was
years of exchanges after the Cold War between American and Russian
nuclear arms designers, with the contacts becoming increasingly
cordial.
</P>
<P>
   At the meeting, Dr. Lydia T. Timofeeva, a Russian metallurgist,
laid out the experimental basis for the plutonium insight for the
first time, dazzling American scientists with its care and
precision.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Matthew G. McKinzie, a former Los Alamos researcher now at
the Natural Resources Defense Council, a group in Washington that
tracks nuclear arms, said Russia's stockpiles of plutonium were
older and larger than those of the United States, aiding such
studies.
</P>
<P>
   Plutonium instability, he said, could sharply cut the lifetime
of weapon cores, in theory reducing them from perhaps 70 years to
as little as 20 years. Rapid aging, he added, could also mean the
United States would have to begin remanufacturing its nuclear arms
sooner than expected, increasing the effort's scope and cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rate of aging has a tremendous impact on things like the
size of the production facility and its annual throughput,''
McKinzie said.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists at Los Alamos now believe the Russians are right, and
are doing experiments to seek confirmation. Specifically, they are
taking delta phase plutonium and raising its temperature slightly,
and then monitoring it closely for signs of decomposition to the
alpha form.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never would have done this before,'' said Hecker, a former
director of Los Alamos. ``In the Russian view, when you increase
the temperature, you increase the speed at which things may
decompose.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' he added, ``it's up to us to apply that to our
stockpile.''
</P>
<P>
   The repercussions, Hecker said, could affect how plutonium for
warheads is made and stored, perhaps changing things like the
spacing between plutonium cores. ``If you have such a
transformation,'' he said, ``shape changes, and there's distortion,
and you'd have to account for that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't mean it makes it more dangerous,'' Hecker added.
``But you have to think about those kind of things ahead of time.''
</P>
<P>
   The cooperative basis for such insights is under fire in
Washington after Congress last year asserted that Chinese spies had
made off with top American nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   In November, a federal moratorium went into effect that bars new
hiring of scientists at Los Alamos from potentially unfriendly
countries like Russia and China. Foreign exchange programs and
visits are also down, said Hecker, who lamented the trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing what no foreign nation could to do to us,'' he
rued. ``We're crippling ourselves.''

&HT;     WHAT DOES HILLARY WANT? 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARIANNE MEANS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For months, Hillary Clinton's detractors have been
saying that when it came right down to it, she wouldn't have the
courage or the cool to plunge into the nasty political brawl
required to win a Senate seat in New York. They were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   One macho Manhattan columnist even predicted she would lose and
have the bad form to cry. That scribe totally misreads her
tough-minded, competitive nature, which has been amply on display
the past seven years in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever else she is, this woman is no sissy.
</P>
<P>
   However, when a few days ago she finally ended her long tease of
the state's voters by announcing she will formally declare her
candidacy on February 6, doubts about her motivation and character
did not go away.
</P>
<P>
   Now they are taking on a new coloration.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the rap against her is the charge that she isn't
lacking in ambition at all but suffers from too much of it. In this
there are echoes of the familiar tiresome complaints of
traditionalists about troublesome uppity women, but it is fair to
think that applying them to the aggressive first lady is
politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
   New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, her likely GOP Senate
opponent, leads the way with a fund-raising letter that warns
``most political observers believe that Hillary Clinton is merely
using this race as a stepping stone to even higher office.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no evidence for this accusation, but it is not beyond
the realm of possibility. It is easy to imagine that she pants to
succeed her husband to show him who's the better political leader
after enduring the humiliation of his adultery with a pudgy intern
in a beret.
</P>
<P>
   Although this implies Giuliani takes her seriously as a
potential presidential candidate, he's not admiring Hillary's
political wiles. He's out to demonize her in order to arouse
right-wing campaign contributors and conservative activists. If
they think she would be a threat to their causes as a liberal
freshman senator, the thought of her as a future president must
make them apoplectic.
</P>
<P>
   It seems to be working. The Giuliani campaign claims to have
raised $12 million last year, much of it through his direct-mail
anti-Hillary appeal. This is a record amount for an unannounced
non-incumbent a year before an election. He is busily branding her
as a far-left elitist who is ``champion of every left-wing cause
you can imagine.'' If the Cold War wasn't over, he would label her
a pinko as well.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady's fundraising has not been as successful,
reporting only $8 million _ not peanuts, but far less than her
rival. Giuliani, who has his own political weaknesses, is far less
well known nationally and still a rather elusive target for
opposition fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton is trying to compensate for this by making her
accusations in person, calling Giuliani dictatorial and
temperamentally unsuited for the climate of compromise that is the
Senate ideal.
</P>
<P>
   She also recently began competing vigorously with him for female
voters by stressing that his support for abortion rights is timid
and out of step with his party, while hers is unwavering and
complete. The right to an abortion is popular in New York and she
is not running as strongly among white women as she must if she is
to win.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady, like her husband, is a polarizing candidate.
</P>
<P>
   This can be both good and bad. Some polarizing candidates, such
as Sens. Edward Kennedy on the left and Jesse Helms on the right,
galvanize their own troops and repeatedly win. Some, such as former
Iran-Contra scandal figure Oliver North, lose.
</P>
<P>
   Few people are indifferent to her superstar status. She's hard
to overlook. And a large proportion has already formed strong
opinions about her personality and her policies. Hard-core
Democrats defend her, hard-core Republicans denounce her. But
there's a middle group of undecided independents over whom the
election will be fought.
</P>
<P>
   She has been dogged by gossip about the shaky state of her
marriage; people seem more curious about her unique personal life
than how she'd protect New York interests in the Senate. Who can
blame them? It's certainly more fun to debate the secrets of the
complicated public relationship of a powerful, intelligent pair
than to dwell on the details of Medicare coverage.
</P>
<P>
   She said recently that she meant to ``spend the rest of my
life'' with President Clinton, baffling women who see that as a
failure to exert her own independence and amusing others who can't
imagine that she'll really stick it out when the election is over.
On that issue, she cannot win. She simply has to steam ahead and
emphasize issues. Her strategy should be to cloud the image of her
wayward husband and blacken the image of rival Rudy.
</P>
<P>
   Now that a real campaign is about to get underway, there's a
better chance that may happen than there has been the past few
months of partisan speculation.

<P>
   DES MOINES _ When Bill Bradley admitted last week that he had
experienced recurrences of a heart problem, the contender for the
Democratic presidential nomination sought to minimize it, blaming
the irregular heartbeat on too many cream sodas.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is that Bradley, as the electoral season opens,
has bigger issues to deal with.
</P>
<P>
   Like those sodas, his campaign _ which once seemed so refreshing
and fizzy _ is now a little flat.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed a few weeks ago as if Bradley might overtake Al Gore,
the vice president and front-runner for the Democratic nomination,
and do it in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   But the polls _ which may well be wrong _ say no; and they also
point to possible disappointments for Bradley in New Hampshire next
week, and even in Massachusetts in March.
</P>
<P>
   The much-heralded ``insurgent'' candidates, Bradley and Senator
John McCain for the Republicans, are both staring defeat in the
face, as the establishment _ represented by Gore and George W. Bush
_ steams ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's campaign headquarters in Des Moines, a former aerobics
studio in the suburban University area, was humming with activity
at the end of last week.
</P>
<P>
   The hallway was thick with stationery, scattered around in boxes
or stacked irregularly on shelves. Sandwiches and apples were still
scattered around from lunch (there was no cream soda in sight).
</P>
<P>
   At one end of the room stood a board where staffers marked every
success in winning over a precinct, ringing a small bell to
celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   But a few blocks south, the Gore campaign has its own building,
with office after office. It does not hum: it buzzes, with dozens
of staff coming and going all the time.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 50 people here, twice as many as in Bradley's
office; Gore has four times as many field workers.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradleyites are quietly dedicated: the Goreans are
singlemindedly zealous, chanting ``We Love Al Gore!'' at staff
meetings every morning.
</P>
<P>
   Camp Bradley looks like a magazine office; Fort Gore like a
thriving insurance business. Staffers sit in front of Microsoft
Access databases of voters, staring at the one field which really
matters: Yes, No, or Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   Britons Isabel Campbell and Sam Dowling, both with experience in
the House of Commons, have joined the Gore campaign as observers.
Both express their surprise at the scale and intensity of the
campaign. ``Just to see the organization is incredible,'' says
Dowling. ``It's so high energy. His very young team seems to be in
perpetual motion.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has campaigned hard and well, but some of his advisers
think he failed to respond quickly and brutally to accusations from
Gore about his health care proposals; indeed, he has sometimes
seemed impervious to the idea that there was any opposition. But
others fear that when he did answer back, he spoiled his pristine
image.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley has also suffered from the media cycle. A month
ago, he was new; now, Al Gore is the new new thing, his campaign
apparently revitalized and re-engaged.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of brute strength, Gore had the unions and their
organized muscle, which mobilized the campaign, while Bradley
struggled to get his structure in place.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in a previous campaign, dismissed what he called ``the
small state of Iowa,'' but he knows better now. Bradley said of the
current contest, ``We knew all along that Iowa is a state that
rewards entrenched power,'' which is true but didn't win many
friends.
</P>
<P>
   The medical questions have only added to his problems _
ironically, given that the one thing every Democrat could agree on
was that Bradley's heart was in the right place.
</P>
<P>
   The voters in Des Moines and New Hampshire, and indeed across
much of the country, do not seem to be in the mood for insurgent
candidates this year. The economy is robust, and no one wants to
jeopardize it.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Bradley's insurgency is hardly a rounded rejection of
everything that has gone before; he is no Che Guevara.
</P>
<P>
   One of the hardest things for both him and McCain this year has
been to calibrate their campaigns between rejection and embrace of
the establishment.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, still strong in New Hampshire, is also watching his
campaign fizzle: in South Carolina, which he dearly needs, he is 20
points behind Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But if Bradley fails, it represents a shift that goes beyond one
year's election. In the 36 years since the death of John F.
Kennedy, the only Democrats to win the White House have been
Southerners, Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is a Tennessean, and very much from the same stable as Bill
Clinton in terms of political orientation.
</P>
<P>
   The liberal and intellectual wing of the Democrat party _
predominantly Midwestern and Northeastern _ has many great names
stitched onto its tattered battle flag, honorable men who never
made it to the presidency, for different reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Adlai Stevenson, Bobby Kennedy, Hubert Humphrey, Michael Dukakis
and all the rest are there _ and Bradley may have earned his
place. &QL;

   MINGO, IOWA _ It is a perfect winter's morning _ the sun
sparkling off the snowy fields, the sky a perfect blue with just a
brush stroke of cloud across the horizon. Out in the woods, the
deer are scudding through the snow, and two red-tailed hawks are
circling lazily through the oak and hickory trees.

   But John Parsons has no time to watch the wildlife today. He is
clearing the snow from his drive in his bright green John Deere
tractor.

   DES MOINES - George W. Bush, the leading Republican candidate
for U.S. president, has built his political career on donations

   WASHINGTON _ Just 12 years ago, a certain U.S. senator by the
name of Al Gore dismissed the presidential selection process that
takes place in the Midwestern state of Iowa this evening (Monday)
as ``an arcane procedure that produces crazy results.''
</P>
<P>
   It was, he said of the small local gatherings known as the Iowa
caucuses, ``a ridiculous test'' and he ignored the whole charade,
proceeding directly to what he then regarded as the more sane and

   MINGO, IOWA _ It is a perfect winter's morning _ the sun
sparkling off the snowy fields, the sky a perfect blue with just a
brush stroke of cloud across the horizon. Out in the woods, the
deer are scudding through the snow, and two red-tailed hawks are
circling lazily through the oak and hickory trees.
</P>
<P>
   But John Parsons has no time to watch the wildlife today. He is
clearing the snow from his drive in his bright green John Deere
tractor.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight (Monday), Parsons and his wife, Jenifer, will welcome a
dozen or so of their neighbors to help choose the next president of
the United States in the first electoral event of the 2000
election.

   DES MOINES _ When Bill Bradley admitted last week that he had
experienced recurrences of a heart problem, the contender for the
Democratic presidential nomination sought to minimize it, blaming
the irregular heartbeat on too many cream sodas.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is that Bradley, as the electoral season opens,
has bigger issues to deal with. Like those sodas, his campaign _
which once seemed so refreshing and fizzy _ is now a little flat.
</P>
<P>
   The medical questions have only added to his problems _
ironically, given that the one thing every Democrat could agree on
was that Bradley's heart was in the right place.

THE POLITICAL WORD THAT MEANS ITS OPPOSITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Jan. 30)  
(Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics.) 
(lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Janus, the Roman god who was guardian of gates and doors, is
depicted with his bearded face looking front and back at the same
time; this helped him watch everybody. It is the metaphoric source
of ``Janus words,'' those confusing terms that mean both one thing
and its opposite, like  &UR; cleave &LR;  (``to split'' and ``to cling'') or
 &UR; sanction &LR;  (``to approve'' and ``to punish'').
</P>
<P>
   Janus has now taken over the central word defining the American
system of government.  &UR; Federalism &LR;  is suffering through a semantic
crisis and needs our help.
</P>
<P>
   A headline in The New York Times over an article about a case
that pitched states' rights against the authority of the national
government read: ``Supreme Court, in Blow to Federalism, Shields
States From Age Discrimination Suits.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Greenhouse reported that the court, ``continuing its march
in the direction of states' rights, ruled today that Congress
lacked the authority to bind state governments to the federal law
that bars discrimination against older workers.''
</P>
<P>
   That was surely a blow to the federal (by which we mean
``national'') government in Washington, but was it a blow to
 &UR; federalism &LR; ? The founding fathers (a paternalistic but accurate
alliteration coined in 1918 by Sen. Warren G. Harding) would say
no. Not if you take the Oxford English Dictionary's first
definition of that word (coined in 1788 by Patrick Henry with his
irate question ``Is this  &UR; federalism &LR; ?'').
</P>
<P>
   The OED answers his query with ``that form of government in
which two or more states constitute a political unity while
remaining more or less independent with regard to their internal
affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Other lexicographers agree about the essence of the federalist
idea, which is to divide power between a central authority and its
constituent political units.
</P>
<P>
   But right from the start two centuries ago, confusion was built
in; to George Washington, John Adams and Alexander Hamilton,
 &UR; federalism &LR;  accentuated the unity that only a strong central
government could provide. To Thomas Jefferson and James Madison,
who formed a faction that they called ``republican'' but that was
promptly labeled Anti-Federalist,  &UR; federalism &LR;  emphasized the
diffusion of power to levels of government closest to the people
and furthest from royalism _ at that time, the states.
</P>
<P>
   When Jefferson defeated the Hamilton-Adams Federalists to become
president, he famously said, ``We are all  &UR; Federalists &LR; ,'' to
absorb the defeated party. But the word's meaning was no longer
just ``a power-sharing arrangement among national and regional
sovereignties''; its primary sense had become ``a strong central
government.'' These meanings, if not antithetical, are at least
Janus-like in their difference.
</P>
<P>
   Some political scientists today are reverting to the
power-sharing meaning. ``While  &UR; Federalists &LR;  in 1787 advocated
creation of a powerful central government,'' reports Warren Richey
in The Christian Science Monitor, ``those advocating  &UR; federalism &LR; 
today are seeking a resurgence of a federal-state balance as
mandated in the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   This linguistic case is ripe for semantic decision; certiorari
accepted.  &UR; Federal &LR;  (from  &UR; foedus &LR; , ``league'') is an adjective
that has come to mean ``characteristic of a national union'' and
not of ``a confederation'';  &UR; federalize &LR; , despite the powers denied
the national government and reserved for the states and the people
in the 10th Amendment, is a verb meaning ``to bring under central
control.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the Supreme Court, even as it has recently been
devolving power from the central government to the states,
 &UR; cleaves &LR;  to the earliest meaning: Chief Justice Rehnquist, in a
decision this month briefly departing from that decentralizing
trend, said that a federal law protecting drivers' privacy over
South Carolina's objections ``did not run afoul of the  &UR; federalism &LR; 
principles.'' He was using  &UR; federalism &LR;  as Patrick Henry did, in
the sense of ``sharing power.''
</P>
<P>
   I care not what semantic course others may take; as for me, give
me current meaning or give me death. Time for the Supremes to bow
to the inexorability of common usage, a kind of 10th Amendment of
language change. Most people take  &UR; federalism &LR;  to mean ``dominated
by the federal government,'' much as the empire-building Hamilton
intended. In this, Rehnquist is behind the times.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the headline words ``in Blow to  &UR; Federalism &LR; ,'' which
meant ``anti-central government,'' were correctly up-to-date; it
would have been even better stated as ``in Blow to
 &UR; Federalizing &LR; .'' Norma Loquendi's final decision is remanded to
the court for reversal.
</P>
<P>
   THE GALUMPHERS
</P>
<P>
   In a review of the latest work of the modern dancer Mark Morris,
Anna Kisselgoff, the New York Times dance critic, used a verb of
great piquancy: ``Morris  &UR; galumphs &LR;  with charm.''
</P>
<P>
   Alice Cheang, writing in The Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies,
used it to describe a belly-rubbing self-caricature by the poet Su
Shih: ``This leisurely rambler  &UR; galumphs &LR;  merrily through the woods
in pursuit of a view of the `tall bamboo.'''
</P>
<P>
   In The Los Angeles Times, Susan Spano reported from Costa Rica
about a sea turtle: ``It's a big black blur in the shallows that
starts to take shape as it  &UR; galumphs &LR;  up the beach on powerful
front fins ill suited to terrestrial locomotion.''
</P>
<P>
   The verb began as a concoction of Lewis Carroll in his 1872
``Through the Looking Glass.'' The beamish boy slew the burbling
jabberwock with his vorpal blade, which went snicker-snack: ``He
left it dead, and with its head/He went  &UR; galumphing &LR;  back.''
</P>
<P>
   Most scholarly speculation about what was going on in Carroll's
mind as he coined the word suggests  &UR; galumph &LR;  is an amalgam of
 &UR; gallop &LR;  and  &UR; triumphant &LR; . The coinage applies nicely to sea
turtles, happy yogic exercisers and expressive dancers, not to
mention a parade of journalists traipsing after candidates through
the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   GUMMING THE BULLET
</P>
<P>
   As political bromides pile up, a salute to Jim Hoagland,
associate editor and chief foreign correspondent of The Washington
Post, for picking up on a little-used play on an overused metaphor
_  &UR; biting the bullet &LR;  _ stemming from Civil War pre-anesthetic
field-hospital use, now meaning ``facing up to a painful
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoagland described the U.S. government's reluctant toleration of
the development of Iraqi weapons as ``gumming the bullet,'' a
variation first noted by Nick Poulos in The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution. That's how to  &UR; galumph &LR;  through the thicket
of cliches.

A METHOD TO TRACK EVOLUTION _ OR IS IT? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Utah, Great Britain)  (The Science Times)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Though they have lodged in human cells for more than a billion
years, the mitochondria have never quite given up their own ways.
Believed to be bacteriumlike organisms that were swallowed up by
the ancestors of human cells, mitochondria, organelles that process
energy in cells, have retained their DNA, distinct from the genetic
material in the cell's nucleus. Unlike the nuclear DNA, a pastiche
of genes from both parents, the mitochondrial genome has long been
assumed to replicate itself by cloning, passing solely through the
maternal line.
</P>
<P>
   The clonal inheritance of mitochondrial DNA, along with the fact
that it mutates much faster than nuclear DNA, has made it an
important tool in the study of the evolution of people and animals.
For example, evidence from mitochondrial DNA has been used to back
the theory that modern humans originated in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, however, several articles have challenged the
assumption of clonal inheritance in mitochondria, suggesting that
fathers, not just mothers, might be contributing mitochondrial DNA
to their offspring, a process called recombination.
</P>
<P>
   Among other findings, researchers found that in mice, fathers
contributed mitochondrial DNA to their offspring at a frequency of
one in 10,000 and that, contrary to popular belief, the
mitochondria in human sperm can enter the egg during fertilization.
Most recently, in research published in the journal Science, three
scientists concluded from a statistical analysis of a pattern of
genetic inheritance that the DNA in mitochondria, like that in the
nucleus, undergoes a shuffling process known as recombination,
possibly involving the mixing of DNA from both parents.
</P>
<P>
   The findings have yet to convince most researchers who study the
genetic inheritance. Still, a succession of findings has been
jarring, sending some researchers into their labs to test the
claims and look for more evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly has attracted a lot of attention and gotten some
people pretty concerned because of the claims that they directly
make that all of this mitochondrial research now has to be
reconsidered,'' said Dr. Lynn B. Jorde, a human geneticist at the
University of Utah. ``They're issuing a strong challenge now and
the question is what is the strength of their challenge. Many of us
feel that it is not really that great, especially as we look at
their data and re-evaluate.''
</P>
<P>
   In the latest assault on the assumption that mitochondrial DNA
does not recombine, Dr. Philip Awadalla of the University of
Edinburgh, and Dr. Adam Eyre-Walker and Dr. John Maynard Smith of
the University of Sussex in Brighton, England, found evidence that
recombination in mitochondria had interfered with a distinctive
pattern of genetic inheritance known as linkage disequilibrium.
</P>
<P>
   In linkage disequilibrium, one allele, a specific DNA variation
at one site on the genome, occurs with another allele at a
different site at a rate that is higher than expected by chance
alone. The further away the sites lie from each, the more likely it
is that recombination will redistribute them, just as two raisins
at opposite ends of a loaf of bread have a better chance of ending
up in two different slices of bread than do two that are next to
each other.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the researchers found that both alleles occurred in the
same individual less often as the distance between the sites
increased. ``This is expected if there is genetic recombination but
hard to explain in any other way,'' the authors concluded.
</P>
<P>
   But Jorde said he and Alan Rogers, an anthropologist at the same
university, had found problems with the study.
</P>
<P>
   ``The method they used to measure linkage disequilibrium can be
influenced by other things than recombination,'' like the frequency
with which a given variation occurs in the population being
studied, Jorde said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing that needs to be done is to repeat this on
much larger sample sizes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Eyre-Walker said his group had addressed the
question of allele frequencies but acknowledged that they might not
have covered all the ``subtleties in the statistics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've now got a big push to analyze more data, and get some
money to do some new sequencing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bryan Sykes, a human geneticist at Oxford University, said
his laboratory had run similar tests on many data sets but had not
found evidence of recombination. Though he acknowledged that
recombination might be possible, he noted that two papers on the
subject had been brought under sharp challenge.
</P>
<P>
   One reason that Sykes and others are skeptical of paternal
contribution to mitochondrial DNA is that it has failed to turn up
in studies of families, where recombination would presumably appear
obvious: An offspring's mitochondrial DNA would contain parts of
the mitochondrial DNA from both parents.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he and others are reluctant to rule out the possibility
that recombination can occur. The alacrity with which they have
addressed the possibility illustrates how much is at stake for them
if it turns out to be a factor in mitochondrial clocks. The
question is how frequently it occurs.
</P>
<P>
   While Eyre-Walker acknowledged that mitochondrial recombination
might be rare, he said that as far as he knew ``there had been no
work to find out what happens to a phylogenetic tree if you put a
little recombination into it.''

SCIENCE JOURNALS PUBLISHES 53 MOST IMPORTANT PAPERS OF THE 20TH
CENTURY 
</HEADLINE>

   ``It is somewhat depressing, at age 91, to reread the work of 36
years ago, when the juices in a brain, now made largely of
overcooked brussels sprouts, were flowing more rapidly.''
</P>
<P>
   So begins Dr. Jesse L. Greenstein's remembrance of a paper he
had first published in the July 1, 1964, issue of The Astrophysical
Journal concerning the likely energy source of the distant,
shockingly luminous objects called quasars.
</P>
<P>
   The paper and remembrance appear in a new, 1,283-page compendium
of what have been judged the 53 most important papers to appear in
The Astrophysical Journal and The Astronomical Journal in the 20th
century.
</P>
<P>
   Affectionately known as Ap.J. and A.J., the journals are the
most respected and important in astronomy. They have chronicled
astronomy's journey from the turn-of-the-century debate over
whether the Milky Way made up the entire cosmos to the present view
that Earth's galaxy is one obscure smudge of stars and gas hurtling
apart from billions of others in the wake of the Big Bang.
</P>
<P>
   With each paper there is an accompanying article placing the
original contribution in context and bringing its implications up
to date. Some of the accompaniments are by original authors, some
by astronomers of more recent vintage.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jeremiah P. Ostriker of Princeton, for example, comments on
an October 1937 paper by Dr. Fritz Zwicky of the California
Institute of Technology that provided the first evidence that the
universe might be full of a strange kind of ``dark matter'' _ a
mysterious substance that still baffles astronomers.
</P>
<P>
   That date, notes Ostriker in his comment, meant the original
paper was published ``six months after my own birth, and so, no
doubt, conceived before I was.''
</P>
<P>
   The century's best were chosen by a panel of astronomers led by
Dr. Donald E. Osterbrock of the University of California in Santa
Cruz. Behind the exercise was more than a desire to hand out blue
ribbons, according to Dr. Helmut A. Abt, who stepped down as editor
in chief of Ap.J. last year, after nearly 30 years in the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are tempted to think that most of the important
results were derived in the past decade or two,'' Abt wrote in the
introduction to the volume. But, he went on with a veteran's
measured ire, ``it is sometimes surprising to discover how many
basic results were obtained many years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   One early debate involved the size of the universe. Astronomers
knew that a crucial clue lay in the nature of what they called the
spiral nebula, of which a prominent example was an object called
Messier 31 in the constellation Andromeda. Were they wisps of gas
and dust in the cozy confines of the Milky Way or ``island
universes,'' meaning whole galaxies themselves, lying far away?
</P>
<P>
   In 1925, the astronomer Edwin Hubble set that question to rest
in a paper in Ap.J. titled ``A Spiral Nebula as a Stellar System,
Messier 31.'' Based on about 350 photographs taken with the
100-inch and 60-inch reflecting telescopes at Mount Wilson in
California, the largest telescopes of the day, the paper showed
that the nebula's spiral arms contained swarms of faint stars,
including variable stars and novas, and that it was much too
distant to be contained in the Milky Way.
</P>
<P>
   ``This paper clearly ended all doubts that the spiral galaxies
were extragalactic,'' wrote Dr. Arthur D. Code of the University of
Wisconsin in a commentary. The finding also made it easier to
swallow Hubble's next big discovery, in 1929, that all those other
galaxies are rushing apart from one another _ the hallmark of the
Big Bang that most astronomers now believe gave birth to the
universe.
</P>
<P>
   A whole series of papers explored starlight: how the energy of
nuclear fusion reactions fuels the brilliance of stars and builds
up heavier and heavier elements from the hydrogen, helium and other
small change left over from the Big Bang.
</P>
<P>
   When these stars explode as novas and supernovas, they spread
those elements through the cosmos. Without the heavy elements
generated in stars, Earth and everything on it, including people,
would not exist. Or as Joni Mitchell sang at Woodstock: ``We are
stardust.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the great names associated with that work and appearing
on the contents page of this collection are those of Fred Hoyle,
William Fowler, E. Margaret Burbidge, Geoffrey Burbidge, Donald D.
Clayton and Stirling Colgate.
</P>
<P>
   Greenstein's paper was written with Dr. Maarten Schmidt of the
California Institute of Technology, who had discovered that quasars
were billions of light-years away, and therefore (because they
appear so bright) burning with the energy of hundreds of billions
of suns. Greenstein and Schmidt concluded, rightly as it seems now,
that the energy source for these beasts could only be tremendous
amounts of matter pouring into a compact object that is now called
a black hole.
</P>
<P>
   Other spectacular moments on the highlight reel include the
discovery of the Big Bang's afterglow by Dr. Arno A. Penzias and
Dr. Robert W. Wilson and Dr. Eugene N. Parker's gutsy, but correct,
prediction that the sun throws off a supersonic stream of
particles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, in the space age, the term `solar wind' is a scientific
byword and not entirely unknown to the daily newspapers,'' Parker
wrote in his commentary.
</P>
<P>
   The commentaries and the discursive, almost Victorian feel of
the old papers make this collection, called the American
Astronomical Society Centennial Issue, surprisingly readable and
always engrossing.
</P>
<P>
   How does it feel to be named one of the 20th century's best?
</P>
<P>
   ``I have many big honors, but they are local in time, here one
decade and forgotten the next,'' said Clayton, who is an
astrophysicist at Clemson University. ``This honor will go into the
history books.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an ambitious move to better understand the ups
and downs of Earth, the space shuttle Endeavour is to make a
detailed radar map of the planet's surface that could be a boon to
everyone from military planners to weekend backpackers.
</P>
<P>
   Endeavour and a six-member crew are to be launched next Monday
on an 11-day mission to sweep most of Earth's land masses with
radar signals and create the most complete, three-dimensional map
of the planet's surface ever assembled.
</P>
<P>
   The mission is to gather so much data about the hills, plains,
valleys and other surface details of planet topography that it will
take more than a year of analysis to produce the global map. To
retrieve information needed for the three-dimensional views, the
shuttle will have to extend a 197-foot metal and plastic antenna
mast, the longest rigid structure ever deployed in space.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists say comprehensive information about height variations
on land will aid studies of erosion, flooding, earthquakes,
volcanoes, landslides and climate change. In addition, it will
improve maps used for land and forest management, recreation and
the selection of sites for development, including the placement of
communications equipment like wireless telephone towers.
</P>
<P>
   Topographical information from ground and air surveys, and from
radar data gathered by aircraft and space satellites, is available
for most parts of the world in varying degrees of detail. But
because information gathered at different times from disparate
sources is often hard to use in research, scientists say the
shuttle data will be invaluable because it will be consistent for
the whole world. Spacecraft sent to Venus and Mars have produced
better topographical maps of those worlds than exist for Earth.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to topographical maps showing the elevations and
depths of the surface, the radar scans are to produce black and
white images of most of the planet's surface area that are
unobscured by clouds, fog or darkness. Scientists say this picture
mosaic covering almost all of the populated area of Earth will
serve as an unprecedented reference point from which to study
future changes on the planet's surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a snapshot of the planet in one 10-day period,''
said Dr. Michael Kobrick of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the
chief scientist of the project. ``There is nothing else like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Endeavour is to fly in an orbit between 60 degrees North and 56
degrees South that will allow it to map all the land from the
southern edge of Greenland to the southern tip of South America, an
area encompassing 80 percent of Earth's land mass and 95 percent of
its population.
</P>
<P>
   The project, called the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission, has
not had the smoothest path from conception to launching. It is
months behind schedule and has been marked by uncertainties over
how much information will be gathered and who will be given access
to it.
</P>
<P>
   Originally set to fly last September, the mission was delayed
while NASA inspected the entire four-shuttle fleet for electrical
wiring problems. Inspections and subsequent repairs were ordered
after the shuttle Columbia suffered an electrical short that
knocked out two engine computers during its launching in July. The
radar mapping flight was delayed again when NASA decided to launch
the shuttle Discovery ahead of it in December to repair the Hubble
Space Telescope.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers involved with the mapping flight were surprised, and
some were disturbed, by a decision last week by mission managers to
reduce the number of days of radar mapping to nine from 10.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Dye of NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, the lead
flight director for the mission, said officials had decided to cut
data gathering short to improve the chances of retracting and
saving the long antenna mast in case problems developed at the end
of the mission. Earlier plans called for severing the expandable
mast from the shuttle and discarding it in space if problems
developed in retrieving it. The new schedule gives astronauts time
to perform an emergency spacewalk to help reel in the mast.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are currently no plans to fly the radar equipment
and mast again, Dye said managers wanted to keep future options
open. The mast is also very similar to long trusses that will be
deployed from the International Space Station to support its solar
power arrays, and some experts said NASA might wish to re-examine
one that had been used in space.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided it was a good idea to preserve the mast, to keep
the capability to bring the mast in,'' Dye said. ``This is a device
which we've never deployed before.''
</P>
<P>
   Kobrick, disappointed that scientists would lose 10 percent of
their expected data, said, ``I wish it were otherwise.'' He said
the research team was looking into alternatives for getting the
lost data, including the somewhat unlikely possibility of extending
the mission for a day by conserving power aboard the shuttle. The
radar equipment uses so much power that some officials believe this
is improbable.
</P>
<P>
   Another issue raised by the mission is who will have access to
the information it gathers.
</P>
<P>
   A major co-sponsor of the mission, contributing $200 million
toward its cost, is the Defense Department's National Imagery and
Mapping Agency, which provides maps and pictures to military and
civilian intelligence agencies. The military agency said it would
restrict availability to the mission's most detailed mapping data
for national security reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Military applications for this information include improved
weapons targeting, better aircraft navigation and flight simulator
training, and enhanced battlefield management and tactical
planning.
</P>
<P>
   The radar mission will produce highly detailed data in so-called
30-meter resolution, about three times more detailed than 90-meter
data commonly available for most parts of the world. This
resolution will provide three-dimensional information in an area
about 100 feet on each side that has a vertical height accuracy of
at least 16 meters (about 50 feet) and down to 6 meters (20 feet)
in the best case.
</P>
<P>
   The military agency said it would make worldwide 90-meter data
available to anyone who wanted it, as well as 30-meter data for the
United States, where information of this detail is already commonly
accessible. However, it said, 30-meter information for the rest of
the world would be restricted and available to civilian researchers
only on a case-by-case basis. Agency spokesmen have questioned
whether civilian users need the detailed map data.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Dr. Victor R. Baker, a professor of hydrology and water
resources at the University of Arizona, said his research on
flooding and the flow of rocks and other debris along waterways was
improved by having the most detailed topographical information
available. ``We can do a better job if we have 30-meter data,
particularly if it's digital and can be combined with other kinds
of data, such as imagery,'' he said, ``But even having 90-meter
data helps if it is from the same source.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker said most of his research concerned the United States,
where 30-meter data from the shuttle mission was expected to be
available. ``But having the same data available for places
elsewhere would help us compare similar features and enhance our
work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kobrick of NASA said he saw little difficulty working under his
agency's arrangement with the Defense Department about the data.
``The 30-meter data will be available, but I will have to ask for
it,'' he said, ``Their only request is that I don't publish the raw
data itself with my results. I'm perfectly happy with this
arrangement we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas A. Hennig, the military agency's program manager for the
project, pointed out that only about 60 to 70 percent of the world
was now mapped at 90-meter resolution and in some places, even this
is restricted information. Releasing data of this resolution for
the world, along with the radar image mosaic, amounts to a huge
increase in topographical information benefiting people worldwide,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   John E. Pike, a space and military policy expert with the
Federation of American Scientists, said the military agency had
legitimate concerns about releasing the detailed data. ``This
information is potentially useful to other militaries, also,'' he
said, ``The Defense Department wants to see that the data doesn't
fall into hostile hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Space shuttles have flown radar-mapping instruments on five
previous occasions, culminating in two flights in 1994 that
demonstrated three-dimensional mapping by flying over the area
twice to take slightly offset images that were later combined into
pictures showing elevation differences. Kobrick and Edward Caro, an
engineer also with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, came up with the
idea of getting three-dimensional topographical images from the
shuttle in a single pass by putting additional radar receivers on a
boom extending from the spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   Once Endeavour reaches orbit, it is to deploy the boom almost
immediately from a canister in its cargo bay.
</P>
<P>
   Flying with modifications to the same equipment used in 1994,
Endeavour is to orbit 145 miles above Earth, making radar scans in
swaths 140 miles wide. The international mission features radar
equipment made by the German Space Agency and the Italian Space
Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle, flying upside-down and tail first, will sweep the
path with C-Band and X-Band signals transmitted by antennas that
are part of its 29,000-pound cargo of radar equipment. The signals
will bounce off Earth and back to the shuttle, where they will be
picked up by receiving antennas in the cargo bay and at the end of
the 640-pound mast almost 200 feet away.
</P>
<P>
   Using a technique called interferometry, each antenna will
record almost identical data to form images, but the offset
distance will cause slight phase variations in the signal that
allow creation of three-dimensional images when the data is
combined. NASA said the scans would produce so much data that it
would take more than 13,500 standard CD-ROM disks to contain it.

RAT STUDIES RAISE HOPE OF CONQUERING PARALYSIS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.C., Mo., Fla., Canada)  (Science Times)  (DW) 
 By HOLCOMB B. NOBLE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Researchers at the University of Massachusetts Medical School
have taken immature cells from the spinal cords of adult rats,
induced them to grow and then implanted them in the gap of the
severed spinal cords of paralyzed rats. Within two weeks, the
paralyzed animals began to move, the scientists say, and within
three months several of them could stand and walk.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment is one of several at laboratories around the
world that researchers say provide increased evidence that, with
still much more research to come, they will be able to conquer one
of the oldest problems in medicine: treating people permanently
paralyzed as a result of severed, crushed or diseased spinal cords.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Charles A. Vacanti, who headed the team at the University of
Massachusetts in Worcester, said the animals could not scurry like
normal rats but walked in a coordinated way. Some lived two years
longer with no loss of mobility, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To us this was a spectacular finding,'' Vacanti said,
``showing not only that the animals recovered their ability to walk
but also to perceive fairly normal sensation.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the spinal cord is severed, the chances of recovering
anything approaching normal mobility are regarded _ as has been the
case for centuries _ as zero. Over the years, other researchers
have reported that they have recovered such function in animals
only to have the reports prove false or unable to be replicated.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction to the University of Massachusetts work among
medical scientists has been varied. Some call it a stunning
accomplishment; others want to wait for further research, with one
suggesting that the new mobility may simply be ``step walking,'' a
kind of jolting, muscle response that may come from the
experimentation itself rather than from brain messages.
</P>
<P>
   Still the Massachusetts work is one of the most startling
efforts in the rapidly evolving field of tissue engineering in
which biologists and biomedical engineers are growing living tissue
in incubators and bio-reactors. The goal is to create living
replacement parts for the human body that will work better than
synthetic parts or scarce transplants.
</P>
<P>
   Vacanti's team has been working in collaboration with a team
headed by his brother, Dr. Joseph P. Vacanti at Harvard Medical
School _ in fact, a total of four Vacanti brothers are involved in
tissue engineering _ and a team headed by Dr. Robert Langer at
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   The Harvard and MIT groups recently collaborated in growing a
small, partially functioning liver that was able to produce
albumen, one of many proteins that contain essential building
blocks of the body.
</P>
<P>
   They and others, at Laval University in Quebec, Duke University
in Durham, N.C., and elsewhere, have grown live blood vessels from
human cells and animal cells and tested them in animals with
initial success. Peripheral nerves are being produced that repair
animal nerve damage to degrees that far surpass the standard
treatments.
</P>
<P>
   In all, university and private scientific labs are at various
stages of growing some 23 forms of live tissue, including live
cartilage to repair muscle structure without surgery and skin grown
from human cells.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Joseph Vacanti is now working toward the goal many would
regard as the piece de resistance of tissue engineering: growing a
human heart.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview at the Massachusetts General lab, he held
up an elegant model of a sheep's heart, with the graceful line and
symmetry of sculpture. It was built by a plastics manufacturer to
specifications supplied by Harvard and MIT.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, we pumped a liquid plastic into the blood supply of
a sheep's heart,'' he said. ``When it hardened, we removed the
animal tissue chemically, and have the mold of the sheep's heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Langer's lab is now electronically scanning slices of the mold
so a computer can make a three-dimensional reconstruction and a
mathematical model.
</P>
<P>
   With this, a new mold of biodegradable plastic will be made.
That will be seeded with heart-tissue cells that are to regenerate
as the plastic disappears.
</P>
<P>
   The hope is that eventually that such cells can be made to grow
into a beating implantable sheep's heart.
</P>
<P>
   Much of this delicate and sophisticated tissue engineering grew,
in a sense, out of seaweed on a beach on Cape Cod in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Langer and Dr. Joseph Vacanti had been pondering how to create
polymer, or plastic, molds that were thick, strong and durable
enough to last and yet delicate enough to perform intricate tasks,
like delivering blood through the tiniest of capillaries. While he
walked on the beach Joseph Vacanti spotted a piece of seaweed with
a tough exterior and finely detailed interior branches. He ran to a
telephone and called Langer: ``Could we design polymers that had a
branching structure like that?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' came the reply, ``we could probably do that.''
</P>
<P>
   They did, and molds with tough exteriors and interior branches
and channels are now in widespread use in the science of growing
living tissue.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The new University of Massachusetts spinal-cord work by Dr.
Charles Vacanti has been reported at a medical meeting in London of
the British Tissue and Cell Engineering Society and widely
discussed among biomedical engineers and neurologists at other
medical meetings.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to reveal the detailed data of the study while an
article about it is under peer review for a medical journal.
</P>
<P>
   But he described the work in general terms: The team took
spinal-cord cells, from adults animals, that had matured to the
progenitor stage _ developed, or differentiated, enough to belong
generally to the spinal cord but not enough to be assigned to any
specific part of the cord.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in a petri dish inside an incubator with the right
nutrients, heat and oxygen supply, the cells regenerated into a
large enough population to begin tissue growth. But they were not
allowed at this stage to differentiate further.
</P>
<P>
   The spinal cord is thought by some to be made up of separate
fibers, like wires in a telephone cable, which, if severed, must be
reconnected precisely, red wire in one section, say, with the red
in the other. But Charles Vacanti's group believed this connection
might not have to be made directly but could come about on its own.
</P>
<P>
   The team put its not-fully differentiated progenitor cells in a
four-millimeter break in the rats' spinal cord. Vacanti said, they
regenerated into a new functional section. Vacanti said he believed
the key was using only progenitor cells, an idea conceived by
another of his brothers, Dr. Martin P. Vacanti, a member of the
University of Massachusetts team.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thought was that the undifferentiated progenitor cells, if
left on their own,'' Martin Vacanti said, ``would sort themselves
into the right order, and produce all the necessary functions.''
</P>
<P>
   This approach is a sharply different from one being tried by the
fourth brother, Dr. Francis X. Vacanti, a member of Joseph
Vacanti's team. He is trying to implant new spinal cord cells that
directly link each nerve fiber of the new with the matching fiber
of the old, in effect connecting ``red'' line to ``red.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other scientists, the responses have been mixed. Assessing
the University of Massachusetts work, Dr. David J. Mooney, a
biomedical engineer at the University of Michigan, said, ``What
Charles Vacanti and his team have accomplished is simply
stunning.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Henry Brem, a professor of neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins
University, said he would be trying the techniques in his own
research.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Joy Young, professor of cell biology and neuroscience at
Rutgers, said that with similar work elsewhere, the recent efforts
carry strong promise for improving the outlook for patients with
spinal-cord damage, now estimated to be 300,000 to 500,000 people
in the United States. Work at Washington University in St. Louis
and at the University of Florida, among others, has involved fetal
and embryonic cells that have been transplanted into animal spinal
cords and appear to have taken hold.
</P>
<P>
   Other neurologists were more cautious, among them, Dr. Evan
Snyder at Harvard Medical School and Children's Hospital in Boston,
one of the first to isolate the most primitive cells of the brain.
</P>
<P>
   He and others recognized that contrary to what had long been
believed, undeveloped brain cells in adults could be developed,
with the potential for treatment of a wide variety of diseases, for
conditions as diverse as heart failure and Lou Gehrig's disease.
</P>
<P>
   Another year may be needed, Snyder said, before ``we can really
prove that severed spinal cords can be repaired, with reconnections
really made, allowing the brain-message delivery that permits
mammals to regain normal mobility.''
</P>
<P>
   He agreed that what the University of Massachusetts team had
done was interesting but said it was possible that its experiment
might have produced a kind of local ``step walking'' ability that
stemmed from muscles, not brain signals, as seen in previous
experiments with cats, for example.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Charles Vacanti said observers found that the walking
appeared to be coordinated rather than the jerky style seen in
step-walking. The animals also recovered sensory function, he said,
as well as developing new tissue, all signs that led the team to
conclude that real connections between the new spinal cord and the
old had been made.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Snyder himself or one of the Vacanti teams are closest
to the mark, they all find themselves in a highly competitive area
of research.
</P>
<P>
   It is not uncommon for researchers trying to achieve the same
results to be secretive about the work and progress. But the four
Vacanti brothers do not seem to fit that pattern.
</P>
<P>
   ``We actually talk to each other all the time about what we're
doing,'' Charles Vacanti said. ``Otherwise we never could have
progressed as well as we have.''

</P>
<P>
   An intense storm about 200 miles off the middle Atlantic coast
will buffet eastern New England and the middle Atlantic shoreline
with wind gusts to 45 mph. A swath of moderate to heavy snow is
most likely from eastern Maine southward to Long Island, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Milder air from the Atlantic should change snow to rain or sleet
over Cape Cod, Mass., and the Islands. A lighter snow will spread
inland across central New England and should also affect the New
York City region. However, a slight shift in the track of the storm
could lead to either heavy snow and strong winds or a dry day in
the Northeast Corridor.
</P>
<P>
   Low pressure in eastern Michigan will promote snow showers
around the central Great Lakes and into the western Ohio Valley. A
surge of very chilly air will reach into the Mississippi Valley on
gusty winds from the north. The Southeast will be cooler but
bright, as fresh breezes from the northwest direct drier air into
the region.
</P>
<P>
   A large area of high pressure in the Plains should move little
during the next two days. Sunny and seasonable conditions are
likely in northern sections, but clouds will advance into southern
parts of the Plains on Tuesday afternoon. A stream of moisture from
the Pacific will cover the Southwest as a cold front progresses
into the region.
</P>
<P>
   Rain will taper to showers along the California coast, but heavy
rain is expected in eastern sections. Snow levels will lower, but
recent wet and mild conditions may lead to flooding and mudslides
in parts of the lower Sierra. The Northwest will stay dull and damp
with readings near seasonal levels.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Alaskan Mirror
</P>
<P>
   In winter the temperature pattern in Alaska often mirrors that
of the eastern United States. This past week a deep chill has
gripped much of the East with subzero readings reported as far
south as North Carolina. Meanwhile, unusual warmth has swept into
interior Alaska, where the temperature in Fairbanks rose to 29
degrees on Sunday, or 30 degrees above normal. During winter, warm
air reaches Alaska when a bulge in the jet stream directs milder
winds from over the Pacific Ocean. In a seesawlike fashion, the jet
stream will then typically dip far to the south near the longitude
of eastern North America.

ICE CREAM HEADACHE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Science Times)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Why does eating something really cold, like ice cream,
sometimes give me a headache? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You are not alone, because about 30 percent of the population
seems to have the same problem.
</P>
<P>
   The classic ice cream headache is a stabbing pain that usually
peaks after 30 to 60 seconds, though it can last up to five
minutes. A doctor who gets such headaches himself, Dr. Robert
Smith, founder of the Cincinnati Headache Center at the University
of Cincinnati College of Medicine, experimented with crushed ice
applied to different parts of his mouth to see what set off the
pains.
</P>
<P>
   The culprit, his research indicates, is at the back of the
palate, from which a mass of nerves called the spheno-palatine
ganglion stretches into the head. The nerves control the dilation
and contraction of blood vessels, and dilated blood vessels in the
head are known to cause several kinds of headaches.
</P>
<P>
   Smith also found that he was able to induce such headaches only
on warm days, though the internal mouth temperature remains
constant. Other researchers have suggested that this is because in
hot weather, a person tends to gulp cold drinks or wolf down
lemonade so that the cold stuff is more likely to hit the palate
hard.
</P>
<P>
   Ways to avoid the pangs might be to let the ice cream warm up in
the front of the mouth before swallowing or to swallow it in such a
way that it does not linger on the palate. &QL;

`NEVER SAY DIE': A LONG LIFE, OR ONE THAT JUST FEELS LONG
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   All right, ``Never Say Die,'' the title of Tuesday night's
``Scientific American Frontiers,'' is hyperbolic, but it signals a
real quest by researchers to discover ways to prolong the physical
and mental well-being of humankind.
</P>
<P>
   As Alan Alda, the series' amiable host, discovers in
conversations with scientists, who perforce are carrying out most
of their experiments on rats, mice and worms, the means may be near
at hand to add decades to the Bible's authorized life span.
</P>
<P>
   The least surprising route is to eat less, but make sure that
what you eat is highly nutritious. Roy Walford, of Venice, Calif.,
is credited with finding that laboratory mice live up to twice
their normal age if their caloric intake is cut in half, and
monkeys who watch their diets stay younger longer. What has worked
on those lucky creatures seems to work, too, on humans. Walford,
who is 75, figures that 10 years on his diet should have already
added 15 or 20 years to his life span.
</P>
<P>
   Less familiar to viewers is the research being done on the
workings of human cells and things called telomeres that are
attached to chromosomes and can affect symptoms of aging like
cataracts, gray hair, wrinkled skin, arthritis and even cancer.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of California at Los Angeles (California seems
particularly attractive to seekers of eternal health), a team is
working to extend the life of the elderly to the limit, about 120
years; the hope is that if a 100-year-old comes down with an
infection, he will have a better chance of surviving it. In a few
years, Alda reports, what he calls ``an immune system boost'' could
become routine for everyone over 60. Another Californian, a
biologist, Cynthia Kenyon, made mutant worms live twice as long as
normal _ four weeks instead of two _ by fiddling with genes and
hormones. That inspires Alda to envision the possibility of ``a
long-life pill.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile researchers in Massachusetts are working at replacing
human body parts much like an auto repair shop does with car parts.
The spare parts would be grown from an individual's stem cells,
which would be a way to get around the shortage of organs for
transplant and rejection problems.
</P>
<P>
   The hour ends with those rats again, providing evidence that
mental activity keeps their brains working well into old age. So
there's some advice from Alda: ``Your brain starts to go away if
you don't use it every day.'' That's if you remember to keep your
calories down.

&HT;     STATE CONSIDERS CLOSED-CIRCUIT BROADCAST OF DIALLO TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARK McGUIRE  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Cameras, or at least one camera, might be allowed
into the courtroom where four police officers face charges of
killing a 22-year-old Bronx man.
</P>
<P>
   With courtroom seating at a premium in the Albany County
Courthouse and cameras barred from chronicling trials in New York,
the state is seriously considering a closed-circuit transmission of
the proceedings, at least to another courtroom, so more people can
watch.
</P>
<P>
   According to a spokesman for the state Office of Court
Administration (OCA), the intense interest in the case of four New
York city police officers accused of murdering Amadou Diallo in the
Bronx, coupled with the physical inability to accommodate all the
interested press, let alone the general public, could prompt the
installation of at least one television monitor.
</P>
<P>
   This would be the first time since cameras were again shut out
of New York's courtrooms in 1997 that such a closed-circuit
arrangement would be made, an OCA official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seriously looking at all the options and considering it
as a strong possibility,'' OCA spokesman David Bookstaver said
Friday. ``We are looking into all the variables that would go into
closed-circuit coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is great public interest and great media interest in the
trial and we have a finite number of seats'' in the courtroom of
state Supreme Court Justice Joseph C. Teresi, Bookstaver said. ``We
will do our best to accommodate the various constituencies who want
to watch or cover it.''
</P>
<P>
   Court TV has filed a motion with state Supreme Court to be
allowed to televise the case. The city is preparing to file a brief
supporting the cable network's efforts, Albany Mayor Jerry Jennings
said. A ruling is expected in a few days.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a state appeals court voted to move the trial of the
four officers _ on murder and reckless endangerment charges _ from
the Bronx to Albany for a trial starting Jan. 31. The court held
that extensive media coverage of the case had made it impossible to
pick a fair jury anywhere in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo, who lived and died in the Soundview area of the Bronx,
was hit by 19 bullets early in the morning of Feb. 4, 1999, in the
vestibule of the two-story apartment building in which he lived.
</P>
<P>
   The officers who shot Diallo said they believed he was armed and
dangerous. Police reports after the shooting said no weapon was
found and that Diallo had no criminal record. The four plainclothes
officers from the Street Crime Unit reportedly were looking for a
serial rapist.

Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The presidential hopefuls were making one more pitch before
tonight's Iowa caucuses, even though there wasn't much suspense
about the outcome. Both George W. Bush and Al Gore were urging
supporters to turn out and vote despite polls showing their hefty
leads in the state. Bill Bradley was brushing off any suggestion
that a poor showing could mean the end of his White House bid. He
told ABC a lengthy primary battle would strengthen the eventual
nominee. John McCain has not campaigned in Iowa, concentrating on
next week's New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   HAZE OF SMOKE OVER CAMPAIGN
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore denied on Monday that he smoked marijuana regularly,
even daily, with a Tennessee friend as late as 1976, as the man now
contends. The question came up when a reporter said to Gore at a
diner: ``It's been reported that after you came back from Vietnam
you were smoking on a daily basis.'' Gore responded, ``No. When I
came back from Vietnam, yes, but not to that extent. ... This is
something I dealt with a long time ago. It's old news.'' The
Tennessee man, John Warnecke, was quoted by the online magazine
Salon.
</P>
<P>
   PRETTY NICE MID-WINTER DAY
</P>
<P>
   The weather shouldn't be a problem in Iowa for today's
presidential caucuses. It's chilly across the state, but that's to
be expected _ since it usually is in winter. The forecast was
calling for highs in the teens in northeast Iowa, and some light
snow is possible. In the southeastern part of the state, it'll get
up to the low 40s _ considered downright balmy for this time of
year.
</P>
<P>
   OK FOR STATES TO CURB CAMPAIGN CASH FLOW
</P>
<P>
   States that put limits on campaign contributions were given a
green light Monday by the Supreme Court. The justices reaffirmed
the rights of the states to impose those limits in an effort to
deter corruption. The 6-3 decision in a Missouri case means there's
no longer any doubt about the legitimacy of the $1,000 cap on
contributions to federal candidates: The donation limit is not a
violation of free-speech rights.
</P>
<P>
   QUICK KNOCKOUTS A REAL POSSIBILITY
</P>
<P>
   If the front-runners, Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Al
Gore win both the Iowa caucuses tonight and the New Hampshire
primary eight days hence you might as well turn out the lights. The
losers may fight on through some subsequent contests but most
political observers say they believe that for all practical
purposes the nominations will be certain.
</P>
<P>
   NEW HAMPSHIRE TO HIMSELF FOR A DAY
</P>
<P>
   With everyone else in Iowa, John McCain took advantage of his
last day as the lone candidate in New Hampshire, focusing on
portraying himself as a more qualified leader than George W. Bush
and launching a TV ad touting his war service and knowledge of
foreign policy. To dispel notions that Bush might push him out of
the contest, McCain said he was sure to stick with the race at
least through Super Tuesday, March 7, when more than a dozen
states, including Georgia, New York and California, hold their
primaries.
</P>
<P>
   PLEAS FOR THAT `EXTRA EFFORT'
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley urged campaign crowds at Iowa campus rallies to
``make that extra effort in the next 24 hours'' and help him try to
spring a surprise in tonight's caucuses. ``If you think in these
times of unprecedented prosperity that there are things that we
must do that will set us on the right path for generations to come,
then I hope you will go to caucus for me tomorrow night,'' he told
hundreds at the University of Iowa. At Iowa State, he said he's
``going to surprise a lot of people across this country tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   FORBES ON THE EDGE
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes has got to do well tonight. His camp has long said
that Forbes, a distant third behind George W. Bush and John McCain,
must get a healthy share of the uncommitted vote. But the Des
Moines Register dealt him a blow. It endorsed Bush and published a
recent poll showing that Forbes, despite spending more than $25
million, has not budged from his 20 percent standing in the polls.
On the other side, the Register endorsed Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   DROPOUT WATCH IN UTAH
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, ``sounding like a presidential candidate who
knows he cannot win, nearly cried about his brother killed in World
War II as he thanked Iowa voters for turning just out to listen to
him before tonight's precinct caucuses,'' The Salt Lake Tribune
reported. The home-state newspaper said ``Hatch seems to realize
his'' campaign ``will come to an end soon.''
</P>
<P>
   THE PERILS OF AN EARLY CONCLUSION
</P>
<P>
   In the week before the first caucus, a poll by the Shorenstein
Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy found that
two-thirds of the voters were paying only a little or no attention
to the campaign, and that 70 percent said they had no favorite
candidate. If the race is declared over before they tune in, many
political observers suggest it could only further voter
disaffection and the decline in turnout.
</P>
<P>
   DUKAKIS _ REMEMBER HIM?
</P>
<P>
   Michael Dukakis returned to New Hampshire to campaign for Al
Gore, an old rival from the 1988 campaign. ``'Banging on doors in
Nashua was great fun. The people were terrific,'' he said. Dukakis
said he met a lot of old supporters. ``I met with a lot of people
who were good to Mike Dukakis,''' he said. ``There were a lot of
hugs and kisses, and reminiscing.'' Dukakis said this is his first
time back out _ not having campaigned for anyone in the Democratic
primaries in 1992 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   HEY, WHAT ABOUT ALASKA?
</P>
<P>
   With all political eyes turned to the grange halls and church
basements of Iowa, Alaska is trying to get a little piece of some
action. Today, registered Republican voters in Alaska are going to
venues across the state to vote in what is called a ``nonbinding
straw vote.'' The party's official presidential endorsement comes
in the summer at the state convention.'' The 1996 event was pretty
irrelevant: Some 9,000 voters turned out and Pat Buchanan edged
Steve Forbes 33-31 percent.
</P>
<P>
   FOR OTHERS, THOUGH, ONCE IS NEVER ENOUGH
</P>
<P>
   Flying around the country with an entourage and meeting new
people is great and all, but John McCain says plans to make this
his first and last presidential run. Unless he pulls an upset and
wins the White House, that is. ``I would never do this again. I'm
too tired,'' he told reporters on his campaign bus Sunday, as he
fueled his energy with several fists full of candy and his
umpteenth cup of coffee. ``I think it's fun once. I don't see how
it's fun twice.''
</P>
<P>
   VIRGINIA DEMOCRAT DEFECTING
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats in Congress are losing one of their own _
something sure to cheer the Republicans who hold a slim majority.
Rep. Virgil Goode, a second-term conservative Democrat from
south-central Virginia, plans to become an independent. House
Democrats reacted cautiously, with Minority Leader Dick Gephardt
saying he was ``heartened that he chose not to affiliate himself
with'' the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ASK NOT WHAT HE REMEMBERS, ASK ...
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan's daughter, Maureen, says she doesn't know if her
father even remembers being president anymore. She says her
father's Alzheimer's is worsening. But, she told NBC today the
important thing is that millions of other people remember what
Reagan did for the country.
</P>
<P>
   HUNTING FOR MORE THAN WILDLIFE
</P>
<P>
   HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo, whose father, Mario, was a
three-term governor of New York, said he's considering running for
the same office. ``I want to focus on the presidential (election),
then look at all the options,'' Cuomo said after a Sunday hunting
outing with two state legislative leaders in upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   TALKING ABOUT HOW TO TALK
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush's campaign got caught in a contradiction about
how the candidate will be made available in the future for
questioning on the issues. One spokeswoman, Mindy Tucker, said
formal meetings between reporters and Bush were being cut back
because they can harm ``the message of the day.'' Later, Bush
communications chief Karen Hughes said no, Bush would continue to
be available, but on an informal basis that befits the ``much more
drop-in, much more drop-by'' campaign style of New Hampshire.

 By JAMES R. OESTREICH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Perhaps the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra wanted to
make its new music director, the Russian conductor Yuri Temirkanov,
feel right at home amid the snows of winter. Or perhaps it is
having a hard time getting the full attention of Temirkanov, a busy
international maestro who is also the music director of the St.
Petersburg Philharmonic back home.
</P>
<P>
   Why else introduce a new music director midway through the
season rather than at its beginning? Not for either of those
reasons, said John Gidwitz, the orchestra's president.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I offered him the position three years ago, he said he
couldn't possibly take it, because he didn't have a week free until
2000,'' Gidwitz explained. ``So I said, `What are you doing in
January 2000?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Temirkanov is giving the orchestra generous amounts of time,
Gidwitz added: five weeks this season and 12 weeks plus tours in
future seasons. Temirkanov is also to open the orchestra's next
season and future seasons in alternation with St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   However odd the timing of his inauguration, the repertory was
guaranteed to make a splash: Mahler's burly ``Resurrection''
Symphony, performed on Thursday and Friday evenings and Saturday
morning at Joseph Meyerhoff Symphony Hall. The choice was doubly
interesting because Temirkanov is known in the West chiefly for his
splendid work in Russian repertory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the reasons he wanted to come here, to be able to
conduct other things,'' Gidwitz said of the maestro, who still
speaks little English. ``He does so much touring with the St.
Petersburg, and everyone wants to hear them in Russian music. But
he is not simply a great  &UR; Russian &LR;  conductor, he is a great
conductor, period.''
</P>
<P>
   There could be little argument on the basis of the performance
on Saturday. True, a sympathy for Mahler comes as no surprise from
this denizen of Shostakovich's world, which is, after all, modeled
partly on Mahler's. But the change of pace brought elements of
Temirkanov's mastery into clearer relief.
</P>
<P>
   What struck a listener here, as before in Shostakovich,
Rachmaninoff and Tchaikovsky, was Temirkanov's immense patience.
This is a quality perhaps insufficiently sought or valued among
conductors.
</P>
<P>
   Whether in Shostakovich's Seventh Symphony or in Mahler's
``Resurrection,'' few conductors show more care for or confidence
in the long line of the music.
</P>
<P>
   Temirkanov does not try to manufacture excitement at every
moment, choosing instead to savor atmosphere, color and detail. And
he steadfastly avoids anticlimax, preferring to let a movement or
even a whole big piece build to a single majestic peak that
subsumes the rest.
</P>
<P>
   The danger is that if that single event fails by even a little
in its timing or impact, the effect of the whole will suffer, too,
or misfire altogether.
</P>
<P>
   But here Temirkanov carried a listener along on a leisurely but
captivating stroll through the first four movements and built to a
glorious climax in the choral culmination of the fifth, shattering
in its emotional impact because it brought the whole, long journey
into a new, sharp focus in a flash.
</P>
<P>
   Such a revelatory experience _ not to be expected of any maestro
every week or in all repertory _ makes clear that while music may
work only in the present, that present can somehow also incorporate
the past. It is a mysterious process not unlike that when the
present reworks the past, as one rehears and re-evaluates a
performance in memory, moments, hours or days after the fact.
</P>
<P>
   To achieve such powerful results took excellent work from the
orchestra, the Baltimore Symphony Chorus and the vocal soloists,
Janice Chandler and Nancy Maultsby.
</P>
<P>
   The orchestra, which was directed from 1985 to 1998 by David
Zinman, clearly remains in fine shape overall, and Temirkanov has
already begun to shape its future, overseeing five sets of
auditions in the whirlwind days leading up to his inauguration.
</P>
<P>
   So his commitment appears to be all that any orchestra could
want, and his repertory and style seem an interesting complement to
Zinman's.
</P>
<P>
   But it is in the nature of complementarity that Zinman's areas
of special interest and expertise _ older, newer and American music
_ may not prove particular strengths of Temirkanov.
</P>
<P>
   However that may be, the Baltimore Symphony has used a
portentous turn of the calendar to its advantage, entering its own
fascinating and, to judge from the beginning, exciting new era.

</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BERLIN _ Suggesting a system of secret financing far greater
than previously acknowledged, an audit of Germany's Christian
Democratic Union on Monday revealed more than $6.3 million in
illicit contributions under former Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
</P>
<P>
   The audit, by Ernst &AMP; Young, offered no new clues on the sources
of the payments, which Kohl has refused to reveal. But it showed
that the $1 million that the former chancellor has admitted
receiving between 1993 and 1998 followed earlier and much larger
payments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are facing a test of our existence,'' Wolfgang Schaeuble,
the party leader said. However, in a clear change of political
tack, he indicated that Kohl remained central to the party's
future, and praising Kohl's achievements, urged him to remain in
the heart of the party and ruled out any lawsuits against him.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Schaeuble suggested that the party might try to use
legal means to compel Kohl to obey the law that says the source of
any contribution over $10,500 must be declared. But party leaders
are leery of pressing the issue because the former chancellor's
popularity remains high among many Germans.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the party faces a delicate political dilemma: It
must assuage the anger of young party activists by showing
determination to clear up the scandal while not vilifying the man
at the root of it because he is revered by the party old guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be ridiculous if we tried to sue Helmut Kohl to
reveal information he has,'' Schaeuble said. ``We hope that Helmut
Kohl remains in the center of our party.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued, ``We hope that Mr. Kohl chooses to speak openly of
what he knows. We also hope to find an explanation for this
situation through our investigations. We do not, however, plan to
pursue any civil legal action against Mr. Kohl.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthias Wissmann, the party treasurer, said the auditors found
$1.1 million from unexplained sources on party accounts for the
period from 1993 to 1998. This sum is slightly higher than the $1
million that Kohl has admitted receiving in that period while
refusing to name the donors.
</P>
<P>
   But the audit, ordered in haste after the party's financing
first came under close scrutiny last November, also revealed an
additional $5.2 million in mysterious contributions for the period
between 1989 and 1992.
</P>
<P>
   This earlier period corresponded to that of German unification,
when Kohl was eager to extend his party's power into the formerly
communist east of the country and needed money to do so. It was
also a time of frenzied business activity, with many West German
firms scouring the east for possible acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   The sums identified Monday did not include about $7 million that
the party branch in the state of Hesse has said it found in
overseas bank accounts without being able to explain its source. In
all, the Christian Democratic party has therefore admitted to the
existence of more than $13 million in illicit funds.
</P>
<P>
   Schaeuble said that the party had decided to take legal action
against an accountant named Horst Weyrauch, who was close to Kohl
and a central figure in party finances during the Christian
Democrat rule that ended in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``The findings of the auditors point towards unacceptable
conduct on the party of the Christian Democratic Party,'' he said.
``We will exhaust all legal means to get Mr. Weyrauch to tell what
he knows.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the party has decided to try to circumvent
attacking Kohl by forcing his closest financial aide to reveal what
he knows. The calculation is clearly that this approach will carry
a lower political price.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the party forced Kohl to give up his post as honorary
chairman. But the former chancellor, who says his honor precludes
him from identifying people to whom he promised anonymity, has
since received an ecstatic reception at a party meeting in Bremen.
</P>
<P>
   While many younger Germans have been appalled by Kohl's conduct,
older and more conservative members of the party are angry at what
they see as a conspiracy to discredit a great statesman.
</P>
<P>
   Schaeuble said that, ``All Germany falters when the Christian
Democratic Union, the party of the middle, falters. Germany needs
Christian Democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   His statement clearly reflected widespread concern that if this
party of the moderate right that had governed for 33 postwar years
should begin to disintegrate like the Christian Democratic party in
Italy, more nationalist and extremist movements of the right would
benefit.
</P>
<P>
   As long as Kohl maintains his silence, the party seems likely to
suffer. Speculation is rife that he took money in exchange for
business favors, although he has resolutely denied taking bribes.
All the money, Kohl has said, was used to reinforce the party.

PERSONAL HEALTH: WITH TYLENOL AND CHILDREN, OVERDOSING IS
PERILOUSLY EASY

<TEXT>
<P>
   Let me start with the bottom line: the pain and fever reliever
acetaminophen, popularly called Tylenol, its first over-the-counter
trade name, is a very safe drug for children as well as for adults.
But as with any medication, the dose makes the poison. And with
acetaminophen, which has properly replaced aspirin as the drug most
often given to infants and children, there is a relatively small
window of safety.
</P>
<P>
   In infants and small children, studies have indicated that the
toxic dose is less than twice the recommended dose. Studies have
also shown that it is very easy to mistakenly give children too
much acetaminophen and, as a result, endanger their lives and their
health.
</P>
<P>
   Acetaminophen was actually introduced into the pharmacopeia
before aspirin. But it was not sold without a prescription before
1960, and until quite recently it played second fiddle to aspirin
as a treatment for pain and fever. Unlike aspirin, acetaminophen
does not relieve inflammation and thus is less effective in
relieving pain caused by inflammation.
</P>
<P>
   Then researchers discovered that aspirin, given to children with
flu, chicken pox or any viral illness, could increase the risk of
the potentially fatal Reye's syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   To be safe, pediatricians now strongly caution against giving
aspirin to children or young adults (up to 20) with fever,
regardless of its cause. As hoped, the incidence of Reye's declined
sharply since acetaminophen replaced aspirin for children.
</P>
<P>
   Another advantage of acetaminophen is that, unlike aspirin, it
does not cause gastrointestinal irritation or bleeding. And a study
of 28,130 children given acetaminophen failed to find such serious
side effects as kidney failure or allergic shock, which in rare
cases can result from aspirin use.
</P>
<P>
   But as Dr. James E. Heubi (pronounced HIGH-bee), pediatrics
professor at the University of Cincinnati, said in an article last
month in Contemporary Pediatrics, ``Despite its recognized safety
in appropriate therapeutic doses, there are at least three
circumstances in which acetaminophen may be toxic:''
</P>
<P>
   _ When an intentional overdose is taken by someone who is
suicidal.
</P>
<P>
   _ When an unintentional overdose is given, as in multiple doses
of acetaminophen in excess of the amount recommended on the label.
</P>
<P>
   _ When an inadvertent overdose is given to a child who is
treated with acetaminophen for a fever and with a cough-and-cold
preparation that contains acetaminophen.
</P>
<P>
   An excess of acetaminophen at any age can seriously damage the
liver and cause liver failure and death. Attempts to commit suicide
by taking too much acetaminophen are now usually thwarted by an
antidote called N-acetylcysteine, or Mucomyst, which can prevent
serious liver damage when given within 24 hours. Still, what Heubi
calls ``therapeutic misadventures'' by the well-intentioned still
occur and can result in the need for liver transplants or death.
</P>
<P>
   Although relatively few cases of liver damage caused by
accidental overdoses of acetaminophen in children have been
published or reported to health agencies, Heubi believes that the
official number of 55 is probably a ``gross underestimate'' of the
total.
</P>
<P>
   ``My personal observation, based on conversations with
physicians at liver transplant centers,'' he said, ``is that
doctors often see liver failure associated with multiple excess
doses of acetaminophen, though most cases are not reported in the
literature or to the Food and Drug Administration, and that many
less severely affected patients go unreported as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Acetaminophen is sold in many forms: concentrated drops for
infants, a less-concentrated liquid and chewable tablets for
children and higher-dose tablets and capsules for adults. Besides
Tylenol, brand names include Feverall, Panadol and Tempra. There
are also generic and store brands. In addition, varying amounts of
acetaminophen are found in combination products sold to treat
coughs and colds in children and more than a dozen such products
for adults.
</P>
<P>
   There are many ways children can end up with dangerous amounts
of acetaminophen in the blood. Let's say a child has a fever from a
respiratory illness. The child may be given too much of the
concentrated infant drops or of the liquid marketed for children
or, in the case of an older child, tablets meant for adults. Or, in
addition to an appropriate dose to reduce fever, the child may be
given a cough and cold medicine that contains more acetaminophen.
</P>
<P>
   When an overdose reaches toxic levels, a child will become
lethargic and nauseated and will vomit. By then, liver damage may
have already occurred. In cases of serious damage, the child should
be immediately taken to a hospital that does liver transplants.
</P>
<P>
   To reduce the risk of overdoses, Heubi recommends that parents
use only the liquid version for children of all ages. It is crucial
to follow the label, use no more than recommended based on weight
and age, and give no more than five doses within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   However, Heubi noted that the label language on many
over-the-counter products like acetaminophen might ``exceed the
reading comprehension of as many as 50 percent of parents.'' A
study by six pediatricians at the University of Rochester revealed
that mothers were often mistaken in what they considered an
appropriate dose of acetaminophen. And in another study among 100
people who were told a child's weight and given dosing instructions
by weight, only two in five were able to determine the correct dose
and only two-thirds were able to measure the dose correctly. Thus,
had the drug actually been given, 70 percent would have been given
the wrong dose.
</P>
<P>
   The risk of acetaminophen overdoses would also be reduced if
parents recognized fever as a way the body controls infections.
Unless it is higher than 102, a fever is best left untreated. And,
for high fevers, rather than giving too much acetaminophen, sponge
baths should be used.

SUPREME COURT LOOMS AS BIG PRIZE IN 2000 ELECTION 
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds: Sean Loughlin is a correspondent for the Washington Bureau of
the NYT Regional Newspapers Group.)

 By SEAN LOUGHLIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the likelihood that the next president will
appoint new justices, the Supreme Court looms as a flash point in
the 2000 race and could draw both diehard conservatives and
liberals to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Activists of every ideological stripe are already telling their
followers one of two things: either their cherished rights are in
jeopardy or their long-sought goals are within tantalizing reach.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Christians talk openly of their desire to reverse
Roe vs. Wade, the court decision that legalized abortion. Abortion
rights advocates warn of the same thing. Proponents of gay rights,
government aid to parochial schools, affirmative action and
expanded police powers believe the nation's highest court has the
potential to be either a cherished ally or formidable foe _
depending on how future justices rule on these contentious matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the sleeper issue of the campaign,'' said Clint Bollick,
litigation director at the conservative Institute for Justice.
``Whoever is elected president will have a twofer: He will not only
have the presidency, but the judiciary as well. It is of enormous
importance.''
</P>
<P>
   That point was underscored last week in Iowa by Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas, the Republican front-runner, who criticized Roe vs.
Wade, saying it had usurped the rights of state legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court could be particularly significant this year _
as compared to other election years _ for several reasons. First,
after almost eight years of Democratic rule in the White House,
Republicans are desperate to get another chance at shaping the
federal judiciary, especially the ideological bent of the nation's
highest court. The open-seat race for the presidency gives them
their best chance.
</P>
<P>
   Second, there are several justices whose advancing years have
court observers speculating that as many as four vacancies could
occur over the course of a two-term presidency. The average age on
the nine-member court is 66. The three oldest members are Justice
John Paul Stevens, Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justice
Sandra Day O'Connor, who this year turn 80, 76 and 70 respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Third, the nine-member Court has emerged as sharply divided on
several key issues, such as states rights, and 5-4 decisions have
become commonplace. A new justice could quickly alter that balance.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the Court recently accepted some high-profile cases.
Decisions on partial-birth abortion and gay rights could dominate
the headlines this summer just as the conventions heat up the
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be one of the issues that divides the two
candidates very starkly,'' said Kate Michelman, president of the
National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League. Michelman
said her group would highlight the importance of the Supreme Court
in coming months through mass mailings and advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next president holds in his hand the future of the Supreme
Court, the future of Roe v. Wade and the future of a woman's right
to choose,'' she said. ``This is not going to be abstract. This
will have an impact on American lives.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Supreme Court as a campaign issue has engaged
political activists, some are not so sure it will resonate with the
general public. They believe voters will respond to candidates'
personalities and pocketbook issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's something that becomes a front-burner issue
for the general electorate,'' said Ralph Reed, a Republican
political consultant and former director of the Christian
Coalition. ``It's something that's primarily communicated within
your base.''
</P>
<P>
   Presidential contenders are already grappling with questions
about the Supreme Court. At debates in New Hampshire and Iowa, the
men vying for the Republican presidential nomination have been
queried about whether they would appoint pro-life judges to the
bench. Bush has said he would not impose a litmus test, but
Michelman believes he would favor judges opposed to abortion.
</P>
<P>
   As they criticize Democrats, other GOP candidates have also
acknowledged the importance of the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``The country will drastically change if Al Gore or Bill Bradley
becomes the president of the United States,'' said Sen. Orrin
Hatch, R-Utah. Speaking to reporters in New Hampshire, Hatch, the
chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which considers all
federal judicial nominations, continued: ``Many of these liberals
want to use the court ... to pass their agenda that they could
never get through Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, Vice President Al Gore and former Sen.
Bill Bradley were recently asked whether either would appoint the
first Hispanic to the nation's highest court. While both men spoke
of their commitment to diversity, neither made that pledge.
</P>
<P>
   Supreme Court appointments are one of the true legacies any
president can leave. Justices serve lifetimes appointments. Their
rulings can touch on virtually all aspects of American life,
ranging from where parents send their children to school to privacy
protections in an increasingly technological world.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Neas, president of the liberal People for the American
Way, put it this way: ``The next president could nominate as many
as three or four Supreme Court justices, and that could determine
what the law of the land will be for a couple of generations.''

 &HT;    Directors Jonze, Mendes among award nominees
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two first-time directors (Spike Jonze and Sam Mendes) and other
lesser-known filmmakers are this year's nominees for the Directors
Guild of America awards, announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The nominees:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Frank Darabont for ``The Green Mile,'' a mystical death-row
drama. It's the second film Darabont adapted from a Stephen King
story; the first, 1994's ``The Shawshank Redemption,'' earned him
his first DGA nomination.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Jonze for ``Being John Malkovich,'' a literally cerebral
fantasy about a group of people who want to live permanently in the
title actor's brain.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Michael Mann for ``The Insider,'' a drama about the struggle
between a ``60 Minutes'' producer and his network to broadcast an
expose about big tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Mendes for ``American Beauty,'' a suburban black comedy that
won the director a Golden Globe on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  M. Night Shyamalan for ``The Sixth Sense,'' a film of his own
screenplay about a psychiatrist and a ghost-seeing boy, which
turned into one of the year's surprise box-office hits.
</P>
<P>
   While they've been honored with awards from other critics'
groups, Neil Jordan (``The End of the Affair''), Milos Forman
(``Man on the Moon''), Anthony Minghella (``The Talented Mr.
Ripley'') and Mike Leigh (``Topsy Turvy'') didn't make the grade.
Nor did Paul Thomas Anderson, whose ``Magnolia'' continues to
divide audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Shyamalan could be considered an honorary first-timer, though
this is his third film. His culture-clash drama ``Praying With
Anger'' made only the festival rounds, while his cloying Catholic
drama ``Wide Awake'' was barely released in theaters.
</P>
<P>
   The DGA award is announced March 11. The DGA winner almost
always takes home the directing Oscar as well. Since 1949, the DGA
and Oscar have differed only four times in their choice of
director.
</P>
<P>
   The winning director's film usually gets the best picture
statuette as well. Last year, Steven Spielberg won the DGA and an
Oscar for ``Saving Private Ryan,'' but his war drama lost the top
Academy Award to ``Shakespeare in Love.''
</P>
<P>
   The Oscars are March 26.

 &HT;    Quindlen: Rocker free to talk like a jerk
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anna Quindlen weighs in on the athlete's foot-in-mouth disease
that plagues John Rocker in her Newsweek ($3.95) column this week.
She makes the refreshing observation that athletes are no more or
less than ordinary human beings. Unfortunately, she adds, we have
elevated athletes to a position high above mere mortals and excused
them for everything from drug use to sexual assault. In the case of
Rocker, she says, he was exercising his right to talk like a jerk.
``Why in the world does anyone think this man is worth listening
to, much less worth excoriating. His career has the shelf life of a
carton of milk; like most professional athletes he is one torn
rotator cuff away from obscurity.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Talking: Tina Brown's experiment with a multiple-imaged,
European-style cover at Talk ($3.50) is over. The new issue
features a single image of Leonardo DiCaprio and a more traditional
design inside. It's an improvement, but the magazine still has the
appearance of a cafeteria line. This month's articles include
everything from the typical celebrity interview with DiCaprio to a
troubling article by Lucinda Franks on the sex lives of middle
school kids. In between are articles on Wilt Chamberlain, Helen
Morris (Mrs. Martin Scorsese) and Carla Del Ponte, the woman who is
trying to bring Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to justice.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Hell hath no fury? In an article bound to spark debate, U.S.
News &AMP; World Report ($3.95) presents a different view of Hades than
the fire-and-brimstone version of 18th-century revivalist Jonathan
Edwards. Correspondent Jeffery L. Sheler discusses a recent article
in the Jesuit magazine La Civilta Catolica that speculates that
Hell is not a place but a ``state'' where a person suffers from the
deprivation of God. Conservatives disagree, but a poll conducted by
U.S. News &AMP; World Report indicates that 53 percent of Americans
believe in the less fiery revised version.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Primary primer: With the political campaigns heating up, The
New Yorker ($3) focuses on George W. Bush, Bill Bradley, the New
Hampshire primary and the also-ran Republicans. Nicholas Lemann
delves into Bush's life and decides that the real story is more
than one of redemption. The governor's ``Texas-size sense of fun is
an essential part of his appeal,'' Lemann says. Columnist Joe
Klein, meanwhile, examines the dim futures of Gary Bauer and Alan
Keyes.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Literary giant: Doubletake ($10) offers a fascinating,
previously unpublished interview with the late Walker Percy. Amid
the author's musings on philosophy and literature is the revelation
that his favorite TV show was ``The Incredible Hulk.'' Says Percy:
``It united two great literary traditions: rotation (hitting the
road, dropping out, adventures) and the good monster (Beauty's
beast), who is also Lancelot.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Quick reads: With the exception of The Globe ($1.59), the
supermarket tabloids are strangely silent on the matter of Ted
Turner and Jane Fonda's marital separation this week. Using unnamed
sources, The Globe reports that Turner took 50-year-old Frederique
D'Arragon to his New Mexico ranch aboard his private plane. Blurry
photographs purportedly show D'Arragon boarding the plane with
Turner. ... Benjamin Bratt tells W ($3.95) that his relationship
with Julia Roberts works because he sees her as the woman he loves
instead of a superstar celebrity.

 &HT;    NFL maestro Steeg has toughest job in football
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Worried that no one's coming to your annual Super Bowl
party this year? Too much avocado in the guacamole last year? Not
enough seats in front of the big-screen television?
</P>
<P>
   Try walking in Jim Steeg's shoes for a day. On Sunday, Steeg is
throwing a party for the 21st year in a row.
</P>
<P>
   It's called the Super Bowl, and more than 70,000 people are
expected to attend the gala at the Georgia Dome. Country music
stars Travis Tritt and Faith Hill and pop diva Tina Turner will
perform.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, there also will be a pro football game, which will be
watched by an estimated 800 million television viewers in 188
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Just don't call Steeg a party-planner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like going to parties,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   As the NFL's senior vice president for special events, Steeg is
the maestro of the Super Bowl, the world's largest single-day
sporting event.
</P>
<P>
   It seems appropriate for the son of a Purdue engineering
professor who helped design the Saturn 5 rocket that landed on the
moon.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always talk about dumb jocks in football, so you figure
that you don't need a rocket scientist to run a football game,''
said Robert Dale Morgan, president of the Atlanta Super Bowl Host
Committee. ``Well, in this case, you've just got to be the son of
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Steeg, 49, was born in Boston and raised in Fort Wayne, Ind. He
attended Miami University in Ohio, and later earned an MBA in
finance at Wake Forest, graduating fourth in his class.
</P>
<P>
   Desperate for a job in sports, Steeg wrote a letter to every
professional team in America seeking employment. In 1975, he was
hired as an accountant by the Miami Dolphins and within four years
was hired as the team's business manager.
</P>
<P>
   When Joe Robbie, who owned the Dolphins then, replaced him with
one of his sons in January 1979, Steeg got the break that changed
his life. Two days after Steeg lost his job, NFL commissioner Pete
Rozelle hired him as the league's first director of administration.
</P>
<P>
   Only 28, Steeg didn't realize the magnitude of the position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rozelle didn't even define what the job was going to be,''
Steeg said. ``I didn't know how big the job was or what Pete had in
mind. He either wasn't sure what it was going to be, or he didn't
want to upset the people that were down there working on the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   What Steeg got was the toughest job in sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a perfectionist, but I've learned to live without
perfection,'' he says. ``I'm never really satisfied. Surfers know
that the perfect wave is rare. Major-league baseball players know
how difficult and special it is to pitch a perfect game. And deep
down, I realize that 95 percent is still an `A.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Steeg still does his homework. Since Jan. 8, he has been living
in a suite in an Atlanta hotel. Until this month, he spent one week
per month in Atlanta for the past year. A New Jersey resident, he
estimates his Super Bowl team has tallied more than 1,500 nights
here since February.
</P>
<P>
   Steeg begins planning a Super Bowl months before the city is
awarded a bid. The NFL usually awards Super Bowls at least four
years in advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see them from beginning to end,'' Steeg said. ``You go
through the whole pregnancy and see the birth.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly everything that is required to put on the game _ lodging,
transportation, security, entertainment, concessions _ comes across
Steeg's desk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim has a similar management style to what Rozelle did,'' said
Bob Best, a member of Steeg's Super Bowl team who has produced the
pre-game show for 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rozelle had wonderful ideas, and he found people who would
implement those ideas and build on them,'' Best said. ``Jim has
done that. I never seem to be amazed at the enormity of this event.
He just does an unbelievable job of orchestrating it.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Steeg's biggest role is that of troubleshooter. In more
than two decades, he has seen it all.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982 at Super Bowl XVI, an ice storm hit Detroit three days
before the game, covering streets with ice and backing up pipes at
the hotels.
</P>
<P>
   On Super Bowl Sunday, George Bush's vice presidential motorcade
backed up traffic as it made its way to the Pontiac Silverdome.
Bush had been a college roommate of Lions owner William Clay Ford.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Steeg wrote a memo listing 18 reasons why the
traffic plan failed. Among them were a bus fire and refusal by
police to get out of their cars because of the weather.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988 at Super Bowl XXII in San Diego, the hotel housing the
NFL headquarters didn't have enough hot water for early-morning
showers. Steeg purchased an enormous water heater from the Navy and
had it flown in by helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that continues to amaze me is the fact that he has
such a great perspective for the big picture and the long term,''
Morgan said. ``But at the same time, he's concerned about every
single meticulous detail in the here and now. He's globally
thinking about where the game should be played three or four years
from now, and, at the same time, he's concerned that the tickets
don't look exactly right.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1991 at Super Bowl XXV in Tampa, Steeg was making his final
rounds through a deserted Giants locker room. He discovered the
Lombardi Trophy, given to the winning team in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called (Giants general manager) George Young, and I said,
`Are you guys missing anything?' '' Steeg said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995 at Super Bowl XXIX in Miami, Steeg received a telephone
call from a parking valet at the NFL headquarters hotel. The
attendant told Steeg that a courtesy car had just been turned in _
from Super Bowl XXVI in Minneapolis, Minn., three years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know who had it,'' Steeg said. ``It just got turned
in, and the guy walked away.''
</P>
<P>
   Best and other colleagues say Steeg knows how to throw an
incredible party because he keeps the average fans' interests at
heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim, more than anything else, is a sports fan,'' Best said.
``He does the stuff that the average fan on the street would do.
He's in fantasy football leagues and collects trading cards. He's
just a real sports fan.''
</P>
<P>
   And, apparently, a realistic one.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is supposed to be fun,'' Steeg says. ``For the players
and coaches, it's life or death. But we're not electing a
president, and this isn't the end of the earth. It's a football
game. If things don't go right, we'll play it again next year.''

 &HT;    BLACK PHYSICIANS SAY MANAGED-CARE PLAN RACIALLY BIASED

   WASHINGTON _ Managed-care plans nationwide are excluding black
physicians the National Medical Association announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The NMA, the largest and oldest national organization
representing black physicians and health professionals in the
United States, wants Congress to enact laws that will prevent
exclusionary practices based on race.
</P>
<P>
   The association, which has more than 25,000 members, said the
exclusion limits black patients' choice of selecting black
physicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``This practice is not only racist, but ultimately compromises
patient care,'' said Dr. Gary C. Dennis, NMA's immediate past
president.
</P>
<P>
   Some members called for protests by black doctors and patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what we need to do is go back to the 60s-style
demonstrations. It has worked in the past for us,'' said Dr. Lenox
S. Dingle Jr., a general surgeon who lives and practices in
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Pisano, a spokeswoman for the American Association of
Health Plans, said her organization doesn't know enough about the
NMA's claims but would like to find out more and address the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding black doctors would be senseless because it works
against the health plan industry, she added. The industry wants to
have as many patients as possible, and turning away black doctors
would cause it to lose black patients who prefer black physicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Health plans are in the position to recruit more minority
physicians since they are in demand,'' Pisano said.
</P>
<P>
   When black physicians apply to join HMO panels, managed
health-care corporations often say their services are not needed,
Dingle said. Others are told that ``we have signed exclusive
contracts,'' or ``we have enough (doctors) in your area.''
</P>
<P>
   In Maryland, for example, several doctors confronted the panels
directly through the Maryland Association of HMOs. They were told
that the corporations are not concerned with the racial make-up of
their panels, he said.
</P>
<P>
   HMOs also exclude black physicians by claiming they lack proper
credentials, even though the HMOs have not explicitly defined their
criteria, Dingle said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, HMOs claim that there is not enough demand for
black doctors in black communities, Dingle said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result, some of our physicians have ceased to be able to
practice medicine, others forced to relocate, and others are
discouraged from establishing practices in the (black
communities),'' he added, exacerbating an already desperate
shortage of doctors in black communities.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   A recent study, co-authored by NMA member Dr. Lisa
Cooper-Patrick, showed that black patients participate in
health-care decisions less than whites because of the race of their
physicians. She said black patients relate better to black
physicians and there is greater chance of miscommunication between
patients and physicians when they are of different races. That
often leads to misunderstandings regarding the cause of certain
diseases and effective treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the study, ``we have an understanding that the better
the doctor-patient relationship, the better the treatment
overall,'' said Cooper-Patrick, assistant professor of medicine and
health policy and management at the Johns Hopkins Medical
Institutions.

CONGO VOWS TO COOPERATE WITH U.N. TO END CIVIL WAR
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Confronting an array of African leaders at a
special Security Council session on Monday, the president of Congo,
Laurent Kabila, pledged to cooperate with international efforts to
end a civil war in his country now involving troops from more than
half a dozen nations.
</P>
<P>
   But he also took the opportunity to trade bitter accusations
with former regional allies who have sent soldiers to back a
rebellion against him. Both sides demonstrated the rancor that
surrounds the issue and has stalled a six-month-old peace
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila, making his first trip to the United States, is taking
part in several days of high-level discussions on how to put the
peace pact into effect and back it with a United Nations
peacekeeping operation for Congo. He was one of seven African
presidents who spoke on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, represented Monday by Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright, will have to sell the idea to Congress,
which has reservations about another expensive mission with no
promise of success. In fact, the administration has agreed to
notify Congress about any future peacekeeping operation before
voting for it here.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, presiding over the council, spoke in graphic terms
about the level to which the Congo war _ which she called
``Africa's first world war'' _ has descended.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most disturbing aspect of the conflict,'' she told the
council, ``has been the horrific abuse of fundamental human rights
by all sides. We have even heard credible reports recently of women
being buried alive in the eastern Congo. There is no rationale of
past grievance, political allegiance or ethnic difference that
excuses murder, torture, rape or other abuse. Here, today, we must
vow to halt these crimes and to bring those who commit them to
justice under due process of law.''
</P>
<P>
   Kabila, on the defensive after delaying the groundwork of United
Nations military liaison officials for months, said that a
``misunderstanding'' had blocked their deployment but that this had
been corrected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should like to say in all sincerity,'' Kabila told the
Security Council, ``that you can count on me and my delegation to
discuss openly and seriously, ways and means of putting an end to
this tragic war so that together we can rebuild a region so that
our countries can live in peace.''
</P>
<P>
   But the level of venom remained high when Kabila characterized
his enemies, whom he named as Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi, as
``former allies who are today invading my country.'' He accused
them of a range of crimes from forced recruitment of exiled ethnic
Hutu and the plundering of diamonds, cobalt, gold and zebras in
Congo territory. He also blamed rebels for destroying polio
vaccines so that 6 million children could not be vaccinated.
</P>
<P>
   President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, who supports Kabila with
troops, called the Congo conflict ``a war that never should have
taken place,'' and he blamed a lack of consultation in Africa for
letting it grow out of control.
</P>
<P>
   But he also made the most impassioned call for international
help. He said that the Security Council should have acted long ago
to send in peacekeepers. He accused members of lethargy and ``foot
dragging.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We now say the time has come for prompt action,'' he said.
``The Security Council still has an opportunity to redeem itself.''

   Richard Holbrooke, the American representative, has said in
recent weeks that it is necessary to get any mission right before
starting it or the Congo will be added to a list of United Nations
failures.
</P>
<P>
   Security Council members have started to work on a resolution
creating a peacekeeping force for Congo, while also supervising a
military mission in Sierra Leone. The United Nations is also
involved in trying to defuse a renewed crisis in Burundi and end a
standoff between Eritrea and Ethiopia, among other crises.

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Congo war has its roots in the civil wars between ethnic
Tutsi and Hutu in Burundi and Rwanda in 1993 and 1994 and the huge
flow of refugees into what was then Zaire after genocidal attacks
on Tutsi by Hutu in Rwanda. Those attacks were followed by the
flight of Hutu when a Tutsi-led army took power in Rwanda several
months later. In the midst of the ensuing confusion, Kabila began
his rebellion against Zaire's dictator, Mobutu Sese Seko. By May
1997, Kabila, then with the backing of Rwanda and Uganda, had
seized power in the Zairean capital, Kinshasa and reverted to
calling the nation Congo.
</P>
<P>
   As one cycle of war led to the next in eastern Congo, where Hutu
exiles still operate, the Tutsi-led governments of Rwanda and
Burundi, along with Uganda, switched loyalties and now support
rebels against Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary-General Kofi Annan turned the spotlight back on
Africans in his opening speech. ``The entire subregion has been
engulfed in a crisis of such complexity that it continues to defy
our best efforts to solve it,'' he said. ``On a long list of needs,
wisdom and statesmanship, as well as an understanding of the limits
of the use of force, are at the top.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Annan recommended that 500 cease-fire observers be
sent to Congo, with 5,000 troops to back them up. But diplomats are
wary of authorizing any troops or monitors until all sides in the
war honor their promises to observe the cease-fire they agreed to
in July.
</P>
<P>
   The African presidents who spoke at Monday's council session
were, in addition to Kabila and Mugabe, Frederick Chiluba of
Zambia; Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique, who holds the rotating
presidency of the Organization of African Unity; Jose Eduardo do
Santos of Angola; Yoweri Museveni of Uganda; and Pasteur Bizimungu
of Rwanda. Rwanda's defense minister and the strongest figure in
the government, Paul Kagame, did not attend. Some diplomats say
that he will have to be a central player in bringing peace to
Congo.

 &HT;    BLACK PHYSICIANS SAY MANAGED-CARE PLAN RACIALLY BIASED
 &HT;    (400&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    Moving in both (w) Washington and (l) Lifestyle categories.
 &HT;    By ISMAIL TURAY JR. 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Managed-care plans nationwide are excluding black
physicians the National Medical Association announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The NMA, the largest and oldest national organization
representing black physicians and health professionals in the
United States, wants Congress to enact laws that will prevent
exclusionary practices based on race.
</P>
<P>
   The association, which has more than 25,000 members, said the
exclusion limits black patients' choice of selecting black
physicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``This practice is not only racist, but ultimately compromises
patient care,'' said Dr. Gary C. Dennis, NMA's immediate past
president.
</P>
<P>
   Some members called for protests by black doctors and patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what we need to do is go back to the 60s-style
demonstrations. It has worked in the past for us,'' said Dr. Lenox
S. Dingle Jr., a general surgeon who lives and practices in
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Pisano, a spokeswoman for the American Association of
Health Plans, said her organization doesn't know enough about the
NMA's claims but would like to find out more and address the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding black doctors would be senseless because it works
against the health plan industry, she added. The industry wants to
have as many patients as possible, and turning away black doctors
would cause it to lose black patients who prefer black physicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Health plans are in the position to recruit more minority
physicians since they are in demand,'' Pisano said.
</P>
<P>
   When black physicians apply to join HMO panels, managed
health-care corporations often say their services are not needed,
Dingle said. Others are told that ``we have signed exclusive
contracts,'' or ``we have enough (doctors) in your area.''
</P>
<P>
   In Maryland, for example, several doctors confronted the panels
directly through the Maryland Association of HMOs. They were told
that the corporations are not concerned with the racial make-up of
their panels, he said.
</P>
<P>
   HMOs also exclude black physicians by claiming they lack proper
credentials, even though the HMOs have not explicitly defined their
criteria, Dingle said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, HMOs claim that there is not enough demand for
black doctors in black communities, Dingle said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result, some of our physicians have ceased to be able to
practice medicine, others forced to relocate, and others are
discouraged from establishing practices in the (black
communities),'' he added, exacerbating an already desperate
shortage of doctors in black communities.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   A recent study, co-authored by NMA member Dr. Lisa
Cooper-Patrick, showed that black patients participate in
health-care decisions less than whites because of the race of their
physicians. She said black patients relate better to black
physicians and there is greater chance of miscommunication between
patients and physicians when they are of different races. That
often leads to misunderstandings regarding the cause of certain
diseases and effective treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the study, ``we have an understanding that the better
the doctor-patient relationship, the better the treatment
overall,'' said Cooper-Patrick, assistant professor of medicine and
health policy and management at the Johns Hopkins Medical
Institutions.

 &HT;    Internet site of the week
 &HT;    By M.A.J. McKenna
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Searching for health information on the Internet demands some
basic equipment: not just a computer and a connection, but hands to
manipulate a mouse and keyboard, eyes good enough to read a
monitor, and ears to hear the aural cues in a browser program. But
significant parts of the population have impairments to vision,
hearing or dexterity. Is the Internet _ which could educate them
about their disabilities _ closed to them?
</P>
<P>
   Not necessarily. As the community of Net users expands,
accessibility is becoming as important a consideration for Web
design as it is in the real world. One site where this is elegantly
put into action is the home page of the nonprofit Macular
Degeneration Partnership (www.macd.net).
</P>
<P>
   Macular degeneration is an age-related eye disease that affects
almost 11 percent of the U.S. population ages 65 to 74 and 28
percent of those 75 or older. It's the leading cause of vision loss
and legal blindness in senior citizens. So there's a wide potential
readership for this site, which offers thorough information about
the disorder, research into treatments and community resources.
</P>
<P>
   To make the site friendly to Web surfers whose vision might
already be impaired, the partnership has made several thoughtful
design choices: A text-only choice is labeled on the index page,
the colors are high-contrast but nonglaring, and instructions for
enlarging the font to readable sizes are given for several browser
programs.

 &HT;    It's time to stop the McNair bashing
 &HT;    By Terence Moore
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Now maybe they'll shut up about Steve McNair, but
probably not. The only way this miracle of a quarterback for the
Titans can make his critics find something more worthy to gripe
about would be if he spends Sunday inside the Georgia Dome running,
passing and inspiring his team past the Rams to a world
championship.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, they'd find something. They'll always find something
when it comes to McNair, and you can blame it on the black
quarterback thing, the small college thing or the defiant thing.
</P>
<P>
   As for the latter, so many folks have made a career out of
blasting McNair that they refuse to remove their blinders. I can't
blame them. They might have to squint after seeing his brilliant
ways.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with the bottom line: 12-2. That's the Titans'
record since McNair returned from back surgery earlier this season.
He also ignored an aching toe on his left foot Sunday against the
Jaguars to rush for 91 yards during the Titans' 33-14 romp to the
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the McNair bashers say their favorite target spent
another game showing he is allergic to the forward pass. He threw
for only 112 yards, but there are a couple of things to consider.
First, McNair is doing what is required in the Titans' offense, and
that is handing off to the gifted Eddie George and getting out of
the way. Second, McNair delivers passes in the clutch. For
verification, check the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Jaguars, McNair kept a touchdown drive alive by
dropping into the pocket, using a stiff arm to escape a defender
and rolling to his left for a 15-yard completion. That play was in
addition to his 9-yard touchdown pass to Yancey Thigpen and another
one that was fumbled away near the goal line by Frank Wycheck.
</P>
<P>
   So much for the facts. Many prefer the fantasy that the best
position for McNair and other black quarterbacks is anywhere not
directly behind a center. While kicking and screaming, the NFL has
gone from no black quarterbacks for decades to a few this season,
but the best of the bunch still gets blasted no matter what he does
or how well he does it.
</P>
<P>
   McNair is used to this silliness by now. During his youth in
Mississippi, he was more prolific as a prep quarterback than Archie
Manning or Brett Favre. It didn't matter. Only Alcorn State would
allow McNair to play quarterback only. He became the first player
in NCAA history to gain more than 16,000 yards in total offense.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't matter, either. McNair finished third in the 1994
Heisman Trophy race to running backs Rashaan Salaam and Ki-Jana
Carter. Why? Well, a Heisman voter for an Oklahoma City newspaper
spoke for the masses by writing that McNair would be only the
third-string quarterback at the University of Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   During that same stretch, NFL experts said the top three
quarterbacks in the upcoming draft would be Eric Zeier, Rob Johnson
and John Walsh, not exactly legends these days. As for McNair,
those same NFL experts said that Alcorn State didn't play anybody.
That he wasn't really 6 feet 3. That all he did was throw the ball
up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   The old Houston Oilers saw something different. They saw McNair
prospering at Alcorn State with no offensive line, no running game,
no special teams, no coaching, one legitimate receiver and an
illegitimate defense. They made McNair the third pick in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   Now those Oilers are these Titans, and they're four quarters
away from joining McNair in laughing last.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    We knew her first from her grief.
 &HT;    The sight of Kadiatou Diallo stepping from a police van last
February in front of 1157 Wheeler Avenue in the Bronx, seeing the
place where police officers had killed her unarmed son and
helplessly crying, ``Amadou, Amadou,'' until she collapsed in the
arms of other West African Muslim women in traditional robes, was a
haunting spectacle, replayed endlessly on television.
 &HT;    Her grief attached poignancy to what until that moment had
simply horrified: the unbelievable fusillade of bullets mistakenly
aimed at this particular dark-skinned man.
 &HT;    It let the world know that this victim was beloved, would be
missed. It focused our horror, unease and anger in the person of
one small mother from a tiny nation in Africa to whom New York had
done such a grievous wrong.
 &HT;    Next we knew her because, in short order, she moved out of the
hotel room the city had found for her and into one arranged for her
by the Rev. Al Sharpton, and then further asserted her independence
by refusing to meet with Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
 &HT;    In a flurry of interviews over six days in the United States _
and always with Sharpton _ she assailed the injustice of the
killing with apparently spontaneous lines like, ``Amadou's blood
will feed the battle for justice for everyone.''
 &HT;    Her efforts helped to crystallize an inchoate anger with the
police into a protest movement that would eventually result in the
Sharpton-orchestrated arrests at police headquarters of nearly
1,200 people, including David Dinkins, the former mayor; Kweisi
Mfume, the head of the NAACP; the Rev. Jesse Jackson; the actress
Susan Sarandon; and several members of New York's congressional
delegation _ the worst crisis of the Giuliani administration.
 &HT;    Kadi Diallo returned to Africa with her son's body, Sharpton and
a large contingent of reporters, who sent images of her loss around
the world. Six weeks later, Sharpton flew her back to New York: The
four policemen who had shot her son were being indicted on charges
of second-degree murder.
 &HT;    Following the arraignment, she began, with her son's father _
her ex-husband _ what was planned to be a 16-city tour of the
United States organized by Sharpton to decry police brutality.
 &HT;    In the meantime, her son's estate hired the O.J. Simpson ``dream
team'' of Johnnie Cochran, Barry Scheck and Peter Neufeld to pursue
a civil claim against the city that could net millions of dollars,
despite Amadou's near destitution. (Compensation in such a suit is
usually based partly on lost future earnings.)
 &HT;    And then, finally, in what appeared to be a further expression
of her poise and self-possession, this untutored mother from Guinea
fired the dream team and, after a round of very public
disagreements with her ex-husband over control of her son's estate,
in August hired a white, noncelebrity lawyer to pursue her claims.
 &HT;    ``From Grieving Mother to Forceful Celebrity,'' a New York Times
article was headlined back in April. By the end of summer, Kadi
Diallo was trying to go back to grieving mother, to bring some
closure to a healing process she had barely begun.
 &HT;    She patched things up with her ex-husband. She settled their
three remaining children near relatives on the East Coast, where
they would be close to her but insulated from the media zoo. She
distanced herself from Sharpton. And she awaited the trial that
might finally shed some light on what happened that night in front
of 1157 Wheeler Ave., in the Bronx.
 &HT;    Then came the surprise announcement of Dec. 16. The trial was
being moved to Albany. ``The public clamor'' over the case,
according to an appeals court, made a fair trial in the Bronx
impossible. Sharpton called, and she climbed into a car _ it was
time for another news conference.
 -0- 
 &HT;    The Diallo story can, in some ways, be told by its headlines:
``Cops Blast Unarmed Man''; ``1,000 Rally to Condemn Shooting of
Unarmed Man by Police''; ``A Mother Arrives From Africa to Mourn
Her Slain Son''; ``Slain Man's Mother Rejects Mayor's Aid'';
``Battle-Tested Sharpton Slips Into Familiar Role''; ``Diallo Dead,
Cops Look for Dirt''; ``Amadou Lied in His Claim for Asylum'';
``Cardinal Holds a Meeting With Parents of Diallo''; ``Diallo's Mom
Boots Dream Team''; ``Diallo's Parents Feuding Over Estate That
Could Be Worth Millions''; ``Diallo Dad Appeals to Ex-Wife for
Unity.''
 &HT;    They convey the Tom Wolfe-ian nature of the story, its tragedy
and circuslike aspects. Most ordinary people caught up in this kind
of frenzy go in energized but emerge at the end disheveled,
embittered, spent.
 &HT;    Kadiatou Diallo, in her quiet dignity, shows every sign of being
different _ a player almost preternaturally prepared to handle the
insanity, a woman who, having been used for a few months by the
media and politicians, seems to have learned enough now to use them
right back.
 &HT;    She comes from the Guinean village of Labe, the fourth of nine
children born to a prominent local family. In the archives of many
newspapers her name is misspelled ``Kadiadou,'' because one of the
first reporters she talked to, she says, misheard her, and thought
her name ended like her son's. She liked that, the melding of
Amadou's name with her own.
 &HT;    Her father, she says, was unusual, insisting on the importance
of education not just for his sons but also for his daughters,
perhaps owing to his having an outspoken wife.
 &HT;    Even as a girl she was a beauty. When she was 14, a trader from
a nearby village asked her father for her hand in marriage. Her
father said he couldn't answer for Kadi: ``Go and talk to my
daughter first,'' he told Saikou Diallo, 30, a man who already had
a wife and two children. ``I don't want to give you any hope before
you do.''
 &HT;    Kadi was unsure but willing. She is proud now that her father
insisted that as a condition of marriage she be allowed to continue
her education.
 &HT;    Amadou, the first of their four children, was born two years
later, when she was 16. ``I was very young, and I thought I was too
young to keep him,'' she told Newsday. ``At night, I woke up to see
if he was there.''
 &HT;    As a boy, Amadou developed a lisp. His mispronunciation of her
name became a treasured nickname. ``Tatatou,'' he called her.
 &HT;    By then the family was living in neighboring Liberia, where
Saikou had a trading business. After a coup in 1980, they returned
to Guinea to escape the instability. But Saikou found that the
socialism of President Sekou Toure made life hard for a
businessman. He took his family to Togo.
 &HT;    They returned to Guinea in 1984 when the president died, and
before long moved to Thailand. Saikou had mainly been trading in
gold and gems and, Kadi says, had a large store of low-quality
Guinean rubies. A company in Thailand told him they had a heat
treatment for the gems that could increase their quality.
 &HT;    But Saikou ended up losing a lot of money and wanted to move to
Singapore. Tired of constantly moving the family, Kadi refused to
go and Saikou threatened to leave.
 &HT;    ``Maybe he was thinking I would come back,'' she said. ``Divorce
is like a threat to the woman, to have more control _ because only
a small number of women can survive alone. Women are very
disadvantaged in Africa.''
 &HT;    But she would not be dissuaded, and the marriage ended. ``I was
determined to support myself and live on my own.''
 &HT;    Having learned her husband's business, she began to trade gems
in Bangkok, although she seldom wore jewelry herself. ``The
valuable stones, I sold them. I believe in turning the money
around, buying and selling.''
 &HT;    Before long she moved her four children back to Conakry, the
capital of Guinea. Through connections in the mining industry she
ended up the highly paid representative of an Australian company
interested in opening a gold mine. She went to the office every
day, helping to arrange the needed permits and permissions.
 &HT;    Amadou, who had earned a degree in computer science from a
college in Bangkok, left on a tourist visa for the United States in
September 1996. ``He told me he wanted to realize his dream'' of
working in computers or electronics, Kadi said, ``because he had
seen me struggle to bring the children up and wanted to help me.
His plan was to come back and assume his place as head of the
family.''
 -0- 
 &HT;    The call from New York came when it was barely light on the
morning of Feb. 4. On the other end of the line was Abdul Karim,
Amadou's cousin.
 &HT;    Kadi's younger sister picked up the phone. She knew something
was wrong when Abdul insisted on talking to Oury, Kadi's brother,
``because in our tradition,'' Kadi explained, ``you cannot tell the
woman bad news directly.''
 &HT;    At the time, she was at the house of Sankarela Diallo, a young
journalist and trader she had married two months earlier. (Diallo
is a common name in Guinea.) Kadi's sister demanded to be told what
had happened. Abdul would not tell her and hung up.
 &HT;    ``My sister called me immediately,'' Kadi told me. ``She said,
'There was a call from New York _ our cousin, Abdul.' Knowing the
time difference, I said, 'If someone called this time from New York
and it's not Amadou, then it's about him.' I was thinking he was
sick, maybe in the hospital, or maybe a car hit him or something. I
was afraid to say I think he died, but, you know, I knew, that
instant. ...''
 &HT;    Kadi began to weep as she told this story. The phone rang a lot
that night, she said. ``People would ask me, 'Have you heard the
news?' and I would say, 'No!' And they would hang up. Many times!
 &HT;    ``And once I hung up the phone and started crying, and my
daughter, Laouratou, she held me until I had the courage to call
one of them back, a man. And I said, 'I believe in God _ tell me,
did my son die?' And he said, 'Yes.'''
 &HT;    It wasn't until about 4 p.m. that Kadi learned how. ``My second
son, Ibrahim, he was reading the paper, and I saw he was looking
down, and I said, 'What happened?' And he said, 'Nothing, Mom.'
Because we teach men not to cry. But Ibrahim was crying. He was
trying to be strong, but he could not believe it.'' Then Ibrahim,
16, told her that the police had shot Amadou.
 &HT;    ``They didn't tell me how many bullets, because all the family
wanted to protect me from the shock. But little by little I found
out. Our Australian investor came in the evening, and he said, 'I'm
sorry, but they shot him many times.' And I screamed, 'Why didn't
you tell me?' Because the bullets and everything, they tried to
minimize. 'I'm sorry,' he said, 'but they shot him many times,
Kadi, too many times.' And I told him: 'You must tell me. How
many?'
 &HT;    ``He said, 'It's 41 bullets.'''
 &HT;    It took two more days for Kadi to get plane tickets and visas
for herself, her new husband and her uncle. They arrived at John F.
Kennedy airport midday on Tuesday, Feb. 9, and were involved in
politics before they stepped off the plane. The Guinean government
had called its diplomats in New York, who were to transport Kadi's
party to Manhattan.
 &HT;    ``The ambassador wanted to take me, but the city pulled me into
their own van. They said they are responsible for our security.''
This was the same city government whose security forces had killed
her son.
 &HT;    ``The ambassador told me, 'Don't panic.' But I was already
panicked! I didn't expect that. I wanted to go to the Bronx before
the hotel,'' she said, and they acceded to her wish.
 &HT;    Just two days before, a thousand demonstrators, led by Sharpton,
gathered in front of the house on Wheeler Avenue. The arrival of
Kadiatou Diallo came as a complete surprise and must have seemed
like a gift from heaven.
 &HT;    ``Justice,'' she said, when she finally emerged from her son's
apartment, ``must be done.''

perhaps owing to his having an outspoken wife.
 &HT;    Even as a girl she was a beauty. When she was 14, a trader from
a nearby village asked her father for her hand in marriage. Her
father said he couldn't answer for Kadi: ``Go and talk to my
daughter first,'' he told Saikou Diallo, 30, a man who already had
a wife and two children. ``I don't want to give you any hope before
you do.''
 &HT;    Kadi was unsure but willing. She is proud now that her father
insisted that as a condition of marriage she be allowed to continue
her education.
 &HT;    Amadou, the first of their four children, was born two years
later, when she was 16. ``I was very young, and I thought I was too
young to keep him,'' she told Newsday. ``At night, I woke up to see
if he was there.''
 &HT;    As a boy, Amadou developed a lisp. His mispronunciation of her
name became a treasured nickname. ``Tatatou,'' he called her.
 &HT;    By then the family was living in neighboring Liberia, where
Saikou had a trading business. After a coup in 1980, they returned
to Guinea to escape the instability. But Saikou found that the
socialism of President Sekou Toure made life hard for a
businessman. He took his family to Togo.
 &HT;    They returned to Guinea in 1984 when the president died, and
before long moved to Thailand. Saikou had mainly been trading in
gold and gems and, Kadi says, had a large store of low-quality
Guinean rubies. A company in Thailand told him they had a heat
treatment for the gems that could increase their quality.
 &HT;    But Saikou ended up losing a lot of money and wanted to move to
Singapore. Tired of constantly moving the family, Kadi refused to
go and Saikou threatened to leave.
 &HT;    ``Maybe he was thinking I would come back,'' she said. ``Divorce
is like a threat to the woman, to have more control _ because only
a small number of women can survive alone. Women are very
disadvantaged in Africa.''
 &HT;    But she would not be dissuaded, and the marriage ended. ``I was
determined to support myself and live on my own.''
 &HT;    Having learned her husband's business, she began to trade gems
in Bangkok, although she seldom wore jewelry herself. ``The
valuable stones, I sold them. I believe in turning the money
around, buying and selling.''
 &HT;    Before long she moved her four children back to Conakry, the
capital of Guinea. Through connections in the mining industry she
ended up the highly paid representative of an Australian company
interested in opening a gold mine. She went to the office every
day, helping to arrange the needed permits and permissions.
 &HT;    Amadou, who had earned a degree in computer science from a
college in Bangkok, left on a tourist visa for the United States in
September 1996. ``He told me he wanted to realize his dream'' of
working in computers or electronics, Kadi said, ``because he had
seen me struggle to bring the children up and wanted to help me.
His plan was to come back and assume his place as head of the
family.''
 -0- 
 &HT;    The call from New York came when it was barely light on the
morning of Feb. 4. On the other end of the line was Abdul Karim,
Amadou's cousin.
 &HT;    Kadi's younger sister picked up the phone. She knew something
was wrong when Abdul insisted on talking to Oury, Kadi's brother,
``because in our tradition,'' Kadi explained, ``you cannot tell the
woman bad news directly.''
 &HT;    At the time, she was at the house of Sankarela Diallo, a young
journalist and trader she had married two months earlier. (Diallo
is a common name in Guinea.) Kadi's sister demanded to be told what
had happened. Abdul would not tell her and hung up.
 &HT;    ``My sister called me immediately,'' Kadi told me. ``She said,
'There was a call from New York _ our cousin, Abdul.' Knowing the
time difference, I said, 'If someone called this time from New York
and it's not Amadou, then it's about him.' I was thinking he was
sick, maybe in the hospital, or maybe a car hit him or something. I
was afraid to say I think he died, but, you know, I knew, that
instant. ...''
 &HT;    Kadi began to weep as she told this story. The phone rang a lot
that night, she said. ``People would ask me, 'Have you heard the
news?' and I would say, 'No!' And they would hang up. Many times!
 &HT;    ``And once I hung up the phone and started crying, and my
daughter, Laouratou, she held me until I had the courage to call
one of them back, a man. And I said, 'I believe in God _ tell me,
did my son die?' And he said, 'Yes.'''
 &HT;    It wasn't until about 4 p.m. that Kadi learned how. ``My second
son, Ibrahim, he was reading the paper, and I saw he was looking
down, and I said, 'What happened?' And he said, 'Nothing, Mom.'
Because we teach men not to cry. But Ibrahim was crying. He was
trying to be strong, but he could not believe it.'' Then Ibrahim,
16, told her that the police had shot Amadou.
 &HT;    ``They didn't tell me how many bullets, because all the family
wanted to protect me from the shock. But little by little I found
out. Our Australian investor came in the evening, and he said, 'I'm
sorry, but they shot him many times.' And I screamed, 'Why didn't
you tell me?' Because the bullets and everything, they tried to
minimize. 'I'm sorry,' he said, 'but they shot him many times,
Kadi, too many times.' And I told him: 'You must tell me. How
many?'
 &HT;    ``He said, 'It's 41 bullets.'''
 &HT;    It took two more days for Kadi to get plane tickets and visas
for herself, her new husband and her uncle. They arrived at John F.
Kennedy airport midday on Tuesday, Feb. 9, and were involved in
politics before they stepped off the plane. The Guinean government
had called its diplomats in New York, who were to transport Kadi's
party to Manhattan.
 &HT;    ``The ambassador wanted to take me, but the city pulled me into
their own van. They said they are responsible for our security.''
This was the same city government whose security forces had killed
her son.
 &HT;    ``The ambassador told me, 'Don't panic.' But I was already
panicked! I didn't expect that. I wanted to go to the Bronx before
the hotel,'' she said, and they acceded to her wish.
 &HT;    Just two days before, a thousand demonstrators, led by Sharpton,
gathered in front of the house on Wheeler Avenue. The arrival of
Kadiatou Diallo came as a complete surprise and must have seemed
like a gift from heaven.
 &HT;    ``Justice,'' she said, when she finally emerged from her son's
apartment, ``must be done.''

SOME POLICYHOLDERS OPPOSE METLIFE'S CONVERSION PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOSEPH B. TREASTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At a hearing on the conversion of Metropolitan Life
Insurance Co. from ownership by its policyholders to ownership by
shareholders, a handful of policyholders argued Monday that they
and the company's more than 10 million other policyholders were not
getting a fair shake.
</P>
<P>
   The policyholders, lawyers representing policyholders and some
actuaries, who own policies, questioned Metropolitan Life's
procedures for valuing the company and allocating shares to
policyholders.
</P>
<P>
   They also raised doubts about the company's assertions that
taking MetLife public would not diminish dividends to policyholders
and contended that anti-takeover measures included in the
conversion plan could depress share prices, and thus the value
received by policyholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not believe the plan is fair and equitable to
policyholders,'' said Lance S. Gad, a former investment banker and
lawyer who is now a private investor. ``The major fault with the
Met plan is that it fails to offer policyholders the right to buy
stock at the public offering price.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the MetLife plan, policyholders are to be given shares
representing their contribution to company profits in exchange for
their ownership stake in the company. Those who want additional
shares must buy them after the initial public offering at the
market price, which is often somewhat higher than the initial
offering price.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Benmosche, the chief executive of MetLife, and his senior
staff listened silently to the complaints after each of the
executives had given prepared statements repeatedly assuring the
audience of more than 150 people at a hotel that the conversion
plan was ``fair and equitable.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Benmosche nor the other MetLife executives responded to
the specific points raised by the policyholders. Neil D. Levin, the
state insurance superintendent who had convened the hearing, asked
Benmosche at the end of the meeting to respond. Benmosche said, ``I
do appreciate the input.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to understand,'' he added, ``that we as
management represent all the policyholders. We did the best we
could to be fair and equitable to all policyholders.''
</P>
<P>
   Levin, whose approval of the conversion is required, asked a few
questions of the MetLife executives but listened to the
policyholders without commenting. He has 60 days to consider his
decision. MetLife policyholders also must approve the conversion.
Voting has been open since late November and is to end on Feb. 7.

   SUPER BOWL COVERAGE
</P>
<P>
   SBOWL-VERMEIL _ ATLANTA _ He walked away because of burnout. He
returned because he was tired of commenting on the NFL for
television and coaching was too much in his blood. Rams coach Dick
Vermeil was one of the four ``old'' guys hired four years ago, and
nobody thought he would succeed. Now he has his team in the Super
Bowl. (Bunn, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 45.

From Air Coryell to West Coast offense, etc., when did these
innovators get their inspiration _ middle of the night, cocktail
napkins _ and what impact did it have on the sport. (Schlabach,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   SBOWL-PICDAY _ ATLANTA _ Every year, Butch John of the Jackson
(Miss.) Clarion-Ledger cringes on Super Bowl picture day. That's
when national TV announcers bring up the question he asked years
ago to Redskins quarterback Doug Williams: ``Have you always been a
black QB?'' To writers, the meaning behind the question was clear _
did it took the mega-event Super Bowl to bring the issue under
discussion. But the Talking Heads have made it a yearly laugh-off.
This is our effort to vindicate John in a picture day advance.
(Wilkinson, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   SBOWL-STEEG _ Jim Steeg, the guru of Super Bowl planning, says
this year's game offers an interesting contrast from year's past.
None of the remaining playoff teams have been to the Super Bowl
since it turned from a big game into THE mega-event. This creates
its own set of problems for Steeg, who must lead these teams by the
hand through the SBowl process. In early January, Steeg brought
team reps to Atlanta to start the education process. Steeg tells us
about his hopes, fears and what he's telling teams down to the most
minor details. (Schlabach, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). WITH

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    In the summer of 1994, a surgeon named J. Bruce Moseley found
himself engaged in an elaborate form of make-believe.
 &HT;    Moseley had 10 patients scheduled for an operation intended to
relieve the arthritis pain in their knees.
 &HT;    The patients were men _ most of them middle-aged, all former
military guys _ and they weren't ready to consign themselves to the
rocking chair yet.
 &HT;    So they had decided to take a risk and volunteer for a study
that must have sounded, when Moseley first told them about it,
rather peculiar. All 10 would be wheeled into an operating room at
the Houston Veterans Affairs Medical Center, draped, examined and
anesthetized. All 10 would be dispatched to the recovery room and
sent home from the hospital by the next morning equipped with
crutches and a painkiller.
 &HT;    But there the similarities ended. For while two of the men would
undergo the standard arthroscopic surgery for their condition _ the
scraping and rinsing of the knee joint _ and three would have the
rinsing alone, five would have no recognized surgical procedure at
all. Their surgery would be a placebo, an exercise in just pretend.
 &HT;    Moseley would stab the placebo patients' knees three times with
a scalpel _ to make it feel and look real, there had to be
incisions and later, scars _ but that was it. And he couldn't break
character.
 &HT;    If he knew in advance which kind of surgery he was to perform,
he might somehow give it away, so it wasn't until he entered the
gleaming OR, scrubbed and in his greens, that he opened an envelope
telling him whether he was doing a real procedure or a fake one
that time. Only the anesthetist and the nurse assisting him were in
on the secret.
 &HT;    In some ways, Moseley was an unlikely actor for such a role. As
a surgeon and a team physician for the Houston Rockets, he wasn't
the kind of doctor given to woolly introspection about the
Mind-Body Problem. He was simply skeptical about the specific
benefit of arthroscopic surgery for arthritis of the knee and
wanted to test its efficacy.
 &HT;    Then Moseley started talking with a doctor named Nelda Wray who
had been put in charge of health care research at the Houston VA,
and she asked him a startling question: How did he know that
whatever benefit came from this surgery wasn't a product of the
placebo effect _ that is, that those who improved did so not
because the operation actually healed the knee joint but because
they expected it would?
 &HT;    ``I said: 'It can't be,''' Moseley recalls. ``'This is surgery
we're talking about.' And she said: 'You're all wrong. The bigger
and more dramatic the patient perceives the intervention to be, the
bigger the placebo effect. Big pills have more than small pills,
injections have more than pills and surgery has the most of all.'''
 &HT;    Moseley was intrigued, but before he could begin his study, it
had to be approved by the institutional review board at Baylor and
by the human-studies committee at the VA.
 &HT;    ``My first reaction was what anybody's would be,'' says Baruch
Brody, an ethicist who consulted with the committees. ``I said:
'You're going to do what? Cut people up, pretending to do surgery
when you're not?'''
 &HT;    But Brody, like the rest of the reviewers, eventually came
around to the idea. Arthroscopic knee surgery typically requires
general anesthesia, which carries risks; the placebo procedure
required only a sedative and was cheaper. If patients responded
just as favorably to a placebo, why continue with arthroscopy?
 &HT;    The placebo worked. Six months after surgery, the 10 patients
still didn't know whether they had been faked out or not. But all
of them reported much less pain. None were unhappy with the outcome
of the operation.
 &HT;    This was a pilot study _ far too small to offer any definitive
conclusions about the efficacy of arthroscopic surgery for
osteoarthritis. But it was suggestive enough to set Moseley and
Wray on an expanded version of the same research design _ this time
with 180 patients _ for which they expect to have the results next
October.
 &HT;    Sylvester Colligan, a 76-year-old World War II veteran from
Beaumont, Tex., was assigned to the placebo group in Moseley and
Wray's expanded study. Colligan's right knee had been giving him
trouble for five years when a doctor at his local clinic told him
he probably had arthritis and suggested he talk to Moseley.
 &HT;    ``I was very impressed with him, especially when I heard he was
the team doctor with the Rockets,'' says Colligan, a courteous,
soft-spoken retiree who worked for the local Coca-Cola bottling
plant, first as an assistant to the driver of a delivery truck and
eventually as an account manager. ``So, sure, I went ahead and
signed up for this new thing he was doing.''
 &HT;    Colligan doesn't sound all that at ease with the term placebo,
but he does know his surgery consisted of only shallow incisions.
More important, he knows that he has no pain in his knee now and
that he can mow his yard again and walk wherever he wants.
 &HT;    ``The surgery was two years ago and the knee never has bothered
me since,'' he says. ``It's just like my other knee now. I give a
whole lot of credit to Dr. Moseley. Whenever I see him on the TV
during a basketball game, I call the wife in and say, 'Hey, there's
the doctor that fixed my knee!'''
 &HT;    That operating-room fakery should exert a therapeutic effect on
a patient is a remarkable notion. And yet it may be that the
symbolic armature of surgery _ the shedding of blood, the cultural
prestige of surgeons, even the scars that call to mind a dramatic
act of healing _ is itself a powerful force in recovery. It may be
that ``placebo surgery'' isn't such an oxymoron after all.
 &HT;    Forty years ago, a young Seattle cardiologist named Leonard Cobb
conducted a unique trial of a procedure then commonly used for
angina, in which doctors made small incisions in the chest and tied
knots in two arteries to try to increase blood flow to the heart.
 &HT;    It was a popular technique _ 90 percent of patients reported
that it helped _ but when Cobb compared it with placebo surgery in
which he made incisions but did not tie off the arteries, the sham
operations proved just as successful. The procedure, known as
internal mammary ligation, was soon abandoned.
 &HT;    Over the next decades, the whole idea of placebo surgery fell
out of favor with ethicists and patient advocates. If placebo
surgery didn't violate the Hippocratic edict ``First, do no harm,''
what did?
 &HT;    Now, though, that taboo is fading, and Moseley and Wray are not
the only ones arguing that new surgical techniques, like new
medicines, ought to be tested with placebo controls.
 &HT;    Doctors investigating a new technique for treating Parkinson's
disease, for example, incorporated a placebo control group _
patients who had holes drilled in their skulls to simulate the real
procedure, in which fetal cells are implanted in the brain _ into a
widely publicized study released last April.
 &HT;    The study showed a significant placebo effect, though the motor
ability of the patients who actually got the fetal implants
improved even more.
 &HT;    ``This is just the beginning,'' Dr. C. Warren Olanow, chairman
of neurology at Mount Sinai School of Medicine, told Time magazine.
``Tomorrow, if you have a new procedure, you will have to do a
double-blind placebo trial.''
 &HT;    Some doctors argue, with reason, that the new enthusiasm for
placebo surgery is driven by hospital bean counters and insurers
who want hard evidence that an expensive procedure works before
they'll pay for it. And yet, with all due respect for medical
economics, that can't be the only explanation.
 &HT;    If placebo surgery makes sense, it makes sense because of the
growing body of evidence for the strength of the placebo effect in
general. Maybe pretend operations are just the most sensational
proof of a diffuse phenomenon that has never quite been explained,
but that, as the historian of science Anne Harrington has written,
continues to ``haunt our house of biomedical objectivity.''
 &HT;    The truth is that the placebo effect is huge _ anywhere between
35 and 75 percent of patients benefit from taking a dummy pill in
studies of new drugs _ so huge, in fact, that it should probably be
put to conscious use in clinical practice, even if we do not
entirely understand how it works.
 &HT;    For centuries, Western medicine consisted of almost nothing but
the placebo effect. The patient who got better after a bleeding _
or a dose of fox lung, wood lice, tartar emetic or any of the other
charming staples of the 19th-century pharmacopoeia _ got better
either in spite of them or because of their symbolic value.
 &HT;    Such patients believed in the cure and in the authority of the
bewigged gentlemen administering it, and the belief gave them hope
and the hope helped make them well. There were exceptions _
remedies, like quinine for malaria, the vaccine for smallpox and
morphine for pain relief, that actually worked.
 &HT;    But generally speaking, if all the drugs of the day ``could be
sunk to the bottom of the sea,'' as Oliver Wendell Holmes observed
in 1860, ``it would be all the better for mankind _ and all the
worse for the fishes.''
 &HT;    In an influential article first published in 1955, the Harvard
researcher Henry Beecher concluded that between 30 percent and 40
percent of any treated group would respond to a placebo. But
studies since then have shown placebos working for certain
conditions _ pain, depression, some heart ailments, gastric ulcers
and other stomach complaints _ in closer to 50 or 60 percent of
subjects, sometimes more.
 &HT;    For years, scientists have tried to come up with a plausible
explanation for the placebo effect, and there are by now several
contenders.
 &HT;    One is classical conditioning: People who have experienced
relief in medical settings or from ingesting a pill are primed,
like Pavlov's dogs, to do the same again. Another is the release of
endorphins: several studies have suggested that placebo pain
relievers, at least, work by stimulating the brain's own
analgesics.
 &HT;    Still a third is that taking a placebo, especially if it is
administered in an atmosphere of hope, relieves stress, which tends
to aggravate the symptoms of placebo-sensitive conditions like
asthma and hypertension.
 &HT;    What all of these explanations have in common _ for they are
certainly not mutually exclusive _ is the element of expectation,
the promise of help on the way that can only be imparted by another
human being.
 &HT;    This kind of hope seems particularly relevant when you respect
the distinction made by Dr. Howard M. Spiro, one of the most
thoughtful writers on the placebo, between illness and disease:
Illness is what the patient feels; disease is what the doctor
finds. Hope can help soften the experience of illness, though it
cannot cure the underlying disease.
 &HT;    In fact, there is hard data to support the notion that the
emotional alliance between a doctor and patient is itself a
therapeutic force _ that a compassionate and optimistic physician
can be, as one writer puts it, a walking placebo, that words can be
physically comforting.
 &HT;    In a study on postoperative pain conducted at Massachusetts
General Hospital, half of the patients were randomly chosen to be
visited by the anesthetist the night before surgery and treated,
poor dears, in a brusque, offhand manner.
 &HT;    ``My name is so-and-so,'' the doctor would say. ``Tomorrow I'm
going to give you anesthesia. Don't worry; everything is going to
be all right,'' and then off he'd go.
 &HT;    The same anesthetist visited the other group of patients and
this time put on a warm and sympathetic face, holding their hands
as he sat on their beds, telling them exactly what to expect in the
way of postop pain and assuring them that pain relief would be
available.
 &HT;    Those in the second group ended up requiring only half the
amount of painkilling medication and were discharged an average of
2.6 days earlier.
 &HT;    To be sure, the physician who can marshal a placebo response
with words and manner probably comes closest to what many of us
would think of as the profession's ideal - the kind of doctor who
seems wholly committed to our welfare, not the insurance company's;
who knows when and how to give us hope, who listens closely but
doesn't feel constrained from delivering advice; who knows us
because she has taken the time to know us.
 &HT;    ``The placebo effect can occur,'' as the physician Herbert
Spiegel once put it, ``when conditions are optimal for hope, faith,
trust and love.'' It might sound sentimental, but then sentiment,
working hand in hand with science, can make medical practice so
much more powerful.
 &HT;    A world in which placebo _ preferably in the form of deft
encouragement, but sometimes in the form of a harmless pill _ was
tolerated, even embraced, would be a world in which doctors never
forgot that medical practice consists not only of the technologies
of diagnosis and treatment but also of the careful tending of a
patient's expectations and the unabashed willingness to comfort.
 &HT;    It would be a world in which doctors kept in mind the uses of
optimism, knowing that there is, as Brown points out, ``a great
difference between telling a patient, 'This is a very powerful
painkiller,' and saying, 'This might help your pain a bit''' _ and
that they might as well give the former speech if they're going to
bother prescribing medicine at all.
 &HT;    It would be a world in which many of us might feel a lot better.

placebo surgery is driven by hospital bean counters and insurers
who want hard evidence that an expensive procedure works before
they'll pay for it. And yet, with all due respect for medical
economics, that can't be the only explanation.
 &HT;    If placebo surgery makes sense, it makes sense because of the
growing body of evidence for the strength of the placebo effect in
general. Maybe pretend operations are just the most sensational
proof of a diffuse phenomenon that has never quite been explained,
but that, as the historian of science Anne Harrington has written,
continues to ``haunt our house of biomedical objectivity.''
 &HT;    The truth is that the placebo effect is huge _ anywhere between
35 and 75 percent of patients benefit from taking a dummy pill in
studies of new drugs _ so huge, in fact, that it should probably be
put to conscious use in clinical practice, even if we do not
entirely understand how it works.
 &HT;    For centuries, Western medicine consisted of almost nothing but
the placebo effect. The patient who got better after a bleeding _
or a dose of fox lung, wood lice, tartar emetic or any of the other
charming staples of the 19th-century pharmacopoeia _ got better
either in spite of them or because of their symbolic value.
 &HT;    Such patients believed in the cure and in the authority of the
bewigged gentlemen administering it, and the belief gave them hope
and the hope helped make them well. There were exceptions _
remedies, like quinine for malaria, the vaccine for smallpox and
morphine for pain relief, that actually worked.
 &HT;    But generally speaking, if all the drugs of the day ``could be
sunk to the bottom of the sea,'' as Oliver Wendell Holmes observed
in 1860, ``it would be all the better for mankind _ and all the
worse for the fishes.''
 &HT;    In an influential article first published in 1955, the Harvard
researcher Henry Beecher concluded that between 30 percent and 40
percent of any treated group would respond to a placebo. But
studies since then have shown placebos working for certain
conditions _ pain, depression, some heart ailments, gastric ulcers
and other stomach complaints _ in closer to 50 or 60 percent of
subjects, sometimes more.
 &HT;    For years, scientists have tried to come up with a plausible
explanation for the placebo effect, and there are by now several
contenders.
 &HT;    One is classical conditioning: People who have experienced
relief in medical settings or from ingesting a pill are primed,
like Pavlov's dogs, to do the same again. Another is the release of
endorphins: several studies have suggested that placebo pain
relievers, at least, work by stimulating the brain's own
analgesics.
 &HT;    Still a third is that taking a placebo, especially if it is
administered in an atmosphere of hope, relieves stress, which tends
to aggravate the symptoms of placebo-sensitive conditions like
asthma and hypertension.
 &HT;    What all of these explanations have in common _ for they are
certainly not mutually exclusive _ is the element of expectation,
the promise of help on the way that can only be imparted by another
human being.
 &HT;    This kind of hope seems particularly relevant when you respect
the distinction made by Dr. Howard M. Spiro, one of the most
thoughtful writers on the placebo, between illness and disease:
Illness is what the patient feels; disease is what the doctor
finds. Hope can help soften the experience of illness, though it
cannot cure the underlying disease.
 &HT;    In fact, there is hard data to support the notion that the
emotional alliance between a doctor and patient is itself a
therapeutic force _ that a compassionate and optimistic physician
can be, as one writer puts it, a walking placebo, that words can be
physically comforting.
 &HT;    In a study on postoperative pain conducted at Massachusetts
General Hospital, half of the patients were randomly chosen to be
visited by the anesthetist the night before surgery and treated,
poor dears, in a brusque, offhand manner.
 &HT;    ``My name is so-and-so,'' the doctor would say. ``Tomorrow I'm
going to give you anesthesia. Don't worry; everything is going to
be all right,'' and then off he'd go.
 &HT;    The same anesthetist visited the other group of patients and
this time put on a warm and sympathetic face, holding their hands
as he sat on their beds, telling them exactly what to expect in the
way of postop pain and assuring them that pain relief would be
available.
 &HT;    Those in the second group ended up requiring only half the
amount of painkilling medication and were discharged an average of
2.6 days earlier.
 &HT;    To be sure, the physician who can marshal a placebo response
with words and manner probably comes closest to what many of us
would think of as the profession's ideal - the kind of doctor who
seems wholly committed to our welfare, not the insurance company's;
who knows when and how to give us hope, who listens closely but
doesn't feel constrained from delivering advice; who knows us
because she has taken the time to know us.
 &HT;    ``The placebo effect can occur,'' as the physician Herbert
Spiegel once put it, ``when conditions are optimal for hope, faith,
trust and love.'' It might sound sentimental, but then sentiment,
working hand in hand with science, can make medical practice so
much more powerful.
 &HT;    A world in which placebo _ preferably in the form of deft
encouragement, but sometimes in the form of a harmless pill _ was
tolerated, even embraced, would be a world in which doctors never
forgot that medical practice consists not only of the technologies
of diagnosis and treatment but also of the careful tending of a
patient's expectations and the unabashed willingness to comfort.
 &HT;    It would be a world in which doctors kept in mind the uses of
optimism, knowing that there is, as Brown points out, ``a great
difference between telling a patient, 'This is a very powerful
painkiller,' and saying, 'This might help your pain a bit''' _ and
that they might as well give the former speech if they're going to
bother prescribing medicine at all.
 &HT;    It would be a world in which many of us might feel a lot better.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    There were 10 people traveling with the international human
rights delegation, several of them Americans who looked extremely
gringo and spoke no Spanish. They were in a Dodge Ram van that was
almost as big as a city bus, and so it seemed a safe bet that their
plan to sneak into the state mental hospital in Hidalgo was
preposterous.
 &HT;    Their hope was to document conditions at this mental
institution, considered one of Mexico's snake pits, before the
hospital director discovered what they were up to.
 &HT;    They had one thing in their favor. Guiding the international
entourage that chilly fall morning was Virginia Gonzalez, the
Dorothea Dix of Mexico, that nation's leading advocate for the
mentally ill and the country's No. 1 expert on sneaking into mental
hospitals.
 &HT;    In the previous decade, Gonzalez had wormed her way into most of
the public mental institutions around Mexico, spending three nights
posing as a patient at a women's hospital and smuggling a Mexico
City mayor into a men's hospital late one night to view horrid
conditions there.
 &HT;    At Hidalgo, she believed, the staff was so lax that the
investigators might get lucky and walk right in. ``I think we can
do it,'' she told Eric Rosenthal, the lead investigator, as they
neared the hospital. ``We'll see. Nothing is sure.''
 &HT;    More than once she was beaten up at institutions when she was
discovered inside. The last time she tried in Hidalgo, the year
before, a guard with a rifle at the front gate turned her away.
 &HT;    This time, the guard booth was empty, the gate unlocked, and at
7:30 a.m. on Nov. 16, 1999, they drove the big van straight down
the private road to the hospital.
 &HT;    The institution was majestic, an enormous beige and
cream-colored hacienda with two bell towers rising four stories
above the desert, a place that had the look of a child's castle and
once _ long ago, before it was a mental hospital _ belonged to a
wealthy Spanish landowner.
 &HT;    ``Hurry, hurry,'' Gonzalez whispered, leading the group through
an archway and down a corridor that ended at a closed gate.
 &HT;    One push from Gonzalez and it swung open. For an instant, they
froze. This is how it must have felt to the ancient Greek soldiers
when they unlatched the trap door on the Trojan horse. ``Come,
we're in,'' Gonzalez whispered. ``You will have your report.''
 &HT;    Half rushed off to the men's ward, where two wooden doors were
secured with a lock and chain. One of the human rights members,
acting as if this were all very routine, vaguely explained that
they were a group taking an official tour, and the attendant,
assuming his boss had forgotten to notify him, unchained the doors.
 &HT;    Inside, one long room was filled with beds closely packed
together, 10 to a row, dorm style. A single nurse was watching the
110 men. Spotting the visitors, several patients crowded around,
and one man, naked from the waist down, was suddenly slammed to the
floor by another patient trying to squeeze closer.
 &HT;    Though some patients had been there 30 years, there were no
lockers, night tables or any personal items. Most had already been
herded to their usual morning spot, a walled-off section at the far
end of the ward, perhaps 60 feet long by 15 feet wide, where they
milled about or huddled together for warmth.
 &HT;    Several were naked. Many were only partly dressed. Few had
shoes, though the floor was puddled with urine and scattered with
piles of men's feces. The men do not have their own clothes and
each morning picked through stacks from the laundry. Unfortunately,
the clothes were not carefully sorted, and one man ended up with
women's black buckled shoes; a second wore a flowered blouse; a
third had on a skirt.
 &HT;    As Rosenthal videotaped them, several patients reached their
arms over the wall, shook hands and with toothless smiles wished
the investigators good health and long life.
 &HT;    Juan Martinez Sanchez, an articulate man of 37, explained that
he was schizophrenic, had been there three years and wanted
desperately to leave. ''My family won't come,'' he said. ``They say
I'm crazy. And I don't know where else to go.''
 &HT;    The nurse on duty, Irma Lopez, who has worked at Hidalgo 28
years, politely answered questions put to her in Spanish by the
team.
 &HT;    ``No,'' she said, ''practically no one ever leaves.''
 &HT;    She explained that while this was a psychiatric hospital, half
the patients were not even mentally ill; they were mentally
retarded. The hospital doctors estimate as many as 80 percent could
be discharged, but there is not one government-financed group home
or apartment program in all of Mexico.
 &HT;    Why, an investigator asked, were so many naked?
 &HT;    ``Some want to be naked,'' Lopez said. ``We cannot force them.''
 &HT;    It was 45 degrees that morning. The hospital has no heat and
more than one window on the ward was broken. Investigators wore
heavy coats. Lopez lowered her eyes.
 &HT;    ``So many patients,'' she said softly. ``And so little help.''
 &HT;    The team moved on to the women's ward. Just as we walked in, 15
naked women were being marched toward us, and we backed away, to
give them privacy. But the naked women paraded past, to a hallway
where a male attendant stood beside the shower room.
 &HT;    There, as hospital workers came and went in the hall, the 15
naked women squatted, shivering, their arms folded over their
breasts for warmth, waiting to shower.
 &HT;    Standing nearby, the ward nurse, Oliveria Garcia, explained,
``Most days, we may have two towels for 98 women.''
 &HT;    Soon, doctors and administrators in white coats began to appear.
The always troublesome Virginia Gonzalez had been detected in their
midst, and now they were attempting damage control. Cleaners
arrived to mop up the urine and feces. Naked patients were rounded
up and dressed.
 &HT;    The hospital doctors were angry, but they had decided to act
civilly while getting the troublemakers out. Politely yet firmly
they escorted Rosenthal and his people away from the patients, to a
handsome meeting room that looked as if it might have been the
library in the old days of the hacienda.
 &HT;    Dr. Victor Vazquez was collegial as we left the wards, though he
was also agitated with the investigators. ``We don't know,'' he
explained, ``if they have the proper permits for such a visit.''
 &HT;    As he said this, an attendant walked by, escorting a naked man.
Vazquez glanced at me to see if I'd noticed, and I said nothing,
continuing our civil conversation, although a patient so naked is
hard to overlook.
 &HT;    The site visit that morning was one of a hundred this group has
conducted at mental institutions worldwide in recent years as it
labors to establish treatment of the mentally ill and mentally
retarded as a new human right.
 &HT;    In Hungary, the investigators documented the barbaric use of bed
cages (a bed covered by a padlocked cage). In Armenia, they visited
institutions where they were told the annual mortality rate had
been as high as 30 percent. In Ukraine, they toured freezing,
crowded facilities short of medicine.
 &HT;    And practically everywhere they go _ Uruguay, Argentina,
Azerbaijan, Romania, Russia _ they see disabled men, women and
children who could live in the community, left to rot in remote
asylums that are worse than most prisons.
 &HT;    Known as Mental Disability Rights International, the small
organization is based in Washington and financed by George Soros'
Open Society Institute. It was founded in 1993 by Rosenthal, who
was just 29 at the time and fresh out of Georgetown Law School.
 &HT;    The group's ambitious goal is to add a new criterion _ a
nation's treatment of its mentally disabled citizens _ to the list
of human rights used when judging whether a country should be a
member in good standing of the world community.
 &HT;    The hope is that eventually, when the United States, the
European nations, the United Nations and the World Bank make their
foreign aid and trade decisions, they will consider a nation's care
of its mental patients along with such well-established human
rights as political and religious freedom, torture and prison
conditions, slave and child labor and protections afforded
refugees.
 &HT;    Already the group has had an impact, even in countries of
limited wealth like Mexico. Since Rosenthal's first visits, places
that were once as vile as Hidalgo now separate the mentally ill
from the retarded, have rehabilitation and vocational programs,
teach toilet-training and grooming and take care to see that
patients are clothed.
 &HT;    Robert Goldman, president of the Organization of American
States' human rights commission, says complaints involving care in
Latin America are on the rise thanks to the group. ``This is
pioneering work,'' says Goldman. ``It's slow, incremental, but
you're seeing the beginning.''
 &HT;    Rosenthal does this all with one other staff person, a few dozen
consultants and a $400,000 annual budget. It helps that he is
single, works all the time and zips around like the planet's
busiest human.
 &HT;    In Mexico, he and his investigators usually started before dawn
and finished past midnight. The following month he flew to
Lithuania, Hungary, Hong Kong, China.
 &HT;    He believes this is a historic moment for the mentally disabled.
Indeed, seeing a place like Hidalgo from the inside is like being
transported back in time, to the year 1972, to Staten Island, when
a young Geraldo Rivera sneaked his TV camera into Willowbrook, a
state institution for the retarded, and filmed the wards crowded
with disabled children, their feces smeared on walls.
 &HT;    So horrid were conditions, the American public was moved. It
helped set off deinstitutionalization in the United States.
 &HT;    At every hospital Rosenthal's human rights investigators toured
in Mexico, they heard the same thing: Thanks to antipsychotic
medications, as many as 80 percent of patients could live in the
community if there were supervised housing programs.
 &HT;    Mexican government officials interviewed talked about new plans
to begin deinstitutionalization. But can Mexico do it without
dumping these patients into the streets? Will such a move create a
homeless mentally ill problem that would be as devastating as the
problem they're trying to solve?
 &HT;    ``What you hope,'' Rosenthal says, ``is you can help prevent
countries like Mexico from making the same mistakes we did in the
U.S. You want to catch them at this crucial moment.''
 &HT;    But what you fear is that, like some character in a young-adult
adventure novel, Rosenthal has been transported back in time to
that crucial night on the Titanic, but no one believes his
warnings, history prevails, the ship sinks, the mentally ill become
homeless.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    For all Rosenthal's efforts, his cause is still barely a blip.
Holly Burkhalter, a Washington-based human rights advocate for 20
years, says the group has had ``little if any impact'' on agencies
like Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, which shape the
world's human rights agenda.
 &HT;    ``Right now, Mental Disability Rights International is not on
their radar,'' she says. ``It's a poor reflection on the
well-funded human rights community that these issues have been
invisible to us.''
 &HT;    Until now, the main human rights focus involving mental patients
has been the misuse of psychiatry to institutionalize political
dissidents in Communist countries.
 &HT;    That work was very important, says Rosenthal, but what it
overlooked ``were the horrid conditions in those hospitals for the
thousands of Russian psychiatric patients who were mentally ill.''
 &HT;    Soviet mental hospitals routinely employed orderlies with
criminal backgrounds who beat patients, denied them access to
bathrooms unless a bribe was paid and stole food sent by their
families. There was often no individual psychotherapy or group
therapy, no recreational time or vocational training. Some
hospitals literally were prisons.
 &HT;    At the Chernyakhovsk Special Psychiatric Hospital, which had
been converted in the 1960s from a maximum security prison to a
hospital, the 446 mentally ill patients were ``locked in their
rooms'' and had to ``ask permission to go to the bathroom by
turning on a light outside the door of the cell,'' according to a
1989 State Department report.
 &HT;    The question is, How do you make the world see? How do you
establish a brand new international human right? The mental
disabilities group is working on two fronts.
 &HT;    First, it is trying to carve out a body of international law.
Ultimately this would involve a United Nations treaty guaranteeing
the rights and protections of the mentally disabled, similar to the
1987 convention against torture or the conventions in the 1980s on
the rights of women and children.
 &HT;    That, however, is not likely to happen soon. Nations are wary of
creating new rights, especially ones that cost money. As anyone who
has walked New York City's streets knows, not even rich Western
nations can be proud of their care of the mentally ill.
 &HT;    And so, in much the way that an activist American lawyer tries
to squeeze a civil rights or labor precedent from the Supreme
Court, Mental Disability Rights is trying to squeeze human rights
precedents from existing international law.
 &HT;    For this they have relied on a mix of U.N. resolutions,
including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
That treaty provides in Article 7 that ``no one shall be subjected
to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.''
 &HT;    When Rosenthal sees naked, shivering women at Hidalgo, he writes
in his report that it is a violation of Article 7 of ICCPR:
``cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.''
 &HT;    And when Dr. Juan deDios Uribe at the Hidalgo hospital tells him
that 80 percent of patients could live in the community if the
government financed group homes, Rosenthal writes that this is a
violation of the 1991 U.N. General Assembly Resolution 119,
Principles for Protection of People with Mental Illness: ``Every
person with mental illness shall have the right to live and work,
as far as possible, in the community.''
 &HT;    There is good reason for grounding the work in international
law. ``We are sending a message,'' says Rosenthal, ``that this is
not about comparing Mexico to Western standards: This is about the
violation of universal law.''
 &HT;    Unfortunately, a million violations mean nothing without world
opinion on your side, and that is the second, more important _ and
far more difficult _ change that must take place to establish a new
human right.
 &HT;    ``Basically,'' Rosenthal says, ``you have to shame the world.''

arrived to mop up the urine and feces. Naked patients were rounded
up and dressed.
 &HT;    The hospital doctors were angry, but they had decided to act
civilly while getting the troublemakers out. Politely yet firmly
they escorted Rosenthal and his people away from the patients, to a
handsome meeting room that looked as if it might have been the
library in the old days of the hacienda.
 &HT;    Dr. Victor Vazquez was collegial as we left the wards, though he
was also agitated with the investigators. ``We don't know,'' he
explained, ``if they have the proper permits for such a visit.''
 &HT;    As he said this, an attendant walked by, escorting a naked man.
Vazquez glanced at me to see if I'd noticed, and I said nothing,
continuing our civil conversation, although a patient so naked is
hard to overlook.
 &HT;    The site visit that morning was one of a hundred this group has
conducted at mental institutions worldwide in recent years as it
labors to establish treatment of the mentally ill and mentally
retarded as a new human right.
 &HT;    In Hungary, the investigators documented the barbaric use of bed
cages (a bed covered by a padlocked cage). In Armenia, they visited
institutions where they were told the annual mortality rate had
been as high as 30 percent. In Ukraine, they toured freezing,
crowded facilities short of medicine.
 &HT;    And practically everywhere they go _ Uruguay, Argentina,
Azerbaijan, Romania, Russia _ they see disabled men, women and
children who could live in the community, left to rot in remote
asylums that are worse than most prisons.
 &HT;    Known as Mental Disability Rights International, the small
organization is based in Washington and financed by George Soros'
Open Society Institute. It was founded in 1993 by Rosenthal, who
was just 29 at the time and fresh out of Georgetown Law School.
 &HT;    The group's ambitious goal is to add a new criterion _ a
nation's treatment of its mentally disabled citizens _ to the list
of human rights used when judging whether a country should be a
member in good standing of the world community.
 &HT;    The hope is that eventually, when the United States, the
European nations, the United Nations and the World Bank make their
foreign aid and trade decisions, they will consider a nation's care
of its mental patients along with such well-established human
rights as political and religious freedom, torture and prison
conditions, slave and child labor and protections afforded
refugees.
 &HT;    Already the group has had an impact, even in countries of
limited wealth like Mexico. Since Rosenthal's first visits, places
that were once as vile as Hidalgo now separate the mentally ill
from the retarded, have rehabilitation and vocational programs,
teach toilet-training and grooming and take care to see that
patients are clothed.
 &HT;    Robert Goldman, president of the Organization of American
States' human rights commission, says complaints involving care in
Latin America are on the rise thanks to the group. ``This is
pioneering work,'' says Goldman. ``It's slow, incremental, but
you're seeing the beginning.''
 &HT;    Rosenthal does this all with one other staff person, a few dozen
consultants and a $400,000 annual budget. It helps that he is
single, works all the time and zips around like the planet's
busiest human.
 &HT;    In Mexico, he and his investigators usually started before dawn
and finished past midnight. The following month he flew to
Lithuania, Hungary, Hong Kong, China.
 &HT;    He believes this is a historic moment for the mentally disabled.
Indeed, seeing a place like Hidalgo from the inside is like being
transported back in time, to the year 1972, to Staten Island, when
a young Geraldo Rivera sneaked his TV camera into Willowbrook, a
state institution for the retarded, and filmed the wards crowded
with disabled children, their feces smeared on walls.
 &HT;    So horrid were conditions, the American public was moved. It
helped set off deinstitutionalization in the United States.
 &HT;    At every hospital Rosenthal's human rights investigators toured
in Mexico, they heard the same thing: Thanks to antipsychotic
medications, as many as 80 percent of patients could live in the
community if there were supervised housing programs.
 &HT;    Mexican government officials interviewed talked about new plans
to begin deinstitutionalization. But can Mexico do it without
dumping these patients into the streets? Will such a move create a
homeless mentally ill problem that would be as devastating as the
problem they're trying to solve?
 &HT;    ``What you hope,'' Rosenthal says, ``is you can help prevent
countries like Mexico from making the same mistakes we did in the
U.S. You want to catch them at this crucial moment.''
 &HT;    But what you fear is that, like some character in a young-adult
adventure novel, Rosenthal has been transported back in time to
that crucial night on the Titanic, but no one believes his
warnings, history prevails, the ship sinks, the mentally ill become
homeless.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    For all Rosenthal's efforts, his cause is still barely a blip.
Holly Burkhalter, a Washington-based human rights advocate for 20
years, says the group has had ``little if any impact'' on agencies
like Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, which shape the
world's human rights agenda.
 &HT;    ``Right now, Mental Disability Rights International is not on
their radar,'' she says. ``It's a poor reflection on the
well-funded human rights community that these issues have been
invisible to us.''
 &HT;    Until now, the main human rights focus involving mental patients
has been the misuse of psychiatry to institutionalize political
dissidents in Communist countries.
 &HT;    That work was very important, says Rosenthal, but what it
overlooked ``were the horrid conditions in those hospitals for the
thousands of Russian psychiatric patients who were mentally ill.''
 &HT;    Soviet mental hospitals routinely employed orderlies with
criminal backgrounds who beat patients, denied them access to
bathrooms unless a bribe was paid and stole food sent by their
families. There was often no individual psychotherapy or group
therapy, no recreational time or vocational training. Some
hospitals literally were prisons.
 &HT;    At the Chernyakhovsk Special Psychiatric Hospital, which had
been converted in the 1960s from a maximum security prison to a
hospital, the 446 mentally ill patients were ``locked in their
rooms'' and had to ``ask permission to go to the bathroom by
turning on a light outside the door of the cell,'' according to a
1989 State Department report.
 &HT;    The question is, How do you make the world see? How do you
establish a brand new international human right? The mental
disabilities group is working on two fronts.
 &HT;    First, it is trying to carve out a body of international law.
Ultimately this would involve a United Nations treaty guaranteeing
the rights and protections of the mentally disabled, similar to the
1987 convention against torture or the conventions in the 1980s on
the rights of women and children.
 &HT;    That, however, is not likely to happen soon. Nations are wary of
creating new rights, especially ones that cost money. As anyone who
has walked New York City's streets knows, not even rich Western
nations can be proud of their care of the mentally ill.
 &HT;    And so, in much the way that an activist American lawyer tries
to squeeze a civil rights or labor precedent from the Supreme
Court, Mental Disability Rights is trying to squeeze human rights
precedents from existing international law.
 &HT;    For this they have relied on a mix of U.N. resolutions,
including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
That treaty provides in Article 7 that ``no one shall be subjected
to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.''
 &HT;    When Rosenthal sees naked, shivering women at Hidalgo, he writes
in his report that it is a violation of Article 7 of ICCPR:
``cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.''
 &HT;    And when Dr. Juan deDios Uribe at the Hidalgo hospital tells him
that 80 percent of patients could live in the community if the
government financed group homes, Rosenthal writes that this is a
violation of the 1991 U.N. General Assembly Resolution 119,
Principles for Protection of People with Mental Illness: ``Every
person with mental illness shall have the right to live and work,
as far as possible, in the community.''
 &HT;    There is good reason for grounding the work in international
law. ``We are sending a message,'' says Rosenthal, ``that this is
not about comparing Mexico to Western standards: This is about the
violation of universal law.''
 &HT;    Unfortunately, a million violations mean nothing without world
opinion on your side, and that is the second, more important _ and
far more difficult _ change that must take place to establish a new
human right.
 &HT;    ``Basically,'' Rosenthal says, ``you have to shame the world.''

MICE MAY PLAY ROLE IN BREAST CANCER'S CAUSE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SANTA BARBARA, Calif. _ The mouse has long played the role of
victim in lab studies on cancer, but a new research paper suggests
the rodent may actually be the prime suspect in the transmission of
a virus responsible for at least some cases of breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   A paper published in this month's issue of the British Journal
of Cancer indicates that a virus _ called the mouse mammary tumor
virus _ may be transmitted to humans, and could lead to the
development of breast cancer in women.
</P>
<P>
   More than 44,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer each
year in the United States and the authors suggest that the
rodent-borne virus could be the cause of up to 40 percent of the
cases in certain areas of the country.
</P>
<P>
   The paper is bound to raise eyebrows by focusing on a seemingly
unlikely source for some cases of breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hypothesis, if true, provides a new insight into the
disease and suggests that a vaccine could be developed to prevent
it,'' said Richard Sage, one of the paper's four co-authors and an
adjunct professor of biology at the University of California at
Santa Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   Although for many years cancer researchers did not believe that
viruses caused the disease, scientists now know that several
cancers have viral causes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that the human papilloma virus can lead to cervical
cancer and hepatitis has been shown to cause liver cancer, for
instance,'' said Sage, an expert on wild and domestic mice.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers also found that the highest rates of breast
cancer occurred in countries where Mus domesticus, a certain
species of house mouse, is native or has been introduced.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer statistics show that the incidence of breast cancer is
twice as high in North America and Western Europe as in Eastern
Europe in Asia. While in the past researchers have cited factors
like diet to explain the different rates, the paper suggests that
the rates are related to the distribution of different species of
house mice.
</P>
<P>
   In areas with low rates of breast cancer, the Mus domesticus
species is not found. Where it is found _ in the United States,
Western Europe, Australia and New Zealand _ the rates of breast
cancer are high.
</P>
<P>
   Geography, then, and not diet, seems to have more to do with
increased chances for breast cancer, the authors of the report say.
</P>
<P>
   When Japanese women emigrate to the United States, where Mus
domesticus is found, their rates of breast cancer increase. Similar
findings were made among Soviet Jews: They had low rates of breast
cancer while living in the former Soviet Union, but once they
emigrated to Israel _ where Mus domesticus also makes its home _
their rates increased, the researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   But the study leaves many questions unanswered, and the
researchers emphasize that their work is just beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the very early days,'' said Dr. Thomas Stewart, a
co-author of the study who works at the University of Ottawa at
Ottawa Hospital. ``This is a hypothesis, but it's all testable.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart said that scientists from the National Cancer Institute
in the United States and its Canadian counterpart have snubbed some
of the researchers' ideas.
</P>
<P>
   A recently published 1,500-page book on the epidemiology of
cancer by the NCI's chief geneticist completely ignored the mouse
mammary tumor virus, Stewart said. This despite DNA studies that
date back to 1981 showing correlations between the rodent-borne
virus and breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are going to be slightly offended by some of what
we've found,'' Stewart said. ``But the evidence is so compelling. I
would say we've found one of the strongest correlations for breast
cancer in the last 100 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Probably the most significant question that needs to be
addressed is how viruses in mice are transmitted to humans, the
researchers said. Although there are some theories, little research
is available in the area. At the very least, the scientists say,
their research poses many important questions that need to be
answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of work that hasn't been done yet needs to be done,''
said Sage.

MARKS &AMP; SPENCER APPOINTS A BELGIAN CHAIRMAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ALAN COWELL

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Marks &AMP; Spencer, Britain's august but ailing retailer,
broke with a long tradition and reached beyond the nation's shores
Monday to hire a new executive chairman, offering a $22 million
package to lure the Belgian-born Luc Vandevelde from Promodes, a
leading France-based grocery chain.
</P>
<P>
   Vandevelde, who will join the 116-year-old British company on
Feb. 28, is a high-profile emblem of its increasingly desperate
effort to reverse the fortunes that have not only sullied its
one-time image as the flagship of British retailing but also
inspired talk of a takeover bid.
</P>
<P>
   With a background largely in food retailing, however,
Vandevelde's vaunted successes at Promodes, which the French
retailing giant Carrefour is in the process of purchasing, may not
translate too easily into turning Marks &AMP; Spencer around. The
company has been fighting a losing battle with rivals like Next PLC
and Hennes and Mauritz of Sweden in the midrange clothing market.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he does bring is a fresh look, because virtually
everybody else there has been at Marks &AMP; Spencer for a long time,''
said Ian Macdougal, a retail analyst with the brokerage firm
Williams de Broe.
</P>
<P>
   In historical terms, Vandevelde's appointment _ agreed on late
Sunday night and announced Monday _ is a big shift in corporate
culture for an organization that until the premature departure last
June of Sir Richard Greenbury, its previous executive chairman, had
been run by a coterie of longtime Marks &AMP; Spencer executives.
</P>
<P>
   The leadership change made little impact on investors Monday and
the company's stock ended down 1.5 percent at 304.25 pence, or
$5.02. While the share price has risen about 4 percent this month
because of takeover talk, it fell last year by 29 percent.
``Vandevelde has still got a lot to prove,'' said Alan Harris, a
fund manager at Charles Stanley &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   That Marks &AMP; Spencer sought an outsider _ and a non-British one
at that _ reflected the extent of the problems at the company,
which owns the Brooks Bros. chain in the United States. Since late
1997, Marks &AMP; Spencer's profits have been sliding as Main Street
Britain decided that the chain's clothing range was simply dowdy
and too expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to reverse the decline, Peter Salsbury, the chief
executive, ordered increased spending on advertising, new store
layouts and new clothing ranges. He also canceled contracts with
British clothing suppliers, breaking a long tradition of buying
British, to reduce costs.
</P>
<P>
   But according to a research report issued by Salomon Smith
Barney on Jan. 13, Marks &AMP; Spencer's year-end sales figures, a
closely watched barometer, were ``better than worst fears but
offered no sign of decisive recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   The company has acknowledged that sales were down 2.8 percent
for the 15 weeks to Jan. 8, depressed largely by dwindling demand
for its clothes _ once a hallmark of good value. ``It is hard to
take an upbeat view of the prospects for a rapid recovery,'' the
research note said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The company has been looking for a new executive chairman for
over six months. But there was some surprise that it got
Vandevelde, who had been designated for the No. 2 job at the
combined group to emerge from last year's proposed merger of
Promodes and Carrefour, a combination that would create Europe's
biggest retailer and the world's second-biggest after Wal-Mart
Stores.
</P>
<P>
   Vandevelde had been credited with helping strengthen the
Promodes share price sixfold after joining the company as president
and chief operating officer in 1995 following 24 years with Kraft
Jacobs Suchard.
</P>
<P>
   Appointed as chairman of Promodes less than a year ago, he was
credited with helping expand the French group into an international
giant with 6,000 outlets in 16 countries. But, analysts said, he
had bridled at taking the No. 2 slot after the merger with
Carrefour.
</P>
<P>
   Marks &AMP; Spencer said his compensation package included a basic
salary of $1.1 million that could be doubled by performance-linked
bonuses. Additionally, he will receive shares and stock options
totaling over $20 million _ a significant package by British
standards. He will report to Salsbury, the chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Marks &AMP; Spencer's decline has inspired increasing speculation
about a takeover bid either from the retail entrepreneur Philip
Green or even from Tesco, Britain's No. 1 supermarket chain.
</P>
<P>
   Vandevelde declined to discuss how he would respond to such
overtures. ``If someone comes up with a bid, we'll deal with it
when it happens,'' he said. ``Nobody can ever refuse to look at a
bid if it is a serious one.''

NEW STUDY FOCUSES ON LESBIANS AND AIDS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The first federally funded study of HIV-infected
lesbians and other women who have sex with women is under way in
five major U.S. cities. The research is an effort to learn more
about the risks facing this little-researched group.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control, the three-year
study of 200 HIV-positive women in Baltimore, Los Angeles, New
York, San Francisco and Washington should shed light on the ways in
which women can contract the AIDS virus from a female partner.
</P>
<P>
   Epidemiologists have long believed that oral sex and other
intimate behavior between women is an inefficient way to transmit
the disease. Only two cases of female-to-female transmitted HIV
have been reported to the CDC, and they were never confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   But researchers aren't ruling out the possibility of a
female-to-female-borne AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't say with absolute assurance that female-to-female
transmission never occurs,'' said Dr. Helene Gayle, director of the
CDC's National Center for HIV, STD and TB Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers should be able to make a stronger case for or
against such an occurrence once the study is completed in
September. Now in the final stage of data collection, the research
is scheduled to be published later this year.
</P>
<P>
   The findings could provide a basis for a more informed message
of HIV-prevention for female sexual partners.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gayle said the current scarcity of data on the issue is
unacceptable. ``It's been fairly unsatisfying to say it's rare, but
we really hope that this will answer some of those questions,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Women accounted for 32 percent of adult cases of HIV infections
from July 1998 to June 1999, according to the latest figures
compiled by the CDC. New Jersey and Florida led the nation in HIV
infections with 13,259 and 11,625 cases respectively, the CDC
found. These two states also had the most cases of female HIV
infections.
</P>
<P>
   One question for researchers is whether lesbians, bisexuals and
other women who have had sexual contact with a woman at some point
in their lives can contract HIV independent of other risky behavior
like injection drug use.
</P>
<P>
   A December 1998 CDC survey found that 98 percent of women with
AIDS who reported having sex with women had been exposed to another
risk _ injection drug use in most cases.
</P>
<P>
   Now researchers hope to rule out those other HIV-risk factors
through a sophisticated DNA analysis coupled with face-to-face
interviews _ some of which will be conducted with a woman's sexual
partner.
</P>
<P>
   No previous study has attempted to substantiate female-to-female
transmission of HIV in such a comprehensive manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first federally funded study of a population that
has not been looked at before,'' said Renee Culver, who is
coordinating the Washington study of 50 women at the Whitman-Walker
Clinic. ``One would think its time has come.''
</P>
<P>
   Both gay and straight women over age 18 are being recruited for
the CDC study, potentially broadening the definition of groups that
are at risk of acquiring HIV.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC defines lesbians as women who have had sex with women
but have not had sex with men since 1977. The study, however, takes
into account the fact that not all women who have a sexual
encounter with a woman identify themselves as gay.
</P>
<P>
   The research conceivably could target women who may be married
but are having lesbian affairs. Some may be heterosexuals who
briefly experimented with the same sex, while others may have been
coerced into a homosexual act. Still others may be uncomfortable
revealing their sexual orientation, the study's researchers point
out.
</P>
<P>
   The lesbian community has always questioned the notion that the
risk of HIV between women is low.
</P>
<P>
   When the epidemic first erupted among gay men in the early
1980s, gay women, many of whom cared for their dying gay male
friends, were quick to ask, ``Are we next?''
</P>
<P>
   ``As this epidemic has matured over the last two decades, we are
seeing that it is not only a white, gay male disease but it is a
disease that can affect everybody,'' said Dr. Lisa Weissmann, vice
president of the Gay and Lesbian Medical Association in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Weissmann, an oncologist, welcomed the research as a chance
to shed a myth. ``It's not reasonable to think that this is a
disease that cannot be spread from women to women.''

   SCOTUS-FUNDRAISING (Washington) _ Ruling in a Missouri campaign
finance case with important national implications, the Supreme
Court on Monday decisively upheld limits on campaign contributions
and rejected the argument that inflation has rendered
unconstitutionally low the $1,000 limit it upheld 24 years ago. The
6-3 decision left states with considerable latitude either to adopt
the federal limit, still the $1,000 the court upheld in its
much-disputed Buckley vs. Valeo decision, or to experiment with
even lower contribution caps, as a number of states recently have.

 By JAMES TRAUB  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Last fall, the New York State Education Department released the
results of a fourth-grade math test and eighth-grade math and
language tests.
 &HT;    It will come as no surprise to hear that the numbers for
students in New York City were dreadful. About two-thirds of city
eighth graders failed the English language arts test, and about
three-quarters failed in math; half the fourth graders failed the
math test.
 &HT;    The results provided fuel for those who felt that New York City
schools are underfinanced, that the city uses too many uncertified
teachers, that academic standards are low, that junior high schools
are neglected and that the tests themselves are unfair.
 &HT;    There's some merit in all these notions. What was not said,
however, was the obvious. The city districts that performed poorly,
like those that performed well, scored almost exactly as the
socioeconomic status of the children in them would have predicted.
 &HT;    You could have predicted the fourth-grade test scores of all but
one of the city's 32 districts merely by knowing the percentage of
students in a given district who qualified for a free lunch. Only a
few dozen of the city's 675 elementary schools scored well despite
high poverty rates. In other words, good schools aren't doing that
much good, and bad schools aren't doing that much harm.
 &HT;    This is the case in virtually every big city in the country.
Though over the past 35 years we have poured billions of dollars
into inner-city schools, and though we have fiddled with
practically everything you could think to fiddle with, we have done
almost nothing to raise the trajectory of ghetto children. This is
a fact, but it is one of those painful facts that it seems better
to ignore.
 &HT;    Why say anything that could discourage the children, parents and
teachers who so desperately need encouragement? Why give aid and
comfort to the opponents of high standards? After all, we know that
some schools succeed where others fail. We know that some reforms
work better than others.
 &HT;    In a recently published book, ``Choosing Equality,'' Joseph P.
Viteritti, a professor of public policy at New York University,
describes the failure of one innovation after another before
embarking on a defense of the one reform he believes in, school
choice.
 &HT;    Or perhaps, if the answer isn't choice, it's something else.
Surely there must be some way of making a difference in the lives
of poor children.
 &HT;    Indeed, you can't spend much time in the schools and not believe
in the efficacy of reform. In the past few years, I have visited
dozens of schools, almost all of them serving inner-city children
and most of them exemplary in one way or another.
 &HT;    I have been to charter schools where concerned parents and
educators have wrested control of the classrooms from ineffective
bureaucracies, and also to schools with effective leaders and
schools with traditional curricula and schools with ``less is
more'' curricula and schools with ``multiple intelligences''
teaching styles.
 &HT;    The good news is that we know more about what works than we did
even a decade ago. Should what is left of the ideological fog
surrounding education evaporate, we might even agree on a better
mousetrap.
 &HT;    But how much better? How powerful can this one institution be in
the face of the kind of disadvantages that so many ghetto children
bring with them to the schoolhouse door, and return to at home?
 &HT;    In ``An American Imperative,'' a minutely detailed study of
educational inequality published in 1995, Scott Miller, a scholar
now affiliated with the College Board, wrote that while ``some
strategies for investing resources in disadvantaged children are
substantially more productive than others ... there is little
evidence that any existing strategy can close more than a fraction
of the overall achievement gap'' separating children with low
socioeconomic status from their wealthier, largely suburban
counterparts.
 &HT;    The idea that school, by itself, cannot cure poverty is hardly
astonishing, but it is amazing how much of our political discourse
is implicitly predicated on the notion that it can.
 &HT;    The national debate over entrenched poverty virtually ended with
welfare reform. We now speak of the inner-city poor as if they were
a remote tribe that has not yet been exposed to the miracle of the
marketplace.
 &HT;    In November, President Clinton was able to announce his
antipoverty initiative jointly with Speaker Dennis Hastert because
the plan was so vague and modest _ it came down to encouraging
private investment in the inner cities _ that the GOP was happy to
sign off on it.
 &HT;    But the same congressional Republicans who oppose on principal
virtually all federal programs focused on the urban poor also voted
to add $2 billion to Clinton's request for Title I, the main source
of federal funds for schools in high-poverty areas.
 &HT;    George W. Bush has come out in favor of increased spending by
the federal Department of Education. And in recent years
conservatives have come to play a critical role in the debate over
inner-city schools. Indeed, school reform is the one type of social
engineering with which conservatives feel comfortable.
 &HT;    Although education is fundamentally a local issue, and national
politicians can do very little about it, we will probably hear a
great deal more about the schools as we enter the primary season
and the presidential campaign.
 &HT;    Bush is running as a ``compassionate conservative,'' which is to
say that he cares about the poor and will not simply consign them
to the whim of the marketplace. What this means in practice,
however, is that he believes in school reform.
 &HT;    Last fall, Bush seemed to be visiting an inner-city school every
week. In his speeches he returns constantly to the virtues of
market-driven school reforms like vouchers and charter schools, as
well as to the need for rigorous academic standards for
high-poverty schools.
 &HT;    Al Gore takes a very different view of the matter _ although he,
like Bush, thinks education is the main answer to poverty. Gore is
in favor of high standards _ if any national figure isn't, he
hasn't stuck his head up yet _ but he also wants to spend more
money to fix crumbling school buildings and to hire more teachers
to decrease class size.
 &HT;    The Democrats say that the current system can be made to work
with the right incentives, while Republicans think the system has
to be forced to change through competition. Though largely agreeing
with Gore, Bill Bradley has at least begun to create a platform
that places school reform within the context of broader antipoverty
policies.
 &HT;    But no candidate can, it appears, afford to reckon with the
seemingly intractable nature of inner-city poverty. It is hard to
think of a more satisfying solution to poverty than education.
School reform involves relatively little money and no large-scale
initiatives, asks practically nothing of the nonpoor and is
accompanied by the ennobling sensation that comes from expressing
faith in the capacity of the poor to overcome disadvantage by
themselves.
 &HT;    Conversely, the idea that schools by themselves can't cure
poverty not only sounds like an un-American vote of no confidence
in our capacity for self-transformation but also seems to flirt
with the racialist theories expressed by Charles Murray and Richard
Herrnstein, who argued in ``The Bell Curve'' that educational
inequality is rooted in biological inequality.
 &HT;    An alternative explanation, of course, is that educational
inequality is rooted in economic problems and social pathologies
too deep to be overcome by school alone.
 &HT;    And if that's true, of course, then there's every reason to
think about the limits of school, and to think about the other
institutions we might have to mobilize to solve the problem. We
might even ask ourselves whether there isn't something disingenuous
and self-serving in our professed faith in the omnipotence of
school.
 &HT;    The idea that bad schools perpetuate poverty, and that good
schools can go a long way toward curing it, is quite new and, like
most current ideas about entrenched poverty, dates to the civil
rights era.
 &HT;    One provision of the 1964 Civil Rights Act mandated the
publication of a survey ``concerning the lack of availability of
educational opportunities for individuals by reason of race, color,
religion or national origin in public educational institutions.''
 &HT;    The sociologist James Coleman was asked to head up the survey
project. The implicit assumption behind the survey, an assumption
that Coleman said at the time he shared, was that black children
were failing because the segregated schools they attended were
grossly underfinanced.
 &HT;    Coleman found that black students were, in fact, highly
segregated, but he also concluded that resources like school
libraries and laboratories were distributed more equally than was
widely believed and, far more startling, that ``differences in
school facilities and curriculum, which are the major variables by
which attempts are made to improve schools, are so little related
to achievement levels of students that, with few exceptions, their
effect fails to appear even in a survey of this magnitude.''
 &HT;    Coleman found that everything schools did accounted for only 5
percent to 35 percent of the variation in students' academic
performances, though he did find that the figures for disadvantaged
students were at the higher end of the scale.
 &HT;    He concluded that ``the inequalities imposed on children by
their home, neighborhood and peer environment are carried along to
become the inequalities with which they confront adult life at the
end of school.''
 &HT;    This was, if true, astonishing and deeply unsettling news.
Nobody believes in school the way Americans do, and no one is more
tantalized by its transformative powers.
 &HT;    School is central to the American myth of self-transcendence,
whether it's Thomas Jefferson's seedbed of the republican spirit,
or the one-room schoolhouse that propelled Abe Lincoln out of
frontier backwardness, or those teeming junior high schools in
Brooklyn that served as the melting pot for three generations of
children from Russia and Italy and Ireland.
 &HT;    In the national myth _ and of course not only in myth _ school
has the miraculous power of leveling inequalities even as it lifts
everyone. And by the time Coleman came along we had come to expect
far more of school than we ever had before, because we were firmly
entrenched in a meritocratic culture in which the most important
rewards were decided by school success.
 &HT;    Coleman's argument that schools essentially passed along
inequality was simply unacceptable, and largely ignored.
 &HT;    In the 1960s, the nation embarked upon a vast and utterly
unprecedented national experiment in the use of schooling to
alleviate poverty. Of all Washington's undertakings, the most
popular, and the most romantic, was the Head Start program for
impoverished preschool-age children, which continues to this day to
be thought of as the one Great Society program that really worked.
 &HT;    Head Start began in 1965, and President Johnson immediately fell
in love with the imagery of little children playing with scissors
and glue. He ramped the program up within the first year from $18
million to $50 million to $150 million, and he bragged that Head
Start was raising children's IQ scores 10 points.
 &HT;    Researchers have known from the virtual outset of the program
that Head Start had no effect at all on IQ scores.
 &HT;    And although beneficiaries were somewhat less likely than
nonbeneficiaries to be left back, or placed in special-education
classes, whatever gains children made on test scores faded out
within a year or two.
 &HT;    A 1985 study by the Department of Health and Human Services
concluded that ``in the long run, cognitive and socioemotional test
scores of former Head Start students do not remain superior to
those of disadvantaged students who did not attend Head Start.''
 &HT;    A 1995 study found no difference between siblings who did and
did not attend Head Start.
 &HT;    It was also in 1965 that Congress passed Title I of the
Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which provided federal
funds to local school districts with high concentrations of
impoverished students. Title I now reaches 10 million children,
including one in every five first graders.
 &HT;    Over the years about $100 billion has been dispensed through the
program. The annual budget is now $7.7 billion, though Congress
just voted to increase th e amount to $9.9 billion.
 &HT;    Until the law was amended in 1994, most school districts used
their Title I money to offer additional instruction, mostly in
reading, to students who were falling behind. In effect, students
took an extra half-hour class in reading every day, generally using
the same methods that had already failed.
 &HT;    The Title I results are even more unequivocal than those for
Head Start. A 1997 study conducted for the Department of Education
concluded that ``there were no differences in growth'' between
students who did and did not receive Title I assistance.
 &HT;    Finally, it was in the late 1960s and early '70's that
desegregation moved decisively from the courts to the schools.
Throughout the South, where Jim Crow had reigned, desegregation was
a matter of simple justice.
 &HT;    But in the North and Midwest, where whites as well as blacks had
to be bused, and often a very long way, it was critical to
demonstrate a significant benefit to black students to justify the
disruption and discontent.
 &HT;    The Supreme Court had been persuaded by the views of the
psychologist Kenneth Clark that desegregation could help black
children overcome the stigma of inferiority conferred by
segregation.
 &HT;    Coleman had, in fact, found an ``integration effect,'' which he
explained by suggesting that black students in largely white
schools experienced ``a greater sense of control'' over their own
destinies than students in segregated schools. But most subsequent
studies found that the effect was only a modest one.
 &HT;    A 1975 survey of the best-designed studies of integration's
effects found that more than half disclosed ``no significant
difference'' between segregated and nonsegregated black students.
 &HT;    The Harvard sociologist Christopher Jencks concluded in his 1972
book, ``Inequality,'' that desegregation could close the academic
gap by no more than 10 to 20 percent _ which struck him as too
small an effect to trump the issue of parental preference.
 &HT;    Over the past two decades, desegregation has faded as a remedy
in part because many parents, including black parents, do not feel
that the disruption is worth the gain. Head Start, Title I and a
host of other programs have gone a long way toward proving that
money does not buy educational equality.
 &HT;    Although the premise of many a crusading volume, including
Jonathan Kozol's ``Savage Inequalities,'' is that ghetto schools
have been allowed to rot, many of the most catastrophically failing
school districts, like Newark's, spend far more money per student
than do middle-class communities nearby.
 &HT;    Labor economists have had a field day proving that school
spending is not correlated with school achievement. And that
desegregation never had nearly the academic effect its advocates
hoped for shows that equality of educational opportunity is now
much more elusive than it once seemed to be.
 &HT;    Since we don't know how much school can be made to matter, we
should work to reform schools as if there were no limit to their
powers to compensate for disadvantage. But we also have to reckon
with how modest the accomplishments of reform have been, especially
with regard to the gap between white students and poor (though not
necessarily poor) black students.
 &HT;    Although black students now earn high-school diplomas at
virtually the same rate as whites _ an extraordinary achievement in
itself _ they are enrolling in, and graduating from, college at a
much lower rate. Despite significant gains, blacks are still
scoring about 200 points below whites on College Boards.
 &HT;    And despite improvements in reading scores, the average black
17-year-old is reading at a 13-year-old level. According to one
study, the racial gap in language scores approximately doubles
between the time a black student enters school and the time she
leaves.
 &HT;    There is reason to believe that schools can make some kind of
difference, but right now they are not making nearly enough.

Start was raising children's IQ scores 10 points.
 &HT;    Researchers have known from the virtual outset of the program
that Head Start had no effect at all on IQ scores.
 &HT;    And although beneficiaries were somewhat less likely than
nonbeneficiaries to be left back, or placed in special-education
classes, whatever gains children made on test scores faded out
within a year or two.
 &HT;    A 1985 study by the Department of Health and Human Services
concluded that ``in the long run, cognitive and socioemotional test
scores of former Head Start students do not remain superior to
those of disadvantaged students who did not attend Head Start.''
 &HT;    A 1995 study found no difference between siblings who did and
did not attend Head Start.
 &HT;    It was also in 1965 that Congress passed Title I of the
Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which provided federal
funds to local school districts with high concentrations of
impoverished students. Title I now reaches 10 million children,
including one in every five first graders.
 &HT;    Over the years about $100 billion has been dispensed through the
program. The annual budget is now $7.7 billion, though Congress
just voted to increase th e amount to $9.9 billion.
 &HT;    Until the law was amended in 1994, most school districts used
their Title I money to offer additional instruction, mostly in
reading, to students who were falling behind. In effect, students
took an extra half-hour class in reading every day, generally using
the same methods that had already failed.
 &HT;    The Title I results are even more unequivocal than those for
Head Start. A 1997 study conducted for the Department of Education
concluded that ``there were no differences in growth'' between
students who did and did not receive Title I assistance.
 &HT;    Finally, it was in the late 1960s and early '70's that
desegregation moved decisively from the courts to the schools.
Throughout the South, where Jim Crow had reigned, desegregation was
a matter of simple justice.
 &HT;    But in the North and Midwest, where whites as well as blacks had
to be bused, and often a very long way, it was critical to
demonstrate a significant benefit to black students to justify the
disruption and discontent.
 &HT;    The Supreme Court had been persuaded by the views of the
psychologist Kenneth Clark that desegregation could help black
children overcome the stigma of inferiority conferred by
segregation.
 &HT;    Coleman had, in fact, found an ``integration effect,'' which he
explained by suggesting that black students in largely white
schools experienced ``a greater sense of control'' over their own
destinies than students in segregated schools. But most subsequent
studies found that the effect was only a modest one.
 &HT;    A 1975 survey of the best-designed studies of integration's
effects found that more than half disclosed ``no significant
difference'' between segregated and nonsegregated black students.
 &HT;    The Harvard sociologist Christopher Jencks concluded in his 1972
book, ``Inequality,'' that desegregation could close the academic
gap by no more than 10 to 20 percent _ which struck him as too
small an effect to trump the issue of parental preference.
 &HT;    Over the past two decades, desegregation has faded as a remedy
in part because many parents, including black parents, do not feel
that the disruption is worth the gain. Head Start, Title I and a
host of other programs have gone a long way toward proving that
money does not buy educational equality.
 &HT;    Although the premise of many a crusading volume, including
Jonathan Kozol's ``Savage Inequalities,'' is that ghetto schools
have been allowed to rot, many of the most catastrophically failing
school districts, like Newark's, spend far more money per student
than do middle-class communities nearby.
 &HT;    Labor economists have had a field day proving that school
spending is not correlated with school achievement. And that
desegregation never had nearly the academic effect its advocates
hoped for shows that equality of educational opportunity is now
much more elusive than it once seemed to be.
 &HT;    Since we don't know how much school can be made to matter, we
should work to reform schools as if there were no limit to their
powers to compensate for disadvantage. But we also have to reckon
with how modest the accomplishments of reform have been, especially
with regard to the gap between white students and poor (though not
necessarily poor) black students.
 &HT;    Although black students now earn high-school diplomas at
virtually the same rate as whites _ an extraordinary achievement in
itself _ they are enrolling in, and graduating from, college at a
much lower rate. Despite significant gains, blacks are still
scoring about 200 points below whites on College Boards.
 &HT;    And despite improvements in reading scores, the average black
17-year-old is reading at a 13-year-old level. According to one
study, the racial gap in language scores approximately doubles
between the time a black student enters school and the time she
leaves.
 &HT;    There is reason to believe that schools can make some kind of
difference, but right now they are not making nearly enough.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Any organization reflects its leader, as Al Gore says, and for
most of last year his presidential campaign was the outward sign of
an inward turmoil.
 &HT;    At the beginning of 1999, he was certain to stroll to the
Democratic nomination.
 &HT;    Who would have predicted that, before the year was out, he would
change campaign managers and chiefs of staff, replace his pollsters
and his admen, truck his headquarters from Washington to Nashville
and begin the year 2000 worried he would have less cash on hand
after the New Hampshire primary than Bill Bradley, the challenger
he once dismissed?
 &HT;    Though born and bred for higher office and schooled by Bill
Clinton for seven years in the getting and holding of the
presidency, Gore was unprepared to run for the job to a degree
baffling to some of his advisers.
 &HT;    This past year _ particularly the past four months _ has
provided a bracing political education for a man who had no clue
how much he needed it.
 &HT;    ``It's sort of like the experience that most of us have in
getting older,'' the vice president told me during a rare
appearance in his West Wing office, a few days before Christmas.
``You look back at a previous point in your life and find it
difficult to believe how little you knew. I look back now at the
beginning of the year, while the impeachment trial was about to
begin and incoming rounds were landing on the White House roof
every 30 seconds, and I can't believe that I decided to put the
campaign on K Street.'' He roared with laughter. ``You know ...
HELLO?''
 &HT;    That Gore is still talking in detail about that education is
evidence that it remains under way. The early, very public
incompetence of his campaign created a political problem that he is
still struggling to solve. It lent weight to Democrats' central
concern about him, that he lacked the political wherewithal to beat
an impressive Republican candidate.
 &HT;    To combat the relentlessly negative reviews of his campaign,
Gore has been forced to make the quality of his campaigning central
to his candidacy, to ballyhoo the move of his headquarters to
Nashville, for example, while Bradley kept on talking about health
care or child poverty and his advisers remained silently behind
their curtains.
 &HT;    This has repeatedly returned Gore to the same shaky ground _ his
political ability _ while lending heft to a related doubt about
him: that he is a programmable man guided more by tactics than
beliefs. Gore's problem, in short, has been less alpha or beta than
meta.
 &HT;    It's a peculiar problem, for what Gore has been learning this
past year is how to be a politician _ which is, of course, the job
description of a candidate. Unfortunately for Gore, however, it is
a dirty word. But what is so wicked about a politician politicking?
This year, candidates and reporters are condemning politics and
praising ``authenticity.''
 &HT;    Antipolitics has been with us for some time now. Authenticity is
this campaign's variant, a kind of characterological shorthand for
everything politics allegedly is not _ honest, deep, real. But
those who tout authenticity are making an almost useless
distinction, at least as far as campaigning goes.
 &HT;    If authenticity is what the people want (and, help me here, when
was it that they clamored for fakery?), then it is a political act
to give it to them. Was it ``authentic'' for Bradley as a senator
to study Elvis Presley movies in hopes of honing his communication
skills? He was looking to change himself to appeal to people, the
essence of inauthenticity.
 &HT;    On the other hand, he was hoping to appeal to people in order to
lead them, the essence of good politics.
 &HT;    The phony divide between authenticity and politicking was
captured by the tumult earlier this month over John McCain's
letters pressuring the FCC to speed up a decision important to a
donor. Captain Campaign Reform suddenly looked like just another
politician.
 &HT;    Yes, by all means take the excessive money out of politics; but
don't take the politics out, to paraphrase Clinton. In policing the
bureaucracy on behalf of his constituents, including donors, McCain
was being who he is, an authentic politician. Put another way, he
was doing his job.
 &HT;    Gore's chief problem is that deep down he suspects it is
dishonorable to be a politician, and this can make him a bad one.
He reminds me a bit of some second-generation auto dealers, the
expensively educated sons of self-made men who balk at the tactics
of the family business they know so intimately.
 &HT;    ``He doesn't really like politics,'' one of Gore's closest aides
told me. ``He holds it in disdain.'' But he is gradually coming to
terms with his outer politician.
 &HT;    As with the move to Nashville, campaign gestures that were
entirely political _ gestures that Gore feared would be derided as
entirely political _ have had political effects that have reminded
him what is so great about politics: It connects candidates with
voters.
 &HT;    This was illustrated by his challenge to Bradley that they
forego political advertising and hold plenty of debates instead.
Pundits immediately dismissed the proposal as a political gimmick.
They were right that it was a gimmick. They were wrong to dismiss
it.
 &HT;    Gore was led, by political considerations, to suggest a reform
that would have elevated the discussion and released some of the
money pressure. His offer left Bradley in the position of defending
30-second commercials as a more effective means of communication.
Which is the more cynical _ or if you prefer, ``political'' _
position? Who cares?
 &HT;    As a politician, Gore is making progress. Man, message and
political machine mesh more smoothly now than four months ago. The
changes in each did not come at once, but they occurred over
roughly the same time _ just before and after Gore shifted his
headquarters to Nashville in October _ and they reinforced one
another.
 &HT;    A new team of loyal advisers, his own competitive nature and a
rediscovery of his competence at face-to-face politicking have
probably given him enough confidence and focus to win the
Democratic nomination, barring any egregious blunders.
 &HT;    Before small groups this fall and winter, Gore has displayed a
mastery of intricate matters, a knack for explaining them and an
agile sense of humor. He has also become a better debater, finally
swallowing his aggravation with Clinton and expressing some pride
in the work they did together _ managing to take credit for Clinton
administration policies without embracing, or trashing, Clinton the
man.
 &HT;    Gore has been relearning what it is to seek votes for himself,
and in this quest he has been aided not by soul-searching but by
pros who never lose sleep about whether some tactic is too
political.
 &HT;    Notwithstanding the enthusiasm of some longtime Tennessee
volunteers and young staff members, though, I found little burning
passion for Gore among his advisers. He is too familiar and too
lacking in charisma, and too many of his aides have seen too many
candidates.
 &HT;    They say that he is no natural politician, for all his
confidence in his own political acumen. But this is not to say his
aides are not dedicated to electing him. While they may not marvel
at his magnetism or vision, his advisers talk with deep respect of
his decency, policy judgment and commitment to public service. If
this is not the Clinton crusade of 1992, it is also not the Clinton
advertising firm of 1996.
 &HT;    The move to Nashville, which could have been a disaster, has
produced a leaner, more spirited team. Junior staff members go out
for beers with one another at night, rather than with college pals
in Washington.
 &HT;    Without other familiar distractions, they come into the office
on weekends and go to work. This group will build up a lot more
passion if the race becomes a contest between Gore and Bush, rather
than two centrist Democrats whose dislike for each other has
concealed how little difference there is between them politically.
 &HT;    It has been widely reported that Karenna Gore Schiff, his
daughter, and Naomi Wolf, the writer and Gore consultant, had urged
the vice president to distance himself from the president. This is
true. But it understates the sway that this theory already held,
and holds, among his staff members. It is campaign orthodoxy. This
has led the campaign to play down Gore's impressive work in the
Clinton administration in favor of his prior work.
 &HT;    ``It's not what matters so much in this election,'' Karenna Gore
Schiff said of the last seven years. ``What matters is who the
candidates are and what they're going to do, and my dad's
experience goes pretty far back. It goes back to 1976, not 1992.''
 &HT;    Personally, Gore remains resentful of Clinton and angry at him
for enmeshing him in his scandals, his associates say. But his
efforts to distance himself are driven more by a political
calculation that voters still see him as Clinton's yes man, rather
than as a leader _ in fact, a ``fighter'' _ in his own right, and
theirs.
 &HT;    Gore and Clinton still talk by telephone two or three times a
week. But when I asked Gore if he had ever consulted Clinton about
the campaign, he immediately said no. ``He's a skilled
politician,'' Gore said, ``and from time to time in our
conversations he will offer some advice.''
 &HT;    There are two possibilities here: Either Gore is fibbing, in
which case he still feels obliged to exaggerate his personal
distance from Clinton, or in fact the gap is quite significant, and
despite the galaxy of advisers he has consulted, he chooses to
overlook the Democrat who knows best how to run both as a
challenger and as an incumbent.
 &HT;    For his part, Clinton misses Gore's advice, presidential aides
say. Clinton trusted Gore to tell the truth and Gore was able to
use sarcasm to puncture Clinton's self-pitying or bombastic moods.
 &HT;    But Gore's advisers believe that the vice president had to
separate himself from Clinton because he is, in the campaign's
formulation, ``famous but unknown.''
 &HT;    The campaign found, for example, that most voters did not know
that Gore had ever been anything but a politician. They had to
sharpen Gore's biography and weave it into his standard stump
speech. They zeroed in on dramatic points in Gore's own life and
also the lives of his parents.
 &HT;    Gore had spoken about all these matters, intermittently and
sometimes movingly, for years. Now he was meshing them in a tight
triad of parables that would give a narrative edge to his standard
stump speech and to the populist theme that would define Gore's
career: that he was a fighter against special interests, as one
senior Gore strategist put it, ``representing the people against
THEM.''
 &HT;    Television audiences have not been thoroughly impressed,
however, and this may be one of the reasons why he continues to lag
as many as 10 points behind George W. Bush nationally. Somehow, for
all his credentials and experience, Gore comes off seeming like
less than the sum of his parts.
 &HT;    In debate, the vice president has been reluctant to take risks.
When he has, the result has been damaging, as when he foolishly
declared that in appointing Joint Chiefs of Staff he would make
support for gays in the military a litmus test. That comment
yielded yet another ``hastily assembled press conference,'' as
reporters invariably call them, which is something of a Gore
signature.
 &HT;    Often, Gore seems to be trying too hard. Discussing affirmative
action in a town-hall-style debate in Manchester in mid-December,
Gore made a telling point, observing that the host had evidently
failed to invite many blacks.
 &HT;    But then he went too far: ``Are there any?'' he asked, looking
around and starting to point. ``There's one _ one in _ in back
there.''
 &HT;    Though he has grown more comfortable with each debate, Gore
still tends to fall back on catapulting jagged speech chunks
through the air. His performances recall his 1996 debate with Jack
Kemp, when in his answers he repeatedly chanted a mantra
(``Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment'') as though
the television audience were being sleep-taught.
 &HT;    After that debate, my grandmother, a believer in Clinton and
Gore, left a pained message on my answering machine: ``Does he
think I am stupid?''
 &HT;    This year, ``I want to fight for you'' is proving to be the
patronizing mantra.
 &HT;    Gore knows better. ``These techniques inevitably encourage
inauthenticity in a politician's message,'' he wrote of the dangers
of sound bites, polling and ``personality skills'' in his 1992 best
seller, ``Earth in the Balance.'' ``Why present genuine ideas and
true character if artificial ones are more effective in the
marketplace of power.''
 &HT;    When I read some of Gore's words back to him, he told me that he
was no longer so concerned about political manipulation, because
the audience has grown as sophisticated as the candidates and their
consultants.
 &HT;    ``And what has resulted is that only one thing really works, and
that is what's real,'' he said. ``There may be people who are
skilled enough and smart enough to use these personality tools to
shape their image and affect and appear to be something they're
not. I'm not one of them.''
 &HT;    Exactly so. But what is real still needs politics to be
expressed.
 &HT;    Gore's attempts to reach TV audiences often reek of the
greasepaint he rightly scorns. As he picks at Bradley, he looks
political, and that may hurt his chances with the independents and
moderates who, paradoxically, are the very people who are most
likely to share his disdain for politics.
 &HT;    They might be more impressed if he showed the side of himself
that privately deflects operatives' suggestions with the arch
question, ``Isn't that awfully political?''
 &HT;    Bradley so far has bested Gore largely on style points. His ease
in public, his seeming candor and his apparent disregard for
old-school maneuvering have managed to make Gore seem
simultaneously clumsy and slick. Gore may lack a common touch or
patrician grace, yet he has learned, in meeting with voters away
from the television cameras, that he can make a style of substance.
 &HT;    In that setting, he communicates without contempt for the
process or the people who take it seriously, as they should. He has
to learn to take that skill on the air. He will need it in the
downtime between the primaries and the Democratic convention,
should he get that far. He will need it in the general election;
and he will need it to govern.
 &HT;    Before Gore can hope to seem like less of a politician, he will
have to become more of one.

HELLO?''
 &HT;    That Gore is still talking in detail about that education is
evidence that it remains under way. The early, very public
incompetence of his campaign created a political problem that he is
still struggling to solve. It lent weight to Democrats' central
concern about him, that he lacked the political wherewithal to beat
an impressive Republican candidate.
 &HT;    To combat the relentlessly negative reviews of his campaign,
Gore has been forced to make the quality of his campaigning central
to his candidacy, to ballyhoo the move of his headquarters to
Nashville, for example, while Bradley kept on talking about health
care or child poverty and his advisers remained silently behind
their curtains.
 &HT;    This has repeatedly returned Gore to the same shaky ground _ his
political ability _ while lending heft to a related doubt about
him: that he is a programmable man guided more by tactics than
beliefs. Gore's problem, in short, has been less alpha or beta than
meta.
 &HT;    It's a peculiar problem, for what Gore has been learning this
past year is how to be a politician _ which is, of course, the job
description of a candidate. Unfortunately for Gore, however, it is
a dirty word. But what is so wicked about a politician politicking?
This year, candidates and reporters are condemning politics and
praising ``authenticity.''
 &HT;    Antipolitics has been with us for some time now. Authenticity is
this campaign's variant, a kind of characterological shorthand for
everything politics allegedly is not _ honest, deep, real. But
those who tout authenticity are making an almost useless
distinction, at least as far as campaigning goes.
 &HT;    If authenticity is what the people want (and, help me here, when
was it that they clamored for fakery?), then it is a political act
to give it to them. Was it ``authentic'' for Bradley as a senator
to study Elvis Presley movies in hopes of honing his communication
skills? He was looking to change himself to appeal to people, the
essence of inauthenticity.
 &HT;    On the other hand, he was hoping to appeal to people in order to
lead them, the essence of good politics.
 &HT;    The phony divide between authenticity and politicking was
captured by the tumult earlier this month over John McCain's
letters pressuring the FCC to speed up a decision important to a
donor. Captain Campaign Reform suddenly looked like just another
politician.
 &HT;    Yes, by all means take the excessive money out of politics; but
don't take the politics out, to paraphrase Clinton. In policing the
bureaucracy on behalf of his constituents, including donors, McCain
was being who he is, an authentic politician. Put another way, he
was doing his job.
 &HT;    Gore's chief problem is that deep down he suspects it is
dishonorable to be a politician, and this can make him a bad one.
He reminds me a bit of some second-generation auto dealers, the
expensively educated sons of self-made men who balk at the tactics
of the family business they know so intimately.
 &HT;    ``He doesn't really like politics,'' one of Gore's closest aides
told me. ``He holds it in disdain.'' But he is gradually coming to
terms with his outer politician.
 &HT;    As with the move to Nashville, campaign gestures that were
entirely political _ gestures that Gore feared would be derided as
entirely political _ have had political effects that have reminded
him what is so great about politics: It connects candidates with
voters.
 &HT;    This was illustrated by his challenge to Bradley that they
forego political advertising and hold plenty of debates instead.
Pundits immediately dismissed the proposal as a political gimmick.
They were right that it was a gimmick. They were wrong to dismiss
it.
 &HT;    Gore was led, by political considerations, to suggest a reform
that would have elevated the discussion and released some of the
money pressure. His offer left Bradley in the position of defending
30-second commercials as a more effective means of communication.
Which is the more cynical _ or if you prefer, ``political'' _
position? Who cares?
 &HT;    As a politician, Gore is making progress. Man, message and
political machine mesh more smoothly now than four months ago. The
changes in each did not come at once, but they occurred over
roughly the same time _ just before and after Gore shifted his
headquarters to Nashville in October _ and they reinforced one
another.
 &HT;    A new team of loyal advisers, his own competitive nature and a
rediscovery of his competence at face-to-face politicking have
probably given him enough confidence and focus to win the
Democratic nomination, barring any egregious blunders.
 &HT;    Before small groups this fall and winter, Gore has displayed a
mastery of intricate matters, a knack for explaining them and an
agile sense of humor. He has also become a better debater, finally
swallowing his aggravation with Clinton and expressing some pride
in the work they did together _ managing to take credit for Clinton
administration policies without embracing, or trashing, Clinton the
man.
 &HT;    Gore has been relearning what it is to seek votes for himself,
and in this quest he has been aided not by soul-searching but by
pros who never lose sleep about whether some tactic is too
political.
 &HT;    Notwithstanding the enthusiasm of some longtime Tennessee
volunteers and young staff members, though, I found little burning
passion for Gore among his advisers. He is too familiar and too
lacking in charisma, and too many of his aides have seen too many
candidates.
 &HT;    They say that he is no natural politician, for all his
confidence in his own political acumen. But this is not to say his
aides are not dedicated to electing him. While they may not marvel
at his magnetism or vision, his advisers talk with deep respect of
his decency, policy judgment and commitment to public service. If
this is not the Clinton crusade of 1992, it is also not the Clinton
advertising firm of 1996.
 &HT;    The move to Nashville, which could have been a disaster, has
produced a leaner, more spirited team. Junior staff members go out
for beers with one another at night, rather than with college pals
in Washington.
 &HT;    Without other familiar distractions, they come into the office
on weekends and go to work. This group will build up a lot more
passion if the race becomes a contest between Gore and Bush, rather
than two centrist Democrats whose dislike for each other has
concealed how little difference there is between them politically.
 &HT;    It has been widely reported that Karenna Gore Schiff, his
daughter, and Naomi Wolf, the writer and Gore consultant, had urged
the vice president to distance himself from the president. This is
true. But it understates the sway that this theory already held,
and holds, among his staff members. It is campaign orthodoxy. This
has led the campaign to play down Gore's impressive work in the
Clinton administration in favor of his prior work.
 &HT;    ``It's not what matters so much in this election,'' Karenna Gore
Schiff said of the last seven years. ``What matters is who the
candidates are and what they're going to do, and my dad's
experience goes pretty far back. It goes back to 1976, not 1992.''
 &HT;    Personally, Gore remains resentful of Clinton and angry at him
for enmeshing him in his scandals, his associates say. But his
efforts to distance himself are driven more by a political
calculation that voters still see him as Clinton's yes man, rather
than as a leader _ in fact, a ``fighter'' _ in his own right, and
theirs.
 &HT;    Gore and Clinton still talk by telephone two or three times a
week. But when I asked Gore if he had ever consulted Clinton about
the campaign, he immediately said no. ``He's a skilled
politician,'' Gore said, ``and from time to time in our
conversations he will offer some advice.''
 &HT;    There are two possibilities here: Either Gore is fibbing, in
which case he still feels obliged to exaggerate his personal
distance from Clinton, or in fact the gap is quite significant, and
despite the galaxy of advisers he has consulted, he chooses to
overlook the Democrat who knows best how to run both as a
challenger and as an incumbent.
 &HT;    For his part, Clinton misses Gore's advice, presidential aides
say. Clinton trusted Gore to tell the truth and Gore was able to
use sarcasm to puncture Clinton's self-pitying or bombastic moods.
 &HT;    But Gore's advisers believe that the vice president had to
separate himself from Clinton because he is, in the campaign's
formulation, ``famous but unknown.''
 &HT;    The campaign found, for example, that most voters did not know
that Gore had ever been anything but a politician. They had to
sharpen Gore's biography and weave it into his standard stump
speech. They zeroed in on dramatic points in Gore's own life and
also the lives of his parents.
 &HT;    Gore had spoken about all these matters, intermittently and
sometimes movingly, for years. Now he was meshing them in a tight
triad of parables that would give a narrative edge to his standard
stump speech and to the populist theme that would define Gore's
career: that he was a fighter against special interests, as one
senior Gore strategist put it, ``representing the people against
THEM.''
 &HT;    Television audiences have not been thoroughly impressed,
however, and this may be one of the reasons why he continues to lag
as many as 10 points behind George W. Bush nationally. Somehow, for
all his credentials and experience, Gore comes off seeming like
less than the sum of his parts.
 &HT;    In debate, the vice president has been reluctant to take risks.
When he has, the result has been damaging, as when he foolishly
declared that in appointing Joint Chiefs of Staff he would make
support for gays in the military a litmus test. That comment
yielded yet another ``hastily assembled press conference,'' as
reporters invariably call them, which is something of a Gore
signature.
 &HT;    Often, Gore seems to be trying too hard. Discussing affirmative
action in a town-hall-style debate in Manchester in mid-December,
Gore made a telling point, observing that the host had evidently
failed to invite many blacks.
 &HT;    But then he went too far: ``Are there any?'' he asked, looking
around and starting to point. ``There's one _ one in _ in back
there.''
 &HT;    Though he has grown more comfortable with each debate, Gore
still tends to fall back on catapulting jagged speech chunks
through the air. His performances recall his 1996 debate with Jack
Kemp, when in his answers he repeatedly chanted a mantra
(``Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment'') as though
the television audience were being sleep-taught.
 &HT;    After that debate, my grandmother, a believer in Clinton and
Gore, left a pained message on my answering machine: ``Does he
think I am stupid?''
 &HT;    This year, ``I want to fight for you'' is proving to be the
patronizing mantra.
 &HT;    Gore knows better. ``These techniques inevitably encourage
inauthenticity in a politician's message,'' he wrote of the dangers
of sound bites, polling and ``personality skills'' in his 1992 best
seller, ``Earth in the Balance.'' ``Why present genuine ideas and
true character if artificial ones are more effective in the
marketplace of power.''
 &HT;    When I read some of Gore's words back to him, he told me that he
was no longer so concerned about political manipulation, because
the audience has grown as sophisticated as the candidates and their
consultants.
 &HT;    ``And what has resulted is that only one thing really works, and
that is what's real,'' he said. ``There may be people who are
skilled enough and smart enough to use these personality tools to
shape their image and affect and appear to be something they're
not. I'm not one of them.''
 &HT;    Exactly so. But what is real still needs politics to be
expressed.
 &HT;    Gore's attempts to reach TV audiences often reek of the
greasepaint he rightly scorns. As he picks at Bradley, he looks
political, and that may hurt his chances with the independents and
moderates who, paradoxically, are the very people who are most
likely to share his disdain for politics.
 &HT;    They might be more impressed if he showed the side of himself
that privately deflects operatives' suggestions with the arch
question, ``Isn't that awfully political?''
 &HT;    Bradley so far has bested Gore largely on style points. His ease
in public, his seeming candor and his apparent disregard for
old-school maneuvering have managed to make Gore seem
simultaneously clumsy and slick. Gore may lack a common touch or
patrician grace, yet he has learned, in meeting with voters away
from the television cameras, that he can make a style of substance.
 &HT;    In that setting, he communicates without contempt for the
process or the people who take it seriously, as they should. He has
to learn to take that skill on the air. He will need it in the
downtime between the primaries and the Democratic convention,
should he get that far. He will need it in the general election;
and he will need it to govern.
 &HT;    Before Gore can hope to seem like less of a politician, he will
have to become more of one.

   NEW YORK _ Twice as many women as men say spouses are their most
important political influence, according to a survey of more than
3,000 women by Women.com Networks, Inc. and Good Housekeeping
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The November 1999 survey conducted online and via telephone
assessed the political behavior and beliefs of American women. The
survey was conducted by pollster Harris Interactive.
</P>
<P>
   Among the findings:
</P>
<P>
   _ Husbands and wives have very different political influences.
When asked their primary political influences, the single largest
group of women point to their mates, followed by their parents (Mom
first).
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, men are most influenced by their fathers _ only
half as many men look to their mates for political opinions.
</P>
<P>
   _ Nearly one-third of women are undecided in the race for
president.
</P>
<P>
   _ George W. Bush leads with 30 percent of women in general,
thanks to his core support from all women 30-64 and Hispanic women
overall. Vice President Al Gore was the only other candidate with
double-digit support from women (18 percent).
</P>
<P>
   _ Online women gave the least credence to political party when
asked the importance of party, issues, and candidate impression.
Only 28 percent of online women _ compared to 42 percent in general
_ said political party was very important or important.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 94 percent said issues are very important when
considering whether to vote for a particular candidate, followed by
candidate impression (82 percent) and political party (42 percent).
</P>
<P>
   _ Online women aligned with women in the general public in
identifying the top five issues of greatest importance in this
election year: health care, children/families, education, Social
Security, and the economy.
</P>
<P>
   _ The majority of women do not want to know what goes on in a
president's private life _ particularly young women and African
American women. However, baby boomers and Republicans are more
inclined to want to know.
</P>
<P>
   The study was conducted in conjunction with Majority 2000, a
joint-initiative between Women.com and Good Housekeeping to track
the political views and trends of women during the 2000
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   The survey covered 3,223 women and 3,439 men using traditional
telephone methods and the Internet. The survey of online women was
administered on the Internet only, and the telephone survey
included a percentage of men and women who also use the Internet on
a regular basis.
</P>
<P>
   Women.com (www.women.com) is a leading Internet network
dedicated to women. Good Housekeeping, founded 114 years ago, is

 By DINITIA SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Vanessa Cole writes poetry with her toe. She cannot
move her arms or legs. She cannot talk, nod, smell or taste, though
she has a brilliant smile that compels a response, for Ms. Cole's
entire expressive nature is tied up in her smile. And then there is
her poetry, which she writes by pointing her toe at letters on a
plastic sheet that someone holds in front of her foot.
</P>
<P>
   For nine years Ms. Cole, who is paralyzed from a stroke, has
been a patient at the Coler-Goldwater Memorial Hospital, a
municipal hospital for the severely disabled on Roosevelt Island.
And for six of those years she has been in a class taught by
students in New York University's graduate creative writing
program. The class was begun in 1984 by the poet Sharon Olds with
financing from Very Special Arts, a foundation created by Jean
Kennedy Smith to provide arts education for people with
disabilities. The class has 12 patients and a long waiting list.
After a winter break, it starts up again on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   At Goldwater patients write about the worlds they have lost,
about the experience of being prisoners in their own bodies. Ms.
Cole wrote in one poem:
</P>
<P>
   I can't remember hunger.
</P>
<P>
   Hunger is a state of mind,
</P>
<P>
   not a valid feeling.
</P>
<P>
   I only get headaches.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes her work has the tough cadence and purity of Emily
Dickinson's poetry. Long before she arrived at Goldwater, Ms. Cole,
who comes from the Caribbean island of St. Vincent, was reading
Dickinson. She keeps a volume of her poetry beside her bed and
occasionally one of the students reads to her from it.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cole wrote last year:
</P>
<P>
   Tears from heaven
</P>
<P>
   How many more
</P>
<P>
   on puffs of satin
</P>
<P>
   in a veil of controversy
</P>
<P>
   heaped in a pool
</P>
<P>
   by the lake of no return.
</P>
<P>
   The students had been asked to write about rain without using
the word. And so Ms. Cole, who was a nurse before she had the first
of two strokes in 1990, painstakingly pointed to the letters with
her toe, sometimes grunting with the effort, while her student
teacher, Jennifer Keller, wrote the words on paper.
</P>
<P>
   Like Ms. Cole, Tamika Walker, 26, another student in the class,
is almost completely paralyzed from an auto accident when she was 2
years old. She has been at Goldwater since she was 3. Ms. Walker
breathes with a tube in her throat and controls her wheelchair with
a device she operates with her mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Her poems, like many of the patients' work, are filled with
images of freedom, of animals prowling, of birds flying. In one,
``My New Tree,'' she wrote, ``I sometimes dream about being a
bird/when I dream about that I wonder how I can fly.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the patients' poetry is unformed, some of the prose only
bits and pieces of imagery. But ``every man could speak, if he hath
loved and been well nourished in the mother tongue,'' Ms. Olds
wrote, quoting Keats, when she described the Goldwater program. Ms.
Keller has had some of Ms. Cole's poems accepted for publication in
an NYU literary journal, ``Evolution/Revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   At Goldwater, the graduate students get a writing lesson like no
other. This is a place where language is laid bare, where each word
is chosen with excruciating effort, so hard to come by that it must
carry a great weight. There are no fancy literary tropes at
Goldwater, no confusion of critical discourse. The students'
writing is a reminder that story and language, pure and simple, are
the foundations of literature. ``Any teacher of writing will talk
about how much they learn about the craft themselves by teaching
it,'' said Melissa Hammerle, the coordinator of the NYU creative
writing program, which gives the student teachers a $500 stipend
each semester. The university also has writing programs at the
Metropolitan Correctional Center, a federal prison, in hospitals
and in New York City public schools. The classes are paid for by
individual donors and the Park, Starlight, Tomorrow and New York
Times Co. foundations.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Goldwater, the students are up against such naked and
terrible necessity,'' Ms. Olds said. ``They are up against the
craft of how to bear the human.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Keller, 29, who is studying poetry at NYU, said: ``When it
is more difficult to speak or pick a word, the stakes go up
exponentially. There is a kind of fidelity to language that comes
from how difficult it is to be heard.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cole ``will fight for the words she wants,'' Ms. Keller,
said, ``even when it takes that much blood and sweat to write a
single word. She's a writer. We will fuss over every line break and
every punctuation mark until she's satisfied with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite her incapacity, Ms. Cole has a dry sense of humor. ``I
can babble with the best of them,'' she spelled out one day last
semester on her letter chart when a reporter sat down next to her
to talk. How old is she, she was asked? ``N-o t-e-l-l,'' Ms. Cole
spelled, then laughed.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   One day, Jason Schneiderman, 23, a student teacher, announced
that the topic for the class would be ``transformation.'' To give
the students an idea of what he meant, he read from Ted Hughes'
translation of Ovid's ``Arachne,'' about a girl who is changed into
a spider by the jealous goddess Minerva. Schneiderman read:
</P>
<P>
   And now she is all belly
</P>
<P>
   With a dot of head
</P>
<P>
   She retains
</P>
<P>
   Only her slender skillful fingers
</P>
<P>
   For legs. And for ever
</P>
<P>
   She hangs from the thread that she spins
</P>
<P>
   Out of her belly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Okay, so let's write,'' Schneiderman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I d - o - n - t, '' Ms. Cole began to spell out the letters on
her chart. ``I don't like the choice of poems,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Keller, sitting beside her, urged her on. ``If you were
going to change into something else, what would it be?'' she asked
Ms. Cole. ``For example, a stubborn, difficult, hard-headed
woman?'' she teased. Ms. Cole smiled. Ms. Keller kept encouraging
her. If she could change into something else, what would it be? ``A
half-decent me,'' Ms. Cole said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My former self,'' she continued, spelling out the words. ``I
will be proud of what I will achieve/ Save, as well as bring, new
life into a healthy world.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Keller said: ``This is a really good idea. You're not going
to quit just because it's hard.'' It would serve as a first draft,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Across the room from Ms. Cole sat Joseph Wright, 45, who has
been at Goldwater 12 years and in the writing program about five
years. Wright is tall and athletic looking and speaks in a low
voice that is difficult to understand. Most of the time he is
silent. He said he used to play basketball at City College of New
York with the rapper Keith Sweat. Wright said he was not quite sure
what causes the partial paralysis that robs him of the ability to
walk and control his limbs. He was a security guard, Wright said,
and ``I was walking along 42nd Street, and I woke up in Bellevue. I
tried to get up and walk, and I couldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright's work is filled with allusions to being homeless: ``I
stayed in a 42nd-Street movie theater for about two weeks, day in
and day out. People staying there with me washed in the bathroom
and ate in the movie viewing area.''
</P>
<P>
   He also writes about the life of a crack addict: ``The part I
couldn't understand was that I spent so much and it didn't do
nothing, just that thirst. Stay out at all hours of the night,
roaming around with people searching for money to get the crack.''
</P>
<P>
   Working with Wright reminds his teacher, Reena Shah, 23, of the
importance of the story. Ms. Shah, who is writing a novel, said
sometimes in her classes at NYU she felt overwhelmed by critical
jargon about structure and imagery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of times you get away from the basics, the reason that
you write, when you're in a typical graduate student workshop,''
she said. ``The importance of telling a story, how crucial it is,
is something I've learned at Goldwater.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, in the workshop on transformation, Wright dictated in a low
voice to Ms. Shah about what he would like to be. ``If I woke up
here as a bird, I'd fly out of here,'' he said. ``As a wolf, I'd
attack somebody. There's a couple of people I would attack without
giving it much thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end he wrote: ``I'm tired of captivity. I'd get
chained up and put in a zoo or something. If I make it I'd just
roam free, though not exactly. I'd have to dodge all the time. I'd
be considered dangerous. I'd have to find someplace away from
people. I'd be such a threat. They'd probably be told to shoot me
at sight.''
</P>
<P>
   Every year the workshop culminates in a party and a group
reading on the last day of the semester. The students' work is
printed in a pamphlet. This time there was coffee, cake, fruit and
crackers. The students sat in a circle, reading their work or
listening as one of their teachers read it.
</P>
<P>
   Gesille James, the supervising activity therapist in the
recreation services department, began by reading an inspirational
quotation from Eleanor Roosevelt: ``You gain strength, courage and
confidence by every experience in which you really stop and look
fear in the face. You are able to say to yourself: `I lived through
this horror. I can take the next thing that comes along.'''
</P>
<P>
   One of the teachers, Lara Payne, read a poem by her student
James Rascoe, who had written about her. Rascoe, 35 and blind from
glaucoma, has been in the program for nearly three years, since he
arrived at Goldwater. His fiancee, another patient at the hospital,
Ruth Taylor Jones, in a wheelchair, was at the party.
</P>
<P>
   A wiry, ebullient figure with dark glasses, he smiled as Ms.
Payne read his poem, called ``Very Well.''
</P>
<P>
   Lara asked me how I was doing. I answered that I was fine.
</P>
<P>
   I asked her how she was doing, and she said, `Very Well,'
</P>
<P>
   with a big smile, a grin, and all 32 gleaming teeth. I'm blind,
</P>
<P>
   but her gleaming teeth would blind me again.

 &HT;    Kia selects Georgia county for distribution facility
 &HT;    By Tony Wilbert
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Kia Motors America's need for new space is good news
for one Metro Atlanta county but bad news for another.
</P>
<P>
   Kia has signed a 10-year lease for space at Newpoint
Distribution Center at I-85 and Ga. 120 in Gwinnett.
</P>
<P>
   Kia currently operates a much smaller distribution facility at
Riverside Business Park in Cobb and will move to Gwinnett in June.
</P>
<P>
   The Irvine, Calif., automobile company needs more space as it
comes off a record sales year and prepares to launch three new
models this year, spokeswoman Teppy Whigington said. ``(Kia) just
needed some extra space (in Atlanta),'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kia has 50 workers in its Cobb facility and expects to add to
its work force after the move. The company expects to retain some
workers in Cobb at a new sales office.
</P>
<P>
   The American marketing arm of Kia Motor Corp. of Seoul, South
Korea, Kia Motors America sells Sephia cars and Sportage
sport-utility vehicles. It has several dealerships in metro
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   At Newpoint Distribution Center, situated in the triangle
created by I-85, Ga. 120 and Ga. 316, Kia signed a 10-year lease.
It initially will occupy 317,000 square feet in the
451,000-square-foot facility and is expected eventually to lease
the entire building.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta office of Panattoni Development Co. started
construction on the building after Kia signed the lease, said Mike
Demperio, a Panattoni principal.
</P>
<P>
   Kia's five-year lease of a 90,000-square-foot facility in
Riverside along I-20 expires in October, said Scott Raeber, project
manager for Crescent Resources. The North Carolina development arm
of Duke Energy bought the 331 acres of undeveloped land at
Riverside this month.
</P>
<P>
   Kia chose Newpoint because Panattoni had a site ready for the
quick construction of a distribution center, said Mark Kercher, a
Julien J. Studley Inc. broker who represented the car company with
his brother, Ed Kercher. ``We looked under every rock in and above
and below metro Atlanta,'' he said. ``We had to find a pad-ready
site.''

 &HT;    BellSouth forges pact with ISS
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ BellSouth Corp. on Monday announced a partnership to
sell computer security solutions with Atlanta-based Internet
Security Systems and, in a separate deal, bought part a small New
York consulting company.
</P>
<P>
   Although the $3 million investment in the consulting company,
Predictive Systems, gives BellSouth less than 10 percent ownership,
it amounts to a stake in an ambitious company in an important
sector. Predictive Systems offers help to companies with the design
and management of computer networks. The ISS deal lets BellSouth
offer more services to its huge list of customers, said Donna Lee,
BellSouth president for marketing, in an interview last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do view this as a dramatic change but it's in context of
how BellSouth is doing things. This is a directional step,
registering our intent to be a player. There is a $2 billion-plus
market in which we are not participating.''
</P>
<P>
   The target for these services are small- and medium-sized
businesses, Lee said. ``Customers who are big enough to have an
intensity of need but small enough so they don't want to fund this
technical expertise.''
</P>
<P>
   More moves _ including investments _ are likely in the
near-future, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ISS, founded in 1994 by Chris Klaus in his Georgia Tech dorm,
burst from obscurity to become a source of protection for
high-stakes networks like those of the Pentagon, multi-national
banks and other major corporations. ISS is expanding its strategy,
partnering with large telecom companies like BellSouth to deliver
security to thousands of business customers, said Thomas Noonan,
ISS president and chief executive. ``We want to be the man behind
the curtain. This is very consistent with our strategy as we focus
on delivering security, not just as a technology but as a
service.''
</P>
<P>
   Together with ISS, BellSouth will offer a host of products,
including ``firewalls'' meant to keep unwanted electronic visitors
away from a company's networks, as well as software that will
detect intruders and respond to them. The offerings are aimed at
what both companies believe is a large and growing market. For
instance, an Ernst &AMP; Young survey that showed more than half U.S.
businesses do not monitor online activites and have no planned
response to security problems.
</P>
<P>
   The Predictive Systems stake is interesting because Bellsouth
has been cautious about taking an ownership stake in other firms,
so even a small stake looms large as a signal. There has been no
similar investment since the $3.5 billion deal that gave BellSouth
a 10 percent piece of Qwest Communications last April.
</P>
<P>
   Predictive represents a piece of a network consulting market
that is expected to reach $6 billion by 2003, according to analysts
at International Data Corp.
</P>
<P>
   With Predictive Systems, small and privately-held, BellSouth can
get ``the most bang for its buck'' with an equity investment, Lee
said. By contrast, ISS has a market capitalization of about $2.7
billion. ISS closed Monday at $66 a share. A partnership made more
sense than plunking down a pile of money, Lee said. ``With every
partner you decide what's best.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcements were made at the ComNet trade show in
Washington, D.C.

 &HT;    Harvard offers best payback on MBA
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   An MBA isn't what it used to be, given that working for an
Internet startup instead of going back to business school can be a
lucrative option.
</P>
<P>
   So which schools offer the best payback for the time and money
that has to be spent to earn an MBA?
</P>
<P>
   No surprise, according to Forbes (Feb. 7). It's Harvard at the
top, based on the net gain in income by 1994 MBA graduates. Emory's
Goizueta Business School ranks 24th in payback, according to
Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia State and the University of Georgia show up as Nos. 10
and 11, respectively, on a second list of what Forbes refers to as
``mostly regional business schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Also in Forbes: Investors worried about Lucent Technologies'
recent missteps in anticipating the demand for the latest fiber
optics switch need not fear, the magazine suggests. ``Lucent is
well poised to help lead an optical revolution that will whip
information around the globe at a fraction of today's cost,''
Forbes offers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Finding the pearls can make the world your oyster
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot of beaten down stocks out there. But only a
handful of them are pearls, according to Kiplinger's Personal
Finance (February). The magazine identifies eight stocks it
considers ``exceptional businesses selling at bargain-basement (or
at least relatively inexpensive) prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Also in Kiplinger's: An interview with Robert Stansky, manager
of Fidelity's Magellan fund.
</P>
<P>
   _And then there are the hot stocks _ technology stocks
</P>
<P>
   Bloomberg Personal Finance (January/February) looks at 100
stocks that were hot last year _ think technology _ and estimates
long-term growth rates for them. The magazine also adds a caveat
for those who might drool over last year's returns: ``While high
expectations are seductive, they can also be a curse _ and
dangerous for investors to chance.
</P>
<P>
   _Issue of money offers the `ultimate' fund guide
</P>
<P>
   Money (February) makes no bones about its offering: the issue is
labeled as ``The ultimate mutual fund guide.'' Inside are
performance rankings on more than 2,100 funds, lists of top
performers over various time periods, and thumbnail profiles of who
the magazine considers are the best fund managers of the 1990s.

   _Made in the U.S.A. version of prosperity tries to go abroad in
Business Week
</P>
<P>
   Can the New World export the ``new economy''? Yes, says Business
Week (Jan. 31), but not overnight. The magazine looks at what it
takes to create a technology driven, low inflation economy, and how
some parts of the world are starting to adopt the U.S. model.

   NEW YORK _ Twice as many women as men say spouses are their most
important political influence, according to a survey of more than
3,000 women by Women.com Networks, Inc. and Good Housekeeping
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The November 1999 survey conducted online and via telephone
assessed the political behavior and beliefs of American women. The
survey was conducted by pollster Harris Interactive.
</P>
<P>
   Among the findings:
</P>
<P>
   _ Husbands and wives have very different political influences.
When asked their primary political influences, the single largest
group of women point to their mates, followed by their parents (Mom
first).
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, men are most influenced by their fathers _ only
half as many men look to their mates for political opinions.
</P>
<P>
   _ Nearly one-third of women are undecided in the race for
president.
</P>
<P>
   _ George W. Bush leads with 30 percent of women in general,
thanks to his core support from all women 30-64 and Hispanic women
overall. Vice President Al Gore was the only other candidate with
double-digit support from women (18 percent).
</P>
<P>
   _ Online women gave the least credence to political party when
asked the importance of party, issues, and candidate impression.
Only 28 percent of online women _ compared to 42 percent in general
_ said political party was very important or important.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 94 percent said issues are very important when
considering whether to vote for a particular candidate, followed by
candidate impression (82 percent) and political party (42 percent).
</P>
<P>
   _ Online women aligned with women in the general public in
identifying the top five issues of greatest importance in this
election year: health care, children/families, education, Social
Security, and the economy.
</P>
<P>
   _ The majority of women do not want to know what goes on in a
president's private life _ particularly young women and African
American women. However, baby boomers and Republicans are more
inclined to want to know.
</P>
<P>
   The study was conducted in conjunction with Majority 2000, a
joint-initiative between Women.com and Good Housekeeping to track
the political views and trends of women during the 2000
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   The survey covered 3,223 women and 3,439 men using traditional
telephone methods and the Internet. The survey of online women was
administered on the Internet only, and the telephone survey
included a percentage of men and women who also use the Internet on
a regular basis.
</P>
<P>
   Women.com (www.women.com) is a leading Internet network
dedicated to women. Good Housekeeping, founded 114 years ago, is
published by Hearst Magazines, a unit of Hearst Communications,
Inc., the world's largest publisher of monthly magazines, with 16
U.S. titles and 98 international editions distributed in more than
100 countries.

TOBACCO (Phoenix) - Arizona lawmakers congratulated themselves last
week when they approved a new state mental hospital. Now comes the
tough part - deciding what to do with the rest of the $3.1 billion
tobacco settlement. With two initiatives headed for the ballot that
would nullify anything the Legislature does, there is increasing
talk at the Capitol that lawmakers need to put their own plan
before voters. But deciding what should be in that package, along
with debating growth controls and taxes for a new football stadium
for the Arizona Cardinals, will be one of the biggest fights of the
session.

MONTINI-COLUMN (Phoenix) - In order for an unknown politician named
John McCain to get into Congress in 1982, he needed the support of
the blustery publisher of The Arizona Republic and Phoenix Gazette,
Darrow ``Duke'' Tully. They hit it off immediately. Tully bragged
of his military exploits and the two men became so close Tully was
named godfather of McCain's dauthter. Then Tully's military past
was exposed as a fraud. He was vilified and went into exile,
abandoned by his friends. Except for one: McCain. By E.J. MONTINI.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Watch the sodas and do not eat the chicken skin, but if you feel
like having a glass of wine, or two, help yourself.
</P>
<P>
   If the latest revisions to federal dietary guidelines are
included in the final version later this month, that advice would
be part of the government's basic message.
</P>
<P>
   The working version, still subject to rewriting, differs in
several ways from the advice that the government offered in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The most striking difference is that three of the first four
guidelines have nothing to do with food choices but instead deal
with food safety, exercise and weight, all noncontroversial topics.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this has done,'' said Dr. Marion Nestle, chairwoman of
the Department of Nutrition and Food Studies at New York University
and a member of the 1995 advisory committee on dietary guidelines,
``is shift the focus of the guidelines from food to other factors.
The de-emphasis on food and increased emphasis on other factors is
not a step forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Nestle said there were some admirable changes in the 10
single-sentence guidelines and some that were just continuations of
the government's unwillingness to be more precise about how
Americans could improve their health through the food they eat.
</P>
<P>
   The Dietary Guidelines for Americans, updated every five years
by a joint advisory committee of the Agriculture Department and the
Department of Health and Human Services, are used by the federal
government to plan food programs and by private industry to
dispense nutrition information.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the usual wrangling over the guidelines' wording,
this year both the advisory panel and the report face a court
challenge. A health advocacy group in Washington, the Physicians
Committee for Responsible Medicine, wants to prevent the release of
the final report, because, it says, at least 6 of the 11 members of
the advisory panel have or have had financial ties to the meat,
dairy or egg industries.
</P>
<P>
   A suit, filed in December, also also says the guidelines do not
meet the health needs of members of minorities that are
lactose-intolerant and that the recommendations should make dairy
products an optional source for calcium.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday a federal district judge in Washington will decide
whether to issue a preliminary injunction against the release of
the final guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Other protests, by the food industry, follow a familiar pattern
_ efforts to soften the wording of the guidelines. The
recommendation about sugar in the diet is likely to bring strong
protests from the soft drink industry because the guidelines urge
people to ``go easy on beverages and foods high in added sugar.''
</P>
<P>
   By including the word ``added'' for the first time, the
committee said it was acknowledging the substantial amount of
research that ``nondiet soft drinks displace beverages or foods
that are richer in essential nutrients, such as milk and fruit
juices, in the diets of American children.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Soft Drink Association has its own research to
suggest that soft drinks are not replacing milk.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no scientific evidence to support any changes in
dietary guidelines on added sugar,'' said Sean McBride, a spokesman
for the National Soft Drink Association.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendation on fats has also been changed. The previous
guidelines called for a diet low in total fat, saturated fat and
cholesterol. The new guidelines would recommend a diet low in
saturated fat and cholesterol but moderate in total fat. The
maximum fat intake would remain the same at 30 percent of total
calories, or 65 grams a day in a 2,000-calorie diet, appropriate
for men but high for most women.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Nestle finds the recommendation reasonable, but asked, ``Why
not call a hamburger a hamburger or a steak a steak?''
</P>
<P>
   Using the words saturated fat and cholesterol are just
``euphemisms for saying eat less meat and processed food,'' Dr.
Nestle said. Not since 1979 has the government told Americans to
``eat less meat.'' The meat industry objected to that wording so
strongly that it was never included again.
</P>
<P>
   The advisory panel's vice chairwoman, Dr. Suzanne Murphy, a
research nutritionist, said: ``The intent of the report is not to
say what foods are good and what foods are bad. We didn't give
people a list of good meats and bad meats.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead the guidelines tell people to trim external fat and
remove the skin from the chicken. She said the 1995 guidelines
listed sausages, salami and organ meats as fatty meats, but steaks
and hamburgers have still not made the list.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a misperception that people are eating too much
beef,'' said Mary Young, executive director of nutrition programs
for the National Cattlemen's Beef Association. ``We do believe
Americans should eat more fruits, vegetables and grain but not at
expense of lean meat or lean dairy products.''
</P>
<P>
   Substantially changed from 1990 to 1995 from a prohibitionist
tone to an acknowledgment that consuming some alcohol may be
healthful, the guideline for alcohol has been further tweaked to
specify those who might benefit.
</P>
<P>
   In the working version, it reads: drinking in moderation may
lower the risk of coronary heart disease, mainly among men over the
age of 45 and women over the age of 55.
</P>
<P>
   Moderate consumption provides little if any health benefits for
young people. In addition, the section on the relationship between
alcohol and cancer has been changed to specifically include breast
cancer. A recent analysis shows an increased risk of breast cancer
with alcohol consumption.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, Dr. Nestle said: ``Some of the changes are for the
better; some are not, because the Department of Agriculture has two
roles: to promote the consumption of all American agriculture,
regardless of nutritional value, and promulgate dietary guidelines.
If the guidelines should suggest eating less of something the
department is in conflict.''

&HT;     BRONX SHOOTING DIVIDES A NEIGHBORHOOD ONCE RIVEN BY CRIME 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Some residents of the Bronx neighborhood in which
Amadou Diallo died in a hail of police bullets say the shooting
would not have happened if beat police _ rather than the four
members of the city's elite Street Crime Unit _ had been the ones
who encountered the 22-year-old man.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo, who lived and died in the Soundview area of the Bronx,
was hit by 19 bullets early in the morning of Feb. 4, 1999, in the
vestibule of the two-story apartment building in which he lived.
</P>
<P>
   The officers who shot Diallo _ Kenneth Boss, 28, Sean Carroll,
36, Edward McMellon, 27, and Richard Murphy, 27 _ said they
believed he was armed and dangerous. Police reports after the
shooting said no weapon was found and that Diallo had no criminal
record. The four plainclothes officers from the Street Crime Unit
reportedly were looking for a serial rapist.
</P>
<P>
   The officers have said through their lawyers that Diallo, a
West-African immigrant, was behaving suspiciously and that the
shooting was justified.
</P>
<P>
   Some storekeepers and neighborhood residents said they don't
agree.
</P>
<P>
   A man who said he lives in the apartment building where Diallo
resided, at 1157 Wheeler Ave., was putting out his trash the
morning of Jan. 17. When asked by a reporter if he had seen or
heard the shooting, he said: ``I just heard the noise.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the killing, he said ``It's not right.'' The man, who said he
had been interviewed by the police about the shooting, declined to
give his name.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an outside unit of police,'' said Phyllis Clarke, owner
of a nearby bakery. ``I don't think it would have happened if it
was the local police; they know the neighborhood.''

corner of Wheeler Avenue, agreed. She said shootings were not
normal for the police out of the 43rd Precinct, the local station.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was something new,'' said the 45-year-old shopkeeper.
``I've never seen that here. The cops don't harass people, not
around here.''
</P>
<P>
   Police officials challenge the assertion that the four officers
were to blame for the shooting. They said that undercover officers,
whose mission is to clean up street crime in progress, are crucial
to fighting crime and often are required to react to dangerous
situations in a split second. They also cite statistics showing a
sharp drop in crime on New York City streets to justify the
tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo lived at 1157 Wheeler Ave., a red-brick building on a
quiet, windswept street in the Soundview section of the Bronx.
Around the corner from his former home is a busy thoroughfare,
Westchester Avenue. With an elevated subway track there, Diallo had
a direct route to East 14th Street in Manhattan, were he sold
videos and other street wares.
</P>
<P>
   The vestibule of his home, where he was struck by 19 of 41
bullets fired at him, is about 5 feet by 7 feet. Five concrete
steps lead up from the sidewalk. Written on the walls in indelible
black ink in the entryway are a dozen or so inscriptions to Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   They say: ``Please persecute the murderers'' and ``Rest in peace
Amadou.''
</P>
<P>
   Another says, ``May Allah bless you. You have my condolences
family of Amadou Diallo. It was called for Lord Mustapha Allah,
Allah `U' Akbar will take care of it.'' Diallo, who emigrated from
Guinea, was a devout Muslim.
</P>
<P>
   Still another inscription says, ``It isn't good to stay in a
white racist country too long. It's costing us our sons. ... It's
costing us our future.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a year after the shooting, the vestibule of the building
remains pockmarked by bullet holes. Also written in indelible black
ink are police investigator markings logging the number and
location of the holes.
</P>
<P>
   Running up the edge of the outside door of the building, between
the middle and lower door hinges, are four bullet holes. They are
marked ``BH1,'' ``BH2,'' ``BH3'' and ``BH4.'' There are numerous
similar markings inside the door.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke, who owns and operates a Jamaican and West Indian bakery
called Manor House around the corner from where Diallo lived, has
been in this country 18 years. She said the neighborhood is an
immigrant destination, with arrivals primarily from Puerto Rico,
the Dominican Republic, Trinidad, Barbados and the West Indies.
</P>
<P>
   Another storekeeper said there also has been a large influx of
immigrants from West Africa _ including Senegal and Nigeria _ as
well as such East African nations as Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   Yoseph Morales, 75, owns the store where Baez works at
Westchester and Wheeler avenues.
</P>
<P>
   Morales came from Puerto Rico to the United States in the 1940s
and has owned his store for 26 years. He said that when he first
arrived, the neighborhood was mostly Italian and Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be a crime-ridden neighborhood. Not anymore,''
Morales said. ``The Police Department cleaned them up.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a haven for drugs in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, he said.
In the past five years, the police ``cleaned house,'' Morales said,
and now the neighborhood is livable.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, he didn't agree with police tactics used in the
Diallo case and said that if four men approached him at his
doorstep at midnight and he wasn't sure they were police, he would
have run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know who they are,'' he said. ``If they came wearing
clothes like that, I'd think it was a holdup or something.''
</P>
<P>
   The four officers were in street clothes and driving an unmarked
car. The shooting sparked widespread outrage throughout the city
because of the number of shots fired and because the officers are
white and Diallo was black. Critics of the department's tactics
claim the police target minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a state appeals court voted to move the trial of the
four officers _ on murder and reckless endangerment charges _ from
the Bronx to Albany for a trial starting Jan. 31. The court held
that extensive media coverage of the case had made it impossible to
pick a fair jury anywhere in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The move concerned some people in the city and the Bronx, who
said the move stripped them of their right to sit in judgment of
police tactics in their neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   One Soundview resident, who identified himself only as Robert
and as a recent immigrant from the Caribbean, said, ``It happened
in the Bronx, it (the trial) should be in the Bronx.''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Street Crime Unit was greatly expanded _ from about 100
officers to about 400 officers _ some three years ago. That,
critics say, permitted officers with less experience to join. Each
of the officers charged with murder in Diallo's death had been a
police officer since the early 1990s. Only Carroll had been
assigned to the Street Crime Unit for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the officers _ Carroll, McMellon and Boss _ had been
involved in prior shootings, according to a Police Department
spokesman. That is unusual for a department in which more than 90
percent of officers reportedly never fire their weapons in the line
of duty. In those previous incidents, all three officers were found
to have acted properly. In Boss' case, he killed a man reportedly
armed with a shotgun in Brooklyn on Oct. 31, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials deny that unqualified officers are brought into
the unit and say their law enforcement tactics do not target any
population in particular.
</P>
<P>
   Further, they point to dramatic successes in lowering the crime
rate in recent years. Since 1990, when the city's murder total was
2,245 _ an all-time high _ the rate has plummeted. In 1998, 629
people were murdered in New York City, the lowest number since the
early 1960s. Last year it climbed slightly to 667, according to Lt.
Stephen Biegel, a police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   In response to criticisms, Biegel said the Street Crime Unit
officers ``are doing dangerous work, and people are going to look
at them differently.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ``There are plenty of people who are grateful that
they can let their kids play on the street where they couldn't a
while back.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOZDOK, Russia _ Acknowledging that the Kremlin had
underestimated the cost of defeating secessionist rebels in
Chechnya, a senior Russian official said Monday that Russia had
spent 50 percent more on the war in Chechnya last year than
initially planned.
</P>
<P>
   The soaring economic, military and human costs reflect the
intensity of the fighting in the breakaway republic and the
inability of the Russian forces to bring the conflict to an early
close.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's finance minister, Mikhail Kasyanov, who is also first
deputy prime minister, disclosed the cost increase in Moscow
Monday. He said the government had budgeted 3.5 billion rubles
($125 million) for the military campaign of the past several months
but had spent 5 billion rubles ($178 million).
</P>
<P>
   Kasyanov did not address future costs. But with the rebels
putting up determined resistance, the expenses are likely to be
high. The Russian military has yet to take Grozny, and thousands of
militants are also challenging Russian troops in the Chechen
highlands.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of carrying out the military campaign is just part of
the expense Russia faces. Even if the Russians subdue Chechnya,
they plan to station an army division and a brigade of interior
troops indefinitely in the breakaway republic to fend off guerrilla
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Kasyanov's figures also did not include the money that Russian
officials say will be required to rebuild the republic when the war
ends. The cost of rebuilding Grozny alone, which is being battered
daily by Russian artillery and air strikes, will exceed $1 billion,
according to Nikolai Koshman, the Russian government's senior
representative in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The war's increasing price tag is likely to sharpen the Western
debate over providing credits and other forms of economic
assistance to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The West provided billions of dollars in credits to Russia
during the 1994-1996 war in Chechnya. Western governments insisted
that the assistance was needed to encourage economic reform, but
critics complained that the West indirectly subsidized a brutal
war.
</P>
<P>
   After Russia's 1998 financial collapse, Western aid was greatly
reduced and with it the West's economic and political leverage.
Still, critics have urged that Western assistance be suspended and
some form of economic sanctions imposed.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Financing is only one of the Kremlin's worries. In Moscow,
Russia's media has begun to aggressively challenge the military's
claim that it is experiencing only minimal casualties, making the
question of Russian losses a centerpiece in an emerging public
debate over the war.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Interfax news agency said that 30 Russian
servicemen had been killed and 70 wounded during the weekend. In
contrast, the official statistics put the toll at 7 dead and 51
wounded.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Interfax reported that since fighting erupted in Dagestan in
August 1,152 military servicemen and Interior Ministry troops have
been killed and 2432 wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Those figures are roughly consistent with independent estimates,
including an analysis prepared by a former Defense Ministry press
secretary and published in the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda. That
estimate put the number of soldiers killed at around 1,300 _
roughly twice the official figures.
</P>
<P>
   The rising casualty toll has already lead to one shake-up in the
Interior Ministry command and has stimulated rumors of more to
come.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Russian government has troubles on the diplomatic front as
well. The Council of Europe is debating Russia's Chechen campaign
this week amid accusations that civilians have been needlessly
killed and wounded by indiscriminate artillery barrages and air
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Lord David Russell-Johnston, the president of the council's
parliamentary delegation, recently visited Chechnya and the North
Caucasus region in a tour that was carefully arranged by the
Russians to avoid combat areas and show off their efforts to
rebuild Chechnya. To the consternation of the Russians, he later
talked by telephone with Aslan Maskhadov, the president of the
breakaway Chechen republic.
</P>
<P>
   Several council delegates suggested that Russia's membership in
the organization be suspended because of its attacks on areas where
civilians reside. A decision on Russia's membership is expected on
Thursday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Russian officials have bluntly rejected Western complaints, but
Russia sees its membership in the body as an important symbol of
its acceptance by the West. Monday night, Russia's major television
channels carried extensive reports on the upcoming meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring the importance of the issue, Russian Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov plans to attend a council session this week.
Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the nationalist lawmaker who serves as deputy
speaker of the lower house of parliament, is already at the
session. So is Sergei Kovalyov, a human rights advocate who is a
fierce critic of the war in Chechnya and who also opposes Russia's
expulsion from the council.

 &HT;    Vermeil turns burn-out into a shining season
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ What greeted Dick Vermeil on his first day of training
camp was the sun, most prominent. It dominated the sky over Macomb,
Ill., and sent rays onto the practice field as if they were shot
out of a gun.
</P>
<P>
   The girls at the refreshment stand could not sell enough water.
The fans who dared tolerate the sweltering conditions hid under
umbrellas. And yet, Vermeil, then age 61, patrolled the field,
shouting instructions and encouragement, as if it were a mild fall
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   That's what stood out with that nondescript Rams team in an
obscure town in middle America in 1997: The senior citizen coach
showed he could stand the heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got hot around here sometimes,'' second-year tight end
Roland Williams said. ``Real hot, and I'm not talking weather. We
weren't winning. But coach stayed with it. He didn't stop working.
He took the criticism and kept on working.''
</P>
<P>
   And now the sun is shining on the St. Louis Rams again. Dick
Vermeil's team weathered the tumult, eclipsed the ambitions, and is
in the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can you say about our coach?'' linebacker London Fletcher
asked. ``We've got a great leader, someone who believed in us and
made sure we believed in ourselves. Being in the Super Bowl is
great for the organization, but it's also great for coach Vermeil.
He's earned it. He's the light.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't always so sunny in St. Louis. After considerable
prodding, Vermeil admits to having gone through a
``What-in-the-name-of-a-beer-and-remote-control am I doing coaching
again?'' period.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were times when I thought if I had to do it over again .
. . ,'' Vermeil said. ``I felt this (year) was my last shot. This
is a business of winning games, selling tickets. When it isn't
going well, you know something's going to happen. It's got to. I
know that. If that had bothered me, I wouldn't have come back to
coaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm glad I didn't (quit). I felt that if I stayed tough,
hung with it, we'd get this thing turned around.''
</P>
<P>
   Vermeil did more than that: he turned the franchise upside down.
He brought in eight new starters on offense from his first year and
eight on defense. He hired a new kicker and a new punter and a new
offensive coordinator. And through the first two years, of nine
victories in 32 games, Vermeil noticed growth not detectable by the
naked eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``The talent wasn't as good as it was supposed to be when I got
here,'' he said. ``But we worked at it and worked at it. And then I
started noticing a lot of little things. In rebuilding, a lot of
times, fans and ownership can't notice the small wins within a
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lose eight straight, and all I talk about is winning,'' he
said. ``I told the team: `I can't tell you when, but it will turn
around.' It starts with the small wins, and then, all of a sudden,
those small wins turn into an explosion _ and you have a winning
team.''
</P>
<P>
   A Super Bowl team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We rallied around each other,'' offensive lineman Fred Miller
said. ``We ate together, hung out together, grew together.''
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, all of that took place this season. In his first two
years back, Vermeil seemed to revert to the ``burn out''
characteristics that prompted his resignation from Philadelphia
Eagles in 1983. He did not spend nights at the office as he did
back then, but Vermeil became too hands-on and ultra-demanding.
</P>
<P>
   His attempt last year at calling offensive plays was a failure;
he was too slow getting them in. He worked the team so hard that
there was a near-mutiny at the end of last season, when the players
threatened a walkout. Defensive tackle Joe Phillips halted the
uprising, but several players did not show for a season-ending
meeting that Vermeil had called.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, the Lawrence Philips philanthropy case was a
disaster. Former quarterback Tony Banks was coddled by Vermeil and
once brought his dog to practice. On the field, the Rams were an
accident. And there was no ``light at the end of the tunnel,''
receiver Ricky Proehl said.
</P>
<P>
   Management demanded that Vermeil right things _ fast. He had to
change or leave. Vermeil, who was driven to prove that he could
transform the Rams, made the personal transformation that changed
the team.
</P>
<P>
   He hired as offensive coordinator Mike Martz, a new-wave guru
who designed a St. Louis attack built on speed and aggressiveness.
So successful has Martz been in one season that last week he was
named Vermeil's heir.
</P>
<P>
   Vermeil trusted his strong staff of assistants and worked as an
overseer instead of a control freak. He loosened the reins on the
team and promoted an atmosphere of peace and harmony. Of family. He
became Mr. Sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   It worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``He plays the background a little more than in the first two
years,'' All-Pro receiver Isaac Bruce said. ``I really don't see
him with my natural eye that much, but I'm sure his input is there.
He kind of stands back and patrols things, like a coach should.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not as intense or demanding or emotional,'' Vermeil said.
``I'm still too much of all that. But I'm better at delegating and
better at leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   He has shown that he has become keen at assessing talent, too,
based on the roster moves made by him and Charley Armey, the team's
vice president of player personnel. He got lucky with quarterback
Kurt Warner; no one could have anticipated that he would become the
NFL's most valuable player. But it took discerning judgment to pick
up former Green Bay offensive tackle Alan Timmerman; to hand the
middle linebacker job to a former Division III basketball star,
London Fletcher; and to draft receivers Torry Holt and Az-Zahir
Hakim.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two things I believe in,'' Vermeil said. ``One is
that players win games. In 1961, I was 24 years old coaching at
Hillsdale High (in San Mateo, Calif.). We won a lot, and I thought
I was a genius. The next year, I lost my quarterback, running back
and my offensive tackle went to Stanford. We won four games. I
realized then that players win games.''
</P>
<P>
   The other thing Vermeil said he stands by is assembling the best
possible coaching staff. And using it, as well. ``I owe it to the
players to have the best possible teachers to get out their talent
and push them a little more,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although still old school, Vermeil showed that he has caught up
with the times. In the NFL, speed wins, and the Rams have the
fastest offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that it's a game of movement,'' he said. ``And the
better you move, the better you are.''
</P>
<P>
   For a movie version of Dick Vermeil's life, the start would have
to have range and ample gray. And he would have to be able to cry
on cue, for Vermeil has gotten more emotional with age.
</P>
<P>
   In his three years in St. Louis, Vermeil has given his
hankerchief plenty of work. On Sunday, he held back tears as he
talked about Proehl, who caught the game-winning touchdown against
Tampa Bay in the NFC Championship Game.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, he might be a little mushy and quick to force sunlight on
a dicey situation. But when the results are the Super Bowl, who can
argue? Not Vermeil. He took on the challenge after 14 years as a
football television analyst because the bug bit him and he wanted
to prove something to himself.
</P>
<P>
   He has done that, but now he wants more. ``We're not finished
yet,'' Vermeil said. ``We haven't accomplished our ultimate goal.
We set out to win the Super Bowl. And that hasn't been done yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to prove something. I got that off my chest. I can
handle it, keep the game in perspective, provide leadership, handle
the highs and lows. At my age, I want to walk away knowing I can do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dick Vermeil can take that walk now. Whatever happens Sunday
against the Tennessee Titans, he has proved his point. At 63, Dick
Vermeil can stand the heat.

AFRICAN LEADERS URGE CONGO PEACEKEEPING FORCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE LAURIA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ African leaders embroiled in a regional war in
Congo Monday called on the United Nations to immediately send
peacekeepers to the country despite objections by the United
States, which first wants to see concrete signs that a peace
agreement is holding.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of six African countries on both sides of the conflict
agreed in a special summit at the United Nations that only a quick
deployment of UN troops can end the war that has cost thousands of
lives and made more than a million people refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, who chaired the
meeting, said: ``Because of (Congo's) location and size, and
because of the number of countries involved, the conflict there
could be described as Africa's first world war. The continent
cannot hope to meet the aspirations of its people until this war is
history.''
</P>
<P>
   But Albright said the warring parties must, during week-long
talks at the United Nations, ``detail in a credible fashion their
plans for meeting the commitments they have made'' in the
cease-fire they signed last July in Lusaka, Zambia.
</P>
<P>
   Until that happened the United States could not support
deploying a force of 3.500 peacekeepers, proposed by UN Secretary
General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Provided our efforts this week result in renewed impetus
towards implementation of the peace agreement, we will consult with
our Congress and work to achieve a swift council consensus on
authorizing deployment of a . . . UN peace mission,'' Albright
said.
</P>
<P>
   The civil war in Congo stems from the 1994 massacre of 800,000
people in Rwanda and the 1997 overthrow of Zaire's dictator for 32
years, Mobuto Sese Seko.
</P>
<P>
   Mobuto was toppled with the support of Rwanda, Burundi, and
Uganda and replaced by President Laurent Kabila, who changed the
country's name from Zaire to Democratic Repoublic of Congo. Kabila
soon broke this alliance and backed a force of 40,000 Hutu militias
who had fled into Congolese territory following their genocidal
attacks against Tutsi in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   Uganda, Burundi, and Uganda in August 1998 then supported rebels
in the eastern part of the country seeking to overthrow Kabila, who
has received air support and 10,000 troops from Zimbabwe, Namibia,
and Angola.
</P>
<P>
   The six outside countries, plus the Congo government and various
rebel factions on both sides, have violated the cease-fire since
signing the Lusaka accord.
</P>
<P>
   That deal calls for the withdrawal of foreign forces, the
disarmament and demobilization of the rebel groups into a single
Congolese army, the establishment of a joint military committee,
and the eventual introduction of UN troops, which may be authorized
to use force to achieve these ends.
</P>
<P>
   But the United States wants these violations to end before
sending UN forces. Richard Holbrooke, US ambassador to the UN, who
organized the summit, has cited UN failures in Rwanda and Somalia
in recent years as reasons for America's caution. Persuading a
Congress hostile to UN missions to release funds is another reason,
diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   Though all pledged to uphold the Lusaka accord, an immediate end
to continued fighting appeared far off Monday as the leaders of the
warring countries, meeting face to face in the Security Council,
lost no opportunity to hurl accusations at one another.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila said the cease-fire would fail until ``an immediate and
unconditional withdrawal of the uninvited aggressor forces.'' These
should be replaced ``systematically by the deployment of UN
troops,'' Kabila said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Congolese people and government expect that at this
special session (the Security Council) will be able to halt the
occupation of part of out national territory by the occupying
forces of Rwanda, Uganda, and Burundi,'' Kabila said.
</P>
<P>
   In response, an angry Yoweri Museveni, president of Uganda,
asserted: ``It is a red herring to talk about the territorial
integrity of Congo. That is not the issue. The issue is that in the
last century only Hitler's Germany and Pol Pot's Cambodia have
competed with our area'' for the worst genocide.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1960, 1.2 million Rwandese, 400,000 Burundians, and
800,000 Ugandans ``have been exterminated by the fascist regimes of
Rwanda and Burundi, by Idi Amin, the monster of Uganda, and by
Mobutu,'' Museveni said.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila had forgotten that Uganda, Rwanda, and Burundi had
supported him to overthrow Mobutu, who ``was threatening another
holocaust in our area.'' Instead Kabila had joined forces with Hutu
militia responsible for mass murder in Rwanda, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila's call for the withdrawal of ``aggressor troops'' before
a cease-fire could take hold was firmly met by Albright, who said
``the international community, including the United States, can and
does condemn the violation of the Congo's territorial integrity by
foreign troops, but we cannot compel the withdrawal of those
troops. Nor can we conduct an internal dialogue. But we can help to
make your responsibilities easier to fulfill.''

TEXAS COMPTROLLER MAY HAVE THE METTLE TO MOVE UP LADDER OF
STATEWIDE OFFICE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Barely a year on the job, Comptroller Carole
Keeton Rylander is once again mentioned as a potential candidate
for higher office, this time the lieutenant governorship.
</P>
<P>
   There's no denying that the comptroller's post has served as a
springboard for predecessors, including the late Lt. Gov. Bob
Bullock. But while the 60-year-old Republican does little to
discourage the speculation, she claims she's having the time of her
life as the state's chief tax collector, gathering up $20 billion a
year in levies from consumers, businesses and industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be the best comptroller this state has ever had, and
let me tell you, it's had some great comptrollers,'' Rylander said
last week.
</P>
<P>
   The job, paying $92,217 a year, is not everyone's idea of fun
and definitely produces enemies along with friends. While raking in
$1 million in campaign contributions, Rylander has shut down scores
of tax-delinquent businesses _ some permanently.
</P>
<P>
   With TV cameras rolling, she brazenly seized cash registers at
Austin's legendary Antone's nightclub as a show was about to begin.
In Dallas and Houston, she strictly enforced tax laws at gun shows.
In Waxahachie, she locked up the assets of a Republic of Texas
activist, who she claimed was a tax dodger.
</P>
<P>
   Her staff of 2,800 workers, with an annual budget of $175
million, also keeps an eye on the state's $49 billion annual
spending. She kept the Legislature in suspense for weeks while she
and her in-house experts calculated how much surplus revenue they
would have _ enough, it turned out, for a teacher pay raise and
some tax cuts. And at the urgent behest of Gov. George W. Bush, her
team led the Texas Funeral Services Commission out of regulatory
chaos last year.
</P>
<P>
   This year, her staff is conducting 20 school district audits
that could expose management flaws, induce improvements, and
produce friends and foes in the political grass roots.
</P>
<P>
   While Rylander doesn't shy from the spotlight, Deputy
Comptroller Billy Hamilton, who served under Bullock and successor
John Sharp, is the agency's chief off-stage economics wizard.
Hamilton, some observers say, provides invaluable expertise and
consistent policies at a politically charged agency that never
knows from where the next incoming missile will be launched. Just
this month, it was literally from across the street.
</P>
<P>
   Rylander annoyed another GOP official _ Land Commissioner David
Dewhurst _ by prodding him to disclose out-of-state purchases that
might be subject to the sales and use tax. The unfinished flap, in
which Dewhurst raised the question of unfair and selective
enforcement of an obscure levy, touched off the latest round of
conjecture that Rylander, along with Dewhurst, were angling for
higher office, possibly the same one.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Rylander circumvented the hypotheticals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if there's anything I've enjoyed more than
this,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her resume includes stints as a high school teacher, school
board and city council member, Austin mayor, state insurance board
appointee, campaigner for Clayton Williams and Texas Railroad
Commission chairman _ usually the first woman in the elected roles.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, she lost bitter contests for Congress and the
railroad commission. And as early as 1985, when she bolted the
Democratic Party to unsuccessfully challenge a longtime ally,
former U.S. Rep. J.J. ``Jake'' Pickle, D-Austin, her office-hopping
tendency drew brickbats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to understand,'' Pickle said at the time. ``Most
people see it as an act of opportunism.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rylander talks only about her current mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love what I'm doing. Being comptroller, there isn't a facet
of the state you don't touch. The whole reason I do anything is to
try to make a difference. I think you can really make a difference
in this office,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond trimming her staff by about 130 workers, Rylander said
she has fulfilled all major campaign promises. Her pledges included
treating taxpayers, even deadbeats, more fairly, and allowing more
businesses to self-audit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to harass the good guys. I want to spend my
resources and time going after the tax cheat, which is exactly what
I've done,'' Rylander said.
</P>
<P>
   Lately she's been touting ``e-Texas,'' her initiative to gather
ideas on improving resident interaction with government, such as
using the Internet to tap state services, comply with regulations,
pay taxes or obtain driver's licenses. Late this year, an advisory
body will prepare suggestions for lawmakers who convene in 2001,
but Rylander already calls the effort ``really the cornerstone of
my administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Some agencies didn't immediately embrace Rylander's effort. This
month, Texas Public Safety Commission Chairman James B. Francis Jr.
instructed staff members to guard against the commandeering of the
agency's powers by e-Texas operatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't let them usurp any of your authority. If there's an
attempt to usurp anything other than PR (public relations), let the
commission know,'' Francis told staff members. ``The bottom line
is, you are in charge of driver's licenses. She is not.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Francis said that Rylander is a ``fine comptroller'' who
is ``doing a great job.'' Nonetheless, he said zealous aides were
``grandstanding'' and ``overstepping their bounds'' while
advocating online driver's license issuance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a program we have been moving forward on and we will
continue to move forward on. This is our statutory authority. This
is not the comptroller's business, and we will continue to do our
job,'' Francis said.
</P>
<P>
   Rylander said she hasn't encountered resistance to e-Texas,
which will formulate suggestions in public despite initial plans to
keep some deliberations private.
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis that Rylander places on ``e-Texas'' also feeds
speculation that she has another office in mind. The scenarios
hinge on Bush ascending to the presidency and Lt. Gov. Rick Perry
moving into the Governor's Mansion, vacating his post as presiding
officer of the Texas Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Political consultant Bill Miller said Rylander may have the
mettle to move up the ladder.

   ``She's innovative. She thinks outside the box. She does her own
thing,'' Miller said, adding he doubts she would seek the next U.S.
Senate seat that becomes available.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her future is based in Texas, in statewide office,'' he
contends. ``She'll make her move on something _ there's no
question.''

<P>
   Texas Democratic Party Chairman Molly Beth Malcolm, who
criticized Rylander's brief tenure as comptroller, said it wouldn't
be out of character for Rylander to seek another office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her commitment seems to be to her own advancement rather than
to the good of the people. She has a history of moving from one job
to another before she completes what she's been elected to do,''
Malcolm said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has not done a good job as comptroller,'' Malcolm added.
``She totally dismantled the most successful program that was put
in by her predecessor John Sharp, the Texas Performance Review, and
she put in this e-commerce thing that nobody knows what it's going
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Rylander won't disclose ambitions beyond her current term, which
ends in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe George W. Bush will be the next president. ...
Therefore, Rick Perry will be the next governor. It's exciting
times,'' Rylander said, ``but I don't think that changes the course
any of what's going on in this shop.''

PATRIOTS TO INTERVIEW CAPERS, DONAHOE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Dom Capers and Tom Donahoe, the coach/general manager
duo who may have moved from Plan B to Plan A on the Patriots'
priority list, will interview in New England Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Capers, the Jacksonville Jaguars' defensive coordinator, is
expected to spend much of the afternoon with Robert and Jonathan
Kraft and Andy Wasynczuk. Donahoe will interview in the morning,
but it appears that the two will be interviewed together, as well,
at some point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously I'm very excited and flattered about interviewing in
New England with Mr. Kraft,'' said Capers from Jacksonville, where
the Jaguars were eliminated from the playoffs Sunday by the
Tennessee Titans. ``Being a head coach in the NFL is every coach's
dream and goal.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots may be leaning more toward Capers and Donahoe as
the Bill Belichick situation gets more complicated. Belichick's
attorney, Jeffrey Kessler, filed an antitrust lawsuit against the
NFL in federal court in Newark Monday and also asked for a
temporary restraining order that would allow other NFL teams to
interview Belichick. A judge will make a ruling on the latter this
morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The league has failed on matters of antitrust laws,'' said
Kessler. ``This will prevent the NFL from directing teams not to
talk to Bill Belichick for employment opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Capers spoke well of Donahoe, with whom he worked in Pittsburgh
for three seasons (1992-94); Donahoe was director of football
operations and Capers was defensive coordinator. But Capers
downplayed the suggestion that he and Donahoe would be hired as a
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's just speculation,'' said Capers. ``I worked
with Tom and we have a strong working relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Capers left Pittsburgh in 1995 to become head coach at Carolina,
where he went 31-35 in four seasons, leading the Panthers to the
playoffs the second year. He dropped to 4-12 in '98, a season in
which the Panthers had huge problems with quarterback Kerry
Collins.
</P>
<P>
   Capers is scheduled to interview Wednesday for the head job in
New Orleans, another place where Donahoe has been mentioned. The
Saints also are considering promoting Charlie Bailey, a personnel
administrator.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots and Jets have not discussed Belichick since having
a brief conversation on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   On New York radio station WFAN's ``Mike and the Mad Dog'' show
Monday, Bill Parcells said the Belichick issue was not under his
jurisdiction. When asked by cohost Chris Russo whether he would
feel comfortable negotiating a settlement with Kraft, Parcells
said, ``That situation may be going to court. It's not up to us to
work out a deal with them, it's up to them to work out a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets reportedly are seeking a first- and a fourth-round
draft pick for Belichick. The Patriots aren't willing to give up
the first-rounder.

TYSON GETS THE ROYAL TREATMENT IN LONDON 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Mike Tyson gathered about a dozen boys and girls to sit
ringside at his workout at the Grosvenor House Hotel on Monday
afternoon. Sitting on the floor with their little heads tilted up
at the ring, the children looked like they were about to hear a
bedtime story.
</P>
<P>
   Instead they saw Tyson try to turn the lights out on a sparring
partner, Leroy Seales. Near the end of the third round, Tyson
ripped a left hook into Seales' ribs and another left to the side
of his head and Seales dropped to one knee.
</P>
<P>
   A grim fairy tale, indeed. The workout was over. Julius Francis,
whom Tyson will fight Saturday at the MEN Arena in Manchester,
England, could be in for a short night.
</P>
<P>
   After the workout the children mugged for the cameras with
Tyson. One little boy wearing a pair of white boxing gloves tried
to take Tyson's head off with a right uppercut, and the former
heavyweight champion lit up with glee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids don't know any difference when you say Mike Tyson was
convicted of rape or got in a fight with a tourist,'' Tyson said.
``They just want a famous guy to show them love and respect and
make them feel like somebody. I was once snubbed by a famous boxer.
It had such a bad effect me. It lasted for so many years. I don't
want to be the cause of someone feeling like that. You feel like
you're dirt. He talked to everybody else but you.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson's emotions were close to the surface Monday. He was asked
what his favorite tourist attraction in London had been. He said he
had enjoyed Big Ben and Madame Toussaud's Wax Museum, although he
is not a wax figure there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe in the chamber of horrors,'' he said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   That dredged up another humiliating experience, which caused
Tyson's mood to shift sharply.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife and I were in Hollywood and we went into a wax
museum,'' he said. ``We went into the chamber of horrors and there
was a wax dummy of me in a cage. It devastated my wife. They
humiliated and degraded me in front of my wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my life I've been humiliating me,'' Tyson said, choking
back tears as his anger rose. ``You think I don't hate everybody?
You don't think I don't have pain?''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson, told to take a hike by the Nevada State Athletic
Commission and snubbed by the boxing establishment in New York, has
come to England for the love he feels he cannot get in America.
Despite the fact that some politicians here worked to have Tyson
barred from England because of his 1992 rape conviction in Indiana,
and women's groups protested his presence once he arrived, Tyson
has chosen to ignore them and embrace the fans who embrace him.
</P>
<P>
   He has been given royal treatment. Throngs of fans camp outside
the hotel day and night hoping to get a glimpse of him as he goes
out to run or shop. The newspapers have made him front page news
everyday, covering his every move, often skewering him for
transgressions (past, present, real and imaginary).
</P>
<P>
   His early morning runs in nearby Hyde Park have created a stir,
because no one is supposed to be in the park after midnight. Tyson
was running at 3 a.m. He went to pray at a London mosque and a
near-riot broke out at the door when photographers tried to storm
the sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   He walked through the streets of Brixton, a racially mixed
section of London, and a crowd of close to 5,000 people crushed
forward to touch him. He had to seek shelter in a police station.
He escaped by sending a decoy car in one direction and then heading
off in another direction.
</P>
<P>
   No one in Tyson's camp has ever seen anything like it. Shelly
Finkel, his manager and a former rock concert promoter, said he had
hired security personnel who worked for Michael Jackson when he
toured England and they said the crowds around Tyson were greater
than for Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Michael was on the same plane that we came in on,''
Finkel said, referring to the pop star. ``He walked off the plane
and nobody cared.''
</P>
<P>
   Hedgemon Lewis, a veteran trainer who is working with Tyson, was
in the Philippines with Joe Frazier for his fight against Muhammad
Ali.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen anything like this, with all the people just
trying to touch the guy,'' Lewis said. ``Even with Joe and Ali in
the Thrilla in Manilla it wasn't even like this. It was close, but
nothing like this.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Tyson, who has visited England, but has never fought here,
cannot explain exactly why he is so popular here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not an ego stroker,'' Tyson said. ``But I know boxing
history from the beginning until now and until I die. There's never
been a fighter like me as far as drawing the people and worldwide
recognition. But no one wants to tell the American public that,
because they're afraid that people might say what you're doing to
Mike is wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you falsely accuse him of rape it is wrong and having
people worldwide think I'm a horrible person when they never read
my manuscript is wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I get a fair shake anywhere. The world
basically hates me and just the common people understand my plight.
I fight the same fight they fight. They get persecuted everyday for
being who they are. Not necessarily for being black, but just being
a poor white guy, or a poor Irish guy in Belfast where English
soldiers come and brutalize you at will, because they have the
right to do so and no one can stop them.''

`BUNNS NIGHT' A SCOTTISH RITUAL, COLD OR NO COLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ It's a brave man who wears a kilt on a cold January
day, but doing so is de rigueur this time of year if you're
Scottish, or just want to pretend to be for a night.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday is Burns Night. Or, as it sounds when the Scottish say
it, ``Bunns Night.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Burns, who wrote the words to Auld Lang Syne, remains
Scotland's most famous poet, 241 years after he was born on Jan.
25, 1759, in a small thatched cottage in Alloway.
</P>
<P>
   Burns Night is for Scots around the world what St. Patrick's Day
is for the Irish, a celebration of Scottish identity and culture.
Scotland has a population of just 5 million, but there are about 25
million in the Scottish diaspora, which explains the adage, ``A
Scotsman is never at home but when he's abroad.''
</P>
<P>
   Scots living in London often complain about the invisibility
here of things Scottish, saying Scotland too often makes the news
only when something terrible or controversial happens there. Some
say they had never felt more Scottish than when they lived among
the English.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Winfield is a case in point. Born in Scotland, she left
as a child and grew up in South Africa. She married an Englishman,
has three young children, and spent much of the last decade living
in Manhattan before moving to London recently. Living abroad, she
soaked up African and American culture but did little to celebrate
her own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, but I'm Scottish now,'' she said, during The Burns Club of
London's annual Burns Night dinner Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   As if to prove the point, she dug into a plate of haggis,
Scotland's national dish made from what George MacPherson, a Burns
Club official, described cryptically as ``a sheep's offal.'' A
later reading of the Oxford Dictionary revealed that haggis is a
sheep's lungs, heart, and liver mixed with oatmeal and boiled in
the animal's stomach.
</P>
<P>
   Before anyone could eat the haggis, however, MacPherson had to
stab it with a wee dagger called a dirk. That was after he talked
to it, reciting Burns's ``Address to a Haggis,'' which is
essentially a poem about the virtues of sheep and the people who
eat them. All this is part an elaborate, high-spirited ceremony,
celebrating a heritage many Scots are determined to keep alive,
especially as European integration melts borders and modernization
melds cultures.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Kennedy, the Scottish-born leader of the Liberal
Democrats, Britain's third-largest party, said it is popular around
this time of year for politicians, especially those seeking
Scottish votes, to exploit Burns, saying he would have been a
member of their party if he had not died of a heart attack in 1796
at the age of 37.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, who was keynote speaker at Saturday night's dinner at
the Hotel Russell in central London, said Britain's two big parties
make something of a stretch to try to claim Burns. One of Burns's
love poems paid homage to ``Maggie'' two centuries before Margaret
Thatcher became a Conservative icon. Burns's most quoted line of
verse, ``My love is like a red, red rose,'' refers to the Labor
Party's symbol.
</P>
<P>
   But Kennedy, the only Scotsman to lead a major British party,
insists Burns would in fact have been a Liberal Democrat ``because
he means all things to all people,'' something the party's
detractors accuse it of trying to do.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all of the 100 or so men at the dinner donned Highland
formal wear, with kilts of various tartans and a dagger known as a
``skean dhu'' tucked in their socks. All this to honor a man who
was born to impoverished, illiterate farmers and began tilling the
soil like his father before he decided to become a writer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The poetic genius of my country found me at the plough, and
threw her inspiring mantle over me,'' Burns wrote. ``She bade me
sing the loves, the joys, the rural scenes and rural pleasures of
my native soil, in my native tongue I turned my wild artless notes
as she inspired.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's the English translation. In his native tongue,
Lallans, the Scottish lowlands dialect, his admiration for
introspection was expressed as: ``O wad some Pow'r the giftie gie
us, to see oursels as ithers see us.''
</P>
<P>
   While it is a celebration of Scottish literature, food, drink,
and music, Burns Night is not exclusionary. On Saturday night,
there were two tables of Americans, some Nigerians in their native
dress, and assorted Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans invariably messed up the dances, going left when
they should have gone right, and vice versa. But the Scots were
unfailingly patient.
</P>
<P>
   For the uninitiated, a Burns Night leaves one with three
inescapable conclusions: Scotch is something best consumed in
moderation, bagpipes are meant to be played outdoors, and the Scots
know how to throw a party.

&HT;     SISTER OF MURDER VICTIM SEEKS NO VENGEANCE AT EXECUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By LISA SANDBERG  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Karen Newsum hopes the final image her sister's killer sees at
his execution Tuesday is the face of his victim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want him to know that she still matters,'' said the older
sister of Leta Ann Jones Wilkerson, who was slain on Aug. 1, 1990,
during the robbery of the victim's dry cleaning business.
</P>
<P>
   Glen McGinnis, 17, was convicted of the crime and is scheduled
to be executed by lethal injection Tuesday in Huntsville.
</P>
<P>
   Newsum and three other family members, including Wilkerson's
21-year-old daughter, will be watching from the death chamber's
visiting room when McGinnis, now 26, is executed.
</P>
<P>
   She said she is not seeking vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I forgave him first for my sister, and I knew before I went to
his execution I would have to forgive him for myself,'' she said.
``Leta would have been the first to forgive him and would have
turned right around and have helped him.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilkerson, who was 30, was alone at the cleaners she and her
husband owned in Conroe, about 45 miles north of Houston, when
McGinnis came in and demanded money. After taking about $100 in
cash and checks, McGinnis fired five shots into his victim.
</P>
<P>
   Because of his age at the time of the murder, McGinnis'
scheduled execution touched off a wave of international protests,
including a direct appeal from Pope John Paul II to Texas Gov.
George W. Bush, the Republican presidential hopeful who supports
the death penalty. The United States is the world's only developed
country that executes inmates who were under age 18 at the time of
their crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Newsum is not swayed by the arguments of death penalty
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a teacher and I can tell you that at 17 these kids know
right from wrong _ even if they haven't been raised in the perfect
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   She was referring to reports that McGinnis had been raped at age
10 by his stepfather and subjected to vicious beatings. Once he was
struck over the head with a baseball bat. Another time his mother
and stepfather burned his stomach with hot grease. McGinnis left
home when he was 11.
</P>
<P>
   Texas lets up to five members of the inmate's and victim's
families witness executions from separate rooms. Dan Guerra,
assistant director of the Victim Services Division of the Texas
Department of Criminal Justice, said executions tend to be more
emotional for the inmate's family, since they are grappling with
their loved one's death for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say executions are painless for victims'
families.
</P>
<P>
   Stephani Walsh, whose mother was murdered in 1977 in her San
Antonio home by Joseph John Cannon, said her relatives were not
emotionally prepared for the 1998 execution of the killer, who was
17 at the time of his crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was closure but it was traumatic,'' Walsh said. ``And it
did create another anniversary date.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Susan Lucci of the soap opera ``All My Children''
recently replaced Bernadette Peters in ``Annie Get Your Gun'' for
three weeks. Kathie Lee Gifford of ``Regis and Kathie Lee'' is
going on for Carol Burnett on Tuesday nights through Feb. 15 in
``Putting It Together.'' Robert Urich of ``Spenser: For Hire'' has
just completed a three-month stint in ``Chicago'' and may return
this summer. And on Tuesday night Jack Wagner of ``Melrose Place''
and ``General Hospital'' is stepping into the title roles in
``Jekyll &AMP; Hyde.''
</P>
<P>
   Not one of these television stars _ along with numerous others
who preceded them _ had appeared on Broadway before. None had the
classic up-from-the-ranks training that has marked theatrical
careers since the days of Ruby Keeler. None had earned reputations
as distinguished actors on film. Some even had to take vocal
lessons to help them pull off their parts.
</P>
<P>
   But in an age when Broadway, more than ever, has become
dominated by megamusicals and revivals dependent in part on ticket
sales to tourists, this didn't seem to matter. Producers to an ever
greater degree are turning away from Broadway's traditional talent
repositories and toward the ultimate mass-market medium _
television _ to help fill seats and the demanding lead roles that
were previously saved for some of theater's most accomplished
veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is like a consumer product and you're trying to build
market share,'' said Scott Zeiger, the president of SFX Theatrical,
which produced ``Jekyll and Hyde.'' ``A star gives you that
competitive edge.''
</P>
<P>
   While television stars have been trickling into Broadway shows
over the last 20 years, this season and last have been notable for
their sheer number. Last season brought Tony Danza of ``Taxi'' in
``The Iceman Cometh,'' Polly Draper of ``Thirtysomething'' in
``Closer,'' Scott Wolf of ``Party of Five'' in ``Side Man'' (as
well as the film actors Christian Slater and Andrew McCarthy) and
Wayne Knight of ``Seinfeld'' and now ``Third Rock from the Sun'' in
``Art.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps tellingly, producers do not yet seem confident enough in
these stars to have them originate their Broadway roles. Rather,
the stars are generally brought in as replacements in a rather
brazen attempt to boost ticket sales for a show that is already up
and running.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while movie stars are almost guaranteed to draw crowds
on Broadway, television stars are not necessarily such a sure bet,
some producers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``TV stars are more transient _ their stardom has a finite
life,'' said Emanuel Azenberg, who produced ``Iceman'' last year
with Kevin Spacey (and made a hefty profit). ``What's the other
woman who was in `Laverne and Shirley'? If you put her on Broadway,
she wouldn't sell a thing. But Lauren Bacall, look, she still packs
'em in.'' (Ms. Bacall is currently appearing in ``Waiting in the
Wings.'')
</P>
<P>
   With years of experience on Broadway _ including a Tony award
for her performance in ``Song and Dance'' and a Tony nomination for
``Sunday in the Park with George'' _ Ms. Peters, who reclaimed the
role of Annie Oakley last week, is widely considered the queen of
Broadway musical theater.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Ms. Lucci has spent the last 30 years on the
daytime soap opera ``All My Children'' and, although she gave a
strong audition for ``Annie Get Your Gun,'' had to work intensively
with a vocal coach in preparing to fill Ms. Peters' shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gifford is stepping in once a week for Ms. Burnett, who has
had a long career performing on Broadway in productions like ``Once
Upon a Mattress'' (1959) and ``Moon Over Buffalo'' (1995) as well
as displaying her musical theater talent on her long-running
variety show. Ms. Gifford hosts a morning talk show, although she
is a cabaret singer who has performed in cruise-ship commercials
and on her Christmas specials.
</P>
<P>
   Urich played the role of Billy Flynn, which was originated by
James Naughton, who first appeared on Broadway in 1977 and has
since won Tony awards for his performances in ``Chicago'' and
``City of Angels.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he went to drama school and studied acting with Stella
Adler, Wagner has spent his career on ``General Hospital'' and
``Melrose Place.'' The actors who have played Jekyll and Hyde
before include Robert Cuccioli _ the original _ and Robert Evan,
both of whom paid their dues in regional theater.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, some Broadway neophytes have faced lukewarm
receptions. In reviewing Donny Osmond in ``Little Johnny Jones'' in
1983, Frank Rich wrote in The New York Times: ``The young Osmond is
as yet a limited performer whose dancing is more like prancing and
whose expressions range from a mild pout to a broad grin (with few
gradations in between). But he is sincere and does know how to
sing.''
</P>
<P>
   Several members of the latest group of imported stars have fared
better. In Newsday, Linda Winer grudgingly commended Ms. Gifford's
Broadway debut. ``Of all the casting stunts in recent Broadway
infamy, the hiring of Kathie Lee Gifford for a Stephen Sondheim
revue would seem to catapult the merely cynical into the legends of
the outright contemptible,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact _ and Howard Stern is going to hate this,'' she
concluded, ``Gifford is professional, conscientious and actually a
little touching.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the Broadway newcomers say they have gotten far
more out of the experience than what for them is a comparatively
modest paycheck and publicity. ``I trained like a marathoner for
this,'' Ms. Gifford said. ``I went in like a sponge and said: `Fill
me up. I'm the virgin here.'''
</P>
<P>
   This ``virgin'' experience stands in stark contrast to a time
when the Great White Way seemed to be reserved for the seasoned
masters and symbolized the ultimate prize in legitimate theater: a
reward for years of voice, acting and dance classes, for toiling in
regional playhouses, touring companies and summer stock
productions.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, in his review of Ms. Lucci in The New York Post,
Clive Barnes found her greenness problematic. ``What she lacked,
apart from experience, was much real presence,'' he wrote, ``that
sense of stage charisma that all legendary roles in Broadway
musicals absolutely demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the moment at least,'' Barnes added, ``she shouldn't give
up her day job.''
</P>
<P>
   As more stars infiltrate theater, the call for craft has been
less insistent, some observers say. For one thing, with most actors
using microphones on stage _ to the chagrin of sound purists _ the
art of great vocal projection is no longer essential.
</P>
<P>
   But Broadway producers defend television stars as formidable
talents, fast learners and, in today's market, financial
necessities. ``Having a television star on Broadway is a wonderful
hedge on your bet,'' Zeiger said. It gives you press attention, it
gives you something to market and it helps you cut through all the
other clutter that's out there.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, Azenberg said Spacey was responsible for
``Iceman's'' profitability. ``He sold the O'Neill out and he saved
us half a million dollars in advertising which we didn't have to
do,'' Azenberg said. ``Stars bring in the people, but also reduce
the costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Producers also insist they only cast the stars who are up to the
task. ``I think it's great that he's a television star and that
adds whatever it adds,'' Frank Wildhorn, the composer of ``Jekyll &AMP;
Hyde,'' said of Wagner. ``But the reason Jack is coming in is he's
a great singer.''
</P>
<P>
   As far back as 1959, David Merrick presented Jackie Gleason in
``Take Me Along.'' In subsequent years, Broadway has been visited
by stars like Sid Caesar in ``Little Me'' (1962), Gilda Radner in
``The Lunch Hour'' (1980) and David and Shaun Cassidy in ``Blood
Brothers (1983).
</P>
<P>
   Fran and Barry Weissler have made a regular practice of putting
television stars in Broadway shows. Their 1994 revival of
``Grease,'' for example, included everyone from Maureen McCormick
of ``The Brady Bunch'' to Mackenzie Phillips of ``One Day at a
Time'' to Ricky Paull Goldin of ``Another World.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We used everybody who could walk,'' Ms. Weissler said. ``We
even used the one who threw up the green soup in `The Exorcist' _
Linda Blair.''
</P>
<P>
   And some have come with considerable stage experience, like Tom
Wopat, now in ``Annie Get Your Gun,'' who may be best known for
television's ``The Dukes of Hazzard,'' but who made his Broadway
debut as long ago as 1978 in ``I Love My Wife.'' Also Bebe
Neuwirth, familiar from ``Cheers,'' comes from a solid theater
background and has wowed audiences and critics in ``Chicago.''
</P>
<P>
   Wildhorn said television stars have the ability to draw a new
audience that Broadway needs. ``Somebody once told me there are
more people who watch a successful television show over the course
of a season than have ever seen theater in the history of the
world,'' Wildhorn said. ``You're expanding your audience, you're
trying to build a nontraditional audience. And I think that's a
healthy thing to constantly try to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically perhaps, it is in large part because of television,
as well as movies, theater veterans say, that Broadway can no
longer compete in producing star power of its own, as it did in the
days when audiences turned out in force to see Ethel Merman, Alfred
Drake or Carol Channing.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, these veterans say, even stage actors who have
repeatedly received critical acclaim, including Audra McDonald,
Kathleen Chalfant, Brian Stokes Mitchell and Cherry Jones, have not
become nationally known. And many of New York theater's most
accomplished progeny _ Nathan Lane, Sam Waterston, Kevin Kline,
Meryl Streep _ have long left Broadway for Hollywood, although they
occasionally return.
</P>
<P>
   Where actors return is often off-Broadway. Last season brought
Calista Flockhart of Ally McBeal and Lisa Gay Hamilton of ``The
Practice'' _ both of whom started in theater.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on Broadway gives stars an aura of seriousness and
legitimacy _ even nobility, in light of the big salaries they are
giving up. Wagner said taking on ``Jekyll &AMP; Hyde'' was far from
altruistic. ``I'm doing this completely for me,'' he said. ``You
get a little lazy. I realized I needed something to really pump me
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lucci, who last year finally won an Emmy for her longtime
portrayal of Erica Kane on ``All My Children,'' added: ``I just
love the medium. I loved being on stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Weissler said both Ms. Lucci and Urich had to audition for
their roles. When Frank Gifford auditioned for the role that went
to Urich, he did not even get a callback. ``He couldn't do it,''
Ms. Weissler said. ``He couldn't sing and he can't act.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Weissler said Ms. Lucci gave a strong audition, but needed
vocal training and became a dedicated pupil. ``This is a woman who
really killed herself,'' Ms. Weissler said. ``We knew people would
roll their eyes, but she proved herself to us.''
</P>
<P>
   John McDaniel, the supervising musical director of ``Annie Get
Your Gun'' who is also the band leader for ``The Rosie O'Donnell
Show,'' said: ``I think people were surprised. Audiences stood up
every single show.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gifford said she had no problem with the fact that she had
been enlisted as much for her marketing potential as for her
mastery of Sondheim's lyrics. In fact, she said she had recently
written a song about this very reality:
</P>
<P>
   ``You really shouldn't take it so personally.
</P>
<P>
   To them you're not a person, but a personality.
</P>
<P>
   And you SELL.''

A&AMP;M's BUSH SCHOOL GETS OFF TO A ROCKY START 
(For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By BARRY SHLACHTER 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ Next to the Bush Library and Museum, on
land where Texas A&AMP;M University animal researchers bred generations
of pigs, stands the new George Bush School of Government and Public
Service.
</P>
<P>
   Establishing the school was seen as a way to help bolster A&AMP;M's
national image as a player among major institutions of learning, on
top of its agricultural roots, ultraloyal alumni and proud Corp of
Cadets traditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It says, `The university has arrived,' '' said political
scientist Arnold Vedlitz, who heads the Center for Leadership
within the Bush School, which he also serves as interim assistant
dean.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush School hopes to attain the prestige of such other
presidential schools as Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of
Government and the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at
the University of Texas at Austin.
</P>
<P>
   But since its formal dedication in 1997, the school's early
years have been marked with difficult challenges, an unsought
windfall and at least one embarrassing, nearly comical episode.
</P>
<P>
   Overnight, and apparently with little or no consultation with
A&AMP;M, the Texas Legislature allocated $2.5 million to the Bush
School in a rider to an appropriations bill last spring.
</P>
<P>
   The windfall worked out to more than $83,000 per student over
two years. But it came with a condition.
</P>
<P>
   The school had to be spun off from A&AMP;M's College of Liberal Arts
and made into a free-standing, degree-granting graduate school with
its own dean.
</P>
<P>
   Then the school's advisory board _ ``handpicked by the Bush
family,'' according to a memo by A&AMP;M President Ray Bowen unearthed
by the Bryan newspaper, The Eagle _ urged the university to replace
the school's founding director, political scientist Charles
Hermann, when the post became a deanship on Sept. 1. Hermann had
been recruited from Ohio State University where he had been
director of the Mershon Center, a respected foreign policy think
tank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chuck Hermann was quite successful getting it started,'' said
Provost Ron Douglas. But the school's advisory committee wanted a
``more prestigious'' dean, ``someone with a greater national
reputation who could recruit a top-flight faculty, attract top
students and raise funds,'' Douglas said.
</P>
<P>
   The move unsettled more than a few on the sprawling Southeast
Texas campus.
</P>
<P>
   Woodrow Jones Jr., dean of the College of Liberal Arts, which
lost control of the Bush School, complained that the Legislature's
action bypassed the A&AMP;M trustees and president by directly
intervening in campus administration, which he called highly
unusual _ and stupid.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's asinine,'' the plain-speaking Jones said in an interview.
``You wake up one morning and you have a school with 35 students
and $2 million that's suddenly independent _ with no discussion
with the people who worked hard to establish it. It was our worst
nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   The provost said that the university had planned on a transition
period of several years for it to evolve into a graduate school;
Jones said A&AMP;M had figured on 10 to 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   What caused the urgency may never be known.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Bill Ratliff, R-Mount Pleasant, chairman of the
Senate Finance Committee, said the rider was added at the personal
request of the late Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Bullock was on the advisory committee for the Bush School
and he felt very strongly that it should be unfettered, shouldn't
be under the control of any other school at A&AMP;M,'' Ratliff said.
``I thought he had a good case.''
</P>
<P>
   Ratliff said Gov. George W. Bush never approached him on the
issue. Bullock died on June 18, after himself donating $20,000 from
unspent campaign funds.
</P>
<P>
   Several A&AMP;M professors have refused to teach at the Bush School
and one changed his mind about a job he had accepted as associate
dean, said George Edwards III, director of the Center for
Presidential Studies, which has become a part of the Bush School.
</P>
<P>
   One of them said it was not, as one published report suggested,
the result of a draft memo cautioning Bush School scholars against
making comments critical of the Bushes and saying that if they did,
no link with the school should be mentioned in the article or TV
segment.
</P>
<P>
   Political Science professor Kim Hill said he turned down an
offer to be an associate dean at the Bush School because of
Hermann's removal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided I would not take it because I did not like the way
he was fired,'' Hill said. ``It was done unprofessionally. And the
university was not making the decision on its own.''
</P>
<P>
   The manner led some on the campus to speculate that the move was
made to please the Bush family, Hill said. Hermann has since become
an associate dean in charge of the school's fledgling international
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears to me that the (advisory\)committee is made of
people who are close to the Bush family, which does not surprise
me,'' Hill said, adding that he supposed similar situations
occurred during the early years of the Kennedy and LBJ schools.
</P>
<P>
   But these ``advisory groups should not be making academic
policy, certainly not personnel decisions,'' Hill added.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Gates, who served as CIA director in the Bush
Administration, was appointed interim dean but has made it clear
that he doesn't want to be considered for the job on a permanent
basis.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards said fund raising for the school has lagged and others
say it's hard to select a full-time teaching staff without a
sizable endowment and a full-time dean.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't provide much vision if you're here only a few weeks
a month,'' Jones said of Gates, who has been traveling back and
forth from his home in Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   What has gotten more attention was an almost comical misstep by
the school, whose top administrators issued drafts of a memo on how
its scholars should best avoid embarrassing the Bushes in news
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   The October 1998 drafts were never issued but they became public
after a reporter for The Eagle filed a freedom-of-information
request.
</P>
<P>
   The memo drafts, also obtained by the Star-Telegram, said the
professors should not mention any Bush Center link if they offer
``negative'' personal opinions about ``any member of the Bush
family'' or any organization with which a family member is
connected.

CAR DEALERS LOOK TO LAWMAKERS FOR PROTECTION FROM INTERNET
SELLERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Texas, Wis., Conn., Ark., Idaho, La., Va., Ky., Neb.) (nk) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ Internet companies that sell cars directly to
consumers are encountering stiff opposition from auto dealers, who
are using their influence in state legislatures and with state
regulators to protect their businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Car dealers, meeting here at their annual convention, are
worried that they are being undercut or bypassed entirely by the
new services. They also are afraid that automakers might sell cars
on the Internet themselves or through the new Internet services. So
the dealers have begun pushing restrictive laws through state
legislatures to prevent this and have encouraged state regulators
to crack down.
</P>
<P>
   State regulators say that the only complaints they have been
receiving about the services have been from dealers, not consumers.
And consumer advocates say that extra competition will be good for
customers, even though there is mixed evidence on whether consumers
save money buying cars online.
</P>
<P>
   Because of state franchise laws and manufacturers' policies,
Internet services must buy cars from dealers, not directly from
manufacturers. Paying two markups, one for the dealer and one for
the Internet company, is a burden on consumers that does not exist
for many other forms of electronic commerce. This erodes any price
advantage the Internet companies may have.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has left the regulation of auto retailing
to the states, leaving potential gaps in regulation for deals that
cross state lines, said state regulators from across the nation,
who convened at a hotel near the dealers' convention for meetings
over the last four days. ``You could buy a car from a Mississippi
dealer who has his Web site in Iowa and delivers a car in Idaho _
who has jurisdiction?'' asked T. Rex Green, Idaho's supervisor of
dealer investigations. ``I can't justify to my taxpayers running
all the way to Mississippi to chase someone.''
</P>
<P>
   Dealers have already used their political muscle over the last
12 months to persuade lawmakers in nine states to tighten state
franchise laws, making it virtually impossible for manufacturers to
sell cars except through franchised dealers. Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination,
signed the toughest such law in the nation last year, and the Texas
Department of Transportation has become the nation's leader in
cracking down on Internet commerce involving cars. Many more states
are expected to consider legislation pushed by dealer groups this
year, with one bill already introduced last week in Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   State motor vehicle regulators, acting partly at the prompting
of dealers but also because of concern that businesses could use
the Internet to commit fraud, have become alarmed that Internet
companies may be violating longstanding laws in most states that
require anyone selling a new car or truck to be licensed and have a
franchise relationship with a manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   The regulators said that they believed the newest services,
those which actually deliver cars to customers' homes, may violate
laws intended to protect dealers and consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Top regulators from Wisconsin and Texas said that they had just
ordered CarsDirect.com, an Internet direct seller, to halt
operations in their state. Regulators from Virginia, Kentucky,
Nebraska and Louisiana said that they doubted CarsDirect.com and
similar companies complied with their states' laws; Louisiana
regulators said that they were ``on the verge'' of taking action on
the issue, although they refused to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Wendy Barbour, a spokeswoman for CarsDirect.com, said that the
company was still doing business in every state except Texas and
Arkansas, where the company acknowledges regulatory restrictions.
She declined to comment on any litigation and regulatory complaints
pending against the company.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators in Texas also used that state's tough new law in
November to order the Ford Motor Co. to stop using its Internet
site to sell used cars in Houston. Ford has complied, but is suing
the state to reverse the order.
</P>
<P>
   For the last three years, dozens of Internet companies have
generated sales leads for car dealers, providing abundant
information to consumers about what is available and then sending
the customer to a dealer to close the sale. But a few companies,
led by CarsDirect.com, have recently become car-buying services,
taking prepaid orders from customers, buying cars from nearby
dealers and delivering them to customers' homes on flat-bed trucks.
</P>
<P>
   The regulators reached a consensus here that a model law should
be drafted for each state to regulate car sales over the Internet,
although the details of the legislation have not been agreed upon.
Lobbyists from most state dealer associations attended Friday's
meeting and supported the drafting of such a law.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen regulators said in separate interviews that while
complaints about the new services had been coming from dealers, not
consumers, they believed that consumers could someday be hurt by
insufficient regulation of the new companies. State regulators have
the authority to enforce lemon laws, requiring manufacturers to
take back seriously defective cars, and to fine or even revoke the
licenses of dealers in their states who commit certain frauds, such
as charging a buyer for options that are not actually on a car.
</P>
<P>
   Even a few of the older Internet companies that sell referrals
to dealers are running into regulatory problems. Samuel Hedgpeth,
president and chief operating officer of Autoweb.com, said that
current state laws and regulations favored dealers. Autoweb
unsuccessfully challenged a rule in Texas, for example, that
requires companies to charge a fixed, monthly fee to dealers for
supplying them with sales leads, instead of selling each referral
separately.
</P>
<P>
   The law, Hedgpeth complained, was the equivalent of telling an
ice cream vendor that ``you have to charge the same whether it's
one scoop, two scoops or three scoops.''
</P>
<P>
   The enforcement efforts and tougher franchise laws have been
mainly in the South and Midwest, where dealers' political influence
is particularly strong. Regulators and legislatures in the
Northeast and West have done little so far to address the Internet
car-buying services, with the exception of Connecticut, where the
legislature tightened rules last year against manufacturers'
ownership of dealerships.
</P>
<P>
   For consumers, the bottom line in the current squabble is that
cars are unlikely to get much cheaper anytime soon. Fearful of
angering their dealers and increasingly constrained by state
regulations, domestic and foreign auto makers alike have said in
recent weeks that they have no plans to sell cars directly to the
public through the Internet, nor do they even plan to sell directly
to the Internet companies. Many dealers now sell several brands of
cars, and sometimes retaliate against automakers that offend them
by shifting their energy and advertising spending to a different
brand.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors ran into this problem last year, when it
announced a plan to buy and operate up to 10 percent of its
dealerships, using them partly for Internet sales, only to retreat
quickly in the face of dealers' opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Roy S. Roberts, GM's group vice president for North American
sales and marketing, said here on Sunday that the company now
planned to work so closely with dealers that consumers would not
feel a need for independent Internet services. What the services
``are trying to do is take our customers, and they can only do that
if we don't come together,'' Roberts said. ``We can cut them out.''
</P>
<P>
   GM and other automakers are planning to greatly increase the
number of cars they build to order. This would diminish the need
for dealers to hold huge inventories of cars, one of their main
functions in the current market. Once most cars are custom-built,
customers would be able to order them directly over the Internet.
Dealers are fighting now to make sure that they will handle those
orders _ and that their role is not supplanted by independent
Internet companies, or by the automakers themselves.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   According to J.D. Power &AMP; Associates, the auto consulting firm,
nearly half of all new car buyers now use the Internet for
research, and they tend to be relatively affluent. But only 2.7
percent use an Internet buying service, mostly services which send
sales leads to dealerships. The firm estimates that 10,000 or so
cars, worth about $250 million, were sold online last year, almost
all in the last few months, with the numbers rising rapidly with
each passing month.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates once supported auto franchise laws. The laws
have prevented manufacturers from retaliating against dealers that
sell cars for less than the suggested retail price. The laws also
discourage unscrupulous, unlicensed business people from pocketing
people's money and not delivering a car, which was a problem before
the 1950s, when many franchise laws were enacted.
</P>
<P>
   But now consumer groups worry that the laws are being amended in
ways that hurt customers. ``We do have some serious concerns right
now that dealers are using old franchise laws to inhibit new and
creative ways to sell cars, and most of these new and creative ways
are in consumers' interest,'' said Jack Gillis, an auto retailing
expert at the Consumer Federation of America.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes in this legal battle are enormous. Much of the retail
business now being transacted on the Internet involves fairly
inexpensive goods, like $40 shirts or $20 books; direct sales to
consumers over the Internet are estimated at $10 billion to $15
billion last year. Moving even a small part of the nation's $700
billion a year in new and used automobile sales onto the Internet
would greatly expand the scale and economic importance of
electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   But automakers and entrepreneurs alike have found that moving
car sales online is not easily done because of the regulatory
issues and the political power of the dealers. ``Everybody with a
PC and a background in Palo Alto thinks they're going to
revolutionize the auto industry and retire at 27 with a 180-foot
yacht,'' said James Holden, the president of DaimlerChrysler AG's
Chrysler Group. ``They don't have a clue.''
</P>
<P>
   One company, CarOrder.com, is trying to get around the
regulations by buying dozens of tiny, rural dealerships in large
states. The company hopes to use the dealerships to order huge
numbers of cars directly from manufacturers for sale over the
Internet. But CarOrder has not yet reached any agreements with
manufacturers, which usually limit shipments to dealerships based
on the size of the communities they serve.
</P>
<P>
   Murray Chodos, a financial consultant in Greenwich, Conn., who
bought a Toyota 4Runner sport utility vehicle that was delivered to
his home on Sunday by CarOrder.com, said that buying over the
Internet was much easier than going to a dealership. He has had a
couple of problems, though. The Toyota arrived with an empty gas
tank, while his order last November for a Lexus LS 400 sedan still
has not been filled.
</P>
<P>
   Chodos nonetheless said that he thought Internet companies
should be able to buy cars straight from manufacturers and charge
even lower prices, adding, ``I'd love to see the day when these
Internet companies can go direct, and the dealerships stick to
service.''

COLLEGE STATION, Texas: xxx is connected.

<P>
   ``You cannot deny your association with the Bush School if the
media representative is aware of it,'' noted one draft memo from
Hermann. Instead, the scholar should declare the interview off the
record or insist that no mention be made of the Bush School link,
it said.
</P>
<P>
   The memos were sparked by complaints by aides of Gov. George W.
Bush, Edwards said. One call came after Edwards himself analyzed a
Texas Poll during the 1996 presidential race, saying that Clinton
was gaining momentum. The other complaint was made after a speech
professor said the governor was a better public speaker than his
father, the former president, Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   The memo that was never issued took on a life of its own.
</P>
<P>
   After the Eagle story was reprinted elsewhere, the newspaper
industry magazine Editor &AMP; Publisher ran a lengthy piece on the
issue. It was titled, ``BUSHWHACKED: Bush Clan Chills Press, Profs
at Texas A&AMP;M.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush School officials and faculty representatives, including
those who were quoted, now insist that no one had been intimidated
or chilled and that concerns of political interference never
materialized.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards said: ``I don't think the governor was served well by
his aides. I don't think the university handled things terribly
well. But that shouldn't obscure the fact that, in the end, there
was no censorship and, in fact, there was renewed effort to protect
academic freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards said the proposed memo was not issued because it so
obviously violated the spirit of academic freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a relatively minor event that was mishandled by several
people on campus,'' said Vedlitz, who said the spurts of media
attention neglected to mention the school's successes.
Specifically, he cited its work with Houston and other cities to
tackle major infrastructure problems.
</P>
<P>
   What's clear, faculty members say, is that the Bush School must
tread carefully in its formative years _ balancing cordial ties to
a respected former president and his well-heeled supporters with
the need to maintain academic independence to nurture a national
reputation.

 GOVERNOR TURNS DEAF EAR TO FOES OF
DEATH PENALTY (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) By JOHN
MORITZ c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ As a longtime advocate for prison reform and the
leader of a national anti-death-penalty organization, Charlie
Sullivan has seen the conservative side of presidential candidate
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But he's sayd he's still waiting for a glimpse of the Texas
governor's compassionate side.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan, the executive director of Citizens United for
Rehabilitation of Errants, or CURE, is attempting to focus the
spotlight on Texas' use of the death penalty as voters put Bush
through his first tests as this year's Republican front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   The effort by Sullivan comes as Texas prepared to execute its
fifth inmate this month, with two more executions scheduled during
the next two days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our members are working hard, not only in Iowa and New
Hampshire, but in the other early primary states, trying to get
this issue before the voters,'' said Sullivan, a one-time Texan
whose office is in Washington, D.C. ``There have been so many
executions in Texas, I doubt that George Bush even knows half of
their names.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the national front-runner in the GOP presidential
nomination race, is an ardent supporter of the death penalty and
makes no apology for the fact that he has presided over more
executions than any governor in modern U.S. history, and some of
the most controversial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I support the death penalty,'' Bush said during a recent
campaign swing in Iowa. ``The reason I do is that it saves people's
lives. ... If the punishment is swift, sure and just, it will save
people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Bush took office in January 1995, Texas has sent 116
inmates to Huntsville's death chamber. Among those was Karla Faye
Tucker, the first woman to be executed in the state since the Civil
War. Tucker's professed conversion to Christianity became the
subject of countless media profiles in the weeks before she was put
to death 23 months ago for participating in a 1982 pickax slaying
in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Bush withstood pressure to spare Tucker's life from such diverse
sources as liberal activist Bianca Jagger and conservative
religious broadcaster Pat Robertson before allowing the 38-year-old
former prostitute to die.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's critics brush aside the argument that the Texas governor
has only limited power to stop an execution. Under state law, the
governor may commute a death sentence only if the 18-member Board
of Pardons and Paroles makes such a recommendation. The governor
may, however, grant a condemned inmate a one-time, 30-day stay of
execution to allow the courts or the parole board more time to
review the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas has a governor that is basically leaving it to the
bureaucrats and the people he appoints to make these life-and-death
decisions,'' Sullivan said. ``He has adopted a policy that says,
`Don't bother me unless there's something extraordinary about the
case.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his aides have disputed such assertions, arguing that
each pending execution weighs heavily on the governor's conscience.
Bush has said he reviews cases to ensure that condemned inmates
were granted full access to the courts and to erase any doubt about
whether inmates are guilty of the crime for which they were
sentenced.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents say they are frustrated that the death penalty has not
been much of an issue in many states, including Iowa and New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Alicia Claypool, executive director of the anti-death-penalty
Interfaith Alliance of Iowa, said capital punishment is ``not on
the radar screen'' in that state.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one's really talking about crime issues this year,'' said
Claypool, who heads the 1,200-member organization. ``Iowa does not
have the death penalty, and we've had some periodic battles over
whether we should adopt it. But this year, there has been very
little mention of it.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Craig Allin, a political science professor at Cornell
College in Mount Vernon, Iowa, said there might be growing notice
of Texas' execution pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly is on my radar screen,'' Allin said. ``Texas has
earned the reputation of being the death penalty capital of the
United States. Iowa has an active United Nations Association,
various Christian liberal congregations, chapters of Amnesty
International, etc., who take the death penalty seriously and who
have lobbied against it here in Iowa.''
</P>
<P>
   However, one of Allin's colleagues who is active in Iowa GOP
politics, said that such lobbying will likely carry little weight
in the caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the sort of thing that Republicans will squabble
among themselves about,'' said Robert Sutherland, a Cornell
political science professor and former Houston resident who
supports Bush. ``Even those in the Christian Coalition and the
right-to-life movement are far more concerned with the abortion
issue than with the death penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Challenger, a sociology professor at New Hampshire's
Franklin Pierce College, said issues of crime and punishment are
also taking a back seat in the Granite State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people up here are aware of what's going on in Texas
with all their executions, but it's not making an impact,''
Challenger said.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire has a death penalty statute, but there has not
been an execution there in more than a half-century, Challenger
said.
</P>
<P>
   As Iowa voters made their choices for president Monday evening,
Texas inmate Billy George Hughes was scheduled to be strapped onto
the executioner's gurney and given a lethal injection in
Huntsville. Two more inmates are scheduled to die this week.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Texas executed Spencer Goodman, David Hicks and Larry
Keith Robison. Hughes' execution Monday night will be followed by
Glen McGinnis on Tuesday night and James Moreland on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Robison's case was the subject of international controversy
because his supporters argued that his 1982 murder spree that left
five dead in the Fort Worth area was likely fueled by paranoid
schizophrenia, a condition that was diagnosed four years earlier.
Prosecutors and relatives of the victims have argued that Robison's
admitted drug use caused any mental defects.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican, Amnesty International and the European Parliament
repeatedly urged Bush to spare Robison, and the same groups are
rallying around McGinnis, arguing that he be saved because he was
17 at the time of his crime.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has routinely rejected overtures from abroad. When the
Canadian government objected to the pending execution of one of its
countrymen and a boycott of Texas tourism sites was urged, Bush
simply bristled.
</P>
<P>
   ``People just can't come into our state and cold-blood murder
somebody,'' Bush said before Joseph Stanley Faulder's execution in
June. ``That's unacceptable behavior, regardless of their
nationality.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Dieter, director of the Washington, D.C.-based Death
Penalty Resource Center, said such rhetoric defies Bush's campaign
mantra of ``compassionate conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Where is all this compassion when it comes to the mentally ill
on Death Row, the people who were sent to Death Row for crimes they
committed as children?'' Dieter asked. ``He could send a meaningful
message about compassion if he would commute their sentences. Not
set them free, just keep them in prison for life.''

GOVERNOR TURNS DEAF EAR TO FOES OF DEATH PENALTY

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ As a longtime advocate for prison reform and the
leader of a national anti-death-penalty organization, Charlie
Sullivan has seen the conservative side of presidential candidate
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But he's sayd he's still waiting for a glimpse of the Texas
governor's compassionate side.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan, the executive director of Citizens United for
Rehabilitation of Errants, or CURE, is attempting to focus the
spotlight on Texas' use of the death penalty as voters put Bush
through his first tests as this year's Republican front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   The effort by Sullivan comes as Texas prepared to execute its
fifth inmate this month, with two more executions scheduled during
the next two days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our members are working hard, not only in Iowa and New
Hampshire, but in the other early primary states, trying to get
this issue before the voters,'' said Sullivan, a one-time Texan
whose office is in Washington, D.C. ``There have been so many
executions in Texas, I doubt that George Bush even knows half of
their names.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the national front-runner in the GOP presidential
nomination race, is an ardent supporter of the death penalty and
makes no apology for the fact that he has presided over more
executions than any governor in modern U.S. history, and some of
the most controversial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I support the death penalty,'' Bush said during a recent
campaign swing in Iowa. ``The reason I do is that it saves people's
lives. ... If the punishment is swift, sure and just, it will save
people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Bush took office in January 1995, Texas has sent 116
inmates to Huntsville's death chamber. Among those was Karla Faye
Tucker, the first woman to be executed in the state since the Civil
War. Tucker's professed conversion to Christianity became the
subject of countless media profiles in the weeks before she was put
to death 23 months ago for participating in a 1982 pickax slaying
in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Bush withstood pressure to spare Tucker's life from such diverse
sources as liberal activist Bianca Jagger and conservative
religious broadcaster Pat Robertson before allowing the 38-year-old
former prostitute to die.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's critics brush aside the argument that the Texas governor
has only limited power to stop an execution. Under state law, the
governor may commute a death sentence only if the 18-member Board
of Pardons and Paroles makes such a recommendation. The governor
may, however, grant a condemned inmate a one-time, 30-day stay of
execution to allow the courts or the parole board more time to
review the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas has a governor that is basically leaving it to the
bureaucrats and the people he appoints to make these life-and-death
decisions,'' Sullivan said. ``He has adopted a policy that says,
`Don't bother me unless there's something extraordinary about the
case.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his aides have disputed such assertions, arguing that
each pending execution weighs heavily on the governor's conscience.
Bush has said he reviews cases to ensure that condemned inmates
were granted full access to the courts and to erase any doubt about
whether inmates are guilty of the crime for which they were
sentenced.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents say they are frustrated that the death penalty has not
been much of an issue in many states, including Iowa and New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Alicia Claypool, executive director of the anti-death-penalty
Interfaith Alliance of Iowa, said capital punishment is ``not on
the radar screen'' in that state.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one's really talking about crime issues this year,'' said
Claypool, who heads the 1,200-member organization. ``Iowa does not
have the death penalty, and we've had some periodic battles over
whether we should adopt it. But this year, there has been very
little mention of it.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Craig Allin, a political science professor at Cornell
College in Mount Vernon, Iowa, said there might be growing notice
of Texas' execution pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly is on my radar screen,'' Allin said. ``Texas has
earned the reputation of being the death penalty capital of the
United States. Iowa has an active United Nations Association,
various Christian liberal congregations, chapters of Amnesty
International, etc., who take the death penalty seriously and who
have lobbied against it here in Iowa.''
</P>
<P>
   However, one of Allin's colleagues who is active in Iowa GOP
politics, said that such lobbying will likely carry little weight
in the caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the sort of thing that Republicans will squabble
among themselves about,'' said Robert Sutherland, a Cornell
political science professor and former Houston resident who
supports Bush. ``Even those in the Christian Coalition and the
right-to-life movement are far more concerned with the abortion
issue than with the death penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Challenger, a sociology professor at New Hampshire's
Franklin Pierce College, said issues of crime and punishment are
also taking a back seat in the Granite State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people up here are aware of what's going on in Texas
with all their executions, but it's not making an impact,''
Challenger said.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire has a death penalty statute, but there has not
been an execution there in more than a half-century, Challenger
said.
</P>
<P>
   As Iowa voters made their choices for president Monday evening,
Texas inmate Billy George Hughes was scheduled to be strapped onto
the executioner's gurney and given a lethal injection in
Huntsville. Two more inmates are scheduled to die this week.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Texas executed Spencer Goodman, David Hicks and Larry
Keith Robison. Hughes' execution Monday night will be followed by
Glen McGinnis on Tuesday night and James Moreland on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Robison's case was the subject of international controversy
because his supporters argued that his 1982 murder spree that left
five dead in the Fort Worth area was likely fueled by paranoid
schizophrenia, a condition that was diagnosed four years earlier.
Prosecutors and relatives of the victims have argued that Robison's
admitted drug use caused any mental defects.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican, Amnesty International and the European Parliament
repeatedly urged Bush to spare Robison, and the same groups are
rallying around McGinnis, arguing that he be saved because he was
17 at the time of his crime.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has routinely rejected overtures from abroad. When the
Canadian government objected to the pending execution of one of its
countrymen and a boycott of Texas tourism sites was urged, Bush
simply bristled.
</P>
<P>
   ``People just can't come into our state and cold-blood murder
somebody,'' Bush said before Joseph Stanley Faulder's execution in
June. ``That's unacceptable behavior, regardless of their
nationality.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Dieter, director of the Washington, D.C.-based Death
Penalty Resource Center, said such rhetoric defies Bush's campaign
mantra of ``compassionate conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Where is all this compassion when it comes to the mentally ill
on Death Row, the people who were sent to Death Row for crimes they
committed as children?'' Dieter asked. ``He could send a meaningful
message about compassion if he would commute their sentences. Not
set them free, just keep them in prison for life.''

 PARENTS BEING RUN OVER, AND OVER, BY KIDS
ALLOWED TO HAVE THEIR WAY (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients)
By LIZ STEVENS c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kay Hymowitz heard this story not long ago from her neighborhood
florist:
</P>
<P>
   A woman came into the florist's shop with her small child in
tow. The child immediately grabbed a puppet on display and began
playing with it on the floor, dirtying it in the process. The
distressed florist asked the mother to take the puppet from the
child. Instead, the mother turned to the child and said, ``The lady
wants you to put it away.''
</P>
<P>
   What's wrong with this picture? A lot, Hymowitz thinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mother is saying to that child, `I can't bring myself to
limit you in that way,' says Hymowitz, author of ``Ready or Not:
Why Treating Children as Small Adults Endangers Their Future _ and
Ours.'' ``Nowhere out there is (the mother) getting the message''
that her job is to curb her child's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   As American culture grows increasingly kid-centered, parents
seem ever more confused about where to draw the line _ in meting
out discipline, in buying material goods, in granting
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I shied away from using the word permissive (in the book)
because I think it clouds the issue,'' says Hymowitz, a senior
fellow at the Manhattan Institute and mother of three. ``I think
parents are misunderstanding children. They are seeing them as much
more rational and capable than they actually are, and that makes it
much more difficult for them to understand when a child needs
direction and guidance.''
</P>
<P>
   Some parenting authorities have encouraged adults to think of
children as ``self-regulating,'' argues Hymowitz, who believes kids
are anything but. She sees this theory played out in
under-supervised classrooms and in courtrooms where the legal
system has, Hymowitz believes, ``redefined children as adult
citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   And she points to the media, which ``give children a picture of
themselves as very sophisticated and knowledgeable, which parents
often buy into.'' Hymowitz's examples: any ``Home Alone'' movie, or
the slews of sitcoms in which the 10-year-old always has a clever
comeback for Dad.
</P>
<P>
   Television plays a tremendous role in encouraging children to
want things and push limits, according to Stevanne Auerbach, aka
Dr. Toy.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens is, as soon as the child is able to watch
television, they get into demanding, `I want this, I want that,' ''
Auerbach says. ``So you're either going to give it to them because
you're frustrated or you feel that you have to because you want
them to be like all the other kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Auerbach, author of ``How to Raise a Child With a High P.Q.''
(play quotient), believes guilt has prompted working parents to
become more permissive. ``There are more demands on parents than
ever before,'' she says. ``They're working and they're stressed.
... It's not so much permissiveness as it is confusion. Parents
don't feel power, they don't feel confident.''
</P>
<P>
   Auerbach agrees with Arizona educator Sal Severe that parents
need more information today than they used to, especially when it
comes to learning to set limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole phenomenon of giving in to the whining and teasing,
we do see a lot more of it now,'' says Severe, author of ``How to
Behave So Your Children Will, Too!'' ``I call it the parent trap.
It begins when they're 2 or 3 years old, and we give in, and we
rationalize it: `Oh, well, it's just one more cookie.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Severe believes discipline is the key to avoiding permissiveness
and developing harmonious parent-child relationships. But
discipline is not the same as punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Discipline is everything we do for our kids to make them feel
responsible and accountable,'' he says. ``Punishment is a tool we
use occasionally to teach them (discipline).''
</P>
<P>
   And the greatest failing of parents when it comes to
disciplining children, Severe contends, is inconsistency: Saying no
to Brittany's request for a candy bar and then, when she's still
begging 15 minutes later, giving in; asking Justin to take out the
trash and then doing it yourself when, an hour later, the trash is
still sitting in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is the pattern you're establishing,'' Severe says,
reminding parents that, ``You can be firm but positive at the same
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Ennio Cipani, a professor of psychology at the California School
of Professional Psychology, works with children in foster families.
He sometimes suggests that these parents use point systems as
reinforcement for good behavior, such as placing marbles in a jar
``and trading them in for a special activity at the end of the
day,'' he says. ``Or when (kids) don't comply within a period of
time, taking marbles out.''
</P>
<P>
   Changing societal values and realities have confused things,
too. The way moms and dads did things 30 years ago, the goods and
services offered to children, and the range of acceptable behavior
from kids have all shifted significantly. Today's parents are left
with, at best, a fuzzy blueprint as to how to do their job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our society is very pluralistic in terms of its value system
today,'' Severe says. ``When I was a kid, no matter where I went to
play, the rules were pretty much the same. That made it easy for me
to learn right from wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he adds, some households allow 10-year-olds to watch
R-rated movies and others don't allow 16-year-olds to do so. (And
we've heard of at least two 4-year-olds who received their own TVs
and VCRs for Christmas.)
</P>
<P>
   A lot of permissiveness happens today, Severe says, because
parents ``don't want their kids to not like them; they think
they've got to be their kids' friends. Those are mistakes in my
opinion. You are an authority figure. You always will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Hymowitz concurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't be a child's friend and be a parent,'' she says.
``The most important thing parents should be doing is bringing back
that bright line between adult and child. It's not to say you
shouldn't be close and loving, but the message that children should
be getting is that you're the one who knows the world best.''

KEEPING CANADA'S PUBLIC TV NETWORK PURELY CANADIAN
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 BY SUSAN CATTO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ If Canadians want to watch Hollywood movies on
television, they may have to switch the channel. Canada's
broadcasting regulators have told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.
to phase out foreign blockbusters by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Such attempts to defend Canadian culture from U.S. encroachment
are nothing new. This is a country that requires public and private
broadcasters to carry ``Canadian content,'' a country where Eric
Reguly, a columnist for The Globe and Mail here, predicted that
Jan. 10 _ the day America Online agreed to buy Time Warner _ would
``go down in history as the day the Canadian culture died.''
</P>
<P>
   What is new and hotly debated is the defiant stance taken by
Robert Rabinovitch, the CBC president. In a statement after the
Jan. 6 government report, Rabinovitch said he would resist efforts
``to transform CBC into the PBS of the north, with nothing but
elitist programming.'' With the regulator, Francoise Bertrand,
chairwoman of the Canadian Radio-Television and Communications
Commission, urging the CBC to become less commercial, and the CBC
maintaining that it needs advertising revenue to survive, an
institution known for uniting Canadians suddenly threatens to
divide them.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless the commission said the CBC needed to return to its
original mandate: programming that reflects Canada's diverse
cultures and contributes to its national identity. But the CBC said
that it had been crippled by years of budget cuts and eroding
market share and considered the commission demands ``fiscally
irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission maintains that it is following public opinion
gleaned from consultations and hearings held across the country.
``A lot of people were saying, `We don't see enough of ourselves
and not enough is produced in the regions,''' the CBC spokesman,
Denis Carmel, said about why CBC has been told to broadcast more
regional programming. But public consultations were held
exclusively in the regions, and the citizens of Toronto and
Montreal were not consulted.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's other demands _ no foreign movies, no
blockbusters and less coverage of all professional sports _ seem
contrary to viewers' tastes. For instance, national sports account
for about 40 percent of the CBC's advertising revenue and ``Hockey
Night in Canada'' is practically compulsory viewing in much of the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's elaborate formula to determine what qualifies
as a blockbuster makes no reference to quality: ``Schindler's
List'' is banned, and so is ``Dumb and Dumber.'' But the commission
says such entertainment is the province of Canada's private
television networks, Global Television and Canadian Television,
which have complained about losing bidding wars to the CBC, a
broadcaster with a purse full of taxpayer dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Rabinovitch says putting into place the Canadian
Radio-Television and Communications Commission's requirements would
cost more than $34 million in production because of the cost of
replacement shows and lost advertising revenue. Under Prime
Minister Jean Chretien, who makes no secret of his contempt for the
CBC, the taxpayer subsidy has been cut to $517 million from $690
million. The CBC raises $310 million in advertising revenue, most
of it from the very shows the Canadian Radio-Television and
Communications Commission wants to decrease or eliminate.
</P>
<P>
   The CBC is also losing advertising revenue to specialty
channels, which according to Nielsen Media Research accounted for
30 percent of Canadian viewing time in the fall, compared with the
CBC's 8 percent. The Canadian Radio-Television and Communications
Commission has licensed more than 40 specialty cable channels since
1982, and on Jan. 13 it announced plans to license at least 10
more.
</P>
<P>
   In its efforts to compete with private broadcasters, the CBC has
alienated some of its traditional supporters. ``The government
slashes a hundred million from the CBC's budget, then a hundred
million more, and no one complains except the interested parties,''
said Patrick Watson, president of the CBC from 1989 to 1994. ``Why
is there no constituency? Because they can't tell the CBC from what
everyone else is doing.'' Devotees of public broadcasting say that
the CBC should be a refuge for the high quality, nationalist
programming that private networks deem financially risky, like
amateur sports.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, it is often much cheaper to buy shows from the United
States than to produce or buy those made in Canada. Virtually all
the CBC's prime-time programming is Canadian-made, and private
networks schedule at least eight hours of Canadian programs in
prime time each week. Yet private networks are also permitted to
show highly lucrative American shows, simultaneously broadcasting
NBC's Thursday night lineup of ``Friends,'' ``Jesse'' and
``Frasier,'' for example, and replacing the American commercials
with advertisements for Canadian companies.
</P>
<P>
   But Canadians are no longer limited to radio stations that
devote a third of their time to Canadian artists because they can
connect to American radio via the Internet. Satellite dishes and
digital television allow Canadians to receive hundreds of channels
unlicensed by the Canadian authorities. Web sites like iCraveTV.com
(a Canadian company) bypass regulators altogether.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1999 the Canadian Radio-Television and Communications
Commission announced that it would not regulate the Internet, and
even avid defenders of Canadian content have admitted that cultural
legislation is unenforceable in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   With hundreds of television stations and millions of Web sites
to choose from, will the next generation of Canadians even notice
whether the CBC shows regional programming or a steady diet of
Hollywood fare? Supporters of public broadcasting say that a
distinctive, all-Canadian channel will be more important and
perhaps more in demand as giant corporations like AOL Time Warner
impose their version of culture on the world.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents maintain that if Canadian culture is to survive, it
must do so through excellence rather than through legislation or
subsidy.

we do see a lot more of it now,'' says Severe, author of ``How to
Behave So Your Children Will, Too!'' ``I call it the parent trap.
It begins when they're 2 or 3 years old, and we give in, and we
rationalize it: `Oh, well, it's just one more cookie.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Severe believes discipline is the key to avoiding permissiveness
and developing harmonious parent-child relationships. But
discipline is not the same as punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Discipline is everything we do for our kids to make them feel
responsible and accountable,'' he says. ``Punishment is a tool we
use occasionally to teach them (discipline).''
</P>
<P>
   And the greatest failing of parents when it comes to
disciplining children, Severe contends, is inconsistency: Saying no
to Brittany's request for a candy bar and then, when she's still
begging 15 minutes later, giving in; asking Justin to take out the
trash and then doing it yourself when, an hour later, the trash is
still sitting in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is the pattern you're establishing,'' Severe says,
reminding parents that, ``You can be firm but positive at the same
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Ennio Cipani, a professor of psychology at the California School
of Professional Psychology, works with children in foster families.
He sometimes suggests that these parents use point systems as
reinforcement for good behavior, such as placing marbles in a jar
``and trading them in for a special activity at the end of the
day,'' he says. ``Or when (kids) don't comply within a period of
time, taking marbles out.''
</P>
<P>
   Changing societal values and realities have confused things,
too. The way moms and dads did things 30 years ago, the goods and
services offered to children, and the range of acceptable behavior
from kids have all shifted significantly. Today's parents are left
with, at best, a fuzzy blueprint as to how to do their job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our society is very pluralistic in terms of its value system
today,'' Severe says. ``When I was a kid, no matter where I went to
play, the rules were pretty much the same. That made it easy for me
to learn right from wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he adds, some households allow 10-year-olds to watch
R-rated movies and others don't allow 16-year-olds to do so. (And
we've heard of at least two 4-year-olds who received their own TVs
and VCRs for Christmas.)
</P>
<P>
   A lot of permissiveness happens today, Severe says, because
parents ``don't want their kids to not like them; they think
they've got to be their kids' friends. Those are mistakes in my
opinion. You are an authority figure. You always will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Hymowitz concurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't be a child's friend and be a parent,'' she says.
``The most important thing parents should be doing is bringing back
that bright line between adult and child. It's not to say you
shouldn't be close and loving, but the message that children should
be getting is that you're the one who knows the world best.''

IF GRAMMAR WERE A HAMMER, SOME PEOPLE WOULD HAVE MANY SORE FINGERS

   Daughter: ``Me and Megan are going to the mall.''
</P>
<P>
   Mother: ``That's Megan and I.''
</P>
<P>
   Daughter: ``You coming, too?''
</P>
<P>
   Thus runs a hypothetical but entirely plausible exchange over
the proper use of pronouns. It easily could have been a problem
with subject-verb agreement or a misplaced modifier. English is a
tricky language.
</P>
<P>
   Language is the one thing that makes humankind unique among the
species on God's green earth. Well, language and souls. People have
them, although judging by the heinous actions committed by some of
them, you'd never know it.
</P>
<P>
   As much as some folks want to believe that their dogs, or
horses, or parakeets also have souls, they don't. That doesn't make
the animal any less worthy of respect and decent treatment. But
with apologies to the people at PETA, creatures with feathers, fur,
scales or gills are not our equals. Never have been, never will be.
But that is a topic for an entirely different day.
</P>
<P>
   Animals don't use language. At best, they use signals that
humans anthropomorphize into language because that's what people do
_ ascribe human characteristics to everything.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Mitchell, known in some circles as the Underground
Grammarian, talks about this tendency in an early chapter of his
book ``Less Than Words Can Say.'' Before Mitchell gets to his
rightfully indignant rant about the abysmal communication skills of
some people who should have learned better by the time they reached
adulthood _ bureaucrats and educators among them _ he writes about
the misplaced belief that animals communicate through language.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a zebra out on the edge of the herd sniffs a lion in the
tall grass, he does not say to himself in any fashion, `I had
better tell the others.' (Nor would you, for that matter.) He
simply does what is appropriate for a successful zebra to do under
those circumstance. His startled neighbors, startled by what he
does whether they sniff the lion or not, do likewise. That's part
of how they got to be grown-up zebras in the first place. The
zebras who are slow to startle have a way of dropping out of the
herd early in life.''
</P>
<P>
   Why this talk of zebras and lions lurking in tall African
grasses when I started out talking about teens at the mall? It's a
metaphor for children whose lives don't amount to much more than
being one of the herd at the mall because they don't learn how to
properly and precisely communicate.
</P>
<P>
   Street language, bad grammar, horrible spelling, slang _ people
can generally get their messages across in this world even if they
exhibit all these foibles. But the harsh reality is that they
generally don't get very far in life.
</P>
<P>
   It is important for schoolchildren to learn the admittedly
difficult lessons of dangling participles and misplaced modifiers
and subject-verb agreement because those are the rules of
communication in a successful society. Mastery of language
differentiates the leaders from the rest of the herd.
</P>
<P>
   Proper language use means learning the rules of the game.
Mitchell provides an analogy that even the most addle-brained
sports nut could understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no Rule in Heaven that language has to be logical,
orderly, and coherent any more than there is some Law of Nature
that requires football players to stay within the lines. You can
grab a football and run to Oshkosh anytime you please; you just
won't be playing football.''
</P>
<P>
   You can speak in garbled syntaxes and muddled tenses any time
you please; you just won't be communicating effectively.
</P>
<P>
   So what's the ultimate goal of teaching children to speak and
write correctly? One of them, Mitchell suggests, is a social goal
``not much different from what we have in mind when we teach them
to use knives and forks at the table.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Children who grow up without having learned to use knives and
forks at the table may be charming and valuable human beings, but
they will often be passed over for promotion. Furthermore, it seems
unlikely that only that portion of their rearing could have been
neglected. When you have lunch with a man who eats his lasagna with
his fingers, you have reason to suspect that he may have one or two
other social deficiencies.''
</P>
<P>
   Being able to use language makes you human. Being able to use
language well makes you a human with a future.

 &HT;    Urban Media building hub inAtlanta
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A Silicon Valley startup that offers free high-speed
Internet access is building its national operations hub in Atlanta
and plans to hire at least 100 people.
</P>
<P>
   The company is called Urban Media and struck deals with a
handful of real estate developers and property managers to wire
area office buildings with its fiber optic cable.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the buildings the company has signed up so far are in
the Cumberland and Galleria Mall area of Northwest Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Urban Media, based in Palo Alto, is financing its expansion
beyond San Francisco with $25 million in new venture capital. It
was raised from Softbank Venture Capital and Accel Partners.
</P>
<P>
   In part, those funds will help finance a roll out across eight
cities, including metro Atlanta. The company has already hired 30
people to staff a national operation hub at 200 North Point Center
East.
</P>
<P>
   Urban Media chose Atlanta as a hub for two reasons. For one, it
has a great pool of telecommunications engineers. ``We can recruit
for our hub from these companies,'' says Mark Davis, Urban Media's
vice president for engineering.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Atlanta is a great market, with not only lots of small
businesses but businesses that are savvy about the new
telecommunications technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should be a good growth market for us,'' says Sean
Doherty, Urban Media's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Doherty is among the founders of Urban Media, and also helped
start West Coast consumer Internet provider, Excite At Home.
</P>
<P>
   Urban Media's business plan is simple. It offers businesses in
Cumberland office park high-speed Internet access. And the access
is the carrot the company uses to help sell other digital services.
</P>
<P>
   ``The advantage we offer is quicker connectivity to the
Internet,'' says Urban Media spokesman Phil Hughes. ``We're plug
and play.''
</P>
<P>
   With its free Internet service users also get a Urban Media
branded toolbar on their computers. The toolbar will also
eventually feature icons that, when clicked on, will jump to other
Internet services.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Urban Media has struck a deal with dot com
Beyond.com, which offers software for sale to companies. Urban
Media will enable quick download of Beyond.com software to users
through its high-speed network and take a cut of the sale.

EMPLOYEE NOT BEING FAIR TO SELF

<P>
   Q --I am a new employee with this company, and I have been given
no training. When I have questions about how to do my job, my
supervisor ignores me and my co-workers are too busy. I'm making
mistakes already, and I don't know where to turn. Can you help?
K.E.
</P>
<P>
   A -- If you entered this position with the clear understanding
that you are going to be provided with some training by your
supervisor or colleagues, only to find that such training is
nonexistent, then it is quite likely that many other components of
effective management are also nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you were hired because of your expertise, along with an
expectation that you needed minimal training, there still is a need
for someone in management to meet with you to review the company's
standards and procedures for your position. By ignoring all of your
requests, your supervisor also is ignoring the actual and potential
costs of having an employee who is either minimally productive or
making substantial errors.
</P>
<P>
   If you truly want to keep this job, you should approach your
supervisor when he or she is not particularly busy and ask for some
help. Be clear and concise in describing the specific areas in
which you need guidance. You should take a similar approach with
your fellow employees, and even with human resources or senior
management if necessary. You work for a company that essentially
expects you to sink or swim on your own, but you should give it a
little more time before deciding to jump ship.
</P>
<P>
   Q -- I just graduated from college with a management degree and
will be looking for a job shortly. I completed an internship over
the last five months but left the company on bad terms. I gained a
lot of knowledge and experience from the internship, and it is a
great addition to my resume. I know that I won't be able to have
references from anyone except another intern. Should I still
include this internship on my resume? R.B.
</P>
<P>
   A -- Just because your internship ran aground does not mean you
should delete it from your resume. A resume is supposed to be a
truthful summary of your prior work experience, and employers do
not appreciate fictionalized accounts. In fact, if you are hired
and the company later finds you presented false information during
the hiring process, you are likely to be terminated.
</P>
<P>
   The internship is a great addition to your resume. If you cut
it, you are also cutting your marketability to a potential
employer. When the subject of this internship comes up during the
interview, tell the interviewer exactly what happened. That way,
you can prepare him for a less-than-glowing reference, and its
impact will be lessened because you will have established a more
positive framework in which it can be interpreted.
</P>
<P>
   Several studies have found that admitting prior job problems is
often interpreted by interviewers as a sign of confidence. Showing
confidence makes more sense than trying to con the interviewer.
</P>
<P>
   Q -- We have a skilled employee who keeps complaining that she
is not being treated fairly. We have asked her for examples, and
she presents nothing but contrived instances that do not point to
unfair treatment at all. We have looked into the matter seriously
and believe that she is wrong, but she won't let up. We don't know
how to deal with her. What can you suggest? P.D.
</P>
<P>
   A -- When employees complain about issues of fairness, it is
only fair to investigate such claims thoroughly and promptly. If
you have truly found that they are unfounded, the next step is to
provide the employee with clear and factual feedback on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to fairness, she needs to see that she is being
unfair to herself. By focusing on perceived issues of inequitable
treatment, she is interfering with her own productivity,
credibility and effectiveness. This behavior will actually limit
her opportunities for growth, achievement, recognition and
advancement.
</P>
<P>
   It is important for her to understand that you are interested in
correcting instances of unfairness where they exist, and you are
still interested in her input on this matter. She also needs to see
that somewhere along the way, she lost sight of some of her job
priorities, and now it is time for her to focus on getting the job
done. If unfounded matters continue to distract her, she should be
advised that such behavior is not fair to the department and will
subject her to serious consequences.

MILES OF SMILES: GROUP HITS THE ROAD TO GIVE FREE DENTAL CARE TO
CHILDREN IN SOUTH TEXAS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JAMES PINKERTON 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COMBES, Texas _ The gleaming 35-foot motor home parked next to
Dishman Elementary is becoming a familiar sight at schools in the
Rio Grande Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before classes began one Wednesday, the motor coach
pulled up to the school building and 79 students were escorted by
the school nurse into an on-board, state-of-the-art dental clinic.
</P>
<P>
   For many poor children in South Texas, these visits were their
first encounter with a dentist. One girl, age 9, had extensive
tooth pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The child was in need of a number of root canals, four
extractions, 10 or 12 fillings,'' said Dr. Glenn Thomason, a
Harlingen dentist working in the mobile clinic that day. ``She was
in pain, all four (teeth) were hurting.''
</P>
<P>
   The $250,000 motor home is operated by Dentists Who Care Inc., a
nonprofit volunteer group started by private Valley dentists three
years ago. Their voucher program for free visits to dentist's
offices, called ``Valley Smiles coupons,'' has provided $240,000
worth of dental care to local children during the past school year,
the group says.
</P>
<P>
   Since October, the dentists have hit the road in the mobile
dental lab and examined more than 800 children in Cameron County.
Three and sometimes four days a week, dental clinics are held at
schools in rural areas and small towns where dental care is not
available.
</P>
<P>
   So far, more than 100 Valley dentists have volunteered to spend
up to three days a year staffing the mobile clinic. They plan to
take it to some of the Valley's hundreds of neighborhoods of
substandard housing, known as ``colonias,'' this summer while the
children are out of school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dentists Who Care was formed because there was a huge number
of poor children who weren't being served. The federal government
wasn't serving them, the state wasn't serving them, they had no
dental care,'' said Dr. David Woolweaver, a Harlingen dentist who
directs the program. ``If they show up in a dental office with an
emergency, what are we supposed to do, let them die? So our
dentists were treating them anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Valley dentists have turned out in large numbers _ 104 of the
135 members of the four-county dental society have signed up _ to
close the gap with free dental care for children, said executive
director John Guevara.
</P>
<P>
   Woolweaver said the mobile unit is the latest tool in what the
dentists say is a comprehensive approach to delivering dental care
to poor children whose parents cannot afford health insurance and
who do not qualify for federally funded Medicaid &UR; . &LR;
</P>
<P>
   According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,
there are 138,910 children in the Valley on Medicaid and more than
100,000 children who are uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Valley, ... there are many, many children who fall
through the cracks,'' Woolweaver said.
</P>
<P>
   Many are the children of the working poor or new immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``For whatever reason, they don't qualify for Medicaid.
Sometimes, even though Mom and Dad have minimum-wage jobs they make
more than the (qualifying) guidelines,'' Woolweaver said. ``Or they
might have someone who is undocumented in the family, and there is
a fear on the part of folks who don't have documents that if they
start registering for services someone will find them and deport
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The mobile unit visited Dishman Elementary because the school,
north of Harlingen in the rural community of Combes, has a high
percentage of students from poor families.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 79 fourth- and fifth-grade students had experiences
similar to Joshua Rodriguez, a 9-year-old who emerged from the
mobile unit with a smile on his face and a handful of colorful
stickers promoting dental hygiene.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a little bit OK. I had some cavities,'' he said, adding
that the motor home was ``cool.''
</P>
<P>
   In a matter of minutes Wednesday morning, the fourth-grader's
teeth had been X-rayed and a complete dental exam performed by
Thomason. Before school let out, Joshua's dental health was
outlined in a report he could take home to his parents, and another
with recommendations will be mailed home.
</P>
<P>
   If the boy's family can't afford a dentist to fill the cavities,
the school nurse can provide him with a Valley Smiles coupon for
free dental care in one of the dentist's offices, Thomason said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the majority of the 79 students had received dental
care in the past, 25 had no dentists, including five with major
problems requiring immediate attention, Thomason said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So it's encouraging to us when we come out in the communities
like this and see that a lot of them are getting treatment, but
there are still a few who are falling between the cracks and that's
really where we're trying to focus,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the girl who needed root canals, by the end of
the day a Harlingen specialist with Dentists Who Care scheduled
free treatment at his office the following week. Thomason agreed to
provide free care for the four other students who had serious
dental complications.
</P>
<P>
   School nurses at Valley school districts who send students to
Dentists Who Care say the group offers a new option for students
with dental problems and no place to go.
</P>
<P>
   And in an area where a large percentage of the population lives
in poverty, dental care is often considered a luxury by families
struggling to make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kind of goes with the area, because parents are concerned
with having a roof over their children's heads and food on the
table,'' explained Ana Milan, head of nursing services for the
Brownsville public schools. ``And if a child is walking and acting
normal, they don't worry too much.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest Census Bureau figures estimate the poverty rate
ranges from 40 percent to 52 percent in the four counties that make
up the lower Rio Grande Valley _ nearly 373,000 residents living in
poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment in the Valley remains the highest in Texas,
although it has fallen recently to its lowest point in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Brownsville, the largest city in the region, has a school
district with 40,200 students including thousands who need dental
care, Milan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be safe in saying that at least 50 percent of our kids
need dental care. They don't see a dentist on a regular basis and
that would be a very conservative estimate,'' Milan said. ``We
don't have any figures to denote that, but I know we can go into
any school and find kids who need dental care.''
</P>
<P>
   Milan said 15 Brownsville dentists currently volunteer for the
Valley Smiles coupon program, and each one donates three to five
coupons a month so school nurses can send students for free
treatment at their offices. Since the Brownsville school district
began using Dentists Who Care in January 1998, Milan estimated that
200 to 230 students have used the vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love it. The students are being taken care of, the parents
are happy, and we are happy to find a way to access'' dental care,
Milan said.
</P>
<P>
   But the volunteer effort does have its critics, including those
who believe the dentists should donate their services at the
various publicly supported community health centers across the
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are good brick-and-mortar facilities that the federal
government has invested millions (of tax dollars) in, and if
dentists volunteered their time there each month we wouldn't need a
$250,000 mobile unit,'' said one Valley dentist, who asked not to
be identified.
</P>
<P>
   He characterized Dentists Who Care as a public relations effort
to blunt criticism of the Valley dental community after it
successfully halted a plan to bring a dental residency program to
Harlingen in 1995. Dentists opposed the program because it would
have treated paying customers while serving indigent clients.
</P>
<P>
   But Woolweaver said government solutions to local health-care
problems rarely succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This program is a multi-dimensional approach to solving a
health-care problem. Seldom, if ever, does government, whether it's
federal or state, ever approach a problem in the manner we've
approached it, and the reason is because we're the ones who deliver
health care,'' Woolweaver said.
</P>
<P>
   Woolweaver said the mobile dental unit also sidesteps the
problem of getting people to health clinics. Many of the working
poor, he said, have only one vehicle and public transportation does
not extend into rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brick and mortar clinics are well-intentioned, but they can
only supply treatment to a confined area,'' he said.
``Transportation is the No. 1 problem that an indigent suffers
from. So how do they get from here to this fixed-base clinic?''

   NORTH RICHLAND HILLS, Texas _ A drug raid and fatal shooting at
the home of a true-crime author in this Fort Worth suburb have
combined to reveal a set of circumstances stranger than any book
the author may have penned.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as facts of the case begin to surface, a long-simmering
family feud, replete with accusations of murder and intrigue, has
come to light.
</P>
<P>
   The raid occurred Dec. 15 at the home of Barbara Davis, 50,
author of several books, including ``Precious Angels,'' an
accounting of the 1997 Darlie Routier capital murder trial.
</P>
<P>
   Around midmorning on that date, 17 police officers armed with a
``no-knock'' warrant based on a statement from an informer
converged on the Davis home, broke down the door and confronted
Troy James Davis, the author's 25-year-old son, as he was preparing
breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Police said their informant had described Troy Davis as a
dangerous person who was growing a ``substantial'' amount of
marijuana in the home and often answered the door armed with a
pistol loaded with Teflon-coated bullets.
</P>
<P>
   When the officers broke down the door to the home, they said,
Troy Davis pointed a 9mm pistol at them and North Richland Hills
Patrolman Allen Hill shot Davis twice with a .45-caliber automatic,
wounding him fatally.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Davis, who was asleep in a back bedroom when the raid
began, was arrested and charged with possession of three, small
marijuana plants, found in a garden behind the home, and several
ounces of GHB (a so-called ``date rape'' drug).
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Davis, freed on bond, denied the accusations, saying she
had no knowledge of the marijuana and had legally purchased the GHB
as a treatment for insomnia before it became illegal in November.
</P>
<P>
   She subsequently filed a wrongful death suit against the city
and its police department, Hill was put on paid leave pending an
investigation and city officials quickly began withholding comment
on the incident.
</P>
<P>
   And the public airing of the story might have ended there, had
it not been for Davis' involvement in the Routier case. That case,
in which Darlie Routier was accused of the murder of her two young
sons in Rowlett and eventually convicted, was surrounded by strange
circumstance, though no more bizarre than those surrounding Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Davis already had a small following based on her books. Her
first work dealt with a stalking case and was moderately
successful. Her second, on the Routier case, took the position that
Routier was guilty and had only begun to sell &UR;  &LR; when Davis had a
change of heart.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Davis renounced her own book, became a staunch
apologist for Routier and began appearing on television and radio
talk shows, appealing for a new trial for Routier. She said
evidence she was unaware of during the trial had convinced her that
Routier was innocent. She said she had vowed to devote herself to
Routier's acquittal, had turned down other book contracts, taken a
job in a hospital and was living on a restricted budget until
Routier could be freed.
</P>
<P>
   And that move brought her more ardent fans than had any of her
books.
</P>
<P>
   Davis became the darling of Routier supporters, many of whom are
organized around a Web site for Darlie Routier. When the police
raid occurred at the Davis home, those supporters began
speculating, in private and in ``chat rooms'' on the Internet, that
Davis was the target of police efforts to discredit her.
</P>
<P>
   Part of this discussion revolved around threatening e-mail
messages that Davis had received just before the raid. One of
those, referring to her tight budget, advised her that ``if you're
so strapped for cash, why don't you sell some of that marijuana you
have growing in the back bedroom.''
</P>
<P>
   That message fueled speculation that Davis had been targeted,
even framed, and self-styled ``Web sleuths'' began attempting to
track its origin. They correctly traced it to Waxahachie and
incorrectly identified its origin as the Waxahachie Police
Department, and, specifically, Police Chief Allwin Barrow.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors then began circulating that Barrow had sent the message.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an unbelievable mix-up and it uncovered a bizarre set
of circumstances,'' said Barrow, who did not know Barbara Davis.
Barrow's department began its own investigation and traced the
message to a Waxahachie woman, a sister-in-law of Barbara's
husband, James Davis. James Davis died of heart failure in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the woman, who refused comment when contacted last
week, admitted sending the message. Then, she and other Davis
family members told investigators they suspected Barbara Davis of
poisoning her husband, causing him to have a fatal heart attack in
September 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, investigators learned that the informant whose
statements led North Richland Hills police to the Davis home was
none other than Davis' nephew.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Davis of Fort Worth, Barbara Davis' brother-in-law, said
animosity toward the author stemmed, in part, from a Sept. 23,
1982, shooting in which Barbara Davis wounded her late husband
outside a convenience store in North Richland Hills.

AN EXHIBIT PAYS TRIBUTE TO ILLUMINATING _ AND SEXY _ ORCHIDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Science Times)  (DW)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Several years ago, while staying at a half-built research
station in the middle of a remote tropical rain forest in Ecuador,
I became desperate to have something other than boiled river water
to drink. Wondering whether I was within driving distance of
anything like a soda, I went searching for the man who would know,
a gruff, musclebound Ecuadorean who was in charge and was, with his
own two hands, fighting back the rain forest to build the station.
</P>
<P>
   I expected to find this man _ who was always intimidatingly
sweaty and shirtless _ in a spartan cabin on grounds littered with
power tools, scornful of my frivolous inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, I found him at home in a garden that could only be
called enchanting, filled with wild orchids that he had carefully
collected from the rain forest. The orchids were all epiphytes, or
air plants, which live on top of plants, that he had taken from the
trunks and branches of plants in the jungle to clothe every tree
surrounding his house.
</P>
<P>
   Like so many orchid fanciers before him, he had become addicted,
unable to resist these flowers, full of fragrance and dressed in
fantastically sculptured petals, to the point where he was
constantly in search of more of the distractingly beautiful
species. Even this man, whose job was to tear down the endless
green jungle to make way for science, had fallen hopelessly in love
with its most alluring offering.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the inspirational power of the orchid. (He also helped
me find a soda and for the happy memory of both these I am still
grateful.)
</P>
<P>
   The gorgeous excesses of the world's 25,000 wild orchid species
_ which inhabit an impossible variety of shapes as diverse as
bursting stars, ladies slippers and gaping maws _ have long
inspired extremes of devotion, from the so-called orchid delirium
of England's Victorian age to today's overenthusiasts who cling to
cliffsides to get peeks at new species. Those seeking a simpler way
of seeing what ignites such passion can visit the sixth annual
orchid exhibition, which opened over the weekend at the Smithsonian
Institution in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But orchids have inspired much more than adoration. These same
extremes of shape also forever changed how scientists look at
flowers, sex and the evolution of life.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Joseph Hooker, a famous 19th century English botanist,
remarked that before Charles Darwin, botanists thought that flowers
existed ``in order to beautify the landscape.'' Darwin saw the
peculiarities of orchids in a completely new light, as devices,
honed and molded by natural selection for the purpose of promoting
sexual reproduction.
</P>
<P>
   After publishing his world-changing manuscript, ``On the Origin
of Species,'' Darwin chose as his next book a treatise, hundreds of
pages long, titled ``The Various Contrivances by Which Orchids Are
Fertilised by Insects.'' In it, he demystified the bizarre shapes
of orchids, showing how every twist and turn worked to manipulate
insects, often in nastily deceptive ways, into carrying pollen from
one flower to another, a plant's version of sexual reproduction.
</P>
<P>
   Darwin revealed the extraordinary lengths to which orchids would
go to have sex with other orchids, rather than simply fertilizing
themselves as many plants can do. For example, the flowers of
Catasetum plants are arranged as a kind of slingshot, set up to
fire off a giant wad of pollen covered with a quick-setting
adhesive at insects that land on the flower just so, setting off
the trigger. Other orchid flowers have evolved to look like female
bees of particular species, complete with fuzzy bodies, eyes and
wings. These flowers have evolved to arouse the passions of male
bees, which inadvertently pollinate the flowers as they engage in
hopeless attempts to copulate with the pretty petal.
</P>
<P>
   A study published last year in Nature showed that in one
species, these faux females give off a bouquet nearly identical to
the sex pheromones of real female bees, leaving lonely males unable
to resist their wiles.
</P>
<P>
   Still other orchid flowers are built as true traps into which
bees creep in search of food or drawn on by alluring fragrances,
only to get stuck in a room built of petals or to fall into a
bucket-shaped petal full of water. Unable to leave the way that
they came in, the bees eventually discover that the only exit is a
passageway that, when traveled, results in a packet or dab of
pollen being attached to them. Outfitted with its package, the bee
is allowed to go on its way.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael T. Ghiselin, historian of evolutionary biology at
the California Academy of Sciences, said Darwin's inspiration from
orchids on the areal functions of floral forms was so convincing
that it not only bolstered his theories on the powers of natural
selection but changed the thinking of the day on flowers to such a
degree that it spawned several new fields of study.
</P>
<P>
   The huge and still active field of pollination biology, as well
as the rapidly growing study of co-evolution, which is the
examination of how different species evolve together as enemies or
collaborators, both had their birth in Darwin's study of orchids.
</P>
<P>
   The same tome is said to have started scientists thinking about
the huge and hugely intriguing question: why is it that all
organisms, even those able to reproduce by themselves, like many
plants and some animals, go to such lengths to have sex with
others?
</P>
<P>
   Whether one appreciates orchids for the elaborations natural
selection has wrought upon them, or for their beauty, orchids have
made themselves worthy of their adoration by illuminating so much
about the workings of the green world around them. As Darwin
himself prophetically wrote of orchids 138 years ago, ``An
examination of their many beautiful contrivances will exalt the
whole vegetable kingdom.''

NORTH RICHLAND HILLS, Texas: North Richland Hills.

<P>
   The shooting reportedly resulted from a disagreement that began
at the couple's home. Barbara Davis had later driven to the
convenience store, followed by her husband, and shot him when he
approached her vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``She shot him several times and hit him in the stomach and left
leg,'' said Bob Davis. ``He spent a week in the hospital and
recovered and went right back to her.''
</P>
<P>
   James Davis never filed a criminal complaint over the shooting
and police apparently did not pursue the case. Barbara Davis, who
worked as a clerk for the Tarrant County District Attorney's Office
at the time and, later, for a district judge, subsequently had
police records of the case legally expunged.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital where James Davis recuperated has since closed.
</P>
<P>
   Davis family members and others, however, confirmed the
incident, and an entry in the diary of James Davis' father, the
late James Howard Davis Sr., refers to the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after James' death in 1995, Bob Davis said he and others
in the family began to suspect Barbara had caused his heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father (owner of a cemetery and funeral home) had left
quite a bit of money,'' said Bob Davis. ``My brother, Jim,
inherited around $300,000, but he put it in a mutual fund where she
(Barbara Davis) couldn't get it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, leading up to his death, Jim had three heart attacks,
all at 2 a.m. and that seemed strange and we began to wonder if
she'd given him something.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to the (Tarrant County) Sheriff's Department and talked
to an officer there about it, but we had no proof and he told me
she'd probably sue me if we had my brother's body exhumed and that
I'd best forget about it,'' said Bob Davis.
</P>
<P>
   After James Davis' death, animosity between his widow and his
family began to grow. About a year after her husband's death,
Barbara Davis had a cemetery monument erected for a man who had
died whom she identified as one of her husband's best friends. The
monument was erected near her husband's grave in the Davis family
plot.
</P>
<P>
   That angered members of the Davis family, who said they had
never heard of him and demanded Barbara Davis remove the marker.
She refused and Bob Davis eventually used a tractor to haul the
marble plaque away.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on Dec. 14, Chris Davis, Barbara Davis' nephew, told
police his aunt and cousin had been using drugs for years and
recently had begun preparing to grow marijuana and manufacture and
distribute GHB. He also said Troy Davis often answered the door,
armed with a pistol loaded with armor-piercing bullets.
</P>
<P>
   During the raid, police said that, in addition to the marijuana
and GHB, they found pamphlets on growing marijuana, a pamphlet
describing the manufacture of GHB, numerous weapons and a closet,
outfitted to grow marijuana with artificial light.
</P>
<P>
   Police conduct of the raid, however, has come into question.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Davis declined comment. Her civil attorney, Tom Carse,
however, confirmed the facts surrounding the threatening message,
the warrant and the family's suspicions about the death of James
Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just unbelievable,'' said Carse. ``That they (Davis'
relatives) could think that she did something like that with no
indication that it ever happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, the man died of a heart attack. It's on the death
certificate.''
</P>
<P>
   Carse also cited the record of Hill, the patrolman who shot Troy
Davis. North Richland Hills records show that Hill was suspended
without pay last June after it was learned that he had exposed
himself in group photos of the department's SWAT team taken during
training exercises at Fort Hood last November.
</P>
<P>
   A report on the incident states that ``during one of the
photographs, Officer Allen Hill exposed his genitalia without the
knowledge of the other tactical team members.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The act was committed in presence of mixed gender company,
however, the act should not have occurred whether female members
were present or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill also has a sexual harassment complaint from a female
officer pending against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It concerns me that the North Richland Hills Police Department
is aware of character flaws in an officer they put on the SWAT
team,'' said Carse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, they had a guy who didn't have the mental capacity to
observe normal codes of decency. The facts around this thing sound
like they belong to a bad fraternity prank,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As it is, they belong to a tragedy.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Supporters of campaign finance reform on Monday
hailed the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to allow states to limit
campaign contributions to political candidates as a way to deter
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   In a 6-3 decision, the justices reversed a federal appeals court
ruling that Missouri had violated free-speech rights when the state
capped individual contributions at $1,075 for candidates in state
elections. About two-thirds of the states impose campaign
contribution limits.
</P>
<P>
   Republican presidential candidate John McCain said the ruling
was ``marvelous.'' The Arizona senator has made campaign reform the
centerpiece of his bid for the GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Although focusing on a state law, the court's decision
implicitly affirmed a federal law that caps individual
contributions to federal candidates at $1,000 and is expected to
add energy to reformers who want tougher limits on federal election
finances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the Supreme Court has said what most Americans already
know: that contributions to federal candidates may certainly be
limited,'' said Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., who is pushing
legislation to reform campaign finance laws with McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain-Feingold bill would limit so-called ``soft-money'' or
contributions made to groups that spend money without any ties to
specific candidates. The measure stalled in the Senate last fall
but both sponsors are expected to renew their efforts this year to
win passage.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton called the decision a ``victory'' for
democracy. ``The American people know that our political system
needs to be fixed, and today's decision sets the stage for further
reform,'' the president said in a statement that also urged
Congress to pass campaign finance reform legislation this year.E.
Joshua Rosenkranz, president of the pro-reform Brennan Center for
Justice in New York City, said the ruling was ``a grand slam home
run reformers'' and that the decision said in ``no uncertain terms
that it is the province of the legislature, not the courts, to set
contribution limits.''Foes of campaign finance reform, who say the
ability of candidates to raise large amounts of money is a healthy
and essential part of the democratic process, decried the court's
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Foes of campaign finance reform attacked the decision.
</P>
<P>
   James Bopp, an Indiana lawyer who represents the National Right
to Life Committee, the National Rifle Association and other groups
challenging contribution limits, said restricting donations ``will
only serve to keep many people from raising the financial resources
needed to run for office.'' The high court's last ruling on
contribution limits came 25 years ago in the landmark case Buckley
vs. Valeo where the justices held that an individual candidate's
spending amounted to free speech and could not be limited. However,
in looking at the contribution side of campaigns, the court came up
with a slightly different rule. While campaign contributions also
amounted to free speech, they could be limited to $1,000 per
candidate for each election to avoid corruption or the ``perception
of corruption'' that could result from extraordinarily large
contributions by individual donors. The court ruled in the Buckley
case that contribution limits could not have a ``substantial effect
on a candidates ability to obtain funding,'' suggesting that they
might strike down limits if a ``substantial effect'' were shown.
</P>
<P>
   The Buckley case upheld a Watergate-era federal law that applied
only to federal elections. But on Monday, the high court said that
the Buckley decision applied to state laws as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hold Buckley to be authority for comparable state
regulations, which need not be pegged to Buckley's dollars,''
Justice David H. Souter wrote for the court. Chief Justice William
H. Rehnquist and Justices John Paul Stevens, Sandra Day O'Connor,
Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer joined Souter.
</P>
<P>
   Justices Clarence Thomas, Anthony M. Kennedy and Antonin Scalia
dissented.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court's decision has lasting consequences for political
speech in the course of elections, the speech upon which democracy
depends,'' Kennedy wrote in dissent. Thomas, writing for himself
and Scalia, said, ``Buckley was in error and I would overrule it.
`' He said ``Missouri's contribution limits are patently
unconstitutional.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (STORY COULD END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At issue in the Missouri case was a 1994 law that imposed a
$1,000 limit on contributions by an individual to a statewide
political candidate per election. A built-in inflation escalator
later raised the ceiling to $1,075.
</P>
<P>
   Zev David Fredman challenged the law in 1998 after losing a race
for the office of Missouri state auditor. Fredman argued that as a
first-time candidate with only a small number of supporters who
were willing to make contributions to his candidacy, his campaign
was unfairly hampered by $1,075 cap.
</P>
<P>
   Fredman and one of his supporters, a political-action committee
called Shrink Missouri Government PAC, filed suit in federal court
saying the law violated their First Amendment right to engage in
politics, a fundamental form of free speech.
</P>
<P>
   A district judge threw out the case, but the Eighth Circuit
Court of Appeals agreed with Fredman and the PAC, striking down
Missouri's campaign-contribution limits as violating the
Constitution. In its ruling, the appeals court said that Missouri
had not proved that larger donations corrupted state elections.
</P>
<P>
   But in rejecting that rationale Monday, Souter wrote that
Missouri was not responsible for showing that big donations caused
``actual'' corruption, only that these contributions caused the
``perception'' of corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is little reason to doubt that sometimes large
contributions will work actual corruption on our political system,
and no reason to question the existence of a corresponding
suspicion among voters,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Souter also said that Fredman's argument that the law hurt his
ability to run for office was not enough for the high court to
strike down the statute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even assuming that the contribution limits affected Fredman's
ability to wage a competitive campaign, a showing of one affected
individual does not point up a system of suppressed political
advocacy that would be unconstitutional under Buckley,'' he said.

VIVA LA FEMINISTA: WOMEN'S LIVES ARE SLOWLY IMPROVING IN MACHO
MEXICO 
</HEADLINE>

 RETRANSMITTING  
 
 By TANYA MIZRAHI  
 c.2000 Special for The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Not long ago, the Mexico City government tried to
make a switch. It called for a one-day experiment in which all
married women would exchange jobs with their husbands.
</P>
<P>
   On that day, husbands were asked to clean house, wash dishes, do
laundry and take care of kids.
</P>
<P>
   It's an idea that would have been unthinkable only a few years
ago, when Mexico's middle class was the confirmed center of
masculine privilege.
</P>
<P>
   But things are slowly changing in this homeland  &QL; 
of machismo.
</P>
<P>
   For example, beginning in August, 900 policemen in Mexico City
lost their authority to write traffic tickets. That authority was
given only to policewomen, who were deemed less corruptible by the
city's police chief.
</P>
<P>
   And consider some numbers: 50 percent of the people now
graduating from universities in Mexico are women, and half a dozen
women occupy high-ranking posts in Mexican governments, including
Rosario Robles, the first female mayor of Mexico City _ the biggest
city in the world _ and Rosario Green, Mexico's foreign relations
secretary.
</P>
<P>
   The changes perhaps were best summed up by Monica Almazan, a
policewoman patrolling the Condessa neighborhood: ``Finally, we
have the opportunity to show the men that we can take on a job
which is supposed to be for men only. We now have the chance to
prove ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Is feminism taking root in the hard soil of Mexican culture? The
answer is complicated because it depends on what kind of feminism
you mean. But it is accurate to say that a Mexican women's movement
is emerging on the American model, with women making some gains in
industry and government, while still blocked by institutional and
cultural barriers.
</P>
<P>
   But it's also true that the struggle for women's rights in
Mexico is nearly as old as the country itself. &QL; 
GROWING INDEPENDENCE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It can be seen today in the growing independence of
working-class women along the border, and in a National Women's
Commission that is confronting stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   Or in Mexico's efforts to improve family planning, because
unwanted teenage pregnancies are high and legal abortion is
restricted tightly.
</P>
<P>
   More women are entering legislative bodies and demanding more
laws to ban job discrimination and provide more money and health
care to women in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   And in pop culture, women are flocking to male strip shows that
feature some of the country's biggest soap-opera stars, prompting a
Catholic priest in Guanajuato to admonish on the radio, ``Rush to
confession!''
</P>
<P>
   The events, and the history behind them, defy outside notions of
a nation content with machismo.
</P>
<P>
   Among what loosely might be called the Spanish aristocracy of
Mexico and, in a vastly different way, among its peasants and
working women, Mexico has been a cradle of feminism for the entire
Western Hemisphere. &QL; 
FIRST FEMINIST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Mexicans and feminists everywhere celebrated the 300th
anniversary of the death in 1695 of Sor (Sister) Juana Ines
(EDITORS: ACCENT over ``E'' in InEs) de la Cruz, often acknowledged
as the ``first feminist of the Americas.''
</P>
<P>
   Sor Juana lived from 1651 to 1695 and now is regarded widely as
Mexico's greatest writer, akin to Shakespeare in the
English-speaking world. Her published works include more than 120
sonnets and ballads, many more short poems, three one-act dramas,
two comedies, more than two dozen prologues to plays and numerous
songs, carols and hymns.
</P>
<P>
   Her most popular work, however, is the poem that begins:
``Hombres necios que acusais (EDITORS: ACCENT MARK ove ``A'' in
acusAis) . . .'' _ ``You foolish men who accuse women . . .'' The
poem is memorized by literature students across Latin America
because it strikes at the heart of male attitudes toward women.
</P>
<P>
   But Sor Juana's best defense of women's role is found in a more
obscure work, a response to a bishop who had written a letter
attempting to silence her. (This work and the poem, ``Philosophical
Satire,'' are translated and edited by Electa Arenal and Amanda
Powell in ``The Answer/La Respuesta, Including a Selection of Poems
(by) Sor Juana Inez de la Cruz,'' City University of New York
Press).
</P>
<P>
   Still, Sor Juana was an aristocrat. More commonly, the tough
work for equality was performed by women who were literally in the
trenches, the ``soldaderas'' (soldiers), who included many officers
in their numbers and fought in the revolutionary armies of Pancho
Villa and Emiliano Zapata (their story has been preserved in a book
by Elizabeth Salas, ``Soldaderas: Mitos e Historia.''. Even today,
as soldiers in the largely Mayan independence movement in Chiapas
state, women take up arms, not least for the fact that Indian women
still may be sold into marriage for the equivalent of $400.
</P>
<P>
   Three decades after the revolution, there were women such as
Benita Galeana, a grass-roots leader who led the first squatter
land-takeovers in Mexico City in the Depression years of the 1930s.
She was arrested 60 times and almost lost her eyesight from hunger
strikes while fighting for Mexican women's suffrage, which was
finally won in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let the companera (TILDE OVER ``N'' in compaNera) in the
braids speak,'' was the cry in the 1930s when Benita Galeana would
come to address the crowds in Mexico City. &QL; 
 &QL; 
PRIMER FOR FEMINISTS
</P>
<P>
   In 1940, she wrote her autobiography, ``Benita,'' which became a
primer for the women's movement. Her book and her legacy were
rediscovered in the 1980s, when Mexican women formed a coalition to
fight for democracy and an end to violence against women.
</P>
<P>
   Benita Galeana was able to unite working- and middle-class women
for the first time despite profound philosophical differences
between the two groups concerning the role of men and class in the
struggle. But even she wasn't able to bring the movement to the
point that the Mexican government would identify its own interests
with those of the women's movement. That took nearly three
generations of factory women, the foot soldiers of a blue-collar
cultural insurgency in Tijuana that is slowly spreading from the
border south into the rest of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Prompted by economic crisis, the immigration to the United
States of male heads of household and the demand for female
employees at border factories, these women, like Rosie the Riveter
of World War II America, were the first to break en masse into
Mexico's male-dominated industrial workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Their relative autonomy, accelerated by liberal U.S. social
attitudes and economic benefits that have drifted across the
border, has granted working-class women an unusual degree of
domestic clout and social freedom, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The forces of progress are stirring themselves up much more
along the border,'' said Susan Tiano, a sociology professor at the
University of New Mexico and author of ``Patriarchy on the Line,''
a book on the effect of the ``maquiladoras'' on border gender
roles. ``Some amazing changes happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Women in Tijuana come and go as they please, working night
shifts and shopping at 24-hour supermarkets. Women hit the discos
on weekends, with or without male escorts. Some wear tight pants
and miniskirts. Unmarried mothers are not pariahs.
</P>
<P>
   There are serious social problems for women in the border
workplace. Low pay (the average wage is around 80 cents an hour,
and independent unions are discouraged), sexual harassment and
gender barriers to higher-paying jobs prevent factory women from
raising their status.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies, including a number of U.S.-owned factories and
border-region ``maquiladora'' manufacturing plants, force job
applicants to take pregnancy tests and will hire them only if the
exams are negative. And although women's role in the workforce has
doubled to 30 percent since 1980, female workers still earn 25
percent less than men in the same jobs, says Elena Azaola, a social
anthropologist.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is widely acknowledged that blue-collar women are
creating a new female archetype to reckon with in Mexican society,
and that has been lost neither on the government nor on
middle-class women.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, known by
its Spanish acronym PRI, and its standard-bearer, President Ernesto
Zedillo, taking note of the fact that 70 percent of Mexicans who
are illiterate are women, announced a new social-service program
aimed primarily at women and girls. &QL; 
LEGISLATIVE GAINS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Revolutionary Party, known by its Spanish acronym
PRD, which focused heavily on women's issues in the past
presidential campaign, has been contributing to the rise of women
in Mexico's legislative bodies.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1997 elections, the party doubled its number of female
deputies in the lower house to 30, giving it the largest percentage
of female elected officials of any of the three major parties
represented in the 500-seat Mexican parliament.
</P>
<P>
   All of these changes contributed to the creation of a National
Women's Commission, intended to confront double standards. In 1998,
it launched an American-style advertising campaign questioning
whether society could advance if comments such as these were
allowed to go unchallenged:
</P>
<P>
   ``She is the director. I wonder how she got there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband can do what he wants, because he is a man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are you pregnant? I told you to take care of yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, the campaign offered statements affirming a new
attitude:
</P>
<P>
   ``I am the director, and I did not sleep with anybody to get
here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't need to sleep around to be a man, and I also use
protection.''
</P>
<P>
   Machismo will not make for a smooth adjustment to any changes,
but some see change as inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mexican man idolizes women as `the Mother,' and he will
not tolerate her being contaminated,'' said Alejandro Radchik,
president of the Psychoanalytic Society in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a society where `la casa chica' _ the little house for
the mistress _ is common, not because the husband no longer loves
his wife but because, once she becomes the mother of his children,
sex becomes a dirty act that will contaminate her,'' Radchik said.
</P>
<P>
   `The Mother is her own worst enemy. She is the one educating her
sons, the Mexican men, to be macho and preparing her daughters to
be good mothers and housewives.''
</P>
<P>
   How about the future? Many women believe there is good reason to
hope. With women representing 53 percent of Mexican voters,
presidential candidates campaigning for what is hoped could be the
most competitive democratic election in Mexican history in July,
middle-class women could achieve a measure of political power _
eventually.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, (the Mexican man) will react by trying to belittle
her and by being condescending,'' Radchik said. ``When this
attitude does not lead to his desired effect, he will acquiesce to
this new feminine authority.'' &QL;

   Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule reviews of new books:
</P>
<P>
   ``A VAST CONSPIRACY'' &QL; 
By Jeffrey Toobin (Random House, $25.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Toobin's last book was about the O.J. Simpson trial. We've had a
hard time deciding whether he has come up in the world or plunged
to new depths by taking on this more recent tangle of thorns, the
Clinton sex scandal. In the end, of course, he has traded up _
there was no blood shed in the White House, merely a shedding of
judgment and esteem and familial accord. We spoke with Toobin after
the Simpson book was released, and he told us that as a lawyer he
was both horrified and fascinated by the trial, like a passing
motorist gaping at a terrible accident. This time, Toobin has
jumped out of his vehicle and is selling tickets, tour guide
extraordinaire. He covered the Clinton saga for ``The New Yorker,''
and he offers all the details, including Paula Jones' relentlessly
explicit descriptions of Clinton's flawed anatomy. And, of course,
we knew as we read it that we, like Toobin, were no longer just
driving by. We became part of the ghoulish scene. &QL; 
``AMERICAN FAN'' &QL; 
By Dennis Perrin (Spike, $23) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   errin offends just about everybody in this look at sports in
America, and it's great fun watching him do it. Christians take a
beating in the section about ``religious'' athletes. Radio
talk-show hosts are taken to task for being ``White, male,
heavyset, obsessive, egomaniacal, brusque,'' and only once removed
from the people who call them. Shaquille O'Neal, Nike and college
basketball coaches (with ``Nike bucks stuffed in their G-strings'')
come under scrutiny in a chapter on sports marketing. Even Mark
McGwire and Sammy Sosa suffer under Perrin's analysis of the home
run race, during which ``Big Mac was the All-American boy . . .
(and) Sosa the Dominican was made his comic sidekick: less Sancho
Panza (McGwire was no wayward Quixote), more a smiling Tonto to
McGwire's Lone Ranger.'' Women are left out altogether, and we
should be grateful. ``I deal almost exclusively with male sports
and male fans,'' Perrin writes, ``for the simple reason that this
is where the true lunacy lies.'' &QL; 
``THE COMFORTS OF HOME'' &QL; 
By Merritt Ierley (Potter, $30) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1799, the family of a Philadelphia woman named Elizabeth
Drinker purchased a ``shower bath'' _ a framework holding a
container of water that would fall on a bather's head when she
pulled a cord. It was an odd luxury. ``I bore it better than I
expected,'' Elizabeth wrote in her diary, ``not having been wett
(SIC, CORRECT) all over att (SIC, CORRECT) once for twenty-eight
years past.'' When Thomas Jefferson moved into the White House in
1801, there was only a privy out back. Jefferson, who had witnessed
innovations in modern convenience in France, requested that a water
closet be installed (it was, but not until 1804, leaving Jefferson
to suffer in the privy for three long years). Ierley charts the
evolution of comfort and convenience in the American home,
beginning with the turn of the 19th century; jumping to 1860,
before the mass-production spurred by the Civil War; and ending
with 1920s to the present, with America on the cutting edge of
household convenience. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``JAMES JOYCE'' &QL; 
By Edna O'Brien (Viking, $19.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of all its great writers, James Joyce's relationship with
Ireland is the most contradictory. ``He determined to reinvent the
city where he had been marginalized, laughed at and barred from
literary circles,'' O'Brien writes. ``He would be the poet of his
race. In one of his early verses he likened himself to a stag,
antlers charging upon the land.'' That sets the tone for this
wonderful volume from the ``Penguin Lives'' series of short
biographies. O'Brien reveals Joyce's tumultuous ties to his mother,
who bore 16 children, and to the Catholic Church; his sexual
appetite for Nora Barnacle, the common girl from Galway who would
be his wife (and who would never read beyond the first pages of
Ulysses; his attractions to other women; his struggle to find
acceptance for his work; and his self-absorption and eccentricity.
``He was a tragic man with a staggering genius for whom humor was a
weapon,'' O'Brien says. Or, as another writer put it, he was ``a
Dante who had lost the key to his own inferno.'' &QL;

`MILLIONAIRE' QUIETLY BREAKS TV'S BARRIERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash.)  (js) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ On Sunday night a contestant on ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire'' embraced his gay companion onstage after winning
$500,000. The audience cheered, Regis Philbin, the host, grinned,
and the network was not flooded with protest calls.
</P>
<P>
   In its own quirky way, the quiz show, which is a ratings
juggernaut and the No. 1 show in the nation, has quietly and quite
nonchalantly broken sexual and racial barriers on television. Not
only do gay couples routinely appear on the show _ the word ``gay''
is never used _ but so do racially mixed couples, which in the past
television has often avoided showing.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, the matter-of-fact presentation of these
couples, without a comment from Philbin or anyone else, has altered
the television landscape. The show, on ABC three nights a week, has
an average audience of 28.5 million viewers and has single-handedly
revived the network.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night's show stirred nervousness among the
``Millionaire'' staff members because it was the first time in
memory that two men _ a contestant and his companion in the
audience _ embraced before television cameras. The contestant was
Rob Coughlin of Shoreline, Wash., who works for a transit company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We treat everyone the same way, and there's never been an
issue about people's personal relationships,'' said Michael Davies,
executive producer of the show. ``If a contestant is married 25
years and white and middle-class with 2.4 kids and brings his wife
to the show, that's fine. Or whether somebody brings their college
buddy or mother or sister or lover, we don't care. We don't care
about ethnic things, we don't care about sexual things. We treat
everybody the same. The show broadly reflects society.''
</P>
<P>
   Davies admitted that he had been a bit anxious about Sunday
night's show, which was taped late last week. When contestants win
$250,000 or more, their partners, who until then are shown sitting
and cheering them on, are taken onstage.
</P>
<P>
   While sitcoms and dramas about racially mixed couples are rare,
there have been some comedies involving gay characters. Billy
Crystal played a gay man as far back as 1977 in the ABC series
``Soap,'' which was a satire on soap operas. Even before the show
was broadcast, ABC received about 32,000 letters protesting it, and
some network affiliates were picketed because of the show's sexual
content. The uproar died down, and the series lasted four years.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the highly publicized decision by Ellen DeGeneres
to announce that she was a lesbian, her show, ``Ellen,'' started to
fade. At the time network executives said that was in part because
the show was aging and also because it had lost its sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   The NBC sitcom ``Will and Grace,'' about a gay man and a
straight woman living together, is one of the most successful shows
on television. Max Mutchnick, who created the series with David
Kohan, said he was surprised that there were no network ``stop
signs'' for the series' writers. In fact, he said, the creators and
writers can go quite far in terms of subject matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no flags, no one's underlining it or remarking on
it,'' Mutchnick said. ``It's been put on its feet and being filmed,
and it's going out on the air and no one's saying anything about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mutchnick said it was a far cry from the NBC sitcom ``Love,
Sidney,'' from 1981 to 1983, in which Tony Randall played a gay
commercial artist. But his sexuality was inferred, never mentioned.
``He was only shy,'' said Mutchnick with a laugh. ``He went to shy
bars.''
</P>
<P>
   Earle Marsh, co-author of The Complete Directory to Prime Time
Network and Cable TV Shows (Ballantine Books), said he could recall
no previous quiz show in which either gay or multiracial couples
were so evident. ``Twenty years ago there would have been serious
problems with network standards and practices, the censors,'' he
said. ``They might have worried about segments of the audience
being homophobic or have other problems.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure at one point the choice of people to go on the air
might have raised red flags,'' Marsh said. ``In today's environment
we've moved beyond that.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He pointed out that interracial couples, while rare on
television, are not unique. In ``The Jeffersons,'' Norman Lear's
spinoff about Archie Bunker's former black neighbors, the son is
married to a mixed-race woman. Her black mother and white father
were also neighbors. ``It was groundbreaking,'' said Marsh.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Millionaire,'' Philbin introduced Coughlin's companion,
Mark Leahy, as soon as the contestant walked onstage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your partner, Mark, is in the audience, hey, Mark,'' said
Philbin as the audience cheered.
</P>
<P>
   As Coughlin began answering questions correctly, Philbin asked
Leahy what his partner should do if he won $1 million. ``Get a new
wardrobe,'' replied Leahy.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Coughlin reached $500,000, he was stumped by the
million-dollar question: In what country are all the United States'
major league baseballs manufactured? (The correct answer was Costa
Rica.) Instead of risking the loss of most of the money to go for
$1 million, Coughlin decided to halt the questioning and walk off
with $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Philbin said, ``Hey, Mark, come down.''
</P>
<P>
   Leahy bounded onto the stage and hugged Coughlin. ``Hey, Mark,
nice to see you,'' Philbin said.
</P>
<P>
   ABC executives said there was no reaction from viewers to the
episode.
</P>
<P>
   Davies said there had been other gay contestants with their
companions sitting in the audience and introduced by Philbin. ``The
first time there were definitely some raised eyebrows by some
members of my team,'' Davies said. ``I said to Regis, `Just refer
to his partner in the audience.' And that was it.''
</P>
<P>
   To be a contestant on ``Millionaire'' people apply by calling
(800) 433-8321 from 6 p.m. to 2 a.m. EST until Feb. 9. To qualify,
they have to be 18 and over and a U.S. citizen. An elimination
process follows, based on responses to questions as well as a
random drawing. No personal questions are asked. About 240,000
people call daily.
</P>
<P>
   Davies said that what concerned him was that contestants were
not a cross section of the nation. ``We do not have enough minority
contestants, we do not have enough female contestants and this
bothers me,'' he said. ``I don't know what the reason is. There may
be something about trivia and the amassing of knowledge of trivia
that's essentially white and male. It really bothers me that we
can't get more female and minority contestants.''
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd Braun, co-chairman of the ABC Entertainment Group, said
the show's potpourri of contestants was in some ways a
breakthrough. ``It's the most color-blind inclusive show you can
ever have,'' said Braun. ``It's fantastic that nothing's been made
of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Braun said that each contestant on the show was actually a
``slice-of-life, a mini-drama.'' ``You get to not only meet the
contestant when he or she is in the hot seat, but you meet their
spouse or partner or 100-year-old grandmother,'' he said. ``It's
not judgmental. It's totally accepting.''

SUPPLY OF CONES FOR ICE CREAM TAKES DIP  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JASON HALL   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARASOTA, Fla. _ Call it the great ice cream cone crunch.
</P>
<P>
   A Wisconsin cone company's bankruptcy means the nation's supply
of ice cream cones of all shapes, sizes and textures could reach
dangerously low levels before the summer surge hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may sound funny to some people, but it's not to me,''
said Dan Shaul, owner of Commissary Supply of Sarasota, sweeping
his hand around his 8,000-square-foot warehouse. ``In six months,
there might not be a cone in this place. For us, it's our life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like walking into McDonald's, and they say, `Sorry, we
don't have buns for your hamburgers.'''
</P>
<P>
   The continent's dominant cone producer, Ace Baking Co.,
announced three weeks ago that it was shutting down its cone
operations. Ace produced about 1.3 million of about 3 million ice
cream cones made in North America last year. On Dec. 27, the
company abruptly announced that it could not pay its bills and was
shutting down its five cone-producing plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew they were losing money and would eventually go out of
business, but we thought it would happen gradually,'' said Joe
George, president and CEO of Joy Cone Co., now the nation's biggest
cone baker. ``But it was, `Boom!' They just closed. This year,
there's just not going to be enough cones. We're running full
blast, and we can't make up for that kind of shortfall.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for consumers, the shortage of cones means higher
prices. Two weeks ago, Shaul paid $36 for a case of 800 sugar cones
from Joy Cone, his main supplier. Today, he'd pay $46.50.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is unheard of,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to Ace's headquarters in Green Bay, Wis., were not
returned.
</P>
<P>
   George said prices would eventually settle. ``We're going to be
very careful,'' George said. ``We don't want to give the impression
that we're trying to gouge the market, because we're not.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Vogler, owner of the four Baskin-Robbins outlets in
Bradenton, said his customers would not see a jump in prices
because he did not expect anything but a temporary shortage.
Baskin-Robbins commands enough attention in the industry that it
will get cones even when they are scarce, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Vogler is confused by the whole episode anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ice cream cones are not exactly a volatile market, are they?''
he said. ``I don't really get it.''

AILING PIERCE WON'T BE ABLE TO SWING IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Paul Pierce did some light shooting Monday. He wants to
do more, a lot more, but once again his body won't allow him.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the ankle anymore. It's his left hamstring. He still
was feeling pain Monday, and Celtics coach Rick Pitino ruled him
out of tonight's game against the Heat and possibly Wednesday
night's game in Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know we play our best basketball with him in the lineup,''
Pitino said. ``But we can't use that as an excuse anymore. Time is
running out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics actually play their worst basketball without Pierce
in the lineup. They are 1-10 the last two seasons in games in which
Pierce either was hindered by an injury or missed outright. (That
number has to be qualified somewhat; eight of the games were on the
road.) The record is 1-7 this season, the only victory coming in
the pre-Christmas mauling of Atlanta at the FleetCenter. When he
does suit up and makes it through a game unscathed, the Celtics are
18-14.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce hurt his hamstring going for a loose ball in the first
quarter of Saturday night's loss in Charlotte. He was just getting
over a bad ankle sprain, which caused him to miss six games in
mid-December. He took it easy and iced the hamstring Sunday, and
said the rest and treatment substantially helped.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels a lot better than it did,'' he said following the
team's workout at the University of Miami. ``I've never had an
injury like this, so I don't know the extent of it, how long I'll
be out. It's a sharp pain in my thigh. If I really stretch it out,
it hurts. And when I bend over, I can really feel it. That's my
whole game right there.''
</P>
<P>
   Pierce was in surprisingly good spirits, given his condition.
Teased that he was simply a Southern California softie, Pierce
insisted that his injuries were the result of ``working too hard.''
On his way to the bus, he high-fived several wide-eyed University
of Miami recruits who had been brought over to the gym to see the
big boys.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce also loves to play against Miami. He had 26 points and a
career-high 9 steals in Boston's 96-84 victory over the Heat Dec. 3
at the FleetCenter, indignant that anyone could think Dan Majerle
could contain him. (Majerle had defended Pierce well in a 110-92
Heat victory here Nov. 20.) Pierce had his rookie season high of 31
points here.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce's injury comes at a time when the Celtics are undermanned
at the swingman position. Adrian Griffin has missed eight games
with a sprained ankle and tried to practice Monday. Said Pitino,
``Adrian did not look good.'' He's out for a while longer. Eric
Williams will go on the injured list, probably Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Pitino with Walter McCarty and Calbert Cheaney as
likely starters tonight and no one in reserve. Doug Overton may
spend some time at big guard, as he did Saturday, and, in certain
situations, Antoine Walker can play small forward, as he did
Saturday. Pitino said he was not going to bring in an extra body.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pitino again talked about getting his short-fused players to
stop whining about calls and aggravating officials. On Saturday,
the coach said some of his players had the ``diplomacy of Stalin''
in dealing with the officials. Monday, he said, ``My problem with
the team is how they handle the officials. They don't show maturity
in handling the officials and they don't know how to get calls. All
they do is alienate themselves and they get screwed every time
because of it. So you never get the benefit of the doubt because of
their attitude. Until they mature in that area, they can learn
valuable lessons of how to screw up.'' The Celtics are averaging
26.3 fouls a game. Only Cleveland (27.7) and the Knicks (26.3)
commit as many. And only the Cavs, slightly, are allowing more
opponent free throws a game than Boston. Meanwhile, Pat Riley is
concerned about his team's inability to get to the line. The Heat
are averaging only 22.3 free throw attempts per game, third-fewest
in the league, ahead of Dallas and the Knicks. And Miami's average
of 16.36 free throw makes per game is second to last, ahead of only
Golden State . . . Griffin participated in his first practice since
blowing out his ankle in Chicago Feb. 8. He agreed with the coach's
assessment. ``I've still got a ways to go,'' he said. ``I tried to
practice a little. I scrimmaged a little. But I'm not there. Still,
I'm not going to know anything unless I get out there.'' Griffin
did say he felt good just playing, ``even though my teammates were
destroying me every time.'' . . . Tim Hardaway has returned to the
Miami lineup after missing 26 games with a jammed knee. Riley said
that Hardaway, who has played in the last two games, had his best
practice Monday since returning . . . The Celtics and Heat have
developed somewhat of a trash-talking rivalry although, as Pitino
noted, everyone does it. ``It's the culture we're in,'' Pitino
said. ``The whole league does it. It's not Miami. It's not Boston.
It's every single team. It's the new culture: Put as many people
down as possible in a given day.''

HIGH COURT UPHOLDS LIMITS ON CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Mo., Vt.)  (nk) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ruling in a Missouri campaign finance case with
important national implications, the Supreme Court on Monday
decisively upheld limits on political contributions and rejected
the argument that inflation has rendered unconstitutionally low the
$1,000 limit it upheld 24 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-3 decision left states with considerable latitude to adopt
that $1,000 limit upheld in the court's much-disputed Buckley vs.
Valeo decision, or to experiment with even lower caps, as a number
of states recently have.
</P>
<P>
   The test, the court said in a majority opinion by Justice David
H. Souter, is not any fixed or indexed dollar amount, but whether a
contribution limit was so low ``as to render political association
ineffective, drive the sound of a candidate's voice below the level
of notice, and render contributions pointless.'' Missouri's $1,000
cap met this test without running afoul of the First Amendment, the
court said.
</P>
<P>
   The decision overturned a 1998 ruling by the federal appeals
court in St. Louis, which declared the Missouri limit
unconstitutional on the ground that it was too low _ $1,000 in 1976
being the equivalent of less than $400 today _ and that the state
had failed to provide ``demonstrable evidence'' of problems
resulting from large contributions. Had the justices agreed with
the 8th U.S. Court of Appeals, the federal campaign finance system,
which also has a $1,000 limit, and those of many states would have
been thrown into turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   The closely watched case did not call on the justices to
reconsider the Buckley vs. Valeo decision as a whole or even to
address its most widely criticized element, its holding that
campaign expenditures, as opposed to contributions, represent the
highest form of political speech and may not be limited. Many
people have blamed the decision for the tide of independent
expenditures as well as unregulated ``soft money'' contributions
that appear increasingly likely to swamp the political system.
</P>
<P>
   In a dissenting opinion Monday, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy
declared that ``Buckley has not worked,'' having ``created a
misshapen system'' that has ``forced a substantial amount of
political speech underground.'' Justice Clarence Thomas dissented
as well, declaring in an opinion that Missouri's contribution
limits were ``patently unconstitutional'' and that Buckley vs.
Valeo should be overruled; Justice Antonin Scalia also signed the
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   But while the question before the court was limited to the
contribution question, the various opinions Monday contained some
intriguing tea leaves for the future.
</P>
<P>
   A concurring opinion by Justice Stephen G. Breyer, joined by
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, suggested that the court should give
the political branches considerable leeway in sorting out a
difficult question on which ``a legislature has significantly
greater institutional expertise'' than a court.
</P>
<P>
   Within the existing Buckley framework, laws regulating soft
money might well be upheld, Breyer said. Alternatively, he said,
the decision could be reinterpreted ``in light of the post-Buckley
experience'' to make ``less absolute the contribution/expenditure
line, particularly in respect to independently wealthy candidates,
whose expenditures might be considered contributions to their own
campaigns.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the precedent did not prove sufficiently flexible, Breyer
concluded, ``I believe the Constitution would require us to
reconsider Buckley.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the other members of the court, Justice John Paul Stevens
indicated in a concurring opinion that he, too, would be ready to
uphold limits on money in politics well beyond those upheld in the
Buckley decision. ``Money is property; it is not speech,'' Stevens
said, in a comment that rejected the essential equation of money
and speech that was the analytical foundation of Buckley vs. Valeo.
</P>
<P>
   And Kennedy, in his dissenting opinion, distanced himself from
his two fellow dissenters with a paragraph that startled those who
thought they understood the dimensions of his near-absolutist view
of political speech. ``I would leave open the possibility that
Congress, or a state legislature, might devise a system in which
there are some limits on both expenditures and contributions, thus
permitting officeholders to concentrate their time and efforts on
official duties rather than on fund raising,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent campaign finance decisions, only Stevens and Ginsburg
had indicated a willingness to revisit the Buckley vs. Valeo
dichotomy between contributions and expenditures, so supporters of
limits on expenditures and soft money, while acknowledging that
they still could not count on a majority of the court, detected
significant forward movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reality infuses these opinions,'' one such advocate, E. Joshua
Rosenkranz, executive director of the Brennan Center for Justice at
New York University Law School, said in an interview. ``The court
is taking account of what's going on out there. We're in far better
shape than we were before this decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicole A. Gordon, executive director of the New York City
Campaign Finance Board, a city agency that administers the public
financing of local political races, said the decision had produced
``a collective sigh of relief from the reform community'' that not
only did the court not reject contribution limits, as some had
forecast, but now appeared open to arguments on behalf of new
limits.
</P>
<P>
   While there is no immediate next test looming for the court,
cases in the pipeline could provide one. Expenditure limits adopted
in 1995 by the state Legislature in Vermont are being challenged in
federal District Court in Burlington. Under the state's limits for
gubernatorial races, for example, the challenger may spend no more
than $300,000 while an incumbent seeking re-election is limited to
85 percent of what the challenger spends.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the other members of the majority, Chief Justice William
H. Rehnquist and Justice Sandra Day O'Connor joined Souter's
opinion, Nixon vs. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, No. 98-963,
without further elaboration. The majority opinion studiously
avoided speculation about the future. Souter, acknowledging the
calls of his colleagues for overruling Buckley vs. Valeo, said:
``The answer is that we are supposed to decide this case.'' He
noted that the broader question was not before the court.

 WASHINGTON: the court. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The challenge to the Missouri contribution limit, adopted by the
state Legislature in 1994, was brought by a former candidate for
state auditor and a political action committee that supported him.
The candidate, Zev David Fredman, argued that the limit was so low
that, as an insurgent, he could not exercise his First Amendment
right to mount an effective campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Fredman's victory in the appeals court threatened to unsettle
many states' contribution limits on two levels: first, under the
notion that inflation should be taken into account in assessing a
limit's adequacy, and second, by demanding a level of evidence of
corruption beyond what the Supreme Court had required when it
upheld the federal limits in Buckley vs. Valeo.
</P>
<P>
   In his opinion Monday, Souter said the 8th Circuit's view that
inflation must be taken into account reflected a ``fundamental
misunderstanding'' of Buckley vs. Valeo as having adopted any
particular level as a minimum. And on the question of evidence, he
said, ``this case does not present a close call.'' Souter said
``there is little reason to doubt'' that large contributions can be
corrupting, or can be seen as such by voters.
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of constitutional doctrine, there was considerable
wrestling over how to define the First Amendment standard of review
for the limits in question, an issue on which the Buckley precedent
was imprecise. The majority held Monday that the strictest judicial
scrutiny need not apply to contribution limits.

PARRANDO'S PARADOX: A LOSING STRATEGY FOR WINNING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Spain)   (Science Times)  
(DW) 
 By SANDRA BLAKESLEE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Spanish physicist has discovered what appears to be a new law
of nature that may help explain, among other things, how life arose
out of a primordial soup, why President Clinton's popularity rose
after he was caught in a sex scandal, and why investing in losing
stocks can sometimes lead to greater capital gains.
</P>
<P>
   Called Parrando's paradox, the law states that two games
guaranteed to make a player lose all his money will generate a
winning streak if played alternately.
</P>
<P>
   Named after its discoverer, Dr. Juan Parrando, who teaches
physics at the Complutense University in Madrid, the newly
discovered paradox is inspired by the mechanical properties of
ratchets _ the familiar saw-tooth tools used to lift automobiles
and run self-winding wristwatches. By translating the properties of
a ratchet into game theory _ a relatively new scientific discipline
that seeks to extract rules of nature from the gains and losses
observed in games _ Parrando discovered that two losing games could
combine to increase one's wealth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The importance of the paradox in real life remains to be
seen,'' said Dr. Charles Doering, a mathematician at the University
of Michigan, who is familiar with the research. ``It gives us a new
and unexpected view of a variety of phenomena,'' he said, ``and who
knows? Sometimes finding that one piece of the puzzle makes the
whole picture suddenly clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Derek Abbott, director of the Center for Biomedical
Engineering at the University of Adelaide in Australia, said that
many scientists were intrigued by the paradox and had begun
applying it to engineering, population dynamics, financial risk and
other disciplines. Abbott and a colleague at his center, Dr.
Gregory Harmer, recently carried out experiments to verify and
explain how Parrando's paradox works. Their research is described
in the Dec. 23 issue of Nature.
</P>
<P>
   The paradox is illustrated by two games played with coins
weighted on one side so that they will not fall evenly by chance to
heads or tails.
</P>
<P>
   In game A, a player tosses a single loaded coin and bets on each
throw. The probability of winning is less than half. In game B, a
player tosses one of two loaded coins with a simple rule added. He
plays Coin 1 if his money is a multiple of a particular whole
number, like three. If his money cannot be divided by the number
three, he plays Coin 2. In this setup, the second will be played
more often than the first. Both are loaded, one to lose badly and
one to win slightly, with the upshot being that anyone playing this
game will eventually lose all his money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure enough,'' Abbott said, when a person plays either game
100 times, all money taken to the gambling table is lost. But when
the games are alternated _ playing A twice and B twice for 100
times _ money is not lost. It accumulates into big winnings. Even
more surprising, he said, when game A and B are played randomly,
with no order in the alternating sequence, winnings also go up and
up.
</P>
<P>
   This is Parrando's paradox. Switching between the two games
creates a ratchet-like effect. With its saw-tooth shape, a ratchet
allows movement in one direction and blocks it in the other. ``You
see ratchets everywhere in life,'' Abbott said. ``Any child knows
that when you shake a bag of mixed nuts, the Brazil nuts rise to
the top. This is because smaller nuts block downward movement of
larger nuts.'' This trapping of heavier objects _ moving them
upward when one would expect them to fall down _ is the essence of
a ratchet.
</P>
<P>
   The same is true for particles that tend to move randomly within
cells but can be captured, or ratcheted, into performing useful
work. This is how many proteins and enzymes are designed, Abbott
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sharing an interest in microscopic ratchets, Abbott and Parrando
met in a coffee shop in Madrid in 1997 to discuss the phenomenon.
They started to wonder what might happen with a so-called flashing
ratchet. First, they imagined two tilted slopes that could be laid
on top of each other or held apart. One is smooth and straight, the
other saw-toothed. Particles placed at the top of either slope
would fall down to the bottom under the pull of gravity. Particles
placed at the bottom of either slope would go nowhere. But if the
two slopes were superimposed and alternated or ``flashed'' back and
forth, particles resting at the bottom could be made to move
uphill.
</P>
<P>
   Parrando then translated a flashing ratchet into the language of
game theory. Then, he devised the two coin games that Abbott
confirmed in recent experiments. Game A is like the smooth slope.
The single loaded coin produces steady losses, just like particles
sliding straight downhill. Game B is like the saw-tooth slope that
can catch objects. Each tooth on a ratchet has two sides, one that
goes up and one that goes down. The two coins, one good and one
bad, are like two sides of a single saw-tooth. In a computer, the
games are played 100 times, mimicking a ratchet with many teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Each winning round carries the player's money uphill, Abbott
said. Capital starts accumulating, just like particles moving up
the slope of the flashing ratchet. Switching the game traps the
money before new rounds of the game cause the money to be lost.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Parrando's paradox will not work for the kinds of
games played in casinos, Abbott said. Games A and B must be set up
to copy a ratchet, which means they must have some direct
interaction. In the experiments carried out by Abbott, game B
depends on the amount of capital being played and game A affects
those amounts. They are subtly connected, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Parrando's paradox may help scientists find new ways to separate
molecules, design tiny motors and understand games of survival
being played at the level of individual genes. Life itself may have
been bootstrapped by ratchets, Abbott said. When simple amino acids
were formed by chance, environmental forces would tend to destroy
incipient order. Ratchets could help ove life along its
evolutionary pathways toward greater complexity.
</P>
<P>
   Economists are studying Parrando's paradox to help find the best
strategies for managing investments. Dr. Sergei Maslov, a physicist
at Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, N.Y., recently showed
that if an investor simultaneously shared capital between two
losing stock portfolios, capital would increase rather than
decrease.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's mind-boggling,'' Maslov said. ``You can turn two minuses
into a plus.'' But so far, he said, it is too early to apply his
model to the real stock market because of its complexity.
</P>
<P>
   The paradox may shed light on social interactions and voting
behaviors, Abbott said. For example, Clinton, who at first denied
having a sexual affair with Monica Lewinsky (game A) saw his
popularity rise when he admitted that he had lied (game B.) The
added scandal created more good for Clinton.

 &HT;    Rams happily adopt go-for-broke passing offense
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ About 25 years ago, Bill Walsh was sitting in a
restaurant with an arm around his wife, drawing a passing play on
her back.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh's wife turned to him and asked, ``Did it work?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even realize I was doing it,'' Walsh recalls. ``I was
that into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh's creativity led to one of football's great innovations _
the West Coast offense. Before he retired as coach of the San
Francisco 49ers in 1989, Walsh had won three Super Bowls and
established a lasting legacy in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a decade, the West Coast offense _ a horizontal
passing game with short, quick routes _ has been a blueprint for
success in pro football.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of creativity in what we were doing at the
time,'' said Walsh, now general manager of the 49ers. ``But we
never thought it would be called the `West Coast offense.' At the
time, we thought it might become the San Francisco 49ers' offense,
but then someone put the label of `West Coast offense' on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh disciples George Seifert and Mike Shanahan each won two
Super Bowls with the 49ers and Broncos, respectively. Seahawks
coach Mike Holmgren, an offensive coordinator under Walsh for three
seasons, led the Packers to a championship three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But Walsh's system might not be the vogue offense in the NFL
anymore. This season, another high-flying passing attack with true
roots in the West Coast dominated the league.
</P>
<P>
   It's the old ``Air Coryell'' offense concocted by Don Coryell,
orchestrated to perfection by Hall of Fame quarterback Dan Fouts
and the San Diego Chargers in the late 1970s and '80s.
</P>
<P>
   And it's the offense that fans will see Sunday, when the Rams
use an amended version against the Titans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of ideas,'' said Coryell, who retired as Chargers
coach during the 1986 season. ``I just pulled out a blank piece of
paper and worked with it. I think every coach has probably drawn
plays on cocktail napkins. We all liked to drink.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Air Coryell'' is not a clone of the Walsh system. The West
Coast offense is a high-percentage passing game that features short
drops and rollouts, a quick throwing release and pinpoint timing
between the quarterback and receivers.
</P>
<P>
   Coryell's aerial circus is designed to stretch the field by
softening up defenses with long passes and then runs. It has more
multiple formations, motions and shifts.
</P>
<P>
   The West Coast offense settles for legged-out doubles; Coryell
went for home runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don put in such different wrinkles,'' Fouts said, ``that teams
had no clue how to stop us.''
</P>
<P>
   This season, defenses had trouble stopping the Rams, Redskins
and Patriots, all using revamped versions of Coryell's offense. The
Rams and Redskins gained the most yards and scored the most points
in the NFL this season. New England's lack of a running game ended
its early-season success.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams, behind NFL MVP quarterback Kurt Warner, running back
Marshall Faulk and receiver Isaac Bruce, scored the third-highest
number of points for a season in NFL history. On Sunday, the Rams
play the Tennessee Titans in the Super Bowl in the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know one thing: We have the capabilities to be very
explosive, just like we were in San Diego when we had Fouts,
(Charlie) Joiner, (Wes) Chandler, Kellen Winslow and the others,''
Rams receivers coach Al Saunders said. Saunders is a former Coryell
assistant who succeeded him as Chargers coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chargers were a vertical team (in moving downfield), just
like we are now,'' Saunders said. ``It doesn't matter what the
score is or where we are, we're going to play our style of offense.
Whatever your nature is, if you back down from it, you're not going
to be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   While late-night inspiration played a part in the development of
both offenses, Coryell and Walsh concede they were developed
largely out of happenstance.
</P>
<P>
   The West Coast offense is mislabeled because the system wasn't
contrived anywhere near the Pacific Ocean. Walsh, who was an
assistant coach on Paul Brown's staff in Cincinnati, lost rookie
quarterback Greg Cook midway through the 1969 season. The Bengals
were left with backup quarterback Virgil Carter, a mobile player
who lacked Cook's arm strength.
</P>
<P>
   So Walsh created the offense that became the so-called West
Coast offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a quarterback who didn't have a strong arm, so we were
forced to throw a lot of short, high-percentage passes, which we
hoped would be highly effective,'' Walsh said. ``We had big
receivers but not fast receivers. I think the essence of it was
mixing the short passes with the run, so opponents couldn't stack
up against the running game. Our short passing game was so
effective that it allowed us to start throwing deep.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, Walsh took his system to San Francisco, where his
quarterback was Steve DeBerg, who later became a Falcons backup.
DeBerg led the league in pass attempts and completions that season,
but he was replaced by Joe Montana the next.
</P>
<P>
   Montana had the league's highest completion percentage in his
first season and then led the 49ers to a 26-21 victory against the
Bengals in Super Bowl XVI.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The offense) really evolved in Cincinnati,'' Walsh said. ``We
were an expansion team, so we had relatively limited personnel. But
we had to move the ball with it. We wanted to pick up 20 to 30
first downs a game to control time of possession and score about 17
points, just to have a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Walsh, Coryell developed his system out of necessity. The
coach at San Diego State in the 1960s, the Aztecs' entire offensive
line graduated in 1967. Coryell was forced to open up his offense
by using a one-back system with three receivers. San Diego State
won 31 games in a row 1967-70.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a fine quarterback,'' Coryell said. ``We knew there was
no way in the world that we could run the football and win. So we
did what I think any coach would do, and that's adjust to our
personnel and branch out. Out of necessity, we really started to go
to spread formations and a lot more motion. It was a lot more
wide-open.''
</P>
<P>
   After a five-year stint with the St. Louis Cardinals, Coryell
was hired by the Chargers in 1978. He surrounded himself with great
assistants. Ernie Zampese, who became offensive coordinator for the
Cowboys and Patriots, coached San Diego's receivers; current Rams
assistant Jim Hanifan coached the offensive line; and future
Redskins coach Joe Gibbs coordinated the offense with Coryell.
</P>
<P>
   When those coaches left San Diego, they took part of the offense
with them.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs built his offense around powerful running back John
Riggins and three quarterbacks to win three Super Bowls. Zampese
refined the system with the Rams, who had current Redskins coach
Norv Turner as their receivers coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system has been bastardized so much over the years,'' said
Ralph Friedgen, the Georgia Tech offensive coordinator and former
Chargers assistant who uses part of Coryell's offense.
</P>
<P>
   Friedgen said he dreams up some of his plays in church. ``There
are so many coaches that have tinkered with it. It's not pure
anymore. Coaches get an idea, and they tinker with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Walsh concedes that versions of his offense don't resemble
the original.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year, you refine it, just like we did,'' Walsh said.
``Every man that left here has gone on and refined it and remolded
it. The pass plays probably remained the same, but every man added
his own wrinkle. They're building it around their players. (Vikings
coach) Dennis Green is going down the field a lot more because of
the wide receivers he has in Minnesota.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to expect something like this to continue to
evolve,'' Walsh said, ``but they do disappear, and something else
replaces it.''

 &HT;    ELIAN'S GRANDMOTHER FLY TO MIAMI, REUNION UNCERTAIN
 &HT;    (900&AMP;ADD)

<P>
   MIAMI _ After 60 days of posturing and rhetoric, the power of a
grandmother's love brought 6-year-old Cuban rafter Elian Gonzalez
achingly close to a reunion with his Cuban family.
</P>
<P>
   But after flying from New York to Miami, his two Cuban
grandmothers stopped short of going to the home of the boy's Miami
relatives, where he has been living since he was found floating in
an inner tube off Fort Lauderdale on Thanksgiving Day.
</P>
<P>
   The women reportedly insisted they be allowed to meet Elian on a
neutral site, while his Miami relatives remained just as adamant
that the grandmothers come to their home in Miami's Little Havana.
</P>
<P>
   The new stand-off was fresh evidence that even if the emotional
reunion were to take place, a stark divide remains between the
branches of the family over where the boy should live.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elian wants to tell them that he wants to stay here,'' the
boy's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez said before the women landed at
the Tamiami Airport. ``And he's going to tell them they should stay
here, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazaro Gonzalez, the brother-in-law of paternal grandmother
Mariela Quintana, has filed state and federal lawsuits to try to
overturn a decision by federal immigration officials that the boy
should be returned to his family in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   And on Monday, the first day of the new congressional session,
Florida Republican Sen. Connie Mack introduced a bill to give Elian
U.S. citizenship, which would free him from INS jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of the bill is to move the decision-making about
the boy from out of the hands of the (Immigration and
Naturalization Service) and into the hands of the court,'' said
Mack, whose bill was one of three filed in both the House and
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The grandmothers _ Quintana and maternal grandmother Raquel
Rodriguez _ began the day in New York, making emotional appeals on
the major television network morning programs, pleading that their
grandson be allowed to return to Cuba with them.
</P>
<P>
   Then, at midday, they surprised journalists when their hosts
from the National Council of Churches said the women would fly to
Miami and accept an invitation to visit the boy at his Miami
relatives' home.
</P>
<P>
   Their chartered jet touched don in Miami at about 4 p.m. EST. A
crowd of journalists and Cuban exiles had already gathered in the
street in front of the modest Little Havana home.
</P>
<P>
   By 5 p.m. EST, the crowd had grown to several hundred, with
organizers passing out carnations and other fresh-cut flowers.
Ramon Saul Sanchez, leader of the anti-Castro Democracy Movement,
used a bullhorn to exhort the crowd in Spanish to be on their best
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to show the world that we are a community of love and
respect, and that we are not violent like Fidel Castro says,'' he
said. ``Wave your flowers when they arrives, don't throw them.''
</P>
<P>
   By 7 p.m. EST, however, the moment had not come. Word filtered
through the crowd that the grandmothers were still at the airport,
apparently afraid to come to the house.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear how the stalemate would be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the reunion were to take place, it seemed likely to
produce some awkward moments, as both sides of the family have been
critical of the other in comments to the media.
</P>
<P>
   The grandmothers have said the Miami family is controlled by the
``Miami Mafia'' of exile extremists and that they are cashing in on
the boy's celebrity. Elian's Miami relatives have said the
grandmothers are controlled by Cuban President Fidel Castro and
that they haven't shown remorse for the boy's mother, who drowned
on the crossing from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The grandmothers _ here representing Elian's father, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez _ arrived in the United States from Cuba on Friday, flying
to New York as the guest of the National Council of Churches, which
favors returning the boy to Cuba. They met in Washington with U.S.
Attorney Janet Reno Saturday, making a tearful plea to at least see
their grandson, if not take him home to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Although both sides of the family told media over the weekend
that they had not communicated, Reno apparently got in touch with
the Miami family's attorneys and brokered the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear what bearing the reunion might have on other
facets of the case. The Miami family's lawsuit to keep the boy here
was expected to move forward this week, with government lawyers
filing a response to the family's complaint. U.S. District Judge
William Hoeveler is expected to schedule a hearing on the matter
once he receives the government response.
</P>
<P>
   Also undaunted, members of Congress took up Elian's case Monday,
all in an effort to block efforts by the INS to return the boy to
his father in Cuba prior to a state court hearing pitting his
relatives in Cuba and Miami in a custody battle.
</P>
<P>
   Mack said ``neither the president of the United States, his
attorney general, nor the dictator ruling Cuba are qualified to
decide the fate of this little boy.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., who filed a companion to Mack's bill
along with Reps. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Lincoln Diaz-Balart _ both
Miami Republicans born in Cuba _ said ``the best interest of Elian
must be our top priority. Any decision made by a governmental
agency is contrary to his best interest and clearly against his
mother's desires. While this legislation does not dictate an
outcome, it ensures that the rule of law is applied, upheld, and
enforced.''
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said President Clinton is
concerned that congressional action may become ``a political
debate, rather than the substantive debate that it should be,'' but
he added that ``if they pass something, obviously, we'll take a
look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Mack noted his bill was being sponsored by three Republicans and
three Democrats, including _ Bob Graham, Florida's senior senator.
</P>
<P>
   Graham said he supported the bill because the INS decision that
only Elian's father could speak for him was unfair to the boy and
others like him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It denies them the opportunity to have their options weighed
by an experienced child custody jurist using the standard of 'what
is in the best interest of the child.' `` he said.
</P>
<P>
   The competing House bills offer young Elian either U.S.
citizenship or permanent residency status by waiving numerous
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   The residency bill filed by Rep. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., with
support from Reps. Peter Deutsch, D-Fla., and Patrick Kennedy,
D-R.I., would waive a provision in immigration law that would
cancel Elian's permanent residency status if he returned to Cuba
for more than six months.
</P>
<P>
   Menendez said his bill would avoid questions about granting
citizenship to a person who had not requested it. A Menendez
spokesman said that if the competing citizenship bill appeared to
have enough support to pass the House, Menendez would support it.

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Where else but here would Mary Tyler Moore be
trying to have her picture taken with an uncooperative camel? The
animal would have none of this nonsense, particularly with the
bright lights of camera crews surrounding it like gun-toting
marauders. Not wanting to lose this battle in front of flashbulbs,
Moore, having stripped off her wrap and gotten on her hands and
knees, nearly wrestles the poor animal to the ground while trying
to hang on to its neck for a snapshot that wouldn't make this seem
as silly at it was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you with People magazine?'' Moore asks one of the
photographers, who shakes his head no, then bursts into laughter.
</P>
<P>
   Moore is a legend in the small-screen medium, and she's no
dummy. Her proposed series Mary and Rhoda, was killed and then
stomped on mercilessly by an industry unconvinced that a weekly
show featuring Valerie Harper and Moore would have a life of more
than two episodes, tops.
</P>
<P>
   ``After viewers see what your character has been up to, what
incentives would they have to watch beyond that?'' was a question
posed to Moore earlier in the day. She'd already asked herself the
same thing long ago.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why we found her holding court with reporters well into
the evening, talking up a two-hour Mary and Rhoda movie scheduled
for ABC next month. Along with stars from ABC's midseason series,
Moore attended this network-sponsored gathering held at a former
hotel (and now historic landmark) to promote the network's
four-hour miniseries Arabian Nights.
</P>
<P>
   This explains Moore's run-in with the camel, and why visitors
were also met by jiggling belly dancers, bare-chested men in
Arabian garb offering chicken strips on a stick, and women who
patrolled the place with 7-foot snakes wrapped snugly around their
torsos.
</P>
<P>
   In this insular world of attention-getting antics, this year's
midseason press presentations were actually quite tame, which may
have more to do with success than with the desperation that comes
from failure. Meaning the success of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,
of course, as the networks have retreated from offering their
expensive multinight movies for what is, for the time being anyway,
certain slaughter. (In the week that ended Jan. 16, ``Millionaire''
shows held seven of the top 10 places in the ratings.)
</P>
<P>
   Over this two-week press tour, where the ratings triumphs of
Millionaire, Fox's surprisingly potent comedy Malcolm in the Middle
and HBO's mob series The Sopranos were discussed and dissected,
what blindsided everyone was this mess over whether the White House
drug office was writing anti-drug messages into some programs'
plots.
</P>
<P>
   After the story broke, executives and producers were bombarded
with questions about the issue that, as it deepened, seemed to be
no issue at all. Before long, attention shifted back to the second
half of the season and whether Malcolm, finding itself in that rare
stratosphere of being liked by critics and viewers, was nothing
more than a freak.
</P>
<P>
   Or whether Wonderland would just freak people out, period.
Created by Peter Berg, the former Chicago Hope actor who made his
entry on the medical drama series by cutting off a guy's leg with a
chainsaw, Wonderland delves into the lives of doctors working in a
hospital's psychiatric ward and emergency room. The presentation
tape screened mostly for background purposes was so emotionally
gloomy that critics wondered whether it was made for viewer
consumption or the personal amusement of Berg, who admits to being
drawn to such salacious material. (His film, Very Bad Things, was a
morbid comedy about the murderous fallout from a bachelor party.)
</P>
<P>
   Many scenes involve chaotic exchanges between doctors and mental
patients. But one scene involves a pregnant doctor (and one of the
lead characters) who is stabbed by a needle while attempting to
restrain a patient. The needle penetrates the unborn child's skull.
Since Wonderland mimics a documentary style of photographing life,
the initial consultation with a doctor is staged, showing a frank,
emotional exchange of what may be if the baby is carried to term.
This news in hand, the husband races through the hospital corridor,
finds the patient lying on a gurney, and tries to choke him to
death.
</P>
<P>
   ABC officials found the episode so disturbing that they asked
Berg to hold it until the third installment, if only to keep
viewers from turning against the series right away. Berg agreed.
``It's a show that really has never been done, at least not in this
way,'' he said. ``It might be a little bit wiser to try and ease an
audience into it. Not shock them quite so much so soon.'' ___ &QC;

LOS ANGELES: xxx so soon.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even more troubling, in terms of mainstream salability, is The
Others, slated for NBC next month. Perhaps you've already seen
on-air promos for this series in which men and women discuss their
``gifts'' of communicating with the dead. Just in time to take
advantage of the popularity of The Sixth Sense, the series revolves
around a secret society that helps people contact those ``on the
other side.'' I take it that they do this for free, or for their
own sense of purpose or destiny, much the way Buffy exists to chase
vampires.
</P>
<P>
   One episode, for example, involves a man who can't ``pass on''
until his wife stops blaming herself for his death. The dark,
shadowy touches and complex nature of The Others may put you in
mind of another NBC series, Sleepwalkers, which isn't a good thing,
since audiences never warmed up to the very similar idea of
reaching into a netherworld. Sleepwalkers was canceled after two
episodes.
</P>
<P>
   As for comedies, Titus seems perfectly suited for Fox audience
sensibilities _ jokes that work well in juvenile detention centers.
One of the more promising series is Kyra Sedgwick's Talk to Me. The
footage that was screened showed some sparks, particularly when
Sedgwick's character, a morning-radio talk host, was on the air.
The cast is talented, with Beverly D'Angelo as a conservative talk
host and MAD TV's Nicole Sullivan as Sedgwick's sister.
</P>
<P>
   It will be intriguing to see what kind of reaction NBC's God,
the Devil &AMP; Bob gets. Even though it's animated, God is the
spitting image of Jerry Garcia. He wears a beard and toils around
the house in Hawaiian shirts, jeans and sandals, reminding Bob of
his higher purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Three other animated series are slated for the next few months.
Baby Blues, about a harried family with two kids, is on the WB;
Clerks, an animated version of the movie, also written by Kevin
Smith, airs on ABC; Sammy is David Spade's creation slated for NBC.
It's based on a strained father-son relationship.
</P>
<P>
   When asked how he'll be able to bring the outlandishness of
Clerks to network TV, Smith yanked out a piece of paper. ``They
prepared us for this,'' he said. ``The ABC response was (he's
reading the paper) `It looks like we're going to have a good time.
It's a fun show. It's a family show with a lot of ethnic diversity.
And tune in this March.' ''
</P>
<P>
   As the crowd burst into laughter, Smith said, ``We knew we
couldn't go for pushing the envelope farther than, say, South Park
has gone. So we're actually forced to be funnier than we were in
the movie. So now we actually have to work for the laughs. But
we're psyched to be giving these characters a longer life.'' ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   George Clooney's return to ER for the departure of Julianna
Margulies is probably in the works, since the major parties said in
separate interviews on separate days they hadn't even discussed the
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Clooney: ``No one's ever talked to me about that.''
</P>
<P>
   John Wells, an ER executive producer: ``I haven't heard a word
from George.''
</P>
<P>
   Clooney, in town promoting the CBS movie Fail-Safe, said he'd
need about a $2 million payday to return for that one episode.
``Which I'd like to go on record as saying: I'd go back for $2
million an episode,'' he told reporters. ``I'm not an idiot.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of returnees, David Caruso, who left us as the star of
NYPD Blue, returned in the role of struggling actor in a TNT movie
called Deadlocked. Has he regretted leaving Blue? ``Only when I'm
not working,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Ellen DeGeneres, back here for the first time since
the cancellation of Ellen. She was promoting her participation in
HBO's splendid If These Walls Could Talk franchise that will deal
with lesbian relationships. Michelle Williams (Dawson's Creek)
stars in one of the segments as a young girl realizing she's gay.
Vanessa Redgrave, who didn't make the panel because of the flu,
plays a gay woman reminded of her societal detachment when her
lover of many years dies.
</P>
<P>
   DeGeneres, who co-stars with Sharon Stone as a couple trying to
have a baby, was jovial and hilarious, sitting most of the time
hand-in-hand with girlfriend Anne Heche, who wrote and directed the
DeGeneres-Stone segment.
</P>
<P>
   Now with a deal to do a variety show for CBS next fall,
DeGeneres is able to look back at Ellen more clearly. ``I was sad.
I was going through a grieving period and there was a little bit of
bitterness, and I made mistakes, publicly,'' she said. ``I look at
it now and know that there should have been a grieving period where
I sit alone in the corner of my basement rocking naked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Omigod,'' DeGeneres said, flashing that smile we hadn't seen
in a while, ``I'm revealing too much.''

JUSTICES UPHOLD CAMPAIGN FINANCE LAWS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A divided Supreme Court on Monday upheld the
constitutionality of state-imposed limits on campaign
contributions, saying the restrictions generally do not violate the
right of election donors to speak freely on political matters.
</P>
<P>
   In a 6-3 decision, the high court said donation limits help
states achieve the ``important'' goal of preventing the potentially
corrupting influence of big money from entering the political
process. The justices, in upholding a Missouri campaign finance
law, said the state's interest in preserving governmental integrity
trumps the contributors' claim that restricting contributions
reduces their ability to make their views heard during election
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   But the court said that in extreme instances a contribution
limit might be so severe as to ``drive the sound of a candidate's
voice below the level of notice, and render contributions
pointless.'' In such a rare instance, the donation limit would be
an unconstitutional limit on free speech, the court said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Texas places no limits on campaign contributions in races for state
offices.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who leads the national effort to
solicit contributions for GOP Senate candidates, played down the
high court's decision while seizing on the rare exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Supreme Court has made clear that limits on candidate
contributions will be struck down whenever those limits impede
effective communication of a candidate's message,'' said McConnell,
who chairs the National Republican Senatorial Committee. The
senator and his committee had submitted a legal brief to the
justices, unsuccessfully urging them to rule contribution limits
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   But Missouri Attorney General Jay Nixon, who defended the state
law at the high court, lauded the justices' decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Campaign limits are an important way to protect the integrity
of the electoral process,'' Nixon said. ``This ruling sets the
record straight that campaign contribution limits can be used to
help protect and reform the electoral process. We can take
pro-active measures to prevent our government from being bought and
sold to the highest bidder.''
</P>
<P>
   The high court, with its ruling, extended to state-office
elections its 1976 decision upholding a $1,000 limit on individual
contributions to candidates for federal office. In that earlier
ruling, Buckley vs. Valeo, the justices said restrictions on
contributions did not interfere with donors' First Amendment
free-speech rights, as they remain free to speak in favor of their
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The high court in that case, however, struck down limits on the
amount candidates can spend on their own campaigns, saying such a
financial restriction would unconstitutionally interfere with their
ability to get their messages out.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court, reiterating a point it made in the Buckley
case, said state campaign contribution limits are constitutional
because they help dispel the public perception that well-heeled
donors can buy the votes of elected officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leave the perception of impropriety unanswered, and the
cynical assumption that large donors call the tune could jeopardize
the willingness of voters to take part in democratic governance,''
Justice David H. Souter wrote in the court's majority opinion.
``Democracy works only if the people have faith in those who
govern, and that faith is bound to be shattered when high officials
and their appointees engage in activities which arouse suspicions
of malfeasance and corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining Souter's opinion in Nixon vs. Shrink Missouri Government
PAC were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Stephen G.
Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sandra Day O'Connor and John Paul
Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   The dissenting justices _ Anthony M. Kennedy, Antonin Scalia and
Clarence Thomas _ countered in vain that money does not necessarily
corrupt the political process and that imposing limits on
contributions unconstitutionally infringes on donors' free speech.
</P>
<P>
   The dissenters, who urged the court to overrule Buckley, said
campaign contributions are a form of speech analogous to the
constitutionally protected act of standing on a soapbox and voicing
support for a candidate. Hence, any limit on contributions
restricts the donor's constitutional rights.
</P>
<P>
   With its decision, the high court upheld the constitutionality
of a Missouri law that limits political contributions from
individuals and committees to $1,075 to candidates for statewide
office, $525 to candidates for state senate and $275 for
state-representative candidates. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, a
political action committee, sought to contribute more than $1,075
to Zev David Fredman, an unsuccessful 1998 GOP candidate for
Missouri state auditor, and challenged the law as an
unconstitutional restriction on free speech.
</P>
<P>
   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with the committee,
striking down the law as a violation of the First Amendment.
Missouri then appealed to the Supreme Court, saying the state law
merely extended the justices' decision in Buckley to state offices.

&HT;     COLORFUL CHARACTER NOW A FIGURE IN WACO INVESTIGATION 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DICK J. REAVIS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ A colorful New Orleans electronics expert, private
eye and business promoter is back on the fringes of history, this
time in connection with the 1993 federal siege of the Branch
Davidian cult compound near Waco.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Novel, 61, is the originator of allegations that federal
agents fired upon David Koresh's followers as his cult complex was
bursting into flames. Some 80 people, including a number of
children, died.
</P>
<P>
   Government investigators are looking into the possibility that
at Waco, federal agents might have been guilty of attempted murder,
not negligence.
</P>
<P>
   At the request of the Justice Department's special counsel,
former Sen. John C. Danforth of Missouri, and at the order of
Waco's federal district court, experts will re-enact a scenario
intended to prove or debunk Novel's contentions.
</P>
<P>
   But Novel is not the sort of figure whose charges the news media
or the courts are accustomed to taking seriously, and his
background only adds to the furor over the events at the Branch
Davidian compound.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble begins, perhaps, with his birth. Novel says he is
the illegitimate son of showman and songwriter Billy Rose
(``Without a Song,'' ``Me and My Shadow''), who said, ``I sell
ballyhoo, not genius.''
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Novel says, was a chorus girl. Perhaps if Novel is
given to showmanship, it is because it is in his genes.
</P>
<P>
   His resume says that he was the model, inaccurately portrayed,
as ``Mr. X'' in the 1991 Oliver Stone movie ``JFK.'' He has for
years been widely identified as an assassination conspirator; he
was a bit player in the Watergate scandal; and he has lately been
investigating UFO phenomena.
</P>
<P>
   In years past, he also has been an adviser to such notable
figures as carmaker John DeLorean and pornographer Larry Flynt. He
is the sort of fast-talking raconteur who can spin tales that only
space age technology can disprove _ or verify.
</P>
<P>
   The re-enactment, reportedly slated to take place in March at
Fort Hood, ``is worthy of Cecile B. DeMille,'' said former U.S.
Attorney General Ramsey Clark, the lawyer for some of the Branch
Davidian survivors.
</P>
<P>
   A British company, Vector Data Research, will fly a fixed-wing
aircraft at an altitude of about 9,000 feet over an expanse of
prairie upon which federal agents and perhaps others will be firing
weapons of differing caliber, loaded with a variety of munitions.
</P>
<P>
   The aircraft will be equipped with a Forward-Looking Infrared,
or FLIR, camera, similar or identical to one the FBI used to film
the finale at the Branch Davidian compound. Dozens of technical
experts and lawyers will supervise the filming and re-enactment.
</P>
<P>
   FLIR devices record variations in temperature, producing
black-and-white pictures that look very much like ordinary movie
images.
</P>
<P>
   The infrared videotape at the center of today's debate was
declassified by the FBI in 1994, during the criminal trial of
Branch Davidian survivors. Prosecutors argued that the infrared
videotapes showed that on April 19, 1993, residents of the complex
set three separate fires inside the building.
</P>
<P>
   But in late 1995, while viewing the 90-minute tape, Novel says
he saw something in the videotapes that no one else had noticed:
flashes out of the view of news cameras. Novel alleges the flashes
are ``thermal signatures'' of weapons' fire.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the video flashes are pictures of gun- and
grenade-launcher fire is a critical issue, because FBI officials
have always denied that their agents took shots at anyone on April
19.
</P>
<P>
   The question of federal gunfire and of who may be responsible
also are issues that Danforth is now investigating as a special
counsel to the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   The allegation will be litigated this May, when a wrongful death
suit filed against the federal government by Branch Davidian
survivors goes to trial in Waco.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who put faith in Novel's interpretation of what
happened is Clark, who is representing plaintiffs in the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems clear to me,'' Clark said from his offices in New
York, ``that the FLIR tape shows repeated gunfire, toward and into
the church complex, from positions where only federal people could
have been.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark puts such faith in Novel's discovery, in fact, that he has
hired Novel as his chief investigator for the case.
</P>
<P>
   But the plaintiff's arguments that government agents tried to
shoot people in the Branch Davidian compound is problematic
because, thus far, there are no witnesses to federal gunfire, and
most observers agree it would be foolhardy to accept Novel's
interpretation without corroboration.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven of those who survived the assault on the Branch Davidian
compound were acquitted in 1994 of charges of involvement in the
deaths of four federal agents who died during the 51-day assault of
the cult's holdout.

COMMENTARY: MOMMA AMERICA 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALEXANDRIA, Egypt _ Movies and plays about America are all the
rage in Egypt lately.
</P>
<P>
   Let's see, there are two plays running now _ ``Monica and the
Blue Dress'' and ``Me, My Wife and Monica.'' Then there's the
recent film ``Momma America,'' which was a huge hit. It's the story
of a family in which America is the mother, Egypt is the son, the
Arab world is his brothers and sisters and everything is fine until
a cousin shows up _ Israel _ and a fight breaks out over Momma
America's inheritance. The movie ends with the Statue of Liberty
exploding and the Egyptian being arrested because he looks like a
terrorist.
</P>
<P>
   The latest film, ``Hello America,'' involves an Egyptian who
goes to the United States and is hit by a car driven by the
daughter of a presidential candidate. The candidate offers the
Egyptian anything he wants if he'll just keep the accident quiet.
First the Egyptian demands that the United States force Israel to
give back all the West Bank _ a line that produces loud cheers from
Egyptian audiences. Then he demands that America take its $2.3
billion a year in aid to Egypt and stick it in its ear _ sparking
more wild cheers.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction to ``Hello America'' well illustrates the love-hate
relationship Egyptians, and much of the developing world, have with
the United States these days.
</P>
<P>
   While some older Egyptians who came of age in Nasserite times
still resent America, for many younger urban Egyptians America has
never been more of a role model. ``My generation was exposed to
European culture and dreamt of Paris,'' a woman professor in
Alexandria told me. ``My kids dream only of the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   At a recent seminar at the U.S. Embassy, an Egyptian economics
professor denounced globalization as the new ``Western
colonialism.'' Asked afterward what his kids were doing, he said
one was a computer scientist and another worked for Egypt's biggest
cellular phone company.
</P>
<P>
   At the same seminar, an Egyptian executive who works for a top
pharmaceutical company confided that he chats regularly via
Internet with a Libyan cabinet minister, who communicates with his
Cairo friends through an America Online account that he maintains
in London. The Libyan cabinet can live without relations with
America but not America Online.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us in the computer business, America is the only example
to follow,'' explains Mohammed Hanno, head of Alexandria's Arabia
Computer Systems. ``France is not an example. Germany is not an
example. I just bought four software disks from Amazon.com. Now you
don't have to go to the States, you can have the States come to
you.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Egyptian-American scientist Ahmed Zewail won the Nobel
Prize in Chemistry last year, it triggered both pride here and a
debate about why he never could have won it if he had stayed in
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. gives me a headache,'' an Egyptian economist friend
remarked to me. ``The U.S. is a tremendous country _ you can say or
do anything. I love the freedom of the press, and all the people
who care about whales. You even impeach your president. On the
other hand, it's a miserable place. The U.S. says it stands for
democracy and principles, but then it goes out in the world and
acts on cynical self-interest. People here see the U.S. as either
one or the other, but it's both.''
</P>
<P>
   Egypt is a reminder that Americans have no sense of how much the
world thinks about them, emulates them and resents them. The United
States used to have a big consulate here in Alexandria, the
third-largest city in Africa. The Republicans, led by the likes of
Jesse Helms, closed this consulate in 1993 to save pennies.
</P>
<P>
   That's why it was so sad to see the administration bringing
Helms to speak to the United Nations, where he threatened that if
it was not more compliant with America, the United States would
pull out. Who authorized him to speak for America? When are the
Clintonites going to stop kissing up to this guy? Why don't they
send Jed Clampett from ``The Beverly Hillbillies'' up to the United
Nations too, so we can hear what he has to say about foreign
policy?
</P>
<P>
   America has never needed or been needed by the rest of the world
more than today. America has never had a better chance to promote
its values, democracy and commerce than today. There has never been
a sharper debate about America among youth all over the world than
today. This is not the time for shrinking America's presence
abroad. It is exactly the time to be expanding it.

 &HT;    Jokes about an innocent question follow journalist
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When the calendar flips to January, if Butch and Jana
John are driving in the car and hear it mentioned on the radio,
they will laugh or maybe roll their eyes. When the phone inevitably
rings, as it did Sunday, Butch will answer, listen and call out,
''Jan, it's the annual story. Yeah, we're revisiting that.''
</P>
<P>
   This revisitation is a bit of revisionist history. A chance to
set the record straight before yet another Super Bowl Picture Day.
No, Butch John never asked The Dumbest Question in Super Bowl
History. Everyone just says he did.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, Chris Berman reminded his ESPN viewers of
Super Bowl XXII, in January 1988, ''When Doug Williams was actually
asked, 'How long have you been a black quarterback?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Never happened. John should know. He asked the question, while
covering that Super Bowl as a sportswriter for the Clarion-Ledger
in Jackson, Miss. ''I've been living with that one ever since,'' he
said, ''one of the stupidest questions ever asked at the Super Bowl
which was never really asked.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Sunday night the Washington Redskins arrived to play
Denver, Williams sat with a small group of 12 to 18 writers. Much
already had been made of the fact that Williams was the first black
quarterback to take a team to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ''For about 20 minutes, Doug's getting all these questions about
the significance (of Williams' race),'' said John, who had covered
Williams' brother Mike at Grambling, where Williams also starred.
''All these question, blah-de-blah-de-blah. Never let up. Being
from the South, having covered Grambling and his brother Mike, Doug
being a black quarterback was no big deal to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, John spoke: ''This is what I said, verbatim: 'Doug,
it's obvious you've been a black quarterback all your life. When
did it start to matter?' Everybody got a pretty good laugh out of
it. His answer was that it didn't matter 'til he got to the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ''That answer was used in the wire services. Also, there was a
little blurb _ no more than a paragraph _ in the San Diego paper
the next day, about 'A question from a well-meaning writer.' From
there, things just kind of shot out of control. By the end of the
week, it was the question.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially once Picture Day came. TV and radio went with it, and
the story exploded. ''It was like there'd been 500 (media) people
there,'' John said. The day after Williams threw four touchdown
passes to lead Washington to a 42-10 victory and win the MVP
trophy, John told him, ''Doug, I'm the guy who asked you the
question. I didn't mean anything by it.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I know,'' Williams replied. ''What happened to you is
basically what happens to us'' _ how athletes can be misquoted, or
taken out of context, especially at a media orgy like the Super
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been nailed pretty good,'' said John, 46, now a news
reporter at the Louisville Courier-Journal. ''If I had it to do
over again, I'd ask it in private, not a group setting. What
bothers me is people will repeat it without checking their facts.
They're so damn eager to repeat that, although very few people put
my name on it.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not embarrassing,'' he said. ``It just bothers me that
someone would take something fifth-, sixth-, seventh-hand and turn
it into something else. It's like one of those urban legends. But
I'd rather it never happened.''

 &HT;    Atlanta Fed: Higher rates likely needed to curb inflation
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Jack Guynn prefers not to think in terms of ``hawk''
or ``dove'' when it comes to Federal Reserve inflation policy. But
he makes it clear in his public statements that he regards
inflation as the No. 1 threat to the economy, deserving tough
measures to contain it.
</P>
<P>
   Guynn, 57, is president and chief executive officer of the
Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. As such, he participates in U.S.
economic policy designed to deal with inflation. By rotation, he is
a voting member this year of the Federal Reserve's policy-making
Open Market Committee, which holds its first meeting of 2000 on
Feb. 1-2.
</P>
<P>
   Most Wall Street analysts believe the Fed will raise short-term
interest rates at least a quarter of a percentage point at that
meeting as part of a strategy to fight inflation by slowing the
pace of economic growth. It would be the fourth rate boost since
last June.
</P>
<P>
   Some Wall Street observers identify Federal Open Market
Committee members as hawks or doves, depending on whether they are
thought to favor a rate increase _ hawks _ or are likely to
disapprove _ doves.
</P>
<P>
   Guynn has been identified as a ``moderate,'' but in an interview
Monday he made a strong case that inflationary conditions have
reappeared, and it's up to the Fed to do something about it pretty
soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, the probability that we will see greater inflationary
pressures in the new year and beyond is greater than last year and
the year before,'' said Guynn.
</P>
<P>
   He said the ``good fortune'' that helped the Fed keep a lid on
prices in recent years, such as low commodity prices and cheap
Asian imports, is ``all gone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it is right square in our lap as policy-makers to get it
right,'' he said. ``The old notion that we can wait until we have
seen two or three months of bad data and then do something is not a
practical, responsible way to conduct policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the lead times for policy changes to act on the economy,
he said delay ``means you're setting yourself up to let inflation
run at an increased rate for six months or nine months or a year
before you get it back down again.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently Guynn's position on inflation, which he also
discussed in his annual speech to the Atlanta Rotary Club on
Monday, rattled an already nervous stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts fear that one of Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan's
policy motives is to dampen the bull market because of the
stimulating impact it has had on the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Guynn said it is clear that ``the extraordinary rise in equities
in recent years has fueled consumer spending.'' But he noted that
the phenomenon is not limited to stocks, since homeowners, in
refinancing mortgage loans to take advantage of lower rates, also
used some of their gains for consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will leave it to my friends to give advice on the market,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Guynn is a self-described ``engineer who's risen through the
Federal Reserve System.'' His entire career has been with the
Atlanta Fed, starting in 1964 after completing his undergraduate
college work, and he has held a number of senior management posts.
He became the bank's 13th president on Jan. 1, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Guynn is an advocate of greater public disclosure by the Fed,
although he said it is too early to comment on the impact of the
Fed's new announcement policy following FOMC meetings, which goes
into effect at next week's meeting. The Fed will no longer announce
a ``bias'' toward higher or lower rates, but will disclose a more
general description of how the FOMC views ``risks'' in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``My theory was and still is that the more financial markets and
others know about what we are thinking, the more quickly they can
adjust. And perhaps the less abrupt adjustments in the economy are,
people (will) have some sense of where we are in our thinking,''
said Guynn.
</P>
<P>
   Part of his thinking comes from the anecdotal information the
Atlanta bank gathers about business and the economy directly from
executives around the Southeast. Guynn thinks that process as
important _ if not more so _ than the economic research the bank's
staff conducts.
</P>
<P>
   Business executives often have a sense of what's coming ``before
it shows up in the data,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A big part of the policy-making process is to use information
from business people,'' said Guynn. He said this kind of
information will be a big part ``of what I take to next week's
(FOMC) meeting.''

LOOK WHO'S TAKING A SWING AT DIPLOMACY
</HEADLINE>

 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I don't mean to alarm anyone, but in the span of a few days last
week, Jesse Helms appeared before the U.N. Security Council to
offer a ``hand of friendship,'' Newt Gingrich pleaded for an end to
partisan bickering in Washington, and Mike Tyson expounded at
length on civilization and ``the sensitivity of human beings.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's premature to begin raiding the ATMs and hoarding
bottled water again, but I am gassing up the car to be on the safe
side. If the lions get any cuddlier with the lambs, I'm booking a
room at the nearest doomsday cult.
</P>
<P>
   Let us begin with the travels of pugilist Helms, who _ at the
invitation of U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke _ became the first
member of Congress to address the Security Council. (Is the Clinton
administration displaying a wicked sense of humor in the home
stretch, or what? First, the continuous stream of televised images
of Bill as the Stepford Husband. Now, this. What's next, recruiting
Strom Thurmond to shinny up the statehouse dome in South Carolina
to fetch the Confederate flag?)
</P>
<P>
   Helms is, of course, rather well known at the United Nations for
describing it as a haven for ``cry babies,'' among other things.
He's also Big Daddy Deadbeat, the prime supporter of the U.S.
effort to stiff the landlord for nearly $1 billion in dues.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, it appears the meeting went smoothly, all things
considered. Helms read from a loose-leaf notebook, joked about
getting an interpreter for his Southern drawl, banged on the table
a few times, and threatened to pull the United States out of the
United Nations unless folks start doing things his way. As
Holbrooke said, ``It was something.''
</P>
<P>
   The warmest reception apparently came from Qin Huasun, the
Chinese ambassador, who allowed that the senator might have a point
about the United Nations needing to show, ahem, ``respect for
sovereignty'' and ``nonintervention in internal affairs.'' You go,
Jesse! Stand yourself in front of that Chinese fellow's tank, which
is, um, none of our business!
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Washington, pugilist Gingrich was practicing the
art of diplomacy at the American Enterprise Institute, a
conservative think tank. As part of what appears to be an effort to
rehabilitate his battered reputation, he delivered a speech titled,
``Reflections of a Private Citizen.'' (I didn't catch Gingrich's
speech myself. I wanted to go, but my mistress couldn't make it, so
I just stayed home with the missus.)
</P>
<P>
   As his companion, Callista Bisek, looked on, Gingrich lamented
that political partisanship is holding Washington back from
embracing a number of grand, visionary, history-changing
initiatives, including _ coincidentally _ a few of his own.
</P>
<P>
   One initiative, it seems, is learning how to get along with
others. There's simply not enough cooperation in Washington, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people will pay more and more attention to the
positive role of change and less to bickering,'' he told the
audience. This big idea comes _ as Salon magazine noted _ from a
fellow who once told a group of Republican college kids, ``I think
one of the great problems we have in the Republican Party is that
we don't encourage you to be nasty.''
</P>
<P>
   And rounding out a notable week in peacekeeping was pugilist
Tyson, who _ apparently unbeknownst to the U.N. Security Council _
is threatening to move to London.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson is in Great Britain training for a fight with some guy
named Julius. According to The London Times, Tyson finds life in
Merry Olde much more civilized and hospitable than here in the
United States. In fact, on this subject, you might say he was
chewing folks' ears off.
</P>
<P>
   ``America, I don't believe, is developed enough and
sophisticated enough to deal with the sensitivity of human
beings,'' Tyson told a group of boxing writers.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Helms, Tyson seems to fancy foreigners. ``You have to
understand that Europe has been around intelligently since Attila
the Hun,'' he told the writers. ``I want to move here ... I feel
more at home here than at home. People haven't had enough chance to
get familiar with me, close to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes. There may be something to his last point. Among these
three early contenders for this year's Nobel Peace Prize, pugilist
Tyson has my vote. He seems a tad less punch-drunk.

JUDGE SAYS TATTOOING A FORM OF FREE SPEECH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RALPH RANALLI  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In a ruling that may signal the beginning of the end
for the state ban on tattooing, a judge for the first time has
ruled that tattoo artists are practicing a
constitutionally-protected form of free speech.
</P>
<P>
   The precedent-setting decision could affect a landmark civil
case about to be argued in Suffolk County, where the American Civil
Liberties Union has asked a different judge to declare the
38-year-old tattoo ban unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected decision by Essex County Superior Court Judge
Allan van Gestel, and the impending ACLU case, have some
legislators warning that the state could experience an unregulated
tattoo free-for-all if a bill to legalize and regulate tattoo
parlors is not passed soon.
</P>
<P>
   Tattooing has been a criminal offense in Massachusetts --
punishable by a $300 fine, a year in jail, or both -- since 1962,
when the Legislature banned it after a hepatitis scare.
</P>
<P>
   A bill currently before the House Ways and Means Committee would
legalize tattooing in Massachusetts, under Department of Public
Health regulation.
</P>
<P>
   But if the ACLU wins its summary judgment motion before the bill
passes, tattoo parlors could legally operate without state
supervision, State Rep. David Tuttle said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to see the courts rule in favor of the tattoo artists
without us doing something first,'' said Tuttle, (R-Barre). ``It's
a public health issue and we have to do something to protect the
public out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the lawyers in the case admit that van Gestel's sweeping
constitutional ruling, issued as part of pretrial proceedings in a
juvenile rape case, was unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   Richard T. Meuse of Salem, was arrested last year for allegedly
raping his 13-year-old niece. The Essex County District Attorney's
office also charged that Meuse, an underground tattoo artist, had
illegally tattooed the girl and two other female relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Based on just a short brief by Meuse's defense attorney, Susan
Oker, and no filing by prosecutors, van Gestel threw the tattooing
charges against Muese out of court last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The absolute prohibition of all forms of tattooing, a
protected form of expression, except by licensed physicians, not
themselves generally known to be tattoo artists, is substantial
overbreadth,'' van Gestel said in his eight-page ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The judge rejected a traditional argument used by oppponents:
that tattoos only constitute free expression for the wearer, not
the tattoo artist. The recent mainstreaming of the industry, he
said, has more than legitimized the tattoo as an art form.
</P>
<P>
   In his ruling, van Gestel quoted a web site --
www.tattooartist.com -- which reported that tattooing has evolved
from an ``anti-social activity'' in the 1960s to a ``trendy fashion
statement'' in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Internet report, ``the single fastest growing
demographic group seeking tattoo services is, to the surprise of
many, middle-class suburban women.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge also took note of recent photographs in the Arts &AMP;
Leisure Section of the New York Times, which depicted the opening
of a show called ``Body Art: Marks of Identity'' at New York's
Museum of Natural History.
</P>
<P>
   ``The accompanying photographs of the opening gala depicted
several of the Manhattan glitterati decked out in their own
fashion-statement tattoos,'' van Gestel wrote in his decision.
</P>
<P>
   Would-be tattoo purveyors called the ruling long overdue.
</P>
<P>
   ``If tattooing were legal, we would be offering them the day
after,'' said Gil Delcastillo, the 49-year-old owner of the Jewelry
Gallery, a body-piercing shop in Harvard Square. ``The line would
be out the door, down the street, and around the corner.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling is not binding on the judge in the Suffolk County
case, where the ACLU is asking that the law be declared invalid
statewide. The suit was filed on behalf of two tattoo artists.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey Schwartz, who will argue the case for the ACLU next
month, however, called van Gestel's ruling an ``exciting'' sign
that the state courts are leaning toward legalizing tattoo art.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a profound decision that should be followed to
the letter,'' Schwartz said.

SOUTH AFRICA PLANS TO PRIVATIZE LARGE STATE COMPANIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By HENRI E. CAUVIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Eager to capitalize on a run of
favorable economic forecasts, South Africa is promising to expand
the privatization of its state companies in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   The country's efforts, which had focused on restructuring and
privatizing some of the state's many smaller assets, will now be
aimed at the biggest government-run companies _ its electric,
transportation, telecommunications and military-equipment concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, these companies _ Eskom, Transnet, Telkom South
Africa and Denel respectively _ are valued at close to $20 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Sivi Gounden, director general of the department of public
enterprises, said in an interview Monday that ``having reviewed our
efforts on restructuring and privatization over the past four
years, we felt that any acceleration needed to target the big four
enterprises.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the services those enterprises provide,''
Gounden added, ``the number of people they employ and the capital
they require, it's clear why.''
</P>
<P>
   The reach of these companies extends beyond South Africa into
much of the southern part of the continent, and the effects of
their restructuring will undoubtedly ripple across the region.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Telkom, the country's phone company, and South African
Airways, a subsidiary of Transnet Ltd., have sold minority stakes
to foreign investors. In April, the government will lay out a plan
for bringing considerably more foreign capital into the big state
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Among the issues the government is grappling with in drawing up
the plan is the considerable debt being carried by some state
enterprises, Gounden said. For example, Transnet, the vast web of
transportation operations controlled by the government, is more
than $4 billion in debt.
</P>
<P>
   For the companies to attract investors, some of their debt may
have to be assumed by the government, and exactly how much of it to
take on is now under review by economic policy makers. ``If we are
going to draw in strategic equity partners,'' Gounden said, ``we
need to look at the balance sheets and make them attractive.''
</P>
<P>
   How the privatization plans play out with the country's powerful
unions will be important as well. The strong ties between labor and
the ruling African National Congress have shown some signs of
fraying of late, and while the unions know that restructuring is
essential, they plan to follow the process closely, fearing that
jobs could be lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't argue against restructuring,'' Mukoni Ratshitanga,
the spokesman for the Congress of South African Trade Unions, said.
While acknowledging that the big state-run companies have problems,
he said, ``the issue for us is how we go about restructuring
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Kristin Lindow, the lead South Africa analyst for Moody's
Investors Service, said the government had been laying the
groundwork for selling its biggest assets for quite a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that it is very likely that we'll see some of this
happen in the first half of this year,'' Ms. Lindow said in a
telephone interview from New York. ``They know how important it is
to capitalize on the momentum that has built up over the last 18
months. It's time to show that you're really serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Moody's issued an optimistic report on South
Africa's economic prospects, and earlier this month, J. Mark
Mobius, emerging markets chief for Templeton Investment Management,
named South Africa his pick for the top emerging market in 2000.

 &HT;    Candles offer light alternative when power goes out
 &HT;    By Jeffry Scott
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Small wonder minor baby booms follow big power
outtages: Nothing is quite as romantic _ or flattering _ as
candlelight.
</P>
<P>
   On a less libidinous note, a candle can't power a TV or a video
game or a home computer. It can, however, fire the imagination and
rekindle that most elemental form of entertainment: holding
conversations with the people you live with.
</P>
<P>
   It can also provide enough light to get by with. Recall that
before electricity, people used candles all the time without
thinking themselves deprived.
</P>
<P>
   The average dinner candle gives off only one-seventieth the
amount of light of a 60-watt bulb. But that's enough to read by
without hurting your eyes, says Atlanta ophthalmologist David
Badawi.
</P>
<P>
   So get reacquainted with Poe, or finish that new bestseller.
</P>
<P>
   The National Candle Association recommends common-sense caution:
Never leave a lit candle unattended, and always use a candle
holder.

 &HT;    Protect plants from subfreezing temperatures
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Lend a tree a hand while it's down.
</P>
<P>
   And while you're at it, toss some cover on tender plants because
a week of subfreezing nights lies ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend's winter storm caused extensive damage to trees and
shrubs throughout the metro area and in North Georgia. Some trees
were beset by falling limbs, while ice simply left others with a
sad case of the droops.
</P>
<P>
   ``The freezing rain added tremendous weight to the limbs of
evergreen trees such as pine, cedar, Leyland cypress and southern
magnolia,'' said Walter Reeves, horticulture educator for the
University of Georgia Cooperative Extension Service.
</P>
<P>
   He offered these tips for repairing the damage:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Make clean cuts: Use a pruning saw or hand pruners to cut
splintered wood back to solid plant tissue. If the break occurred
near another healthy limb, trim the damaged limb back to a point
1/4 to 1 1/2-inch from the good limb.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Leave no stubs: If a limb broke close to the tree trunk,
remove the stub because it's a perfect hiding place for insects and
disease.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Maintain the branch collar: Never cut off a limb flush with
the tree trunk. Make your cut at the surface of the raised collar
where the limb emerges, leaving a ``bump.'' Tissue will swell and
enclose the wound within a few years.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Support drooping limbs: Slightly bent limbs will recover, but
severely drooping ones need support. Make a ``Y''-shaped crutch
from a fallen branch and prop it under the limb until it regains
its posture.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Splint bowed tops: Make a splint from 2-by-2 lumber to
straighten small trees with limber tops. Tie the support to the
trunk in several places using wide nylon belting or old leather
belts. (Pines that lost their tops and most limbs won't recover
because unlike broad-leafed trees, they don't sprout new limbs.)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, don't forget to protect tender plants from freezing
temperatures. Overnight lows in the metro area are expected to dip
into the low 20s at least through Friday, according to the National
Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
   Buds on early-spring blooming shrubs and trees such as
forsythia, quince, Bradford pear and Japanese cherry should
tolerate the freeze, Reeves said. But other plants will need help,
such as:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Emerging bulbs: The shoots of spring-flowering bulbs, such as
crocuses and daffodils, should not be harmed, but a light
sprinkling of pine straw won't hurt them.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Budding shrubs: Cover camellias and tender shrubs that are
budding, such as gardenias, with black plastic, anchored to the
ground with bricks or stone. Cover hydrangeas on which new growth
has emerged. ``The cold won't kill the hydrangea but could kill the
buds and give you fewer flowers this spring,'' Reeves said.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Winter annuals: Water evergreen plants and winter annuals,
such as pansies, because winds can cause dehydration.

 &HT;    Food saftey after the lights go out
 &HT;    By Betty Parham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You have a $15 roast in your freezer, and the power has been out
since Sunday. Should you pitch it?
</P>
<P>
   According to Judy Harrison of the University of Georgia's
College of Family and Consumer Sciences, ``the old adage, `If in
doubt throw it out,' is still a good rule to go by.''
</P>
<P>
   But you may not need to. Here are some answers to frequently
asked questions, from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, that may
help you figure out what to do with that roast and other foods you
may have had in your refrigerator or freezer while you were in the
dark.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can I refreeze food items that have been partly thawed?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, providing they still contain ice crystals or have
maintained a temperature of 40 degrees (refrigerator temperature)
or below for no more than two to three days. You will have to
evaluate each item separately. Food that has been above 40 degrees
for more than two hours should be discarded.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will there be any loss of quality in refrozen foods?
</P>
<P>
   A: Possibly. Raw meats and poultry, as well as fruit juices, can
be refrozen without too much quality loss. But the texture of
prepared foods, vegetables and fruits may suffer.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What about items in the refrigerator?
</P>
<P>
   A: In general, refrigerated items should be safe as long as
power was out no more than four hours. Keep the door closed as much
as possible. Discard any perishable foods such as meat, poultry,
fish, eggs or leftovers that have been above 40 degrees for two
hours or more, and any food that has an unusual odor, color or
texture or feels warm to the touch.
</P>
<P>
   Other foods that should be discarded: opened, creamy-based salad
dressings, opened spaghetti sauce, cut fresh fruits, soft cheese,
opened baby formula, cooked vegetables and refrigerator biscuits.
Foods that should be safe: ketchup, mustard, raw vegetables,
vinegar-based dressings, peanut butter, butter or margarine, hard
cheeses, olives, opened canned fruit, fruit juice and quick breads.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If I keep the door shut as much as possible, how long will it
take for the contents of my freezer to defrost?
</P>
<P>
   A: A full freezer will stay at freezing temperature for about
two days, a half-full freezer about one day. Dry ice will extend
the period food will stay frozen.
</P>
<P>
   FOR MORE INFORMATION
</P>
<P>
   If you have specific questions, call your local family and
consumer science agent at your county extension office.
</P>
<P>
   Call the toll-free USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline at
1-800-535-4555.
</P>
<P>

food products, go to www.usda.gov.fsis and click on

IOWA OVER, CANDIDATES EXPECTED TO PUMP UP NEW HAMPSHIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Now, it gets intense.
</P>
<P>
   As he arrives on the heels of losing the Iowa caucuses, former
Senator Bill Bradley plans to spend his week fighting back against
Vice President Al Gore. In a speech in Hudson in a television ad
featuring Niki Tsongas, and through congressional surrogates such
as Senator Bob Kerrey and Representatives Anna Eshoo and Luis
Gutierrez, Bradley will be drawing contrasts and getting aggressive
during the last week before the New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill will be talking about the lessons he's learned in Iowa,
that you've got to fight back,'' said Mark Longabaugh, Bradley's
state director. ``You will see that in a very aggressive fashion in
the next seven days. He will take that campaign to the people in a
very assertive fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   In the remaining days here, each of the Republican and
Democratic candidates will be making their final sales pitch,
trying to close the deal with the voters of New Hampshire. Some
will stick to themes they have been laying out for the last year,
while others, like Bradley, will try to shake up the race with a
new line of attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the week when, after all the build-up, the electorate
really goes into its buying mode,'' said Thomas D. Rath, who is
advising Texas Governor George W. Bush. ``This is the week when we
stop kicking the tires and start making selections. Candidacies and
political futures are very much on the line here.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, voters will be paying more attention, the
media will be swarming after the candidates like locusts, and
volunteers will be knocking on doors and dropping off literature
like lemmings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be bedlam,'' predicted Mike Dennehy, the New
England director for Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican.
``This is when everyone living in New Hampshire, ages 2 to 92, is
paying attention.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, Bush will continue to talk about taxes
and education, appealing to registered Republican voters; McCain
will talk about leadership and foreign policy, revisiting towns
where he has strong independent support; and Steve Forbes will try
to carve into Bush's lead using a second-place win out of Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   For the Democrats, Bradley will be trying to pull out of his
downward slide in the polls with sharp words for Gore and a
barnstorming tour to each of the state's 10 counties. Gore, on the
other hand, will emphasize education, the economy and health care
as he travels to heavily Democratic population centers, such as
Portsmouth, Concord and the Connecticut River Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last week is going to be a more frenetic week than any
week that has preceded it,'' said Douglas Hattaway, a Gore
spokesman. ``We're trying to cover as much of the state as we
possibly can within the confines of the schedule, which includes
the debate and the State of the Union, not to mention the
Superbowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Most candidates will spend their time pumping up known
supporters and still trying to convert the fence-sitters. That last
category, however, is dwindling rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Of those planning to vote in the Republican primary, only 3
percent are still undecided, said Andy Smith, director of the
University of New Hampshire survey center. For the Democratic
primary, only 8 percent have yet to make up their mind.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith said there is still some flux in the race.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, 67 percent of voters said they are
certain about their decision, while 33 percent said they may still
change their mind. On the Democratic side, 72 percent of the voters
said their decision is firm, while 28 percent may yet have a change
of heart.
</P>
<P>
   While most candidates will be talking about issues, Patrick W.
Griffin, a Bush adviser, said the Texas governor will still be
introducing himself to voters as he plays catch-up to McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message is really to say to people, you need to know more
about me as a person,'' Griffin said. ``Not only know what I think,
but how I deal with this, how I respond to the week between Iowa
and New Hampshire.''

`IN THE GLOAMING': SETTLING SADLY FOR SECOND BEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (Editors: Publication notes appear at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alice Elliott Dark's characters live in a privileged world
that's situated somewhere between Cheever's haunted suburbs and
Philip Barry's snooty Main Line. It's a world where people have at
least one country house (if not two: a summer retreat and another
for winter getaways), a world where it's assumed that life will
follow a certain path _ ``marriage to someone like-minded,''
children raised with fondly remembered traditions and adherence to
lots of social rituals that are supposed to keep ``chaos and
breakdown'' at bay.
</P>
<P>
   Of course chaos and breakdown intrude on this world anyway, and
in story after story in this uneven collection Ms. Dark catches her
well-bred, well-mannered characters in moments of extremis, when
their guard is down and they are forced, by illness or mortality,
divorce or disillusion, to re-evaluate their lives.
</P>
<P>
   As in her last collection (``Naked to the Waist,'' 1991), the
weaker stories in this volume tend to rely too insistently on
sudden ironic plot twists to expose her characters' illusions,
twists and turns that underscore Ms. Dark's authorial role as an O.
Henryesque puppeteer. ``The Tower'' pivots around the revelation
that the hero's new girlfriend is the daughter of one of his former
lovers, that she may in fact be his daughter. ``The Jungle Lodge''
concludes with a nasty revelation of sexual molestation.
</P>
<P>
   In her more persuasive tales Ms. Dark does not try to
stage-manage her characters' lives, but instead allows their
stories to unfold slowly, moving backward and forward in time, from
hope back into memory, from confusion back into nostalgia.
``Home,'' for instance, creates an affecting portrait of an elderly
woman named Lil, who has spent her life deferring to _ and
protecting _ her headstrong husband, Gordon, only to find that he
has signed her into a retirement home against her will, removing
her from the house that she has cherished for 50-odd years. It is a
development that will cause Lil to reassess her lifelong habit of
submission and self-effacement.
</P>
<P>
   Although the title story, ``In the Gloaming,'' has all the
ingredients of a made-for-television movie _ it was made into a
1997 HBO film starring Glenn Close and Robert Sean Leonard _ it
transcends the cliches of its subject to become a moving portrait
of a mother and her son, who is dying of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The story, which was selected by John Updike as one of ``best
American short stories of the century,'' limns the nervous, almost
flirtatious banter between the two, as the son tries to tease his
reticent mother into talking about her life, and she parries his
questions while silently reviewing the frustrations of her chilly
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Such empty, disappointing marriages are the focus of several of
these stories. ``Dreadful Language'' chronicles the life of a
painter named Frannie, who makes a safe, conventional marriage
after the love of her life dies in a freak accident. While she
tells herself that a partnership of shared aims _ ``children,
peace'' _ should be sufficient for a fulfilling life, she soon
realizes that she has made the same compromises as her mother, that
she has tried to substitute comfort for emotional connection,
kindness for real passion.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret, the heroine of ``Maniacs,'' has made a similar
mistake. Having resigned herself never to consummate her love for a
man named Jerome _ a man her outgoing sister, Diana, has
desultorily dated for years _ she starts seeing a dull, wealthy
man, who does nothing to disqualify himself as a suitor. Eventually
she marries him, gives up law school and has two children. She
never tells anyone about Jerome, though she saves her teen-age
diaries, chronicling her love for him, in the attic. After all, she
thinks, she is the responsible sister, the one who has defined
herself by duty and self-sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   In these stories Ms. Dark uses her sure knowledge of her
characters' inner lives to delineate the complicated mathematics of
familial love and resentment, particularly the ways in which
husbands and wives, mothers and daughters and closely matched but
competitive sisters vie for control. In the stories where she
trades this earnest, uninflected voice for something more coyly
sarcastic, the results are decidedly less convincing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Secret Spot,'' which recounts a woman's efforts to get
revenge on a rival she suspects of having had designs on her
husband, is a thin, brittle little tale with a disagreeable and
oddly generic heroine. ``Watch the Animals,'' which employs a royal
``we'' voice to convey a community's disapproval of a local
eccentric, provides a thoroughly predictable portrait of a
snobbish, upper-crust town.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dark does not put enough spin or body language on her
observations here to turn them into effective satire; consequently
these stories feel like arch, disposable exercises in conveying an
unsympathetic point of view. They not only disappoint as simple
examples of craft, but they fail to use the author's considerable
gifts of empathy on display elsewhere in this volume.

 &HT;    Anthony Dorsett aims to cash in on rare start
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Anthony Dorsett got a taste of tailback when he
started playing football.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think I got tired of being hit,'' Tony Dorsett's son
said, ``so I changed position, and everything worked out well for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorsett will make his second pro career start, in the Super
Bowl, as the strong safety of the Tennessee Titans. The Dorsetts
also will become the first father and son to play in the Super
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   But Anthony isn't satisfied with that achievement. ``My dad has
a ring and I don't,'' Dorsett said. ``And I'd like to be able to
sit at the kitchen table with him and show off my ring to him, just
like he shows off his to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorsett was 4 years old, barely aware that his father ran with a
football for a living, when Dallas beat Denver 27-10 in Super Bowl
XII in 1978. Dorsett Sr. also played in the 35-31 loss to
Pittsburgh the following year.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad told me after we beat Jacksonville the second time that
he would see me in Atlanta,'' Dorsett said. His father missed the
AFC Championship Game because he had commitments at the Hula Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Dorsett is replacing Marcus Robertson, who suffered a broken leg
in the second quarter of Sunday's 33-14 win over Jacksonville.
Dorsett had four tackles and one pass defensed in the second half
against the Jaguars.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I go out there and play well, I might be able to put some
of that to rest, as far as being Junior, but it's always going to
be that I'm Anthony Jr.,'' Dorsett said. ``My dad's a Hall of
Famer, Heisman Trophy winner, Super Bowl winner, Pro Bowler _
everything. Whatever you can accomplish in football, he
accomplished it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorsett still has a big check-off list. In four years with
Tennessee, he has distinguished himself primarily as a
special-teams player. He is one of two ``gunners'' on the punt- and
kickoff-return units; they line up near the sideline and fight a
double team while trying to get to the return specialist or force
him inside.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Dorsett was named a Pro Bowl alternate. After the
season, he becomes an unrestricted free agent, and he hopes that
his defensive work Sunday will raise his value.
</P>
<P>
   He also started at free safety on Jan. 2 while Robertson was
recovering from facial injuries incurred in a motorcycle accident.
Fittingly, the game was in Pittsburgh, where his father is still an
icon and where the son also attended college, becoming a starting
cornerback his senior year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little Hawk'' had five tackles against the Steelers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time I go home back to Pittsburgh, (his birthplace)
Aliquippa, I'm still 'Little Hawk,' '' Dorsett said; his father was
``Hawkeye'' because of his exceptional vision. ``It doesn't matter
how big I'm going to get. I'm Anthony Jr., and that's just the way
it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorsett, now 5 feet 11 and 200 pounds, said that it wasn't until
he got to college that he began to appreciate and respect what his
father did as a 185-pound running back _ ``things that a lot of
guys can't even accomplish these days,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growing up,'' he said, ``it was always a case where, 'That's
just my dad.' I never looked at him as being Tony Dorsett.''
</P>
<P>
   The younger Dorsett doesn't lack his father's confidence.
``Basically, every time I've had a chance to get in a game and do
something, I've done well,'' he said. ``There hasn't been a
letdown.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said, ``We've got some key backups out here that a lot
of people don't even know about.''
</P>
<P>
   With this backup-turned-starter, they at least always knew the
name.

   NAFAH, Golan Heights _ Under torrential rains, Israeli tanks
advanced toward Syrian territory on Monday, exhaling plumes of
smoke into the mist that draped the valley. Then they advanced
again and again _ until it was a wrap.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking shelter in a trailer, an Israeli soldier with a ragged
stump of an arm smoked a cigarette and watched idly. A makeup
artist with mud-caked boots wordlessly touched up another soldier's
chopped-meat face with red food coloring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Die! Die now!'' Amos Gitai commanded through his megaphone as
a body on a stretcher fell back inert. Under his wool cap, Gitai,
one of Israel's few internationally acclaimed filmmakers, smiled.
</P>
<P>
   For an Israeli director, cast and crew to re-enact the traumatic
October War of 1973 at a site of heavy combat is intensely
sobering. But to rev up the old Centurion tanks at the precise
moment that Israel is proceeding toward peace with Syria charges
the movie-making experience with the feeling of a historical
undertaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could happen only once in a lifetime,'' said Shuki
Friedman, the Israeli producer for the Israeli-French-Italian
co-production. ``To shoot the Yom Kippur War on the Golan Heights
while we're talking peace with Syria _ it's like seeing 27 years
flash before your eyes and come to closure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Kippur'' is a deeply personal film for Gitai, 49, who is a
veteran of the war. It is also believed to be the first
feature-length war movie ever made about the 1973 conflict. Every
other Israeli war provoked enough films to constitute a genre,
especially the war of 1967, which produced a sense of euphoric
invincibility in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   But that feeling evaporated during the war that began six years
later on Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement. Egyptian and
Syrian forces mounted surprise attacks on the Israeli-held Sinai
peninsula and Golan Heights and fought furiously on two fronts at
once. It has never been easy for Israelis to discuss, digest or
move beyond the war that cost them their self-assuredness and more
than 2,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Noach Faran, who commands the reserve military units
that operate the real tanks in the movie, said: ``Nobody wanted to
touch this war before. But when we're facing peace, it's the right
time to remember.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because if the peace doesn't work, there will be another war.
And the tank crews in this movie, they'll be doing the fighting for
real.''
</P>
<P>
   Gitai enlisted the army's cooperation because there was no way
to have a shootout without them. No one undertakes tanks maneuvers,
helicopter crashes and massive pyrotechnics near the Syrian border
without the active participation _ and equipment _ of the Israeli
Defense Forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``In no other country would we have received cooperation from
the army to make what is an antiwar movie,'' said Michel Propper, a
French producer. ``But here, as you know, the generals are on the
left.''
</P>
<P>
   The generals also knew Gitai's personal story, on which the film
is based, and they believed that it empowered him to speak with
authority, the producers said.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1973, when the sirens sounded announcing the start of
the war, Gitai was a 22-year-old architecture student in Haifa. He
piled into an old Fiat with an army buddy and drove to the Golan,
where they talked their way into a helicopter rescue unit that
swooped in and out of battles to collect the wounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``How we hurried to go to war!'' Gitai's narrator says at the
beginning of the film. ``How impatient we were! My war lasted five
days, 120 hours of blood and tears, chaos and pain, on the Golan
Heights. Something went wrong. So many wounded and dead. That's the
war I'm telling you about now. Their war. My story.''
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 11, Gitai's 23rd birthday, his unit was flying east to
rescue a pilot downed in Syrian territory when a missile hit the
helicopter. In a fraction of a second, the front exploded, the
co-pilot was dead, the engineer was badly wounded, the aircraft was
trembling and they were all shouting and crying, he said. He felt a
chill on his back, touched it and found his hand covered with
blood. The bullet missed his spine by a fraction of an inch.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot, who was also shot, steered the helicopter back over
the Israeli line, where it crashed. The engineer was catapulted
from his seat into the engine, killing him. Another soldier, afraid
that they had landed in Syrian territory, tried to run away on what
remained of his legs.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Gitai said, there was silence, ``almost a pastoral
silence, with birds.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At the start of the war, I thought I'd get killed,'' he said.
``But when they shot us, I was kind of relieved because what I had
expected to happen had happened. I watched it all like a scene in a
movie.''
</P>
<P>
   A calm, soft-spoken man, Gitai talked under a tarp at his
re-created battleground, where a steady downpour had turned the
rocky clay earth into a mud swamp. The weather was fitting since he
sought to recreate the Valley of Tears in northern Golan, where the
war's worst battle was fought. After eight hours on a cold, wet
set, he seemed unfazed by the ankle-deep brown puddles and
boot-sucking gunk. As long as the cameras remained dry under their
umbrellas and the bloody severed limbs were kept in baggies, he was
happy with the fictional world he had created and controlled.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the deal with the wounded?'' Gitai yelled. ``Can I get
a stretcher here, please? Shai, get the guy with the arm, not the
guy with the head.''
</P>
<P>
   But the tank crews refused to take directions from the director.
Gitai issued his film direction to their commander, who barked it
to them over an army radio. ``They are like goats, and I'm their
goatherd,'' Faran explained.
</P>
<P>
   Explosions on the hillside did not cause anyone on the set to
jump, but the Golan settlers were initially quite alarmed by the
battle sounds.
</P>
<P>
   The vividness of Gitai's war experience, and the questions it
raised for him, eventually led him to abandon architecture for
filmmaking so he could record and question history and ``touch
nerves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But for years, Gitai said he carried his war story around inside
him, unprepared to put it on film. In the late 1970s and early
'80s, when he was making leftist documentaries that were often
censored, he did not want to be seen as using his experience to
show his Zionist credentials, he said.
</P>
<P>
   When he started making feature films, he ranged broadly through
subject matter on budgets that would have been too low to produce a
good army movie. The success of his most recent film, ``Kadosh,'' a
haunting depiction of life inside a deeply Orthodox community in
Jerusalem, allowed his French producers to raise enough money _ $5
million _ to make ``Kippur.''
</P>
<P>
   When Israeli-Syrian negotiations resumed, Propper, the producer,
pushed Gitai to start filming immediately. Given the quick
turnaround time of their films, they expect to finish it by May _
``in time for Cannes and, who knows, maybe for a peace agreement,''
Gitai said.

   Experts see job cuts for Coke
</P>
<P>
   By Henry Unger
</P>
<P>
   and David McNaughton
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola is not immune to the ups and downs of
business nor, analysts think, reluctant to use a common solution:
downsizing.
</P>
<P>
   So don't be surprised if even an industry giant like Coca-Cola
cuts a substantial number of jobs, as many analysts expect it to do
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But while downsizing has become a fact of life on Main Street,
analysts think Coca-Cola has been slower than most in taking out
the knife. The rest of corporate America, meanwhile, was cutting an
estimated 5 million jobs in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola got around to studying its entire global business
system early last year, Morgan Stanley analyst Andrew Conway said.
He thinks Chairman M. Douglas Ivester started the review process
about nine months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Doug Ivester and his team spent many months assessing
global growth prospects going forward in light of the large ramp-up
in personnel between 1993 and 1998,'' Conway said. ``The global
economic crisis and the lower near-term growth prospects demand
that Coca-Cola has a more nimble cost structure.''
</P>
<P>
   So does Wall Street, said John A. Challenger, chief executive of
the Chicago-based outplacement firm Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, there are few companies that don't go through some
downsizing periodically,'' Challenger said. Companies, he noted,
``are being driven by Wall Street to produce much higher earnings,
quarter by quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   The pressure _ and the planning _ for layoffs doesn't happen
immediately, Challenger said. But he added sometimes one event can
trigger the downsizing, such as a change at the top.
</P>
<P>
   Since Ivester announced his premature retirement on Dec. 6, the
focus has shifted to the executive who will replace him in April,
Doug Daft. But analysts say there is virtually no way for Daft to
have initiated a decision to cut jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A company like Coca-Cola is not going to make a move of laying
off people overnight,'' said Manny Goldman, global beverage analyst
with Merrill Lynch. ``Six weeks is overnight. This started under
Doug Ivester.''
</P>
<P>
   So why cut jobs now?
</P>
<P>
   After all, analysts are talking about the possibility of
substantial staff reductions. Some believe Coke will reduce its
29,000-member global workforce by some 2,000 jobs, including 600 in
Atlanta. The last significant layoff in Atlanta was 12 years ago,
affecting only about 200 of the company's employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company's earnings have been under pressure the last
couple of years,'' Goldman said. ``When earnings get under
pressure, companies step back and look at the business. They
re-evalute it to improve the business.''
</P>
<P>
   In this case, if the company does cut 2,000 jobs, it would save
about $150 milllion a year in labor costs, estimated Bill
Pecoriello, an analyst with Sanford Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   But Pecoriello said the company may be cutting jobs for a reason
beyond cost savings. He cited the consolidation in Coke's bottling
system as a driving force in the expected downsizing.
</P>
<P>
   To understand why the bottling system is crucial, it's first
important to understand how it is organized.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola, which is based on North Avenue, is essentially a
giant marketing machine. While it produces the syrupy concentrate
used to make Coke, Sprite and other brands, it doesn't put the
carbonation in those soft drinks, nor does it can or bottle the
product. That's done by bottlers around the world that then
distribute the drinks to retailers.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, however, there has been a major consolidation
in Coke's bottling system, with the big operators like
Atlanta-based Coca-Cola Enterprises gobbling up many little ones
around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Pecoriello said, ``there are fewer points of
contact with the bottlers and less coordination needed from
Coca-Cola.''
</P>
<P>
   That means fewer employees may be needed. Pecoriello said the
reduction in jobs is likely to be at the field level, where
Coca-Cola's sales and marketing staff may be duplicating work now
being performed by some big bottlers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coke has a structure in place to deal with more bottlers than
they have now,'' Pecoriello added. ``Handshaking with bottlers is
much simpler now.''

P&AMP;G DROPS QUEST FOR 2 DRUGMAKERS; GILLETTE SHARES RISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble Co., which makes everything from Crest
toothpaste to Pepto-Bismol, has ended talks to buy drugmakers
Warner-Lambert Co. and American Home Products Corp., reportedly
after an earlier attempt by P&AMP;G to acquire Gillette Co. was
rebuffed.
</P>
<P>
   While some Wall Street analysts think P&AMP;G will now try to buy
another pharmaceutical company, shares of Gillette stock rose 1 7/8
to close at 40 7/8 after P&AMP;G said it would no longer pursue a $140
billion stock purchase of Warner-Lambert and American Home
Products.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a historically weak stock price, Gillette may be in a
vulnerable position, and it may be an attractive target for P&AMP;G,
said analysts who follow the Boston maker of razor blades, Duracell
batteries, and other consumer products. In theory, a low stock
price might mean that Gillette could be bought for a bargain price.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette declined to comment on any speculation about a possible
acquisition. Nor would it comment on a Wall Street Journal story
Monday which reported that P&AMP;G had made an overture to Gillette
that was rejected.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Cincinnati-based P&AMP;G said the consumer-products
giant continues to look for acquisition targets, but declined to
discuss the companies it might be interested in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Acquisitions are very much a part of our growth strategy,''
said P&AMP;G spokesman Simon Denegri.
</P>
<P>
   With everything seemingly up in the air, Wall Street analysts
sketched out a wide range of possible scenarios.
</P>
<P>
   One had P&AMP;G buying Warner-Lambert's portfolio of consumer
brands, which includes Schick razors, a Gillette rival. Another
suggested that P&AMP;G might consider buying Eli Lilly &AMP; Co. or
Schering-Plough Corp., two pharmaceutical companies.
</P>
<P>
   P&AMP;G chief executive Durk Jager seems intent on making an
acquisition, analysts noted. P&AMP;G sales are growing at an anemic
rate of less than 3 percent a year, and an acquisition may offer
P&AMP;G the best hope of giving sales a big boost. Jager has said that
adding more pharmaceuticals to P&AMP;G's product lines could result in
the annual sales gains of 6 to 8 percent that he is seeking.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, at least, a P&AMP;G acquisition of Gillette might also
make sense, several analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   While P&AMP;G and Gillette sell different products, they sell them
to many of the same retail customers. In simplistic terms, the same
distribution system that delivers Crest toothpaste to a Wal-Mart or
a Stop &AMP; Shop could also deliver Mach3 razors and OralB
toothbrushes.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, P&AMP;G had sales of about $38 billion, and Gillette had
sales of just over $10 billion. A combination of the two could
create a global consumer-goods colossus that would have the
leverage and clout to deal with giant retail chains and to more
effectively market a wide array of products. A P&AMP;G strength _
supply-chain management _ also happens to be a Gillette weakness,
noted an investor who asked not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Two things make Gillette an attractive target for a company
large enough to swallow it, said Tony Vento, an analyst who follows
Gillette for Edward Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette's stock price is comparatively low, and Gillette owns
the dominant market position in the highly profitable and growing
businesses of razors and batteries, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure they'd love to buy Gillette,'' Vento said of P&AMP;G.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring, Gillette had a market value of about $64 billion,
but that value has declined to just under $44 billion. After
turning in double-digit earnings gains for many years, Gillette has
recently failed to meet Wall Street's expectations, and its stock
has been punished.
</P>
<P>
   Among Gillette's challenges have been stagnant economies in some
key overseas markets and the subpar performance of its stationery
and small appliance product lines, which Gillette is now looking to
sell or discontinue.
</P>
<P>
   Something else could make Gillette an attractive target for P&AMP;G,
said Fredric E. Russell of Fredric E. Russell Management Co., which
has owned shares in Gillette since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Because P&AMP;G and Gillette make such different products, it's
unlikely that an acquisition would raise federal antitrust issues,
he said. Nevertheless, Russell said he expected Gillette to resist
any advances from P&AMP;G.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would expect Gillette to fight very vigorously because
Gillette is worth a lot more than $42 or $43 a share,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In ending acquisition talks with Warner-Lambert and American
Home Products, P&AMP;G cited a big drop in its own stock price since
the news of a possible deal became public.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market voted with their shares by selling,'' said Phil
Larkins, a market strategist with Legacy South Inc., which owns P&AMP;G
shares. ``They acquiesced to the desires of Wall Street. I think
they made a prudent decision.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, P&AMP;G chief executive Jager said, ``We concluded
that the leaks and resulting speculation on a possible transaction
created have created an environment in which we cannot continue
meaningful discussions.''

COMMENTARY: FORGET IOWA 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Words in bold should be set in italics.) 
(lb) 
 By GAIL COLLINS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The voters of Iowa have spoken. Don't listen.
</P>
<P>
   The Iowa caucuses are about as good a barometer of what the
public thinks as that Time Internet poll that named Elvis the
Person of the Century. A sliver of the registered voters in the
30th-largest state in the nation drove to their local school or
town hall Monday night, where the Republicans had a nonbinding
straw poll. The Democrats clustered into ``viable preference
groups,'' which were then translated into ``state delegate
equivalents.'' And on the basis of that, we're supposed to believe
that Bill Bradley's candidacy ...
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Stopstopstopstop. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The American people spent an entire century trying to wrest the
power to nominate presidential candidates out of the hands of the
party bosses, and now we're handing it over to Iowa? A state where
the most popular sporting events involve collegiate wrestling?
</P>
<P>
   If people take the Iowa results seriously, the losers will stop
getting campaign contributions, and the whole show could be over
after New Hampshire votes next week. Later, when  &UR; your &LR;  state has a
primary, nobody will come and write stories about your special
problems or peculiar taste in sports. You will not find George W.
Bush lurking at the corner coffee shop, or be quizzed about your
opinions by a reporter from Newsweek. You will not even see your
city skyline on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the current election timetable frequently point out
that African-Americans are cut out of the decision-making because
neither New Hampshire nor Iowa has many minority voters. While
that's obviously true, I've got to admit that the black residents I
ran into in Des Moines _ and they are three of the nicest folks you
ever met _ felt very strongly that as long as they were in Iowa,
they wanted it to be first.
</P>
<P>
   And why not? It's heady being the center of national attention
for something other than a school shooting. When caucus time
approaches, every special-interest group in the country starts
pouring money into the Iowa media, asking voters to think about gay
rights or teacher salaries or immigration. (This year's
anti-immigration radio ads, which opened with a sort of ``Soylent
Green'' outcry about overcrowding, warned Iowans that if something
wasn't done, their towns would wind up looking ``just like Los
Angeles.'' This does not actually seem to be a pending problem.)
</P>
<P>
   Even The Moscow Times was writing about Iowa this week _ the
Russians were fascinated with the Gary Bauer fund-raiser that
charged $250 for a visit to the eight-bedroom,
four-and-a-half-bathroom home of the McCaughey septuplets.
</P>
<P>
   The legend of the Iowa caucuses is that these are grass-roots
events that show politics the way it's supposed to be, with folks
gathering in the home of a neighbor to have wholesome arguments
about issues and the future of the Republic.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was when they were young and innocent,'' says Hugh
Winebrenner of Drake University. ``In '84, they'd say `Mondale
people in the bedroom, and Hart people go into the family room,'
and there'd be politicking and people trying to change minds and
going from one room to another. There were some great debates. Now
that doesn't take place.'' The meetings are now held in public
buildings, he says, and the focus is on getting some kind of a
quick head count that can be reported to the waiting media.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, we the media have corrupted Iowa, although in our defense
I must point out that before the packs of reporters and TV
technicians started showing up, the turnout was so low that nobody
even noticed that the democratic process was going on.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Carter came in first in 1976 with under 14,000 votes _ one
commentator pointed out that you needed more than that to get
elected to the Town Council in Oyster Bay, Long Island. And the
residents don't seem to mind our crowding in. ``Thank you for
coming to Iowa,'' they keep saying, in a show of universal
politeness that is yet another sign of the state's unrepresentative
character.
</P>
<P>
   If we can't stop having presidential caucuses in January, at
minimum we ought to share the wealth, and rotate the honor of being
first among all the large, rather empty states that otherwise have
to be flooded out to get noticed. Let's hear it for North Dakota in
2004.

 &HT;    Runyan supplies Bunyan-like force
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Many people have thought that the NFL's top offensive
tackles played in the AFC Central the past three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Jacksonville Jaguars' Tony Boselli and Leon Searcy have been
regarded as the league's best pair of offensive tackles since
Searcy joined the team as an unrestricted free agent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Tennessee Titans offensive tackles Brad Hopkins and
Jon Runyan have played in relative obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   But the Titans allowed only 25 sacks this season, third-fewest
in the league and 11 fewer than the Jaguars surrendered in 16
games. The Titans' offensive line also opened holes for running
back Eddie George, who rushed for a career-best 1,304 yards this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as notoriety and as far as recognition for doing the
job, it's going to always elude Jon and I, because we're just
blue-collar workers,'' Hopkins said. ``Maybe, if we went and
slapped old ladies around or kicked kids, we'd get in the papers.
We just don't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Runyan, 6 feet 7 and 320 pounds, is a budding star in his third
season as the starting right tackle. An All-Big Ten selection at
Michigan in 1995, Runyan left school with one year of eligibility
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Because of concerns about his quickness and pass-blocking
ability, Runyan slipped to the fourth round of the 1996 draft. He
was chosen by the Titans, then the Houston Oilers, with the 109th
pick overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kind of got under my skin a little bit,'' said Runyan, 26.
``I still haven't figured out why it happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Runyan arrived in Houston with the reputation of being a
powerful run-blocker. During his first mini-camp, he bench-pressed
315 pounds only six times, could not do a single dip and showed
little speed.
</P>
<P>
   He improved his strength and speed on special teams as a rookie,
before winning the right tackle job after veteran Irv Eatman
retired before the '97 season. Runyan beat out former Tennessee
star Jason Layman, who was picked two rounds ahead of him.
</P>
<P>
   Runyan has started 48 games in a row the past three seasons. On
Dec. 20, 1998, he held former Packers defensive end Reggie White
sackless in his final game at Green Bay's Lambeau Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're both physical guys, especially Jon,'' George said.
``They just love to play the game. They don't get a lot of
recognition, for reasons I don't know, but they do a great job
run-blocking and pass-protecting.''
</P>
<P>
   Runyan will be one of the the top unrestricted free agents
during the offseason. After falling in the draft, he earned an
average of $252,500 in his first three seasons. He made $1.2
million this season after signing a one-year contract. He stands to
make much more than that next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't sit there and complain about not getting any
recognition,'' Runyan said. ``You have to go out and earn respect
just by working hard and playing hard every game. You do that, the
other things will either come or they won't. It all works out in
the end.''

CONGRESS PUTS FIRST FOCUS ON CUBAN BOY
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Va., Vt., R.I., Ill., Mass., Fla.)  (With CUBAN-BOY) 
(nk) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress returned to work Monday after a two-month
recess, with House Democrats wounded by the defection of one of
their most conservative members, Virgil H. Goode Jr. of Virginia,
and lawmakers from both parties introducing bills to make Elian
Gonzalez a U.S. citizen.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate could vote on the citizenship bill as early as
Wednesday. Goode said he is switching to be an independent.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's events foreshadowed a campaign-compressed calendar that
is likely to be defined less by momentous legislative
accomplishments than by election-year trench warfare and narrowly
focused bills with popular, even emotional, appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Little floor action is expected until President Clinton delivers
his State of the Union address on Thursday. The Senate has its
first vote on Tuesday, on whether to cut off debate on a bill to
overhaul the nation's bankruptcy laws, legislation that was held
over from last year. The House has no votes scheduled this week.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere on Capitol Hill, many of the issues that will dominate
debate _ tax cuts, protecting Social Security, reducing the
national debt _ get their first official airing of the new year
when the Congressional Budget Office releases new estimates on the
federal budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Budget Committee will hold hearings Tuesday and
Wednesday to review the updated projections, which will be bigger
than anticipated for the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   The budget office will brief congressional staffers on the
estimates late Tuesday, and the numbers will be officially unveiled
when the office director, Dan Crippen, testifies before the budget
committee on Wednesday. On the same day, the Senate Banking
Committee will hold a hearing on the nomination of Alan Greenspan
to a fourth term as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.
</P>
<P>
   But the immediate focus of Congress this week is the fate of the
6-year-old Cuban boy who survived an accident last November that
killed his mother as they and others tried to make their way to the
United States in a boat that capsized. Elian was rescued after
clinging to an inner tube at sea for two days.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic and Republican lawmakers introduced three bills _ two
in the House and one in the Senate _ to grant Elian citizenship or
permanent residency. They said their legislation would put the
decision in the hands of a Florida state judge instead of the
federal Immigration and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., who sponsored the Senate bill with
five other lawmakers, said he wanted to take politics out of the
decision. But state judges in Florida are elected, and any judge in
the Miami area, where Elian is living with relatives, is likely to
face tremendous pressure to rule that the boy stay in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, the lead sponsor of a companion bill, Rep. Bill
McCollum, R-Fla., said, ``Any decision made by a governmental
agency is contrary to his best interest and clearly against his
mother's desires.''
</P>
<P>
   A bill proposed by House Democrats, including Robert Menendez of
New Jersey and Patrick J. Kennedy of Rhode Island, would grant
permanent residency instead of citizenship, to allow Elian to
decide his citizenship on his own when he is older.
</P>
<P>
   But another group of House members, including Charles B. Rangel,
D-N.Y., Barney Frank, D-Mass., and Ray LaHood, R-Ill., introduced a
nonbinding resolution to block the citizenship bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that this 6-year-old boy who lost his
mother in a tragic accident at sea should be reunited with his
father,'' Rangel said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   As lawmakers jousted over the boy's future, House Democrats
suffered a setback to their goal of reclaiming the chamber when
Goode announced he would run for re-election to a third term as an
independent.
</P>
<P>
   On major bills, Goode has voted more often with Republicans than
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, Republicans outnumber Democrats 222-211, with two
independents, Goode and Rep. Bernard Sanders of Vermont, who
usually votes with the Democrats.

INTERNEURON SUES FORMER REDUX DISTRIBUTOR AMERICAN HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Interneuron Pharmaceuticals Inc., developer of the controversial
diet drug Redux that was pulled off the market in September 1997,
has sued its marketing and distribution partner American Home
Products for fraud, misrepresentation, and breach of contract.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed in Middlesex (Mass.) Superior Court,
spotlights the simmering schism between the two companies that
followed the highly publicized removal and lawsuits surrounding
Redux, the first diet drug to be approved by the US Food and Drug
Administration in a dozen years. American Home Products also
stopped production of Pondimin, or fenfluramine, an older, related
obesity drug, and was hit with a nationwide class-action lawsuit by
weight-loss patients.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Interneuron, of Lexington, Mass., has laid off
employees, lost its major source of new revenues, and watched its
stock tumble from an all-time high of 42 after Redux gained FDA
approval in 1996 to less than 2 last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Interneuron shares closed at 3, up 9/16. AHP shares, which in
addition to the suit were affected by failed merger talks with
Procter &AMP; Gamble Co., closed Monday at 42, down 5 7/16.
</P>
<P>
   Interneuron, which is seeking unspecified treble damages, has
retained attorney David Boies, who successfully represented the
government in its antitrust trial against Microsoft Corp. His law
firm, Boies, Schiller &AMP; Flexner LLP, went to court only after
negotiations over Redux liability broke down, said attorney
Jonathan Schiller.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, a judge rejected a $70 million nationwide settlement of
former Redux users. AHP refused to pick up the tab for
Interneuron's drug liability, according a company official.
</P>
<P>
   ``We regret the necessity of having to sue AHP,'' said Boies in
a statement, adding that the large drugmaker's conduct ``has left
us with no other choice than litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for AHP said the company has acted properly in its
dealings with Interneuron.
</P>
<P>
   In its suit, Interneuron claims AHP did not reveal for nearly
five months that it had information from the Mayo Clinic in
Minneapolis that a dozen obese patients taking its
chemically-related weight-reduction drug called fenfluramine
together with another obesity drug called phentermine had shown
signs of heart-valve problems. The combination, called
``fen-phen,'' was enormously popular, earning AHP significant
profits for fenfluramine, known as Pondimin, with similar
expectations for Redux.
</P>
<P>
   ``AHP knew broad disclosure of this information would disrupt
brisk and highly profitable sales of Pondimin,'' the suit said.
</P>
<P>
   Since Pondimin and Redux were chemically similar, medical and
safety officials at Interneuron, AHP, and its subsidiary
Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, agreed to meet monthly to discuss any
health risks involving the two drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But when AHP was told by Mayo Clinic officials in February 1997
that a dozen fen-phen users had developed potentially
life-threatening heart-valve problems, Interneuron claims its
partner never passed along the information and it learned about the
health risks during a meeting with the FDA that July.
</P>
<P>
   Interneuron claims not having the Mayo Clinic results made it
difficult to assess the safety of its diet drug, according to the
lawsuit. Both Redux and Pondimin were pulled off the market two
months later.
</P>
<P>
   In its 45-page complaint, Interneuron said AHP's protracted
delays after receiving the Mayo Clinic data raised concerns about
the safety of Redux and in turn threatened its marketability. AHP
senior vice president of medical affairs, Dr. Marc Deitch, ``lied''
about the Mayo Clinic data to Interneuron officials, the suit
alleges, and other AHP officials stopped sharing Pondimin
side-effect reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``AHP and Wyeth recognized, however, that if they informed
Interneuron of the preliminary data from the Mayo Clinic _ as AHP
and Wyeth were obligated to do _ Interneuron might cause prompt,
widespread disclosure of that data through the initiation of
clinical studies, proposals for new product labeling, requests for
FDA action, or disclosures to shareholders and the financial
markets,'' the complaint states.
</P>
<P>
   AHP, based in Madison, N.J. issued a statement that the company
acted properly, while acknowledging its attorneys had not yet
reviewed the complaint. The company is offering former fen-phen
users $3.75 billion as part of a national settlement, although a
judge still must determine whether that settlement is fair.

 &HT;    College recruiting can become a tangled web on the Internet
 &HT;    By Norman Arey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Growing up in Cullman, Ala., Wesley Britt was an Auburn fan.
Britt grew and became one of the top high school offensive linemen
in the Southeast and attracted attention from a lot of other
schools, in addition to Auburn.
</P>
<P>
   During the recruiting process, the 6-foot-7, 289-pound Britt
backed away from Auburn, and said his final two choices were
Florida and Alabama. But on the Internet, in chat rooms across the
Southeast, it was written that Wesley's father, Tommy Britt, had
gotten into an argument with an Auburn professor. The story
specified where the alleged altercation took place and on which
football weekend the Britts had visited.
</P>
<P>
   Only problem was, the Britts were nowhere near Auburn that
weekend, and Tommy Britt had no argument with anybody at Auburn; he
has yet to meet his supposed antagonist.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't imagine,'' said Wesley's mother, Vera Britt. ``There
were all kinds of rumors going around when Wesley backed away from
Auburn.''
</P>
<P>
   The Britts are typical of a family with a child going through
the recruiting process in college football. With eight days until
the Feb. 2 national signing day, the Britts and other families are
discovering that rumors appear to be picking up more steam as the
Internet has become a major player in the recruiting game.
</P>
<P>
   Vera Britt determined that the Internet was one of the ways she
could find out what was going on in recruiting, and she quickly
became proficient on the computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would check out the school's history, the coaching staff,
who a particular school was recruiting,'' she said. ``I felt the
more we knew, the better decision Wesley could make.''
</P>
<P>
   Darius Williams, a senior at Avondale High in DeKalb County,
used the Internet to his advantage as he was contemplating his
college choice. The 6-6 tight end ultimately decided on Georgia
Tech.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to see who else had committed, what position they
played, and who else the schools were looking at,'' he said. ``I
was on it today, and I down-loaded a picture of myself. I've become
a fan of the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Andrews, rated the 16th-best defensive back in the
country, says he uses the Internet to check out what people and
schools are saying about him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just try to find myself and other players in the state of
Florida,'' said Andrews, a Tallahassee native. ``I looked at it to
see where I was needed the most. Alabama needed help in the
secondary.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, don't put much stock into the Internet as a
means of recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would look at it from time to time, but I didn't get into it
that much,'' said Houston County senior Hobie Holiday, who
committed to Georgia Tech on Monday. ``I know a lot of people get
into it, but for me it came down to where I felt comfortable
playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill O'Brien, the recruiting coordinator at Georgia Tech, says
the Internet has been both a blessing and a curse.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much is going around on recruiting (on the Internet),''
O'Brien said. ``If you're recruiting, let's say, a wide receiver
and the kid finds out that you're recruiting three other receivers,
he'll want to know what's going on.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're always explaining things. The Internet helps and it
hinders.''
</P>
<P>
   Alabama recruiting coordinator Ronnie Cottrell, rated as one of
the top recruiters in the nation, says he's very aware of what's
happening on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``My impression is that there are very few secrets, because of
the Internet,'' Cottrell said. ``In a matter of minutes, you can
get good solid information from a university's Web site, but there
are so many Web sites out there that deal in rumors, and many times
the recruits get misled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I very rarely go in for a home visit when I'm not confronted
with something they've seen or heard on the Internet,'' he said.
``I'm always having to dispel some rumor. And it's very seldom
positive; it's usually negative.''
</P>
<P>
   When Wesley Britt cut his choices to Florida and Alabama, he
initially said that Alabama was in the lead. ``I got on the chat
rooms for Alabama and Florida,'' Wesley said. ``The fans just talk
to each other, and they seemed like they knew me.''
</P>
<P>
   The winds of recruiting can change fast, as Wesley found out.
``One time, when Alabama was in the lead, people at Florida said
things (on the Internet) like, `That's all right; we don't need
people from Alabama, anyway.' And another one said, `People from
Alabama should stay the hell out of Florida.'''
</P>
<P>
   But then the younger Britt decided that perhaps Florida was the
best place for him. ``Florida had fair-weather fans,'' he said.
``They started liking me again. But the Alabama fans said nice
things the whole time.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Britt has committed to the Crimson Tide and said he
is firm in that commitment.
</P>
<P>
   Vera Britt says the Internet recruiting grapevine amazes her
still. ``After Wesley got off the phone to tell Alabama he was
coming and to tell Florida he wasn't,'' she said, ``I went upstairs
to post it on the Internet, and it was already on the Internet. How
could that be? How could they know that quickly?''
</P>
<P>
   She also said that she took the opportunity to tell people
Wesley's side of the story. ``I wouldn't post anything while Wesley
was still going through the recruiting process,'' she said. ``As
soon as he committed, I went in to set some people straight. I told
them the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing is there's a lot of misinformation out
there,'' said Lance Thompson, former Georgia Tech recruiting
coordinator and now defensive-line coach at Alabama. ``But
sometimes it's useful. A lot of these kids will tell a recruiting
analyst something they might not want to tell a coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans get on the Internet and run down other schools,''
Thompson said. ``When I go see somebody, I tell them I work for the
University of Alabama, and I talk about our school. It's hard
enough for me to keep up with what's going on at our place, much
less worry about what other schools are doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, the Internet is almost entertainment,'' Thompson said.
``The thing I find amusing is that people rate kids and give them
numerical value, but they're just making money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's written down, we have to answer to that,'' Cottrell
said. ``It's something about having it written on paper.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is just another scource of information for me,''
O'Brien said. ``I'm seeing what people are saying. Sometimes you
learn what to address and what not to say. The way I see it,
there's no disadvantage to it.''

 &HT;    Super Bowl 2000: A tale of at least four cities
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Let us unfurl the Super Bowl banner across Atlanta's
Peachtree Street, saluting the participating owners and their happy
followers:
</P>
<P>
   Welcome Carpetbaggers!
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta used to treat this breed of opportunist like the boll
weevil. Now the city bids for their presence and parties them up
for a solid week.
</P>
<P>
   It's the Cleveland-Los Angeles-Anaheim-St. Louis Rams vs. the
Houston-Memphis-Nashville Titans. You can figure out all of Martin
Sheen's kids easier than untangling the family tree of this game.
</P>
<P>
   The first Super Bowl of the 2000s is the perfect working model
of what professional sport has become _ a business where they pack
loyalty in bubble wrap and move it along to the next bunch of
personal seat license-buying saps. And isn't Atlanta the perfect
setting for the first Relocation Bowl, being that most everyone
here understands what it is to be from somewhere else?
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Frontiere and Bud Adams _ never married but often linked
to what's wrong in the NFL _ find themselves justified by the
events of this week. The lesson is clear. No amount of aimless
wandering, past meddling, or hard-hearted brokering of their teams
can keep an NFL owner from his or her turn at the Super Bowl head
table.
</P>
<P>
   Someone asked Fronteire if she felt for those left behind in
Southern California in 1995. ``The fans can still watch on TV. They
were watching on TV and not coming to the games anyway,'' she
reportedly answered. Once more, the bouquet she tossed them was
more thorns than roses.
</P>
<P>
   How appropriate that Adams, who started up the AFL Oilers in
Houston in 1959 and eventually moved them to Tennessee in 1997, got
to the Super Bowl through Jacksonville. He had long history of
playing that city. Back in 1987, he teased those desperate folk
with the idea of moving the Oilers to the bank of St. John's. But
once Adams wrangled a few concessions from Houston, he dropped
Jacksonville like a one-night stand.
</P>
<P>
   Both owners have been easy targets. Frontiere for her
eccentricities since inheriting the team upon the drowning death of
one of her former husbands. Adams for the shameless shopping of his
team. Then they discovered what the Atlanta Falcons' Smith family
did _ just leave the on-field stuff to football minds and
everything eventually will work out. Now it is their moment to try
on the strange role of beloved and benevolent overseers.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a Super Bowl tale of at least four cities. As amazing as
it is that St. Louis and Tennessee are here, it is just as stunning
that anyone in the jilted cities would celebrate. It would seem
like paying alimony to the ex-wife, even after she remarried. But
some did (a Houston Chronicle poll last weekend showed two-thirds
of the respondents rooting for the Titans).
</P>
<P>
   Each year now the Pro Football Hall of Fame honors one fan from
each franchise considered to be the most devoted.
</P>
<P>
   This year's addition to the Visa Hall of Fans for the St. Louis
Rams was a house painter from Santa Monica, Calif. Lance Goldberg
used to go L.A. Rams games with a carved watermelon on his head.
When he got married, he wore a Rams sticker on the sole of his
shoe, to flash it when kneeling at the alter. He was in the Trans
World Dome Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Hall's representative for the Tennessee Titans was a trucker
from outside Houston. Edward Gifford took a load to Jacksonville
last weekend so he could attend the AFC Championship, just as he
works it for all the Titans home games. He's angling for one that
will get him to Atlanta, no matter that he has no ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was disappointed like everyone else (when the Oilers bugged
out),'' Gifford explained . ``But I still didn't want to root for
anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   There are some kind of loves you just can't stomp out, no matter
how big the boot.

COURT RULING ALLOWS U.S. TO SEND SUSPECT TO RWANDA WAR CRIMES
TRIBUNAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)  (js) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The Supreme Court cleared the way Monday for
the United States to send a Rwandan church leader to a war crimes
tribunal, where he is wanted on charges of abetting genocide in
1994 for allowing armed Hutu to enter his church and kill hundreds
of Tutsi who had sought refuge there.
</P>
<P>
   If there are no further delays in his case, the Rwandan,
Elizaphan Ntakirutimana, a Hutu who was arrested in Texas, will
soon become the first person turned over to a current international
war crimes tribunal by the United States, an important precedent to
U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, which was instrumental in urging the Security
Council to create the Rwanda tribunal, has been trying to send
Ntakirutimana to Africa for trial since his first arrest in Texas
in 1996. He successfully fought the deportation through the courts
until August 1998, when a federal district judge ruled against him.
On Monday, the Supreme Court denied him an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Ntakirutimana, freed in 1997 by a Texas magistrate but arrested
again the following year, is now in a federal prison cell in
Laredo. He is the first and only person wanted by either the
Balkans or Rwanda tribunals to be arrested in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who was in New York
Monday for a special Security Council session on Congo, said that
she would review the papers in the case when she returns to
Washington, but she repeated the view of other government officials
that he should be deported.
</P>
<P>
   With the Supreme Court's denial of the case, Albright now has
the power to make the final decision on Ntakirutimana, whose case
has been handled for the State Department by David C. Sheffer, the
first ambassador at large for war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Ntakirutimana, 75, a Seventh Day Adventist church leader in
Kibuye in western Rwanda, has been accused by the Rwanda war crimes
tribunal in Arusha, Tanzania, of encouraging ethnic Tutsi to seek
refuge in his church and hospital compound in the town of Mugonero
in April 1996 and then turning a Hutu death squad loose on them.
</P>
<P>
   An indictment from the Rwanda war crimes tribunal says that he
began welcoming frightened, unarmed Tutsi to his church on April 6,
1994, when ethnic Hutu began the slaughter of Tutsi and their
moderate Hutu supporters. On about April 16, Ntakirutimana was
reported to have allowed a well-armed convoy of Hutu officials and
militia members to carry out a day-long massacre.
</P>
<P>
   Ntakirutimana later tried to avoid arrest in Rwanda by fleeing
to Texas, where one of his sons lives. Another son was taken into
custody by the tribunal and is awaiting trial in Arusha. A U.S.
official said that if the elder Ntakirutimana is now turned over,
the two could be tried together for the same crimes, helping the
Rwanda tribunal speed up resolution of its case load.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The elder Ntakirutimana was first arrested in 1996 by federal
marshals in Texas acting under an agreement between the United
States and the war crimes tribunals for the Balkans and Rwanda.
Congress had approved the agreement and enacted it into law that
year.
</P>
<P>
   A Texas magistrate, however, decided that the law was
unconstitutional, and ordered Ntakirutimana released in December
1997. The Rwandan, who received strong support from Seventh Day
Adventists in Texas, was defended by Ramsey Clark, a former U.S.
attorney general. Clark said he does not recognize the legitimacy
of the tribunals.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas magistrate's decision was a blow to the State
Department and an embarrassment to the United States, since African
and European countries were complying with requests to turn
indicted people over to the Rwanda tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, called the
Supreme Court decision Monday a welcome step. ``It certainly
sustains a long-held government position that the statute that
authorizes such transfers to the tribunal is legally enforceable
and that the evidence that was presented regarding the suspect's
alleged actions in Rwanda is sufficient to meet the burden of proof
required for the transfer,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The requirements for transfer to an international tribunal are
comparable to the requirements for extradition to another nation.
This case is not an extradition, however, which arises from an
agreement between nations. It is also not technically a
deportation, which is a justice and immigration decision.
</P>
<P>
   This case represents a very important set of precedents for
transfers, officials said Monday. They added that the United States
is in a better position to deal with these kinds of cases in the
future because one has now been through the federal courts.

MONUMENTAL DEBATE RAGES OVER PROPOSED CONFEDERATE STATUE IN TEXAS
TOWN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN WILLIAMS 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANDERSON, Texas _ Since 1994, Dal Dreher has sought a statue of
a Confederate soldier for the tiny grounds of the Grimes County
Courthouse, facing south in honor of Civil War dead.
</P>
<P>
   He has raised more than $30,000 for a six-foot bronze
infantryman gripping a rifle that could be replaced with a
Confederate flag on special occasions.
</P>
<P>
   But of late, Dreher's efforts have been blasted by black
ministers and others who believe the statue symbolically looks to
the past as an unwarranted reminder of slavery.
</P>
<P>
   And the passionate skirmish could force Gov. George W. Bush to
face a debate he has sidestepped in his presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   To date, Bush has not got involved in the debate over the
Confederate flag flying atop the South Carolina Capitol. That is a
state's rights issue that doesn't warrant outsider opinion, he has
stated.
</P>
<P>
   But in Bush's home state, if Dreher and his compatriots with the
Grimes County Greys are to get the statue they desire, they must
get permission from the Texas Historical Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Dreher was scheduled to make his formal application to the
commission staff Tuesday. But late Monday afternoon, the meeting
was postponed until next week so Commission Executive Director F.
Lawrence could attend, a commission official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something of this magnitude or importance needs the attention
of the executive director,'' said commission acting deputy director
Terry Colley.
</P>
<P>
   If the staff rejects it, Dreher said he will appeal to the
18-member commission, which includes 12 Bush appointees. A
spokeswoman for Bush said the governor has no formal position on
the statue nor will he influence the historical commission's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor's governing style is to appoint capable and
qualified people to the hundreds of state boards and commissions,
and trust them to make the best decisions for the state of Texas,''
said spokeswoman Linda Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   Frying eggs sunny-side up in his grandmother's iron skillet last
week, Dreher, 72, is surrounded by the past in his home near
Singleton, 10 miles east of the courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   He lives on the last square mile of 32 square miles of a former
cotton plantation his German ancestors bought for 10 cents an acre
in 1852 after moving from South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The aging wood from a former family home covers his current
house. On a window sill overlooking the back yard rests an oil lamp
Dreher used to read by at night as a child. A shelf is filled with
history books, many about the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, Dreher believes that once again, the South will
lose because of the pressures mounting against the statue.
</P>
<P>
   And that's unfair, said Dreher, commander of the Grimes County
Greys camp of the Sons of Confederate Veterans. The statue is meant
to honor his forefathers, not trump up white supremacy.
</P>
<P>
   He displays a bumper sticker with a Confederate flag and the
phrase ``Heritage Not Hate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so wrong for hate groups to use this flag for their
purposes,'' Dreher said. ``When I see the (Ku Klux) Klan using it,
I want to walk up and physically remove it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This statue is to honor those people who fought for their
land,'' he said, noting that more people from Grimes County died in
the Civil War than all other wars combined. ``If we don't defend
our heritage, then we will lose it.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite a common belief among local minorities that Dreher and
most Greys are not racially motivated, black leaders here say you
cannot strip the racist connotations from the statue or the flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``It upsets those who have had their parents and their parents
and their parents tell them about slavery,'' said the Rev. James
Mable of the Missionary Camp Baptist Camp and vice president of the
Grimes County Ministers Union.
</P>
<P>
   Eating a cheeseburger in his small house, Mable said he holds no
animosity toward Dreher, who he believes is well-intentioned. In
Mable's back yard is a float the 43-year-old preacher and farm
worker used in the town's recent Martin Luther King Day parade.
</P>
<P>
   Mable and his allies have drawn some criticism for opposing the
statue only in recent weeks, because the Grimes County
commissioners approved the concept six years ago _ contingent upon
the Greys getting state approval and raising money.
</P>
<P>
   Only two weeks ago did a more organized opposition come from the
ministers' group.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's wrong, then it's wrong and it shouldn't be at the
courthouse,'' Mable said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rhetoric in Grimes County, the debate will be
settled in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Texas Historical Commission helped fund a previous
renovation of the courthouse, it must approve all future changes.
</P>
<P>
   In a Nov. 16 letter to County Judge Ira E. ``Bud'' Haynie, a
commission staffer criticized the proposal because it would clutter
the grounds of the small courthouse. The 1894 building is somewhat
an island with just 15 feet of land between it and a surrounding
road. The staffer suggested the statue be placed in a nearby park,
which offers more space.
</P>
<P>
   Haynie, Mable and other Grimes County residents have no problem
with placing the statue elsewhere, as the commission staffer
suggests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't mind if it's in a cemetery or park, but not at the
courthouse where we have to go every day,'' Mable said. ``It's
offensive there.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dreher said it would force him to return money he has
gathered on the promise the monument would be placed on the
courthouse grounds. He contends the commission staff is using the
issue of space to cloak the bigger racial concerns.
</P>
<P>
   In Dreher's mind, that is wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Confederate statues and memorials sit on government land in 62
sites across Texas, including three on the state Capitol grounds
and six at the University of Texas at Austin.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the state distributes a flier with a map showing
Civil War museums and related sites.
</P>
<P>
   Dreher, who has advertised his project as ``the last Confederate
memorial'' in fund-raising efforts, says it will be harder and
harder to win approval for such projects ``as the wave of political
correctness covers the country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are losing so many of our freedoms, and this is one of
them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The debate has stirred up heartburn for residents of this
community an hour's drive northwest of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders in Navasota, the county's largest city with about 20,000
people, fear racial discourse could make it difficult to lure
businesses and residents from Houston.
</P>
<P>
   And there is another factor at work.
</P>
<P>
   Grimes County is competing with other counties for a grant to
renovate its aging courthouse. County Judge Haynie, whose wife,
Joy, has spearheaded the renovation project, believes the
commission might be shy to grant money if the statue is placed
there.
</P>
<P>
   Preservationists hope to get another $50 million from the Texas
Legislature in 2001. If the historical commission gives Grimes
County a grant after the statue is erected, black legislators might
oppose future funding, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This statue came up at the wrong time,'' Haynie said.

SENATE MOVES TO GIVE CUBAN BOY US CITIZENSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Concerned for the little boy's plight and not
unmindful of the political clout of the Cuban-American lobby,
Congress returned Monday from a long recess with plans to make
six-year-old Elian Gonzalez a US citizen.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the GOP-controlled Senate said they intended to
indefinitely block the child's return to Cuba by exercising its
very rarely used power to pass a law granting citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate measure, known as a ``private bill,'' is on a fast
track, and a vote on it could come as early as Wednesday. Sponsors
said they thought its prospects for passing were good.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of this bill is to move the decision-making about
the little boy's future out of the hands of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service and into the hands of the courts,'' said
Senator Connie Mack, a Florida Republican who introduced
legislation that would make Elian a citizen, Mack said, to protect
his best interests.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts say Congress has acted on citizenship bills only
for the most extraordinary individuals _ to honor Winston Churchill
or Mother Teresa, for example _ or in noncontroversial cases, where
lawmakers have unanimously agreed on the need to cut red tape.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has never granted citizenship to a six-year-old,
particularly one whose parent hasn't requested it and whose case is
anything but noncontroversial.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was rescued off the Florida coast Nov. 25 after the boat
that had brought him from Cuba capsized, killing his mother and 10
other exiles. Ever since, he has been a symbol and a celebrity and
pulled between two political forces: the strong anti-Castro,
Cuban-American lobby, which protests his return to communist Cuba,
and the Clinton administration, which hoped to quietly settle the
case so it wouldn't ruin its efforts to improve relations with
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The INS, an arm of the US Justice Department, reviewed the
situation and the law and ruled on Jan. 4 that Elian should be
returned to Cuba and placed in the custody of his father. Lawyers
for the boy's relatives in Miami, backed by the Cuban American
National Foundation, have sued the Justice Department to keep the
child in the United States and want a Florida family court to grant
the family custody.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Monday the president
would ``wait and see what they have in mind before making any
decisions'' on whether to sign or veto a citizenship bill. But he
warned Congress to be cautious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a real danger here that this can become a
political issue, that this young boy will be a political
football,'' Lockhart said,``and I think the president has made it
very clear to everyone that they ought to stay away from politics
and stick to what the facts and the law dictate.''
</P>
<P>
   Politics are, of course, central to the case, but the fault
lines on the emergency legislation aren't strictly partisan. Mack's
bill has the blessing of Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott plus the
sponsorship of Democrats Bob Graham of Florida; Robert Torricelli
of New Jersey, who chairs the party's Senate re-election committee;
and Charles Robb of Virginia, who is in a tough race against a
conservative opponent this fall.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, Majority Whip Tom DeLay has joined with three
Florida Republicans to propose a version of the citizenship bill,
while three Democrats, including Representative Patrick Kennedy of
Rhode Island, Monday offered a bill that would grant permanent
residency status to the little boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The INS decision to return Elian Gonzalez to Cuba did not give
him the opportunity to exercise his legal options or to have a day
in court,'' said Kennedy, who chairs the Democrats' House
re-election committee and has made no secret that he thinks Castro
was behind the assassination of President Kennedy, his uncle.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors of the various bills say that if Elian is a US citizen,
the federal government will lose its jurisdiction to treat his as
an immigration case and then a state court will be free to settle
it as a custody issue. Mack says his legislation ``doesn't dictate
an outcome,'' but it is clear that he has strong personal feelings
about where the boy belongs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard for me to believe that a court in the United
States, the freest country in the world, would make a decision
saying that they think its in the best interest of the little boy
to go back to Cuba, a totalitarian country, where he will be told
by the state what he will learn, what he can speak, what he can
believe, and what he'll become.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Keely, a professor of international migration at
Georgetown University, says the ``citizenship gambit'' on Capitol
Hill comes because many members of Congress are frustrated with the
government decision to return Elian. They disagree with it and
understand it was properly made under the law. ``This is clearly an
end run around the INS, and everyone knows it is purely
political,'' Keely said.
</P>
<P>
   Keely believes that granting citizenship to the six-year-old may
not solve the problem for Elian's Miami family, since his next of
kin _ his father in Cuba _ would have to request or accept for
Elian the new status that Congress by law conveyed.

 &HT;        Damages limited by judge, not by husband's bill   By Laura
J. Winter   c. 2000 States News Service   WASHINGTON (January, 24)
<TEXT>
- A Virginia judge said Karen Santorum's pain and suffering
amounted to $175,000, half of what the jury awarded Karen Santorum,
wife of Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., in a medical malpractice
lawsuit.
<P>
   Virginia Judge Arthur Vieregg, calling the original award of
$350,000 ``excessive,'' set it aside. He then order the senator's
wife to settle the suit or face a new trial to determine the
damages.
</P>
<P>
   Santorum has accepted the $175,000, but it has not been
confirmed whether she will seek the other half at a later date. She
sued the Virginia chiropractor claiming the specialist had caused
serious injury to her back.
</P>
<P>
   In December, when the jury set the damages, Senate democrats
labeled their Pennsylvania colleague a hypocrite, pointing to his
1994 campaign. As one of his centerpiece issues, the freshman
senator said he would seek legislation that would cap all
non-monetary damages in medical malpractice lawsuits at $250,000.

   PRAGUE, Czech Republic _ A witty former communist leader took a
commanding lead in voting on Monday to replace the late president
of Croatia, Franjo Tudjman. But results released early Tuesday
morning mean that a runoff will be necessary between the two top
finishers.
</P>
<P>
   The runoff, on Feb. 7, will be between the front-runner, Stipe
Mesic, and another opposition politician, Drazen Budisa, who came
in second. The winner has to gain an absolute majority of the votes
cast.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing badly in third place was Foreign Minister Mate Granic,
candidate of Tudjman's once-dominant Croatian Democratic Union,
which ran the country since it became independent after Tito's
Yugoslavia splintered in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   In results were issued by the state electoral commission early
Tuesday morning. With 95 percent of the votes counted, Mesic had
41.6 percent, Budisa 28 percent and Granic 21.7 percent. The
fourth-place finisher, Slaven Letica, a writer and independent
candidate, took 4.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   All three main candidates, out of the nine who ran, promised an
open, democratic Croatia, less authoritarian and fervently
nationalist, with closer ties to the European Union and the United
States. All also promised to dismantle part of the monarchic
all-powerful presidency that Tudjman left.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of kitsch culture,'' Budisa said. ``Medals,
pomp, presidential guard. All of that will have to be abolished.''
</P>
<P>
   Tudjman's party thus suffered a second crippling defeat, having
lost parliamentary elections on Jan. 3 to a six-party opposition
coalition. The party was so badly wounded, after having so
throughly dominated Croatia, that Granic, a moderate in the party,
had pledged in the campaign to quit all his party posts if he won
the election. He had ignored Western advice to run as an
independent, and he suffered badly from his connection to a party
beleaguered by economic difficulties, recession, an overvalued
currency, high unemployment and widespread corruption.
</P>
<P>
   It is highly likely that Budisa, 51, a nationalist and a former
dissident, will pick up many of Granic's votes. But it will be
difficult for him to deny Mesic victory next month.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Still, the nationalist strain in Croatian life is strong and
will not be easily ignored by the new leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Tudjman's aggressive nationalism isolated Croatia from the
European mainstream. He was reluctant to cooperate fully with the
tribunal in The Hague that works on war crimes in the former
Yugoslavia, refusing to hand over specific indictees, often on
medical grounds. Zagreb also intervened in Bosnia, financing and
promoting a separate Bosnian Croat entity despite formal support
for the Muslim-Croat federation that Washington demanded.
</P>
<P>
   All of Tudjman's likely successors promised to cooperate more
fully with the tribunal, to allow Serbian refugees who fled to
return more easily and to stop meddling in Bosnia.

 &HT;    FBI: Flashes at Mount Carmel are ``glint,'' not gunfire
 &HT;    By Mark England
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Although most admit never seeing as many multiple
flashes before, FBI agents and technicians are adamant that the
flashes seen on an infrared video of Mount Carmel on April 19,
1993, are ``glint'' and not gunfire, according to depositions for
the upcoming wrongful-death lawsuit filed against the government by
surviving Branch Davidians.
</P>
<P>
   The Tribune-Herald reviewed the depositions of 20 FBI employees,
including technicians, pilots and Forward-Looking Infrared (FLIR)
operators. None of the FBI employees were members of the Hostage
Rescue Team, the tactical unit accused by some critics of firing
shots at the Davidians on the final day of the 51-day siege, which
ended in a fire that led to the deaths of David Koresh and 75
followers.
</P>
<P>
   FBI employee No. 15 _ the identities of the agents are sealed on
the order of U.S. Judge Walter S. Smith Jr. of Waco _ testified
during his deposition that he reviewed at least 10 FLIR tapes
looking for flashes similar to those on the Waco FLIR tape.
</P>
<P>
   He told plaintiffs' attorney Mike Caddell of Houston that he
found examples of flashes on other FLIR tapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one that sticks out in my mind is a surveillance that was
being done on a vehicle in the daytime,'' said the FBI employee,
who was the FLIR operator when Mount Carmel caught fire. ``And you
could see a flash off of the fender and the hood of the car at one
point in the orbit.''
</P>
<P>
   Caddell asked the FLIR operator if he had ever seen multiple
flashes like those present on the Mount Carmel FLIR tape. The FLIR
operator maintained circumstances were different every time the
camera was used.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's different,'' the FLIR operator said. ``Different
circumstances, different temperatures, different scenery. You are
not looking at the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he had considered the possibility that some of the
flashes on the Waco FLIR tape were weapons fired by the Davidians,
the FLIR operator said, ``I think it's glint.''
</P>
<P>
   Caddell asked why the FLIR tape doesn't show flashes on both
sides of Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't recall there being an unusual condition where the
sun was blocked from the front of Mount Carmel but shone on the
back, do you?'' Caddell asked.
</P>
<P>
   After wrangling, which involved Justice Department attorneys,
the FLIR operator answered, ``I still think it's glint.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the pilots of Night Stalker, the plane carrying the FLIR
camera, also told Caddell that he believes the flashes seen on the
Mount Carmel FLIR tape were caused by glint.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certain things that the FLIR tape picks up that
can't be explained,'' said the pilot, a co-pilot when Night Stalker
flew during the morning of April 19, 1993. ``I think it's often
referred to as glint. It's an unexplained phenomenon that appears
on a FLIR tape primarily in the daytime.''
</P>
<P>
   Caddel showed the pilot a condensed version of the Mount Carmel
FLIR tape highlighting the flashes, according to the deposition.
One involved a flash seen to the left of a Combat Engineering
Vehicle (CEV) on the back of the compound.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would call that a glint,'' the pilot said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And how did we distinguish between a glint and something
else?'' Caddell asked. ``Is it a glint when it might have otherwise
been gunfire from an FBI agent?''
</P>
<P>
   The pilot later explained his reasoning.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, I do not believe that there was an individual
on that tank firing a weapon,'' the pilot said. ``Therefore, the
fact the flash occurs is an unexplained anomaly.''
</P>
<P>
   Caddell pointed out that Carlos Ghigliotti, an expert in thermal
imaging and videotape, told The Washington Post that he believes
FBI agents fired shots on April 19, 1993. Ghigliotti is one of the
FLIR experts working for the congressional committee investigating
Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   However, FBI agent No. 7, who rode inside CEV2 on the final day
of the siege, was among the FBI employees not agreeing with
Ghigliotti's conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea what may or may not cause flashes on this
video, but if you are asking about the flashes that came from
directly behind my CEV, I believe I would be aware if there had
been anything back there,'' the agent said. ``And I saw nothing but
ground and junk.''
</P>
<P>
   Another FBI employee, a Night Stalker pilot, said the FLIR
camera wasn't designed to pick up small arms fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``The type of FLIR utilized, the collimation of the FLIR in
relation to the gunfire, distances involved, and other parameters
would lead me to believe this is not gunfire, based on what I
know,'' said the pilot, who was flying when Mount Carmel caught
fire.
</P>
<P>
   By collimation, the pilot said he meant the FLIR camera in the
plane would have been at a right angle to the direction of any
muzzle blast on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell asked if the FLIR could detect smoke and hot gases. The
pilot said it could under certain conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's your belief that there's something special about hot
gases from the muzzle of a gun, that it wouldn't detect those, but
it would detect the hot gases from a Davidian starting a fire,
right?''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a difference in the spectrum,'' the pilot said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Caddell pressed the FBI pilot on whether the FLIR would
pick up any type of gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, that ... suggests to me that under certain
circumstances, you believe this FLIR would pick up gunfire,''
Caddell said. ``Correct?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it could pick up a battleship firing its gun, yes,''
the pilot said. ``I believe it could pick up large cannons. I
believe it could do several things. I do not believe what I saw you
show me is gunfire.''

MARKETPLACE: EQUITY AS SERVICE FEE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By PATRICK McGEEHAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shares of Internet-based companies remain the currency of the
realm in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Neoforma.com kicked off the 2000 season for dot.com stock
offerings Monday and the deal looked like another bonanza for a
variety of investors and suppliers who got in ahead of the general
public, including the firm that found the company's chief
executive, Heidrick &AMP; Struggles International. Shares of Neoforma,
a start-up that operates electronic marketplaces for new and used
medical equipment, tripled to $52.375 in their first day of trading
on the Nasdaq stock market.
</P>
<P>
   That gain showed that investors haven't lost their voracious
appetite for new Internet stocks and it could translate into a huge
payday for Heidrick &AMP; Struggles. When the time came last fall for
Neoforma to pay Heidrick &AMP; Struggles, a Chicago-based executive
search firm, for recruiting Robert Zollars, a seasoned health care
industry executive, the search firm accepted a cash fee plus a
bundle of equity in the young company.
</P>
<P>
   Fees for top executive search firms traditionally run to about
one-third of an executive's first-year cash compensation. In
Zollars' case, that would have amounted to about $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   But, as on Wall Street, in Silicon Valley cash salary and
bonuses often amount to less than half of a chief executive's total
compensation. So, on top of its traditional fee, Heidrick &AMP;
Struggles has often demanded equity equal to one-third of the
executive's stock and options that vest in the first year.
</P>
<P>
   For placing Zollars, Heidrick &AMP; Struggles received a warrant
convertible into 436,623 shares of Neoforma stock at 10 cents a
share. As of Monday's close, that warrant was worth about $22.8
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd probably choose column B here,'' said John Thompson, a
vice chairman of Heidrick &AMP; Struggles in Menlo Park, Calif., who
recruited Zollars away from a senior management position at
Cardinal Health.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said he had accepted a mix of cash and equity for all
of the searches he has conducted for more than two years. All told,
Heidrick &AMP; Struggles has taken equity stakes in more than 70
companies and has commitments for equity in another 200 searches it
is conducting. The firm has sold shares in less than 10 of those
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The Neoforma stake ``is one of the larger ones and, hopefully,
it's going to be worth a lot more,'' Thompson said. He said that
Heidrick &AMP; Struggles can't sell its Neoforma shares for several
months because they are subject to the same restrictions as shares
held by the company's managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want an opportunity to participate in the long-term
performance of the CEOs we place,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the firm, which itself went public last year, is taking
a gamble every time it accepts stock in an untested company instead
of cash. Heidrick &AMP; Struggles sometimes hedges its bets, however,
according to a prospectus for a 3 million share secondary stock
offering it is currently marketing. In the case of one company that
paid Heidrick &AMP; Struggles with a warrant, Covad Communications, the
firm used stock options to limit the potential decline in the value
of its stake. Still, Heidrick &AMP; Struggles took in more than $10
million for recruiting that company's chief executive in July 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good strategy on their part,'' said Tom O'Halloran,
an analyst at Warburg Dillon Read. ``It's part of a trend among
professsional-service firms to either invest cash in companies or
take warrants from them in addition to the standard fee, or, in
lieu of fees.''
</P>
<P>
   So far for Heidrick &AMP; Struggles, O'Halloran said, ``this has not
shown up as a big number on their financials but it could very well
be a big number at some point in the future.'' If the firm proves
it can repeatedly reap big gains from these stakes, investors will
place a higher value on the firm's shares, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some top executives of Heidrick &AMP; Struggles, including its chief
executive, Patrick S. Pittard, plan to sell shares in the firm's
secondary offering. But Thompson, who owns more than 1 percent of
the firm, is hanging on. ``I'm predicting it's going to be a major
part of our company's financial future,'' Thompson said of the
practice of accepting equity for fees.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Thompson and his colleagues believe so strongly in their
ability to pick winners among managers and companies that Heidrick
&AMP; Struggles is branching out into the venture capital business.
Borrowing a stratagem used by investment banks, the firm plans to
use $25 million of its own money and its employees' money to start
a fund that will invest in private companies, primarily those that
hire Heidrick &AMP; Struggles to find executives for them.
</P>
<P>
   O'Halloran said investing in companies ``presents a conflict of
interest, but it could be a tool to strengthen client relationships
and could be an effective tool to recruit'' its own employees.

STOCKS DROP AMID FEARS OF HIGHER INTEREST RATES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices fell sharply in very heavy trading
Monday, as investors shed positions in a wide array of sectors,
especially technology, in advance of meetings next week that are
expected to produce an increase in short-term interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Worries about a move by the Federal Reserve Board to raise
interest rates have preyed on the stock market for weeks, but share
prices climbed early in the session _ with the Dow up more than 100
points. The selloff began abruptly at around midday. Other than
worries about the Fed, there were no adverse developments during
the session that were seen as factors in the steep decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stocks are not going down because of bad news,'' said Thomas
M. Galvin, chief investment strategist at Donaldson Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``We remain in a volatile marketplace, and when you
are at high valuations and stub your toe, people want to make a
quick run for the exits.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average recorded its fifth consecutive
loss, falling 243.54 points, or 2.2 percent, to 11,008.17. During
the morning, the Dow was up as much as 113 points. Big blue-chip
names like General Electric, Johnson &AMP; Johnson and Wal-Mart Stores
led the decline.
</P>
<P>
   High-flying technology issues like Cisco Systems, Oracle and
Qualcomm pulled the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index down 39.83
points, or 2.8 percent, to 1,401.53. At one point during the
morning, the S&AMP;P 500 was up more than 12 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index was hammered, falling 139.32 points,
or 3.3 percent to 4,096.08. The drop was the third-biggest point
loss ever for the index, and came on a day when trading volume on
the Nasdaq stock market hit a record 1.96 billion shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe the vast majority of investors thought the
Nasdaq could get to this point,'' said Thomas M. O'Neill, chief
investment officer at Fleet Boston Investment Advisors. ``Now
Nasdaq has had a comeuppance.''
</P>
<P>
   Small cap stocks, which recently have been outperforming
companies with much larger market valuations, were pummeled as
well.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks fell 10.99, or 2.1
percent, to 522.95.
</P>
<P>
   The selling was broadly-based: Stocks that fell in price
outnumbered those that gained by a ratio of nearly 2-to-1 on the
New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said the action magnified underlying trends that were
apparent last week but were masked by further advances in
technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Excluding about 35 technology names, last week was a very
sloppy week for the market,'' said Jonathan Olesky, head of block
trading at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ``Now you are getting a
continuation of the weakness that is being felt very broadly across
the whole market.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were reluctant to speculate how long the selling might
continue, or how severely stock prices might fall.
</P>
<P>
   But they noted that with Federal Reserve Board policy-makers
scheduled to hold important meetings next week, investors are
likely to remain on edge.
</P>
<P>
   It is widely expected that Fed governors will vote to push up
short-term interest rates at that meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Market interest rates actually fell a bit Monday, a development
that could have bolstered stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   However, interest-sensitive financial-service stocks were
victimized by Monday's downdraft along with many others.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley Dean Witter slumped 4{, to 128. Citigroup dropped
1\, to 55 3/16. And American International Group fell 2 3/8, to 101
9/16.
</P>
<P>
   Among Dow stocks, General Electric was a big loser. It fell 6,
to 138[. Johnson &AMP; Johnson dropped 6 3/16, to 83 11/16. And
Wal-Mart declined 3 1/16, to 59].
</P>
<P>
   There were small pockets of strength.
</P>
<P>
   Intel gained ~ to 98 after a Robertson Stephens analyst said
demand for computers would rebound in the first quarter after a
slowdown caused by fears of problems related to year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   And Procter &AMP; Gamble rose 7/16 to 103[ after the
consumer-products giant said it was abandoning talks to buy
Warner-Lambert and American Home Products.
</P>
<P>
   However, it was a very rude session for high-flying, well-known
technology names.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco Systems fell 6 3/16, to 109 1/16. Microsoft dropped 2{, to
101\. Qualcomm slumped 14~, to 140 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   Biotechnology companies, which have been on fire since the start
of the year, cooled off a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Immunex shed 21 9/16, to 110 1/16. Millennium Pharmaceuticals
dropped 28~, to 171}. Genentech fell 5 7/16, to 161 13/16. And
Biogen fell 6 13/16, to 85 3/16.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill at Fleet and other analysts said a slide in the widely
watched market averages could be healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are now getting to the point where these relatively
unscathed popular market averages will correct,'' said Richard
McCabe, chief market analyst at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``But so many stocks are down so much that this may be an ending
of what has been a piecemeal rotational phase that has been taking
place for the last 18 to 21 months.''

 &HT;    Coryell tree shakes loose Rams' Martz
 &HT;    (EDS: This story was to be a short sidebar on the officials team
for the Super Bowl. The content was changed and will now be a
feature on St. Louis's Mike Martz.)
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Eight years ago, Mike Martz was out of work.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's the architect of the NFL's hottest offense and is
assured of following Dick Vermeil as Rams coach.
</P>
<P>
   Martz was unemployed in 1992 after Arizona State coach Larry
Marmie and his staff were fired. Martz had a few offers, but they
were a step down on the college-football totem pole.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough,'' he said. ``I was frustrated, because I wanted
to go forward, not backward. And I ended up without a job.''
</P>
<P>
   So he began an unlikely path through the NFL. At 40, he
persuaded Chuck Knox, then coach of the Los Angeles Rams, to hire
him as an unpaid tight-ends coach. Martz was still receiving a
paycheck from Arizona State when Knox promised to hire him, or find
him a job in the pros.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an easy decision for me,'' Martz said. ``It was a great
opportunity to get in the NFL, which I'd always wanted to do. I was
40 years old. I was at just the right age, I think, to make that
move. And it just worked out really well.''
</P>
<P>
   Martz, 48, was born in Sioux Falls, S.D., but attended high
school in San Diego. Still, he didn't know Rams offensive
coordinator Ernie Zampese, who had been an assistant coach under
former San Diego State and Chargers coach Don Coryell.
</P>
<P>
   During his five years with the Rams, Martz coached tight ends,
receivers and quarterbacks. Zampese also helped Martz develop his
offensive philosophy, which is built in part on the well-known
``Air Coryell'' passing attack.
</P>
<P>
   When current Falcons defensive coordinator Rich Brooks and his
staff were fired by the Rams after the 1996 season, Martz was hired
by Redskins coach Norv Turner, also from the Coryell coaching tree.
Turner had coached with Zampese in L.A.
</P>
<P>
   In his second season in Washington, Martz coached quarterback
Trent Green, who threw 23 touchdowns and only 11 interceptions
after taking over as the starter in the second game. When Green
signed with the Rams as a free agent in February 1999, Vermeil
hired Martz as his offensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Martz) runs the show,'' said Green, who suffered a
season-ending knee injury in an exhibition game. ``Coach Vermeil
has given him the freedom to do the things he wants to do. He's
really just unbelievably creative in coming up with ways to spread
the ball around.''
</P>
<P>
   After Green suffered torn knee ligaments, the Rams' season
seemed hopeless. But former Arena League star Kurt Warner stepped
forward, throwing an NFL-high 41 touchdowns with 4,353 passing
yards. St. Louis scored 526 points, the third-highest season total
in league history.
</P>
<P>
   Martz surfaced as a candidate with the Saints, Patriots and
Packers, all of which were searching for head coaches after
firings. But the Rams ended all speculation last week by signing
Martz to a contract extension guaranteeing that he will replace
Vermeil in at least two years, if not sooner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect talent, and I know my job is to win, and we have a
person here who is helping us win,'' Vermeil said. ``With all these
jobs coming open, I've been in that situation before. Sometimes you
think the grass is greener somewhere else. The greenest grass in
the country right now is in St. Louis.''

 &HT;    Storm recovery continues in Georgia
 &HT;    By Dan Chapman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Armies of power-line workers, emergency personnel,
road crews, and prisoners restored electricity and cleared roads
across North Georgia on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   They made significant progress: Only 100,000 or so homes and
businesses remained without power late Monday, down from 500,000 at
the peak of the fallout from Sunday's freak ice storm. More schools
planned to open Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the news wasn't all encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Roy Barnes declared emergencies in another 14 counties,
raising the total to 34 counties hit hard by the season's first
serious winter storm. Almost one in five Georgia counties now carry
that unwelcome distinction. Insurance Commissioner John Oxendine
estimated insured losses at $25 million, and rising.
</P>
<P>
   Three members of a Roswell, Ga., family suffered carbon monoxide
poisoning, police say, when fumes from a gas-powered generator
seeped into the house. A 10-year-old Rockdale girl's back was
broken when a four-inch thick limb hit her in the head and
compressed several vertebrae.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of more windy weather worried some. ``Some of these
trees have been weakened. They may come down if the winds pick
up,'' said Lt. Mark Gresham of the Cobb County Fire Department.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters predicted the next bout of icy weather could arrive
Friday. Rain is on tap for the Atlanta area; ice and snow for the
northern, mountainous counties.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that was the prediction last weekend. Even if the
worst of the weather remains north of Atlanta, legions of Tennessee
Titans fans bound for the Super Bowl will plow through it as they
come down I-75.
</P>
<P>
   The National Football League is concerned about the weather,
mainly its effect on players. ``Teams are obviously sensitive to
it. We want to know if we're able to practice outside or not,''
said Jim Steeg, who is in charge of game-day preparations for the
NFL.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans plan to practice, starting Wednesday, at college
campus. The St. Louis Rams will use the Atlanta Falcons training
camp in Suwanee, Ga. Neither offers an indoor practice field.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Dome, where Super Bowl XXXIV will be played Sunday
is undergoing significant preparations. Allowing the teams _ their
penchant for privacy _ to practice there would be a logistical
headache, Steeg said.
</P>
<P>
   Damage varied across the region, depending on population
density, tree canopy and the further north from Atlanta one
traveled Monday.
</P>
<P>
   An ice-coated tree limb fell 30 feet before hitting the Rockdale
County girl. The limb struck with such force that either the spine
or a broken rib punctured a lung. The girl, whose name wasn't
released, is not believed to be paralyzed, but she remained in
severe pain Monday night at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta at
Egleston.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Power deployed 3,000 linemen in response to the ice
storm, which knocked out power to 340,000 of its 1.8 million
customers. Utility crews from across Georgia, Alabama and the
Southeast responded. About 75,000 Georgia Power customers remained
without electricity Monday afternoon. Some customers may not be
back on line until Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going house to house to house and it's slow going,''
said Georgia Power spokesman Tal Wright.
</P>
<P>
   Another 21,000 customers of electric membership cooperatives,
primarily in the northern Georgia, were also without service late
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross planned to open 10 shelters Monday evening across
the Atlanta region, a couple more than the night before.
</P>
<P>
   Also at work were some inmates from state and local jails. They
were issued garden tools, chainsaws, rakes and other road-clearing
paraphernalia and fanned out across the region. Summerville,
Demorest, Canton and other towns availed themselves of the free
labor.
</P>
<P>
   Most folks still without power Monday evening lived beneath
metro Atlanta's lush canopy of trees.

CANDIDATE'S FATHER, NO STRANGER TO CAMPAIGNING, HITS THE TRAIL
AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By ROBYN MEREDITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ The role of stump speeches for candidates is
clear _ criticize the other party's candidates while avoiding
saying anything that will offend anybody in your own party. But the
role for a candidate's parents _ particularly if the parent is a
former president _ is murky.
</P>
<P>
   Former President George Bush's latest interpretation of that
role, in a speech here to the National Automobile Dealers
Association, featured occasional digs at the Clinton presidency and
a gentle vouching for his son, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the
front-runner for the Republican nomination for president. To
lighten things up, he even did his imitation of comedian Dana
Carvey imitating President Bush on Saturday Night Live _ ``not
gonna do it, wouldn't be prudent,'' Bush joked on Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   He subtly criticized President Clinton's dalliance with a White
House intern by saying first, ``We must respect the institution of
the presidency,'' and later predicting that in the 2000 race, ``one
of the issues is going to be respect for the institution of the
presidency.'' He won thunderous applause each time.
</P>
<P>
   And he talked about the pride he felt in his two sons, both
governors now, calling them, ``two honest, courageous guys out
there fighting for their beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke late on Monday afternoon, Bush had his mind on the
votes being counted in the Iowa caucuses. ``We're going to know
something tonight,'' said the former president. ``If I look a
little nervous as I stand here now, it is because by 9 o'clock
tonight central time, 10 o'clock here, we are going to know who
wins on the Democratic side and on the Republican side _ this is
the Iowa caucuses _ the first expression of the people, which is
different from the polls that tell us what's going on every single
minute.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush offered his own reading of the political tea leaves. ``If
Bradley is the nominee for the Democrats, and say, my son wins for
the Republican nomination, or John McCain does, then you're going
to have a Bush-Dukakis race, which is largely conservative and
liberal,'' Bush said. ``Remember back in 1988 _ the issues were
drawn very, very clearly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bradley is pulling toward the left,'' and if Gore is the
Democratic nominee, Gore would be able to move further towards the
political center,'' Bush said. If Gore wins, ``then you're going to
have a different kind of race.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the former president's gentle support for his son's
presidential candidacy hardly came as a surprise, and was something
most car dealers could relate to. Harold B. Wells, a dealer from
Whiteville, N.C., introduced Bush by telling the several thousand
car dealers present that, ``He's doing what you or I would do _
he's helping his son get into the family business.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush was, as he pointed out ``preaching to the choir,'' since
the nation's car dealers generally lean Republican, viewing
themselves as hard-working entrepreneurs who are active in their
communities.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Spitzer, who said he plans to vote for Governor Bush for
president, summarized the views of many car dealers. ``He's
conservative like his dad and as he said in his speech, he believes
in entrepreneurs and that's the lifeblood of our industry,'' said
Spitzer, chairman and chief executive of Spitzer Management Group,
which owns 24 car dealerships in Florida, Pennsylvania and Ohio.
``A majority of the dealers nationally would support Governor Bush
or at least a Republican candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   The former president tried not to give the stump speech of a
proud father, however, even when asked about the 2000 presidential
race. ``I've got my own hopes, of course. It is so hard for me to
be constrained in talking to you about this, because this isn't a
political convention,'' said Bush, ``but when your own son is
involved, you've just gotta excuse me if I cross that line.''
</P>
<P>
   Turns out the car dealers did not mind. They gave him two
standing ovations.

McCAIN FOCUSES ON NEW HAMPSHIRE DURING IOWA CAUCUSES 
 
By CLAY ROBISON 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PLYMOUTH, N.H. _ While the other presidential candidates were
trying to drum up last-minute support in Iowa on Monday, Republican
John McCain campaigned alone in New Hampshire, where he debuted a
new television commercial that heavily promotes his military
record.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona senator, who skipped the Iowa caucuses to gamble on
a strong showing Feb. 1 in New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation
primary, made five campaign stops in the Granite State.
</P>
<P>
   Attending his 100th New Hampshire town hall meeting at a
National Guard Armory in Plymouth, McCain told about 200 people
that the Iowa caucuses were the ``preliminaries'' of the
presidential nominating process.
</P>
<P>
   ``The finals are right here in New Hampshire,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Polls indicate that McCain, a former prisoner of war in Vietnam,
is locked in a tight race in New Hampshire with GOP front-runner
George W. Bush. Many observers believe McCain needs a victory in
New Hampshire or at least a strong second-place finish to keep his
candidacy for the White House alive.
</P>
<P>
   In a foreign policy discussion with reporters, McCain said that
rather than use U.S. troops to dislodge unfriendly dictators, such
as Yugoslavia's Slobodan Milosevic, he would ``arm, train, equip
(and) encourage opposition'' from within the affected countries.
</P>
<P>
   That opposition, he said, could include the possible
assassination of the offending leader, as long as the killing
wasn't directly sponsored by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they do is up to them as they evict the dictators,'' he
said. ``I'm saying that I do not support U.S.-sponsored
assassination.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't really have a peaceful world as long as you have
governments that are controlled by despots,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic right now is stirring up trouble in Kosovo. We all
know that. If you replace Milosevic and at least have some progress
towards democracy and freedom you will face a much less threat to
the stability there, which is fragile as we all know, than we would
with him in power.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bush has been campaigning across the country, McCain has
been concentrating most of his effort on New Hampshire and South
Carolina, which will hold a primary Feb. 19. A spokesman said
McCain has made 30 trips to New Hampshire and spent 64 days
campaigning here since kicking off his presidential race last year.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's new TV ad cites more than 12,000 military families on
food stamps, veterans unable to get benefits, and ``international
tensions, hot spots and uncertainties around the globe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only one man running for president who knows the
military and understands the world _ John McCain,'' an announcer
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a Navy pilot and POW he's seen the horrors of war. As a
senator, he's already one of the nation's leaders in knowing how to
keep the peace.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain adds, ``If America is to lead, then America's leader must
be prepared for that challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain told reporters he was not highlighting Bush's
inexperience in foreign policy, despite the Texas governor's short
resume on international affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Bush) has been a fine governor. He's a good man, and I
think he would make a good president of the United States,'' McCain
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the senator said he was ``better prepared'' than Bush for
the free world's top job because of his total life experiences and
his ``vision for the future of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he made only three trips to Iowa _ to participate in
two recent debates of Republican presidential candidates and attend
a congressional hearing last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope in the Iowa caucuses we will break half a percent,'' he
joked. ``We will try to convince everyone that's a victory.''

FEARING A TAKEOVER, SHOPS RALLY TO THE BEN &AMP; JERRY'S CAUSE(S) 
</HEADLINE>
 (fb) 
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A group of Ben &AMP; Jerry's ice cream shop owners plans to rally in
various cities on Tuesday to protest what they say is the threat a
corporate takeover would pose to the company's socially responsible
image.
</P>
<P>
   Ben &AMP; Jerry's was founded in 1978 by Ben Cohen and Jerry
Greenfield and quickly developed a quirky but warm-hearted image by
billing itself as a practitioner of ``caring capitalism'' and
aligning with causes like saving rain forests and helping the
homeless. But last month, the company announced that it had
received ``indications of interest'' from an unidentified company.
Ben &AMP; Jerry's, based in Burlington, Vt., said at the time that the
offer was subject to conditions, but that its board would consider
it.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have said that any takeover of Ben &AMP; Jerry's would have
to meet a number of unusual criteria, including agreeing to
continue manufacturing the product in Vermont. Politicians in the
state have said Ben &AMP; Jerry's should remain independent, and a Web
site was launched last month _ by a Web page designer in
Massachusetts who had worked with the company on various causes _
that urges people to fight the sale by buying shares in the company
so they can vote against it.
</P>
<P>
   One store owner said on Monday that she feared a takeover could
mean the end of Ben &AMP; Jerry's highly regarded involvement in causes
that aid disadvantaged groups _ something that drew her to the
company in the first place. ``I got involved with Ben &AMP; Jerry's
because I liked the way they mixed business with their social
mission,'' said Lori Johnston, who owns two stores in Washington.
With a takeover by a larger corporation, she added, ``a large part
of what Ben &AMP; Jerry's stands for would disappear, and I think that
would be a shame.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnston's stores are among 198 that sell Ben &AMP; Jerry's ice
cream for profit. Eight additional stores are run as partnerships
with nonprofit organizations. Nearly all of the store owners are
protesting the proposed takeover, said Judy Wicks, the founder of
the Social Venture Network, which has organized the Coalition to
Save Ben &AMP; Jerry's.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Ben &AMP; Jerry's said on Monday that the company
had no additional comments to make on the offer. ``With regard to
the rallies, those are independently owned franchisees, and the
company respects their right to voice their opinions,'' said the
spokeswoman, Chrystie Heimert.
</P>
<P>
   Rosanne Haggerty, the founder and executive director of Common
Ground, which has operated a Ben &AMP; Jerry's store for the last five
years near New York's Times Square and plans to open a second in
Rockefeller Center later this year, recalled how Ben &AMP; Jerry's
promised to support her even before the group was formally
organized. Common Ground provides housing and employment counseling
to people with low incomes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The value of the business is in the image of Ben &AMP; Jerry's
remaining a spirited outsider compared with the typical business
operation,'' she said. ``They seek out nonprofit groups to run some
of their shops. There is no other company we've come across that
has a vision like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Haggerty, whose store is one of the rallying sites, said she
received a mailing from Ben &AMP; Jerry's about the Dec. 2 announcement
of the acquisition offer. While there had been rumors of such
things in earlier years, she said, ``we have never received any
notification of an official nature from the company in the past.''
That, combined with a discussion of the merger-and-acquisition
trend in the ice cream business that was part of a franchisee
meeting in Florida this month, made her and other franchisees feel
that ``there is a whiff of the decision nearing a resolution
here,'' she said.

 &HT;    Vermeil loses control, loosens up for Rams
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The last time Dick Vermeil was in this position, he
had issues _ control issues.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, though, the 63-year-old coach of the Rams is very
little like the 44-year-old man who led the Eagles to Super Bowl
XVI in January, 1981.
</P>
<P>
   New millennium, new man.
</P>
<P>
   That means no curfew as his team gets ready to play the Titans
in Super Bowl XXXIV.
</P>
<P>
   The old, younger, Vermeil drew attention for all the discipline
he used to embrace, not to mention the curfews he put in place for
the Eagles when they were in New Orleans getting ready to play the
Oakland Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't work. First, several Raiders players were supposedly
spotted out and about on Bourbon Street. Later, they were
definitely seen running roughshod over Vermeil's Philadelphia
squad, 27-10.
</P>
<P>
   But the new, older, Vermeil said Monday his team won't have a
bed check this week, other than a mandatory Saturday meeting at 9
p.m. That doesn't mean he wants his players spotted behaving like
the Raiders 19 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any curfews scheduled,'' Vermeil said. ``I just
told them that anybody out screwing around that gets in trouble,
I'll send home. I don't think I've got any people like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Rams players believe the fact there is no extra week
between the conference championship games and the Super Bowl makes
it more likely everybody will buckle down.
</P>
<P>
   Most years, Super Bowl teams put in at least part of their game
plans in the off week, leaving less hard work the week before the
game.
</P>
<P>
   This year, schmooze time was limited largely to Monday night,
when some players hit Atlanta clubs and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time management is going to be critical,'' said Pro Bowl
cornerback Todd Lyght. ``These next six days are very important.
Personally, I think it's helpful to get right back out there. If
you have too much down time, you might lose your edge.''
</P>
<P>
   One guy guaranteed not to do any rabble-rousing is St. Louis Pro
Bowl quarterback Kurt Warner, who's about as straight-laced as they
come.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hated to wait two weeks to play that first game,'' he said.
``It's great to just get back out there and play football.''
</P>
<P>
   It's still early in the week, but the Rams don't sound like a
team that might grow tense, as many suspected the Eagles did under
a week under the formerly iron-fisted Vermeil.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm different,'' he said. ``I'm older, I'm a grandfather of
11. Hopefully, I'm not as blind.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that Vermeil is completely without control
issues.
</P>
<P>
   He left most of his staff behind in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to go about game-planning much as they would in a
normal week. The staff will fly into Atlanta tonight, and everybody
will meet at 7 a.m. Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   So not everything has changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like the way we do things,'' Vermeil said. ``I felt that
this would be best for our team.''

BBDO WORLDWIDE SHUFFLES ITS TOP MANAGERS IN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The ranks of top managers at the flagship New York
office of BBDO Worldwide, the largest agency in the Omnicom Group,
are being revamped in an effort to identify a next generation of
leadership and increase the attention paid to important tasks like
landing more clients and broadening offerings beyond traditional
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The changes, being formally announced on Tuesday, raise some
questions as they answer others, primarily in regard to when Philip
B. Dusenberry, the longtime chairman at BBDO New York, might begin
making succession plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to take away anything from the announcements,''
Dusenberry said in a telephone interview, ``but I can assure you
I'm not going anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still active,'' said Dusenberry, 63. ``I'm still coming in
every day and will continue to for the foreseeable future.''
Dusenberry is also scheduled to take over as chairman of the
American Association of Advertising Agencies in May; that would be
for a one-year term expiring in spring 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, when Dusenberry relinquished his duties as co-chief
executive and chief creative officer at BBDO New York to Ted Sann,
billings have doubled, the office estimates, to more than $2
billion in 1999 out of a BBDO Worldwide total of $13.5 billion.
Among new clients are Dell Computer, the New York Stock Exchange,
the New York Yankees, Charles Schwab and Texaco.
</P>
<P>
   The changes are mostly on the account management or ``suit''
side of BBDO New York with a couple involving the creative side.
Because the office is dense with layers of senior executives,
replete with titles beginning with ``co- '' and ``senior
executive,'' the changes will be outlined below in steps to try
minimizing confusion.
</P>
<P>
   In the account-management ranks, one major change is the
promotion of William L. Katz, 45, who had been president and chief
operating officer, to president and co-chief executive. He assumes
the title of co-chief executive from Thomas H. Carey, 55, who
continues as president at BBDO North America and takes on new
duties at BBDO Worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Carey is relinquishing his oversight of BBDO New York a year
after he relinquished supervision of the agency's Los Angeles and
San Francisco offices to Katz and Sann, 54, the other co-chief
executive at BBDO New York who is also chief creative officer.
</P>
<P>
   Carey, however, continues to oversee the BBDO North America
offices in Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis and Canada. The BBDO
offices in the Detroit area, home of the billings- and revenue-rich
DaimlerChrysler account, are supervised by J. Thomas Clark.
</P>
<P>
   In another account management change, Jeffrey A. Mordos, 42,
executive vice president and managing director on the Pepsi-Cola
account, is being promoted to chief operating officer, assuming
much of Katz's previous operational duties. Mordos has been
identified as an up-and-comer at BBDO New York and not just because
he once bested an older, more muscular creative executive in a
hallway tussle over some disputed Pepsi commercials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're giving Jeff a lot more responsibility,'' Dusenberry
said, because ``he has established himself as one of the great
operations guys in terms of administrative abilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernadette Murray, 41, who had been executive vice president and
senior account director on the Campbell Soup account, becomes
senior account director on Pepsi-Cola, part of PepsiCo Inc., taking
over Mordos' day-to-day duties for North America; he will remain
involved with that important client.
</P>
<P>
   As for tasks meant to receive additional attention, one is
landing new clients, known as business development. Janet Lyons,
42, who had been senior vice president and senior creative director
on accounts like Duracell, HBO and Texaco, is being named to the
new post of business development director.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel we need to put someone in place there,'' Dusenberry
said, ``and Janet will bring a creative aspect to new business in
terms of putting our best foot forward when we're putting pitches
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Sann acknowledged that it was unusual to name a creative
executive to pursue new business, but ``we're a creative-driven
agency and we need someone who understands coming at clients'
problems from that direction.''
</P>
<P>
   The other task in the spotlight is widening the BBDO New York
expertise beyond its specialty of glitzy, big-budget television
commercials as symbolized by the office's lengthy annual list of
Super Bowl spots. (The BBDO New York clients to be seen during the
game on Sunday are Federal Express, Pepsi-Cola's Mountain Dew soft
drink and Visa.)
</P>
<P>
   To that end, John Osborn, 33, who had been senior vice president
and worldwide senior account director, is being named director for
integrated marketing services, which include services like
interactive marketing and direct marketing. He succeeds Susan
Ellis, 46, who joined BBDO New York only 15 months ago in that
capacity from Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos, a unit of the
Interpublic Group of Companies.
</P>
<P>
   In a final change in the management side, Simon Marlow, 53,
executive vice president and managing director on the Duracell and
Gillette accounts, is being named to an additional, new post as
director for multinational account services. In that capacity, he
will take on duties for the account of another PepsiCo unit,
Frito-Lay International.
</P>
<P>
   Turning to the creative side at BBDO New York, Michael Patti,
46, vice chairman and executive creative director, is being
promoted to senior executive creative director, continuing to
oversee creative development for clients like Federal Express, HBO,
Pepsi-Cola and Texaco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael has done some remarkable work,'' Sann said, ``and we
want to recognize that.'' Patti joins Charles R. Miesmer, 53, as
vice chairman and senior executive creative director. Dennis
Berger, 53, and Al Merrin, 53, continue as vice chairmen and
executive creative directors.

<P>
   In a 30-second spot that began running Monday in New Hampshire,
Sen. John McCain of Arizona advances the argument that he is the
most qualified of all the candidates to be the nation's next
commander in chief.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCER: Stevens Reed Curcio &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   ON THE SCREEN: The commercial careers early on between patriotic
images and the horrors of war. It begins with a slow-motion image
of a soldier who is hugging his wife, with the words spoken by the
narrator and superimposed on the screen, ``12,000 Military Families
on Food Stamps.'' Next, a group of veterans are saluting the flag,
an image accompanied by the words, ``Veterans Failing to Get
Benefits.'' A series of quick cuts show tanks firing, smoke
billowing and a Chinese soldier. The camera pans from the soldier's
ominous expression to a huge banner of Mao. As the narrator says,
``There's only one man running for president who knows the military
and understands the world,'' the music softens and the camera shows
McCain speaking forcefully with a battleship for a backdrop. As the
narrator describes McCain's Vietnam War background, the camera
shows a black-and-white photo of a young McCain in his flight suit
preparing for a combat mission over Vietnam and black-and-white
film of McCain recovering in a military hospital. Back in color,
McCain is seen walking with President Ronald Reagan at the White
House, an image that fades into a shot of the sun setting behind
the Iwo Jima memorial. The spot climaxes with a close-up of McCain
speaking with the title: ``Ready to Lead.'' Behind him, American
and prisoner-of-war flags flap in the breeze.
</P>
<P>
   THE SCRIPT: All but the last sentence of the commercial is
spoken by a narrator. ``Over 12,000 military families on food
stamps. Veterans failing to get the benefits they were promised.
International tensions, hot spots and uncertainties around the
globe.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only one man running for president who knows the
military and understands the world. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a navy pilot and POW, he has seen the horrors of war. As a
senator, he's already one of the nation's leaders in knowing how to
keep the peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The commercial closes with McCain saying, ``If America is to
lead, then America's leader must be prepared for that challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   SCORECARD: In nearly all his previous campaign spots, McCain has
prominently featured his heroic past as a gutsy prisoner of war in
North Vietnam. He endured five and a half years of torture and
solitary confinement in Hanoi after his Navy fighter plane was shot
down in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Without mentioning his chief rival, Gov. George W. Bush, this
latest advertisement is intended to make the case that McCain is
better prepared than the Texas governor to lead the nation in a
dangerous world.
</P>
<P>
   The spot offers no details on what McCain proposes to do in
foreign policy, but manages to reinforce McCain's image as a war
hero and influential shaper of military and foreign policy. And it
includes several images from previous biographical commercials,
like the photograph of McCain as a young Navy pilot and the footage
of the senator walking outside the Oval Office with Reagan. To some
viewers, the advertisement may not appear to be a new one.
</P>
<P>
   (Eds: Advertisements for McCain are available from The New York
Times on the Web: www.nytimes.com/politics.)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stepping over the battered orange extension cord
snaking from a 16-gallon Shop Vac, Ellen V. Futter, president of
the American Museum of Natural History, pointed to the floor of the
sleek new $210 million planetarium about her. ``Right now, it's all
about wires,'' she said, her voice competing with a symphony of
power tools.
</P>
<P>
   To her left, three electricians were unwinding 21 spools of red,
white, blue and green wire, activating a wall of video monitors on
a recent afternoon. Upstairs, technicians were tuning the new $3.5
million Zeiss projector. And next door, interviewers were filling
the last of 289 new planetarium jobs, including 37 security guards
and six switchboard operators.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, these days, the museum braces for the onslaught.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 19, the first of as many as a million extra visitors
over the next year will descend on 81st Street and Central Park
West to see the new Rose Center for Earth and Space.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the planetarium had not been a New York City icon for 65
years, this debut would be no ordinary opening. Expressing
everything from jubilation to intense concern, city bureaucrats,
tourism czars, culture sachems and neighborhood naysayers have at
last found themselves in agreement about something: that the impact
of the new building will be off the charts.
</P>
<P>
   The advent of the Rose Center ``is perhaps the single most
important attraction in the city this year,'' said Cristyne F.
Lategano, president of NYC &AMP; Co., formerly known as the New York
Convention and Visitors Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will have a tremendous impact on the city's economy,'' she
said, ``and there will be spinoff benefits to restaurants, retail
shops, hotels and theaters as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the new planetarium is expected to generate an
extra $76 million in retail sales and an additional $5.8 million in
tax revenue for New York City, according to an economic impact
statement prepared for the museum by a consultant, Hamilton,
Rabinovitz &AMP; Alschuler.
</P>
<P>
   To Schuyler G. Chapin, the city's cultural affairs commissioner,
the very-2000 planetarium _ an 87-foot-wide aluminum-clad sphere in
a titanic glass cube _ will be nothing less than ``a new symbol for
New York City,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of the postcards,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But it has to open first. ``There have been moments when we
thought we'd never get it done on time,'' Futter, 50, said of the
six-year construction project.
</P>
<P>
   Work proceeds, feverishly, including moving the speakers inside
the 432-seat Space Theater to eliminate dead spots. And printing
enough floor plans to guide visitors until next May. Cleaning the
construction dust off the touchable bronze model of the moon.
Laying the red-shifted rainbow carpeting on the Cosmic Pathway,
where, at 50 million years a step, visitors can stroll down a
350-foot ramp recapitulating the 13.2-billion-year evolution of the
universe. (Signage designates one spot where the entire span of
human history is represented by a single hair.)
</P>
<P>
   Beyond this, the museum is anticipating planetarium lines so
long that astronomical lecturers are being hired to entertain
standees with impromptu talks on science and space. The spielers
will be kept busy _ according to preliminary estimates _ by about
4.5 million museum visitors next year, a million more than last
year's attendance.
</P>
<P>
   Such a total, exceeding the population of Los Angeles, will come
close to the 5 million yearly visitors to the Metropolitan Museum
of Art, across Central Park. ``Undoubtedly there has been a sibling
rivalry,'' said Chapin, referring to the 19th-century opening date
shared by both institutions (the American Museum was founded in
1869, the Met in 1870), ``but they are a perfect pair, the cultural
anchors of the city.''
</P>
<P>
   In an era when the Met has reigned supreme, will the new hoopla
accorded the long-stodgy American Museum revive this 130-year
rivalry?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very happy to be bookends on a beautiful park,'' Futter
said diplomatically, adding that the increasing number of tourists
coming to the planetarium could benefit the Met's admissions as
well.
</P>
<P>
   The Met ``doesn't consider other museums competition,'' Harold
Holzer, the museum's vice president for communications, commented,
``and we think the Rose Center is a perfect addition to the
neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   That opinion is hardly shared by some in the neighborhood. Three
years after courts rebuffed community law suits trying to block the
new building's construction, the museum still faces opposition from
a dwindling but vocal band of neighbors, some of whom are opposed
to the aesthetic of the new planetarium.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could have put the new Zeiss projector in the original
landmarked Hayden Planetarium and preserved it,'' said Samuel H.
Leff, president of the Community Alliance for Responsible Museum
Development, one of two groups that unsuccessfully sued the museum.
``The city could have saved tens of millions of dollars, but now we
have a glass box with a ball in it that looks like a high-tech
tumor.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``They wanted to put something in there that was very
flashy, so they'd have something like the Pyramide at the Louvre
and get a lot of attention,'' he said, referring to I.M. Pei's
acclaimed addition to the Louvre in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   His organization has substantially declined from 350 members
during the salad days of planetarium insurgency, but Leff claimed
that many in the neighborhood opposed what he called ``the traffic
disaster'' caused by automobile and bus visitors ``and the
additional congestion and pollution in an already densely populated
neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Although dozens of school buses could park in the old
street-surface lot on the planetarium grounds, there is room for
but 10 of them in the Rose Center's new 370-space garage.
</P>
<P>
   School buses, tour buses and the cars of visitors unable to fit
in the garage ``will cruise the neighborhood, parking up and down
the local streets and avenues, causing gridlock,'' Leff said.
``There's a pedestrian safety issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, ``the buses will leave their motors running,
causing pollution,'' he said. ``At the museum they make much of all
their exhibits about ecology and biodiversity, but they're
polluting the community right outside their buildings. They should
be ashamed of themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   But another local group, Friends of Museum Park, insists that
since the population of the West Side has actually declined 25
percent since the 1950s, and since museum attendance was
considerably higher 25 years ago than it was last year, ``the fears
of overcrowding are unfounded,'' said Peter M. Wright, the
organization's president and co-founder.
</P>
<P>
   ``The neighborhood can support more museum visitors,'' Wright
said. But like Leff, Wright is worried about bus parking and
pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about traffic have also been raised by residents of the
Beresford building on 81st Street and Central Park West, who have
another complaint about the museum's future as a much-sought-after
party venue.
</P>
<P>
   At the planetarium's sneak-preview opening party for 1,700 on
New Year's Eve, ``they had outdoor music, which I could hear in my
apartment, and the cheap and ugly psychedelic lights made the
planetarium look like a theme park,'' said Richard Lieb, a lawyer
and Beresford board member who unsuccessfully sued to stop
construction.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa J. Gugenheim, the museum's vice president for government
relations and community affairs, said that since 1995 she and
others at the museum have ``met more than 250 times with members of
the community,'' adding that ``we have, together, modified the
museum's plans where appropriate and possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Gugenheim said the museum regretted ``any inconvenience'' caused
by the New Year's Eve celebration, which was a ``once in a lifetime
event.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the museum would ``limit the use of outdoor amplified
music'' in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Gugenheim claims that the museum has adequate plans to unload
and store the average of 41 school buses each weekday that visit
the museum between 9:30 a.m and 1:30 p.m. She said there is room
both in the Rose Center garage, in legal street-parking spaces and
in a 25-vehicle overflow parking center at 60th Street and West End
Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the 20th Precinct has assigned a traffic
enforcement officer to ticket buses that are illegally parked or
are idling their motors.
</P>
<P>
   The museum is also mounting a joint $1 million advertising
campaign with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to
encourage museum visitors to take public transportation, while
sharing half the $20 million cost of renovating the 81st Street
subway station and the museum's ground floor to accommodate more
visitors and school groups.
</P>
<P>
   Futter said the museum was equally focused on people-moving
inside the Rose Center, because the planetarium ``will change the
nature of how people visit the museum, how long they spend here,
and how often they come back.''
</P>
<P>
   As people swarm into the planetarium from eight entrances,
managers are projecting what they call ``throughput'' that averages
two hours per customer. The museum designers are preparing for
three kinds of visitors: ``streakers, strollers and studiers,''
Futter said.
</P>
<P>
   Streakers, of course, race through; strollers amble about at a
steady pace, and studiers insist on reading every word of every
label.
</P>
<P>
   One nightmare is that ``there will be no throughput,'' said
Barbara D. Gunn, senior vice president for government relations and
community affairs, adding: ``if they find everything fascinating in
the planetarium, they won't want to leave,'' she said, half
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   But some just might go on to study the universe. ``The Rose
Center will be an inspirational venue for communicating science to
young people,'' said Daniel S. Goldin, the administrator of the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration in Washington. ``I'll
never forget my first time at the Hayden Planetarium when I was
7,'' said Goldin, who was raised in the South Bronx. ``For me it
was, well, eureka! It launched my interest in space and
astronomy.''

 &HT;    AFC NOTEBOOK: Kearse makes presence known even on slow days
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Titans defensive end Jevon Kearse, who set an NFL
record for rookies with 14 1/2 sacks this season, didn't have a
sack in Sunday's 33-14 victory over the Jaguars in the AFC
Championship game.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Kearse barely showed up on the stats sheet with only
one solo tackle and an assist.
</P>
<P>
   But Kearse's presence was felt throughout Sunday's game. He
pressured Jaguars quarterback Mark Brunell on several plays,
including a knock-down hit in the fourth quarter that seemed to
irritate Brunell's sprained left knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jevon is certainly affecting games,'' said Titans coach Jeff
Fisher. ``They are trying to account for him, adjusting to him.
He's having an impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Kearse, a first-rounder from Florida, nearly had too much of an
impact in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   With the Titans leading 26-14, the Jaguars were facing
third-and-19 at the Jacksonville 24. Titans defensive tackle Kenny
Holmes knocked the ball out of Brunell's hand as he started his
throwing motion.
</P>
<P>
   Kearse scooped up the loose ball and ran for the end zone. Near
the five-yard line, Kearse tried to lateral the ball to cornerback
Samari Rolle. But Jags receiver Keenan McCardell recovered the ball
at the Jacksonville 11, giving the Jaguars a first down since the
ball changed hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I basically tried to do too much,'' Kearse said. ``I should
have just gotten out of bounds, but I was thinking I wanted to put
the nail in the coffin and try to get to the end zone. It didn't
turn out that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Safety measures
</P>
<P>
   The Titans set an NFL record in the third quarter when they
sacked Brunell in the end zone. It gave Tennessee two safeties in
the postseason. With a club record four safeties during the regular
season, the Titans have six in 19 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a bulldog chasing blood,'' said Titans tackle Josh
Evans, who sacked Brunell with tackle Jason Fisk. ``We smell blood.
We go and get 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   Deja vu
</P>
<P>
   Titans owner Bud Adams, who co-founded the AFL in 1959 with
Kansas City Chiefs owner Lamar Hunt, was presented the Lamar Hunt
Trophy on Sunday by _ who else? _ Lamar Hunt. The trophy goes to
the AFC champion each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's taken me 40 years to get this far, and at least I won't
have to go to the Super Bowl in a wheelchair,'' said Adams, 77.
``We have great fans in Nashville, but we had great fans in
Houston, too. We miss our Houston fans, and we appreciate their
support through the years.''
</P>
<P>
   Last of the originals
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee became the eighth and final of the original AFL
franchises to advance to the Super Bowl. The Titans did so in their
40th season and after relocating from Houston to Nashville and
changing their name from the Oilers. The other seven are the Kansas
City Chiefs, Raiders, New York Jets, Denver Broncos, New England
Patriots, Buffalo Bills and San Diego Chargers. Coincidentally, the
Jets once were known as the Titans.
</P>
<P>
   Home away from home
</P>
<P>
   The Titans have had so many homes in recent history _ four
stadiums in as many years _ that they might not know the difference
in playing at home and on the road. They've won three games in a
row at Jacksonville's Alltel Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say we own it,'' Kearse said. ``But we've put down
a down payment.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans said the Titans had already taken out a mortgage on their
second home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of (our homes),'' Evans said. ``Jacksonville, Houston
and Memphis.''
</P>
<P>
   No excuses
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars were playing without All-Pro left tackle Tony
Boselli, who missed all of the playoffs after tearing a knee
ligament in the regular-season finale. But left guard Ben Coleman,
who moved over in Boselli's absence, wasn't using it as an excuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony does not catch the ball,'' Coleman said. ``Tony does not
fumble the ball. Tony does not turn the ball over. We felt they
didn't stop us all game, but when you turn the ball over, you can't
win. If Tony was out there, all the fire in the world could not
have kept the ball in our receivers' hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Extra points

   Maybe they should call it the Mayflower Bowl. Both Super Bowl
franchises, until they won their respective conference
championships, were known more for their relocations than their
performance _ the St. Louis Rams from Anaheim; the Tennessee Titans
(formerly the Houston Oilers). . . . One San Francisco area writer
walking through the Hyatt Regency media center Monday while snow
flurries were pelting Peachtree Street: ``I should have brought my
skis.'' . . . With warm weather being so important at a Super Bowl
for so many people, has Atlanta struck out twice? Temperatures were
mild early in the week in 1994, then dropped to the 40s. This year
we'll be lucky to top 40 degrees. . . . Something you never saw
Chuck Noll or Tom Landry doing: Fisher was walking through the
locker room with an AFC champions T-shirt over his Titans coaches
shirt Sunday afternoon in Alltel Stadium. . . . The Titans are the
most likely to lead in press conference late arrivals or no-shows.
The AFC team drew the early shift and will meet with the media at
their Buckhead Grand Hyatt headquarters Wednesday and Thursday from
8:15-9:30 a.m. The Rams need not report until 10:15 a.m. . . .
Titans cornerback Dainon Sydney, a third-round draft choice in
1998, is an Atlanta native who played at Riverdale High School. . .
. Titans linebacker Eddie Robinson almost sounded like he felt
sorry for the Jaguars _ three time losers this year who beat
everyone else they played. ``I hope one day they can get there,''
Robinson said, referring to the Super Bowl. ``They have a great
owner and great fans. I feel real close to those guys.'' . . .
Jaguars offensive tackle Leon Searcy's advice to the St. Louis Rams
in regard to McNair: ``His scrambling will kill you. He's a 6-4,
245-pound quarterback. You can't tackle him high.'' . . . Titans
17-year guard Bruce Matthews, on inspiration they received from the
Nashville fans, in spite of the team's nomadic existence: ``We got
the spark going, and a little flame, and they just poured fuel on
it.'' . . . Phil Simms of CBS after the Titans took control of the
AFC title game in the third quarter: ``I don't know what Jeff
Fisher does at halftime, but I want a copy of that speech.''

BILL GATES AND HIS WIFE DONATE $5 BILLION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JUAN FORERO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation said Monday that Bill
Gates, the billionaire founder of Microsoft Corp., and his wife
have donated $5 billion to their philanthropic foundation, making
it the world's wealthiest foundation, with assets of $21.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   With the gift, the Seattle-based foundation squeaked past
Britain's Wellcome Trust, which has assets of $21.4 billion,
according to the Chronicle of Philanthropy, a publication that
covers nonprofit organizations and ranks them by the size of their
assets. The second-largest foundation in the United States is the
Ford Foundation, with assets of $13.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Stacy Palmer, editor of the Washington-based publication, called
the gift ``really quite staggering'' and said it reinforces the
foundation's position as a trendsetter in the philanthropic world.
``It's only in the past year that people have taken their
philanthropy very seriously,'' Ms. Palmer said of Gates and his
wife. ``They plan to continue to put their money in, and, I think,
that's what will make them so exciting to watch in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The foundation, which the Gateses established last year through
the merging of other foundations of theirs, has in recent months
received worldwide attention with news of its large commitments.
</P>
<P>
   In September the foundation pledged at least $1 billion to pay
for full scholarships over the next 20 years for minority students
in the fields of education, math, science and engineering. Then in
November the fund said it would donate $750 million over five years
to help international health organizations vaccinate children in
developing countries against deadly diseases.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the foundation gave about $800 million last year and
made commitments of more than $2 billion, said Trevor Neilson, a
spokesman for the fund.
</P>
<P>
   Neilson said that the foundation's mission is, in large part, to
improve health conditions in poor countries and further educational
opportunities for disadvantaged students in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Gates, in an interview with The New York Times last September,
said he hoped his philanthropy would provide opportunities to
minorities, who he noted were underrepresented in high-tech
industries. ``Nobody can deny that there is a huge gap,
particularly in these key areas, for minority students, and the
financial barriers are a substantial element in that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the foundation said the Gateses plan to give more.
``Bill and Melinda have always said that they're committed to
giving away the vast majority of their wealth, and this is just a
part of that process,'' said Neilson. To keep its tax-exempt
status, the fund must give away at least 5 percent of its endowment
each year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Palmer of the Chronicle of Philanthropy said the foundation
is very different from other traditional foundations in that the
main donors _ Bill and Melinda Gates _ are alive and active in
deciding who receives benefits. ``It's pretty significant
involvement,'' Ms. Palmer said. ``The reason you see them doing
such ambitious projects is because the donors are alive and they
say, `Yeah, that looks like a good project.'''

AILEY DISCIPLE CONTINUES THE TRADITION OF HIS MASTERPIECES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By WAYNE LEE GAY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his autobiography, ``Revelations,'' choreographer Alvin Ailey
described himself as ``a man from small-town Texas who never forgot
walking through dirt with his mother as a child, looking for a
place to live.''
</P>
<P>
   It is these memories of a poor, rural childhood _ oppression,
religion and the resilience of the human spirit _ that Ailey used
to ignite one of the most acclaimed modern dance troupes of our
time. In his most famous work, ``Revelations,'' Ailey turned the
images of people swept up in the movements of small-church gospel
and praise _ for example, the power of Jesus pushing a woman
through the aisles like a locomotive _ into one of the most widely
performed works in modern dance.
</P>
<P>
   Today, more than 10 years after his death, the vitality of the
Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater is an artistic force that lives
on. The renowned modern dance company returned to Fort Worth, after
an absence of two decades, for two performances at Bass Performance
Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Ailey was an incredibly brave genius _ an African-American who
had the gumption to create a modern dance company in New York in
1958, during the civil rights struggle, in an age of racial
stereotyping. He died of AIDS in 1989, already a living legend, but
disturbed, depressed and estranged from many of the people who had
been closest to him.
</P>
<P>
   One of those people with whom he had worked, quarreled, parted
and reconciled is devoted to making sure that his name lives on.
Judith Jamison, whose legendary reputation in the modern dance
community nearly rivals that of her mentor, directs the Alvin Ailey
Dance Theater and is determined to carry the Ailey tradition well
into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   Jamison was both a disciple and an inspiration for Ailey. It was
for her that he created several of his masterpieces. But her own
accomplishments as a dancer and choreographer extended far beyond
her association with Ailey; her range extends from ``Sophisticated
Ladies'' to the mythical Medea. It was for her own accomplishments,
not for her association with Ailey, that she was named a 1999
Kennedy Center honoree.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Philadelphia, Jamison arrived at the company in 1965,
full of adoration for Ailey but with a firm, anchored personality
that contrasted sharply to his. ``My relationship with Alvin was
based on total awe of his accomplishments as a director,
choreographer and human being,'' Jamison wrote in her
autobiography, after his death. ``Alvin could be as loving as he
could be insulting.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, Ailey, eventually found to be
manic-depressive, continued to have an erratic, creative and
brilliant career, with his company periodically rescued from
financial ruin and disorganization by devoted patrons; Jamison
moved on to dance with other companies and on Broadway in the
1980s. However, seeing the end coming, Ailey asked Jamison to take
over as artistic director after his death.
</P>
<P>
   Talking by telephone between New York performances of the Alvin
Ailey company in New York a few weeks ago, Jamison, 56, exuded
electric energy.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the great things about the Alvin Ailey American Dance
Theater is that we know where we come from, the legacy that Ailey
left,'' Jamison says. ``We have one foot in the past and one in the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the company can hardly be described as simply
African-American, though Jamison says that ``the African-American
experience and the modern dance experience'' are the troupe's two
basic themes. It even transcends the label ``American'' in its huge
influence on modern dance. And the company is a titan in the world
of modern dance. While modern dance companies typically run on
shoestring budgets, the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater operates
with a staff of 31 dancers, an annual budget of $12 million, a
monthlong annual season at City Center in New York and an
impressive national and international touring schedule every year.
</P>
<P>
   And through the years, under Ailey until his death and under
Jamison since then, the company has been a major force in
redefining modern dance. Modern dance repertory has traditionally
been short-lived, but Ailey and his company built a large repertory
of ``classics'' _ including, most notably, the company's enduring
signature piece, Ailey's own ``Revelations.'' And ``Revelations''
represents a direct link to Ailey's own Texas origins.
</P>
<P>
   Divided into three segments, ``Pilgrim of Sorrow,'' ``Take Me to
the Water'' and ``Move, Members, Move,'' ``Revelations'' is set to
traditional spirituals that Ailey heard in church while growing up
in rural Texas, and it draws on memories of people he saw and knew
in those ecstatic, small-town African-American church services.
</P>
<P>
   Dancers who participated in the creation and premiere of
``Revelations'' later recalled for Ailey biographer Jennifer
Dunning how Ailey, years and miles away from the church services of
his childhood, talked about the amply bosomed church ladies who had
to lean forward and spread their legs to stay cool in the hot
church building, and about the lady who would periodically rise
from her seat and churn through the congregation like a train in
motion. These vivid memories were transformed into a choreography
that captured, and continues to capture, the public imagination in
what has become one of the most widely performed dance pieces of
all time.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Kreiman, executive director of Contemporary Dance/Fort
Worth, remembers the first time she saw ``Revelations,'' as a
student at the American Dance Festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to get up and dance,'' Kreiman recalls. ``It's
one of the dance masterpieces of the 20th century. It's a beautiful
piece with a wonderful series of group dances, solo dances, trios
and duets. It's wonderful in its portrayal of religion, spirit and
community. And it's truly American.''

UNDATED: xxx truly American.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Born in 1931 in Rogers, Texas, Ailey absorbed those generous
doses of the local culture before moving to Los Angeles at age 10
during the wartime economic boom. There, he entered the world of
professional dance while still a teen-ager, falling under the
influence of iconoclastic choreographer Lester Horton.
</P>
<P>
   New York inevitably followed, with more study and teaching,
dancing on Broadway and with modern dance companies _ and a
bohemian lifestyle that was a long way from Rogers. Already
well-known on Broadway by the late 1950s, Ailey turned in a
completely different direction for the creation of the Alvin Ailey
American Dance Theater, a company described by Dunning as ``a
harmonious mix of extroverted show dancers and `serious' modern
dancers.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's first performances at the 92nd Street Y in New
York stand as one of the most significant moments in the history of
American dance, both as a turning point for all modern dance and as
the foundation of the emergence of serious, artistic
African-American dance.
</P>
<P>
   The company today remains devoted to Ailey's principles. Its
large repertory of 182 works continues to balance permanent works
such as ``Revelations,'' now approaching its 40th anniversary, with
new pieces, such as Jawole Willa Jo Zollar's ``C-sharp Street _
B-flat Avenue,'' and Ron Brown's ``Grace.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Ailey's ballets will always be an important part of the
reportoire of the company, and are among the great classics of the
modern dance repertoire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alvin's ballets are terrific because they're human and humane,
like he was,'' says Bruce Wood, founding director of Fort Worth's
Bruce Wood Dance Company.
</P>
<P>
   Though Jamison's personality is different from Ailey's, she
shares his focus on the dancers. He called them his gods and
goddesses, she praises them for their versatility and
voraciousness.
</P>
<P>
   As Jamison wrote not long after assuming the mantle of artistic
director of the company, ``I don't feel as though I'm standing in
anyone's shoes. I'm standing on Alvin's shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   Ailey never forgot his childhood, and transformed those
experiences artistically. And because he never forgot, he will not
be forgotten. ___ &QC;

 &HT;    IOWA NOTEBOOK: Candidates pack up, head to New Hampshire
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the Iowa caucuses over, everyone is heading to New
Hampshire. Unlike Iowa, New Hampshire's races on both the
Republican and Democratic sides are too close to call _ thanks to
independent voters and effective appeals from well-funded
insurgents.
</P>
<P>
   The polls suggest both John McCain and Bill Bradley post strong
challenges to the respective national front-runners _ George W.
Bush and Al Gore _ in part because they have spent so much time
there and have surged in fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa and New Hampshire are potential momentum machines to propel
candidates through contests in other early primary states. This
year, the sprint is especially intense, because about
three-quarters of the parties' national convention delegates will
be chosen by March 15.
</P>
<P>
   Gore plays down report of pot use
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore denied Monday that he smoked marijuana regularly, even
daily, with a Tennessee friend as late as 1976, as the man now
contends. The question came up when a reporter said to Gore at a
diner: ``It's been reported that after you came back from Vietnam
you were smoking on a daily basis.'' Gore responded, ``No. When I
came back from Vietnam, yes, but not to that extent. ... This is
something I dealt with a long time ago. It's old news.'' The
Tennessee man, John Warnecke, was quoted by the online magazine
Salon.
</P>
<P>
   Weather no factor in wintry state
</P>
<P>
   The weather wasn't a problem for Monday's presidential caucuses.
It was chilly across the state, with a smattering of snow here and
there, but that's to be expected _ since it's winter. The
temperature highs were in the teens in northeast Iowa, with some
light snow. In the southeastern part of the state, it got up into
the low 40s _ considered downright balmy for this time of year.
</P>
<P>
   This, folks, is what it's all about in Iowa
</P>
<P>
   Morris Smith, a 70-year-old farmer from Creston, Iowa, has
participated in the Democratic caucuses for 20 years, at times
holding them in his home, and he's a believer in the system because
it gives him a chance to hear firsthand from the candidates or
their supporters. ``It's great politics. It's grass-roots. It's not
somebody off in Washington telling you why you should be supporting
this person,'' Smith says. ``I don't think politics can get any
better than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Students' choice: mix and match
</P>
<P>
   Students at Iowa State University in Ames had a caucus-day
choice beyond just voting. On one side of the student union was a
rally for Republican George W. Bush. Across the hall was a similar
turnout for Democrat Bill Bradley. The two campaigns intersected
for a moment. Sen. Bob Kerrey (D-Neb.), who is backing Bradley,
went over to Bush. He wasn't looking for trouble; he just wanted to
shake hands and say hello.
</P>
<P>
   Interest lagging in rest of country
</P>
<P>
   In the week before today's caucuses, a poll by the Shorenstein
Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy found that
two-thirds of the voters nationally were paying only a little or no
attention to the campaign, and that 70 percent said they had no
favorite candidate. If the race is declared over before they tune
in, many political observers suggest it could only further voter
disaffection and the decline in turnout.
</P>
<P>
   Talking about how to talk about it
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush's campaign got caught in a contradiction about
how the candidate will be made available for future questioning.
One spokeswoman, Mindy Tucker, said formal meetings between
reporters and Bush were being cut back because they can harm ``the
message of the day.'' Later, Bush communications chief Karen Hughes
said no, Bush would continue to be available, but on an informal
basis that befits a ``much more drop-in, much more drop-by''
campaign style.

ABC NETWORK CHIEF NAMED NO. 2 AT DISNEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also DISNEY-IGER) 
(mk) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Michael Eisner, chairman of Walt Disney Co., on
Monday named Robert A. Iger, the ABC network chief, as his
second-in-command in a restructuring of Disney's top management.
</P>
<P>
   In appointing Iger as president and chief operating officer,
Eisner sent a clear signal that he viewed the 48-year-old chairman
of the Disney-owned ABC Group as a potential heir to run the Disney
empire.
</P>
<P>
   The succession issue at Disney has bothered Wall Street and
shareholders since Eisner's heart surgery in 1994 and the death of
his longtime No. 2, Frank Wells, in a helicopter crash the same
year. Eisner sought to replace him with Michael Ovitz, but the
former agent was dismissed after 16 months in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Since then Disney has seen an exodus of potential heirs,
including the former chief financial officers, Stephen Bollenbach
and Richard Nanula; former ABC executives Geraldine Laybourne and
Steve Burke, and Joe Roth, former chairman of Disney studios, who
left last month.
</P>
<P>
   Eisner, who promoted several other Disney executives on Monday,
made it evident that the new job was a test for Iger. ``This is the
first step in shuffling the chairs at court,'' said Christopher
Dixon, an entertainment analyst at Paine Webber. ``The challenge
for Bob is to demonstrate that he can manage the very strong
individual unit heads and implement the strategy of the board and
Michael Eisner.''
</P>
<P>
   Eisner's decision to name Iger, a silken, charming and
well-liked executive, who also served as president of Walt Disney
International, came after a troubled year of executive defections
at Disney and stagnant stock prices. The company has been beset by
slumping home video earnings, declines in licensing and
merchandising and a drop-off in store sales.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday Disney posted some positive financial news. With
strong performances from its theme parks, broadcasting and cable
operations _ including the No. 1 television show in the nation,
``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' and the hit sequel film ``Toy
Story 2'' _ Disney posted a 9 percent rise in fiscal first quarter
profits. This excluded the company's Go.com Internet business,
which is expected to post a loss. Revenue rose 5 percent to $6.8
billion. Operating income increased 8 percent to $1.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's stock fell 1/4 to 32 1/2 on The New York Stock
Exchange, but jumped in after-hours trading. The announcements came
after trading ended.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the succession issue, Eisner, who is 57, said in an
interview that the appointment of Iger ``was not about that at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Eisner said, ``I guess the media may make something out of it,
but my view is we needed a president and chief operating officer
and that job should be on the board of directors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody in America is better trained for this job than Bob,''
said Eisner. He said Iger would serve as his ``partner'' at Disney,
and that the two men had been discussing the new job for about two
years. He said Iger had played a central role in the integration of
ABC into the Disney organization, following Disney's $19 billion
merger with Cap Cities, which owned ABC.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Eisner said, ``it became apparent that I
needed Bob.'' He said, ``ABC was strong, we had consolidated the
Disney studio and ABC. ABC was strong in management and
performance, and selfishly I wanted Bob at that point.''
</P>
<P>
   Eisner also announced the promotion of Disney's chief strategic
officer, Peter Murphy, and chief financial officer, Thomas O.
Staggs, to senior vice presidents. They will become members of a
new executive committee that will include Eisner, Iger, Disney vice
chairman Stanford M. Litvack and heads of individual business
units.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new corporate structure, Murphy will report to Eisner
and Iger. But vice chairman Roy E. Disney, Litvack and Staggs will
report to Eisner.
</P>
<P>
   Iger, asked about the challenges he faces, declined to discuss
too many specifics about the new job. ``I'd be wrong to say it
wasn't a big challenge,'' he said. ``But I can't point to any one
specific direction. There are ongoing challenges, but I don't view
this as daunting.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Eisner said that Disney's involvement with digital
technology was certainly a factor in Iger's appointment. ``We have
to define where we'll be in the Digital Age,'' said Eisner. ``As
far as strategy and maintenance of what we have, Bob will be the
key planner in this.''
</P>
<P>
   Eisner, who also spoke to financial analysts on Monday,
cautioned them that he maintains ``conservative'' expectations for
the year. But he added, ``It's nice to start 2000 on a positive
note.'' Disney's strong profits were paced, in part, by the ABC and
ESPN-TV divisions that Iger had overseen.
</P>
<P>
   Eisner also sought to end speculation that Disney may merge with
an Internet company. ``I don't feel the need for anything but being
independent,'' said Eisner. ``We are big enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Financial analysts said Monday evening that the Iger appointment
was a positive one for Disney, but that Eisner's aggressive
personality and his seeming reluctance to yield too much power
makes the No. 2 position difficult. But strengthening management at
Disney was crucial, the analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dynamic world of media and online opportunities is
changing so rapidly that Disney needs to have a stronger senior
management footprint to capitalize on these changes,'' observed
Jill Krutick, an entertainment analyst at Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Krutick said, ``Being president doesn't mean Iger's the
definite successor.'' She added: ``He certainly looks as if he has
a much better shot. But everyone's being constantly tested and
performance is what counts.''

AMGEN TO RELEASE QUARTERLY EARNINGS

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Analysts believe Amgen Inc. will only meet the
expectations of Wall Street rather than exceed them as the company
has done for five quarters running.
</P>
<P>
   The company based in Thousand Oaks north of Los Angeles reports
its fourth-quarter results after the markets close Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Amgen is expected to show earnings of 25 cents per share for the
quarter and 97 cents per share for the year, according to Thomson
Financial's First Call service.
</P>
<P>
   If Amgen exceeds estimates, it will have been caused by patients
stocking up for the year 2000 changeover, said Doug Christopher, an
analyst with Los Angeles-based Crowell Weedon &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   There has been speculation among analysts that the company is
close to seeking federal approval for two of its in-development
drugs: red blood cell stimulator NESP and the rheumatoid arthritis
drug Kineret.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will file when they're ready,'' Christopher said. ``We're
talking about people's lives and the long term. We're not talking
about filing just to please investors.''
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Meirav Chovav of Salomon Smith Barney issued a research
report in December stating her belief that the company already has
filed with the FDA for approval of the two drugs.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Chovav increased her price target to $70 from
$56. The stock price has since surpassed that mark, but slid
$5.4375 lower in trading Monday to close at $69.25 per share.

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Dr. Steven Weinberg is perhaps the world's most
authoritative proponent of the idea that physics is hurtling toward
a ``final theory,'' a complete explanation of nature's particles
and forces that will endure as the bedrock of all science
forevermore. He is also a powerful writer whose prose can
illuminate _ and sting.
</P>
<P>
   His withering essay on the dangers of utopian thought was
prominently featured in this month's Atlantic Monthly. The third
volume of his ``Quantum Theory of Fields,'' a weighty work on
matter and energy at its most fundamental levels, is soon to be
released by Cambridge University Press. And he recently received
the Lewis Thomas Prize, awarded to the researcher who best embodies
``the scientist as poet.''
</P>
<P>
   All of this combines two of his major passions: theoretical
physics, which won him a Nobel Prize in 1979, and his often
polemical writings on culture, religion, philosophy and, in
particular, the history and politics of science.
</P>
<P>
   At 66, he shows little sign of cutting back.
</P>
<P>
   Weinberg, who grew up in the Bronx, N.Y., and is now a professor
of physics and astronomy at the University of Texas, has little
patience with the attempts by philosophers to explain how and why
scientific theories are constructed, an activity that he regards as
a squirrelly intrusion on working scientists. He dislikes any
suggestions that the ``truths'' of science might to some degree be
artificially constructed, and therefore subject to change by
different human cultures at different times.
</P>
<P>
   As for human spirituality, ``I don't even know what it means,''
he said. He sees no redeeming value in religion and considers it
nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   But though his writing reveals him to be a sometimes hard-edged
thinker who follows the evidence without regard to tradition or
sentiment, face-to-face he is frankly romantic, deeply touched by
music and poetry in ways he admits reason can never justify or
explain. ``I love grand opera,'' he abruptly confessed in an
interview in his book-lined study. ``I can't hear `La Boheme'
without dissolving.''
</P>
<P>
   He enjoys hanging out with politicians, artists, writers and
ranchers, and has friends outside the university orbit, in the
heart of the Bible Belt. ``There's a lot of good humor here,'' he
said, adding that when he expounds his views on religion a common
reaction goes something like, ``There's old Steve. He will go on
that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinberg was driving his red Camaro to work at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology in 1967 when he had an idea that changed
physics. He realized that it might be possible to use a
paradoxical-sounding idea about nature's fundamental order called
broken symmetry to find the underlying unity in two of nature's
four known forces or interactions.
</P>
<P>
   The first, called electromagnetism, involves the everyday forces
applied by electric and magnetic fields, and the second, called the
weak force, causes the radioactive decay of elements like radium
and uranium. Electromagnetic forces are thousands of times as
strong as the weak interaction, and they are transmitted by a
particle with no mass, called the photon. As it turns out, the weak
interaction is transmitted by very heavy particles called the W and
Z.
</P>
<P>
   But as he drove along in his Camaro, Weinberg saw that the same
equations could describe the two interactions if a kind of energy,
called a scalar field, permeated all of space. The field would in
effect nudge the interactions in different directions, so that the
underlying symmetry of the equations was broken, or hidden.
</P>
<P>
   Physicists are still searching for direct evidence of that field
_ it should spawn something called the Higgs particle _ but they
have accepted Weinberg's idea, now called the electroweak theory.
His paper explaining it became the most frequently cited paper in
the recent history of particle physics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was absolutely like lightning suddenly flashed,'' said Dr.
Freeman Dyson, a physicist at the Institute for Advanced Study in
Princeton. ``It was immediately obvious that it was great.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, Dr. Abdus Salam, a physicist from Pakistan, and Dr.
Sheldon L. Glashow, a classmate of Weinberg at the Bronx High
School of Science, shared the Nobel Prize for the work.
</P>
<P>
   The core of the electroweak theory went on to inspire a
successful and experimentally verified theory of the strong force,
which holds atomic nuclei together. The results were bundled
together in what physicists call the Standard Model, a theory that
includes all the known forces except gravity and amounts to a
particle physicist's bible.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Edward Witten, a physicist at the Institute for Advanced
Study, described the theoretical innovations at the heart of the
electroweak theory as ``the main lessons of elementary particle
physics in the last half century.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond his many research papers, Weinberg has also made a mark
with writings that include scientific monographs like ``Gravitation
and Cosmology'' and ``The Quantum Theory of Fields,'' popular books
like ``Dreams of a Final Theory'' and ``The First Three Minutes: A
Modern View of the Origin of the Universe,'' and articles and
essays on culture and science in publications like The New York
Review of Books, Scientific American and George magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Weinberg was born on May 3, 1933, and he grew up so close
to Yankee Stadium that ``the lights kept you up at night,'' he
said. His mother and his paternal grandfather had immigrated from
Europe. Much of his mother's family in Germany perished in the
Holocaust. His father made a living as a court stenographer.
</P>
<P>
   As a boy, he absorbed classical music on the radio and learned
chemistry from a hand-me-down set, ChemCraft (NU)5. Despite his
proximity to the ballpark, he was not a sports fan. (He still
prefers baseball to football because, he said, it is easier to tell
who has the ball.)
</P>
<P>
   At Bronx Science, where ``it was considered very uncool not to
have learned calculus on your own,'' he began to blossom as a
physics student, particularly after he encountered a popular book
by Sir James Jeans that mentioned quantum physics, and its
mysterious equations and engrossing idea that nature was based on
simple but powerful laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was something at the bottom that was much simpler than
the appearance,'' he said. ``That was the cutting edge of
knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   He attended Cornell on scholarship, where he studied physics and
fell in love with a fellow student after hearing her sing in a
student production. They married, and today Louise Weinberg is a
professor of law at the University of Texas.

 &HT;    Overuse of antibiotics not a good idea with flu
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The cold and flu season brings an increased use
of antibiotics just as surely as December brings heavier jackets.
The difference is, the heavier jackets actually help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Antibiotics only work on bacteria. The flu and colds are
viruses,'' says Kim Massie, regional pharmacy manager for United
Healthcare.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say antibiotics are useless for winter miseries.
Bacteria still cause a lot of infections, particularly in
children's ears. Antibiotics are even appropriate for the infirm
elderly with flu and colds, or chronic heart, asthma and diabetic
patients who also are more susceptible to secondary infections.
</P>
<P>
   But they're widely overused, research shows. Besides wasting
money, unnecessary antibiotics also can cause new symptoms, weaken
a person's defense against future bacterial infections and help
breed super germs that no medicine can treat.
</P>
<P>
   Barely half of the 145 million prescriptions for antibiotics
outside hospitals each year are medically justified, National
Academy of Science researchers concluded in a 1997 study. In a
Gallup poll of 1,000 adults last year, seven of 10 said they had
received antibiotics to treat the flu.
</P>
<P>
   Despite heightened publicity about antibiotics and viruses,
Massie says United's customers used 11 percent more antibiotics
last year than in 1998, without any evidence of increased bacterial
infections. For the peak of last year's flu season from Feb. 1 to
March 15, the increase was 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   When people go to the doctor, Massie says, they want to come
home with something more than a pep talk on fluids and bed rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't want to just hear the stuff their grandmothers told
them,'' says Dr. Norman Schneiderman, medical director of Miami
Valley Hospital's emergency and trauma center. Every doctor gives
in at times and writes the prescription instead of arguing, he
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``They get a lot of pressure,'' Massie says. `` `I have a 101
fever. I've had this headache for three days.

 &HT;    FDA gets in on flu drug action
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ This is the first flu season when Americans have
access to drugs that treat most forms of influenza without many
side effects.
</P>
<P>
   So naturally the Food and Drug Administration already has found
it prudent to issue a warning on the drugs' misuse.
</P>
<P>
   While some doctors have used them in cases where they're
useless, others have used them instead of different treatments that
seriously ill patients needed. Three elderly flu patients had died
of untreated complications when the FDA announced its warning Jan.
12.
</P>
<P>
   The makers of Relenza and Tamiflu have publicized their new
drugs so heavily that Dr. Heidi Jolson, the FDA's antiviral chief,
said she was concerned that doctors were considering them to the
exclusion of everything else. Antibiotics, she said, still are
necessary to prevent secondary infections in chronically ill and
weakened elderly patients, such as the three who died.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA also said it had ordered Relenza's manufacturer in
November to stop showing television ads that overstated its
effectiveness. And it warned that Relenza inhalants should not be
prescribed to anyone with asthma or other lung diseases because
they could trigger asthma attacks or wheezing.
</P>
<P>
   Both new drugs must be administered within 48 hours of the first
flu symptoms to be effective at all.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, they've been shown to shorten the duration of
symptoms by no more than a day and a half. The nasal Relenza also
is allowed to claim a 28 percent reduction in complications, while
oral Tamiflu can claim a 30 percent to 40 percent reduction of
symptoms' severity.
</P>
<P>
   The British National Health Service doesn't pay for Relenza, the
only one approved in Great Britain, saying it's not cost-effective.
Locally, UnitedHealthcare imposes its highest co-payments on the
drug because its benefits appear to be so limited.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard a couple of very good anecdotes, but those are from
physicians who put themselves on it,'' says Dr. Norman Schneiderman
of Miami Valley Hospital. ``Physicians tend to recognize their
diseases early.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest obstacle to the drugs' effectiveness is the 48-hour
window. Only 28 percent of Americans saw a health care professional
the last time they had the flu, according to a recent Gallup survey
of 1,000 adults for the maker of Tamiflu. ``And those who did
waited two days or more after they developed flu symptoms,'' said
the manufacturer, Hoffman-LaRoche.
</P>
<P>
   The new drugs aren't viral equivalents of antibiotics, says
Schneiderman. While antibiotics kill bacteria, Relenza and Tamiflu
merely disable the enzyme that enables the influenza A and B
viruses to spread to new cells.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are the new drugs effective for the many maladies with
flulike symptoms that aren't actually influenza, Schneiderman says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid that people aren't going to get flu shots or worry
about the flu because they think they've got this magic bullet,''
he says. ``It's not. The final verdict is not in yet on these
drugs, but they do not appear to have the miraculous efficacy or
safety of antibiotics.''

 AUSTIN, Texas: of Texas. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a ``wonderful, romantic first year'' in Copenhagen,
Denmark, where he did research at what is now called the Niels Bohr
Institute, the couple returned to the United States, where he
earned his Ph.D. at Princeton and worked at a series of
universities, including Columbia, the University of California at
Berkeley, MIT and Harvard, where Ms. Weinberg studied law. In 1980,
she won an appointment at the law school at the University of
Texas, and in 1982 he followed her there.
</P>
<P>
   It was there that he carried out the biggest battle of his
professional career. He and other physicists believed they would
need a gigantic particle accelerator to find the Higgs particle;
eventually the government proposed building it near Waxahachie,
Texas. But vigorous lobbying by scientists could not overcome
congressional dismay over delays and high costs for the
multibillion-dollar Superconducting Supercollider, and Congress
killed it in 1993. Weinberg attributed its death to overzealous
cost-cutting by freshman Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Though the loss of the collider was a terrible blow to
physicists in the United States _ many believe leadership in the
field has shifted now to Europe _Weinberg has happy memories of the
battle, recalling with particular fondness an appearance on the
``MacNeil-Lehrer News Hour'' with Sen. Phil Gramm, a conservative
Texas Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the only time Phil Gramm and I were aligned,'' said
Weinberg, whose politics are sharply liberal.
</P>
<P>
   Today, one of his major battles is with postmodernist thinkers
and philosophers of science who maintain that scientific theories
reflect not objective reality but social negotiations among
scientists. In its rawest form, this philosophy would say that the
theories of the most persuasive or politically powerful scientists
become accepted fact.
</P>
<P>
   Weinberg wrote of one such book on the subject, ``Constructing
Quarks,'' by Dr. Andrew Pickering, that social negotiations in
research are similar to the planning that mountain climbers might
undertake together before tackling Mount Everest. But no one would
think of writing a book called ``Constructing Everest,'' Weinberg
said; once they had seen the mountain peak, most people would
accept that it, like the elementary particles that leave their
traces in particle detectors, had been shown to exist and had not
been ``constructed'' by social agreement.
</P>
<P>
   In general, Weinberg said, he believes that ``half-baked
philosophy has sometimes gotten in the way of doing science.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there are his pronouncements on religion and deism,
including his much-quoted aphorism, ``The more the universe seems
comprehensible, the more it also seems pointless.''
</P>
<P>
   But Weinberg professes belief in his own kind of conviction, the
idea that the scientific effort to uncover a complete theory of the
universe is one of the things that can in itself add dignity and
meaning to human existence.
</P>
<P>
   As for conventional religion, though, his views are
uncompromising: It is not only silly but damaging to human
civilization.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole history of the last thousands of years has been a
history of religious persecutions and wars, pogroms, jihads,
crusades,'' he said. ``I find it all very regrettable, to say the
least.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Weinberg does occasionally entertain the possibility
that there might be a God. While sitting in his study, with its
striking view of Lake Austin, he imagined himself in the role of
the biblical Abraham, whose faith God tested by commanding that he
sacrifice his own son.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if there is a God,'' Weinberg said, ``how do you know
that his moral judgments are the correct ones? Seems to me Abraham
should have said, `God, that's just not right.'''

 &HT;    Don't confuse mental illness with character weaknesses
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Major League Baseball's order that repulsive
Atlanta Braves pitcher John Rocker undergo psychological testing is
not just appalling because it's trying to cure bigotry the way the
Soviets used to cure capitalism or individuality.
</P>
<P>
   The order also is shameful because it reinforces the bigoted
misconceptions that mental illness is a character weakness and that
psychology is at odds with personal responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Those myths underlie the stigma and insurance inequities that
are primary reasons that most Americans with legitimate mental
disorders don't seek treatment, as Dr. David Satcher announced two
months ago in the most significant U.S. Surgeon General's report
since the one saying tobacco was not a healthy vegetable.
</P>
<P>
   Mental illnesses, from anxiety disorders to schizophrenia, are
not moral flaws any more than diabetes, another disease of
imbalanced body chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   And psychological treatment of mental disorders _ outside the
hands of lawyers _ increases a person's responsibility instead of
absolving it. Good treatment provides tools, not excuses. If you
gave a wastebasket to a family with trash all over the floor, can
you imagine someone saying you were excusing and encouraging the
family's filth?
</P>
<P>
   Rocker's insults of women, Japanese, foreigners, homosexuals,
blacks and New Yorkers in Sports Illustrated last month were
contemptible and indefensible, compounded by his belligerent lack
of contrition. He deserves the public condemnation he's getting.
But if anything about his comments betrayed a mental illness, it
wasn't bigotry. Prejudice is sadly universal, based on people's
size, shape, age and motor skills if not race, ethnicity and sexual
orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly expressing these prejudices, however, could indicate a
mental illness ``that affects your ability to control your actions
or your ability to understand reality,'' psychiatrist Dr. Walter
Reich of George Washington University wrote online in Slate
magazine. But MLB's order had less a spirit of ``Let's get this guy
some help'' than of ``Let's punish this guy for staining our good
name.''
</P>
<P>
   The broader problem with baseball's action is that it presumes
to police thoughts. The recent history of centrally prohibited
thoughts has been one of death camps, not increased tolerance. Even
today and even in churches, there are places where belief in the
equality of women and gays is frowned on.
</P>
<P>
   The medical problem here, Reich writes, is that bad people
aren't necessarily mad. ``The widespread tendency to turn to
psychiatry when dealing with moral transgressions . . . damages not
only society but also psychiatry.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of accepted psychiatric diagnoses rose from 60 in
1952 to 410 in 1994, not in order to give lawyers more ways of
getting criminals off but to give doctors and therapists more
specific ways of treating disorders.
</P>
<P>
   So ``rage disorder'' is diagnosed not so a person can say, ``I
can't help it,'' but so he can say, ``I can find out how to help
it,'' by using new coping strategies and medication. Only by
manipulating these diagnoses with unconscionable cynicism do people
try to absolve a cad or criminal by citing ``lottery stress
disorder'' or ``gay panic.''
</P>
<P>
   But people tend to mistake explanations for excuses, as Hillary
Clinton learned last year. When she attributed her husband's skirt
chasing partly to family conflicts in his childhood, her
explanation was ridiculed as rationalization.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that President Clinton sought pastoral counseling
instead of psychotherapy for his problem shows how thoroughly
stigmatized is mental health treatment.
</P>
<P>
   One of the fastest-growing diagnoses is
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, for which drug
prescriptions from 1990 to 1995 nearly tripled, to one of every 30
U.S. children from 5 through 18. It was wonderful that some people
received badly needed help and dreadful that others received an
unneeded crutch. ``Hundreds and perhaps thousands'' of well-to-do
kids are converting questionable diagnoses into extra time for
taking college board tests, the Los Angeles Times reported this
month.
</P>
<P>
   When psychology is abused this way, it hurts kids who really
have ADHD by suggesting it's not really serious and by discouraging
effective treatment. The criminal justice system has done the same
thing to people with serious psychiatric disorders, so that we
execute people who couldn't grasp reality if it came with a handle,
while at the same time indulging the defense of violent stalking
because of ``Internet intoxication.''
</P>
<P>
   Mental illness isn't a weakness. Using its science for excuses
instead of improvement is a weakness.

   After my open-abdominal surgery for severe endometriosis 17
years ago, my gynecologist prescribed birth-control pills to be
taken continuously, without stopping for a menstrual period each
month, until I was ready to get pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   In some women, menstruation leads to endometriosis, a sometimes
painful disease in which fragments of the lining of the uterus can
be scattered throughout the pelvic area and even up to the lungs.
The fragments continue to grow wherever they land and can cause
pain, bleeding and infertility.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Monroe battled the debilitating agony of endometriosis
for more than 10 years. She knew not only the cramping pain, but
also the infertility and miscarriages that often result.
</P>
<P>
   Until about 1970, the treatment for severe endometriosis was to
remove the ovaries and put an end to the periodic stimulation of
endometrial tissue. Now, in most cases, we have far-less-formidable
treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Monroe underwent seven operations to remove hemorrhagic
endometrial tissue from her pelvic and abdominal organs, but she
refused a hysterectomy, most likely because she desperately wanted
to become a mother, says Dr. Elsimar Coutinho in his new book, ``Is
Menstruation Obsolete?''
</P>
<P>
   And doctors didn't know back then that menstruation could be
suppressed to prevent endometrial tissue from reappearing. Instead,
they gave Monroe greater and greater quantities of narcotics to
numb the pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course she was unhappy, but why was she unhappy? Ten days a
month she was absolutely out of it, suffering intolerable pain or
on high doses of narcotic pain relievers and hypnotics,'' Coutinho
said in a recent telephone conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you treat patients with endometriosis or have had
endometriosis yourself, you understand this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is probable that Marilyn Monroe's death, caused by an
overdose of prescribed narcotics, was accidental,'' Coutinho
contends. ``One cannot escape the conclusion that her endometriosis
was a determining factor in the drug dependency that made her
accidental death predictable.''
</P>
<P>
   Birth-control pills, now widely used to suppress menstruation in
the treatment of endometriosis, first appeared just two years
before Monroe's death in 1962, and the injectable progesterone
DepoProvera was discovered a year after she died.
</P>
<P>
   Coutinho pioneered the use of DepoProvera for the treatment of
endometriosis soon after it was introduced to prevent late-term
miscarriages.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not endometriosis that took the life of Marilyn Monroe,
but it certainly contributed substantially to her enormous mental
and physical suffering, leading to her dependence on painkilling
drugs, which ultimately killed her,'' he told me.
</P>
<P>
   I have been taking DepoProvera shots once every three months the
past 13 years for endometriosis.
</P>
<P>
   The hormone not only prevents pain, but also prevents periods
and premenstrual syndrome. When friends hear about the side
effects, they tell me how lucky I am to have endometriosis. If not
for that, I would not have been prescribed DepoProvera years before
it became widely used in this country.
</P>
<P>
   And after talking with Coutinho and thinking about Monroe and
her pain, I realize just how lucky I am.

 &HT;    Folk remedies accelerate immune system
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Despite recent advances in drugs for influenza,
treatment of colds and the flu is essentially a matter of
suppressing symptoms. Medical doctors and pharmacists recommend
using over-the-counter medications that target a person's specific
cough, congestion, aches and pains, runny nose or fever.
</P>
<P>
   Naturopathic and herbal practitioners approach colds and flu
from another direction, accelerating the immune system response
that causes the unpleasant symptoms. Their therapies tend to be
gentler, although herbal medicines also can have unwanted side
effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``The `wet socks treatment' is a great way to stimulate the
immune system and draw congestion away from the upper body,'' says
Dr. Judith Boice, a Portland, Ore., naturopath who grew up in
Centerville.
</P>
<P>
   The patient starts by soaking his feet in water as hot as he can
tolerate for five to 10 minutes. Then, after drying his feet, he
drenches a pair of cotton socks in cold tap water and wrings them
out so they are damp but not dripping. He then puts on the damp
cotton socks, covers them with dry woolen socks, gets into bed and
goes to sleep. Sometimes it takes more than one night, Boice says.
</P>
<P>
   People respond differently to specific folk remedies, but using
them quickly and aggressively ``will sometimes limit severity or
even abort a cold,'' says Dr. Mary L. Hardy, a Los Angeles
internist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and member of the American
Botanical Society and the American Holistic Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   Scientific research has shown that hot chicken soup, for
example, ``not only helps break up nasal congestion but also
contains garlic, which has antibiotic properties,'' Hardy says.
</P>
<P>
   Goldenseal, ginger and thyme also have some antibiotic value,
she says, while lemon balm and licorice are somewhat antiviral.
There is evidence that echinacea and goldenseal boost the immune
system both preventively and after symptoms appear. And few can
dispute the ability of pepper, ginger and horseradish to help clear
sinuses.
</P>
<P>
   Boice suggests going a day without solid food. That not only
diverts the body's energy from digestion to fighting infection, but
also encourages drinking more fluids. Drinking water is an
effective decongestant and also keeps the mucous membranes moist,
better able to ward off germs.
</P>
<P>
   A salt water gargle, with two teaspoons per glass, ``is
excellent for soothing a sore throat and also kills bacteria and
viruses,'' Boice says.
</P>
<P>
   One area where medical and naturopathic doctors agree is that
nothing beats rest for putting respiratory illnesses behind us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us try to push and push and push,'' Boice says. ``You
should rest until the fever's broken, and then for another 24
hours. If you get up before then, you'll probably be sick again
within six weeks.''

 &HT;    NFC NOTEBOOK: Rams ready to bring Georgia to Georgia
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ The Rams' travel plans are complete. The NFC
champions' charter will depart at 2:30 p.m. today and is scheduled
to land at Hartsfield International shortly around 4 p.m. The top
name in their travel party will be there, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said a long time ago we wanted to take Georgia to
Georgia,'' coach Dick Vermeil said, smiling at Rams owner Georgia
Frontiere after Sunday's 11-6 victory against Tampa Bay put the
Rams back in the Super Bowl for the first time in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   This Sunday night in the Georgia Dome, Georgia's Rams will
reunite with Tennessee. The AFC champion Titans beat St. Louis
24-21 Oct. 31 in Nashville, the Rams' lowest point total this
season until Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a little revenge factor to this whole deal,'' Rams
cornerback Todd Lyght said. ``I remember leaving Tennessee with a
sick feeling in my stomach.''
</P>
<P>
   Ugly ending
</P>
<P>
   The game was as contentious as it was close and physical. It got
ugly near game's end; after Shaun King's last pass was batted away,
Rams strong safety Billy Jenkins nearly got into a fight with Trent
Dilfer, the Bucs' starting quarterback at the beginning of the year
but on the sidelines in street clothes after breaking his clavicle
two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of feeling going through the whole game,''
said Jenkins. ``Obviously, they were mad. I was just waving 'Bye'
to him (Dilfer). He came out there and butted into his teammates'
business. It got a little out of hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins said Dilfer came out on the field because Bucs right
guard Frank Middleton had been yelling at the Rams all game,
calling them ``cheap-shot artists, going for knees.''
</P>
<P>
   First things first
</P>
<P>
   For the second consecutive week, St. Louis set the tone on its
first play from scrimmage. This time, though, it nearly
foreshadowed disaster.
</P>
<P>
   When Kurt Warner dropped back and tried to hit Marshall Faulk on
a screen pass, Bucs right defensive end Steve White jumped,
deflected the ball with his right hand, then intercepted at the
Rams 20. That led to Martin Gramatica's first field goal and was in
stark contrast to last week's divisional playoff win. That day,
Warner hit Isaac Bruce for a 77-yard touchdown on the Rams' first
play.
</P>
<P>
   Warner, who threw just 13 regular-season interceptions, threw
three against Tampa Bay, his only three-interception game all
season.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly kicking himself
</P>
<P>
   Vermeil's decision to go with kicker Jeff Wilkins nearly
backfired. With Wilkins suffering from patella tendinitis in his
nonkicking knee, Vermeil brought in three kickers to audition
Tuesday and nearly went with retiree Nick Lowery, 43, who'd last
kicked in 1996. Vermeil was satisfied Wilkins could kick after
practicing Thursday. Wilkins did kick a 24-yard field goal in the
first quarter, but he missed a 44-yarder in the second and would
have faced a 47-yarder had Ricky Proehl not caught the winning
30-yard TD pass.Last things first
</P>
<P>
   How rare was the Rams' five-point first half? The last time they
hadn't scored a touchdown at home in the first half was Nov. 29,
1998, in a 21-10 loss to the Falcons. That was 11 home games ago.
</P>
<P>
   The last time this season St. Louis hadn't scored a first-half
touchdown? Game 7, at Tennessee. The last time a conference
championship game was this low-scoring? When these teams met in the
1979 NFC title game, the Rams getting three Frank Corral field
goals to win 9-0.Georgian on my mind
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Clemons, the Rams' backup linebacker from Griffin, Ga.,
who played for the University of Georgia in 1992-93, had a big sack
in the divisional playoff win and an even bigger one Sunday. With
Tampa Bay facing a third-and-3 at the Rams 26 late in the second
quarter, Clemons sacked King and forced a fumble. Tampa Bay
recovered but lost 12 yards, was taken out of field goal range and
had to punt.
</P>
<P>
   Ouch
</P>
<P>
   Rookie wide receiver Torry Holt bruised his ribs while falling
on the ball after catching a quick hitch pattern late in the first
quarter and being tackled by Donnie Abraham. The X-rays were
negative and Holt returned for the Rams' first possession of the
second half.

THAI SECURITY FORCES STORM HOSPITAL, FREE HUNDREDS OF HOSTAGES
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand _ Thai Security forces stormed a hospital
early on Tuesday, ending a 22-hour standoff in which a small group
of guerrillas from neighboring Myanmar, led by 12-year-old twin
boys, took some 800 patients and staff members hostage.
</P>
<P>
   A regional military commander said his men had freed all the
hostages in the border town of Ratchaburi and killed nine rebels.
He said several other gunmen were still being pursued. It was not
immediately known whether the twins had taken part in the raid.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the hostages are safe,'' said the commander, Lt. Gen.
Thaweep Suwannasingha. Earlier, he said about 450 hostages remained
in the hospital after hundreds fled during the night.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday morning, the black-masked gunmen, from a splinter
group of ethnic Karen rebels that calls itself God's Army, had
burst in to the hospital compound, 75 miles west of here, riding a
hijacked blue public bus and firing automatic rifles into the air.
</P>
<P>
   The group's chain-smoking twin leaders, Johnny and Luther Htoo,
are fundamentalist Christians who claim to have mystical powers
that make them immune to bullets and land mines.
</P>
<P>
   The gunmen said they did not intend to hurt anyone, but the
strangeness of the group and its leaders added an element of
unpredictability to the standoff.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kuwat Suntrajarn, an official at the Ministry of Public
Health, said 200 staff members and 600 patients were inside the
750-bed hospital when the siege began at about 7 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   No injuries were reported, and the hospital staff was apparently
able to continue treating some patients. But perhaps 40 people were
released during the day _ some on stretchers, one on a
post-operative gurney, one in labor _ suggesting that their care in
the hospital was not adequate.
</P>
<P>
   A number of hostages managed to flee, despite reports that the
rebels had attached a bomb to the main gate and placed mines around
the perimeter. One of the escapees said the hostages were unfed and
hungry.
</P>
<P>
   Thai officials said the gunmen, wearing military fatigues,
demanded that Thailand stop shelling their hilltop base inside
Myanmar, that it provide medical care to wounded rebels, and that
it give sanctuary to their ``army,'' which has no more than 200
fighters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very tense,'' a nurse inside the hospital said, speaking
by mobile telephone to Thai television. ``Most of the attackers are
in general and emergency wards. We have the patients lying down on
the floor so they can't be seen, and we have locked the door. I saw
them walk by. They tried to come in but couldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Another hospital employee, trapped in her car in the compound,
called a television station to say: ``I'm here with my husband. If
we get out of the car, they'll see us. They fired so many shots
before the police got here.''
</P>
<P>
   God's Army is one of dozens of ethnic insurgent bands that have
been fighting the central government in Myanmar, the former Burma,
for half a century. In recent years most of the main fighting
groups have reached cease-fire or peace agreements with the
Myanmar's military government, but the Karen have continued to
fight.
</P>
<P>
   According to legend, the Htoo twins rallied their village in
1997 to avenge a government offensive in which _ as in many similar
reported incidents _ the soldiers raped women, killed men in front
of their families and set fire to thatched homes.
</P>
<P>
   It was at that time that God's Army was formed, breaking off
from the main Karen guerrilla force, the Karen National Union.
Burmese military attacks on that group have driven tens of
thousands of civilians into border encampments just inside
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   The boys appear to have instilled a special fanaticism among
their followers, setting a severe regimen in which liquor, drugs,
fighting and swearing are banned. ``I have never cried,'' Luther
Htoo told the Associated Press in an interview last month. ``Why
would a man cry?'' The twins chain-smoked throughout the interview.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the Htoo brothers command guerrillas who are
older than they are. But it remained unclear how the boys exercised
their leadership.
</P>
<P>
   In the last week, the God's Army fighters have come under
intense attack from the army of Myanmar, and Thai troops have
shelled them from across the border to prevent them from fleeing
into Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   Shown on local television before the storming of the hospital,
one masked gunman who called himself Nui said: ``Do not be worried.
We will not hurt any hostages. We want to tell the world how Karen
and Burmese refugees live during the fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``We will go back when our demands are met, when we
reach an agreement. We still don't have any definite plan on how to
return.'' He added: ``We didn't harm anyone. We have released many
hostages.''
</P>
<P>
   The attack was an embarrassment for Thailand, which took a soft
approach to previous Karen hostage-takers who occupied the Myanmar
Embassy in Bangkok for 25 hours in October and then were given safe
passage by helicopter back to the border.
</P>
<P>
   The five embassy hostage-takers, calling themselves the Vigorous
Burmese Student Warriors, then took refuge with the God's Army
fighters. One news report said some of them took part in the
hospital takeover on Tuesday, but that could not be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions between the two countries rose after the embassy siege,
as the authorities in Myanmar closed the border for two months and
strengthened their military presence on the border.
</P>
<P>
   A government spokesman in Myanmar issued a statement on Monday
saying: ``It is about time these armed men are treated as
terrorists by the international community. Myanmar is committed to
the elimination of armed terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   Thai officials vowed to be tougher this time, calling the
takeover of a hospital ``international terrorism.''

 &HT;    Ohio launches anti-gang effort
 &HT;    By Michael C. Bender
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ The first meeting of a statewide anti-gang
committee met Monday and announced 22 more meetings will be held
from February through May.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio Against Gangs, a statewide gang prevention and suppression
committee, has $314,000, including $235,000 from a federal grant,
for its program, Ohio Attorney General Betty Montgomery said. The
money will be used for salaries and summits planned over the next
four months, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to build a wall around violence, one brick at a
time,'' Montgomery said.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton and Urbana are two of the 22 cities chosen for meetings.
Montgomery said the meetings will ``alert communities that have
failed to see problems that are gang related and help them come up
with local solutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since gangs are a local problem, the best solutions will also
be local,'' Montgomery said.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton does not have a significant gang problem but the police
department is investigating allegations of gang activity in the
city, police Lt. David Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Montgomery, Ohio has the nation's fourth highest
gang population after California, Illinois and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gangs are a part of a national epidemic of violence,''
Montgomery said. She then listed several violent video games
including ``Kingpin: Life of Crime,'' which, she said, specifically
glorifies gang violence.
</P>
<P>
   One of the main problems with investigating gangs is the thin
line that separates common sense and fear, Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really easy to get so into the process (of identifying
gangs) that you think everybody wearing a certain hat or shoe is in
a gang,'' the lieutenant said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said that Ohio law makes a witch hunt almost
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   The Ohio Revised Code defines a gang as a group of at least
three people with a common name or common signs or symbols who have
engaged in a pattern of criminal activity.

AS RENO RISES, ITS ONCE-GRAND CASINO HOTEL IS MARKED FOR
DESTRUCTION

<P>
   RENO, Nev. _ The second floor of the Mapes Hotel had been
gutted. Mayor Jeff Griffin stood ankle deep in the wreckage of what
had been a suite, bits of red-velvet-wallpapered walls all around
him, and glanced out a gaping window.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see from here where Reno is going,'' he said,
gesturing toward a construction site for the expanding Holiday
Hotel. ``We have big plans for this place, and whatever will be on
the Mapes property will be part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Once, anchored by the Mapes, the first resort-casino hotel in
the nation, Reno had contended with Las Vegas as the premier
gambling arena in the country. Then Atlantic City went neon, Vegas
exploded into a gambling Disney World and casinos opened on
seemingly every road and riverboat west of the Mississippi. Reno,
with its quaint neon arch proclaiming itself the ``biggest little
city in the world'' began to look very small indeed. Casinos began
closing and the city found itself way down on the list of places
vacationers ventured to lose their money.
</P>
<P>
   Now, signs point to a resurrection. A 12-theater cinema opened
in the fall. So did a promenade and park along the Truckee River.
Artists' lofts are in the works. New galleries and antique stores
dot the downtown. The convention center is doing brisk business. A
summer arts festival on the river draws huge crowds. Casinos that
closed over the last five years, like the Holiday, are reopening,
bigger than before, and those that rode out the rough times, like
Harrah's, are expanding.
</P>
<P>
   But then there is the Mapes.
</P>
<P>
   For many here _ 57 percent of all residents, according to a
recent poll commissioned by preservationists _ it is hard to cheer
for a future Reno without the 12-story Mapes Hotel. Built in 1947
by Charles Mapes with 1920s Art Deco architectural plans, it was
the first hotel in the country designed to provide rooms, a casino
and live entertainment under one roof. Its Sky Room, a glass-walled
promenade on the top floor with vast views of the Sierra Nevada,
was the place to go in the 1950s, when Reno was a destination for
people from all over the country. The Marx Brothers, Tony Bennett,
Marilyn Monroe and the Rat Pack all played the Sky Room, with Sammy
Davis Jr. making his debut there. Later, locals clamored to book
the room for proms and weddings.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel, which closed in 1982 after years of decline, became a
national landmark in 1984, and in 1998 it was placed on the
National Trust for Historic Preservation's list of the 11 most
endangered historic sites in the country.
</P>
<P>
   For years, as prospective developers came and went, pigeons
roosted on the top floors and the building, hard by the river,
stood dark and forbidding, the tallest, saddest building on Reno's
main street.
</P>
<P>
   It is to be imploded on Jan. 30, Super Bowl Sunday, and when it
falls, Reno will become the first city in the country to fail to
preserve a site since the National Trust began issuing its list of
endangered sites 11 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Yet while preservationists have dropped a federal lawsuit to
stop the demolition, the National Trust insists that the hotel can
still be saved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are continuing to pursue any and all options to stop what
we consider to be a needless demolition of a truly historic
American landmark by the city of Reno,'' said Gary Kozel, a
spokesman for the National Trust. ``We've proven that the majority
of the citizens of Reno wanted it saved, and that a reputable
developer stands ready to save it.''
</P>
<P>
   The fate of the Mapes has dominated the news in northern Nevada
for months, and continues to do so. Over the weekend, the National
Trust began a campaign to have residents flood City Hall with
telephone calls insisting that the Mapes be spared.
</P>
<P>
   But the larger issue raised by the fight is at what price should
a city save a historic building? Reno officials say that after 17
years of developers coming in with grand plans, then backing out,
enough is enough.
</P>
<P>
   Officials, who voted to demolish the building in September,
after rejecting as unworkable six proposals to rehabilitate the
hotel, also say they are frustrated that the story of Reno's
redevelopment has been lost in the flap over a 52-year-old hotel
that had 7-foot ceilings, rooms barely big enough for a double bed,
and so much patched-together terra cotta construction that it would
cost at least $25 million to bring the building up to code.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the National Trust to call the Mapes the most historic
building in Nevada is disingenuous, I think,'' Griffin said. ``This
is not a grand building. It was the first hotel with a casino in
the country, it was the tallest building you could find in the
entire state for 10 years, and it had a magnificent Sky Room. It
was a big deal. Then it started to go into decline.''
</P>
<P>
   The city bought the hotel for $4.5 million in 1996, he said, in
the hopes of finding a white knight to rescue it from certain
destruction. It will have spent $6 million on the building after
the demolition.
</P>
<P>
   A $23 million proposal by an Oakland developer, Nationwide
Capital Services, to turn the building into housing for the elderly
was rejected by the city as inappropriate for the site, the mayor
said. The developer, Karl Diaz-Hoffmann, said the city had not
appeared interested in saving the building. Others have wondered
whether the city had a deal lined up with one of the casino owners
to buy the property.
</P>
<P>
   But the mayor said Diaz-Hoffmann's plan simply did not work. ``A
senior citizens building does not fit in there, in the prime corner
at the beginning of the city's casino area,'' Griffin said. ``Not
to mention that whatever stands here will not be 12 stories tall.
The building is too high.''
</P>
<P>
   Preservationists say the plans would have fit quite nicely and
defend the building's historic value.
</P>
<P>
   ``That building was put on the national register because it was
so significant that it didn't even have to wait 50 years to become
a landmark,'' said Toni Mollett Harsh, president of the Truckee
Meadows Heritage Trust.
</P>
<P>
   But Mike Reed, dean of the business school at the University of
Nevada in Reno, said that many Reno citizens had become weary of
the Mapes and the on-again, off-again plans to save it. With Reno
on an upswing, new residents and new businesses moving in, and many
residents familiar with the Mapes only as the old boarded-up
building too tall for its neighbors, the nostalgia for the hotel is
not as great as the die-hard fans think, Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when the contractor hired to demolish the building announced
that he would sell the building's bricks for $1 each on Super Bowl
Sunday, potential customers began going to the construction site to
reserve their souvenirs.

   PLYMOUTH, N.H. _ Going right to the heart of Gov. George W.
Bush's biggest potential vulnerability, Sen. John McCain portrayed
himself Monday as the only candidate who ``understands the world''
and who is ``fully prepared to be president.''
</P>
<P>
   In comments on the stump and in a new 30-second television
commercial, McCain touted his military and government experience as
providing the necessary preparation for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only one man running for president who knows the
military and understands the world _ John McCain,'' the new ad
says. ``If America is to lead, then America's leader must be
prepared for that challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain denied to reporters that he was suggesting that Bush was
not ready to be president, and he joked that ``I'm always put in
the terrible position where I'm defending Governor Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet no matter how much McCain tried to slide away from it, the
new commercial and other statements he made Monday suggest an
aggressive move against the Texas governor on what many critics
consider his greatest weakness, foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Several times Monday McCain repeated that the nation needed ``a
steady hand on the tiller.''
</P>
<P>
   In a way, the day brought McCain's campaign full circle, away
from the recent fights with Bush over tax cuts and back to
character and personal biography, which is how McCain, a one-time
prisoner-of-war in North Vietnam, began his run for president.
</P>
<P>
   McCain long ago made a decision not to compete in Iowa and to
concentrate instead on winning the Republican primary in New
Hampshire, a state with a history of falling for underdogs and
mavericks. So as the other candidates made their final Iowa
appeals, he alone traversed New Hampshire's snowy byways, Monday
drawing dozens of television cameras along the way.
</P>
<P>
   All through the grueling day, his campaign used visual touches
to remind voters of McCain's devotion to New Hampshire. The Arizona
senator's midday stop here in a chilly, cavernous room at the
Plymouth Armory was his 100th New Hampshire town hall meeting. And
he celebrated by cutting a big white cake with an icing silhouette
of the state on it as loudspeakers blared ``Johnny B. Goode.''
</P>
<P>
   As McCain walked into the hall he was greeted by blaring music
and the booming bass-voiced tones of an announcer, touches that are
usually staples of general election campaign rallies and that have
been missing from McCain's lower-key chat sessions with voters.
</P>
<P>
   It was in front of students at Moultonborough Academy on Monday
morning, after he was grilled on issues like family planning,
abortion, the Confederate flag and China, that McCain gave his most
full-throated appeal to voters to make their choice less on issues
than on a candidate's experience and character.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe I am better prepared than any of the other
candidates,'' he told the high school students. ``I will stack my
experience, my position on issues, everything I've done, against
those other candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``What really matters is your impression of what we
talked about here today _ not about specific issues such as Planned
Parenthood or China _ but how you leave this room and say `gee, I
believe I can place my confidence in that old geezer to lead this
country.'''
</P>
<P>
   Across the day McCain also hewed to his signature theme of
campaign finance overhaul. When a man asked whether he supported
term limits, he objected, ``My problem is that we throw out the
good people as well as the bad.'' But he said that overhauling the
campaign finance system would have an effect similar to term limits
by ending the ``the incumbency protection racket.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get the government out of the hands of the big
money special interests that keep all these people in office and
give the government back to you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The senator often says that one of his greatest hopes is to
inspire young people and combat the cynicism that has left fewer
and fewer of them voting. But his town hall meetings usually draw
high proportions of the elderly, who are attracted to his military
themes and pledges to help veterans.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Monday morning at Moultonborough Academy, McCain seemed
uncomfortable at times, particularly when the first three questions
were about abortion.
</P>
<P>
   His very first question, from a young man, was whether he would
reinstate the Reagan era rule that prevented international family
planning clinics that receive federal funds from discussing
abortion. ``I don't believe they should advocate abortion with my
tax dollars,'' McCain said, adding that he opposed abortion except
in cases of rape and incest. Then a young woman asked how he would
determine whether someone had in fact been raped.
</P>
<P>
   Wrapping his arms tightly around his chest, McCain said, ``I
think that I would give the benefit of the doubt to the person who
alleges that.'' In answer to another student, he said he did not
think women would lie about being raped in order to be eligible for
an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Another student, Tom Webster, wanted to know whether McCain
cared more about victory in South Carolina than for the people who
were offended by the Confederate flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I do not,'' McCain answered.
</P>
<P>
   The 17-year-old asked, ``You think the flag should be taken
down?''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said, ``I think that's up to the people of South
Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
   And the senator repeated his answer as the teen-ager twice
persisted in asking, ``But is it right or wrong?''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Webster said, ``I thought he was dodging the issue. I
thought it was kind of cowardly.'' He said that if he were old
enough to vote he would pick Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the time, McCain, who is repeatedly introduced as a
hero, has been drawing unsolicited tributes from his audiences as
people implicitly contrast him with President Clinton. ``I don't
have a question,'' one woman told McCain, standing to speak at the
Plymouth Armory. ``I just want to thank you for your integrity.
It's extremely important to me that the next president of the
United States tell me the truth no matter what.''

TWO CANDIDATES FOR HEAD OF HEALTH INSTITUTES EMERGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  (lb) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two brain scientists have emerged as the leading
candidates to be director of the National Institutes of Health at a
time when Congress is pouring money into the agency in hopes of
unlocking the secrets of many diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said Monday that Donna Shalala, the
secretary of health and human services, had identified the two
neuroscientists as her candidates to lead the agency, the chief
sponsor of biomedical research in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The contenders are Dr. Gerald D. Fischbach, director of the
National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, and Dr.
Steven E. Hyman, director of the National Institute of Mental
Health. Both have taught at Harvard Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   Fischbach and Hyman were appointed to their current jobs by Dr.
Harold E. Varmus, who stepped down last month as director of the
National Institutes of Health to become president of Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton will select a nominee and send the name to the
Senate for confirmation. Ordinarily, a president in the last year
of his term would have little hope of getting the Senate to approve
a nominee for so important a job. But administration officials said
they had consulted Congress and found that lawmakers wanted to have
a strong manager in charge of the agency as its budget grows by
nearly 15 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has begun a five-year effort to double the budget of
the National Institutes of Health. The budget was increased by $2
billion last year, and by another $2 billion this year, to $17.8
billion. Clinton will propose a further increase of $1 billion when
he sends Congress his 2001 budget request next month, the White
House said.
</P>
<P>
   Congress may again provide more than Clinton requests, as it has
in each of the last few years. But some lawmakers said they would
insist on a detailed explanation of how the agency was spending the
extra money it has received.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers told Shalala that the nominee must have impeccable
scientific credentials and no strong identification with either
political party. Administration officials said that Shalala's
candidates met those requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Fischbach, 61, was chairman of the neurobiology departments at
Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital before he
became director of the neurological institute here in July 1998.
</P>
<P>
   A former president of the Society for Neuroscience, he has
studied synapses, the connections between brain cells or between
neurons and muscle. He devised methods to study outside the body
the link between nerves and muscles, and he identified a protein
that is secreted by nerve cells and induces the formation of
synapses.
</P>
<P>
   Hyman, 47, played a large role in the White House Conference on
Mental Health last June and in the landmark report on mental health
issued last month by the surgeon general of the United States. He
is an expert on the molecular biology of psychiatric disorders.
</P>
<P>
   Before taking his current job in April 1996, Hyman studied the
way in which drugs like cocaine and morphine cause long-term
changes in brain circuits. He searches for genes that may, with
environmental factors, make people vulnerable to mental disorders
like schizophrenia and manic-depressive illness.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth L. Kirschstein, who has worked at the NIH in various
positions for over 40 years, has been acting director since Jan. 1.

 &HT;    Bush vows to bring 'honor, dignity' back to White HouseBy Ken
Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PERRY, Iowa _ On the day that a Bush was on a presidential
ballot for the first time since the nation ousted one in 1992, Gov.
George W. Bush on Monday continued to score stump-speech points by
zinging the man who beat his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the beginning of the end of the Clinton era in
Washington, D.C.,'' he said Monday, drawing loud applause with the
line in Ames and Perry as he made a final campaign swing en route
to a season-opening win in the Iowa caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   The applause swelled again with the Clinton-related punchline
that has punctuated the Bush stump speech for months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should I be the person that America chooses to become the
president, when I put my hand on the Bible, I will swear to not
only uphold the laws of the land, I will swear to uphold the honor
and dignity of the office to which I have been elected,'' Bush
said. ``So help me God.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Texas governor, the Iowa victory marked a big day that
can be linked directly to one of the worst days in his life: Nov.
3, 1992, when Bill Clinton made the elder George Bush a one-termer.
</P>
<P>
   If the elder Bush had won re-election, there is little chance
his son would now be the odds-on favorite to win the GOP
nomination. But on Monday, the younger Bush refused to buy into the
theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I think my victory in '94 against Governor (Ann)
Richards was the first step toward being here. I really don't dwell
on my dad's defeat. I think what started me in my political march
was winning the governorship in '94 and doing in office what I said
I would do, and winning re-election,'' said Bush, always wary of
anything that might make his candidacy look like family revenge.
``So I don't quite see the connection. Nice try.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's last day in Iowa began early with the morning sun on his
face as he headed into a Des Moines restaurant to chat with the
breakfast crowd and give the TV cameras something to show all day.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Bush headed to a rally at Iowa State University _
site of the August straw poll that gave Bush a big, early win and
sent several candidates spiralling toward oblivion. Two of those _
former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander and former American Red Cross
President Elizabeth Dole _ are now Bush backers.
</P>
<P>
   The Ames rally marked a campaign crossroads in Iowa, a common
occurrence in a state overrun with candidates, with Democrat Bill
Bradley speaking at another rally in the same building.
</P>
<P>
   After Ames, Bush headed to Perry where students and locals
packed a high school gym in which the Bush signs were on the walls
next to banners marking the school's 1930 girls state basketball
title and 1936 state football championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm convinced he is going to return dignity and honor to the
White House,'' Iowa Sen. Charles Grassley, who traveled with Bush
for several days, told the Perry crowd.
</P>
<P>
   From Perry, Bush, who also did several local radio interviews
during the day, headed back to Des Moines where the schedule called
for him to nap and exercise before showing up to declare victory at
a rally.
</P>
<P>
   After acknowledging cheering backers at the Des Moines Marriott,
Bush headed to the airport for a flight to New Hampshire where he
will campaign toward the crucial Feb. 1 primary.
</P>
<P>
   That effort began with an airport rally planned for 2:30 a.m. at
the airport in Manchester.
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, it was a solid day that began with him noting that
among his biggest hurdles has been high expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been great expectations surrounding me ever since I got
started, so I'm used to it,'' he said. ``But this is a long
process. Tonight is a very important night in the process. It's the
beginning of the nominating process and I feel great.''

NEW DISNEY NO. 2 KNOWN FOR COOLNESS UNDER PRESSURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (With DISNEY-APPOINT) 
(mk) 
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What put Robert Iger on a hyperfast track as an executive at ABC
in the late 1980s was his coolness under a heat wave in very
unexpected circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the Olympics in Calgary,'' said Daniel Burke, the
president of Capital Cities-ABC, as that company was known before
its acquisition by Walt Disney Co. ``We knew going in that we were
going to lose a lot of money. And then one day, of all things, it
was warmer in Calgary than it was in Miami. The bobsled and luge
runs were starting to melt. We watched Bob in the middle of that,
reorganizing our plans for the broadcast that night. He was totally
cool and collected.''
</P>
<P>
   Within a year Iger, a sports programming executive, became an
assistant to the then-president of ABC, John Sias. A year later he
was running ABC Entertainment division, though he had never been to
a Hollywood party in his life.
</P>
<P>
   According to current and former associates and co-workers,
Iger's unflappable exterior covers a hard-driving, exceedingly
high-energy executive, known throughout ABC and Disney for working
from before dawn until late at night, for mastering details of
business with creative flair, and for amassing and synthesizing
prodigious amounts of often complicated information.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Eisner, the Disney chairman who appointed Iger president
of Disney _ and effectively his second-in-command _ on Monday, said
Iger's broad resume from working in sports, entertainment and cable
at ABC and in the international division of Disney made the
appointment all but inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really the easiest, most obvious thing I've done in a
while,'' Eisner said. Indeed, he added, he first broached the idea
of bringing Iger in as president two years ago. ``But we had just
completed a $19 billion acquisition of ABC. I'm a believer in
keeping your eye on the ball. I couldn't move Bob until ABC was in
a strong position.''
</P>
<P>
   After a period when that goal seemed to be elusive for both
Eisner and Iger, ABC has become, in the last several months, one of
the most impressive turnaround stories in the media world, with the
company on track to improve profits dramatically, thanks in
considerable part to the amazing impact of one hit, the game show
``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   One senior ABC executive said that series alone could contribute
an additional $250 million to ABC in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   Iger praised the executive team now in place at ABC, most of
whom have close ties to him. None goes back as far as Pat
Fili-Krushel, however, the president of ABC, who first shared a
work space with Iger 25 years ago. `'I was a secretary and he was a
production supervisor at ABC Sports,'' she said. ``We shared the
Xerox machine.''
</P>
<P>
   Iger's road through sports production toward corporate
leadership was marked by what Ms. Fili-Krushel called an unusual
ability to ``manage up and down with equal skill.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, among the occasional criticisms that have attached
themselves to Iger during his rise, is one that centers on his
ability to ``be the best at managing upward that anybody has ever
seen,'' as one senior executive who has worked with him put it.
This executive said that ``presentational style'' has always been
among Iger's strengths. ``He is flawless at that.''
</P>
<P>
   But the executive added that it occasionally hurt Iger with
people who questioned ``how good a good-looking executive can
really be.''
</P>
<P>
   Burke said of Iger, ``People enjoyed propelling him forward and
watching how successful he was.''
</P>
<P>
   Iger was one of the earliest executives in the traditional
television business to anticipate the coming intersection with the
wired world, and he remains, as one colleague put it, ``the
earliest adapter of every gadget technology can produce.''
</P>
<P>
   Eisner emphasized how important that knowledge will be in Iger's
new role at Disney, saying that finding the way for Disney to
maximize the value of its entertainment content in a digital world
is ``the single biggest issue on Bob's agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Iger said he looked forward to the challenge. ``I get excited by
a lot of the details of what has to be done.'' He said that finding
``value for Disney's great content'' will be his prime priority.
</P>
<P>
   First he will deal with the details of his personal life. Iger
currently lives a dual-coast, multi-network existence. His wife is
Willow Bay, the anchor of the daily ``Moneyline'' program on the
Cable News Network.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, is a unit of Time Warner, which, if the
recently announced merger goes through, will be a unit of AOL-Time
Warner. Eisner said of the AOL chairman, `'Steve Case will just
have to find a way to move Willow's show to L.A.''
</P>
<P>
   Will his wife move with him? All Iger would say was, ``I'm
certainly going to live full time with my wife.''

PAKISTAN BACKED HIJACKERS OF INDIAN JET, U.S. CONTENDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States now believes that a terrorist
group supported by the Pakistani military was responsible for the
hijacking of an Indian Airlines jet last month, a judgment that
puts Pakistan at risk of being placed on Washington's list of
nations that support terrorism, Clinton administration officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   The new military leader of Pakistan, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, was
asked in a meeting with three administration officials in Islamabad
last week to ban the group, Harkat ul-Mujahedeen, but the request
was rebuffed, senior officials here said.
</P>
<P>
   Musharraf was also asked to exert pressure on the Taliban
government in Afghanistan, with which Pakistan has friendly
relations, to expel Osama bin Ladin, who was implicated in the
bombings of two U.S. Embassies in Africa, but no progress was made
with this request either, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The conclusion that a terrorist group supported by Pakistan
carried out the hijacking comes as the White House must make a
decision in coming weeks about whether President Clinton should
visit Pakistan as part of his planned trip to India and Bangladesh
at the end of March.
</P>
<P>
   The visit to India is expected to be announced this week, with
the option of a stopover in Pakistan still open, pending some
gestures of cooperation by Pakistan, officials said. Rejecting a
presidential visit to Pakistan during a trip that includes a visit
to India would be one of the severest snubs the White House could
make, especially during the first presidential trip to the region
in 21 years.
</P>
<P>
   Information that Harkat ul-Mujahedeen was responsible for the
hijacking came in the aftermath of the seizure of the jet, when it
became clearer who made arrangements for the escape of the
hijackers, administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Harkat ul-Mujahedeen is the new name for Harkat ul-Ansar, a
radical Kashmiri nationalist group that was put on the State
Department's list of terrorist groups in 1997, officials said. The
group changed its name after being added to the list.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials declined to give details of precisely
what they knew about the group's role in the hijacking that ended
with 155 hostages being freed in exchange for the release from
prison of three members of Harkat ul-Mujahedeen by the Indian
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indications came through intelligence channels, and I don't
know anybody around here, including the skeptics, who don't find
that credible,'' an official said of Harkat ul-Mujahedeen's
involvement in the hijacking.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Karl Inderfurth, the assistant secretary of state for South
Asian affairs, one of the three officials who met with Musharraf,
told the general that the United States was concerned about the
links between Harkat ul-Mujahedeen and his military and
intelligence services, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The general was told that the United States believed that Harkat
ul-Mujahedeen ``was responsible for the hijacking and that the
United States believed the group operated openly and
clandestinely'' with the support of the military and intelligence
services in Pakistan, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Musharraf said he would consider the
administration's request to shut down the group, but he left the
impression that no action would be taken soon, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The question of Pakistan's role in the hijacking has already
inflamed relations between India and Pakistan, which both possess
nuclear bombs. Shortly after the hijacking, India accused Pakistan
of masterminding the plot and said it had evidence to back up its
claims. But the Indian government has not yet produced the
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between the two countries have plummeted to their
lowest point in decades. Overlaying the heightened tensions are the
activities of the terrorist groups in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   How to deal with Pakistan since a coup on Oct. 12 ousted a
civilian government has been the subject of a debate within the
administration.
</P>
<P>
   After the hijacking, the Indian government urged the Clinton
administration to put Pakistan on the State Department's list of
countries that sponsor terrorism. Among the nations currently on
the list are Iran, Iraq and Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Such a designation would effectively end all loans to Pakistan
from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, which some
in the administration have argued would push already impoverished
Pakistan into near collapse.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Even though Pakistan is believed by the Clinton administration
to be harboring and supporting terrorist groups, there was
substantial resistance from the Pentagon and the CIA to putting
Pakistan on the list, in part because of help that Pakistan gave
the United States during the Soviet Union's occupation of
Afghanistan, administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   One way that Harkat ul-Mujahedeen and another group,
Lashkar-I-Toiba, were used by the Pakistani military, officials
said, was to have them cross over to the Indian side of the
so-called Line of Control in Kashmir, which divides the areas held
by India and Pakistan, while, at the same time, having the
Pakistani army create a disturbance at another point along the
line, thus diverting the Indian army from the infiltration.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The United States has known about the Harkat ul-Mujahedeen since
it claimed responsibility for kidnapping five Western tourists,
including one American, in Kashmir in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The visit to Islamabad by Inderfurth, Michael Sheehan, the State
Department's coordinator for counterterrorism, and Donald Camp, the
director for South Asian affairs at the National Security Council,
was intended to lay out the administration's concerns about
Pakistan on terrorism, the restoration of democracy and nuclear
nonproliferation, Inderfurth said.
</P>
<P>
   Inderfurth went out of his way to say that he had not ``warned''
the Pakistanis about what kind of punishment would come if the
military government did not heed the administration's concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, he appeared to hold out the possibility of a March
stopover by Clinton if the Pakistani government decided to take
some steps against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have said we cannot do business as usual with a military
government in Pakistan,'' Inderfurth said. ``Yet to influence
Pakistan on democracy, terrorism and nonproliferation we have to
engage them. Our president is our best engager.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Last month, Clinton suggested that he wanted to personally try
to solve the Kashmir conflict, which is the prime source of tension
between India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   And in another gesture to the Pakistani government, Inderfurth
refuted its contention that the United States had ``tilted''
towards India. ``Both countries are important for the United States
in their own right,'' he said. ``We are not going to choose one
over the other. In our view 'tilt' is a four-letter word that
should be banned in any discussion of the south continent.''

FIRM WORDS FROM ALBRIGHT ABOUT HELMS AND THE U.N. 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Secretary of State Madeleine Albright felt
compelled to remind the Security Council Monday who is in charge of
foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Her statement followed criticisms of the United Nations by Sen.
Jesse Helms, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, in
a speech to the Security Council last Thursday, coupled with a
warning that Americans would cast the organization off if it failed
to meet their demands. After four days of silence from the Clinton
administration, Albright set the record straight.
</P>
<P>
   Only the president of the United States can speak for the
American people, she said in impromptu remarks before making a
speech on the topic of the day, the war in Congo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, on behalf of the president, let me say that the Clinton
administration _ and I believe that most Americans _ see our role
in the world and our relationship to this organization quite
differently than does Senator Helms,'' said Albright, who was
presiding over the special Security Council session. The United
States holds the rotating council presidency for January.
</P>
<P>
   ``We strongly support the United Nations charter and the
organization's purpose,'' she said. ``We respect its rules, which
we helped to write. We want to strengthen it through continued
reform, and we recognize its many contributions to our own interest
in a more secure, democratic and humane world.''
</P>
<P>
   Helms had argued that the anticommunist Reagan doctrine had made
the world democratic without the help of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Some U.S. officials were concerned that Helms, a conservative
North Carolina Republican, had not been challenged in the council
by someone representing the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Biden, a Delaware Democrat who is the ranking
minority member of the Foreign Relations Committee, was given the
floor to respond only at a closed-door lunch the next day.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary of state described Helms as a man with strong
convictions who had his own point of view about the United Nations.
``He and I have made a point of working together when we can and
making sure that when we disagree, we do so agreeably,'' she said.
``So let me be clear: only the president and the executive branch
can speak for the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright, a veteran of much give and take at the United Nations
from her years as the U.S. representative in the first Clinton
administration, chided the council for its failure to approve
Secretary-General Kofi Annan's choice of a new chief arms inspector
for Iraq.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A week ago, Annan named Rolf Ekeus, a Swedish disarmament expert
who had been chief inspector under a previous disarmament
commission from 1991 to 1997, when he resigned to become Sweden's
ambassador to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Russia and France, with some support from China, are blocking
the appointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the work that we did here today on Africa is obviously
very important, there is no more important subject for the Security
Council to deal with than Iraq,'' Albright said. ``I was deeply
disappointed by some of the discussions last week, in which the
Security Council did not honor the agreement made that the
secretary general would name a chairman.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright said she found it ``mightily ironic'' that when Richard
Butler held the position of chief arms inspector after Ekeus, some
of the same countries that longed to have Ekeus back did not want
him now. ``I do think that the work of the council on Iraq is not
finished,'' she said, prodding the council to put the issue back on
the table.

U.S. FUNDS DIVERTED TO FORMER SOVIET GERM WARFARE PROGRAM,
SCIENTISTS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some of the U.S. money awarded to support Russia's civilian
biological research was secretly shifted to Biopreparat, a shadowy
organization that once directed the Soviet Union's germ warfare
program, several Russian scientists say.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials, who for five years have walked a delicate line
in providing aid to Russia, remain suspicious about the activities
of Biopreparat, which has been reborn as a state-owned drug
company.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans are concerned because of its continuing secrecy
and because it is led by the same military and intelligence
officers who spearheaded and concealed the Soviet Union's
biological weapons programs during the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Clinton administration officials acknowledged that
the United States had been less than meticulous in the mid-1990s in
enforcing its ban on aid to Biopreparat.
</P>
<P>
   Records show that the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration and the U.S. Agency for International Development
made grants in that period that benefited Biopreparat.
Administration officials said Monday that they had tightened their
procedures. ``There's been a learning curve,'' one administration
official said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the space agency said that it would investigate
whether any U.S. aid money had been diverted to the organization
and would withhold $1.6 million in assistance until Moscow
accounted for its spending of previous grants.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at USA.I.D. said that they had not been aware of
Biopreparat's history and that they should have checked with
national security officials before approving U.S. aid to a joint
venture that involved the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Russian biologists familiar with Biopreparat said that its
director, Gen. Yuri T. Kalinin, had shifted at least 10 percent of
several NASA grants intended for biological research in space to
his organization.
</P>
<P>
   Kalinin has headed Biopreparat since its inception in 1973.
Western officials say he is the focal point of concern among U.S.
and British intelligence analysts about whether Moscow has fully
given up research into germ warfare and what Acting President
Vladimir Putin will decide on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russian government is facing a key test,'' said an
administration official. ``Either Putin will support the old guard
of biological cold warriors, exemplified by Kalinin and his
cronies, or scientists who want to put their biological warfare
knowledge to peaceful use.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked Monday about the scientists' accusations, a spokesman for
Biopreparat declined to comment. Neither Kalinin, a former
intelligence officer, nor any senior Biopreparat official who was
active in the Soviet germ warfare program would talk about
Biopreparat's current or past activities.
</P>
<P>
   Both the United States and the Soviet Union developed germ
weapons after World War II. They agreed, by treaty, to give them up
in 1972, but a year later, Moscow secretly launched a crash program
to produce and stockpile even more lethal germs.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Alibek, Kalinin's former deputy in Biopreparat and the most
senior Soviet germ official to defect to the West, and Igor
Domaradskij, an early leader of the program, have identified
Kalinin and Biopreparat as the hub of the former Soviet germ
program. At its peak the program involved some 40 institutes across
the former Soviet Union and more than 60,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Kalinin and other senior officials from Biopreparat were also
instrumental in covering up the program's existence after the first
key scientists defected to the West in 1989, according to Alibek,
who left in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Russian scientists said Kalinin supervised Biopreparat's
transition to civilian work after the Soviet Union's collapse.
Western officials say they know little about Biopreparat's
operations.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But a Biopreparat brochure signed by Yuri T. Kalinin, identified
not by military rank but as a ``professor, Doctor of Science,''
states that the Russian government owns 51 percent of the
joint-stock company, and that Biopreparat now includes some 20
research institutes and other enterprises that make about 1,000
different vaccines, medicines and biotechnology products.
</P>
<P>
   In response to U.S. protests in 1992 of Russia's germ
activities, former Russian President Boris Yeltsin assured
Washington that he had ended his country's germ warfare program. He
also promised to dismiss Kalinin as Biopreparat's director. But for
unknown reasons, Yeltsin was unwilling or unable to fulfill that
pledge.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, tensions have arisen between Biopreparat and
several of the civilian institutes that remain under its control.
U.S. officials say their aid efforts are designed, in part, to
funnel money to those institutes while starving Biopreparat of
funds.
</P>
<P>
   But Russian scientists and U.S. officials say Kalinin has
undermined that policy, using his bureaucratic powers over the
institutes and their employees. Kalinin, who authorizes foreign
travel of employees, has also tried to prevent institutes from
developing independent ties to Western research organizations and
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Kalinin appears to have gained access to U.S. money nonetheless.
In 1995, NASA awarded $1.6 million to more than a dozen civilian
institutes to conduct biological research in space. The executive
committee set up by Russia and the United States to distribute the
money included a scientist identified in documents only as `Y.
Kalinin.'
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Arnauld E. Nicogossian, head of a NASA's $20 million joint
research program with Russia, said a man he knew as `Dr. Kalinin'
helped identify which institutes were to receive U.S. aid.
Nicogossian said he had not heard of Biopreparat until last year.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Biopreparat also stands to benefit from a 1997 grant by the
Agency for International Development. In a project approved by a
Russian-American commission headed by Vice President Al Gore, the
aid agency awarded a $6 million grant to a collaboration between
the Searle pharmaceutical unit of Monsanto and a Russian institute
partly owned by Biopreparat.
</P>
<P>
   Officials and scientists say that none of the U.S.A.I.D. money
went directly to Biopreparat. But, they acknowledge, Biopreparat
stands to earn a share of the profits if the company's sale of
high-quality medicines succeeds.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, administration officials defended the grants. The
U.S. money, they say, has helped deter a scientific brain drain to
rogue states and terrorists, and there is no indication that it was
used to support covert Russian germ research.
</P>
<P>
   But many national security officials were furious when they
first learned of Biopreparat's involvement in the grants last year.
``What happened in these cases was outrageous,'' said a senior
national security official who spoke on condition that he not be
identified. ``A..ID. and NASA were essentially running their own
foreign policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Several officials attributed the early problems to the
reluctance of intelligence officials to share information. As a
result, few U.S. officials reviewing the NASA grants in 1995 were
aware of Biopreparat's key role in the Soviet germ warfare program
or that the administration already viewed Biopreparat as hostile to
U.S. interests.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said the system for reviewing sensitive
projects is now far tougher. For example, in June 1998, the
Department of Energy rejected a request that all U.S. research
grants to institutes linked to Biopreparat be channeled through
Biopreparat officials. ``By that time,'' the official said, ``we
knew we wanted nothing to do with them.''

COURT'S RULING HEARTENS SOFT MONEY'S OPPONENTS
</HEADLINE>
 
 (ATTN: Mo., Wis., Ky., Mass., Conn., Vt.)  (With SCOTUS-FUNDRAISING) 
(nk) 
 By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Advocates of new federal limits on campaign contributions,
especially the unregulated big gifts known as soft money, said
Monday that the Supreme Court's decision upholding Missouri's
donation ceiling strengthened their hand.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who has made a ban on soft money a
centerpiece of his presidential campaign after failing to win its
passage in Congress, said of the ruling Monday while campaigning in
Plymouth, N.H.: ``I think it's marvelous, and it will help us in
our efforts to enact meaningful campaign finance reform.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the decision leaves Congress free to curb campaign
donations, most supporters of new legislation have complained that
what Congress lacks is not constitutional authority but political
will.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Russell D. Feingold, D-Wis., McCain's chief ally in the
Senate effort to prohibit soft money, said Monday night that the
decision, combined with political success for McCain and former
Sen. Bill Bradley, another presidential candidate running against
big money's influence, might provide that will.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a tight race,'' he said, ``it's almost a no-brainer to be
against soft money.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-3 decision said nothing directly about soft money. Rather,
the court reaffirmed the rationale it had set out in 1976, when it
barred limits on spending as a denial of free speech but upheld a
$1,000 contributed to a given federal candidate as a
constitutionally permissible precaution against corruption or the
appearance of corruption.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee and the National Republican
Senatorial Committee had called on the court to use the Missouri
case to throw out contribution limits, and Justice Clarence Thomas
urged that course Monday in dissent. Gov. George W. Bush of Texas,
the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, had no
comment Monday, but in a television interview on Sunday, agreed
with an earlier comment to that effect by Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Such urging had worried some advocates of tighter limits. Rep.
Chris Shays, R-Conn., who was a main sponsor of a campaign finance
overhaul bill that the House passed before a Senate filibuster
killed it Oct. 19, said, ``We were all kind of holding our
breaths.''
</P>
<P>
   As it is, the ruling, though not dealing with soft money, has
encouraged supporters of a soft-money ban with its approval of the
limit on hard-money contributions.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, for instance, talking to reporters on his campaign bus
in New Hampshire, said, ``If they had invalidated the $1,000
contribution limit, then you're finished. Then it's over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Affirming the $1,000 limit is a major, major thing. How many
times have we had the argument that money is free speech!''
</P>
<P>
   Bill McCarthy, deputy director of communications for the
Republican National Committee, said: ``We are disappointed by
today's decision. We believe that strict contribution limits
impinge on free speech, and the issue does deserve further
consideration by the courts.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who heads the senatorial
campaign committee, insisted Monday's case was inconsequential and
had no relation to the soft money battle. He called it a ``narrow
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The case had no direct bearing on this year's federal elections,
and during oral argument on Oct. 5 the court showed little
inclination to reach as broadly as the Republicans wanted. But if
the court had thrown out Missouri's limit, the federal limit would
clearly have been imperiled in the long run, and some candidates
might have chosen to evade it this year.
</P>
<P>
   As matters stand, the issue has helped McCain and Bradley,
especially in New Hampshire, where neither makes a public
appearance without raising the subject, to frequent applause.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, The Nashua Telegraph wrote: ``We endorse Bradley and
McCain to send a message. Both men promise to tackle one of the
political system's worst features, the vast system of campaign
financing that amounts to shameless influence peddling. It's time
someone tackles that conduit of rot that so taints our political
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Other advocates of tighter limits joined McCain and Feingold in
praising the court's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one more weapon in our arsenal,'' said Rep. Martin
Meehan, D-Mass., who worked with Shays in the House. ``Today's
decision will strengthen the hands of the majorities in both houses
who voted against soft money.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred Wertheimer, a longtime supporter of tighter limits, ``This
decision peels away the phony argument that the Constitution can be
used to protect corrupting campaign spending.''
</P>
<P>
   And Thomas Mann, of the Brookings Institution and an expert on
Congress, said the importance of the decision was what it did not
do _ invalidate the contribution limits from the federal Election
Campaign Act of 1974. If it had done that, he said ``the entire
remaining edifice of campaign finance regulation would have crashed
to the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said, ``the current court believes that corruption
and the appearance of corruption is a compelling rationale for
restricting the flow of money,'' and Congress can do so if it has
the will.

COUP STAINS REPUTATION OF ECUADOR'S MILITARY 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   QUITO, Ecuador _ Ousted President Jamil Mahuad wasn't the only
victim of last week's military uprising.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the coup tarnished the reputation the Ecuadorean
military, long considered one of Latin America's most enlightened
armies.
</P>
<P>
   ``They now represent a danger to democracy,'' said Bertha
Garcia, a political science professor at Catholic University in
Ecuador's capital of Quito.
</P>
<P>
   But others say the military came to its senses just in time.
</P>
<P>
   After forcing out Mahuad on Friday, the general in charge of a
provisional junta stepped down early Saturday, allowing Vice
President Gustavo Noboa to claim the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a tendency to view this as a traditional coup,
but it's more complicated than that,'' said a U.S. military officer
who monitors Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
   ``The high command did what it could to avoid violence and to
bring the country back as close as it could to constitutional
channels,'' said the officer, who spoke on condition that he not be
named.
</P>
<P>
   During Friday's uprising, thousands of Indians descended on
Quito to protest Ecuador's worst economic crisis since the Great
Depression. They occupied the Congress building and demanded that
Mahuad resign.
</P>
<P>
   Idealistic military officers were intrigued, and nearly 200
joined the revolt. Many were familiar with the Indians' plight.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers have long been dispatched to the poorest pockets of
Ecuador to build schools, vaccinate infants and plant trees. Such
civic-action programs have put troops in close contact with
Indians, who make up 25 percent of Ecuador's 12 million population.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't just sit there with our arms crossed,'' said one
officer who joined the rebellion, according to the Quito newspaper
El Comercio.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say that by forcing out Mahuad, the army pulled off a
coup, plain and simple.
</P>
<P>
   But former Defense Minister Gen. Carlos Mendoza, a member of the
junta that briefly replaced Mahuad, said that army commanders were
simply trying to restore order.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference Monday, Mendoza argued that by joining the
junta then stepping down three hours later, the effect was to
short-circuit the protests. In turn, civilian rule was restored and
the armed forces addressed its badly divided officer corps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (army officers) were responding to a number of
pressures but high on the list was the need to reunify the
military,'' said Shelley McConnell, a Latin America expert at the
Carter Center in Atlanta. ``In Latin America, one thing that
militaries do not tolerate well is disunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Ecuador's military governments gave way to civilian
rule in 1979, the armed forces have generally supported democratic
rule.
</P>
<P>
   But democracy has often failed the people. Corruption has become
rampant, and poverty has increased. Thanks to brutal infighting _
often called ``political cannibalism'' here _ Ecuador has gone
through four presidents in the past three years. As a result, polls
regularly list the military as the nation's most popular
institution.
</P>
<P>
   Although many Ecuadoreans despised Mahuad, they were shocked
Friday to see military officers apparently taking over the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``They must be jailed so we never go through this circus
again,'' said Francisco Alarcon, president of the Chamber of
Industry in Guayaquil.
</P>
<P>
   Congress will review the issue this week, but so far just one
colonel has been detained. And Monday, President Noboa named Gen.
Telmo Sandoval, who many observers believe was part of a conspiracy
against Mahuad, as head of the military high command.
</P>
<P>
   Political analyst Fernando Bustamante said the new president
owes his job to the military and is unlikely to push for a purge of
the institution. Instead, the president may have to watch his own
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll have to keep an eye on the barracks much more than any
other president,'' Bustamante said.
</P>
<P>
   Others point out that neither the air force nor the navy took
part in Friday's rebellion. The vast majority of the officer corps
remained loyal to Mahuad to the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard nothing from responsible senior leaders to indicate
that they want the burden of trying to run the country,'' said the
U.S. officer.
</P>
<P>
   Alarcon, the Chamber of Industry leader, suggested that
ambitious officers should simply quit the military and form a
political party.
</P>
<P>
   In nearby Venezuela, Army Lt. Col. Hugo Chavez led a failed coup
attempt in 1992. He spent two years in jail, then ran for president
in 1998 and won.
</P>
<P>
   But few Ecuadorean military men have fared well in electoral
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Paco Moncayo, for example, was perhaps this nation's most
respected military leader. He later retired and won a congressional
seat. But on Friday, he joined the coup plotters and on Monday
resigned his seat in disgrace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because you wear officer's bars doesn't mean you can run
the country,'' Alarcon said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials denounced the coup, but a cutoff of aid to the
Ecuadorean military is unlikely, said Adam Isacson of the Center
for International Policy in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the U.S. Army's elite Special Forces have trained
more than 1,000 Ecuadorean troops in the past two years. And the
Pentagon is spending millions of dollars to upgrade a key military
base on the Pacific coast that will allow U.S. pilots to fly
anti-drug missions in the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``There won't be any real push to the make Ecuadorean military
more democratic because the line here is that they did the right
thing,'' Isacson said.

SHANAHAN: HE'S BEEN THERE, WON THAT
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Mike Shanahan, the winning coach in Super Bowls XXXII
and XXXIII, has no plans to travel anywhere near Super Bowl XXXIV.
His team, the Denver Broncos, is the two-time defending champion
for only six more days. Either the Tennessee Titans or the St.
Louis Rams will take the Broncos' throne on Sunday night. For
Shanahan, this is not a glorious idea or a pretty sight.
</P>
<P>
   He will watch from Denver, scouring tapes and his notes on free
agency, breaking down the draft, signing some veteran Broncos,
releasing a few, searching for that super mix that can once again
plant him in the super game. Shanahan has been in six Super Bowls
as an assistant coach in Denver and San Francisco and as the head
coach in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   He can give the Titans and the Rams, both wide-eyed arrivals at
the Super Bowl, plenty to ponder the week. The Rams have been to
the Super Bowl once, in 1980, when they were based in Los Angeles;
the Titans, formerly the Houston Oilers, have never been to the
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've watched a little about this game and I forgot about the
hype involved,'' Shanahan said on Monday by telephone from his
office in Denver. ``When you're coaching in this game, you focus.
But being away from it for the first time in two years, I see
clearly the huge coverage and hype involved. Everybody feels good
now, but by the end, only one team can feel that good.''
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan continued: ``There haven't been many Super Bowls when
there was only one week to prepare; that changes things
significantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the six Super Bowls I was involved in, we had the game plan
implemented the week before the game three times and won all three;
in the three we lost, we did it the week of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of these teams must have had people last week preparing
for this game, making sure everything was arranged. I wonder about
the coaches and the game plans. Are some coaches going to stay back
and arrive late to finish them? I would think so.''
</P>
<P>
   Only four of the previous 33 Super Bowls had one week between
the conference championship games and the Super Bowl. The last time
was in 1994, Super Bowl XXVIII, between Dallas and Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan watched a bit of both conference championship games on
Sunday and said both the Titans' and the Rams' defenses were
excelling. That is the key ingredient, he said, to winning the
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tennessee has impressed me most because they have won five
straight games against teams that have won 11 or more games,''
Shanahan said. ``Finding ways to win those kinds of games makes you
uniquely prepared for the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   He wonders about the weather in Atlanta _ this week temperatures
are expected to hover near 35 degrees, and snow is possible _ even
though the game will be played in the Georgia Dome. Practices are
scheduled for outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   He said the setting for the players was also important. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``How you have the team hotel set up for the players is
critical,'' Shanahan said. ``You want it as normal as possible. We
had an area set aside for the players that had video games,
pop-and-shot basketball, pool, air hockey, and to watch extra game
film. The players need an outlet for the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Saturday night, our players had their own rooms and their
families were not allowed. You want them the night before the game
to be rested and not distracted. I think last year the Atlanta
players had their families with them on Saturday night. We kept our
guys busy up to curfew at 11:15 that night and then alone
afterward.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try to do everything you've been doing and not get caught
up in the hype,'' Shanahan said. ``You can't be too conservative.
You may have a few different plays, a couple of different blitzes,
but you have to guard against overload. You can't make it where the
players are thinking too much instead of performing.''
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan said there would be several important facets in the
game for the teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are the defenses playing with confidence?'' he said.
``Turnovers and ball security; pass protect, don't allow cheap
scores and make the other team earn it. And penalties _ stay away
from first-and-20 or second-and-20. Concentrate during the game and
don't get caught up in the hoopla surrounding you in the stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   Concentration is crucial for the young, high-flying Titans and
Rams, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So often, young guys who haven't been to the Super Bowl get
caught up,'' Shanahan said. ``I would remind them that this is not
an award. This is a work week. You don't go to the Super Bowl to
just have fun, you go to win the game. It doesn't matter that
you're there unless you win it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know from experience that if you don't win the game, people
within a year will forget you were even there. Going into it, you
have to realize that's simply the way it is and it can happen to
you.''
</P>

 WASHINGTON: the court. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The challenge to the Missouri contribution limit, adopted by the
state Legislature in 1994, was brought by a former candidate for
state auditor and a political action committee that supported him.
The candidate, Zev David Fredman, argued that the limit was so low
that, as an insurgent, he could not exercise his First Amendment
right to mount an effective campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Fredman's victory in the appeals court threatened to unsettle
many states' contribution limits on two levels: first, under the
notion that inflation should be taken into account in assessing a
limit's adequacy, and second, by demanding a level of evidence of
corruption beyond what the Supreme Court had required when it
upheld the federal limits in Buckley vs. Valeo.
</P>
<P>
   In his opinion Monday, Souter said the 8th Circuit's view that
inflation must be taken into account reflected a ``fundamental
misunderstanding'' of Buckley vs. Valeo as having adopted any
particular level as a minimum. And on the question of evidence, he
said, ``this case does not present a close call.'' Souter said
``there is little reason to doubt'' that large contributions can be
corrupting, or can be seen as such by voters.
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of constitutional doctrine, there was considerable
wrestling over how to define the First Amendment standard of review
for the limits in question, an issue on which the Buckley precedent
was imprecise. The majority held Monday that the strictest judicial
scrutiny need not apply to contribution limits.

COURT RULES ON REDISTRICTING AND MINORITY VOTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La.)  (lb) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court ruled Monday in an important
voting-rights case that the Justice Department must approve
districting changes, even those adopted with a discriminatory
purpose, as long as the changes leave minority voters in no worse a
position than before.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-4 decision addressed a question that arises often in the
government's enforcement of the Voting Rights Act of 1965: What
should be done about a jurisdiction that chooses to entrench the
status quo in refusing, for example, to draw district lines that
would make it more likely for a black candidate to be elected where
none had been elected before?
</P>
<P>
   The section of the law at issue ``prevents nothing but
backsliding,'' Justice Antonin Scalia wrote for the majority,
adding that the federal government's role in approving a change
``affirms nothing but the absence of backsliding.''
</P>
<P>
   In an opinion for the four dissenters, Justice David H. Souter
objected that the majority had adopted an ``exceedingly odd'' and
implausible interpretation that would leave the Voting Rights Act
``substantially diminished.'' The government, Souter said, would be
forced to approve ``unconstitutional voting schemes patently
intended to perpetuate discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision, affirming a ruling by a special three-judge
federal district court panel here, upheld the 1992 redistricting of
the school board in Bossier Parish in Louisiana. The board's 12
districts included none with a majority of black voters, although
two majority-black districts could have been drawn under an
alternative plan that the local leadership of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People had presented to
the board.
</P>
<P>
   Section 5, the section of the 1965 law at issue, requires
``covered jurisdictions'' _ state and local governments across the
South as well as parts of some northern cities with histories of
low minority participation in voting _ to seek ``preclearance''
from the Justice Department or the federal district court here
before putting any voting change into effect.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, the jurisdiction has the legal burden of proving
that its change ``does not have the purpose and will not have the
effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race
or color.'' After the Justice Department refused to preclear the
school board lines on the ground that Bossier Parish had not met
that burden, the county exercised its right to seek preclearance in
federal court.
</P>
<P>
   In approving the new lines, the district court said that all
that mattered was the absence of ``retrogression''; that is, even
if the school board had a discriminatory purpose, black voters
would fare no worse than they had before the change. The question
for the Supreme Court was whether Section 5 could be satisfied so
easily: whether the law's ``purpose'' test could be met, even if
the purpose was discriminatory, as long as there was no
retrogression.
</P>
<P>
   The decision rejected an approach to Section 5 preclearance that
the Justice Department had used for 30 years, under which
jurisdictions were required to prove not only a lack of effect, but
also the absence of a discriminatory purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Coming on the eve of the 2000 census, which will inevitably be
followed by a wave of redistricting and hundreds or thousands of
preclearance requests, the decision is likely to have a substantial
effect on the administration of the Voting Rights Act.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Civil rights lawyers have maintained that local governments are
much less likely now than in the past to adopt overtly
discriminatory strategies that, for example, actually reduced
existing black voting strength.
</P>
<P>
   A more subtle refusal to adopt available improvements is a more
likely strategy that can be shielded by the ``no retrogression''
test, lawyers who have handled these cases say. In its brief to the
court, the Justice Department said the standard that the district
court had adopted ``threatens seriously to impair enforcement of
the act.''
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Individual Rights, a conservative public interest
law firm here that represented Bossier Parish, said in a statement
Monday that the decision meant the Justice Department ``may no
longer use the preclearance provision of the Voting Rights Act to
force local jurisdictions to artificially maximize the number of
minority districts.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Carvin, the lawyer who argued the case, said the court
had ``effectively ended the Clinton Justice Department's efforts to
force localities to racially gerrymander under the Voting Rights
Act.''
</P>
<P>
   Christine DiBartolo, a spokeswoman for the department's civil
rights division, said the department was ``disappointed'' by the
decision but was determined to ``continue to use all means at our
disposal to ensure that all voters have an equal opportunity to
participate in the electoral system.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision did not involve another section of the law, Section
2, which applies nationwide and which provides another route to
challenging obstacles to full participation by minority voters. But
Section 5 has always been seen as the more powerful enforcement
tool in the circumstances in which it applies, because
jurisdictions have the burden of proof under Section 5 while
challengers have the burden of proof under Section 2.
</P>
<P>
   The case, Reno vs. Bossier Parish School Board, No. 98-405, has
been a particularly troublesome one for the court over the last
three years. After an initial decision in 1997, which sent the case
back to the lower court for further analysis, the justices heard
arguments last April without deciding the case. A second argument
was held in October.
</P>
<P>
   Scalia's majority opinion was joined by Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist and by Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony M. Kennedy
and Clarence Thomas. Thomas wrote a concurring opinion pointing out
that three black candidates had been elected to the school board
from majority-white districts after the lawsuit was filed, thus
showing, he said, that majority-black districts were unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   Justices John Paul Stevens, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G.
Breyer joined Souter's dissenting opinion.

IOWA OVER, CANDIDATES EXPECTED TO PUMP UP NEW HAMPSHIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Now, it gets intense.
</P>
<P>
   As he arrives on the heels of losing the Iowa caucuses, former
Senator Bill Bradley plans to spend his week fighting back against
Vice President Al Gore. In a speech in Hudson in a television ad
featuring Niki Tsongas, and through congressional surrogates such
as Senator Bob Kerrey and Representatives Anna Eshoo and Luis
Gutierrez, Bradley will be drawing contrasts and getting aggressive
during the last week before the New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill will be talking about the lessons he's learned in Iowa,
that you've got to fight back,'' said Mark Longabaugh, Bradley's
state director. ``You will see that in a very aggressive fashion in
the next seven days. He will take that campaign to the people in a
very assertive fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   In the remaining days here, each of the Republican and
Democratic candidates will be making their final sales pitch,
trying to close the deal with the voters of New Hampshire. Some
will stick to themes they have been laying out for the last year,
while others, like Bradley, will try to shake up the race with a
new line of attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the week when, after all the build-up, the electorate
really goes into its buying mode,'' said Thomas D. Rath, who is
advising Texas Governor George W. Bush. ``This is the week when we
stop kicking the tires and start making selections. Candidacies and
political futures are very much on the line here.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, voters will be paying more attention, the
media will be swarming after the candidates like locusts, and
volunteers will be knocking on doors and dropping off literature
like lemmings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be bedlam,'' predicted Mike Dennehy, the New
England director for Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican.
``This is when everyone living in New Hampshire, ages 2 to 92, is
paying attention.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, Bush will continue to talk about taxes
and education, appealing to registered Republican voters; McCain
will talk about leadership and foreign policy, revisiting towns
where he has strong independent support; and Steve Forbes will try
to carve into Bush's lead using a second-place win out of Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   For the Democrats, Bradley will be trying to pull out of his
downward slide in the polls with sharp words for Gore and a
barnstorming tour to each of the state's 10 counties. Gore, on the
other hand, will emphasize education, the economy and health care
as he travels to heavily Democratic population centers, such as
Portsmouth, Concord and the Connecticut River Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last week is going to be a more frenetic week than any
week that has preceded it,'' said Douglas Hattaway, a Gore
spokesman. ``We're trying to cover as much of the state as we
possibly can within the confines of the schedule, which includes
the debate and the State of the Union, not to mention the
Superbowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Most candidates will spend their time pumping up known
supporters and still trying to convert the fence-sitters. That last
category, however, is dwindling rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Of those planning to vote in the Republican primary, only 3
percent are still undecided, said Andy Smith, director of the
University of New Hampshire survey center. For the Democratic
primary, only 8 percent have yet to make up their mind.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith said there is still some flux in the race.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, 67 percent of voters said they are
certain about their decision, while 33 percent said they may still
change their mind. On the Democratic side, 72 percent of the voters
said their decision is firm, while 28 percent may yet have a change
of heart.
</P>
<P>
   While most candidates will be talking about issues, Patrick W.
Griffin, a Bush adviser, said the Texas governor will still be
introducing himself to voters as he plays catch-up to McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message is really to say to people, you need to know more
about me as a person,'' Griffin said. ``Not only know what I think,
but how I deal with this, how I respond to the week between Iowa
and New Hampshire.''

BRADLEY SAYS CAMPAIGN IS ON RIGHT PATH
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMES, Iowa _ Despite concerns among some aides about the state
of his campaign, former Sen. Bill Bradley said Monday that he was
more convinced than ever that the course he chartered for his
presidential campaign more than a year ago was fundamentally
correct.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Bradley's insurgent campaign has been battered
by negative news coverage and falling poll numbers, and many
political analysts have argued that he has not been sharp enough in
drawing distinctions with Gore or aggressive enough in responding
to the vice president's repeated attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Even some of his aides have recently raised questions about the
campaign's tactics in Iowa, complaining that it had been late
getting organized, slow to respond to Gore's criticisms and
inadequate in preparing Bradley for debates. One adviser described
Iowa as a ``shakedown tour'' for the Bradley organization.
</P>
<P>
   But in an interview Monday just before the Iowa caucuses,
Bradley suggested that if anything he had been too negative in his
battle with Gore, arguing that the ``rat-a-tat-tat'' of the race
might have turned off voters and drawn attention from his own
idealistic call to reform politics and end poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were trying to do a cookie-cutter campaign where you go
negative on somebody, there's a little textbook that you take that
says, chapter four, going negative, here are the five things you
do,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What adds to cynicism in politics is negative campaigning and
attack ads,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   But even as Bradley contends that he will try to stay above the
messy fray, his aides said they recognized that they, and Bradley's
prominent supporters, will need to strike back faster and perhaps
more fiercely against Gore when he goes on the offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said he realized his campaign had drifted from its
moorings last week when he heard the story of a New Hampshire woman
whose teen-age son apologized for getting sick because the family
had no health insurance. Her story, which brought tears to his
eyes, ``recentered'' him on the reasons he had entered the race,
particularly to create a system of near universal health insurance,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes in the rat-a-tat-tat of politics, in the rush of the
media and the emphasis on tactics, you lose sight of why you're in
this,'' he said. But there may also be political reasons for
Bradley's wanting to step back from attacking Gore. Two weeks ago,
Bradley had been sharpening his criticism of the vice president,
even attacking a 15-year-old Senate vote by Gore that helped the
tobacco industry. But many analysts said Bradley's attacks gave a
sense of desperation in his camp.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has also toned down his criticism of Bradley in recent
days. Asked whether he would return fire if Gore started attacking
him again in New Hampshire, site of the nation's first primary next
Tuesday, Bradley replied, ``You always have the option, of course,
to adopt the atomic bomb. But the point is, I'm going to try to
keep this thing positive.''
</P>
<P>
   To both his critics and supporters, Bradley's refusal to
aggressively attack Gore recalls his 1990 re-election campaign,
where he was very slow to respond to criticism by his opponent,
Christie Whitman, and almost lost the New Jersey Senate race. Some
political analyst argued that the race showed that Bradley was too
headstrong to adjust his campaign strategies to deal with
unforeseen or shifting circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley denied that he was inflexible, saying: ``I think
there should be a distinction drawn between being inflexible and
being rooted. I'm rooted in what I know what I believe and what I
know I want to do. I'm flexible in how I want to achieve it.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had no plans to change significantly his basic stump
speech in the coming weeks. But Bradley offered a glimpse Monday of
the message he intends to emphasize in New Hampshire: that he would
be better at maintaining the nation's prosperity because he has a
track record of predicting changes in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been on the point, meaning I have been there a few
years before other people,'' he said, referring to his early
support in the 1980s for cutting the deficit, reducing Third World
debt and simplifying the tax code.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has also sought to cast himself as the best candidate for
managing the nation's economy.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said he would increasingly highlight the economic
benefits of his health-care proposal, which he said would provide
the equivalent of a $25 billion-a-year tax cut for people earning
less than $50,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is those families don't know yet what I'm trying to
do,'' Bradley said of lower-income voters.

GORE LOOKS TO STIFFER COMPETITION IN N.H. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES _ Poised to coast to victory in the Iowa caucuses, Al
Gore was playing down expectations of a big win over Bill Bradley
in the Democratic contest while also looking ahead to the next big
battle in New Hampshire, where he faces a tougher fight with the
former New Jersey senator.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the returns began coming in, Gore telephoned New
Hampshire Governor Jeanne Shaheen, who was hosting a party for his
supporters, to let her know he was on his way. He was to scheduled
to leave Iowa after midnight for the first primary state.
</P>
<P>
   Despite polls in Iowa showing Gore ahead by a 2-to-1 margin, the
vice president campaigned throughout the day, speaking at a high
school in Cedar Rapids, greeting diners in Davenport before flying
to Des Moines to claim his expected victory and thank workers at
his campaign headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   And though exuding confidence from the moment he emerged from
his Cedar Rapids hotel Monday morning to board his campaign bus
without a coat or gloves despite sub-zero temperatures, he said,
``I'm not counting my chickens before they're hatched.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, Gore played down expectations of a big
margin of victory over Bradley, saying, ``A win is a win,'' while
adding, ``I'm hoping for one more vote than the other fellow.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator John F. Kerry of Massachusetts said Monday that a Gore
win in Iowa would give the vice president energy going into New
Hampshire but would not necessarily translate into votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be no sense of triumph,'' said Kerry, who has
been campaigning for Gore. ``New Hampshire is a new race. This is
here, and New Hampshire is New Hampshire. The voters are very
independent minded.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, the biggest worry for the Gore campaign has been
voter complaceny, given his large lead in the polls. He took pains
to remind his audiences, ``Don't believe the polls.''
</P>
<P>
   He also had tempered his criticism of Bradley after months of
skewering the former New Jersey senator's proposals on health care
and education, and questioning his comitment to family farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, he said of Bradley, ``I think that he is a formidable
opponent, and I'm grateful for the chance to be in this race with
him.''
</P>
<P>
   But asked what distinquished him from Bradley, Gore said, ``I'm
a fighter. For 23 years, I have been unafraid to take on special
interests, and the issue of experience I think is an important
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also made clear that he was trying to rebuild bridges he
burned in Iowa during his first campaign in 1988, when he
criticized the state's outsized influence in the presidential race.
``I've learned my lesson. I have been building bridges as fast I
know how to.''
</P>
<P>
   But hours before the caucuses began, Gore, who in recent days
has been talking about his ``imperfections'' and ``shortcomings''
without elaboration, was facing questions about past marijuana use.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by a reporter at the the Iowa Machine Shed, the Davenport
diner, whether he had smoked pot on a daily basis, he answered
``no.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came back from Vietnam, yes, but not to that extent,''
he said. ``This is something I dealt with a long time ago. It's old
news.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Gore previously acknowledged smoking marijuana up until
1972, he denied a claim by John Wernecke, who worked with Gore at
the Nashville Tennessean, that he smoked every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was young, I did things young people do. When I grew
up, I put away childish things,'' Gore said.

 High court upholds Missouri campaign contribution limit   
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY and WILL SENTELL  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a decision that sent election-year ripples
across the country, the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday upheld
Missouri's $1,075 limit on campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled 6-3 that the Missouri limit, passed in 1994,
does not inhibit free speech. A different finding could have
undermined limits in nearly 30 other states as well as the $1,000
cap in presidential and congressional races.
</P>
<P>
   The court essentially reaffirmed a landmark 1976 ruling that the
federal campaign limit was an appropriate way to keep big donations
from corrupting politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is little reason to doubt that sometimes large
contributions will work actual corruption on our political system
and no reason to question the existence of a corresponding
suspicion among voters,'' said Justice David Souter, writing for
the majority.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling is seen as a boost for further campaign reform, such
as limits on so-called soft money that is spent indirectly to
benefit candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``This a tremendous day in the history of the reform effort,''
said Sen. Russ Feingold, a Wisconsin Democrat who wants to tighten
the financial reins on campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   More campaign-funding limits has been a rallying cry for
presidential candidate Sen. John McCain, a Republican from Arizona
and Bill Bradley, a Democrat and former senator from New Jersey.
McCain is co-sponsor of a bill with Feingold.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents said the $1,075 limit in Missouri and the $1,000 limit
nationwide are too low, especially in light of inflation since
1976, when the court upheld the federal limit in Buckley vs. Valeo.
Congress imposed the federal limit in the wake of the Watergate
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri's limit began at $1,000 in 1994 and increases with
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican who has bucked
campaign finance reform, said a limit is warranted but should be no
lower than $3,000. The court ruling doesn't derail those hopes, a
lawyer for McConnell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing that remains clear is that Congress could legislate
a higher limit if it chooses to,'' said Bobby Burchfield, who filed
a brief in the case for McConnell and the Republican Party. ``They
may even be emboldened by the realization that the court is not
going to do it for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Many members of Congress took sides in the Missouri case, and 29
states joined Missouri in defending the limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court's opinion keeps open the door for states to pass
reasonable contribution limits,'' said Scott Harshbarger, president
of Common Cause, which advocates campaign spending restraint.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri Attorney General Jay Nixon argued the case before the
high court.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big win for the state of Missouri in a landmark
decision that turns the tide nationally for campaign reform
efforts,'' he said. ``Quite simply, elections are not auctions and
candidates are not to be sold to the highest bidder.''
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri limits were challenged by St. Louis resident Zev
David Fredman, who wanted to run for state auditor in early 1998.
He got one donation of $1,075 from a political action committee
called Shrink Missouri Government, and then went to court to test
the law.
</P>
<P>
   Fredman won before the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals in St.
Louis, which ruled 2-1 that there was no evidence that unlimited
contributions were corrupting.
</P>
<P>
   Fredman, a 37-year-old certified public accountant, said Monday
the court ruling works in favor of incumbent politicians because
they can raise more money from more sources than can a challenger
who may have to rely on a few major backers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in the politician's interest to reduce competition, and I
can't think of anything that reduces competition in a more
effective way than campaign finance limits,'' Fredman said.
</P>
<P>
   Souter said Missouri did not have to prove that unlimited
donations would cause corruption and that capping donations did not
limit free speech. That brought sharp rebukes from the three
dissenting justices _ Clarence Thomas, Anthony Kennedy and Antonin
Scalia.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said the nation's founders believed that a self-governing
people depended upon free speech and free exchange of political
ideas. ``And that free exchange should receive the most attention
when it matters most _ during campaigns for elective office,'' he
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But Justice John Paul Stevens argued that freedom to speak out
on issues and to inspire volunteers for the campaign is not the
same as the freedom to donate unlimited amounts of money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money is property; it is not speech,'' Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri's Nixon said he interpreted the ruling to mean that
contributors who already have given the maximum under the law for
candidates in the primaries _ $1,075 for statewide offices _ cannot
contribute again until the general election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   However, candidates who have received contributions over the
limits are not obliged to return the money. ``It is up to the
individual candidate,'' Nixon said.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon noted that the state tried to persuade the courts to keep
the contribution limits in effect while judges reviewed the law.
But when the courts rejected that request, the way opened for
candidates to accept unlimited contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Partly as a result, the Missouri governor's race is on a record
financial pace. Democrat Bob Holden recently reported that he had
raised $3.9 million, and Republican Jim Talent said he had
collected $3 million. Gov. Mel Carnahan spent $4 million for his
entire campaign when he was elected governor in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The Holden and Talent camps said they would adhere to the limit
but had no plans to return money already received.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to do what the law requires; nothing more,
nothing less,'' said Richard Martin, Holden's campaign manager.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Boriss, spokesman for Talent, said the congressman will
follow the law.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Martin nor Boriss said they knew how much their
candidates had collected in donations of more than $1,075.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon said he understood the court ruling to mean Missouri's
limit on contributions to state senate candidates is $525 and $275
to candidates for state representative.

ON THE ROAD IN N.H., CANDIDATE DISMISSES IOWA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEBANON, N.H. _ ``We're a campaign about message,'' Senator John
McCain said as his bus was hurtling toward the next campaign stop
here. ``Iowa is about organization.''
</P>
<P>
   So Monday, when the rest of the presidential candidates were
watching the Iowa caucus returns, McCain was expounding on this
latest theme _ that he is the most prepared man for the job _ in an
effort to win New Hampshire's Feb. 1 primary.
</P>
<P>
   At every stop, the former Vietnam prisoner of war highlighted
the importance of a president having military and foreign policy
experience.
</P>
<P>
   The message is clearly targeted at Republican front-runner
George W. Bush, who served in the Texas Air National Guard after
college but never saw combat.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has also launched a 30-second commercial, titled
``Commander,'' which does not mention by name the Texas governor.
But the point of the TV spot attempts to undercut Bush, who last
fall failed a reporter's pop quiz on the names of foreign leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only one man running for president who knows the
military and understands the world. John McCain,'' the ad states.
``As a Navy pilot and POW, he's seen the horrors of war. As a
senator, he's already one of the nation's leaders in knowing how to
keep the peace.''
</P>
<P>
   On the stump, McCain said he would never take a poll to
determine foreign policy, a line that earned him applause during a
town meeting at the Plymouth Armory.
</P>
<P>
   McCain spent the day holding three town meetings, including his
100th in this state: a photo-opportunity his campaign staff swore
was a coincidence falling on the same day as the Iowa caucuses,
which he chose to skip.
</P>
<P>
   He also addressed a government class at Moultonborough Academy
and finished his schedule with a ``celebration'' of New Hampshire's
first-in-the-nation primary, a polite way for the maverick senator
to thumb his nose at Iowa, a state where he has only campaigned
twice, both times attending debates.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush spent millions there, McCain joked that he spent
about $1,500 in Iowa, ``including steak dinners and airfare.'' Yet,
McCain's overall strategy of focusing on New Hampshire so far is
paying off, as he leads in the polls here against Bush. He even
waved around a newspaper column proclaiming the move a stroke of
``genius.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so much a test for us, but a test for Bush,'' McCain
campaign manager Mike Murphy said of coming primaries. If Bush
``loses New Hampshire and South Carolina,'' a state where McCain is
gaining steam, ``I don't think he'll be the party nominee.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Bush would get a boost out of his caucus wins, Murphy
predicted ``the Iowa hubbub will be gone by Thursday.''
</P>
<P>
   However, it appears the intense politicking before the Feb. 1
primary in the Granite State is taking its toll on the McCain
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, for the first time, McCain's aides asked the press
to leave the Straight Talk Express bus to give the candidate time
to rest. And McCain's wife Cindy had to be taken to the emergency
room to be treated for a migraine.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain is soldiering on.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of blaring music _ including the song
``Johnny B. Goode'' _ at the start and close of is 100th town
meeting, the day was like most others he has spent here over the
last year.
</P>
<P>
   The crowds are bigger and the bus more crowded, though there are
few new questions at town hall meetings and virtually no new
answers.

PARCELLS AND GROH ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT JETS' FUTURE
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ Al Groh wanted to make it very clear on
Monday: He is not just the New York Jets' transition coach, but is
in it for the long haul. And while Groh put on a commanding
performance as he was introduced as the 14th head coach in Jets'
history, Bill Parcells hinted that he himself is a short-termer.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells, the only coach to have a winning career record with
the Jets, said that he would remain as the club's director of
football operations but would eventually reassess his future with
the new owner, Woody Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to act in a support role,'' Parcells said, ``and
basically going to try to be a consultant to Al and a supporter and
an adviser, and will do that until such time as Woody and I get a
chance to revisit my status much later on.'' According to Johnson,
that meeting will take place in midsummer, or about the time
training camp begins.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the 58-year-old Parcells said he was ceding the
powers of personnel selection to Groh, who has never been a head
coach in the NFL. Parcells said that Groh, 55, who received a
four-year contract worth $800,000 annually, will have the last word
on trades, the draft and free-agent acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   In so doing, Parcells is assigning to Groh powers that Parcells
never enjoyed with the New York Giants _ his first head coaching
job _ or the New England Patriots, whom he left after control of
personnel matters became a contentious issue with the owner, Robert
K. Kraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all of you know that I have a very strong belief in
that a coach must be allowed to shape and form his team the way he
wants to,'' Parcells said. ``I've been an advocate of that. I think
it's important, I think he has enough experience coaching and has
seen enough programs in operation to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The 21 days that shook the Jets may have come to an end with
Monday's announcements, or at least muffled the rattling. It began
on Jan. 3 with Parcells' decision to step down as head coach after
three seasons that transformed the club. He was replaced
immediately by Bill Belichick, whose contract called for his
ascension if Parcells gave up the coaching reins.
</P>
<P>
   But a day later Belichick himself quit, citing the uncertainty
over the as yet unknown owner and the role Parcells would play. Now
the loose ends aren't as critical: On the home front, Groh will
choose his assistant coaches; on the Belichick front, the Jets have
a federal court date on Tuesday, along with the NFL. They will
answer Belichick's charge that they are stopping him from making a
living by holding him to his Jets' contract. Belichick wants to go
to the Patriots, but must negotiate a deal with the Jets over his
services. According to New England, the Jets have demanded a
first-round pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you'll grow to like this guy,'' said Johnson, speaking
of Groh. Johnson paid $635 million for the Jets and was approved as
the new owner a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a good introduction to football because things
go right, things go wrong, and this is just the way it is,'' said
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   One of the things that went right, he claimed, was getting Groh.
Johnson had said he was not going to limit the search to current
Jets' coaching, and claimed he and Parcells looked around the
league before choosing their linebackers' coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is very intelligent,'' Johnson said. ``He's been around
football, and I think he's capable of giving this team what it
needs, which will keep the progress growing in the development of
the championship team.''
</P>
<P>
   In a question-and-answer session filled with quips and serious
intentions _ Groh asked the news media not to describe his talks as
``rambling,'' as it did Belichick's stunning, long-winded
retirement announcement _ the new coach addressed the questions of
most fans:
</P>
<P>
   _ On following the future hall-of-famer Parcells: ``This staff
and this team will be my staff and my team. I did not want to be
the continuity candidate. I didn't want to be the stability
candidate because we are dealing with the future.'' Groh added that
he and Parcells have similar attitudes toward fielding a team.
</P>
<P>
   _ On putting together a staff (he needs a complete body of
defensive coaches and possibly a new offensive coordinator and wide
receivers coach): ``Our staff is quickly falling into place both
with people currently here, and we have been both aggressive and
expedient in making contact with a number of people around the
league.'' He did not expect this to be completed for at least a few
days. He was noncommittal on Charlie Weis' status as offensive
coordinator-receivers' coach.
</P>
<P>
   _ On what the Jets will be like: ``I think the common threads to
all the teams that we've had _ we've been a physically strong team,
we've been a strong team. That owes a lot to the commitment of the
off-season training program. We've been an extremely well-prepared
team. We've been a disciplined team and we've been a team that has
been very, very game-alert, very game-smart and very game-aware.''
</P>
<P>
   Groh admitted that he anticipated the questions about being in
Parcells' shadow, that Ray Handley failed following Parcells with
the Giants and Pete Carroll was unable to escape it at New England.
</P>
<P>
   Groh claimed he has thought about it so much, and anticipated
all the inquiries about it, that he said he had ``a 67-page
memorandum to hand out.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added, seriously, ``The best way to replace Bill Parcells
is with a Parcells guy. There's been a firm hand on the rudder of
every team that Bill's been on. The players are used to being
coached and prepared in a particular way. They get used to that and
they've had success with it, and to change that sometimes kind of
throws them off compass. I think that was certainly a difficult
situation for our successor s at New England.''
</P>
<P>
   His promotion from linebackers' coach to head coach caps a
football career that began as the freshman coach at West Point 32
years ago. It included stints with Parcells at two colleges and
three NFL clubs. It included the usual amount of moving and
uprooting that is the lot of most assistant coaches. He has been at
seven colleges and five NFL teams.
</P>
<P>
   But Joe Thomas, one of his old high school coaches at Chaminade,
in Mineola, N.Y., remembered the intense young Groh.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would yell at the guys at half-time,'' Thomas said. ``He'd
be giving them pep talks.''
</P>
<P>
   And Groh's immediate plans? He said he would not be going to
next Sunday's Super Bowl _ though he has twice been to the big game
as an assistant.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I'm not going,'' he said. ``The next time I go, I'll be
working.''

BRADLEY: COUNTERATTACK BEGINS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES _ Facing his first loss in 22 years in politics, Bill
Bradley said he will exploit the lessons of the Iowa caucuses to
strike back at Vice President Al Gore in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who was hurt in Iowa by failing to respond aggressively
to Gore ads that Bradley considered distortions, said in an
interview that he will begin the counterattack in New Hampshire &UR; . &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever a misrepresentation is offered, it has to be
corrected,'' Bradley said. ``That is one thing I always knew, but I
certainly know now, based on experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's momentum in Iowa stalled soon after Gore started
running ads criticizing Bradley's position on a 1993 flood relief
vote and the possible impact of Bradley's health-care plan on
Medicaid patients, both because of fallout from the ads and
subsequent disclosures about his heart condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on the two misleading ads, we have to realize that
ultimately we need to point that out in ways that reach the
majority of people,'' Bradley said in the interview, referring to a
new ad campaign featuring Niki Tsongas, widow of Massachusetts
Senator Paul Tsongas. ``That's what we're trying to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, Bradley's team tried to portray his results in Iowa
as a victory. Arguing that Bradley was challenging an incumbent
vice president who had spent three years locking up the political
establishment, from elected officials to labor leaders, they said
Bradley's ability to show any level of organized strength was a
vital first step in a long journey.
</P>
<P>
   ``We showed people we could build an organization outside the
traditional apparatus, and that's an important signal as we head
into New Hampshire,'' said Anita Dunn, Bradley's comunications
director.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley faces similar opposition from New Hampshire's Democratic
establishment, led by Governor Jeanne Shaheen and many of the
state's labor leaders, who are backing Gore. And Gore has pulled
ahead in the New Hampshire polls, erasing a lead that Bradley had
held for several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Bradley leaves Iowa with nearly as much money as Gore to
spend on a national campaign. And Bradley enjoys far greater name
recognition in New Hampshire than he did in Iowa, largely because
of his decade as a Hall of Fame basketball player for the New York
Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   He said he feels more comfortable campaigning in the Granite
State, despite his recent dip in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more people from New York, New Jersey and
Massachusetts, and they know me better,'' he said. ``It's a smaller
state, fewer media markets and a shorter distance between places.
New Hampshire remains very important to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was thrown badly off stride last week by disclosures
that he experienced four additional abnormal heart rhythms that
prompted him to seek hospital treatment in December. Doctors have
described his condition as atrial fibrillation, a condition had by
about 2 million Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Yet questions about the condition dogged Bradley for several
days, and it remains unclear if last week's disclosures will have
any impact in New Hampshire. Bradley said he has no plans to
address the issue in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no problem,'' he said. ``From my perspective, it's a
nuisance, and that's all. All the doctors concur, so I'll just move
on from here.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley recovered from his slump in Iowa to attract large,
enthusiastic crowds in his last two days in the state. He finished
campaigning there Monday with an appearance at Iowa State
University, accompanied by Senators Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and Paul
D. Wellstone of Minnesota, and Harvard professor Cornel West.
</P>
<P>
   After speaking to supporters in Des Moines, Bradley was
scheduled to fly to New Hampshire and begin the final sprint to the
Feb. 1 primary with a speech Tuesday morning in Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   He said he will continue to promote his agenda of overhauling
the health care system, eliminating child poverty, requiring all
handguns to be licensed and registered, and achieving racial unity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to run a campaing that isn't politics as usual,''
he said. ``I'm trying to give people something to vote for, as
opposed to trashing my opponent.''
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving Des Moines, Bradley's staff addressed criticism
that they should have devoted fewer resources to Iowa, as Senator
John McCain did by focusing on New Hampshire in the Republican
primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was important to show that this is a national candidacy,''
Dunn said. ``If you really respect the voters, you just can't
respect the voters in parts of the country where you think you are
going to do well.''

LATEST CONCERN FOR FLIERS: BAD WEATHER ON THE SUN  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 30) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af) 
By MATTHEW L. WALD  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Forget the recent wild storms in Europe; scientists
say that another kind of weather is about to turn bad, the weather
in space, which can produce a variety of effects on earth,
including radiation doses for people on jets.
</P>
<P>
   The doses are not an issue for occasional travelers or even
those who fly fairly regularly, but are of some concern for flight
crews, passengers who fly dozens of times a year and for pregnant
women, radiation experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Just how much they are at risk is not certain, but beginning in
May, by order of the European Union, European airlines will begin
treating their flight crews as radiation workers, teaching them
about the effects of low-level radiation doses _ which are believed
to increase the risk of cancer and of birth defects _ and
monitoring their exposures. Some airlines will automatically ground
flight crew members who say they are pregnant. For now, no American
carriers are doing so.
</P>
<P>
   The sun produces storms on its surface in 11-year cycles. In the
next year or so, according to physicists, solar activity will peak,
with an increase in sunspots and solar flares, during which the sun
throws off vastly increased numbers of subatomic particles. This
activity may become obvious to the general public through
electrical blackouts and disruptions in radio broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   Solar peaks have been observed for over 200 years _ in fact,
scientists refer to this as Cycle 23, because it is the 23rd time
the 11-year event has been measured. Until the mid-1900s, the solar
maximum, as the peak activity period is known, was mostly a
scientific curiosity, since the earth's atmosphere and magnetic
field shield the surface from most of the radiation. But it has
become more significant in the last few decades, as people have
built machines that are vulnerable to radiation, including big
electric power grids, communications satellites and jet planes.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for people on planes is that at high altitudes,
there is less atmosphere to shield them. And the particles from the
sun are directed by the earth's magnetic field toward the poles,
and most airliners go close to the North Pole to take the shortest
route between cities like New York and London, or Los Angeles and
Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doses are fairly trivial for an ordinary flight, even for
a pregnant person,'' said Dr. Robert J. Barish, a medical radiation
specialist and author of the 1996 book ``The Invisible Passenger,
Radiation Risks for People Who Fly,'' (Advanced Medical Publishing,
Madison, Wis, 1996). But in an extreme solar event, he said, the
dose could become 5,000 times larger. And for people who fly for a
living, he said, doses are ``up there with the guys crawling around
the reactors.''
</P>
<P>
   Many experts dispute the effects of radiation in planes. Dr.
Michael Bagshaw, the medical director of British Airways and the
chairman of a European Union committee on in-flight radiation, said
in a notice to his airline's staff that members of British Airways
cabin crews live ``on average up to five years longer than a
comparable nonflying population.'' He added that risks from
radiation doses to unborn children are minimal when compared with
other risks during pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   But to comply with European Union regulations, British Airways
is immediately assigning employees who say they are pregnant to
nonflying duties.
</P>
<P>
   According to Bagshaw, the doses aboard the Concorde are twice as
large per hour than on other commercial aircraft, because it flies
higher, but the Concorde's speed cuts the period of exposure in
half. For most passengers, there is little reason for concern. It
would take 100 hours on the Concorde or 200 hours on subsonic jets
a year to reach the exposure limit set by international authorities
for members of the public, Bagshaw said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   But the limit for business travelers, he contends, should be
much higher _ the same as for nuclear-plant workers and flight
crews _ because their exposures are an essential part of their job.
The limit for nuclear-plant workers, he said, amounts to 3,600
hours of flying _ or 41 percent of the hours in a year.
</P>
<P>
   Barish, who was a professor of radiology at New York University
Medical School from 1976 to 1991, then chief radiotherapy physicist
at the Cancer Institute of Catholic Medical Centers of Brooklyn and
Queens, takes a more concerned view of the health risks, but
focuses on another point: the inconsistency of regulations among
industries and govenment agencies. Although the Federal Aviation
Administration recommended it in 1994, he said, American airlines
do not train their flight crews in radiation issues or monitor
their doses.
</P>
<P>
   Since the last solar maximum, observation of the Sun by
satellites has improved. The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric
Administration, a part of the Department of Commerce, publishes
updates on solar conditions at www.noaa.gov (follow the link for
space weather).
</P>
<P>
   Barish, who campaigned unsuccessfully during the last solar
maximum to have planes stay on the ground or fly at lower altitudes
during solar events, has set up an automated telephone service that
advises travelers, for a fee of $3, on radiation levels and
sometimes, whether to consider delaying a trip. The number is (877)
786-3527.

<P>
   THE REPUBLICANS  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   IN OTHER WORDS: Gov. George W. Bush of Texas is expected soon to
begin broadcasting Spanish-language television advertisements in
Arizona, home turf of his chief rival, Sen. John McCain of Arizona.
Bush speaks Spanish, televised Spanish advertisements when he was
running for governor and during the current campaign has used
Spanish advertisements in Spanish-language newspapers and on
Spanish-language radio stations in Iowa and New Hampshire. But the
new advertisements are believed to be the first televised in
Spanish in a Republican presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   THE POLLS  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SOME MORE FRONT-RUNNING: Bush and Vice President Al Gore are
well ahead of their rivals in Illinois and Ohio, two recent polls
have found. An Ohio Poll survey conducted from Monday to Wednesday
of last week and a Market Shares Corp. survey in Illinois, whose
results were also issued last week, found that each man had the
support of more than 50 percent of his party's registered voters.
</P>
<P>
   THE SOUTHWEST  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SERVING UP POLITICS: Former Gov. Fife Symington of Arizona is
working in a restaurant kitchen in Scottsdale and has a semiregular
radio show with cooking lessons and political commentary. He was
forced to resign the governorship two years ago after being
convicted on federal bank- and wire-fraud charges stemming from his
days as a developer. An appeals court overturned the conviction
last year.
</P>
<P>
   THE MIDWEST  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   IT'S MARGARET, MISTER: The only woman in the Republican field in
Illinois' 10th Congressional District, outside Chicago, is hoping
that tweaking her name will help her stand out among the 10 men in
the race. The candidate, Shawn Donnelley, won a small victory last
week when election officials ruled that despite some inconsistency
in her election filings, she could use her middle name, Margaret,
along with her first on the ballot for the March 21 primary. The
winner will run for the seat being left vacant by Rep. John Edward
Porter, a Republican who will retire this year after two decades in
the House.

TSONGAS' WIDOW ACCUSES GORE OF NEGATIVE ADVERTISING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The widow of Senator Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts is
accusing Vice President Al Gore of using the sort of negative
advertising that she alleged helped destroy Tsongas' presidential
hopes in the 1992 election.
</P>
<P>
   In a political ad paid for by the campaign of former Senator
Bill Bradley and scheduled to begin airing on New England
television Tuesday, Niki Tsongas, a cochairman of the Bradley
campaign in Massachusetts, says:
</P>
<P>
   ``Like my husband Paul, Bill Bradley is a passionate supporter
of working people, and he too is challenging us with bold vision
for America. But what disappoints me now is _ just as with Paul _
Bill's record is being distorted.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Tsongas won the New Hampshire primary in 1992 with 34
percent of the vote, but his campaign never recovered from attacks
launched on him by Bill Clinton during the subsequent Florida
primary, where the Clinton camp accused him of wanting to undercut
Social Security and of not supporting Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Without naming Bradley, Gore's advertising says the vice
president is ``the only Democratic candidate who saves Medicare . .
. the only Democratic candidate who preserves Medicaid . . . the
only Democratic candidate who reforms health care in a way that
protects seniors and working families.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Niki Tsongas, now director of external
affairs at Middlesex Community College, said: ``Social Security and
health care are complicated issues. They require careful
consideration by the American people. . . . If you scare people, it
makes the problems much harder to solve. It's trading short-term
advantage for long-term disadvantage to the public interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Tsongas said the suggestions that Bradley would damage or
destroy Medicare and Medicaid were deep distortions of Bradley's
proposals and were aimed at keeping the public from being able to
evaluate calmly the specifics of the candidates' proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have great respect for the ability of the people of New
Hampshire and the American people to take issues seriously and try
to reason them through,'' she said. To block that by scaring
people, she said, ``undermines the presidency and those who seek
it. Those who seek that office should treat it with a little more
honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Lehane, Gore's press secretary, said that if Gore ``sees
an idea or policy proposal that will hurt working families _ such
as not supporting Medicare or getting rid of Medicaid or not
putting forth a national education plan _ he will speak out against
those ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehane added, ``This is a campaign for president of the United
States. It is not about shooting free throws.''
</P>
<P>
   Niki Tsongas said Monday that the Bradley campaign contacted her
Saturday about making the ad, which was filmed Sunday at her home
in Lowell. She said several versions were filmed, and she had not
yet seen the final product. They all had about the same content,
and none named Gore, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Kanin, a Bradley supporter who was Paul Tsongas's
campaign manager in 1992, said in a telephone interview that both
the technique and the motive of Clinton in '92 and Gore now were
identical.
</P>
<P>
   ``They characterize people with bold vision as risks to the
American people,'' Kanin said. ``The motive is winning _ winning at
any cost. Bill Clinton and Al Gore are not the only people in
politics who practice this, but it is unfortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   Kanin said that if Gore debated health care issues without
distorting Bradley's proposals, the vice president's critique would
lack credibility, and it would be clear to the public that
Bradley's motivation was to strengthen the system.

MEXICAN RETAIL CONGLOMERATE BUYING REST OF COMPUSA 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ A retail group controlled by the Mexican
billionaire Carlos Slim Helu announced Monday that it is buying
CompUSA Inc., the biggest chain of personal computer stores in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   His leap into U.S. retailing marked one of the biggest Mexican
purchases of a prominent U.S. business. It also is part of Slim's
drive to transform Telefonos de Mexico, the formerly state-owned
phone company that is controlled by Slim and is his flagship
business, into a fast-paced, web-savvy multinational giant.
</P>
<P>
   Grupo Sanborn's SA, Slim's retailing chain, already owned about
14.8 percent of the common shares in CompUSA, the Dallas-based
network of computer stores that has been struggling with losses and
declining sales. Grupo Sanborn said it would purchase the rest for
$797.7 million or $10.10 a share, about 50 percent more than the
Friday closing price.
</P>
<P>
   CompUSA shares surged 40 percent on the news to close at $9.50
but remain far below the price of a few years ago, before the
company began to feel the pain of competition from direct sellers
of personal computers and from other retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year CompUSA announced that it would eliminate 1,500
jobs or nearly 7 percent of its work force as part of a turnaround
strategy. It remained unclear Monday whether Grupo Sanborn's
takeover of CompUSA would lead to more job cuts.
</P>
<P>
   If Slim is right about CompUSA's potential, the deal would mark
another victory in his record for picking a bargain. It also
represents a test of his skill in extending the potential of
Telefonos de Mexico, or Telmex, which he bought in the early '90s
when it carried the legacy of a lumbering state monopoly. Slim's
strategy has been to acquire both latest-model telecommunications
technology and retail outlets to make that technology available to
everyday consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The move was also consistent with Slim's bid to dig into the
huge Spanish-speaking telecommunications markets in the United
States. In addition to selling personal computers, CompUSA has been
expanding services to teach consumers how to use them and to
explore the Internet, with an emphasis on drawing customers from
American minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that his strategy is to make Telmex into an
enormous global communications network, rather than just a national
phone company,'' said Geoffrey Dennis, director of Latin American
equity research at Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Slim, 59, originally built both his reputation and fortune in
turning around sagging retail companies in Mexico. The cornerstone
of Grupo Sanborn's is a string of old-style soda shop restaurants
that are a cherished feature of a Mexican family's Sunday
afternoon. But under Slim's management Sanborn's has become
Mexico's leading electronic commerce company.
</P>
<P>
   The success of Slim in running cost-efficient companies at home
has emboldened him to try the novel concept of bringing
Mexican-style retailing to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of experience from the many years we have been
in the retail business and the wide variety of businesses we have
run,'' said Carlos Slim Domit, Slim's 32-year old son who is the
head of Grupo Sanborn's.
</P>
<P>
   Slim Domit said he will focus on building CompUSA's sales
through electronic commerce. He cited the advantage of having 217
giant stores in 84 cities across the United States for filling
orders quickly and aiding customers who feel overwhelmed by
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Grupo Sanborn said that CompUSA will ally with Telmex, Microsoft
Corp., SBC Communications, the Southwest telephone company, and
Prodigy Communications Corp., the American Internet provider that
Slim owns.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, Telmex announced a venture with Microsoft to
create a Spanish-speaking Internet gateway for Latin America,
building on Slim's experience with Prodigy.

 &HT;    EDs: rewrites top to update with grandmothers leaving Miami
without seeing Elian ...
 &HT;    ELIAN'S GRANDMOTHER FLY TO MIAMI, REUNION UNCERTAIN
 &HT;    (900&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    With Photos.
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By MIKE WILLIAMS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ After 60 days of posturing and rhetoric, the power of a
grandmother's love brought Elian Gonzalez achingly close to a
reunion with his Cuban family.
</P>
<P>
   But then fear overwhelmed that love.
</P>
<P>
   In yet another bizarre twist, the two Cuban grandmothers of the
boy at the center of an international tug-of-war flew from New York
to Miami on Monday. However, they stopped short of driving to the
Little Havana home where the boy has been living with his Miami
relatives since he was found floating in an inner tube off Fort
Lauderdale on Thanksgiving Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were not confident of the security arrangements,
particularly when we found out the family wanted to make this a
circus,'' said Bob Edgar, general secretary of the National Council
of Churches, which arranged the grandmothers' trip to the United
States. ``The grandmothers felt that if they could not effect a
meeting tonight in a neutral place, then they were safer returning
to Washington D.C.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, after touching down at Tamiami Airport about 4 p.m. EST,
the women's chartered jet took off again about 8:30 p.m. EST,
headed for Washington. They were to meet Tuesday with Congressional
representatives who are sympathetic to sending the boy back to
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the first day of the new congressional session,
Florida Republican Sen. Connie Mack introduced a bill to give Elian
U.S. citizenship, which would free him from INS jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of the bill is to move the decision-making about
the boy from out of the hands of the (Immigration and
Naturalization Service) and into the hands of the court,'' said
Mack, whose bill was one of three filed in both the House and
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami developments outraged Elian's relatives here, who were
on their way to the airport to negotiate with the grandmothers when
the jet took off.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a travesty,'' said Spencer Eig, one of the family's
attorneys. ``To add insult to injury ... as we were coming to the
airport, these poor women were hustled onto a plane that took
off.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Elian, it was unclear how or when he heard the news that
his beloved grandmothers _ one of whom took a major role in raising
him _ were only 15 miles away, but departed without seeing him. The
boy's Miami relatives had told Elian that his grandmothers were
coming to see him.
</P>
<P>
   It was yet another sad chapter in a case that has seen the
passion of politics overwhelm blood ties.
</P>
<P>
   While Edgar remained in Miami to be available for negotiations
with the family for a possible reunion in the coming days, the
Miami family was clearly stung badly by the developments.
</P>
<P>
   The grandmothers _ Raquel Rodriguez and Mariela Quintana _ were
reportedly afraid of going to the Little Havana house, which was
surrounded by dozens of journalists and hundreds of Cuban exiles.
In the past, the exiles have vowed to form a human chain around the
boy to keep him from returning to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday their leaders promised that the women would be met
with a warm reception. As word filtered out that the grandmothers
were headed to Miami, a crowd began gathering in the street outside
the home, and exile leaders exhorted them to be on their best
behavior. They handed out carnations and other flowers for them to
wave as the women arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to show the world that we are a community that can
show love and respect and that we aren't violent like Fidel Castro
says we are,'' said Ramon Saul Sanchez, leader of the anti-Castro
Democracy Movement. ``Wave your flowers when they arrive, don't
throw them. And remain silent.''
</P>
<P>
   But the moment never came.
</P>
<P>
   And as the grandmothers jetted away into the cool Miami night,
it was unclear whether the stalemate would ever be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Monday's bizarre events, both sides of the family
had been critical of the other in comments to the media.
</P>
<P>
   The grandmothers have said the Miami family is controlled by
Miami's exile extremists and that they are cashing in on the boy's
celebrity. Elian's Miami relatives have said the grandmothers are
controlled by Cuban dictator Fidel Castro and that they haven't
shown remorse for the boy's mother, who drowned on the crossing
from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The grandmothers _ here representing Elian's father, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez _ arrived in the United States from Cuba on Friday, flying
to New York as the guest of the National Council of Churches, which
favors returning the boy to Cuba. They met in Washington with U.S.
Attorney Janet Reno Saturday, making a tearful plea to at least see
their grandson, if not take him home to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Although both sides of the family told media over the weekend
that they had not communicated, Reno apparently got in touch with
the Miami family's attorneys and brokered the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear what bearing the reunion might have on other
facets of the case. The Miami family's lawsuit to keep the boy here
was expected to move forward this week, with government lawyers
filing a response to the family's complaint. U.S. District Judge
William Hoeveler is expected to schedule a hearing on the matter
once he receives the government response.
</P>
<P>
   Also undaunted, members of Congress took up Elian's case Monday,
all in an effort to block efforts by the INS to return the boy to
his father in Cuba prior to a state court hearing pitting his
relatives in Cuba and Miami in a custody battle.
</P>
<P>
   Mack said ``neither the president of the United States, his
attorney general, nor the dictator ruling Cuba are qualified to
decide the fate of this little boy.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., who filed a companion to Mack's bill
along with Reps. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Lincoln Diaz-Balart _ both
Miami Republicans born in Cuba _ said ``the best interest of Elian
must be our top priority. Any decision made by a governmental
agency is contrary to his best interest and clearly against his
mother's desires. While this legislation does not dictate an
outcome, it ensures that the rule of law is applied, upheld, and
enforced.''
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said President Clinton is
concerned that congressional action may become ``a political
debate, rather than the substantive debate that it should be,'' but
he added that ``if they pass something, obviously, we'll take a
look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Mack noted his bill was being sponsored by three Republicans and
three Democrats, including _ Bob Graham, Florida's senior senator.
</P>
<P>
   Graham said he supported the bill because the INS decision that
only Elian's father could speak for him was unfair to the boy and
others like him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It denies them the opportunity to have their options weighed
by an experienced child custody jurist using the standard of 'what
is in the best interest of the child.' `` he said.
</P>
<P>
   The competing House bills offer young Elian either U.S.
citizenship or permanent residency status by waiving numerous
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   The residency bill filed by Rep. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., with
support from Reps. Peter Deutsch, D-Fla., and Patrick Kennedy,
D-R.I., would waive a provision in immigration law that would
cancel Elian's permanent residency status if he returned to Cuba
for more than six months.
</P>
<P>
   Menendez said his bill would avoid questions about granting
citizenship to a person who had not requested it. A Menendez
spokesman said that if the competing citizenship bill appeared to
have enough support to pass the House, Menendez would support it.

TICKETMASTER TO PERMIT PRINTING OF TICKETS AT HOME
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a plan that at first blush sounds like a scalper's
dream, Ticketmaster-Online CitySearch Inc. said on Monday that
starting in April, it would allow customers to print tickets to
events directly from their computer printers.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Stockham, executive vice president of Ticketmaster-Online
CitySearch, said consumers would need no additional software or
hardware for the service.
</P>
<P>
   ``All they need is a printer with 300 dpi or better,'' Stockham
said.
</P>
<P>
   A resolution of 300 dpi, or dots-per-inch, is common to all but
the very oldest dot-matrix printers, he said. The more dots a
printer can squeeze into an inch, the less jagged and more readable
are printed text and graphics. Laser printers and ink-jet printers
typically have resolutions of 600 dpi or more, but none have less
than 300.
</P>
<P>
   And scalpers need not salivate. Stockham said the tickets, which
will print out on a standard-size sheet of paper, would include a
bar code to insure that only one person would occupy a given seat.
Once that ticket was scanned at the gate, no one with a ticket
bearing the same bar code would be allowed to enter.
</P>
<P>
   Ticketmaster said the system would spare consumers delivery
charges and give them a respite from lines at will-call windows. In
addition, customers will receive coupons for local restaurants or
parking, as well as directions to the event.
</P>
<P>
   Stockham said that events wishing to accept the tickets will
have to be equipped with bar-code scanners _ machines that are not
yet in use even at all large arenas. The company has not yet
determined the extent to which it would help venues pay for such
equipment, Stockham said. He said he did not know what percentage
of Ticketmaster affiliates already had bar-code scanners.
</P>
<P>
   But David Card, an analyst with Jupiter Communications, an
Internet consulting firm, said venues ``won't put in bar-code
readers unless Ticketmaster funds them or a lot of people want to
do it, and I just don't see a lot of people wanting to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Whoever pays for them, Stockham said the bar-code scanners would
``not require a massive incremental capital investment,'' since
they cost about $100 each, and the ticket databases they would
integrate with are already in place at each venue.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he said, the new system might play to the advantage
of smaller venues that would require only one or two scanners,
``but there are a lot of incentives for Madison Square Garden to do
it, too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People do get nervous about not having the physical tickets,
as with electronic tickets for airlines, but that's a hump people
are getting over,'' Card said. ``It'll be useful for kids, or
people with no ID's or credit cards'' who cannot pick up tickets at
the will-call window, Card added, ``and it might help me avoid the
will-call window, but that's not a huge deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Stockham declined to forecast what revenue might be realized
from offering discounts to places like hotels, restaurants and
parking lots.

 &HT;    EDs: rewrites top to update with grandmothers leaving Miami
without seeing Elian ...
 &HT;    ELIAN'S GRANDMOTHER FLY TO MIAMI, REUNION UNCERTAIN
 &HT;    (900&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    With Photos.
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By MIKE WILLIAMS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ After 60 days of posturing and rhetoric, the power of a
grandmother's love brought Elian Gonzalez achingly close to a
reunion with his Cuban family.
</P>
<P>
   But then fear overwhelmed that love.
</P>
<P>
   In yet another bizarre twist, the two Cuban grandmothers of the
boy at the center of an international tug-of-war flew from New York
to Miami on Monday. However, they stopped short of driving to the
Little Havana home where the boy has been living with his Miami
relatives since he was found floating in an inner tube off Fort
Lauderdale on Thanksgiving Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were not confident of the security arrangements,
particularly when we found out the family wanted to make this a
circus,'' said Bob Edgar, general secretary of the National Council
of Churches, which arranged the grandmothers' trip to the United
States. ``The grandmothers felt that if they could not effect a
meeting tonight in a neutral place, then they were safer returning
to Washington D.C.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, after touching down at Tamiami Airport about 4 p.m. EST,
the women's chartered jet took off again about 8:30 p.m. EST,
headed for Washington. They were to meet Tuesday with Congressional
representatives who are sympathetic to sending the boy back to
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the first day of the new congressional session,
Florida Republican Sen. Connie Mack introduced a bill to give Elian
U.S. citizenship, which would free him from INS jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of the bill is to move the decision-making about
the boy from out of the hands of the (Immigration and
Naturalization Service) and into the hands of the court,'' said
Mack, whose bill was one of three filed in both the House and
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami developments outraged Elian's relatives here, who were
on their way to the airport to negotiate with the grandmothers when
the jet took off.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a travesty,'' said Spencer Eig, one of the family's
attorneys. ``To add insult to injury ... as we were coming to the
airport, these poor women were hustled onto a plane that took
off.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Elian, it was unclear how or when he heard the news that
his beloved grandmothers _ one of whom took a major role in raising
him _ were only 15 miles away, but departed without seeing him. The
boy's Miami relatives had told Elian that his grandmothers were
coming to see him.
</P>
<P>
   It was yet another sad chapter in a case that has seen the
passion of politics overwhelm blood ties.
</P>
<P>
   While Edgar remained in Miami to be available for negotiations
with the family for a possible reunion in the coming days, the
Miami family was clearly stung badly by the developments.
</P>
<P>
   The grandmothers _ Raquel Rodriguez and Mariela Quintana _ were
reportedly afraid of going to the Little Havana house, which was
surrounded by dozens of journalists and hundreds of Cuban exiles.
In the past, the exiles have vowed to form a human chain around the
boy to keep him from returning to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday their leaders promised that the women would be met
with a warm reception. As word filtered out that the grandmothers
were headed to Miami, a crowd began gathering in the street outside
the home, and exile leaders exhorted them to be on their best
behavior. They handed out carnations and other flowers for them to
wave as the women arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to show the world that we are a community that can
show love and respect and that we aren't violent like Fidel Castro
says we are,'' said Ramon Saul Sanchez, leader of the anti-Castro
Democracy Movement. ``Wave your flowers when they arrive, don't
throw them. And remain silent.''
</P>
<P>
   But the moment never came.
</P>
<P>
   And as the grandmothers jetted away into the cool Miami night,
it was unclear whether the stalemate would ever be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Monday's bizarre events, both sides of the family
had been critical of the other in comments to the media.
</P>
<P>
   The grandmothers have said the Miami family is controlled by
Miami's exile extremists and that they are cashing in on the boy's
celebrity. Elian's Miami relatives have said the grandmothers are
controlled by Cuban dictator Fidel Castro and that they haven't
shown remorse for the boy's mother, who drowned on the crossing
from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The grandmothers _ here representing Elian's father, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez _ arrived in the United States from Cuba on Friday, flying
to New York as the guest of the National Council of Churches, which
favors returning the boy to Cuba. They met in Washington with U.S.
Attorney Janet Reno Saturday, making a tearful plea to at least see
their grandson, if not take him home to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Although both sides of the family told media over the weekend
that they had not communicated, Reno apparently got in touch with
the Miami family's attorneys and brokered the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear what bearing the reunion might have on other
facets of the case. The Miami family's lawsuit to keep the boy here
was expected to move forward this week, with government lawyers
filing a response to the family's complaint. U.S. District Judge
William Hoeveler is expected to schedule a hearing on the matter
once he receives the government response.
</P>
<P>
   Also undaunted, members of Congress took up Elian's case Monday,
all in an effort to block efforts by the INS to return the boy to
his father in Cuba prior to a state court hearing pitting his
relatives in Cuba and Miami in a custody battle.
</P>
<P>
   Mack said ``neither the president of the United States, his
attorney general, nor the dictator ruling Cuba are qualified to
decide the fate of this little boy.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., who filed a companion to Mack's bill
along with Reps. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Lincoln Diaz-Balart _ both
Miami Republicans born in Cuba _ said ``the best interest of Elian
must be our top priority. Any decision made by a governmental
agency is contrary to his best interest and clearly against his
mother's desires. While this legislation does not dictate an
outcome, it ensures that the rule of law is applied, upheld, and
enforced.''
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said President Clinton is
concerned that congressional action may become ``a political
debate, rather than the substantive debate that it should be,'' but
he added that ``if they pass something, obviously, we'll take a
look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Mack noted his bill was being sponsored by three Republicans and
three Democrats, including _ Bob Graham, Florida's senior senator.
</P>
<P>
   Graham said he supported the bill because the INS decision that
only Elian's father could speak for him was unfair to the boy and
others like him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It denies them the opportunity to have their options weighed
by an experienced child custody jurist using the standard of 'what
is in the best interest of the child.' `` he said.
</P>
<P>
   The competing House bills offer young Elian either U.S.
citizenship or permanent residency status by waiving numerous
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   The residency bill filed by Rep. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., with
support from Reps. Peter Deutsch, D-Fla., and Patrick Kennedy,
D-R.I., would waive a provision in immigration law that would
cancel Elian's permanent residency status if he returned to Cuba
for more than six months.
</P>
<P>
   Menendez said his bill would avoid questions about granting
citizenship to a person who had not requested it. A Menendez
spokesman said that if the competing citizenship bill appeared to
have enough support to pass the House, Menendez would support it.

(mk) 
 By LAURA M. HOLSON and MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble, the consumer products giant that makes Crest
toothpaste and Tide detergent, ended merger talks Monday with drug
concerns Warner-Lambert and American Home Products after investors
panned the combination and Procter suffered its worst stock price
decline since the market crash of 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation about a combination of the three companies surfaced
last Wednesday when it was reported that they were in merger
discussions. But as the prospects for a deal became more promising,
jittery investors feared that Procter's earnings would suffer
because of it. As a result, Procter's management was pressured
either to call off the talks or watch its stock tumble for a fourth
consecutive day.
</P>
<P>
   When one adviser was asked about what killed the talks, he did
not offer the usual explanations like price or executives' clashing
egos. It was much simpler: ``The stock market opened,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And so, with a vengeance. Procter's stock plummeted from the
start, hitting a low of $94.8125 by midmorning Monday, down 8.2
percent from Friday's close and 19 percent since last week. But by
11:45 a.m. word began to spread on Wall Street that Procter &AMP;
Gamble was calling off talks. Investors cheered and the company's
stock price shot up almost 15 percent from the day's low to
$108.875, before closing at $102.875, down 37.5 cents.
</P>
<P>
   In a terse statement, Durk I. Jager, Procter &AMP; Gamble's chief
executive, said the three companies ``could have been a blockbuster
combination of technology, marketing and scale capabilities.'' But
``we have concluded that leaks and resulting speculation on a
possible transaction have created an environment in which we cannot
continue meaningful discussions.''
</P>
<P>
   American Home, the maker of Advil and Robitussin, and
Warner-Lambert, which is best known for Schick razors and its
cholesterol-reducing drug Lipitor, announced last November that
they would combine in a stock deal now valued at $56.4 billion. But
that deal was thrown into immediate uncertainty when drug company
Pfizer Inc. made a hostile bid worth $76.4 billion for Warner
Lambert.
</P>
<P>
   With Pfizer's bid more attractive, Warner acknowledged that it
would pursue talks with the company. At the same time it began
seeking a white knight, including Procter &AMP; Gamble.
</P>
<P>
   People close to Jager said it was not too surprising that he
would cancel talks after his company lost more than $20 billion in
market value in less than a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jager is an aggressive guy, but nothing in his mind is worth
watching the stock fall,'' said one person who talked with Procter
&AMP; Gamble officials over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But even the officials acknowledge that Jager, a tough-minded
executive, underestimated just how much Procter's investors would
punish his move to turn one of the world's largest consumer
products companies into a pharmaceutical concern. ``He thought he
was immune to all of this,'' said one person involved in the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Procter is extremely secretive and executives were stunned that
news of the talks became public and caused a revolt among
shareholders. The company isn't the quickest of deal-makers either,
a particular disadvantage in these times when mergers are
negotiated in days instead of months. Last August, for instance,
Jager suggested that Procter was becoming more savvy, boasting that
it took the company only two months to negotiate the $2.3 billion
acquisition of Iams Co., the premier pet food maker. ``In our old
structure, an idea like this would have been much more difficult to
bring to life,'' he said. That deal was a fraction of the $142
billion merger that was attempted now.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the companies involved seemed caught off guard by
Procter's actions. Even as late as Sunday night, executives at
Warner-Lambert and American Home were confident that merger
discussions would proceed, especially after Procter's board gave
management the green light last Friday. Executives from the Pfizer
camp, who have been extremely confident that they would prevail,
also were worried that a deal was in the offing.
</P>
<P>
   Procter's announcement put Warner-Lambert in the same spot it
was in a week ago _ seeking another suitor or forced into the arms
of a partner it is less than thrilled with. Neil B. Sweig, a
pharmaceutical company analyst at Ryan, Beck &AMP; Co., said that he
believed that Pfizer, which makes Viagra, would now push to
complete a deal quickly with Warner-Lambert. Pfizer could sweeten
its offer, but not as much as it would have paid in a bidding war
with Procter. And now that Procter has backed away, he said, it is
less likely that another company will step in and try to outbid
Pfizer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Warner-Lambert has put up a great fight,'' Sweig said. ``But
it will still be Pfizer that owns Warner-Lambert.''
</P>
<P>
   With Procter gone as a potential suitor, American Home becomes
the target of other bidders too, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   American Home makes an attractive partner, said analysts,
because of promising new drugs it has just begun to sell or will be
selling soon. But a cloud hangs over the company because of
thousands of pending lawsuits filed by people who said they were
harmed by taking fen-phen, the diet drug combination that the
company marketed.
</P>
<P>
   American Home also stands to get about $2 billion from Pfizer or
any other company that emerges to break up its initial deal to
merge with Warner-Lambert.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Home is sitting there, waiting to collect,'' Sergio
Traversa, a pharmaceuticals analyst at Mehta Partners, said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, American Home failed to complete two other proposed
mergers, first with SmithKline Beecham and later with Monsanto. But
analysts said that American Home's almost certain failure to merge
with Warner-Lambert cannot be compared with the two unsuccessful
attempts.
</P>
<P>
   The earlier proposed marriages fell apart largely because the
companies' chief executives could not agree on who would run the
new combination. But John R. Stafford, the chairman of American
Home, has now made it known that he is willing to give up some
power.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell B. Weiner, a spokesman for American Home, said that he
could not comment on any of the speculation about the company's
future. ``We still have a deal,'' he said. ``Our business remains a
solid pharmaceutical business and we look forward to introducing
our rich pipeline of products.''

<P>
   Q. Is there a Web site that calculates one's frequent flier
miles on various airlines, or at least gives a formula for doing
so? _ Joan Gross, New York, N.Y. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Among the companies that provide the service you're looking
for are MaxMiles and Biztravel.com. Each can be reached directly at
its own home page _ www.maxmiles.com or biztravel.com _ or through
links on other sites.
</P>
<P>
   You will very likely find MaxMiles the more convenient of the
two since it tracks miles and expiration dates, if any, for 32
programs regardless of where you booked your flight, hotel stay or
car rental. In addition, mileage reports are available on
designated Web sites and by e-mail as well.
</P>
<P>
   Biztravel.com, which is a travel agency, tracks miles for six
frequent-traveler programs _ British Airways Executive Club,
Northwest WorldPerks, TWA Aviators, Midwest Express, Starwood
Preferred Guest and Hilton HHonors. Beyond that, Biztravel.com
compiles information only for travel it has arranged on any of
40-plus frequent-traveler programs. A log of accumulated miles is
free on its Web site and affiliated sites, but there are no e-mail
mileage reports.
</P>
<P>
   How much subscribers pay for information compiled by MaxMiles
varies. It depends on which of many sites they signed up with. But
cost does not necessarily reflect how much information is provided.
</P>
<P>
   For example, by logging on to a personalized www.excite.com home
page, a subscriber can get mileage totals for each program free.
For a more complete report _ showing individual transactions,
expiration dates, mileage and special deals _ there is a charge:
$2.95 a month or $29.95 a year. Under this arrangement, subscribers
get reports on the Web and by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   If one joins through www.expedia.com, the first year is free.
After that, it's $9.99 a year, which provides a full statement
online and e-mailed reports. But if three tickets are bought within
a year of enrollment, the charge is waived.
</P>
<P>
   If you are an American Express cardholder, access to the
information gathered by MaxMiles is free as are the mileage reports
found at www.rewardsmanager.com or www.americanexpress.com.
</P>
<P>
   The best deal of all is offered by www.skymalltravel.com:

   Q. Does Malpensa Airport outside Milan offer transportation to
Lake Como, where visitors can board boats and hydrofoils to
Bellagio and other places? Traveling south from Milan and then
heading north to Lake Como seems to be a roundabout and less
appealing route. _ Jerry Kline, Alexandria, Va. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Thanks to bus and train service from Malpensa to Como on Lake
Como, you can be spared the time-consuming route you mention.
Though the scenery may not be breath-taking, it does avoid the trip
back to Milan of 25 miles _ and then doubling back.
</P>
<P>
   Buses as well as trains stop near the Piazza Cavour in Como,
where you can catch a boat or a bus to Bellagio and other stops
along the lake. Lining the shores are grand villas amid luxuriant
gardens alternating with picturesque villages, and in the distance
rise low mountains, green and lush almost all the year round. In
the summer, the lake is awash with flotillas of sailboats.
</P>
<P>
   Trains depart from Malpensa Terminal 1 for Saronno, where
passengers must change, 5 minutes and 35 minutes past the hour. (A
shuttle bus connects Terminals 1 and 2.) From Saronno, trains
usually run twice an hour to Lake Como, a trip that takes 40
minutes. The train fare is $5.25 from Malpensa to Saronno and $2
from Saronno to Como, calculated at 1,911 lire to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   If you prefer the bus from Malpensa to Como, there are
departures daily from Terminal 1, platform 13, in front of exits
3-4 at 9:25 a.m. and 12:15 p.m., and four minutes later from
Terminal 2. Buses also depart every day but Sunday at 11 a.m., 4:25
p.m. and 7:30 p.m. The trip takes an hour and a one-way ticket is
$10.20. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From the city of Como, there are both buses and boats to other
towns on the lake. Buses run hourly, stopping in the towns on the
west shore. From Como to Bellagio takes about 1 hour and 20
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   For sea dogs, or lake dogs in this case, there are both boats
and hydrofoils that stop in most of the villages that dot the lake.
The boats run only during the summer, and the trip from Como to
Bellagio takes two hours; the fare is $5.75.
</P>
<P>
   In winter, it is possible to navigate the lake only by
hydrofoil, and the trip to Bellagio only takes 50 minutes.
Hydrofoils run eight times a day; the fare is $8.40.
</P>
<P>
   The Como tourist board can be reached at (39-031) 3300111 or
(39-031) 269712. &QL;

   Q. We are planning a trip to Argentina in March and want to
visit the large Farm Progress Show supposedly west or northwest of
Buenos Aires. We need the location and dates, but have drawn a
blank. _ K.L.M., South Pasadena, Calif. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. What you may have in mind is a show known as ExpoChacra 2000
to be held from March 16 to 19 at the Estancia San Patricio. The
estancia, or ranch, is on Provincial Route 18, 16 miles from
Rosario in the Province of Santa Fe. From Buenos Aires, there are
both daily flights from Aero-parque Metropolitano Jorge Newbery
($95 round trip) and frequent bus service ($50 round trip). The
flight takes one hour, the bus four. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The show will focus on livestock, crops, machinery, the role of
aviation (in pesticide application and fire protection, for
example) and telecommunications (as in satellite and Internet use).
Admission is $10; the hours are 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. Information:
www.expochacra.com.
</P>
<P>
   Packages for the show are being offered by the Transatlantica
travel agency, based in Rosario. It can arrange for tickets to the
show, lodging in Rosario or Uranga, which is closer to the Estancia
San Patricio, and for transportation. Rates range from $133 to $268
for three nights per person per day, double occupancy. Information:
(54-0341) 424-5013; fax (54-0341) 425-9860; on the Web at
www.transatlantica.com.ar.
</P>
<P>
   Aerolineas Argentinas can be reached at (800) 333-0276, (305)
648-4100 or www.aeroargentinas.com. If you plan to take a bus,
Chevallier is probably the most reliable. It leaves from the main
terminal at Retiro, in downtown Buenos Aires. Departures are hourly
starting at 4:45 p.m. until midnight. Information: (54-11)
4-301-0181.

P&AMP;G LIKELY TO STAY WITH CONSUMER PRODUCTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (With DRUG-MERGER) 
(lb) 
 By DANA CANEDY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After ending merger discussions with Warner-Lambert and American
Home Products, Procter &AMP; Gamble Co. will probably stick to consumer
products rather than court another big pharmaceutical company
anytime soon, investors and stock analysts said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Though investors pushed down the stock price on the possibility
of a drug acquisition, they are bracing for more change. P&AMP;G's
talks with the drug companies signaled a surprising aggressiveness
from its top executive, Durk Jager. Since taking the helm a year
ago, Jager has said he will find ways to grow beyond selling more
diapers, paper towels and other household products. Now investors
seem to believe him.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was historically the ultimate white-shoe firm,'' said Tim
Ghriskey, a senior portfolio manager at Dreyfus Corp., a big P&AMP;G
shareholder. ``P&AMP;G has always tested everything to death before
bringing something new to market, or trying a new commercial or
anything, and he has just cut through that bureaucracy and really
invigorated the company and modernized it, and you have to applaud
that.''
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, the company needs to speed products through
its notoriously sluggish pipeline. ``My guess is we will see very
solid results from the fundamental business over the next 12 to 18
months and see yet another acquisition,'' said Heather Hay, an
analyst with Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Procter may take its time to look for the right fit. Ideal,
industry observers say, would be a business that could benefit from
its marketing expertise and strong distribution channels and add a
high-margin category in which it does not already dominate, like
razors, beverages and foods.
</P>
<P>
   Though there was much speculation Monday about how long it would
take P&AMP;G to find another potential partner, ``there is no rush to
the altar with anyone,'' said Ken Harris, who is a partner with
Cannondale Associates, a consulting firm that advises
consumer-product companies and supermarkets. ``It isn't as though
this is going to derail anything they are doing. In fact many
people believe it was a distraction potentially.''
</P>
<P>
   P&AMP;G management disagreed. ``We believed Warner-Lambert, American
Home Products and Procter &AMP; Gamble could have been a blockbuster
combination in terms of technology, marketing and scale
capabilities,'' Jager said when announcing that talks had ended.
</P>
<P>
   Without a deal to announce, P&AMP;G is expected to emphasize its
progress in reorganizing the company, when it releases quarterly
earnings Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Management will probably accelerate the planned overhaul, in
which it is closing outdated plants, developing seven global
business units to focus on product segments and cutting years off
the time it takes to bring a product to market. The streamlined
process has produced recent hits like Fabreze, which removes odors
from fabrics, and Dryel, a home dry-cleaning kit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We actually felt increasingly confident about P&AMP;G's core
business,'' said Ghriskey. ``They have really invigorated it within
the last year in terms of the speed of product to market. It
surprised us that they felt they had to do a huge deal.''
</P>
<P>
   But P&AMP;G's goal is annual profit increases of 13 percent to 15
percent, a target that would be difficult to reach with its current
group of products, from Crest toothpaste to Tide detergent. The
company's profit has been disappointing recently, falling slightly
last year after a charge.
</P>
<P>
   Acquiring the pharmaceutical companies would have significantly
bolstered revenues, aided in particular by Warner-Lambert's
cholesterol-lowering drug Lipitor. Snapping up the two drug
businesses would have made P&AMP;G No. 2 in U.S. drug sales behind
Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham, which last week announced
intentions to merge.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that P&AMP;G was seriously considering a big acquisition
``is indicative of a company that doesn't feel it can consistently
grow its business in a solid double-digit manner organically,''
said William Steele, an analyst with Banc of America Securities.
</P>
<P>
   P&AMP;G said in a statement, however, ``Even without Warner-Lambert
and American Home Products, we're on track to meet our growth
goals.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The company also defended its decision to take a look at the
drug makers. ``Exploring a potential deal with Warner-Lambert and
American Home Products made sense for several reasons,'' the
company said. In addition to making P&AMP;G a leader in prescription
and over-the-counter drugs, it would have accelerated its growth
rate by one to two percentage points, added to earnings per share
in two years and provided opportunities for growth synergies.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, though, never warmed to the idea of P&AMP;G making such a
huge push into a category it does not know well. P&AMP;G has struggled
with a small drug business of its own for years without a a hit
product. Prescription drugs accounted for less than 1 percent of
revenue in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   P&AMP;G's stock began to tumble last week on the rumor that it was
in talks with Warner-Lambert and American Home. After punishing the
stock, investors eased up on Monday after the company announced
that it had walked away from negotiations. The stock fell 38 cents
to $102.875 Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with pharmaceuticals is that it is a hit-driven
business just like the movies,'' said Ghriskey of Dreyfus.
``Procter can instead keep innovating the diaper.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors had other concerns. Primarily with Warner-Lambert,
``that dated term `synergies' just wasn't there,'' Ghriskey said.
Moreover, he said, ``what we saw this escalating into would be a
bidding war.''
</P>
<P>
   The company has favored acquisitions in categories it knows
well, namely goods sold on grocery-store shelves. And though it has
made a couple of sizable acquisitions in recent years, most have
been cash deals far smaller than the proposed acquisition of the
drug companies.
</P>
<P>
   P&AMP;G bought Iams Co. last August for $2.3 billion to move into
the premium pet-food business. And in 1997 it bought Tambrands for
$2 billion to strengthen its feminine-hygiene business. To buy
Warner-Lambert and American Home, P&AMP;G would have had to put up much
more than the $78 billion that Pfizer is bidding for Warner-Lambert
alone.
</P>
<P>
   So while three weeks of negotiations did not pan out for P&AMP;G,
going to the party is proof of something afoot under Jager.

   New Museum Tours Explore High and Low &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Since 1953, the American Museum of Natural History in New York
has been running tours to exotic places, with experts as guides.
This year, the museum's Discovery Tours program has added a more
adventurous category, including a 16-day trek to the Pamirs in
central Asia, and a submarine safari off western Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The Pamir expedition will gather in Beijing on Aug. 10 and meet
its study leaders, Bob Jones, an Asian art and Silk Road scholar,
and Cynthia Wilder, an anthropologist at the Metropolitan Museum of
Art. The group _ no more than 25 _ then will fly to Urumqi on the
edge of the Taklimakan Desert and the Tian Shan, the Celestial
Mountains, in remote western China.
</P>
<P>
   Among the sites in that area to be visited are the Turpan
Depression _ 505 feet below sea level, the lowest point in Asia _
the Bezeklik Caves to see their Buddhist art, the ancient Tang
Dynasty ruins at Gaochang and the Heavenly Lake.
</P>
<P>
   A flight to the Silk Road city of Kashi precedes a road trip
through the northern cord of the Pamir Knot _ from which five
mountain systems radiate _ into Kyrgyzstan, with a night in a yurt
camp in Naryn. The group spends several days in Uzbekistan and a
day in Bangkok before returning to the United States on Aug. 26.
</P>
<P>
   The submarine safari is offered July 10 to 14 and July 12 to 16.
Participants will make three dives in two- or three-person vessels
in the Strait of Georgia off Vancouver, as much as 600 feet down.
They should see giant octopuses, king crabs and the primitive
sixgill, or cow, shark, rarely observed because it prefers habitats
thousands of feet deep (experts believe it visits these waters for
seasonal feeding and mating). The trip will be led by Marcello R.
de Carvalho, an icthyologist at the museum.
</P>
<P>
   The Pamir trip costs $8,390 a person, double occupancy, or
$6,590 without air fare from the United States, and includes most
meals. The submarine expedition costs $3,890, with all meals and
accommodations on Hornby Island, but no air travel. Rates include
$2,500 medical and $30,000 evacuation insurance.

   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Golfers seeking lower scores and warmer temperatures may be
interested in the new 23-acre Kapalua Golf Academy at the entrance
to the Kapalua Resort on Maui, Hawaii. Overlooking Honolua Bay and
designed by Hale Irwin, the Senior PGA Tour star, the academy is
designed for players of all ages and abilities. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The grand opening of the academy has been set for March 1 as the
turf on its 18-hole putting course grows. But the practice range _
with an 85,000-square-foot tee area _ is scheduled to open Tuesday
and the academy has begun to make use of its 3,500-square-foot
learning center. The center features a 24-seat classroom, an
exercise room targeted to golfers, and a digital video bay for
coaching.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Students in the two- and three-day schools will be videotaped
and, working with one of the resort's more than 25 PGA
professionals, analyze their techniques. Private lessons and daily
clinics are also offered, and golfers can hone their skills on the
Kapalua Resort's three 18-hole layouts _ the Bay, the Village and
the Plantation courses, the last the site of the Mercedes
Championships, won this month by Tiger Woods. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Prices range from $35 for a half-hour of instruction for a
junior player (under 15 years old) to $795 for the three-day golf
school, which includes 15 hours of instruction, a digital video
analysis and 27 holes of golf at the resort. Information: (808)

   The Bourbons Are Back (In the Louvre, Anyway) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Seven newly renovated galleries on the first floor of the
Richelieu wing of the Louvre opened last month, reuniting the
museum's early 19th-century art objects as part of a project to be
finished in 2002. The renovated galleries, totaling 10,000 square
feet, now display 175 objects, most acquired since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Rooms 75 through 77 display objects from the Restoration period
(1814-1830), when the Bourbon monarchy under Louis XVIII returned
to power after the downfall of Napoleon I. This change of regime
did not break with the pervading neo-Classical style favored by
Napoleon. Louis XVIII moved easily into the Tuileries Palace (now
the Louvre), merely swapping Napoleon's signature N and eagle
trademarks for his own crown and fleur-de-lis.
</P>
<P>
   A notable exception to this redecorating austerity is the king's
bedroom, which was refurnished under both Louis XVIII and Charles X
and which is reconstructed in Gallery 75. Restoration-period
objects of note include the Duchesse de Berry's crystal and bronze
vanity table, Charles X's elaborately sculptured and gilded walnut
bed, and several Sevres porcelain pieces. &QL;

   While the July Monarchy (1830 to 1848) under Louis-Philippe,
Duke of Orleans, began with much the same neo-Classical bent, it
quickly acquired a more eclectic style. The display in Rooms 78
through 81 reflect neo-Gothic, Renaissance and Louis XV styles.
Exhibits include a desk (1839) by the Grohe brothers of heavily
sculptured rosewood, a Sevres Chinese tea set (1840), and
silverware and gilded furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Admission to the Louvre, which is closed Tuesday (these new
galleries are also closed Monday and Thursday) is $7, $4 after 3
p.m. and on Sunday. Information: (33-1) 40.20.51.51 or

   On Wall St., Rooms Fit for a Robber Baron &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In its storied 158-year existence, the massive limestone
structure at 55 Wall Street has served as the New York Merchants'
Exchange, the United States Customs House and headquarters for
National City Bank, which has evolved into Citigroup. Now, it has
yet another new occupant and identity: The Regent Wall Street, the
financial district's first luxury hotel, opened quietly just before
Christmas and will celebrate its grand opening upon its completion
in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Designed in 1842 by the architect Isaiah Rogers and renovated in
1908 by the architectural team of McKim, Mead &AMP; White, the landmark
building in the heart of the financial district is a study in
robber-baron chic. With a wall of mammoth Ionic columns, the
exterior looks like a titanic temple of commerce; only a discreet
sign identifies it as a hotel. And it's easy to imagine the Italian
Renaissance-style ballroom as the cavernous marble-walled banking
hall it once was.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the 12,000-square-foot ballroom, behind the lobby,
can gaze up at the magnificent 80-foot ceiling with its gilded dome
ringed with handsome Wedgwood jasperware panels depicting the signs
of the zodiac and the four points of the compass.
</P>
<P>
   The 144 guest rooms are also on a fairly grand scale. The
smallest is 525 square feet, suites start at around 1,200 square
feet, and all have large dark green and beige marble bathrooms,
with big tubs and ample stall showers. Tradition wins out over
trendiness, with comfortable furniture in rich woods and fabrics
like silk damask and velvet, in shades of beige and green.
</P>
<P>
   Room toys include 39-inch televisions, DVD and CD players (with
a library for each) and portable telephones. There is a restaurant
and a fitness center, and a spa is being built.
</P>
<P>
   An unusual feature of the building is the eight 19th-century
jail cells in the basement, where people who couldn't pay customs
fees were incarcerated. The hotel may turn the jail into a cigar
bar, but until then, the cells might come in handy for guests who
can't pay their bills: rooms cost $425 and suites $525 until March
31, then will start at $545 and $850. Reservations: (800) 545-4000,
(212) 845-8600; fax (212) 845-8601.

JUDGE WILL NOT ALLOW TATTOO OF CONFEDERATE FLAG INTO EVIDENCE IN
RACE BIAS CASE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By L.M. SIXEL 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ U.S. District Judge Nancy Atlas ruled Monday that she
would not permit the tattoo of a Confederate flag on the forearm of
a manager into evidence in a employment race discrimination case.
</P>
<P>
   Atlas ruled the tattoo, which is on the arm of Chief Inspector
Dan Petrash of the city of Houston's Department of Public Works and
Engineering, is too controversial a symbol to be introduced to the
jury in the trial against the city that began Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Two black inspectors who work for the public works department
have sued the city, claiming they were passed over for promotions
two years ago because of their race.
</P>
<P>
   The inspectors, Louella Henderson Jones and Herbert Williams
III, contend that Petrash, who had the hiring authority, made
racist remarks and told other employees he wanted a white man for
the job as senior inspector.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson and Williams claimed the tattoo was evidence of
Petrash's attitude toward blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Atlas allowed the tattoo of the flag into evidence during the
first trial, which ended in a hung jury last week.
</P>
<P>
   But in light of the controversy in South Carolina over the
Confederate flag that flies over the state Capitol, Atlas said she
was reluctant to admit the tattoo this time around.
</P>
<P>
   Atlas also said it was unclear what the Confederate flag means
to Petrash today since he had the tattoo applied decades ago when
he was 19 years old. She added there was no proof Petrash was
showing the tattoo off at work.
</P>
<P>
   Don Fleming, assistant city attorney, said he didn't want to
comment on the case.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Ahmad, who is representing Jones, also declined to comment.

SPORTS COLUMN: SUPER BOWL OPERATING AT DOUBLE-TIME PACE
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It happened overnight, literally. One moment the
Titans and the Rams were running around separate stadiums,
celebrating their trips to the Super Bowl. The next moment they
were here in icy, snowy, slippery Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Now this is the way to run a Super Bowl. Get the show on the
road. Don't sip too much of that stuff, boys. We've got a game.
</P>
<P>
   Less is most definitely more _ no yawning week between the
conference title games and Super Bowl week. Just get it on. This is
only the fifth time the National Football League has run its Super
Bowl the week after the conference games. There does not appear to
be a master plan, but this should only be a habit.
</P>
<P>
   The hurry-up offense is happening this season because the league
did not want to hold playoff games on Saturday, Jan. 1, what with
all the bowl games _ none of them relevant anymore, but that's
another story. So they pushed back the 17-week season, cut out the
interim week, and here we are, almost ready to rumble.
</P>
<P>
   Is there any advantage to playing the game with one week or two
weeks in between? When in doubt, go to an expert.
</P>
<P>
   One expert would be Jim Kelly, the quarterback of the Buffalo
Bills back in their four straight Super Bowl years, who was in town
on Monday to work on the program ``NFL Countdown'' on ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried it both ways and it turned out the same,'' Kelly said
with a smile, not needing to footnote that the Bills lost all four
Super Bowls from 1991 through 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In the first Super Bowl, the Bills lost to the Giants without
the extra week of coaches burrowing mole-like in their dismal film
rooms. In the second and third Super Bowls, the Bills had two weeks
to prepare. The fourth time, they had only one week, and they lost
to the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are pluses and minuses,'' Kelly said. ``The extra week
is good for taking care of all the details.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't underestimate details. The players like to bring family
and friends, and sometimes the off-week is spent allocating the
tickets and arranging hotels and travel. By the end of the
off-week, a player could have a real nice family feud going.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marv always prepared us the week before for that,'' Kelly said
of his former coach, Marv Levy. ``It was never a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, all four teams in the two conference games were
advised about Super Bowl details last week. This struck Coach Dick
Vermeil of the Rams as being a trifle sad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking of all four teams going through this meeting,
and only two of them would get to go,'' said Vermeil, who,
admittedly, does have a lachrymose side.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Vermeil's team did not waste its logistics
session. But there is another factor that no amount of preparation
can fix.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have injured players, you can use the extra week off,''
Kelly added. ``We usually played five preseason games plus two or
three playoff games, so the week off was a plus for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bills were an experienced team even by their first Super
Bowl appearance after the 1990 season. They were reaching the level
that had been predicted for them. Kelly thinks this year's teams
are in a somewhat different position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some teams are on a roll, and you don't want that week off,''
Kelly said. ``Momentum's on your side. You just want to play.''
</P>
<P>
   That would certainly fit the Rams and the Titans, both relocated
franchises that suddenly found themselves this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans were not your normal 9-and-7 wild-card clunker, but
rather a very good team that won 13 of 16 games this season. They
had the burden of coming through the wild-card round, an extra
layer of bruises and fatigue, but they have now rambled through
three playoff games on talent and energy.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams proved themselves in a grueling 11-6 victory over Tampa
Bay on Sunday. They knew they could sling the ball. Now they know
they can win a grim defensive battle, too.
</P>
<P>
   With all the nervous energy coursing around in them, the Rams
and Titans might be well off playing in Piedmont Park today, even
with the broken tree limbs all over the city.
</P>
<P>
   That won't happen, of course. There is too much at stake. The
entire world is primed to pause on Sunday evening for probably four
hours of commercials interspersed with the odd snippet of football
action.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL has done the right thing _ no time to build up for the
normal inertia, the normal Super Bowl reaction of, ``That's it?''
It is already Tuesday. The Super Bowl is only five days off. Where
did the time go?

FEWER BARRIERS FOR THE DISABLED  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 30) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BETSY WADE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A number of changes making travel more accessible for people
with disabilities have unfolded in recent days. Here are some of
these developments. The world's largest economy lodging chain, Days
Inns of America, reached an agreement with the federal government
last month that should mean an increase in motel rooms adapted for
disabled guests.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement between Days Inns of Parsippany, N.J., a division
of the Cendant Corp., and the Justice Department ended a dispute of
more than five years. The chain will require that owners who plan
to open motels bearing its name must certify the places comply with
the Americans With Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
   It will also pay for a survey to identify problems at places
built since 1993 that have already opened, and establish a $4.7
million interest-free loan fund to help franchise holders at these
hotels make needed renovations. The chain also paid the United
States $50,000 in penalties. Days Inn has 152,000 guest rooms in
1,800 properties in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   John L. Wodatch, head of the department's disability-rights
division, said he hoped that the agreement would serve as a model
for other franchising companies that play a role in the design of
independently operated hotels and motels. Wodatch said it was a
difficult agreement to reach because the company said it was not in
the hotel business but in the franchising business.
</P>
<P>
   The disability act, signed by President George W. Bush in 1990,
requires that motels built after Jan. 26, 1993, meet particular
rules: public areas and a percentage of bedrooms must be accessible
by wheelchair; alarms, telephones, bathroom fixtures and the like
must accommodate guests with vision or hearing impairments or other
disabilities. In 1994, the Justice Department began investigating
newly built Days Inns; Wodatch said then that consumer complaints
against the chain outnumbered those against other companies.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the department sued five new Days Inns, their
architects and contractors as well as Days Inns of America and its
parent company, now Cendant, saying that the motels did not provide
equal access for disabled guests.
</P>
<P>
   A number of other properties originally on the lawsuit list
reached settlements before they were sued. The parent company
responded that it had no responsibility for individual motels'
compliance with the law, that it merely licensed the brand name and
provided certain services for a fee.
</P>
<P>
   The department found some problems recurring throughout the
chain, among them, insufficient accessible parking, inaccessible
entrances and walkways; inadequate signs for those with limited
vision; bathroom doors too narrow for wheelchairs.
</P>
<P>
   Last month's settlement, filed in federal court in Kentucky,
where one of the five motels was situated, came after 13 months of
mediation. Days Inns said it believed the settlement was ``good for
our customers, the traveling public and the hotel industry.''
Attorney General Janet Reno said that she hoped other hotels and
hotel-franchise companies would make similar changes to assure full
accessibility.
</P>
<P>
   The law says that properties built before 1993 need make
accessibility alterations only in areas being renovated; this means
that landmark properties and other historic hotels that do not
renovate can still have lobbies with a lot of steps and no ramps,
registration desks too high to reach from wheelchairs and other
features that may thwart disabled guests.
</P>
<P>
   London theater will be more accessible for travelers with
hearing loss during a tour scheduled for March by the Theater
Access Project of the Theater Development Fund. This nonprofit
organization, sponsor of the TKTS discount-ticket booths in
Manhattan, believes this is the first London theater tour for
hearing-impaired Americans. The League for the Hard of Hearing and
its affiliated Advocates for Better Communication have joined to
sponsor the trip for 25 participants.
</P>
<P>
   The group will take along a screen that displays dialogue in
two-inch-high electronic captions. This display was developed by an
American, Don DePew, using court-reporting computer programs. It
has been used in Broadway and Off Broadway theaters for three
years, according to Lisa Carling, the project's director.
</P>
<P>
   The script for ``Antony and Cleopatra,'' as presented by the
Royal Shakespeare Company at the Barbican, and for a West End play
will be transcribed into the system ahead of time, along with notes
on offstage sounds and the like. In the theater, the device is
placed at the side of the orchestra and an auditor scrolls three
lines at a time as the dialogue is spoken.
</P>
<P>
   Although amplification devices are available in London theaters,
the Theater Access Project believes that this will be the first use
of open captioning there. The London theaters are advertising the
performances, and seats may be reserved in the caption-viewing
seats.
</P>
<P>
   The seven-night trip, leaving March 25, has other events and
tours scheduled. The cost is $1,999 a person with two in a room at
the Strand Palace Hotel on the Strand. Air fare on British Airways,
departure and hotel taxes and transfer of one piece of baggage are
included.
</P>
<P>
   A single room costs $430 more. The reservation deadline is Feb.
10. Theater Access Project, (212) 221-0885, extension 257; the TTY
(teletypewriter) number is (212) 719-4537; www.tdf.org. The League
for the Hard of Hearing is at www.lhh.org. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the Denver airport, I encountered a group of wheelchair users
waiting to board. I was amazed to learn that they were a team going
to play Quad Rugby, a fierce game played by quadriplegics. ``It
becomes clear that wheels are weapons, and pity should be checked
at the door,'' a Denver Post reporter said in describing a game in
November.
</P>
<P>
   The treatment of disabled passengers aboard planes is governed
by the Air Carrier Access Act, a law older than the
disability-rights act, but it looked complicated to me getting a
batch of wheelchair passengers onto one plane. The act anticipates
this possibility, requiring that any group of 10 or more with
disabilities give the airline 48 hours' notice.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Theisen, who works at the Craig Hospital in Englewood,
Colo., and is coordinator for the group I met, the Denver Harlequin
Rugby Club, said that United Airlines gave her a lot of help in the
eight trips her 15-member team made in a season. She avoids
connecting flights, and United can get the team nonstop to most
tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   She orders bulkhead seats for the players and the accompanying
people, she said, and generally this works out. The players are
boarded ahead of the other passengers, reaching their seats in the
airline's narrow aisle wheelchair and getting into them by boosting
themselves over any fixed chair arms. Ms. Theisen said that
although the players were quadriplegics, they had varying degrees
of upper-body mobility and were strong.
</P>
<P>
   The passengers' own wheelchairs are the last things to be
checked into the luggage compartment, as the law requires, she
said, and they come out first and are ready at the Jetway. Ms.
Theisen said that the team usually got off the plane last.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Theisen, who has dealt with other airlines in the West, and
not always so successfully, believes that United's agents are well
trained in the legal requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Wheelchair users or their companions often find that they do not
have the law's provisions at hand, as Ms. Theisen does, when
talking to boarding agents. To assist them, the Eastern Paralyzed
Veterans Association has just published two new pocket cards
summarizing the act.
</P>
<P>
   These note, for example, that batteries on wheelchairs are not
to be drained under any circumstances and that 48 hours' notice is
required if an electric wheelchair is going to be transported on a
plane with fewer than 60 seats.
</P>
<P>
   A single set of the cards and an air-carrier leaflet are
available free from the Eastern Paralyzed Veterans Association,
75-20 Astoria Boulevard, Jackson Heights, N.Y. 11370; (718)
779-8377.
</P>
<P>
   Cruises are feasible vacations for those requiring kidney
dialysis, who may otherwise be limited in their ability to go far.
</P>
<P>
   A new vessel, the 513-passenger Deutschland of Peter Deilmann's
EuropAmerica Cruises, has a dialysis center aboard to accommodate
12 kidney patients on a cruise.
</P>
<P>
   The liner's itinerary this spring and summer ranges from the
Mediterranean to the North Sea and the Baltic, to Scandinavia,
across the Atlantic and through the Panama Canal to the Pacific.
Many cruises on the Deutschland, which is luxurious, are 7 to 18
nights long.
</P>
<P>
   The least expensive 14-night cruise costs $4,040 a person,
double occupancy. Dialysis is about $280 a treatment extra (at 1.93
marks to $1), which is paid at the time of treatment. Kidney
patients and their doctors must provide medical records in advance
to Bauer, a medical firm in Kiel, Germany, that arranges for
treatments and medical personnel on board.

</P>
<P>
   Dialysis Traveller-Dialysis at Sea, a Florida organization in
business for 20 years, has arrangements with many cruise lines to
provide on-board treatments. Steve Debroux, the president, said
that he booked 600 clients a year aboard cruises. There are 100
cruises listed for the coming 15 months in the catalogue; a minimum
booking is 8 dialysis passengers and a maximum is 12. The charge
per treatment is $425.

<P>
   Another resource on accessible travel is found at a Web site
maintained by a California couple, Candy B. Harrington and Charles
Pannell, who have been gathering information on the subject for
three years and who also publish a quarterly newsletter, Emerging
Horizons. The site, emerginghorizons.com, recently had a detailed
article on San Diego. The newsletter, which carries no advertising,
prints lists of motels with roll-in showers that guarantee a
reservation for an accessible room. The winter 2000 issue has a
list for Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   The main article in this issue of the newsletter talks about
accessibility in Florence; it tells which entrance to the Uffizi to
use, the width of the elevator door at the Palazzo Vecchio museum
entrance (29{ inches) and which door to get unlocked to see the
Boboli Gardens. The author, Cornelia Danielson, a Florence
resident, is described as founder of Barrier Free Travel/Viaggiare
Senza Barriere, a nonprofit organization in Tuscany. A year's
subscription to the newsletter costs $11.95 in the United States.
Checks, Visa and MasterCard are accepted.

BOB SQUIER IS DEAD AT 65; MASTER OF POLITICAL IMAGERY
</HEADLINE>
 
 (ATTN: Va., Minn., Texas, Fla., Tenn.)  (nk) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bob Squier, one of the originators of modern
political imagery and a close friend and adviser of Vice President
Al Gore, died Monday after a six-month battle with colon cancer. He
was 65 and lived in Millwood, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Squier brought his background as a documentary filmmaker with a
fascination with American literary figures to his path-breaking
role as political manipulator and marketer. His advertisements,
always for Democrats, were marked by sharp-edged wit and a direct
approach that contrasted with the gauzy morning-in-America style.
</P>
<P>
   His clients included Hubert H. Humphrey in 1968, Jimmy Carter in
1976 and President Clinton and Gore in 1992 and 1996. He worked on
dozens of Senate and governor contests and compiled a win-loss
record envied by his competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``His loyalty, talent and, above all, his perseverance helped
Vice President Gore and me craft a winning re-election campaign
when many had counted us out,'' Clinton said Monday. ``I owe him
much.''
</P>
<P>
   Squier trained many of today's most prominent political
consultants and was one of the first celebrity political advisers,
winning a steady spot as a commentator on the NBC's ``Today''
program in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a pioneer in this business of political
communications,'' said Bill Knapp, a partner of Squier in the
consulting firm Squier Knapp Dunn. ``He helped create the modern
campaign, for better or for worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the legends of late-20th century politics were captured
in Squier's camera and transformed into a form of visual persuasion
that defines political speech in the modern era.
</P>
<P>
   Squier filmed a young politician named Bob Graham as he spent a
day working as a teacher, a laborer, a farmer and an egg-packer to
convince Florida voters that he was a regular guy who understood
their concerns. They rewarded him with the governorship and, later,
a seat in the United States Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Squier also captured dozens of Gore's town meetings in
Tennessee, turning them into a record of contact with voters that
propelled Gore into the Senate and the vice presidency.
</P>
<P>
   As the 1990s dawned and a younger crowd of consultants was
making its mark in politics, some Democrats whispered that Squier
had lost his edge. But Gore stuck with him and used him as a
consultant in the 1992 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   His advertisements for the Clinton-Gore ticket in 1996 visually
linked the Republican nominee Bob Dole to the unpopular Speaker
Newt Gingrich and buried the Dole campaign before it had a chance
to get off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Although he had worked with Gore almost from the beginning of
the vice president's political career, Squier's role in the Gore
campaign sharply diminished last summer after Gore brought in
Carter Eskew as a top adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Eskew and Squier had a bitter and well-publicized falling out in
1992 and refused to work together _ or even speak to each other.
But Gore continued to quietly seek Squier's counsel until illness
incapacitated Squier a few weeks ago, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Eskew, who remains on the Gore campaign as senior media
strategist, said Squier was an innovator to whom American politics
owes a large debt.

   ``Bob understood that campaigns were dialogues and that a lot of
that dialogue takes place through advertising,'' Eskew said. ``I
had some obvious differences with him professionally but I had the
greatest times of my life with him as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Squier partner, Anita Dunn, is the chief communications
consultant in the campaign of Gore's Democratic rival, former Sen.
Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Squier was born in Brainard, Minn., on Sept. 21, 1934, and
reared in Minneapolis. He was a top high school and collegiate
swimmer and set a National Collegiate Athletic Association record
for the butterfly when the stroke was still accompanied by a
frog-kick, rather than the current dolphinlike method of
propulsion.
</P>
<P>
   He studied communications at the University of Minnesota and
learned documentary filmmaking there and then at the public
television stations WGBH in Boston and KLRN in Austin, Texas
</P>
<P>
   Squier made documentaries about President Lyndon B. Johnson
after the Kennedy assassination and filmed award-winning
biographies of Herman Melville and William Faulkner before turning
his transforming eye toward electoral politics.
</P>
<P>
   His sons by his first marriage, Robert Squier and Mark Squier,
followed their father into the business of political persuasion.
Mark is a partner in a political consulting firm; Robert is a
professional musician who produces music tracks for commercial
films and political advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   Squier is also survived by his wife, Prudence, and three
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   He died at his farm in the Virginia horse country west of
Washington where he tended a garden and a small vineyard. Although
Squier was a collector of art, a connoisseur of first-class travel
and something of a clothes horse, he could not master his little
vineyard, Knapp said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He planted it, hoed it, watered it,'' Knapp said, ``and
produced some of the worst wine imaginable.''

AT NEARLY $22 BILLION, GATES FOUNDATION NOW WORLD'S BIGGEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Five short months ago, the Bill and Melinda Gates
Foundation was merely the wealthiest philanthropy in the country.
Now, it's the biggest in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation confirmed Monday that a $5 billion contribution
from the Microsoft founder and his wife boosted the foundation's
assets to $21.8 billion. That pushed it ahead of the Wellcome Trust
in Britain, which has assets worth about $21.4 billion in U.S.
dollars, according to The Chronicle of Philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   The Gates Foundation's ranking as the leading philanthropy in
the world gives them an extra measure of status as the
trend-setters in charitable giving, said Stacy Palmer, editor of
The Chronicle of Philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more in the symbolism,'' said Palmer, whose Washington,
D.C.-based publication reports on nonprofit organizations. ``It
just makes them sort of more important.''
</P>
<P>
   To those at the Gates Foundation as well, the new ranking is
viewed as largely symbolic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the size is less important to us than the
tremendous responsibility that comes with using the resources in an
effective way,'' said Trevor Neilson, communications director for
the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The monetary value of the philanthropy has grown rapidly in the
past year. The Gateses poured $15.1 billion in assets into the
family's philanthropic entities last year. In August, the family
consolidated two foundations into a single philanthropic powerhouse
worth $17.1 billion at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal tax laws, the foundation is required to give away
at least 5 percent of its assets each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bill (and) Melinda Gates Foundation will continue to focus
on helping to improve people's lives primarily through health and
learning,'' foundation co-chair Patty Stonesifer said in a
statement. ``Particular attention will go towards accelerating the
development and distribution of life-saving vaccines.''
</P>
<P>
   The foundation is staffed by about 120 people, the bulk of them
dedicated to the foundation's project to wire all of the nation's
public libraries. To manage the exponential growth, the Gates
Foundation has relied largely on outside experts for advice and
established organizations for implementation of their
multi-billion-dollar giving, Neilson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of trying to build massive amounts of expertise
in-house, we rely on other organizations to come to us with
proposals and help us implement programs,'' Neilson said.
</P>
<P>
   The $1 billion Gates Millennium Scholars Program, for example,
is being administered largely by the United Negro College Fund. The
scholarships, announced in September, are designed to increase the
number of minority students completing undergraduate and graduate
degree.
</P>
<P>
   In November, the foundation gave $750 million to establish The
Global Fund for Children's Vaccines, which will pay for vaccines
and immunization programs in developing countries and support
research into new vaccines and therapies. The fund will be guided
by a consortium led by the World Health Organization, UNICEF and
the World Bank.

<P>
   MIAMI _ After waiting nearly five hours in a suburban airport
here Monday, the two Cuban grandmothers of Elian Gonzalez gave up
their effort to meet the boy and flew to Washington as their
custody battle moved to a new stage.
</P>
<P>
   The grandmothers were scheduled to meet on Tuesday with members
of Congress, who have helped turn their fight into an international
tug of war.
</P>
<P>
   Their private twin-engine Learjet, provided by the National
Council of Churches, left Kendall-Tamiani Executive Airport just as
three of the grandmothers' relatives and their lead lawyer arrived
to talk with them _ without the only person they wanted to see,
Elian.
</P>
<P>
   A Miami police official said the plane was heading for
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The grandmothers' departure, after a late-scheduled trip from
New York to Miami Monday morning, was the latest leg of their
four-day odyssey to bring the boy home to his father, who was
divorced from his mother. His mother drowned two months ago during
an escape from Cuba, but Elian survived, clinging for two days to
an inner tube in the Atlantic off Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's grandmothers became ``frightened and scared'' about
coming to Miami, said Bob Edgar, general secretary of the National
Council of Churches. With other council officials, Edgar has been
shepherding the women since their departure from Havana on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They see the thousands of people here in Miami,'' he said,
``marching and protesting, and you can imagine as very simple,
loving, caring grandparents that they would be frightened to
come.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier plans had called for the grandmothers to have dinner
with relatives who had been caring for Elian, but the 6 p.m. EST
dinner date came and went without the grandmothers' leaving the
airport. At 8 p.m., three of the relatives and their lead attorney,
Spencer Eig, left the house and headed for the airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they really love him, they will come see him,'' said Elly
Carrera, 17, a Cuban-American who supports Elian's great-uncle
Lazaro Gonzalez in his appeal for custody of the boy and who was
standing outside the Gonzalez home, where the grandmothers were to
have dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously they don't love him,'' Ms. Carrera said. ``They are
speaking Castro's words. Castro wants to win. But we won't let him
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, scores of onlookers and media waited outside
the house. Inside, a cousin said Elian was watching a video of
``Home Alone 3.''
</P>
<P>
   The boy's case started as a family feud and has erupted into an
international incident with anti-Castro Cuban-Americans urging that
he be reared in the United States and that his father be denied
custody.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress, and in particular those from Florida,
seized upon the issue Monday, the lawmakers' first day back at work
after a two-month recess. Sen. Connie Mack and Rep. Bill McCollum,
both Florida Republicans, introduced bills to grant the boy
citizenship or permanent residency. Meanwhile, several House
Democrats offered other bills blocking them.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami relatives, led by Lazaro Gonzalez and his family, have
claimed custody of the boy in defiance of the Clinton
administration and the pleas of the father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez,
to repatriate him. The grandmothers, who flew to New York on
Friday, are Raquel Rodriguez, mother of Elizabet Brotons Rodriguez,
Elian's mother, and Mariela Quintana, the father's mother.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   All day Monday, plans had unfolded to bring the grandmothers to
the Little Havana home of Lazaro Gonzalez, a paternal great-uncle
of Elian, and his wife, Angela, and 21-year-old daughter,
Marisleysis.
</P>
<P>
   Carole Florman, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said
authorities had tried to arrange a meeting of family members at a
more neutral location.
</P>
<P>
   ``The grandmothers were not comfortable with a meeting at
Lazaro's house,'' Ms. Florman said. ``They want a private meeting
with the boy.''
</P>
<P>
   It was clear that the Gonzalez family here and its publicists
had been going to some lengths to establish the impression of an
ideal, welcoming home for Elian. Rather than calling another
protest in support of the relatives, leaders of the Cuban-American
groups carpeted the sidewalk outside the house with pink, yellow
and red carnations.
</P>
<P>
   Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Republican member of Congress from Miami,
said while visiting the home early Monday: ``The family's looking
forward to the grandmas' coming. It's always been a family full of
love.'' Like other leaders of the exile community she urged that if
the father and grandmother wanted custody they come to Miami and
``testify in court where it can be decided impartially.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Elian's grandmothers plan to meet Tuesday in Washington with
members of Congress, including Sen. Christopher J. Dodd, D-Conn.,
who every year sponsors legislation to ease the trade embargo with
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Just before embarking on their trip to the United States, which
led to a meeting with Attorney General Janet Reno and with Doris
Meissner, commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service, the grandmothers had predicated any trip to the United
States, their first off Cuban soil, on retrieving Elian.
</P>
<P>
   But theirs and the administration's hands are tied by suits
filed in federal court here last week enjoining the administration
from repatriating Elian and asking for the right to apply for
political asylum. So instead they asked Ms. Reno to help organize a
visit with the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers introduced three bills Monday, two in the House and
one in the Senate, to grant Elian citizenship or permanent
residency. They said their legislation would put the decision in
the hands of a Florida state judge instead of the federal
Immigration and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   Mack, who sponsored the Senate bill with five other lawmakers,
said he wanted to take politics out of the decision. But state
judges in Florida are elected, and any judge in the Miami area,
where Elian is living with relatives, is likely to face tremendous
pressure to rule that the boy stay in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The lead sponsor of a companion bill in the House, McCollum,
said, ``Any decision made by a governmental agency is contrary to
his best interest and clearly against his mother's desires.''
</P>
<P>
   A bill proposed by House Democrats, including Reps. Robert
Menendez of New Jersey and Patrick J. Kennedy of Rhode Island,
would grant permanent residency instead of citizenship, to allow
Elian to decide his citizenship on his own when he is older.
</P>
<P>
   But another group of House members, including Reps. Charles B.
Rangel, D-N.Y., Barney Frank, D-Mass., and Ray LaHood, R-Ill.,
introduced a nonbinding resolution to block the citizenship bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that this 6-year-old boy who lost his
mother in a tragic accident at sea should be reunited with his
father,'' Rangel said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   In suing for custody in federal court here, Lazaro Gonzalez
maintains that he and his family can assure Elian a happier
upbringing than his father and the grandmothers, who live in the
Cuban town of Cardenas.

CHIEFS' THOMAS PARALYZED IN LEGS AFTER ACCIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Derrick V. Thomas, the lightning-quick linebacker for the Kansas
City Chiefs, was flown from Missouri to a hospital in Florida on
Monday with his spine fractured in two places, his legs paralyzed
and the chances of his continuing his 10-year career in doubt, the
Chiefs said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obviously a very severe injury,'' Carl Peterson, the
team's president, said in a news conference in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, 33, was injured Saturday afternoon when he lost control
of his car on an icy stretch of Interstate 435 north of Kansas
City, skidded onto a median and flipped over at least twice, the
Missouri Highway Patrol said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas and a friend, Michael D. Tellis, were not wearing seat
belts and were thrown from the car. Tellis, 49, died at the scene.
A third passenger, John C. Hagebusch, 34, walked away from the
accident with minor injuries. He had been wearing a seat belt in
the back seat.
</P>
<P>
   The three men were headed to Kansas City International Airport
to catch a plane to St. Louis, where they had tickets to the
National Football Conference championship game.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas was taken to Liberty Hospital in Liberty, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   The Chiefs' team doctor, Dr. Jon Browne, said Thomas' spine was
broken at the base of the neck and in the middle of the back. He
can still move his arms, shoulders and upper chest, but appears to
be paralyzed from the waist down, at least for now, Browne said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes time to check these things out,'' he said.
``Improvement can come slowly or in rapid bursts.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas was awake and alert Monday morning, in fairly good
spirits and joking with nurses, said his agent, Leigh Steinberg.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas also had some feeling in his toes, which his doctors said
is a good sign, Steinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next few days will tell how much damage was done to his
spine and what the prognosis is,'' Steinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   There was no evidence that Thomas had been drinking, the state
police said, though investigators said he had been traveling too
fast for the icy conditions that suddenly developed Saturday
afternoon after a cold north wind froze a layer of melting snow.
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday afternoon, the Chiefs flew Thomas to Miami, his
hometown, where he was to be transferred to Jackson Memorial
Hospital, which has one of the best clinics in the world for spinal
injuries, Peterson said.
</P>
<P>
   A friend of Thomas', who spoke on the condition of anonymity,
said doctors had told the linebacker that the break to the fifth
vertebrae of his neck might be successfully treated with surgery to
fuse two vertebrae together. But the second spinal fracture could
be more problematic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is whether the spinal cord is completely severed
or whether it's still got some life in it,'' the friend said. ``The
doctors are not real optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   For 10 seasons, Thomas has been the mainstay of the Chiefs'
defense, a hard-hitting linebacker who stands 6 feet 3 inches,
weighs 255 pounds and is known for one of the quickest first steps
in the league. He has more sacks than any other player in the last
decade, recording 116.5.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas City, Thomas has become almost as well known for his
charitable works as for his exploits on the field. He founded the
Third and Long Foundation, which sends tutors into inner-city
schools to combat illiteracy. He also started a successful roofing
business and invested, with Tellis, in a limousine service.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got remarkable skills outside the realm of athletics,''
Steinberg said. ``He'll be fine in that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors may consider surgery to lift pressure off the spinal
cord. But even if surgeons can restore Thomas' spinal cord to
working condition, it remains an open question whether his back
would be able to take the punishment of playing in the National
Football League, spinal experts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably unlikely,'' said Dr. Michael Weinberger of St.
Vincents Hospital in New York. ``The issue is whether he's going to
walk again.''

FORBES HOPES FOR THREE-MAN RACE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL CROWLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES _ Aiming for a strong showing here that could lift
him into the top tier of Republican presidential candidates,
millionaire publisher Steve Forbes hoped to create a three-man race
in New Hampshire against Texas Governor George W. Bush and Senator
John McCain of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes hit the Iowa airwaves Monday, conducting more than two
dozen radio and television interviews as he pitched his message of
social and economic conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   With his campaign manager publicly anticipating a showing in the
``mid-20s'' in Monday's Iowa caucuses, Forbes sought to energize a
campaign that has lagged in the polls and to establish himself as a
conservative alternative to the more moderate Bush and McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the true conservative in the race,'' said Forbes,
appearing with his wife Sabina and three of his five daughters
outside Scruffy's Pizza &AMP; Deli in downtown Des Moines. ``A strong
conservative running against two moderates.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' Iowa campaign was anything but scruffy, however,
spending $3.2 million in media ads in the state since June.
Overall, Forbes has spent more than $31 million, including $25
million from his personal finances.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on CNN Monday, Forbes' campaign manager repeated his
prediction that Bush would finish third in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' spokesman, Greg Meuller, explained that Forbes expects
to make an even stronger showing in New Hampshire as Bush and
McCain divide the votes of moderates and Forbes consolidates the
support of social conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Meuller said Forbes would focus on taxes in New Hampshire,
hammering Bush and McCain's proposals as too modest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're relishing the tax debate that's waiting for us when we
get up there,'' Meuller said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush and McCain plans would lower marginal tax rates, but
maintain a multitiered tax system based on income. Forbes would
replace the tax code with a 17 percent flat tax, exempting up to
$36,000 of income from taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Forbes bragged that his flat-tax plan has already
influenced the campaign. He also said Bush was a timid and
visionless candidate who could not inspire voters and would cost
his party the White House if nominated.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes said Bush's approach was to ``say as little as possible,
use a slogan, do winks and nods, and hope that gets you by.''
</P>
<P>
   ``After losing two presidential elections through that _ trying
to muffle the differences, trying to stifle debate _ I think we
need to go to what we did in the 1980s, where we did have a clear,
lucid, inspired message based on principle,'' Forbes said. ``That's
how we won then, that's how we're going to win in 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes dismissed questions about whether he was concerned that
two other conservative candidates, Alan Keyes and Gary Bauer, might
make it harder for him to unite the party's right wing. Forbes
noted he has received endorsements from prominent conservative
leaders like Phyllis Schlafly, Paul Weyrich and Brent Bozell,
saying ``I think conservatives are rallying around my cause.''
</P>
<P>
   With Forbes enjoying his most prominent moment in the race so
far, the mood within his campaign was upbeat. Returning from a tour
of the state on a chartered jet late Sunday, giddy Forbes aides
cracked open beers with reporters and hauled out a speaker to blast
music into the cabin.
</P>
<P>
   Even the typically reserved Forbes seemed loose, predicting that
the St. Louis Rams would defeat the Tennessee Titans in the Super
Bowl. Forbes was careful to note that the Titans had recently
relocated from Texas _ home state of George W. Bush.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial Tuesday, Jan. 25: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Military meddling in politics has become rare in Latin America
during the past two decades. But Ecuador is a conspicuous and
worrisome exception. Last weekend's forcible removal of President
Jamil Mahuad is disturbing, especially since it is the second time
in less than three years that an elected Ecuadorean leader has been
prematurely ousted from office. Ominously, on both occasions the
army played a decisive role in shaping the presidential succession.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of a confused weekend of maneuvering capped by strong
warnings from Washington against the establishment of a military
regime, Vice President Gustavo Noboa has been sworn in as
president. Ecuador's government thus remains in civilian,
constitutional hands. But democracy's future there looks tenuous.
Washington must be ready for further turmoil as Ecuador steers its
way through a difficult economic and political crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Mahuad, who won a majority in presidential runoff elections
barely 18 months ago, saw his popularity plunge to 9 percent as
Ecuador's chronically ailing economy slipped beyond his control.
Blocked by an impasse with a politically fractured Congress from
enacting needed tax increases on the wealthy and reforms of an
inefficient public sector, Mahuad stood by helplessly as inflation
raged, unemployment soared, banks tottered and half of Ecuador's
foreign debt passed into default.
</P>
<P>
   In desperation, Mahuad announced earlier this month that he
would replace Ecuador's battered currency with the dollar. Many
Ecuadoreans, especially the large and impoverished Indian minority,
feared that converting to dollars would lead to painful reductions
in their already low living standards.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, thousands of Indians marched on Congress. Army
guards stepped aside, leaving Mahuad besieged in the presidential
palace. Two military-civilian juntas were named in rapid
succession. Then, after the Clinton administration strongly
condemned the unfolding coup and threatened the new regime with
economic isolation, the military handed power back to Noboa, the
elected vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's timely diplomatic intervention was constructive.
But real stability will not return until Ecuador's leaders,
starting with Noboa, address the country's fundamental economic
problems. Tax revenues must be fairly increased, corruption
prosecuted and public-sector subsidies sharply reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Austerity measures such as these will be hard to apply until the
government broadens its popular legitimacy and wins the confidence
of the Indian population. Meanwhile, Ecuador's political parties
have to recognize that their incessant infighting is discrediting
civilian rule and dangerously increasing the political power of
military commanders. They must show themselves capable of serious
reforms before outside creditors can be approached for further debt
relief.

EDITORIAL: IOWA STARTS THE RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial Tuesday, Jan. 25: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The victories by Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore
finally move the 2000 presidential campaign to the phase of real
results. For the next six weeks and perhaps longer, numbers will
speak more loudly than all the earlier prognostications about the
battles for the Republican and Democratic nominations. But the Iowa
verdict, while sustaining Bush's and Gore's front-runner status,
hardly insulates them from New Hampshire's upset-minded voters. The
strong showing of Steve Forbes and Alan Keyes means that the Texas
governor will face competition for the conservative vote in New
Hampshire, weakening his ability to contest Sen. John McCain for
the moderate vote. Former Sen. Bill Bradley suffered a setback in
Iowa but remains a formidable challenger.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa, for its part, showed the differing dynamics between the
one-on-one Democratic contest and the six-candidate race on the
Republican side. Once Bradley decided to contest the state, Gore
was able to revitalize his campaign by casting himself as a fighter
able to survive without the protective cloak of inevitability. He
was also able to use his union and party backing to stretch
Bradley's thinner resources.
</P>
<P>
   Though Bradley's efforts in Iowa faltered toward the end, he has
considerable support in New Hampshire. He may also do well in other
states. Whoever ends up as the Democratic nominee will be tougher
and more skilled, and he will still be camped out in the party's
mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   In the Republican field, McCain's GOP insurgency has slowed a
bit as well. But the failure of Bush to do better against Forbes
and Keyes could give him an opportunity to open up a lead against
Bush in New Hampshire, the first fight he has chosen to contest.
One of the interesting paradoxes of that state now is that Bradley
and McCain will be battling across party lines for the independent
voters who make up 37 percent of the New Hampshire electorate.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how well Bush does in Iowa, his performance there
could be costly in terms of ideological positioning. The governor
had sought to present himself as a moderate determined not to be
tagged as an anti-abortion extremist. He had said that he would not
apply a litmus test for Supreme Court nominees. But the Iowa result
portends a continuing necessity to appeal to Christian evangelicals
and harden his opposition to abortion.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference before the weekend, Bush said that he would
appoint justices who strictly interpret the Constitution and then
asserted that the right to abortion was not guaranteed by the
Constitution. With each new question he has become more querulous,
with his press spokesman finally declaring that he would no longer
hold press conferences unless they were in his interest. This was
not a positive sign for Bush's professed determination to appeal to
moderates in the general election, should he win the Republican
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has time and probably the dexterity to move back to the
center. The pressures on all the candidates underscore both the
seriousness and the value of this new phase of the process. Over
the next few weeks, delegates will be won and candidacies will
either strengthen or die. And a process that sometimes seems
irrational, debilitating and endless will quickly show its value in
shaping the choice voters will face in November. &QL;

IN A BLINK OF AN EYE, ROAD TURNED DEADLY IN MULTICAR CRASH 
</HEADLINE>
 2TAKES-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINE VENDEL, BILL GRAHAM and MATT CAMPBELL  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was early Sunday afternoon, the wind whipping snow across
Interstate 29.
</P>
<P>
   Laurie Purkey, an emergency medical technician for MAST, was
off-duty and driving on southbound. She'd been in St. Joseph
shopping with her 15-year-old daughter but cut the trip short when
the weather turned nasty.
</P>
<P>
   They were minutes from home as she topped the crest of a hill
just north of the Missouri 273 overpass. The snow suddenly fell
heavily and everything went white.
</P>
<P>
   ``One minute I could see OK and within the blink of an eye, I
couldn't see anything,'' she said. ``I slowed down as the
visibility got worse. I slowed down more when I saw people driving
northbound flashing their lights. I knew that meant something was
going on up ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Up ahead, cars and vans and trucks and semi-trailers had begun
to slide and pinwheel on the black ice and snow on I-29. A semi
tractor-trailer hauling potatoes tried to dodge the swerving
vehicles and jackknifed, skidding sideways, finally stopping and
blocking the interstate.
</P>
<P>
   More cars and trucks followed, drivers blinded by the flying
snow, able to see nothing but brake lights.
</P>
<P>
   A second tractor trailer truck driver told Joe Maddick,
assistant director with the Northland Regional Ambulance District,
that he heard of the initial pileup on his CB radio and began to
slow down.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he could see the semi cross ways and he was able to
stop about 30 to 40 yards short of the tractor trailer,'' Maddick
said. ``He said he started feeling people hitting his trailer and
then saw another tractor-trailer coming over the hill. He said it
was obvious it was not going to be able to stop, so he drove his
truck about 50 yards off the roadway.''
</P>
<P>
   The approaching semi crashed into the pile of already wrecked
vehicles, squashing them against the truck jackknifed across the
road. The impact punctured gas tanks and a fire began. Stoked by
the leaking gas, the blaze blossomed, its flames leaping 50 feet
into the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, more cars and trucks were crashing into the second
semi, which was hauling cleaning supplies. The supplies included 80
pounds of diluted hydrochloric acid. Those vehicles caught fire.
Two other semis swerved across the median into the northbound lanes
to avoid the fiery mess. Other vehicles slid into the median or off
the shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Then more crashes. On the embankment next to I-29, a pickup
smashed into a tractor-trailer and became wedged beneath it,
crushing the cab's roof and trapping the driver. It took
firefighters an hour to free him. He was treated at a hospital and
released.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to miss the wreck, a grandfather from Florida drove off
the interstate. His car overturned and he was killed.
</P>
<P>
   When the accident began, Willard Wiley was tending his antique
store at the interchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``We heard a banging sound out there, and it sounded like
thunder in here,'' Wiley said. ``I went outside...(and) saw a
semitruck coming up the grassy area and I knew something was
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Black smoke rose from the wrecks. There were explosions.
</P>
<P>
   It was then Laura Purkey managed to stop her car and get out.
MAST units were already there and she ran to one to grab supplies
and help the man trapped under the semi-trailer.
</P>
<P>
   MAST field supervisor Eric Dooley said the terrain may have
contributed to the wreck's severity.
</P>
<P>
   ``You crest the hill and boom, there it was,'' he said. ``By the
time you saw a wreck, you were in it.''
</P>
<P>
   The scene looked like a war zone. Flames shot up from the
twisted and melting metal. Rescuers watched in horror as victims
burned in their vehicles. Other victims _ dazed and shaken _
staggered in the swirling snow.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the worst traffic accident scene I have ever been at
in my 33 year career,'' said Sgt. Jack McMillen of the Missouri
Highway Patrol. ``It looked like someone dropped a bomb on the
interstate.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten would die in the fire and wreckage. Officials said those
involved in the wreck either died or had only minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Nine of the ten victims were burned beyond recognition, caught
in the fireball between the semis. Authorities were able to
tentatively identify eight of the dead through evidence left in
their vehicles. Five were Springfield residents returning from
weekend trip in Nebraska; two were from the Dakotas heading back to
college in Bolivar, Mo.; and one was the Florida grandfather in
town for his 16-year-old grandson's birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities had few clues to identify the other two victims
because their bodies and vehicles were burned so completely.
</P>
<P>
   McMillen said the patrol requested dental records from the
families of the eight tentatively-identified persons and flew the
records into town Monday to try to positively identify the victims.
The process could take several days, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Causes of death were not available Monday. McMillen said it
appeared some of the victims died instantly but others likely
burned to death in the wreck.
</P>
<P>
   The fire prevented the rescue of any of the badly hurt victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``They couldn't get out of their vehicles themselves and no one
could get to them to help them,'' McMillen said. ``One citizen told
me he tried to get people out but was driven back by the fire. The
victims didn't have a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Steve Johnson of the Platte County Sheriff's Department
saw people trying to help others escape their vehicles, despite the
flames and occasional explosions from tires and fuel tanks.
</P>
<P>
   Rescue workers described the initial minutes after the crash as
chaotic and a scene from ``Hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Central Platte Fire Chief Larry Bigus said firefighters ``were
climbing on cars, putting out fires and we could see bodies inside.
And you think about how there was nothing you could do to help
anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Camden Point Fire Chief Jeff Zion, holding a fire
hose, clambered onto the top of the burning tractor-trailor that
contained hydrochloric acid. The concussion from an explosion,
possibly a drum within the truck, blew him backward off the vehicle
but into the arms of a West Platte firefighter.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters fought the blaze for about an hour. There are no
fire hydrants along the interstate so tankers had to haul water to
the scene. Most of the firefighters were volunteers, working the
worst accident they had ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're dealing with your emotions,'' said Walt Stubbs, chief
of the Camden Point Fire Protection District, ``wanting to sit
there and throw up, or just turn around and walk away from it.''

   MEXICAN RETAIL GROUP BUYS REMAINDER OF COMPUSA
</P>
<P>
   A retail group controlled by Carlos Slim Helu, the Mexican
billionaire, said it was buying CompUSA, the U.S. chain of
personal-computer stores, marking one of the biggest Mexican
purchases of a prominent U.S. business. Slim's retailing chain,
Grupo Sanborn, already owns 14.8 percent of the common shares in
CompUSA, a Dallas-based network of computer stores that has been
struggling with losses and declining sales.
</P>
<P>
   It is part of a drive to transform Telefonos de Mexico, the
formerly state-owned telephone company that is controlled by Slim
and is his flagship business, into a fast-paced, Web-savvy
multinational giant.
</P>
<P>
   RALLYING AROUND BEN &AMP; JERRY'S CHAIN
</P>
<P>
   A group of Ben &AMP; Jerry's ice-cream shop owners plans to rally in
various cities Tuesday to protest what they say is the threat that
a corporate takeover would pose to the company's image of social
responsibility. Last month the company announced that it had
received ``indications of interest'' from an unidentified company.
Ben &AMP; Jerry's Homemade, which was founded by Ben Cohen and Jerry
Greenfield, said at the time that the offer was subject to
conditions but that its board would consider it.
</P>
<P>
   BBDO OFFICE REVAMPS MANAGEMENT
</P>
<P>
   The ranks of top managers at the flagship New York office of
BBDO Worldwide, the largest agency in the Omnicom Group, are being
revamped in an effort to identify the next generation of leadership
and increase the attention paid to important tasks like landing
more clients and broadening offerings beyond traditional
advertising forums.
</P>
<P>
   INSURER'S STOCK PLAN QUESTIONED
</P>
<P>
   A handful of policyholders of Metropolitan Life Insurance argued
that the proposed terms for the company's conversion to ownership
by stockholders from ownership by policyholders were unfair. Under
the plan, policyholders are to be given shares representing their
contribution to company profits in exchange for their ownership
stake in the company.
</P>
<P>
   EVENT TICKETS FROM A HOME PRINTER
</P>
<P>
   Ticketmaster-Online CitySearch said that beginning in April it
would allow customers to print tickets to events directly from
their computer printers.
</P>
<P>
   MARKS &AMP; SPENCER NAMES CHAIRMAN
</P>
<P>
   Marks &AMP; Spencer, Britain's august but ailing retailer, broke
with a long tradition and reached beyond the nation's shores to
hire a new executive chairman, offering a $22 million package to
lure the Belgian-born Luc Vandevelde from Promodes, a leading
grocery chain based in France.
</P>
<P>
   KODAK POSTS PROFIT OF $475 MILLION
</P>
<P>
   Eastman Kodak said it earned $475 million in the fourth quarter,
exceeding analysts' forecasts and setting off a rally in its stock
price, which jumped $1.3125, to $62.0625. The company's
fourth-quarter sales totaled $3.8 billion. Losses in Kodak's
digital business narrowed to $17 million from $91 million.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic and BellSouth said strong demand for data,
wireless and telephone features lifted their fourth-quarter profits
to meet or beat Wall Street expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Bristol-Myers Squibb's fourth-quarter profit rose 16 percent as
sales rose for its diabetes, heart disease and cancer treatments.
</P>
<P>
   MORGAN STANLEY IS FINED
</P>
<P>
   The brokerage firm Morgan Stanley was censured and fined
$495,000 by a self-regulatory brokers' group for manipulating the

   GATES FOUNDATION GETS $5 BILLION
</P>
<P>
   The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation said that Bill Gates, the
billionaire founder of Microsoft, and his wife have donated $5
billion to their philanthropic foundation, making it the world's
wealthiest foundation, with assets of $21.8 billion. A spokesman
for the foundation said it gave about $800 million last year and
made commitments of over $2 billion.

<P>
   Many of the burned victims were unrecognizable beyond general
size and shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got all the patients that could go to the hospital
out,'' Robert O'Dell, Deputy Chief of the Central Platte Fire
Protection District, said. ``We've got the fire out...Now we've got
to start extrication of dead people. That's when it really starts
to take its toll.''
</P>
<P>
   Many rescuers arrived as the fire was began to dwindle.
``Walking-wounded,'' victims with minor cuts and scratches,
wandered around the interstate. Some waited in Wiley's antique
mall. Others sat in the warmed cars of those caught in the traffic
jam.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone seemed scared to death because of the fire,'' Maddick
said. ``In a normal accident, people stay in their cars, but these
people got out and ran as far as they could. I don't blame them.
The fire was absolutely intense.''
</P>
<P>
   The fire fused many of the crashed vehicles. It took workers
hours to pry them apart.
</P>
<P>
   Four victims went by ambulance to area hospitals, but others got
their own rides. Ambulances were scarce because of countless other
wrecks in the area, including an unrelated 20-car pileup north and
east of Platte City. No one was seriously hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Rescue workers said the wreck could have been avoided or
minimized if motorists had slowed down during snow storms.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was to point blame, it would be the speed,'' Maddick
said. ``People in four-wheel drives especially, have a false sense
of security. That's not going to help them from sliding.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bishop, executive director of the Northland Regional
Ambulance District, said people are unrealistic if they think they
can stop a 2,000- pound car in a few feet in a snow storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're doing 45 mph, you're not going to realize your
brakes aren't grabbing until you need to stop,'' Bishop said. ``And
then it's too late.''
</P>
<P>
   The snowstorm caught Missouri Department of Transportation
officials off-guard. Streets were not treated until after the
deadly crash.
</P>
<P>
   With unseasonably warm temperatures on Saturday and a weather
forecast Sunday that only called for light snow, MoDot officials
said they were not expecting any pavement to reach freezing
temperatures until Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
   But freeze they did. The area reported about 800 wrecks Sunday
with dozens of people injured.
</P>
<P>
   The fatal pileup was just one of at least five separate
multi-vehicle wrecks within a four-mile section of I-29 on Sunday
afternoon, stretching from the Platte River to the rest area at
mile marker 27.
</P>
<P>
   No serious injuries were reported in the other accidents, which
officials attributed to blowing snow and icy pavement. But three
Camden Point firefighters were treated for injuries. One of their
trucks was rammed from behind on I-29 by a motorist who could not
stop. Another Camden Point fire vehicle left a county road and
rolled over in the a ditch to avoid a collision.
</P>
<P>
   MoDot began calling in crews around 1 p.m. But by the time crews
were ready to hit the roads, the Platte City crash and other
serious pileups had already occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``We responded very quickly.'' said Warren Roberts, MoDot's area
engineer for Platte and Clay counties, ``Unfortunately, some of the
roads turned icy before we could get to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Staff Writers Mike Mansur, Mike Rice and Shawna Hamel

A CALM VERMEIL TURNS HIS BACK ON A TENSE PAST
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Dick Vermeil knows the enduring image he left behind
when he last coached in the Super Bowl nearly two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Half wet blanket, half drill sergeant, Vermeil wound his
Philadelphia Eagles so tight in the week before Super Bowl XV in
1981 that they played panicky and tense.
</P>
<P>
   In a game set in New Orleans, the loose and rambunctious Oakland
Raiders _ who unlike Vermeil's Eagles relished the carnival
atmosphere and flouted the notion of curfew _ romped in a laugher.
</P>
<P>
   That is at least the favored, historical story line of the
Raiders' 27-10 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Monday evening, arriving in Atlanta for Super Bowl XXXIV as
coach of the St. Louis Rams, Vermeil neither disputed nor conceded
past mistakes in the curious setting of pro football's
season-ending game, where entertainment meets military-style
preparations.
</P>
<P>
   But in his first news conference, he announced: ``I don't have
any curfews scheduled.''
</P>
<P>
   Just in case anyone has a vision of Vermeil at midnight dashing
around Atlanta with a lamp shade on his head, consider this:
</P>
<P>
   Vermeil's coaching staff did not even accompany the team to
Atlanta for the beginning of the Super Bowl festivities. The
coaches are back in St. Louis preparing the Rams' game plan for
Sunday's game with the Tennessee Titans.
</P>
<P>
   That's because Vermeil, 19 years removed from the week that has
come to define the discipline-driven excesses of his previous
coaching tenure, is still trying to figure out ways to make the
Super Bowl more like a regular-season game.
</P>
<P>
   Because his staff usually maps out the game plan on Monday and
Tuesday each week in the Rams' suburban St. Louis offices, the
coaches are doing it again this week.
</P>
<P>
   Vermeil's coaches will arrive here late Tuesday night, hours
before they deliver the game plan on Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like this was the best way to keep our normal
routine,'' Vermeil said. ``Football coaches are famous creatures of
habit, and we feel very insecure outside of our usual routines.''
</P>
<P>
   So Vermeil is willing to do some things differently the second
time around, though he's only going so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am much more relaxed this time and more mature,'' a smiling
and easygoing Vermeil said moments after his team arrived at its
Atlanta hotel. ``I remember being wound up in a lot of knots at
this point in my last Super Bowl. Hopefully, this is a little
better approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Vermeil would not go so far as to admit that his nervousness
made his 1980-81 Eagles nervous, and he even seemed to discount it
at one point.
</P>
<P>
   ``To think the Raiders won that game because we were extremely
disciplined and wanted to send a great image about what we were all
about to America,'' Vermeil said, ``I don't think that's right.''
</P>
<P>
   But Vermeil also did not run from the characterization that he
might have created an atmosphere that was too rigid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if my players could sense that I was wound up,''
Vermeil said. ``Whenever you lose a game like that, whatever you
did was wrong. For the rest of your life it's what you did wrong.
I've learned to live with that.
</P>
<P>
   ``That week, I just told them that anybody who was going out and
getting in trouble, I was going to send them home. It's a business
trip. This is a business trip. I don't expect there to be any
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The few Rams who were available to reporters after their trip to
Atlanta on Monday night did not believe that they needed reminders
from Vermeil about their nighttime conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect guys to lock themselves in their rooms,''
linebacker London Fletcher said. ``Guys will go out. But they'll be
careful.''
</P>
<P>
   Said running back Marshall Faulk: ``I don't see something like
that as being any kind of issue in this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Told that it was a primary topic 19 years ago, Faulk replied:
``Nineteen years is a long time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA POINTS:
</P>
<P>
   Rams Coach Dick Vermeil said he did not expect any players to
miss Sunday's game because of injury. That included place-kicker
Jeff Wilkins, who has a sore knee and who missed a 44-yard field
goal in the National Football Conference championship game.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams had considered signing kicker Nick Lowery last week,
but Vermeil believed Wilkins could kick through his injury _ and
still thinks so. ``His injury is no excuse for missing a field
goal,'' Vermeil said. ``If I thought so, I'd take a guy off the
streets. Jeff's leg is probably better now than it was yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   Vermeil said he did not expect to have two kickers on his roster
for Sunday's game, but if he did, he would most likely sign Lowery.
</P>
<P>
   He said that right defensive end Fred Miller also had a sore
knee, but he did not expect it to affect Miller's play
significantly.
</P>
<P>
   Vermeil, 63, also declined to discuss whether he was considering
retirement from coaching, especially if his Rams win Sunday.

WHITMAN'S NEW JERSEY BUDGET IS BIGGER, WITH TAX CUTS TOO
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By DAVID M. HALBFINGER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Saying New Jersey's sustained economic boom and
the state's mounting surpluses had created an ``unprecedented
opportunity,'' Gov. Christie Whitman proposed her most generous
budget yet on Monday, a $21.2 billion plan that increases spending
by $1.3 billion for a host of new programs, tax cuts and ambitious
school and highway construction projects.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman, a Republican, asserted that her spending plan, which
she titled a ``Prosperity Dividend,'' would actually strengthen her
record as a fiscal conservative. She boasted that she had
completely eliminated so-called one-shot revenues and that her
budget would leave yet another record surplus while keeping the
average yearly growth in spending during her two terms to the
lowest level of any governor in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   The governor, who likes to remind voters how often she has
lowered or eliminated taxes, proposed three new tax cuts on Monday,
including an earned income tax credit for which nearly 280,000
residents would be eligible. Under the program, families earning
$15,000 would receive a $338 check.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, and in case anyone's counting, it will make for tax cut
No. 40,'' Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor also proposed a two-year suspension of employees'
contribution to unemployment insurance, which now is capped at
$42.40 a year each, as well as the employers' share, which ranges
from $440 for a small business to $44,000 for a large company. The
state's unemployment insurance fund, has ballooned to the nation's
third largest, at $2.9 billion, enough to pay for two and a half
years of anticipated benefits without any additional collections.
</P>
<P>
   Acting to shore up the area in which she has been most
vulnerable to criticism _ her propensity to borrow _ Whitman called
for a new fund to begin to retire the state's debt. But she set
aside no money in her budget for that purpose, and Democrats
roundly criticized her proposal as disingenuous.
</P>
<P>
   ``This budget is the latest exercise in spending for an
administration that has never seen a line of credit it didn't
like,'' said the Assembly minority leader, Joseph Doria, a
Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   There was real money in the budget, however, for a broad array
of constituencies: $70 million for health insurance for the working
poor and $55 million for the disabled, $100 million for hospitals
and more than $45 million for colleges, $25 million for high-tech
entrepreneurs and $10 million for cancer researchers, to name a
few.
</P>
<P>
   Immediate complaints came only from those who got something but
wanted still more. A coalition of antismoking groups known as New
Jersey Breathes lamented that Whitman had only allocated $30
million for tobacco prevention efforts. ``We're shocked,'' the
group's chairman, Paul Wallner, said, adding that an additional $15
million could make New Jersey's program as effective as any in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The budget includes two long-awaited capital programs, and each
entails an important concession to a Republican contender to
succeed Whitman as governor. She proposed to spend $9.4 billion to
rebuild the state's crumbling schools, including $5 billion for
inner-city districts to comply with a court order. But she agreed
to a demand by the Assembly speaker, Jack Collins, a likely
candidate for governor, that she set aside $100 million to finance
such construction from the $300 million a year in anticipated
receipts from the nationwide tobacco settlement. The governor had
sought to reserve the tobacco money for health care programs.
</P>
<P>
   In her speech on Monday, Whitman sounded a note of caution about
the tobacco money, which is certain to come under pressure from
lawmakers during the budget negotiation process, which by law and
tradition must end with passage of an appropriations law before the
end of June.
</P>
<P>
   ``With $7.4 billion over the next 25 years, we have to set a
good example _ avoid the raid-the-cookie-jar mentality _ and spend
this money responsibly,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Education lobbyists praised the governor's concession, saying a
stable source of revenue was needed to pay for such an ambitious
statewide construction effort. But Whitman's budget acknowledges
that after five years, additional revenue sources will be needed to
generate annual increases of $50 million in debt service costs.
</P>
<P>
   The governor also proposed a refinancing of the state's depleted
transportation trust fund to pay for $1 billion in new projects
each year.

SHORTER LEAD-IN TIME HAS POSITIVES, NEGATIVES

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Without the customary two-week break between the NFL
conference championship games and the Super Bowl, those inclined to
weighty analysis will bombard you in the upcoming days with
insufferably tedious opinions on what effect the briefer interlude
will have on the participants.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I don't think the outcome of Super Bowl XXXIV between
the St. Louis Rams and Tennessee Titans or the tone of the
proceedings would be any different if it were played on Feb. 6 at
the Georgia Dome instead of Sunday when the game to end all games
for hype, ticket scalping and crass commercialization will be
staged.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, perhaps the Titans' star receiver, Yancey Thigpen, nursing a
bum foot, would be healthier in two weeks, but I'm not sure his
status will determine the ultimate fate of his team.
</P>
<P>
   And I'm sure a 14-day layoff would have given the owner of the
Rams, Georgia Frontiere, a greater opportunity to undergo one of
her celebrated nip and tuck cosmetic makeovers in London before
making her grand Super Bowl appearance at a stadium that was not,
contrary to propaganda now being disseminated by her PR minions,
named after her for her Mother Teresa contributions to humankind.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's indisputable that the shorter break will have a
dramatic impact both positive and negative on peripheral
developments affiliated with the Super Bowl:
</P>
<P>
   Positive: Blessedly, we'll only have to endure a week of the
Georgia Frontiere Story, a heart-warming saga that reached its
watershed moment on April 1, 1979, when her sixth husband, Carroll
Rosenbloom, ran afoul of a riptide in the Atlantic Ocean off the
coast of Florida, which resulted in Georgia inheriting the Rams.
</P>
<P>
   Negative: America's most enduring entrepreneurs, ticket brokers,
won't have their usual cushy two weeks to procure and move their
precious commodities.
</P>
<P>
   Positive: We will be spared 14 consecutive days of shameless
self-promotion by Fox Sports of the All-Madden team, named in honor
of a once entertaining fellow who's been retired for years even
though he and those still propping him up on the Fox network aren't
aware of such a fact.
</P>
<P>
   Negative: Investigative reporters won't have enough time to do
an in-depth piece on Dominic Frontiere, Georgia's one-time hubbie
who did a stretch in the federal pen for income tax evasion growing
out of a Super Bowl scandal in which the only dots ol' loyal Dom
connected were to himself.
</P>
<P>
   Positive: The phoniest soothsayers this side of your friendly
neighborhood palm reader, football handicappers, will have only a
short time to con their gullible customers with their ``sure winner
selections'' even though the only surefire thing in the NFL these
days is for the referee to blow at least one important instant
replay call a game.
</P>
<P>
   Negative: The Super Bowl players won't have the two-week luxury
to sit on their tickets and wait for the prices to skyrocket out of
sight. Why, some might become so disillusioned that they might even
be moved to actually share their ticket allotment this time with
family members beyond mom and dad and even with some old high
school chums.
</P>
<P>
   Positive: America's most fiercely original thinkers, radio disc
jockeys, will shockingly all come up with the same enlightened idea
of reviving one of the great disco songs of all time, Rick James'
``Super Freak'', in tribute to the Titans' extraordinary 6-5,
265-pound rookie defensive end, Jevon Kearse, whose nickname is The
Freak.
</P>
<P>
   Negative: Reporters will be in a mad scramble to come up with
exotic angles and some inevitably will extricate from well-deserved
obscurity Buddy Ryan, Mike Ditka's one-time sparring partner with
the Chicago Bears who would have you believe he invented the art of
coaching football. You see, the Tennessee head coach, Jeff Fisher,
once served as Ryan's assistant for five seasons with the
Philadelphia Eagles, although Fisher somehow avoided picking up
Ryan's egotistical habits.
</P>
<P>
   Positive: One of the most unsteady quarterback performances in
recent playoff history Tampa Bay's Shaun King's wobbly labors
against the Rams will be quickly forgotten, much to the benefit of
King's psyche. If the Rams were true sportsmen, they should give
Mr. King a share of their Super Bowl earnings because they'd have
never made it to Atlanta without his invaluable assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Negative: One of the fabled coaching jobs in all seasons of the
NFL Tony Dungy's masterpiece with a Tampa Bay team that came within
an eyelash of upsetting the Rams even though it endured under the
daunting handicap of operating with a sandlot player at quarterback
will be blithely overlooked because of time limitations.
</P>
<P>
   Positive: We'll only be subjected a brief while with the Bud
Adams Story, a stirring narration about a spoiled son of a Texas
millionaire oilman who played a vital role in changing the
landscape of professional sports in 1960 when he and the Kansas
City Chiefs' Lamar Hunt started a fledging enterprise called the
American Football League. Adams might now be a hero in Tennessee,
but the Titans' owner remains a despised figure in Texas for moving
the Oilers out of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Negative: John Shaw, Georgia Frontiere's notorious financial
hitman who choreographed the Rams' scandalous dissipation in
Southern California, will have a greater opportunity to hide from
his critics.
</P>
<P>
   Positive: Dick Vermeil, a control freak by nature, won't have
that extra week to keep the media from prying on his players.

<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas won a clear
victory in the Iowa Republican caucuses on Monday night, but his
two closest competitors, Steve Forbes and Alan Keyes, who both
appealed to religious conservatives, drew strong support in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Returns in the Democratic contest, between Vice President Al
Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley, were slower to come in.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, Bush, a two-term Texas governor in his
first try for national office, surpassed the 37 percent record that
Bob Dole drew in a six-candidate field in Iowa in 1988, a number
that Bush had said was his goal.
</P>
<P>
   Declaring victory based on early tallies barely an hour after
the caucuses began across the state, Bush said in a television
interview, ``I am thrilled with this record-shattering victory. I
am grateful and I'm humbled.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``My message of compassionate conservatism resonated
loud. The people of Iowa want a leader who can unite our party and
our country _ and that's exactly the signal they have sent.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, the wealthy magazine publisher who had pumped millions
from his family fortune into the race here, finished a strong
second place, roughly tripling the 10 percent he drew here four
years ago. Alan Keyes, a former State Department official, ranked a
distant third, outpacing Gary Bauer, the prominent religious
conservative, Sen. John McCain of Arizona and Sen. Orrin G. Hatch
of Utah.
</P>
<P>
   McCain did not compete here, preferring to concentrate his
campaign in New Hampshire, where the nation's first primary will be
held Feb. 1. McCain is neck and neck with Bush in the polls there.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year, Bush has towered over the Republican field
because of his record-breaking fund-raising, impressive poll
numbers and vast endorsements. Monday night, for the first time,
actual voters affirmed his position as front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   While Forbes had long been viewed as Bush's toughest competitor
here, Keyes' showing was particularly striking because he has run a
low-budget campaign and many Republican had dismissed him as more a
protest candidate than a serious vote-getter. But he drew
particular attention for his stand-out role in many of the
Republican debates.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent victory for Gore was important for the vice
president because he and Bradley were locked in an aggressive,
competitive race here.
</P>
<P>
   Though Iowa has been at the epicenter of American politics, the
results are far from a reliable indicator of who will end up at the
White House _ or even win the first primary in New Hampshire next
week.
</P>
<P>
   The last candidate to win a contested caucus and be elected
president was Jimmy Carter in 1976. In 1988, the eventual nominees,
Michael S. Dukakis and George Bush, placed third in the caucuses.
The two victors, Dick Gephardt and Bob Dole, had quit the race by
the end of March.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, there was no contested Democratic race. Dole won
the Republican caucuses, but he was followed closely by Pat
Buchanan, who then triumphed in New Hampshire but lost the
nomination to Dole. In recent years, the voting here has been more
important for narrowing the field.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Many other states have derided Iowa for all the attention that
it draws from the contenders, and from the press, because the state
is overwhelmingly white and not particularly representative of the
nation. Of the 1.8 million registered voters in Iowa, no more than
200,000 had been expected to participate Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, those who participate are not especially
representative even of Iowa. They are among the more politically
active residents and they tend to be the more conservative or
liberal members of their party. To a large measure, the outcome
reflects the organizational prowess of candidates and interest
groups in prodding people to give up a Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
   But the caucuses have become high profile events because the
national press covers them heavily, which in turn prompts the
candidates to spend more time here.
</P>
<P>
   The caucuses started at 7 p.m., when residents went to schools,
church basements, meeting halls and private homes across the state.
The voting marked only the beginning of a months-long process of
selecting delegates to the Republican and Democratic conventions,
where the nominees would actually be chosen. The Republican vote
was merely a straw poll and would have little impact on the
selection of actual delegates to the convention, who will be chosen
at county conventions, congressional district conventions and state
conventions.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For the Democrats, the voting Monday night will have more
influence on the selection of actual delegates. Iowa would
eventually account for 56 of the party's 4,337 convention
delegates. The state will send 25 of the 2,169 delegates to the
Republican convention.
</P>
<P>
   For months _ years in some cases _ Iowa has served as a second
home for many candidates. They poured millions of dollars into
television commercials, and they campaigned from hog farms to high
schools, making their pitches to a relatively tiny number of
voters. Even before the intense campaigning of the past month,
Forbes had ben here 69 days; Bradley, 62 days; Bauer, 54 days;
Keyes, 51 days; Gore, 35 days; and Bush, 19 days. This was the
first time since 1988 that both parties had competitive contests.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Before Iowans voted, the contenders devoted one last day to
trying to persuade and cajole the undecided and the uncommitted.
Bush got an early start, striding into a restaurant here at 7:45
Monday morning and competing with eggs and pastries for the
attention of the scattered diners.
</P>
<P>
   ``No rest for a while,'' he told a diner. ``It's like running a
marathon. I ran a marathon in 1993, and it just requires patience
and discipline and focus, and this is mile six.''
</P>
<P>
   At a subsequent stop in Ames, where he delivered a speech at
Iowa State University, Bush was upbeat and folksy, offering a
homespun riff on how hard it has been to spend so many days on the
campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss the cats,'' he said. ``They don't miss me. I miss the
dog. She does miss me.'' But his playfulness had its limits. When
the documentary filmmaker, Michael Moore _ who has been traveling
through Iowa with a ``mosh pit'' in which people roll around _
asked Bush to participate, the governor said, ``Behave yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes spent his last day pretty much as always _ with a heavy
dose of radio interviews on conservative programs. By 3 p.m., he
had appeared on 20 radio programs and 14 television programs.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters as he campaigned with two of his five
daughters, Forbes asserted that he was the leading conservative in
the field.
</P>
<P>
   Gore on Monday played down reports that he used marijuana more
extensively in his mid-20s than he has admitted. Asked whether he
had smoked marijuana almost daily in the early 1970s, Gore told the
NBC affiliate here, KWQC, ``No, when I came back from Vietnam, yes,
but not to that extent. This is something I dealt with a longtime
ago _ it's old news.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president, who is 51, added: ``When I was young, I did
things young people do. When I grew up, I put away childish
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley held his only public event at Iowa State University,
where he told several hundred students and faculty members that
politics in America had lost touch with the needs of ``real''
people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Politics to too many young people, to too many Americans, has
become nothing other than tactics,'' Bradley said. ``It's become
tactics and not belief. It's become spin and not truth. It's become
fund-raising and not reaching out to people where they live their
lives. It has become all of the things that are artificial in our
country.''

CANDIDATES HEAD EAST AS FEW SURPRISES DEVELOP IN IOWA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH AND CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES _ Republican George W. Bush held off three socially
conservative challengers while Democrat Al Gore easily won his race
over Bill Bradley in the Iowa caucuses Monday. But the first vote
of Campaign 2000 was barely concluded before the candidates set
their sights on New Hampshire, where the contests are expected to
be much tighter and the impact of the Iowa outcomes uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the front-runner here for many months, benefited from a
large field in which social conservatives demonstrated their clout
but split their vote. With 62 percent of precincts reporting, Bush
received 42 percent, millionaire publisher Steve Forbes had 29
percent and talk-show host Alan Keyes blew past his conservative
peers for a striking third-place showing of 14 percent. Former
Reagan aide Gary Bauer was in fourth place with 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Senator John McCain of Arizona, who had been tied for third in
the most recent poll, was trailing in fifth place with 5 percent,
apparently the victim of his decision to bypass this state in favor
of focusing most of his attention on New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah was in sixth place with 1 percent
and is expected to drop out of the race shortly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a record-shattering victory,'' Bush said, beaming to
reporters in a hotel suite.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, which results were reported much more
slowly than the GOP, initial returns and entrance polls showed Gore
winning by a two-to-one victory over Bradley, similar to the margin
predicted in pre-caucus polls.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, the former New Jersey senator who poured nearly $2
million into this state, quickly turned his attention to the
Granite State, where he led Gore in some polls until recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``The longer the competition goes, the better chance that
candidate is going to have,'' Bradley said earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who didn't actively campaign here, leads Bush in some
New Hampshire polls and Monday conducted his 100th town meeting in
the state, underscoring the extraordinary lengths to which the
Arizonan is basing his strategy on winning the first primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``People of New Hampshire don't pay a great deal of attention to
what happens in Iowa,'' McCain said, hopeful that his risky
decision to skip Iowa was the right strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, who had barely stopped campaigning in Iowa since
dropping out of the 1996 Republican contest, boldly predicted that
his showing here would enable him and McCain to grab the top two
spots in New Hampshire, with Bush coming in third place.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, meanwhile, hoped to deliver a knockout blow to Bradley,
who until recently has been leading in the New Hampshire polls.
While presidential candidates often seek a ``bounce'' from Iowa,
the reverse often occurs. Bradley, who poured substantial time and
resources into Iowa in hopes of a strong showing here, has even
higher stakes in New Hampshire, where he is well-known from his
days as a New York Knicks player and prominent senator.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa officials said they expected 100,000 people each at the
Republican and Democratic caucuses out of the state's 1.8 million
registered voters. Caucus voters meet at more than 2000 sites,
large and small, across the state.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Gore planned to wrap up their victory parties with
middle-of-the-night flights from Iowa to the first primary state of
New Hampshire, planning to uphold a tradition of 3 a.m. rallies at
the Manchester airport and bleary-eyed appearances on the early
morning television shows. All of the campaigns readied for a solid
week of campaigning in the Granite State, accompanied by hundreds
of reporters and thousands of campaign workers.
</P>
<P>
   With tight races in both parties, the week ahead promises to be
another great adventure in American politics, in a state whose
voters, from the Seacoast to the White Mountains, revel in their
opportunity to second-guess the results from Iowa and putting their
outsized imprint on the presidential contest.
</P>
<P>
   While New Hampshire's on-and-off tendency to overturn the caucus
outcome is often viewed as ``contrarian,'' the state is different
in many fundamental ways from Iowa. In Iowa, the major issues are
farm policy, abortion and other social issues, with relatively few
Independents taking part in causes geared to party members. Only 10
percent to 25 percent of registered voters in Iowa were expected to
participate in the caucuses. In New Hampshire, the major issues are
taxation, education and a libertarian outlook, with Independents
expected to participate heavily in a primary that is likely to have
a 70 percent turnout.
</P>
<P>
   In a decades-old tradition, Iowans assembled in high schools,
church basements and farmhouses across the state to meet in
caucuses and declare their presidential preferences. In a process
dominated by activists on the extremes of both parties, Iowans
typically met for two hours with their neighbors, snacked on
cookies or cake, and debated the issues and the candidates. More
than 800 journalists, many of them on campaign buses or a caravan
of satellite trucks, spread the news to a global audience.
</P>
<P>
   In the hours before the evening caucuses, the candidates made
one final dash across the state.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, whose campaign was widely portrayed as being in disarray
just a few months ago, held a consistent lead in the polls during
the last several weeks. But he headed into caucus day insisting he
was taking nothing for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not counting my chickens before they're hatched,'' he said
Monday morning in Davenport, where he shook hands with diners and
ate fried chicken at the Iowa Machine Shed, a restaurant known for
its pork.
</P>
<P>
   In Cedar Rapids, Gore paid his third visit of his presidential
campaign to George Washington Senior High, where he showed off his
pair of new boots, decried cynicism in American politics and
challenged students to get involved. ``If you don't like the
candidates who are running, run yourself,'' he said at one point.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley spent the day looking as much toward New Hampshire as he
did the caucuses. In his only campaign stop of the day, Bradley
appeared at Iowa State University in Ames, with two of his top
supporters, Senators Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and Paul D. Wellstone
of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   After struggling for several days to regain his stride amid the
fallout from his disclosure last week that he had suffered four
abnormal heart rhythms since he sought medical care for an
irregularity in December, Bradley appeared reinvigorated.
</P>
<P>
   He reaffirmed his belief that his showing in the caucuses would
''surprise some people,'' though he clearly had begun to focus on
the next battle, in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, sounding tired but optimistic in light of his popularity
in the polls, spent the day campaigning near Des Moines, driving to
a restaurant for coffee in the morning before giving speeches in
Ames and Perry.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech at Iowa State University in Ames, he said the Iowa
caucuses were not just ``the beginning of the decision of who ought
to carry our message.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's also the beginning of the end of the Clinton era in
Washington, D.C.,'' Bush said, drawing enormous applause.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes spent much of the day conducting more than 20 local radio
and television interviews, as his campaign aides anticipated a
strong showing that could give him momentum in New Hampshire,
separate him from the crowded bottom of the Republican pack, and
establish him as the conservative alternative to the more moderate
Bush and McCain.
</P>
<P>
   With his campaign manager predicting a showing in the
''mid-twenties,'' the millionaire publisher also sought votes
during a stop at Scruffy's Pizza &AMP; Deli in Des Moines.
</P>
<P>
   On a street corner outside the restaurant Forbes told said he
expected a strong showing Monday night, but boasted that he has
already influenced the GOP debate. Forbes said his 17 percent
flat-tax proposal had forced Bush to offer a bigger tax cut than
planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never would have seen even the tax proposal he put on the
table had it not been for my being in the race and hammering on the
issue,'' Forbes said.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes spent most of the morning doing what he is best known for
-- talking on the radio at one local station after another. He was
scheduled to do it again later that night, this time on national
TV, after stopping in at several caucuses for a last push before
the vote. Bauer hoped that his campaign organization, heavily based
on church leaders, would result in a heavy turnout.
</P>
<P>
   The caucuses brought an end to a long, preliminary campaign in
Iowa that began three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, there were as many as a dozen candidates for the
Republican nomination. The results of the 1996 presidential
election had barely been tabulated when Lamar Alexander, who
finished third in the last Iowa caucus, returned to the state to
recruit several prominent Republicans and set up shop again. Other
candidates made early exploratory visits.
</P>
<P>
   But an elaborate straw poll conducted by the Iowa Republican
Party last summer effectively chased half of the hopefuls from the
race six months before the first formal votes could be cast.
</P>
<P>
   Bolstered by a bulging bank account and the support of much of
the party establishment, Bush took charge at the mid-summer event.
He won 30 percent of the 24,500 straw ballots, finishing well ahead
of Forbes, who used his own personal wealth to finance an operation
that wound up with 20 percent of the votes at the Ames gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Daunted by Bush's strength and their own lack of money, a number
of candidates quickly dropped out. Alexander, Ohio Rep. John
Kasich, former Vice President Dan Quayle, and New Hampshire Sen.
Bob Smith left the race. In the fall, Patrick Buchanan quit the GOP
to pursue the Reform Party nomination. Elizabeth Dole eventually
gave up her ambitions and endorsed Bush earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Only Hatch, a candidate with more government experience than any
of his rivals, seemed strangely detached from the debate among
Christian conservatives. With defeat closing in on him, the Mormon
senator from Utah had a mournful complaint.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some in the Christian community who do not believe
Mormons are Christians,'' he said. ``The name of my church is Jesus
Christ of the Latter Day Saints, so how in the world can that not
be Christian?''

AFTER SCORING IN IOWA, A QUICK FLIGHT TO N.H. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES _ Governor George W. Bush was looking forward to one
thing Monay night. And it wasn't the caucus results.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Iowa caucuses even began, the Texas governor and his
aides were predicting his victory and thinking ahead to the Feb. 1
New Hampshire primary and beyond _ speaking in confident terms, and
even anticipating the end of the campaigns of Bush's two chief
competitors, Senator John McCain of Arizona and millionaire
publisher Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the beginning of the decision of who ought to carry our
message,'' Bush told a rally in the afternoon. ``It's also the
beginning of the end of the Clinton era in Washington, D.C.''
</P>
<P>
   In the same speech, he declared himself to be ``a free trade
president.'' Then, after 10 seconds of applause, he added: ``To
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spent the day traveling throughout the state by bus, first
stopping for coffee at a diner in Des Moines before addressing
crowds in the neighboring towns of Ames and Perry. His speeches _
which sounded at times as much like victory addresses as
last-minute pleas for votes _ drew sizable crowds, as Bush's
appearances did throughout his final five-day swing through Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, however, a crew of Bush supporters worked
throughout the day to urge voters to get out to the caucuses,
fearing Bush's lead in recent polls would leave supporters
uninspired to turn out. A group of approximately 30 state
legislators flew in from Texas to spend the day calling undecided
voters and supporters to talk them into participating, said senior
aide Karl Rove.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Rove was hardly fearful for the night's results. Unmoved
by the well-financed campaign of Forbes _ who has run negative
advertisements about Bush, and to whom even a modest showing in
Iowa would be seen as a success _ Rove said: ``This is a five-week
rush.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're not organized, if you're not competing, if you're
not up in South Carolina, if you didn't have an organization in
Arizona and Michigan, you're nowhere,'' he said. ``And the fact of
the fact of the matter is, Forbes is on the tube in three states _
Delaware, New Hampshire and Iowa _ and he has an organization
virtually nowhere else in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has advertisements running in nine early primary states,
and his $71 million campaign coffer is poised to run them in all 50
states, Rove said, ``when the time is right.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Rove stated the obvious: That a Bush victory
in Iowa would bolster his chances in New Hampshire, where he faces
a much tighter race against McCain. ``People want validation,''
Rove said. ``Bush has high numbers all around the country...But
people want to know in the first test, `Can he do well?' People
will be paying attention to this.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Hughes, Bush's spokeswoman, spoke even more confidently.
``The time advantage Senator McCain has enjoyed is gone as of 2
a.m.,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was planning to leave Des Moines just three hours after the
caucuses began to fly to Manchester, N.H., where his campaign had
organized a rally for 2 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Laura, Bush's wife, flew in from Austin early Monday morning.
But their twin 18-year-old daughters, Barbara and Jenna, did not
join them. Bush explained: ``The girls are in school. They're
camera shy.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's humor did not extend to filmmaker Michael Moore, who has
been traveling the state during recent days. Moore approached Bush
Monday and invited him to join in a mosh pit _ a group of people
slamming into each other _ but the governor declined.
</P>
<P>
   He told the filmmaker: ``Behave yourself.''

FORMER SPY TESTIFIES ABOUT WEAPONS CACHE SITES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY STEVE CARNEY 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- His face hidden beneath a black hood, a former
top Soviet spy testified Monday that Los Angeles is still a
strategic target for Russia, and that he scouted locations for
weapons caches that Russian commandos could use in a ``future
war.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanislav Lunev, speaking at a meeting of the U.S. House
Committee on Government Reform, said he doesn't know if weapons or
supplies were ever stashed at the locations he detailed to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   But he and others at the hearing held in downtown Los Angeles
said a danger still exists from Russian spies and soldiers, as many
leaders there still see the United States as an evil empire, poised
to finish off its former Cold War foe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia is not just an indirect threat. It still operates a
pervasive intelligence community here in the U.S.,'' said Lunev,
now living under an assumed identity in the federal Witness
Protection Program. He added that the widening military and
economic gulf between the United States and Russia is only
increasing the paranoia of leaders in Moscow, who are still
planning for possible conflict with the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``San Francisco and Los Angeles are strategically important
targets for the future war,'' Lunev said.
</P>
<P>
   And committee Chairman Dan Burton, R-Indiana, cited a KGB
defector who said he'd heard of weapons sites in California, Texas,
Massachusetts and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe there are hundreds of sites in the United States,''
Burton said, where agents could have left explosives and even
suitcase-sized nuclear bombs, waiting for retrieval by Russian
commandos.
</P>
<P>
   But none of the committee members, the witnesses or the Russian
sources they quoted could verify any weapons caches in the United
States, nor did they have evidence that nuclear bombs or other
weapons of mass destruction were ever kept there.
</P>
<P>
   The defector did have specifics about arms and communications
caches left in Belgium and Switzerland, however, and authorities
found those where he said they were.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real stretch, it seems to me, that their doctrine calls
for them to be in NATO and the United States, and that we've found
them in NATO,'' and then not believe that the caches are also in
the United States, said one of Monday's witnesses, Peter Vincent
Pry, an author and former CIA agent.
</P>
<P>
   Literally the spy who came in from the cold, Lunev began his
remarks Monday by thanking the committee for holding the hearing in
balmy Los Angeles, rather than snowbound Washington, D.C. He walked
in wearing loafers and dark olive slacks; a blue blazer covered his
rounded frame, and a black cloth hood covered his head.
</P>
<P>
   Lunev was a colonel in the GRU, the intelligence agency of the
Soviet military, before he grew disillusioned and defected in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Posing as a correspondent for Tass, the Soviet news agency,
Lunev worked out of the Soviet embassy in Washington, D.C. Among
other duties, he said he compiled dossiers on government leaders as
possible asassination targets, and scouted locations for ``dead
drops,'' secret sites where agents could leave money, information
or weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Burton said the Clinton administration should make Moscow give
an accounting of the sites' locations and contents, if they exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there are Russian arms caches hidden around the country
with explosives and booby traps, this is a very dangerous
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   With the American economy booming, Lunev said the country should
invest more aid in Russia to ease economic turmoil there that could
lead to a more nationalistic and hostile government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now is a good time to think about American national security.
A little bit later, it may be too late.''

   BRITAIN: PINOCHET APPEAL
</P>
<P>
   In a joint action, six human rights groups are asking the High
Court Tuesday to block the release of Gen. Augusto Pinochet from
house arrest. They are seeking a public hearing into Home Secretary
Jack Straw's Jan. 11 determination that the former Chilean dictator
is medically unfit to stand trial in Spain on torture charges.
Straw said he would await the outcome of any judicial review before
announcing his decision on whether Pinochet, 84, can return to
Chile.

<P>
   IRELAND: ARMS CACHE FOUND
</P>
<P>
   The police questioned an unidentified 39-year-old man they found
transporting bomb-making equipment, homemade mortars and rockets in
a van near Tipperary. The police said they suspected that the arms
were destined for the Continuity IRA, a group opposed to the Irish
Republican Army's cease-fire and intent on bringing down the
Northern Ireland peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   GERMANY: EX-COMMUNIST MOVED
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that to protect his privacy, the former East
German Communist leader Egon Krenz had been switched from the
Hakenfelde open prison in Berlin to the city's Ploetzensee prison,
where rules are stricter. Officials said ``unremitting media
interest'' in Krenz had caused disruption at Hakenfelde. But
Krenz's lawyer said his client was being harassed by justice
officials. Krenz is serving a six-and-a-half year sentence in
connection with the shooting of people who tried to flee across the
Berlin wall.
</P>
<P>
   SPAIN: SOCIALISTS WOO COMMUNISTS
</P>
<P>
   The opposition Socialist Party, which trails the center-right
government in opinion polls before the March 12 elections, offered
to form a government with the smaller Communist-led United Left.
The deal would be the first of its kind in 20 years. The United
Left called an urgent meeting with the Socialists, who said the
alliance would be enough to win power.
</P>
<P>
   SPAIN: PROTESTS CONTINUE
</P>
<P>
   As protests against the Basque separatist group ETA continued
for a fourth day across Spain, King Juan Carlos condemned what he
termed ``criminal terrorism'' and lauded, in a speech to foreign
diplomats, the international cooperation to fight the group. The
government blames the rebels for a bombing last Friday that killed
an army officer in Madrid, in the first such attack in 18 months.

have closed it down for nine months. Pointing to results of a
referendum in which university members voted to end the strike,
President Juan Ramon de la Fuente said he would walk onto the
campus to take back control. The strikers began to fortify
barricades blocking entrances to the campus.
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO: CHARTER CHANGE SOUGHT
</P>
<P>
   Francisco Labastida, in a speech starting his campaign as the

consider amending the Constitution to allow senators and
congressmen to stand for re-election. He said it would strengthen
Congress as a balance to the presidency. The re-election of all

ICE CREAM HEADACHE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Science Times)  
 (Eds: Question may be italicized)  
 (af)  
 By C. CLAIBORNE RAY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Why does eating something really cold, like ice cream,
sometimes give me a headache? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You are not alone, because about 30 percent of the population
seems to have the same problem.
</P>
<P>
   The classic ice cream headache is a stabbing pain that usually
peaks after 30 to 60 seconds, though it can last up to five
minutes. A doctor who gets such headaches himself, Dr. Robert
Smith, founder of the Cincinnati Headache Center at the University
of Cincinnati College of Medicine, experimented with crushed ice
applied to different parts of his mouth to see what set off the
pains.
</P>
<P>
   The culprit, his research indicates, is at the back of the
palate, from which a mass of nerves called the spheno-palatine
ganglion stretches into the head. The nerves control the dilation
and contraction of blood vessels, and dilated blood vessels in the
head are known to cause several kinds of headaches.
</P>
<P>
   Smith also found that he was able to induce such headaches only
on warm days, though the internal mouth temperature remains
constant. Other researchers have suggested that this is because in
hot weather, a person tends to gulp cold drinks or wolf down
lemonade so that the cold stuff is more likely to hit the palate
hard.
</P>
<P>
   Ways to avoid the pangs might be to let the ice cream warm up in
the front of the mouth before swallowing or to swallow it in such a
way that it does not linger on the palate. &QL;

JIL SANDER IS DIVORCING PRADA

<P>
   In the world of corporate mergers and acquisitions, matches are
often made between companies as they are between men and women in
Woody Allen movies: according to the rule of opposites. The
buttoned-up marry the buttoned-down, the glitzy wed the discreet.
But when Prada acquired a 75 percent stake in the house of Jil
Sander late last August, the union seemed to be one of like minds.
Both labels stand for sanity in fashion and a kind of postmodern
good taste. And both Ms. Sander and Patrizio Bertelli, Prada's
chief executive, are thought of as intelligent, visionary sorts who
live far removed from the world of the laid-back.
</P>
<P>
   Mind-meld, though, is clearly no guarantee of happiness. Monday,
Ms. Sander surprised the fashion industry by resigning as
chairwoman of her company. The fall 2000 women's collection she is
scheduled to show in Milan next month will be her last. Under
Prada's stewardship, the Jil Sander line will continue, presumably
with a new creative head.
</P>
<P>
   Though no one from Ms. Sander's company or the Prada Group would
comment on the shift, several people in the fashion industry
closely associated with Ms. Sander and Bertelli say that the two
had developed a strained working relationship over the direction
Ms. Sander's company should take. Following her men's-wear show in
Milan earlier this month, Ms. Sander addressed rumors of a clash.
``With a merger, there are always different cultures,'' she said.
``This is a training period,'' she added, referring to her first
months as part of the Prada Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a problem of personalities,'' said one fashion executive
who has been following the partnership closely. ``They're
different, but they're also exactly the same. They want to run
their own shows.'' Ms. Sander, the executive added, ``thought she'd
continue her rein at Jil Sander.'' Bertelli, he said, ``has clear
ideas of where the company should go.''
</P>
<P>
   A news release issued Monday by the Sander company and Prada
Group announcing the split declared that the five-month-old
partnership had resulted in a ``new strategic policy'' with the aim
of ``improving sales and profitability and thereby the shareholder
value of the company.'' The stock price of Ms. Sander's company,
which is traded on the Frankfurt exchange, rose from $312 to $352 a
share in September after the Prada deal but has since fallen to
$226 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sander partnered with Bertelli in large part to expand her
accessories business, she said earlier this month. Ms. Sander is
the rare designer who does 90 percent of her business in clothing,
as opposed to the shoes, handbags and other accessories that are
the mainstays of most luxury-goods houses. Prada's investment was
part of its strategy to build a premium-brand empire by buying
control of small companies and expanding their product lines. It
also purchased Church &AMP; Co., the British shoemaker, and 51 percent
of Helmut Lang last year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Although it is unclear exactly what Ms. Sander and Bertelli
could not agree on, some in the fashion industry believe that Prada
was trying to expand Ms. Sander's accessories business at a rate
she was not comfortable with or at the expense of her ready-to-wear
line. Ms. Sander is known for the use of wildly expensive fabrics
and manufacturing methods that leave items like simply cut
lightweight sweaters costing $800 or $900, higher than similar
pieces in other designer collections. Prada might have been
encouraging a price restructuring, industry insiders said.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came as Ms. Sander was selling an early portion
of her fall 2000 women's line in Hamburg to retailers from around
the world. Sales of Ms. Sander's clothes in the United States have
done consistently well, retailers here say. Linda Dresner, who has
carried the Jil Sander line for 12 years in her Park Avenue store,
said the designer ``is the most important brand in our store.'' Ms.
Dresner, who dined with Ms. Sander in Hamburg Monday night, said
she would continue to carry the line ``for now.'' Jeffrey Kalinsky,
the owner of Jeffrey in New York and Atlanta, as well as a Jil
Sander shop in Atlanta, said that Ms. Sander's clothes have
``exceeded my needs,'' in terms of sales.
</P>
<P>
   Barneys New York has also done a consistently good business with
Jil Sander, said Judy Collinson, the store's general merchandise
manager. The Sander line is not doomed, Ms. Collinson said. ``She
built a tremendous design team,'' Ms. Collinson added. ``I think
her product will occupy the same place in the market.''

 &HT;    McCain's shunning of Iowa reflected in caucuses
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PLYMOUTH, N.H. _ Iowa got no respect Monday from Sen. John
McCain (R-Ariz.).
</P>
<P>
   And the Senator didn't get much in return from Iowans, with a
finish well back in the pack of contenders in the Iowa caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain said he was pleased by the result.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's 5 percent more than I thought I was going to get, and I'm
very pleased that we saved ourselves a lot of money and assets''
McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could view it as a good showing by both Forbes and
Keyes,'' he said of the results.
</P>
<P>
   McCain sees little correlation between the Iowa outcome and what
will happen in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure they are going to be affected much by what
happens in Iowa,'' he said of New Hampshire voters.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, at his 100th town hall meeting in New
Hampshire, McCain described Monday's Iowa caucuses as unworthy of
his time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it's the preliminaries (being held in Iowa), and the
finals are right here in New Hampshire in seven days, 12 hours and
16 minutes, not that I'm counting,'' McCain said at the local
armory, where his campaign marked the occasion with a huge cake and
the playing of Jerry Lee Lewis' version of ``Johnny B. Goode.''
</P>
<P>
   His choice of terms may seem odd for the first primary in the
nation, but McCain's words conveyed the importance of making a
strong showing in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   While the other five Republicans and two Democrats were in Iowa
for last-minute campaigning, McCain did what he has done on 63
other days in the past year. He campaigned in New Hampshire, where
he hopes to defeat Gov. George W. Bush of Texas in next week's
primary.
</P>
<P>
   The state is crucial to McCain's chances, the first of four
states that McCain has chosen to try to pierce the notion that
Bush's nomination is inevitable. The other states are South
Carolina, Arizona and Michigan, all of which hold primaries later
in February.

<P>
   BEIRUT _ In Iraq, there are doctors aplenty who would like to
meet the six scientists from Britain's Royal Society chosen Monday
to investigate the damage, human and environmental, wreaked by
Western use of depleted uranium (DU) shells in both the Gulf War
and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In the main Basra teaching hospital, the cancer sufferers who
live near the fields where depleted uranium shells (DU) were fired
by the hundreds in 1991 queue at the door of the tiny cancer clinic
each morning.
</P>
<P>
   But will the British scientists meet them? Will they go to Iraq
and study the documentation of Basra's leading cancer specialist,
Dr. Jawad al-Ali, who has maps showing the rate of leukemia growth
in the areas where Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's tanks were torn
apart by DU in the last days of the war?
</P>
<P>
   I think not.
</P>
<P>
   When Iraq asked the World Health Organization to investigate DU
two years ago, a team of experts arrived to see if such a study was
feasible; but no investigation took place.
</P>
<P>
   And what about Kosovo? The U.S. used DU rounds last year in its
attacks across the Serb province _ and then arrogantly refused to
tell U.N. investigators the location of its attacks. British
Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook, admitted as much in the Commons last
autumn.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Why cannot we be told where these rounds were fired? Will
the Royal Society's experts visit Kosovo? Will they ask NATO for
the information it refused to give to the U.N.?
</P>
<P>
   And what if NATO treats them with the same disdain? They could
do worse, for example, than to visit the bombed-out paramilitary
police barracks in Djakovica, where DU fired by American A-10
aircraft exploded in the very center of the city.
</P>
<P>
   But will they go to other parts of Yugoslavia? Will they visit
the areas around Belgrade where DU was also used? Will the British
government, indeed, allow them to go there?
</P>
<P>
   And what kind of brief is it that tells the scientists they are
to ``review the available evidence?''
</P>
<P>
   If this is to be anything more than a palliative to shut up the
Gulf War veterans who suspect they are dying of DU poisoning, these
six experts have to find the available evidence lying in the fields
of Kosovo and southern Iraq, not just trawl through published
reports and military denials.
</P>
<P>
   At one of NATO's May press conferences last year, spokesman
James Shea stated that there was no evidence suggesting DU was
dangerous, citing a report which turned out to be inaccurate. Is
this the sort of stuff the experts will be ``reviewing?''
</P>
<P>
   For almost two years, British Defense Ministry officials have
been claiming in letters to MPs that ``the Government has not seen
any peer-reviewed epidemiological research data'' on affected
populations _ mentioning my own reports in ``The Independent'' of
deformities, cancers and birth defects in southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Is this, then, what this team is meant to do _ to provide the
Government with some ``peer-reviewed'' data without any serious
on-site inspection?
</P>
<P>
   I rather suspect it is. &QL;

 c.2000 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ A team of scientists from Britain's Royal Society is to
carry out an independent investigation into the dangers of depleted
uranium (DU), amid growing evidence that use of the material in
shells and missiles is a cause of Gulf War Syndrome and has led to
an increase in cancers among those in close contact with the
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The move will fuel accusations by veterans and human-rights
groups that inquiries so far undertaken by Britain's Ministry of
Defense (MoD) have been little short of a whitewash.
</P>
<P>
   A working group of six Royal Society experts will assess the
hazards to human health and the environment for a report to be
published this year.
</P>
<P>
   It will be chaired by Professor Brian Spratt, from the Wellcome
Trust Center for the Epidemiology of Infectious Diseases at Oxford
University, England.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some public concern about the long-term consequences
for military personnel, civilian populations and the environment
arising from the use of depleted uranium in military conflicts,
such as the Gulf War and Kosovo,'' said Professor Spratt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Royal Society wishes to provide the public with an
independent opinion of the possible health hazards associated with
the use of depleted-uranium munitions.''
</P>
<P>
   The weapons were first used by British and American troops
during the Gulf War, and they have been the subject of controversy
ever since.
</P>
<P>
   The MoD has admitted to firing around 88 tank shells containing
depleted uranium, but the U.S. forces are thought to have thousands
of DU rounds fired by ``tank-busting'' aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Uranium is the most dense of all elements, and is used in
munitions because of its very high penetrating power against
armored vehicles. DU comes from former nuclear fuel that has been
``depleted'' of most of its radiation.
</P>
<P>
   On impact about 70 percent of the round burns up, destroying the
target vehicle and its crew. The remainder, in the form of shrapnel
or dust, contains radioactive particles which can be inhaled or
enter the body through wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has seen dramatically increased cancer rates in the Basra
region since the Gulf War, and attributes this to around 300 tons
of DU material it says was left behind by U.S. and British forces.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Society panel will assess the danger to soldiers
exposed to this material, and estimate the doses and possible
health effects for the general population during and after the use
of DU munitions.
</P>
<P>
   Other members of the selected group are Dr. Michael Bailey, from
the National Radiological Protection Board, Dame Barbara Clayton,
honorary research professor in metabolism at Southampton
University, Dr. Clive Marsh, director of physics research at the
Atomic Weapons Establishment, Aldermaston, Professor Ian Shanks,
science adviser at Unilever Research and Professor Marshal
Stoneham, director of the Center for Materials Research at
University College, London.
</P>
<P>
   The British government has always maintained that DU presents a
very low health risk. But Gulf War veterans have consistently
questioned this view, and accused the MoD of attempting to cover up
the true situation.
</P>
<P>
   A recent series of tests on British veterans suffering from Gulf
War Syndrome found DU traces in 30 out of 48 cases.
</P>
<P>
   All the tests were carried out in the U.S. and Canada, after a
row over test procedures here led to the veterans withdrawing all
cooperation with the MoD.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans Monday gave a cautious welcome to the new study. ``This
is good news, so long as they really are independent of the
Government and the MoD,'' said Sean Rusling, chairman of Britain's
National Gulf Veterans and Families Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope they will invite the doctors who have tested us, and
are independent, to give evidence.'' &QL;

   A working group of six Royal Society experts will assess the
hazards to human health and the environment for a report to be
published this year.
</P>
<P>
   It will be chaired by Professor Brian Spratt, from the Wellcome
Trust Center for the Epidemiology of Infectious Diseases at Oxford
University, England.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some public concern about the long-term consequences
for military personnel, civilian populations and the environment
arising from the use of depleted uranium in military conflicts,
such as the Gulf War and Kosovo,'' said Professor Spratt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Royal Society wishes to provide the public with an
independent opinion of the possible health hazards associated with
the use of depleted-uranium munitions.''
</P>
<P>
   The weapons were first used by British and American troops
during the Gulf War, and they have been the subject of controversy
ever since.
</P>
<P>
   The MoD has admitted to firing around 88 tank shells containing
depleted uranium, but the U.S. forces are thought to have thousands
of DU rounds fired by ``tank-busting'' aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Uranium is the most dense of all elements, and is used in
munitions because of its very high penetrating power against
armored vehicles. DU comes from former nuclear fuel that has been
``depleted'' of most of its radiation.
</P>
<P>
   On impact about 70 percent of the round burns up, destroying the
target vehicle and its crew. The remainder, in the form of shrapnel
or dust, contains radioactive particles which can be inhaled or
enter the body through wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has seen dramatically increased cancer rates in the Basra
region since the Gulf War, and attributes this to around 300 tons
of DU material it says was left behind by U.S. and British forces.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Society panel will assess the danger to soldiers
exposed to this material, and estimate the doses and possible
health effects for the general population during and after the use
of DU munitions.
</P>
<P>
   Other members of the selected group are Dr. Michael Bailey, from
the National Radiological Protection Board, Dame Barbara Clayton,
honorary research professor in metabolism at Southampton
University, Dr. Clive Marsh, director of physics research at the
Atomic Weapons Establishment, Aldermaston, Professor Ian Shanks,
science adviser at Unilever Research and Professor Marshal
Stoneham, director of the Center for Materials Research at
University College, London.
</P>
<P>
   The British government has always maintained that DU presents a
very low health risk. But Gulf War veterans have consistently
questioned this view, and accused the MoD of attempting to cover up
the true situation.
</P>
<P>
   A recent series of tests on British veterans suffering from Gulf
War Syndrome found DU traces in 30 out of 48 cases.
</P>
<P>
   All the tests were carried out in the U.S. and Canada, after a
row over test procedures here led to the veterans withdrawing all
cooperation with the MoD.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans Monday gave a cautious welcome to the new study. ``This
is good news, so long as they really are independent of the
Government and the MoD,'' said Sean Rusling, chairman of Britain's
National Gulf Veterans and Families Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope they will invite the doctors who have tested us, and
are independent, to give evidence.'' &QL;

 &UR; HOUSE  &LR; _ When their landlord told Sidney and Arlene Lerner last
summer that he wouldn't renew their Foster City apartment lease,
the couple decided that the time had come to buy a house. Time was
limited, because the landlord gave them only a month's notice.
Unable to afford a house in Foster City, they booted up their
computer and began exploring several Internet Web sites that list
homes for sale throughout the Bay Area and beyond. They entered
parameters into the search engines, specifying four bedrooms, three
bathrooms, a swimming pool and a price in the vicinity of $200,000.
They were directed to 10 homes in the Vacaville area. By Arthur M.

<P>
   SOUTH ORANGE, N.J. _ Josie Roscigno and Lauren Covino sat in the
cafeteria of Seton Hall University on Monday afternoon giggling,
gossiping and making the kind of off-color jokes that only an
18-year-old undergraduate could appreciate. The two freshmen _
Giants fans, shopping addicts and best friends _ had not seen each
other in almost a week and there was plenty of catching up to do.
</P>
<P>
   But the laughter and small talk could not conceal what both
women were really experiencing: dread, anxiety and emotional
exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess you could say I'm freaking out a little bit,''
Roscigno said with a frayed smile. ``I'm not sure what to expect.''
</P>
<P>
   Five days after a fire killed three students, injured 54 and
forced hundreds of others into the frozen night air, residents of
Boland Hall, the six-story freshman dormitory where the blaze broke
out, were allowed to return to their rooms on Monday. It was the
first time many had stepped on campus since the fire on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day that the three dead students were buried in
separate funerals, many survivors of the fire said they were trying
to see beyond the events of last week, even as they found
themselves talking about it incessantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're all sick of the topic,'' said Covino, who along
with Roscigno escaped injury by running down a stairwell as their
third-floor room began to fill with smoke. ``We just want to get
back to a normal life.''
</P>
<P>
   But normalcy may be fleeting for the near future. Five students
remained in critical condition on Monday, four of them with severe
burns, and reminders of the blaze dotted the 56-acre campus _ from
the blue-and-white memorial ribbons many teachers and students
pinned to their lapels to the cafeteria bulletin board that was
filled with personal tributes to the dead and injured.
</P>
<P>
   Although cleaning crews have spent the last few days trying to
erase evidence of the fire, the smell of smoke still hangs in the
hallways and the most heavily damaged parts of Boland Hall remain
closed, its students relocated to other dormitory rooms, nearby
college campuses and a local motel.
</P>
<P>
   Like many students, Ramone DeJesus said he had mixed feelings
about moving back into the the white brick building, which was
fully staffed with grief counselors, resident assistants and
priests on Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, I'm not sure what to do,'' he said. ``It's
tough to move in after what happened, but I'm going to give it a
week to see how it goes and then if I'm not happy or don't feel
good about it, then I will commute.''
</P>
<P>
   As they waited to enter, many students could not help but peer
up at the darkened windows of the third floor, their screens torn
out, a smudge of soot marking the facade. Out of view, on the other
side of the building, sat a pair of snow-covered mattresses that
panicked students had thrown to the ground, hoping they might break
their falls.
</P>
<P>
   The unease on campus Monday was heightened by a lack of new
information from investigators, who continued to interview Boland
Hall residents about what they might have seen or heard in the
building on the night of the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte Smith, a spokeswoman for the Essex County prosecutor,
Donald C. Campolo, who is heading the investigation, declined to
discuss the inquiry but said that neither arson nor accident had
been ruled out. For now, all that the investigators know is that
the fire began around 4:30 a.m. in a third-floor lounge and quickly
consumed three sofas, carpeting and ceiling tiles, producing thick
black black smoke that sent dozens to hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the victims, Aaron Karol and John Giunta, were found
burned to death in the lounge, while another, Frank Caltabilota,
was found in his room, killed by the toxic smoke.
</P>
<P>
   All three men, just 18, were buried on Monday in separate
funerals in New Jersey. Hundreds of people gathered at each
ceremony, and the outpouring of grief was immeasurable. Seton
Hall's president, Robert Sheeran, attended all three funerals.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a time of immense loss,'' he said after arriving at
his third, that of Giunta.
</P>
<P>
   An aspiring public school teacher, Giunta was recalled as
generous and loyal at a funeral Mass at St. Francis Roman Catholic
Church in Vineland. The service, celebrated by a dozen priests and
the archbishop of Camden, was attended by three busloads of Seton
Hall students.
</P>
<P>
   Giunta's father, Phil, read a letter to his son, each line
beginning the same way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody wants to hold your head,'' he said. ``Somebody wants
to give you a hug. Somebody thinks you are great. Somebody
thousands of miles away is looking at one of your Web sites.'' As
tears overtook him, Giunta finished. ``Somebody will be crying when
they read this, and that somebody is me.''
</P>
<P>
   In West Long Branch, the sobs of mourners echoed through St.
Jerome Roman Catholic Church as the body of Caltabilota was carried
in by his friends. An honor student and accomplished athlete,
Caltabilota had hoped to study medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're a hero to everyone you've ever known,'' his 15-year-old
brother, Thomas, said at the start of the service. ``You're a hero
to me. I love you. May you rest in peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The outpouring of grief was the same in Dunellen, where hundreds
gathered to bury Karol, a criminal justice major who talked about
working for the FBI. As his friends read poetry, former teammates
from the Watchung Hills Regional High School, all of them wearing
their black soccer jackets, cried and hugged one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Learn from the loss of this young man how precious life is,''
said the Rev. John Morley, a Seton Hall priest. ``And it does not
come with guarantees.''
</P>
<P>
   A memorial service for all three men has been scheduled for
Tuesday at Seton Hall's gymnasium.
</P>
<P>
   Whether they were attending the funerals or were simply too
traumatized to return, many of Boland Hall's residents did not rush
back to school when the dormitory's side doors opened at 2 p.m.
Monday. About two dozen students, many accompanied by their
parents, gathered in the thawing sun as a carillon tolled the hour.
</P>
<P>
   Some carried duffel bags, others fresh bedding and shopping bags
stuffed with junk food. Any sense of the ordinary was broken by the
sobering sight of an elderly priest who wandered through the crowd,
gently calling out: ``Counseling. Anyone need counseling?''

 Intuit Names GE Capital EVP As New Chief  &HT;     By Peter Sinton 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Intuit Inc. announced yesterday that it has named GE Capital
Executive Vice President Stephen M. Bennett as its new president
and chief executive.
<P>
   The Mountain View company, best known for its Quicken and
TurboTax software and Quicken.com Web-based financial services, has
been looking for a new CEO since September. Former CEO Bill Harris
resigned to pursue more entrepreneurial ventures and Intuit
Chairman Bill Campbell filled in as acting CEO until a permanent
replacement could be found.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an incredible opportunity to lead a Silicon Valley
company that will help shape the future of e-finance,'' said
Bennett. ``Intuit is well-positioned serving 5 million small
businesses and 12 million consumers and our challenge will be to
expand services and broaden our value proposition to get more
revenues per customer.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett, 45, will move to the Bay Area from Connecticut where he
was a member of the Office of the CEO at GE Capital, the financial
services subsidiary of General Electric Corp.
</P>
<P>
   With $330 billion in assets, GE Capital is the world leader in
private label credit cards, commercial equipment leasing and vendor
finance and accounts for 42 percent of General Electric's overall
profits.
</P>
<P>
   In his most recent position, Bennett oversaw a portfolio of five
different companies whose more than 20,000 employees last year
generated $15 billion in annual volume.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to that, as president and CEO of GE Capital e-Business, he
pioneered the company's efforts to tap the Internet across GE
Capital's worldwide portfolio of businesses. He also launched GE's
small business Internet site which focuses on serving businesses
with from &LR; 20 to 500 employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted someone with service industry knowledge, who had led
large, complex organizations and with proven ability to produce
fast growth,'' said Campbell, 58. ``Steve is the ideal choice to
take Intuit to the multibillion-dollar level.''

 Pac Bell's Mailer Worries Some Consumers  &HT;     By Todd Wallack 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
San Francisco resident Dennis Lewis said he was startled last week
when he received a warning from Pacific Bell in the mail:
<P>
   ``Do you have equipment connected to your telephone?'' the
notice asked. Fax machines, answering machines, alarms and modems,
the letter warned, ``may need to be adjusted'' so they will work
with the company's new digital switching equipment. It also said
features like speed dialing and call forwarding may need to be
reprogrammed.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned, Lewis called the toll-free number listed on the
notice and spoke to a customer representative who told him older
equipment might malfunction. But she couldn't tell how old was old,
or why there would be a problem. (A reporter received a similar
response when he called.)
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Lewis probably has nothing to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Bell said it routinely sends out hundreds or thousands
of such notices when it upgrades old equipment in its switching
offices _ just in case something goes wrong. In reality, Pacific
Bell spokesman John Britton said he'd never heard of a case where a
residential customer has had a problem.
</P>
<P>
   But Lewis called the mailing irresponsible. ``Why can't they
just say that problems are rare (in the letter)?''
</P>
<P>
   Britton, however, contended the wording was clear. ``It says MAY
need to be adjusted,'' he said. Britton said customers should only
contact the phone company if they experience a problem with their
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   He said the company has sent out more than 8 million notices
over the past six years, and only received a handful of complaints
about the mailing.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis was among as many as 60,000 Pac Bell customers in San
Francisco who recently received the notice because the company is
updating its equipment in a San Francisco central office next
month.
</P>
<P>
   Britton said the California Public Utilities Commission requires
the mailings. ``We're playing by the rules,'' he said. (The PUC did
not return a call seeking comment.)
</P>
<P>
   Other telephone companies also send out similar notices because
of occasional glitches, said Nortel Networks, which built the new
Pac Bell equipment.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, an alarm system might have trouble automatically
dialing a certain phone number. Or if someone has multiple lines,
voices might be too faint.
</P>
<P>
   But spokeswoman Joanne Latham said the problems are ``rare.''
And generally, she said, phone companies or customers can fix the
glitches with minor adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's just a phone company being cautious,'' said
Nortel spokeswoman Joanne Latham.

 _ SF CHRON   Commission-Free Account a Good Deal 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Q: American Express is advertising a commission-free brokerage
account for customers with at least $100,000 in assets. What's the
catch?
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: I talked to an American Express spokesman about this. There
are some catches, but not enough to bother most prospective
customers.
</P>
<P>
   One catch is that you aren't allowed to day-trade for free. If
you buy a stock and sell it on the same day, you will be charged a
$14.95 commission on the sale, says spokesman Dave Kanihan.
However, you won't pay a commission on the purchase.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the commission-free provision applies only to
online transactions, and is limited to purchases and sales of
stocks. There will be commissions if you buy or sell other types of
securities.
</P>
<P>
   It looks like a terrific deal if you have a computer and don't
happen to be a day-trader. And even some day-traders might not mind
paying $14.95 for a round-trip trade, although it is possible to do
somewhat better at a few other brokerage firms.
</P>
<P>
   Lest you think that American Express has gone soft, Kanihan
concedes that the company does have a financial motive here. It
wants you to patronize its ``field force of financial advisers, who
do planning and consulting for clients.'' Those guys charge fees,
and the commission-free brokerage account serves as a loss leader
to bring you into their orbit.
</P>
<P>
   But you don't have to hook up with the advisers. You can simply
buy and sell stocks without paying commissions, and there won't be
any hard feelings.
</P>
<P>
   Well ... maybe a few hard feelings, but don't let that stop you.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR;  Q: I am a software engineer. I worked beyond regular office
hours many times last year, but the company I work for does not
recognize overtime, so I have not received any overtime
compensation. I would like to know whether I am eligible to receive
overtime pay under California law.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR;  A: Your question can't be answered from the limited information
you have supplied, says Dean Fryer, a spokesman for the state
Department of Industrial Relations.
</P>
<P>
   Although most California workers are entitled to extra pay for
overtime, he observes, there are exceptions for managers and
supervisors, employees in the ``licensed professions'' _ such as
lawyers _ and others who have ``a lot of independence in their
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Mead, an official of the Software Engineering Institute in
Pittsburgh, Pa., says that U.S. software engineers generally are
not entitled to overtime pay. However, she says, exceptions
sometimes are made for people in entry-level positions.
</P>
<P>
   People who aren't getting overtime pay but think they might be
entitled to it can apply for an official ruling from the office of
the state labor commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each case has to be looked at on an individual basis, taking
into account the work and responsibilities of the employee,'' Fryer
says.
</P>
<P>
   You can obtain a claim form by telephoning the department's San
Francisco district office at 415-557-7878. Or, you can visit the
office at 455 Golden Gate Ave., 8th floor. There also are Bay Area
branch offices in San Jose, at 100 Paseo de San Antonio, Room 120,
and Santa Rosa, at 50 D St., Suite 360.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR;  Q: My wife and I live in Pinole, where last year the voters
approved a measure to help save our police force. The money is
collected as a tax on everyone's gas, electric and telephone bills.
Can this be claimed as a deduction on our income-tax form?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: No, says Internal Revenue Service spokesman Jesse Weller.
</P>
<P>
   If it qualified as a property tax, it would be deductible. But
this is a utility tax, and therefore not deductible.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, the tax was not levied solely to shore up the
police department. You probably got that impression from campaign
signs that were posted before the ballot was taken. This actually
was an attempt to avert a general cutback in municipal services.
The city's political leaders expect the tax to add $1.1 million
annually to the general fund.
</P>
<P>
   Pinole isn't the only California municipality to impose a
utility tax. Many others _ perhaps most _ also have them. You
non-Pinoleans out there might want to take a close look at the
itemized charges on your next utility bills.
</P>
<P>

notice. Unable to afford a house in Foster City, they booted up
their computer and began exploring several Internet Web sites that
list homes for sale throughout the Bay Area and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   They entered parameters into the search engines, specifying four
bedrooms, three bathrooms, a swimming pool and a price in the
vicinity of $200,000. They were directed to 10 homes in the
Vacaville area.
</P>
<P>
   They hooked up with an agent in Vacaville, and within a day made
a successful offer on a $230,000 house that includes not only a
pool, but also a Jacuzzi.
</P>
<P>
   That sort of scenario is being played out again and again these
days. When it comes to home buying, computers are living up to
their reputation as time-savers.
</P>
<P>
   Gone _ or going _ are the days when prospective home buyers
spent a long succession of weekends chugging from house to house in
their agent's BMW.
</P>
<P>
   The California Association of Realtors found in a survey that 35
percent of the people who bought homes in the state during the
third quarter of last year used the Internet to explore their
options. That was up from only 26 percent at the beginning of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   In the tech-savvy Bay Area, the percentage probably is much
higher. Brian Santilena, a broker with Prudential California Realty
in the Oakland/Montclair office, says that about 80 percent of his
clients do preliminary research on the Internet to narrow their
choices.
</P>
<P>
   He observes: ``It is very common that someone calls and says `I
saw a property on the Net and want more information on it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Internet home-buying sites were practically nonexistent five
years ago, but now there are many dozens of them. Among those with
the biggest followings are www.homeadvisor.com, www.cyberhomes.com,
www.realestate.yahoo.com, www.iown.com and www.homes.com.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, many real-estate firms _ and even many individual
agents _ have their own Web sites. Some choice examples include
www.stewarttitle.com, www.mcguie.com, www.alainpinel.com,
www.coldwellbanker.com, www.century21.com, www.rondavis.com and
www.ebayrealtor.com.
</P>
<P>
   The most widely used home-buying site of all, according to the
Media Metrix data-gathering service, is www.realtor.com, sponsored
by the National Association of Realtors. It lists 1.3 million homes
being offered through all the local Multiple Listing Services.
</P>
<P>
   But no site is all-inclusive: Many of them list homes that can't
be found on other sites.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, some sites offer bonus features, such as virtual
tours of a home's interior, or useful social and economic
statistics about the community in which the home is located.
Prospective home buyers would do well to rummage through a lot of
sites, rather than relying on any particular one.
</P>
<P>
   While the Internet has made buyers less dependent on agents, it
certainly hasn't eliminated the agent's function.
</P>
<P>
   Through your computer, you can find practically every house
currently for sale. But almost invariably, you will be steered to
an agent, whose aid you will need if you want to tour the premises
and present an offer.
</P>
<P>
   The only exception to that rule is if you find the house of your
dreams on a Web site _ such as www.owners.com _ that lists homes
for sale directly by the owners. If you do, you probably can get
the house at a bargain, because the seller won't have to factor a
broker's commission into the price.
</P>
<P>
   Kojo Yeboah, a software engineer with Cisco Systems, used the
Owners.com site last fall to find a four-bedroom home in San Carlos
Hills. He previously had cruised the area with an agent, without
success.
</P>
<P>
   Yeboah paid about $600,000, which he figures was at least
$50,000 less than he would have paid if an agent was involved.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the selection of homes on owners-only sites is
sparse. Fewer than 5 percent of all home sales are transacted
without an agent.
</P>
<P>
   Often you will need an agent just to learn the street address of
a house you find on the Internet. That crucial piece of information
is omitted from many, if not most, houses listed on home-buying Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the listings are provided by the agents, many of
whom are reluctant to give buyers the opportunity to deal directly
with sellers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, of course, many sellers don't want to be pestered.
</P>
<P>
   Internet home-buying can have other shortcomings as well.
</P>
<P>
   If you are searching during a particularly hot seller's market _
such as the one the Bay Area experienced a year or so ago _
Internet listings can be rendered nearly useless.
</P>
<P>
   In such a market, by the time you see a house on the Internet,
it very likely will have been sold. Houses that remain unsold for
any length of time are apt to be dogs.
</P>
<P>
   But even doggy houses have their day.
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Chong, chief executive of a startup company called
Virtual Boardwalk, which provides technology services to
conventions, says she used the Internet to find a home with ``no
curb appeal'' in the Richmond District of San Francisco in late
1998, ``during the height of the bidding wars.'`
</P>
<P>
   It had five bedrooms and was priced at less than $500,000, but
it had been passed up by other buyers because it needed a paint job
and plumbing repairs and was ``one of the ugliest houses I saw.''
But it was structurally sound, and had a nice view of the Marin
Headlands.
</P>
<P>
   Some home buyers complain that even in less-inflamed markets,
the listings they find on the Internet often turn out to be
obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   Data about home listings must pass from real estate agents to
the Web sites to the technical people who actually enter the data.
So, listing delays are inevitable, both arriving and leaving.
</P>
<P>
   Houses sometimes remain pictured on a Web site, in all their
multicolor glory, long after they have been taken off the market.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Villaflor, a paralegal, and her husband, Leonard, an
accountant, who live in a rented apartment in San Bruno, discovered
this last November when they began looking for houses in San Mateo
and Foster City.
</P>
<P>
   They drew up a list of 15 houses on the Internet that looked
promising, and submitted it to an agent. The agent reported back
that all the houses had been either sold or pulled off the market.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Villaflor says that one of the Web sites that was partly
out of date was the NAR's vaunted www.realtor.com.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about this, an NAR spokeswoman referred the matter to
Homestore.com, a publicly held company in Thousand Oaks, which
manages the Realtor.com Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Fulton, a spokeswoman for Homestore.com, says that
complaints about outdated material are ``not something we hear very
frequently.'' She says that about 1 million of the 1.3 million
Realtor.com listings are updated daily. The rest, she says, are
updated weekly.

&HT;     IN IOWA INDUSTRIAL TOWN, IT'S A SWEEP FOR GORE AND BUSH 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WATERLOO, Iowa _ The Democratic caucus meeting for Ward 2,
Precinct 3 in this northeastern Iowa city had been going on for 30
minutes Monday, and already it was not a good night for Bill
Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Those attending the caucus on one side of the West High School
cafeteria were asked to divide into groups _ all those for Vice
President Al Gore at one set of long lunch tables, all those for
Bradley at the other. Gore has 29 Iowans in his corner while
Bradley had eight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a blue-collar precinct,'' sniffed Sharon Hyke, a
supporter of Bradley, a former senator from New Jersey. ``That's
why its for Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: Organized labor, which supports Gore, turned out
the votes in a city where 30 percent of registered Democrats are
union members.
</P>
<P>
   That's a bitter irony for Hyke. Her father lost his job when the
Rath Co. pork production plant went belly up in 1984. He lost his
health insurance and finished out his career as a minimum-wage
kitchen worker.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never had it comfortable,'' said Hyke, 34. ``Bill Bradley
knows that. He understands everyone in America doesn't have it
cushy; that the economy's not great for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, as Gore won the predicted victory across Iowa, so did he
score big here in this union town.
</P>
<P>
   In the Ward 2, Precinct 4 meeting on the other side of the
cafeteria, Gore won 44 votes to Bradley's 14. John Carson, Gore's
24-year-old paid organizer here, paced the halls of cavernous West
High nervously at first, but relaxed and smiled as the meetings
broke up.
</P>
<P>
   Who were these Gore people? Gore's precinct captain in 2-3, as
the precinct is known in political parlance, was Kevin Powers, the
local president of the letter carriers' union.
</P>
<P>
   But the votes were coming from people like Carla Madson, a home
economics teacher in nearby Hudson, who sat quietly at the Gore
table while her daughter, Marissa, 7, drew on paper with
felt-tipped pens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore supports education and its important for classes to be
small and teachers respected,'' Madson said. ``That's the root of a
lot of problems we have with children. They're disruptive because
they don't get the attention they need and they're too crammed
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, down the hall in the student center, the Republicans
of Ward 2, Precinct 4 were giving Texas Gov. George W. Bush part of
his big night in Iowa. When the paper ballots were counted just
after 7:30 p.m., Bush had 39 votes; publisher Steve Forbes 9;
conservative activist Gary Bauer 9; radio commentator Alan Keyes 8;
Arizona Sen. John McCain, 3; and Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, zero.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of losing elections to the liberals,'' said James
Kirkpatrick, 39, a pension administrator for Principal Financial
Group. ``We need George W. Bush to broaden the base of the party.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the room, Denny Nordorft, a 50-year-old dealer in classic
rock records challenged Kirkpatrick, asking him why Bush was such a
great ``Democratic'' governor of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   After some back and forth, Nordorft sat down without speaking up
for his candidate, Keyes, a State Department official in the Reagan
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm out here tonight because this could be the end of the
Republican Party,'' Nordorft said. ``This country's on a downhill
slide. And Alan Keyes represents what this country needs: A return
to basic values.''
</P>
<P>
   The caucuses at West High School mirrored the region's political
economy.
</P>
<P>
   This area's economic mix of manufacturing and service industries
has yielded a fairly even division in political strength. Black
Hawk County, where Waterloo is located, has 23,586 registered
Democrats and 20,372 registered Republicans. With such an even
divide, the caucuses at West High represent a broad cross-section
of all the hopes and anxieties of voting Iowans.
</P>
<P>
   The Iowa caucuses involve a process in which each party holds
precinct-by-precinct meetings for the purpose of electing a
presidential nominee. The caucus votes are several steps removed
from the actual delegate-selection process in the state, but they
have symbolic value as the first voting exercise in the 2000
presidential election. New Hampshire holds the nation's first
primary on Feb. 1.

</P>
<P>
   A Des Moines Register poll published last weekend put Gore ahead
with 56 percent and Bradley trailing with 28 percent. On the
Republican side, Bush led with 43 percent against his closest
competitor, Forbes, with 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a bigger win for Al Gore than anyone else because he
is no longer the defender of the Clinton administration,'' said
Dave Nagle, a Democrat who served as the area's congressman from
1987 to 1993 and now practices law here. ``He's now the next leader
of the Democratic Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Carson, who headed Gore's operation in Waterloo, worked with
organizers from the AFL-CIO and the American Federation of State,
County and Municipal Employees. They blanketed the area with phone
calls.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign organized rides for supporters and arranged to
bus residents in the predominantly African-American east side to
caucus sites.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's backers conceded there was little there could do
against such an overwhelming organization.
</P>
<P>
   About 160 miles northeast of the capital Des Moines, Waterloo
developed as an ``industrial railroad suburb of Chicago,''
according to Allen Brierly, a political scientist at the University
of Northern Iowa in nearby Cedar Falls.
</P>
<P>
   Waterloo is where Iowa's farm and manufacturing economies become
united. Its five Deere and Co. plants employ just under 5,000 in
the production of tractors. The sprawling IBP Co. outside of town
employs 2,200 in one of the world's largest pork production plants.
</P>
<P>
   When Iowa's farm economy went into a tailspin in the 1980s,
Waterloo looked deep into an economic abyss. The huge Rath Co. pork
plant, which at its prime employed 8,000, closed in 1984, and Deere
laid off thousands of workers. Unemployment went as high as 20
percent, the highest in the nation for a few months.
</P>
<P>
   The sting was on par with the Great Depression of the 1930s,
according to Brierly. No permits for new housing construction were
issued between 1982 and 1986, he said. Waterloo's population sank
from 90,000 to 60,000 as young people sought jobs elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   But the economy bounced back in the 1990s as factories retooled
and an array of service industries moved in giving jobs to an eager
and anxious work force. The growth of the service industries such
as Principal Financial Group, a pension fund manager, came at time
when manufacturing was slimming down its labor force.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, with unemployment in the region at 2.5 percent,
the IBP plant had to recruit workers from Bosnia and Mexico to keep
its three shifts fully staffed.

EXCERPTS FROM SUPREME COURT RULING ON CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION
LIMITS 
</HEADLINE>
  (With SCOTUS-FUNDRAISING, SCOTUS-REACT) 
(lb) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following are excerpts from the Supreme Court's
decision Monday upholding Missouri's limits on campaign
contributions. The vote in the case, Nixon vs. Shrink Missouri
Government PAC, was 6-3. Justice David H. Souter wrote the majority
opinion. Justice Clarence P. Thomas wrote a dissent, as did Justice
Anthony M. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   FROM THE DECISION
</P>
<P>
   By Justice Souter
</P>
<P>
   The principal issues in this case are whether Buckley vs. Valeo
is authority for state limits on contributions to state political
candidates and whether the federal limits approved in Buckley, with
or without adjustment for inflation, define the scope of
permissible state limitations today. We hold Buckley to be
authority for comparable state regulation, which need not be pegged
to Buckley's dollars.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the Legislature of Missouri enacted Senate Bill 650 to
restrict the permissible amounts of contributions to candidates for
state office. ... Before the statute became effective, however,
Missouri voters approved a ballot initiative with even stricter
contribution limits, effective immediately. The United States Court
of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit then held the initiative's
contribution limits unconstitutional under the First Amendment. ...
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court treated Missouri's claim of a compelling
interest ``in avoiding the corruption or the perception of
corruption brought about when candidates for elective office accept
large campaign contributions'' as insufficient by itself to satisfy
strict scrutiny. ...
</P>
<P>
   The court thought that the only evidence presented by the state,
an affidavit from the co-chairman of the State Legislature's
Interim Joint Committee on Campaign Finance Reform when the statute
was passed, was inadequate to raise a genuine issue of material
fact about the state's alleged interest in limiting campaign
contributions. ... Given the large number of states that limit
political contributions, we granted certiorari to review the
congruence of the Eighth Circuit's decision with Buckley. We
reverse.
</P>
<P>
   The matters raised in Buckley vs. Valeo ... included claims that
federal campaign finance legislation infringed speech and
association guarantees of the First Amendment and the Equal
Protection Clause of the Fourteenth.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, as amended by the
Federal Election Campaign Act Amendments of 1974, limited (and
still limits) contributions by individuals to any single candidate
for federal office to $1,000 per election ... Until Buckley struck
it down, the law also placed a $1,000 annual ceiling on independent
expenditures linked to specific candidates ... We found violations
of the First Amendment in the expenditure regulations, but held the
contribution restrictions constitutional. ...
</P>
<P>
   We then, however, drew a line between expenditures and
contributions, treating expenditure restrictions as direct
restraints on speech, which nonetheless suffered little direct
effect from contribution limits ... We thus said, in effect, that
limiting contributions left communication significantly unimpaired.
</P>
<P>
   In speaking of ``improper influence'' and ``opportunities for
abuse'' in addition to ``quid pro quo arrangements,'' we recognized
a concern not confined to bribery of public officials, but
extending to the broader threat from politicians too compliant with
the wishes of large contributors.
</P>
<P>
   These were the obvious points behind our recognition that the
Congress could constitutionally address the power of money ``to
influence governmental action'' in ways less ``blatant and specific
than bribery.'' In defending its own statute, Missouri espouses
those same interests of preventing corruption and the appearance of
it that flows from munificent campaign contributions. Even without
the authority of Buckley, there would be no serious question about
the legitimacy of the interests claimed, which, after all, underlie
bribery and anti-gratuity statutes. ... Leave the perception of
impropriety unanswered, and the cynical assumption that large
donors call the tune could jeopardize the willingness of voters to
take part in democratic governance. Democracy works ``only if the
people have faith in those who govern, and that faith is bound to
be shattered when high officials and their appointees engage in
activities which arouse suspicions of malfeasance and corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   Although respondents neither challenge the legitimacy of these
objectives nor call for any reconsideration of Buckley, they take
the state to task, as the court of appeals did, for failing to
justify the invocation of those interests with empirical evidence
of actually corrupt practices or of a perception among Missouri
voters that unrestricted contributions must have been exerting a
covertly corrosive influence. The state statute is not void,
however, for want of evidence. ...
</P>
<P>
   Buckley demonstrates that the dangers of large, corrupt
contributions and the suspicion that large contributions are
corrupt are neither novel nor implausible. ...
</P>
<P>
   There might, of course, be need for a more extensive evidentiary
documentation if petitioners had made any showing of their own to
cast doubt on the apparent implications of Buckley's evidence and
the record here, but the closest respondents come to challenging
these conclusions is their invocation of academic studies said to
indicate that large contributions to public officials or candidates
do not actually result in changes in candidates' positions.
</P>
<P>
   Given the conflict among these publications, and the absence of
any reason to think that public perception has been influenced by
the studies cited by respondents, there is little reason to doubt
that sometimes large contributions will work actual corruption of
our political system, and no reason to question the existence of a
corresponding suspicion among voters. ...
</P>
<P>
   In Buckley, we specifically rejected the contention that $1,000,
or any other amount, was a constitutional minimum below which
legislatures could not regulate. As indicated above, we referred
instead to the outer limits of contribution regulation by asking
whether there was any showing that the limits were so low as to
impede the ability of candidates to ``amass the resources necessary
for effective advocacy.''
</P>
<P>
   We asked, in other words, whether the contribution limitation
was so radical in effect as to render political association
ineffective, drive the sound of a candidate's voice below the level
of notice, and render contributions pointless. ...
</P>
<P>
   There is no reason in logic or evidence to doubt the sufficiency
of Buckley to govern this case in support of the Missouri statute.
The judgment of the court of appeals is, accordingly, reversed, and
the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
</P>
<P>
   It is so ordered.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   FROM THE DISSENT
</P>
<P>
   By Justice Thomas
</P>
<P>
   In the process of ratifying Missouri's sweeping repression of
political speech, the court today adopts the analytic fallacies of
our flawed decision in Buckley vs. Valeo. ... Unfortunately, the
court is not content to merely adhere to erroneous precedent. Under
the guise of applying Buckley, the court proceeds to weaken the
already enfeebled constitutional protection that Buckley afforded
campaign contributions. ...
</P>
<P>
   Our decision in Buckley was in error, and I would overrule it. I
would subject campaign contribution limitations to strict scrutiny,
under which Missouri's contribution limits are patently
unconstitutional. I begin with a proposition that ought to be
unassailable: Political speech is the primary object of First
Amendment protection.
</P>
<P>
   The founders sought to protect the rights of individuals to
engage in political speech because a self-governing people depends
upon the free exchange of political information. And that free
exchange should receive the most protection when it matters the
most during campaigns for elective office. ... I do not start with
these foundational principles because the court openly disagrees
with them. I start with them because the court today abandons them.
For nearly half a century, this court has extended First Amendment
protection to a multitude of forms of ``speech,'' such as making
false defamatory statements, filing lawsuits, dancing nude,
exhibiting drive-in movies with nudity, burning flags and wearing
military uniforms. ... In light of the many cases of this sort,
today's decision is a most curious anomaly.
</P>
<P>
   In my view, the Constitution leaves it entirely up to citizens
and candidates to determine who shall speak, the means they will
use and the amount of speech sufficient to inform and persuade.
Buckley's ratification of the government's attempt to wrest this
fundamental right from citizens was error.
</P>
<P>
   FROM THE DISSENT
</P>
<P>
   By Justice Kennedy
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision has lasting consequences for political
speech in the course of elections, the speech upon which democracy
depends. Yet in defining the controlling standard of review and
applying it to the urgent claim presented, the court seems almost
indifferent. Its analysis would not be acceptable for the routine
case of a single protester with a hand-scrawled sign ... or a
driver who taped over the motto on his license plate because he
disagreed with its message. ...
</P>
<P>
   The plain fact is that the compromise the court invented in
Buckley set the stage for a new kind of speech to enter the
political system. It is covert speech. The court has forced a
substantial amount of political speech underground, as contributors
and candidates devise ever more elaborate methods of avoiding
contribution limits, limits which take no account of rising
campaign costs.
</P>
<P>
   To defend its extension of Buckley to present times, the court,
of course, recites the dangers of corruption, or the appearance of
corruption, when an interested person contributes money to a
candidate. What the court does not do is examine and defend the
substitute it has encouraged, covert speech funded by unlimited
soft money. In my view that system creates dangers greater than the
one it has replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Among the facts the court declines to take into account is the
emergence of cyberspace communication by which political
contributions can be reported almost simultaneously with payment.
The public can then judge for itself whether the candidate or the
officeholder has so overstepped that we no longer trust him or her
to make a detached and neutral judgment. ...
</P>
<P>
   I would overrule Buckley and then free Congress or state
legislatures to attempt some new reform, if, based upon their own
considered view of the First Amendment, it is possible to do so.
Until any re-examination takes place, however, the existing
distortion of speech caused by the half-way house we created in
Buckley ought to be eliminated.

balloon in Des Moines when the descent of the survivors on New
Hampshire began.
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Bill Bradley, sorely needing to make up for lost
time after a disappointing showing in Iowa, was due to land here at
1:45 a.m. today. Texas Gov. George Bush, the easy winner Monday but
facing a tougher test here, was due to land less than an hour
later. Arizona Sen. John McCain, sticking to his strategy, was here
already.

   The rest _ with the likely exception of Sen. Orrin Hatch, who
may have had enough _ will not be far behind.
</P>
<P>
   From a reporter's viewpoint, the frenzied week of campaigning
leading up to the New Hampshire primary will be a more satisfying
exercise. The outcome in both parties is in doubt here, and the
contest _ pretty much like primary elections anywhere _ is much
easier to understand than the caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   But in the long run _ which in this crazed gallop of a
nominating process only means a few weeks from now _ it is more
likely to be the results from Iowa that tell the tale.
</P>
<P>
   The solid wins that Bush and Vice President Al Gore put together
in Iowa followed a formula both frontrunners will be returning to,
as soon as the New Hampshire spree comes to an end. In both cases
it consists of tons of establishment support, undergirding the
desire of voters in both parties to go with a proven commodity.
</P>
<P>
   The voters in New Hampshire are a more rambunctious lot, and
they aren't likely to take their cue from the caucus results. But
Iowa still may have a large impact on what happens here next week.
</P>
<P>
   There's bound to be a lot of talk this week about whether
Bradley should have done as McCain did and passed on Iowa. In a
two-man race, it would have been tougher to ignore an early state,
but by committing so much money and time on a losing effort,
Bradley returns to New Hampshire in weaker condition than he left
it a short time ago.
</P>
<P>
   It should also be noted that McCain paid a price for skipping
Iowa. He spotted Bush a victory when he can't afford to give up
many. There was talk McCain would finish third without even trying
_ but he didn't.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone surpassed expectations on caucus night it was Steve
Forbes, who got more than 20 percent of the Republican caucus vote.
That's likely to encourage Forbes to pour more resources into New
Hampshire, where he's been gaining strength.
</P>
<P>
   That could put more pressure on Bush. But in a perverse way it
could also make the going tougher for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The two challengers draw their votes from different parts of the
Republican Party. But if Forbes ups his margin here, the overall
outcome will be more diluted. So even if McCain does hand Bush a
defeat in New Hampshire next week, it's less likely to be the
clear-cut win he needs to catapult into the big-state primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Keyes' third-place finish in the Republican caucuses may be
due in part to the money he poured into advertising in the last few
days of the campaign, but it deserves some examination. It would
appear Keyes fired up religious conservatives more than his rival
Gary Bauer, and he probably also benefited from the experience of
running for president four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   What the two-three-four finish of Forbes, Keyes and Bauer seems
to say is that religious conservatives still play a dominant role
among the Republican hard-core.
</P>
<P>
   Religious conservatives are not expected to be in as prominent a
role when the campaign swings into a national focus. But never
discount the resolve of people willing brave the Iowa cold to vote
for candidates they know aren't going to finish first. They may
have more to say about this election than has been generally
thought.

<P>
   PARIS _ A designer whose career hangs in limbo requests a
meeting with a journalist in the hope of receiving more
``personal'' consideration. A press agent for a French house
invites reporters to preview its collection, so the designer can
explain his ideas; and a few days later their reviews are cozily
full of those very ideas. In Milan, still another publicist reacts
to a bad review by primly scolding the writer for not attending a
preview, where she would have ``understood'' the designer's finer
points.
</P>
<P>
   All these are nothing more than crude attempts to spin a story _
something political columnists and Hollywood reporters face
everyday, but with this difference: the fashion spin doctors are
better dressed and they can say ``chic'' without sounding like
Farmer Brown going out to inspect the henhouse.
</P>
<P>
   On the face of it, an undertaking as superficial and already
guaranteed of a certain amount of breathlessness as a fashion show
(``Darling, those  &UR; knits &LR;  ... '') would hardly seem to require
spin. Every season, designers trot out their latest clothes, and if
it is a big show, 1,500 editors and writers scrutinize them,
eventually turning out thousands of pages and columns of fashion
news. The process itself is not very objective, nor does it
encourage editorial independence, since even the most flagrantly
banal designer knows he will get some coverage in the magazines if
he is a big advertiser.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is trickier for writers with newspapers and
serious magazines, although some of their attempts to outfox the
hounds and go around the process are practically legend. John
Fairchild, the former publisher of Women's Wear Daily, once put a
man with a telescope and a sketchpad up in a room opposite
Balenciaga's studio, so the paper could get the scoop on the
master's collection. Eugenia Sheppard of The New York Herald
Tribune was known to tomahawk many a tender ego, and Kennedy
Fraser, following the acerbic Lois Long at The New Yorker, coolly
addressed a general suspicion about fashion journalists when she
wrote, ``Haute couture is a degenerate institution propped up by a
sycophantic press.''
</P>
<P>
   There are signs now of greater independence, with journalists
scrutinizing the shows much as entertainment or cultural critics
would. Yet, as designers reach wildly for ideas, as the shows
themselves become forms of theater and the houses see the unlimited
potential for exploiting brands through new media, the need for
spin control becomes greater.
</P>
<P>
   One has only to look at the recent round of men's shows in Milan
and the haute couture collections in Paris to see how this works _
and more to the point, how a well-placed word or slick reference
can influence opinion and what mere mortals inevitably read in the
fashion columns.
</P>
<P>
   At her men's wear show on Jan. 8, Donatella Versace told
reporters the clothes were inspired by the raw style in ``Fight
Club,'' the recent Brad Pitt movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Donatella knew what she was talking about, to be
honest,'' said Tim Blanks, who, as the host for the cable
television show ``Fashion File,'' is a regular backstage presence.
And indeed, the behind-the-scenes talk among design assistants at
the Versace show was that the inspiration had been the Mine Shaft,
the notorious New York gay sex club _ hardly the sort of image a
top _ even a racy _ Milanese fashion house wants to put across.
</P>
<P>
   But a Brad Pitt movie was. And even though a couple of critics
took the idea apart, the ``Fight Club'' reference became the
dominant sound bite of the shows. You could tell, by the following
week in the London papers, that some writers didn't have a clue
what the movie was about. They just wanted to be on the bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, one can argue that such information is useful, even
interesting. In the old days, back in the hushed era of Balenciaga
and Mme. Gres, designers seldom spoke to the press, and they
certainly never had to confront a barrage of those television
cameras that make clever repartee essential. But successful
designers and sharp-eyed publicists know that catchy phrases are
being passed out along with the facts.
</P>
<P>
   A similar situation occurred last week when Christian Dior
invited a handful of senior writers, one by one, to preview John
Galliano's spring haute couture collection a few days before the
show. The practice of previewing collections is not new; it largely
serves magazine editors who want a heads-up so they can plan
photography sessions. It also serves the promotional interests of a
fashion house, which can use the informality of a preview to get
across obscure or controversial themes, like those in Galliano's
tramp show, which caused a sensation in the French press.
</P>
<P>
   To a lesser extent, previews are also an undisguised attempt by
a house to establish, as a Dior press agent once told me, ``a more
personal contact'' with a journalist, especially one who has been
critical. Think of it as an attempt to diffuse a bomb.
</P>
<P>
   But this can also backfire. Last September, Calvin Klein invited
me to preview his spring line, which was based in part, he said, on
the nerdy style of London teen-agers _ skinny belts and so on. But
as he spoke, my attention was drawn to an elegant portrait of Nicky
de Gunzburg, the famous Vogue editor, who had been Klein's mentor.
I couldn't help wondering why he'd look to London teen-agers when
he had his own remarkable history and style to drawn upon. It was
just spin.
</P>
<P>
   As it was at Dior. Galliano had compiled books of pertinent
photographs, including some by Diane Arbus, and other pictures and
drawings that were mounted on the walls of the Dior studio in a
collage of the down-and-out inspiration. The images, and the
clothes themselves were intriguing.
</P>
<P>
   But in the days after the show, it was hard not to feel that the
journalists who duly reported Galliano's themes without bothering
to analyze them had, in effect, become his accomplices. They were
making the outrageous and the weird seem utterly acceptable, even
important, by peppering their reviews with those spoon-fed arty
references to tramp balls and Egon Schiele as though they had just
sprung to mind.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Most designers don't need to explain their collections. They are
what they are, and anyone looking at, say, Jean Paul Gaultier's
spring couture show would know, from the cut of the cloth to the
twist of the turbans, that it is about modern French chic.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, whether its methods are right or wrong, Dior is ahead of
the game. Christian Dior himself once said that he didn't care what
critics wrote as long as his clothes made the front page. Bernard
Arnault, the chairman of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, which
owns Dior, has pushed that further. The last thing he wants for
Dior's brand image is bourgeois-looking clothes. And it's
interesting that of all the shows last week, the one that looks the
best on television _ that sustains interest beyond mundane matters
of taste and beauty _ is Dior's. By contrast, even Gaultier's
ineffable chic looks strangely inert.
</P>
<P>
   Last Saturday, Arnault, dressed in weekend jeans, was up in
Dior's showroom, where members of the sales staff were having their
first look at Galliano's early-fall collection, which accounts for
70 percent of Dior's ready-to-wear sales. The clothes incorporate
the hobo themes, but in sanitized ready-to-wear versions.
</P>
<P>
   When Galliano was over to the side talking to someone, Arnault
made a comment that said a great deal about himself and the fashion
business. He said of the controversy surrounding Galliano's couture
collection, ``People are not smart enough to understand.''
</P>
<P>
   It is true that the public may not understand the economics of
couture _ how, in effect, the spin has become the story,
transforming headlines into money-making purses with jangling Dior
logos. But neither are people so gullible as to believe everything
they hear.

ANOTHER MAJOR STEP FOR CAPRIATI: SEMIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MELBOURNE _ Beyond burnout? Burst from the bonds of
embarrassment, uncertainty, even ridicule?
</P>
<P>
   Can this be Jennifer Capriati emerging from her very own horror
show to rub strong shoulders again with the elite on that narrow
precipice, the semifinals of a major tennis championship, the
Australian Open? Four survive at Melbourne Park, and Capriati _ a
survivor of too much bad press, over-hype and under-care,
self-doubt and drug-store psychiatry from all directions _ is among
them.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years have passed since her last visit to a major semi:
the US Open of 1991, when she slugged it out mercilessly with
another teen-ager, the champ-to-be Monica Seles, and came within 2
points of winning.
</P>
<P>
   After flailing plucky Japanese Ai Sugiyama, 6-0, 6-2, the
unseeded Capriati beamed as she said, ``Let's see, I've been in the
semis of the French (1990), Wimbledon, and the US (1991) as a kid.
Now the Australian at 23. That's OK, isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   Somebody asked her if she was pinching herself at this unlikely
stroke of good fortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nope,'' she said. ``There's still a way to go. The pinch can
wait.''
</P>
<P>
   The punch couldn't. She seemed the Jennerator of almost
forgotten distinction in hammering her groundies past No. 23-ranked
Sugiyama after digging out of a break point in the opening game
resoundingly with an overhead smash. There was no holding Capriati
after that, although the game Sugiyama ran ceaselessly in trying.
Sugiyama had won their last two meetings, and had knocked off an
ex-champ, No. 5 Mary Pierce, in the fourth round, but her fourth
clash with Capriati was a Tuesday morning nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Capriati begged reporters at last year's US Open to quit
bringing up her past, then melted away in tears. A vain, probably
foolish cry for relief. It would be just as easy for Red Sox
chroniclers and loyalists to stop recalling the Curse of the
Bambino.
</P>
<P>
   Hers was the curse of growing up in public too early. It started
from the moment her father, Stefano Capriati, turned her
professional in the carnival atmosphere of a tour tourney at Boca
Raton, Fla., a decade ago. She was not yet 14, but her parents,
agents, and the Women's Tennis Association led her on board a
roller coaster that took the inevitable downward rush when she
rebelled against it all in 1993, and was caught up in youthful
mistakes a year later.
</P>
<P>
   The joy was gone. It appears to have returned, not just the
restoration of a winning athlete, but a young woman, composed and
comfortable with herself. She's creating a new present to dim the
past she flees (although it wasn't as bad or extraordinary as the
headlines screeched). Having written numerous painful
Capriati-crash pieces centering on teen-age trauma, I'm delighted
to go in another direction.
</P>
<P>
   She had tried several comebacks that didn't stick. Then, last
March, she took a very right turn by hiring Harold Solomon as her
coach. The first contact was made by her father, but Solomon (``I
didn't believe Jennifer genuinely meant it'') told him, no way
unless he heard from Jennifer herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``She convinced me over the phone and has been convincing me
ever since that she was sincere about working,'' said Solomon.
</P>
<P>
   It's a three-pronged effort at a renaissance: Capriati plus
Solomon plus physical trainer Karen Burnett.
</P>
<P>
   ``Karen has worked me like you wouldn't believe,'' said
Capriati. ``Really hard. I thought I worked at tennis when I was a
kid, but it came pretty easily at 15. This is really work. But
Karen does it in a way that it's fun, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Solomon said cautiously, ``She's not the player she was at 15 or
16. Yet. But she's moving forward.''
</P>
<P>
   And, undeniably, moving better on court, maturing in her tennis
approach, thinking out points instead of just thumping powerfully,
letting the shots fall where they may.

TRIUMPH OF THE CENTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES _ The breeze that blew across the great American
prairie Monday night was cool but moderate.
</P>
<P>
   With the eyes of the nation monitoring the political climate of
Iowa, caucus-goers in both major parties sent an unmistakable
message. From the middle of the country came a firm endorsement of
the middle of the political spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   In towns and crossroads and urban centers from the Missouri
River in the west to the Mississippi in the east _ from Ackley to
Zwingle, communities that comprise not only the heartland but the
heart of the heartland _ the verdict was clear and in its way
unremarkable.
</P>
<P>
   The triumph of the center is not an unusual American political
phenomenon, to be sure. But the public usually works its way back
to the center in the autumn after probing the far extremes in the
winter and spring, and for that reason the twin victories of Vice
President Al Gore in the Democratic caucuses and of Texas Governor
George W. Bush in the Republican caucuses send an important message
to the two coasts and the rest of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The voices of this year's Iowa caucuses, held in far-flung
community centers and church basements and coffee shops, were the
voices of contentment.
</P>
<P>
   Now the race moves to New Hampshire, the graveyard of political
assumptions and the charnel house of frontrunners, with a reminder
that the Monday night victories of Bush and Gore _ baby-boomers
from different dynasties and possessed of different temperaments _
are only a tentative signal. They are indicative of the public _
but not binding on the public.
</P>
<P>
   Overnight, and with remarkable speed, as campaign planes took
off from Des Moines throughout the evening, the focus already has
shifted from the midwest to the northeast, and a week from today
the voters of New Hampshire will have their say and sway.
</P>
<P>
   The movement of the candidates, the campaign retinues, the
correspondents and the commentators from Iowa to New Hampshire is a
symbol of the beginning of the next scene in America's greatest
civic drama. In the next week the certainties of the plains can
swiftly become the uncertainties of the mountains, the surefooted
can stumble and the verities of this morning can be set aside with
ease, sometimes with glee.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the two frontrunners have been under siege in New
Hampshire, battered by two candidates whose performances Monday
night in Iowa were disappointing. Senator John McCain of Arizona
barely competed in Iowa but hoped for a stealthy insurgency in
Republican caucuses; it never materialized. Former Senator Bill
Bradley of New Jersey conducted a spirited campaign here and had
counted on a surprisingly strong showing; that didn't occur,
either.
</P>
<P>
   In the Republican race, Bush is also now facing a more serious
challenge from Steve Forbes, who now can legitimately claim to be
the repository of the hopes of conservatives who have not embraced
the Texas governor. That position is buttressed by the endorsement
of the Manchester Union Leader, a strong voice of conservative
sentiment in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   However, the major beneficiary of the Forbes surge could be
McCain, who appears best positioned to exploit any weakness that
may emerge in Bush.
</P>
<P>
   All the challengers now are conducting underdog campaigns in an
atmosphere far different from the one that prevailed only hours
ago. The new presidential race is a lot like the old presidential
race except for one important change. The insurgents' targets have
actual public victories to their credit and some measure of what
Governor Bush's father, himself an insurgent Iowa victor in 1980,
described as the ``big mo,'' or momentum.
</P>
<P>
   And, in the Republican Party, publisher Forbes' strong showing
makes him a bigger factor in New Hampshire than he was considered
only hours ago.
</P>
<P>
   The shape of presidential race, however, isn't as streamlined as
it suddenly seems.
</P>
<P>
   The two establishment candidates won big victories in a state
which is finding prosperity in new ventures but suffering
widespread economic distress in the old, particularly in the farm
regions that are the heart of the state's heritage. Now those two
establishment candidates face insurgencies in a state that is
ablaze with economic growth and abloom with economic contentment.
</P>
<P>
   So while Iowa, with key sectors of its economy and way of life
under attack, chose the safe candidates and turned away from the
populists, New Hampshire is giving a close look to the populists
and is resisting the safe candidates.
</P>
<P>
   And yet a measure of the contentment that prevails in the
country is that the four figures at the top of the heap _ the safe
and the populist both _ are, in truth, figures of the center
themselves. One of the insurgents is a third-generation Navy man in
a country where the military has never been an outsider political
force. The other is a graduate of one of the Ivy League's Big
Three, a Rhodes Scholar and a professional athlete. Neither
represents a threat to the public order _ though both say they
would change the game forever for big money campaign contributors
and the candidates who depend on them.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth figure in the campaign, Forbes, is himself a
multi-millionaire publisher and a sturdy pillar of the conservative
establishment.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates are so firmly planted in the middle that the
insurgents _ one a Democrat, the other a Republican _ are
effectively competing in next week's primary in part against each
other. The prize: independent voters who pride themselves on their
position in the center, and their willingness to move from one
party to the other.

AT NEARLY $22 BILLION, GATES FOUNDATION NOW WORLD'S BIGGEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RUTH SCHUBERT  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Five short months ago, the Bill and Melinda Gates
Foundation was merely the wealthiest philanthropy in the country.
Now, it's the biggest in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation confirmed Monday that a $5 billion contribution
from the Microsoft founder and his wife boosted the foundation's
assets to $21.8 billion. That pushed it ahead of the Wellcome Trust
in Britain, which has assets worth about $21.4 billion in U.S.
dollars, according to The Chronicle of Philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   The Gates Foundation's ranking as the leading philanthropy in
the world gives them an extra measure of status as the
trend-setters in charitable giving, said Stacy Palmer, editor of
The Chronicle of Philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more in the symbolism,'' said Palmer, whose Washington,
D.C.-based publication reports on nonprofit organizations. ``It
just makes them sort of more important.''
</P>
<P>
   To those at the Gates Foundation as well, the new ranking is
viewed as largely symbolic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the size is less important to us than the
tremendous responsibility that comes with using the resources in an
effective way,'' said Trevor Neilson, communications director for
the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The monetary value of the philanthropy has grown rapidly in the
past year. The Gateses poured $15.1 billion in assets into the
family's philanthropic entities last year. In August, the family
consolidated two foundations into a single philanthropic powerhouse
worth $17.1 billion at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal tax laws, the foundation is required to give away
at least 5 percent of its assets each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bill (and) Melinda Gates Foundation will continue to focus
on helping to improve people's lives primarily through health and
learning,'' foundation co-chair Patty Stonesifer said in a
statement. ``Particular attention will go towards accelerating the
development and distribution of life-saving vaccines.''
</P>
<P>
   The foundation is staffed by about 120 people, the bulk of them
dedicated to the foundation's project to wire all of the nation's
public libraries. To manage the exponential growth, the Gates
Foundation has relied largely on outside experts for advice and
established organizations for implementation of their
multi-billion-dollar giving, Neilson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of trying to build massive amounts of expertise
in-house, we rely on other organizations to come to us with
proposals and help us implement programs,'' Neilson said.
</P>
<P>
   The $1 billion Gates Millennium Scholars Program, for example,
is being administered largely by the United Negro College Fund. The
scholarships, announced in September, are designed to increase the
number of minority students completing undergraduate and graduate
degree.
</P>
<P>
   In November, the foundation gave $750 million to establish The
Global Fund for Children's Vaccines, which will pay for vaccines
and immunization programs in developing countries and support
research into new vaccines and therapies. The fund will be guided
by a consortium led by the World Health Organization, UNICEF and
the World Bank.

even if the caucus votes had not gone to the messenger.
</P>
<P>
   At St. James Lutheran Church, Jack Sullivan put his hands
together hard for Alan Keyes, the radio talk-show host who aspires
to be the Republican presidential nominee. But he cast his ballot
for George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's articulate and he has a lot of good things to say,'' said
Sullivan, 37, a building contractor. ``I just don't think he has
the broad base to go to the next level, unfortunately. As bad as it
sounds, the No. 1 goal for me is to get someone elected tonight who
I think can win.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day and and into the early evening, the Keyes
campaign stuck to its one hard and fast rule: No predictions on the
balloting. First place or third place in Iowa, campaign workers and
supporters said again and again, the conservative Keyes is in the
race for the long run.
</P>
<P>
   As Anne Breiling, the candidate's deputy chief of staff, put it,
``As the saying goes, work like it depends on you. Pray like it
depends on God.''
</P>
<P>
   God and the moral fiber of America were major themes of the
Keyes campaign as he criss-crossed the state, themes that resonated
with voters here and appeared to give him a boost in recent days.
Monday night, Keyes registered in the mid-double digits _ better
than many had expected but still not enough for the second-place
showing ahead of Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters, in part, blamed Keyes' third-place finish out of a
GOP field of six on what they called the media's refusal to
highlight his conservative positions, which include opposition to
abortion and the federal income tax. In Iowa, his campaign has a
list of 4,000 volunteers to draw on, said John Block, an advance
man for the candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do I like about him? Everything,'' said Tom Hoefling, who
took a leave of absence from his job as political director for the
Iowa Conservative Coalition five weeks ago to become a volunteer
field organizer for Keyes. ``The way he speaks from his heart
appeals to everyone. People who hear him become converts. We've
just got to make sure more people get a chance to hear him.''
</P>
<P>
   Keyes spent much of Monday being heard on Iowa radio, starting
the morning at a station that typically plays heavy metal music and
then moving on to a program hosted by someone even more
conservative than he is. He used his few minutes at the church,
where both Bush and Forbes had placards prominently displayed and
he had none, to stress the problems confronting the country and
that only Republicans can solve them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not have an economic crisis; we do not have an
international crisis,'' Keyes said. ``We must address the moral
crisis of our country. . . . If it is to be saved, Republicans must
save it.''
</P>
<P>
   Keyes' comments won a standing ovation from the audience, which
tended toward the older side. Back at the Holiday Inn, where Keyes
supporters were gathering in a modest banquet room decorated with
small bunches of balloons, the enthusiasm was just starting to grow
mid-evening, although it was unlikely to top a Sunday night event
that drew 1,000 people and had Keyes falling backward into a
``mosh'' pit of young supporters in order to win a dare.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's that kind of campaign,'' Block said. ``Alan Keyes often
gets pegged as a stiff, right-wing guy. Constitutionally and
morally he's right on every issue. But he's also a fun guy, and
people are just starting to see who he is.''

<P>
   MIAMI _ After 60 days of posturing and rhetoric, the power of a
grandmother's love brought Elian Gonzalez achingly close to a
reunion with his Cuban family.
</P>
<P>
   But then fear overwhelmed that love.
</P>
<P>
   In yet another bizarre twist, the two Cuban grandmothers of the
boy at the center of an international tug-of-war flew from New York
to Miami on Monday. However, they stopped short of driving to the
Little Havana home where the boy has been living with his Miami
relatives since he was found floating in an inner tube off Fort
Lauderdale on Thanksgiving Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were not confident of the security arrangements,
particularly when we found out the family wanted to make this a
circus,'' said Bob Edgar, general secretary of the National Council
of Churches, which arranged the grandmothers' trip to the United
States. ``The grandmothers felt that if they could not effect a
meeting tonight in a neutral place, then they were safer returning
to Washington D.C.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, after touching down at Tamiami Airport about 4 p.m. EST,
the women's chartered jet took off again about 8:30 p.m. EST,
headed for Washington. They were to meet Tuesday with Congressional
representatives who are sympathetic to sending the boy back to
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the first day of the new congressional session,
Florida Republican Sen. Connie Mack introduced a bill to give Elian
U.S. citizenship, which would free him from INS jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of the bill is to move the decision-making about
the boy from out of the hands of the (Immigration and
Naturalization Service) and into the hands of the court,'' said
Mack, whose bill was one of three filed in both the House and
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami developments outraged Elian's relatives here, who were
on their way to the airport to negotiate with the grandmothers when
the jet took off.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a travesty,'' said Spencer Eig, one of the family's
attorneys. ``To add insult to injury ... as we were coming to the
airport, these poor women were hustled onto a plane that took
off.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday, Miami television station WSVN reported that Elian's
great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez would travel with other family
representatives to Washington Tuesday _ possibly to meet with
members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   As for Elian, it was unclear how or when he heard the news that
his beloved grandmothers _ one of whom took a major role in raising
him _ were only 15 miles away, but departed without seeing him. The
boy's Miami relatives had told Elian that his grandmothers were
coming to see him.
</P>
<P>
   It was yet another sad chapter in a case that has seen the
passion of politics overwhelm blood ties.
</P>
<P>
   While Edgar remained in Miami to be available for negotiations
with the family for a possible reunion in the coming days, the
Miami family was clearly stung badly by the developments.
</P>
<P>
   The grandmothers _ Raquel Rodriguez and Mariela Quintana _ were
reportedly afraid of going to the Little Havana house, which was
surrounded by dozens of journalists and hundreds of Cuban exiles.
In the past, the exiles have vowed to form a human chain around the
boy to keep him from returning to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday their leaders promised that the women would be met
with a warm reception. As word filtered out that the grandmothers
were headed to Miami, a crowd began gathering in the street outside
the home, and exile leaders exhorted them to be on their best
behavior. They handed out carnations and other flowers for them to
wave as the women arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to show the world that we are a community that can
show love and respect and that we aren't violent like Fidel Castro
says we are,'' said Ramon Saul Sanchez, leader of the anti-Castro
Democracy Movement. ``Wave your flowers when they arrive, don't
throw them. And remain silent.''
</P>
<P>
   But the moment never came.
</P>
<P>
   And as the grandmothers jetted away into the cool Miami night,
it was unclear whether the stalemate would ever be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Monday's bizarre events, both sides of the family
had been critical of the other in comments to the media.
</P>
<P>
   The grandmothers have said the Miami family is controlled by
Miami's exile extremists and that they are cashing in on the boy's
celebrity. Elian's Miami relatives have said the grandmothers are
controlled by Cuban dictator Fidel Castro and that they haven't
shown remorse for the boy's mother, who drowned on the crossing
from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The grandmothers _ here representing Elian's father, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez _ arrived in the United States from Cuba on Friday, flying
to New York as the guest of the National Council of Churches, which
favors returning the boy to Cuba. They met in Washington with U.S.
Attorney Janet Reno Saturday, making a tearful plea to at least see
their grandson, if not take him home to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Although both sides of the family told media over the weekend
that they had not communicated, Reno apparently got in touch with
the Miami family's attorneys and brokered the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear what bearing the reunion might have on other
facets of the case. The Miami family's lawsuit to keep the boy here
was expected to move forward this week, with government lawyers
filing a response to the family's complaint. U.S. District Judge
William Hoeveler is expected to schedule a hearing on the matter
once he receives the government response.
</P>
<P>
   Also undaunted, members of Congress took up Elian's case Monday,
all in an effort to block efforts by the INS to return the boy to
his father in Cuba prior to a state court hearing pitting his
relatives in Cuba and Miami in a custody battle.
</P>
<P>
   Mack said ``neither the president of the United States, his
attorney general, nor the dictator ruling Cuba are qualified to
decide the fate of this little boy.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., who filed a companion to Mack's bill
along with Reps. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Lincoln Diaz-Balart _ both
Miami Republicans born in Cuba _ said ``the best interest of Elian
must be our top priority. Any decision made by a governmental
agency is contrary to his best interest and clearly against his
mother's desires. While this legislation does not dictate an
outcome, it ensures that the rule of law is applied, upheld, and
enforced.''
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said President Clinton is
concerned that congressional action may become ``a political
debate, rather than the substantive debate that it should be,'' but
he added that ``if they pass something, obviously, we'll take a
look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Mack noted his bill was being sponsored by three Republicans and
three Democrats, including _ Bob Graham, Florida's senior senator.
</P>
<P>
   Graham said he supported the bill because the INS decision that
only Elian's father could speak for him was unfair to the boy and
others like him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It denies them the opportunity to have their options weighed
by an experienced child custody jurist using the standard of 'what
is in the best interest of the child.' `` he said.
</P>
<P>
   The competing House bills offer young Elian either U.S.
citizenship or permanent residency status by waiving numerous
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   The residency bill filed by Rep. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., with
support from Reps. Peter Deutsch, D-Fla., and Patrick Kennedy,
D-R.I., would waive a provision in immigration law that would
cancel Elian's permanent residency status if he returned to Cuba
for more than six months.
</P>
<P>
   Menendez said his bill would avoid questions about granting
citizenship to a person who had not requested it. A Menendez
spokesman said that if the competing citizenship bill appeared to
have enough support to pass the House, Menendez would support it.

 &HT;    Bush thankful for victory, but unwilling to speculate on New
Hampshire
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ George W. Bush said he was ``grateful'' for a
``solid victory'' in the Iowa caucuses Monday night, but he
resisted predictions of how it would affect his next contest in New
Hampshire, where he was scheduled to head late Monday night in time
for a 2:30 a.m. rally at the Manchester, N.H., airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``That remains to be seen,'' he said when asked if the Iowa
results would help him next week. ``The people of New Hampshire are
independent-minded voters.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign, however, worked hard to counter Steve Forbes'
effort to claim success in a second-place finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message (to Forbes) is 'Bush is the frontrunner and you
had your best shot,' `` said Karl Rove, Bush's top adviser. ``You
took your best shot and you came up short.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is his high watermark,'' Rove said of Forbes. ``New
Hampshire might be the same for John McCain. It's the state in
which he has spent a lot of time and energy and effort. He is
spending as much money as we are and it's going to be a competitive
race.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also declined to read much into partial returns showing
McCain garnering 5 percent of the Iowa vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``John didn't campaign here,'' said Bush. ``I don't think we
should hold him to a high standard.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it is important for the Republican nominee to
campaign in all the states, but he made a different decision. You
need to get him to explain why he made that decision,'' Bush said.
``John's a good man. I look forward to campaigning with him and
against him in the state of New Hampshire. We've got a great race
going on there and I'm looking forward to getting there.''

JUDGE DECLINES TO HALT PAPER'S DISTRIBUTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This story does not carry a byline) 
(js) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A federal judge refused to issue a temporary restraining order
Monday that would have limited distribution of a new free newspaper
in Philadelphia only to areas where other papers are sold.
</P>
<P>
   The refusal, if it stands, would eventually allow the newspaper,
Metro _ which is sponsored by the regional transportation agency _
to be distributed on station concourses, bus platforms and subway
stations.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those areas are off-limits to other publications, and
three newspaper companies brought the suit to halt Metro's
distribution. But Judge Robert Kelly in Philadelphia ruled that the
plaintiffs had failed to show that they would suffer immediate and
irreparable harm if the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation
Authority, or Septa, allowed distribution on subway platforms, at
bus stops or other sites where it does not now permit other
publications.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Schwartz, a lawyer for Philadelphia Newspapers Inc., the
unit of Knight Ridder that publishes The Philadelphia Inquirer and
The Philadelphia Daily News, said he was preparing a notice of
appeal and would ask Kelly for an injunction pending the appeal.
Like the other plaintiffs _ The New York Times Co. and the Gannett
Co. _ Philadelphia Newspapers argued that Metro's relationship with
Septa, a regional agency, was unconstitutional and unfair.
</P>
<P>
   Metro _ distributed by 140 vendors in stations from 69th Street
to the downtown Suburban station Monday _ is not yet available in
any areas barred to other publications. But that should change by
early next month, unless the courts intervene.
</P>
<P>
   The tabloid paper is owned by the Modern Times Group of Sweden,
which publishes transit-based free papers in several European
cities.

 McCAIN REMOVED FROM PRIMARY BALLOT IN TWO DISTRICTS  
(lb) 
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After petition challenges by the Republican State
Committee, election officials have thrown Sen. John McCain off the
ballot in the New York presidential primary in one congressional
district in the South Bronx and another in Suffolk County.
</P>
<P>
   The decisions are the first in the effort by the state's
Republican establishment, which is vigorously supporting Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas, to try to fend off McCain by asserting
that his campaign has not gathered enough signatures to comply with
the complicated rules for winning a spot in the March 7 primary.
</P>
<P>
   The state party has filed challenges to McCain's nominating
petitions in 16 of the state's 31 congressional districts. In the
New York system, Republican presidential candidates are required to
qualify for the primary, district by district.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, New York City election officials disqualified McCain
in the 16th congressional district in the South Bronx, which is
represented by Jose E. Serrano, said Henry Berger, a McCain
campaign lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Berger said the campaign withstood challenges in two districts
in Queens _ the 6th, represented by Gregory W. Meeks, and the 7th,
represented by Joseph Crowley. But the campaign has been
disqualified from the 2nd district in Suffolk, represented by Rick
Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   Decisions on the McCain campaign's fight against challenges in
one city district _ the 12th in Brooklyn, which is represented by
Nydia Velazquez _ as well as in Nassau County and upstate are
expected by the end of the week. Both sides are likely to continue
the fight over some of the districts in state court.
</P>
<P>
   Another Republican candidate, Steve Forbes, has spent $750,000
on petition gatherers and a lawyer in an attempt to get on the
ballot across the state. The state Republican Party did not
challenge the Forbes petitions, but some Republican officials on
Long Island who are supporting Bush did successfully challenge
them. In response, the Forbes campaign has filed some challenges
against the Bush campaign.

 FOR FORBES, ORGANIZATION AND MONEY PAY OFF IN IOWA 
</HEADLINE>
  (With IOWA-CAUCUSES and related stories) 
(mk) 
 By LESLIE WAYNE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST DES MOINES, Iowa _ After spending more time in Iowa than
any other candidate and digging deeply into his own pockets to
finance his campaign, Steve Forbes' bet on the Iowa caucuses seems
to have paid off.
</P>
<P>
   What a difference four years makes. In 1996, he entered the
state late, had little organization and came in a distant fourth.
This time, learning from that episode, he mounted a lavish
campaign, organized a formidable grass-roots organization and
positioned himself as the champion of the conservative wing of the
Republican party.
</P>
<P>
   And, though he had plenty of competition for the conservative
vote, Forbes' twin messages _ anti-tax and anti-abortion _ were
strong enough to propel him into a strong second-place showing and
give him the bounce he sought to carry him into New Hampshire for
its primary next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   As the results trickled in, a balloon-festooned room began to
fill up with Forbes supporters wearing the orange T-shirts and blue
baseball caps that the campaign had distributed over the last few
months. Close to 9 p.m., as they heard that the candidate was about
to arrive, many carried little platters bulging with food and
plastic cups of beer and soda from an ample buffet.
</P>
<P>
   Two large television screens beamed the election results down to
the crowd. ``We believe in Steve! We believe in Steve!'' the crowd
chanted as it heard of Forbes' impending arrival.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ecstatic,'' said Keith Appell, a spokesman for the
Forbes organization. ``This has shattered our expectations. Steve
Forbes proved that he's the conservative who can go all the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as voters were going to the caucuses, the Forbes campaign
was broadcasting its television commercials _ a sign of the lavish
spending and attention to detail that has characterized the Forbes
campaign in Iowa. Over the last year, Forbes dipped into his
personal fortune of more than $440 million to spend $25 million of
his own money. That came on top of the $37 million he spent on his
1996 bid.
</P>
<P>
   In the August straw poll, Forbes gained 21 percent of the vote.
He was hoping to get at least that on Monday. But it was unclear,
given the fact that three other candidates were fighting for the
conservative vote, how much beyond that he could get.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Blackwell, Forbes' national chairman, worked the crowd and
crowed: ``We're delighted with this showing. Our goal was to get
over 23 percent. To have 31 to 32 percent is a tremendous
statement. You add up the conservative vote and it's a clear
statement that Bush is out of step with the conservative wing of
the party and, as he is going into New Hampshire, that is not a
nice place to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' staff attributed his strong showing to his highly
organized and well-financed campaign and his ability to unite
social and economic conservatives behind him.
</P>
<P>
   They said that his showing here made him the only viable
candidate among the four conservatives in the upcoming New
Hampshire primary, where the moderate Republican vote will be
divided between Bush and McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we go into New Hampshire, we won't have the same challenge
as in Iowa,'' said Greg Mueller, the Forbes campaign communications
director. ``In New Hampshire, with our strong No. 2 showing here,
we will be unopposed by any other conservative. We will have a
broad-based neo-Reagan message.''
</P>
<P>
   To shore up his support among conservatives, Forbes continued to
hit hard at the abortion theme in the final days of the campaign,
bringing in Phyllis Schlafly and Rep. Bob Barr of Georgia, both
conservative anti-abortion leaders. He also flooded the airwaves
and filled mailboxes in an anti-abortion advertising blitz.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he kept up his signature anti-tax theme, an attack
that continued to get rousing applause as he crissed-crossed the
state in a two-bus caravan and, later, in a chartered DC-9.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes consistently proposed far more drastic tax cuts than
either Bush or McCain, whom Forbes repeatedly termed the ``timid
twins on taxation'' in his stump speech.
</P>
<P>
   But as persuasive as Forbes' message may have been, his
formidable organization and his seemingly endless campaigning here
were at least as important.
</P>
<P>
   He spent 77 days here, more than any other candidate, Democrat
or Republican. And, dipping into his personal fortune of more than
$440 million, he spent $31 million in 1999 seeking the presidency _
$25 million of his own money and $6 million in donations.
</P>
<P>
   That money helped pay for a grass-roots effort in which no
detail was spared. More than 90,000 Iowa families were identified
as ``Forbes-friendly.'' A formidable databank was created that
tapped into a whole new constituency for Forbes _ conservatives who
had never before participated in a caucus. The Forbes campaign
estimated that between 30 percent and 50 percent of the eligible
voters at Forbes rallies had never voted in caucuses before.
</P>
<P>
   The organization was so sophisticated and high-tech that by the
time people signed cards identifying themselves as Forbes
supporters, that information was put into a computer and the people
were contacted by day's end. On caucus night, Forbes supporters
with e-mail were sent personalized directions to their caucus site
by computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were able to find voters that the pollsters couldn't find
because they were motivated and nontraditional conservatives who
had never really been active before,'' said Steve Grubbs, Forbes'
Iowa campaign chairman. ``And that became a really energized
base.''
</P>
<P>
   The main challenge facing Forbes in Iowa, and one he will not
face in New Hampshire, was that he was forced to fight with three
other candidates _ Gary Bauer, Alan Keyes and Orrin Hatch _ for
conservative voters, while Bush _ once such candidates as Elizabeth
Dole and Dan Quayle dropped out of the race _ had the entire
moderate field to himself.
</P>
<P>
   To counter this, Forbes outcampaigned and outspent his
conservative rivals, while continuing to take positions that moved
him further and further to the right.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, where there are fewer social conservatives,
more economic conservatives and a greater propensity for contrarian
views, the Forbes strategy may shift somewhat, campaign officials
said..
</P>
<P>
   Forbes will present himself as the only conservative choice and
will make special efforts to focus on other groups, like gun
owners, while hitting hard on the tax issue. Already, one of that
state's leading anti-tax groups, the Granite State Taxpayers, has
endorsed Forbes and is working on his behalf. In addition, Forbes'
endorsement by the state's leading newspaper, The Manchester
Union-Leader, which has a conservative philosophy, is also seen as
a boost.

   &UR; (EDITOR'S BACKGROUNDER: ``Independent'' correspondent Robert
Fisk has long denounced the use of depleted uranium (DU) shells in
both the Gulf War and NATO's conflict in Kosovo last year. After
repeatedly citing evidence of an alarming increase in cancer cases

apart by DU in the last days of the war?

   LONDON _ A team of scientists from Britain's Royal Society is to
carry out an independent investigation into the dangers of depleted
uranium (DU), amid growing evidence that use of the material in
shells and missiles is a cause of Gulf War Syndrome and has led to
an increase in cancers among those in close contact with the
weapons.

   The move will fuel accusations by veterans and human-rights
groups that inquiries so far undertaken by Britain's Ministry of
Defense (MoD) have been little short of a whitewash.

   The weapons were first used by British and American troops
during the Gulf War, and they have been the subject of controversy
ever since.

THOMAS MOVED TO MIAMI, HAS FEELING IN TOES 
</HEADLINE>
 -KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 BY KENT PULLIAM  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chiefs linebacker Derrick Thomas, who suffered serious spinal
cord injuries in an auto accident Sunday afternoon, was transferred
to Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas arrived at the hospital about 6:30 p.m. Eastern time
Monday night and underwent examination at the hospital's trauma
center. To stabilize the fractures, he had surgery late Monday
night that was expected to last into early morning.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Thomas had reported feeling sensations in
his toes, according to a source close to the family. Thomas
suffered a fractured neck and fractured back in the accident that
occurred on the icy roads in Kansas City on Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Many friends and members of the Chiefs family _ players and
staff _ visited Thomas before he left Liberty Hospital. As they
struggled to deal with the tragedy that may leave Thomas paralyzed,
he seemed to be upbeat and ready to attack this crisis with the
same ferocity he displayed while chasing quarterbacks during his
11-year NFL career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Derrick is...Derrick,'' Chiefs President Carl Peterson said
after talking with Thomas on Monday morning. ``He is positive. He
is awake and knows what is going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Chiefs coach Gunther Cunningham said Thomas' spirits ``were
tremendous. He had a smile on his face _ as he always does.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas made the decision to be transferred to Jackson Memorial
Hospital after he consulted with doctors, Chiefs personnel and his
family. Thomas grew up in the Miami area, and his mother still
lives there. Jackson Memorial Hospital is affiliated with the
University of Miami School of Medicine, which operates the Miami
Project to Cure Paralysis. It is the nation's largest spinal-cord
research center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the best place for his continued medical care and
rehabilitation will be in Miami,'' Peterson said. ``His family is
there. His mother is there. We think it is the most appropriate
thing to do at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Jon Browne, the Chiefs' team doctor, said Thomas suffered
fractures in his spinal column at the C-5 and T-5 locations. Browne
said Thomas had good use of his upper extremities and upper chest
area. But he does have some ``neurological impairment, which is
continuing to evolve.''
</P>
<P>
   Browne, Peterson and Joe Waeckerle, another Chiefs doctor who
specializes in trauma, accompanied Thomas on the air-ambulance jet.
Thomas' family members returned to Miami on commercial flights
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback James Hasty and former Chiefs defensive end Neil
Smith, Thomas' running mate for much of his career, also were
traveling to Miami to be with Thomas on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Browne would not speculate on any prognosis for Thomas'
recovery, saying it was too early to tell.
</P>
<P>
   It appears certain that his football career is finished, but
Peterson refused to accept any questions regarding the Chiefs
without Derrick Thomas. Thomas was the first player drafted by
Peterson when he arrived here in 1989. Thomas is the player most
identified with the team's resurgence in the 1990s, when the club
won more than 100 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, we are not going to address that,'' Peterson
said. ``So little time has transpired.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas suffered the fractures when he was ejected from his car
near I-435 and Woodland Avenue in Kansas City, North, about 1:30
p.m. Sunday. He was taken for treatment to Liberty Hospital, where
he was placed on a strict protocol designed to minimize the
swelling and pressure on his spinal cord. According to sources
close to the family, he had no feeling in his legs at the scene of
the accident or later Sunday _ though he did tell friends that he
had feeling in his feet Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Browne said: ``We are not going to get into any specifics about
what he does and doesn't have,'' referring to Thomas' inability to
move his legs.
</P>
<P>
   Browne said this type of injury has no clear timeline for
progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people are aware of other patients, family members and
loved ones who have had these types of injuries,'' Browne said.
``Typically, the cases that have injuries like this are very
difficult to predict. You might move along at a snail's pace and
all of a sudden make a jump (big improvement) or vice versa. It's
important to take each day at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Palermo, the former baseball umpire who suffered a spinal
cord injury, visited with Thomas before he left for Miami. Palermo
is a member of the board of directors of Thomas' charitable
foundation Third and Long. But he also has first-hand experience in
what Thomas faces over the next several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I had to tell him very much,'' said Palermo, who
was told he would never walk again but now walks with the aid of a
cane. ``He has met a lot of challenges in his life. This is a very
good and stern test. But he's of the spirit that he is up to the
test.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do not rule anything in. Do not rule anything out.''
</P>
<P>
   Peterson said Thomas told him to thank all the people who have
tried to make contact with him since the injury. ``He is sincerely
grateful for that,'' Peterson said.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson also acknowledged the tragic accident on I-29 that
affected many other families in the Kansas City area.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people here at Liberty Hospital have been magnificent,''
Peterson said. ``Yesterday was a very strenuous day for doctors
throughout North Kansas City. Yet they have been special with
Derrick.''  &LR; tag1:To reach Kent Pulliam, reporter for The Star, call

STILL DEVOTED TO THE DUKE OF DECEPTION

<P>
   enough to get John McCain elected to Congress in 1982, and he
knew it. To make it in Arizona politics, McCain needed the support
of ``The Arizona Republic,'' and for that, he needed Darrow
``Duke'' Tully, the publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Tully came to Phoenix in 1978 and, within a few years, was the
most powerful man in the state, using his position to promote
causes and protect _ or punish _ politicians. He was a big,
blustery figure who strode into a room like a referee measuring off
a penalty. He and McCain hit it off from the start.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was the well-known former POW. Tully had stories to tell
of combat service in Korea and Vietnam. They were such close
friends that when McCain's daughter, Megan, was born, he asked
Tully to be her godfather.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in late 1985, at the height of his power, Tully was
exposed as an imposter. County Attorney Tom Collins, whom Tully had
vilified in print, discovered that Tully's military career was a
fabrication. The uniforms and medals he wore to formal affairs had
been purchased at military supply outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Tully ``does not deserve his position as a community leader,''
Collins said, and just about everyone in town agreed. Tully
resigned as publisher and disappeared from public view, eventually
taking a job at the ``Williston Daily Herald'' in North Dakota.
Since then, Tully hasn't talked publicly about McCain.
</P>
<P>
   He's retired, now, and living in Florida. I reached him there
Monday, and asked how he felt about his once dear friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't want to get into interviewing about this
thing,'' Tully said. ``Everybody calls me, from the ``Washington
Post'' on down. That's old business. A long time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   He did speak recently to a writer from ``Editor &AMP; Publisher''
magazine, Tully said, but that was because ``he called in an old
card, so I paid off.''
</P>
<P>
   But are you still friends with the senator?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have maintained contact,'' Tully said. ``I pulled away from
being real active with John because I felt like our association in
the long run could prove to be embarrassing to him, and I wouldn't
have embarrassed him for anything in this world.''
</P>
<P>
   Why not?
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was one single thing I would say about John and my
relationship,'' Tully said, ``it's that his loyalty and friendship
to me has always been there, and I always knew it.''
</P>
<P>
   We're told as children you can judge a man by the friends he
chooses. But that's only part of it. You can tell a lot more by the
way he treats a friend who has let him down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the person who pulled away,'' Tully said of McCain. ``I
didn't want to be a deterrent to his political future. Now, there
still is a relationship, obviously. I'm still godfather to Megan.
We still exchange birthday greetings, Christmas cards, presents,
those sorts of things. I never took that lightly. That was very,
very important to me.''
</P>
<P>
   And it still is.
</P>
<P>
   During the worst days, just after he was exposed, Tully
remembers McCain telling him, ``This too shall pass.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked him where that came from,'' Tully said, ``and he said
he used to think it in the prison camp. I believe his sense of
those type of things runs deeper than most.''
</P>
<P>
   During a long presidential campaign, a candidate is reduced to a
business suit with sound bites. McCain is no different. The more he
talks, the less we know about him.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily there are some issues, like friendship, like loyalty,
for which years of silence tell you all you need to know. &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: ANONYMITY TO SPOTLIGHT FOR NEW BOSS

<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ Who knew Bill Parcells had such colorful
assistants? Come to think of it, who knew Parcells had assistants?
</P>
<P>
   For three years here at Weeb Ewbank Hall (not yet renamed
Parcells' Place), it was the great, giant Tuna and his minnowlike
minions, in all matters except size of the workload. While Parcells
got the attention and credit for building a dynasty that won one
playoff game, Bill Belichick locked himself in a room with his best
friend, the videocassette recorder.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the Jets' staff was muted and invisible, under
Parcells' meaty thumb. Upon his retirement from coaching, they all
emerged and the Jets immediately turned into a soap opera of
X-and-O guys. All My Assistants.
</P>
<P>
   For Parcells _ who typically embraced the maxim that there is no
``I'' in ``team,'' only in ``Bill'' _ the strange turn of events
that has beclouded the Jets can best be described as wickedly
ironic, and better make that with a capital ``I.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want this to be categorized as rambling,'' Al Groh
said, as he embarked on a final point Monday during the news
conference at which the incoming owner Robert Wood Johnson IV
officially appointed him head coach.
</P>
<P>
   This wry and promising humor, at the expense of Belichick,
simply delighted his audience and further demonstrated that the
former linebackers coach is perfectly comfortable with his unlikely
casting for the Al Groh Show. Again: Who knew these last three
years while Parcells was performing his ongoing monologue that
there were so many other voices crying to be heard?
</P>
<P>
   When Belichick was finally allowed to speak, he unleashed at
least 10,000 words between ``good'' and ``bye.'' When the offensive
coordinator Charlie Weis was called to testify at last week's
league hearing on the Belichick contract matter, this Charlie
wasn't afraid to say, sorry Tuna, Little Bill should be let off the
hook.
</P>
<P>
   And when the defensive line coach Romeo Crennel had a choice of
similar positions for the Jets and the Cleveland Browns, Romeo fell
in love with the idea of working for a team whose heart wouldn't
always belong to Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   Freedom of expression _ it's amazing the things people will say
and do when they have it.
</P>
<P>
   Before Monday, who knew that the man in charge of the blitz was
the type to tell urination jokes? We don't know if Groh will leave
'em laughing or crying as head coach, but here's what we do know:
You've got to start somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells was once an unheralded assistant. So were Pat Riley and
Phil Jackson. So was Jeff Fisher, of those Super Bowl Titans, and
Jeff Van Gundy and _ in a variation on the theme _ there was a
journeyman manager named Torre whose appointment here was
practically met with the lowering of 22 World Series flags to
half-staff.
</P>
<P>
   Promoting a career assistant is risky, but it usually helps when
the guy has a profile, a persona, if only for the sake of
mollifying the news media and fans, and easing the doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's organized, he's focused and he knows what he wants,''
said Joe Thomas, who was Groh's high school coach at Chaminade High
School. ``Al isn't trying to please anybody. He's a coach from down
deep, in here.''
</P>
<P>
   The proud 84-year-old, no doubting Thomas, gently patted his
heart.
</P>
<P>
   Every man has a mentor, a family, a story. For three years with
the Jets, Groh has been nothing more than a yearbook photo and bio,
thanks to Parcells' ridiculous policy of gagging his assistants.
Can you imagine Joe Torre ordering Mel Stottlemyre into the shadows
of the Yankee clubhouse?
</P>
<P>
   With his assistants divulging state secrets, Parcells somehow
won two Super Bowls. In New England, which was about the time he
became a certified genius, Parcells became the puppeteer. These are
grown men, with pride and self-respect. Maybe it was unavoidable
that it was going to end so divisively for this Jets' staff.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that Parcells did a wonderful job bringing
credibility and hope to the Jets. The fact also is that rebuilding
overnight is not the miracle (see Indianapolis and St. Louis) it
once was in a league of unrestricted free agency and salary caps.
Groh deserves a chance without having Parcells, who did not finish
the job, thrown in his face every week.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Bill has often said, you are what you are, and we were
8-8,'' said Groh. ``We have work to do.''
</P>
<P>
   He has a legend to elude and new hires to make. He said he has
not addressed the issue of the assistant coaches' news media
policy. Let 'em speak. Let 'em ramble, if that's what keeps them
happy.
</P>

NEWS ANALYSIS: IOWA, AND ABORTION, AS EARLY DEFINERS
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ In the long run, the most important
consequence of the Iowa Presidential caucuses this year may be the
impression they leave of Gov. George W. Bush on voters across the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   His entire candidacy has been predicated on the determination of
many Republicans, chafing after eight years of Democratic control
of the White House, to put party unity and solidarity ahead of
ideology. That determination gave him fund-raising success and
leadership backing.
</P>
<P>
   The governor will of course have many chances between now and
November to modify his image and fine-tune his position on the
issues. But first impressions count, as countless mothers have told
countless children, so the Bush camp must hope their man will not
be further hammered by his Republican rivals on abortion and other
divisive issues in the weeks to come.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter-century ago, when Jimmy Carter first put the Iowa
caucuses on the national political map by winning the state's 1976
presidential caucuses, the only thing that really mattered was who
won.
</P>
<P>
   Today the nation sees not only the Iowa results but the campaign
that produces them. Journalists have swarmed across the state since
last August, when the Republican straw poll took place, pumping out
data. The candidates in both parties have debated each other on
national television.
</P>
<P>
   This time, significantly, the nation knows that Bush had to
speak more about abortion during the Iowa campaign, and more
specifically, than he had hoped. That could have a big impact not
only on the primaries to follow, but more importantly, on the
general election this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Many Iowans knew what Carter had said and done during the months
that preceded his victory _ the long, grinding months of talking to
individual voters and to tiny crowds here in the Farm Belt _ but
most of the rest of the country did not. Only a few national
reporters had bothered to come here. The broadcast networks were
largely absent. And, of course, things like CNN, MSNBC and
political Web sites had not even been invented.
</P>
<P>
   Carter was free to define himself in the later stages of the
campaign, and to keep his party reasonably united behind him.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republican politicians, and certainly most of those around
Bush, take it as given that the abortion issue has the capacity to
split their party and scare away independents. But Bush's main Iowa
rivals, Steve Forbes, Alan Keyes and Gary Bauer, saw it as the one
issue that could set them apart from the front-runner, and honed in
on it in the final weeks.
</P>
<P>
   All three identified themselves strongly with the religious
right, which is more powerful in Iowa than in most states, and
among them they polled roughly half of the vote. That may well
encourage them _ and especially Forbes, who has spent millions but
has millions more to spend _ to hammer away at abortion in New
Hampshire, which votes a week from Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   One question is whether Forbes, who has so far avoided the kind
of personal attacks he engaged in four years ago, will change
course in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a uniter, not a divider,'' Bush said before leaving for
New Hampshire, as if to send a message that he would not been drawn
into a slugging match with his party rivals. ``The people of Iowa
want a leader who can unite our party and our country, and they
showed that today.''
</P>
<P>
   The main threat to Bush in New Hampshire, Sen. John McCain of
Arizona, did not campaign in Iowa and drew few votes here.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night's Republican results had something for almost
everyone. Bush won, and won reasonably convincingly. Forbes did
much better than the polls had suggested he would, and much better
than he did four years ago. Keyes broke into double digits. But it
is hard to imagine that Iowa decided very much; it has decided very
little since 1976.
</P>
<P>
   This state's winners often turn into losers later, either in
subsequent primaries or in the general election. The last candidate
in either party to win a contested Iowa caucus and go on to victory
in November was Carter in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa's latter-day role of winnowing the field, of getting it
down to manageable proportions, happened this year before a single
caucus vote had been cast. Four years ago, for instance, Sen. Phil
Gramm of Texas was knocked out of the Republican race by the voting
itself. This time, Lamar Alexander and Dan Quayle failed to survive
the straw poll, and Elizabeth Dole was so weakened that she dropped
out not much later.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey
came out of the caucuses without much to show for a massive
television campaign and intensive personal efforts during the last
two weeks. Among Democrats, support from trade unions and party
officials has always counted for a great deal, and it apparently
did again this year, with Vice President Al Gore benefitting from
the links he forged here with White House help.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his best efforts, on subjects ranging from farm policy
to health insurance, to suggest that he differed markedly from
Gore, Bradley was unable to make that case with enough caucus-goers
to count. Initial figures suggested that the attendance at the
Democratic meetings had been relatively low, whereas the New
Jerseyan had hoped to attract large numbers of people who had not
previously taken part in caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley will go on to New Hampshire, where polls have shown him
running neck-and-neck with Gore, without the kind of boost he had
hoped for. It is Gore, if anyone, who will get the bounce from
Iowa.

 &HT;    Bradley campaign glad to be heading to New Hampshire
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ Several hundred supporters of Bill Bradley
crowded into a ballroom in a downtown Des Moines hotel Monday to
watch the caucus returns. Despite the fact that Bradley was losing
to Vice President Al Gore, his supporters remained upbeat about
their candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got the fire in the belly,'' said Marcia Moore, a Des
Moines voter who caucused for Bradley and was elected one of his
precinct delegates.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on ABC, Bradley displayed some of that fire as
the results were still being counted.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is now in the stage where the citizen is deciding. This
thing is moving up,'' he said. ``We told the people what we
believed. We got new people in the process. I think this could be a
longer evening than people imagine.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said, ``We are doing well. The bar was 31 percent.''
That's the figure Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) achieved in his
insurgent campaign in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Berman, Bradley's campaign chair, said the campaign was
relieved to be heading toward New Hampshire for a ``fresh start. We
are turning the page on Iowa, starting tonight,'' he said. ``Our
challenge is now in New Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire clearly had been on Bill Bradley's mind throughout
the day.
</P>
<P>
   At a small rally at Iowa State College in Ames, Bradley focused
on some of the the newer themes that he will stress inthe Granite
State, where the latest polls show him losing his edge to Vice
President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politics, to too many Americans and too many young people, has
become nothing other than tactics,'' Bradley said. ``It's become
tactics and not belief. It's become spin and not truth. It's become
fund-raising and not reaching out to people where they live their
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign announced a new 30-second television ad that will
begin airing in New Hampshire today, echoing similar messages.
</P>
<P>
   The ad features the widow of Sen. Paul Tsongas (D-Mass.), who
won the New Hampshire primary in 1992. ``What disappoints me now is
_ just as with Paul _ Bill's record is being distorted,'' Niki
Tsongas says in the commercial.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the rally at Ames, Bradley spent the rest of the
day appearing on local television and radio.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said he had the bankroll to fight on for the nomination
in next week's New Hampshire primary and in the cluster of state
primaries on March 7, which he called the first ``national
primary.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas was a clear
victor Monday night in the Republican caucuses here, but his two
closest competitors, Steve Forbes and Alan Keyes, who both appealed
to religious conservatives, drew strong support.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, Vice President Al Gore defeated former
Sen. Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, a two-term Texas governor in his first try for national
office, surpassed the 37 percent record that Bob Dole drew in a
six-candidate field in Iowa in 1988, a number that Bush had said
was his goal.
</P>
<P>
   Declaring victory based on early tallies barely an hour after
the caucuses began across the state, Bush said in a television
interview, ``I am thrilled with this record-shattering victory. I
am grateful and I'm humbled.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``My message of compassionate conservatism resonated
loud. The people of Iowa want a leader who can unite our party and
our country _ and that's exactly the signal they have sent.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, the wealthy magazine publisher who had pumped millions
from his family fortune into the race here, finished a strong
second place, roughly tripling the 10 percent he drew here four
years ago. Alan Keyes, a former State Department official, ranked a
distant third, outpacing Gary Bauer, the prominent religious
conservative, Sen. John McCain of Arizona and Sen. Orrin G. Hatch
of Utah.
</P>
<P>
   McCain did not compete here, preferring to concentrate his
campaign in New Hampshire, where the nation's first primary will be
held Feb. 1. McCain is neck and neck with Bush in the polls there.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year, Bush has towered over the Republican field
because of his record-breaking fund-raising, impressive poll
numbers and vast endorsements. Monday night, for the first time,
actual voters affirmed his position as front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   While Forbes had long been viewed as Bush's toughest competitor
here, Keyes' showing was particularly striking because he has run a
low-budget campaign and many Republican had dismissed him as more a
protest candidate than a serious vote-getter. But he drew
particular attention for his stand-out role in many of the
Republican debates.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent victory for Gore was important for the vice
president because he and Bradley were locked in an aggressive,
competitive race here.
</P>
<P>
   Though Iowa has been at the epicenter of American politics, the
results are far from a reliable indicator of who will end up at the
White House _ or even win the first primary in New Hampshire next
week.
</P>
<P>
   The last candidate to win a contested caucus and be elected
president was Jimmy Carter in 1976. In 1988, the eventual nominees,
Michael S. Dukakis and George Bush, placed third in the caucuses.
The two victors, Dick Gephardt and Bob Dole, had quit the race by
the end of March.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, there was no contested Democratic race. Dole won
the Republican caucuses, but he was followed closely by Pat
Buchanan, who then triumphed in New Hampshire but lost the
nomination to Dole. In recent years, the voting here has been more
important for narrowing the field.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Many other states have derided Iowa for all the attention that
it draws from the contenders, and from the press, because the state
is overwhelmingly white and not particularly representative of the
nation. Of the 1.8 million registered voters in Iowa, no more than
200,000 had been expected to participate Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, those who participate are not especially
representative even of Iowa. They are among the more politically
active residents and they tend to be the more conservative or
liberal members of their party. To a large measure, the outcome
reflects the organizational prowess of candidates and interest
groups in prodding people to give up a Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
   But the caucuses have become high profile events because the
national press covers them heavily, which in turn prompts the
candidates to spend more time here.
</P>
<P>
   The caucuses started at 7 p.m., when residents went to schools,
church basements, meeting halls and private homes across the state.
The voting marked only the beginning of a months-long process of
selecting delegates to the Republican and Democratic conventions,
where the nominees would actually be chosen. The Republican vote
was merely a straw poll and would have little impact on the
selection of actual delegates to the convention, who will be chosen
at county conventions, congressional district conventions and state
conventions.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For the Democrats, the voting Monday night will have more
influence on the selection of actual delegates. Iowa would
eventually account for 56 of the party's 4,337 convention
delegates. The state will send 25 of the 2,169 delegates to the
Republican convention.
</P>
<P>
   For months _ years in some cases _ Iowa has served as a second
home for many candidates. They poured millions of dollars into
television commercials, and they campaigned from hog farms to high
schools, making their pitches to a relatively tiny number of
voters. Even before the intense campaigning of the past month,
Forbes had ben here 69 days; Bradley, 62 days; Bauer, 54 days;
Keyes, 51 days; Gore, 35 days; and Bush, 19 days. This was the
first time since 1988 that both parties had competitive contests.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Before Iowans voted, the contenders devoted one last day to
trying to persuade and cajole the undecided and the uncommitted.
Bush got an early start, striding into a restaurant here at 7:45
Monday morning and competing with eggs and pastries for the
attention of the scattered diners.
</P>
<P>
   ``No rest for a while,'' he told a diner. ``It's like running a
marathon. I ran a marathon in 1993, and it just requires patience
and discipline and focus, and this is mile six.''
</P>
<P>
   At a subsequent stop in Ames, where he delivered a speech at
Iowa State University, Bush was upbeat and folksy, offering a
homespun riff on how hard it has been to spend so many days on the
campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss the cats,'' he said. ``They don't miss me. I miss the
dog. She does miss me.'' But his playfulness had its limits. When
the documentary filmmaker, Michael Moore _ who has been traveling
through Iowa with a ``mosh pit'' in which people roll around _
asked Bush to participate, the governor said, ``Behave yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes spent his last day pretty much as always _ with a heavy
dose of radio interviews on conservative programs. By 3 p.m., he
had appeared on 20 radio programs and 14 television programs.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters as he campaigned with two of his five
daughters, Forbes asserted that he was the leading conservative in
the field.
</P>
<P>
   Gore on Monday played down reports that he used marijuana more
extensively in his mid-20s than he has admitted. Asked whether he
had smoked marijuana almost daily in the early 1970s, Gore told the
NBC affiliate here, KWQC, ``No, when I came back from Vietnam, yes,
but not to that extent. This is something I dealt with a longtime
ago _ it's old news.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president, who is 51, added: ``When I was young, I did
things young people do. When I grew up, I put away childish
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley held his only public event at Iowa State University,
where he told several hundred students and faculty members that
politics in America had lost touch with the needs of ``real''
people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Politics to too many young people, to too many Americans, has
become nothing other than tactics,'' Bradley said. ``It's become
tactics and not belief. It's become spin and not truth. It's become
fund-raising and not reaching out to people where they live their
lives. It has become all of the things that are artificial in our
country.''

 &HT;    As expected, Bush, Gore score in Iowa caucuses

<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ George W. Bush and Al Gore drew first blood
in the young presidential campaign Monday night with convincing
victories in the Iowa caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   Both results were highly expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thrilled with this victory,'' Bush said on national
television. ``I'm grateful, and I'm humbled.''
</P>
<P>
   With his victory just minutes old Monday night, Gore was already
looking ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't wait to get to New Hampshire,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Gore won about 63 percent of the delegates, handily
beating former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley. The well-funded Bush
campaign captured 40 percent of the vote, beating Republican
publisher Steve Forbes, who has poured millions of his own money
into his second bid for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Gore are expected to face tougher challenges one week
from today in the New Hampshire primary, where Arizona Sen. John
McCain leads Bush in some polls and Bradley has tied Gore in other
surveys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight isn't the end,'' Bradley said. ``It's just the
beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Iowa launched the presidential race into a frantic six-week
stretch expected to narrow the field considerably, perhaps down to
each party's nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes mounted a vigorous campaign in Iowa, calling on
fundamentalist and conservative support and trying to position
himself as the strongest alternative to the more moderate Bush.
That strategy seemed to work in the crowded six-man field as Forbes
received 30 percent of the votes.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, he was clearly satisfied with his strong
second-place showing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your faith has been vindicated tonight,'' Forbes told cheering
supporters in Des Moines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We vastly overperformed the polls and have emerged as a
conservative candidate,'' said Forbes, who had indicated earlier in
the day he would ``feel good about a good, strong second.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Keyes, in third with 14 percent, said he also felt good
about the results. He based his finish ahead of Gary Bauer and Sen.
Orrin Hatch on his firm stance on moral issues _ most notably his
strong opposition to abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Fifth-place finisher McCain basically skipped the Iowa caucuses,
putting most of his efforts and money into the New Hampshire race.
Forbes' strong finish in Iowa actually could help McCain in New
Hampshire because some undecided voters could feel that Bush is
vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can really do this,'' McCain assured his supporters in New
Hampshire on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   He also dismissed the importance of the Iowa vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``People of New Hampshire don't pay a great deal of attention to
what happens in Iowa,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch finished last with 1 percent but said he will soldier on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get discouraged,'' he said. ``If you get discouraged
in this business, you don't get a lot done.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, Bradley suffered his first defeat in 22
years of politics, hurt in large part by failing to respond
aggressively to Gore's TV and radio ads. That's not a mistake he
will repeat in New Hampshire, Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also indicated Gore is in for a long battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The longer the competition goes, the better chance that
candidate is going to have ... in the fall,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The competition apparently motivated many Democrats, with
officials reporting record turnouts at many of the state's 2,100
precincts.
</P>
<P>
   Bush expressed confidence, particularly since his showing in
Iowa was the best-ever in a contested GOP field.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Dole set the previous record at 37 percent in 1988 when he
won Iowa but eventually lost the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel tremendous,'' Bush said. ``We've put a lot of work into
it. My message of compassionate conservatism is a message that this
state heard. I look forward to bringing it to other states. Ours is
a message that resonates beyond Iowa to New Hampshire and South
Carolina and all across our country.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to cheering supporters in a Des Moines hotel ballroom,
Bush declined to portray the results as anything
</P>
<P>
   but a major victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seven months ago I came to Iowa on a plane dubbed 'Great
Expectations,''' he said. ``Tonight, Iowa has exceeded them.''
</P>
<P>
   University of Iowa political scientist Arthur Miller said the
caucus results were positive for several contenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's pretty impressive that Forbes was able to do as
well as he has,'' said Miller. ``But the governor goes out of the
state with a victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller noted that the vote total for Forbes and Keyes would wind
up about the same as Bush's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those people on the right definitely turned out and they voted
the conservative line,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Iowa campaign was one of the most expensive in history.
Forbes spent far more than anyone _ about $3.2 million, according
to aides from the Forbes and Bush campaigns. Bush spent about $1
million less.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats spent about $1.5 million each _ closer to $2
million for Bradley, according to the Gore camp.
</P>
<P>
   The parties conducted their caucuses in slightly different ways.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats elect county convention delegates reflecting their
presidential preferences, discuss platform issues and elect
precinct leaders. Republicans elect precinct leaders, hold a straw
poll for president, elect delegates to the county conventions and
consider platform issues.
</P>
<P>
   After Iowa and New Hampshire, Democrats turn their attention to
an avalanche of primaries from New York to California on March 7.
Republicans will compete in several states before March 7,
including Delaware on Feb. 8, South Carolina on Feb. 19 and Arizona
and Michigan on Feb. 22.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of the number of delegates selected, Iowa's impact is
relatively small.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa will eventually send 25 delegates to the Republican
convention in Philadelphia, where 2,066 representatives will pick
the party's candidates in August.
</P>
<P>
   And 56 Iowans will go to Los Angeles for the Democratic
convention, out of 4,337 total delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Goldford, chairman of the politics and international
relations department at Drake University in Des Moines, says the
caucuses mostly serve to narrow the field of contenders.
</P>
<P>
   By this morning, when the candidates wake up in New Hampshire,
this first election of the season will probably have done just
that.

VICTORIOUS BUSH SETS SIGHTS ON NEW HAMPSHIRE 

</HEADLINE>

By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush hardly savored his
victory in the Iowa Republican presidential caucuses Monday before
flying to New Hampshire to see if he can break the lead rival Sen.
John McCain has grabbed in the Granite State.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Hampshire, I don't plan on losing it,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush got more bad news from New England on Monday as a
CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll reported that McCain is leading Bush 43
percent to 34 percent among likely New Hampshire Republican primary
voters. That poll was conducted Jan. 20-22, after almost a full
week of Bush attacking McCain's tax cut proposal in local
television advertising
</P>
<P>
   Despite the polls, McCain still sees himself as ``the underdog
... in a close race. I take nothing for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain did not campaign for Iowa caucus votes and received only
5 percent. But as Bush campaigned in Iowa, New Hampshire was never
far from his sights. He took daily shots at McCain, who has turned
the New Hampshire primary into a higher hurdle for Bush than the
GOP front-runner expected.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has defined the race on his $483 billion tax-cut plan
against McCain's $240 billion plan. Bush has contended that McCain
has revised his plan repeatedly, and that the plan would pay for
tax cuts with some tax increases. McCain has responded that Bush is
misleading voters and breaking his promise against negative
campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign also plans this week to draw critical
differences between Bush and McCain on education. Bush spokesman
Karen Hughes said Bush has an education record as governor of Texas
and has laid out a federal plan in the presidential race. She said
McCain has yet to make his position on education clear.
</P>
<P>
   Besides McCain, Bush faces a potential threat from Steve Forbes,
who ran second in Iowa. He has concentrated on scoring well in
Iowa, but also obtained the editorial endorsement of New
Hampshire's influential Manchester Union Leader.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush consultant Karl Rove noted that since November the Bush
New Hampshire volunteers have delivered more than 200,000 pieces of
literature to state voters, while Forbes has done little outside of
Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is his (Forbes') high-water mark. New Hampshire might be
the same for John McCain,'' Rove said.
</P>
<P>
   While not conceding New Hampshire to McCain, Rove said Bush
eventually will win the GOP presidential nomination because of his
national organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a rough spot in the road. But as the
front-runner, we have the organization and the national standing to
continue the campaign everywhere and win,'' Rove said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has been losing the battle of newspaper editorials in New
Hampshire. McCain has the backing of 15 state newspapers and Bush,
three.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think it says a lot about the campaign Bush has run
here,'' said Mike Pride, editor of the Concord Monitor, which threw
its support to McCain after Bush failed to meet with the editorial
board. ``New Hampshire is a place where you are supposed to make
yourself available to voters. Bush hasn't done that. He's been
quite sheltered.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire has not always been friendly to the Bush family in
presidential races.
</P>
<P>
   While New Hampshire voters came through for Bush's father,
former President Bush, when he won the GOP nomination in 1988, the
weakness of his 1992 re-election campaign was exposed when Patrick
Buchanan got 37 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1980, after winning the Iowa caucuses, Bush declared he
had the ``Big Mo,'' or momentum, going into the New Hampshire
primary, but he lost to ultimate party nominee Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Mo didn't work,'' the younger Bush said last week,
downplaying the role Iowa may have in helping him defeat McCain in
New Hampshire. ``Sometimes victory does not mean victory. I hope it
does in my case.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rove said Bush can count on a bounce from his Iowa victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take a look at four years ago. The day before the Iowa caucus,
Bob Dole was at 19 percent in New Hampshire and three days later he
was at 26 percent...which is where he ended up on election day,''
Rove said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A CBS poll showed the fluidity of the 2000 New Hampshire race.
Fifty-eight percent of the New Hampshire voters said they could
still change their minds. Only 40 percent of Bush's supporters said
they were sure to vote for him, and just 44 percent of McCain's
support was solid.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Bass of New Hampshire, a Bush backer, said the
Texas governor can all but wrap up the nomination if he defeats
McCain in New Hampshire. But if Bush loses New Hampshire, ``it
means it will be a long winter.'' &QL;

IOWA CAUCUS COVERAGE PORTRAYS AN ELECTION IN A TIME WARP 
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ It was like watching an election in reverse
gear, first the results, then the voting.
</P>
<P>
   Live on C-SPAN at 8:10 p.m. ET, Monday night, some 84
participants in a Democratic caucus in Ames, Iowa, were beginning
to take their seats. At virtually the same moment, Brian Williams,
the anchor on MSNBC, was reporting, ``NBC News projects Al Gore
will be the winner and will go on to New Hampshire with his first
victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Viewers could be forgiven for wondering whether one of these
channels was on tape delay. But the reality was, it was just
another of the peculiarities of the Iowa caucus process. On most
election nights, news organizations rely on surveys of voters as
they leave the polls. Because Iowans all gather at the same
appointed time in the early evening at the 2,000 caucuses around
the state, the polling is conducted before a single vote has been
cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this case, you are asked as you are walking into your
caucus, `Who are you going to support?' '' explained John Ellis,
head of the decision desk that analyzed the so-called ``entrance
polls'' for the Fox News Channel, one of MSNBC's chief competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the caucus-goers in Ames, a university town of 50,000
about 30 miles north of here, did not actually cast their votes
until about 8:45 p.m., when, before the C-SPAN cameras, the caucus
chairman, Jim Hutter, declared, ``It's time to divide it up!'' Ten
minutes later, the supporters of each of the Democrats having
assembled, Hutter announced the results: Bradley, 37; Gore, 47.
</P>
<P>
   The contrast in the reports of the real event and the
statistical voting projections could not have been starker. The
three all-news cable channels _ Fox News Channel, MSNBC and CNN
engaged in a fierce 15-to-20-minute battle to call the races in the
first half hour of their wall-to-wall coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Fox claimed the first call of the evening, at 8 p.m., declaring
Gov. George W. Bush the winner of the Republican caucuses, but in
truth, all the cable networks led their 8 o'clock special reports
with the advisory that Bush was leading and the likely winner.
(MSNBC officially called it at 8:25 and CNN at 8:27).The
traditional broadcast networks, meanwhile, kept to their normal
programming, running the projections on a crawl from time to time
at the bottom of the screens. They also reported their calls
rapidly on their respective Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore was also projected the winner in the
first few minutes of coverage. But the results on the Democratic
drew less interest at the anchors; for days, there had been reports
that Bill Bradley's fortunes in Iowa were sinking. The polls, it
turned out, were pretty much on the money, and the news people were
hard pressed to identify the kind of Iowa surprise that has
stimulated discussion on previous caucus nights.
</P>
<P>
   The only mild surprise was a trend that many news organizations
had picked up on in the previous 24 hours, that Alan Keyes was
gaining strength. He finished third on the Republican side, behind
Steve Forbes and ahead of Gary Bauer.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Greenfield, the CNN analyst, said that the numbers
indicated that Keyes ``was able to convince a fair number'' of
former supporters of Pat Buchanan and Pat Robertson, ``to `Stay
with me,' which kind of held back Bush. ``He got a good victory but
not a blowout.''
</P>
<P>
   On CNN, Judy Woodruff declared it ``a sweet night for the Bush
family: 20 years ago, another Bush won the Republican caucuses in
Iowa.'' A few minutes later, candidate Bush was being interviewed
by Larry King, calling his win a ``tremendous victory'' in a
``crowded field.'' On MSNBC, Tim Russert predicted that John
McCain, who had bypassed Iowa and ended up in fifth, would use
Bush's victory in New Hampshire to urge voters ``to give me a
chance and keep it going beyond New Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
   Back on C-SPAN, the caucus-goers were still meeting.

GERALD MURPHY, 65, DEVELOPER OF CANCER TEST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., N.Y., Mont., Calif., Texas)  (lb) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gerald Patrick Murphy, a urologist whose research led to the PSA
test, widely used to help in the early detection of prostate
cancer, died on Friday in Tel Aviv, Israel, while attending a
conference on cancer. He was 65 and lived in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, reports from Israel said. Murphy
had undergone several heart bypass operations.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy was a longtime secretary-general of the International
Union of Cancer, the coalition of health professionals that held
the conference. He was also a former president of the American
Cancer Society.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Murphy was affiliated with a long roster of
research centers, foundations and other institutions dealing with
cancer. From 1970 to 1985 he directed the Roswell Park Memorial
Institute for cancer research and therapy in Buffalo, N.Y., and
helped build it into an internationally recognized center.
</P>
<P>
   He worked in Buffalo in the urology laboratory of the State
University of New York Medical School, leading the researchers who
established that cancer tumors of the prostate generate prostate
specific antigens, or PSAs. Antigens are substances to which the
body responds with antibodies in an effort to protect itself.
</P>
<P>
   That discovery eventually led to the development of the PSA
test; high levels of the substance can point to the presence of
prostate cancer at an early stage. The test is now widely used as a
diagnostic tool in combination with a rectal exam.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1980s, the PSA test has been used on millions of men
worldwide to help look for early prostate cancer, and it can often
show the presence of the disease before it would otherwise be
detected, permitting early treatment. But it does not distinguish
between fast-growing, life-threatening cancers and others, and like
any test it fails to detect cancer in some men who have it, while
other men receive false-positive results.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Murphy was born in Havre, Mont., and graduated summa cum
laude from Seattle University in 1955. He received an M.D. at the
University of Washington in 1959. He conducted research at Walter
Reed Army Hospital before joining the staff of Roswell Park
Memorial in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy helped lobby Congress for passage of the National Cancer
Act of 1971, which created cancer research centers across the
United States. He wrote more than 1,000 papers and was an editor of
scientific journals; he also taught at institutions in the United
States and overseas.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving Roswell Park, Murphy became the chief medical
officer of the American Cancer Society, directing its programs in
clinical education, service and patient care. He moved to Seattle
in 1993 and at his death was clinical professor of urology at the
University of Washington and research director of the Pacific
Northwest Cancer Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy is survived by his wife of 40 years, Mary Bridget
Cunningham Murphy; four daughters, Anne Marie Banner of Seattle,
Margaret Olivares of Santa Monica, Calif., Maureen Anderson of
Seattle and Bridget Neill of Washington, D.C.; two sons, George of
Issaquah, Wash., and Gerald of Austin, Texas; a sister, Lois
Spellman of Seattle, and six grandchildren.

   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Hillary Rodham Clinton on Monday compared the
fund-raising tactics of New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to those of
Sen. Jesse Helms. Giuliani, in response, dared her to try to paint
him as a right-wing extremist.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton and Giuliani, the presumed candidates for the U.S.
Senate, and their surrogates traded barbs throughout a day in which
both of them passed through the state Capitol without crossing
paths. For Mrs. Clinton it was another chance to suggest that the
mayor was too conservative for New York state.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday The New York Times reported that Giuliani's Senate
campaign had made extensive use of fund-raising mailings to
conservatives in other states. The tone of the appeals was far more
hostile toward Mrs. Clinton than were his mailings in New York
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's learned from people like Jesse Helms,'' Mrs.
Clinton said at a morning appearance in White Plains, ``that you
run some of these campaigns, these negative campaigns, out of state
so that you can go around saying you're not doing it in state and
hope that nobody will catch you. That seems to be the pattern and
it's been a pretty tried-and-true technique of the right-wing
Republicans for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about her comments here Monday evening, she said, ``I did
not compare anyone to Jesse Helms,'' the North Carolina Republican.
But then she added that Giuliani was relying on mailing lists from
``far-right organizations'' and that the two-pronged mail campaign
was ``a hallmark of what Senator Helms has done for years.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference with Gov. George Pataki, the mayor,
laughing, said, ``She said it was part of a right-wing conspiracy,
right?'' That was a reference to Mrs. Clinton's assertion in
January 1998, early in the Lewinsky investigation, that there was
``a vast right-wing conspiracy conspiring against my husband.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got a right-wing conspiracy again,'' said Giuliani, who
is generally regarded _ certainly by most Republicans _ as a
moderate. ``That's going to be an interesting one to try to sell.
Yogi Berra has an expression for that: `deja vu all over again.'
I'm a lot of things, but you're going to try to put that label on
me, give it a try. We'll see if that one doesn't backfire.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor was here for his annual remarks to the Legislature
about the state budget, while Mrs. Clinton came at the invitation
of Speaker Sheldon Silver for a private question-and-answer session
with Democratic lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's fellow Republicans, the governor and Joseph Bruno,
the Senate majority leader, accused Mrs. Clinton of trying to
upstage the mayor. ``There's no question in my mind that the fact
that the first lady chose today to come is because she doesn't want
people to hear the positive message of the successful record of
Mayor Giuliani,'' Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton noted that Silver had arranged the visit and said,
``At last count, I've been in upstate New York in the last six
months more than 30 times, and I've never run into the mayor on any
of those trips.''
</P>
<P>
   After her meeting, several Democratic legislators said they were
gravely concerned about the state of her campaign, with Mrs.
Clinton trailing in public opinion surveys and fund raising. Some
lawmakers from New York City, normally the most fertile ground for
a Democrat, said they thought the mayor would win their districts.
</P>

<P>
   Earlier in the day, at Sam's, a restaurant in White Plains, Mrs.
Clinton, a new resident of nearby Chappaqua, gave the most detailed
description o date of her environmental agenda, in a speech before
a mostly sympathetic audience of 100 people invited by groups
including the Sierra Club and the League of Conservation Voters.
</P>
<P>
   She said she would vote to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, a 1997
treaty calling for worldwide cuts in emissions of gases. President
Clinton has signed the treaty, but the Senate has refused to ratify
it. She also said she would push for legislation to curb acid rain.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani again tried to distance himself from the failings of
the New York City schools system and blamed them on ``the
bureaucratic infrastructure that is so damaging, where job
protection is put ahead of helping children.'' He repeated his
contention that he should be given control of the schools, telling
a joint Assembly-Senate committee, ``Do away with the Board of
Education.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton said: ``It's appeared to me that the mayor's had
control of the schools. He's hired and fired two chancellors.''

ON PRO FOOTBALL: RACE AND HISTORY WILL INTRUDE ON MCNAIR 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Tennessee quarterback Steve McNair may not know it
yet, he could not know it yet, but he is walking into a hurricane,
and this one does not possess a calm eye. He will be held up as a
symbol of what is right and wrong with professional football. He
will be held up as a symbol of what is good and bad about the
sports media.
</P>
<P>
   McNair should bring his helmet to those annoying early-morning
question-and-answer sessions all week leading up to Super Bowl
XXXIV on Sunday. He will have microphones shoved up his nose and
stupid questions tossed his way like bricks. It is a scene that
will occur every day. The sports media will stick to him like glue,
and not because he is handsome or tall.
</P>
<P>
   But because he is black.
</P>
<P>
   More specifically, because he is a black quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   McNair becomes only the second black player to start at
quarterback in Super Bowl history. He has a million other stories
to tell, of course. How he overcame a devastating back injury this
season. How he played in the American Football Conference
championship game with a painful turf toe injury. How he can master
an offense like a skilled captain, even though people are still
trying to pigeonhole him as nothing more than a souped-up fullback.
</P>
<P>
   He may get to discuss those things, but most of his time with
the sports media will be spent answering questions in regard to the
color of his skin. Let's hope he will not get the query Doug
Williams once received from a reporter in 1988. Williams was the
first black quarterback to start in a Super Bowl and was asked
perhaps the single dumbest question in championship history: how
long have you been a black quarterback?
</P>
<P>
   This is one of those delicate balancing acts for both the
National Football League and members of the sports media. McNair's
being here, on this stage, is a great moment, an emotional one, and
one that thousands of blacks, if not hundreds of thousands, across
the country will follow closely. This is a simple fact: McNair
could become a folk hero in the black community the same way
Williams did after Super Bowl XXII by leading Washington over
Denver by a score of 42-10. Williams was named the most valuable
player in the game, and for years afterward, he would sometimes be
stopped in the street by black fans, no matter what city he was in,
who would tell him how much his victory meant to their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Racism, for decades, kept blacks from playing quarterback, which
is why Williams, and now McNair, are such important historical
figures. Jimmy Raye, now an assistant with the Kansas City Chiefs,
was a quarterback who led Michigan State to two Big Ten titles and
a Rose Bowl appearance in 1966. But since most NFL executives,
influenced by a hearty dose of prejudice, did not think Raye and
other blacks were smart enough to play the position, he went
undrafted and was converted to cornerback by Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Moon was asked by teams to consider switching to
defensive back after leading the Washington Huskies to a 27-20
upset of the University of Michigan in the 1978 Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, of the 1,379 players in the league, only two blacks,
James Harris and Vince Evans, were on rosters as quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   So McNair walks into what will be a charged atmosphere, a
mountain of history on his shoulders. Like it or not, that is the
case, and he will be asked about it, constantly. And the questions
will come from the sports media that love to chastise the NFL for
its lack of black coaches and even quarterbacks but rarely shine
the spotlight on their own questionable hiring habits, their own
prejudiced opinions, their own private racist jokes.
</P>
<P>
   McNair has been belittled by journalists who make such veiled
remarks as ``he cannot run an offense.'' Yet he is 11-2 as a
starter this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``All Steve does,'' center Bruce Matthews said, ``is win.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the quandary that football, mirroring society, finds
itself in. We must note how important McNair's start in the Super
Bowl is, and the progress the sport is making. Last April, three
black quarterbacks, Daunte Culpepper, Donovan McNabb and Akili
Smith, were picked in the first round of the NFL draft. Shaun King,
who came close to leading the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to an upset over
the Rams on Sunday, was selected in the second. Before that draft,
a total of four black quarterbacks had been picked in the first
round.
</P>
<P>
   Thus accomplishments are being made. But that the subject of
black quarterbacks will be discussed repeatedly this week _ here in
Atlanta, and on planes, trains and automobiles across the country _
is also a sign that there is still a long way to go.
</P>
<P>
   McNair is already attempting to play down the talk of race and
his role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't worry about that,'' he said after Tennessee beat
Jacksonville, 33-14, on Sunday. ``I'm a quarterback in the Super
Bowl. That's the way I see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he added, ``But I know all about history.'' &QL;

DIALLO FAMILY ASKS THAT U.S. MONITOR STATE TRIAL OF OFFICERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By AMY WALDMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The parents of Amadou Diallo, accompanied by the Rev. Al
Sharpton and Congressman Charles Rangel, met Monday with Justice
Department officials in Washington to press for federal monitoring
of the state murder trial of the four police officers charged with
killing Diallo last year.
</P>
<P>
   Rangel, a Democrat, and Sharpton had been pushing for the
meeting with Deputy Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. and Bill
Lann Lee, the assistant attorney general for civil rights, since an
appellate court ordered the trial moved from the Bronx to Albany
last month. The lawyers representing the Diallos in a civil case
stemming from the shooting also attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton said the Diallos wanted the Justice Department to use
the monitoring report as the basis for convening a federal grand
jury if the state prosecution is unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he presented Holder with a copy of the medical
examiner's autopsy of Diallo. Sharpton said he believed that the
autopsy showed that many of the 19 bullets that struck Diallo hit
him while he was already on the ground. He also said he gave Holder
a census report showing the racial differences between Bronx and
Albany counties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been involved in many cases, and I think this is the
first time I've been given this level of audience,'' Sharpton said
of the meeting. ``It shows how seriously they're taking the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Christine DiBartolo, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department,
said the department would monitor the state criminal case but that
no decision had been made about details.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen C. Worth, a lawyer for one of the defendants, Officer
Edward McMellon, noted that Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney for
the southern district, had been monitoring the case from the start.
``It would appear,'' he added, ``that Reverend Sharpton is
attempting to ensure that there will be two bites at the apple.''
</P>
<P>
   Replying to the assertion that Diallo was on the ground when
many of the shots were fired, Worth said, ``We believe that the
evidence at trial will reveal a different forensic analysis than
Rev. Sharpton's.''
</P>
<P>
   In Albany, Assemblyman Keith Wright said Monday that the state
Legislature's Black and Hispanic Caucus was pushing for the trial
to be televised by closed circuit to another courtroom in the
Albany courthouse and possibly to a location in New York City.
David Bookstaver, a spokesman for the state Office of Court
Administration, said showing the trial in a second Albany courtroom
was being seriously contemplated ``because of the media and
community interest in the trial.''
</P>
<P>
   The trial courtroom has only 80 seats.
</P>
<P>
   Court TV has filed a motion seeking to televise the trial,
although doing so would require approval by the Legislature.
Current state law does not allow trials to be broadcast, and there
has been no indication that legislative leaders are planning to
reinstate a past law that allowed cameras in courtrooms.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Both Robert Johnson, the Bronx district attorney, and Eliot
Spitzer, the state attorney general, have indicated that they
support televising the Diallo trial in particular and trials in
general.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attorney general believes strongly there should be cameras
in the courtroom and would urge the Legislature to renew the law
permitting trials to be televised,'' said Scott Brown, a spokesman
for Spitzer.
</P>
<P>
   The jury pool for the trial has already begun to be winnowed,
said John A. Diamond, Albany County commissioner of jurors.
</P>
<P>
   A good number of the 2,000 jurors who received letters ordering
them to report on Monday have been calling with excuses, ranging
from business appointments to children's school holidays, and
asking for an alternate date to serve. Diamond said few of the
callers had mentioned the Diallo trial or indicated that it was why
they did not want to serve.

CAPRIATI REACHES SEMIFINALS IN CRUSHING DISPLAY AGAINST SUGIYAMA 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MELBOURNE, Australia _ She was a semifinalist at the French Open
at 14, a semifinalist at the U.S. Open and Wimbledon at 15. But
Jennifer Capriati had to wait until adulthood to reach the
semifinals at the other Grand Slam tennis event.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, she rounded off her resume with an ease that belied
the difficulties she has experienced off court in recent years.
Shrugging off a stomach injury that required treatment early in the
match, she overpowered Ai Sugiyama of Japan, 6-0, 6-2, in the
Australian Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll pinch myself after the tournament,'' the 23-year-old
Capriati said in an interview with Australian television.
</P>
<P>
   She needed only 55 minutes to defeat Sugiyama, whose play
Tuesday admittedly bore little resemblance to her performances
earlier in the tournament. The match was played indoors after Open
organizers closed the roof over Rod Laver Arena because of rain.
Sugiyama walked on court with her left thigh wrapped tightly and
did not move or control the ball as well as she had in her upset of
fourth-seeded Mary Pierce on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think she had played on center court yet, and I had
played a few there already,'' Capriati said. ``It takes some
getting used to. The speed is a little different than on the
outside courts.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Capriati had difficulty recognizing Sugiyama's game, the
Japanese must have had difficulty recognizing hers, as well.
Capriati is no longer the same erratic and uncertain player whom
Sugiyama had beaten in their two most recent matches. With the help
of her coach, Harold Solomon, and her physical trainer, Karen
Burnette, she has regained her confidence and improved her fitness.
She is getting to the ball early, which allows her to use her
natural power to full effect.
</P>
<P>
   Now, she is back in a Grand Slam semifinal for the first time
since 1991, when she lost to Monica Seles at the U.S. Open in one
of the most intense and hard-hitting women's matches in memory, one
that ended in a final-set tiebreaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jennifer can't hit the ball much better than she did today,''
Solomon said.
</P>
<P>
   Capriati will face either second-seeded Lindsay Davenport or
ninth-seeded Julie Halard-Decugis of France. Davenport and
Halard-Decugis were to play later Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's unbelievable,'' Solomon said of Capriati's
run. ``Our goal in the fall was for her to gear for this
tournament. We thought she could get herself ready to go and be a
real threat to win here. We thought if she could put in the work,
this would be a great time to get a good start to the season,
because this tournament comes shortly after Christmas and not
everybody is able to put in the same kind of preparation.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Capriati's return to prominence has not been sudden.
</P>
<P>
   The groundwork was laid last year, when she played in all four
Grand Slam events for the first time in six years and reached the
fourth round at the French Open and the U.S. Open. At Flushing
Meadows, she broke down in tears at a news conference after
announcing that she wanted to put her past behind her and not
discuss the personal problems that caused her to leave the tour in
1993 and kept her from playing another Grand Slam event until 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Capriati is now guaranteed to return to the top 20 for the first
time since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she definitely has grown off the court,'' Solomon
said. ``She's an introspective young lady who thinks about things a
lot and has matured and developed in a lot of different ways. I
think her development off the court is reflected on the court. Not
the other way around.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, with Serena Williams' loss on Monday, top-seeded Martina
Hingis and Davenport remain the favorites to meet in the final.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've lost to her three times, so I would love to play her
actually,'' Hingis said about Davenport after the Swiss player
scored a 6-1, 7-6 (7-3) victory over Sandrine Testud of France on
Monday night.

EARLY RETURNS GIVE GORE EASY WIN IN IOWA CAUCUSES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ Vice President Al Gore easily won the Iowa
Democratic presidential caucuses Monday, complicating the task of
challenger Bill Bradley as the campaign turns toward the New
Hampshire primary a week from Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Early returns from across the state in the first meaningful test
of the 2000 campaign pointed to Gore scoring a victory of slightly
less than 2-to-1. With most of the precincts reporting, Gore had 63
percent to Bradley's 35 percent. The final result will set the
presidential preference of the 47 regular delegates from Iowa to
the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles in August.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's first public reaction came in a telephone conversation
with his top supporter in the Granite State, Gov. Jeanne Shaheen:
``We have a big win here. My message to you in New Hampshire is, we
have just begun to fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, addressing supporters in a Des Moines hotel ballroom,
recalled he had always said that running for president required a
combination of humility and confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight, I have a little more humility but no less confidence
that I can win and do the job,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's victory was widely predicted in pre-caucus polling, and
his margin in initial returns was close to expectations in the most
significant last-minute surveys.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a solid victory,'' said political analyst Stuart
Rothenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's defeat was magnified by the fact that he spent more
time campaigning in Iowa than Gore, doing the one-on-one
politicking for which the state is famed, and apparently at least
matched the vice president's television ad budget.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, perhaps still best known for his years as a
professional basketball star, had hoped to stun Gore _ and
political observers _ with a closer outcome in Iowa that might have
fueled his insurgent bid in the eight days before the New Hampshire
vote. Bradley's lead in New Hampshire polls was slipping even
before the Iowa caucus Monday.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire voters are often unimpressed with decisions made
in Iowa, and Gore will be careful not to sound too triumphal or
suggest that the Iowa results mean that the race is, in effect,
over. But the burst of media coverage focusing on Gore's victory
seems certain to have some effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very independent place,'' said Sen. John Kerry,
D-Mass., a Gore supporter who has spent several days lately
campaigning for him in New Hampshire. ``The vice president will not
go to New Hampshire with any presumptions.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bradley, who spent Monday urging Iowa supporters to go
to their caucus, left before midnight to fly to New Hampshire so
they would be in place for the early morning news shows and a full
day of campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   By being damaged in Iowa, Bradley now faces the prospect of
losing support of moderate independents in New Hampshire to Sen.
John McCain, the Arizona Republican who did not formally campaign
in Iowa and leads Gov. George W. Bush of Texas in polls in the next
major stop on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the caucuses, some Bradley supporters were
questioning whether he, like McCain, should have skipped Iowa and
begun his campaign in New Hampshire, where grass-roots organizing
and support of party regulars counts for less.
</P>
<P>
   In the last days of the Iowa campaign, Bradley began to lower
his sights _ and, he hoped, the media's expectations _ by saying he
would be satisfied with the 31 percent that Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass., got against President Carter in Iowa in the 1980 caucuses.
Kennedy belittled that scenario in a weekend appearance in Cedar
Falls for Gore, recalling his showing 20 years ago and remarking:
``I don't ever remember making a victory statement.''
</P>
<P>
   The caucuses, in more than 2,000 precincts across the frigid
Midwestern landscape, were not only the beginning of the nominating
process but the conclusion of one of the most frenetic preseason
campaigns in many years.
</P>
<P>
   When it became clear that other potential Gore challengers were
staying out of the race, the two-man Democratic contest formed
quickly and sharply. The two former Senate colleagues dueled not
only about substantive issues, especially an appropriate federal
health care plan, but also presidential style and leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, 56, sought to picture himself as a potentially bolder
leader than Gore, 51, whom he pictured as a creature of Washington
_ having grown up in the capital as the son of a senator and
quickly entering national politics himself. Gore, on the other
hand, faulted Bradley for leaving Congress in 1996 just as the
Democrats needed stalwarts to ``stay and fight'' the Republican
majorities in the House and Senate, especially then-House Speaker
Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Gore quickly lined up not only the support of a big majority of
major Democratic elected officials who have taken a position in the
race but also the AFL-CIO, one of the major building blocks of the
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   As Bradley first began his rounds in Iowa almost a year ago,
Gore's campaign seemed unfocused, and the situation got worse for
the vice president as the year progressed. But even with his effort
in some disarray, Gore's connections to the White House allowed him
an institutional edge and garnered endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Gore's approach to Iowa was a classic example of
how one-time state Democratic chairman David Nagle said a
presidential campaign in the state should be run: ``Organize,
organize, organize. Then get hot at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's caucus victory had a historical twist. In his first
presidential race in 1988, Gore refused to campaign in the state,
which he called ``a ridiculous test'' and ``an arcane procedure
that produces crazy results.'' But over the seven years that he has
been vice president, Gore has so assiduously courted Iowa Democrats
that Bradley could make little use of the earlier criticisms.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, by the end of the campaign, it was Bradley who was
complaining that the Iowa caucuses rewarded ``entrenched power,''
an acknowledgment of Gore's upper hand with the party elite.
</P>
<P>
   And Bradley lost some of his anti-politics image when he accused
Gore of starting the racially divisive attacks on Massachusetts
inmate Willie Horton in 1988. Gore had raised the furlough system
but never mentioned Horton by name.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said ``he wasn't going negative, and he went negative.
It made him look like a politician,'' Rothenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was also bedeviled in the final days of the Iowa
campaign by questions about new bouts of an irregular heartbeat, at
least some of which may have been brought on by the stress of
campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   More problematic for Bradley in rural, farm-oriented Iowa seemed
to be his voting record as a senator from New Jersey, the nation's
most densely populated state.
</P>
<P>
   If there was a single turning point in the Iowa Democratic
campaign, it came Jan. 8 during a debate in which Gore, pointing to
a farmer in the audience, asked Bradley why he had voted against
increased emergency aid for the flood-stricken Midwest in 1993.

FOR FORBES, ORGANIZATION AND MONEY PAY OFF IN IOWA 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to insert quotes from Forbes as new 3rd and 4th grafs.)

<P>
   WEST DES MOINES, Iowa _ After spending more time in Iowa than
any other candidate and digging deeply into his own pockets to
finance his campaign, Steve Forbes' bet on the Iowa caucuses seems
to have paid off.
</P>
<P>
   What a difference four years makes. In 1996, he entered the
state late, had little organization and came in a distant fourth.
This time, learning from that episode, he mounted a lavish
campaign, organized a formidable grass-roots organization and
positioned himself as the champion of the conservative wing of the
Republican party.
</P>
<P>
   ``We broke the political rules,'' Forbes told his supporters
here Monday night. ``The power brokers and the power elite are
worried because they have no hooks in me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not give in,'' he added. ``We will get a political
system that reflects our highest ideals and not our baser
instincts.''
</P>
<P>
   And, though he had plenty of competition for the conservative
vote, Forbes' twin messages _ anti-tax and anti-abortion _ were
strong enough to propel him into a strong second-place showing and
give him the bounce he sought to carry him into New Hampshire for
its primary next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   As the results trickled in, a balloon-festooned room began to
fill up with Forbes supporters wearing the orange T-shirts and blue
baseball caps that the campaign had distributed over the last few
months. Close to 9 p.m., as they heard that the candidate was about
to arrive, many carried little platters bulging with food and
plastic cups of beer and soda from an ample buffet.
</P>
<P>
   Two large television screens beamed the election results down to
the crowd. ``We believe in Steve! We believe in Steve!'' the crowd
chanted as it heard of Forbes' impending arrival.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ecstatic,'' said Keith Appell, a spokesman for the
Forbes organization. ``This has shattered our expectations. Steve
Forbes proved that he's the conservative who can go all the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as voters were going to the caucuses, the Forbes campaign
was broadcasting its television commercials _ a sign of the lavish
spending and attention to detail that has characterized the Forbes
campaign in Iowa. Over the last year, Forbes dipped into his
personal fortune of more than $440 million to spend $25 million of
his own money. That came on top of the $37 million he spent on his
1996 bid.
</P>
<P>
   In the August straw poll, Forbes gained 21 percent of the vote.
He was hoping to get at least that on Monday. But it was unclear,
given the fact that three other candidates were fighting for the
conservative vote, how much beyond that he could get.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Blackwell, Forbes' national chairman, worked the crowd and
crowed: ``We're delighted with this showing. Our goal was to get
over 23 percent. To have 31 to 32 percent is a tremendous
statement. You add up the conservative vote and it's a clear
statement that Bush is out of step with the conservative wing of
the party and, as he is going into New Hampshire, that is not a
nice place to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' staff attributed his strong showing to his highly
organized and well-financed campaign and his ability to unite
social and economic conservatives behind him.
</P>
<P>
   They said that his showing here made him the only viable
candidate among the four conservatives in the upcoming New
Hampshire primary, where the moderate Republican vote will be
divided between Bush and McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we go into New Hampshire, we won't have the same challenge
as in Iowa,'' said Greg Mueller, the Forbes campaign communications
director. ``In New Hampshire, with our strong No. 2 showing here,
we will be unopposed by any other conservative. We will have a
broad-based neo-Reagan message.''
</P>
<P>
   To shore up his support among conservatives, Forbes continued to
hit hard at the abortion theme in the final days of the campaign,
bringing in Phyllis Schlafly and Rep. Bob Barr of Georgia, both
conservative anti-abortion leaders. He also flooded the airwaves
and filled mailboxes in an anti-abortion advertising blitz.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he kept up his signature anti-tax theme, an attack
that continued to get rousing applause as he crissed-crossed the
state in a two-bus caravan and, later, in a chartered DC-9.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes consistently proposed far more drastic tax cuts than
either Bush or McCain, whom Forbes repeatedly termed the ``timid
twins on taxation'' in his stump speech.
</P>
<P>
   But as persuasive as Forbes' message may have been, his
formidable organization and his seemingly endless campaigning here
were at least as important.
</P>
<P>
   He spent 77 days here, more than any other candidate, Democrat
or Republican. And, dipping into his personal fortune of more than
$440 million, he spent $31 million in 1999 seeking the presidency _
$25 million of his own money and $6 million in donations.
</P>
<P>
   That money helped pay for a grass-roots effort in which no
detail was spared. More than 90,000 Iowa families were identified
as ``Forbes-friendly.'' A formidable databank was created that
tapped into a whole new constituency for Forbes _ conservatives who
had never before participated in a caucus. The Forbes campaign
estimated that between 30 percent and 50 percent of the eligible
voters at Forbes rallies had never voted in caucuses before.
</P>
<P>
   The organization was so sophisticated and high-tech that by the
time people signed cards identifying themselves as Forbes
supporters, that information was put into a computer and the people
were contacted by day's end. On caucus night, Forbes supporters
with e-mail were sent personalized directions to their caucus site
by computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were able to find voters that the pollsters couldn't find
because they were motivated and nontraditional conservatives who
had never really been active before,'' said Steve Grubbs, Forbes'
Iowa campaign chairman. ``And that became a really energized
base.''
</P>
<P>
   The main challenge facing Forbes in Iowa, and one he will not
face in New Hampshire, was that he was forced to fight with three
other candidates _ Gary Bauer, Alan Keyes and Orrin Hatch _ for
conservative voters, while Bush _ once such candidates as Elizabeth
Dole and Dan Quayle dropped out of the race _ had the entire
moderate field to himself.
</P>
<P>
   To counter this, Forbes outcampaigned and outspent his
conservative rivals, while continuing to take positions that moved
him further and further to the right.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, where there are fewer social conservatives,
more economic conservatives and a greater propensity for contrarian
views, the Forbes strategy may shift somewhat, campaign officials
said..
</P>
<P>
   Forbes will present himself as the only conservative choice and
will make special efforts to focus on other groups, like gun
owners, while hitting hard on the tax issue. Already, one of that
state's leading anti-tax groups, the Granite State Taxpayers, has
endorsed Forbes and is working on his behalf. In addition, Forbes'
endorsement by the state's leading newspaper, The Manchester
Union-Leader, which has a conservative philosophy, is also seen as
a boost.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ After waiting nearly five hours in a suburban airport
here Monday, the two Cuban grandmothers of Elian Gonzalez gave up
their effort to meet the boy and flew to Washington as their
custody battle moved to a new stage.
</P>
<P>
   The grandmothers were scheduled to meet on Tuesday with members
of Congress, who have helped turn their fight into an international
tug of war.
</P>
<P>
   Their private twin-engine Learjet, provided by the National
Council of Churches, left Kendall-Tamiani Executive Airport just as
three of the grandmothers' relatives and their lead lawyer arrived
to talk with them _ without the only person they wanted to see,
Elian.
</P>
<P>
   A Miami police official said the plane was heading for
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The grandmothers' departure, after a late-scheduled trip from
New York to Miami Monday morning, was the latest leg of their
four-day odyssey to bring the boy home to his father, who was
divorced from his mother. His mother drowned two months ago during
an escape from Cuba, but Elian survived, clinging for two days to
an inner tube in the Atlantic off Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Lazaro Gonzalez was clearly miffed by the women's departure.
``We feel very happy that they were here in Miami,'' Gonzalez said.
``We have tried to greet them with love. They have acted in a very
disappointing way toward the family. Elian got dressed up to meet
his grandmothers, and it never happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The boy's grandmothers became ``frightened and scared'' about
coming to Miami, said Bob Edgar, general secretary of the National
Council of Churches. With other council officials, Edgar has been
shepherding the women since their departure from Havana on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They see the thousands of people here in Miami,'' he said,
``marching and protesting, and you can imagine as very simple,
loving, caring grandparents that they would be frightened to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were safer to be out of harm's way, and that's why they
left. They have returned to Washington, D.C., and they will remain
there ready to come back at a moment's notice.''
</P>
<P>
   Edgar said he would stay in Miami another day to meet with the
relatives if they agreed to see him.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier plans had called for the grandmothers to have dinner
with relatives who had been caring for Elian, but the 6 p.m. EST
dinner date came and went without the grandmothers' leaving the
airport. At 8 p.m., three of the relatives and their lead attorney,
Spencer Eig, left the house and headed for the airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they really love him, they will come see him,'' said Elly
Carrera, 17, a Cuban-American who supports Elian's great-uncle
Lazaro Gonzalez in his appeal for custody of the boy and who was
standing outside the Gonzalez home, where the grandmothers were to
have dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously they don't love him,'' Ms. Carrera said. ``They are
speaking Castro's words. Castro wants to win. But we won't let him
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, scores of onlookers and media waited outside
the house. Inside, a cousin said Elian was watching a video of
``Home Alone 3.''
</P>
<P>
   The boy's case started as a family feud and has erupted into an
international incident with anti-Castro Cuban-Americans urging that
he be reared in the United States and that his father be denied
custody.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress, and in particular those from Florida,
seized upon the issue Monday, the lawmakers' first day back at work
after a two-month recess. Sen. Connie Mack and Rep. Bill McCollum,
both Florida Republicans, introduced bills to grant the boy
citizenship or permanent residency. Meanwhile, several House
Democrats offered other bills blocking them.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami relatives, led by Lazaro Gonzalez and his family, have
claimed custody of the boy in defiance of the Clinton
administration and the pleas of the father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez,
to repatriate him. The grandmothers, who flew to New York on
Friday, are Raquel Rodriguez, mother of Elizabet Brotons Rodriguez,
Elian's mother, and Mariela Quintana, the father's mother.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   All day Monday, plans had unfolded to bring the grandmothers to
the Little Havana home of Lazaro Gonzalez, a paternal great-uncle
of Elian, and his wife, Angela, and 21-year-old daughter,
Marisleysis.
</P>
<P>
   Carole Florman, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said
authorities had tried to arrange a meeting of family members at a
more neutral location.
</P>
<P>
   ``The grandmothers were not comfortable with a meeting at
Lazaro's house,'' Ms. Florman said. ``They want a private meeting
with the boy.''
</P>
<P>
   It was clear that the Gonzalez family here and its publicists
had been going to some lengths to establish the impression of an
ideal, welcoming home for Elian. Rather than calling another
protest in support of the relatives, leaders of the Cuban-American
groups carpeted the sidewalk outside the house with pink, yellow
and red carnations.
</P>
<P>
   Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Republican member of Congress from Miami,
said while visiting the home early Monday: ``The family's looking
forward to the grandmas' coming. It's always been a family full of
love.'' Like other leaders of the exile community she urged that if
the father and grandmother wanted custody they come to Miami and
``testify in court where it can be decided impartially.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian's grandmothers plan to meet Tuesday in Washington with
members of Congress, including Sen. Christopher J. Dodd, D-Conn.,
who every year sponsors legislation to ease the trade embargo with
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Just before embarking on their trip to the United States, which
led to a meeting with Attorney General Janet Reno and with Doris
Meissner, commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service, the grandmothers had predicated any trip to the United
States, their first off Cuban soil, on retrieving Elian.
</P>
<P>
   But theirs and the administration's hands are tied by suits
filed in federal court here last week enjoining the administration
from repatriating Elian and asking for the right to apply for
political asylum. So instead they asked Ms. Reno to help organize a
visit with the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers introduced three bills Monday, two in the House and
one in the Senate, to grant Elian citizenship or permanent
residency. They said their legislation would put the decision in
the hands of a Florida state judge instead of the federal
Immigration and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   Mack, who sponsored the Senate bill with five other lawmakers,
said he wanted to take politics out of the decision. But state
judges in Florida are elected, and any judge in the Miami area,
where Elian is living with relatives, is likely to face tremendous
pressure to rule that the boy stay in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The lead sponsor of a companion bill in the House, McCollum,
said, ``Any decision made by a governmental agency is contrary to
his best interest and clearly against his mother's desires.''
</P>
<P>
   A bill proposed by House Democrats, including Reps. Robert
Menendez of New Jersey and Patrick J. Kennedy of Rhode Island,
would grant permanent residency instead of citizenship, to allow
Elian to decide his citizenship on his own when he is older.
</P>
<P>
   But another group of House members, including Reps. Charles B.
Rangel, D-N.Y., Barney Frank, D-Mass., and Ray LaHood, R-Ill.,
introduced a resolution to block the citizenship bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that this 6-year-old boy who lost his
mother in a tragic accident at sea should be reunited with his
father,'' Rangel said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   In suing for custody in federal court here, Lazaro Gonzalez
maintains that he and his family can assure Elian a happier
upbringing than his father and the grandmothers, who live in the
Cuban town of Cardenas.

BRADLEY SAYS CAMPAIGN IS ON RIGHT PATH
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds: ADDS sentence to 2nd graf with Bradley trailing Gore in Iowa;
adds new 7th graf, With that ..., with Tsongas' widow appearing in
Bradley ad.) 
 (nk) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   AMES, Iowa _ Despite concerns among some aides about the state
of his campaign, former Sen. Bill Bradley said Monday that he was
more convinced than ever that the course he chartered for his
presidential campaign more than a year ago was fundamentally
correct.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Bradley's insurgent campaign has been battered
by negative news coverage and falling poll numbers, and many
political analysts have argued that he has not been sharp enough in
drawing distinctions with Gore or aggressive enough in responding
to the vice president's repeated attacks. With about a third of the
precincts reporting, Bradley was trailing Gore badly in the Iowa
caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   Even some of his aides have recently raised questions about the
campaign's tactics in Iowa, complaining that it had been late
getting organized, slow to respond to Gore's criticisms and
inadequate in preparing for debates. One adviser described Iowa as
a ``shakedown tour'' for the Bradley organization.
</P>
<P>
   But in an interview Monday just before the Iowa caucuses,
Bradley suggested that if anything he had been too negative in his
battle with Gore, arguing that the ``rat-a-tat-tat'' of the race
might have turned off voters and drawn attention from his own
idealistic call to reform politics and end poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were trying to do a cookie-cutter campaign where you go
negative on somebody, there's a little textbook that you take that
says, chapter four, going negative, here are the five things you
do,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What adds to cynicism in politics is negative campaigning and
attack ads,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   But even as Bradley contends that he will try to stay above the
messy fray, his aides said they recognized that they, and Bradley's
prominent supporters, will need to strike back faster and perhaps
more fiercely against Gore when he goes on the offensive.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, the Bradley campaign began running a
television advertisement in New Hampshire on Monday in which Niki
Tsongas, the widow of former Sen. Paul E. Tsongas, D-Mass., accuses
the Gore campaign of distorting Bradley's record. During the 1992
presidential campaign, Tsongas made similar accusations against
Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said he realized his campaign had drifted from its
moorings last week when he heard the story of a New Hampshire woman
whose teen-age son apologized for getting sick because the family
had no health insurance. Her story, which brought tears to his
eyes, ``recentered'' him on the reasons he had entered the race,
particularly to create a system of near universal health insurance,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes in the rat-a-tat-tat of politics, in the rush of the
media and the emphasis on tactics, you lose sight of why you're in
this,'' he said. But there may also be political reasons for
Bradley's wanting to step back from attacking Gore. Two weeks ago,
Bradley had been sharpening his criticism of the vice president,
even attacking a 15-year-old Senate vote by Gore that helped the
tobacco industry. But many analysts said Bradley's attacks gave a
sense of desperation in his camp.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has also toned down his criticism of Bradley in recent
days. Asked whether he would return fire if Gore started attacking
him again in New Hampshire, site of the nation's first primary next
Tuesday, Bradley replied, ``You always have the option, of course,
to adopt the atomic bomb. But the point is, I'm going to try to
keep this thing positive.''
</P>
<P>
   To both his critics and supporters, Bradley's refusal to
aggressively attack Gore recalls his 1990 re-election campaign,
where he was very slow to respond to criticism by his opponent,
Christie Whitman, and almost lost the New Jersey Senate race. Some
political analysts argued that the race showed that Bradley was too
headstrong to adjust his strategies to deal with unforeseen or
shifting circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley denied that he was inflexible, saying: ``I think
there should be a distinction drawn between being inflexible and
being rooted. I'm rooted in what I know what I believe and what I
know I want to do. I'm flexible in how I want to achieve it.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had no plans to change significantly his basic stump
speech in the coming weeks. But Bradley offered a glimpse Monday of
the message he intends to emphasize in New Hampshire: that he would
be better at maintaining the nation's prosperity because he has a
track record of predicting changes in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been on the point, meaning I have been there a few
years before other people,'' he said, referring to his early
support in the 1980s for cutting the deficit, reducing Third World
debt and simplifying the tax code.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has also sought to cast himself as the best candidate for
managing the nation's economy.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said he would increasingly highlight the economic
benefits of his health-care proposal, which he said would provide
the equivalent of a $25 billion-a-year tax cut for people earning
less than $50,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is those families don't know yet what I'm trying to
do,'' Bradley said of lower-income voters.

BUSH CLAIMS `RECORD-SHATTERING VICTORY' IN IOWA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush emerged the clear
winner in the Iowa Republican caucuses Monday night, the first
official vote in the 2000 nominating contest for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's victory was tempered by a stronger than expected
showing by businessman Steve Forbes and a respectable finish by
former Reagan administration official Allen Keyes.
</P>
<P>
   With most precincts reporting, returns showed Bush, son of the
former president, receiving 41 percent of the Republican vote,
Forbes with 30 percent and Keyes, 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative activist Gary Bauer received 9 percent of the
caucus vote; Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, 1 percent; and Sen. John
McCain, who did not campaign in the state, &UR;  &LR; 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush's finish ahead of Forbes was less than forecast by
some of his top Iowa supporters, the governor claimed ``a
record-shattering victory.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never dreamt I'd be able to get such a high vote,'' Bush
told reporters at his hotel in Des Moines.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to supporters before setting off to New Hampshire,
Bush described his vote as ``a victory of a message that is
conservative and compassionate.''
</P>
<P>
   A survey of caucus participants by Voters News Service on Monday
evening found Bush supporters saying that moral values and taxes
were their top criteria in choosing which candidate to support.
</P>
<P>
   The VNS survey also found that many of Bush's caucus supporters
picked him because they believe he can defeat the Democratic
nominee in the November general election.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, according to the survey, did better than Bush among
voters whose top priority was conservative values.
</P>
<P>
   For all the energy and money candidates pour into Iowa, the
record of those who finished ahead in recent years shows none
reaching the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Except for Keyes' third-place, double-digit showing, the
candidates' finishing order has been forecast for more than five
months, since Bush's convincing victory in the Iowa GOP's straw
poll in August.
</P>
<P>
   The display of Bush's organizational strength in the straw poll,
along with his record-setting fund raising, drove three nationally
known Republicans from the race. With the exit of Lamar Alexander,
Elizabeth Dole and Dan Quayle, only Forbes remained with pockets
deep enough to challenge Bush in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Although Forbes invested millions here _ mostly from his
personal publishing fortune _ he made no predictions about
upsetting Bush. Instead, the New Jersey businessman forecast that
his showing would surprise observers.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's name was on the ballot, but he did not campaign in Iowa
or attempt to build the kind of organization needed for a good
showing in the state's caucus system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just very pleased that 5 percent would come out in the
cold to vote for us,'' he told reporters in New Hampshire. ``That's
five percent more than I thought.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's decision not to join the farm-state fray put off the
GOP's first truly competitive presidential contest until New
Hampshire, where McCain on Monday held his 100th town hall meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona senator has front-runner status over Bush in some
recent New Hampshire polls. Forbes runs third.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was unfazed about the prospects of his rivals picking up
momentum in Iowa that might propel them past him in the Feb. 1
Granite State primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of New Hampshire don't pay a great deal of
attention to what happens in Iowa,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   At a rally in Hanover, N.H., his fifth public event of the day,
McCain told several hundred supporters,``the preliminaries are
over. The playoff starts tomorrow, and we are going to win that
playoff.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am convinced we are in for a history making seven days.''
</P>
<P>
   The distant sixth-place finish by Hatch almost certainly doomed
his bid for the Republican presidential nomination. Early Monday he
said he must finish fourth or better in the caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I've contributed to this race,'' Hatch said.
``There are a lot of issues (in) the forefront (now) that were not
being discussed.''
</P>
<P>
   Since December, Forbes has aggressively accused Bush of breaking
a no-tax pledge in Texas. The publishing magnate even recruited a
Houston woman to appear in a television commercial criticizing the
governor for proposing a sales tax increase after his promise not
to.
</P>
<P>
   Although Iowans look dimly on what they consider negative ads,
one campaign's poll showed Bush's rating for honesty being cut in
half in Iowa over the past three months.
</P>
<P>
   In the final week before the caucuses, Bush found himself
answering repeated questions on abortion, a testament to the
strength of social conservatives in the Iowa GOP.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has been pressed on his anti-abortion commitment to the
point that one staff member told reporters to expect less access to
the candidate so he could talk about other issues his aides believe
are less volatile.
</P>
<P>
   When questioned, Bush has confirmed his commitment to a
constitutional amendment banning abortions as outlined in the
Republican Party platform since Ronald Reagan was president.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Bush has refused to say he would appoint only
anti-abortion justices to the Supreme Court or select a vice
presidential running mate based on his or her position on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's showing in Iowa was better than the 37 percent,
historically the high water mark, received by Bob Dole in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, George H.W. Bush led Ronald Reagan in Iowa. But Reagan
went on two terms as president.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Pat Robertson and the Christian Coalition roared into a
strong second-place finish ahead of Vice President Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Pat Buchanan nearly defeated Bob Dole here, then went
on to upset him in New Hampshire, stopping Dole's momentum and
raising doubts about the strength of his candidacy.

AFTER PAYTON'S EARLY EXIT, KNICKS MAKE IT INTERESTING
</HEADLINE>

 By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORk _ After all the yearning for an All-Star point guard in
New York, Gary Payton's annual visit to Madison Square Garden
lasted less than 11 minutes Monday night. The floor leader of the
Seattle SuperSonics was ejected after two straight technical fouls
in the first quarter, a development that on paper appeared
incredibly lucky for the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   But then this Shammond Williams character came off the bench, a
virtual unknown who started knocking down long 3-pointers and
throwing down monstrous dunks. And Vin Baker and Brent Barry became
flammable from the outside. Just like that, one of the more
entertaining games of New York's season unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   Allan Houston and Latrell Sprewell helped the Knicks eventually
wake from their slumber, combining for 51 points in a 112-106
victory over Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Ewing (18 points in 30 minutes) was clutch, too, putting
back a missed shot with 2 minutes 26 seconds to play to give the
Knicks a 6-point cushion and then helping push the lead to 105-96
with 1:14 left when he found Houston for a 3-pointer as Ewing drove
down the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Baker and Barry finished with 21 points apiece, and Williams led
the Sonics with 22 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks won their fifth straight at the Garden with a superb
finish, but not before a wild incident in the first quarter
severely tainted the game.
</P>
<P>
   Payton was ejected with 1:28 left in the first quarter by the
referee Ted Bernhardt, who was maybe 25 feet away from Payton when
he threw him out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Without one of the top players in the game, the Sonics could
have wilted. But they regrouped and played as well as possible
until the final minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle closed to 93-91 with a 4-point play. Barry made a
3-pointer and Kurt Thomas was charged for a foul against Ruben
Patterson, who made the free throw with 5:01 left to raise serious
concerns as to whether the Knicks could hold on.
</P>
<P>
   Losing Payton had the appearance of a gift for the Knicks. But
Williams, the diminutive second-year point guard who had scored
only 12 points all season (with a career high of 3), was
scintillating in relief.
</P>
<P>
   Fearless and spry at barely 6 feet tall, he went through the
heart of the Knicks' defense at one juncture in the third quarter
and dunked hard.
</P>
<P>
   Baker was also doing what he could to share the scoring burden,
dipping his shoulder into Marcus Camby and Ewing until he found a
sliver of light in which to release his soft jump hook. The Knicks
were doing their fair share to give the Sonics confidence, too,
failing to block out on defense and allowing some of the easiest
put-back dunks of the season.
</P>
<P>
   With less than eight minutes to play, Seattle led by 3 points
before the Knicks came alive. Houston's shots began falling, his
teammates passed the ball to the open man on the fast break and
instantly they transformed themselves into a transition team to
combat Seattle's resilience.

A DIFFICULT CHOICE FOR IOWA DEMOCRATS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ About half of the standing-room-only crowd in
a math classroom at Hoover High School were wearing Bradley
stickers, and half had Gore buttons.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there was no discussion of the two Democrats' relative
merits at the caucus here, and the only drama of the evening came
when one woman's cell phone rang at a quiet moment: Would her young
neighbor be able to baby-sit at short notice? (Yes, as it turned
out.)
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, by a simple head count, the precinct chairman
tallied 43 people for Vice President Al Gore and 50 for former Sen.
Bill Bradley, meaning that three of the precinct's delegates went
to each man. Then, polite applause.
</P>
<P>
   ``The battle is beforehand,'' said Peter Larsen, a retired
Lutheran pastor who supports Bradley. ``Most of us had been to five
or six rallies and made up our minds before we came.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet like all but one of a couple of dozen people interviewed at
the caucus, Larsen also said he liked both men and found the
decision a close call. ``I could have supported either one of
them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another Bradley supporter, John Hunt, a 68-year-old investment
banker, said all his years of caucus-going had been similarly, and
quite pleasantly, dull. ``It's never very confrontational; we're
Iowans,'' he said, adding: ``Albert Gore's a fine man. So is Bill
Bradley.''
</P>
<P>
   The two camps certainly looked exactly the same, with both
including men and women of all ages, and both nearly all white;
They split the minority vote, one and one.
</P>
<P>
   All of the caucus-goers seemed to have been extensively courted
by both candidates. One woman, Christine Marchand, a 27-year-old
market researcher, said she made up her mind the previous evening
to vote for Bradley, after a call from an old New Jersey friend of
the senator. When he couldn't answer one of her questions, he put
Marcia Aronoff, Bradley's senior policy adviser, on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   A number of those who ended up choosing Bradley said they did so
because of Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worry about how easy it's going to be for the Republicans to
paint Gore as evil and run clips of all the nice things he said
about Clinton,'' said Stuart Klugman, 51.
</P>
<P>
   Gore supporters, on the other hand, more often pointed to
specific issues of interest to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a research scientist and Gore has always been strong on
funding for research,'' said Don Mattson, 49. ``It was that and
Gore on the environment, though I wouldn't have been disappointed
with Bradley, either. It wasn't quite a flip of a coin.''

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: WHAT HAPPENS IF THE BUDGET SURPLUS IS REAL? 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There has been a large dose of unreality to the presidential
debates from the start. Each of the major candidates proposed
paying for initiatives by tapping surpluses that were more
speculative than real. True, the Congressional Budget Office had
told them that the federal surplus, outside the Social Security
program, would equal about $1 trillion over the next 10 years. But
that estimate was based on a highly debatable assumption _ that
Congress would adhere to onerous spending caps it set in 1997 to
achieve a balanced budget. Those caps were broken open this year, a
measure of the difficulty in meeting them. If scrupulously observed
the next two years, the caps would require Congress to cut
non-military discretionary programs by an astonishing 30 percent
and then maintain the programs at that level for the next decade.
Virtually no one expects Congress to inflict that much pain. Under
the more reasonable assumption that Congress keeps current programs
intact, there will be no federal surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Bill Bradley said that future surpluses would pay for his
$650 billion, 10-year program of universal health insurance. George
W. Bush's plan would cut taxes by more than $1 trillion, courtesy
of the surplus. Even the fiscal moderates, Al Gore and John McCain,
proposed paying for slimmed-down versions of their opponents' plans
with future surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   Misleading proposals all _ perhaps until Wednesday at about 10
a.m.
</P>
<P>
   At that time the Congressional Budget Office, Congress' official
scorekeeper, is expected to turn the presidential debates upside
down with revised estimates of projected surpluses that do not
depend on future spending cuts. Nobody knows for certain what the
new estimates will be. But a range of informed observers expect the
budget office to tell the politicians that because of the hot
economy, they will have hundreds of billions more, and perhaps as
much as $1 trillion more, to allocate over the next 10 years. In
this new estimate, the surplus could hit $1 trillion even if
Congress does not cut spending by a dime.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's big-spending health plan and Bush's generous tax cuts
would no longer look so extravagant. The Gore and McCain programs
might look a tad meek. Thus the budget office numbers could change
the tenor of Wednesday night's debates in New Hampshire. Gore and
McCain will find it harder to label their opponents profligate.
Bradley can say, with the budget office as his authority, that his
health plan no longer threatens to eat into Medicare, Medicaid and
all the other federal programs that Gore has charged that Bradley's
plan would shred. Bush can ask McCain why he opposes a big tax cut
that not only robs the Democrats of money for their spending plans
but also could leave billions for deficit reduction, another cause
popular among Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, even a new $1 trillion surplus _ if the number turns
out to be that high _ would not be impervious to congressional
spending plans. The new estimates do not take account of the fact
that Congress is virtually certain to spend more on the military
and farmers. They take no account of the cost of extending tax
credits for corporate research and development and for other
popular purposes. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a
liberal research group, estimates that these items alone could
knock about $200 billion out of the 10-year surplus.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, Medicare costs are projected to double, as a
share of economic output, over the next 30 years, so Congress will
need to pass a major overhaul. Subtract hundreds of billions more
for that purpose, and the surplus grows steadily smaller.
</P>
<P>
   Though it is hard not to rejoice at a $1 trillion surplus, it
does pose political dangers. The money could encourage Congress to
put off reforming Medicare, making future changes all the more
wrenching. It could give cover for Congress to pass tax cuts as
large as, or larger than, those Bush proposes, making it
politically impossible to recover the money once it is needed for
Medicare, covering the uninsured or fixing the nation's schools. So
while the extra money represents opportunity for Bradley supporters
to spend it on liberal causes and for Bush supporters to return it
in a tax cut, it poses political dangers for many politicians in
between.
</P>
<P>
   Even after the revised estimates are issued, voters will find
themselves facing pretty much the same choices tomorrow that they
face today. Vote for Bradley if you want to pursue big-ticket items
like universal health insurance while letting most other
initiatives slide. Vote for Bush if you think the best thing to do
with federal revenue is to return it to taxpayers even if that
means shredding some existing federal programs. Vote for Gore or
McCain for programs that pose less fiscal risk if sunny budget
estimates turn out wrong. But even if the broad choices remain
familiar, an extra $1 trillion added to the budget office estimate
will inject a new element of passion into the primary debates.  &QL;

<P>
   Dr. Herbert S. Gutowsky, who pioneered the use of the technique
of nuclear magnetic resonance for determining the structure of
molecules, died on Jan. 13 at a hospital in Urbana, Ill. Dr.
Gutowsky, who lived in Urbana since 1948, was 80.
</P>
<P>
   The technique gave chemists a new analytical tool to join X-ray
crystalography and other advanced techniques. A substance
undergoing NMR analysis is placed in a magnetic field and exposed
to electromagnetic radiation. The radiation is partly absorbed by
the substance, and analysis of the spectrums of the absorbed
radiation permits a chemist to determine the molecular structure of
the target substance.
</P>
<P>
   A similar technique was developed for clinical use, allowing
medical technicians to obtain detailed images of parts of the body.
</P>
<P>
   Gutowsky, an emeritus professor at the University of Illinois,
was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and a fellow of
the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Among his
awards were the 1977 National Medal of Science and the 1983 Wolf
Prize in Chemistry.
</P>

CASE SHEDS LIGHT ON ANIMAL-MUTILATION VIDEOS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Calif.)  (mk) 
 By EDWARD WONG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLIP TERRACE, N.Y. _ When law enforcement officials searched
the bedroom of a 27-year-old in this Long Island suburb one night
in 1998, it was not the collection of a half-dozen semiautomatic
rifles and shotguns that most unnerved them. Nor was it the poster
of a Nazi storm trooper.
</P>
<P>
   What stunned them, they said, were the fish tank full of mice, a
pair of high heels coated with dried blood and the contents of 71
animal-mutilation videos with titles like ``Vanessa's Frog Stomp''
and ``Debby the Destructor.''
</P>
<P>
   In one videotape, officials said, a woman's foot impaled a
writhing frog with a stiletto heel. In another, a woman's hand
reached down to burn a mouse with a cigarette. ``In all my years on
the job, I've never seen anything this sick before, this
depraved,'' said Roy Gross of the Suffolk County Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, which charged the man, Thomas
Capriola, with animal cruelty.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, now 29, was investigated after his ex-girlfriend
called Gross' agency to say she had helped Capriola produce the
videos. A trial date for the misdemeanor charge has not been set.
But the case, along with a similar one in Los Angeles scheduled to
go to court Tuesday, is calling attention to a subculture of
animal-mutilation videos that prompted Congress to pass a law
banning the sale of such films.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that these charges ultimately have very little
merit to them,'' said Capriola's lawyer, Paul Gianelli. His client
has pleaded not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   But the authorities say Capriola was a maker of so-called crush
videos, which cater to a male sexual fetish in which viewers become
aroused by watching women, usually in high heels, stomp on small
animals. Capriola, they say, filmed female friends as they killed
hundreds of small animals, then sold the videos and bloodied high
heels through a Web site called ``Crush Goddess'' and classified
ads in pornographic magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Crush films and videos have been made since the 1950s, but only
in the last five years or so have they emerged from the
underground, as advertisements for them have spread from
pornographic magazines to the Internet. The Humane Society of the
United States has counted about 2,000 titles since it began its
monitoring in 1997. They sell for $30 to $300 each.
</P>
<P>
   The videos' increased visibility has even extended to
television, where ``NYPD Blue'' and ``The Practice'' have featured
subplots about crush fetishists. Meanwhile, animal rights advocates
have staged protests and lobbied Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Richard C. Richards, a philosophy professor at California State
Polytechnic University in Pomona who has studied perversions, said
that about 1,000 American men have the crush fetish. ``I think it's
wrong to demonize these things,'' he said. ``These people won't
stop. They can't. Very few of them want to.''
</P>
<P>
   Artwork from Pompeii shows the crush fetish may have existed as
far back as ancient Rome, Richards said. But modern technology has
allowed crush videomakers to sell their products on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The law Congress passed in November makes it a federal offense
to create or distribute ``a depiction of animal cruelty'' for
``commercial gain,'' with penalties ranging from a fine to five
years in prison. Exceptions are made for ``educational'' and
``artistic'' works. ``We tried to get to the folks who are
distributing these things,'' said Rep. Elton Gallegly, a Republican
from Ventura County, Calif., who introduced the bill. ``Let's face
it. It is an economic-driven activity.''
</P>
<P>
   But both Capriola and Gary Lynn Thomason, the defendant in the
Los Angeles County crush video case, will not be tried under the
new federal law because they were arrested before it passed.
Thomason has pleaded not guilty to misdemeanor charges of animal
cruelty.
</P>
<P>
   Capriola's lawyer, Gianelli, has asked the judge to dismiss the
case against his client on several counts, including lack of
evidence and technicalities related to the search warrant,
according to court records. He said Capriola would not talk about
the case. Capriola could face up to one year in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Alongside the seized tapes, officials said, they found shipping
records to hundreds of individuals. ``If you want to go on a diet,
these videos are the way to go,'' Gross said. ``You'll lose 20
pounds after watching one of these.''

FANCY FOOTWORK FAILS THIEF, POLICE SAY 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The police say Ben-Msyly Gil-Elie was a quick-footed
street criminal with a cosmopolitan touch. He dressed well. He
spoke four languages. He worked the streets of midtown, preying on
Japanese tourists and businessmen in a most unusual way: by
imitating a renowned soccer star while picking their pockets.
</P>
<P>
   Gil-Elie, 29, of Queens, was charged with grand larceny and
attempted grand larceny Monday after the police said they caught
him trying to steal a wallet from a merchant mariner in midtown
Manhattan on Sunday afternoon. Since his arrest, the police said,
he has been identified in lineups as the culprit in four similar
thefts and is a suspect in 10 others.
</P>
<P>
   The police said his method was bizarre and always the same.
Canvassing the streets near midtown hotels, he approached his
victims and flashed a telephone calling card with an image of
Hidetoshi Nakata, a midfielder for a Rome soccer club whose career
is closely followed in his native Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know this player?'' he would ask, and then begin a
series of soccer moves, circling his victims, feinting kicks at
their shins and knees and bumping them as if trying to slip past
them on a soccer field. ``Like he was dribbling a soccer ball,''
said Sgt. James Molloy of the grand larceny unit of the Manhattan
North Precinct.
</P>
<P>
   But when Gil-Elie slipped past his victims, the police said, he
had taken their wallets. He made off with cash and credit cards,
many of which were swiftly run up to their debt limits with illegal
purchases or cash advances, Molloy said.
</P>
<P>
   The police said he was so confident in his technique that he
often merely strutted away.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wouldn't even run,'' Molloy said.
</P>
<P>
   The police had been trying to catch the pickpocket, who became
known as ``the soccer guy'' in the precinct, since his antics were
first reported in October. He was arrested Sunday after Molloy and
Officer Tito Ramos saw him trying the routine and jostling a
Japanese sailor who was in Manhattan on shore leave.
</P>
<P>
   Ramos caught him after he fled from an accomplice's car into a
subway tunnel. Gil-Elie was arraigned Monday on two counts, but his
accomplice remains at large. Other charges were being reviewed.
``He is a suspect in other crimes,'' said Sgt. Andrew McInnis, a
police spokesman, ``and the investigation is ongoing.''

FELONY DRUG CHARGE FILED AGAINST RANGERS' STEVENS
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kevin Stevens of the New York Rangers was charged with a felony
Monday, one day after his arrest at a Collinsville, Ill., motel
with what the police said was crack cocaine in his possession.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, 34, was charged with unlawful possession of a
controlled substance of less than 15 grams, a Class IV felony, in
Madison County Circuit Court in Edwardsville, Ill., a suburb of St.
Louis. Class IV is the lowest felony charge under Illinois law. He
was released on $15,000 bail, and he and his lawyers declined to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   The maximum penalty for a Class IV felony is a jail term of one
to three years, said Maj. Ed Delmore, the assistant chief of the
Collinsville Police Department. It is not unusual, however, for
first-time offenders to receive probation of one to three years, or
to have their record expunged, if they complete a substance abuse
program, Delmore said.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens also met Monday with Dan Cronin, an employee of the
National Hockey League and the NHL Players' Association substance
abuse program. Stevens will begin treatment, said Frank Brown, the
league's vice president of media relations.
</P>
<P>
   According to one hockey official, it will take at least six to
eight weeks for Stevens to complete the program. Stevens must then
complete outpatient treatment, the official said. The regular
season ends on April 9.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens was in St. Louis on Saturday night for the Rangers' game
against the Blues. Afterward, the police said, he and several
teammates, who were not identified, went to a nightclub in Sauget,
Ill. Stevens later took a cab to the Travelodge in Collinsville and
had three to five grams of crack cocaine when he was arrested there
at 7 a.m. Sunday, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Three people arrested with Stevens remained in jail Monday on
$15,000 bail.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   According to two hockey officials, Stevens will enter the second
phase of the substance abuse program run by the league and the
players association.
</P>
<P>
   Several people in the Rangers' organization said privately that
this was a cry for help on Stevens' part.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows the problems he has,'' the team captain Brian Leetch,
who is a close friend of Stevens and his family, said Monday.
``He's been educated about them. When he comes out, he'll be in the
same situation as he was before.''
</P>
<P>
   Neil Smith, the Rangers' president and general manager, said
Monday that he did not know whether Stevens would rejoin the
Rangers once he completed his treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens is scheduled to make $3.2 million this season, the last
of his contract, according to figures provided by the players
association.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Checketts, the Madison Square Garden president, was upset
with the way the Collinsville police handled Stevens' arrest,
citing what he called a sensationalistic news release about the
arrest with the headline, ``Hockey Player Charged With Soliciting
Prostitute and Possession of Drug Paraphernalia; Drug Charges for
Crack Cocaine Possession Are Pending''.

VIVA LA FEMINISTA: WOMEN'S LIVES ARE SLOWLY IMPROVING IN MACHO

 RETRANSMITTING

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Not long ago, the Mexico City government tried to
make a switch. It called for a one-day experiment in which all
married women would exchange jobs with their husbands.
</P>
<P>
   On that day, husbands were asked to clean house, wash dishes, do
laundry and take care of kids.
</P>
<P>
   It's an idea that would have been unthinkable only a few years
ago, when Mexico's middle class was the confirmed center of
masculine privilege.
</P>
<P>
   But things are slowly changing in this homeland  &QL; 
of machismo.
</P>
<P>
   For example, beginning in August, 900 policemen in Mexico City
lost their authority to write traffic tickets. That authority was
given only to policewomen, who were deemed less corruptible by the
city's police chief.
</P>
<P>
   And consider some numbers: 50 percent of the people now
graduating from universities in Mexico are women, and half a dozen
women occupy high-ranking posts in Mexican governments, including
Rosario Robles, the first female mayor of Mexico City _ the biggest
city in the world _ and Rosario Green, Mexico's foreign relations
secretary.
</P>
<P>
   The changes perhaps were best summed up by Monica Almazan, a
policewoman patrolling the Condessa neighborhood: ``Finally, we
have the opportunity to show the men that we can take on a job
which is supposed to be for men only. We now have the chance to
prove ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Is feminism taking root in the hard soil of Mexican culture? The
answer is complicated because it depends on what kind of feminism
you mean. But it is accurate to say that a Mexican women's movement
is emerging on the American model, with women making some gains in
industry and government, while still blocked by institutional and
cultural barriers.
</P>
<P>
   But it's also true that the struggle for women's rights in
Mexico is nearly as old as the country itself. &QL; 
GROWING INDEPENDENCE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It can be seen today in the growing independence of
working-class women along the border, and in a National Women's
Commission that is confronting stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   Or in Mexico's efforts to improve family planning, because
unwanted teenage pregnancies are high and legal abortion is
restricted tightly.
</P>
<P>
   More women are entering legislative bodies and demanding more
laws to ban job discrimination and provide more money and health
care to women in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   And in pop culture, women are flocking to male strip shows that
feature some of the country's biggest soap-opera stars, prompting a
Catholic priest in Guanajuato to admonish on the radio, ``Rush to
confession!''
</P>
<P>
   The events, and the history behind them, defy outside notions of
a nation content with machismo.
</P>
<P>
   Among what loosely might be called the Spanish aristocracy of
Mexico and, in a vastly different way, among its peasants and
working women, Mexico has been a cradle of feminism for the entire
Western Hemisphere. &QL; 
FIRST FEMINIST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Mexicans and feminists everywhere celebrated the 300th
anniversary of the death in 1695 of Sor (Sister) Juana Ines
(EDITORS: ACCENT over ``E'' in InEs) de la Cruz, often acknowledged
as the ``first feminist of the Americas.''
</P>
<P>
   Sor Juana lived from 1651 to 1695 and now is regarded widely as
Mexico's greatest writer, akin to Shakespeare in the
English-speaking world. Her published works include more than 120
sonnets and ballads, many more short poems, three one-act dramas,
two comedies, more than two dozen prologues to plays and numerous
songs, carols and hymns.
</P>
<P>
   Her most popular work, however, is the poem that begins:
``Hombres necios que acusais (EDITORS: ACCENT MARK ove ``A'' in
acusAis) . . .'' _ ``You foolish men who accuse women . . .'' The
poem is memorized by literature students across Latin America
because it strikes at the heart of male attitudes toward women.
</P>
<P>
   But Sor Juana's best defense of women's role is found in a more
obscure work, a response to a bishop who had written a letter
attempting to silence her. (This work and the poem, ``Philosophical
Satire,'' are translated and edited by Electa Arenal and Amanda
Powell in ``The Answer/La Respuesta, Including a Selection of Poems
(by) Sor Juana Inez de la Cruz,'' City University of New York
Press).
</P>
<P>
   Still, Sor Juana was an aristocrat. More commonly, the tough
work for equality was performed by women who were literally in the
trenches, the ``soldaderas'' (soldiers), who included many officers
in their numbers and fought in the revolutionary armies of Pancho
Villa and Emiliano Zapata (their story has been preserved in a book
by Elizabeth Salas, ``Soldaderas: Mitos e Historia.''. Even today,
as soldiers in the largely Mayan independence movement in Chiapas
state, women take up arms, not least for the fact that Indian women
still may be sold into marriage for the equivalent of $400.
</P>
<P>
   Three decades after the revolution, there were women such as
Benita Galeana, a grass-roots leader who led the first squatter
land-takeovers in Mexico City in the Depression years of the 1930s.
She was arrested 60 times and almost lost her eyesight from hunger
strikes while fighting for Mexican women's suffrage, which was
finally won in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let the companera (TILDE OVER ``N'' in compaNera) in the
braids speak,'' was the cry in the 1930s when Benita Galeana would
come to address the crowds in Mexico City. &QL; 
 &QL; 
PRIMER FOR FEMINISTS
</P>
<P>
   In 1940, she wrote her autobiography, ``Benita,'' which became a
primer for the women's movement. Her book and her legacy were
rediscovered in the 1980s, when Mexican women formed a coalition to
fight for democracy and an end to violence against women.
</P>
<P>
   Benita Galeana was able to unite working- and middle-class women
for the first time despite profound philosophical differences
between the two groups concerning the role of men and class in the
struggle. But even she wasn't able to bring the movement to the
point that the Mexican government would identify its own interests
with those of the women's movement. That took nearly three
generations of factory women, the foot soldiers of a blue-collar
cultural insurgency in Tijuana that is slowly spreading from the
border south into the rest of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Prompted by economic crisis, the immigration to the United
States of male heads of household and the demand for female
employees at border factories, these women, like Rosie the Riveter
of World War II America, were the first to break en masse into
Mexico's male-dominated industrial workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Their relative autonomy, accelerated by liberal U.S. social
attitudes and economic benefits that have drifted across the
border, has granted working-class women an unusual degree of
domestic clout and social freedom, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The forces of progress are stirring themselves up much more
along the border,'' said Susan Tiano, a sociology professor at the
University of New Mexico and author of ``Patriarchy on the Line,''
a book on the effect of the ``maquiladoras'' on border gender
roles. ``Some amazing changes happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Women in Tijuana come and go as they please, working night
shifts and shopping at 24-hour supermarkets. Women hit the discos
on weekends, with or without male escorts. Some wear tight pants
and miniskirts. Unmarried mothers are not pariahs.
</P>
<P>
   There are serious social problems for women in the border
workplace. Low pay (the average wage is around 80 cents an hour,
and independent unions are discouraged), sexual harassment and
gender barriers to higher-paying jobs prevent factory women from
raising their status.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies, including a number of U.S.-owned factories and
border-region ``maquiladora'' manufacturing plants, force job
applicants to take pregnancy tests and will hire them only if the
exams are negative. And although women's role in the workforce has
doubled to 30 percent since 1980, female workers still earn 25
percent less than men in the same jobs, says Elena Azaola, a social
anthropologist.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is widely acknowledged that blue-collar women are
creating a new female archetype to reckon with in Mexican society,
and that has been lost neither on the government nor on
middle-class women.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, known by
its Spanish acronym PRI, and its standard-bearer, President Ernesto
Zedillo, taking note of the fact that 70 percent of Mexicans who
are illiterate are women, announced a new social-service program
aimed primarily at women and girls. &QL; 
LEGISLATIVE GAINS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Revolutionary Party, known by its Spanish acronym
PRD, which focused heavily on women's issues in the past
presidential campaign, has been contributing to the rise of women
in Mexico's legislative bodies.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1997 elections, the party doubled its number of female
deputies in the lower house to 30, giving it the largest percentage
of female elected officials of any of the three major parties
represented in the 500-seat Mexican parliament.
</P>
<P>
   All of these changes contributed to the creation of a National
Women's Commission, intended to confront double standards. In 1998,
it launched an American-style advertising campaign questioning
whether society could advance if comments such as these were
allowed to go unchallenged:
</P>
<P>
   ``She is the director. I wonder how she got there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband can do what he wants, because he is a man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are you pregnant? I told you to take care of yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, the campaign offered statements affirming a new
attitude:
</P>
<P>
   ``I am the director, and I did not sleep with anybody to get
here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't need to sleep around to be a man, and I also use
protection.''
</P>
<P>
   Machismo will not make for a smooth adjustment to any changes,
but some see change as inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mexican man idolizes women as `the Mother,' and he will
not tolerate her being contaminated,'' said Alejandro Radchik,
president of the Psychoanalytic Society in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a society where `la casa chica' _ the little house for
the mistress _ is common, not because the husband no longer loves
his wife but because, once she becomes the mother of his children,
sex becomes a dirty act that will contaminate her,'' Radchik said.
</P>
<P>
   `The Mother is her own worst enemy. She is the one educating her
sons, the Mexican men, to be macho and preparing her daughters to
be good mothers and housewives.''
</P>
<P>
   How about the future? Many women believe there is good reason to
hope. With women representing 53 percent of Mexican voters,
presidential candidates campaigning for what is hoped could be the
most competitive democratic election in Mexican history in July,
middle-class women could achieve a measure of political power _
eventually.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, (the Mexican man) will react by trying to belittle
her and by being condescending,'' Radchik said. ``When this
attitude does not lead to his desired effect, he will acquiesce to
this new feminine authority.'' &QL;

FOR FORBES, ORGANIZATION AND MONEY PAY OFF IN IOWA 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to insert quote from Bush spokesman as new 12th graf.)  
(mk) 
 By LESLIE WAYNE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST DES MOINES, Iowa _ After spending more time in Iowa than
any other candidate and digging deeply into his own pockets to
finance his campaign, Steve Forbes' bet on the Iowa caucuses seems
to have paid off.
</P>
<P>
   What a difference four years makes. In 1996, he entered the
state late, had little organization and came in a distant fourth.
This time, learning from that episode, he mounted a lavish
campaign, organized a formidable grass-roots organization and
positioned himself as the champion of the conservative wing of the
Republican party.
</P>
<P>
   ``We broke the political rules,'' Forbes told his supporters
here Monday night. ``The power brokers and the power elite are
worried because they have no hooks in me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not give in,'' he added. ``We will get a political
system that reflects our highest ideals and not our baser
instincts.''
</P>
<P>
   And, though he had plenty of competition for the conservative
vote, Forbes' twin messages _ anti-tax and anti-abortion _ were
strong enough to propel him into a strong second-place showing and
give him the bounce he sought to carry him into New Hampshire for
its primary next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   As the results trickled in, a balloon-festooned room began to
fill up with Forbes supporters wearing the orange T-shirts and blue
baseball caps that the campaign had distributed over the last few
months. Close to 9 p.m., as they heard that the candidate was about
to arrive, many carried little platters bulging with food and
plastic cups of beer and soda from an ample buffet.
</P>
<P>
   Two large television screens beamed the election results down to
the crowd. ``We believe in Steve! We believe in Steve!'' the crowd
chanted as it heard of Forbes' impending arrival.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ecstatic,'' said Keith Appell, a spokesman for the
Forbes organization. ``This has shattered our expectations. Steve
Forbes proved that he's the conservative who can go all the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as voters were going to the caucuses, the Forbes campaign
was broadcasting its television commercials _ a sign of the lavish
spending and attention to detail that has characterized the Forbes
campaign in Iowa. Over the last year, Forbes dipped into his
personal fortune of more than $440 million to spend $25 million of
his own money. That came on top of the $37 million he spent on his
1996 bid.
</P>
<P>
   In the August straw poll, Forbes gained 21 percent of the vote.
He was hoping to get at least that on Monday. But it was unclear,
given the fact that three other candidates were fighting for the
conservative vote, how much beyond that he could get.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Blackwell, Forbes' national chairman, worked the crowd and
crowed: ``We're delighted with this showing. Our goal was to get
over 23 percent. To have 31 to 32 percent is a tremendous
statement. You add up the conservative vote and it's a clear
statement that Bush is out of step with the conservative wing of
the party and, as he is going into New Hampshire, that is not a
nice place to be.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Gov. George W. Bush's
campaign, pointed out that Bush's percentage margin over Forbes
Monday night was slightly more than in his victory in the Iowa
straw poll in August. ``He spent a lot of money and went
backwards,'' Fleischer said of Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' staff attributed his strong showing to his highly
organized and well-financed campaign and his ability to unite
social and economic conservatives behind him.
</P>
<P>
   They said that his showing here made him the only viable
candidate among the four conservatives in the upcoming New
Hampshire primary, where the moderate Republican vote will be
divided between Bush and Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we go into New Hampshire, we won't have the same challenge
as in Iowa,'' said Greg Mueller, the Forbes campaign communications
director. ``In New Hampshire, with our strong No. 2 showing here,
we will be unopposed by any other conservative. We will have a
broad-based neo-Reagan message.''
</P>
<P>
   To shore up his support among conservatives, Forbes continued to
hit hard at the abortion theme in the final days of the campaign,
bringing in Phyllis Schlafly and Rep. Bob Barr of Georgia, both
conservative anti-abortion leaders. He also flooded the airwaves
and filled mailboxes in an anti-abortion advertising blitz.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he kept up his signature anti-tax theme, an attack
that continued to get rousing applause as he crissed-crossed the
state in a two-bus caravan and, later, in a chartered DC-9.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes consistently proposed far more drastic tax cuts than
either Bush or McCain, whom Forbes repeatedly termed the ``timid
twins on taxation'' in his stump speech.
</P>
<P>
   But as persuasive as Forbes' message may have been, his
formidable organization and his seemingly endless campaigning here
were at least as important.
</P>
<P>
   He spent 77 days here, more than any other candidate, Democrat
or Republican. And, dipping into his personal fortune of more than
$440 million, he spent $31 million in 1999 seeking the presidency _
$25 million of his own money and $6 million in donations.
</P>
<P>
   That money helped pay for a grass-roots effort in which no
detail was spared. More than 90,000 Iowa families were identified
as ``Forbes-friendly.'' A formidable databank was created that
tapped into a whole new constituency for Forbes _ conservatives who
had never before participated in a caucus. The Forbes campaign
estimated that between 30 percent and 50 percent of the eligible
voters at Forbes rallies had never voted in caucuses before.
</P>
<P>
   The organization was so sophisticated and high-tech that by the
time people signed cards identifying themselves as Forbes
supporters, that information was put into a computer and the people
were contacted by day's end. On caucus night, Forbes supporters
with e-mail were sent personalized directions to their caucus site
by computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were able to find voters that the pollsters couldn't find
because they were motivated and nontraditional conservatives who
had never really been active before,'' said Steve Grubbs, Forbes'
Iowa campaign chairman. ``And that became a really energized
base.''
</P>
<P>
   The main challenge facing Forbes in Iowa, and one he will not
face in New Hampshire, was that he was forced to fight with three
other candidates _ Gary Bauer, Alan Keyes and Orrin Hatch _ for
conservative voters, while Bush _ once such candidates as Elizabeth
Dole and Dan Quayle dropped out of the race _ had the entire
moderate field to himself.
</P>
<P>
   To counter this, Forbes outcampaigned and outspent his
conservative rivals, while continuing to take positions that moved
him further and further to the right.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, where there are fewer social conservatives,
more economic conservatives and a greater propensity for contrarian
views, the Forbes strategy may shift somewhat, campaign officials
said..
</P>
<P>
   Forbes will present himself as the only conservative choice and
will make special efforts to focus on other groups, like gun
owners, while hitting hard on the tax issue. Already, one of that
state's leading anti-tax groups, the Granite State Taxpayers, has
endorsed Forbes and is working on his behalf. In addition, Forbes'
endorsement by the state's leading newspaper, The Manchester
Union-Leader, which has a conservative philosophy, is also seen as
a boost.

 By ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.2000 Special for The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule reviews of new books:
</P>
<P>
   ``A VAST CONSPIRACY'' &QL; 
By Jeffrey Toobin (Random House, $25.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Toobin's last book was about the O.J. Simpson trial. We've had a
hard time deciding whether he has come up in the world or plunged
to new depths by taking on this more recent tangle of thorns, the
Clinton sex scandal. In the end, of course, he has traded up _
there was no blood shed in the White House, merely a shedding of
judgment and esteem and familial accord. We spoke with Toobin after
the Simpson book was released, and he told us that as a lawyer he
was both horrified and fascinated by the trial, like a passing
motorist gaping at a terrible accident. This time, Toobin has
jumped out of his vehicle and is selling tickets, tour guide
extraordinaire. He covered the Clinton saga for ``The New Yorker,''
and he offers all the details, including Paula Jones' relentlessly
explicit descriptions of Clinton's flawed anatomy. And, of course,
we knew as we read it that we, like Toobin, were no longer just
driving by. We became part of the ghoulish scene. &QL; 
``AMERICAN FAN'' &QL; 
By Dennis Perrin (Spike, $23) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   errin offends just about everybody in this look at sports in
America, and it's great fun watching him do it. Christians take a
beating in the section about ``religious'' athletes. Radio
talk-show hosts are taken to task for being ``White, male,
heavyset, obsessive, egomaniacal, brusque,'' and only once removed
from the people who call them. Shaquille O'Neal, Nike and college
basketball coaches (with ``Nike bucks stuffed in their G-strings'')
come under scrutiny in a chapter on sports marketing. Even Mark
McGwire and Sammy Sosa suffer under Perrin's analysis of the home
run race, during which ``Big Mac was the All-American boy . . .
(and) Sosa the Dominican was made his comic sidekick: less Sancho
Panza (McGwire was no wayward Quixote), more a smiling Tonto to
McGwire's Lone Ranger.'' Women are left out altogether, and we
should be grateful. ``I deal almost exclusively with male sports
and male fans,'' Perrin writes, ``for the simple reason that this
is where the true lunacy lies.'' &QL; 
``THE COMFORTS OF HOME'' &QL; 
By Merritt Ierley (Potter, $30) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1799, the family of a Philadelphia woman named Elizabeth
Drinker purchased a ``shower bath'' _ a framework holding a
container of water that would fall on a bather's head when she
pulled a cord. It was an odd luxury. ``I bore it better than I
expected,'' Elizabeth wrote in her diary, ``not having been wett
(SIC, CORRECT) all over att (SIC, CORRECT) once for twenty-eight
years past.'' When Thomas Jefferson moved into the White House in
1801, there was only a privy out back. Jefferson, who had witnessed
innovations in modern convenience in France, requested that a water
closet be installed (it was, but not until 1804, leaving Jefferson
to suffer in the privy for three long years). Ierley charts the
evolution of comfort and convenience in the American home,
beginning with the turn of the 19th century; jumping to 1860,
before the mass-production spurred by the Civil War; and ending
with 1920s to the present, with America on the cutting edge of
household convenience. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``JAMES JOYCE'' &QL; 
By Edna O'Brien (Viking, $19.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of all its great writers, James Joyce's relationship with
Ireland is the most contradictory. ``He determined to reinvent the
city where he had been marginalized, laughed at and barred from
literary circles,'' O'Brien writes. ``He would be the poet of his
race. In one of his early verses he likened himself to a stag,
antlers charging upon the land.'' That sets the tone for this
wonderful volume from the ``Penguin Lives'' series of short
biographies. O'Brien reveals Joyce's tumultuous ties to his mother,
who bore 16 children, and to the Catholic Church; his sexual
appetite for Nora Barnacle, the common girl from Galway who would
be his wife (and who would never read beyond the first pages of
Ulysses; his attractions to other women; his struggle to find
acceptance for his work; and his self-absorption and eccentricity.
``He was a tragic man with a staggering genius for whom humor was a
weapon,'' O'Brien says. Or, as another writer put it, he was ``a
Dante who had lost the key to his own inferno.'' &QL;

ABC NETWORK CHIEF NAMED NO. 2 AT DISNEY

<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Michael Eisner, chairman of Walt Disney Co., on
Monday named Robert A. Iger, the ABC network chief, as his
second-in-command in a restructuring of Disney's top management.
</P>
<P>
   In appointing Iger as president and chief operating officer,
Eisner sent a clear signal that he viewed the 48-year-old chairman
of the Disney-owned ABC Group as a potential heir to run the Disney
empire.
</P>
<P>
   The succession issue at Disney has bothered Wall Street and
shareholders since Eisner's heart surgery in 1994 and the death of
his longtime No. 2, Frank Wells, in a helicopter crash the same
year. Eisner sought to replace him with Michael Ovitz, but the
former agent was dismissed after 16 months in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Since then Disney has seen an exodus of potential heirs,
including the former chief financial officers, Stephen Bollenbach
and Richard Nanula; former ABC executives Geraldine Laybourne and
Steve Burke, and Joe Roth, former chairman of Disney studios, who
left last month.
</P>
<P>
   Eisner, who promoted several other Disney executives on Monday,
made it evident that the new job was a test for Iger. ``This is the
first step in shuffling the chairs at court,'' said Christopher
Dixon, an entertainment analyst at Paine Webber. ``The challenge
for Bob is to demonstrate that he can manage the very strong
individual unit heads and implement the strategy of the board and
Michael Eisner.''
</P>
<P>
   Eisner's decision to name Iger, a silken, charming and
well-liked executive, who also served as president of Walt Disney
International, came after a troubled year of executive defections
at Disney and stagnant stock prices. The company has been beset by
slumping home video earnings, declines in licensing and
merchandising and a drop-off in store sales.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday Disney posted some positive financial news. With
strong performances from its theme parks, broadcasting and cable
operations _ including the No. 1 television show in the nation,
``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' and the hit sequel film ``Toy
Story 2'' _ Disney posted a 9 percent rise in fiscal first quarter
profits. This excluded the company's Go.com Internet business,
which is expected to post a loss. Revenue rose 5 percent to $6.8
billion. Operating income increased 8 percent to $1.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's stock fell 31.25 cents, to $32.125, on The New York
Stock Exchange, but jumped in after-hours trading. The
announcements came after trading ended.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the succession issue, Eisner, who is 57, said in an
interview that the appointment of Iger ``was not about that at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Eisner said, ``I guess the media may make something out of it,
but my view is we needed a president and chief operating officer
and that job should be on the board of directors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody in America is better trained for this job than Bob,''
said Eisner. He said Iger would serve as his ``partner'' at Disney,
and that the two men had been discussing the new job for about two
years. He said Iger had played a central role in the integration of
ABC into the Disney organization, following Disney's $19 billion
merger with Cap Cities, which owned ABC.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Eisner said, ``it became apparent that I
needed Bob.'' He said, ``ABC was strong, we had consolidated the
Disney studio and ABC. ABC was strong in management and
performance, and selfishly I wanted Bob at that point.''
</P>
<P>
   Eisner also announced the promotion of Disney's chief strategic
officer, Peter Murphy, and chief financial officer, Thomas O.
Staggs, to senior vice presidents. They will become members of a
new executive committee that will include Eisner, Iger, Disney vice
chairman Stanford M. Litvack and heads of individual business
units.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new corporate structure, Murphy will report to Eisner
and Iger. But vice chairman Roy E. Disney, Litvack and Staggs will
report to Eisner.
</P>
<P>
   Iger, asked about the challenges he faces, declined to discuss
too many specifics about the new job. ``I'd be wrong to say it
wasn't a big challenge,'' he said. ``But I can't point to any one
specific direction. There are ongoing challenges, but I don't view
this as daunting.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Eisner said that Disney's involvement with digital
technology was certainly a factor in Iger's appointment. ``We have
to define where we'll be in the Digital Age,'' said Eisner. ``As
far as strategy and maintenance of what we have, Bob will be the
key planner in this.''
</P>
<P>
   Eisner, who also spoke to financial analysts on Monday,
cautioned them that he maintains ``conservative'' expectations for
the year. But he added, ``It's nice to start 2000 on a positive
note.'' Disney's strong profits were paced, in part, by the ABC and
ESPN-TV divisions that Iger had overseen.
</P>
<P>
   Eisner also sought to end speculation that Disney may merge with
an Internet company. ``I don't feel the need for anything but being
independent,'' said Eisner. ``We are big enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Financial analysts said Monday evening that the Iger appointment
was a positive one for Disney, but that Eisner's aggressive
personality and his seeming reluctance to yield too much power
makes the No. 2 position difficult. But strengthening management at
Disney was crucial, the analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dynamic world of media and online opportunities is
changing so rapidly that Disney needs to have a stronger senior
management footprint to capitalize on these changes,'' observed
Jill Krutick, an entertainment analyst at Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Krutick said, ``Being president doesn't mean Iger's the
definite successor.'' She added: ``He certainly looks as if he has
a much better shot. But everyone's being constantly tested and
performance is what counts.''

   voters on how to spend the state's tobacco settlement money.
</P>
<P>
   Key lawmakers say it's not that they don't want to decide how to
spend the $3.1 billion; it's that they're afraid any decision they
make will be irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   That's because two initiatives are headed for the November
ballot that, if passed, would nullify anything the Legislature
might do.
</P>
<P>
   But lawmakers are still a long way from agreeing on a plan. The
debate promises to be one of the biggest fights of the session,
along with growth controls and taxes for a new football stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It starts this week, as Gov. Jane Hull, House Speaker Jeff
Groscost and Senate President Brenda Burns begin serious
discussions. Groscost said he's nearly ready to unveil his plan
that he wants to go directly to the ballot, and Burns and Hull have
their own ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a contentious issue. Everybody has an idea
how it should be spent,'' Groscost said. ``I don't have any desire
to shed the blood, sweat and tears on our floor for a proposal that
in the end is irrelevant.''
</P>
<P>
   Groscost wants to spend the money in three areas: tobacco use
prevention, especially among kids; public health; and some benefit
to taxpayers, such as a tax cut or college scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker said he prefers the scholarship program to tax cuts.
Michigan has devoted $86 million of its settlement to scholarships,
while Nevada will spend 40 percent of its money on a similar
program. Children would have to meet specific academic standards
and agree not to use tobacco _ and illegal substances _ to qualify.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where that tax cut might filter back to me as two or three
dollars a year . . . by the time the average household has a child
go to college. . . . You could see a benefit that's sizable to the
taxpayers at a point when they could actually use it,'' Groscost
said.
</P>
<P>
   Scholarships would be an easy sell with voters, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Burns, however, wants to put most of the money in a trust fund,
as Kansas, Louisiana and Minnesota have done. The money, except for
about $175 million in upfront cash, would be protected in the fund,
meaning only the interest would be spent.
</P>
<P>
   Burns, R-Glendale, and Hull have been reluctant to take the
matter to voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I prefer a legislative solution,'' Burns told GOP colleagues
in a meeting last week. But she said she's still willing to
consider putting the issue on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Her biggest concern is the rush to spend money that's not there.
The state will receive the money over 25 years, and there's no
guarantee that all of the money will arrive.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is writing us a check for $3.1 billion,'' she said.
Burns would like to spend some of the money on health care for the
elderly and medical research.
</P>
<P>
   Hull, meanwhile, said she wants all of the money spent on health
needs.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, she supports funding for a new state health lab,
rural and community health care and behavioral health care. She
also wants to add health coverage for the state's uninsured and put
some money in a trust fund.
</P>
<P>
   She does not support Groscost's scholarship proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor's preference still is to direct it to health
care,'' said Debi Wells, Hull's health adviser. ``But you can't
ignore the fact the door has been opened to education.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells said Hull wants a comprehensive solution that could head
off one or both of the initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, called the Healthy Arizona Initiative 2, would
fully fund a law passed by voters in 1996 to pay for preventative
health-care programs for children and add health-care coverage for
the uninsured and working poor. &QL;
