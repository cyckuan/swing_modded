<HEADLINE> 30 Rioters Taken to Tanzanian Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Thirty people who have
participated in a riot were taken to court in Tanzanian capital
Dar es Salaam Monday charged with unlawful assembly and procession
and malicious damage to property.
</P>
<P>
The accused include an Imam of the Manyema Mosque, Juma Mbukuzi
Salum, and 29 Moslem followers. They were arraigned before the
Kisutu Resident Magistrate's Court.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration in which the people were taking part last
Friday developed into a riot in areas close to the mosque.
</P>
<P>
Rioters threw stones, bottles and iron pieces at the police
while policemen fired tear gas and used pistols, dogs and horses
to disperse the mob.
</P>
<P>
The police held 96 rioters, but have released most of them in
the past two days as their role in the demonstration was minimal.
</P>
<P>
At the court, the accused denied the charges and were remanded
in custody until August 16.
</P>
<P>
Prosecution led by Assistant Commissioner of Police, Leonard
Mashaka, objected to bailing the accused on the grounds that the
situation at the scene of the event is still tense and that they
should remain in custody for social security according to the
Criminal Procedure Act of 1985.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Tanzanian Minister of Education and Culture Juma
Kapuya tabled a move before the National Assembly, seeking the
right for Moslem girls to wear hijab, or Moslem head scarf, in
common schools and attend Friday prayers.
</P>
<P>
Kapuya, a Moslem himself, later withdrew the move amid concerns
of the majority of members of parliament, who claimed that
Tanzania is a secular country in which students in common schools
are supposed to wear school uniforms when attending classes.
</P>
<P>
Kapuya's change of position has caused wide protests from
Moslems and they organized a demonstration that resulted in the
riot Friday.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Vice-President Omar Ali Juma, has urged people to
maintain peace and security in the country and guard against those
who use religious forums to fulfil their ill intentions.

EINDHOVEN, Netherlands, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The Club of Table
Tennis Professionals (CTTP), which served as a union for table tennis
players, has been disorganized, CTTP Management Committee announced
here on Monday.
</P>
<P>

<P>
The table tennis ruling body ITTF had imposed a ban on
speed-and-spin enhancing glues but later gave in while facing strong
opposition from CTTP and table tennis manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
World-class table tennis players including Andrzej Grubba of
Poland, Steffen Fetzner of Germany, Jean-Michel Saive of Belgium.
Jean-Philippe Gatien of France and Jorgen Persson of Sweden had

<HEADLINE> Asian Recovery Helps Banking Giant HSBC Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 2 (Xinhua) -- A recovery in the Far East economy
and a strong performance in the west saw HSBC record a 10 percent
rise in pre-tax profits for the six months to June.
</P>
<P>
The 10 percent jump in pre-tax profits for the six months to
over 4 billion U.S. dollars was also aided by the group's UK
buiness, formerly known as Midland Bank, which it said "continued
to perform strongly."
</P>
<P>
According to HSBC's Interim Report released Monday, the pre-tax
profits from the business were ahead 12 percent to 1.45 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
John Bond, HSBC Holdings chairman, said, "For the first time in
our history, operating profits before provisions approached 5
billion U.S. dollars for a six month period."
</P>
<P>
The group was now looking to expand in the U.S. and Thailand,
although "nothing firm is on the table" at the moment, Bond said.
</P>
<P>
Economists in the City believe that the group is looking at a
range of possibilities around the world and likely to come to the
markets at some point in the second half.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 2 (Xinhua) --The rival groups within the rebel
Congolese Rally for Democracy (CRD) have said they welcome the
signing by the rebel Movement for the Liberation for Congo (MLC)
of the Lusaka cease-fire agreement.
</P>
<P>
Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation Monday quoted CRD
leader Emile Illunga as saying that although the signing came as a
surprise, it is in line with the peace plan initiated by Zambian
President Frederick Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
Another CRD group leader Ernest Wamba Dia Wamba said that he
appreciated the signing of the agreement by MLC leader Jean-Pierre
Bemba here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The six warring countries involved in the 11-month war in
Democratic Republic of Congo signed the cease-fire agreement in
Zambian capital Lusaka on July 10 this year.
</P>
<P>
The CRD and the MLC did not sign the agreement because of the
disagreement within CRD over who would on behalf of the CRD sign
the agreement.
</P>
<P>
CRD split into two factions in May this year -- one led by
Emile Illunga and the other by Ernest Wamba Dia Wamba.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources said that the CRD rebels are expected to
sign the cease-fire agreement before August 7.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Palestinians Work to Seek Reconciliation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Ahead of the final status talks
with Israel on thorny issues, the Palestinians were exerting
efforts to seek ways of healing rifts and reaching national
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat led a delegation of
his Fatah movement to a meeting in Cairo with that of the radical
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), headed by
Abu Ali Moustafa, PFLP's deputy leader.
</P>
<P>
This was the first meeting between the two most powerful groups
in the Palestine Liberation Organizaton (PLO) since it signed the
Oslo accord with Israel in 1993. Fatah is the major faction to
support the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks while the PFLP is
opposed to the peace agreements signed between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the two sides were upbeat after seven hours
of meeting, which they described as a success. Salim al-Zanoun, a
senior Fatah leader and speaker of the Palestine National Council,
said the successful talks will encourage other Palestinian
factions to join the dialog aimed at reaching national
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Qureia, also known as Abu Ala, a member of the Fatah
Central Committee and speaker of the Palestinian Legislative
Council, said the national reconciliation dialog is important for
the Palestinian people approaching the final status talks with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Moustafa said the two sides "are on the right path." In spite
of the differences over the Palestinian-Israeli talks between his
group and Fatah, they would work together to reinvigorate PLO's
role, he said.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed opposition to the Oslo accord but said the PFLP
would be "in front of the political reality and look to the
future."
</P>
<P>
The two groups have agreed to hold talks again in a number of
weeks and decided to form a committee comprising of two members
from each side to put forward proposals for reactivating PLO's
role and realizing national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the Fatah-PFLP meeting, Arafat chaired in Cairo on
Saturday a meeting of the Central Committee of Fatah, which
included three top members who are opposed to the Oslo accord.
</P>
<P>
The three are Director of the PLO Political Department Farouk
Qaddoumi, Fatah military leader Mohammed Jihad and Mohammed
Ghoneim, in charge of the movement's organization. Arafat called
the meeting to facilitate their attendance in a bid to bridge
the gap inside the movement.
</P>
<P>
It is essential to work out a unified stance at this critical
phase before the final status talks with Israel, Faisal Husseini,
Palestinian minister for the Jerusalem affairs said after the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Fatah Central Committee insisted that all the signed
agreements be implemented before the negotiations for a final
peace deal, Husseini said.

<HEADLINE> Most of Zambia's Privatized Assets Bought by </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The majority of participants in
the Zambian privatization program are locals who have purchased
small- and medium-size state-owned assets covering the entire
spectrum of the economy.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest issue of Privatization News available
here Monday, out of more than 249 companies and units privatized
by the Zambia Privatization Agency, 65 percent have been bought by
Zambian citizens while the remaining 35 percent have gone to
foreign investors who bought mostly larger companies.
</P>
<P>
And of the few outsiders who have participated in the program,
50 percent of them were minority share-holders who had rights of
preemption over government share-holding and this was outside the
control of the privatization agency, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The majority of employees in privatized companies will always
be locals because they work happily in their countries, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Local participation in the economy should not only be seen in
the context of Zambians buying companies offered by the
privatization agency and shares floated through its efforts, but
also in the ability of locals setting up their own companies and
purchasing shares from any other private firm listed on the stock
market, it said.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, all efforts must be put in initiatives that will
help Zambians to reconstruct the country's economy, said the
report.

<HEADLINE> NATO to Replace Its Troops in Albania by September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) will send new troops by September to replace
its forces currently stationed in Albania called the AFOR, or the
majority of them, an AFOR press officer here said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Most of the AFOR are expected to leave Albania on September 1
as their "humanitarian mission" is closing, said Lt. Col. Helge
Eriksen.
</P>
<P>
The details of the mission of new NATO forces and its commander
have not been clearly decided by the North Atlantic Council so
far, but the council has decided that NATO will remain in Albania,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The NATO officer from Norway disclosed that the new NATO forces
are likely to be called AFOR II, and the number of the forces
could be around 2,000.
</P>
<P>
Part of the new NATO forces' mission is likely to provide
logistic support to NATO forces in Kosovo (KFOR) and engage in
some infrastructure construction work in Albania, Eriksen said.
</P>
<P>
The new forces will include troops from all the NATO members
and part of the AFOR, and the commander might come from Italy, he
added.
</P>
<P>
According to the Albanian Telegraphic Agency, the North
Atlantic Council decided at the Sarajevo summit Friday that NATO
troops will continue to stay in Albania.
</P>
<P>
The AFOR's mission in Albania may trace back to mid-April when
a group of 270 French troops arrived in the Albanian port of
Durres on April 12 during the Kosovo crisis. The number of troops
once reached over 7,000 in Albania.

CAIRO, August 2 (Xinhua) -- An Egyptian man who claimed to be a
soul healer beat a sick woman to death in a bid to exorcise her
demons, police said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Fatin Mohammed el-Seyed, 40, died Sunday in a village outside
Cairo after she was thrashed by Hamid Mahmoud Mohammed with a
thick bamboo stick, a police officer said.
</P>
<P>
Police have arrested both Mohammed and el-Seyed's husband, a
hotel worker, who took el-Seyed to the so-called healer, the
officer was quoted by the country's Middle East News Agency as
saying.
</P>
<P>
El-Seyed, the mother of a 12-year-old boy, had been suffering
from an unknown ailment, the policeman said. Mohammed told the
husband that el-Seyed was haunted by evil spirits which needed to
be exorcised.
</P>
<P>
Police said Mohammed beat her for 15 minutes and said she would
be fine after four "demons" had left her body. But when the
husband tried to talk to el-Seyed, he found she had become
motionless.
</P>
<P>
A coroner found she had died of a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
Beating as a form of exorcism is common in Egypt among peasants
and low-income people who often believe that certain ailments stem
from the devil having penetrated the body.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
Monday opened Blast Furnace No. 4 of the Zimbabwe Iron and Steel
Company (ZISCO) in Kwekwe of central Zimbabwe, expressing his
gratitude to the Chinese government for all the support it has
given over the project.
</P>
<P>
The president said that the Chinese government and China
Shougang (Capital) Corporation have been very supportive in the
rehabilitation program of the Zimbabwean iron and steel company.
</P>
<P>
"The completion of the rehabilitation of Blast Furnace No. 4 is
a key element in the modernization of the entire production
process at ZISCO," said Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
"In terms of production, I am informed that the capacity of
Blast Furnace No. 4 will satisfy the market demand for long
products of Zimbabwe and the whole Common Market for East and
Southern Africa (COMESA) region," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This will be a very positive development since these markets
have been experiencing insufficient supplies of billets and other
finished products," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that "70 percent of output will be exported, mainly as
billets to overseas markets, earning the country much in foreign
currency."
</P>
<P>
He said for the ZISCO, 1999 is the year in which the company is
expected to make a U-turn from a loss making to a profit making
company.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony, Chinese Ambassador to Harare Huang
Guifang said the Chinese government provided 35 million U.S.
dollars for the project.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said that the ZISCO is one of the largest
parastatal of Zimbabwe, which plays a very important role in the
economic development of the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
"The giant parastatal was facing tremendous difficulties after
its lifeline -- Blast Furnace No. 4 collapsed in 1993. With a
close cooperation between China and Zimbabwe, the rehabilitation
of the blast furnace was brought to a reality," he said.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the ZISCO will be reincarnated along with the
reopening of blast furnace No. 4 and make more contributions to
the prosperity of Zimbabwe's economy.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Non-Oil Exports Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Iran's non-oil exports scored a 33
percent increase in the first four months of the country's
calendar year (starting March 21) over the same period of last
year, said a customs official on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The total value of non-oil exports during the period amounted
to 1,813 billion rials (about 1.055 billion U.S. dollars), said
Mehdi Karbasian, head of the Customs Administration.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he said that Iran's imports in the same
period stood at 5.9 million tons, valued at 7,653 billion rials
(about 4.361 billion dollars), up by 13 and 16 percent in terms
of weight and value respectively from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
He said that the imports included tools and machinery, iron
ware, cooking oil, electric equipment, chemicals, sugar and raw
material, which made up 52.1 percent of the total imports volume.
</P>
<P>
"The non-oil goods with the highest export value were
chemicals, worth 110 million dollars, pistachios, 128 million
dollars, and rugs, 63 million dollars," he said, quoted by the
official Islamic Republic News Agency.
</P>
<P>
He said border trade and carry-on luggage trade are now
contributing to the increase in non-oil exports, a sector which
draws more and more attention as the country tries to diversify
exports other than oil, its economic mainstay.
</P>
<P>
In the Iranian month of Tir (June 22 to July 22) alone,
the country generated 8.7 million dollars through border trade
exports and 7.9 million dollars through carry-on luggage trade,
said the official.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Some 1,000 pairs of anti-retina
burnt glasses with defects were found in Belgium by Monday,
arousing scare among local health authorities.
</P>
<P>
The solar eclipse-oriented glasses, together with another 2,000
pairs now for sale in local shops, were found to be defective
after being imported from Colombia.
</P>
<P>
Local health authorities appealed to the buyers of the
defective glasses to denounce their purchases and not to use them
on August 11 while witnessing the solar eclipse.
</P>
<P>
Looking into the solar eclipse without protective glasses or
with defective glasses can cause serious eye problems such as
retina burnts that may be a lasting damage, eye specialists
warned.
</P>
<P>
Sales of solar eclipse glasses picked up a week ago when local
people started to prepare for the coming solar eclipse on August
11.
</P>
<P>
Solar eclipse watchers were suggested to go to the south of the
country, especially to a town known as Virton to have a better
view of the rare phenomenon that takes place at an interval of an
average of 370 years.
</P>
<P>
A solar eclipse happens when the moon travels right in between
the sun and the earth, blocking the view of the sun from the
earth.
</P>
<P>
The August 11 solar eclipse is estimated to be visible in whole
or in part to around 2 billion residents of this planet.

<HEADLINE> No Rush for Resolving Kalapani Issue: Indian Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 2 (Xinhua) -- India is confident that the
Kalapani territorial dispute will be resolved, but it is premature
to solve it right now, said the Indian Ambassador to Nepal Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a face-to-face talk with journalists, K.V. Rajan
said that he is confident that the Kalapani issue will be properly
resolved, but it needs time.
</P>
<P>
He said India is ready to listen to Nepal's arguments about the
Kalapani issue and will respect Nepal's stand on it.
</P>
<P>
Joint studies about whether the disputed area belongs to India
or Nepal is going on, said the ambassador.
</P>
<P>
Both India and Nepal lay claim to the Kalapani area in
far-western Nepal which is now occupied by Indian troops.
</P>
<P>
The overall relationship between India and Nepal is friendly
and there are no basic differences between the two countries,
added the ambassador, citing recent positive development on
transit treaty as an example.
</P>
<P>
As for Bhutanese refugees, the ambassador insisted that it is a
bilateral issue between Bhutan and Nepal and India will stick to a
non-involvement policy on this issue.
</P>
<P>
He said that India is not ready to mediate the issue of
Bhutanese refugees.
</P>
<P>
"If India wants to help, what will we do about it?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
More than 100,000 Bhutan refugees are now living in eastern
Nepal after they were forced to flee Bhutan around 1990. Seven
rounds of talks on repatriation between the two Himalayan kingdoms
have so far ended in failure.
</P>
<P>
Nepal sought India's help in resolving the refugee issue, but
India, which handles Bhutan's foreign affairs, refused to be
involved in the matter.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Central Bank Warns Fake Notes in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Zambia has warned the
public to be aware of the counterfeit kwacha notes in circulation
when transacting in bank notes.
</P>
<P>
The notes which were most used to the fraud were the 500
kwacha, 5000 kwacha and 10,000 kwacha denominations, public
relations manager of the central bank, Kabinga Pande told Xinhua
Monday at the just ended 73rd Zambia Agricultural and Commercial
Show in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
But the bank official said that he was not so sure whether the
reproduction was being done locally or internationally.
</P>
<P>
A huge amount of the fake notes had been confiscated
nationwide, he added.
</P>
<P>
Pande noted that the amount of the fake notes the central bank
had recorded was incomparable to the total notes in circulation.
</P>
<P>
"We are working hand in hand with security agents to get to the
bottom of this scam. Though none has been charged for printing
false money, one or two people have been charged for transacting
counterfeit notes," he added.
</P>
<P>
Viewed under ultra-violet light, the watermark of a fish
eagle's head and the national court of arms is visible on the
genuine kwacha notes, he noted.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Factions Pledge to Work for National </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Two Palestinian groups on Monday
underlined the need for joint efforts to reach a national
reconciliation for recovering the legitimate rights of the
Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
The Fatah movement, led by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat,
and the radical Damascus-based Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine (PFLP) held talks on Sunday in Cairo on ways of healing
rifts and mending fences. A joint communique was issued on Monday
on the talks.
</P>
<P>
In the communique, the two groups emphasized the necessity to
hold dialog among all Palestinian forces to augment national
reconciliation and unity.
</P>
<P>
Fatah is the major faction to support the Palestinian-Israeli
peace talks while PFLP and several other factions are opposed to
the peace agreements signed between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The two groups called for means to put an end to the Israeli
occupation of the Palestinian land and eliminate the Jewish
settlements on the occupied Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
Fatah and PFLP reiterated their commitment to the basis of the
Palestinian national principle, foremost of which is the refugees'
right to return to their homeland and the establishment of an
independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
The two sides underlined the importance of reactivating the
role of the Palestine Liberation Organization, the sole legitimate
representative of the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
The two groups have agreed to continue dialog and form a
committee to follow up what has been agreed on in the talks and
work out executive mechanisms, according to the communique.
</P>
<P>
Fatah and PFLP have decided to set up a committee comprising of
two members from each side to make a list of proposals for
reinvigorating PLO's role and reaching national reconciliation.

<HEADLINE> Stepashin Insists on Aid to All Victims in Balkan War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Sergei
Stepashin said Monday that international organizations should
extend support to everyone whose life was affected by the NATO
military action in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
"Exempting any country from this process would obstruct the
talks," Stepashin said at a meeting with Montenegrin President
Milo Djukanovic, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"Human rights must be protected, but there are other methods
besides bombings," Stepashin said, referring to NATO's 78-day air
campaign against Yugoslavia that destroyed much of the Balkan
country's infrastructure, besides military installations.
</P>
<P>
The international community has acknowledged that the
consistent stand of Russia and President Boris Yeltsin contributed
to the halting of the bloodshed in the Balkans, Stepashin said.
</P>
<P>
Djukanovic, before his departure late Monday, said he was
"firmly convinced that Moscow understands our position and
supports our efforts for building a democratic and economically
open society."
</P>
<P>
"The issue of possible secession from the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia was not discussed" during the visit, Djukanovic said.
</P>
<P>
"Montenegro is not pursuing this goal," he said. However, the
republic "would have to consider its future" within the Federation
if "Serbia ignores our call for the deepening of democratic and
market processes in the Yugoslav Federation," Interfax quoted
Djukanovic as saying.
</P>
<P>
On the situation in Kosovo, Djukanovic said the international
peacekeepers there are unable to protect non-Albanians from
Albanian terrorists. "The Balkans settlement will become much more
difficult if ethnic cleansing is tolerated" (in Kosovo), he said.
</P>
<P>
Djukanovic was here as a guest of Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov. He also met with Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov Monday.

<HEADLINE> More Russians Suffer Mental Disorders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Four million Russians are
registered at outpatient clinics as suffering from mental
disorders, the Interfax news agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
"In the last decade, the number of people suffering from mental
disorders has more than trebled," Interfax quoted the country's
human rights commissioner Oleg Mironov as saying.
</P>
<P>
The rising incidence of mental illness is attributed to "the
unfavorable social and economic situation in the country, social
insecurity, unemployment, ethnic conflict, forced internal and
external migration, and other factors that produce a condition of
stress."
</P>
<P>
In addition, 4.5 percent of Russia's children suffer from
mental disorders, Interfax said, quoting Mironov's press service.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner also accused military recruiters of "wanton
practice of meeting military draft targets at any cost" by getting
"people with clear symptoms of mental disorders" into the
military.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Not to Quit Southern African Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe will not pull out of the
Southern African Development Community (SADC), a Zimbabwean
diplomat said in Nairobi Monday.
</P>
<P>
Shame Tarumbiswa, counsellor of the commerce section at the
Zimbabwean High Commission in Kenya, told Xinhua that he saw no
reason of withdrawing from the regional community.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe has duly paid its membership fee to the regional
organization, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Nairobi-based East African weekly Monday predicted that the
SADC could soon be watching Zimbabwe abandon it for the Common
Market for East and Southern Africa (COMESA).
</P>
<P>
The report attributed a possible withdrawal of Zimbabwe from
the SADC to the massive trade imbalance in favor of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Tarumbiswa said that Zimbabwe's deficit in its trade with South
Africa is significant, particularly in textiles.
</P>
<P>
However, Zimbabwe would not pull out of the SADC because of the
 dominance of South African economy in the region, he noted,
joking that "where can we go, to the lion's mouth?"
</P>
<P>
He noted that Zimbabwe, also a member of the COMESA, looks at
the SADC as "a stepping stone" toward the COMESA.
</P>
<P>
Integration is a process, he said, citing that the three
countries of the East African Cooperation, Kenya, Tanzania and
Uganda, are moving toward a East African Community. All of the
three countries are COMESA members.
</P>
<P>
The SADC and the COMESA are harmonizing in their policies and
programs so as to achieve an African Economic Community sooner,
said Tarumbiswa.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the report that Tanzania was considering quitting
the COMESA and remaining a SADC member, the commerce official said
he doubted that Tanzania would really do that as integration is
the common aspiration of the African countries.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania participated actively in the COMESA meetings in
Nairobi in mid- May this year, Tarumbiswa said.
</P>
<P>
The report said that "the two groups are intended to become
customs unions and it is a technical impossibility for one state
to belong to two different customs unions because goods imported
without duty from one union can then be exported without duty to
the other."
</P>
<P>
Tarumbiswa pointed out that there would be safeguards
addressing he issue. That's why the rules of origin has been
discussed in the integration process.
</P>
<P>
The SADC is aiming to achieve a free trade area on January 1,
2000 while the COMESA has been counting down on achieving a free
trade area by October 31, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Ten members of the 14-member SADC, including Zimbabwe, Tanzania
and Namibia, are also members of the 21-member COMESA.
</P>
<P>
Quitting the COMESA is not unprecedented. Mozambique and
Lesotho left in 1997.
</P>
<P>
But it is believed that Mozambique is to return to the COMESA,
possibly at the next COMESA summit in Mauritius.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique had allegedly pulled out of the COMESA because its
parliament did not agree to pay membership fees to both the SADC
and the COMESA.

<HEADLINE> USAID Provides $300M to Angola in Past 4 Years </HEADLINE>

<P>
LUANDA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. International Development
Agency (USAID) has provided Angola with more than 300 million U.S.
dollars in humanitarian aid over the past four years, an official
of the organization said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
William Garvelink, an official with the Department of
Assistance for Catastrophy of the USAID, said he kept consulting
government officials, institutions of the United Nations and
non-government organizations on the establishment of a mechanism
for offering humanitarian aid to the people living in the areas
controlled by UNITA rebels.
</P>
<P>
The humanitarian situation in Angola has seriously deteriorated
after a full-scale war renewed between the government troops and

rebels led by Jonas Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official noted that the USAID officials will meet with

<HEADLINE> S. African Shares End Weaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 2 (Xinhua) -- South African shares ended
weaker Monday, but off their worst levels despite the underlying
weaker trend in financial markets.
</P>
<P>
Gains in the resources, gold and chemicals sectors aided the
benchmark all-share index to come off its lows.
</P>
<P>
At the 16:00 local time (14:00 GMT) close on the Johannesburg
Stock Exchange, the all-share had lost 0.46 percent, the
industrials fell 0.53 percent, financials skidded 1.27 percent,
while the all-gold index gained 0. 82 percent and resources were
0.65 percent higher to finish at a new closing high of 4,794.20.
The chemicals index rose 0.77 percent as Sasol, Polifin and AECI
dominated the sector.
</P>
<P>
"The all-share index has been down for most off the day. The
recovery in the gold price turned the gold index around to join
the positive looking resources index. The market was not exciting
at all and most of the active shares were acquisition driven,"
said Michael Yates, director at ING Barings.
</P>
<P>
Anglo American, the world's largest gold conglomerate, also
edged higher amid news that it is to buy a 23 percent stake in
Australia's Anaconda Nickel.
</P>
<P>
Anglo American topped the most value traded shares to close
322.00 rand (53.6 U.S. dollars), rising 3.60 from its previous
close.
</P>
<P>
The Information Technology index was 1.37 percent softer with
Dimension Data falling 1.45 percent or 35 cents from Friday's
close of 24.10 rand (four dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones has recovered and that would be an advantage for
equities to stage a recovery, market sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 0.91 percent or
97.5 points from Friday's close of 10,655.2 by 16:40 local time
(14:40 GMT).
</P>
<P>
The bond market followed the weaker rand to touch a weakest
level of 14. 755 percent after closing at 14.520 percent Friday.
</P>
<P>
The rand also weakened and was last quoted at 6.1900 rand per
dollar from a previous close of 6.1550 rand.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Test Early Warning System in Belarus Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 2 (Xinhua) -- A top Russian defense official
said Monday that an early warning facility in Branovichi of
western Belarus will be tested before the end of the year and
"supplied to the armed forces in 2000."
</P>
<P>
The early warning facility is expected to restore the single
radar field over the western and northwestern sectors after the
elimination of the radar facilities in Skrunde, Latvia, said
Colonel-General Vladimir Yakovlev, commander of the Russian
Strategic Rocket Forces, during a trip to Baranovichi.
</P>
<P>
"The radar facilities at Skrunde will be completely
decommissioned this year," the Interfax quoted Yakovlev as saying.
</P>
<P>
The commander said that the "hole" opened up in the single
radar field is being filled by the facilities located at Sofrino
and Chekhov outside Moscow.
</P>
<P>
However, Yakovlev said, "the loss of a single information field
will inevitably affect the stability of our nuclear weapons
complex."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the first (space-based) and second
(ground-based) echelons of the early-warning system "are essential
to decision-making, including as regards the use of nuclear
weapons."
</P>
<P>
He said that in accordance with interstate agreements, Russia
will supply information on rocket attacks to those countries of
the Commonwealth of Independent States that have Russian early
warning systems. The countries include Belarus, Ukraine,
Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan.

<HEADLINE> Writethru: 15 Injured in Opposition Strike in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- At least 15 people, including one
policeman and three train passengers, were injured during the
first day of the opposition-sponsored 30-hour nationwide strike in
Bangladesh Monday.
</P>
<P>
A police constable was seriously injured in the capital city
when a teargas shell bounced back from his own gun, and three
train passengers were injured when pickets hurled hand-made bomb
on them in a railway station in Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
Some 16 persons were detained by police so far for "creating
anarchy" and "damaging public property." Some 5,000 riot police
and paramilitary Bangladesh Rifle forces were deployed at
important points in the capital.
</P>
<P>
Barring some stray incidents, the shutdown was largely peaceful
and life was almost normal throughout the country. Most of the
government, semi-government and private offices remained open, and
rickshaws and buses plied the streets defying the strike.
</P>
<P>
Shops and business establishments adjacent to the main roads
were mostly closed and long distance buses and trucks remained off
the roads in the capital.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Chittagong, Rajshahi, Khulna, Barisal and
Sylhet, headquarters of another five divisions of the country,
also remained mostly normal. The country's largest seaport, the
Chittagong seaport, did not deliver or accept any cargo during the
day but loading and unloading inside the port continued as usual.
</P>
<P>
The opposition alliance, including the Bangladesh Nationalist
Party, the Jatiya Party, the Jamaat-e-Islami and the Islami Oikya
Jote, started the strike, the eighth of its kind sponsored by the
opposition alliance this year, to protest the government's
decision last week allowing "corridor to India in the name of
transshipment."
</P>
<P>
The ruling Bangladesh Awami League, meanwhile, brought out
anti-strike processions in the capital protesting the 30-hour
strike enforced by the opposition.

<HEADLINE> S. African Money Rates Steady Ahead of Reserve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Money market rates in South
Africa were steady Monday ahead of Tuesday's release of the
Reserve Bank's gross foreign reserves.
</P>
<P>
The repo rate (the central bank's prime lending rate) eased two
basis points to 13.630 percent Monday from 13.650 percent last
Friday, as the Reserve Bank matched the estimated liquidity
requirement of 12.2 billion rand (six billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Market sources said this week's local focus would be on gold
and foreign reserves data due Tuesday at 8:00 a.m. local time.
</P>
<P>
The market expects better foreign and gold reserves data due to
 the listing of Old Mutual on the London Stock Exchange on July
12, which brought in some five billion rand (83 million dollars)
into South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The consensus forecast for the Reserve Bank's gross foreign
reserves is a 1.5 billion rand (250 million dollars) increase to
36.6 billion rand (6.1 billion dollars), while the net open
forward position is expected to drop by one billion dollars to
17.3 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The money market is on hold until after (former labor minister
Tito) Mboweni has taken over as Reserve Bank governor, and for a
couple of weeks after that.
</P>
<P>
Mboweni will be inaugurated on August 7. The first trading day
after his inauguration is August 10, as August 9 is a public
holiday.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Mboweni hosted a dinner for journalists and told
them that exchange rate targeting was a discredited policy.
</P>
<P>
"Even the Bank of England in September 1992 saw that exchange
rate targeting was not a viable central bank policy," Mboweni
said.
</P>
<P>
"That leaves two policy options, a currency board system, where
you link your monetary policy to another country such as the U.S.,
or inflation targeting, which most central banks are following
currently. I will give the Reserve Bank's choice on August 24,"
Mboweni said.

<HEADLINE> Chemicals Sprayed to Prevent Malaria in Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Anti-malaria chemicals are
being sprayed in parts of area in Amhara State, Ethiopia, to
preempt possible outbreak of the epidemic following the rainy
season, Ethiopian News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Some 19,000 kilograms of anti-malaria chemicals have been
sprayed since June this year over 63,740 houses in Amhara State,

preventing malaria, local officials were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
August is a month suitable for malaria breeding in most parts
of Ethiopia, according medical experts.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian health authorities earlier called on the people
to participate in anti-malaria campaign to be launched in late
August.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Tanzania's Trade Deficit Rises to $101Million in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's trade deficit in
June 1999 has widened to 101 million U.S. dollars from 86.1
million in the previous month, the central bank said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The deterioration was caused by a significant decrease in
exports by 21. 4 percent, coupled with 7.4 percent increase in
imports, the Bank of Tanzania said in an economic report.
</P>
<P>
Total export earnings during June declined by 21.4 percent to
23.1 million dollars, from 29.4 million dollars in May after both
traditional and non-traditional exports decreased, the bank said
in its June issue monthly economic review.
</P>
<P>
Earnings from traditional exports decreased by 23.4 percent to
8.2 million dollars in June, from 10.7 million dollars in the
previous month due to declines in both export volumes and unit
export prices, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, decreases in export volumes of coffee,
cotton, tea, tobacco and cashew nuts registered 11.9 percent, 76.1
percent, 1.8 percent, 68.7 percent and 100 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
During June, non-traditional exports, including minerals,
manufactured goods, sisal products, fish and fish products and
horticulture products, declined by 20.3 percent to 14.9 million
dollars, from 18.7 million dollars in the previous month.
</P>
<P>
Total imports during June increased by 7.4 percent to 124.1
million dollars, from 115.5 million dollars recorded in May.
</P>
<P>
The import bills for two major categories, namely, capital
goods and intermediate goods, registered increases of 5.9 percent
and 80.8 percent respectively, the report said.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, it noted, imports for consumer goods
recorded a decrease of 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the imports of capital goods is mainly due to
the increase in the importation of transport equipment, building
and construction goods associated with the ongoing investments in
the mining sector and new investments in the construction sector.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Ministers Welcome WTO Ruling against Brazil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Canada welcomed Monday the latest
World Trade Organization (WTO) ruling against a Brazilian export
program for its aerospace industry.
</P>
<P>
Canadian International Trade Minister Sergio Marchi and
Industry Minister John Manly said that the WTO Appellate Body had
confirmed its earlier decisions on Brazil's PROEX export subsidy
program.
</P>
<P>
"We are pleased with the decision on PROEX, since it addresses
a serious threat to the Canadian aerospace industry and resolves a
long-standing dispute between Canada and Brazil," the ministers
announced.
</P>
<P>
The WTO Appellate Body confirmed that Brazil must withdraw the
PROEX export subsidies within 90 days, rejecting Brazil's appeal
against an earlier WTO ruling that PROEX was a prohibited export
subsidy program.
</P>
<P>
But Canadian officials did not say if the country would comply
with another ruling by the same WTO Appellate Body that Technology
Partnerships Canada was inconsistent with WTO rules in its support
for regional aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Minister Manley said he would move quickly to consult with
industry stakeholders on opinions for implementing this decision.
</P>
<P>
Canada and Brazil took their disputes over export subsidies to
the WTO in July 1998. In its April ruling this year, WTO panels
decided that Brazil's PROEX program and Technology Partnerships
Canada were prohibited export subsidies. The two countries later
appealed respectively again to the WTO in objection to the related
rulings.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian Aerospace sector comprises more than 400 companies
and employs approximately 60,000 people across Canada. Sales of
the Canadian products in this sector exceeded 15 billion Canadian
dollars (about 995.85 million U.S. dollars) in 1998, according to
the official information.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Conducts Another Antimissile Missile Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The United States conducted
another antimissile missile test in White Sands Missile Range in
New Mexico State Monday morning, military officials said.
</P>
<P>
The antimissile missile hit a simulated warhead, the second
success for a controversial 3.8 billion defense system that failed
in its first six attempts, according to the officials.
</P>
<P>
The Theater High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system is
designed to use ground-launched missiles to destroy high-altitude
enemy missiles from 1,280 kilometers away or more, a distance that
current U.S. weapons cannot reach.
</P>
<P>
The system has been criticized as too expensive and unreliable.
The weapon's prime contractor, Lockheed Martin Corporation, was
fined 15 million U.S. dollars after its sixth test failed in May.
THAAD scored its first hit on June 10 in New Mexico State.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Department has since said that it will cancel the fine
if the defense contractor improves THAAD performance and that it is
confident Lockheed Martin can successfully develop the system.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Small Arms Create Big Casualties in World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Small in size and light in
weight, small arms and light weapons have created big casualties
across the globe.
</P>
<P>
More than tanks, missiles and mortars, one half billion small
arms and light weapons are circulating in the world today.
</P>
<P>
They are responsible for killing three million people in the
last decade alone. No fewer than 8 of every 10 people killed were
children and women.
</P>
<P>
The availability of such arms can undermine ceasefire, peace
agreement and conflict resolution, make it easier for
ex-combatants to resort to banditry, crime and insurrection, and
hinder socio-economic development.
</P>
<P>
As part of their advocacy campaign against the uncontrolled
spread of small arms, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)
and the U.N. Department for Disarmament Affairs have produced an
exhibit entitled "Taking Aim at Small Arms Defending Child
Rights."
</P>
<P>
The small arms show, which is under way at the U.N.
headquarters, is comprised of informative text panels,
photographs, posters, 3-D cut-outs, children's drawings, icons,
interactives and video presentations which document the scourge of
small arms and light weapons, indicate their worldwide prevalence
and reveal the toll they take on human lives -- especially
children.
</P>
<P>
Some of the issues explored in the exhibit are child soldiers,
the arms trade, demobilization, disarmament and post-conflict
peace-building.
</P>
<P>
Jayantha Dhanapala, U.N. undersecretary-general for disarmament
affairs, has said, "The United Nations is determined to combat the
small arms plague, which affects the daily lives of millions of
people and consumes not only a great part of the international
community's resources, but also at risk its most important
investment in the future -- its children."
</P>
<P>
The exhibit also highlights the positive actions undertaken
internationally to promote further actions by both governments and
the general public in elimination of the trade in small arms.
</P>
<P>
"The spread of small arms creates serious global problem and
require an equally urgent response because the lives and futures
of millions of children are at stake," UNICEF Executive Director
Carol Bellamy said. "These weapons have probably extinguished more
young lives than they have protected."
</P>
<P>
Since 1990, small arms have become the weapons of choice in 46
of the 49 conflicts around the world. Two million firearms are
circulating in Central America, seven million in West Africa and
10 million in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"During the past decade, some 300,000 children participated in
over 30 conflicts worldwide. Such participants would have been
impossible without access to small arms, which children can easily
strip and reassemble," Bellamy said, adding that the international
spread of inexpensive small arms has made it easier to turn young
children into soldiers.
</P>
<P>
In the United States, children also fall victims to the small
arms abuse. On a typical day in the United States, nearly 13
children lose their lives to handgun killer. Gunfire killed 4,643
children in 1996.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, close to 300 companies in 52 countries were
manufacturing small arms and light weapons. The European Union and
the United States together account for 80 percent of the four
billion U.S. dollars a year in global arms trade.
</P>
<P>
To curb the illicit availability and illegal trade is the
concerted aim of the world community.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations, the 185-nation organization which has prime
responsibility for world peace and security, plays a dominant role
in actions against the spread of small arms and light weapons in
part of its sweeping efforts to resolve conflicts and promote
development all over the world.

<HEADLINE> IMF Notes Limited Recovery in Russia But Warns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) said on Monday that a "limited recovery" has emerged in Russia,
but warned that "considerable risks remain."
</P>
<P>
In its annual review of the Russian economy, the IMF said there has
been a turn-around in 1999, noting that industrial output during
April-June exceeded the levels of one year earlier by over 5 percent
on average.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign exchange market pressures have also eased and the ruble
has stabilized, while monthly inflation has come down to under 2
percent in June, reflecting a tightening of fiscal and monetary
policies," the IMF said.
</P>
<P>
Russia's overall balance of payments position has also become
stronger as the external current account has swung from a deficit of
2.7 billion U.S. dollars in the first quarter of 1998 to a surplus of
4.8 billion dollars in the first quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Russian government's macroeconomic framework for 1999 envisages
that the economic contraction will bottom out in 1999, with output for
the year as a whole declining by 2 percent. The external position
should strengthen, enabling a small increase in foreign reserves.
</P>
<P>
But the IMF warned that "the limited recovery and the measure of
stability achieved in recent months would prove unsustainable unless
strenuous and determined efforts were made to reduce the fiscal
deficit and to accelerate structural reforms."
</P>
<P>
The IMF said Russia's failure to tackle underlying fiscal problems
had been the main factor behind last year's financial crisis, when the
government devalued the ruble and defaulted on some domestic debts.
</P>
<P>
The IMF stressed that Russia's extremely difficult economic and
financial situation, amid a sharp cut-back in access to external
financing, should lend a new sense of urgency to the need for
fundamental and lasting reform.
</P>
<P>
"Directors stressed that fiscal consolidation remains at the heart
of the adjustment effort," it added.
</P>
<P>
The IMF approved last week a 17-month stand-by credit of 4.5
billion dollars for Russia to support the government's 1999-2000
economic program.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Difficult to Carry out Wye Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. State Department on
Monday acknowledged that carrying out the Wye agreement would be
difficult.
</P>
<P>
"There has been no change in that commitment, as far as we
know," State Department spokesman James Rubin said. "But even with
the best of intentions, it's going to take time to work out these
differences. We expect this to be difficult."
</P>
<P>
Israel would relinquish 13.1 percent of the West Bank to the
Palestinians under the Wye accord, reached last October between
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and former Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu with U.S. President Bill Clinton as the broker.
</P>
<P>
But Netanyahu called a halt for the implementation of the Wye
accord after ceding 2 percent of the land.
</P>
<P>
Ehud Barak after assuming the premiership of Israel in July,
advocated to combine the Wye agreement with the final status
negotiations, which means a delay of carrying out the accord as
was stipulated.
</P>
<P>
Because of opposition from the Palestinian Authority, Barak
again proposed on Sunday that October 1 would be the target date
for carrying out the remaining part of the accord.
</P>
<P>
But the Palestinians again rejected the proposal on Monday,
saying a two-month delay in withdrawal raised concerns that the
prime minister was trying to wiggle out of Israel's commitments to
pursue peace.
</P>
<P>
A senior Palestinian official has said that working-level talks
with Israel had broken down without agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration, however, indicated on Monday that
private contacts were continuing productively between Israel and the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"There is real contact -- effective contact, greater contact and
discussions -- between the two parties themselves, without the need
for the United States to involve itself in every single way," Rubin
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the discussions "tend to be a little more constructive
than the characterization some might put on them."
</P>
<P>
"Even with the best of intentions, it's not surprising that the
differences that developed over three years will not be worked out
overnight," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, both sides will need to work together if we're going to
determine ways and means to carry out and implement the Wye River
agreement," he added.

<P>
NAIROBI, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government has allocated
37 million U.S. dollars to assist the victims of August 7, 1998
bomb blast in Kenyan capital Nairobi and to rebuild the affected
buildings and businesses, a U.S. official said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Country Director Jonathan Conly of the U.S. Agency for
International Development (USAID) said in Nairobi that the
Cooperative Bank House will be the main beneficiary of the grant
and its reconstruction is estimated to cost 10 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Conly said that the bids for reconstruction tender of the house
are ready in September this year and the contract will be offered
by the end of October, adding that the reconstruction work on the

</P>
<P>
The 37-million-dollar grant for blast victims was approved last
 September by the U.S. Congress.
</P>
<P>
Those children who lost their parents in the blast will be
extended 2.5 million dollars for a three-year primary and
secondary school fees assistance.
</P>
<P>
The education program will be implemented through the Kenya Red
Cross which has so far identified 898 children for school fees
assistance, Conly said.
</P>
<P>
The official said that nine million dollars will go to
reconstructive surgery and other medical care for the blast
survivors and 3.7 million for 60 buildings affected by the
bombing.
</P>
<P>
The USAID also contracted KPMG Peat Marwick to verify losses to
small- and medium-sized businesses, and cheques will be issued
within next two weeks, Conly added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Construction Spending Rebounds Slightly in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The Commerce Department said
Monday that U.S. construction spending rebounded slightly in June,
rising 0.5 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 699.4
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
June's increase followed the drops of 1.4 percent in both May
and April, the Department said.
</P>
<P>
The increases in June were widespread with gains reported in
office buildings, industrial buildings, hotels and big government
projects. But spending on all residential construction dropped 0.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
The Department's report showed that spending on all private
construction projects jumped 0.6 percent in June to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 550 billion dollars. The private
construction spending, after having declines in May and April, was
the main factor in the overall gain in June's construction
spending.
</P>
<P>
Spending on government construction projects also rebounded in
June, rising 0.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
149.4 billion dollars, after having fallen three straight months
in a row.

<HEADLINE> "Two States" Remarks to Bring Calamities to Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The article, signed by Huang Jiashu, says that Lee Teng-hui's "
two states" remarks have neither historical evidence nor a legal
basis to back it, and it will surely bring calamities to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Though Lee's remarks have been criticized by the Chinese
worldwide, some Taiwanese have not recognized the nature of Lee's
splittist remarks, the article says.
</P>
<P>
It points out that the "two states" remarks deceive the Taiwan
people by saying "the sovereignty of Taiwan belongs to the Taiwan
people". In this way, it fools the Taiwan people into thinking
that Lee wants them to become their own masters.
</P>
<P>
Lee Teng-hui also cited that "the Communist Party of China (CPC)
has never governed Taiwan since 1949" as part of its basic
evidence.
</P>
<P>
The article says that, in fact, the taking over of Taiwan by "
the government of the Republic of China" in 1945 from the Japanese
was only possible because Taiwan has always been an inalienable
part of China's territory, and the resumption of China's
sovereignty over Taiwan was based on the Cairo Declaration.
</P>
<P>
The article also refutes the so-called "effective rule" theory,
stressing that though China has not achieved reunification, the
fact that sovereignty over Taiwan belongs to China has never
changed.
</P>
<P>
It says the Taiwan people's will to become their own masters
and their desire for the reunification of the motherland have
never contradicted each other.
</P>
<P>
The article predicts that Lee's splittist remarks will not
bring security to Taiwan, but will damage the island province's
economy and trade, and eventually bring calamities to the people
of Taiwan.

SEOUL -- Some 50 people were feared dead or missing while South
Korea was hit by torrential rains, floods and landslides caused by
Typhoon Olga, local media reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Olga is heading for the heart of the peninsula and the death
toll could rise as communications with isolated areas are restored,
disaster officials said.
</P>
<P>
An intense low-pressure system which had affected upper South
Korea moved slowly southward, after dumping up to 20 centimeters (
8 inches) of rains in the central part South Korea, weather
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Gale-force winds and rains drenched South Korea's southern and
western coasts.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of houses were reportedly flooded in Cheju, an island
100 kilometers off the peninsula's south coast. High sea waves
were seen pounding the shores of the island and gale-force winds
uprooted trees and telephone poles.
</P>
<P>
Five domestic airports and all domestic ports were closed while
the Korea Meteorological Administration Office issued a nationwide
typhoon alert early on Tuesday.
</P>

Olga would pass near the capital Seoul by evening and head
directly for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, weather
officials said. (SKorea-Typhoon)

<HEADLINE> Britain: Pinochet Can Go Home If Spain Withdraws Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The British government confirmed
Tuesday that if Spain dropped its request for extradition, former
Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet, who has been detained in London
for the past 10 months, would be free to go home.
</P>
<P>
"If there are no charges and the case is withdrawn, then there
is no reason to hold him. If Spain decides to withdraw the
extradition, then court proceedings will cease," a spokeswoman for
the Home Office (interior ministry) said.
</P>
<P>
She noted that Pinochet was not facing charges in Britain.
</P>
<P>
Her remarks were made after Spain said at the weekend it was
considering a request by Chile that the case be settled by
arbitration.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet, 83, was arrested in a London hospital last October at
Spain's request to face charges of murder, torture and hostage
taking.
</P>
<P>
A Spanish judge accused Pinochet of being responsible for the
disappearances and deaths of 3,000 people and wanted him to be
extradited from Britain to face trial in Spain.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet had claimed sovereign immunity to prosecution for
crimes committed between 1973 and 1990 when he was in power.
</P>
<P>
The retired general, under house arrest at a mansion southwest
of London, is due in court next month for an extradition hearing.
</P>
<P>
The Home Office spokeswoman said Pinochet was not facing
charges in Britain. She also expressed doubt that Britain would
have to prosecute Pinochet if Spain dropped its case.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if the UK would be obliged," she said.
</P>
<P>
Chile, which wants Pinochet to be sent home, asked the Spanish
government last week to accept arbitration to decide whether
Pinochet should be tried in Spain -- hoping to engineer an
alternative which would spare Pinochet trial in Madrid.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Opposition Announces New Anti-Govt Programs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's opposition alliance
announced fresh anti-government programs here Tuesday afternoon
after a 30-hour countrywide strike which police said left nearly
20 persons injured and 25 others arrested.
</P>
<P>
In post-strike rallies in the capital city, the opposition
parties announced identical programs to gear up their
anti-government movement, including a week-long program of rallies
between August 7 and 13, demonstrations before district
commissioners' offices across the country on August 18, a big
procession in Dhaka on August 30 and a siege of the Bangladesh
Secretariat on September 12.
</P>
<P>
The programs were aimed at "forcing reversal of the government
plans to give transshipment facilities to India," Deputy Leader of
the Opposition in Parliament Badruddoza Chowdhury said.
</P>
<P>
The opposition alliance, comprising the Bangladesh Nationalist
Party, the Jatiya Party, the Jamaat-e-Islami and the Islami Oikya
Jote, staged the 30-hour shutdown Monday and Tuesday to protest
the government's decision last week to examine the proposal of
providing transshipment facilities to India.
</P>
<P>
The opposition accused the government of allowing "corridor to
India in the name of transshipment."

OTTAWA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Toronto-Dominion Bank is buying
another financial titan Canada Trust in a deal of 8 billion
Canadian dollars (about 5.312 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The companies announced the merger Tuesday hours before North
American stock markets opened.
</P>
<P>
TD Bank has agreed to pay 67 Canadian dollars per share to buy
the holding company that owns Canada Trust, according to local
media reports.
</P>
<P>
TD Bank said in a statement that up to 4,800 full-time
positions would be cut during a three-year transition period.
</P>
<P>
The deal is conditional on regulatory approval and the
completion of a multi-stage transaction involving Montreal-based
company Imasco and the British tobacco company BAT, which owns 42
percent of Imasco.
</P>
<P>
The decision to sell Canada Trust is partly linked to BAT's
desire to concentrate on its core business in tobacco, the media
reports said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Representative Explains China's Stance on Nuclear Disarmament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Zhu Shanqing, vice president of
Chinese People's Association for Peace and Disarmament, on Tuesday
expounded China's stance on nuclear disarmament at the opening day
of a three-day antinuclear conference in Hiroshima, western Japan.
</P>
<P>
"China has constantly adopted a responsible attitude on the
issue of nuclear disarmament," Zhu told the annual world
conference, hosted by the Japan Council Against A and H Bombs (
gensuikyo), a major antinuclear group in Japan.
</P>
<P>
First, China solemnly declared from the first day it possessed
nuclear weapons that it would not be the first to use such weapons
at any time and under any circumstances, Zhu elaborated.
</P>
<P>
China has also committed itself unconditionally not to use or
threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon states,
he said, adding that China is the only nuclear-weapon country that
has made and kept such a promise.
</P>
<P>
Second, Zhu went on to say, China has never deployed any
nuclear weapons outside its territories, and has never used or
threatened to use nuclear weapons against other countries.
</P>
<P>
Third, China has always exercised the utmost restraint in
developing nuclear weapons, both the number of nuclear tests
conducted by China and the quantity of nuclear weapons possessed
by the country are very limited, he said.
</P>
<P>
Fourth, Zhu pointed out, China has always vigorously supported
the efforts to relevant countries to establish nuclear-free zones
on the basis of voluntary consultation and agreement, and has
unconditionally pledged to provide the signatory states of nuclear-
free zones with security assurance.
</P>
<P>
Fifth, China has always been vigorously supporting the complete
prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons, he added.
</P>
<P>
On China's defense policy, Zhu stressed that China's national
defense policy is defensive in nature.
</P>
<P>
China does not seek hegemonism or engage in expansion, nor does
it station any troops abroad, go for military alliance or join
arms races, he said.
</P>
<P>
China's military expenditure has been kept at a fairly low
level, Zhu said, adding that China will further reduce its
military personnel by 500,000 by the end of the century, on the
basis of the reduction of one million in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Zhu also said China is an important force for safeguarding
peace in Asia and the world as a whole, adding that the
development of China will only contribute to enhancing the trend
of mutual complementarity in the world, and promoting the common
development of all nations.
</P>
<P>
The conference is the first of Gensuikyo's series of
antinuclear events until August 9 to observe the 54th anniversary
of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Japan Congress Against A and H Bombs (Gensuikin),
another major antinuclear group in Japan, also hosted an
international conference in Hiroshima, calling on the Japanese
government to press for the creation of a nuclear free zone in
Northeast Asia.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Twenty anthrax cases have been
registered in southern Kyrgyzstan, the Interfax news agency
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The epidemic is spreading from the Osh region and over 250
other people were believed to have contacted with the beef that
contains the bacterium that causes anthrax, Interfax said, quoting
a source with the central Asian country's Health Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Anthrax is an infectious, usually fatal disease of warm-
blooded animals, especially cattle and sheep. It can be
transmitted to human beings through contact with contaminated
animal substances, such as hair, feces or hides, and is
characterized by ulcerative skin lesions.
</P>
<P>
Kyrgyzstan's Extraordinary Anti-Epidemic Commission has
imposed a state of emergency in the southern areas of the country.
Regional and local authorities and veterinary services have been
told to tighten their control over the slaughter of animals and
the sales of meat, Interfax said.

<HEADLINE> Iran Demands Turkish Response on Inquiry of Air </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Tuesday demanded an
immediate response from Turkey on its inquiry into air raids of
Iranian border outpost and villages two weeks ago, in which five
Iranians were killed and another 10 injured.
</P>
<P>
According to the official Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA),
the demand was made by Iran's ambassador to Turkey Mohammad
Hussein Lavasani, who on Monday held talks with Turkish Foreign
Ministry director general for the Middle East affairs.
</P>
<P>
IRNA said the two discussed the upcoming meeting of the
neighbors' joint security commission to be held in Ankara on
August 9-13.
</P>
<P>
Iran has claimed that four Turkish warplanes on July 18
intruded into its territorial space in the Piranshahr area in the
northwest and dropped bombs, causing human and material damages.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has hinted that Iran was replacing Syria in hosting
Turkey's Kurdish rebels, who have been leading a separatist war in
southeastern Turkey for more than a decade. Ankara succeeded last
year in forcing Damascus to drop its support for Kurdish
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
IRNA said the Turkish official told the Iranian ambassador
that Turkey will "announce the result of the inquiry made by a
fact-finding delegation which visited Iran to review the border
incidents."
</P>
<P>
Turkish military and civilian officials visited the border
region in northwestern Iran on Wednesday to investigate the air
raids. They were expected to compile their findings in a report.
</P>
<P>
Lavasani stressed the need for an immediate completion of the
inquiry into the air raids and demanded Turkey's serious
attention to Iran's sensitivities and concerns regarding the
issue.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharazi has met with his
Turkish counterpart Ismail Cem on the sidelines of the Balkan's
Stability Pact Summit in Sarajavo to mend fences. Their talks were
described as "constructive" and Turkey has expressed the hope
that two of its soldiers arrested in Iran will be released soon.
</P>
<P>
There seemed to have been more downs than ups in
Iranian-Turkish relations, but the two sides stressed the need
for "common understanding" to strengthen bilateral relations in
all fields.

people continue to flee the fighting in the Democratic Republic of
Congo.
</P>
<P>
The Nairobi Regional Delegation of the International Federation
of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said here Tuesday the
existing Red Cross camp at Lugufu, 90 kilometers east of the Lake
Tanganyika port of Kigoma, has been stretched beyond capacity for
weeks.
</P>
<P>
The International Federation Tuesday launched a 1.7
million-Swiss-franc (around 1.1 million U.S. dollars) appeal to
shelter up to 30,000 refugees in a buffer camp close to Lugufu,
said the Nairobi Regional Delegation in a media release.
</P>
<P>
The strategy will allow the Red Cross to limit the population
of its old camps to 60,000, which is still 20,000 more than it
was designed for, the release said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Federation, in Lugufu, food rations have
already been reduced and the water supply will have to be
decreased shortly. Meanwhile sickness and mortality rate are on
the rise due to colder weather.
</P>
<P>
Georg Nothelle, head of the International Federation in
Tanzania, said that the new camp will operate as an extension of
Lugufu, which is run by the Tanzania Red Cross with support from
the International Federation.
</P>
<P>
Nothelle said the Federation faces a serious shortfall of funds
for its existing operation, adding that the refugee influx has
effectively doubled the resources needed over the second half of
the year.

<HEADLINE> Pyongyang Defends Satellite Launch as Sovereign Right </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Pyongyang on Tuesday dismissed
the U.S. warning against its attempt to test-fire missiles and
said that the launch of a satellite or a missile is a "legitimate
right" of a sovereign state.
</P>
<P>
"Whether we will test-fire a satellite or a missile is a
legitimate right to be exercised by a sovereign state because it
in no way runs counter to the universally-accepted international
convention and the nuclear framework agreement between the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and the United States,
" the Korean Central News Agency quoted a Foreign Ministry
spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The more the United States exerts pressure upon us, the
stronger our reaction will be," the spokesman said, adding that
this could lead to unpredictable consequences.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Japan and South Korea last week, U.S.
Defense Secretary William Cohen warned the DPRK not to test-fire
missile and threatened to punish it if it did otherwise.
</P>
<P>
"If the United States returns challenge for our good faith,
that will force us to significantly increase our national defense
capabilities and continue to push ahead with the missile testfire,
to say nothing of satellite launch," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Cohen is trying to find a pretext to ignite
a war by labeling DPRK's satellite efforts as missile test-fires.

HANGZHOU, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Two men convicted of issuing
fake value-added tax (VAT) invoices were sentenced to death
recently by the Shaoxing Intermediate People's Court of Zhejiang
Province.
</P>
<P>
Tang Weizhong, a manager of a Shenzhen-based company, and
Ouyang Hao, unemployed, were accused of issuing fake VAT invoices
involving a total of 400 million yuan (about 48 million U.S.

1997 period.
</P>
<P>
The court said that it was probable that only 1.7 million yuan
of the tax revenue could be retrieved, which meant enormous
economic losses for the country.

Three accomplices -- Xu Huahong, Jin Youxin and Sun Jinqun,

<HEADLINE> Chinese Representative Explains China's Stance on Nuclear Disarmament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Zhu Shanqing, vice president of
Chinese People's Association for Peace and Disarmament, on Tuesday
expounded China's stance on nuclear disarmament at the opening day
of a three-day antinuclear conference in Hiroshima, western Japan.
</P>
<P>
"China has constantly adopted a responsible attitude on the
issue of nuclear disarmament," Zhu told the annual world
conference, hosted by the Japan Council Against A and H Bombs (
gensuikyo), a major antinuclear group in Japan.
</P>
<P>
First, China solemnly declared from the first day it possessed
nuclear weapons that it would not be the first to use such weapons
at any time and under any circumstances, Zhu elaborated.
</P>
<P>
China has also committed itself unconditionally not to use or
threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon states,
he said, adding that China is the only nuclear-weapon country that
has made and kept such a promise.
</P>
<P>
Second, Zhu went on to say, China has never deployed any
nuclear weapons outside its territories, and has never used or
threatened to use nuclear weapons against other countries.
</P>
<P>
Third, China has always exercised the utmost restraint in
developing nuclear weapons, both the number of nuclear tests
conducted by China and the quantity of nuclear weapons possessed
by the country are very limited, he said.
</P>
<P>
Fourth, Zhu pointed out, China has always vigorously supported
the efforts to relevant countries to establish nuclear-free zones
on the basis of voluntary consultation and agreement, and has
unconditionally pledged to provide the signatory states of nuclear-
free zones with security assurance.
</P>
<P>
Fifth, China has always been vigorously supporting the complete
prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons, he added.
</P>
<P>
On China's defense policy, Zhu stressed that China's national
defense policy is defensive in nature.
</P>
<P>
China does not seek hegemonism or engage in expansion, nor does
it station any troops abroad, go for military alliance or join
arms races, he said.
</P>
<P>
China's military expenditure has been kept at a fairly low
level, Zhu said, adding that China will further reduce its
military personnel by 500,000 by the end of the century, on the
basis of the reduction of one million in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Zhu also said China is an important force for safeguarding
peace in Asia and the world as a whole, adding that the
development of China will only contribute to enhancing the trend
of mutual complementarity in the world, and promoting the common
development of all nations.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said the facts that the U.S.-led North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) used forces against Yugoslavia and attacked
the Chinese embassy there with missiles in May have manifested
that the U.S. hegemonism has undergone new development.

<P>
In an attempt to dominate the whole world, the U.S. is carrying
out the Two Ocean Strategies, namely the "Atlantic Ocean Strategy,
" which means to accelerate NATO's eastward expansion, and the "
Pacific Ocean Strategy," which is to strengthen the U.S.-Japan
military alliance, Zhu noted.
</P>
<P>
This has clearly proved that the U.S. has sped up the
implementation of its hegemonic policy, constituting a severe
threat to peace in Asia and the world at large, he said.
</P>
<P>
"In order to effectively safeguard peace in Asia and the world,
we must firmly oppose hegemonism," Zhu stressed.
</P>
<P>
The conference is the first of Gensuikyo's series of
antinuclear events until August 9 to observe the 54th anniversary
of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.
</P>
<P>
About 280 antinuclear activists, including 60 participants from
20 countries, are taking part in the conference.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Japan Congress Against A and H Bombs (Gensuikin),
another major antinuclear group in Japan, concluded its two-day
international conference in Hiroshima, after discussing ways to
create a nuclear free zone in Northeast Asia and to stop relying
on nuclear power.

<HEADLINE> Red Cross Evacuates Patients in Northern Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The Red Cross said Tuesday it had
evacuated eight patients in the last two days from areas held by
Tamil rebels in northern Sri Lanka following reports that four
people had died for lack of medicines.
</P>
<P>
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) here said
it had arranged escorts for several boats to carry the sick to the
Mannar base hospital in northwestern Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
ICRC spokesman Harsha Gunawardena said its officials will visit
the Wanni area Thursday to transport another batch of seriously
ill patients.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the government said at least four sick people had
died due to the lack of urgent treatment in rebel-held Wanni
region.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan Army Monday forwarded a new set of proposals to
the Tamil rebels through the ICRC to open a new route to Wanni
area as its earlier proposal was rejected by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
The government has traditionally supplied food and other items
to civilians in rebel-held areas, while allowing them access to
government-controlled towns for trade and other activities.
</P>
<P>
An earlier route was closed in May when the army launched a
fresh offensive in its war against the Tamil rebels, who have been
fighting for a separate homeland in Sri Lanka's north and east for
minority Tamils since 1983.

<HEADLINE> Belgium Denies Blocking Appointment of New NATO Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Belgium on Tuesday rejected news
reports that it had tried along with the Netherlands and
Luxembourg to block the appointment of British Defense Minister
George Robertson as the new chief of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
A Belgian Foreign Ministry Spokesman told Xinhua that Belgium
had no attempt to block such an appointment at a meeting of NATO
ambassadors here on Monday. The 19 representatives of NATO
members finished the meeting without reaching consensus on naming
Robertson as the successor to Spain's Javier Solana, the outgoing
NATO secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
According to the Dutch NOS radio, the three Benelux nations of
Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg were responsible for the
delay of the appointment process.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman for the Belgian Foreign Ministry, Hubert Cooreman,
said the ambassadors did not collectively endorse the British
nomination because some countries, including Belgium, the
Netherlands and Canada, had not received clear instructions from
their high-level authorities.
</P>
<P>
However, Cooreman said, his country was unhappy with the way
some big NATO members were operating on the timing of the decision
process. They decided the process without any consultation with
other smaller NATO countries, he said, stressing that they are
also full NATO members.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Belgium did not consider the naming of a new
NATO chief as an urgent issue. Only last Friday did British Prime
Minister Tony Blair officially announce, in Sarajevo, the capital
of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the 53-year-old Robertson as Britain's NATO
chief candidate, he added.
</P>
<P>
"We are not disapproving Mr. Robertson's appointment. We are
just somewhat irritated by the way the big NATO members are doing,
" Cooreman said referring to the arrogant NATO members like the
United States and Britain.

<HEADLINE> Suker Favors to Join Arsenal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Croatian striker Davor Suker, who
won the gold boot in France World Cup, turned down a four million
pound (about 6.4 million U.S. dollars) transfer offer to join
American Major League Soccer, favoring instead a move to London-
based Arsenal.
</P>
<P>
Suker was on the verge of signing with the New York Metro Stars
before accepting a last-minute deal from the Gunners, according to
Tuesday's Evening Standard reports.
</P>
<P>
The Standard quoted Suker's English soccer advisor Ray
Bloomfield saying the 31-year-old striker was being recruited to
become the "focal point of soccer in North America."
</P>
<P>
Suker completed a 3.5 million pound (about 5.64 million U.S.
dollars) transfer from Spanish giant Real Madrid to Arsenal on
Monday in a deal which reportedly halved his weekly salary from 40,
000 pounds (64,400 U.S. dollars) per week to 20,000 pounds (32,200
U.S. dollars) per week.
</P>
<P>
Suker, who joined Real Madrid in 1996, had a falling out with
coach John Toshack last season, which prompted his move.

<HEADLINE> Trial of Cambodian KR leader Ta Mok To Be Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian National Assembly's
Legislation Committee agreed Tuesday to submit a new law to the
assembly for final approval, paving the way for the delay of the
trial of captured Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
</P>
<P>
The new law was proposed by the ruling Cambodian People's Party
(CPP) and the royalist FUNCINPEC party after a series of
discussion.
</P>
<P>
The new law states that "for the case of genocidal crimes, war
crimes, or crimes against humanity, the temporary detention can be
delayed once within every year, but the period of delay must not
exceed three years."
</P>
<P>
If the new law is approved by the National Assembly, Ta Mok
will not be tried next month for violating a 1994 law banning the
Khmer Rouge. Instead he will be tried only once under the law of
genocide.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia's military court has considered double trials if the
new law will not be passed.
</P>
<P>
Ta Mok's lawyer Benson Samay said last weekend that Ta Mok will
be tried late next month by the law outlawing the Khmer Rouge.
Under the current penal law of Cambodia, if the government does
not begin a trial before a six-month deadline, Ta Mok, arrested on
March 6, must be released in September.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Hun Sen and some Western analysts said earlier
that if Ta Mok were tried by the 1994 law, some current government
officials would be embarrassed for their collusion with Khmer
Rouge elements in the months leading to the July 1997 factional
fighting.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia has agreed to make a tribunal with international
standard in character in which foreign legal experts, prosecutors
and judges can take part.

<HEADLINE> More People in Beijing Using Lawsuits To Get Even </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The courts in Beijing have been
working hard to ensure the fairness of their verdicts and more
people are turning to the law to protect their rights.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, courts at various levels in
Beijing heard 96,570 cases, up 32.9 percent from the same period
last year, according to the Municipal Higher People's Court.
</P>
<P>
Court statistics show 77,910 cases were concluded from January
to June this year, an increase of 36.2 percent over the first six
months of last year.
</P>
<P>
The increase is attributed to the rise in civil lawsuits and
instances of economic wrongdoing and mismanagement and it shows
that more people believe they can have their say by resorting to
the law, legal scholars say.
</P>
<P>
Since last year, Beijing's courts have held much more open
trials to ensure the fairness of their verdicts and to give people
greater confidence in the courts, scholars say.
</P>
<P>
To increase its transparency and to do a better job under
public scrutiny, Beijing's Intermediate Court No.1 has begun
giving people access to court documents.

<HEADLINE> "Two States" Remarks to Bring Calamity to Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The People's Daily is to carry a
signed article tomorrow, further refuting Lee Teng-hui's splittist
remarks.
</P>
<P>
The article, signed by Huang Jiashu, says that Lee Teng-hui's "
two states" remarks have neither historical evidence nor a legal
basis to back it, and it will surely bring calamities to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Though Lee's remarks have been criticized by the Chinese
worldwide, some Taiwanese have not recognized the nature of Lee's
splittist remarks, the article says.
</P>
<P>
It points out that the "two states" remarks deceive the Taiwan
people by saying "the sovereignty of Taiwan belongs to the Taiwan
people". In this way, it fools the Taiwan people into thinking
that Lee wants them to become their own masters.
</P>
<P>
Lee Teng-hui also cited that "the Communist Party of China (CPC)
has never governed Taiwan since 1949" as part of its basic
evidence.
</P>
<P>
The article says that, in fact, the taking over of Taiwan by "
the government of the Republic of China" in 1945 from the Japanese
was only possible because Taiwan has always been an alienable part
of China's territory, and the resumption of China's sovereignty
over Taiwan was based on the Cairo Declaration.
</P>
<P>
The article also refutes the so-called "effective rule" theory,
stressing that though China has not achieved reunification, the
fact that sovereignty over Taiwan belongs to China has never
changed.
</P>
<P>
It says the Taiwan people's will to become their own masters
and their desire for the reunification of the motherland have
never contradicted each other.
</P>
<P>
The article predicts that Lee's splittist remarks will not
bring security to Taiwan, but will damage the island province's
economy and trade, and eventually bring calamities to the people
of Taiwan.

YANGON, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar's foreign trade, including
 border trade, reached 3.995 billion U.S. dollars in fiscal
1998-99 which ended in March, up 16.67 percent from the previous
fiscal year's 3.424 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest economic indicators published by the
country's Central Statistical Organization, of the total trade
volume, imports were 2.815 billion dollars, while exports stood at
1.18 billion dollars, producing a trade deficit of 1.635 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's import commodities are classified under the three
major categories of capital goods, consumers goods and
intermediate goods. The import value of the three sectors was
1.446 billion dollars, 1.039 billion dollars and 330 million
dollars respectively, accounting for 51.36 percent, 36.9 percent
and 11.74 percent of the total import correspondingly.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's main export goods are agricultural products, marine
products such as fish and prawn, and forest products including
teak and hardwood.

67.49 percent of the total import, while its export value
accounted for 69.31 percent of the total export.

The increase of Myanmar's foreign trade volume in the year was
closely linked with measures such as the simplification of import
and export formalities and the addition of border trade points.

civic education activities to mark the 50th anniversary of the
founding of the People's Republic of China on October 1, to
promote a better understanding of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The celebration program, mainly targets at the younger
generation, has adopted the theme "Hearts and Hopes for Motherland
and Hong Kong".
</P>
<P>
The program aims to provide the public with a special
opportunity to participate in the National Day celebrations in
Hong Kong and at the same time acquire a better understanding of
China, ranging from the country's history and traditions to its
latest political, economic and social development through a wide
variety of events.
</P>
<P>
"To tie in with the major celebration activities on October 1,
this civic education program would urge the public, in particular
youths, to learn more about our motherland which in turn would
foster a stronger sense of belonging to Hong Kong and contribute
to the implementation of the 'one country, two systems' principle,
" said David Lan, secretary for home affairs, while announcing the
details of the program at a press conference Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The program consists of two phases of activities. The first
phase includes the Tokens of Regards Design Competition and youth

<HEADLINE> Asian Business Leaders Launch Corporate Governance  Initiative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 3 (Xinhua) -- A group of business leaders
from seven Asian countries met here Tuesday to launch the first
regional business association for promoting corporate governance.
</P>
<P>
The association, called the Asian Corporate Governance
Association, aims to persuade Asian companies to understand that
sound corporate governance will not only contribute to stronger
and more modern companies and economies, but will also become a
fundamental prerequisite of doing business internationally in the
next century.
</P>
<P>
"The globalization of the world business system and economy
means that corporate governance is an inevitable international
trend," said David Chiang, chairman and managing partner of
Lombard Asian Private Investment Company (LAPIC), a Hong Kong-
based private equity fund and founder of the association.
</P>
<P>
"But corporate governance in Asia is a long way behind that of
the U.S. and Europe. If we want to become as efficient as they are,
we need to put our corporate management practices on a much
stronger footing," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Corporate governance is good for business because it raises
investor confidence and reduces the cost of capital, and can lead
to higher profit performance," he stated.
</P>
<P>
The association aims to promote corporate governance through
four channels, namely, information analysis and dissemination,
advocacy, education and networking/partnering.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 3 (Xinhua) -- China's leading newspaper, the
People's Daily will carry a commentator's article tomorrow further
exposing the nature of and harm done by the Falun Gong cult.
</P>
<P>
All Party members and the people throughout the country are
deeply involved in the political struggle against Falun Gong and
its organization, the article says, but more facts should be
provided to expose the reactionary nature of Falun Gong and its
head, Li Hongzhi.
</P>
<P>
It stresses that "facts are more convincing than argument".
Only facts can expose Li Hongzhi's nature of being against science,
mankind, the government and society.
</P>
<P>
The Falun Gong practitioners and other relevant people should
be encouraged to disclose the hazards brought about by Falun Gong,
and Li Hongzhi should be taken as a negative example for people to
draw a lesson from, the article says.
</P>
<P>
The article calls on all the people in the country to strictly
observe the decisions and arrangements of the Chinese Communist
Party Central Committee in dealing with Falun Gong, adhere to the
facts and truth, and carry the struggle against Falun Gong to a
successful conclusion.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Capture Important District in Northern Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's Taliban militia
Tuesday captured a key district of Imam Sahib in northern Kunduz
province in their latest offensive against the beleaguered
opposition forces, news reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The fall of Imam Sahib came in the wake of overnight capture of
Sher Khan Bander port on the Ammo river bordering Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of the Afghan Islamic Press (AIP), the
student militia are heading towards Dashte-Arche, another district
of Kunduz.
</P>
<P>
During the overnight fighting, the Taliban gained the control
over Sher Khan Bandar in Kunduz which had been used to ship
outside supplies to the anti-Taliban northern alliance forces.
</P>
<P>
The alliance commander Ahmad Shah Masood developed another
port, Aaye Khanam in Takhar province, on the same river two years
ago which weakened the importance of Sher Khan Bandar, according
to Afghan sources here.
</P>
<P>
On the main battlefields north of the capital Kabul, Taliban
troops were carrying out clean-up operations, reported AIP.
</P>
<P>
The militia claimed that they had entered into strategic Salang
Pass, which connects the northern part of Afghanistan with Kabul,
but no immediate confirmation from independent sources was
available.
</P>
<P>
AIP said the Taliban forces also captured the Parwan province
town of Gulbahar at the mouth of the Panjsher valley, the
opposition stronghold which the Masood forces had retreated into.

<HEADLINE> Poll Shows Most Canadians Brace for Common Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Most Canadians agree that there
will be a common North American currency in the next two decades,
according to the local media.
</P>
<P>
Citing a poll conducted by the Angus Reid Group between July 8
and 14, The Globe and Mail newspaper and CTV reported Tuesday that
approximately 77 percent of the interviewees believe a common
currency is likely in the next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
The media quoted the executive vice-president of the group
Darrell Bricker as declaring a momentum "proceeding apace" for
closer U.S.-Canadian economic ties.
</P>
<P>
Based on the poll of 1,500 Canadians, Bricker said "what all
this shows is that the move to integration is far stronger than
most people understand."
</P>
<P>
But the pollster admitted that 58 percent of those surveyed
still consider a common currency a "bad thing."
</P>
<P>
Discussion of a common currency in North America has
intensified this year in the wake of the move in January by 11
European nations to merge their currencies into the euro.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien, Finance Minister Paul
Martin and Bank of Canada governor Gordon Thiessen have all
rejected the concept of adopting the U.S. dollar or seeking a
currency union with the United States.
</P>
<P>
They argue that such a move would represent an unacceptable
loss of sovereignty for Canada, the local media said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Plans New Millennium Celebrations to Boost Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will celebrate the
advent of the new millennium on a grand scale with various
programs aimed at promoting the tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
The celebration, called "Malaysia's Centennial Into The New
Millennium", will be held for two years from September this year
to August 2001, Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmade
Badawi said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The main objective of the program is to raise awareness of and
love for one's own country among Malaysians and also to draw the
attention of the world community to the achievements of the
Malaysian race, he told reporters after chairing the inaugural
meeting of the celebrations committee at Putrajaya, the new
government center, some 30 kilometers from here, the Malaysian
national news agency Bernama reported.
</P>
<P>
It is also to inculcate the tourism culture among Malaysians to
enjoy the beauty of their own country and to lure the world
community to visit Malaysia and thus step up the nation's tourism
industry, he said.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said the government would also use the opportunity to
organize visits before and after the international-class events to
introduce Malaysia to the visitors.
</P>
<P>
All events under the "Malaysia's Centennial Into The New
Millennium" program would be coordinated by the Culture, Arts and
Tourism Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The programs already planned for this year include the two-week
Malaysia Fest starting on September 11 and culminating with the
Colors of Malaysia Parade on September 25.

<HEADLINE> Agriculture, Health Officials Slam Lee Teng-hui's Splittist Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Leading Chinese officials and
experts in the fields of agriculture and public health
respectively denounced Lee Teng-hui's splittist remarks here today,
saying that his "two states" statement has destroyed healthy cross-
straits cooperation in these fields.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Agriculture Chen Yaobang told a seminar that China'
s inland areas and Taiwan share a promising future of cooperation
in agriculture on a mutually beneficial basis.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 agricultural symposiums and trade talks between
the two sides of the Taiwan Straits have been held since 1988.
Agricultural personnel from both sides have a better understanding
of each other, and have established closer relations through
increased visits and academic exchanges, according to Xiang
Chongyang, chairman of the China Association for Agricultural
Exchanges.
</P>
<P>
However, this healthy development has been damaged since Lee
Teng-hui made his "two states" remarks, which deserves
denunciation by the people of both sides, Chen Yaobang said.
</P>
<P>
At another seminar, Health Minister Zhang Wenkang also noted
that the cross-straits cooperation in the field of medicine and
health care "have been set back by Lee Teng-hui's fallacies".
</P>
<P>
The participants in the seminars agreed that Lee's action not
only goes against the will of all Chinese people, including the
Taiwan compatriots, for the final reunification of China, but also
harms the fundamental interests of the people of the island
province.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that, with a strong national cohesiveness, the
Chinese people are both determined to safeguard and capable of
safeguarding the territorial and sovereign integrity of China.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Recast China's Catholics Criticize Falun Gong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Members of the Chinese Catholic
community have criticized the malicious fallacies of the Falun
Gong cult and said that banning it will not adversely affect
freedom of religious beliefs and normal religious activities in
China.
</P>
<P>
Jin Luxian, a member of the Standing Committee of the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC) and honorary chairman of the Chinese Patriotic
Catholic Association, said that Falun Gong is not a religion, but
an illegal organization that is like a cult.
</P>
<P>
Jin, who is a bishop of Shanghai parish, said that Falun Gong's
founder, Li Hongzhi, used religious terminology and mixed it with
his fallacies and this is against science, civilization, the state,
and even religion. Jin said he will try to get the 140,000
Catholics in Shanghai see the essence and danger of Falun Gong to
ensure the purity of religious faith.
</P>
<P>
The ban on the Falun Gong cult is a good thing, said Luo
Guanzong, who is also a member of the Standing Committee of the
CPPCC National Committee and chairman of the Three-self Patriotic
Movement Committee of the Protestant Churches of China. He said
that this action removes a problem from society and helps
implement China's religious policy.
</P>
<P>
Cao Shengjie, the chairman of the Shanghai Assembly of Church
of Christ, voiced strong support for the ban and said that
Christians should be careful and never accept fallacies mixed with
religious expressions.
</P>
<P>
Shen Derong, the chairman of the Three-self Patriotic Movement
of the Protestant Churches of Shanghai, said that the Christians
of Shanghai support the government ban and that cults should never
be allowed in China.

<HEADLINE> Britain's Pets to Get Passports to Travel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Britain on Tuesday outlined plans
to give pets passports to travel rather than lock them in kennels
for six months.
</P>
<P>
The move spells the beginning of the end for the quarantine
system and the passport was regarded as pets' passport to freedom.
</P>
<P>
At present, animals entering the United Kingdom have to spend
up to six months in quarantine to ensure they are not carrying
rabies before they are allowed to enter from rabies-free countries.
</P>
<P>
A BBC report quoted Baroness Hayman, junior minister at the
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, as saying that the
pilot schemes will begin operating from next year and will allow
pets identified by a microchip and certified free from rabies to
travel to and from UK without the usual stay in quarantine.
</P>
<P>
Microchips containing detailed information would sit under the
animal's skin.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that initial plans limiting the scheme to
those pets spending long periods abroad have been scrapped and pet
owners will be able to take their animals on day trips.
</P>
<P>
That scheme allows owners to take their pets abroad, even on
day trips, without having to put them in quarantine for six months
on their return.
</P>
<P>
"The new arrangements will keep Britain fully protected against
rabies while letting pet owners take their cat or dog abroad,"
Baroness Hayman said.

<HEADLINE> China Building Community Health Care System For Urbanites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 3 (Xinhua) -- China plans to complete a
community-based health care system within a decade, to provide
convenient, economical and suitable medical services for urban
residents.
</P>
<P>
The massive plan, initiated by the Ministry of Health (MOH),
has won governmental backing, marked by an inter-departmental
announcement on developing urban community health care.
</P>
<P>
An MOH official said that he believed that, with the support of
the government, most urban Chinese will gradually be able to have
their ailments treated easily at home or at neighborhood clinics,
instead of having to queue at major hospitals.
</P>
<P>
"It is our goal to make medical service more accessible to,
inexpensive and effective for ordinary people by emphasizing the
role of the community," said Liu Keling, deputy director of the
Department of Community Health Care and Maternal and Child Health.
</P>
<P>
The official acknowledged that at present a large number of
urbanites are unable to enjoy convenient basic medical services,
since 80 percent of medical resources have been put into big
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
A survey of several provincial-level hospitals show that about
65 percent of 1,450 outpatient cases and 77 percent of 1,100
hospital admission cases are actually unnecessary, and can be
dealt with in local communities.
</P>
<P>
The community health care network will be composed of community
health care centers and stations, and general practitioners. The
services will be mainly provided to women, children and the
elderly, patients with chronic diseases and handicapped people.
</P>
<P>
Apart from treating illnesses, general practitioners are also
responsible for disease prevention, health promotion,
rehabilitation, health education and family planning services.
</P>
<P>
Liu Keling said that experiments are being carried out in some
70 cities, including Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin. The nationwide
network is expected to be functional within the next ten years.
</P>
<P>
The MOH is considering establishing a series of standards and
regulations to monitor and control the service quality of
community health care, she noted.

stoppage, including some 50 in Dhaka and about 20 in Chittagong.
</P>
<P>
The Independent newspaper said about 50 persons were detained
Monday by police for "creating anarchy" and "damaging public
property."
</P>
<P>
About 5,000 riot police and paramilitary Bangladesh Rifle
forces were deployed at different important points in the capital,
and the ruling Awami League and its front organization brought out
anti-strike processions in the city to protest the strike.
</P>
<P>
The opposition alliance, comprising the Bangladesh Nationalist
Party, the Jatiya Party, the Jamaat-e-Islami and the Islami Oikya
Jote, started the strike, the eighth of its kind this year, to
protest against the government's decision last week giving
"corridor to India in the name of transshipment."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a mass rally in northwestern Sirajganj district
Tuesday, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina accused the opposition, by
calling the strike, of designing to destroy the prospects of
earning foreign exchange and creating jobs through the
transshipment facilities to India.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 3 (Xinhua) -- At least 50 people were killed in
recent ethnic clashes in Nigeria's southwest Ondo state.
</P>
<P>
The death toll, caused by a renewed fighting erupted last week
between the Ilaje and Ijaw communities in Ondo Sate, was confirmed
by the delegates from both ethnic groups meeting at the state
governor's office Monday, the Daily Times newspaper reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Pastor Oyekan Arije, leader of the Ilaje delegates, said at the
 meeting that the trouble started when the Ijaws refused to vacate
villages and towns belonging to his people, which were taken over
during last year's crisis.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Pere Camfo, president of the Ijaw National
Youth Council, accused the Ilaje youths of attacking the Ijaws and
trying to overrun Oroto and Ajapa in Ijaw kingdom. He threatened
an all-out war against the Ilajes if they do not stop their
killings.
</P>
<P>
State Governor Ade Adefarati had made a broadcast speech at the
 weekend calling on both sides to cease hostilities and embrace
dialog to resolve their differences.
</P>
<P>
The fight, in which sophisticated weapons were used, began at
an Ijaw town last week and spread quickly to other nearby
communities.

<HEADLINE> China's Christian Leaders Support Falun Gong Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Christian leaders in China are
criticizing the Falun Gong cult and its founder Li Hongzhi and
saying that the ban will not affect the country's freedom of
religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
Ding Guangxun, the vice-chairman of the National Committee of
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and
honorary chairman of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee
of the Protestant Churches of China, said that he was outraged by
Li Hongzhi and his conduct and how he took advantage of people's
worry about aging and death. Li dreamed up Falun Gong and deceived
a lot of the naive and innocent people, he said, and Li's "
Doomsday" idea conflicts sharply with patriotism and the current
drive to build a socialist country with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
Banning Falun Gong will not affect the country's freedom of
religious beliefs and the ban has shown the government's
protection of religious activities, he said.
</P>
<P>
Han Wenzao, the president of the China Christian Council, said
that Falun Gong is actually a cult. It preaches about "Doomsday"
and denies that it is an organization and forbids followers to see
doctors and take medicine, he said, and council members hope that
religious people will learn a lesson from this and increase their
ability to recognize various cults.
</P>
<P>
Chen Zemin, the vice-president of the council, said that the
ban on Falun Gong was necessary and came at a good time and that
the council supports the government's action.

<P>
MANILA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada Tuesday launched a group of new infrastructure projects
in Cebu, southern Philippines, in a bid to boost the economy
there.
</P>
<P>
The batch of projects worth 136 million pesos (3.4 million U.S.
dollars) are released for both Cebu city and Cebu province,
Philippine News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an official gathering in the city of Cebu, Estrada,
who is paying a three-day visit there, said the money will fund
farm-to-market roads, bridges, hospitals and medical equipment and
waterworks systems.
</P>
<P>
The president said the farm-to-market roads and bridges are
necessary for farmers in far-flung areas to transport their
produce to the market. Waterworks projects, on the other hand,
will provide clean potable water to rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The newly-launched infrastructure projects, he said, are
manifestation of his administration's support to sustain Cebu's
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Before his speech, agrarian reform officials distributed
certificates of land ownership to beneficiaries of the agrarian
reform program.

<HEADLINE> Machinery, Electronic Exports Grow in First Half Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Exports of Chinese machinery and
electronic products grew 9.7 percent to 33.26 billion U.S. dollars
in the first half of this year, according to the latest statistics
released by the General Administration of Customs.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the Customs' foreign trade department said that
the 10.4 percent growth of technology-extensive electronic goods,
machinery and instruments, accounting for 90 percent of machinery
and electronic exports, shows that the structure of exports of
such products has been further improved.
</P>
<P>
The statistics show that the exports of high-tech electronics,
aircraft, mobile phones and air-conditioners exceeded three fifths
of the total.
</P>
<P>
The export situation of state-run enterprises has taken a
favorable turn, while foreign-funded enterprises have maintained a
stable increase in exports of machinery and electronic goods.
</P>
<P>
Exports of machinery and electronic products to North America
maintained a high growth rate of 16.3 percent, while those to
Europe and Oceania grew by seven percent and 16 percent,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
China has boosted the amounts of such exports to Asia,
especially to the Republic of Korea and ASEAN countries, in the
same period. However, its exports to Africa and Latin America went
down 5.1 percent and 6.8 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, Shanghai, Jiangsu and Tianjin
witnessed a more than 20 percent growth in exports of machinery
and electronic products. Guangdong Province, which accounts for
half of China's exports of such products, enjoyed an increase
again after months of decline in such exports.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Protests to U.N. over U.S.-British Bombardment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has protested against the
continuation of the U.S.-British warplanes bombardment of its
residential areas, killing civilians and destructing civil
facilities.
</P>
<P>
In a letter sent to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
Iraq's Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf demanded that
Annan intervene to stop such aggressive acts which scare
civilians and destroy public and private properties, the Iraqi
News Agency reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Sahhaf said that last Thursday and Friday, the U.S. and
Britain committed horrible crimes in northern and southern Iraq
in their bombardment of civil and service installations, which
killed 17 civilians and injured dozens of others.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the areas are vacant of any military target,
which means the bombing was basically aiming at causing more harm
to civilians and scaring them.
</P>
<P>
Those air attacks fully contradict the U.N. Charter and
international law and are flagrant violation of the sovereignty
of an independent state, he added.
</P>
<P>
Since the U.S. and Britain launched airstrikes against Iraq
last December, their warplanes have been regularly attacking Iraqi
military and civilian targets in no-fly zones, causing severe
civilian casualties and property damages.
</P>
<P>
"At a time Iraq condemns such recurrent criminal acts, it
demands you (Annan) intervene to the U.S. and Britain to stop
such acts," Sahhaf stressed.
</P>
<P>
The no-fly zones were imposed on Iraq by the U.S.-led western
allies following the 1991 Gulf War with the claimed aim of
protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the
south from possible attacks by the government troops.
</P>
<P>
Sahhaf said that Iraq holds all states either those who
launched the attacks or those countries from whose territories
the jet fighters take off such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Turkey,
responsible for the damages Iraq sustained.
</P>
<P>
He affirmed that Iraq has firm right to compensation for the
damages it sustained due to such criminal acts.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Buddhists Support Falun Gong Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Buddhist leaders have
given their support to the campaign against Falun Gong and say
they will help maintain social stability.
</P>
<P>
Jamyang Losang Jigme Tubdain Qoigyi Nyima, vice-president of
the Buddhist Association of China, accused of Li Hongzhi and Falun
Gong under his control of spreading feudalism and superstition
under the guise of teaching qigong and of taking advantage of
people's desire to stay healthy.
</P>
<P>
Li deceived many followers and caused some people to go insane
and has ruined many families, Jamyang said, pointing out that he
took the Buddhist term "Falun" as a title for his illegal
organization and people should keep an eye out for his evil
purpose.
</P>
<P>
Sheng Hui, vice-president of the Buddhist Association of China,
says that Falun Gong not only deceived many people, but infringed
upon the freedom of religious belief of people.
</P>
<P>
Li Hongzhi got followers to attack Party and government
headquarters and press organizations and violated the law and
caused serious damage to social stability, Sheng says.
</P>
<P>
Ming Shan, also vice-president of the Buddhist Association of
China, says that the true face of Li Hongzhi and Falun Gong have
been exposed and that people now have a clearer understanding of
Li's motive, which was to defraud people of their money and
undermine social stability.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese will fight any behavior that undermines social
stability, ethnic unity, and national reunification and the three
Buddhist leaders praised the Falun Gong ban, calling it a wise
decision. It is the Party's and the government's way of protecting
legitimate religious groups and normal religious activities, they
said.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Reject Putting off Wye Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinians have categorically
rejected an Israeli proposal to put off the implementation of the
Wye Accord and to combine part of the agreement with the final
status talks.
</P>
<P>
Secretary General of the Palestine Liberation Organization
Executive Committee Mahmoud Abbas said there was no justification
for delaying troops withdrawal for several months, Voice of
Palestine radio reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Abbas, who is also known as Abu Mazen, made the remarks in
response to Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's proposal to start
the remaining two stages of troops withdrawal on October 1.
</P>
<P>
The three-stage troops withdrawal from another 13.1 percent of
the West Bank stipulated under the Wye Accord should have been
finished by the end of January. But the agreement was suspended in
early December by former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu only
after the first-stage pullout.
</P>
<P>
Abbas expressed astonishment that the ruling Israeli Labor
Party, which had opposed Netanyahu's delay in enforcing the Wye
agreement, was now attempting to delay and evade the firm and
complete implementation of the agreement with the pretext of
integrating certain articles with the final settlement
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Abbas pointed out that Palestinians demand adamantly
enforcement of the Wye accord in letter and spirit.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians, he added, were not in favor of introducing
any amendments, postponement or integration as proposed by the
Israeli government.

<HEADLINE> HK to Outsource Two-Thirds of IT Projects by 2001 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 3 (Xinhua) -- An official in charge of
information technology sector appealed to commercial firms to take
part in the Hong Kong government's outsourcing efforts by
submitting tender proposals.
</P>
<P>
Lau Kam-hung, director of Information Technology Services of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), told a
seminar on tendering procedures for Information Technology (IT)
providers that the government was eager to receive tender offers
of high standard at competitive prices.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to greatly increase the number of tenders on offer for
IT providers," Lau said.
</P>
<P>
The HKSAR government has set an ambitious target to outsource
over two-thirds of all IT projects by the year 2001 with a view to
fostering the growth of the local IT industry. The target could
only be achieved with the full cooperation of IT firms of all
sizes, according to Lau.
</P>
<P>
He said the government intends to make sure that small and
medium sized firms can participate fully on equal terms in future
tendering exercises, he said, adding that they will not play
favorites.
</P>
<P>
"We will look at things like the size and duration of projects
to make sure that all firms in the industry, regardless of size,
have a genuine opportunity to compete for future opportunities,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Lau said that outsourcing of government IT projects was not
just a way of providing more and better IT for government
departments and faster than the government could do it on its own.
</P>
<P>
"It is also a way for us to boost the IT industry by increasing
the demand for its services," he said.
</P>
<P>
The new task of his department includes enhancing IT
infrastructure and technical standards throughout Hong Kong, and
promoting the use of IT in the community generally, Lau said.

of the country's former speaker of the House of Representatives
Alhaji Buhari over allegations of perjury and forgery, the
Guardian newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The current edition of the "Tell" magazine shocked the west
African country's capital Monday by accusing Enwerem of an alleged
criminal conviction.
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers severally discussed the publication in tones that
suggest a determination to have the senate president clear himself
of the allegations as the National Assembly resumes Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Senate leader Abdallah Wali however, declined to comment on the
 allegation Monday, but sources hinted of a likelihood of the
legislators discussing the issue at caucus levels before it gets
to the chamber.
</P>
<P>
While Enwerem was being expected Monday from his Imo State home
where he was accorded a civic reception at the weekend, some
senators who had arrived in Abuja got concerned that an
explanation would be desirable in the interest of credibility of
the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Senator Adamu Fanda said: "We at the House of Representatives
will move a motion calling for the establishment of a communique
of the House of Representatives that will look into the veracity
of these allegations raised against the senate president.
</P>
<P>
"We are making this for two reasons. First, in any joint
session of the National Assembly, it is the president of the
Senate that presides. So invariably, he is our leader. Secondly,
we have the right as members of the National Assembly to
investigate everything that happens in this country," he
explained.
</P>
<P>
There was also concern in the ruling People's Democratic Party
(PDP) circles over the publication Monday. A senior party member
said: "We said it earlier that if this matter is true, he should
resign on health grounds. But he has denied it. Let's see how it
goes."
</P>
<P>
At a civic reception held for him at Owerri at the weekend,
Enwerem had warned against a smear campaign which he alleged was
being mounted against him. "Be on the look out and watch for
this and be assured that all blackmail against me is false," He
alerted.

<HEADLINE> Situation in Namibia's Caprivi Still Tense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The situation in the Caprivi
region in northeastern Namibia remained tense Tuesday after
Monday's violent clashes between government forces and
secessionists, South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
Schools and Businesses remained closed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Major-General Martin Shalli, chief of staff of the Namibian
Defense Force (NDF), said his force was "busy with the clean-up
operation until further notice."
</P>
<P>
Namibian President Sam Nujoma declared late Monday an
indefinite state of emergency in Caprivi's main town of Katima
Mulilo.
</P>
<P>
The state of emergency effectively gives security agencies the
power to maintain law and order by limiting people's freedom of
movement until the operation of "cleaning up" the rebels was
completed.
</P>
<P>
In a televised speech to the nation Monday, Nujoma said five
police officers, three NDF members and five rebels had been killed
in the skirmishes which started in the early hours of Monday.
</P>
<P>
Gabriel Mwalima, son-in-law of rebel leader Mashake Muyongo,
was among eight members of the Caprivi Liberation Army arrested in
the clashes.
</P>
<P>
There had been sporadic gunfire through the night in Katima
Mulilo, South African Broadcasting Corporation correspondent John
Grobler said in a radio interview Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Falls to 7.7 Percent in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's overall
inflation maintained its downward trend, falling to 7.7 percent
in June from 8.1 percent in July, an economic report issued by
the central bank has said.
</P>
<P>
The decrease is partly explained by low prices recorded in
several food items like rice, maize, beans, beef and soft drinks,
the Bank of Tanzania said in its latest monthly economic review
available Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The bank noted that the rate of inflation was slightly below
the set target of 7.5 percent, but is hopeful to reach five
percent by June, 2000 in view of the improving food supply
situation, coupled with the implementation of prudent monetary
and fiscal policies.
</P>
<P>
During the month, food situation in the country improved due to
the ongoing harvest season. By the end of June, the Strategic
Grain Reserve stock reached 22,929.8 tons, representing an
increase of 42.8 percent from the stocks in May.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the report said Tanzania's total
external debt arrived at 7.97 billion U.S. dollars, decreasing 0.6
percent from the previous month.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's Law Body to Function as Int'l Arbitration Institution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore Academy of Law
(SAL) has taken over the responsibility for the Singapore
International Arbitration Center (SIAC) with effect from August 3,
1999, the government stated in a press release Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The government said this transfer of arbitration function from
the Economic Development Board and the Trade Development of
Singapore is designed to further enhance arbitration as a method
of alternative dispute resolution within the legal framework of
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Remaining as an independent institution under the aegis of the
Singapore Academy of Law and functioning as a separate entity from
the Singapore Mediation Center (SMC), which promotes mediation and
provides mediation service, SIAC will continue to operate under
the legal framework set up in Singapore for the conduct of
international arbitration and enforcement of wards, it added.
</P>
<P>
International parties can therefore have their arbitration
cases decided here in accordance with the Model Law on
International Commercial Arbitration as adopted by the United
Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) and other
well-recognized rules, it noted.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1991, SIAC facilitates resolution of disputes
through arbitration in international cases as well as domestic
cases. International arbitration cases involving non-Singaporean
parties account for 70 percent of SIAC's caseload.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Committed to Eradicating Campus Cultism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Education Minister Tunde
Adeniran has declared that the federal government would not extend
the three-month ultimatum given vice-chancellors and other heads
of tertiary institutions to stamp out campus cultism in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Adeniran who spoke in Ibadan, capital of Nigeria's western Oyo
state over the weekend, said the government had carried out its
independent investigation and was sure that the menace could be
eradicated within the stipulated time if the authorities of the
institutions committed themselves to doing it, the Guardian
newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Although the minister declined comments on what reprisals
awaited university authorities if they failed in the mission, he
declared that "the three-month deadline is very, very feasible."
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, the government read the riot act to university
authorities after the gruesome murder of seven students of the
Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife by suspected cult members.

<P>
SINGAPORE, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Selective buying of finance
stocks brought the key Straits Times Index (STI) up although share
prices were broadly lower on the Singapore Stock Market Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark STI rebounded by 14.72 points to end at 2,143.37,
nearly offsetting the 17.12-point fall Monday.
</P>
<P>
The total volume contracted to 220.22 million shares worth
467.37 million Singapore dollars (277.70 million U.S. dollars).
Falls outnumbered rises by 226 to 77 with 141 counters unchanged.
</P>
<P>
DelMonte remained at top of the volume list with a turnover of
14.62 million shares. It was followed by Aztech which had 14.39
million units done. AFP was the next with 10.54 million counters
changing hands.
</P>
<P>
DBS F topped the actives chart as it surged up 90 cents to
close at 22.00 Singapore dollars. SPH and Venture climbed up 80
cents to finish at 30.60 and 14.80 Singapore dollars respectively.
SPH 100 picked up 60 cents to end at 30.60 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>

dropping 50 cents to close at 17.70 Singapore dollars. PacCent
shed 40 cents to finish at 5.80 Singapore dollars. Asean sank 25
cents to end at 9.00 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
Brokers noted that electronic stocks were higher after the
Natsteel Electronics Monday reported strong profit growth for the
first half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
They also said the bank shares were trading stronger led by the
DBS local and foreign shares and OCBC F.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said as there are little fresh leads to encourage the
market sentiment, investors remained largely passive and many are
waiting for more corporate earning results before venturing back.
</P>
<P>
Worries about a possible interest-rate hike continued to be a
factor keeping institutional investors on the sidelines.

<HEADLINE> Falun Gong Practitioners Break Away From Cult </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Many practitioners of Falun Gong
have awakened to the evil of the banned organization and have come
to see Li Hongzhi's scheme and how they were fooled.
</P>
<P>
Wang Shengli, a retired cadre in the city of Fuyang in east
China's Anhui Province, was a Falun Gong practitioner and a local
leader in the illegal organization, but he has given his support
to the ban.
</P>
<P>
He says that, after watching the CCTV special report on Li
Hongzhi, he got a clearer understanding of Falun Gong and its evil
political purposes. Wang has helped local governments teach people
to break away from Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
Wang is just one of thousands of former Falun Gong
practitioners who have changed their minds since the central
government declared Falun Gong to be an illegal organization on
July 22 and banned it.
</P>
<P>
Relatives of Falun Gong practitioners in northwest China's
Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region have accused Falun Gong of cheating
people out of their money and of causing deaths. A large number of
former Falun Gong practitioners were drawn into the organization
because of its claims about being able to cure diseases, but, this
turned out not to be true. Several Falun Gong practitioners in
Yinchuan, the capital of Ningxia, refused to go to hospital when
they were ill because of their deep faith in Li Hongzhi, and some
lost their lives because of this. Falun Gong was the real culprit,
their family members say.

<HEADLINE> Two Million People In Northern China Out of Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Another 2.14 million people in
north China's Shanxi Province have got away from poverty in the
past few years thanks to poverty-assistance projects, local
officials say.
</P>
<P>
Living in poverty means an annual income of less than 500 yuan.
There were 250 million people in rural China living below the
poverty line in 1978. That figure fell to 42 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The number of people in Shanxi living in poverty in 1993 was 3.
81 million. They were mostly in 50 counties in the Taihang and
Luliang mountain areas, where natural conditions are harsh and
infrastructure backward.
</P>
<P>
The central and local governments, over the past decade, have
allocated some 2 billion yuan (240 million U.S. dollars) for land
reclamation, road and irrigation system construction, and tree
planting. Infrastructure like roads, telecommunications,
electricity, education, and water supplies have always been the
focus of poverty-relief projects.

<HEADLINE> China Changing State Firms' Debt Into Equity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Wang Wanbin, vice-minister of the
State Economic and Trade Commission (SETC), told a news conference
here today that a special company has been set up by the
government to clean up bad debts.
</P>
<P>
The Cinda Assets Management Corp. has already begun helping the
China Construction Bank to write off bad loans and three similar
assets management companies are being set up.
</P>
<P>
These financial assets management companies will manage bad
loans of commercial banks and change part of them for equity of
certain firms. They will hold the shares of these firms for a
period of time and have a say in their decision-making process.
When their efficiency improves, the management companies can
withdraw their shares.
</P>
<P>
Wang did not provide greater details about the amount of debt
to be converted to equity, but said that it will be determined by
the actual operations of the asset management companies and the
application process.
</P>
<P>
Priority will be given to large state-owned enterprises that
were of strategic importance or involved in key construction
projects, Wang said, adding that it is very important to eliminate
financial risk and relieve the burden of enterprises and to
seriously select and check out candidates.
</P>
<P>
SETC has revealed the requirements for applying, which include
having products with market potential, advanced equipment or
technology, a comparatively high management level, and competent
managers and leaders.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Members of the Chinese Catholic
community have criticized the malicious fallacies of the Falun
Gong cult and say that banning it will not adversely affect
freedom of religious freedom and normal religious activities in
China.
</P>
<P>
Jin Luxian, a member of the Standing Committee of the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC) and honorary chairman of the Chinese Patriotic
Catholic Association, says that Falun Gong is not a religion, but
an illegal organization that is like a cult.
</P>
<P>
Jin, who is a bishop of Shanghai parish, said that Falun Gog's
founder, Li Hongzhi, used religious termilogy and mixed it with
his fallacies and this is against science, civilization, the state,
and even religion. Jin said he will try to get the 140,000
Catholics in Shanghai see the essence and danger of Falun Gong to
ensure the purity of religious faith.
</P>
<P>
The ban on the Falun Gong cult is a good thing, said Luo
Guanzong, who is also a member of the Standing Committee of the
CPPCC National Committee and chairman of the Three-self Patriotic
Movement Committee of the Protestant Churches of China. He said
that this action removes a problem from society and helps
implement China's religious policy.
</P>
<P>
Cao Shengjie, the chairman of the Shanghai Assembly of Church
of Christ, voiced strong support for the ban and said that
Christians should be careful and never accept fallacies mixed with
religious expressions.
</P>
<P>
Shen Derong, the chairman of the Three-self Patriotic Movement
of the Protestant Churches of Shanghai, said that the Christians
of Shanghai support the government ban and that cults should never
be allowed in China.

<P>
HANGZHOU, August 3 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese man has become the
first person in China to be sentenced to jail and fined for
software copyright infringement.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Zhuhai, a boom city in south China'
s Guangdong Province bordering Macao, started a three-day
investment and trade fair here Tuesday to solicit more funds from
Macao investors and boost trade between the two places.
</P>
<P>
Investment projects are being publicized and novel products
shown at the fair which is organized by the people's government of
Zhuhai, a special economic zone which attracts investors with its
appealing environment and extensive business opportunities.
</P>
<P>
More than 300 business people from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan
and many places around the world were invited to the fair.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the fair will strengthen economic and trade
cooperation between Zhuhai and Macao and bring about benefits to
the two places as Macao is returning to the motherland in just 139
days," said Zhou Benhui, a vice-mayor of Zhuhai.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Macao business people have started nearly
1,800 projects in Zhuhai since China's reform and opening-up in
1978. The figure accounted for 33.26 percent of all projects with
the participation of investors outside Zhuhai.
</P>
<P>
Macao also acts as a major entrepot for exported goods from
Zhuhai to other parts of the world, and an important link to
bolster the ties between Zhuhai and business people from Taiwan.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Holds Informal Meeting With Major Political Parties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J. Habibie
Tuesday held an informal meeting with leaders of political parties
which won seats in the House of Representatives and the General
Elections Commission (KPU) leaders.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Habibie said he has approved the results of
the vote count finalized by the Indonesian Election Committee
(PPI) on July 15.
</P>
<P>
The head of state said the reform agenda should run smoothly as
mandated by the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) during its
special session late last year.
</P>
<P>
"There is the main agenda of reform that should be carried out.
Thus in this forum, as mandated by the MPR special session in
1998, I declare that the results of the vote count are valid," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the MPR gave him the mandate and responsibility
to carry out the general election, Habibie said he wants to see
the agenda implemented on schedule.
</P>
<P>
Habibie further said that the MPR's general session later this
year could not be postponed.
</P>
<P>
"A postponement would only draw various interpretations and
speculations," he said.
</P>
<P>
The MPR, the country's highest decision-making body, will meet
in November to elect the country's next president.
</P>
<P>
On the general election, Habibie acknowledged that it had some
weaknesses, but said they were not substantial.
</P>
<P>
He urged officials involved in the implementation of the
election to take legal measures against election violations.
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary to settle the problems so they will not become
bad examples for the next election," he said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended by National Awakening Party Chairman
Matori Abdul Jalil, Crescent and Star Party Chairman Jusril Ihza
Mahendra, Golkar Party Chairman Akbar Tanjung and other political
party leaders.
</P>
<P>
Chairwoman of the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle
(PDI-P) Megawati Soekarnoputri and General Chairman of the
National Mandate Party (PAN) Amien Rais did not attend the
informal meeting.
</P>
<P>
The PPI concluded the vote count on July 15, giving the bulk of
the 462 seats at stake to five major parties. The main opposition
PDI-P won with 33.74 percent of votes, outnumbering the ruling
Golkar Party, which trailed with 22.44 percent.
</P>
<P>
Trailing in third place is the National Awakening Party with
12.61 percent, followed by the United Development Party (10.71
percent) and PAN (7.12 percent).
</P>
<P>
According to calculations by national newspapers, PDI-P is
expected to get 154 seats in the House of Representatives and
Golkar 120. Many of the smaller parties will not gain any seats in
the new parliament.
</P>
<P>
Forty-eight political parties took part in the election to
compete for 462 of the 500 seats in the House of Representatives
(DPR). The remaining 38 seats are reserved for the military, whose
members do not vote.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Parliament Laments First Lady's Death, Defers MPs' Questions Over President's Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's parliament Tuesday
lamented the death of the country's First Lady Mrs. Ong Teng
Cheong and deferred MPs' questions over remarks by the president
two weeks ago about problems with the government.
</P>
<P>
At Tuesday's sitting, the parliament observed a two-minute
silence in memory of the first lady on a special motion by Prime
Minister Goh Chok Tong to express condolences to President Ong and
his family.
</P>
<P>
Goh said the president had lost his dear wife and the hearts of
Singaporeans went out to him.
</P>
<P>
Parliament members from both the ruling and opposition parties
and of different ethnic origins spoke in praise of Mrs. Ong's
virtue of unfailing kindness and graciousness to others, her
bravery in fighting the illness and her dedication to her family,
the people and the country.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Ong died of colon cancer last Friday after a two-and-half
years' battle with the disease and her body was cremated Tuesday
afternoon with a long procession attending the funeral.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the parliament deferred to a later sitting an oral
answer to questions by MPs on remarks by the president at his July
16 news conference.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference President Ong Teng Cheong, while
announcing he would not run for another presidential term, talked
about problems with the government as he tried to define his role
as guardian of the country's reserves.
</P>
<P>
Financial Minister Richard Hu, speaking on behalf of the prime
minister, affirmed that the government was going to make a
ministerial statement on the issue.
</P>
<P>
But the ministerial statement was postponed in view of the
death of Mrs. Ong.
</P>
<P>
Hu asked the speaker of the parliament to defer the MPs'
questions until after the issuing of the statement so that the
comments could be put in their proper context.

LUANDA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Angolan government troops have

UNITA rebels also attacked last week the region of Monte Belo,
100 kilometers to Benguela, capital of Benguela Province in

victims on their way to a field while looking for food.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Anti-narcotics police have
arrested 20 suspects who were transporting 120 stones of bhang in
Nakuru town, the capital of Rift Valley Province in Central Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The suspects who were arrested over the weekend also
transported almost 1,000 liters of illegal chang'aa (a kind of
traditionally-brew liquor), according to Nakuru Police Chief
Andrew Kimoetto.
</P>
<P>
The East African Standard newspaper quoted the police chief as
saying that the suspects were flushed out of the public transport
vehicles along the Nakuru-Nairobi Highway.
</P>
<P>
The police boss said the officers stopped the vehicles at
random and found the contraband cargo being ferried to Nairobi,
the capital of Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Kimoetto also said that on Friday night, the police also netted
365 liters of chang'aa and held 10 suspects in connection with the
illicit brew, adding that another suspect was arrested as he tried
to ferry 72 stones of bhang to Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the police in Kenya's Eastern Province discovered
more than 1, 500 acres of land are under bhang plantations in
Mount Kenya forest as police are intensifying operations to rid
the forest of drug farms.

<P>
PARIS, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- In an interview with the first issue of the U.S. monthly "
Talk", Hillary Clinton made her "intimate confession" about her
husband. She said that "Bill" was traumatized when he was four
years old, being caught between the conflict of two women -- his
mother and his grand-mother. This was the root for the "weak
points" of his personal life, she said.
</P>
<P>
-- The Palestinians have been annoyed by the evasiveness of
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who promised to apply --
belatedly -- the Wye Plantation Agreements from September and to
pull out troops from West Bank from October. Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat said on Monday that he has suspected for a long time
that Israel was trying to "escape a complete application" of the
Wye agreements and was trying to elude some engagements it has
made.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Commenting on the latest peak of ozone air pollution
suffered by several regions in France, French Minister of
Environment Dominique Voynet said that government officials and
parliament deputies should provide people with full information on
pollution as a priority of their work. She also suggested that the
people traveling in the current summer vacation season should use
public transport facilities to alleviate pollution.
</P>
<P>
-- One year after coming to power for re-establishing peace in
his country, Colombia's conservative president Andres Pastrana was
unable to put under control different armed gangs, including left-
wing guerrillas, an armed Christian group claiming at the same
time to be the admirers of Che Guevara, narcotic barons and drug
traffickers.

<HEADLINE> Many New Zealand Students Skip Breakfast: Surveys </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 3 (Xinhua) -- An alarming third of New
Zealand teenagers are going to school without breakfast, the most
important meal of the day, with the worst offenders being girls,
according to two surveys which were released here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The surveys show that 76,000 children aged between 13 and 17
skip breakfast because they don't have enough time or they just
don't feel like it.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand's leading dietitian and nutritionist Jeni Pearce
said in the surveys that the high level of breakfast skipping
among youngsters should be of great concern to parents, teachers
and children themselves.
</P>
<P>
The surveys, she said, clearly indicate "there is a lack of
understanding and a large amount of misinformation among
adolescents about the importance of breakfast for optimum mental
and physical development."
</P>
<P>
"Breakfast is the one meal of the day that should not be
skipped, especially by growing teenagers.
</P>
<P>
"Breakfast kick-starts the brain and improves mental and
physical performance and actually helps maintain a healthy body
weight," Pearce said.
</P>
<P>
The results of the surveys came from 299 interviews with
adolescents aged 13 to 17 years. Questionnaires were also sent to
every school principals in New Zealand, asking them why they
thought their students were skipping breakfast and what they
thought the main effects were.

<HEADLINE> Intel Develops New Processors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Intel Corporation Monday
introduced two new processors, one for mainstream computing and
the other for low-end personal computers.
</P>
<P>
The chip giant, which has been embracing the Internet and
fighting for both high- and low-end market, said that the Pentium
III processor 600 MHz was developed for powerful Internet and
mainstream computing, and the Celeron processor was for PCs priced
around 1,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Pentium III processor 600 MHz delivers Intel's highest
levels of performance, longevity and investment protection for
today's and tomorrow's computing needs, the company said.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Forbes earlier this year, Intel CEO Craig
Barrett revealed his company's strategy of developing networking
chips, which fall into three functional categories. Interface
chips connect networking gear to the information umbilical cord of
fiber or copper. Processing chips act on the data directly by
deciphering, for instance, whether data are coming or going.
</P>
<P>
And controller chips help manage how a company network
functions by setting such policies as whose bits have top priority
and which data need special protection.

MOGADISHU, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Violent armed clashes between
rival militiamen spread to the Karan district of North Mogadishu
late Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Five people including a woman were killed and 15 others were
wounded in the exchange of the heavy gunfire outside the capital
when Muse Sudi Yalahow's militiamen extorted money from an armed
militia escorted vehicle transporting commercial goods from
El-Ma'an natural port. The escort militiamen had refused to pay
the money which resulted in fighting.
</P>
<P>
Well armed militiamen from both sides using battle wagons,
Russian-made anti-tank B-10 guns, rocket propelled grenades, heavy
machine guns and assault rifles exchanged fire in the area.
</P>
<P>
Hussein Mohamed Addow, one of the main politicians of North
Mogadishu, together with various other politicians and traditional
leaders called the warring sides Monday night to an emergence
meeting to discuss ways to end the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Addow told reporters later that a cease-fire agreement has been
reached.
</P>
<P>
The security situation in North Mogadishu has been the worst in
the capital in the past few months after the collapse of the
strong Islamic court following the decree that sacked its
chairman two years ago. However, Islamic courts operating in
South Mogadishu have seriously curbed down the activities of the
bandits.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The People's Bank of China (PBOC)
and the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation jointly
issued guidelines today encouraging banks to support Chinese
business development overseas.
</P>
<P>
A bank spokesman said that the guidelines aim to increase
exports and encourage China's light industry and textile, home
appliance, garment, and other manufacturers to develop processing
companies and assemblies overseas, using raw materials from China.
</P>
<P>
He said that, with the improvements in the economy and the
development of foreign trade and economic cooperation, processing
and assembly overseas are becoming increasingly important for
China's exports.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines say that commercial banks and the China Export
and Import Bank should give active support to these businesses
overseas and that long- and short-term loans are available for
purchasing equipment, technology, raw materials, and other items.
</P>
<P>
Processing and assembly businesses overseas that are making a
profit can pay less interest on the bank loans. Banks have been
asked to improve management of these loans to improve the quality
of their assets.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Tourist Arrivals Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Australia's tourist arrivals in
the first half of 1999 rose six percent over the same period of
1998 due largely to better financial times in Asia, a senior
official said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Australia Tourist Commission Chief John Morse said the
half-yearly rise showed the industry was bouncing back.
</P>
<P>
Morse said in a statement that arrivals out of the
financially-embattled Asia showed bullish growth.
</P>
<P>
Arrivals from Indonesia from January to the end of June are up
nearly 18 percent on last year, South Korea is up an
"extraordinary" 87 percent, Malaysia up 30 percent and Thailand "a
very pleasing" 49 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, key traditional market regions such as Europe and
the Americas both recorded very healthy growth, up 7.6 percent and
10.6 percent respectively, he said.
</P>
<P>
"And arrivals from New Zealand, Australia's second largest
market, rose a creditable 3.2 percent on the same period in 1998,"
Morse added.
</P>
<P>
The only cloud over the figures was provided by Australia's
largest market, Japan, which fell 5.5 percent despite a recent
economic upturn, he said.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary data released on Tuesday by the Australian Bureau
of Statistics showed that in June 1999, 368,600 short-term
visitors arrived in Australia, a seasonally adjusted decline of
1,200 on the previous month.
</P>
<P>
The bureau's figures also showed a nine percent increase in the
number of young Australians aged between 18 and 34 travelling
overseas for holidays in 1998 compared to 1997.

<HEADLINE> Appointment Letter From Falun Gong Head Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, August 3 (Xinhua) -- One of the three letters of
appointment from Li Hongzhi, head of the Falun Gong cult, an
illegal organization, was found recently in Shanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Li Hongzhi gave them to three people in the provincial capital,
Taiyuan, to appoint them leaders of the city's Falun Gong branch.
Provincial Public Security Bureau officials say that these letters
prove that Falun Gong is well organized.
</P>
<P>
The two other appoint letters were burned by the appointees.
</P>
<P>
The Public Security Bureau in China's Hunan Province has
obtained a list of addresses of Falun Gong leaders in the province,
according to a Bureau official.
</P>
<P>
He says that the list has names of members in 13 cities and
prefectures in Hunan and proves that Falun Gong is a tightly run
organization.
</P>
<P>
Falun Gong has said that it doesn't have any organization and
that it is managed in a loose way, but the evidence gathered by
public security departments in Hunan shows the opposite to be true.
</P>
<P>
It also shows that every Falun Gong branch has an organization
with propaganda, training, organization, and administration
sections, each with a clear duty. These branches cooperate and
communicate in a way that helped Falun Gong expand in such a short
period of time.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the Sichuan Province Public Security Bureau say
that Falun Gong also has reserve forces, whose purpose is to avoid
investigation by public security departments and to continue the
illegal activities.

The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Less than a week after their second summit, Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian National Authority Chairman
Yasser Arafat traded barbs on Monday about the implementation of
the Wye accord.
</P>
<P>
Infuriated by Barak's insistence on skipping one of the two
West Bank troop pullbacks mandated by the Wye accord, Arafat
accused him of trying to break peace agreements. Barak then warned
Arafat he is being too rigid and Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy accused the Palestinians of "creating drama."
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Barak will meet Tuesday afternoon with top economists from
the business world and academia to find ways to improve the

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Have Stricter Control of CDs, Cassettes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam is to make more efforts to
crack down on the illegal trading, production and reproduction of
compact disc (CD) and cassettes.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's Ministry of Culture and Information is expected to
issue new rules next month to restore order to the chaotic
audio-video cassette tape and compact disc (CD) market, according
to a report of Vietnam's English business newspaper The Saigon
Times Daily on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Performance Arts Department of Vietnam's Ministry of
Culture and Information would supervise the production, trading,
import and distribution of tapes and CDs, said the director of the
ministry's Law Department.
</P>
<P>
The department would seal stamps on products whose content is
not prohibited. After this, the products could be distributed
without having to go through censorship agencies.
</P>
<P>
Only businesses licensed to operate in this sector can import
audio-video tapes and CDs. And this still requires permission from
the ministry's Planing Department or city or provincial culture
and information authorities.
</P>
<P>
More than 20,000 illicit audio-video tapes and CDs have been
seized since the country launched a campaign on July 24 to crack
down on the illegal trading, production and reproduction of these
items.

<HEADLINE> Israel, PNA to Coordinate Millennium Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Israel and the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) are planning a joint campaign to prepare
for the expected flood of pilgrims at Christian sites during the
millennium year.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials are concerned about the overcrowding at the
most popular sites, like the Church of the Holy Sepulcher in
Jerusalem, the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem, and the
baptismal sites along the Jordan River, local daily The Jerusalem
Post said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We have prepared plans for tourists to visit other places
besides these three," said Shlomo Dror, spokesman for the
government coordinator of activities in the territories.
</P>
<P>
The idea is to set up alternative tourist attractions aimed at
siphoning off the crowds as they travel through the Holy Land.
</P>
<P>
Until now, eight joint committees have been set up to deal with
the tourism coordination between Israel and the PNA.
</P>
<P>
These include committees on transportation, crossing points,
hotels, joint marketing, and safety and rescue. They are expected
to convene shortly.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, PNA Minister of Tourism Mitri Abu Aytah said
that the problem is not a paucity of sites but a lack of hotel
rooms.
</P>
<P>
"We have hundreds of tourist sites. That is not the
question. We have to develop our hotel capacity. We are expecting
a lot of people, and we hope that we will be able to work
together with the Israelis on this," Aytah said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials expect some 4 million tourists next year, who
will visit Christian sites in Israel or Palestinian-controlled
areas.
</P>
<P>
"We don't have enough rooms and there will be great traffic
jams. If we can't coordinate with the Palestinians, we will be in
trouble and the tourists will flee," Dror said.
</P>
<P>
Dror noted that just trying to coordinate the flow of buses
between Israel and the Palestinian-controlled areas was a
logistical challenge.
</P>
<P>
"We need to find other places for the tourists to go, so they
won't just be standing around," Dror said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials are also expecting a mammoth list of
dignitaries, state leaders, and even the pope to converge on the
Holy Land. One entrepreneur has even said he is planning to bring
the world's greatest tenors here for a gala concert transmitted
around the world.
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be an intense year," Dror said.

SHENZHEN, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Foodstuff shipped to Hong Kong
from the mainland via Shenzhen in Guangdong Province is perfectly
safe - this was the message at a recent conference on food safety
in Shenzhen, next door to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Food safety was thrust into the limelight on the international
stage because of the mad cow disease and dioxin contamination of
meat.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months of the year, the Shenzhen Commodity
Inspection Bureau examined 5,427 tons of milk, 20,025 tons of live
poultry, and 45,710 tons of fresh vegetables bound for Hong Kong,
worth more than 24 million U.S. dollars in all.

No food hygiene problems had been reported, the conference was

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of China's Armed Police
are prepared to fight possible floods this summer, according to
the State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
A source there said that more than ten thousand armed policemen
are fighting floodwaters along the Yangtze River. This summer,
heavy rains have hit many parts of central China, causing flooding
on the Yangtze and nearby lakes.
</P>
<P>
Armed police in Hubei, Hunan, Anhui, and Zhejiang provinces
were sent to flood areas where they helped move more than 1,000
people and 30 million tons of materials. So far this year, about
140,000 armed policemen have been involved in flood fighting at
various times in different parts of the country, many of whom have
worked for weeks without stop.
</P>
<P>
Armed police stationed along the Yellow, Huaihe, and Songhua
rivers have set up flood-fighting headquarters in their respective
areas with flood-fighting materials and some units are helping
local people patrol levees where the water is above the danger
level.

<HEADLINE> Namibia Declares State of Emergency in Caprivi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Namibian President Sam
Nujoma declared late Monday a state of emergency, including a
dusk-to-dawn curfew, in the Caprivi region where fighting erupted
between secessionists and government forces.
</P>
<P>
By late Monday, the revolt, which erupted in the remote town of
Katima Mulilo near the borders with Botswana and Zambia, appeared
to have been quelled, South Africa's The Star daily reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Rebel troops, reportedly supported by the Angolan rebel
movement National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA), were reported to be retreating toward Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The bodies of three Namibian Defense Force soldiers, two police
officers and three rebels from the so-called Caprivi Liberation
Army were due to be airlifted to Windhoek late Monday night, said
the paper.
</P>
<P>
It quoted eyewitnesses as saying that, however, there were
nearly 20 bodies, including those of civilians, at the scenes of
the battle in the business center and the nearby airport.
</P>
<P>
In a televised address to the nation, Nujoma said Namibian
forces were under strict orders to leave no stone unturned in
ensuring that peace and tranquillity returned to the Caprivi.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma said a "mop-up operation" was under way in the troubled
strip. He also announced that the building of the Namibian
Broadcasting Corporation (NBC) and other government buildings,
which the rebels have attempted to take over, had been fully
"liberated".
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses said rebels began the revolt with an attack on the
police station at Katima Mulilo shortly after 2 a.m. (0000 GMT)
Monday, shooting dead two officers and wounding four others.
</P>
<P>
An attempt to capture Mpacha airport, 20 kilometers outside the
town, was foiled by government troops.
</P>
<P>
Police and the army stormed the rebel-held NBC offices and
threw in mortars and tear gas before taking control.
</P>
<P>
Business in the town stopped and schools were closed
indefinitely while hundreds of residents huddled down, trapped in
their shops and offices as bullets and larger munitions flew
across the street.
</P>
<P>
Late Monday, the government claimed the rebels were retreating
toward the Zambian border north of the town, but some
secessionists were understood to be still holed up in the town,
the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The rebels are believed to be Caprivi secessionists led by
exiled former Democratic Turnhalle Alliance leader Mishake
Muyongo.
</P>
<P>
Muyongo, together with 11 other secessionist leaders, fled to
neighboring Botswana in October. They were granted asylum in
February this year and were later resettled in Denmark.
</P>
<P>
Some 2,500 people also crossed into Botswana last year,
claiming to be fleeing in order to avoid harassment by the
Namibian authorities. Hundreds of them have been repatriated
voluntarily to Namibia after being granted asylum.

<HEADLINE> China to Open Up Wider to Outside World: Minister (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 3 (Xinhua) -- China will continue its drive to
open up to the outside world whether it joins the World Trade
Organization (WTO) now or in the future, China's trade minister
has said.
</P>
<P>
Shi Guangsheng, minister of foreign trade and economic
cooperation (MOFTEC), made the remarks in a speech at a national
conference last week. The speech was revealed here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"China will, despite the time of its accession to the WTO,
continue to further open up to the outside world according to the
need of national economic development and the set policy of
opening up," he said. "The opening up drive will continue in an
active and steady manner."
</P>
<P>
The minister said that opening up to the outside world is a
basic policy of China, and that to achieve new breakthroughs in
the opening up process is a prerequisite and guarantee for China's
foreign trade and economic growth.
</P>
<P>
"Without opening up to the outside world, China cannot achieve
its economic prosperity," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Shi promised that China will continue to lower its customs
duties and establish an effective, flexible import coordination
mechanism. By the year 2005, the average import tariffs of
industrial goods will be cut to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Currently, China's average import tariff is 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
Non-tariff restrictions will also be reduced, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Scholars from the Chinese Academy
of Social Sciences (CASS), China's highest research institution of
literary arts, today slammed the malicious fallacies of Li Hongzhi
and the banned Falun Gong he founded.
</P>
<P>
At a seminar held here, the scholars exposed the hideous
political nature of Falun Gong and lashed out at its grave harm to
society.
</P>
<P>
Chen Junquan, research fellow with the Philosophy Institute of
the CASS, said that the Falun Dafa concocted by Li directly
contradicts modern science and civilization and is simply a
fallacy, but a very dangerous one.
</P>
<P>
He said that social scientists need to stand up and expose and
criticize these fallacies and help the people get rid of this
inanity and promote scientific and healthy ways of living in the
country.
</P>
<P>
To peddle his fallacies, Li used many religious terms,
especially from Buddhism, but anyone with any religious sense
would see that Li was plagiarizing and wantonly twisting these
terms for his own evil purposes, said Zhang Xinying, a scholar who
studies the world's religions.
</P>
<P>
What Li has been doing is against society, the state, science,
and human beings and also seriously infringes upon the rights of
conventional religions and undermines China's religious policies,
Zhang said.

Falun Gong has violated many laws and regulations and done
grave harm to society, said Xia Yong, who does research in legal

good.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Endorses Poll Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J. Habibie
Tuesday endorsed the final results from the June 7 parliamentary
election, saying the delay in endorsing the results will cause
many problems.
</P>
<P>
He said the signatories of the final tally had represented 95
percent of the total vote.
</P>
<P>
Habibie took the move after the General Elections Commission
(KPU) failed to meet its deadline for endorsing the results of the
general election.
</P>
<P>
On July 26, 27 of the 48 political parties at the KPU refused
to sign off on the final tally, saying the elections were unfair.
They cited more than 100,000 alleged irregularities in defense of
their decision.
</P>
<P>
Another 17 political parties, including all five major parties,
accepted the tally, while four abstained.
</P>
<P>
The 1999 law on general elections stipulates that elections can
only be considered valid if the results are accepted by at least
two-thirds of the 53 KPU members, which include representatives
from the 48 political parties and five government representatives.
</P>
<P>
Under these circumstances, the KPU has submitted the election
results to the president for a solution. Habibie later handed over
the case to the Election Supervisory Committee (Panwaslu) for
verification, ruling that Panwaslu would be given seven days to
finish the job.
</P>
<P>
Twelve parties have submitted their reasons for refusing to
approve the elections results until the deadline on July 29, but
others failed to do the same. The Indonesian National Party led by
Supeni and the New Indonesia Party changed their mind and signed
the poll results on Monday.
</P>
<P>
After studying those reasons, Panwaslu concluded that none of
the parties' objections were valid and reported this to Habibie
who then returned the documents to the KPU along with the
committee's call for the KPU to endorse and declare the poll's
outcome.
</P>
<P>
Ryaas Rasyid, the government liaison officer with the KPU who
is also the director-general at the Home Affairs Ministry, said
that although the president has the constitutional basis to
validate the final tally following the recommendation of Panwaslu,
he has referred it back to the KPU to declare the election
results.
</P>
<P>
But, in its plenary session here on Monday, the KPU again
failed to endorse the poll results. The meeting turned chaotic and
was adjourned following a heated debate between KPU government
representatives and party representatives over the results of
Panwaslu's investigation.
</P>
<P>
On June 7, over 110 million Indonesians cast their votes in the
country's first democratic poll since 1955. But the count has been
beset with delays.
</P>

DHAKA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh has brought 61,600
hectares of land under cotton cultivation during the season of
1999-2000, with the production target fixed at 141,850 bales, The

<HEADLINE> Top NZ Foreign Policy Adviser favors Republic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand Government's
top international policy adviser for the past eight years wants
New Zealand to become a republic and consider a common currency
with Australia.
</P>
<P>
Richard Nottage, who has just retired as secretary of Foreign
Affairs and Trade, was quoted by the New Zealand Press Association
(NZPA) Tuesday as saying that the prospect of New Zealand becoming
part of Australia does not daunt him. He also suggests a rethink
of some of New Zealand's free-market economic policies.
</P>
<P>
Nottage said the economic reforms of the past 15 years in the
country have not delivered the benefits that New Zealanders
"deserve" and he is "grieved" to see businesses shifting to
Australia and observe the drain of highly qualified New Zealanders
overseas.
</P>
<P>
"Although I would like New Zealand to have its own national
identity in some things, I myself under certain conditions would
be prepared to consider federation with Australia.
</P>
<P>
"It may be just the way the world is going, or regional blocs
are developing, that New Zealand and Australia are stuck down here
and have so much geographically in common. But first of all we'd
have to look at things like a common currency and it may be a long
way away," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I do believe New Zealand should become a republic. I've not
made any secret of that. I think the time has come," Nottage, with
a diplomatic career of 37 years, was quoted as saying.

defeated fifth-seeded Mary Pierce of France 6-3, 4-6, 6-1 in the
first round of the TIG Classic tennis tournament in Carlsbad,
California on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Sugiyama failed to get one of the four qualifying spots when
she lost to Meilen Tu, 3-6, 7-5, 6-1. However, she got a reprieve
when Magdalena Maleeva, Pierce's opponent, withdrew because of a
recurring problem with a stress fracture in her left arm.

Playing less than six hours after losing to Tu, ranked 103rd in
the world, Sugiyama was the aggressor from the beginning.

Sugiyama, on the court for three hours, 31 minutes in her two
matches, took advantage of Pierce's erratic play in the first set
to register three service breaks.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Prevalence Expected to Rise in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Prevalence of HIV infections is
expected to rise in Kenya in the coming years as there are no
signs of its decline, a report carried in the East African
Standard newspaper said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report titled "AIDS in Kenya (1999)" issued by the
country's National AIDS/ STD Control Program said there had been
no evidence of a decline in prevalence and the trend of prevalence
suggests an increase to 15 percent from 14 percent in the 15-49
age group by 2005.
</P>
<P>
According to the National AIDS/STD Control Program, there are
areas in Kenya where prevalence already stands at 20-30 percent
as opposed to a gross projection of 18 percent in 1998 in high
dominance areas.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that AIDS prevention program implemented have
had an effect in reducing the severity of the epidemic but not to
the extent of preventing new inflections.
</P>
<P>
The population of adults living with HIV is larger in rural
areas, the report said, adding there are about 430,000
HIV-infected adults in urban areas in Kenya in addition to about
1.4 million in rural areas where some 80 percent of the country's
population live.
</P>
<P>
The report also noted that if the prevalence fails to hit the
expected 15 percent by 2005, the number of the infected would run
to 2.2 million by 2000 and three million by 2005.
</P>
<P>
"The cumulative number of AIDS would increase from over 700,000
deaths today to 2.7 million by 2005," the report added.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Official Calls for Legalizing Abortion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's new chief health civil
servant has called for legalizing abortion in a bid to secure
women's lives and health.
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt the existing laws are colonial and too
strict in the modern society," said Julius Meme, the
newly-appointed permanent secretary in the ministry of health, the
Daily Nation newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said legalizing abortion would save women from shying away
from help with doctors, citing that the current laws are to blame
for the rising number of abortion-related deaths.
</P>
<P>
Women used harmful drugs and needles or turned to crooked
quacks, Meme added.
</P>
<P>
He also called for a community-level discussion on the issue
with a view to eradicating the danger.
</P>
<P>
Meme, a former director of the Kenyatta National Hospital, also
demanded the introduction of sex education, arguing that it could
curb cases of school dropouts due to unwanted pregnancies and the
spread of HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Statistics by the United Nations Population Fund show that in
Kenya at least 50 percent of youths under 15 years old have had
sex.

<HEADLINE> Officials Punished for Violating Environmental Regulations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, August 3 (Xinhua) -- A total of 22 government and
Chinese Communist Party officials in north China's Shanxi province
have been removed from their posts for breaching environmental
regulations.
</P>
<P>
The province penalized or punished the officials in accordance
with a set of newly-unveiled regulations concerning violations of
environmental regulations.
</P>
<P>
The regulations were worked out in face of increasing
violations of environmental regulations and loopholes in
penalizing the violators.
</P>
<P>
"In the past, only the units and individuals were held
responsible for violating environmental regulations, and there is
just no stipulations to restrict officials who have brought about
or harbored environment-damaging activities," said Yang Jichun,
director of the Provincial Environmental Protection Administration.
</P>
<P>
According to the regulations, government officials at all
levels will be held responsible for fulfilling environmental
protection goals, and those found of dereliction of duty,
harboring enterprises in violation of environmental regulations,
and deterring pollution reduction will receive administrative
penalties ranging from warning to removal from official posts.
</P>
<P>
The practice of penalizing responsible officials proved to be
effective in this regard and is expected to be adopted nationwide,
said an official from the State Environmental Protection
Administration.

<HEADLINE> Women Soccer Craze Unabated in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The third Chinese women soccer
superleague found itself basking in the aftereffect of the third
World Cup in the United States concluded about half a month ago as
its opening round this season was greeted by a record capacity
crowd.
</P>
<P>
The eight-team superleague, which kicked off on Sunday
afternoon when the men's league also was in action, showed little
sign that it is still struggling in the shadow of the men soccer.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the rate of admission in the four venues, Zhejiang
Sports Center, where Liberation Army team host the Sichuan squad,
ranked forefront with a record attendance of 12,000 although both
teams have few internationals to show off.
</P>
<P>
Henan Provincial Stadium in Zhengzhou also found with
surprising delight that over ten thousand fans swarmed inside, a
spectucular scene which has been a luxury to the Chinese women
soccer.
</P>
<P>
The newly-built 4,000-seat Shandong Qilu Petrochemical Stadium,
where the superleague opening ceremony was held, was filled with a
sell-out enthusiasts. Those who failed to get tickets tried to
watch from the top of the highrise buildings or climbed up tall
trees just to feast their eyes.
</P>
<P>
According to the organisers, the 4,000 tickets, valued at RMB
20 yuan (about 2.5 U.S. dollars) were all sold out three days in
advance.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Shijingshan Stadium, which is home to Beijing Chengjian
Team with six internationals, welcomed not only its first downpour
after days of scorching heat but also 9,000 fans who hung a banner
reading "we will forvere support you Beijing women soccer".
</P>
<P>
The unexpected popularity of women soccer league sent a great
encouragement to the soccer officials, who have been baffled by
the sticky issue of developing women soccer market.
</P>
<P>
"The enthusiasm in the opening round indicates that women
soccer market has a promising future." said Lang Xiaonong,
director of the competition department of the Chinese Football
Association.
</P>
<P>
"The women superleague is popular partly for the fans who are
willing to cheer the women soccer who have garnered honors on
international scences, and partly for its charm has increased."
Lang said.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts also attributed the emergence of such amazingly
big crowd to the performances of women players, in particular the
national team who won the silver medal at the third Women's World
Cup.
</P>
<P>
The coaches and players, who have for long played to entertain
themselves, also popped their eyes and felt at a loss how to
behave properly in front of such a big crowd.
</P>
<P>
Wang Haiming, the head coach of Beijing Chengjian team, which
was sponsored by Beijing City-building Group, could not but reveal
his excitement, saying his side had a feeling of being pampered by
fans.
</P>
<P>
"It is really moving, I have not expected that. We will go all
out this season to return our gratitude for their unselfish
support." said Wang.
</P>
<P>
In Zhengzhou where the Shanghai team took on the hosting Henan
outfit, Sun Wen and Fan Yunjie, the internationals from each side,
became the focus of attention as the fans stood in the way of the
possible routes to team buses to get their autographs.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the men's league fans, there was an evident
increase of female fans. Two girs who had prepared horns for the
match said: "We are very proud of the Chinese women soccer. As one
member of the women family, we of course should cheer them and
show our firm support to them."

<HEADLINE> Northeast China Combats Tree Epidemic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The deadly tree epidemic,
poplar canker, has been put under basic control which had swept
across north and northeast China since May of this year.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the State Forestry Administration said that
further infestation would be effectively prevented. Trees found
seriously attacked have been felled while chemical pesticides were
applied on those diseased trees for treatment.
</P>
<P>
The epidemic was caused by bacteria-carrying parasites in the
trees. The bacteria has destroyed approximately 30,000 trees -
causing withering and rotting of their bark - in Shenyang City,
capital of Liaoning Province, Harbin City, capital of Heilongjiang
Province and Tianjin Municipality.
</P>
<P>
The disease has been detected in Changchun, Dalian, Anshan and
Qinhuangdao in Jilin, Liaoning and Hebei provinces, statistics
from the State Forestry Administration showed.
</P>
<P>
The epidemic's outbreak was "unprecedented and unexpected," and
was a result of abnormal weather conditions since last winter,
administration officials suggested.
</P>
<P>
"Last winter's drought reduced the water in the trees, which
weakened their ability to fight bacteria," noted Wang Xiaohua,
division director of the administration's Anti-Pest and Disease
Center.
</P>
<P>
"Another reason is the spring's humidity was good for the
growth of the bacteria," Wang added.

<HEADLINE> Belgium to Investigate Stowaway Flight Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 3 (Xinhua) -- An autopsy is scheduled for
Tuesday by Belgian justice authorities to examine the cause of the
death of two African youths who were found in a compartment for
storing landing gears under the wing of a Sabena airliner.
</P>
<P>
The two African youths, judged to be in their mid teens, were
found dead inside the right under-the-wing compartment at the
airport of the Belgian national airport on Monday.
</P>
<P>
A strange odor led airport re-fueling technicians to the
discovery of the bodies from the compartment of the Airbus A330-
300.
</P>
<P>
The airport medical personnel said that the deaths could be
caused by the low temperature high up in the sky during the flight.
</P>
<P>
The Sabena airliner initiated its flight from Bamako of Mali
with a stopover at Conakry of Guinea before arriving in the
Belgian capital.
</P>
<P>
No one knows for sure where the two stowaways got into the
compartment though the compartment is supposed to be routinely
checked at each airport before taking off.
</P>
<P>
The Sabena authorities decided to take proper measures to
prevent similar events from happening again in the future. But
they have to decide what measures to take in the first place. Some
suggested tighter checks before taking off.
</P>
<P>
At the cruise height of 10,000 meters, the ambient temperature
around the airplane can be 50 degrees or 55 degrees Celsius below
zero. Though it may be a bit warmer inside the landing gear
compartment, the lack of oxygen at that altitude is another deadly
factor during flight.
</P>
<P>
The chance is rare for anyone to survive such a stowaway voyage
though a Senegalese youth managed to survive a five-hour stowaway
flight from Dakar to Lyon of France on January 26 this year.

<HEADLINE> Snow Leopard: Mascot of the 8th SAF Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The Snow Leopard wearing a
traditional Nepali Topi (Cap), is the official Mascot of the 8th
SAF Games, said a press release here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Snow Leopard, which is listed among protected animals of
the Nepali government since 1973, can be found in the high
Himalaya, west of the Qomolangma region at an altitude between
3000m to 4000m, and comes down to lower elevation (2000m) during
the winter season.
</P>
<P>
The animal, which is similar to common leopard, favours dry
Alpine Steppe habitat. Its head is squarish, with a high forehead
and vertical thin and measures from 190 to 200 centimeters in
total length.
</P>
<P>
Since the last century its population has greatly dwindled as
its beautiful and soft skin make costly dresses and luxury items.
To conserve these beautiful animals, a ban on the trade of its fur
has also been imposed by the International Fur Trade Federation.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves Release of Crucial Aid to Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) has finally approved the 193 million U.S. dollars stand-by
credit facility for Zimbabwe, ending almost two years of an
agonizing wait for its disbursement.
</P>
<P>
At its meeting in Washington Monday, the IMF board finally
approved the release of the crucial aid which will support the
country's economic reform program over the next 14 months, the
daily Herald newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Of this amount, 24 million U.S. dollars will be available
immediately while another 9.7 million U.S. dollars will be
released after August 16. Subsequent disbursements will depend on
the country's performance in meeting the agreed targets.
</P>
<P>
In coming to its decision, the IMF had noted several key areas
which it said needed to be resolved. Inflationary pressures will
have to be monitored while the Zimbabwean government will have to
restrain its expenditure.
</P>
<P>
The IMF said in a statement last night that the stabilization
of the country's economy will center on, among other things,
monetary growth control.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe would also have to implement the land reform program
in a transparent manner, with all stake-holders consulted.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's participation in the Democratic Republic of Congo
also came under the spotlight. Although not mentioned by name,
the IMF wants the Zimbabwean government to make public its
military expenditure.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Minister Blamed for Sale of Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan Finance Minister Gerald
Ssendaula has been blamed by members of parliament (MPs) for
selling the Cooperative Bank which was closed in May for
insolvency.
</P>
<P>
MPs expressed overwhelming support for a motion asking the
minister to cancel the sale of the bank until a select committee
on the financial sector crises reports to the House, the New
Vision paper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
They also called on Governor of the Bank of Uganda Charles
Kikonyogo to resign if he could not resist the political pressure
in the supervision of financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Ssendaula defended the central bank's decision to close and
sell the Cooperative Bank branches, saying the bank was insolvent
and mismanaged.
</P>
<P>
The bank, which had about 110,000 depositors, was abruptly
closed, leaving many of the its depositors crying out for their
money.
</P>
<P>
Some reports here said that the central bank sold the branches
of the closed bank subsequently while others indicated that the
bank was sold in January, four months before its closure.

<HEADLINE> Half of India's Rural Population Illiterate: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Half of the population in rural
India are illiterate with about 40 percent living below the
poverty line, according to a latest study by India's National
Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER).
</P>
<P>
Only 43 percent of rural households have access to domestic
lighting, 23 percent have access to tap water and 33 percent
utilize the public distribution system, the NCAER said in its
study.
</P>
<P>
The report, which was released on Monday, showed that on
average, 8 percent of rural income was spend on health and primary
education.
</P>
<P>
The report was based on a sample survey conducted in 1994
covering 33,000 rural households from 1,765 villages and 195
districts in 15 states and the northeast.
</P>
<P>
It has taken into account 90 indicators of human development
representing various dimensions of living standards, including
income and assets, employment and wages, consumption, literacy and
health.
</P>
<P>
The report identifies the rural people as farmers, wage
laborers, scheduled castes and scheduled tribes and those living
in less developed villages.
</P>
<P>
It also presents a number of human development parameters
according to religion and caste.
</P>
<P>
About 16 percent of the people investigated belong to the
lowest strata in India's traditional caste system and have an
income of only 3 rupees (7 U.S. cents) one person per day, and the
next 18 percent have command over only 5.50 rupees (13 U.S. cents)
per person per day, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Calls for Concerted Efforts in Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Gold-producing developing
countries should unite to fight the proposed International
Monetary Fund (IMF) gold sales and even seek the intervention of
the United Nations on the issue, a Zimbabwean minister has said.
</P>
<P>
Simon Moyo, Minister of Mines, Environment and Tourism, told
the daily Herald that the proposed gold sales posed a major threat
to gold-producing countries, particularly developing ones.
</P>
<P>
The IMF intends to sell 10 million ounces of its gold and use
the proceeds to help highly indebted developing countries reduce
their debt.
</P>
<P>
But critics say while the objective to help poor countries
offset their debts is welcome, the gold sales would plunge poor
countries into deeper economic problems since many of them
depended on gold. If approved, the IMF proposal would result in
gold prices, which are already low, tumbling further and resulting
in massive retrenchments in the gold mining sector.
</P>
<P>
In Zimbabwe, it is feared that 30,000 jobs would be lost if the
IMF off loads its gold.

<HEADLINE> SES, SIMEX Moving Toward Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Work on the merger of
Singapore's equities and futures exchanges has witnessed progress
and the search for top executives of the new integrated exchange
has been underway, according to local press reports.
</P>
<P>
The merger process of combining the Stock Exchange of Singapore
(SES) and the Singapore International Monetary Exchange (SIMEX)
has reached the stage where the new legal and organization
structure has been approved by the pro tem committee appointed by
the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).
</P>
<P>
The SES-SIMEX merger was announced by the Singapore Government
last year as part of financial reform with a view to strengthening
its financial sector.
</P>
<P>
The new exchange will be set up as a holding company with five
wholly-owned subsidiaries and will be led jointly by a chief
executive officer (CEO) and presidents in the Office of the Chief
Executive.
</P>
<P>
By the organizational echelon of the new exchange, the CEO will
oversee nine divisions, including the four business units of cash
trading, derivatives trading, cash clearing and derivatives
clearing, and five functional departments in charge of strategy,
information technology, risk management and regulatory functions.
</P>
<P>
The four business units will be kept separate to focus on their
individual profit-and-loss generation.
</P>
<P>
The reports said the new organization structure is designed to
make the exchange more commercial-minded as it will eventually be
publicly listed.
</P>
<P>
The work of looking for top executives and board members of the
new exchange is still underway but the heads of six divisions have
been appointed and the heads of the other three divisions will be
recruited from the outside.
</P>
<P>
The reports said one crucial task left is the common bond
system of SIMEX's clearing house which has to be modified or
replaced because it is incompatible with demutualization and
merger.
</P>
<P>
SES and SIMEX have recently assured their members in a letter
that "under no circumstances will the financial strength and the
integrity of the SIMEX clearing house be allowed to weaken."

<TEXT>
<P>
FRANKFURT, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The economy in the euro zone in
2000 will rise to 3 percent from this year's projected 2 percent,
Deutsche Bank AG analysts predicted here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
They said industrial exports and private consumption will be
the main pillars for the development in the euro zone.
</P>
<P>
The zone will benefit greatly from the robust world economy and
the euro slip in the past few months, they added.
</P>
<P>
The German economy in 2000 will rise to 3 percent from this
year's predicted 1.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Deutsche Bank AG, one of the world's largest, said German
exports are expected to reach 6.7 percent of the country's total
economy next year. From the latter half of this year, private
consumption, especially auto and tourism spending, will maintain
growing momentum, thus boosting the German economy.
</P>
<P>
From 2001, the growing momentum of the euro zone economy will
be better than that of the U.S. economy, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
It said by the end of 2000 the exchange rate of the euro will
rise to 1.15 to 1.20 U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Minister Calls For Punishment for Kurniawan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Minister of Sports
and Youth Affairs Agung Laksono called for harsh punishment for
the country's best striker Kurniawan Dwi Julianto, who was tested
positive for doping, The Indonesian Observer reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The harsh punishment, according to the minister, is intended to
give a warning to other athletes.
</P>
<P>
"Being eliminated from the Southeast Asian (SEA) Games
contingent is not enough. A more severe punishment should be
sought. He should be laid off for a long time if needed," Agung
said.
</P>
<P>
SEA Games training director Imron Z.S. said that Kurniawan, 23,
tested positive for amphetamines after the National Sports Council
(KONI) and the Jakarta doping laboratory conducted the tests in
June and July.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Tourist Arrivals in Indonesia Predicted to Exceed 5 Mln </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The number of foreigners visiting
Indonesia could reach between 5-5.5 million this year, exceeding
an initial forecast of 3.9-4.4 million, provided the existing
security and order is maintained, the Jakarta Post reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The first semester of 1999 showed an incredible growth of
foreign tourist arrivals, which increased by more than 10 percent
compared to the same period of 1998," Director General of Tourism
Gede Ardika was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Tourism, Arts and Culture had earlier predicted
a lower figure, based on the assumption that foreign tourists
would stay away from Indonesia because of predicted unrest and
violence in the run-up to the June general election.
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, the second half of the year would bring more
tourists to Indonesia due to the holiday season for Europeans,
North Americans and Japanese in July, August and September, Ardika
said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry's latest report on foreigners arriving through
Indonesia's 13 points of entry showed that 1.86 million foreigners
visited Indonesia in the first six months of 1999, compared with
1.69 million in the corresponding period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Bali kept its spot as Indonesia's most favored destination,
attracting 683,083 foreigners in the first half, a 32.3 percent
increase over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Jakarta saw an 18.3 percent drop in the number of foreign
visitors to 360,186 during the first six months.

<HEADLINE> 14 Kilos of Gold Seized at Sri Lanka's Airport </HEADLINE>

<P>
COLOMBO, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan Customs officers have
seized 120 gold slabs weighing 14 kilograms at the Bandaranaike
International Airport in the north suburb of Colombo, police
sources said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The gold slabs worth 7.8 million rupees (110,000 U.S. dollars)
were concealed in a special jacket worn under the shirt by an
Indian male passenger, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
The man, who was a frequent traveler to Sri Lanka, claimed to
be a transit passenger on his way to Male, the Maldives, but was
unable to produce the air ticket for the connecting flight.
</P>
<P>
The Customs officers suspect the passenger, who arrived from
Dubai on Sunday, brought the gold to smuggle it in through local
agents.
</P>
<P>
The passenger was released but the gold was detained for
further investigation by the Customs.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, one of the Indian's companions was
also nabbed with 70 gold slabs on an earlier occasion.
</P>
<P>
But the Customs released him with the gold since he produced
documents to corroborate that he was a transit passenger.

<P>
MANILA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Flash floods caused by two days of
torrential rains starting Sunday have hit Metro Manila and nearby
provinces with 19 people killed and more than 3,000 families
evacuated from their homes.
</P>
<P>
According to the National Disaster Coordination Council, seven
people from two families were killed in Antipolo when a concrete
wall of a low-cost housing project fell on their houses early
Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
Flash floods also caused landslides in the Cainta area of
Manila Sunday night, killing seven people of one family.
</P>
<P>
In Metro Manila, the top disaster area in the nation, 178
villages have been submerged, forcing the evacuation of residents
in low-lying areas, Metropolitan Manila Development Authority
said.
</P>
<P>
Due to the widespread flooding and hard weather in Metro
Manila, the Philippine government has suspended work in all
government offices effective 3:00 p.m. Monday.
</P>
<P>
In the nearby Pampanga province, continuous rains destroyed a
40-meter dike of the Pampanga river and inundated 11 towns as of
Monday noon.
</P>
<P>
Floods and erosion in the province rendered some portions of
national and provincial roads impassable to all types of vehicles
and forced at least 100 people to evacuate to safer places.
</P>
<P>
In Manila and Rizal, classes were suspended in all public and
private schools due to flash floods spawned by two days of
torrential rains.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada said Monday that he had
instructed the armed forces and police to be on red alert to
enable them to undertake round-the-clock rescue and relief
operations in disaster areas.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado said mayors and governors of
affected communities can, on their own, declare a state of
calamity in a bid to authorize the release of disaster-relief
funds.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Mercado said the military has sent out trucks and
rubber boats to assist families affected by the floods.
</P>
<P>
Torrential rains, reportedly induced by the much-feared La Nina
phenomenon, would continue to pelt Manila and nearby provinces
Tuesday, weather reports said.

COLOMBO, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan police investigating
the assassination of parliamentarian Neelan Thiruchelvam have
found a photograph of the Tamil rebel suicide bomber at a Colombo
lodge where he had been hiding, police said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Thiruchelvam, a Tamil parliamentarian and vice-president of the
Tamil United Liberation Front, was killed in a suicide bombing
attack by the rebel at a stone's throw from his home in Colombo.
</P>
<P>
The bomber jumped off the back of a motor cyclist and onto
Thiruchelvam's car as it approached a busy intersection.
</P>
<P>
Police sources said a special police team has also found
several travel documents including the suicide bomber's passport.
</P>
<P>
They said police had obtained several vital leads after
questioning people who were alleged to have associated with the
suicide bomber.
</P>
<P>
The suicide bomber had come to the city early last year on the
pretext of seeking employment abroad, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The suicide bomber had not given his correct name and address
to the lodge's owner, the sources said, adding that police are
awaiting a comprehensive report of the government analyst in
connection with the killing.
</P>
<P>
The suicide bomber was sent by rebels of the Liberation Tigers
of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) who have been fighting for a separate Tamil
state in the north and east of the country since 1983.

VIENNA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The average crude oil price

The price has been increasing since June, when it was 15.61

Higher international demand and lower consumer storage are also

CAIRO, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The board of directors of the
Egyptian Football Federation (EFF) and the team's coach became the
victims of Egypt's 5-1 humiliation by Saudi Arabia in the
Confederation Cup last week as they handed in the resignation
Monday amid widespread shock and blistering criticism at home.
</P>
<P>
Following a meeting of EFF's board of directors, its president,
Samir Zaher, headed to Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzoury's office
to submit the resignation of the nine-member body. The team's
coach, Mahmoud el-Gohary, also resigned.
</P>
<P>
President Hosni Mubarak demanded Sunday an urgent report from
el-Ganzoury detailing why the team, which returned in triumph in
February 1998 after winning the African Cup soccer tournament,
suffered such a humiliating loss.
</P>
<P>
The players had complained that the criticism was too hard on
them, saying that Paraguayan referee Ubaldo Aquino expelled three
Egyptian players during the game, leaving only eight to compete
against Saudi Arabia's 11 players.

Egypt did not qualify for the second round of the tournament

<HEADLINE> Argentine Industrialists Call for Economic Coordination with Mercosur </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, August 2 (Xinhua)-- Argentine industrialists
Monday called for the negotiation of a mechanism to coordinate the
macro-economic behavior of the Southern Common Market (Mercosur).
</P>
<P>
During a lunch attended by the country's main entrepreneurs and
Minister of Economy Roque Fernandez, the head of Argentina's
Industrial Union Osvaldo Rial said coordinating macroeconomics
among the four countries was a matter of extreme urgency, a matter
of such high priority that Mercosur should devote full attention
to its accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
He said a mechanism is needed so that when a macro-economic
variation occurs in any one of the countries, such as in the case
of Brazil's devaluation of its currency, the others can take
transitory compensating measures until the situation is re-
established.
</P>
<P>
He said the industrialists would meet Tuesday with officials
from the Ministry of Economy and Foreign Affairs in order to
coordinate the position before Mercosur's next meeting in
Montevideo.
</P>
<P>
He denounced the devaluation of Brazil's currency, the real,
which caused considerable losses to Argentina's industrial sector.
He added that a means of finding compensation must be found.
</P>
<P>
Argentine President Carlos Menem promised his Brazilian
counterpart Enrique Cardoso that Argentina won't take
protectionist measures against Brazil's exports in the areas of
textiles, shoes, electronic products, and other areas in order to
preserve Mercosur's integration.
</P>
<P>
Local industrialists however protested against the government's
position, accusing it of not protecting national industries.
</P>
<P>
The largest regional group in South America, Mercosur, which
includes Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay, is facing its
worst crisis since it went into effect in 1995. Bolivia and Chile
are associate members.

<HEADLINE> Argentina to Pay More Interest on Public Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, August 2 (Xinhua)-- Argentina will have to set
aside 1.5 billion U.S. dollars more than anticipated to pay the
interest on its public debt.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by the Capital Foundation, Argentina must
pay 8.9 billion dollars of interest on its total public debt,
which is about 115 billion dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
The report says the increase in the payment of interest on the
public debt is due primarily to the financial risks the country
must make, and financing new debt often requires higher interest
rates.

<HEADLINE> China Remains Polio-free </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Health intends to
carry out a supplementary vaccination campaign later this year to
ensure the country remains polio-free, today's "China Daily"
reported.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-based English newspaper quoted Zhou Jun, an
official from the ministry as saying that the vaccination campaign
will target some 30 million children under fours of age of
transient workers and in border and flood-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
China's action is part of a global campaign to eradicate polio
by next year. Several United Nations agencies, the Japanese
International Co-operation Agency and the U.S. Center for Disease
Control and Prevention will provide funding.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization (WHO) vowed to wipe out vaccine-
preventable polio in all countries by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The ministry started a national program for polio eradication
in 1988 and achieved an immunization rate of 85 percent at
provincial level the same year.
</P>
<P>
The last native "wild" polio case was reported in September
1994. Since then, only four imported cases have been reported in
1995-96 in Yunnan Province, affecting people returning from
Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
China still faces a polio threat from neighboring areas and it
is difficult to have all children with transient families
vaccinated.
</P>
<P>
China, like other countries in the WHO Western Pacific Region,
will report on the development of its polio eradication action to
the WHO regional office this week. A final report will be
submitted to WHO for certification next year, according to the
paper.

<HEADLINE> Lower Inflation Predicted for 1999 in Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, August 2 (Xinhua)-- Mexican Finance Secretary Jose
Angel Gurria said Monday that inflation will reach 13 percent in
1999, a lower figure than in 1998, due to an improvement in the
economy.
</P>
<P>
Inflation is maintaining a downward trend as is unemployment in
Mexico, Gurria said during the 17th meeting of the Latin American
Econometric Society in Cancun, east of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Mexico registered an inflation rate of 18.6 percent last year,
above the 15.7 percent rate of 1997, as a result of the financial
crisis and the fall of oil prices on the world market.
</P>
<P>
The Mexican government launched financial reforms to increase
tax revenues, reduce dependency on petroleum income, and support
the productive sectors.
</P>
<P>
Without providing figures, Gurria said that unemployment stayed
in the first quarter of this year at its lowest level since 1991.

JAKARTA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia ran a trade surplus of
10.12 billion U.S. dollars in the first half of 1999, Antara News
Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's exports in January-June were valued at 21.67

the Central Bureau of Statistics was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
But the exports dropped by 11.81 percent from the same period

billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, crude oil exports increased from 1.70
billion dollars to 1.84 billion dollars as a result of the oil
price hike on the world market from 15.94 dollars per barrel in
May 1999 to 15.95 dollars per barrel in June 1999.
</P>
<P>
Oil/gas imports dropped by 7.80 percent from 1.45 billion

<HEADLINE> FA Probe Ferguson 'Bung' Revelation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The Football Association of
England are to contact Manchester United football club manager Sir
Alex Ferguson over his revelations that he was offered a 40,000
pounds bung.
</P>
<P>
The FA are not questioning the Manchester United manager's
conduct in the affair and they believe he did everything above
board. They want to know the full facts before they pass on their
report to FIFA and the FA's compliance officer, Graham Bean, will
be contacting Sir Alex.
</P>
<P>
Sir Alex reveals in his autobiography, Managing My Life, that
he was handed the money in a parcel by Grigory Essaoulenko, the
Russian agent who attempted to force through the transfer of
Russian forward Andrei Kanchelskis from United to Everton, in 1994.
He notified United straight away and the money lay in the club
safe for nearly a year before he handed it back to Essaoulenko.
</P>
<P>
FA spokesman Adrian Bevington said: "This is a matter for FIFA.
However, our compliance officer, Graham Bean, will be contacting
Sir Alex Ferguson to request the full facts surrounding this issue.
</P>
<P>
"Once the facts have been established, we will pass on all the
information to FIFA. They will probably wish to carry out an
investigation into this agent."
</P>
<P>
FIFA are waiting for the FA's report before making any official
comment.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman said: "At the moment everything is happening in the
media and we do not wish to make any official statement until we
receive further information from the FA."
</P>
<P>
The matter is complicated by the fact that FIFA only began to
license agents a year after Essaoulenko offered the money to Sir
Alex. The FIFA spokesman also confirmed that Essaoulenko is not on
their list of licensed agents.
</P>
<P>
The Premier League bungs inquiry investigated the transfer of
Kanchelskis, who later moved to Everton on five million pounds,
and spokesman Mike Lee claims there is no need for them to re-open
their inquiries.
</P>
<P>
"The Kanchelskis transfer was looked into and there's
absolutely no question of any wrong-doing by anyone involved at
Manchester United or English football," he said. "There is nothing
further to investigate."

<HEADLINE> Croatian Suker Joins Arsenal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Croatian football star Davor Suker
admitted Monday he has taken a massive pay cut to join Arsenal as
the 3.5 million pounds replacement for money-mad Nicolas Anelka as
Highbury's top Gunner.
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old player was on the equivalent of 40,000 pounds a
week with Real Madrid where walk-out rebel Anelka, 20, is due to
pitch up this week on even higher wages - and with a mouth-
watering seven-year contract.
</P>
<P>
But both Arsenal, who will receive close to 24 million pounds
in five instalments from Real for the moody French international,
and Suker are convinced they have the best of the deal.
</P>
<P>
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has labelled him a goalscorer in
the Ian Wright mould to supplement the power and artistry of
Dennis Bergkamp and Nwankwo Kanu in the twin-quest to wrest
Premiership -and European - supremacy from Manchester United.
</P>
<P>
"It would not be right for me to give you the figures," said
Wenger, "but I can tell you Suker has taken a substantial cut in
wages.
</P>
<P>
"This is very unusual. He can, of course, improve what he earns
under our bonus scheme by helping us to win trophies - just as the
rest of the squad can - but every new signing is a gamble and I
admire him for the one he is taking by coming here.
</P>
<P>
"He had other opportunities in Greece and Turkey as well as in
Spain which were very financially attractive but he has chosen to
come to Arsenal and he's happy to fit into the wages structure
here.
</P>
<P>
"I have always been determined not to harm that pay policy but
I needed an experienced striker and now I have one at the right
price who also has great ability, spirit and desire. He has the
talent to be a great success here and he has the right spirit for
us."

WINNIPEG, Canada, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The United States under-
18 women's side scored a comfortable 2-0 win over Costa Rica to
advance into the Pan Am Games final here today.
</P>
<P>
The Americans will take on Mexico, who beat the hosts Canada on
5-3 penalty kicks, for the gold medal on Thursday at the Winnipeg
Soccer Complex.
</P>
<P>
"We had to win this one to get to the gold medal game," said
Marica Wallis, who in the fifth minute opened the scoring for the
United States for her seventh goal of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
"I think we played pretty well. We had a couple of bad breaks
with balls bouncing off the crossbar. But we have to be happy with
this win and look to the next game because that is why we're here.
"
</P>
<P>
At no time in the game did Costa Rica control the ball in the
US penalty area.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time women's soccer were contested in the Pan
Am Games history.

TIRANA -- The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) will
send new troops by September to replace its forces currently
stationed in Albania called the AFOR, or the majority of them, an
AFOR press officer here said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Most of the AFOR are expected to leave Albania on September 1
as their "humanitarian mission" is closing, said Lt. Col. Helge
Eriksen. The details of the mission of new NATO forces and its
commander have not been clearly decided by the North Atlantic
Council so far, but the council has decided that NATO will remain
in Albania, he said. (Albania-NATO-Forces)

WASHINGTON -- The United States would continue its agreement
with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) on building
a 5 billion U.S. dollars nuclear power even if Pyongyang conducts
a long-range missile test, the State Department said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We think that regardless of what serious consequences there
might be for the potential for the U.S.- North Korean development,
if the North Koreans test, we shouldn't cut off our nose to spite
our face," State Department spokesman James Rubin told reporters.
"The agreed framework is a very important instrument that benefits
the security of the United States and the countries in the region,
" he added.(US-DPRK-Framework)

<HEADLINE> Disgraced Canadian Goalie Appologizes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WINNIPEG, Canada, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Steve Vezina, whose
steroid-laced urine cost the Canadian roller-hockey team gold at
the Pan American Games, appologized to the whole country at a news
conference on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The whole thing affected me very much. I am regretful about it,
" Vezina said.
</P>
<P>
He went on to appologize to the entire country of Canada, his
teammates and everyone associated with the 13th Pan Am Games.
</P>
<P>
"But I don't think I'm a bad athlete, or a bad goalie. I'm not
the only one who takes these things.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't commit any crime. It's a misunderstanding. I've taken
something I shouldn't have taken."
</P>
<P>
Canada was stripped of its roller hockey gold medal yesterday
after Vezina tested positive for two stimulants and an anabolic
steroid.
</P>
<P>
Vezina was the lone Canadian roller hockey player tested
positive. Eduardo de Rose, the chief of the Games Medical
Commission, said Vezina's sample showed an excessively high level
of the steroid Nandrolone--16,000 parts per million compared to
the acceptable level of two parts per million.
</P>
<P>
Vezina, 24, plays a professional roller hockey for the Buffalo
Wings.
</P>
<P>
He said his professional schedule is very demanding and the
drug "helps me a lot"."It helps me to be physically strong and
recover fast."
</P>
<P>
The drug test showed three banned substances--ephedrine, pseudo-
ephedrine and Nandrolone. The former two are stimulants used to
avoid fatigue and Nandrolone is an anabolic steroid that increases
muscle mass.
</P>
<P>
Ephedrine and Nandrolone are not taken for the Pan Am Games,
Vezina said, They're taken as soon as in June for his professional
training.
</P>
<P>
But he said the incident is not going to change his attitude.
</P>
<P>
"I'll be careful. I've learned a lesson." he said.

<P>
WINNIPEG, Canada, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The United States made
it a sweeping victory in the Pan Am mountain bike competitions as
both men's and women's golds fell to their hands here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Alison Dunlap, ranked third in the world going into the Pan Am
Games, clocked two hours nine minutes and 44.68 seconds to triumph
in the women's event.
</P>
<P>
Her male teammate Edward Larsen, the only US cyclist to ever

men's gold.
</P>
<P>
Both of them will compete in the Pan Am Games road race on
August 4.
</P>
<P>
The mountain bike event is a mass start competition that is
held on a circuit course comprised of forest roads, off-road
trails and unpaved dirt or gravel roads. The number of laps
defends on the level of competitors and the length of the course.
</P>
<P>
The mountain bike made its Olympics debut in 1996 in Atlanta
and was first contested at the Pan Am Games in 1995.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says to Continue Framework Agreement with DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The United States would
continue its agreement with the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea (DPRK) on building a 5 billion U.S. dollars nuclear power
even if Pyongyang conducts a long-range missile test, the State
Department said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We think that regardless of what serious consequences there
might be for the potential for the U.S.- North Korean
development, if the North Koreans test, we shouldn't cut off our
nose to spite our face," State Department spokesman James Rubin
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"The agreed framework is a very important instrument that
benefits the security of the United States and the countries in
the region," he said
</P>
<P>
"And we would intend and want to see that program and
agreement continued, even if we have problems and serious
concerns about the missiles," he added.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1994 agreed framework, the United States committed
to providing two light-water nuclear power reactors and
alternative energy supplies in exchange for DPRK's stopping
using of the graphite reactors.
</P>
<P>
As a part of the project, the United States has promised to pay
20 million dollars to 30 dolalrs million annually for oil
shipments to the DPRK.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves 193 Million Dollars in Credit for Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) on Monday approved a stand-by credit of 193 million
U.S. dollars for Zimbabwe, which is designed to support the
nation's economic program over the next 14 months.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, 24 million dollars is available for Zimbabwe
immediately.
</P>
<P>
"Directors...underscored that the immediate challenge is to
stabilize the exchange rate and bring inflation under control
through a further tightening of financial policies," IMF Deputy
Managing Director Shigemitsu Sugisaki said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The government's economic program for 1999 seeks to dampen
inflationary pressures, restore a visible external position and
provide a springboard for economic growth," the IMF said.
</P>
<P>
"The stabilization effort centers on continued financial
restraint, including recent steps to bring monetary growth under
control," it added.
</P>
<P>
Projected growth in real gross domestic product is 1.2 percent
in 1999, which reflects a significant downward revision from
previous expectations because of lower output in the mining and
manufacturing sectors, the IMF said.
</P>
<P>
The government's inflation target for end-1999 is 30 percent,
which is to be achieved by containing money supply growth. The
inflation rate was 46.6 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The IMF said Zimbabwe would receive an additional 9.7 million
dollars on August 16. Further payments would be made available
quarterly if Zimbabwe met its promises on economic reform.
</P>
<P>
The IMF withheld payments from previous credits to Zimbabwe
because of concern about prices, land reforms and the budget.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Finish Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NEW YORK, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks finished
lower Monday in a mixed bag of economic signals.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 9.19 at
10,645.96. The Blue chip index fell 255.81 points or 2.31
percent last week.
</P>
<P>
The market rallied as investors eased fears about higher
interests after the National Association of Purchasing Management
reported that the U.S. manufacturing sector grew in July for the
sixth consecutive month, but not as strongly as most analysts
expected. The Dow rose as much as 136 points earlier in the
session.
</P>
<P>
But a separate report by the Commerce Department said
construction spending rose 0.5 percent in June after fallings
in two straight months. The report reminded investors of
possibility of higher interest rates and the market retreated
from the early gains, moving into negative territory.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index fell 0.67 to 1,328.05 and the technology heavy
Nasdaq composite index fell 14.86 at 2,623.63.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE composite index fell 0.73 at 625.34 and the
American Stock Exchange index fell 4.59 at 783.64. The Russell
2000 index of smaller companies fell 2.14 at 442.63.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-5 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,762 down, 1,225 up and 541
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume declined to 721.29 million shares from 761.98
million in the previous session.
