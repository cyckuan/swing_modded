<P>
PARIS, August 18 (Xinhua) -- French Cooperation Minister
Charles Josselin will discuss with the leaders of Senegal and
Guinea-Conakry the situation in Guinea-Bissau during his visit to
the two countries next weekend.
</P>
<P>
Josselin will be received by Guinean President Lausana Conte
during his first visit to the western African country on August
21-22, said the French Foreign Ministry on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"This visit will allow contact on the regional situation, at

peace in Guinea-Bissau is the objective of the international
community, particularly its African neighbors," said the Foreign
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
On his way home, Josselin will make a stop in Dakar, Senegal,

<HEADLINE> Indian Rupee Slumps to Record Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The Indian rupee slumped to a
record low of 43.33/36 to the U.S. dollar Tuesday at the close of
Interbank Foreign Exchange (FOREX) market in Mumbai following
heavy all-round demand for dollars.
</P>
<P>
The demand for dollars was fuelled by political uncertainties
in the country and persistent weakness of the Japanese yen and
other Asian currencies.
</P>
<P>
Opening lower at 43.19/22 for one dollar from the overnight
finish of 43.17/19, the rupee gradually declined to 43.26/28 to a
dollar around noon and traded near its record lows throughout
afternoon business on steady demand for dollars from corporates
and importers, the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported from
Mumbai.
</P>
<P>
The State Bank of India (SBI) then sold spot-dollars and
induced other banks and corporates to unwind dollar positions.
</P>
<P>
But short-covering of dollars by corporates and renewed buying
by the SBI at the fag end of trade put renewed pressure on the
rupee and the market closed at 43.33/36 for one dollar, setting a
historic low record.

BEIJING, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese People's Liberation
Army (PLA) has sent more officers and soldiers to join the
rush-repair of embankments on the major rivers in China.
</P>
<P>
Sixteen medical teams of the PLA and armed police left for
Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi and Anhui provinces in the Yantze River
Valleys today to treat illness of local people and prevent
epidemic diseases in flooded areas.
</P>
<P>
So far, 80,000 men from the PLA and the Armed Police Force are
working on the dikes of the Nenjiang River in northeast China. The
figure surpassed that combating forest fire at Dahinggan Mountains
and that fighting floods in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Military Area Command has dispatched 1,545 officers
and soliders, 99 motor vehicles and four helicopters to north
China's Inner Mongolia to help deal with river breaches and mud
flows.
</P>
<P>
At present, 5,100 PLA men and 2,740 militiamen are fighting
floods in the eastern part of Inner Mongolia.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The second phase of the 1998
anti-mosquito Campaign was launched Tuesday in Hong Kong in which
special attention will be focused on the elimination of dengue
vector.
</P>
<P>
During the three-month operation ending in mid-November, the
Urban Services Department (USD)'s pest control staff will conduct
extensive survey for the breeding and potential breeding places
for mosquitoes in the urban areas.
</P>
<P>
"Our staff will carry out adult vector control by fogging with
knock-down insecticide in the peripheral area within 100 meters of
all cemeteries and other problematic areas," a USD spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
On the educational front, leaflets on the possible diseases
transmitted by mosquitoes and preventive measures against mosquito
nuisances will be handled out while posters will be displayed at
prominent places.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman appealed to the public to keep a clean living
environment, checking canopies, removing stagnant water and
clearing choked drains.
</P>
<P>
Those who allow mosquitoes to breed on their premises are
liable to a maximum fine of 25,000 HK dollars (3,200 U.S.
dollars), the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
During the first phase of the campaign, ranging from February
to May, a total of 664 mosquito breeding places were eliminated
and 70 prosecutions were taken.

<HEADLINE> Hoddle Shrugs off Cup Book Furore (Reopen) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Glenn Hoddle has rejected
criticism over his book on the World Cup, saying he wants to lead
England into the next one on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that Hoddle made his opinion public
since the recent furore over his controversial 1998 World Cup
Diary.
</P>
<P>
His current contract expires after Euro 2000 and discussions
have already begun with FA bosses as to whether or not he will
remain in the job to lead England into the next World Cup.
</P>
<P>
But the England coach said: "None of this controversy will
affect my decision as to whether or not I sign a new contract.
</P>
<P>
"I have two years of my current contract still remaining and
that is how things stand at this moment in time."
</P>
<P>
Hoddle has come under fire from his predecessors, former
internationals and the players' union for deciding to publish the
details of the talk with Gascoigne during which the midfielder
smashed a bedside lamp and "went beserk".
</P>
<P>
But Hoddle, speaking at Bisham Abbey where England are
training, said it had not affected the team.
</P>
<P>
He said: "I am very surprised by all the fuss and when people
read the book they will be able to make their own decisions.
</P>
<P>
"There has been no adverse feelings among the players, they
have been very positive and there have been no problems.
</P>
<P>
"I asked any players to come and see me if they had a problem
(with the book) and not one came forward."
</P>
<P>
Hoddle has been working with a squad of players since Sunday
evening in preparation for England's first Euro 2000 qualifying m
atch against Sweden early next month.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Plans to Remove Fishery Export Subsidies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
advocating the removal of export subsidies and a substantial
reduction of domestic support on the fishery sector to avoid an
overuse of the resources, the Philippine News Agency reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Secretary William Dar was quoted as saying the
Philippines has recognized that subsidies and other government
programs providing direct or indirect economic benefits to
fisheries would result in the overuse of the resources.
</P>
<P>
Dar said various development programs should instead be devised
in order to increase production and resource productivity of the
fishery sector.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Undersecretary Cesar Drilon said safety nets have
been designed to help the local fisher folks improve their output.
</P>
<P>
Drilon said priority will be given to the provision of training
and livelihood to fishermen, and to programs that are in line with
the Philippine Agriculture and Fisheries Modernization Act (AFMA)
and Fisheries Code.
</P>
<P>
Drilon said donor countries and institutions have been also
tapped to help finance fishing infrastructure, including the Asian
Development Bank which committed 9 million U.S. dollars to the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the long-term sustainability of fisheries resources,
the government also intends to implement various resource
management techniques, particularly property rights among fishers
and community- based coastal resource management programs.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Warns U.S. of WTO Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Trade and Industry
Minister Alec Erwin has said that Pretoria would challenge the
United States at the World Trade Organization (WTO) if Washington
did not change its Special 301 watch list system.
</P>
<P>
The Special 301 system places countries deemed by the U.S. to
be granting insufficient protection to U.S. intellectual property
on a watch list.
</P>
<P>
South Africa went on the offensive Monday in a bid to settle
trade disputes with the United States, Business Day paper
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a briefing of the ruling African National Congress
(ANC), the South African trade and industry minister said that
this policy instrument was "unilateral" and "unwarranted".
</P>
<P>
"We are not prepared to negotiate on this," Erwin said. "We
are just telling you (the United States) that what you have done
is wrong. If you do not begin to change it, we will challenge
you... we will do what other countries have done by challenging
you at the WTO."
</P>
<P>
His remarks followed a U.S. bid to link South Africa's access
to certain trade benefits, available under the general system of
preferences, to Pretoria's reform of its pharmaceutical law which
has sparked criticism in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Erwin said the watch list system was "WTO-incompatible" and
that South Africa is in principle opposed to it.
</P>
<P>
However, the South African minister expressed the hope that
agreement would be reached with the U.S. administration on areas
where the Clinton administration had discretion, such as on this
issue. Teams under the U.S.-South African Binational Commission
were addressing the matter.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Electoral Code to Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's forthcoming local
government polls will be held under new election rules as the
country's current electoral code of conduct is likely to be
changed.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the Electoral Commission has demarcated
wards in the newly-created 17 districts to enable people to vote
from polling stations near their homes, state-owned Zambia Daily
Mail newspaper said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Electoral Commission Chairman Bobby Bwalya was quoted as
saying in Lusaka Monday that an all stake-holders' meeting is to
be held soon and that this forum is expected to come out with a
revised code of conduct.
</P>
<P>
Bwalya said that his commission is currently holding
consultative meetings with stake-holders such as political
parties, non-governmental organizations and churches to brief
them on preparations for the polls to be held later this year.
</P>
<P>
There will be a wrap-up meeting with all the stake-holders who
are expected to come up with suggestions for new election rules
to be incorporated into a revised code of conduct, according to
the electoral commission chairman.
</P>
<P>
Some of the contentious issues in Zambia's current code of
conduct include the composition of the electoral commission which
some opposition parties feel is not broad-based, and the use of
government resources during campaigns by the ruling Movement for
Multi-party Democracy.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the 17 newly-created districts, Bwalya said this
will bring the total to 72 throughout the country while the
polling districts will come to 4,610.
</P>
<P>
With the new districts and creation of more wards, people will
now be able to vote from polling stations near their homes.
</P>
<P>
Zambia's local government elections, which were supposed to
take place in 1995 as the second one since 1992, have been
delayed for a period of three years.
</P>
<P>
The date for the elections will be designated by President
Frederick Chiluba and held before the beginning of the rainy
season in the next three months.
</P>
<P>
The election commission announced last week that registration
of voters for the forthcoming elections starts on August 24 and
runs up to September 13.
</P>
<P>
The commission hopes to capture this year 3.7 million voters
out of a total of 4.3 million eligible voters, which increase by
nearly 80 percent over the number in the years of 1995 and 1996
for the country's general elections.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Blames Turkey for Island's Rising Tension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government on Tuesday
held Turkey responsible for the rising tension in this eastern
Mediterranean island.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Christos Stylianides was commenting on the
statements made by Turkey's Minister of State for Cyprus, Sukru
Sina Gurel, who rejected the U.S. call for a ban on Greek and
Turkish military flights over Cyprus in return for a halt by the
Cyprus government to deploy Russian missiles later this year.
</P>
<P>
"This is a statement which the international community should
take into serious consideration in order to understand exactly
who is responsible for the tension in the Eastern Mediterranean
and who opposes peace," Stylianides told reporters at his daily
press briefing.
</P>
<P>
He added, however, that "we should wait until U.S. State
Department Coordinator, Thomas Miller, concludes his efforts in
Ankara and reaches his own conclusions with regard to those
responsible for the situation in the eastern Mediterranean."
</P>
<P>
Miller is now in Ankara to hold consultations with Turkish
officials on reducing tension in Cyprus. He is expected to come to
Cyprus after his Turkish trip to brief the Cypriot government on
the outcome of his talks there.
</P>
<P>
Stylianides said the Cypriot government is willing to discuss
"postponing or even cancelling the deployment of the missiles
if important steps are made toward the demilitarization of
Cyprus or if intercommunal talks resume with prospects for
progress".
</P>
<P>
Cyprus clinched a deal with Russia early last year to buy
the anti-aircraft S-300 missile system, which is due to be
delivered and deployed later this year.
</P>
<P>
This is seen as a threat by Turkish Cypriots in northern
Cyprus and Turkey, which has threatened to launch a preemptive
strike if the missiles are deployed.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been split into the Turkish Cypriot-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriot-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops took over the northern third of the island in the
wake of a failed pro-Athens coup by Greek Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
In 1983, the Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared a
breakaway state in northern part of the island, which is
recognized only by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-sponsored peace talks toward a solution to the
protracted Cyprus problem hit a snag last August after Turkish
Cypriots quited the talks to protest against a European Union
decision to start membership talks with Cyprus instead of their
supporter Turkey.

HARARE, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Defense ministers of the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) Tuesday afternoon
continued with their meeting aimed at finding a solution to the
escalating conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
They are awaiting a report from a fact-finding mission headed
by Zimbabwe's Foreign Affairs Minister Stan Mudenge.
</P>
<P>
The verification Committee of foreign ministers of Zambia,
Angola, Tanzania and Zimbabwe will return from central Africa to
attend the meeting that started Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
The discussion at the ministers' meeting was supposed to be
based on the findings of the foreign ministers who have been
studying the situation in central Africa in a bid to substantiate
DRC President Laurent Kabila's allegations that the rebellion was
in fact a Rwandan invasion.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, being held at the Zimbabwe National Army (ANA)
headquarters, follows consultations by defense ministers of
Zambia, Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe in Harare on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The mission was expected to "jet in any time today" from their
mission in Rwanda and Uganda which had been accused by Kabila of
supporting the revolt against him by the minority Tutsis.
</P>
<P>
"Mudenge's team still hasn't arrived and it means the
ministers meeting is most likely not going to come up with
anything," a source close to the highly-guarded talks told the
Zimbabwe News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The venue of the meeting remained tightly-guarded by ANA
officers.
</P>
<P>
The ministers were expected to come up with recommendations on
how to deal with the crisis for consideration by heads of state
in the region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation reported that
Kabila's 27-year-old son who is also the second-in-command of the
armed forces was in Zimbabwe for the talks.

LAGOS, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The Federal Government of Nigeria
has introduced a newly-designed Machine Readable Passport with
the old ones scheduled to be phased out in two years, according
to a senior internal ministry official.
</P>
<P>
Both kinds of passport would be valid until the old one was
phased out, the Daily Times newspaper Tuesday quoted Permanent
Secretary in the Ministry of Internal Affairs Alhaji Huhammed
Jega as saying.
</P>
<P>
Jega said Monday in capital Abuja that the passport offices in
36 states and Abuja would serve as application processing centers
in the west African country and six centers had already been
equipped to begin issuance of the document to applicants.
</P>
<P>
The permanent secretary pointed out that the new passport
sought to address problems of forgeries as there were 13 security
features in the new one which makes forgery difficult.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian travelers holding the new passports will benefit the
quick clearance at ports of entry and exit of every country in
the world due to its machine readability, he added.
</P>
<P>
The new passport has been endorsed by the International Civil
Aviation Organization as conforming with the organization's
standards which all member countries are required to meet.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Voices Frustration Over U.S. Inaction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
on Tuesday voiced his frustration over the U.S. for its failure to
push Israel to accept its peace proposal on advancing the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a two-hour meeting with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak in the northwestern Mediterranean resort
of Mersa Matrouh, Arafat blamed the continued stalemate in peace
talks on Israel's intransigence and rejection of the American
initiative on Israeli troop pullback in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
"The American side has not to date gone public with its
initiative, on a further Israeli withdrawal from 13 percent of
the West Bank, in spite of the lapse of a long time since the
initiative was made," Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have accepted the American idea, which was
introduced in January but has yet been unveiled, despite that it
fell short of their expectation, Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. initiative called for a further 13.1 percent Israeli
withdrawal from the West Bank in exchange for for further
Palestinian security guarantees.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said he listened to Mubarak's "valuable" opinions on a
variety of issues raised during their meeting and voiced
appreciation of Mubarak's unflagging interest in all developments
on the Palestinian arena.
</P>
<P>
Besides the U.S. plan, Mubarak and Arafat also discussed the
Egyptian-French initiative on holding an international conference
to save the Mideast peace process in case the U.S. initiative
fails.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Minister of Planning and International Cooperation
Nabil Shaath, who accompanied Arafat on the visit, warned that
"Palestinian patience was running out" and an explosive reaction
to the Israeli recalcitrance was possible if no progress was made
in peace talks.
</P>
<P>
He voiced disappointment with the U.S. inaction in pressing
Israel to accept its peace plan.

<P>
"Had the American stance been more positive, (Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu would not have been able to persist
in his intransigence," Shaath said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks have been stalled since
early 1997 when Israel broke ground for a new settlement in Arab
East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The direct contacts that were resumed last month between the
two sides failed to make a breakthrough on the long overdue
Israeli troop withdrawal.

<HEADLINE> India Officials Differ on Impact of Rouble Devaluation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Indian government officials
said Tuesday that the devaluation of the Russian rouble was
unlikely to hit Indian exports as New Delhi's trade receivables
were adjusted against the massive debt of 300 billion rupees from
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
"Indian exports will not be affected by the depreciation of the
Russian currency," said the Indian Ministry of Commerce, adding:
"Rather, our country may have an edge over other countries."
</P>
<P>
However, Indian Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha said on Monday
that the devaluation of the Russian rouble was bound to have an
impact on India's trade and economy.
</P>
<P>
"Russia is an important trading partner and any devaluation of
their currency is bound to have an impact," Sinha said at a
meeting with businessmen in Bangalore.
</P>
<P>
India entered into an agreement with Russia to settle the huge
debt accumulated over the years on imports, mainly weapons and
defense equipment, from the former Soviet Union through rupee
denominated exports in installments, while Indian exporters are
paid in rupees by the Reserve Bank of India.
</P>
<P>
Out of 33 billion rupees of Indian exports to Russia in
1997-98, over 90 percent was through the rupee debt repayment
route and the rest in the dollar denominated route, officials from
the Commerce Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Rouble has depreciated significantly only against the U.S.
dollar, according to the officials.

<HEADLINE> UK's Inflation Falls to Ease Pressure on Interests Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- A disappointing summer for
retailers, who had to offer protracted huge sales and bargains
galore for shoppers, are considered to have led to a sharp fall in
Britain's inflation.
</P>
<P>
The headline rate of inflation fell to 3.5 percent in July from
3.7 percent in June, while the underlying rate, excluding mortgage
payments, fell to 2.6 percent from 2.8 percent a month ago, thus
easing pressure on the need to raise interest rates, according to
official figures published today.
</P>
<P>
British Treasury Chief Secretary Stephen Byers said the figures
showed the economy was on course to hit the government's inflation
target of 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
They showed the economy was "on track for economic stability
which will see inflation at its target level and sustainable
growth," he was quoted by a BBC report as saying.
</P>
<P>
"This is in stark contrast to the cycle of boom and bust which
has plagued our economy in the past," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, Conservative deputy leader Peter Lilley attacked the
government for still not having brought inflation under control
and and having to maintain high interest rates.
</P>
<P>
"It is the government's fault that interest rates, and
therefore the exchange rate, will now stay higher than they need
have done," he said.
</P>
<P>
If inflation had been much stronger than expected, it would
have put the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC)
under more pressure to hold or even raise interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The MPC is charged with keeping inflation as close as possible
to the 2.5 percent government target. To achieve this aim, it has
raised interest rates six times since the last election, most
recently in June when rates went up 0.5 percent to 7.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of England's latest inflation report published earlier
this month warned that inflation was likely to remain above the
government's target for most of the next two years despite a sharp
downturn in the economy.
</P>
<P>
Also, it disappointed business leaders and trade unionists by
refusing to rule out another rise in interest rates, given the
uncertain outlook for inflation.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait, U.S. Troops to Hold Joint Exercise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Armed forces of the United
States and Kuwait will start late this month a four-month joint
military exercise code-named "Intrinsic Action 98-3", a
U.S. embassy news release said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The exercise, which will be held from August to December, is
part of the defense cooperation agreement signed between the two
countries, said the release.
</P>
<P>
It is designed to provide continued U.S. ground presence and
access in Kuwait, enhance Kuwaiti defense capabilities and
regional security posture.
</P>
<P>
It also aims to strengthen the bilateral military relations,
improve interoperability and battle staff proficiency between
U.S. and Kuwait forces, as well as enhance U.S. forces'
capability of rapid deployment in the region, the release said.
</P>
<P>
About 1,500 U.S. troops will take part in the exercise, among
which include a battalion task force, combat support units and
combat service support units.
</P>
<P>
Intrinsic Action exercise represents an opportunity for U.S.
army forces to train with Kuwaiti armed forces in Kuwait
while demonstrating U.S. capabilities and commitment to the
region, the release added.
</P>
<P>
The allied troops led by the U.S. helped oust the Iraqi
occupation forces from Kuwait in the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait and the U.S. signed a ten-year defense agreement in
September 1991, under which Kuwait allows the U.S. to store
military equipment in its territory, conduct joint air, land and
sea operations with Kuwaiti forces.

<HEADLINE> Internal Refugees in Angola Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Angola's internal refugees have
increased by 132,000 to nearly 1.2 million due to intense
situation in the country, the U.N. Agency for Coordinating human
assistance said in a press release here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It attributed the increase to the deadlock peace process which
pits troops of the National Union for Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA) against the government's and to UNITA's
reoccupation of parts of the area it had handed over to Luanda.
</P>
<P>
This has displaced many people who try hard to escape the
imminent war between the two sides, said the release.
</P>
<P>
Some regard the figure of new refugees at 190,000 as many of
them had yet to be identified, the agency said, adding that it
has admitted nearly 10,000 and cannot guarantee their basic needs
due to the shortage of funds and materials.
</P>
<P>
People blame UNITA for rearming itself and not abiding by
the 1994 Lusaka peace accords which ended the 19-year civil war
in Angola.
</P>
<P>
The number of refugees were as high as over three million at
the height of the civil war.

<P>
LONDON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
Tuesday offered his sympathies to his Spanish counterpart Jose
Maria Aznar, saying the death of two Spanish citizens in
Saturday's Omagh bombing was "monstrous".
</P>
<P>
The bodies of the two Spanish victims, 12-year-old Fernando
Blasco and 23-year-old Rocio Abad, early Tuesday were flown back
to Spain on a military aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Blair said in a 15-minute telephone conversation with Aznar
early that the bomb was the work of a "rump group of dissidents
who represented nobody," a British government spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"They had committed a crime against the whole community and
whole community had condemned it," said Blair, who is now in
France for summer holiday.
</P>
<P>
Aznar said that he was grateful for help offered to the other
10 Spanish people injured in the huge car bomb blast and expressed
his solidarity with British government in the hunt for the
bombers.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Not to Allow Use of Its Soil Against Osama </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan has made it clear
that it would not allow anybody to use its soil as a base for
military strike against Arab dissident Osama Bin Ladin who is
currently taking refuge in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"The government of Pakistan has not received any request from
the United States seeking consent for launching an operation
against Ladin from its soil," official sources were quoted as
saying by the independent News Network International (NNI).
</P>
<P>
"We do not serve the interests of other countries and we have
our own agenda to follow," the sources said in response to
speculation following the U.S. decision to withdraw its
non-emergency diplomats and citizens from Pakistan due to security
reasons.
</P>
<P>
National interest will be kept in view and will not be
compromised at any cost, they added.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan has no link, direct or indirect, with Osama Bin Ladin
and his agenda is purely of his own, we have nothing to do with
that," they said.
</P>
<P>
The sources dismissed the criticism that Pakistan should be
responsible for the Taliban's allowing the dissident to stay in
their country.
</P>
<P>
"It is their matter, we have nothing to do with it," the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
"Afghanistan is a sovereign country and to say that since we
recognize the Taliban Government, we should be responsible for
their giving refuge to Osama is absolutely wrong - we do not
interfere in the internal affairs of Afghanistan."
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on the closure of American centers and
evacuation of the non-essential personnel from its embassy and
consulates in Pakistan, the official sources said the fear of the
U.S. State Department "is erroneous and unwarranted."
</P>
<P>
About 200 American citizens left Islamabad for home on Tuesday
on a charted special plane following the State Department's Monday
order to withdraw from Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan on Sunday confirmed that it had arrested an Arab man
on August 7 and sent him to Kenya after investigations showed he
was involved in the terrorist bombing of two U.S. embassies in
East Africa. The suspect was reportedly proceeding from Pakistan
to Afghanistan where the anti-American Osama is living.

<HEADLINE> Ireland Deploys Crack Force at Border with Ulster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The Irish government Tuesday
decided to deploy a crack response unit to the border areas with
Britain's Northern Ireland to step up security following
Saturday's huge car bomb blast.
</P>
<P>
An Irish police spokesman was quoted by press reports from
Dublin as saying: "They (the crack force) are used in covert
operations. They are highly trained and hand picked."
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman refused to give further details of the
crack unit which would work with local police stations along the
border indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also dropped a hint that more Irish police may be
assigned to the border area in the future but added nothing was
confirmed.
</P>
<P>
It is widely suspected that Omagh bombing, which killed 28
people and injured more than 200 others, was masterminded by a
republican organization called the "Real IRA" (Irish Republican
Army) based in the northeastern border region of the Irish side.

<P>
LONDON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The Irish government announced
Tuesday that the country would fly all flags on state buildings at
half-mast until Saturday to honor the 28 people killed in Omagh
car bomb blast.
</P>
<P>
Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern was quoted by Reuters as

same."
</P>
<P>
Ahern, whose government has been striving to build a permanent
peace in Northern Ireland, also welcomed a call by Irish church
leaders for people to show sympathy for the victims by observing a
minute's silence on Saturday at 3:10 p.m. (1410 GMT), exactly a
week after the bloody blast.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Ahern, together with Irish President Mary
McAleese, would also attend an "Act of Prayerful Reflection" on
Saturday afternoon in the bomb-ravaged town of Omagh, 50 miles (80
km) west of Belfast, the statement said.

<P>
Commenting on Greek-Turkish relations, Kaklamanis said that the

</P>
<P>
As for the Cyprus problem, the president said that Nicosia had
right to secure its defense especially when 40 percent of its

<P>
Greece and Turkey are at odds for decades over their disputes
in the territorial waters, air space limits and the delimitation
of the continental shelf in the Aegean Sea and the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
With the nearing of deployment of the Russian-made S-300 anti-
aircraft missiles in Cyprus, relations between the two neighboring
countries have been worsening in recent months.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has threatened to use force to prevent the installation
of the missiles in Cyprus while Greece has insisted that the
divided island republic has the right to strengthen its defense
capacity by deploying the missiles.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Upgrades Forces in N. Cyprus: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Turkey has been upgrading its
military presence in the northern part of Cyprus since last
summer, Cypriot government spokesman Christos Stylianides said
here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Monday's statement by Defense Minister Yiannakis
Omirou that "Turkish occupation troops" are being strengthened
with new weapons over a year, Stylianides said "As we all know,
these troops are positioned in an offensive formation."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman told reporters that Cyprus' Foreign and Defense
Ministries are cooperating in recording facts and information "so
as to be more convincing" in future representations at regional or
international forum.
</P>
<P>
"It must be made clear that we are trying to boost our defense
capabilities because there is a specific reason, apart from other
existing reasons," he concluded.
</P>
<P>
Turkey landed troops in 1974 and took over the northern third
of the island in the wake of a failed Greek Cypriot coup,
allegedly to protect Turkish minorities.
</P>
<P>
The east Mediterranean island country has since remained
divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south, and the Turkish
Cypriot-controlled north, where they unilateral declared a
breakaway state in 1983, recognized only by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.N. chief's 1998 report on the U.N. operation
in Cyprus, there are estimatedly over 30,000 Turkish forces and
some 4,500 Turkish Cypriot troops in the north.
</P>
<P>
The Greek Cypriot National Guards strength in southern part of
the island, however, is approximately 14,500, reports said.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Industrial Growth to Be One Quarter in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan Ministry of Industry
Tuesday said the government will invest 308 million U.S. Dollars
into the industrial sector in a bid to attain a growth rate of 25
percent this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the Angolan Industrial Development Plan for
1998-2000 published by the ministry, the Angolan government will
spend 195 million U.S. Dollars in setting up about 100 industrial
enterprises to create 10,000 jobs, easing the serious
unemployment issue.
</P>
<P>
It will also invest 140 million U.S. Dollars into the food
processing industry, another priority in the development of the
national economy. For this nearly 172 million U.S. Dollars will
be saved from food imports.
</P>
<P>
In order to well implement these programs, the Angolan
government will take some more measures including exemption from
tariffs and taxes for the capital goods, and the domestic goods
in particular.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the government will cast away red tape to improve
the efficiency in the institutions for the sake of the
establishment and operation of the new firms.
</P>
<P>
The ministry of industry noted that the industrial output of
this southern African country grew by 92 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
It also pointed out that 24 percent of all the state-run
enterprises in Angola will be privatized in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Israel Ready to Carry Out 13% Withdrawal: Sharon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 18 (Xinhua) -- A leading hawk within Israel's
cabinet said Tuesday that despite his opposition, the government
had decided to carry out a 13 percent withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
National Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon, the leading
force believed to be behind the repeated delay in carrying out the
second stage Israeli troop pullback in the West Bank, blamed the
Palestinians for the delay in implementing the Israeli decision.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio quoted Sharon as saying that the government had
decided to go ahead with a 13 percent pullback in the second
stage and an additional 1 percent in the third.
</P>
<P>
Sharon has argued against accepting the U.S. plan, saying that
any pullback exceeding 9 percent would endanger Israel's security.
</P>
<P>
The talks over the second withdrawal have come to a virtual
halt after the two sides failed in the past weeks to narrow their
gaps over an American proposal calling for an additional 13.1
percent Israeli troop withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has expressed his
hope Sunday that the talks would be resumed this week.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian sources said U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright discussed the latest development in the peace process
Monday night in a telephone call to Palestinian National
Authority President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived in Cairo earlier Tuesday for talks with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to discuss ways to move forward
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Sharon also lashed out at the Palestinians' complaint over the
shortage of water supply by Israeli to the Palestinian areas,
saying that it was only another excuse to stop the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He said the water problem was actually caused by "operational
failure," arguing that as much as 40 percent of the water being
supplied to the Palestinian-controlled areas was lost because
their pipes were damaged.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have accused Israel of not fulfilling its
obligations mandated in the interim agreements by cutting short
their water supply.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian residents in many areas said they had no enough
drinking water while the Israelis had water supply for almost
everything.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai on Tuesday crossed the Lebanese-Israeli border and
inspected the Israeli-allied militia South Lebanon Army (SLA),
the SLA radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by Israeli Chief of Staff Shaul Mofaz and other
senior amry officials, Mordechai visited the eastern sector of
the occupied zone where the SLA command is headquartered, the
radio said.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai spoke highly of the military performance the SLA
soldiers have presented in the gunbattles with Lebanese resistance
guerrillas over the past years.
</P>
<P>
He singled out a victory gained two days ago when a guerrilla
was killed and another captured alive by SLA militiamen inside the
Israeli self-styled security zone.
</P>
<P>
His visit was interpreted by most Lebanese media operated
outside the zone as an Israeli effort to help restore morales of
the SlA commander Antoine Lahd who has just survived an armed coup.
</P>
<P>
Last month, SLA Chief of Staff Karamallah Saeed was said to
have staged an aborted putsch with dozens of officers and hundreds
of noncoms and soldiers to topple Lahd's dictatorship and install
a command council on a collective leadership basis.
</P>
<P>
Senior Israeli army and intelligence officers serving in the
enclave initially split over the coup attempt and some who
support Lahd tipped him about the would-be mutiny.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu then reportedly
stepped in to support Lahd but prohibited him from taking any
disciplinary action against the mutineers.
</P>
<P>
Lahd has been sentenced to death in absentia by a Lebanese
military court which found him guilty of collaborating with an
enemy country - Israel - with which Lebanon is formally at war.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a 1,200-square-kilometer security zone in
south Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north
from cross-border attack by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the Lahd-led 2,500-strong SLA has been helping
about 1m,500 Israeli forces police the enclave where Lebanese
resistance movement is fighting to oust Israeli occupation.

LONDON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Prince Charles Tuesday
visited the bomb-devastated Northern Irish town of Omagh and
placed fresh flowers at the site of the huge car bombing.
</P>
<P>
After a tour of the blast-shattered town center, the Prince
said that he was appalled and horrified by Saturday's bombing
which killed 28 people and injured more than 200 others.
</P>
<P>
"The least I could do is to come here to show my support and
sympathy to those who have to carry the worst of the burden of
looking after the casualties," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I do have some understanding of the awful horrors that people
have to put up with when they lose loved ones," said Charles,
whose uncle Lord Mountbatten was killed in a terrorist bomb blast
in 1979.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Knesset Urges Condemnation on Anti-Israel Website </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The Foreign Affairs and
Defense Committee of Israeli Knesset (parliament) Tuesday called
for condemnation on an anti-Israel Internet website set up by the
Palestinian National Liberation Movement (Fatah).
</P>
<P>
Uzi Landau, chairman of the committee, said it is outrageous
that the Fatah organization, which was under the control of the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat, has
released such material.
</P>
<P>
Landau called on both left-wing and right-wing Israeli
politicians to condemn the Palestinian move.
</P>
<P>
The constitution of the Fatah website, released early this
month, calls for the destruction of Israel and lists the goal of
the organization as "complete liberation of Palestine and
eradication of Zionist economic, political, military and cultural
existence."
</P>
<P>
It also says "the Palestinian Arab people's armed revolution is
a decisive factor in the liberation fight and in uprooting the
Zionist existence, and this struggle will not cease unless the
Zionist state is demolished and Palestine is completely liberated."
</P>
<P>
Landau said this constitution is in some ways worse than the
articles in the Palestinian Covenant, which also call for
Israel's destruction. Israel has strong demanded that these
clauses be abolished.
</P>
<P>
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks have been stalled for months
over the extent of the second Israeli troop pullback from the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
Israel insists that it would accept a 13-percent withdrawal on
condition that the PNA stop anti-Israel incitement and convene the
Palestinian National Council to change its covenant.

<HEADLINE> 1,000 More Iranian Pilgrims Cross Into Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 18 (Xinhua)-- A third batch of some 1,000
Iranian pilgrims arrived at the Al-Munthiriya border complex
Tuesday on their way to visit Shiite Muslim holy shrines in
southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The official Iraqi News Agency (INA) quoted the Iraqi general
superviser at the complex as saying that all requirements for the
Iranians' transport and accommodation would be ensured.
</P>
<P>
The number of Iranian pilgrims who have crossed into Iraq since
last week has amounted to 2,000, and 1,000 more pilgrims are due
to arrive on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, for the first time in 18 years, 750 Iranian
pilgrims crossed the Iranian-Iraqi border into Iraq to visit the
holy sites. The second batch of 250 Iranian pilgrims arrived in
Iraq on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The INA said these Iranian pilgrims would visit holy shrines in
Kerbela and Najaf in southern Iraq, holy sites restored over
recent years.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement reached between the two countries, 3,000
Iranian and Iraqi pilgrims are to travel to either country to
pay pilgrimage to holy sites.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian move is viewed by diplomats here as a new step to
further improve the its relations with Iraq. In the past, the
Iranian government banned Iranian citizens from entering Iraq,
citing security reasons.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Iraq had fought an eight-year-long war between 1980
and 1988 due to a border dispute, leaving around 1 million people
dead or injured.
</P>
<P>
But the elections of the moderate President Mohammad Khatami
last year opened the door for improving Iranian ties with the rest
of world, especially the Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Iraq and Iran repatriated around 6,000 POWs and detainees in
April this year in the largest swap of POWs since 1991, in an
effort to solve all the issues left from the war that block the
normalization of bilateral relations.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The central organ of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) Tuesday condemned the
recourse to armed rebellion in the settlement of grievances in
the Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
The 50th Ordinary Session of the OAU Mechanism for Conflict
Prevention, Management and Resolution issued a seven-point
communique here, calling upon the rebels in Democratic Congo to
immediately lay down their arms and seek constructive dialog with
the government in order to seek redress to their grievances.
</P>
<P>
The session at ambassadorial level was chaired Monday by
T.A.G. Makombe, Ambassador of Zimbabwe to Ethiopia who doubles as
Permanent Representative to the OAU here.
</P>
<P>
The central organ expressed its grave concern at the unfolding
crisis in Democratic Congo and its possible implications for
peace, security and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
It also condemned all external interventions in the internal
affairs of that country under any pretext whatsoever and called
for an immediate end to all such external interventions.
</P>
<P>
The OAU organ said that it fully supports and endorses the
initiatives and approaches launched by the regional summit held
in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe, which was aimed at working out a
framework for defusing the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The central organ further supported the follow-up initiatives
undertaken by the ministers of foreign affairs and defense of
Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia, Tanzania and Zambia.
</P>
<P>
It requested OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim to enter
into urgent consultations with all parties concerned and closely
coordinate OAU's efforts with those countries in the region and
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, with a view to seeking a
speedy and peaceful end to the conflict in the central African
country.

<HEADLINE> Polls: Majority Americans Want Clinton Stay on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Most Americans accept U.S.
President Bill Clinton's confession that he had an inappropriate
sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky and want the entire
matter dropped and Clinton stay on as president, according to
polls released on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a CNN/USA Today/Gallup Poll, about two-thirds of all
Americans said they want him to remain in office until the end of
his term and they do not want Congress to impeach him.
</P>
<P>
The poll showed that 72 percent of the Americans did not want
Clinton resign and 65 percent want the Lewinsky matter end.
</P>
<P>
An initial poll conducted by CNN showed 53 percent of Americans
were satisfied with Clinton's remarks and his job approval rating
remained steady at 62 percent.
</P>
<P>
But the polls also showed that Clinton's personal rating
dropped by 20 percentage points to 40 percent from 60 percent a
week ago. His unfavorable rating rose 10 points over the same
period to 48 percent.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, in a televised speech Monday night, admitted that he
had a sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky and deceived the
public and his wife, but insisted he broke no law.
</P>
<P>
A poll taken by ABC News right after the speech showed Clinton
won a 10-point boost in job approval by going public and admitting
he misled the American people about his relationship with the
former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-eight percent of Americans said Clinton should not
resign, up 11 percentage points from Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The president's job approval rating also held steady in all the
polls conducted after the speech.
</P>
<P>
A CBS News/New York Times poll showed 68 percent of those
surveyed approved Clinton's job performance, up from 67 percent a
week ago.
</P>
<P>
An NBC/Wall Street Journal poll showed that 62 percent of those
polled and 75 percent of those who watched Clinton's speech on
television believed the president's account.
</P>
<P>
The poll also showed that 66 percent opposed impeachment
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
Only 18 percent said he should resign and 12 percent said he
should be impeached, while 68 percent said the investigation
should be dropped.
</P>
<P>
Analyzing Clinton's continued strong performance ratings, ABC
pollster Gary Langer said there were two reasons: "The scandal's
lack of relevance to most Americans, and the fact that most give
him credit for the strong economy."

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan said
Tuesday that the ties between Jordan and Sudan are strong and need
to be further expanded.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with visiting Sudanese Foreign Minister
Mustafa Osman Ismail, Hassan said new dimensions have been added
to the bilateral relations, especially in the investment, trade
and agricultural fields, Jordan's official Petra news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul-Salam Majali also met during the
day with Ismail, who arrived here on Monday for a three-day visit,
the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Majali said that Jordanian businessmen in the private sector
are keen on investing in Sudanese projects, especially in the
agricultural field.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the cooperation and coordination
between the two countries will further expand, especially in the
private sector.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and Sudan agreed to cooperate in agriculture and trade
in 1997. But most of the projects they discussed then have not
been carried out. Ismail's visit is believed to be aimed at
speeding up the implementation of the projects in his country.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Jordan will help Sudan plant crops, fodder
and wheat in particular, and raise livestock in an area of 16
square kilometers for export to Jordan.

<HEADLINE> Istanbul's Misir Market Blast Caused by PKK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Turkey confirmed Tuesday that
the explosion which killed seven people in Istanbul's Misir
Market on July 9 was caused by a time bomb planted by rebels of
the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
The semi-official Anatolia News Agency quoted Police chief
Hasan Ozdemir as saying in Istanbul that a PKK member nicknamed
"Kemal" and 18 others were responsible for the blast which also
left 121 people, including nine foreigners, injured.
</P>
<P>
The explosion was initially said to be caused by a gas
container used for a stove at a food stand in the 200-year-old
market, a tourist attraction.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Interior Minister Murat Basesgioglu has said
that "The Turkish police made two investigations into the strong
explosion, but found no trace for a bomb explosion."
</P>
<P>
However, Ozdemir said that Kemal, who put the bomb near the
buffet in the Market, and the 18 others had been caught in
Istanbul in a massive operation after the blast.
</P>
<P>
The operation was launched based on information revealed by a
female PKK militant detained in Istanbul with explosives in her
bag, one day after the blast.
</P>
<P>
The 17th-century Misir Market, offering exotic food, spices
and dried fruits in hundreds of stands, is a favorite stop on
most tourist itineraries.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting for independence in the southeast of
Turkey since August 1984. About 35,000 people, including PKK
rebels, government troops and civilians, have been killed in
conflicts.

<HEADLINE> Albright Tours Bombed U.S. Embassies in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 18 (Xinhua) - U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright Tuesday toured the bombed U.S. embassy here at
the second-leg of her one-day African tour aimed at expressing
grief for victims of August 7 bombings in Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
"I have come to Nairobi today to the sorrowful and now scared
location to deliver a message from the American people. That
message began with sadness and grief," Albright said at the bombing
site after meeting with Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi.
</P>
<P>
"Almost every family in every part of Kenya has been touched
by the tragedy," she noted, saying the U]}rBM"AfQ5R4epathy" especially with the
Kenyan innocents.
</P>
<P>
The bomb raid killed 247 people and nearly 5,000 in the Kenyan
capital while another almost simultaneous blast claimed 10 lives
and wounded some 70 in Dar es Salaam. The American toll was 12,
all killed in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
Albright said that the U.S. will build up closer ties with
Kenya and Tanzania, set up "substantial" fund to assist victims
and their families and help the recovery of the two countries
from the bombing.
</P>
<P>
"The terrorists would like nothing better than to drive us
apart," she said, "We must not let them."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administration will also work hard together with the
two eastern African countries to bring the cold-blooded bombers
to justice, she noted.
</P>
<P>
Although the bombs were targeted at the U.S. embassies, the
overwhelming number of dead and injured were ordinary Kenyans and
Tanzanians, and Washington has been accused of caring more for
its own citizens killed.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said they saw U.S. marines preventing volunteer
rescue workers from reaching victims trapped by the blast in
their robust attempts to secure the mission, resulting in sharp
and continuous criticisms from local media following the blast.
</P>
<P>
Countering the accusations, Albright said that she was
"anguished" at criticism of Americans' conduct.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot say we acted perfectly and... there were
misunderstandings... but I believe the allegations of callousness
are wrong," she said.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. marines limited access to the embassy... because
they were afraid the weakened building would collapsed... and
because they were concerned about the possibly second
terriorists's attack," Albright explained.
</P>
<P>
Having finished her speech, Albright laid a fresh wreath
before a cone-shaped tomb made of cement lumps smashed during the
bombing. She was accompanied by Kenyan Foreign Minister Bonaya
Godana.
</P>
<P>
Then she visited the injured in the Kenyatta National
Hospital. The U.S. state secretary was scheduled to leave for
Washington directly Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
In the morning, she visited the bombed U.S. embassy in Dar es
Salaam, consoled the Tanzanian injured and met with Tanzanian
Vice-President Omar Ali Juma.

KUWAIT CITY, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Secretary General of the
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Jamil Hujailan met Tuesday in
Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, with a European Union (EU) diplomat to
prepare for a meeting of the GCC and EU foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
Hujailan met with Austria's charge d'affaires in Riyadh Frederic
Stivet, whose country is holding the rotating EU presidency,
mainly to discuss the necessary steps to establish a common free
trade zone and boosting bilateral commercial ties.
</P>
<P>
The issues are expected to dominate the two-day meeting of
foreign ministers of the GCC and EU due to be held in Luxembourg
on October 26.
</P>
<P>
GCC sources were quoted by the KUNA as saying that the meeting
would cover a host of regional and international affairs, notably
the latest standoff between Iraq and the United Nations caused by
Iraq's decision to suspend cooperation with the U.N. special
commission charged with eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will also discuss ways to revive the deadlocked
Middle East peace process and the EU's role in pressing Israel to
honor all the agreements it signed with the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that GCC states were anxious to sign a free
trade agreement with the EU, which has been debated by the two
sides for years with the aim of developing their commercial ties.
</P>
<P>
The EU has linked the signing of the agreement to integrating
custom tariffs among GCC countries, which could be approved at the
coming GCC summit in December in Abu Dhabi, the United Arab
Emirates.

<HEADLINE> UK Government Condemns Real IRA's Mass Murder Apology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Northern Ireland
Secretary Mo Mowlam Tuesday condemned the Real IRA's statement
about the Omagh bombing as a "pathetic attempt" to find an excuse
for the mass murder.
</P>
<P>
The Real IRA, a dissident Irish Republican Army paramilitary
group, has claimed responsibility for the bombing, which killed 28
people and injured more than 200 others.
</P>
<P>
"Despite media reports it was not our intention at any time to
kill any civilians. It was a commercial target, part of the
on-going war against Brits. We offer apologies to the civilians,"
said a male caller in a codeworded phone call to an Irish
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
However, Mowlam said that Real IRA, which is based in
northeastern border region of the Irish side, were "murderers pure
and simple".
</P>
<P>
"I think it is contemptible. It is an insult to the people of
Omagh, who have done so much in these last days to try to overcome
the ravages that the bomb created," she said.
</P>
<P>
She also stressed: "The sole responsibility lies with the
bombers. We and the Irish government will continue to do all we
can to hunt them down."

<HEADLINE> Japanese Firms' R&AMP;D Grows Despite Recession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Twenty top Japanese companies
have raised their spending on research and development (R&AMP;D) this
year by an average of 3.3 percent over 1997, the U.S. Investor's
Business Daily said on Tuesday, quoting a Japanese think tank.
</P>
<P>
That has happened when the Japanese economy is in recession.
</P>
<P>
The government-funded Japan Economic Institute (JEI) reported
recently that Toyota Motor Corp., Matsushita Electric Industrial
Co., NEC Corp., Fujitsu LTD and Sony Corp. are spending a total of
4.4 trillion yen or 34.7 billion U.S. dollars in fiscal '98.
</P>
<P>
Among them Matsushita is investing 4 billion dollars and Toyota
3.4 billion dollars for the purpose.
</P>
<P>
Much of the R&AMP;D money is pouring into developing
Web-controllable consumer goods like ''intelligence'' household
gadgets and a next generation of ''intelligence autos'' that will
make greater use of cyber-navigation aids like the global
positioning system, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"Japanese high tech is also taking a cue from U.S. firms,
which made strong R&AMP;D efforts in electronics, communications,
Internet applications and e-commerce during the 1980s to develop
new markets or take over high value-added ones," the paper noted.
</P>
<P>
Japanese officials and companies hope that an improvement in
high technology will enable Japan to compete against nations with
currency and labor-cost advantages, analysts said.

<HEADLINE> Switzerland Ought to Learn Lesson from History:  Vice President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Switzerland should draw the
political lesson from its behavior during World War II, Vice
President of the Swiss Federal Council Mrs Ruth Dreifuss said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Whiling welcoming a settlement reached last week between two
Swiss banks and lawyers for Jewish claimants for their
Holocaust-era assets in Swiss banks, Dreifuss told the Geneva
daily Le Temps that his country should continue the process of
"confronting our own history".
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the 1.25-billion-dollar deal to return money to
those who claimed to have assets in Swiss banks during the war,
Dreifuss said, "An injustice has been corrected, a great weight
has been lifted. But one can't say that things are back to normal
as if nothing happened."
</P>
<P>
"Our role is not to return money that we never had but to draw
the political lesson from Switzerland's behaviour during the war,"
said Dreifuss who is also the interior minister and the only
Jewish member of the Swiss cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Dreifuss said the Berne government would defend the central
bank "against all pressures"' over its wartime purchases of looted
gold from Nazi Germany.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) announced that it
would discuss the settlement at the extraordinary meeting of the
supervisory council of the Swiss central bank scheduled on Friday.
</P>
<P>
But the central bank declined to say if any decision would be
taken at the meeting on whether it should contribute to the
1.25-billion-dollar Holocaust settlement.
</P>
<P>
UBS and Credit Suisse, Switzerland's two biggest banks which
made the deal with the claimants on August 12 in New York, have
said they would like other firms and the central bank to
contribute to the settlement.
</P>
<P>
The SNB has already donated 100 million Swiss francs (66.36
million U.S. dollars) to a 270 million franc humanitarian fund set
up by Swiss banks and industry last year to aid needy Holocaust
victims and their families.

<HEADLINE> Russia Pledges to Help Tajikistan if Taliban  Violates Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Tuesday pledged help to
Tajikistan if Taliban fighters of Afghanistan breach the
Afghan-Tajik border, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Russian Border Service Director Nikolai Bordyuzha told Tajik
President Emomali Rakhmonov that Moscow would give all necessary
help in case the Taliban militia threatens the Tajik stretch of
the CIS southern border, Tajik presidential adviser on defense and
law enforcement Mizrob Kabirov said.
</P>
<P>
However, Kabiro said there is no direct threat to the border,
though the situation may worsen at any moment.
</P>
<P>
Bordyuzha, sent by Russian President Boris Yeltsin to inspect
the border, will visit areas controlled by Russia's Moscow and
Pyanzh border units, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Fierce fighting is reportedly raging between Taliban units and
the Masud-led anti-Taliban coalition about 20 kilometers from the
Pyanj, the river demarcating the border.
</P>
<P>
Kabiro said Masud has retaken three small communities in the
Parhar province and advanced to the town of Talukan on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Anti-Taliban supporters resorted to guerrilla tactics of
striking at the enemy from the rear," he added.
</P>
<P>
Tension is running high along the border amid mounting fear of
an influx of Afghan refugees fleeing the fighting.
</P>
<P>
"Several tens of thousands of refugees can flow into Tajikistan
since the Taliban movement is conducting a forceful deportation of
ethnic Tajiks and Uzbeks from the captured areas," Kabiro said.
</P>
<P>
"In this case, Tajikistan cannot accept and temporarily
accommodate them without from the CIS, above all from Russia," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The CIS, or Commonwealth of Independent States, groups 12 of
the 15 former Soviet republics. The three Baltic republics did not
join the commonwealth.

<P>
WASHINGTON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Dick Morris, former
consultant of President Bill Clinton, arrived on Tuesday to
testify before the grand jury probing the White House sex and
perjury case.
</P>
<P>
"Presumably they're going to ask me about conversations I had
with the president in the two or three days after the Monica
Lewinsky scandal became public," Morris said before entering the
federal courthouse where the closed-door panel was meeting.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Morris told Fox News Channel that Clinton called him
"the day, the moment the scandal broke, and we had a lengthy
conversation, and we had four others, and that's what they are
going to ask me about."
</P>
<P>
Clinton admitted in a nationally televised address Monday night
that he had an inappropriate relationship with Lewinsky, a former
White House intern.
</P>
<P>
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr is investigating whether
Clinton committed perjury by denying a sexual relationship with
Lewinsky in a sworn statement and whether he obstructed justice or
suborned perjury.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Russian blue chip stocks
continued their downturn Tuesday amid confusion as how the
government would restructure the state debt.
</P>
<P>
The prices on the most liquid Russian stocks fell 8-10 percent
on very thin volume, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The RTS-Interfax Compsite Ruble Index dropped 9.65 percent to
25.29. The RTS1-Interfax index fell 9 percent to close at 99.58,
the first time it has closed below the 100-point base value.
</P>
<P>
Observers believe that quotes will continue to slide as few
people are willing to buy.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a crisis of confidence has further depressed
trading activity on the Russian Trading System.
</P>
<P>
At the close of trading on the RTS Tuesday, Unified Energy
System of Russia was down 10 percent to 0.071/0.072 U.S. dollar on
volume of 69.356 million shares, Lukoil fell 10 percent to

The remaining stocks listed were only traded sporadically at
extremely low volumes. Total volume on the RTS was 11.653 million

<HEADLINE> New Deadline Set for Nominations for Rwanda Tribunal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
decided Tuesday to further extend the deadline for nominations of
judges to the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda until
September 14.
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken in reaction to U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan's proposal for the delay.
</P>
<P>
Annan said he had received from U.N. member states only 14
nominations for judges to the Tribunal's Trial Chambers, short of
the required minimum number of 18.
</P>
<P>
The Statute of the Tribunal requests the establishment of a
list of not less than 18 and not more than 27 candidates to take
due account of adequate representation of the world's principal
legal systems on the Tribunal.
</P>
<P>
The deadline was extended last month for the same reason.
</P>
<P>
The Tribunal was set up in Tanzania's Arusha in 1994 to try
those accused of plotting and carrying out a massive slaughter in
the East African country of Rwanda.

<HEADLINE> Bullish Day for European Stock Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The European shares stock saw the
bull coming back on Tuesday, as major markets enjoyed a sharp
rise, apparently relieved from Russia's devaluation of the rouble.
</P>
<P>
London came up with a record one-day point gain, following the
bullish trend in Europe and on Wall Street. The FTSE 100 chalked
up a 181-point advance to close at 5648.2, eclipsing the
160.8-point rise of last September.
</P>
<P>
Stocks traded in the black for the whole session, as the
concerns which had dogged the market of late faded one after
another.
</P>
<P>
But Tuesday's rise of 3.3 percent by the FTSE 100 was only the
ninth biggest in percentage terms, well adrift of the 7.32 percent
record rise of October 21 1987.
</P>
<P>
Russia's troubles moved into the background, while Japanese
issues had moved higher overnight to complete the supportive
picture, according to market analysts.
</P>
<P>
Figures released earlier today showed UK's underlying inflation
move closer to the government's 2.5 percent target rate, which led
some economists to state that interest rates have now peaked.
</P>
<P>
"We've seen a lot of business this afternoon," said one senior
equities dealer. "I think we are in for a settled period now, at
least until the end of the week."
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, the Dax closed up a whopping 170.12 points at
5602.15 - boosted by another show of strength on Wall Street, a
surge in Deutsche Telekom and renewed interest in Viag and Adidas,
as selective buying gave recent underperformers the benefit of the
doubt.
</P>
<P>
The Paris' bourse delivered good gains, too, with the CAC-40
closing at 4123.25, up 139.44 points.
</P>
<P>
However, traders said CAC's rally is more a technical rebound
than a strong change in sentiment, after shares had fallen steeply
on Monday in thin trading.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Probe Team Swoops on Hotel in Nairobi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan-U.S. joint probe
team on August 7 bombing in Nairobi raided a hotel Tuesday where
the bomb hitting the U.S. embassy here was believed to be made,
local sources said.
</P>
<P>
Six detectives from the Kenyan Criminal Investigation
Department (CID) and 15 agents of the U.S. Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) searched rooms in the Hill Top Hotel off
Accra Road, Nairobi, at 11:30 a.m. Tuesday, according to the
sources.
</P>
<P>
Wearing bullet-proof vests and armed with rifles, the
investigators immediately sealed off the hotel and had for
two-and-a-half hours conducted a minute search of all the rooms
and a series of forensic examinations especially in two rooms.
</P>
<P>
It was said that the bomb -- 800 kilograms of high explosive
TNT -- was assembled in these two rooms in the hotel and the
hotel manager has been placed under arrest.
</P>
<P>
The two rooms in the hotel were rented by four bomb suspects
-- two Palestinians, an Egyptian and a Saudi Arabian -- from
August 3 to August 7.
</P>
<P>
No comments are available from either CID or FBI, whose joint
team is still questioning a key suspect, identified as Mohammed
Saddiq Howaida who was sent back by the Pakistani authority over
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Unconfirmed reports said it is believed that Mohammed Saddiq
Howaida, who checked in the Hill Top Hotel on August 4, had five
accomplices. Three of them died in the bombing and two others are
still at large.
</P>
<P>
The detained suspect left Nairobi via the Jomo Kenyatta
International Airport on August 6 at 9:00 p.m.(local time) after
ensuring that everything was set for the explosion at 10.30 a.m.
the following day.
</P>
<P>
He was arrested at the Karachi airport on the day the bomb
exploded because immigration officials noticed his face did not
match the photo carried in his passport.
</P>
<P>
The explosive used, TNT (trinitrotoluene), is a pale yellow,
solid organic nitrogen compound, according to unconfirmed
reports.
</P>
<P>
The bomb hit the U.S. embassy which is located in a busy
commercial area in the Kenyan capital, killing 247 people and
injured around 5,000 others.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright toured the bombed
U.S. embassies in Tanzania and Kenya Tuesday and expressed grief
for U.S. and African victims.

<HEADLINE> Uganda to Start HIV Vaccine Trials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan Minister of Health
Crispus Kiyonga said Tuesday that HIV vaccine trials will start
in Uganda very soon.
</P>
<P>
Kiyonga announced the plan in a presentation to the parliament on
the development in the HIV/AIDS control and prevention program,
reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The process of developing a vaccine goes through four stages
and the one to be tested here is of the first stage, he said.
</P>
<P>
The vaccine to be tried on a group of 40 people in Uganda has
already been tested in other places of the world like Europe,
America and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The individuals in the group are informed of what is to be
done and what is expected in the process of testing. They can
withdraw from the test at any time, he added.
</P>
<P>
These participants will get adequate insurance cover although
no serious complications are expected to arise.
</P>
<P>
The market price of the drugs annually per patient is between
four to six million Ugandan Shillings (3,500 to 5,000 U.S.
Dollars), said Kiyonga, adding that it is too expensive for the
government to subsidize the cost.
</P>
<P>
However, he said UNICEF (the United Nations Children's Fund)
is spearheading a project to set up a fund to facilitate purchase
of drugs to deal with mother-to-child transmission of HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the ministry is studying the feasibility of
setting up a solidarity fund to which the general public can
contribute, he added.

<HEADLINE> Hongkong Telecom Urges SMEs To Tackle Millennium Bug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Hongkong Telecom, a leading
telecom provider in Hong Kong, on Wednesday urged small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to start addressing the millennium
bug problem before it is too late.
</P>
<P>
The company, which started its own millennium bug removal
exercise more than two years ago, said it is ready to apply its
expertise and experience to help SMEs.
</P>
<P>
Dr Chan Chun-leung, head of the company's Year 2000 Program,
said there is a general misunderstanding among SMEs in Hong Kong
that the millennium bug would not hit them during the period up to
the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
"Although the operation of computers and other electronic
equipment, if not Year 2000 compliant, will not be affected until
we cross over into the Year 2000, the survival of businesses may
be under threat much earlier," Chan said.
</P>
<P>
To protect their investment and ensure smooth transition of
their operations into the Year 2000, banks are beginning to ask
for proof of Year 2000 compliance from businesses approaching them
for loans, and large corporations are also eager to ascertain
whether their business partners are taking care of the problem, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Chan urged SMEs to address the millennium bug right now. "A
wide array of electronic equipment will be affected by the bug and
identifying all the problem areas in the different equipment and
fixing them takes time," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hongkong Telecom, which started tackling the problem in
mid-1996, was one of the first few major corporations in Hong Kong
to do so. Its millennium bug removal exercise is already 80
percent completed and by the end of the year the company would be
"bug free", according to Chan.
</P>
<P>
Drawing on its hands-on experience, Hongkong Telecom provides
SMEs Year 2000 Compliance Assessment Service, including checking
of equipment, presentation of a report with solution
recommendations, replacement services for non-compliant hardware
as well as software migration service.

<P>
"France does not exclude the probability of action in the name

While emphasizing that the humanitarian situation of Albanian
civilians who have fled their homes is "extremely worrying," he
said that such an operation could be launched by French
"authorities of health and humanitarian action."
</P>
<P>
France is also joining diplomatic efforts aimed at exerting
pressure on both the Serb authorities and Albanians for a
resumption of talks, he said.
</P>
<P>
Some 200,000 ethnic Albanians have fled their homes over the
past several weeks because of fighting between Serb forces and the
separatist Kosovo Liberation Army.

<HEADLINE> Liaoning Keeps On Guard Against Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Liaoning
Province is still on guard against flooding on the Liaohe River
caused by recent heavy rains, while rebuilding work has already
begun in some flooded areas.
</P>
<P>
Some 5.39 million mu (15 mu equals to one hectare) of arable
land has been flooded, and 2.26 million people have been affected
by flooding in Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Guoguang, governor of Liaoning, warned that all local
government departments should keep vigilant against the floods,
though the local flood situation is not as serious as along
the Songhua and Nenjiang rivers in the north and the Yangtze
River in the south.
</P>
<P>
Most of the province's large and medium-sized industrial cities
are located in the Liaohe River Valleys. Liaoning's provincial
government has mobilized a team of 1,500 people to patrol the
700-kilometer river embankments day and night.
</P>
<P>
About 300,000 people are fully prepared for another flood
peak in the cities and counties along the river, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
The province reportedly invested more than one billion yuan in
preparing local water-conservation projects before this year's
flood season.
</P>
<P>
Some 210 oil wells in the flooded Liaohe Oil Field, China's
third largest, have resumed production. Flooding had forced the
closure of 565 wells in the oil field.
</P>
<P>
The Shenyang Railway Administration has also taken measures to
safeguard local rail transportation, and to guarantee that
disaster-relief materials would be delivered to flooded areas as
soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> Iran Seeks Release of Nationals in Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi said on Wednesday that Tehran will
take "every action it deems necessary" to secure release of its
citizens from captivity of the Afghan Taliban militia.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said the option to handle the case is on the agenda
of the foreign ministry, which is busy examining diplomatic
channels to persuade the Taliban to free the Iranians, the
official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
"If we reach the point that release of the Iranian nationals
will be available through diplomatic means, then we will go ahead
with it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said that the foreign ministry has launched
extensive diplomatic initiatives to bring home those taken
hostage by the Taliban and Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi is
personally supervising the operations.
</P>
<P>
Iran alleged the Taliban militia kidnaped 11 Iranian diplomats,
an IRNA reporter and 35 truck drivers after it conquered
Mazar-e-Sharif in northern Afghanistan, the main stronghold of the
Tehran-backed opposition the Northern Alliance.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban has admitted the arrest of 35 Iranian citizens but
denied holding any Iranian diplomats. It argued those Iranians, if
arrested, could not recognized as diplomats and will be punished
as agents of an enemy government.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian leadership has warned that Iran can not tolerate
the captivity of its nationals by the Afghan student militia,
reportedly backed by Pakistan in its rapid rise to prominence and
sweeping control over most of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban called the warning an interference in Afghanistan
and insisted it has no information about the whereabouts of the
Iranian diplomats.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi also said Tehran will strongly react to any possible
violation of Iranian border by the Taliban, although it has no
intention of interfering in the neighbor's affairs or provoking
border conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Iran has always recommended the rival parties in Afghanistan to
follow the policy of dialogue and negotiation and to form a
broad-based government in the country, he added.
</P>
<P>
He called on the United Nations to take a role in settling the
Afghan crisis.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Urges End to U.S.-South Korean Military Exercise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) Wednesday called on the United States and
South Korea to stop their ongoing joint military exercise
immediately.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released by the representative department of the
the Korean People's Army stationed in Panmunjom, the DPRK
condemned the large-scale war game as "a provocative and
aggressive action."
</P>
<P>
The statement said the exercise, code-named Ulchi Focus Lens
(UFL), together with those having concluded before, show that the
United States actually has not given up its policy of military
containment of the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
It stressed the DPRK will not ignore the provocation which is
given by the United States by staging a risky military exercise as
the DPRK and the United States hold talks designed theoretically
to prevent military conflict on the Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
If the United States and South Korea will not seek a settlement
to the Korean peninsula issue through dialogue, the DPRK will
exercise its right of military choice, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The military exercise, starting Monday, involves 13,000
U.S. military personnel and 70,000 South Korean forces, and is
scheduled to run until August 29.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK Foreign Ministry has already expressed its
condemnation of the annual exercise, which began in the mid-1970s
and is still being conducted in the post-Cold War 1990s.

<HEADLINE> Greece Favors Political Solution to Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Greece repeated its backing
Wednesday of a political solution to the crisis in the Yugoslav
province of Kosovo where an ethnic Albanian majority has been
seeking independence.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in parliament, Greek Defense Minister Akis
Tsohatzopoulos described the Kosovo crisis as "a political
problem."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the official said the Greek government backed the
ongoing exercise conducted by the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) in Albania because "it could facilitate a
political solution in the region."
</P>
<P>
In Albania, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) began
a military exercise on Monday code-named "Cooperative
Assembly '98," in a bid to show to Belgrade that the alliance is
ready to intervene at any time in the region.
</P>
<P>
Greece is currently participating in the NATO exercise with
a C-130 military transport aircraft, two F-16 fighter jets, two
helicopters and a company of paratroopers.
</P>
<P>
Greece has also sent a medical team to provide services to
residents of remote villages in central Albania and in areas near
the NATO exercise.
</P>
<P>
The defense minister also stressed that minorities should not
be allowed to change borders in the Balkan region, referring in
particular to extreme elements among Kosovo Albanians seeking
integration into neighboring Albania.
</P>
<P>
Tensions have been running high in Kosovo -- where ethnic
Albanians outnumber Serbs nine to one -- since February when
ethnic Albanians clashed with Serb police.
</P>
<P>
More than 200,000 people have been displaced from their homes
and farms in Kosovo during the past six months.

<HEADLINE> Russian Monthly Industrial Output Sees Record Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Russia's industrial output in
July fell 9.4 percent from the same period last year, the
biggest drop since December 1994, the State Statistics Committee
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This has been only one of a series of bad news announcements
hitting the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade said
Tuesday that Russia's crude oil export earnings in the first six
months of the year dropped almost a quarter from the same period
last year, despite increased shipping.
</P>
<P>
Revenues from natural gas exports also shrank 18.4 percent, the
ministry said, blaming the drop on a 16 percent cut in average
contract export prices.
</P>
<P>
Industrial output in the first seven months as a whole fell by
1.3 percent from the same period in 1997 to 905 billion rubles
(about 130 billion U.S. dollars), the Statistics Committee said.
</P>
<P>
Most key sectors posted reduced output in July including
chemicals and petrochemicals, iron and steel, engineering and
metallurgy, light industry, food industry, power industry, fuel
industry and non-ferrous metals.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months, Russia's overall exports shrank by 13
percent, down from 40.7 billion dollars to 35.4 billion dollars,
the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade said.
</P>
<P>
Exports to other CIS countries fell 6.2 percent to 7.4 billion
dollars and exports to the rest of the world dropped 14.7 percent
to 28 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Besides the fall in oil and gas prices, culprits that caused
Russia's exports slump also included price dips for other products.
</P>
<P>
Average contract prices fell 11 percent for iron ore and
concentrate, 24 percent for hard coal and coke, 29 percent for
ammonia, 23 percent for methanol, 42 percent for nitrogen
fertilizers, 15 percent for synthetic rubber, 24 percent for logs
and 20 percent for copper and nickel.
</P>
<P>
However, the country's imports grew 12.8 percent to 26.3
billion dollars in the first half of the year. The trend will
inevitably be reversed in the wake of an effective devaluation of
the ruble.
</P>
<P>
The government and the central bank on Monday raised the
ceiling of the currency corridor from 6.3 rubles to the dollar to
9.5 rubles to the dollar.

<HEADLINE> Flood Situation Improves Slightly in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The flood situation in Bangladesh
slightly improved on Wednesday as water receded at several points
in the country's three major river basins, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Major rivers in the three basins of the Brahmaputra, the
Ganges, and the Meghna were flowing above the danger level at 19
points, down from 23 points on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
And in the southeastern hill basin, falling water levels had
been registered at all points in the past 24 hours, according to
the Flood Forecasting and Warning Center.
</P>
<P>
The situation improved in 12 districts in the three water
basins, but aggravated or remained unchanged in 16 districts.
</P>
<P>
A total of 83,726 people have been attacked by diarrhea and 51
have died from the water-borne disease since July 15, with three
more deaths and 3,326 diarrhea-affected cases reported in the last
24 hours to noon Wednesday, the Health Directorate Control Room
said.
</P>
<P>
The government has sanctioned 43,812 tons of rice and 27.5
million taka (585,000 U.S. dollars) for flood victims. Among them,
800 tons of rice and 500,000 taka (10,638 dollars) in cash were
distributed for six flood-hit districts on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Smoking Drugs Linked to Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. scientists said
long-term marijuana or cocaine smoking might increase the risk of
lung cancer, according to a study by scientists at the University
of California at Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
The study, reported in today's Journal of the National Cancer
Institute, found that smoking marijuana and crack can cause the
same precancerous changes in bronchial cells that tobacco smoking
causes well before the smoker gets cancer.
</P>
<P>
The study also found that smoking both tobacco and marijuana or
cocaine increased the risk, because those smokers were more likely
to sustain additional precancerous changes. Also these combination
smokers were more likely to have damage to their p53 gene, an
important gene in fending off cancer.
</P>
<P>
The scientists came to the conclusion after they compared
respiratory tract tissue samples from 28 healthy volunteers and 76
smokers of tobacco, marijuana, cocaine or a combination of the
drugs.

<HEADLINE> Retail Sales Sharply up in Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Official figures released on
Wednesday show that retail sales went up sharply in Britain in the
past month, diminishing hopes for an interest cut.
</P>
<P>
That is because British customers rushed out to buy bargains,
particularly new clothes and shoes, after shops slashed prices
following poor sales in June, according to market analysts.
</P>
<P>
The figures provided a key indicator for the performance of the
British economy and could dash hopes of an immediate cut in
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Retail sales volumes rose 0.9 percent from June, and were up 3
percent on an annual basis. The figures were higher than
economists' predictions of a 2.6 percent year on year rise for
July.
</P>
<P>
Six rises in interest rates over the last eighteen months has
failed to dampen shopper's enthusiasm, which has exerted pressure
on government's efforts to fight inflation.
</P>
<P>
James Barty, UK economist with Deutsche Bank, was quoted by
local media as saying: "Given there has been a rebound in these
numbers, it does suggest that consumers are still spending money.
It is far from clear that it is safe for the Bank (of England) to
cut rates."
</P>
<P>
Some economists fear that buoyant consumer spending may trigger
an overheating of certain sectors of the economy, forcing the Bank
of England's Monetary Policy Committee to at least hold the
current level of interest rates.
</P>
<P>
However a lower than expected rise of retail prices announced
on Tuesday point to a slowdown in inflationary pressures in the UK
economy and thus reduce the chance of yet another rate hike.
</P>
<P>
Jeremy Hawkins, an economist at the Bank of America, said: "UK
retail sales were much stronger than expected in July and will be
seen as disappointing by those who believe that the base rate has
topped out.
</P>
<P>
"However the 0.9 percent jump last month was solidly built upon
a 6.0 percent surge in the textile, clothing and footwear sector.
Significantly, it was this very sector that posted a record July
fall in prices. The data should not be seen as inflationary.
Rather they support the view that the consumer has become a very
price conscious animal," he said.
</P>
<P>
Business leaders have been calling for a cut in interest rates
to relieve the pressure on manufacturers who have been forced to
announce thousands of job losses over the last few months.
</P>
<P>
Lower interest rates are likely to prompt a fall in the value
of the pound, making British industry more competitive compared to
overseas rivals.

<HEADLINE> Generale Bank Opens First Branch on Chinese Mainland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Belgium's largest bank
Generale Bank opened its first branch on the Chinese mainland
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The branch, located in the south China city of Guangzhou,
adds to the bank's existing representative offices in Shanghai and
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou's close proximity to Hong Kong, where Generale Bank
has a long-established presence under the name of Belgian Bank,
was the main reason for it to be chosen as the location of the
first branch, said Guy Follebouckt, Generale Bank's Network
Manager.
</P>
<P>
"The opening of our Guangzhou branch will help us assist a
large number of Belgian Bank's customers who operate factories or
trading companies in southern China," he said.
</P>
<P>
The branch provides local and foreign companies with a full
range of commercial banking services, focusing on transactions
related to import and export.
</P>
<P>
Georges Legros, chief executive of Generale Bank, said: "The
Guangzhou branch represents a new phase in the strategic
development of the bank's operations in China and the region. We
regard China as an important market with exceptional potential for
growth."
</P>
<P>
Generale Bank has conducted commercial and consumer banking
business in Hong Kong, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Belgian
Bank, since 1935. Belgian Bank now has 30 branches throughout Hong
Kong.

<HEADLINE> Mongolian President Rejects Nominee for PM Three Times </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Mongolian President Nachagyn
Bagabandy on Wednesday rejected the nomination of Davaadorj
Ganbold as prime minister for the third time.
</P>
<P>
The rejection came Wednesday after the leadership of the ruling
union, the Mongolian National Democratic Party and Social
Democratic Party, asked the president to support the nomination
for the third time.
</P>
<P>
The president however proposed -- in a letter to the leadership
of the ruling camp -- the nomination of Dogsomin Ganbold, member
of the Great Hural (parliament) and the Mongolian National
Democratic Party, for the premiership.
</P>
<P>
Under Mongolia's law, the ruling party's parliamentary group
should discuss the nominees for prime minister with the president,
and the president then submits the nomination to the Great Hural
for approval.
</P>
<P>
The nomination of Davaadorj Ganbold, the chairman of the
Standing Committee of Economic Policy of the Great Hural, was
rejected by the president twice last week.
</P>
<P>
Ganbold was held responsible for the country's bank crisis
which led to the fall of the former cabinet in July.
</P>
<P>
The decision of the ex-government in May to merge the
state-owned Renovation Bank with the private Golomt Bank resulted
in the dismissal of Prime Minister Tsakhya Elbegdorj's government.
</P>
<P>
The president believed that Ganbold did not fulfill his duty in
accordance with the law to oversee, prevent and correct the merger.
</P>
<P>
The Great Hural last Friday decided to abolish the merger
decision by the previous government.

<HEADLINE> Local Research Urged in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe Wednesday called for the promotion and use of research by
local academics in policy making if Zimbabwe is to successfully
manage its economy.
</P>
<P>
The president said that most developing countries spend
considerable amounts of their scarce resources on foreign
technical consultancies which, although necessary at times, were
not relevant to local needs.
</P>
<P>
"This is why it is important to develop our own local research
and policy analysis capacity," said Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a three-day conference on Zimbabwe's macro-economic
policy, management and performance held in Harare, the president
urged local academics to generate relevant and "more digestible"
research which could be used in policy formulation.
</P>
<P>
"We need to enhance our local capacity in order to cope with
and successfully manage economic change as we move into the 21st
century," he said.
</P>
<P>
On its part, the Zimbabwean government was willing to use
output from academic research in policy making wherever
applicable or relevant, Mugabe said.
</P>
<P>
The conference, he said, came at an opportune time as it
enabled the government and other policy makers to draw lessons
from its experiences since the independence of this southern
African country in 1980.
</P>
<P>
"Although we have had almost eight years of economic reform,
the record shows that the results have not been as good as we had
anticipated," Mugabe said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that political independence would not be
complete and meaningful unless it is accompanied by economic
prosperity and sustainable improvement in the standard of living
of the majority.
</P>
<P>
About 200 delegates are attending the conference which would
discuss fiscal and monetary policies, exchange rate management,
the recent fall of the Zimbabwean Dollar, trade liberalization,
regional integration and economic empowerment of indigenous
people.

<HEADLINE> Romania Formulates National Security Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Romania's national security
strategy, debated and approved recently by the Country's Supreme
Defense Council, will be presented to parliament in a political
statement by President Emil Constantinescu, presidential sources
announced on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Romania's security strategy aims to integrate the country with
the international community, and develop security on a global
level.
</P>
<P>
In the document, the Romanian state considers that it has no
potential enemies in any states of the world and that Romania will
place priority on preventing, discouraging and resolving
peacefully all crises and conflicts, by improving its reputation
as an advocate of regional and European stability and security.
</P>
<P>
The principle ways of ensuring national interests are through
economic development and the modernization of Romanian society,
including full integration with European structures.
</P>
<P>
According to the document, the internal risk factors that might
affect the Romanian state's security are: the widening of major
economic-financing deficits, the corruption and other forms of
organized crime beyond a level where they might jeopardize the
functions of the fundamental institutions of the state; the
amplification of actions that could plunge national institutions
and leading structures into a generalize crisis; the proliferation
of extremism that might disrupt democratic institutions and the
constitutional order; the compromising of the ecological balance
and normal living conditions of the citizens; the lowering of
living standards to the poverty line where the health potential of
the people may be affected.
</P>
<P>
The risk elements in the international environment that might
affect Romania's security are the existence of grave political,
social and military factors and certain potential or real
conflicts on the regional plane; the expansion of
terrorist-extremist activity and international organized crime
such as drug smuggling, radioactive and strategic materials,
weaponry and ammunition; inordinate proliferation of nuclear
technology and materials, mass-destruction weapons and other
lethal unconventional means; attempts to illegally use the
Romanian territory for stocking toxic and radioactive wastes, and
other materials pernicious to the population and the environment,
as well as the existence in the borders' proximity of objectives
that pose high degrees of risks.
</P>
<P>
Under the document, the ways of acting to ensure Romania's
national security are consistent with the country's interests and
resources, the trends in the economic and political and military
processes, as well as the potential risk factors.

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Team Arrives in Nepal to Scale Mt. Lhotse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The Tibetan mountaineering
team, which plans to scale the 8,516-meter Mt. Lhotse in
September and October from the Nepalese side, arrived here
Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Tibetan team is well-known for its adventure to conquer
all the 14 peaks over 8,000 meters above sea level in the world.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years from April 1993 to May 1998, the
Tibetan team has conquered eight of the targeted mountains --
Annapurna I 8,091m.), Dhaulagiri I (8,167m.), Xixabangma (8,01
2m.), Cho Oyu 8,201m.), Gasherbrum II (8,035m.), Manaslu
(8,163m.), Nanga Parbat 8,126m.) and Kanchenjunga (Main)
(8,586m.).
</P>
<P>
They are to scale by 2002 the remaining six peaks of Lhotse
8,516m.), Chogori (8,611m.), Gasherbrum I (8,068m.), Broad Peak
8,051m.), Makalu I (8,463m.) and the world's highest peak
Qomolangma (8,848m.).
</P>
<P>
Lhotse, the world's fourth highest peak located along the
border between China and Nepal, is still to be conquered for the
first time by the mankind from the Chinese side.
</P>
<P>
Team leader Sam Druk said that his 10-member team is scheduled
to leave Kathmandu on August 25 for the base camp at an altitude
of 5,200 meters and seven of the members, who are all alpinists,
are scheduled to make attempt on the summit in mid-October.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the course of conquering the eight peaks, no
one had died or suffered from serious frostbite.
</P>
<P>
He said that Ang Tshering Sherpa from the Asian Trekking Ltd
of Nepal has donated 80,000 U.S. dollars to cover the expenditure
of the team in Nepal and that before it reaches the number one
base at an altitude of 6,200 meters.

<HEADLINE> Russian Stocks Slide Awaiting News on T-Bill Swap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The Russian stock market
continued to nosedive Wednesday as traders waited nervously for
news on the planned conversion of ruble-denominated treasury bills
into new securities.
</P>
<P>
Prices dropped 5-10 percent by noon in thin trading, the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The RTS-Interfax composite ruble index slid 3.4 percent to
24.42 by 13:00 local time (09:00 GMT), while the RTS-1-Interfax
index, which does not cover Gazprom shares, went down 7.5 percent
to 92.11 from Tuesday's close.
</P>
<P>
Market operators are set to wait for five more days for the
government's announcement on terms for redeeming treasury bills
and federal loan bonds maturing prior to the end of 1999. The
terms were originally scheduled to be made public Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Given the complexity and importance of this question, we
decided to postpone announcement of the terms for redeeming the
securities," Deputy Prime Minister Boris Fyodorov said.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the government and the Central Bank announced that
the ruble-denominated securities would be converted into new
government securities.
</P>
<P>
The new redemption procedures will apply to all treasury bills
and federal loan bonds maturing by the end of 1999, Fyodorov said.
</P>
<P>
"It is important not to make any mistakes. Whether Russia will
enter world markets in six months, a year or five years depends on
this decision," the deputy prime minister, who is in charge of
macroeconomics affairs and state debts, said.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was put off because J. P. Morgan and Deutsche
Bank, which have agreed to advise the Russian government on
restructuring the internal debt, wanted to have more time to
present their recommendations to the government, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a battered ruble against the dollar is also fueling
pressure on share prices, observers say.
</P>
<P>
The slide is likely to continue in the coming days amid light
trading as almost all traders are trying to sell, preferably for
dollars.
</P>
<P>
At 13:00 local time (09:00 GMT) on the Russian Stock System,
United Energy Systems of Russia was at 0.0635/0.064 dollar, down
11.5 percent in volume of 14.3 million shares; Lukoil was at
5.055/5.24 dollar, down 5.5 percent on 166,000 shares, and
Mosenergo was at 0.029/0.031 dollar, down 10.7 percent on 9.75
shares traded.
</P>
<P>
Gazprom shares on the Moscow Stock Exchange, which are
included on the RTS-Interfax composite index, shed 13.9 percent to
1.18 rubles in trading volume of about 4.91 million rubles,
Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the government announced earlier
Wednesday that it would not sell its 5 percent stake in Gazprom,
the oil and natural gas giant, for the time being due to the
unfavorable financial market situation.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the government is also pondering putting off a
tender for a share package of 75 percent plus one share in
Rosneft, another major oil company, Interfax quoted a government
source as saying Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> U.S. New Housing Construction Surges in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Housing construction surged
in the United States for the second straight month in July to its
fastest pace since 1987, the Commerce Department reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Builders started new housing construction at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 1,718,000 units in July, said the
department.
</P>
<P>
The unexpected robust 5.7 percent gain followed a June rise to
a revised 1.63 million units that was even sharper than the
department previously reported.
</P>
<P>
Including July, home building has now stayed above the 1.5
million unit rate for 11 straight months, a stretch unprecedented
since the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
The building heat has been fueled by new-home sales, which hit
another record high in June.
</P>
<P>
Home buyers have been plentiful with unemployment at its lowest
in decades. And interest rates on fixed-rate 30-year mortgages,
which dipped to an average 6.91 percent last week, haven't been
much better since 1993.
</P>
<P>
Housing permits, a leading indicator of future building plans,
bounced back up by 4 percent to a rate of 1.58 million units in
July after a slight 1.7 percent decline in June.
</P>
<P>
New construction of single-family homes was up 3 percent in
July, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.31 million units,
the best since 1993, while apartment building starts were up a
whopping 15 percent, to 412,000 units.
</P>
<P>
By region, housing starts in the Northeast went up 11.8 percent
to 152,000 units. In the South, they were up 6.8 percent to
813,000, and in the West up 4.3 percent to 436,000 units.
</P>
<P>
The Midwest had the most modest rise in home building, up 1.9
percent to 317,000 units.

<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The Volvo Truck Co. of Sweden
plans to set up a joint venture in east China's Shandong Province
to produce heavy-duty trucks.
</P>
<P>
Volvo and China National Heavy-Duty Truck Corp. in Shandong are
undergoing feasibility studies for a joint-venture project,
according to Yan Fangmin, deputy general manager of the Chinese
company, the country's largest of its kind.
</P>
<P>
"We expect to complete all negotiations and official approval
work within this year and begin production early next year," Yan
said.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture, at a budgeted cost of 4 billion yuan (482
million US dollars), will have a designed annual production
capacity of 20,000 heavy-duty trucks.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese company, which has manufacturing plants in several
locations in China, and the Swedish company, which has set up a
joint venture in Xi'an, the capital of northwestern Shaanxi
Province, will hold a 50-50 stake in the planned joint venture,
Yan said.
</P>
<P>
Many of the leading automobile companies in the world --
including Ford Motor Co., General Motors and Mercedes-Benz -- have
invested in China, which is believed to have great market
potential as residents become more affluent as a result of
deepening market reforms.

<HEADLINE> Expert Says Flood Situation Serious in Northeast China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The flood situation is serious
on the Songhua and Nenjiang rivers as an unusually big flood crest
is sweeping downstream toward Harbin, an expert of the State Flood
Control and Drought Relief Headquarters said here today.
</P>
<P>
By noon today, the water level at the Harbin Hydrological
Station rose to 120.66 meters, 0.61 meters higher than the
historic high.
</P>
<P>
The main streams of the Songhua and Nenjiang rivers upstream
Harbin, capital of China's northernmost Heilongjiang Province,
this year has experienced summer flooding unprecedented in the
past century.
</P>
<P>
As a result, water has washed over some sections of the
riverbanks. Dangerous situations including cave-ins have occurred
on many sections of the two rivers. More than 1,200 oil wells in
the Daqing Oil Field, China's largest, have been inundated, with
527 others closed.
</P>
<P>
The flood-prevention capacity of the dikes of the Nenjiang was
designed for a flood which usually occurs every 10 years. However,
the summer flooding this year was the worst in the last
century. And the river dikes have been soaked in water for more
than 40 days. In addition, more rains are expected in August, the
expert said.
</P>
<P>
The task of battling floods will remain difficult, he said,
calling on flood fighters to stay on high alert and spare no
effort to safeguard Harbin, a leading heavy-industrial center in
northeast China.
</P>
<P>
Stress will be placed on protecting key dikes, major cities and
the lives of local people, he said. Full preparations should be
made to ensure that nothing is going wrong, he added.

<P>
BEIJING, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Surgeons at the General Hospital
of the Armed Police have been successful in removing a large
"dumbbell-shaped" tumor from the brain of a 12-year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
The patient, Zhang Jingjing, had been suffering from headaches,
nausea, and vomiting since early last year, and later could not
move her arms or legs freely because of the pressure it was
putting on three nerve centers of the brain.
</P>
<P>
A CAT scan found that the dumbbell-shaped tumor had became so
big that it was affecting the motor center, speech center, and
sensory center of the brain, and could possibly result in death
from a cerebral hernia. Doctors removed it by using microsurgical
techniques, and the patient has recovered and left the hospital.

HANOI, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The government of Vietnam has
approved a three-year national program that will attempt to reduce
the reportedly 20 percent of poor households nation-wide to 10
percent by 2000, the Vietnam News reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese people are considered poor if per capita consumption
is below 25 kilograms of husked rice a month for those living in
urban areas, below 20 kilograms for those living in rural areas in
the plains, and below 15 kilograms for those in rural mountainous
areas.
</P>
<P>
The national program for poverty alleviation and hunger
elimination for 1998-2000 period will implement projects to help
ethnic minorities lead a less strenuous life, increase production
and improve living standards.
</P>
<P>
Initially, the program, part of Vietnam's strategy for
socio-economic development, will focus on remote, mountainous and
border areas as well as islands.
</P>
<P>
About 10 trillion Vietnamese dong (over 700 million
U.S. dollars) from the state budget and international assistance
will be invested in implementing the various projects under the
program, the Vietnam News said.

WASHINGTON, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- The Pakistani authorities have arrested two additional
suspects in the bombings of the American Embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania. The men were arrested on Monday as they were trying to
cross into Afghanistan at Torkham, in the Khyber Pass, said senior
Pakistani officials.
</P>
<P>
-- Prominent Democrats around the country, including some of
President Clinton's most loyal supporters, starkly distanced
themselves from the President Tuesday and expressed deep personal
disappointment with his behavior, as well as political anxiety
about the future.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- Independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr Tuesday summoned Monica
S. Lewinsky back to the grand jury later this week to test the
credibility of President Clinton's account of their 18-month
affair against her version, according to legal sources close to
the case.
</P>
<P>
-- Americans expressed willingness Tuesday to overlook or at
least shunt aside President Clinton's personal failings and keep
him in office for the remainder of what they now see as a
tarnished and diminished presidency.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal
</P>
<P>
-- Indonesia officials siphoned off more than 20 percent of the
money for World Bank projects, a memo by the international
development agency indicates. The memo may prove embarrassing
since bank officials have said until recently they were ignorant
of the corruption.
</P>
<P>
-- Secretary of State Albright visited the bombed Tanzania and
Kenya embassies as a Nairobi paper reported FBI agents raided a
hotel where one bomb was assembled. In Albania, U.S. troops taking
part in NATO exercises were sent to guard a temporary Tirana
embassy after a threat was received. A threat also shut the embassy
in Jordan.

<HEADLINE> China's Largest Historic Private Residence Opens to Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The Wang Family Quadrangle, a
150,000-square-meter group of residential buildings with an
history of more than 200 years in Lingshi County in north China's
Shanxi Province, opened to tourists on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The structures were built in the reign of Emperor Qianlong
(1736-1795 A.D.) during the Qing Dynasty over a period of 50 years
and at enormous expense.
</P>
<P>
The building group is located at the foot of Mianshan Mountain,
150 kilometers from Taiyuan, the capital of Shanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The Wang Family became very wealthy after several
generations of hard work, beginning as bean-curd vendors.
</P>
<P>
In this large family's prime, 42 family members served as
Qing Dynasty officials, above the provincial level.
</P>
<P>
These old buildings are divided into two parts, the
Hongmenpu section includes 28 separate buildings, each with a
courtyard and paved paths among the courtyards arranged
in the shape of the Chinese character "Wang."
</P>
<P>
Gaojiaya, the other part of the Wang Family Quadrangle, is a
traditional Siheyuan, or a courtyard, with compounds where large
courtyards opens off onto smaller ones in succession.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists say this historic building group is of great
value for research, where the wood, brick and stone carvings of
the quadrangles added color to the old buildings.

<HEADLINE> World Cup Coach Talebi Resigns from Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Iran's World Cup soccer coach
Jalal Talebi has handed over his post, the Iranian news agency
IRNA said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Talebi, appointed just three weeks before the world Cup began,
has resigned "due to family reasons," IRNA quoted an official
from Iran's soccer federation as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Iran's media and fans hailed Talebi for his handling of
the squad despite his short preparation time.
</P>
<P>
Iran lost narrowly 1-0 to Yugoslavia and 2-0 to Germany, but
claimed a 2-1 victory over the United States in the World Cup
first round matches.
</P>
<P>
Talebi, who took over after Croatian Tomislav Ivic, was Iran's
fourth coach in less than one year.
</P>
<P>
IRNA said Talebi would return to his former position as
technical advisor to the team, pointing out that he could not
coach at any level for the next few months due to "family
engagements".
</P>
<P>
Talebi was a member of Iran's national soccer team in the
early 1960s, and coached club sides in Iran, the United Arab
Emirates and Singapore as well as Indonesia's Olympic team in
1996.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Inflation Rate Unchanged in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Canada's inflation rate remained
unchanged between June and July, Statistics Canada said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The annual inflation rate was 1.0 percent in July, the same as
in June, according to the data-gathering agency.
</P>
<P>
Higher costs for university tuition, tobacco products, travel
tours, telephone services and natural gas were mainly responsible
for the rise.
</P>
<P>
But declining charges for gasoline and computer equipment, and
lower mortgage interest costs had a moderating influence on these
upward movements, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Since November 1997, Canada's annual inflation rate have ranged
between 0.7 percent and 1.1 percent.

<HEADLINE> Over Half Oil Rigs Idled in Western Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- More than half the oil and gas
rigs in Western Canada were idle last week as drilling slumped to
the lowest level in six years, a report said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Only 236 of the oil-producing region's 577 drilling rigs were
active during the past week, a 41 percent utilization rate,
according to the Canadian Association of Oilwell Drilling
Contractors.
</P>
<P>
That's a sharp drop from 429 rigs during the same week last year,
when the industry was suffering from rig and staff shortages.
</P>
<P>
The last time drilling levels were so low was in the summer of
1992, said the Financial Post newspaper.
</P>
<P>
This year, drilling activity started slipping during the spring.
It never recovered and has been stuck at the current utilization
rate for most of the summer.
</P>
<P>
Producers are cutting back on drilling because of cash flows have
been slashed by low oil prices, said an oilfield services analyst at
Peters &AMP; Co. in Calgary.
</P>
<P>
He expects the industry to drill only 11,400 wells this year,
down 30 percent from 16,500 last year.
</P>
<P>
Contractors are hoping that a strong natural gas demand from the
U.S. will help rebound drilling activities in the coming winter
drilling season.

<HEADLINE> EU Extends Humanitarian Aid to Central Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission,
executive arm of the European Union, granted humanitarian aid
worth 55.5 million ECU (61 million U.S. dollars) for the Great
Lakes region in central Africa on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The aid, to be managed by the European Community Humanitarian
Office, will enable United Nations organizations, Red Cross
agencies and non-governmental organizations to carry out aid
programs for the rest of this year.
</P>
<P>
Most of the funding is being channeled through the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the United Nations
Children's Fund, the International Committee of the Red Cross, and
the International Federation of Red Cross and Crescent Societies.
</P>
<P>
The new aid came on top of 64.195 million ECU (70.6 million
dollars) already allocated to the region earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
The countries to benefit from the European Commission aid
include the Democratic Republic of Congo, Congo, Rwanda, Burundi
and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that a total of two million people are in need
of humanitarian aid, commission officials said.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, half a million are refugees from Burundi and a
further million are Burundians displaced from their country.
</P>
<P>
Up to 800,000 people have been affected by floods caused by
freak weather conditions attributed to the El Nino phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
The European Community Humanitarian Office has contributed in
the past four years up to 593 million ECU (652.3 million dollars)
to the region.

<HEADLINE> India Voices Concern Over Taliban Gains in Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 19 (Xinhua) -- India is expressing deep
concern about Taliban gains over the Northern Alliance in
Afghanistan. The gains have suddenly pushed the Afghan frontier
closer to a host of countries including India.
</P>
<P>
The Indian Express reported Wednesday that India was in touch
with Russia and Central Asian countries over the rapid Taliban
advance in northern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
In its first reaction to the fast-developing events in
Afghanistan, an official spokesman for the Ministry of External
Affairs on Tuesday urged an end to foreign interference in
war-torn Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Military solutions, which have been attempted in the recent
past in Northern Afghanistan through the "active support,
collaboration and actual involvement of foreign forces," are not
likely to succeed or endure in resolving the Afghan conflict, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"This foreign interference must cease," he said, stopping short
of naming Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman condemned the capture of Iranian diplomats who
were present in Mazar-i Sharif when it fell to Taliban.
</P>
<P>
"Those who hold these diplomats in captivity and their foreign
mentors must ensure that no harm comes to them and that they are
released immediately," he said.

<HEADLINE> South Korean-Japanese Fishery Talks Enter Crucial Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 19 (Xinhua) -- South Korea and Japan kicked off
another round of talks Wednesday in what Seoul called a crucial
stage over settling a dispute regarding fishing rights.
</P>
<P>
"The two sides have reached a critical point," said Yun
Byung-se, a deputy director general of Asia-Pacific affairs at the
Foreign Affairs and Trade Ministry. He is heading a South Korean
delegation to the three-day negotiation.
</P>
<P>
It is the fourth time this year the two sides have met to
discuss a new fishing agreement.
</P>
<P>
Both sides hope to settle the issue ahead of South Korean
President Kim Dae-jung's Tokyo tour in October.
</P>
<P>
The official hinted that the two sides may be able to iron out
some of their differences.
</P>
<P>
"I believe these negotiations in Seoul will likely determine
the fate of the entire negotiation since both sides are entering
the new talks with a better understanding of each other's
positions than ever before," said Yun.
</P>
<P>
Relations between South Korea and Japan soured after Tokyo
unilaterally scrapped the 1965 fisheries accord.
</P>
<P>
Seoul took a retaliatory action by lifting self-imposed
restrictions on operations by South Korean fishing vessels in
waters near Japan.
</P>
<P>
South Korea later restored the ban following Japan's agreement
to conduct new negotiations over the dispute. The two nations
resumed talks in April this year.
</P>
<P>
One of the thorny problems in the talks is how to align
exclusive fishing zones of both countries in waters lying between
the two nations.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1965 fishing accord, exclusive fishing zones extended
as far as 12 miles in waters from the shores of each country.
</P>
<P>
Japan supported the 12-mile exclusive zone in the past but now
wants to expand its sea territory to keep South Korean fishing
boats away from its coastal waters, which are rich in marine
resources.

OTTAWA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- CanWest Global Communications Corp.
will become Canada's biggest private broadcaster with deal for 11
television stations, the Globe and Mail newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
CanWest announced Tuesday that it will spend 950 million Canadian
dollars (627 million U.S. dollars) to buy 11 television stations now
owned by WIC Western International Communications Ltd.
</P>
<P>
The acquisition propels CanWest ahead of rival network CTV, owned
by Baton Broadcasting Corp., making it the largest privately-owned
broadcaster in the country, when measured by revenue.
</P>
<P>
WIC, a Vancouver broadcasting company, has been the subject of a
bitter fight between rivals CanWest and Shaw Communications Inc. of
Calgary. The two companies agreed Tuesday to divvy up WIC's assets,
giving the television stations and some related assets to CanWest.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Monetary
Authority (HKMA) was awarded Wednesday "ISO 9002 Certification"
for the provision of information technology (IT) infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The award represents a recognition of HKMA's commitment to
ensure the quality of IT service, effectiveness and efficiency of
IT support, continuous improvement and achievement of defined
quality levels, said HKMA.
</P>
<P>
The certificate was awarded jointly by Hong Kong Quality
Assurance Agency (HKQAA) and British Standards Institution-Quality
Assurance (BSI-QA).
</P>
<P>
Based on available information, HKMA said it is the first
central bank or monetary authority in the region to be awarded
such a certificate on IT related service.
</P>
<P>
"The HKMA is not in the IT business, but we recognize that IT
is essential to the effective discharge of our responsibilities.
Given the importance of IT to financial markets, the performance
of IT systems can be vital to the stability of financial markets.
The recent financial turmoil has borne this out clearly," said
HKMA Chief Executive Joseph Yam.
</P>
<P>
The certification underlines the importance HKMA attaches
to the promotion of efficiency and integrity of financial systems
in Hong Kong and in turn to the maintenance of Hong Kong's
position as an international financial center, Yam noted.
</P>
<P>
The objective of obtaining the certification is to formalize
the control and monitoring of a reliable and secure computer
operations environment to support HKMA's bank supervision,
reserves management and internal communication systems.

<P>
BEIRUT, August 19 (Xinhua) -- A soldier of the United Nations
peacekeeping force was wounded by Israeli shelling in south
Lebanon Wednesday afternoon, the Orient radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The soldier was hit during Israeli bombardment when he was
passing on the road of Zibgin Hinin in the western sector of the
Israeli occupied south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli artillery troops were attacking suspected targets
of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, after one of its
soldier was killed and three others wounded by guerrillas assaults
in the morning of the day.
</P>
<P>
The nationality of the injured U.N. peacekeeper is still
unknown, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
The 4,500-strong U.N. Interim Forces in Lebanon (UNIFIL), which
consists of battalions from nine countries, was set up after the
Israeli first invasion of Lebanon in 1978.
</P>
<P>
All UNIFIL soldiers are being deployed inside or outside the
occupied zone with the aim of helping Lebanese government restore
authority over the south and confirm the Israeli withdrawal from
the country.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a 1,200-square-kilometer self-styled security
zone in south Lebanon in 1985, purportedly to protect its north
from cross-border attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Since then, about 1,500 Israeli troops and their allied
2,500-strong South Lebanon Army have been engaged in a war of
attrition with the resistance movements in and near the occupied
areas.

<HEADLINE> Global Demand For Gold Increases in Second Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The global demand for gold
increased by 50 percent in the second quarter of this year, and
will continue to grow in the remaining months of the year, the
World Gold Council (WGC) said in its latest quarterly report
"Demand Trends."
</P>
<P>
The WGC, which surveyed 25 major gold markets for the report,
said strong demand for gold out of Europe and the United States
offset weakness in Japan and other Asian markets.
</P>
<P>
Demand equated to 634.3 metric tons in the three months to
June, from 406.6 tons during the first quarter of 1998, the WGC
said.
</P>
<P>
The Asian economic crisis pushed demand down in the first
quarter, but the second quarter demand was just 9 percent lower
than the 723 tons posted in the second quarter in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Demand for gold from developed countries was up 9 percent in
the second quarter but Japan's demand slumped 21 percent.
</P>
<P>
George Stanley, WGC manager of gold market analysis, was
confident the strong recovery in gold demand in the second quarter
would continue.
</P>
<P>
He told the Australian Associated Press that conditions were
set for a recovery in demand, downplaying fears that the Russian
payments crisis could hit the gold market.
</P>
<P>
Russia was making more use of derivative products to leverage
its gold assets rather than dumping physical stock onto the
markets, the manager said.
</P>
<P>
He said fears of central bank gold selling was easing, noting
France's central bank recently endorsed holding gold reserves.
</P>
<P>
In other markets, he noted that in India, the world's biggest
gold buyer, overall demand was up 15 percent, while it jumped 19
percent for the second quarter in the United States.
</P>
<P>
"I look forward to an improvement in market sentiment," he
said, adding that he had "no doubt" that the strong recovery
demand in the second quarter would continue through the remainder
of the year.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar leapt
three-quarters of a U.S. cent higher Wednesday as rumors of
Japanese central bank intervention to support the ailing yen
intensified.
</P>
<P>
The local currency ended at 59.78 U.S. cents, well up from
59.01 here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The biggest jump in the local unit occurred in offshore trade
which dealers said was sparked by short-covering and a rise in the
yen.
</P>
<P>
"Driving the Australian dollar's rise is the yen and driving
the yen's strength is fear of intervention," said the foreign
exchange treasury manager at Colonial State Bank, Andrew Willett.
</P>
<P>
"Over the last 24 hours those rumors have really hotted up.
</P>
<P>
"There were some rumors that Asian central banks were selling
U.S. Treasuries last night to fund an intervention effort in the
foreign exchange market."
</P>
<P>
Eisuke Sakakibara, the ministry of finance's vice finance
minister for international affairs, said "the opportunity for
yen-supportive intervention is getting near."
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar finished at 86.26 yen, up from 85.87
previously.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Australian dollar was buying 1.0766 German marks
from 1.0591.

BEIJING, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Microsoft, the world's largest
software provider, launched the Microsoft Commercial Internet
System (MCIS) 2.0 here today to facilitate Internet commercial
service.
</P>
<P>
The new software is a group of server applications designed to
make it easier for Internet Commercial Service Providers (CSP) to
deploy virtual networking and surfing, administrate Internet,
Intranet and commercial Websites, and provide telecommunications
service such as e-mail, news releasing and NetMeeting.
</P>
<P>
The launching of MCIS 2.0 in China came about two weeks earlier
than in the United States, as scheduled by Microsoft headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Sheila Shang, manager of the Corporate Marketing Department of
Microsoft (China) Co., Ltd., said it is unusual for new software
to become available earlier outside of the United States.
</P>
<P>
"The exception this time was triggered by the favorable market
opportunity created by the rapid development of China's
information industry and the exponential growth of networking in
the country." She said.
</P>
<P>
According to Microsoft engineers, MCIS runs on the Intel and
Digital Alpha microprocessors, and is therefore compatible with
various types of hardware.
</P>
<P>
The MCIS 2.0 is an upgraded version of MCIS 1.0, which has many
users around the world including the 169 multi-media networks in
central China's Hubei Province and in Hangzhou in east China's
Zhejiang Province.

flooding in decades has reached a crucial moment, with surging
flood water inundating China's largest oilfield in the northeast
and the seventh flood crest forming on the Yangtze River in the
south.
</P>
<P>
Millions of weary civilians and soldiers continue to battle
flooding and additional military units are being deployed to
assist in the effort.
</P>
<P>
More than 130,000 Chinese soldiers and members of armed police
units have joined some two million militiamen in the unrelenting
strenuous battle carried out over the past two months.
</P>
<P>
"The flood control effort along the Yangtze River has led to
the largest military deployment since the War of Liberation
(1945-1949)", according to Zhang Wannian, vice-chairman of the
Central Military Commission.
</P>
<P>
Military support has not only included elite air, infantry and
naval forces, but also the use of strategic reserve materials.
</P>
<P>
The long list of heroes who have sacrificed their lives in the
arduous battle include Gao Jiancheng, an air force officer who
died while attempting to save the life of a comrade.
</P>
<P>
Gao's septuagenarian mother, a resident of Hunan Province,
learned of her son's death and decided to allow her three
remaining sons and two grandsons to join the effort.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese nation is focused on heavy flooding along the
Yangtze and Nenjiang rivers which has claimed more than 2,000
lives and resulted in financial losses of close to 200 billion
yuan (24.1 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin personally visited the city of Wuhan on
August 13 as the fifth flood crest was rapidly approaching the
major industrial city located in the middle reaches of the Yangtze
and appealed for the entire nation to intensify flood control
efforts. In addition, Premier Zhu Rongji travelled to Jiujiang,
another major city along the Yangtze, to assess damage resulting
from a breach in a strategic levee.

<P>
The Ministry of Finance has allocated flood relief funds
totalling 2.2 billion yuan (265 million US dollars) and the State
Development Planning Commission has announced plans to increase
funding for water conservancy projects by 17 billion yuan (2.05
billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
A nationwide donation solicitation campaign is in place an
August 16 charity drive televised by China Central Television
(CCTV) raised cash an in kind donations of over 600 million yuan
(72.3 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
A recent survey shows that 98 percent of citizens of Beijing
are closely following the flood situation and 92 percent have
donated to the flood control effort.
</P>
<P>
Relief efforts continue to expand and experts are engaged in
serious discussions concerning the apparent lack of success in the
50-year effort to harness the Yangtze and various other rivers.
</P>
<P>
They point to increasingly serious soil erosion and
deteriorating environmental conditions as the main factors
hindering flood control efforts. Statistics show that reclamation
projects in the lower and middle of the Yangtze have reduced the
coverage of flood areas by as much as 33 percent. They also point
out that the El Nino phenomena has accelerated the already dire
situation.
</P>
<P>
The experts have noted that massive government investments to
create a relatively strong flood control system have greatly
diminished the loss of lives and volume of destruction resulting
from summer flooding.
</P>
<P>
Primary levees stretching more than 3,500 km, secondary levees
covering 30,000 km and close to 50,000 reservoirs have been
constructed along the Yangtze over the past four decades.

<HEADLINE> S.Korea's Top Chaebols Breach Cross-Payment Guarantee Act </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-two subsidiaries of South
Korea's top-30 family-own conglomerates, or chaebols, have violated
a government-set cross-payment guarantee act, the Fair Trade
Commission said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
As of March 31 this year, 22 firms affiliated with the top-30
chaebols extended debt guarantees to their sister companies in excess
of 100 percent of their net worth, said a spokesman of the commission.
</P>
<P>
The amount of unlawful debt guarantees by the 22 firms was
estimated up to 1.7 trillion won (1.3 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Under a fair trade act, inter-subsidiary debt guarantees by a
company belonging to the top-30 chaebols are banned from exceeding 100
percent of their capital.
</P>
<P>
"Judging from the amount of illicit debt guarantees, the Fair
Trade Commission will be able to impose about 40 billion to 50
billion won in fines on the concerned firms," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the fine imposition will be flexible, as many of the
violating firms and groups are now mired in various managerial
troubles, with some of them are bankrupt or near-insolvent, said
the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Since last month, the commission has been in probes into debt
guarantees extended by 780 affiliates of the 30 largest business
groups.
</P>
<P>
Under a new law aimed to curb reckless expansion of the
conglomerates through bank loans, their subsidiaries are obliged
to completely dispose their debt guarantees to sister firms by the
year 2000.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Not to Reimpose Death Penalty: Mandela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 19 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela said Wednesday that his country had no intention
to reimpose death penalty.
</P>
<P>
Addressing "Investment against Crime Seminar" sponsored by the
overseas Chinese community in Midrand, a city between
Johannesburg and Pretoria, Mandela said the abolition of capital
punishment had become a law in South Africa since the first
non-racial elections in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Noting that capital punishment was a cruel tool of the
apartheid regime to oppress the black people, Mandela said the
South African government led by the African National Congress
would never follow example of the apartheid regime that imposed
death penalty against the black and colored people.
</P>
<P>
Mandela made the remarks in response to calls by the Chinese
community that South Africa should restore capital punishment so
that the increasing crime rate could be curbed effectively.
</P>
<P>
About 200 overseas Chinese and their leaders attended the
seminar.
</P>
<P>
The South African social security has been in poor condition
for years. Many people, including overseas Chinese in the
country, have become victims of robbery, murder, rape and other
assaults.
</P>
<P>
An 18-month-old Chinese boy, name Danny Zhong, was shot dead
while his father was wounded on June 26 in their grocery store at
the downtown street in Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
Local Chinese community held a massive demonstration against
the murder soon after the killing of the innocent child.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators at the time presented a petition to Mandela,
appealing to him and his cabinet for punishing the murderers.
</P>
<P>
Reiterating his deep sorrow for the dead, Mandela vowed to
work with his government and the peoples in South Africa "to
prevent such outrages from occurring again."

<HEADLINE> UK, Ireland to Go on Hunting for Omagh Bombers Despite Ceasefire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Despite a ceasefire announced by
the Real IRA which planted the Omagh bomb, Britain and the Republic
of Ireland would still hunt down the bombers, a British government
spokesman said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Prime Ministers Tony Blair talked over telephone with his Irish
counterpart Bertie Ahern for 15 minutes and both agreed the
ceasefire would make "no difference whatsoever" to their plans to
catch those responsible for the bomb in Omagh which killed 28
people and wounded 220, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam also welcomed the
ceasefire by the terror group, but added "the pain and grief do not
go away and I think it is a little late."
</P>
<P>
The Real IRA, a splinter group of the Irish Republican Army,
announced a ceasefire early Wednesday, saying the decision was a
direct result of the Omagh tragedy and the appeals of Prime
Minister Ahern.
</P>
<P>
Ahern said on Tuesday all the paramilitary groups must declare
ceasefire within 24 hours or face tough crackdown by the
government.
</P>
<P>
The Real IRA, which opposes the Northern Ireland peace
agreement, Tuesday claimed responsibility for Saturday's bombing
in Omagh, which left 28 dead and 220 wounded. But it insisted it
had not intended to kill civilians and offered an apology to the
victims.
</P>
<P>
Blair, on holiday with his family in France, also spoke by
telephone to David Trimble, Northern Ireland's first
minister-designate, and to Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams about the
Omagh incident.

GUANGZHOU, August 19 (Xinhua) -- This capital of south China's
Guangdong Province, one of the country's economic powerhouses, has
intensified its effort to meet this year's growth target.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou's gross domestic product grew by 11.9 percent on a
yearly basis in the first half of this year. The growth rate,
though higher than the provincial and national averages during the
same period, is lower than the official target of 13 percent for
all of 1998.
</P>
<P>
"Greater efforts have to be made to realize this year's
economic growth target," a municipal official said.
</P>
<P>
One of the latest efforts to spur economic growth is the
unveiling of a set of measures to boost exports, such as
increasing financial support for export enterprises, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
To ensure meeting its industrial growth target, for example,
Guangzhou has attached greater importance to technical renovations
in 116 major projects.
</P>

Efforts have also been increased to improve sales networks and
develop new and hi-tech industries.

BEIJING, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Flood-relief donations sent to
the Ministry of Civil Affairs and its sub-departments across the
country have gone beyond one billion yuan (120 million
U.S. dollars), officials in charge of the relief work said here
today.
</P>
<P>
The Civil Affairs Ministry, which opened a donation hotline on
August 10, has to date received 313 million yuan in domestic and
foreign donations, according to a ministry spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Donations directly sent to civil affairs departments nationwide
totalled more than 712 million yuan, the spokesman said.
</P>

The largest donation the Civil Affairs Ministry received today
came from the employees of various departments under the Communist
Party of China's Central Committee and the Chinese Central
Government, who contributed more than 95 million yuan in cash.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that it had allocated 90 million yuan in
donated funds and donated materials worth more than 83 million
yuan to the flood-stricken areas in Hubei, Jiangxi, Heilongjiang
and other provinces.

<HEADLINE> S.Korea Ranks Second Lowest in Attracting Foreign Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 19 (Xinhua) -- South Korea ranked second lowest in
the world in terms of attracting investment, the Bank of Korea
(BOK) said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The central banks said the averaged ratio of foreign direct
investment stood at 0.9 percent of the gross fixed capital
formation in South Korea between 1992-1997, which is only next to
Japan's 0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
In attracting foreign investments, Singapore ranked first with 25.4
percent, followed by Malaysia with 18.1 percent, China 13 percent,
Mexico 11.9 percent, Britain 11.6 percent, Indonesia 4.6 percent and
the United States 4.4 percent, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
These figures indicate that South Korea has fallen far behind its
rival trading partners and advanced nations in terms of its capacity
to attract foreign investment, said a spokesman of the bank.
</P>
<P>
South Korea also marked a mere 0.3 percent in the ratio of
foreign direct investment over gross domestic product (GDP), much
lower than Singapore's 8.8 percent, Malaysia's 6.9 percent,
China's 4.6 percent, and Mexico's 2.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
South Korea is still heavily dependent on direct borrowing of
foreign funds, rather than the introduction of direct foreign
investment, which can promote the transfer of advanced foreign
technology to the country, added the spokesman.

Banks at all levels will make settlements independently with
the grain supply or construction departments in any purchase of
food or building materials for the flood victims, he said.
</P>

The vice minister also said all relief funds and materials,
including public donations, are under the protection of the law,
and that any units or individuals attempting to embezzle or misuse
the funds and materials would be severely punished.
</P>
<P>
He also urged civil affairs departments across China to

"The reception and distribution of the relief funds and
materials must be publicized in a timely manner," he said, adding
that the Villagers' Committee, village leadership in China, has

<HEADLINE> BHP Copper Output Grows in June, July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The resumption of normal
production at Ok Tedi in Papua New Guinea has contributed to
higher copper production for BHP Co. Ltd., Australia's biggest
miner, in June and July this year.
</P>
<P>
BHP's copper concentrate production for the two months rose 23
percent to 125,900 tons, with July production up 28 percent to
67,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The increase followed higher mill availability and throughput
at both its Escondida, Chile, and Tintaya, Peru, operations and
the return to normal production at Ok Tedi.
</P>
<P>
Ok Tedi, one of the major copper mines in the world, was shut
down in August last year after lack of rain rendered its main
transport route, the Fly River, unnavigable and made mining
impossible. This meant BHP had been unable to make shipments from
the mine.
</P>
<P>
BHP's oil and condensate production for the two months to the
end of July 1998 fell 1 percent to 12.293 million barrels.
</P>
<P>
BHP's gas production was down 4 percent in the two months to
July to 44 billion cubic feet. In July, gas production was 23.3
billion cubic feet, down 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The total coal production for BHP for July fell to 3.24 million
tons from 3.33 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The company's raw steel production for June and July was 1.44
million tons, 3 percent higher, while production in July fell 4
percent to 711,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Its iron ore production in Western Australia state, Australia's
leading iron ore producing region, was 6 percent higher at 9.34
million tons.
</P>
<P>
Silver production from BHP's Cannington mine in Queensland
state, Australia, was 1.68 million ounces in July and 2.82 million
ounces in the two months to July.
</P>
<P>
Platinum output from the Hartley Platinum mine in Zimbabwe was
1,881 ounces in July and 3,341 ounces in June and July.

<HEADLINE> Epidemic Prevention Needs Enhancement in Flooded Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The Red Cross Society of China
(RCSC) has urged its local branches to enhance efforts to prevent
any possible outbreaks of disease in the flooded areas.
</P>
<P>
"Many factors are likely causes of epidemics, such as
environmental pollution, continuous high temperatures, unsanitary
living conditions, and the inadequate immunity of residents and
soldiers fighting the floods," the RCSC said in an urgent circular
issued today.
</P>
<P>
Chemicals for water purification and sterilization,
antibiotics, and medicines against gastrointestinal and skin
diseases are still urgently needed in the flooded areas,
the RCSC said.
</P>
<P>
The society has received domestic and overseas donations worth
240 million yuan (29 million U.S. dollars) so far, 180 million yuan
of which has been allocated to areas severely devastated by
floods in central, east and northeast China.
</P>
<P>
All Chinese embassies and consulates have been informed of the
bank account number of the RCSC by the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs so they may handle overseas donations.

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Both imports and exports in Macao
declined in the first half of this year, the latest statistics
show.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the Macao Census and Statistics Department
on Wednesday indicated that exports in the first six months were
7.5 billion patacas (about 937.5 million U.S. dollars), down 3.5
percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Imports in the period topped 7.7 billion patacas (about 962.5
million dollars), down 8.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The drop in foreign trade was believed to be a result of the
financial storms in Asia, plus an economic slowdown over the past
few years.
</P>
<P>
Textile goods and garments remained the leading export items of
Macao, accounting for 82.7 percent of all exported goods. Most of
the exports were shipped to the United States and the European
Union.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, most of the imports came from the Asian Pacific
region, including China's mainland and Hong Kong, which supplied
54.7 percent of the goods, and the United States.

<HEADLINE> '98 Food Exposition Opens in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 19 (Xinhua) -- '98 Food Exposition, Asia's
leading food and beverages promotion event, opened here at the
Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
A total of 135 local exhibitors, together with 44 companies
from the Chinese inland areas, Japan, the Republic of Korea,
Thailand and the United States are participating in the
exposition.
</P>
<P>
A wide selection of traditional and regional delicacies
including baby food, bakery products, beers, biscuits, cakes,
canned food, health and natural food, kitchen utensils and
vegetables and wine are in display.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the event, Victor K Fung,
chairman of the Trade Development Council, said the fair was a
must-go summer event for people from all walks of life.
</P>
<P>
He said that the exposition would play a more important role
during such tough times than any time before to boost the food
business.
</P>
<P>
"A fair like this helps companies boost their brand
recognition, develop and expand their trade contacts, and meet the
maximum number of buyers, vendors, and retail customers, in an
efficient, business-like and cost-effective setting," he said.
</P>
<P>
Last year Hong Kong's import volume of food and beverages was
61.5 billion HK dollars (about 7.88 billion U.S. dollars), an
increase of six percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
HK's exports of processed food products and beverages also
remained strong -- at almost 27 billion HK dollars (about 3.46
billion U.S. dollars) last year, showing that Hong Kong has
established itself as a source and distribution center of food
products throughout Asia.

<P>
MACAO, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Visitors to Macao in tour groups
in the first half of 1998 dropped 29.6 percent from the same
period last year, the latest statistics show.
</P>
<P>
The Macao Census and Statistics Department revealed in a
release on Wednesday that the total arrivals of visitors in tour
groups added up to only 428,368 between January and June this
year.
</P>
<P>
A leading economic sector in Macao, tourism suffered a loss in
the wake of the Asian financial storms.
</P>
<P>
Macao's currency, the pataca, has not been devalued as it is
pegged to the Hong Kong dollar and thus indirectly pegged with the
U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Rising crime rates in the first half of 1998 also aggravated
the situation, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
But, the number of Macao residents traveling outside increased
11.8 percent in the first six months. Their most favored
destinations included China's mainland, Thailand and Europe.

<HEADLINE> China Offers World's Largest Hydro-Electric Power Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANZHIHUA (Sichuan), August 19 (Xinhua) -- Ambitious efforts to
solve energy shortages and control flooding have transformed China
into the world's largest hydro-power market.
</P>
<P>
China surpassed the United States in terms of total capacity
of hydro-electric power plants, both operational facilities and plants
under construction, by the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 annual report carried in the U.S. magazine "World
Atlas and Industry Guide" ranked China as the world's leading
"Hydropower Kingdom".
</P>
<P>
Chinese experts point out that flood control and power
generation are the two major motivations behind the construction
boom.
</P>
<P>
For example, the nation's three largest projects -- the Three
Gorges Project and Xiaolangdi Water Conservation Project still
under construction on the Yangtze and Yellow rivers, and the
partially completed Ertan Hydro-Electric Power Station -- have
extensive flood control and power generating capacities.
</P>
<P>
Per-Kristian Edvardsen, director of the Norwegian Ertan Project
Advisory Group, said recently that more power plants would have
reduced the intensity of this flooding along the Yangtze. "China's
massive hydropower offer vast market potential," according to
Edvardsen.
</P>
<P>
E.E. Hershberger, a representative from US-based Harza Co.,
pointed out that the development of hydropower, a clean normally
pollution-free energy resource, will help China overcome
contradictions associated with economic growth and environmental
protection.
</P>
<P>
"An increasing number of multinational companies are exhibiting
great interest in investing in China's hydropower sector,"
according to Hershberger.
</P>
<P>
Gabriele Ferrara, site manager for an Italian joint venture
working on the Ertan Project, said China is free of problems
related to energy saturation.
</P>
<P>
"We must resist the temptation to focus on power consumption in
Beijing and Shanghai. China is a vast country with an enormous
demand for energy in rural areas," according to Ferrara.
</P>
<P>
China has tapped a mere five percent of estimated hydropower
resources totaling 600 million kilowatts.
</P>
<P>
The monthly average of 100 to 200 kwh power consumption for one
urban family remains far below levels in developed countries.
</P>
<P>
Europe and North America have fully exploited hydropower
resources, while economic factors have prevented Russia and
countries in South America and Africa from fully developing
related resources.
</P>
<P>
Edvardsen expressed the belief that China will retain its
status as the world's largest hydropower market, and disclosed
that his company plans to increase investment in the country.
</P>
<P>
China has accepted international bids and hired foreign
experts for hydropower projects since the early 1980s..
</P>
<P>
The Ertan Project has attracted World Bank loans and the
services of over 600 technicians and experts from 40-odd
countries.

<HEADLINE> China to Check on Burdens on Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 19 (Xinhua) -- China will make a study of
farmers' problems in the second half of this year to help protect
their interests and preserve their interest in farming.
</P>
<P>
The Agriculture, Supervision, and Finance ministries, the State
Development Planning Commission, and the State Council Legislative
Affairs Office will start the work in December, to give farmers a
say in the economy, according to a Ministry of Agriculture
official.
</P>
<P>
Chinese farmers complain the most about their burdens, the
official said. In addition to taxes, they have to pay fees for
village work. Taxes and fees eat up some 10 percent of farmers'
annual income, and in some areas, in central and northeastern
parts of the country, the figure is sometimes above 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The official says burden is made worse by unqualified local
officials and their eagerness to develop the local economy with
farmers' money.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, Chinese farmers had a slow
increase in incomes, but the burden kept increasing. In the
January to June period, per capita income of farmers was 977 yuan,
similar to 1997's.
</P>
<P>
Agronomists say that, because of falling farm product prices,
the slow growth of township enterprises, and the serious flooding
on the Yangtze and Nenjiang rivers, the goal of a 5 percent
increase in farmers' incomes will be difficult to reach.

<P>
Other people speaking in favour of higher denominated Naira
notes pointed out that rather than fuelling inflation as being
expressed in some quarters of the country, the inflationary
economy has necessitated having Naira in higher denomination.
</P>
<P>
A study released at the forum noted that the low denomination
of Naira costs the CBN a whopping 34 billion Naira (about 400
million U.S. Dollars) every year to keep the local currency in
circulation.
</P>
<P>
The study carried out by the Lagos Business School noted that
the Central Bank collected a total of one billion Naira (about
11.8 million Dollars) from commercial banks in the country as
charges for unsorted notes.
</P>
<P>
It also revealed that all banks in the West African country
would require about 500 million Naira (about 5.9 million Dollars)
annually to arrange their own sorting either individually or
jointly.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, with 5.4 billion pieces of Naira notes in
circulation, the replacement cost which is at the rate of 50
percent of all notes per year is equal to 11.34 billion Naira
(about 133 million Dollars).
</P>
<P>
The January 1, 1973 structure of Naira, it said, provides a
very good benchmark as to the way forward, stressing that the 50
Kobo (100 Kobo equal to one Naira) note of 1973 was worth a lot
more than the 50 Naira note of today when compared with the U.S.
Dollar.
</P>
<P>
So, the study recommended that the introduction of higher
denomination of the local currency would bring the Naira notes
back to reasonable levels of face value.
</P>
<P>
Baffa told the forum that one way the Naira notes in the
country can be made safe from defacing was by increasing their
denomination to add more value to them.
</P>
<P>
He argued that the defacing of the 10 Naira and 20 Naira notes
by market women is due to the fact that the value attached to
those notes has depreciated.
</P>
<P>
The current exchange rate is about 85 Naira to one Dollar and
the highest value of the local currency in circulation is 50
Naira.

<HEADLINE> Real IRA Declares Ceasefire After Omagh Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LONDON, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The Real IRA, which has declared
responsibility for the Omagh bombing, announced Wednesday that
it was suspending military operations.
</P>
<P>
In a coded statement to the Belfast-based Irish News, the
terror group said: "As a direct result of the Omagh tragedy and
appeals by Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern and others, we are
currently embarking on a process of consultation about our future
direction. In the meantime all military operations have been
suspended from midnight."
</P>
<P>
The Real IRA, a splinter group of the Irish Republican Army,
on Tuesday claimed responsibility for Saturday's bombing in Omagh
in which 28 people were killed and 220 wounded, the worst atrocity
in 30 years in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Ahern said late Tuesday that all paramilitary groups must
declare a ceasefire within 24 hours or face the wrath of his
government.
</P>
<P>
After the bombing, the Real IRA said it had not intended to
kill civilians and offered an apology to the victims. But the
apology was dismissed by the British government.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Tea Export Earnings Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh earned over 2.03
billion taka (about 43.2 million U.S. dollars) from its tea export
in the July 1997-June 1998 fiscal year, 55 percent more than the
previous fiscal year, an English daily reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The rise in tea export earnings was attributed to the record
high price in the international tea market, the Daily Star
newspaper quoted officials of the Bangladesh Tea Board as saying.
</P>
<P>
In the 1997-98 fiscal year ending June 30, the average export
price was recorded at 83.1 taka (about 1.77 dollars) per kilogram,
up from 51.65 taka (about 1.1 dollars) per kilogram a year ago.
</P>
<P>
However, the officials pointed out that the tea export volume
in the fiscal year was 24.45 million kilograms, 1.04 million
kilograms less than the previous fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The fall in export volume was caused by abnormal price hike in
tea markets in the country due to global shortfall in production.
</P>
<P>
"Excess tea price forced the foreign buyers to reduce their
import of tea from Bangladesh," the officials stated.
</P>
<P>
Tea, second most important cash crop after jute, is produced by
158 gardens in the country and most of them are in Sylhet
District, 208 kilometers northeast of Dhaka.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Dip on Singapore Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Share Prices closed lower on
Singapore Stock Market Wednesday, reversing a rise in the
mid-session.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Times Industrial Index (STII) dipped by
4.58 points to close at 923.04.
</P>
<P>
The total turnover surged to 403.1 million shares valued at
269.2 million Singapore dollars (about 153.83 million U.S.
dollars). Advances outstripped declines by 268 to 54 while 267
counters remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
MBF Cap remained the most active stock of the day as it closed
on a turnover of 60.97 million units. It was followed by M Res
that had 35.09 million stocks traded. RHB Cap w99 was next with
18.22 million counters changing hands.
</P>
<P>
NBT was the top gainer of the day as it gained 46.5 cents to

by 10.5 cents to end at 0.18 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
Share prices ended the morning session higher with blue chips
leading gainers after days of decline.
</P>
<P>
Brokers said the advance was a technical rebound contributed by
a number of positive factors such as the overnight rally on Wall
Street, firmer regional currencies and stronger regional stocks.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said Wednesday's STII fall was caused by weak interim
results of DBS Land.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the Stock Exchange of Singapore has
announced that the current STII will undergo a revamp and a new
Straits Times Index (STI) will be launched on August 31 to replace
STII. Unlike its predecessor which comprises only industrial
stocks and is price-weighted, the new STI will be value-weighted
and will include non-industrial stocks such as banking, property
and services.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Envoy Leaves Iraq Empty-Handed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 19 (Xinhua) -- United Nations envoy Prakash
Shah left Baghdad Wednesday morning, failing to convince the Iraqi
government to resume cooperation with the U.N. on weapons
inspections.
</P>
<P>
But before his departure, Shah said "I will not say it (the
deadlock) is a crisis. I still think that a lot of discussions,
negotiations and bilateral talks can take place."
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that he hoped a solution could be found to
allow resumption of arms inspections.
</P>
<P>
"I think and I hope that the Security Council and Iraq would be
able to work this out... If the Council wishes further
discussions, I will be prepared," said Shah.
</P>
<P>
Shah, the special envoy to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
will brief Annan and the Security Council Thursday on his talks
with Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz.
</P>
<P>
Shah's departure came a day after he announced he had failed to
negotiate a resumption of of cooperation after two meetings with
Aziz.
</P>
<P>
Iraq announced on August 5 it suspended cooperation with the
U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) and the International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA), accusing that UNSCOM is pro-U.S. and
attempting to prolong the sanctions, which were imposed on Iraq
after its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions will remain in place until UNSCOM certifies that
Iraq has eliminated all banned weapons according to relevant
U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Members of the IAEA and UNSCOM have been conducting arms
inspections, on and off, in Iraq since the 1991 Gulf War, set off
by its invasion of Kuwait, to ensure it to get rid of all weapons
of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Annan and the Security Council, terming Baghdad's move as
unacceptable, said the decision contravened relevant
U.N. resolutions and the Memorandum of Understanding on U.N. arms
inspections.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum, which was signed by Annan and Aziz in February,
averted a possible U.S. and British military strike caused by
Iraq's refusal to allow weapons inspectors access to presidential
palaces.
</P>
<P>
Shah arrived in Baghdad last Thursday with a message from Annan
urging Iraq to resume cooperation with the U.N..

<P>
TOKYO, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices rose sharply for the
second straight day in Tokyo Wednesday as a firmer yen and higher
stock prices in overseas markets encouraged buying across the board.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First

The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, surged 16.99 points or 1.46 percent to 1,183.71.

Turnover on the major section went up to an estimated 380 million
shares from Tuesday's 324.76 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Nippon Steel was the day's most heavily traded issue.
</P>
<P>
Banking issues led the market as they filled six of the top 10

</P>
<P>
But some traders were skeptical about the rise in banking shares,
calling the rebound "a pure technicality."
</P>

Meanwhile, a second straight rebound in New York stocks overnight

States and other markets.

Of the 1,335 issues listed on the First Section, gainers
outnumbered losers 858 to 263, with 147 issues ending unchanged.

<P>
-- The public opinion in the United States well received the
confession by President Bill Clinton on his relationship with Monica
Lewinsky, but Clinton himself is now greatly weakened. The
independent prosecutor Ken Starr will continue his inquiry on other
sexual scandals involving the president and the worse is expected to
come for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
-- Arthur Schlesinger, the advisor of President John Kennedy and
an expert on U.S. presidency, said in an interview with Liberation

</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Being the first U.S. president forced to testify in a criminal
inquiry concerning him, Bill Clinton publicly admitted Monday
evening having an inappropriate relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
The Americans seem to wish to turn a page. Although 52 percent of

do not want him to be impeached.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Allow Return of Marcos' Crony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The Presidential Palace said here
Wednesday that it favors the return to the country of ailing
former General Fabian Ver, a crony of the late President Ferdinand
Marcos, but warned that he must face the legal consequences.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot prohibit the return of a Filipino to his country,
especially, as far as I know, Gen. Ver has been suffering from
grave ailment," Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said.
</P>
<P>
Zamora said he believes that Ver, a key military figure during
the Marcos administration, does not pose any more threat to
national security, noting that Ver has been out of the service for
the last 12 years.
</P>
<P>
Former President Corazon Aquino had barred the return of Ver
and his sons on the grounds that they pose a threat to national
security.
</P>
<P>
Her successor Fidel Ramos allowed Ver's return and approved the
issuance of passports to Ver's wife, daughter and granddaughter,
but also warned that Ver has to face charges against him.
</P>
<P>
Zamora issued a similar warning to Ver, saying he must be ready
to face the legal consequences of his return.
</P>
<P>
"I am sure when he comes back he realizes that there are legal
consequences. He can still be sued by those who consider
themselves as victims of the time of (former) President Marcos,"
Zamora said.
</P>
<P>
Zamora said the government will have to first scrutinize any
condition or request Ver may raise to allow his homecoming.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado also said he
was in favor of Ver's return to the Philippines.

<HEADLINE> Silicon Valley Companies Team up on Unified Messaging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Two companies Sun
Microsystems and Lucent Technologies in Silicon Valley have joined
forces in an alliance to develop unified messaging systems that
combine electronic mail, phone and fax communications.
</P>
<P>
The two companies said on Monday that the systems would let
users be able to send and receive e-mail, faxes and phone messages
through a personal computer or a telephone.
</P>
<P>
The technology, which the companies hope to deliver early in
1999, will be marketed to telephone companies and Internet service
providers, who will in turn use it to provide services for their
own customers.
</P>
<P>
Sun and Lucent said that their systems will be the first to
meet the need of telephone and Internet companies which handle
millions of calls and messages each day.
</P>
<P>
Sun will provide its server computers, e-mail technology and
software technology to run the systems which store and control the
unified mailboxes. While Lucent will provide voice mail technology
and relevant software which can translate text into voice.
</P>
<P>
Phone users would be able to dial up a mailbox to retrieve
voice message, e-mails and faxes and give responses by recording a
voice message that would be played on a recipient's PC via
audio. A PC user would also have the access to all these kinds of
information.
</P>
<P>
The technology could simplify the procedure of connection. For
most traveling professionals, staying in touch becomes a chore and
they have to carry a set of communicating gadgets from cell phones
and pagers to personal organizers and personal computers.
</P>
<P>
But experts say that for such a system to be viable on a large
scale, the price should be about 20 U.S. dollars a month. And the
companies are also facing the challenge to make the technology
simple and give users tools to sort through messages and
information from different sources.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Soldier Killed in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 19 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli soldier was killed
and three others wounded during gun battles with Lebanese
guerrillas in south Lebanon Wednesday, the Orient radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The fighting broke out Wednesday morning when fighters of the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, launched attack on the
Israeli post at Soujod in the eastern sector of the Israeli
occupied zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In response, Israeli warplanes accompanied by artillery
bombardment fired a number of air-to-surface missiles onto
suspected Hezbollah targets in the Iqlim Toufah area facing the
occupied zone.
</P>
<P>
There is no immediate report of Hezbollah casualties.
</P>
<P>
But the Israeli shelling has caused heavy damages to local
civilians' houses and cars, the radio added.
</P>
<P>
The fresh casualties brought to 10 the number of Israeli
soldiers killed in south Lebanon so far this year. Twenty-five
Lebanese guerrillas were killed over the same period.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a 1,200-square-kilometer security zone in
south Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north
from cross-border attack by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanese resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been fighting against the Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
The heavy losses the Israeli occupying forces suffered have
sparked question in Israel about the wisdom of maintaining troops
in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In April this year, the Israeli cabinet endorsed the
20-year-old United Nations Resolution 425 but conditioned the
implementation on Beirut's guarantees for Israel's northern
security.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon flatly rejected the offer and asked Israel to comply
with the resolution without any conditions.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Stock Index to Undergo Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Singapore stock dealers and
players will say good-by to the 30-year-old market barometer
Straits Times Industrials Index (STII) as a revamped Straits Times
Index (STI) will take its place on August 31.
</P>
<P>
The Stock Exchange of Singapore (SES) announced Tuesday the
long-awaited regrouping of listed companies, which will take place
on August 31, according to local newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Unlike its predecessor which comprises only industrial stocks
and is price-weighted, the new STI will be value-weighted and will
include non-industrial stocks such as banking, property and
services.
</P>
<P>
The number and names of STI component stocks will be disclosed
on August 28 and the launch date for the new STI is timed to
coincide with the SES reclassification of stocks.
</P>
<P>
The 370 counters -- including those on Sesdaq -- will be placed
in 12 industry sectors and 29 sub-sectors instead of the present
six broad categories based on the latest data on their turnover
contributors.
</P>
<P>
The 12 industry sectors are multi-industry, manufacturing,
electricity/gas/water, construction, commerce,
transport/storage/communications, services, agriculture,
mining/quarrying, finance, hotels/restaurants and properties.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Press Holdings which compiles the index said, "To
ensure continuity with the STII, which has served as the market
benchmark for more that three decades, the new STI's commencing
base will be the STII's closing value on August 28."
</P>
<P>
There is difference between a price-weighted index and a
value-weighted index.
</P>
<P>
In computing a priced-weighted index, such as the STII, the
component stocks are weighted by their price. Higher-priced stocks
therefore have a greater percentage impact on the index than
lower-priced stocks. Examples of price-weighted indices are the
Dow Jones Industrial Average and Japan's Nikkei 225 Index.
</P>
<P>
A value-weighted index is calculated by weighting the component
stocks by their market value, which is the share price multiplied
by the number of outstanding shares. The impact of a component
stock is proportional to its market capitalization and the index
is not affected by capital changes such as bonus issues and stock
splits. Value-weighted indices include the S &AMP; P 500 Index, the
NYSE Composite Index, the Nikkei 300 Index and the SES All-Share
Index.

<HEADLINE> Central China Province Well Prepared for Floods on Major Rivers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Some 2.57 million soldiers and
civilians in central China's Henan Province are making
preparations and closely watching the water levels of the
province's six major reservoirs, and the Yellow and Huaihe rivers
that flow through the province.
</P>
<P>
Since this year's flood season began in June, many areas of
Henan have been hit by prolonged rains, causing many tributaries
of Huaihe River and Yangtze River to become swollen. Waterlogging
has appeared in some areas of the Yellow River Valley, which has
been pounded by heavy rains.
</P>
<P>
So far, floods have affected seven million people in the
province and 933,333 hectares of crops, causing a direct economic
loss of 1.67 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
While preparing for the possibility of large floods
on the major rivers of the province in late August, Henan, with a
population of 92 million, has also given support to flood-stricken
Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi and Jiangsu provinces along the Yangtze by
sending them a great amount of flood-control materials.
</P>
<P>
In east China, besides battling the floods on the Yangtze
River, Anhui Province has now sent another 50,000 civilians who
are on around-the-clock patrol on the embankments along Huaihe
River.
</P>
<P>
The water level of the Huainan River upstream is reported to
have exceed the danger line. Plenty of anti-flood materials are in
stock and the flood-fighters are confident they will overcome this
year's floods on Huaihe River.
</P>
<P>
In northeast China, the Harbin hydrometric station on the Songhua
River recorded a water level of 120.66 meters and a water flow of
15,400 cubic meters per second by 11:00 hours today.
</P>
<P>
More than 300,000 soldiers and civilians are now battling on
the flood-fighting front in Harbin, capital of Heilongjiang
Province, reinforcing embankments, building cofferdams and
plugging seepages.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,410 oil wells in the Daqing oilfield in
Heilongjiang, China's largest, were flooded yesterday alone,
including 300 wells that had been closed, causing a drop in oil
production of 11,212 tons of crude oil.
</P>
<P>
In the neighboring Jilin Province, 800,000 soldiers and
civilians, including 40,000 women, are out protecting the levees
built along the Nenjiang and Tao'er rivers.

<HEADLINE> Displaced Ethiopians to Be Rehabilitated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- A project has been designed
to rehabilitate Ethiopians displaced from Eritrea with a 1.7
million U.S. Dollars aid.
</P>
<P>
The project, with money obtained from the European Union, will
provide services for the 30,000 Ethiopians who settled in Addis
Ababa since Ethiopia and Eritrea were liberated from Mengistu
rule in 1991, the Ethiopian Herald reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Teklu Ansa, the project executive, said that the project is
aimed at enabling the displaced group to become self-supportive
citizens providing them training in different vocations to secure
jobs in flour mills, bakeries, carpentry projects as well as
building construction projects.
</P>
<P>
Both governmental and non-governmental organizations have a
duty to provide help for making these people self-reliant, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The number of displaced Ethiopians living in Addis Ababa has
increased to 30,000 following the arrival of 917 people who
joined the displaced during the conflict between Ethiopia and
Eritrea in the past few months.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan House Suspends Privatization Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan Parliament
overwhelmingly passed a resolution Tuesday, asking the government
to suspend its privatization exercise because of the alleged
rampant corruption in the process.
</P>
<P>
It also decided to set up a special committee to investigate
the controversial sale of some of the parastatals like Sheraton
and Nile hotels as well as the Ugandan Commercial Bank, the New
Vision daily reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Incensed by press reports that government officials demanded a
six million U.S. Dollar kickback from Midroc for the purchase of
the five-star Sheraton Hotel, members of Parliament dismissed
outright objections to suspension of privatization exercise by
Third Deputy Prime Minister Paul Etiang and other senior
officials.
</P>
<P>
The dealings unearthed between the divested Uganda Commercial
Bank and Greenland Bank are also raising eye brows.
</P>
<P>
The motion on suspension was put forward by Omongole Aisu and
seconded by Rosette Alleluya Ikote.
</P>
<P>
Newly-elected Speaker Francis Ayume suggested prolonging debate
on the motion, a demand which was quickly rejected by a lot of MPs.
</P>
<P>
One MP said it needs to be halted because it benefits only a
small number of individuals who have amassed wealth. Other MPs
argued that the proceeds from privatization have not been
appropriately used.
</P>
<P>
Ruhakana Rugunda, the minister for presidency, however, argued
that he did not oppose investigation of the process, but it would
cost the country a lot if the whole privatization process is put
to a halt.
</P>
<P>
A lot of tax-payers' money is bound to be lost in subsidizing
companies which are already lined up for privatization, he added.
</P>
<P>
The privatization process began in 1995 and about 85 percent
of the parastatals of the country were privatized by the end of
1997.
</P>
<P>
Executive Director of the Enterprises Development Program
Leonard Mugandwa recently said the privatization process will end
by June 1999. In the remaining time, a total of 142 parastatals
will be privatized.

<HEADLINE> Second Session of Chemotherapy for King Hussein </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The second session of
chemotherapy to treat the cancer in Jordanian King Hussein's
lymphatic tissue at the U.S. Mayo Clinic turned out to be "very
successful," Crown Prince Hassan has said.
</P>
<P>
After the latest treatment, the king's morale was high and he
paid close attention to what was happening in Jordan, Wednesday's
Arabic daily Al Aswaq quoted Hassan as saying late Tuesday evening
when meeting a group of foreign ambassadors to the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The second session of chemotherapy for the king started on
Sunday, Chief of Royal Court Fayez Tarawneh said earlier.
</P>
<P>
Hussein, 62, has been hospitalized at the clinic, Rochester,
Minnesota, since July 14 for suffering from non-Hodgkin's B-cell
lymphoma, which is highly treatable with chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to receive chemotherapy intravenously once
every 20 days over a period from four to five months. The first
session of such treatment was completed at the beginning of the
month and the results were declared as "encouraging."
</P>
<P>
Hussein is the longest-reigning ruler in the Middle
East. August 11 was the 46th anniversary of his accession to the
throne. Hassan, his brother, is his legal successor.

<HEADLINE> State Won't Interfere in Chieftaincy Wrangles, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba has said that his government will never interfere in
chieftaincy wrangles that may erupt in any part of the country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the State House Tuesday when he received a report
by a committee of inquiry into a chieftaincy wrangle in Eastern
Province, Chiluba said that the government will never impose
chiefs on the people and will consult people with knowledge on
traditional heritage.
</P>
<P>
When a problem over chieftaincy arise in the country, said
Chiluba, the government will not rush to make a decision but rely
on the counsel of traditional leaders and other competent bodies.
</P>
<P>
"Disputes over chieftaincy are almost in all parts of the
country, the government, however, will not rush into making a
decision over these matters but will instead rely on the advices
that will be given by people conversant with the issues on the
ground," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba also reiterated that his government will continue to
pursue its policy to exclude chiefs from partisan politics
because keeping such a practice will not be in the interest of
the nation.
</P>
<P>
He explained that by excluding traditional rulers from
partisan politics, the government is enriching the institution of
chieftaincy.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said that chiefs have different subjects under them
who have different political affiliations, therefore, it will be
the best if chiefs "remain away from partisan politics".
</P>
<P>
Last year, a succession wrangle in the Mphamba Chieftaincy in
Eastern Province erupted and Chiluba appointed an inquiry
committee to solve the problem.

<HEADLINE> Coup Rumors Denounced in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- A senator Wednesday denounced
rumors of an impending military-led uprising against the Joseph
Estrada administration, saying the gossip will only pillory the
country's economy which is reeling from the Asian currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
"The alleged coup plotters must think a hundred times whether
their action will result in something good for our country,
because this kind of talk only destabilizes and divides our
nation," Senator Ramon Revilla said.
</P>
<P>
It will also scare both foreign and local investors and create
an atmosphere of political instability, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Why don't we give President Estrada and his administration
more time for their policies and strategies to gain results? He
has been in office barely 60 days and it seems some of us are
expecting miracles to happen immediately," Revilla added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the whole Asian region is currently suffering
from the financial crunch, and according to economists, the
Philippines is still better off than some of its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
"But this picture may turn sour and even bitter if
destabilization moves like coup plots crop up at this point. Unity
is crucial, and if given the proper time I believe Estrada will be
one of our greatest presidents," Revilla said.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Leader to Visit S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's military leader
General Abdulsalam Abubakar will visit South Africa, at the
invitation of President Nelson Mandela, within the next two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
Deputy President Thabo Mbeki's office announced that Abubakar
would pay a state visit to South Africa during which he would
hold talks with Mandela and Mbeki, official reports said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki's spokesman Ricky Naidoo said that the talks were likely
to focus on progress toward the democratization of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The visit, which will mark Abubakar's first visit abroad since
coming to power in June, follows a visit by Mbeki to the troubled
west African country on July 9.
</P>
<P>
"The deputy president was trying to get a picture of the
democratization taking place in Nigeria at that time," said
Naidoo.
</P>
<P>
"Discussions with the (South African) president and the
deputy president are likely to continue the discussions the
deputy president had," he added.
</P>
<P>
A foreign Ministry spokesman said the date for the visit had
yet to be set but that it was possible Abubakar would arrive in
time to attend the summit of the Non-Aligned Movement, which
starts in Durban on August 29.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two countries had been strained since
1995 when Mandela led the call for international sanctions
against Nigeria following the execution of activist Ken Saro Wiwa
and a number of other political prisoners.

<HEADLINE> China Lowers Gold Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The People's Bank of China
(PBOC), the central bank, has announced that due to the continuing
slide of gold prices on the international market, it has decided
to lower domestic gold purchasing and selling prices beginning
August 18.
</P>
<P>
According to the PBOC, the purchasing price for gold has been
lowered from 80.50 yuan per gram to 78.15 yuan per gram, down
2.92 percent; while the selling price has been lowered from 82.10
yuan per gram to 79.70 yuan per gram, also down 2.92 percent.
</P>
<P>
China last readjusted domestic gold purchasing and selling
prices on February 20 this year. The purchasing price of 80.50
yuan per gram was 5.75 percent higher than the international gold
price of 285 U.S. dollars per ounce, while the selling price of
82.10 yuan per gram was 7.59 percent higher than the
international gold price.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that the East Asian financial crisis and the
appreciation of the U.S. dollar have led to weaker demand for gold
in Asia. Gold prices on the international market decreased from
297.50 U.S. dollars per ounce on February 20 to 285 U.S. dollars
on August 12, down 4.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts predict that gold prices will remain low for some
time.

<HEADLINE> Russia Not to Sell Government Gazprom Stake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The Russian State Property
Ministry and Federal Property Fund announced Wednesday not to
sell a 5 percent government stake in the oil and gas giant
Gazprom, due to the unfavorable market situation, a high-ranking
official said.
</P>
<P>
Igor Shuvalov, acting chairman of the Federal Property Fund
(FPF), told a briefing that the Deutsche Bank, the financial
consultant on the Gazprom deal, urged the Russian privatization
agencies to abstain from holding an auction in the face of the
current turmoil on the financial market.
</P>
<P>
The decision to postpone the sale of Gazprom stakes came two
days after the Russian government and central bank raised the
ceiling of the ruble exchange corridor to 9.5 rubles to the U.S.
dollar, up from the original 6.3 to the dollar, which amounted to
a devaluation of the national currency.
</P>
<P>
Shuvalov said the Deutsche Bank will soon give the FPF a
memorandum on investors ready to buy Gazprom shares, the Interfax
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The government wants to sell its stake in Gazprom in order to
raise much needed revenue in the face of a yawning deficit.
</P>
<P>
At least two Western consortiums planned to buy the Gazprom
stake, Shuvalov said.
</P>
<P>
The starting price of the stake, originally set at 1.65
billion U.S. dollars in accordance with the Central Bank's
exchange rate as of August 13, may be changed, Shuvalov said.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Bans Smoking in Government Offices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
banned smoking in all government offices and premises, where the
selling and display of tobacco products are also prohibited.
</P>
<P>
According to a circular signed by Gidado Idris, the Secretary
to the Government of the Federation, all government offices and
premises nationwide are now tobacco-free zones.
</P>
<P>
The circular dated July 31 was addressed to all service
chiefs, the police, all the ministries and parastatals as well as
state governments, according to Wednesday's Daily Times, a major
national newspaper in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The government announced the ban of smoking in hospitals as
well as the federal and state ministries of health last May 29,
the 1998 "World No Tobacco Day".
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's health officials have expressed their concern that
some Western tobacco producers, under a mounting pressure by
anti-smokers, are turning their emphasis of promotion to Africa.
</P>
<P>
A research by the Federal Ministry of Health estimates that
there are about 4.2 million smokers among Nigeria's 120 million
population.

<HEADLINE> Korean Labor Strike Costs Hyundai Huge Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 19 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's Hyundai Motor
Co. has lost 770 billion won (some 592 million U.S. dollars) in
production due to a labor strike since last month, said the
Commerce, Industry and Energy Ministry Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Hyundai has been unable to market its new model car EF Sonata
in North America and Europe while its production of compact car
Atoz, which is popular in Europe, has been suspended and
stockpiles of export-bound cars are also falling short of
delivery, said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, among Hyundai's parts suppliers, 52 primary
subcontractors and 250 secondary subcontractors went bankrupt,
with their total losses hitting 600 billion won (about 462 million
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The labor strike began after Hyundai decided to lay off some
2,000 workers as part of restructuring efforts to overcome current
financial difficulties.
</P>
<P>
If the strike continues until the end of this month, export
decrease will continue.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations sponsored by the South Korean government between
labour and management have failed despite the workers' offer to
accept job-sharing and wage cut in exchange for Hyundai's
withdrawal of the layoff plan.
</P>
<P>
Tensions have increased around the Hyundai Motor Co. in Ulsan
of the country after thousands of police reinforcements with cars
of capable of spraying tear-gas bombs and bulldozers to clear road
blocks were seen reaching the city on TV.
</P>
<P>
Media reports said police are ready to storm the factory at any
time as use of force is believed the only way to resolve the
standoff over the proposed layoffs.
</P>
<P>
However, observers said a police raid could result in heavy
casualties as workers and their family members living tents
established along walls and gates of the factory vowed to fight to
the end by all means.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Government's Fiscal Position to Improve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government's
fiscal position will improve in the third quarter of this year due
to the positive developments in the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
According to a report released here Wednesday by the Department
of Finance, as the economy took a battering in the second quarter,
the government is expected to introduce measures that would lead
to its attainment of 2-3 percent growth in the gross national
product (GNP) this year.
</P>
<P>
Possible sources for the government's revenues for this year
include a projected tax revenue collection of 498.4 billion pesos
(about 12.4 billion U.S. dollars), plus the impending move of the
government to sell government-controlled corporations and assets,
it says.
</P>
<P>
From the privatization of assets alone, the report says, the
government is expected to generate a total of 7 billion pesos (175
million dollars) for 1998.
</P>
<P>
Next year, it says, the government is poised to increase its
revenues from privatization to 10.4 billion pesos (260 million
dollars).
</P>
<P>
These revenue projections will contribute 18.5 percent of the
GNP, it says.
</P>
<P>
For the first semester of this year alone, the national
government's budget deficit already hit 24 billion pesos (600
million dollars).

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Seeks Help in Tackling Flood Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has for
the first time sought assistance from the donor community to
tackle the in-flood and post-flood situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister A.M.S. Kabria Tuesday apprised the
representatives of the donor community of the latest flood
situation and the devastation caused by it at a meeting here, said
an official handout available here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-five of the country's total of 64 districts have gone
under the grip of floods, Kabria said, adding that proper
quantification of damage would be possible when flood water
recedes.
</P>
<P>
The government is apprehending extensive damage to rice crop
because of the prolonged flood and at the same time, it is
conducting relief operation with efficiency, he stated.
</P>
<P>
Should the flood prolong further, emergency relief, especially
food relief, would be urgently needed, he said.
</P>
<P>
A massive program for agricultural rehabilitation, supply of
home-building materials and repairing and reconstruction of other
physical infrastructure would have to be taken up after the flood,
he told those present.
</P>
<P>
"The flood situation is feared to deteriorate further," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Kabria said a formal appeal to the donor community "is likely
to be made within the next few days."
</P>
<P>
The current flood, which has lasted for over a month, has
damaged and washed away more than 5,000 kilometers of roads, some
2,400 kilometers of embankment and about 500,000 hectares of
cropland.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 million people have been affected by flood, with
the death toll rising to nearly 300.
</P>
<P>
Besides, diarrhea, dysentery and other water-borne diseases
have broken out in some flood-hit districts, with the number of
patients rising to 80,436 since July 15 while the death toll from
diarrhea rising to 48, the Health Control Room said.
</P>
<P>
Government health departments have sent more than 3,000 medical
teams to the flood-hit areas.
</P>
<P>
The government departments concerned have so far distributed
42,092 tons of rice and over 235.9 million taka (about 551,106
U.S. dollars) and a large quantity of other relief materials to
the distressed people in the districts ravaged by the current
flood, according to the Disaster Management and Relief Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The overall flood situation is deteriorating further in 12 of
the 55 flood-hit districts, with major rivers in three basins
swelling due to heavy rainfall and onrush of waters from upper
catchment areas, the Flood Forecasting and Warning Center said.

<HEADLINE> Operation Smile Makes Harelip Children Beam in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 19 (Xinhua) -- For the first time, one-year-old
Lei Zhifu, who used to have a congenital cleft palate, smiled
sweetly and happily after plastic surgery performed by doctors
from an international welfare medical organization.
</P>
<P>
Lei was one of the 2,000 Chinese children with cleft palates
treated by Operation Smile Medical Mission (OSMM) during its 10
visits to China.
</P>
<P>
For about 20 years, the OSMM, founded by American plastic
surgeon Bill Magee and his wife Kathy Magee, has been offering
free treatment around the globe to children whose families are too
poor to afford the operation.
</P>
<P>
Cleft palate is one of the most common congenital birth
defects, and statistics show that one out of every 770 children
born in Beijing is born with a lip-palate cleft. China now has
about 2.4 million people with this condition.
</P>
<P>
From August 4 to 15, more than 50 plastic surgeons from the
United States, Colombia, the Philippines and Singapore took part
in OSMM's first operations in Beijing, their tenth visit to China
overall.
</P>
<P>
During these 12 days, 260 children underwent corrective surgery
at the plastic surgery hospital of the Chinese Academy of Medical
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Wang Qing, a 7-month-old girl from the neighbouring city of
Tianjin, was the first to receive treatment. When her foster
mother, an English woman working in Tianjin, first saw her in an
orphanage the girl was unable to smile because of her harelip.
</P>
<P>
Han Aihua, the mother of a 9-year-old boy from Hebei
Province, thanked the foreign doctors time and again after the
successful operation. "My son would live in misery all his life
but for your help," she said.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Matthew Denenberg from the United States, who had worked
round the clock for several days, said he was proud of what he was
doing. "The happiest time for my family and me is when we are
looking at the photos of the children whose lip-palate cleft has
been cured," he added.
</P>
<P>
Canadian doctor Kathy Thiemann's task was to teach the parents
how to help their children speak correctly after the
operation. She said she would like to continue doing this work and
that she intended to adopt an abandoned cleft-palate child.
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 people from all over China applied for the OSMM
operation in Beijing, but due to limited time and facilities, only
one-fifth were lucky enough to be scheduled for the surgery.

<P>
CHANGSHA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- A tower that is more than 1,700
years old in the city of Yueyang in central China's Hunan Province
has survived six flood crests on the Yangtze River this year.
</P>
<P>
The water in the Chenglingji section of the river hit a record
high of 35.6 meters, but the three-story tower is on a platform a
dozen meters above the water level.
</P>
<P>
No landslides, cracks, or dangerous signs have been reported
near the tower.
</P>
<P>
The Tengwang Pavilion in the city of Nanchang, capital of
Jiangxi Province, is also safe in spite of serious flooding,
because of local government and departmental efforts to protect
the ancient tower.
</P>
<P>
At the end of July, a serious flood brought water levels only
20 centimeters below the bottom of the tower, which was built
during the Tang Dynasty (618-917 A.D.).

reconsider the duties levied on Saudi trucks entering its
territory. The two countries are discussing the Saudi proposal.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed sources at the Saudi Ministry of Economy said the

agreement.

It is also aimed at eradicating the obstacles to the increase
of the bilateral trade volume, which stood at about 1.1 billion
Saudi Arabia rials (more than 293 million U.S. dollars) last year,
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Germany exported 18.9 billion Germany marks (10.5
billion dollars) worth of goods to the Arab world in 1997, 16
percent more than in 1996.

A report on German-Arab trade issued recently by the German
Embassy in Cairo said that Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the United Arab
Emirates were the three largest Arab importers of German products
last year.

0.56 meter higher than the record, and was flowing at 15,000
cu. m. per second at 09:00 hours today and was still rising.
</P>
<P>
Water control specialists say the level will reach 120.70

well.
</P>
<P>
In central China, the 1,500-km-long levee along Dongting Lake

"Uganda is a big market for their (Kenyan) manufactured
goods," said an official with the UMA.
</P>
<P>
Uganda is the largest trading partner of Kenya, although its
imports from Kenya have been slowly declining for the last three
years.
</P>
<P>
Imports from Kenya by Uganda fell from 280 million U.S.
Dollars in 1995 to 200 million Dollars in 1996 and then to 157
million Dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
This has been attributed to the fact that a number of
international companies based in Kenya that used to export to
Uganda have opened businesses in Uganda which has also built its
own industrial plants.
</P>
<P>
Goods such as cement, iron sheets, plastics, foam products,
toilet wares, textiles and electrical goods that were once
imported from Kenya are now being produced in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
UMA, with a permanent show ground at Lugogo in the outskirts of
Kampala, collapsed in 1972 when dictator Idi Amin expelled Asians
from Uganda who controlled most of the industries. It was revived
in 1988.

<HEADLINE> China's Highest Dam Completed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANZHIHUA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- China's highest river dam --
the Ertan Hydropower Station Dam -- was completed earlier this
week.
</P>
<P>
Traversing the Yalong River, the 240-meter-high arch-shaped dam
looks like a rainbow stretching across the green mountain valley.
</P>
<P>
Located 46 kilometers from Panzhihua City, the steel capital of
Sichuan Province in southwest China, the dam is the third highest
in the world.
</P>
<P>
Sustaining over 9.8 million tons of water pressure, one of the
largest in the world, the dam is also believed to be highly
reliable for flood discharging. It is now playing an important
role in blocking floods along the Yalong River, a major tributary
of the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
The 230-million-U.S.-dollar dam was jointly built by companies
from Italy, France and China.
</P>
<P>
Partially operational last week, the Ertan Hydropower Station
is the largest such project to be completed in this
century.

<HEADLINE> One-third Americans Are Vitamin C Depleted: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Routine health exams have
shown that one-third Americans were vitamin C depleted, according
to a study published in the latest issue of the Journal of the
American College of Nutrition.
</P>
<P>
The study was conducted by Arizona State University researchers
who tested 494 middle class patients and found 30 percent
of them were vitamin C depleted, and 6.3 percent suffered from the
more severe condition, vitamin C deficiency.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Carol Johnston, the leader of the researchers, wrote that
those who were vitamin C deficient and vitamin C depleted may feel
tired, weak, irritable, weight-lossing and vague muscle-aching,
all early symptoms of scurvy, a disease caused by vitamin C
deficiency.
</P>
<P>
The most probable factor behind the vitamin deficiency, said
Johnston, was not eating enough fruits and vegetables that are
high in vitamin C, such as oranges, grapefruits, broccoli,
cauliflower and cabbage.
</P>
<P>
"If you are just eating apples, bananas, green beans and
lettuce, that's not going to do it," Johnston said. "They are the
most commonly consumed and they literally have no vitamin C."
</P>
<P>
The researchers also linked vitamin C deficiency partially to
smoking. Previous studies have shown that smokers need over 200
milligrams of the vitamin daily to maintain blood levels
comparable to those of nonsmokers consuming the recommended daily
allowance of the vitamin.

<HEADLINE> China Developing Unified Contract Code </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 19 (Xinhua) - A lengthy draft of a contract law
with 441 articles will be put before China's top legislators next
Monday, according to Wang Shengming, one of the authors who is
working with the National People's Congress (NPC) Standing
Committee's Legislative Affairs Committee.
</P>
<P>
Wang said today that this will be China's first unified
contract code to cover all forms of economic and civil
agreements.
</P>
<P>
It will be more comprehensive and detailed and easier to
enforce than fragmented contract laws such as separate contracts
laws governing domestic business and foreign trade, and a contract
law on technology, he said.
</P>
<P>
The new law has some additions to ensure economic order and stop
the widespread contract fraud now taking place in China, he said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the many laws relating to contracts, there are still many
aspects of the economy left undefined, experts say. For instance,
no law yet addresses the issue of contracts between a Chinese
individual and a foreign individual.
</P>
<P>
And sometimes different laws may have different stipulations on
the same matter because they were issued at different times.
</P>
<P>
The law of contracts is fundamental to the market economy, Wang
said. "As China shifts the majority of its economy to the market,
a unified and comprehensive contract law is urgently needed."
</P>
<P>
He quoted sources from the State Development Planning
Commission as saying that there are only five major commodities
under state control today: crude oil, oil products, petroleum,
coal, and automobiles, with the majority of all other commodities
now on the free market.
</P>
<P>
According to other statistics, more than 4 billion new
contracts are registered with the government bureaus of industry
and commerce nationwide every year, and Chinese courts handle 3
million contract disputes annually.
</P>
<P>
Wang disclosed that the draft law provides many principles and
measures for handling contract fraud, saying that contracts drawn
up in an irregular manner shall be invalid, and loss incurred
therein must be compensated for by the instigator of the contract.
</P>
<P>
It took about five years for scholars and government officials
to create this draft law.

The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel has agreed to carry out the American initiative and
withdraw from a total of 13 percent of the West Bank, Israeli

-- The United States did not provide Israel with the advance
intelligence information it had about Iran's intention to test
its medium-range Shahab-3 missile last month, a reliable

earlier assumptions that both Israel and the U.S. were taken by
surprise by the Iranian launch.

CHANGSHA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Hunan Province
has begun delivering college admission notices for local students
via a special channel used previously only for confidential
government documents.
</P>
<P>
Notices of acceptance in China are usually sent to students by
mail, but the education committee here has found a way to
guarantee safe delivery, especially in flooded areas.
</P>
<P>
Hunan is on the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, one of the
areas hit most seriously by floods since June, but college
entrance examinations are still being given in the province.
</P>
<P>
Universities and colleges across the country will get 56,082
students from Hunan this year, and admission notices are ready for
the first group of 10,300 students, which are enrolling in key
universities. Admission work for other universities and colleges
is still underway.

<HEADLINE> International Fireworks Festival In Central China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- An international fireworks
festival will be held in the city of Liuyang in central China's
Hunan Province October 20-22.
</P>
<P>
Regarded as a hometown of fireworks in China, Liuyang has a
history in the business that can be traced back more than 1,300
years.
</P>
<P>
The fireworks business is now a major industry in Liuyang and
employs a third of its 1.3 million people. Last year, its output
value exceeded 1.1 billion yuan (133 million U.S. dollars). Its
more than 3,000 types of fireworks can be found in 60 countries.
</P>
<P>
The mayors of 100 Chinese cities are being invited to the
festival to attend symposia and to discuss an urban ban on
fireworks.
</P>
<P>
Fireworks have been an indispensable part of Chinese
celebrations for thousands of years, but in recent years, they
have been banned in most large and medium-sized cities because of
the potential fire threat, as well as noise and air pollution.
</P>
<P>
But, all is not lost, some new smoke-less fireworks will make
their debut at the festival, according to the organizers. So, the
tradition may continue.

<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine vowed Tuesday to take all
necessary measures to stabilize its financial market at a time
when the Russian one is in turbulence and the rouble has
depreciated.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine's Finance Minister Igor Michukov and head of the
National Bank Viktor Yushcheako announced at a news conference
that the National Bank would raise the mortgage interest rate from
82 percent to 92 percent as of Tuesday, but the discount rate would
remain at 82 percent.
</P>
<P>
Michukov did not rule out the negative influence from the
world's financial crisis, in particular from Russia, on his
country.
</P>
<P>
He said that Ukraine's financial market was vastly different
from that of Russia, adding that there were no dangerous elements
in Ukraine such as those which have caused crisis to the Russian
financial market.
</P>
<P>
In addition, as Ukraine's external and internal debts would not
cause critical pressure on its financial market, it is not
necessary for Ukraine to take such strong measures as those taken
by Russia, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, since this year Ukraine's financial crisis has been
worsening, with the country's external debts topping 12 billion
U.S. dollars and internal debts topping 7 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate of the country's currency plunged from 1.8
gryvna to 1 U.S. dollar early this year, to 2.18 gryvna to 1
dollar at present.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine now urgently needs the 2.2 billion U.S. dollar credit
which the International Monetary Fund agreed to provide for tiding
over the financial crisis.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka to Hold By-Elections if Opposition MPs Resign: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina Tuesday categorically said that the government would
immediately go for by-election if the opposition Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP)'s MPs resign, media reports said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister's remarks came in response to the BNP's move
for resignation from the parliament, in which it holds 113 seats.
</P>
<P>
Last month, BNP's standing committee decided that all BNP MPs
should deposit their resignation letters to party chief Begum Zia.
</P>
<P>
However, there was no substantial progress in the BNP's move to
collect the party lawmakers' letters of resignation from the
parliament until Tuesday despite a fresh bid to push the party
decision in this regard, reports said.
</P>
<P>
"We will immediately go for by-elections, should the BNP MPs
resign from their respective parliamentary seats," Hasina said
while addressing a discussion meeting here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"They (BNP MPs) have decided to resign from parliament...but
why?" she said. "Whenever they wanted to discuss any issue we
facilitated the discussion."
</P>
<P>
"But when we were in the opposition they did not allow us to
discuss the issues we wanted to discuss," said Hasina, who is also
the president of the ruling Awami League.
</P>
<P>
"Let them resign, we will accept and organize by-elections,"
she stated. "Then people will judge who is right."

<P>
PYONGYANG, August 19 (Xinhua) -- A Foreign Ministry spokesman
of Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) Tuesday condemned
the large-scale military exercise jointly staged by the United States
and South Korea as provocative and aggressive.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the exercise code-named Ulchi Focus Lens
(UFL), involving 13,000 U.S. military personnel and 70,000 South
Korean forces and scheduled to run until August 29, was a military
threat against the DPRK and furthered the war footing on the
Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the annual exercise began in mid-1970s and
is still being conducted in the post-Cold War 1990s, which showed
that the United States had not given up its erroneous policy of
strangling DPRK militarily.
</P>
<P>
He said the tension-easing policies proclaimed by the United
States toward the DPRK were hypocritical. The people of the DPRK
and its armed forces were determined to crush provocations of any
kind, he noted.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Thai farmers can now settle
their debts with the Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural
Cooperatives (BAAC) by planting trees, English newspaper The
Nation reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The BAAC and Highway Department have agreed to a proposal made
by Mechai Viravaidya, president of the Population and Rural
Development Association, to carry out a pilot project helping
indebted farmers in three northeastern provinces of Buriram, Khon
Kaen and Maha Sarakham.
</P>
<P>
Under the project, which will begin on August 28, the Highway
Department will hire a farmer at 160 baht (4 U.S. dollars) a day
to plant trees, but the farmer will only get 60 baht (1.5 dollars)
while 100 baht (2.5 dollars) will go for debt repayment.
</P>
<P>
Mechai said he was trying to invite other government agencies,
which have a budget for planting trees and forests, to take part
in the project and expects to expand the project for farmers
nationwide soon.
</P>
<P>
Farmers with debt between 10,000 baht (250 dollars) and 20,000
baht (500 dollars) will be allowed to participate in the pilot
project, which will last for 90 days.

<HEADLINE> Sacramento Kings Fire Head Coach and Assistant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The Sacramento Kings fired
coach Eddie Jordan Tuesday, trying to erase the memories of this
season's dismal finish.
</P>
<P>
The team also opted not to renew the contract of assistant
coach Mike Bratz. Jordan completed his first full season with the
club as the Kings went 27-55, but won only one of their final 20
games. He was 33-64 overall with the Kings, coaching the final 15
games of the 1996-97 season after Garry St. Jean resigned.
</P>
<P>
"This was a tough decision for the organization because Eddie
and Mike are very committed professional basketball coaches,"
said Kings vice president of basketball operations Geoff Petrie.
</P>
<P>
The 43-year-old Jordan had problems maintaining control of the
team. Jordan spent seven years in the NBA Cleveland, New Jersey,
the Los Angeles Lakers and Portland. He picked up a championship
ring with the Lakers in 1982 and began his coaching career as a
volunteer assistant with Rutgers two years later. Jordan joined
the Kings in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Bratz was an assistant with the Kings for five seasons, and
lead assistant under Jordan last year. Both will be kept on as
outside consultants during their job search for other
opportunies.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Exports Grow in First Half </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's exports increased by
10 percent to 2.2 billion U.S. dollars in the first half of this
year from 2 billion dollars in the same period last year,
according to the Export Development Board Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Board sources said that most individual product sectors had
grown in the period. The diamond and jewelry sector, fresh fruits,
cut flowers and plastic products were the only exceptions.
</P>
<P>
The traditional export sector of tea, rubber and coconut grew
by 17 percent from 405 million dollars to 472.8 million dollars
for the first half of the year over the corresponding period last
year. Tea export, which recorded an 18.5 percent growth, was
largely responsible for the exceptional growth in the traditional
export sector.
</P>
<P>
Of agricultural products spices showed a remarkable increase of
47 percent to 72 million dollars from 48.92 million dollars.
Cinnamon, pepper, cloves, nutmeg and cardamom fetched good prices.
Betel leaves, arecanuts, oil seeds and cashew nuts showed marginal
improvements.
</P>
<P>
In the textiles and apparel sector, there was an overall 22
percent increase during the first six months to 1,056.1 million
dollars from 865.3 million dollars in the corresponding period of
1997, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
This was due to the high value and better prices received in
the international market and the increase in the export of
non-quota items to the United States.
</P>
<P>
Fisheries grew by 59 percent to 49.21 million dollars from
30.91 million dollars a year earlier.

COLOMBO, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The Netherlands government has
decided to grant 13.5 million U.S. dollars to Sri Lanka to improve
the living and labor conditions in the estate sector of the

</P>
<P>
The sources said the PDSP will focus on the improvement of
living standards of plantation workers in about 500 estates of Sri
Lanka.
</P>

BANGKOK, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The National Police Office of
Thailand will come under the prime minister's control instead of
the interior minister's as agreed by a cabinet meeting Tuesday, a
government press release available Wednesday said.
</P>
<P>
The resolution marked the start of a lengthy process to improve

A deputy premier is likely to be assigned to supervise
specifically the Police Department once the new structure is in
place.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai has said that the change would
alleviate corruption.
</P>
<P>
The transformation aims at improving the administration and
development of the Police Department to be "more active and rapid,

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Rights Activists Criticize Police Chief's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's rights activists
lashed out Tuesday at National Police Chief Lt. Gen. Roesmanhadi
who recently accused some non-governmental organizations (NGOs) of
exaggerating reports of rapes and sexual assaults against Chinese
Indonesian women during the May riots here and in other cities.
</P>
<P>
"His statement was unethical and it was a dismissal of the
ongoing investigation by the (government-sponsored) joint
fact-finding team into the May riots," Bambang Widjojanto,
director of the Indonesian Legal Aid Institute, said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Roesmanhadi said earlier that if the NGOs failed to come up
with evidence and continued their claims of gang rapes then they
could be charged with spreading rumors.
</P>
<P>
"By that statement, he failed to create a positive atmosphere
that (could encourage) witnesses to come forward," said Bambang,
who is also a member of the fact-finding team.
</P>
<P>
The government established the team last month which includes
representatives from the Armed Forces, government agencies, the
National Commission on Human Rights and non-governmental
organizations to investigate reports that the riots, in which more
than 1,200 people were killed, were masterminded.
</P>
<P>
Bambang said that the team will begin this week to hear
testimonies of a number of witnesses of the riots, including those
who had been raped or sexually abused.
</P>
<P>
Rights activists, including those in the Volunteers for
Humanity led by Catholic priest Sandyawan Sumardi, have said that
168 women and children were raped and sexually assaulted during
the riots, of whom 20 died or committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
The rights body has confirmed that the rapes and sexual
assaults were perpetrated systematically by unidentified people
during the riots.

<HEADLINE> Croatia, Yugoslavia Meet to Discuss Prevlaka Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The foreign ministers of Croatia
and Yugoslavia agreed Tuesday to start negotiations on the
disputed Prevlaka Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic and Yugoslav counterpart
Zivadin Jovanovic agreed to begin talks on the 100-hectare
territory and other regions of dispute no later than September 15.
</P>
<P>
Lying at the mouth of the Yugoslavia's Kotor Bay on the
Adriatic Sea, the tiny strip of Prevlaka was a part of the former
Yugoslavia. After its independence, Croatia claimed sovereignty,
but the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia refused to forfeit the land.
</P>
<P>
In September 1991, the two countries clashed on the
peninsula. In October 1992, a United Nations mission was sent
there to observe the ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
Croatia and Yugoslavia established diplomatic relations in
August 1996, but talks on the Prevlaka Peninsula have made little
progress.
</P>
<P>
The prolonged dispute has seriously slowed the trade
development, especially in tourism, the two ministers said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also covered captive release, consulate
establishment, the protection of ethnic minorities and the
division of the assets of the former Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Canada Reminds Britain of Safety of Asbestos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Canada Tuesday urged British
health authorities to "weigh objectively" the evidence favoring
safe use of chrysotile asbestos in industrial products.
</P>
<P>
This was in response to a decision by the British government to
initiate public consultations following completion of a British
health department report comparing health risks of asbestos with
substitute materials.
</P>
<P>
"We are not opposed to better clarifying how the mineral can be
safely used, thereby providing greater market certainty," said
International Trade Minister Sergio Marchi in a release.
</P>
<P>
"But we are concerned that these consultations may lead to
unnecessarily restrictive measures that would reduce access of
Canadian asbestos to British or other European markets. We will
ensure that Canadian views are heard clearly as the process
unfolds," added the Minister.
</P>
<P>
"We would welcome an objective review of the facts," said
Natural Resources Minister Ralph Goodale in the same release. "The
scientific evidence clearly indicates that chrysotile asbestos can
be used safely, under controlled conditions, and brings valuable
benefits to society."
</P>
<P>
The U.K. consultations were requested by the British Health and
Safety Commission, based on their view that recent scientific
findings suggest there are fewer health risks associated with
substitute products.
</P>
<P>
To date, neither the European Union nor Canada has concluded
that substitute fibers are any safer than chrysotile asbestos, the
release said.

<HEADLINE> Thai Govt Passes New Law on Foreign Businesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The Thai cabinet Tuesday passed
a proposed new foreign business law to replace the existing one so
that a more modern and liberal legal framework can be created, a
government press release available Wednesday said.
</P>
<P>
Under the new law, foreign investors are eligible to enter 30
more local businesses, but businesses relating to national safety
and security, or having an impact on culture and tradition,
traditional handicrafts, natural resources and the environment,
remain reserved.
</P>
<P>
However, exemptions can be sought with approval by the Commerce
Ministry and the cabinet in certain cases, especially when there
are technology-transfer, employment and other national benefits.
</P>
<P>
The existing Alien Businesses Law, known as Por Vor 281, which
has been in force since 1972, reserves 68 businesses and
professions exclusively for Thai citizens.
</P>
<P>
The main reason to replace Por Vor 281 is because "this law is
obsolete and contains improper regulations particularly under the
current economic and investment circumstances," the press release
said.
</P>
<P>
The proposed new law, after a final review by the Council of
State, will be forwarded to the Parliament for enactment.
</P>
<P>
When enacted, the law will be reviewed every two years to
update the legislation to suit the conditions in world trade and
investment.
</P>
<P>
The proposed law also requires a minimum Thai ownership of 25
percent in restricted businesses, while those related to national
security require a minimum Thai ownership of 40 percent and
two-fifths of board seats.
</P>
<P>
Greater proportions could be allowed on a case-by-case basis,
but the foreign shareholding ceiling would not exceed 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
The new law is expected to bring about a more liberal
investment atmosphere and make it easier for foreign firms to do
business in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The government also hopes that the new law could promote
business competitiveness and stimulate economic growth in the
second half of this year.
</P>
<P>
The Thai economy is expected to see a contraction of 7-8
percent in 1998.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, August 19 (Xinhua)-- A four-year-old home-improvement
program has upgraded the housing conditions of 500,000 families in
Tianjin, the biggest industrial city in northern China.
</P>
<P>
Introduced in 1994, the program has already resulted in the
demolition of 4.3 million square meters of old one-story houses
and the construction of more than 10 million square meters of
apartment buildings.
</P>
<P>
This has helped raise the per capita living space of the
residents from six square meters to 12 square meters.
</P>
<P>
The program has also helped propel the local housing market
which had been in a long slump. During the past four years,
housing sales in the city amounted to 12.34 billion yuan (1.5
billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The program has also drawn millions of U.S. dollars in
investments from Hong Kong developers.
</P>
<P>
Before 1994, Tianjin, with a population of more than nine
million, had seven million square meters of dilapidated one-story
houses built before 1949 without kitchens and toilets.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Use Cell-Engineering For Better Wheat Seeds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have
developed two varieties of wheat with greater yields through
genetic engineering.
</P>
<P>
They say that the new wheat seed is expected to add 1,500 to
2,250 kilograms of output per hectare and reduces the risk
from lack of sunshine and insect pests in most of other wheat.
</P>
<P>
The genetically-engineered seeds, named "Ji-Wheat No.42" and
"Hua 521", were developed by scientists at the Hebei Academy of
Agricultural and Forestry Sciences after 800 experiments over the
past decade.
</P>
<P>
The high-yield wheat seeds help produce 7,500 kilograms per
hectare of wheat on single-irrigation land and 9,000 kilograms on
double-irrigation land.
</P>
<P>
Zheng Qicheng, head of a national cell-engineering program and
wheat seed breeding expert, says that the two kinds of wheat are
suitable for much of China's vast amount of wheat land.

JAKARTA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's Officers Honor
council completed its investigation Tuesday of three senior
officers suspected of involving in the abductions of political
activists by the Army's Special Force (Kopassus) early this year.
</P>
<P>
The seven-member council conducted a three-hour final hearing
in which they questioned former chief of Kopassus Lieutenant
General Prabowo Subianto -- a once fast-rising Army officer and
the ambitious son-in-law of former president Soeharto, his
predecessor Major General Muchhdi Purwopranjono and commander of
Kopassus' intelligence operations (Group IV) Colonel Chairawan,
Council Secretary Lt. Gen. Djamari Chaniago said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Djamari said the council will present recommendations to Armed
Forces Chief General Wiranto on the result of the investigation,
local leading newspapers reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Prabowo had admitted earlier his wrong doing in the abductions
and said he would be responsible for the cases.
</P>
<P>
Djamari said the council could suggest both administrative and
court-martials, or either of the punishments.
</P>
<P>
Some local newspapers reported that Prabowo may also be
involved in other criminal cases such as rioting in May in Jakarta
and other cities during which about 1,200 people were killed and
more than 5,000 shops and buildings were damaged or burnt. The
rioters also raped more than 160 women, most of them ethnic
Chinese.

<HEADLINE> California to Build More Plants to Meet Power Shortages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 18 (Xinhua) -- California is considering to
build nearly a dozen of power plants as demand for electricity
outstripped supply twice this summer, according to a report of the
California Energy Commission (CEC).
</P>
<P>
The CEC predicted electricity shortages could begin by the year
2000 and possibly as early as 1999 in California, which, with a
population of 33 million last year, is the most populous state in
the U.S.
</P>
<P>
CEC also warned of planned blackouts and higher rates during
the coming hot summer months if temperatures soar and millions of
users switch on their air conditioners.
</P>
<P>
This summer daytime temperatures in California have been mostly
around 40 degrees centigrade.
</P>
<P>
Another reason to the possible electricity shortages in
California is the time gap between the shutdown of some aging
gas-fired and nuclear power plants and replacement of new power
plants in the state.
</P>
<P>
CEC right now is considering four applications to build
gas-fired generators to produce about 2,700 megawatts, about 6
percent of what California uses on a hot day. Reports also said
that plans for seven additional plants, with a combined capacity
of about 2,800 megawatts, have been announced by various
companies.

<HEADLINE> Passenger Seeks Compensation for Delayed Train Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, August 19 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese passenger has demanded
economic compensations from a railway company in northeast China
because the train he took was delayed for two and a half hours.
</P>
<P>
The case is the first of its kind in China as train delays have
been considered normal by most passengers and no Chinese citizen
had ever filed a lawsuit for this reason.
</P>
<P>
The passenger, Zhang Hui, filed a lawsuit against Dalian
Railway Co., Ltd., at a local court on July 23 because the train
he took on July 13 kept some 1,000 hungry passengers waiting for 2
1/2 hours, causing many passengers to miss connections with
airplanes and ships.
</P>
<P>
The ticket price of the No. K234 express train, which runs
between the provincial capital of Shenyang and Dalian on the
coast, is 60 yuan, which is more than double the normal price and
considered comfortable and high-speed.
</P>
<P>
"Instead of by such irresistible forces as floods and war, the
train's delay was caused by mechanical failure and mismanagement;
as a result, the railway company has violated its contract with
passengers," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
To date, only two of the 1,000 passengers have supported
Zhang's action.
</P>
<P>
""Economic compensation is not the most important issue,"
Zhang said. "What I really want through the lawsuit is to
improve the legal awareness of ordinary citizens, and catch the
attention of China's judicial circles so as to further revise and
perfect the the Railway Law."
</P>
<P>
The Dalian Railway Transportation Court, which received Zhang's
lawsuit, has set a hearing for Monday.
</P>
<P>
"As a Chinese citizen, Zhang is enshrined with the right to
lodge a lawsuit, and his lawsuit is in full accordance with
China's Civil Procedural Law," said Li Xiaoyun, the presiding
judge in charge of the case.
</P>
<P>
"As this is the first case of such sorts in China, it really
put forward a test before the court," said Jin Musen, president of
the court. "Nevertheless, in the spirit of fairness, the court
will make a ruling and offer a reasonable judicial explanation to
the plaintiff."
</P>
<P>
On August 17, the court in a session overruled Zhang's claim on
the grounds that the country's Railway Law has no provisions for
the compensation for train delays.
</P>
<P>
However, Zhang Hui said he will appeal to a higher court.

WASHINGTON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- An office building in Kansas
was evacuated Tuesday after an envelope containing white powder
and a note describing the substance as anthrax was found in a
stairwell, the Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) said that 20 to
25 people might have been exposed to the powder found in the
envelope and on control panels in three elevators at the Finney
State Office Building in Wichita, southern Kansas.

Anthrax, a disease normally associated with animals such as
sheep or goats, can be used as a weapon when spores are released
into the air and people inhale them. It is almost always fatal if
inhaled.

About 15 people were showered down at the site as a precaution
and about 200 people were evacuated. The building remained closed

BELGRADE, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Kosovo Albanian leaders refused
to attend talks with Serbian government negotiators on Tuesday in
protest at the continued government crackdown on civilians in the
province.
</P>

The Tanjug news agency reported that the government delegation
led by Ratko Markovic, deputy premier of Serbia, waited for 45
minutes at the conference site in Kosovo's provincial capital,
Pristina, after the scheduled start time of 2:00 p.m.(1200 GMT).

Following the incident, Kosovo Information Bureau Director
Bosko Drobnjak said although the ethnic Albanian representatives
failed to attend talks, the Serbian delegation's offer for resumed
discussions remained open.
</P>
<P>
The government delegation was ready to start unconditional talks
with the Kosovo Albanians at any time, he said.
</P>
<P>
Pehmi Agani, head of the Kosovo Albanian delegation, reportedly
said Tuesday morning that they refused to meet the government
delegation because Serbian authorities failed to end the crackdown
on Albanian civilians in the province and withdraw their forces
from the province.
</P>
<P>
On August 13, ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova announced a
new five-member team for peace talks while Markovic, head of the
Serbian delegation, initiated a resumption of talks this week in a

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 19 (Xinhua) -- After more than 40 years of
searching, Chinese scientists have finally settled on an ideal
location for their observatory in Lijiang in southwest China's
Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) will build it 3,193
meters above sea level in an area free of lighting, pollution, and
dust from cities, at Gaomeigu, whose name means "a place higher
than the sky" in the local Naxi language.
</P>
<P>
An observatory in a southern province is better for
astronomical observations in general because China is in the
northern hemisphere, scientists pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Because Gaomeigu is near the Lijiang Airport and a highway
connecting Yunnan and the Tibet Autonomous Region, it also
provides convenient transport for researchers.
</P>
<P>
The world's best observatories are now found in the United
States, North Africa, and Chile, so an observatory in southern
China will make up for a lack in the Far-east and Pacific region,
experts say.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The port city of Ningbo in east
China's Zhejiang Province has began to clean up all the 91 streams
that flow through the urban area.
</P>
<P>
The city government has decided to have sanitation workers
clean the river surface 12 hours every day, officials say, to
eliminate all waste floating on the surface and to keep people
from throwing garbage into the river.
</P>
<P>
The city plans to set up several garbage centers along the
rivers and to put railings at river sections in the suburbs to
keep waste out.
</P>
<P>
The city spent nearly 30 million yuan cleaning two major rivers
flowing through the downtown area earlier this year, and since
that time some sections have become good places for local people
to enjoy the coolness of summer.

During the period, exports reached 1.15 billion U.S. dollars,
with imports standing at 1.42 billion U.S. dollars.
Non-traditional product exports grew 14.4 percent as against a
6.3 percent drop in traditional product exports.

The worst falls in exports occurred in textiles (13.4 percent),
leather (8.6 percent), agricultural products (25 percent) and
cattle related products (22 percent) during the period.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, sales in the refrigeration, dairy, chemical,

The Central Bank's figures show that Uruguayan trade was
concentrating more in Mercosur countries, which accounted for 53.6
percent of exports.

<P>
Uruguayan exports to Argentina rose by 65 percent, while those
to Brazil and Paraguay have increased 1.5 percent and 37 percent,

BEIJING, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Highlights of today's major
Beijing-based newspapers are as follows:
</P>
<P>
 "People's Daily"
</P>
<P>
-- Chinese President Jiang Zemin, in a meeting with visiting
Djiboutian President Hassan Gouled Aptidon yesterday, noted that
Sino-Djiboutian relationship has been progressing smoothly despite
changes in international and domestic situations in both countries.
</P>
<P>
Gouled arrived in Beijing on Sunday for a private visit after
spending a week-long vacation in southwest China's Yunnan province.
</P>
<P>
-- China's total number of mobile phone subscribers has doubled
over the past 13 months, with over 20 million Chinese users
accounting for close to 14 percent of GSM (global service for
mobile communication) users worldwide.
</P>
<P>
 "Xinhua Daily Telegraph"
</P>
<P>
-- Li Peng, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress (NPC), and Premier Zhu Rongji have made
phone calls to provincial leaders of Jilin to show their concerns
about flood situation in the northeast.
</P>
<P>
They both urged local flood-fighters to ensure the absolute
safety of the Nenjiang River embankments, the lives of local
people and their property. Li and Zhu are members of the Standing
Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China
(CPC) Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
-- A spokesman for the Ministry of Finance yesterday said the
issuance of the 270 billion yuan in special treasury bonds is
designed to ensure healthy operations of state-owned commercial
banks.
</P>
<P>
He noted that revenues from the issue will be used solely for
replenishing the capital funds of related commercial banks which
are currently burdened with insufficient capital due to rapid
expansion of assets over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
 "China Daily"
</P>
<P>
-- A flood crest on the Nenjiang River in the country's
northernmost Heilongjiang province moved into the mainstream of
the Songhua River yesterday, raising the water level to 120.44
meters, 39 centimeters above the previous record peak at Harbin,
the provincial capital.
</P>
<P>
Floodwater destroyed three sluice gates at Qunli Township, 50
kilometers from Harbin. The Songhua River water flowed backwards
from the 6-meter-wide outlet, inundating a large tract of
saline-alkali land and posing a threat to Harbin Airport.
</P>
<P>
-- China will strive to prevent the spread of epidemic diseases
in the next few months in flood-stricken areas of the country.

<HEADLINE> Eight Americans Die with Help of Mercy-Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Eight Americans of Oregon
state died after obtaining prescriptions for lethal medications
under the state's physician-assisted suicide law, according to
figures released Tuesday by the Oregon Health Division.
</P>
<P>
The report said 10 people got the lethal prescriptions from
their doctors, but two died before they could use them.
</P>
<P>
"All 10 reports received by the division documented full
compliance with the provisions of the act," said Dr. Katrina
Hedberg, an epidemiologist with the division.
</P>
<P>
The division said most of the deaths were between three or four
months ago and that the average age of the patients was 71. Cancer
was the illness in nine cases and heart disease in the other.
</P>
<P>
Oregon's assisted-suicide law, the only one in the United
States, allows a doctor to prescribe a lethal dose of medication
to hasten the death of a terminally ill patient.
</P>
<P>
It sets up several safeguards to make sure the patient is sane,
has less than six months to live, has a terminal diagnosis and is
not forced to ingest the lethal medication. The patient must
request the drugs verbally and in writing.
</P>
<P>
The law was passed in 1994 but was tied up for years in court.
Oregon voters reaffirmed the law in 1997 by soundly defeating a
measure to repeal it. The law went into effect last November.
</P>
<P>
This is the first official figure released by Oregon state,
which waited until it had recorded 10 deaths under the law before
announcing them as a way of protecting the privacy of patients and
their families, Dr. Hedberg said.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, "it would have been too easy to identify an
individual," she explained.

SHANGHAI, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The processing trade sector in
Shanghai reported a 7.5 percent rise in exports to 6.23 billion US
dollars during the first seven months of the year when compared to
the 1997 period, with imports growing by 15.5 percent to 8.7
billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The respective increase rates were down 50 percent down from
that for last year's same period, according to recent statistics
released by the Shanghai Municipal Customs.
</P>
<P>
Wide margin increases for both imports and exports of
electro-mechanical products were recorded for the first seven
months of the year, with a slight increase in exports of low
value-added products and drop in imports of raw materials.
</P>
<P>
Expanded business exchanges with Europe and North America
enabled the municipality to record double-digit growth in foreign
trade.
</P>
<P>
However, the adverse influences of the financial crisis in East
Asia sparked a slight 3.7 percent rise in imports from and even
smaller 2.1 percent jump in exports to Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless the city's total imports grew by five percent to
13.56 billion US dollars during the period, with total exports
rising by 15.6 percent to 19.26 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai also recorded a 15.3 percent rise in the volume of
imported equipment classified as investments by foreign investors,
with related equipment valued at 2.2 billion US dollars. A point
well worth noting is that the State Council issued a circular
earlier this year announcing adjustments to taxation policies
related to imported equipment.
</P>
<P>
Numerous multinational companies have established spare parts
distribution or maintenance centers in Shanghai's Waigaoqiao Free
Trade Zone, with the value of imported goods stored during the
seven months hitting 650 million US dollars, up 70 percent from
the same period last year.

<HEADLINE> Economic Zone Investments Fall in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Investments in Philippine
economic zones fell by 19.7 percent in the first half of this year
to 75.8 billion pesos from the year-ago level of 94.1 billion
pesos, Business World reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
If measured in U.S. dollars, the investments actually dropped
by 105 percent since the value of the peso has fallen by 64
percent from 26.2 pesos per dollar to the current 43 pesos a
dollar.
</P>
<P>
The data from the Philippine Economic Zone Authority reflect
widespread uncertainty arising from the Asian financial crisis
which started last year and fears of a global recession, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Businessman Herman Montenegro, former president of the
Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry, was quoted as saying
that the drop in investments is something business and industry
"definitely expected to happen" because of the currency and
economic turmoil in Asia.
</P>
<P>
He said the decline is no longer a surprise considering that
there is also a common perception of global recession because of
the economic problems in Japan.
</P>
<P>
"I think we've not yet reached the bottom and investments
inflow will continue to drop," he said, adding that he is not
optimistic about 1998 and that there is a common wait-and-see
attitude among businessmen.

<HEADLINE> "El Nino" Phenomenon Is Over in Peru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Sea temperature throughout the
Peruvian sealine are back to normal now, which means that "El
Nino" weather phenomenon is over in Peru, said a director from the
Institute of the Sea (Imarpe).
</P>
<P>
Sea surface temperatures of the current winter season are
within the normal parameters along the Peruvian sealine, said
Imarpe's science director Marco Espino Sanchez.
</P>
<P>
The specialist attributed the cooling-down of sea water to the
normalization of the ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
He said the sea temperature has lowered due to winter's free
circulation of sea currents from Antartica toward the north of the
continent.
</P>
<P>
The immediate benefit from this normalization should be for the
indigenous fishermen and for the industry that processes pelagical
resources like anchovies and sardins.
</P>
<P>
On the presence of the phenomenon known as "La Nina," the
specialist said that there is no precise information on this
phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
He said that "La Nina" has nothing to do with the sea water
cooling-down along the sealine in Peru and that there is no
forecasting of sea ecosystem alteration.

LONDON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Jon Brown renewed his
call for blood-testing to be introduced into athletics at the
European Championships in Budapest.
</P>
<P>
According to local reports on Tuesday, Brown said that the use

spoke out again after finishing fourth in the 10,000 meters final
at the Championships.
</P>
<P>
EPO, the illegal drug which caused this year's Tour de France

gives those taking it similar benefits to altitude training and
is undetectable by current testing methods.

<HEADLINE> Talks Break Down Between Air Canada and Pilots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Conciliation contract talks on
increasing wages between Air Canada and its pilots broke down in
Montreal Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We are charting a course of action right now," said Capt. Jean-Marc
Belanger, chairman of 2,100-member Air Canada Pilots Association.
</P>
<P>
The pilots could be in a legal strike position within two or
three weeks, Belanger told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Belanger said the union and the Montreal-based carrier remained
far apart on nearly all aspects of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The pilots, whose last contract expired on April 21, feel
over-worked and earn 30 to 50 percent less than pilots who fly the
same routes for other major North American carriers.
</P>
<P>
Contract talks began last March but broke down after Air Canada
walked away from the bargaining table, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Air Canada said it is keen to get back to negotiating and still
hopes the labor dispute will be resolved without a strike.

<HEADLINE> Coalition to Terminate, But NZ Govt to Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Jenny Shipley will lead a
National minority government after New Zealand's current coalition
government formed by the National Party and the NZ First is
terminated in seven days.
</P>
<P>
In a media statement, Prime Minister Shipley said that she has
been told that she will receive a letter from NZ First Leader
Winston Peters Wednesday "giving written notice that the coalition
will be terminated in seven days time".
</P>
<P>
But, because of the splitting of NZ First with a number of its
ministers and members of Parliament resigning from the party and
voicing their support to Shipley Tuesday night, The National Party
will be allowed to continue in power as a minority government.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the National Party can count on 62 votes,
including 18 votes from other political parties, in the 120-seat
Parliament on motions of supply and confidence.
</P>
<P>
The latest political instability in the country emerged when
disputes between Shipley, leader of the National Party, and Peters
became public a week ago.
</P>
<P>
On August 12, the then Deputy Prime Minister Peters disregarded
Prime Minister Shipley's advice and "stalked out" of a special
cabinet meeting as a decision was about to be taken on the future
of the government's shareholding in the Wellington International
Airport.
</P>
<P>
The walkout was followed by the dismissal of Peters from the
post of deputy prime minister and treasurer by Shipley, pulling
the governing coalition apart.
</P>
<P>
In her statement, Shipley said that she now enjoys the majority
of MPs support.
</P>
<P>
"I intend to allow the ministers who have come from New Zealand
First to retain their warrants at this stage, until the coalition
is formerly terminated on Wednesday, August 26, in order to
maintain economic and political stability," she said.
</P>
<P>
"Over the coming days I will be giving consideration to future
arrangements," the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
The Dominion, a Wellington-based newspaper, Wednesday quoted
Peters as saying that the split is not "the end for NZ First" and
the remaining NZ First MPs will support a vote of no confidence in
the government.
</P>
<P>
"I intend to get on with the work of rebuilding NZ First," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Annan Invited to Visit Yugoslavia for Fact Finding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia (FRY) has invited U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to
take a trip to the FRY to see what happens there amid the
worsening conflict between the FRY authorities and the ethnic
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
The invitation was conveyed by Charge d'affairs a.i. of FRY
Permanent Mission to the United Nations Vladislav Jovanovic in a
letter dated August 13, in which he said the visit would "allay
future misunderstandings" and help the U.N. obtain a better
picture of the situation there.
</P>
<P>
The letter said: "I take the opportunity to convey the impression
of my Government that much of the misperception of the situation in
Kosovo and the Metohija in the United Nations derives from the
lack of first-hand knowledge of the events taking place on the
ground."
</P>
<P>
The letter charged that Annan's latest report to the U.N.
Security Council on Kosovo "is full of incomplete data and
arbitrary assessments and stands in stark contrast with the
situation on the ground, from which inappropriate inferences are
made."
</P>
<P>
Saying that the "true nature" of the hostilities in Kosovo is
the terrorist attacks of Albanian separatists in Kosovo, the
letter urged the U.N. to "take resolute steps" to prevent the
infiltration of terrorists and weapons across the border of the
FRY.
</P>
<P>
The letter said the FRY is determined to solve the problems in
Kosovo peacefully through dialogue and with respect for the
integrity of Serbia and the FRY.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo, a province of Serbia in the FRY, has an area of some
10,000 square km and a population of over 2 million, 90 percent of
whom are ethnic Albanians, who demand independence. The conflict
since February this year has caused several hundred deaths and
left many homeless.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has no representatives in Kosovo and much of U.N.
information on Kosovo relies on the "Contact Group" including the
United States, Britain, Russia, France, Germany and Italy.

<HEADLINE> IDB Okays $132.8 Mln Loan for Electricity in Brazil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) Tuesday announced the approval of a 132.8
million U.S. dollar loan to help a private company finance the
construction of a gas-powered electricity plant in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
The loan, which will be made directly to AES Uruguaiana
Emprecendimentos Ltda, without government counterguarantees, will
help finance the construction and operation of a 600 MW gas-fired
combined cycle power plant in Uruguaiana, Rio Grande do Sul.
</P>
<P>
The company, owner of the plant, will sell its output to the
three distribution utilities in the state of Rio Grande do Sul
state in southern Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the vast majority of the Brazilian electricity is
generated by hydroelectric sources. But estimates indicate that to
meet demand in the next ten years the country's actual installed
capacity of 57,600 MW will have to be expanded by 50 percent. It
is expected that 15 percent of the new generation will come from
thermal sources. Gas supply from Argentina will also be an
important step toward the fulfilment of economic and energy
integration of the countries of Mercosur, the Southern Cone Common
Market.
</P>
<P>
The IDB financing includes a 75 million dollar loan for IDB's
own account and a 57.8 million dollar loan from a syndicate of
commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the project will be about 350 million
dollars. Apart from the IDB and private investors, the project
also received financial support from the Brazilian Bank for
Economic and Social Development.

<HEADLINE> Museveni Blames Insecurity on Colonialism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni has said the insecurity in the north of the country has
its roots in the bad politics of hatred that characterized the
state from the age of colonialism.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks Tuesday when addressing a
public rally in the northern Kitgum district, Radio Uganda
reported Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
The ruling National Resistance Movement is fighting the
disorientation caused by bad politics through speeding the gospel
of the unity of all Ugandan people, he said.
</P>
<P>
Museveni, who is on a working visit to the north,
promised to guarantee the security of local people by steadily
building up the army, police and other national organs in the
district.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, he had a meeting with the district councilors on
security, social and economic services as well as mobilization.
</P>
<P>
Local leaders said the district is currently peaceful as a
result of mounting pressure on the rebels of Lord's Resistance
Army.
</P>
<P>
Villagers have started agricultural production and rebel
remnants in villages are being tracked down by the security
forces.

<HEADLINE> Greece Disappointed in Turkey's Rejection of No-Fly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Greece Tuesday expressed its
dissatisfaction with neighboring Turkey's rejection of a U.S.
proposal for military flight ban over Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Foreign Press Association here, Greek Deputy
Foreign Minister Yannos Kranidiotis described Turkey's rejection
of such a proposal as "disappointing" even before U.S. envoy for
Cyprus Thomas Miller had set foot in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the U.S. proposal is to halt the planned deployment
of Russian-made S-300 anti-aircraft missiles in Cyprus, which has
been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded and occupied
the northern third of the island in the wake of a failed coup
seeking union with Athens in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's State Minister for Cyprus Affairs Sukru Sina Gurel
said Monday that his country could not accept this kind of a
bargaining regarding the missiles.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the statements made by Gurel, Kranidiotis said
that for the Greek side, the paramount issue was not the
installation of the missiles by the Cypriot government, it was the
occupation by Turkey of the northern part of Cyprus, and it was
the violation of human rights.
</P>
<P>
He said that the deployment of the missiles was not expected
before November, but the matter would be mentioned again when
Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides visits Greece on August 27.
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed that the only path for a de-escalation of
the tension on the divide island republic was to resume the
intercommunal talks and dialogue aimed at a reduction in armaments
on both sides of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Kranidiotis warned that Turkey might be expelled from the
Council of Europe if it did not abide by the decision made by the
European Court of Human Rights concerning the compensation by
Turkey to a Greek-Cypriot woman for her property loss in northern
Cyprus.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Reduces Troops at Embassy in Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. has cut the security
force at its embassy in Albania by more than three-quarters after
the evacuation of nonessential embassy staff, said U.S. President
Bill Clinton on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a letter notifying Congress of the situation, Clinton said
that as of Monday all but 50 of the 200 Marines sent to Tirana on
Sunday had returned to Navy ships in the Adriatic Sea that are
participating in a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
military exercise.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Marines, a team of 10 Navy SEAL commandos
was dispatched to the Rilindja Ridge housing complex in Tirana
where U.S. Embassy business is being conducted until a more secure
permanent embassy is built.
</P>
<P>
Clinton wrote that U.S. authorities had received "credible
information of a possible attack" against the U.S. Embassy in
Tirana similar to the attacks in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es
Salaam, Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The State Department evacuated all nonessential personnel from
the U.S. Embassy in Tirana last Friday, citing a possible
terrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said U.S. military forces will continue to augment
security at Rilindja Ridge "until it is determined that the
additional security support is unnecessary."
</P>
<P>
The State Department said last Friday the embassy might become
the target of an attack by Islamic extremists, who reportedly
vowed to take the revenge for the arrests of Islamists.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that four Islamists were arrested in Albania and
extradited to Egypt last month in operations which have been
conducted with the assistance of the Central Intelligence Agency
(CIA).

<HEADLINE> Russian Gov't Sees 7 Rubles/1 Dollar by Year End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Russian government and central
bank officials have predicted that the ruble's exchange rate will
be seven to the U.S. dollar by the end of the year, a Russian
lawmaker said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Budget Committee of the State Duma, or lower house of
parliament, held a closed session attended by representatives from
the Finance Ministry, the Economics Ministry, the Central Bank,
commercial banks and other institutions, committee chairman
Alexander Zhukov said.
</P>
<P>
The prediction came one day after the government and the
central bank moved to raise the upper limit of the ruble's
exchange corridor to 9.5 to the dollar, up from the original
ceiling of about 6.3.
</P>
<P>
The announcement, which amounts to a devaluation of the
national currency, has prompted many Russians to change their
ruble savings into hard currency or spend them on commodities in
the face of feared price hikes and inflation.
</P>
<P>
Zhukov said the government will make public Wednesday its plan
to restructure the GKO treasury bill debt, the Interfax news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The state budget for fiscal 1999 will also be revised. The
original date for submitting the budget draft, August 25, will be
missed as the revision would take about a month.
</P>
<P>
However, government officials told the lawmakers that there was
no need to amend the 1998 budget because inflation stayed within
the range allowed for in it, Zhukov said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Budget Committee will hold an open meeting
Wednesday to draft a resolution for the State Duma to debate at
its extraordinary session Friday.
</P>
<P>
The draft will give an evaluation of Russia's financial and
economic situation as well as a list of steps that the government
should do to tackle the problems, he added.

<HEADLINE> Striking Kenyan Bank Employees Resume Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Normal banking services resumed
across Kenya Tuesday after the strike by 12,000 unionizable staff
fizzled out with the reinstatement of most of the workers.
</P>
<P>
The reinstated workers have to comply with the employers'
condition of re-application and a six-month probation period,
reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya Commercial, Standard Chartered and Barclays banks
branches in Nairobi operated fully throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the All Banks Shopstewards Committee, led by
Chairman Jacob Opiyo, went round the banks, asking workers to heed
the Central Organization of Trade Union (COTU)'s decision to
return to work pending a resolution of the contentious tax on
low-interest staff loans.
</P>
<P>
"On our side it is all over and workers are now going back to
their respective working stations as we await the outcome of the
issue," Opiyo said.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, COTU asked workers to return to work and demanded
that the employers allow them to resume.
</P>
<P>
However, the 52-member Kenya Banks (Employers) Association
stood by their decision to accept workers "who humbled themselves
to ask for re-employment".
</P>
<P>
"Workers must know that in industrial relations there is no
hide and seek," said the association's executive officer Raphael
Chubi.
</P>
<P>
Juma Mwiru, Manager of Corporate Affairs of the Standard
Chartered Bank, said 98 percent of the sacked workers beat the
August 15 re-application deadline.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Federal Reserve Keeps Interest Rates Steady </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Reserve
policy-makers Tuesday decided to keep short-term interest rates
unchanged in view of economic crises in Asia, and also new
troubles in Russia.
</P>
<P>
The Fed's monetary policy panel, the Federal Open Market
Committee, concluded a nearly four-hour close-door meeting Tuesday
by indicating it had made no change in the benchmark rate on
overnight loans between banks. It's been steady at 5.5 percent
since March 1997, when policy-makers raised it a
quarter-percentage point.
</P>
<P>
The Fed is much more concerned about the robust economic growth
and labor shortages as well as eventually accelerating wages that
could lead to higher inflation. But inflation has remained well
tamed, and clear evidence of a pick-up in prices has yet to
emerge.
</P>
<P>
The Fed decided at its last meeting, June 30-July 1, to hold
the short-term interest rates unchanged.

<HEADLINE> SADC to Offer Assistance to Congo (K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Defense ministers of the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) agreed Tuesday to
offer any form of assistance they can to help bring peace and
stability to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, who chairs the SADC organ
on politics, defense and security, told reporters after a
briefing by the ministers that the SADC would respond
positively to DRC President Laurent Kabila's requests
for assistance to help restore peace in his country.
</P>
<P>
Nine of the 14 SADC countries were represented at the meeting.
However, defense ministers and other representatives were not
briefed by a verification team of foreign ministers from
Zimbabwe, Angola, Tanzania and Namibia.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers had been in central Africa studying the
situation on the ground and trying to substantiate Kabila's
allegations that the revolt that started on August 2 was backed
by Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said it is in the interests of the region
that SADC countries agreed to assist the DRC with support as
a matter of urgency.
</P>
<P>
Kabila, who ousted former leader Mobutu Sese Seko in May last
year, is facing a revolt from the minority Tutsis which
he alleged as being led by his former allies, Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
"The matter is a very urgent one and we shall treat it with
that sense of urgency," said Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to respond positively in a manner that will help
the government of President Laurent Kabila restore peace and
stability as he and we would want to see prevail in the DRC,"
added the Zimbabwean president.
</P>
<P>
Zambia's Defense Minister Chitalu Sampa, who chaired the
ministers meeting, said all SADC countries are going to assist
Kabila in his efforts to thwart the rebellion.

<HEADLINE> Responses Differ to Clinton Confession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
got different responses from key Republicans and Democrats to
his Monday televised confession of an affair with an intern.
</P>
<P>
Speaker Newt Gingrich of the House of Representatives,
commenting on Clinton's address on Monday, said he could not judge
Clinton until he sees Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's report.
</P>
<P>
"I think everyone would be best served if they would wait for
Judge Starr's report to find out what all the facts are," news
reports quoted Gingrich as saying after a ribbon-cutting ceremony
at a new MCI facility in Alpharetta, about 30 kilometers north of
Atlanta, Georgia.
</P>
<P>
In a testimony to a federal grand jury on Monday and later in a
brief speech, Clinton said he had an inappropriate relationship
with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich said it was too early to know whether a motion to
impeach the president would make its way out of the House
Judiciary Committee. Starr is expected to report his findings to
the committee in weeks.
</P>
<P>
The Republicans control both houses of Congress, where any
attempt at impeachment would be decided.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say Democrats are worried the scandal will damage
their chances at congressional elections in November. The
Republicans are reluctant to let Clinton off the hook but they
know that public opinion does not favor any attempt to drive the
president out of office.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, House Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt, who is
vacationing in Europe, said in a statement, "It is my most fervent
hope for the nation that this investigation can be brought to its
long overdue conclusion and that in the days ahead, the Congress
and the president can pour our energies into a meaningful agenda
for the country."
</P>
<P>
Lee Hamilton, a Democrat, said he thought Democratic support
for Clinton would survive unless Starr came up with evidence of
further evidence of misconduct.
</P>
<P>
"All of us are disappointed. None of us approves of what he
did. But that doesn't mean at this point that the Democrats are
going to walk away," he told CNN.
</P>
<P>
Representative Martin Frost, a Texas Democrat, said it would be
a mistake for Republicans to keep using Clinton's affair with
Lewinsky as a partisan political issue.
</P>
<P>
"The American people want Congress to work on public policy
issues. A real debate this fall on issues like the failure of
Social Security and education reform is far more important to
average Americans than continued prying into the private life of
the President," he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
But some Republicans showed no sign they would be willing to
let Clinton off, after he had denied for seven months that he did
have a sexual relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's public statement is "just the latest in a series of
deceptions and half-truths that have characterized this president
and his administration," said Senator Dan Coats, a Republican.
</P>
<P>
"The honorable course of action would be to resign. Failure to
do so subjects the American people to the continued national
trauma of a severely compromised presidency," he added.

<HEADLINE> Greek Police Launch Manhunt for 22 Escaped Prisoners </HEADLINE>

<P>
ATHENS, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Greek police Tuesday continued
its intensive manhunt throughout the Attica prefecture for the 22
prisoners still at large.
</P>
<P>
The 41 prisoners, 40 Albanians and a Romanian national, escaped
from the Avlona juvenile detention center in northern Athens
Sunday night, but 19 of them have been recaptured by police.
</P>
<P>
Greek Justice Minister Evangelos Yianopoulos blamed prison
guards for the mass escape.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, tension rose Tuesday at the prison remand center in
Chania, Crete, when 32 Albanian inmates refused to return to their
cells in protest at what they claimed was ill treatment from Greek
prisoners at the facility.

<HEADLINE> S. African Ministers Begin Diplomatic Mission to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 18 (Xinhua) -- South African Foreign
Minister Alfred Nzo and Defense Minister Joe Modise Tuesday began
their diplomatic mission in the Great Lakes region, South African
Press Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
They were in the region for talks with the governments of
Rwanda and Uganda, which were accused by Laurent Kabila,
president of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), of
backing rebel uprisings in his country.
</P>
<P>
The mission was aimed at "working out with our partners what
we must do to achieve a ceasefire and create conditions for a
political solution in the Congo," South African Deputy Foreign
Minister Aziz Pahad was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
After talks with the Rwandan government officials, Nzo and
Modise would head to Kampala, capital of Uganda, for discussions
with the Ugandan authorities, he said.
</P>
<P>
"There's a very serious crisis developing in that part of our
continent. There are accusations and counter-accusations.
</P>
<P>
"Our delegation is part of the overall effort by our region to
find a political solution to the crisis," said Pahad.
</P>
<P>
Nzo and Modise, who held talks with Kabila on August 7 in his
southern stronghold of Lubumbashi, would discuss the invasion
allegations as well as broader problems in that region.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's consultations would feed into similar efforts
by a committee set up in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe on August 8,
comprising ministers from Zimbabwe, Zambia, Namibia and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully this will lead to a collective coordinated approach
to deal with the problem," noted the deputy foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Pahad said that South Africa did not believe a military
solution was possible.
</P>
<P>
"We must seek a political solution and we will do everything
possible to do that."
</P>
<P>
"We don't want a whole new surge of ethnic hatred or ethnic
violence erupting," he said.
</P>
<P>
Regarding Kabila's request for South African aid, including
military assistance to quell the uprisings, Pahad said: "We have
very strict regulations in terms of which we can supply military
equipment."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, defense ministers from Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe
were meeting in Harare, Zimbabwe, Tuesday to discuss the crisis,
as members of the Victoria Falls committee arrived in the DRC
rebel stronghold of Goma to probe whether there had been a
foreign invasion, as claimed by Kabila.
</P>
<P>
The committee has already met Kabila in Kinshasa, and Rwandan
Vice-President and Defense Minister Paul Kagame in Kigali.
</P>
<P>
The Harare meeting has fueled speculation that Kabila has
asked his southern neighbors for military assistance, as claimed
after his weekend talks with Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos
Santos.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats said Kabila had sought Angolan air support,
Zimbabwean troops and Namibian logistical support, according to
SAPA.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Extends Gains, Dow up Almost 140 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 18 (Xinhua) -- New York stocks rose sharply
for a second straight day, with the Dow Jones industrial average
gaining 139.80 points in active trading today to close at
8,714.65.
</P>
<P>
The Dow was up almost 150 points on Monday. With today's gains,
it has extended its rebound to about 400 points from the low point
of last Tuesday's selloff. At its low point last week, the Dow was
threatening to fall below 8,300, down more than 1,000 points from
its July 17 record close of 9,337.97.
</P>
<P>
Broader indicators also rose today, with technology stocks
leading the way.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 17.53 to 1,101.20, and the
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 37.06 to 1,855.10.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2-to-1 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with NYSE volume totaling 682.81
million shares, up from 581.55 million on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE composite index rose 8.04 to 552.03, and the American
Stock Exchange composite index rose 6.75 to 670.02.
</P>
<P>
The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 7.33 to 411.29.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 17.53 to 1,101.20, and the
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 37.06 to 1,855.10.
</P>
<P>
A Federal Reserve Board decision this afternoon leaving
interest rates unchanged was widely expected and had little impact
on trading.
</P>
<P>
Stocks also got a lift from rallies in major markets abroad,
with big gains today in Japan, Germany and Britain.

<HEADLINE> Bullish Day for European Stock Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- European shares saw the bull
coming back on Tuesday, as major markets enjoyed a sharp rise,
apparently relieved from Russia's devaluation of the rouble.
</P>
<P>
London came up with a record one-day point gain, following the
bullish trend in Europe and on Wall Street. The FTSE 100 chalked
up a 181-point advance to close at 5648.2, eclipsing the
160.8-point rise of last September.
</P>
<P>
Stocks traded in the black for the whole session, as the
concerns which had dogged the market of late faded one after
another.
</P>
<P>
But Tuesday's rise of 3.3 percent by the FTSE 100 was only the
ninth biggest in percentage terms, well adrift of the 7.32 percent
record rise of October 21 1987.
</P>
<P>
Russia's troubles moved into the background, while Japanese
issues had moved higher overnight to complete the supportive
picture, according to market analysts.
</P>
<P>
Figures released earlier today showed UK's underlying inflation
move closer to the government's 2.5 percent target rate, which led
some economists to state that interest rates have now peaked.
</P>
<P>
"We've seen a lot of business this afternoon," said one senior
equities dealer. "I think we are in for a settled period now, at
least until the end of the week."
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, the X-Dax closed up a whopping 170.12 points at
5602.15 - boosted by another show of strength on Wall Street, a
surge in Deutsche Telekom and renewed interest in Viag and Adidas,
as selective buying gave recent underperformers the benefit of the
doubt.
</P>
<P>
The Paris' bourse delivered good gains, too, with the CAC-40
closing at 4123.25, up 139.44 points.
</P>
<P>
However, traders said CAC's rally is more a technical rebound
than a strong change in sentiment, after shares had fallen steeply
on Monday in thin trading.

<HEADLINE> Clintons Head for Island Vacation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton,
his wife and his daughter Tuesday left here for vacation on
Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
Before the family departed, Hillary Rodham Clinton released a
statement in which she stood by her husband.
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, this is not the best day in Mrs. Clinton's life,"
press secretary Marsha Berry said. "This is a time that she relies
on her strong religious faith. She's committed to her marriage and
loves her husband and daughter very much and believes in the
president, and her love for him is compassionate and steadfast.
She clearly is uncomfortable with her personal life being made so
public but is looking forward to going on vacation with her family
and having some family time together."
</P>
<P>
Berry said Mrs. Clinton learned the nature of the president's
testimony over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
In almost two weeks away from Washington, aides said the
president would forgo some of his social calendar and beloved golf
to make good on his promise to the nation "to move on" and get
back to work. The family was staying at the secluded island
compound at Oyster Pond where they have vacationed for three
summers, news reports said.
