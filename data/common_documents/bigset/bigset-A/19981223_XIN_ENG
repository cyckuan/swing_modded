<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 22 (Xinhua) - Over 100 U.N. humanitarian
workers Tuesday left Amman for Baghdad as required by the U.N.
following the end of U.S.-led air attacks on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. spokesman said in a brief statement in Amman that the
U.N. workers were from nine U.N. organizations, including the
World Food Program, U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, the
World Health Organization, the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the United Nations
International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) and other
institutions.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. workers, who had been based in Baghdad, were evacuated
to Amman last week after the U.S. and British forces launched the
air attacks on Baghdad for Iraq's alleged non-cooperation with
U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian-Iraqi border remained the only land exit from
Iraq due to the non-fly zones imposed by the U.S.-led
multi-national forces after the 1991 Gulf war.

<HEADLINE> 8 Lebanese Killed in Israeli Air raids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Eight Lebanese civilians,
including one woman and her six children, were killed Tuesday in
Israeli two air raids on suspected Lebanese guerrillas targets in
Lebanon's eastern town of Belbek.
</P>
<P>
The Voice of the People radio said that the woman and her
children were killed when an air-to-surface missile an Israeli
warplane fired landed on a farm near Belbek, while the children's
father narrowly escaped the attack.
</P>
<P>
Following the incident, the casualties were rushed to Imam
Humain Hospital in the town, but the dead bodies which have been
blown up into pieces could not be identified, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God,
said another civilian called Ali Ihammed was also killed in the
Israeli air raid, which also left four civilians wounded.
</P>
<P>
In Jerusalem, Israeli army confirmed the attack, saying its
warplanes blasted Hezbollah's bases in Lebanon's eastern area
and returned safely to its bases.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a self-declared security zone in south
Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north
from cross-border attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been fighting against Israeli occupation.

<HEADLINE> Iran, Azerbaijan Underline Closer Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Majlis (parliament)
Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq Nouri Tuesday called for further expansion
of relations and cooperation with Azerbaijan in all dimensions.
</P>
<P>
Nouri made the call in talks with his visiting Azeri
counterpart Murtuz Aleskerov.
</P>
<P>
Nouri said "all Iranian officials believe in expansion of the
relations with the friendly and brotherly country of Azerbaijan
in all dimensions."
</P>
<P>
He said the commonalities shared by Iran and Azerbaijan will
serve as a suitable ground for mutual cooperation and closer
relations between the two countries, the Islamic Republic News
Agency (IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
However, Nouri warned that certain people and some segments of
the press are doing mischief to mar the amicable relations
between Tehran and Baku. He called on Azeri and Iranian officials
to be vigilant and deal toughly with such conspiracies.
</P>
<P>
He also underlined the need for further cooperation between
Iran and Azerbaijan at international level with an aim to attain
common objectives.
</P>
<P>
Iran's policy is based on tension-easing and establishment of
peace and stability in the region and the world, the speaker said,
adding that Iran is interested in peaceful settlement of
Nagorno-Karabakh dispute between Azerbaijan and Armenia.
</P>
<P>
Azerbaijan and Armenia were fighting for the control of the
Nagorno-Karabakh, a enclave within the border of Azerbaijan
predominantly inhabited by Armenians.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Nouri said the Caspian Sea belongs to its five
littoral states, which should unanimously work out a fair legal
regime for exploitation of the sea's reserves.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that any agreement between two littoral states
will create problems rather than solve anything.
</P>
<P>
Among the five littoral states, Russia and Iran favor a common
share of the resources of the Caspian while Azerbaijan,
Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan prefer the sea to be divided on
national basis.
</P>
<P>
Aleskerov, who arrived here Monday night, said that Iran is the
first country to open embassy in Baku after officially recognizing
its independence.
</P>
<P>
The two countries share common cultural and religious bonds, he
said, calling on Iran to expand its economic relations with
Azerbaijan and make investment in the republic.

<P>
TEHRAN, December 22 (Xinhua) -- More than 3.6 million tonnes of
steel have been produced in the first eight months of this
Iranian year to end March 20, 1999, a senior Iranian official
announced on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy head of the National Iranian Steel Company Mousa Aqaie
Lankarani told the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) that the
output was 87 percent of the target for the period.
</P>
<P>
Out of the total 3.6 million tonnes of processed steel, hot
rolled sheets account for 30 percent, iron bars for 32 percent,
rods for 22 percent, cold rolled sheets for 14 percent and other
steel products for 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Isfahan Steel Mill ranked the first by producing more than 1.3
million tonnes of processed steel while Mobarakeh Steel Complex
stood the second with an output of 1.1 million tonnes.
</P>
<P>
Iran had expected to produce some 6.7 million tonnes of steel
and to export 1.5 million tonnes during the current Iranian
year, officials said earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
The Minister of Mines and Metals Eshaq Jahangiri said
last month that Iran's annual steel output could reach
six million tonnes by the end of this Iranian year and steel
production is projected to touch 12 million tonnes annually by
the year 2002.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Residents of Maseru, the
capital of Lesotho, have been urged to work together to rebuild
their city, Southern African Broadcasting Association (SABA)
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Mohau Kobile, mayor of Maseru, was quoted as saying that all
people in the country should have a spirit of development, and
work to lead Lesotho into a brighter future.
</P>
<P>
The mayor said that the Maseru City Council had made
preparations to work hard in the new year.
</P>
<P>
Most of businesses and residential houses in Maseru were
burned down during political disturbances on September 22.
</P>
<P>
More than 40 people were killed in the political unrest which
started on August 4.
</P>
<P>
Trouble in the mountainous kingdom followed the opposition's
rejection of the May general elections, in which the ruling
Lesotho Congress of Democracy (LCD) was accused of rigging in its
own favor.
</P>
<P>
The conflict worsened after soldiers rebelled and arrested
their officers, accusing the government of failing to check the
violent protests which followed.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili had to call for help
from the Southern African Development Community (SADC), and was
bailed out by South African and Botswanan troops.
</P>
<P>
The rebelling Lesotho Defense Force soldiers later surrendered
to the intervention forces after weeks of burning, fighting and
looting.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Despite widespread public
doubt, Lithuania has abolished death penalty, Interfax reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Under amendments to the criminal code passed Monday evening by
the Lithuanian parliament the capital punishment will be replaced
by life imprisonment for very serious crimes.
</P>
<P>
Public reaction to the abolition is mixed in the face of
growing crimes in the Baltic country. Polls found that about 70-80
percent of the public find it premature, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
The abolition was initiated by President Valdas Adamkus after
the Constitutional Court ruled that death sentences contradicted
the constitution.
</P>
<P>
The parliament also passed a law commuting the sentence of the
country's nine inmates to life imprisonment.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The state-owned
Tanzania Cotton Lint and Seed Board (TCLSB) has discovered nine
companies and a cooperative society illegally exporting cotton to
neighboring Kenya.
</P>
<P>
TCLSB General Manager Ali Ngongolo revealed here Tuesday that
the illegal exports have denied the board 7,984,656 Shillings
(about 11,800 U.S. Dollars) of revenue.
</P>
<P>
Ngongolo claimed that Dan P. Makaranga, Mara Oil Mill, Copcot
Cotton, S and G Ginning Company, Virian (T) Limited, Bibiti Oil
Ltd, and Nyanza Cooperative Union (NCU) have involved themselves
in illicit deals this year.
</P>
<P>
Other companies that have violated export regulations in the
year include Birchand Ltd, Rift Valley and Cream Cotton, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ngongolo noted that a total of 6,161 bales of cotton have been
sent to Kenya through Siari and other border stations without the
permission of his board and it is not known how such a big
consignment could cross the border.
</P>
<P>
The board has directed these companies and the NCU to get
necessary permits and pay levy, otherwise legal action will be
taken against them.
</P>
<P>
According to the general manager, exporters of cotton are
obliged to get export permits as well as certificates of quality
from the board.
</P>
<P>
He also said that investigations concerning other border
stations will continue.

<HEADLINE> Russian Duma Stops Considering START Ratification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Russia's top legislator said
Tuesday that the State Duma has closed debates on ratifying the
START II treaty in the aftermath of the military strikes on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"The militaristic action against Iraq, conducted in the
immediate proximity to the southern borders of the Commonwealth of
Independent States, should seriously prompt the strengthening of
the defense capability of not only Russia but the CIS as a
whole," said Gennady Seleznyov, speaker of the State Duma, or
lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
"We must start developing our common defense doctrine so that
in the future no one could have illusions about the possibility of
knocking us off one by one," Seleznyov's spokesman Mikhail Belyat
quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the United Nations to immediately start an
inquiry into the activity of Richard Butler as head of the U.N.
Special Commission on Iraq (UNSCOM), and dismiss him from office.
</P>
<P>
"Butler's mission was quite reminiscent of a spying mission,
however, the U.N. commission cannot and must not fulfill an
assignment from the CIA or the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff,"
Seleznyov said.
</P>
<P>
He called on the U.N. Security Council to speak up on the
issue. "One cannot keep silent or make it look as if nothing
extraordinary has taken place without harming his own prestige."
</P>
<P>
Russia and the United States signed START II in 1993, and the
U.S. Senate ratified it in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Many deputies of the State Duma believe that the pact could
weaken Russia's security and would be too expensive to implement.
</P>
<P>
Under the treaty, both countries will cut their nuclear
arsenals in half to about 3,000 to 3,500 warheads each.
</P>
<P>
Russian military officials say many of the country's nuclear
weapons are nearing the end of their service life and will have to
be dismantled in any case.

</P>
<P>
The call was made Tuesday by Third Deputy Prime Minister and

At the consultative meeting, he announced that four regional
and national seminars will be held for all stake-holders in

<HEADLINE> 3 Ugandans Lynched for Robbing Trader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Three people including a
police branch detective have been lynched by an enraged mob at
Mukono district, 30 kms east of Kampala, following a robbery of
40 million Shillings (40,000 U.S. Dollars) from a coffee trader.
</P>
<P>
The detective attached to Katwe Police Station with four
others waylaid the coffee trader Monday at Kisoga Lugogomo
village while returning from Greenland Bank, said a press release
issued Tuesday afternoon by the Police Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The robbers traveling in a white Toyota Carina caused a
collision with the vehicle of the trader and in the scuffle that
ensued the robbers put the trader and his driver at gun point and
took away the money, ignition key and mobile phone, the press
release added.
</P>
<P>
As the robbers took off with their loots, they were blocked by
the mob at a village.  The robbers then opened fire and injured
two people and the mob later overpowered the robbers and lynched
three of them.
</P>
<P>
Inspector-General of Police John Cossy Odomel was quoted as
saying that he regretted the involvement of the detective in the
robbery, reiterating management determination to rid the force of
such personnel.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Students Protest Against Airstrikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 22 (Xinhua) -- More than one thousand
students at Lebanon's public and private universities Tuesday
staged a protest against the U.S.-led airstrikes on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Amid tight security measures around the U.S. embassy in east
Beirut, students gathered around the fortress-like compound,
chanting anti-U.S. slogans and setting the U.S. flags on fire.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration, the first ever in the country in five years,
came one day after the newly formed cabinet lifted the ban on
street protests.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon imposed a ban on demonstrations after nine people were
killed in clashes between troops and demonstrators who protested
the 1993 Oslo Agreement.
</P>
<P>
Students denounced the airstrikes launched by U.S. and British
forces last week and demanded the shutting down of the
U.S. embassy in Beirut.
</P>
<P>
During the protest, Lebanese security forces kept some
distance between the angry students and the embassy in order to
avert protests similar to those in Syria last week, during which
demonstrators broke into the U.S. embassy and removed the
U.S. flag from the top of the building.
</P>
<P>
Similar demonstrations were also held in front of the British
embassy in east Beirut, whose service offices were closed during
the day for security reasons, an embassy official said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and British forces launched airstrikes against Iraq
under the pretext of Iraqi incomplete cooperation with
U.N. weapons inspection team, which is charged with disarming
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
At least 62 Iraqi soldiers were killed and another 180 wounded
during the four-day air raids.

<HEADLINE> WHO: More Time Needed to Obtain Evidence on War-Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) said here Tuesday that it would be unreasonable to expect
accurate data by 1999 at the earliest to support Iraqi allegations
that shells with depleted uranium increased incidents of cancer
and leukaemia in the country.
</P>
<P>
"During the Gulf War (1990-1991) the military is reported to
have used depleted uranium for shell casings as a hardening agent.
This has resulted in radiation exposure in the battle zones in the
south of the country," said WHO.
</P>
<P>
"As a result, local health authorities report increase in the
occurrence of many health conditions, including growth
retardation, congenital malformations, abortion, infertility,
myxoedema, cataract, uraemia and cancer," it said. "Of immediate
concern is the reported increase in frequency of leukaemia in
reports to the central registry from the southern governorates."
</P>
<P>
Upon the request of the Ministry of Health of Iraq, a WHO
mission visited the country from August 9 to 13, 1998 to evaluate
the cancer registration system and the implication of the use of
depleted uranium and to make recommendations for future
developments.
</P>
<P>
The recommendations made by the team include measures to
upgrade the central population-based registry in Baghdad,
establishing a second registry in Basra, in addition to the one
functioning in Mosul, and strengthening active data collection.
</P>
<P>
"WHO is seeking the resources needed to strengthen research and
treatment of emerging diseases such as leukaemia and cancers,"
said WHO. "The objective is to establish with the Iraqi Health
Ministry a capacity to deal with the surveillance, prevention and
treatment of cancer and other emerging diseases."

<HEADLINE> Estonian Transport Workers to Boycott Finnish Cargo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The Estonian transport workers
plan to declare a boycott on Finnish cargo ships, an Estonian
newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Juri Lember, chairman of the Confederation of Estonian
Transport Workers' Union, told the Postimees that the action would
be taken in response to the boycott of Estonian ships declared by
the Finnish transport workers' unions, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
"There is almost no doubt this action will go ahead," Lember
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Finnish ships will be treated the same way as
Estonian ships are treated in Finland - they will not be loaded or
unloaded.
</P>
<P>
"In accordance with Estonian laws, this measure can be applied
for three days," Lember said.
</P>
<P>
The row started at the beginning of December, when the Finnish
union of transport workers refused to unload Estonian ships,
saying that the Estonian sailors' wages were too low.
</P>
<P>
On December 15, the Finnish transport workers were joined by
dockers of the Danish port of Orhus.
</P>
<P>
In the opinion of the Estonian sea shipping line, the Finnish
and Danish boycott is aimed at forcing Estonia out of the
Helsinki-Muugas (Estonia)-Orhus line operated by the Finnish
company Finncarriers.
</P>
<P>
The Estonian shipping line has sent a letter to the Helsinki
district court urging it to suspend the boycott of Estonian ships
pending the investigation into its legality, Interfax said.

<P>
ATHENS, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Greece and Romania Tuesday
agreed to strengthen military cooperation between the two
countries following the talks between Greek Defense Minister Akis
Tsohatzopoulos and his visiting Romanian counterpart, Victor
Babiuc.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed to expand their cooperation in the sector of
armaments, the defense industry, military training and periodic
meetings of officials of the respective ministries for monitoring
progress, according to the semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA).
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the two ministers also expressed concern
about the situation in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo, saying
that if peace talks between parties concerned did not begin by the
end of winter, the tension in the region would be intensified in
March.
</P>
<P>
As for the recent air strikes launched jointly by the U.S. and
Britain against Iraq, Babiuc said that the use of force should
always be "a last resort" for resolving problems.
</P>
<P>
Solutions should result from compromise through peaceful means,
he added.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian minister invited Greece and the U.S. to
participate in cooperation among the countries of the Black Sea
region as well as among the armed forces of the region.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Arab League (AL) Secretary
General Esmat Abdel-Meguid Tuesday called for world efforts to
reach a peaceful solution to the Iraqi crisis.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid made the call in his messages to U.N. chief Kofi
Annan and Chinese, French and Russian foreign ministers, Egypt's
Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He urged the world community to stress the stance on rejecting
the use of force in dealing with international relations.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain launched four days of air strikes on Iraq
last week to retaliate what U.S. President Bill Clinton said
Baghdad's defiance of the U.N. arms inspections.
</P>
<P>
China, Russia and the AL have denounced the air raids.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid underlined the need for the U.N. Security Council
to shoulder its responsibilities through a new mechanism for
monitoring Iraq's weapons program.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid said a new mechanism should be assigned to
provide confidence, solve pending issues between Iraq and the
U.N., ensure the implementation of relevant U.N. resolutions and
expedite the lifting of the crippling economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The existing mechanism for weapons inspections in Iraq is the
U.N. Special Commission which Iraq has accused of serving the
interests of the United States and Britain only.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid also stressed that Iraq's sovereignty, unity and
territorial integrity must be respected.

<HEADLINE> Kyrgyz Probe Continues on Corruption in Finance Ministry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Kyrgyz Interior Minister
Omurbek Kutuyev said Tuesday that the probe into alleged
corruption and embezzlement in the Finance Ministry is continuing.
</P>
<P>
Kutuyev told lawmakers that charges of embezzlement, fraud and
corruption had been brought against detained ministry officials.
About 35 such facts have been checked, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kyrgyz Prosecutor-General Asanbek Sharshenaliyev said that if
the corruption charges are not confirmed, the cases will be
closed.
</P>
<P>
He said a task force combating corruption plans to detain and
bring charges against several more state officials. He did not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Talaibek Koichumanov has sharply condemned the
arrest of Finance Ministry officials, saying the announcement of
an indictment prior to a court decision is a gross violation of
human rights.
</P>
<P>
He also accused law-enforcement officers of blackmailing and
slandering the defendants.
</P>
<P>
"A good initiative to combat corruption, advanced by the
president, has been discredited," Koichumanov said.
</P>
<P>
"The Finance Ministry is not guilty of anything," the minister
claimed.
</P>
<P>
The former Soviet republic has stepped up its fight against
corruption in recent months.
</P>
<P>
Hot lines are being installed in the country to handle
complaints about corrupt officials, Shirshenaliyev, the
prosecutor-general announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
Shirshenaliyev heads the Coordinating Council Against
Corruption and Economic Crime, a task force created by President
Askar Akayev on December 19.
</P>
<P>
The council, which includes representatives of security and law
enforcement structures, tax agencies, customs structures and the
prosecutor's office, will take steps to tighten the struggle
against corruption, Shirshenaliyev said.
</P>
<P>
Government comptrollers and the Presidential Administration
will be assisting the council, he said.
</P>
<P>
The new structure will control the investigation of all
corruption charges in the country, the prosecutor said.
</P>
<P>
He said 383 officials had been dismissed over the past five
years on charges of corruption. The majority of crimes involving
abuse of office were committed by low-level rather than by senior
officials, Shirshenaliyev said.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait's Parliament Passes Bill on Expatriates' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait's parliament
Tuesday approved a bill on health insurance for expatriates,
ending the era of free medical services for foreigners.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which is aimed at imposing charges on state-run
services, was passed by a vote of 35-1, with two abstentions in
the first reading.
</P>
<P>
The bill said a expatriate cannot obtain a residence permit
unless having a health insurance certificate or a health insurance
contract.
</P>
<P>
The parliament allows the Health Ministry to word its
regulations within a year.
</P>
<P>
The welfare state Kuwait, with expatriates accounting for
nearly 81 percent of its 2.1 million people, provided free medical
services to both its citizens and foreign residents.
</P>
<P>
But the dramatical fall of state revenues arising from the
sagging oil prices in recent years have forced the government to
cut spending to contain the inflating state budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's Health Minister Adel Al-Subeih said last September
that the current budget will not meet the Health Ministry's
requirements.
</P>
<P>
Adel pointed out the proposed health insurance system is not a
revenue-booster for the ministry, just an alleviation to its
burden.
</P>
<P>
Under the system, each expatriate will be obliged to pay 50-70
Kuwaiti dinars (165-230 U.S. dollars) in insurance premium per
year.

WASHINGTON, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The United States on
Tuesday said it might agree to expand oil-for-food program for
Iraq if a humanitarian report proved there was a greater need for
food.
</P>

"Oil-for-food... would be the one area where we could see

</P>
<P>
"I think that there's a possibility out there of expanding it
if the (U.N.) secretary general and his experts believe there is a
need for expansion," he added.
</P>
<P>
Pickering noted that with the decline in the world price of
oil, Iraq could not buy as much food at the same export level.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Opposed to Lift Sanctions against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The United States opposes
any effort to lift economic sanctions against Iraq and
would use its veto power in the U.N. Security Council to keep
them in place, the White House said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We certainly oppose any effort to dismantle the sanctions
regime and if it meant using our veto, we would," White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He also said U.N. weapons inspectors should be allowed to
continue their work in Iraq if they could be allowed to operate
effectively.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that an effective UNSCOM is the best way to
contain Saddam Hussein's ability to reconstitute and deliver his
weapons of mass destruction," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council is assessing its Iraq policies after
four days of air strikes by the United States and Britain. Iraq
has rejected any return of weapons inspectors and is calling for
an end to sweeping sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. weapons inspectors left Baghdad last Wednesday just
hours before the air strikes began.
</P>
<P>
France and Germany have suggested trying to find a new
approach to controlling Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, which
could lead to an easing of economic sanctions.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Govt Asks U.N. to Save Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government issued
a statement Tuesday, blaming the international community for the
recent armed conflicts in central Angola.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it called on the United Nations Security Council to
take up firmer stand against the opposition National Union for
the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) to save the peace
process from the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The statement, approved by the Standing Committee of Angola'
Ministerial Meeting, accused UNITA of refusing to comply with
relevant terms stipulated in the Lusaka Protocol and of engaging
in building its army and purchasing large number of advanced
weapons from abroad.
</P>
<P>
However, it said, the U.N. observer mission turned a blind eye
to this situation and paid no attention to the government report
in this regard which leads to the re-arm of UNITA and putting the
southern African country on the brink of an all-out civil war.
</P>
<P>
The statement appreciated the position taken by the Southern
African Development Community which had announced UNITA Chairman
Jonas Savimbi as a "war criminal" and that talks with the
patriotic UNITA Renovation Committee is the only way to end the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government urged the U.N. to accept the stand and
give up its illusions on Savimbi in a bid to achieve real and
lasting peace in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the government called on the army, national police
and all peace-loving people to be mobilized and destroy Savimbi's
war machines.
</P>
<P>
Since mid-November, the government army clashed heatedly with
UNITA forces in central Huambo and Bie provinces. The former
rebel movement which had been equipped with tanks, armored
carriers, long-range cannons and ground-to-air missiles forced
the government army to retreat in defeat several times and have
to hold on to the two capital cities of Huambo and Kuito.
</P>
<P>
UNITA's powerful war facilities have been a surprise to the
government which in turn voiced its dissatisfaction with the
inefficient supervision of the U.N. mission.
</P>
<P>
Angola's Deputy Foreign Minister Joao Miranda said earlier
that the government is considering the withdrawal of U.N.
observers mission from the country.

<HEADLINE> President Jiang Calls for Action to Prevent Unstability (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese president Jiang Zemin
warned today that if certain social and economic problems were not
tackled without delay, the overall stability of the country could
be threatened.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, also general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party
Central Committee, said that the economic returns of a number of
state-owned enterprises are not good, the army of redundant
workers is growing and they have difficulties in their life, and
that farmers in certain rural areas have seen their income
dwindling and their financial burdens are increasing. And in some
parts of the country people are complaining about the rising crime
rate.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the concluding session of a national conference
focused on China's political and legal frameworks, the Chinese
leader said 1999 will be of great significance for China as the
country will celebrate its 50th birthday and resume its right of
exercising sovereignty over Macao.
</P>
<P>
Jiang urged those in judicial and public security departments
to be vigilant and remain tough on crime, stressing that social
stability is the paramount task for China next year.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that today's world is by no means peaceful, with
hegemony rife and worldwide power politics still looming large on
the horizon. The trend towards economic globalization is a grave
challenge to China in protecting itself in terms of economic
security.
</P>
<P>
He called for a program of political and ideological education
among the general public to "enhance their awareness and
capability to fight against the infiltration by both domestic and
foreign hostile forces."
</P>
<P>
Jiang said: "Any factors that could jeopardize our stability
must be annihilated in the early stages. This policy has been
proved by our past experience and is very important and
effective," said Jiang.

<HEADLINE> Nanjing Residents Condemn Verdict of Japanese Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Many Nanjing residents today
condemned the verdict of a Japanese court which ruled that
soldiers named in a war-time diary about the Nanjing Massacre
cannot be brought to trial.
</P>
<P>
From all walks of life, they gathered in a museum built to
commemorate the 300,000 people killed by Japanese soldiers in the
infamous December 1937 Nanjing Massacre.
</P>
<P>
The names of some of those who perpetrated the evil deeds
had been listed in the diary of Shiro Azuma, a former Japanese
soldier who witnessed the incident and recorded it.
</P>
<P>
Shiro Azuma published his diary in April 1996 and was promptly
sued by a man listed in it and named as a war criminal. The Tokyo
Higher Court ruled in the man's favor, that his name should not be
publicised or any action taken.
</P>
<P>
Azuma, who feels justice should be done, appealed to a higher
court but that appeal was rejected this month.
</P>
<P>
According to Gao Xingzu, a professor with the Department of
History at Nanjing University and chairman of the Nanjing Massacre
Historical Society said that the verdict only demonstrates that
the Japanese right-wing elements have never been eliminated.
</P>
<P>
"The massacre has been consistently and universally condemned
by the nations worldwide, including military tribunals," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wang Jingcheng, vice-chairman of the Nanjing Law Society,
revealed that Shiro Azuma and his lawyer has come to Nanjing twice
to collect evidence of the massacre, to no avail.

<HEADLINE> DNA Samples Urged for Air Crews in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Canadian flight crews and
frequent flyers should have their fingerprints and DNA samples
stored with their employers or the government,  newspapers here
said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
After spending 105 days identifying the fragmented remains of
the 229 passengers and crew of Swissair Flight 111, a senior
officer from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police RCMP) said the
RCMP would recommend to the federal Transportation Safety Board
TSB) that all Canadian air crews should have their personal
information stored with their airlines or with the board itself,
to be used only in case of a crash.
</P>
<P>
"(An air disaster) is a remote possibility and it continues to
be a remote possibility, basically proven by the statistics. It
(providing samples) is strictly an individual's choice. We are
only recommending this for the flight crews," said Steve Duncan,
the RCMP's top crash investigator, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
But Canadian airlines are approaching the RCMP recommendations
cautiously, recognizing that mandatory fingerprinting or DNA
testing is fraught with human rights issues.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Air Canada said that her company had not
considered storing fingerprints or doing DNA testing for its
employees but would review the legal and labor issues involved if
the TSB recommended it.
</P>
<P>
She said at one time the airline fingerprinted its cabin crews
but stopped because it was unnecessary.

"The previous government has not committed grave errors,"
Silayev said. But the delay in implementing further economic
reforms has caused a serious depreciation in the value of the
national currency, Interfax quoted him as saying.

Silayev also criticized the government for failing to

<P>
"We should stop blaming everything on Russia," Silayev said.

"The Finance Ministry and the National Bank claimed in
September that the Russian crisis had not affected the country's
economy or Kyrgyzstan's currency... Kyrgyzstan is still suffering
from its own unsettled problems that complicate the economic
situation," he said.

In an interview with the daily Liberation, French Foreign Minis
ter Hubert Vedrine said that "a new system, not of investigation
on the past, but of precautions for the future," could be set up
to replace the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of
destruction of arms of mass destruction in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"A continuous control would consist first of all of surveying
any re-launch by Iraq of the production of prohibited weapons. It
would also seek to prevent the continuous deterioration of the
humanitarian situation in Iraq," Vedrine said.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the new control system also serve as the
basis for a lifting of U.N. sanctions against Iraq imposed since
the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
He said that France shares the "same objective" with the
United States on Iraq, which aims at preventing the country from
becoming dangerous again.
</P>
<P>
"Our common objective is the establishment of a real
continuous control system over armament and the oil income (of
Iraq), which would gather the conditions of security that allow
the lifting of oil embargo." he said.
</P>
<P>
However, it was reported that the United States has rejected
the French proposal for a new control system and said that the

<HEADLINE> Year-ender: Kenya's Economic Recovery Lies in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's economy beleaguered
since the multi-party election year of 1997 went in deeper water
throughout 1998, and experts said the outlook into early 1999
remains bleak.
</P>
<P>
Real gross domestic product (GDP) growth fell to 1.6 percent
in the year to July, down from 2.3 percent last year and well
below estimated population growth of 2.5 percent, latest data
from the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) show.
</P>
<P>
"Economic performance is expected to remain depressed into
early 1999" when the global recession is also expected to further
erode prospects for economic recovery by reducing the demand and
depressing the prices of the country's exports, the CBK added.
</P>
<P>
Last week, President Daniel arap Moi told Kenyans to prepare
even harder economic times next year, saying that the recession
would worsen due to economic problems in Asia and Russia.
</P>
<P>
High interest rates, low investors' confidence and collapsing
infrastructure have strangled the economy this year, while El
Nino-related bad weather has also hampered agricultural
production, especially that of coffee, sugar and horticulture.
</P>
<P>
The CBK also blamed the slower growth on a decline in foreign
aid, labor unrest, huge domestic debts and the delayed effects of
past insecurity and political turmoil due to the elections held
at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
A bomb raid on the U.S. embassy in Nairobi on August 7 killed
over 250 people and caused extensive damage to local businesses.
The Kenyan government estimated the losses hit 500 million U.S.
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, the trouble has been brewing for quite some time in
this east African country, suiting an old Chinese saying -- No
river can freeze three feet deep within one day.
</P>
<P>
Kenya, although enjoying the rare reputation as "the Peace
Oasis in Africa" since its independence in 1963, has staggered in
the economic development, especially after it started democratic
and liberal reforms in early 1990s partly in a desperate bid to
cater for aid money.
</P>
<P>
The suspension of a 205-million-Dollar aid package by the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) in mid 1997 shook Kenya with
instant results that investors' confidence plummeted and interest
and foreign exchange rates skyrocketed.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 23 (Xinhua) -- China's capital Beijing is
expected to have achieved a 9.5 percent growth in gross domestic
product (GDP) in 1998, exceeding the projected target by a slight
0.5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the city's economic conference that concluded here
today, Beijing vice mayor Liu Qi said the high growth follows
massive capital investment.
</P>
<P>
Fixed asset investment this year will have reached 113 billion
yuan (about 14.1 billion US dollars), representing a year-on-year
increase of 17.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The city's input in urban infrastructure construction is
estimated to top 15 billion yuan (about 1.8 billion US dollars), a
massive 67 percent increase over last year.
</P>
<P>
Major capital projects under construction include the
Pingan Boulevard, an extension to the subway which will run under
Changan Avenue, and several projects to improve water and heating
supplies.
</P>
<P>
This year, the city attracted a total of 2.9 billion
U.S. dollars in foreign investment and its exports reached 2.7
billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Envoy Insists on Peaceful Solution to Angola Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LUANDA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- United Nations special
representative to Angola, Issa Diallo, said Wednesday that the
Angolan crisis could be settled only through peaceful
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Diallo made the remarks here in response to a statement
issued Tuesday by the Angolan government, which blamed the U.N.
for biasing and conniving at UNITA's actions.
</P>
<P>
Only through negotiations, including persuading those who
have chosen the language of war to give up the military option,
can the crisis facing Angola be resolved, the U.N. envoy
stressed.
</P>
<P>
The statement attributed the fierce fighting which broke out
again in central Angola between the government army and the
troops of the opposition National Union for Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA) to the "bias and connivance" of the U.N. observer
mission at UNITA's actions.
</P>
<P>
It urged the U.N. to follow the stance of the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) by declaring UNITA President
Jonas Savimbi to be a "war criminal" and considering the UNITA
breakaway group Renovation Commission as the sole lawful
dialogist so as to fulfill all the tasks prescribed in the 1994
Lusaka peace accord.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. envoy said it is "understandable" that the Angolan
government showed dismay becaused the 1994 Lusaka Peace Protocol
was not comprehensively implemented.
</P>
<P>
"We can understand the stance mentioned by the Angolan
government#," he said. "But we hope that they can also understand
ours. That is, everything should be good for peace and
reconciliation among all the Angolan people."
</P>
<P>
A military source disclosed that the government troops dealt
a severe blow at the UNITA forces in the battlefield near Kuito,
recapturing the strategic town of Cunhinga, 30 km northwest of
Kuito, along with cannons and armored vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Kuito has been surrounded by the UNITA troops for more than
half a month and the seisure of Cunhinga has greatly released the
pressure upon the government troops defending the capital of Bie
province.
</P>
<P>
However, the source warned people against being over
optimistic since the areas around Kuito are still in the hands of
the UNITA forces.

<HEADLINE> Prices Remain Steady in November in France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Inflation rate rose by 0.3 percent in November as compared
with the same month last year, while prices were down by 0.1
percent from September to November, said INSEE.
</P>
<P>
The main reason for the slowdown in inflation was the
continuous fall in energy prices, including those of oil
products, which dropped by 0.4-0.5 percent in November.
</P>
<P>
Household consumption rose by 0.1 percent in November, as
compared with a 0.9 percent fall in October.
</P>
<P>
The increase was attributed to a 7.5 percent growth in
automobile purchases as compared with October, and an increasing
purchase of pharmaceutical products by French families.
</P>
<P>
The survey also showed a drop of business confidence in
France, whose industrial activities have been slowing down for
months and are expected to continue to slow down for months.
</P>
<P>
Industrial leaders said that since the beginning of December,
all industrial sectors except automobile have been slowing down
their activities.
</P>
<P>
Industrial output by French enterprises is expected to
continue to decrease in the coming months along with falling
commodity prices, said INSEE.

<HEADLINE> Koirala Named PM of New Govt in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Congress (NC)
President Girija Prasad Koirala, who resigned Monday as Nepal's
prime minister, was appointed Wednesday by King Birendra as
expected to head a new coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Koirala has won enough support of 135 lawmakers from his ruling
NC, the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxism-Leninism,
CPN-UML) and the Nepal Sadbhavana Party, said a notice issued by
the king's Principal Press Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
As agreed upon by the parties, the coalition government, the
sixth since the mid-term polls in November 1994. is responsible
for conducting free, fair and impartial elections to be held by
March/April 1999.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement reached Sunday between the NC and the
CPN-UML, the two powers in the parliament, other parties
represented in the parliament would be included in the new
cabinet, which would be small in size.
</P>
<P>
The faction of the National Democratic Party (RPP) led by
former Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand might join the
coalition as its leaders have said they were awaiting formal
invitation.
</P>
<P>
The RPP (Chand), which has eight seats in the 205-member Lower
House of Parliament, was involved in registering on Sunday a
no-confidence motion against the NC government.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of Nepal (Marxism-Leninism, CPN-ML) led in
moving the censure motion after pulling out of the
three-and-half-a-month coalition with the NC on December 10.
</P>
<P>
It alleged that the NC had failed to implement the agreements
reached with it and other left parties in August.
</P>
<P>
Following the new round of political turmoil, the main
opposition CPN-UML and other parties held that elections were the
only way out. The CPN-UML demanded a national government for
holding free, fair and impartial elections.
</P>
<P>
The mid-term polls in November 1994 produced a hung parliament
where no single party holds a majority.
</P>
<P>
On December 11, Koirala made a recommendation to the Royal
Palace for the dissolution of the parliament for fresh polls on
March 31, 1999, which was followed by a submission of 62 MPs from
the CPN-ML and its supporters calling for a special parliament
session to discuss their planned censure motion against the
government.
</P>
<P>
King Birendra had decided to call a special session of the
parliament on Thursday as petitioned by the 62 lawmakers and
CPN-ML supporters.
</P>
<P>
But Koirala resigned Monday under the agreement reached with
the CPN-UML to pave the way for the formation of a new coalition,
making the censure motion targetless.
</P>
<P>
Koirala told a press conference here Wednesday afternoon that
the special parliament session will go ahead as scheduled because
it is a constitutional exercise.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Passes Laws on 1999 Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican parliament
Tuesday passed a new electoral law and some regulations
concerning the National Electoral Commission, which has provided
the legal basis for the general elections to be held in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The electoral law stipulates that the president and parliament
members are to be elected by Mozambican citizens in a direct,
secret, fair and general vote, local daily Noticias reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It has a special article on the supervision of voting and
punishment of possible mal-practice.
</P>
<P>
Different from the 1994 elections, the new law also offers
opportunities for Mozambican citizens living abroad to take part
in the general elections.
</P>
<P>
The number of members of the National Electoral Commission is
to be increased from present nine to 17, with the chairman of the
commission to be appointed by the president and two vice-chairmen
to be appointed by the speaker of the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The electoral law has come out of 15-day discussion on a
proposal by a joint group which consists of the ruling Mozambican
Liberation Front (Frelimo), the biggest opposition party of
Mozambican National Resistance (Renamo) and the Democratic Union.
</P>
<P>
About 240 of the 250-member parliament were present at the
voting of the electoral law Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Govt Should Retain 40% Shares of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government should
hold on 40 percent of shares of companies to be privatized to
safeguard the national interest, the New Nigerian Wednesday
quoted a senior business official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Buba Bajoga, Managing Director of Nigerian Telecommunications
Limited (NITEL), told the paper that if the experience of
collapsed private banks was anything to go by, it was imperative
that the government should control substantial shares in NITEL.
</P>
<P>
He described the telecommunications industry as strategic and
sensitive, saying that such an industry could not be left
entirely in the hands of the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Bajoga stressed that the government needed to be very cautious
in privatizing such a strategic industry, adding that this was
the case even in countries that were relatively more advanced
than Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Only 30 percent shares of the telecommunications industry are
controlled by the private sector in South Africa while in France
and Germany, 40 percent are in private hands, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Under Nigeria's planned privatization program, 40 percent of
the shares will be sold to foreign technical partners and 20
percent to Nigerians while 40 percent will be retained by the
government.
</P>
<P>
Last week, British trade secretary Brian Wilson who paid a
visit to the west African country advised the Nigerian government
to take a second look at its planned retention of 40 percent
shares in the companies earmarked for privatization.
</P>
<P>
He said that "the 40 percent golden share is likely to act as
a deterrent and may lead to the collapse of even the strongest
companies and I think you would like to avoid this."
</P>
<P>
The secretary noted that the 40-40-20 formula should not be
taken as the only way to approach the program, urging the
Nigerian government to be flexible.

<HEADLINE> Nigerians Condemn Fuel Price Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian labor unions and
religious groups have condemned the government's decision to
increase the price of petroleum products, according to local
media reports Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general of the National Public Service
Negotiating Council, Sylvester Ejofoh, said Tuesday in Lagos that
the increase "is another invitation to Mr. inflation to come and
ravage Nigerians."
</P>
<P>
The general secretary of the Civil Service Union, Paul Okolo,
described the increase as "outrageous and saddening", adding that
"they have made a very sad Christmas for Nigerians and workers,
in particular."
</P>
<P>
He urged the government to reverse the decision.
</P>
<P>
The Catholic Bishop of Ekiti Diocese, Michael Fagun, said the
increase in the pump price would deepen poverty in the ranks of
the impoverished Nigerians.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to combat persistent fuel scarcity, the Nigerian
government has recently decided to deregulate the fuel market,
allowing major marketers to decide fuel prices and import
directly.
</P>
<P>
The decision has led to the increase of fuel price from 11
Naira per liter to about 25 Naira per liter (One U.S. Dollar
equals to 86 Naira).

</P>
<P>
Gong Zhanrong, wife of the Chinese ambassador to Tanzania,

She said as a member of the United Nations, Tanzania organizes
celebrations to commemorate the International Women's Day on
March 8 every year.
</P>
<P>
The fund will meet the costs of scarves and flags to be used

region of Mwanza.
</P>

The donation was from all female diplomats and the wives of
diplomats of the Chinese embassy who are willing to build more

<HEADLINE> Year-ender: Kenya's Economic Recovery Lies in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's economy beleaguered
since the multi-party election year of 1997 went in deeper water
throughout 1998, and experts said the outlook into early 1999
remains bleak.
</P>
<P>
Real gross domestic product (GDP) growth fell to 1.6 percent
in the year to July, down from 2.3 percent last year and well
below estimated population growth of 2.5 percent, latest data
from the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) show.
</P>
<P>
"Economic performance is expected to remain depressed into
early 1999" when the global recession is also expected to further
erode prospects for economic recovery by reducing the demand and
depressing the prices of the country's exports, the CBK added.
</P>
<P>
Last week, President Daniel arap Moi told Kenyans to prepare
even harder economic times next year, saying that the recession
would worsen due to economic problems in Asia and Russia.
</P>
<P>
High interest rates, low investors' confidence and collapsing
infrastructure have strangled the economy this year, while El
Nino-related bad weather has also hampered agricultural
production, especially that of coffee, sugar and horticulture.
</P>
<P>
The CBK also blamed the slower growth on a decline in foreign
aid, labor unrest, huge domestic debts and the delayed effects of
past insecurity and political turmoil due to the elections held
at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
A bomb raid on the U.S. embassy in Nairobi on August 7 killed
over 250 people and caused extensive damage to local businesses.
The Kenyan government estimated the losses hit 500 million U.S.
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, the trouble has been brewing for quite some time in
this east African country, suiting an old Chinese saying -- No
river can freeze three feet deep within one day.
</P>
<P>
Kenya, although enjoying the rare reputation as "the Peace
Oasis in Africa" since its independence in 1963, has staggered in
the economic development, especially after it started democratic
and liberal reforms in early 1990s partly in a desperate bid to
cater for aid money.
</P>
<P>
The suspension of a 205-million-Dollar aid package by the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) in mid 1997 shook Kenya with
instant results that investors' confidence plummeted and interest
and foreign exchange rates skyrocketed.

<HEADLINE> Year-ender: Kenya's Economic Recovery Lies in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
However, this just adds a new one to many vivid examples
showing the vulnerability of the structure-unbalanced Kenyan
economy, mainly propped up by tourism and several cash crops like
tea and coffee.
</P>
<P>
The figures show that Kenya has a foreign debt of 4.9 billion
U.S. Dollars with an annual debt payment of 800 million Dollars,
posing a burden to the country's economic development.
</P>
<P>
With debts making up one-third of the annual GDP and civil
servants wages two-third of the government's expenditure, space
for re-investing socio-economic development including education,
health and industry is left very limited, thus seriously
depending on conditional foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the income distribution is the second unbalanced in
the world according to the U.N. data. The 10 percent richest
Kenyans enjoy 47.7 percent of the national incomes while the 10
percent poorest only get 1.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
What is worsening the situation is corruption, which senior
Kenyan officials repeated in public, has spread "from top to
bottom" of the whole society. Foreign donors now see it as the
largest impediment to the country's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The IMF cites graft and poor governance as key reasons behind
its aid lapse which is expected to last at earliest into mid
1999. The World Bank cut about half of its grant from this year
due to the fact that on average, only three percent of projects
can be underway yearly.
</P>
<P>
President Moi recently declared a war against embezzlement of
public funds and urged all public servants to have a duty and
moral obligation to serve the public with utmost honesty.
</P>
<P>
Throughout 1998, the government has been successful in
carrying out tight policies to curb inflation, the public
spending and interest rates while improving infrastructure,
especially roads, and expanding markets in east and southern
Africa.
</P>
<P>
In addition, various economic sectors such as trade,
industrial development and telecommunications are taking measures
to speed up their reform and liberalization processes so as to
raise their efficiency and lure domestic and foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
But local analysts said they are afraid that lack of good
results from the anti-graft campaign will frustrate governmental
morals and efforts to recover investors' confidence, as in the
IMF case, and finally to kill efforts to revamp the economy.
</P>
<P>
Hope lies in deepened reforms, they said, Kenya should take
bolder political and economic measures to crack down on
corruption, to reshape the socio-economic system, to boost
manufacturing and narrow the gap between the rich and the poor,
so as to accumulate needed economic momentum.
</P>
<P>
As a new millennium is approaching, it is high time that Kenya
should make urgent efforts to embark on a sound development cycle
to realize a stable and sustainable economic growth.

<HEADLINE> Dar Stock Exchange Turnover Rises Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The Dar es Salaam Stock
Exchange (DSE) Wednesday recorded a turnover of 15.2 million
Shillings (about 22,355 U.S. Dollars), a sharp increase of 134
percent over last week.
</P>
<P>
A total of 25,040 shares were traded in 12 deals at the
exchange, the sole one in Tanzania, said Robert C. Mathu, a DSE
technical advisor.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzania Oxygen Limited (TOL) counter remained active as
5,000 shares were traded in only one deal at 390 Shillings per
share (about 665 Shillings equal to one U.S. Dollar).
</P>
<P>
The reason for the active transactions is that share-holders
have heard the news that the management of the loss-making TOL is
negotiating with strategic investors, Emmanuel Nyalali, the DSE
systems and operation official told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzania Breweries Limited (TBL) shares opened high at 670
Shillings per share and closed lower at 630 Shillings per share,
a drop of 4.8 percent from last week's closing price of 660
Shillings per share, said a statement issued by the DSE.
</P>
<P>
At the close of the session, 200 TOL shares were on bid at 385
Shillings per share, while 4,000 shares were on offer at 390
Shillings per share and 200 others at 400 Shillings per share,
said the statement.
</P>
<P>
TBL, a joint venture between the government and a South
African company, had 12,210 shares on offer at 650 Shillings and
680 Shillings per share with no outstanding bids as the session
closed, it said.
</P>
<P>
The Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange opens once a week, on
Wednesdays, since only two companies have been listed so far.
</P>
<P>
TOL Limited, a leading manufacturer and distributor of
industrial and medical gases, was the first public company listed
on the stock exchange in the first half of the year. TBL came on
board in August to make the shares market more lively.

<HEADLINE> China Drafts Tough Copyright Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 23 (Xinhua) -- China intends to tighten up
its copyright laws and a draft amendment outlining the moves, and
a tough new stance on piracy was submitted to the country's top
legislative body today.
</P>
<P>
In recent years China has signed many international treaties
and promised to crack down on offenders, who it believes are
harming the public's and society's interests.
</P>
<P>
With continued economic, scientific and cultural development, a
revision of the existing Copyright Law is essential, said Yu
Youxian, director of the State Press and Publications
Administration and the National Copyright Administration, today at
the sixth meeting of the Standing Committee of the Ninth National
People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
"It is increasingly more important to handle correctly our
international obligations as well as protecting domestic
copyright," Yu added.
</P>
<P>
The amendment lists ten items affecting property rights
including copying, distribution, exhibition, public performance,
broadcasting and translation.
</P>
<P>
The revised law has also put a number of new items under
protection, including data bank information.
</P>
<P>
It includes specific provision for the transfer of copyright
and compensation claims for pirated works.
</P>
<P>
Yu added that the revised law encourages authors to take the
initiative in such incidences and will assist the authorities in
their ongoing battle against the piracy of cultural, artistic and
scientific works.
</P>
<P>
It also protects the copyright of works by foreigners,
according to the international treaties and agreements China has
signed.
</P>
<P>
However, provisions related to issues caused by hi-tech
development, and which are still in controversy internationally,
will not be included in the new draft.

<HEADLINE> Yassin Freed From House Arrest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Hamas spiritual leader Sheik
Ahmed Yassin was freed Wednesday by Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) from nearly two months of house arrest in Gaza,
the Voice of Palestine reported.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Hamas (Islamic Resistance Movement), Mahmoud
Zahar, said the group welcomed the PNA's decision to free Yassin.
</P>
<P>
With the lifting of the house arrest, Yassin was expected
to receive a few close associates. During his house arrest, he
was prevented from meeting visitors.
</P>
<P>
Yassin was put under house arrest on October 29, after a Hamas
activist killed himself in an unsuccessful attempt to blow up a
school bus full of Israeli school children in the Gaza Strip. The
attack came only six days after the Israel and the Palestinians
signed the Wye peace accord in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Yassin's house arrest, which deeply angered his followers, was
one of the PNA's strongest steps against Hamas. At one point, in a
leaflet signed by its military wing, Hamas demanded Yasin's
release and made a rare direct threat against PNA Chairman Yasser
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Yassin's release drew criticism from the Israeli government.
Moshe Fogel, Director of the Government Press Office, said the
PNA has to decide whether it wants to meet its commitments to
fight Hamas terror and move the peace process forward or turn a
blind eye to the terrorist activities of the Hamas leadership.

<HEADLINE> EDS-BRITAIN-MINISTER- UK Trade Minister Quits over House Loan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 23 (Xinhua) -- British Trade Secretary Peter
Mandelson has resigned after it was revealed Monday that he
borrowed 373,000 pounds (about 620,000 U.S. dollars) from
Paymaster General Geoffrey Robinson.
</P>
<P>
His resignation was announced by Cabinet Minister Jack
Cunningham. The minister told an independent television station
on Wednesday that Mandelson had failed to declare a loan given to
him by Robinson, who is reportedly a self-made millionaire.
</P>
<P>
Mandelson used the loan to buy a house in London's fashionable
Notting Hill area two years ago, while the Labor Party was in
opposition.
</P>
<P>
The row gained impetus because the trade secretary's
department is now investigating alleged irregularities in
Robinson's business dealings.
</P>
<P>
Conservative leader William Hague wrote to Prime Minister Tony
Blair claiming that Mandelson was clearly in breach of
parliamentary rules on conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
Blair on Tuesday defended Mandelson after the latter admitted
receiving the secret loan from Paymaster Robinson.
</P>
<P>
Mandelson has repeatedly stated that he did nothing wrong and
there was no conflict of interest involved.
</P>
<P>
Mandelson is the third minister in Blair's government to
resign after Ron Davies and Frank Field resigned earlier this
year.

<HEADLINE> China Auto Market Continues to Improve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Production and sales of autos
in China grew for the third consecutive month in November,
according to industry analysts, a trend they say will continue in
1999.
</P>
<P>
China turned out 157,000 autos in the month and sales reached
142,000, which are higher levels of achievement than in the first
eleven months of last year.
</P>
<P>
The Automotive Industry Development Research Institute (AIDRI)
attributes the rise to the confidence of manufacturers who
increased output in the last few months. This, they say, led to an
unprecedented simultaneous increase in sales.
</P>
<P>
In January-November this year, China turned out a total of
1.487 million autos with sales of 1.43 million.
</P>
<P>
However, the actual growth rate in both production and sales
was still not as high as the same period last year, by four
percent and five percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
An AIDRI spokesman explained that this could be a result of the
government's restructuring of many sectors which had reduced
demand for company cars, and that measures introduced to expand
the private car market are still to have any marked impact.
</P>
<P>
A general economic slowing down and a sluggish consumer market
also factored in the car market's results.
</P>
<P>
However, he did point out that the government's moves to
stimulate the economy have begun to have an effect on the auto
industry generally. The sales of heavy duty trucks, for example,
has shown a two digit increase.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese Parliament Rejects Presidential Call </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Sudan's National Assembly
(parliament) rejected a presidential call for it to accept the
resignation of Hassan Abdulla Al Turabi as the parliament speaker.
</P>
<P>
The presidential message called on the legislature to accept
Turabi's resignation, which was submitted early this month, so
that he could work full time as secretary general of the National
Congress, effectively the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
The National Congress is the successor to the ruling National
Islamic Front.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's "Al Rai Al Akhar" daily said the assembly held a
closed-door meeting Tuesday to discuss the message delivered by
First Vice President Ali Osman Mohamed Taha, but failed to reach a
consensus.
</P>
<P>
Some assembly members said that the resignation of Turabi, who
was considered the most influential person in Sudanese government,
would undermine the assembly, pointing out that the resignation
had already given rise to the emergence of contending blocs.
</P>
<P>
Recently, an advisory body of the National Congress held a
meeting chaired by Sudanese President Omar Bashir during which ten
members submitted a note calling for the establishment of a
leadership bureau headed by Bashir.
</P>
<P>
Observers believe the note aims at degrading the role of
Islamic fundamentalist Turabi as the congress chief as well as
promoting Bashir's role.
</P>
<P>
Bashir dissolved all political parties after he seized power in
a 1989 military coup. He signed a bill early December to legalize
political parties, which will come into effect on January 1,
1999.

<HEADLINE> Protecting Rights of Migrant People in China's Three Gorges Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The city of Chongqing is
giving priority to the rights of a million people who have to be
moved from the area of the Three Gorges Dam project.
</P>
<P>
These people face problems that have never had to be dealt with
before and require new measures related to economic, civil and
criminal laws.
</P>
<P>
Local officials complain that, apart from some regional
regulations, there is not a single law dealing with problems of
resettled people. The city's Intermediary People's Court has had
an increasing number of civil and criminal cases since the
relocation program started in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Some legal scholars have warned that law enforcement is
especially important in guaranteeing public security during the
relocation process. They say that most of them are from rural
areas and are far from well-off and the government needs to
increase supervision of the state-subsidized fund to make sure it
goes to the right places.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Implement New Agriculture Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will implement
its Third National Agriculture Policy (NAP3) approved by the
cabinet Wednesday over a 13-year period until 2010, Agriculture
Minister Sulaiman Daud announced at a press conference here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The new policy's main objective is maximizing income through
optimum use of agricultural resources by introducing two
approaches, namely agroforestry and a product-based strategy, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The new policy spells out new approaches to deal with current
challenges facing the agriculture sector and strategies to tackle
inflation.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet at its weekly meeting Wednesday also endorsed the
Agriculture Action Plan which spells out the commitment required
of all quarters to realizing the strategies laid down in the
policy, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said an estimated investment of 32 billion ringgit (8.42
billion U.S. dollars), of which 21 billion ringgit (5.53 billion
dollars) by the private sector and 11 billion ringgit (about 2.89
billion dollars) by the public sector, would be required to
implement the policy strategies.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the new dual approach could deal with the
present challenges of ensuring enough supply of nutritious and
safe food at reasonable costs and other challenges facing the
agriculture sector.
</P>
<P>
He said that on the product-based approach, the policy
emphasized the need to identify products and main markets based on
demand, market potentials and customer preference.
</P>
<P>
Sulaiman said the strategies for boosting local food production
include concentration on cost-effective food products such as
fisheries, fruits and vegetables, zoning of areas specifically for
food production and intensified research and development to
increase output.
</P>
<P>
In promoting agricultural growth and new high-value industries,
the NAP3 would focus on developing biotechnological and natural
chemical products, oil-palm biomass products, horticulture and
ornamental fishes, he said.
</P>
<P>
The NAP3 encourages the private sector to practice hi-tech
farming methods through the development of agro-technology parks.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the NAP3 would lead the country's agriculture
sector into commercialized farming, with emphasis on food
production, resource-based industries and new industries such as
biotechnology and natural chemical and oil palm biomass products.

<HEADLINE> Tudjman Calls For Concerted Efforts Towards Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Croatian President Franjo
Tudjman on Tuesday called on the three ethnic groups of Serbs,
Croats and Muslims in Bosnia to make concerted efforts towards
peaceful co-existence.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony for the construction of the
Sava River Bridge, Tudjman said the bridge when finished would not
only serve as an economic linkage among the three groups, but also
enhance their communications.
</P>
<P>
The Sava bridge across Croatia and Bosnia was destroyed in 1992
when wars broke out in the former Yugoslav region, and would be
restored with a 6.5 million dollars loan from the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
This signaled that Bosnia-Herzegovina had entered a stage of
peaceful coexistence and progress, Tudjman said.
</P>
<P>
He then stressed that the Washington Agreement, Dayton Peace
Accord and the Croatia-Bosnia accord on establishing special
relations had paved the way for a permanent resolution to the
conflicts in the region.
</P>
<P>
With these documents implemented, people in the region could
live peacefully together and refugees return to places where
life would be safe and free, Tudjman said.
</P>
<P>
The three ethnic groups should seek pragmatic solutions to
their problems, which could serve their interests, the
president said. Meanwhile, the international community should not
pursue "such an unreasonable and ambiguous idea as establishing
some kind of a unified Bosnia country," he added, and history had
disproved the feasibility of such an idea.
</P>
<P>
The reality was, Tudjman said, the three groups were now living
in Bosnia and they should find a permanent solution that could let
them live together free from conflicts.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The former deputy director of
Jinan Customs has been given a life sentence by the Supreme
People's Court for participating in a smuggling racket.
</P>
<P>
Gao Qingting was also deprived of lifelong political rights and
also had part of his property confiscated.
</P>
<P>
A junior official in his department also received a three year
jail sentence for helping Gao.
</P>
<P>
The Intermediate People's Court of Jinan, capital of east
China's Shandong Province, found that Gao colluded with a Hong
Kong businessman in smuggling activities many times during his
term of office.
</P>
<P>
Instigated by Gao, Liu Guiliang, a customs officer, let 575
Swiss made watches, airfreighted from Hong Kong by the
businessman, pass through Jinan Customs without going through
declaration procedures between May and June of 1996, making a
total tariff loss of over 760,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
With the help of Gao, the Hong Kong businessman also flew more
than 47,000 sets of pager parts over the three months from
September to November of the same year, with a total tariff loss
of more than 3 million yuan.

<HEADLINE> Time Catches Up With Ancient Uygur Tribe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, December 23 (Xinhua) -- When China laid down laws to
protect wildlife, the impact on communities such as the descendants
of the Loulan Tribe who had traditionally been hunters and
fishermen was dramatic.
</P>
<P>
They had lived and prospered along the legendary "Silk Road"
for more than 2,000 years, but gradually had been forced to change
their lifestyles with farming and animal husbandry becoming more
common activities in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
But the real changes only began in the 1970s and 96 year old
Ismail, who lives in Awat Village close to Lop Nur Lake to the
southeast of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, is one of the few
people left alive who can recall his youth, when he was taught to
fish in a canoe and hunt for food.
</P>
<P>
Today, canoes are no longer in use and younger generations in
his village have lost the skills of hunting and fishing. His own
canoe is now used as a trough to feed horses.
</P>
<P>
The Lop Nur people tried to continue the lifestyle enjoyed by
their forefathers for thousands of years but 1980 was a watershed
for them when the new laws were introduced.
</P>
<P>
Shotguns were confiscated by the government and instead the
villagers were allocated plots of farmland.
</P>
<P>
Since that time more than 200 households in Awat have taken to
planting cotton and per-capita farmland has reached half a
hectare, much higher than the country's average.
</P>
<P>
The 34 year old village chief, Ahmad Abdul, proudly even
reveals that labor saving machinery is now bringing in high yields
from the cotton fields. "After over a dozen years of development
we have realized the benefits." he said.
</P>
<P>
Tractors and trucks loaded with cotton are now the
most-commonly seen vehicles in Awat while the old ways of making a
living, fishing and hunting, are merely distant history.

<HEADLINE> Yassin Freed From House Arrest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Hamas spiritual leader Sheik
Ahmed Yassin was freed Wednesday by Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) from nearly two months of house arrest in Gaza,
the Voice of Palestine reported.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Hamas (Islamic Resistance Movement), Mahmoud
Zahar, said the group welcomed the PNA's decision to free Yassin.
</P>
<P>
With the lifting of the house arrest, Yassin was expected
to receive a few close associates. During his house arrest, he
was prevented from meeting visitors.
</P>
<P>
Yassin was put under house arrest on October 23, after a Hamas
activist killed himself in an unsuccessful attempt to blow up a
school bus full of Israeli school children in the Gaza Strip. The
attack came only six days after the signing of the Wye peace
accord in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Yassin's house arrest, which deeply angered his followers, was
one of the PNA's strongest steps against Hamas. At one point, in a
leaflet signed by its military wing, Hamas demanded Yasin's
release and made a rare direct threat against PNA Chairman Yasser
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Yassin's release drew criticism from the Israeli government.
Moshe Fogel, Director of the Government Press Office, said the
PNA has to decide whether it wants to meet its commitments to
fight Hamas terror and move the peace process forward or turn a

<HEADLINE> China To Tighten Up Its Contract Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese legislators drawing up
the draft Contract Law have decided against introducing elements
which would have permitted contractors to challenge details of the
contract, and even have it annulled.
</P>
<P>
In the previous draft contactors would have the right to alter
or abandon their signed agreements if some unpredictable changes
in national policies or the social and economic climate meant they
would suffer losses.
</P>
<P>
Gu Angran, vice-chairman of the Law Committee of the National
People's Congress (NPC), gave a briefing on the amendment today at
the on-going sixth meeting of the Ninth NPC Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
He referred to the two controversial opinions on the amendment,
saying that some people believe that by retaining those sections
of the draft would affect the real status of contracts, making
them almost worthless.
</P>
<P>
There are those, however, who maintain that such clauses would
be helpful in disputes between contractors, as courts would be
unable to legislate without appropriate regulations.
</P>
<P>
Taking the two points of view into account, the NPC Law
Committee decided to scrap the clauses, insisting that business
risks cannot be cushioned in such a way because of economic or
social changes.
</P>
<P>
Economists have welcomed the new amendment and said that this
indicates the determination of legislators to maintain a stable
national economic policy.

<HEADLINE> Huge Funding for Key Projects in East China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, December 23 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province
has injected some 150 billion yuan into the construction of 92 key
projects so far this year, both figures all-time highs for the
province.
</P>
<P>
Money invested in projects already under construction stands at
25.5 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
To ensure that the economic growth rate goal can be achieved
this year, local authorities in Shandong nearly doubled the number
of projects and increased investment by 30 percent over the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
Most of the investment has been put into energy,
transportation, raw materials, the real estate sector, and urban
infrastructure construction, in which road construction projects
alone account for one-fifth of the total.
</P>
<P>
Improvement of the 11 waste-water treatment centers along
the Huaihe River and development of the Sanlianshun Lake community
and other residential areas are also key construction projects.
</P>
<P>
So far, a total of 17.8 billion yuan has been invested in 38
completed state and provincial key projects, accounting for 81.4
percent of this year's total investment plan.
</P>
<P>
Presently, most of the projects due to start operations by the
end of this year have been completed ahead of schedule or are
partially finished. These projects include the second phase of the
Qianwan project at the port of Qingdao, the automobile-parts
production project at Shandong First Auto Works, and the Xiaoqing
River water-treatment project.

BEIJING, December 23 (Xinhua) -- China will hold the 3rd
International Airshow in Zhuhai, in south China's Guangdong
Province in the year 2000, official sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
Zhuhai Airshow is a State-level aviation and aerospace gala
with flight performance. It is jointly held by the General
Administration of Civil Aviation of China, Aviation Industries
Corp. of China, China Aerospace Corporation, and Zhuhai City
Government.
</P>
<P>
China is intended to invite aviation and aerospace leaders from

Zhuhai will further upgrade its apron and roads, local
officials said, adding that a four-storey news center, with a
floor space of nearly 8,000 square meters, were commissioned
during this year's airshow.
</P>
<P>
China's civil aviation will increase annually at a rate of
about ten percent, bringing a demand for 600 airliners in the next

<HEADLINE> China Regrets Verdict of Japanese Court: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 23 (Xinhua) -- China has expressed surprise
and regret over the verdict issued by the Tokyo Court of Japan in
the case of the diary of Shiro Azuma, a former Japanese soldier
who witnessed the infamous "Nanking Massacre" in December 1937,
said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao here today.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on the verdict, which ruled in favor of those
named in the diary as among the Japanese who took part in the
massacre, Zhu said the court's decision ignored the facts of the
history.
</P>
<P>
The war of aggression against China launched by Japanese
militarists in the past brought great sufferings to the Chinese
people, Zhu said, adding that the extremely tragic "Nanking
Massacre" was only one of the atrocities committed by the Japanese
Army in China.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that any action attempting to refute this
historical fact is in vein, and will be strongly condemned by all
people with a sense of justice including the Japanese.
</P>
<P>
"We urge the Japanese side to face up to history and respect
reality, and learn from the past in order to avoid any similar
tragedies from occurring in the future.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Makes Big Strides in Reform of State Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Though still facing tough
problems, Shanghai, China's leading industrial city, has made
remarkable progress in restructuring its state-owned enterprises
over the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
The output value of local state-owned industrial enterprises
had grown 250 percent over the 1978 figure, to top 281.6 billion
yuan last year, accounting for 52.5 percent of the city's total
industrial output value.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, their gross profits had reached 34.67 billion yuan,
2.3 times the 1978 figure, making up 67.6 percent of the total of
the city's manufacturing sector.
</P>
<P>
Since 1978, Shanghai has replaced government-set production
quotas for enterprises with a market-oriented system, allowing
state firms to operate as independent entities.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, more than 900 state companies were
merged and another 86 went bankrupt in Shanghai, while an
increasing number of competitive enterprises were formed.
</P>
<P>
The city has also introduced a market-oriented employment
system for state enterprises to let job seekers compete with one
another.
</P>
<P>
As the number of layoffs rises with the reforms, the city
government has set up many re-employment centers in addition to
some 60 labor markets, which have helped the majority of the
city's 1.4 million redundant workers, some 1.19 million, find new
jobs.

Production and Construction Corps was tabled during today's sixth
meeting of the National People's Congress (NPC) Standing
Committee.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme People's Court and the Supreme People's

Courts and procuratorates under the Xinjiang Production and
Construction Corps were established in the 1950s, but were
disbanded in 1975 following disbandment of the corps. Related
departments were reinstated in 1984.
</P>
<P>
Various courts and procuratorates attached to the corps have
not only performed their trials duties and legal supervision over
the past 14 years, but have also played an important role in
regional construction and maintaining social stability.

</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- In an interview with Liberation, French Foreign Minister
Hubert Vedrine proposed establishing a new U.N. surveillance
system to prevent Iraq from developing weapons of mass
destruction. He also said that such a system would provide the
basis for the lifting of sanctions imposed on Iraq after the 1991
Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
-- The United States has categorically rejected the proposal
to gradually lift sanctions against Iraq by threatening to use
its right of veto at the United Nations Security Council. At the
same time, Iraq has ruled out a return of the U.N. arms
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- In the context of permanent crisis which started from Asia
18 months ago, the Paris Bourse summed up a surprising yearly
33.7 percent gain in its CAC 40 index on Tuesday, its best in 10
years. Over the past one year, 125 companies had their stocks
listed in Paris and the explosion of the figures of transactions
showed that the French stock exchange still draws investment from
abroad.
</P>
<P>
-- The German coalition government met with a crisis on
Tuesday as Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder accused the environment
minister, ecologist Kiegem Trittin, of endangering the coalition
government by pushing for a ban of nuclear power plants in the
country.

<HEADLINE> Australia Gives Grant for Prostate Cancer Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The federal government
Wednesday announced a 900,000-Australian dollar (558,000 U.S.
dollars) grant for a pre-clinical research project on a new
anti-prostate cancer treatment that may avoid the side-effects of
surgery and radiotherapy.
</P>
<P>
The researchers of the project are from the leading
pharmaceutical company F H Faulding &AMP; Co. Ltd. and the
government's Molecular Science and Oncology Research Center.
</P>
<P>
Health Minister Michael Wooldridge, while announcing the grant,
said prostate cancer is the second largest cause of cancer deaths
among Australian men, claiming 2,500 lives annually, the
Australian Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
"This prostate cancer research offers real hope for Australian
men, particularly those who develop a form of the disease which
cannot be treated at present," Wooldridge said.
</P>
<P>
Under the revolutionary treatment, genes will be delivered
direct into prostate cancer cells to stimulate the production of
an enzyme, which in turn activates anti-cancer drugs.
</P>
<P>
Researchers said the treatment, which is expected to go into
human clinical trials in two years' time, should be more effective
than current approaches because it will specifically target the
cancer cells.
</P>
<P>
Faulding Chief Executive Officer Ed Tweddell said the gene
treatment is a novel approach which might be used in the fight
against other forms of cancer.
</P>
<P>
The treatment could avoid the need for surgery, radiotherapy
and the use of hormone drugs, which have unpleasant side-effects
such as impotence and incontinence in some cases.

<HEADLINE> China to Intensify Implementation of Military Service Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The newly modified draft of
the Military Service Law, which has been submitted to the sixth
meeting of the Standing Committee of the ninth National People's
Congress (NPC), includes a series of measures on the punishment of
those who refuse to perform their military service.
</P>
<P>
These measures which aim to ensure the smooth implementation of
the Military Service Law are as follows: the local government has
the right to compel those people to perform their military
service, or they will be fined; and they are not allowed to apply
for jobs in official organizations and state-owned enterprises, or
to further their studies either at home or abroad, for two years.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Keyu, vice-chairman of the Law Committee of the NPC, said
the new draft law has been modified because many members of the
Standing Committee thought there should be an exact period for the
punishment.
</P>
<P>
He said that the draft adds that local governments on
the county level have the right to fine those enterprises who hire
soldiers who have left the army without permission, and they
may even be subject to criminal prosecution.
</P>
<P>
The draft provides that soldiers will be given preferential

<P>
HONG KONG, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive Tung Chee
Hwa of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region said Wednesday
that the government will continue to work in cooperation with all
sectors of the community in creating a good business environment
in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Before attending a Christmas party for children at the

business and investment is very important to Hong Kong because
that is the way to ensure the recovery of the economy and to
create more jobs for the Hong Kong people.
</P>
<P>
Tung made the remarks in response to the media's inquiries
about a well!-known Hong Kong businessman's complaint about the
current business environment in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"A harmonious community is fundamental to the creation of good,
attractive business environment, and I know that from that point
of view we will all work very hard to create this good
environment," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's success has always been based on the rule of law
and this is also fundamental in attracting both Hong Kong people's
investment as well as overseas investment, Tung stressed.
</P>
<P>
"So from that point of view, it is important for all of us to
abide by the terms and conditions of contract," the chief
executive said. "Rule of law is fundamental to Hong Kong's
future," he added.
</P>
<P>
Tung said he is sure that the business community, as well as
the people in Hong Kong, whether they are in politics and whether

<HEADLINE> Fog Causes Closure of Airport in Indian Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Air traffic has come to a
halt in New Delhi as thick fog enveloping the Indian capital for
more than a week forced the closure of the airport Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
No flight has taken off or landed since 23:30 local time
Tuesday due to near zero visibility, airport sources said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 Delhi-bound passengers were stranded at Mumbai
airport following the closure of Delhi airport.
</P>
<P>
Railway traffic in North India was also affected by the fog
with most of the trains passing through Delhi delayed.
</P>
<P>
Government officials and workers, company employees and school
children were among the worst affected with vehicles moving at a
snail's pace in the city which has a population of more 10
million.
</P>
<P>
Sources here said the closure of the airport was due to the
lack of a modern landing system, which can help overcome the
limitation caused by fog and help aircraft land when the
visibility is zero.
</P>
<P>
All flights, domestic and international, have been affected,
with nearly 40 percent of Indian Airlines flights being hit by
cancellations and delays for a week.
</P>
<P>
The closure will add more financial burden on Air India and
India Airlines which already lost more than 30 million U.S.
dollars in the first half of the current financial year.

<HEADLINE> Tomb of Ancient Knight Discovered in North China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHOT, December 23 (Xinhua) -- A tomb more than 1,000 years
old containing a large coffin and many bows, arrows and spears has
been discovered in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
An archeological report said the tomb also held the remains of
a man wearing linen and silk dresses and lying beside a 1.4
meter-long spear, a 1.5-meter-long bow, and an arrow bag and
several arrows, with a wooden saddle under his head.
</P>
<P>
According to his posture, archeologists believe that when he
was placed into the coffin he probably had a bow in hands and
an arrow bag on his back, as though he were still alive and
prepared for the battlefield.
</P>
<P>
The unearthed items also include wooden chopsticks and
plates. Archeologists believe their style is that of the Tang
Dynasty (618-917), when nomadic tribes in north China already had
extensive contact with people living in the central plains.
</P>
<P>
The nationality of the tomb's occupant remains a
mystery, according to archeologists, adding that further
studies will be pursued.
</P>
<P>
Nine other tombs dating back to the same era have also been
discovered in the region.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Legislature Deliberates International Convention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The National People's Congress
(NPC) Standing Committee, China's legislature, today deliberated
an international convention on the Minimum Age for Employment
formulated by the International Labor Organization (ILO).
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu Rongji introduced a proposal at the sixth meeting
of NPC Standing Committee concerning the Convention on the Minimum
Age for Employment. The proposal states that the convention does
not contradict Chinese law and thus ratification will be in the
best interests of the nation.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Zuoji, minister of Labor and Social Security, explained
the proposal to members of the nation's top legislative body.
</P>
<P>
The convention stipulates that the minimum age for employment
for youngsters in countries with underdeveloped economies and low
education should be above 14 years of age, with age in other
countries set at 15, according to Zhang. He pointed out that
Chinese law currently stipulates the minimum age at 16.
</P>
<P>
The convention shows that the international community pays
close attention to the ban of use of child labor, according to
Zhang.
</P>
<P>
China is carefully considering joining the convention to
eliminate the employment of child labor.
</P>
<P>
However, the convention will not apply to the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) before the Chinese government
makes a separate announcement.
</P>
<P>
A total of 59 ILO members had ratified the convention by the
end of last year. The convention was formulated in 1973 and took
effect in 1976.

MANILA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The Senate of the Philippines
Wednesday ratified the national budget for 1999, capping its "year
of legislative work."
</P>
<P>
Senate President Marcelo Fernan said the approved budget of 585
billion pesos (14.63 billion U.S. dollars) could well be their
gift to the people for the Christmas season, a budget that
"addresses the issues of poverty."
</P>
<P>
The approved 1999 budget, he said, will help "restore fiscal
health and sustain growth and stability."
</P>
<P>
Among government agencies, the Department of Education, Culture

<HEADLINE> Japan Donates Polio Vaccine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government
recently donated 30 million vaccine units valued at 700,000 US
dollars to reinforce China's efforts to eradicate polio.
</P>
<P>
Japan has donated a total of 150 million units over the past
eight years, according Nobuyuki Sugimoto, minister of the Japanese
Embassy in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
He said the concerted Sino-Japanese effort to battle polio
commenced in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) also sent
experts and equipment to China to establish polio monitoring
systems and laboratory networks. Related efforts are currently
being carried out in eight provinces.
</P>
<P>
Health departments will initiate a new vaccination campaign on
January 5 as part of an effort to polio eradication goals for the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
"While virus strains of polio have not been detected in China
since 1994, we must not be complacent in terms of
vaccinations since cases of polio are still prevalent in various
neighboring countries, with weak prevention efforts in some
areas," according to Wang Zhao, director of the Disease Control
Department of the Ministry of Health.
</P>
<P>
China reported between 40,000-50,000 polio cases, including a
number of deaths, each year before the government introduced the
national vaccination campaign.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmers Taking Lead in Reforms (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Voters in Chinese cities are
in the process of electing people's deputies at the county-level,
with candidates appointed by the authorities.
</P>
<P>
Yet for China's urban voters direct elections still seem far
away, while their rural neighbors have long been accustomed to
electing village heads through popular choice.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 90 percent of Chinese villages have adopted a
democratic financial system, in which, their leaders are obliged
to report to the community on the current financial status.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhenyao, a doctorate candidate at Beijing University, a
specialist in rural democracy, says that the decade-old practice
of direct elections and an open financial system in China's
villages are actually quite democratic in the real sense.
</P>
<P>
Some Chinese observers point out that farmers have been an
important driving force behind the 20-year-old reforms. What's
more, they have been more or less taking the lead, compared with
their urban counterparts.
</P>
<P>
In late 1978, rural farmers in Xiaogang Village, in east
China's Anhui Province, risked imprisonment and maybe loss of
their lives, to break up the People's commune-owned farmland into
smaller plots so that they can farm on a household basis.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, this action instigated the rural reform in China and is
known as "the rural household contract responsibility system
linking income with output".
</P>
<P>
Urban reforms, mainly related to state-owned industries, were
started years later, but by then starvation and poor living
standards for a lot of rural inhabitants were things of the past,
thanks to earlier rural reform.
</P>
<P>
In the intervening years rural reforms have brought about a
dramatic cut in the income-gap between country folk and urban
residents. In 1984, the average annual per-capita income for urban
Chinese was only 1.9 times that of rural people, down from 2.6
times in 1978.
</P>
<P>
The booming township and village-based industries have changed
China's economic landscape completely as rural industries
contributed 27.7 percent of the gross domestic product in 1997,
compared with less than one percent 20 years ago.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmers Taking Lead in Reforms (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Currently, some 210 million rural Chinese are employed by
township and village-based enterprises, preventing a huge influx
of unemployed rural laborers moving into big cities seeking
jobs, as was the case for many other countries on their way to
industrialization.
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, village elections, the household contract system and
rural industries are eulogized by some academics as "the Three
Great Creations" by Chinese farmers.
</P>
<P>
Chen Jiyuan, a researcher from the Rural Development Institute
of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, says that it is the
rural reform that has set an example for the ongoing reform drive
in the country as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Chinese farmers are known for being highly respectful about
education although pragmatic and sincere. According to official
figures, 60 percent of patented technologies available throughout
China have been bought by farmer-turned industrialists.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, banks say farmers make the most honest clients,
rarely taking on loans they cannot afford.
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, a large number of one-time farmers have become
successful entrepreneurs, some of whose companies have even won
international fame for their products.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China now has over 80,000 farm produce
markets, with a yearly turnover of 1,500 billion yuan, and some 10
percent of farmers have joined marketing or servicing cooperatives
to increase their sales.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the two-decade-old rural reform, the Chinese
government has successfully resolved the issues of feeding and
clothing its 1.2 billion-strong population, with the average
annual per-capita farm produce output actually exceeding the
world's level.
</P>
<P>
The fast development of the rural economy and the remarkable
increase in farmers' incomes have accelerated the integration
between cities and rural communities, which has helped China
achieve its ongoing sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, some experts say that farmers are still facing
problems and that these need to be addressed. They refer to the
difficulty in marketing farm produce, and the resultant slow-down
in their income growth. This has led to increasing economic
burdens in the last few years.
</P>
<P>
The government should speed up the ongoing grain circulation
system restructuring and increase investment in agriculture, in a
bid to stimulate farmers' enthusiasm, the experts say.

<HEADLINE> Probe Shows Soeharto Could Be Suspect of Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Attorney General
Andi M. Ghalib said Wednesday preliminary results of the ongoing
probe of the alleged ill-gotten wealth of former senior officials
indicate that former president Soeharto could become a suspect in
a corruption case.
</P>
<P>
"Based on the preliminary results, we see such indication.
However, we have to be careful, we have to do some
cross-checking," Ghalib told reporters before joining a cabinet
meeting here.
</P>
<P>
He said his office has summoned former senior officials,
including former ministers, to cross-check Soeharto's statements.
</P>
<P>
The questioning covered the national car company PT Timor Putra
National, which received unprecedented preferential treatment,
including tax exemptions and large sums of low-interest loans.
</P>
<P>
Ghalib called on the people to be patient and show wisdom in
waiting for the results of the investigations.
</P>
<P>
"There is no need to become emotional," he said.
</P>
<P>
When asked if Soeharto will be summoned again, he said, "After
all the questionings are completed, we will summon him again."
</P>
<P>
Soeharto was forced to step down on May 21 amid the country's
worst political and economic crisis in decades. He is accused of
corruption and abuse of power during his 32 years in power.
</P>
<P>
On December 9, the former president was questioned at Jakarta's
Higher Prosecutors Office and was asked 43 questions on his
alleged corrupt, collusive and nepotistic practices during his
rule.

expected to increase by three percent on the 1997 level.
</P>
<P>
"The continuing slow growth in rural income levels represents a
prominent problem China faces in the new stage of agricultural
development," according to Wan Baorui, vice minister of
Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Farmers have enjoyed constantly improving living standards
since 1980, with statistics showing that the average per capita
net income for Chinese farmers hit 2,090 yuan in 1997, a 3.4-fold
rise on the figure for two decades ago when allowing for price
hikes.
</P>
<P>
However, the slowdown in income increases has created a
bottleneck hindering the country's agricultural development, said
Wan.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the slowdown to the oversupply of certain farm
products, ailing rural enterprises and devastating summer flooding
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Wan pointed out that the government has attached great
importance to raising the income of farmers by stabilizing the
acreage of land dedicated to grain production, optimizing the
rural economic structure and accelerating the introduction of
agricultural technological.
</P>
<P>
"We must ease burdens on farmers and eliminate irrational
costs, according to Wan.

<HEADLINE> Pak, Tajikistan Call for End to Foreign Interference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan and Tajikistan have
called for end to foreign interference in the Afghan issue and
said "the Afghans should be allowed to sit together to find a
solution to the crisis themselves."
</P>
<P>
The appeal came Wednesday during the meeting between visiting
Tajik Foreign Minister Talbak Nazarov and his Pakistani
counterpart Sartaj Aziz.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the Foreign Ministry said that "the two
sides reiterated their commitment to the early establishment of
durable peace in Afghanistan and agreed to intensify their efforts
towards this end both bilaterally as well as through the `Six plus
Two' mechanism."
</P>
<P>
Nazarov arrived here Tuesday night on a two-day visit for talks
with Pakistani officials on the Afghan issue. Their discussion
Wednesday covered the entire range of bilateral relations and
focused in particular on the Afghan situation.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of Pakistan and Tajikistan emphasized
that there should be end to outside interference to the Afghan
issue and supply of arms in Afghanistan without which durable
peace would not be possible.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers agreed that the restoration of peace
and stability in Afghanistan was of utmost importance and would
not only benefit the Afghans but would also open up enormous
possibilities for the development of the entire region.
</P>
<P>
The Afghans should be allowed to sit together to find a
solution to the long-running Afghan crisis themselves, they said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers also said that the "Six plus Two"
(Afghanistan's six immediate neighbors plus Russia and the U.S.)
should play a supporting role to achieve peace in Afghanistan, and
Pakistan and Tajikistan should work together to achieve these
objectives.
</P>
<P>
Nazarov's visit is part of a series of intensified bilateral
consultations between Pakistan and countries bordering
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Siddique Khan
Kanju visited four Central Asian Republics in August and November
this year, and U.N. Special Envoy on the Afghan issue Lakhdar
Brahimi made a two-day visit to Pakistan early this month.

<HEADLINE> China Maintains Stable Currency (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PBOC Governor Dai Xianglong has consistently stressed the solid
foundation for a stable currency. For example, the Chinese economy
continues to enjoy sustained healthy development, with foreign
exchange reserves reaching 143.7 billion US dollars by the end of
October.
</P>
<P>
Dai said the figure continues to rise along with the increasing
trade surplus, balanced international payments, and flexible
exchange rate system based on market supply and demand.
</P>
<P>
A Beijing University Research Center report on the Chinese
economy notes that the stability of the yuan has helped maintain
the confidence of overseas investors, effectively reduced
financial risks on the domestic front and helped ensure the
stability of the Hong Kong dollar peg to the US dollar.
</P>
<P>
China's efforts to maintain the stability of the yuan have also
 improved the nation's status in the international
community. China's contributions to stablizing both the regional
and global economies have been acknowledged, and many foreign
government leaders have publically expressed their appreciation
and gratitude to the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
Economist Liu Guangcan noted the rationality of the current
yuan exchange rate when taking China's current accounts surplus in
recent years into consideration, as well as various other
important factors such as the foreign trade surplus, influx of
capital, inflation rate and money supply.
</P>
<P>
However, a point well worth noting is that China has maintained
a stable currency in spite of intense pressure from the Asian
financial crisis. Some people question China's ability to maintain
the stability of the yuan. Many experts dismiss the questions and
stress that China indeed has the ability to honor its pledge.
</P>
<P>
Noted economist Li Boxi pointed out that maintaining the
stability of the yuan has not been accomplished without certain
costs. The effort did however create a stable macroeconomic
environment for ensuring sustained economic growth. The the basic
factors underlining the stability of the yuan will carry over into
1999. No one should worry about the continued stability of the
currency.
</P>
<P>
Liu noted that the State Administration of Foreign Exchange
recently adopted a series of effective measures to verify the
authenticity of current accounts trade and reinforce foreign
exchange management under capital accounts. The fact that China
has cracked down firmly on illegal practices in the foreign
exchange sector will be beneficial for maintaining the stability
of the yuan exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
"Maintaining a stable yuan exchange rate and gradually
introducing a fully convertible currency represent long-term
targets for reform of the foreign exchange system," according to
Dai.

<HEADLINE> Koirala Wins Support to Form New Govt in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister of Nepal's
caretaker government Girija Prasad Koirala said here Wednesday
that he has won the support of 135 members in the Lower House of
Parliament, much more than needed to stake claim to power.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference that 84 lawmakers from his Nepali
Congress (NC), 48 from the Communist Party of Nepal (United
Marxism-Leninism, CPN-UML) and three from the Nepal Sadbhavana
Party had signed the letter supporting him to lead the new
coalition government.
</P>
<P>
King Birendra is expected to name Koirala Wednesday to form a
new coalition.
</P>
<P>
Koirala said that the cabinet will be announced after the new
government wins a confidence vote in the 205-seat Lower House.
</P>
<P>
He said that given the terrorist activities and the fluid
political situation in the country, there is no other alternative
to an all-party government for conducting free, fair and impartial
elections.
</P>
<P>
He said that fresh polls should be held by March/April 1999.
</P>
<P>
The political turmoil erupted when the Communist Party of Nepal
(Marxism-Leninism, CPN-ML) pulled out on December 10 after sharing
power with the NC for three and a half months.
</P>
<P>
It alleged that the NC had failed to enforce the agreements
reached with it and other left parties in August.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-ML and its supporters registered Sunday a no-confidence
motion against the NC government.
</P>
<P>
King Birendra had decided to call a special session of
parliament on Thursday as petitioned by the lawmakers of the
CPN-ML and its supporters.
</P>
<P>
But Koirala resigned Monday under an agreement with the CPN-UML
to make way for the formation of a new coalition to conduct fresh
elections, making the censure motion targetless.
</P>
<P>
Koirala told the press conference that the special parliament
session will be convened as scheduled because it is a
constitutional exercise.

<HEADLINE> China's Legislature to Review Eight Draft Laws (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 23 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislature, the
National People's Congress Standing Committee, began its new
bi-monthly session here today to examine three draft laws on
securities, the military services and a bill proposing the
establishment of a budgetary watchdog in the legislature.
</P>
<P>
The securities law, amendments to the military-service law and
amendments to the penal code concerning foreign-exchange-related
crimes are expected to be adopted in this session, according to an
agenda passed at the meeting today.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng, chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, presided over
today's meeting.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen additional major alterations were made to the draft
securities law to further protect investors from market risks
and set more comprehensive and specific standards for market
operations.
</P>
<P>
The amendments to the military-service law provides further
penalties for refusing to fulfill military-service
obligations.
</P>
<P>
The decision on punishing foreign-currency-related crimes
includes forgers of documents used to illegally obtain foreign
currencies as accomplices of those who actually receive the money,
and metes out even more severe punishment to the forgers.
</P>
<P>
Two other draft laws, the contract law, and the law on
administrative appeals, were re-tabled by the lawmakers today.
</P>
<P>
The latest draft of the contract law cancels the "changes of
national social and economic policy" as a factor for the
possible write-off of contracts, reflecting the lawmakers' wish
that such changes not affecting the execution of economic
contracts will not occur.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was also told that in formulating the law on
administrative appeals, the legislature encountered two
"complicated and major" issues: whether government decrees or
policies can be appealed, and whether the highest administrative
body, the State Council, will accept such appeals.

<HEADLINE> China Sets Priority for Energy Development  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 23 (Xinhua) -- China is stepping up its
development of energy reserves in a bid to meet basic energy
demands in the coming century and guarantee rapid economic and
social development.
</P>
<P>
According to a senior official with the State Development
Planning Commission, the country will pay equal attention to the
exploitation of energy resources and energy saving in the next
century.
</P>
<P>
Energy development will focus on power and be based on coal,
along with the vigorous expansion of petroleum, gas and nuclear
power and other new and renewable energy resources, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China will launch a series of strategic
drives in the next century. In the coal sector, the focus of
production will be shifted westward and efforts will be made to
expand the Shenfu and Dongsheng coal fields and improve coal
transportation.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the country will speed up the construction of
terraced hydroelectric power stations in river valleys and the
construction of power stations near coal mines.
</P>
<P>
In developing the petroleum industry, prominence will be given
to oil and gas exploitation in western China and in the
country's offshore areas.
</P>
<P>
In this way, a network of energy-supply bases will come into
being nationwide, with the provinces of Shanxi, Shaanxi,
Heilongjiang and Guizhou and western Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region as the major coal suppliers. The Daqing and Shengli oil
fields will remain the country's main oil suppliers.

<P>
According to the official, the upper reaches of the Yellow
River and the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River will
be bases for supplying hydropower nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Along with the development of conventional energy resources,
the country will still pay attention to the development of
geothermal energy, wind energy, solar energy and tidal energy, so
as to optimize the structure of energy consumption.
</P>
<P>
Experts here noted that China will achieve a balance between
supply and demand in energy resources in the early 21st century.
</P>
<P>
They also say that the current net export volume of 30 million
tons of coal will be further expanded in the early 21 century, but
net imports of oil will show no rapid increases.
</P>
<P>
It is projected that in the early 21st century, the total
consumption of the country's unrenewable energy resources will hit
the equivalent of 1.38 billion tons of standard coal, as coal
output reaches 1.45 billion tons.
</P>
<P>
By then, the country's annual production of oil and gas will
top 150 million tons and 25 billion cubic meters,
respectively. Also by that time, the country's major power grids
will be interconnected nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Experts are confident that China's energy production
and reserves will effectively guarantee social and economic
development in the century to come.

China Maintains Stable Currency (1)
</P>
<P>
BEIJING, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government stood
firmly by its pledge not to devalue the yuan (Renminbi) in spite
of sharp devaluations in many Asian currencies due to the
financial crisis engulfing the region.
</P>
<P>
The events of the past year prove that China has fulfilled its
promise.
</P>
<P>
The yuan exchange rate to the US dollar remains at the 8.27:1
level in place at the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
An even more encouraging aspect centers on the Chinese
government's early December pledge to maintain the stability of
the yuan in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The panic atmosphere sweeping Asia and bordering regions during
the ongoing crisis caused many people to question China's ability
to maintain a stable currency. Facts disproved frequent foreign
media predictions concerning devaluation of the yuan.
</P>
<P>
Experts note that the courage China has exhibited in making the
promise and success in keeping its word have fully demonstrated
the government's confidence and indeed ability to control the
domestic economy. They also point to the government's correct
assessment of both regional and global economic situations, as
well as the appropriateness of the macroeconomic and financial
policies.
</P>
<P>
"Maintaining the stability of the yuan represents a strategy
revolving around the global economy and Asian economies, as well
as China's long-term interests. It is also a promise based on the
nation's economic strength and management capabilities," according
to Liu Mingkang, deputy governor of the People's Bank of China
(PBOC).

<HEADLINE> Eight Million More Chinese Shake off Poverty This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 23 (Xinhua) -- China helped more than eight
million rural residents escape absolute poverty during 1998, but
nonetheless fell short of its target of providing a better life
for 10 million people.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Agriculture Chen Yaobang today attributed the
shortfall to heavy summer flooding in northeastern and southern
parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
He noted that related departments have not as yet determined
the final figure for the year. However, reports from key areas
confirm that at least eight million rural residents have escaped
poverty.
</P>
<P>
Chen said an estimated 40 million rural residents were living
in absolute poverty at the end of 1998, including more than 10
million disabled individuals and people unable to work, who will
obtain social relief funds to shake off poverty.
</P>
<P>
He said China will accelerate poverty relief efforts in
1999. Chen voiced confidence in China's ability to help the
majority of rural residents escape poverty and achieve its goal of
eliminated absolute poverty by the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Supports Call for Arab Summit on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Jordan supports the call by
Yemen to hold an Arab summit over Iraq, Jordanian Information
Minister Nasser Judeh has said.
</P>
<P>
"Jordan always supports calls for holding an Arab summit and is
ready to participate in any Arab meeting for the benefit of the
Arab world," Judeh was quoted Wednesday as saying by the Jordan
Times.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the remarks after Arab League Secretary
General Ahmed Esmat Abdel-Meguid contacted foreign ministers of
the 22 AL member countries on the request by Yemen to hold an Arab
summit on the Iraqi issue.
</P>
<P>
However, Jordanian officials said privately that such a summit
was unlikely to be held due to opposition from Kuwait and Saudi
Arabia, foes of Iraq during the 1990 Gulf crisis triggered by
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The summit, if held, would be the first since June 1996, shortly
after Benjamin Netanyahu's being elected Israeli prime minister
sparked fears among Arab countries that the peace process would be
set back.

<HEADLINE> Twelve Israeli Wounded in Hezbollah Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Twelve civilians in
Israel's northern towns have been confirmed wounded in rocket
attacks Wednesday morning, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The radio said that guerrilla groups of Hezbollah, or Party of
God, claimed responsibility for the attacks.
</P>
<P>
Among the wounded, one was moderately injured and the others
were lightly hurt, it added.
</P>
<P>
The attacks came one day after eight Lebanese civilians,
including a woman and her six children, were killed in an Israeli
air strike on suspected guerrilla bases in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The radio said the Israelis along the northern border had been
sent to the bomb shelters Tuesday night after Hezbollah vowed to
avenge what it called a "massacre" of innocent civilians.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a buffer zone in south Lebanon in 1985 after two
invasions, with the claimed aim to prevent cross-border attacks.
Hezbollah and other Lebanese guerrilla groups have been fighting
to end the Israeli occupation of the area, about one tenth of
Lebanese territory.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli security cabinet is expected to convene Wednesday
to discuss the escalated conflict in its self-styled security zone
in south Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Hunan TV, Radio Company Sells Shares on Shenzhen Exchange </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Hunan TV and Radio Industrial
(Holdings) Co. Ltd. today sold 50 million shares on the Shenzhen
Securities Exchange at 9.18 yuan per share.
</P>
<P>
An official of the exchange said Hunan TV is the first
television production company in the country approved by the China
Securities Regulatory Commission to raise funds through the stock
market, raising 446.2 million yuan from today's transactions.
</P>
<P>
Most of these funds will be used to import advanced equipment,
including a digital production system and equipment for shooting
and editing TV programs, said a company executive.
</P>
<P>
The company will also spend more than 60 million yuan
purchasing and upgrading the existing cable television network in
the city of Changsha, the provincial capital of Hunan.
</P>
<P>
As TV sets become more common in homes all across the country,
television advertising revenues continue to increase
sharply. Statistics show that about 80 percent of all advertising
spending goes into TV ads.
</P>
<P>
TV ads are also a major source of income for Hunan TV and Radio
Company, which last year earned 168 million yuan from these
ads. The company has now gained a 50-percent share of Hunan
Province's advertising market.
</P>
<P>
Hunan TV and Radio Company produces some 600 TV dramas and
other programs annually, accounting for 45 percent of Hunan
Province's total. Sixty percent of the TV programs now being seen
in the province are produced by the company, according to a
company executive.

<HEADLINE> Crash Not Airline Error, Says THAI </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Thai Airways International
(THAI) should not be blamed for the air crash earlier this month
which killed 101 people, airline officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The officials defended THAI's flight operations and insisted
they met international safety standards, saying the crash in
southern Thailand was not an error of the airline.
</P>
<P>
The causes of the crash, which happened in heavy rain in
southern Thailand, remained unknown until the flight data recorder
and pilot voice recorder are investigated by Airbus Industries in
Canada next month, according to the officials who refused to be
named.
</P>
<P>
THAI board chairman Mahidol Chantrangkurn said earlier that the
airline would be ready to disclose the causes of accident to the
public when the investigation was complete. The two recorders
would be sent to the aircraft manufacturer on January 2 and
results were expected in mid January.
</P>
<P>
"We ensure safety standards. This is the top priority for the
airline, followed by services, cost cutting and technological
development," said Mahidol.
</P>
<P>
However, Mahidol said that the airline will be required to
verify its operations later. There has been no impact on the
airline and flights remain fully booked on major routes.
</P>
<P>
Transport and Communications Minister Suthep Thuagsuban said
earlier that he wanted the existing board to stay on in order to
continue a privatization plan.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Upgrade Water Facilities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has worked out a program
for upgrading barrages and waterways, canals and pumping stations
across the country.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Public Works and Water Resources Mahmoud Abu Zeid
said Tuesday the program is aimed at increasing agricultural
production and rationalizing the use of water in irrigation, the
Egyptian Gazette newspaper reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Abu Zeid made the remarks during a ceremony held in al-Menoufia
Governorate to the north of Cairo for laying the foundation stone
of a viaduct across the el-Menoufi Canal.
</P>
<P>
He said the program is estimated to cost 5 billion Egyptian
pounds (1.47 billion U.S. dollars). But he did not say when the
program will be implemented.
</P>
<P>
The official said that his ministry has also started studies on
developing irrigation in the western Nile Delta, especially the
northern Wadi el-Natron, covering 200,000 feddans (84,000
hectares) of land, with a cost of 400 million pounds (118 million
dollars).
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the private sector will play a role in
developing irrigation and drainage foundations.
</P>
<P>
Farmers unions have been allowed to operate irrigation
foundations and distribute water in the Delta, the minister said,
adding that the step has resulted in a remarkable increase in the
agricultural production.

<HEADLINE> China's First Securities Law Being Proposed This Year (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 23 (Xinhua) - A draft of China's
long-awaited securities law is coming up for vote in the last few
days of this year.
</P>
<P>
The new 7-day session of China's top legislature, which started
in Beijing today, will put it to a vote by the end of the session,
according to an agenda that was passed today.
</P>
<P>
The 59-page draft for review by lawmakers has 15 major changes
from a previous version, including prohibition of state-owned
enterprises and banks from speculating in the market and
prohibition of foreign capital from entering the A-share market as
a protection of domestic investors, according to Qiao Xiaoyang,
the vice-chairman of the NPC Law Committee.
</P>
<P>
All the changes are meant to be a bulwark against market risks
and to improve the definition of market operations and increase
the transparency of government market controls, Qiao told the
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
If state-owned enterprises, with their colossal economic
muscle, or banks with their loans are allowed to speculate, they
could easily manipulate the market and further fuel speculation,
he warned, and they would put state assets in serious jeopardy.

<TEXT>
<P>
Controls on the movement of bank money to the securities market
by the government have been effective in preventing market crises
and should be put into law, the lawmakers were told.
</P>
<P>
The draft also has a two-tier system for brokerages requiring
stock brokers to keep their own trading accounts separate from
those of clients.
</P>
<P>
Qiao says that some brokers have been found to be
misappropriating their clients money for use in their own
accounts, and this is very risky.
</P>
<P>
To defend A-shares from foreign speculation the draft was
changed to read "a client must present an ID card proving Chinese
citizenship or a legal document that states qualifications to
represent a Chinese corporation before opening an account."
</P>
<P>
B-share markets for overseas investors have separate
regulations, the draft says.
</P>
<P>
Qiao says that China needs to have companies examined by the
government before they go public at the present stage, but some
legislators have complained that too much government intervention
leads to corruption and unfair practices.
</P>
<P>
To solve this problem, the draft sets down specific procedures
for government approval and the government has to provide an
explanation if a corporation is not allowed to list.

Other changes or additions include:
</P>
<P>
-- Public companies can not issue new stocks if they are found
to have diverted income from stocks to uses other than those
authorized by the board of investors;
</P>
<P>
-- To curb speculation, stock brokers are not allowed to sell
stocks that have been purchased earlier the same day;
</P>
<P>
-- The National Audit Office is responsible for supervising
the accounts of securities exchanges, brokerages, accounts
settling agencies, and government securities management agencies;
</P>
<P>
-- General managers of securities exchanges are to be
appointed by the State Council securities management agencies.
</P>
<P>
To warn investors of the risks of speculation, the draft
clearly points out that investors are solely responsible for gains
and losses in the market. However, government bonds are not
covered by the law, Qiao says.
</P>
<P>
This law, with revisions based on a review by legislators this
session, should be generally feasible and should play a positive
role in the development of China's securities market, he says.
</P>
<P>
Since the first stock was issued in Shanghai in 1990, China has
opened two securities exchanges, listing 827 publicly-held
companies, by 237 stockbrokers and many agencies. The value of the
Chinese stock market is 2 trillion yuan, or 23.4 percent of the
GDP.

<HEADLINE> Over 300 Military Weapons Surrendered in West </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Home Affairs Minister
Katele Kalumba has disclosed that the country's move to capture
illegal firearms has started paying dividends with about 350
weapons being surrendered in its Western Province alone.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held here Tuesday, Kalumba said the
illegal weapons were surrendered after two patrols of national
wildlife officers were sent to two areas in the province, Times
of Zambia reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to curb the country's ever rampant crime wave, the
Zambian government last month offered a month-old amnesty for
people with illegal firearms to surrender them to the police.
</P>
<P>
Zambia has been experiencing in the past months more and more
aggravated robberies, murders and other serious crimes committed
by criminals that are usually armed with deadly weapons.
</P>
<P>
The criminals have easy access to weapons since there are
about 68,000 private or illegal guns in the country with a
comparatively small population of 9.5 million.
</P>
<P>
Kalumba also warned that the government would take drastic
measures against those who failed to heed the amnesty on
firearms.
</P>
<P>
He further noted that organized crimes such as drug
trafficking, motor vehicle thefts and robberies were rampant in
the country.
</P>
<P>
On drug trafficking, the home minister said 4,314 suspects
were arrested between 1996 and June, 1998. Among them, 194 were
foreigners. Illegal drugs worth more than five million U.S.
Dollars were confiscated during the period.
</P>
<P>
Kalumba pledged his ministry's commitment to contain crimes by
using law enforcement agencies to the fullest.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Legislature Setting Up Budget Watchdog </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 23 (Xinhua) - The Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress (NPC), China's top legislative body,
plans to set up a special sub-committee, the Budgetary Work
Committee, to oversee the nation's budget.
</P>
<P>
A bill to this effect proposed by the chairman and
vice-chairmen of the Standing Committee was submitted to the full
session of the standing committee today.
</P>
<P>
The committee will strengthen the legislative function by
validating the national budget with better allocation of the
budget, based on the reality and reflecting the interests of the
people, according to He Chunlin, secretary-general of the
NPC Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
Understanding the budget requires a special expertise, he
points out, and without a special sub-committee, the budgets of
the past were ratified by the legislature in a procedural way,
without studying the substance, even though it is related to the
country's social and economic affairs and macro-economic
controls. And, effective control of the budget is related to
social and economic development, state security, and the standard
of living, he says.
</P>
<P>
The proposal suggests the sub-committee be charged with the
following duties:
</P>
<P>
-- Assisting the NPC and its Standing Committee in examining
the nation's budget, budget adjustment plans, and implementation;
</P>
<P>
-- Working out and studying drafts of laws related to finance,
the budget, and taxes and related laws and regulations, with
authorization from the NPC Standing Committee chairman and
vice-chairmen;
</P>
<P>
-- Carrying out other tasks of the NPC Standing Committee
chairman and vice-chairmen and assisting the NPC Finance and
Economic Committee.
</P>
<P>
The proposal also suggests Guo Zhenqian, the vice-chairman of
the NPC Finance and Economic Committee and former auditor-general
of the National Audit Office, head the sub-committee.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Cataract Patients Benefit From Inexpensive Lens Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SUZHOU, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Millions of cataract patients
across China will be able to have their eyesight restored by
paying much less for new artificial lenses which started rolling
off the production on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The producers of these intraocular lenses (IOL), a key material
which must be implanted during cataract surgery, will turn out
100,000 lenses next year, and will double the annual output by the
year 2000, according to the IOL plant in the city of Suzhou in
east China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
Increased production will help keep the price for each IOL
under 10 U.S.dollars from their current cost of 300-1,000 yuan
(36-125 dollars), making them much more affordable for most
Chinese patients, according to Zhou Yongyao, director of the
Suzhou General Factory of Medical Instruments.
</P>
<P>
He also promised to keep the price unchanged in the next decade
while the factory supplies IOLs to ophthalmological institutions
and national medical teams which travel nationwide to perform
operations on patients in poor and remote areas.
</P>
<P>
Among the nine million blind people in China, four million
cannot see because of cataract. Public health experts fear that
cases of cataract blindness may increase among an increasingly
elderly and growing population.
</P>
<P>
The IOL plant, involving s total investment of five million
yuan, is an important part of Sight First China Action, a
rehabilitation project jointly launched last year by Lions Clubs
International, the Chinese Disabled Persons Federation (CDPF) and
the Ministry of Health.
</P>
<P>
The project aims to perform 1.75 million cataract operations
for patients across China over a five year period, as well as to
provide better facilities and training for local ophthalmologists,
said Kajit Habanananda, president of Lions Clubs International.
</P>
<P>
"With the opening of the new IOL plant, we are able to help
even more people regain their eyesight and see the world again,"
the president said at the opening ceremony Tuesday in Suzhou.
</P>
<P>
Experts with the CDPF estimate that the rate of IOL implants
among cataract patients will rise to over 40 percent, from the 20
percent in 1995.

<HEADLINE> China's Social Science Academy Needs More Innovation: Li </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Li Tieying, president of the
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS), said today that social
sciences should become part of the process of establishing a
national innovation system.
</P>
<P>
He said that the new system should not merely encourage
developments in the natural sciences, engineering, and technology,
but should also benefit the upgrading of people's values and the
social and economic systems.
</P>
<P>
China developed a plan last year for a national innovation
system to improve its competitiveness by building top research
institutes and expertise. The program is now being studied by the
Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Li says that, in the 21st century, national economic
development will to a great degree be based on knowledge,
including knowledge in the humanities and social sciences, and
that CASS should have a bigger say in this.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar drifted
off further Wednesday, suffering the effects of weak commodity
prices and thin pre-Christmas trade.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed at 61.39 U.S. cents from 61.47
late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Commodity prices remained at low levels with the commodity
research bureau index closing at 189.11 points.
</P>
<P>
The local currency slipped lower Tuesday night in offshore
trade on the bearish outlook for commodity prices.
</P>
<P>
Foreign exchange dealers said the soft volumes exaggerated the
downward move in the Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
At the close the Australian dollar was trading at 71.41
Japanese yen from 71.95 and 1.0239 German marks from 1.0297.
</P>
<P>
The local currency is expected to continue to trade in the
tight range Thursday, ahead of the Christmas break.
</P>
<P>
The week between Christmas and the New Year is not expected
much busier in terms of volume, though some market participants
have speculated the Australian dollar may fall off to the
60.00-U.S.-cent level.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania: Foreign Troops in Congo for Own </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 23 (Xinhua) - Tanzania has blamed the
escalation of war in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) on
the military involvement by some African countries to "safeguard
their own interests", according to an official communique
released here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Minister for Foreign Affairs and International
Co-operation Jakaya Kikwete, quoted by the communique, said
Tuesday that the crisis in DRC could easily turn into a war in
the Great Lakes region because of foreign intervention.
</P>
<P>
"The situation in the DRC is being worsened by the involvement
of foreign countries in the conflict which are safeguarding their
interests," Kikwete said.
</P>
<P>
However, Kikwete, who just returned from a meeting of
Organization of African Unity (OAU) held in Ougadougou, Burkina
Faso, said that some encouraging efforts have been made as key
players in the crisis began to meet.
</P>
<P>
"Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe and Rwandan Vice President
Paul Kagame met last week," he said. "It is encouraging to see
the two leaders who are on opposite sides of the conflict
meeting."
</P>
<P>
Claiming to be neutral in the DRC conflict, Tanzania recalled
its military advisors immediately after the conflict broke out on
August 2 while other neighboring countries rushed their troops to
either side of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
The war has so far already drawn in Angola, Namibia, Zimbabwe,
Sudan, and Chad on the DRC President Laurent Kabila's side while
the Tutsi-led rebels are reportedly backed by Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Kikwete said that the Fourth Ordinary Session of the Central
Organ of the OAU Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management
and Resolution held on December 17 has persuaded the concerned
countries to pull out of the DRC in order to find a lasting
peaceful solution.
</P>
<P>
He expressed optimism about signing of a cease-fire agreement
between warring parties at a two-day regional summit expected to
convene in Lusaka at the end of this month and the subsequent
deployment of a UN peacekeeping force in the DRC to monitor to
the peace process.

<HEADLINE> China Plans To Reform Social Science Academy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 23 (Xinhua) -- China released its plan here
today for reforming the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS)
to create a responsibility system.
</P>
<P>
It means that researchers' incomes will be linked to their
academic record to some extent, and institutes will have greater
decision-making power.
</P>
<P>
There will also be an attempt to raise funds from different
sources instead of mainly relying on government funding.
</P>
<P>
Contacts with foreign academia will be encouraged and the
number of academic committees at both the academy and institute
levels will be increased.
</P>
<P>
The academy will also dismiss unqualified researchers. Since
1977, when CASS was established, it has had an "iron rice bowl"
system, where researchers get equal pay no matter what they do.
</P>
<P>
The reform will also make CASS's logistics departments
independent entities or companies to compete in the market. And,
researchers will no longer qualify for entirely free medical care
and housing.
</P>
<P>
Observers say that the reforms will make the 4,000-person
institute more vigorous as it tries to become an authentic academy
with international influence.

BEIJING, December 23 (Xinhua) -- China had 22.63 million mobile

</P>
<P>
This was an increase of 71 percent from the beginning of the

China took ten years to get the first ten million, but only 17
months to add an additional ten million people by September of

<P>
However, this just adds a new one to many vivid examples
showing the vulnerability of the structure-unbalanced Kenyan
economy, mainly propped up by tourism and several cash crops like
tea and coffee.
</P>
<P>
The figures showpercent73projects

</P>
<P>
President Moi recently declared a war against embezzlement of
public funds and urged all public servants to have a duty and
moral obligation to serve the public with utmost honesty.
</P>
<P>
Throughout 1998, the government has been successful in
carrying out tight policies to curb inflation, the public
spending and interest rates while improving infrastructure,
especially roads, and expanding markets in east and southern
Africa.
</P>
<P>
In addition, various economic sectors such as trade,
industrial development and telecommunications are taking measures
to speed up their reform and liberalization processes so as to
raise their efficiency and lure domestic and foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
But local analysts said they are afraid that lack of good
results from the anti-graft campaign will frustrate governmental
morals and efforts to recover investors' confidence, as in the
IMF case, and finally to kill efforts to revamp the economy.
</P>
<P>
Hope lies in deepened reforms, they said, Kenya should take
bolder political and economic measures to crack down on
corruption, to reshape the socio-economic system, to boost
manufacturing and narrow the gap between the rich and the poor,
so as to accumulate needed economic momentum.
</P>
<P>
As a new millennium is approaching, it is high time that Kenya
should make urgent efforts to embark on a sound development cycle
to realize a stable and sustainable economic growth.

ABU DHABI, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates'
decision to join a United Nations agreement to combat
desertification reflected its policy to protect the environment,
a senior official has said.
</P>
<P>
Salem Masri Al Dhaheri, director of the Federal Environmental
Agency told the Gulf News daily Tuesday that the UAE has
officially joined the agreement on October 21, after the Foreign
Ministry submitted its ratification document to the U.N..
</P>
<P>
"According to the agreement, the UAE's membership will start
on January 19, 1999," said Al Dhaheri.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, the signatories should be committed
to fighting desertification and drawing up effective and long-term
strategies towards that end.
</P>
<P>
Till August 1997, 107 countries have joined the agreement, out
of which 16 are Arab countries.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan MPs Vow to Remove Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Some members of Ugandan
parliament have vowed to fight on with the censure motion against
State Minister in charge of Investment Sam Kuteesa in spite of a
threat by President Yoweri Museveni that he would not take action
without facts.
</P>
<P>
They made the decision Tuesday at a parliament session, the
New Vision daily reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Parliament passed a resolution Monday requesting the
president to relieve the minister of his duties.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting of the ruling National Resistance
Movement at the International Conference Center Tuesday, Museveni
said the privatization probe report of the Parliament was
superficial and not properly researched.
</P>
<P>
The MPs said Museveni's threats were uncalled for and that he
was misdirecting his anger on them because he was misinformed by
his ministers.
</P>
<P>
Veteran politician Sam Njuba was quoted as saying that
Museveni would be breaking the Constitution if he does not take
action on Kuteesa.
</P>
<P>
One popular opinion is that Museveni would not take action
against this minister because his wife is the first lady's
sister.
</P>
<P>
However, Museveni has told the general public that the
government is never lack of political will to remove corrupt
officials from the ruling class.

"The militaristic action against Iraq, conducted in the
immediate proximity to the southern borders of the Commonwealth
of Independent States, should seriously prompt the strengthening
of the defense capability of not only Russia but the CIS as a
whole," said Gennady Seleznyov, speaker of the State Duma, or
lower house of parliament. "We must start developing our common
defense doctrine so that in the future no one could have
illusions about the possibility of knocking us off one by one,"
Seleznyov's spokesman Mikhail Belyat quoted him as saying. He
also urged the United Nations to immediately start an inquiry
into the activity of Richard Butler as head of the U.N. Special

lowering of lending rate. The ECB wanted to maintain this rate
for the "foreseeable future," he added. With starting of the Euro

<HEADLINE> First Octuplets' Parents Thank Worldwide Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The parents of the
world's first octuplets born alive expressed their thanks Tuesday
for the support they received from the world over.
</P>
<P>
"We are very appreciative of the worldwide support over the
past few days, particularly the prayers and spiritual connection
at this time of the year," Nkem Chukwu and Iyke Louise Udobi said
in a statement released by Texas Children's Hospital in Houston,
where their babies are under intensive care.
</P>
<P>
The couple, who are Nigerian Americans, also thanked the
physicians, nurses and staff of the hospital, saying that all of
the family's concern at this time are the mother and the babies.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the hospital in its seventh online press briefing
on Tuesday afternoon said that there has been an outpouring of
concern and warm wishes for this family from all over the world.
"Companies, organizations and individuals have already begun
calling in donations for Ms. Chukwu and the octuplets," it said.
</P>
<P>
Hospital sources said the mother is in good condition and has
shown marked improvement since surgery early Monday morning to
control bleeding. Her physicians said that if she continues to
improve at this rate, she would be discharged later in the week.
</P>
<P>
The octuplets remain in critical condition in the neonatal
intensive care unit at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
At this time, the baby girl born on December 8 is being fed
formula through a nasogastric tube. The other seven babies, born
on December 20, are receiving total parenteral nutrition, a combi
nation of proteins, fats, electrolytes, glucose, vitamins and
minerals.
</P>
<P>
Five of the octuplets were examined Tuesday by cardiologists
and received echocardigrams to rule out a problem common in
premature births called patent ductus arteriosis. The fifth baby
was diagnosed with this problem and will be treated with
medication.
</P>
<P>
All eight are responsive to sound and light but remain
undisturbed and quiet on warming beds, the hospital said.
</P>
<P>
"The good news is that there hasn't been any dramatic change in
 the babies' conditions," the hospital said. "We don't look for
significant changes -- we're happy with small progressions."

<HEADLINE> Jordan Hopes Early Israeli Elections Won`t Affect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Jordan hopes the decision by the
Israeli Knesset (parliament) to hold early elections won`t affect
the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the peace process will continue, and that the
move in Israel to hold early elections will not cause a delay in
peace making," Foreign Minister Abdul Ilah Khatib was quoted as
saying Wednesday by the Jordan Times.
</P>
<P>
He said the kingdom will deal with the Israeli government
regardless of who is in power, but hoped that the peace process
"will not be held hostage" by internal political developments in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Knesset Monday approved at first reading, by 81 to
30 votes, a bill calling for early elections.
</P>
<P>
Two more readings are needed over the next few weeks for the
bill to become law, bringing elections both for the parliament and
the post of prime minister within three to six months instead of
in November 2000.

GUIYANG, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Guizhou
Province recently commenced an afforestation project in the
Huangguoshu Falls Scenic Zone.
</P>
<P>
The Huangguoshu Falls, China's largest and the symbol of
Guizhou, attract large numbers of tourists.
</P>
<P>
The fact that forests cover only 10.6 percent of the area
surrounding the zone has affected the Huangguoshu Falls
environment.
</P>
<P>
Guizhou has earmarked seven million yuan for the first phase
afforestation project, and plans to plant trees on 2,000 hectares
over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
The project will not only improve the environment, but will
also help local residents escape poverty by planting trees, herbs
and flowers.

<HEADLINE> Settling Question Of Nationality Of Macao Residents (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 23 (Xinhua) -- China plans to deal with the
question of the nationality of the residents of Macao in a
flexible way that does not violate the basic principles of China's
Nationality Law, to maintain Macao's prosperity and stability,
according to Zhang Chunsheng, deputy director of the Standing
Committee of the National People's Congress's Legislative Work
Committee.
</P>
<P>
Zhang was explaining a draft of China's Nationality Law in the
Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) to the sixth meeting of
the NPC Standing Committee today.
</P>
<P>
The draft was submitted to the NPC Standing Committee today for
examination, with suggestions by the NPC Preparatory Committee for
the Macao SAR.
</P>
<P>
It says that all Macao residents of Chinese descent who were
born on Chinese territory (including Macao) and those who meet the
requirements of China's Nationality Law are Chinese citizens
weather they hold a Portuguese travel certificate and identity
card or not.
</P>
<P>
People of both Chinese and Portuguese descent can choose
Chinese or Portuguese citizenship freely, but only one.
</P>
<P>
So, before choosing their citizenship, Macao SAR residents
enjoy the rights set forth in the Macao SAR Basic Law before
choosing citizenship, but not rights restricted by the
nationality.

ANKARA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news

<P>
Turkish Daily News
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish Ambassador to Italy Inal Batu said that the attitude
of Italy regarding the case of Kurdish rebel chief Abdullah Ocalan
has shifted positively.
</P>
<P>
Batu said that "our priority is Ocalan's prosecution. If Ocalan
goes to a third country, we will demand the same thing from that
third country as well."
</P>
<P>
Zaman (Time)
</P>
<P>
-- All eyes are focused on Turkish President Suleyman Demirel
over whom he will name next prime minister designate after
Democratic Left Party leader Bulent Ecevit returned his mandate
for government formation to Demirel on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National)
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish True Path Party leader and former prime minister
Tansu Ciller insisted that the prime minister designate should be

<HEADLINE> Settling Question of Nationality of Macao Residents (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Zhang says that it is absolutely necessary to explain the
citizenship issue at an early stage because of a number of issues
like qualifications of the Chief Executive of the Macao SAR and
leading government officials, the chairman and vice-chairmen of
the Legislative Council, the president of the court of final
Appeal, and deputies to the NPC in the Macao SAR, SAR visas, and
the identity of Macao permanent residents, and the definition of
the identity of Chinese citizens in Macao in accordance with the
Nationality Law.
</P>
<P>
He says that the draft states that Macao residents of both
Chinese and Portuguese blood can not be Chinese citizens naturally
before choosing citizenship.
</P>
<P>
The freedom to choose citizenship reflects the principle of
flexibility that is conducive to the smooth transition and
transfer of power in Macao, Zhang says.
</P>
<P>
The draft also states that Chinese citizens in Macao with
Portuguese travel documents and residence rights in other
countries can travel to other countries and regions with the
proper documents but in the Macao SAR and other parts of China do
not have their rights protected by Portuguese and other foreign
consulates because they hold such documents.
</P>
<P>
The more than 100,000 Chinese citizens in Macao who hold
Portuguese passports, Zhang says, are not recognized by the
Chinese Government in their Portuguese citizenship and if they do
not want to choose Chinese citizens, they can give it up after the
Macao SAR is founded.
</P>
<P>
The draft also says that Macao residents who are Chinese
citizens returning from overseas before or after the founding of
the SAR can apply for a change of citizenship at Macao SAR
departments.

<HEADLINE> Heart Disease, Cancer, Australians' Biggest Killers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Heart disease and cancer
remained the biggest killers of Australians last year, official
figures showed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) said 28 percent of
deaths were caused by heart disease and 27 percent by cancer.
</P>
<P>
External causes, including car accidents, falls, drowning and
suicide accounted for six percent of all deaths.
</P>
<P>
People aged 65 or over accounted for 78 percent of all deaths,
the ABS said.
</P>
<P>
The figures also showed that for men aged from 20 to 69 years,
those who had never married died at rates two to four times higher
than for those who had tied the knot.
</P>
<P>
Single women also died at a higher rate than their married
counterparts, but by much smaller margins.
</P>
<P>
Overall, married people experienced lower rates of death than
those who were divorced, widowed or never married.
</P>
<P>
The ABS said Australians are among the most long-lived people
in the world, with life expectancies approaching those of people
born in Japan, Sweden, Hong Kong and Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
A boy born in Australia could expect to live for 75.6 years,
while a baby girl could expect to live for 81.3 years.
</P>
<P>
Over the last 25 years, life expectancy at birth has increased
by about eight years for males and seven years for females.
</P>
<P>
Although Australia's population is both increasing and aging,
resulting in a rise in the absolute number of deaths, the death
rates for people of almost all ages are falling.
</P>
<P>
Births still outnumber deaths by about two-to-one. In 1997
there were 129,400 deaths and 252,100 births.

<HEADLINE> China Successful In Stopping Forex Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 23 (Xinhua) -- China has cracked down on
fraud and foreign exchange crimes to enforce the law and insure
its balance of payments and the stability of the renminbi.
</P>
<P>
There was a slower increase in China's foreign exchange
reserves this year in spite of a favorable foreign trade balance
and increased investment from abroad.
</P>
<P>
China had a balance of 26.7 billion U.S. dollars and 24 billion
U.S. dollars worth of direct foreign investment in the
January-July period, but foreign exchange reserves increased by
only 700 million U.S. dollars during the period.
</P>
<P>
An investigation has shown that various illegal activities were
the main cause of the slow increase. So, in June, the State
Council, China's highest governing body, instructed banks
and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) for a
national check on the use of foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
For the past six months, SAFE has examined customs declarations
worth more than 200,000 U.S. dollars and more each and has found
1.2 billion U.S. dollars worth of fraudulent behavior committed by
627 enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Public Security departments have 230 cases for investigation
and prosecution, involving 3.6 billion U.S. dollars and 3.9
billion HK dollars.
</P>
<P>
On October 7, SAFE decided to give lenient treatment to
enterprises committed fraud of more than 5 million U.S. dollars
if they would confess to their crimes, and by the end of October,
over 1,000 enterprises had confessed wrongdoings.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that these cases reveal the problems involved in
trying to enforce financial discipline and the lack of
controls. The state plans to tighten controls and to put an
on-line nationwide customs declaration inspection system into
operation next year.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The China National Offshore
Oil Corp (CNOOC) expects to produce 16.4 million tons of crude oil
by the end of this year in a continued increase in offshore oil
production for five consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
According to a senior CNOOC official, it has made an effort to
maintain offshore oil production amidst dropping oil prices and
production. The country has given priority to offshore oil
exploration this year and has invited foreign cooperations in oil
and gas exploration in the South China Sea, East China Sea and
Yellow Sea.
</P>
<P>
CNOOC has signed more than 130 oil contracts and agreements
with at least 70 oil companies from 18 countries and regions, with
total foreign investment amounting to 6.4 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The official says that CNOOC has had an astonishing 80 percent
success rate in offshore wildcat drilling this year, and expects
to find an additional 130 million tons of proven oil reserves and
10 billion cu.m. of proven gas reserves by the end of this year.

<HEADLINE> Extremist Group in Philippines Plans Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 23 (Xinhua) --The Abu Sayyaf Group, an
extremist group based in the Southern Philippines, plans to stage
retaliatory attacks following the killing of its leader last week,
a rebel group said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ustadz Shariff Julabbi, spokesman of the rebel Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF), said in Mindanao that at any given time
attacks may happen anywhere in provinces of Zamboanga del Norte
and Zamboanga del Sur, should security forces give the extremist
group the chance to do it.
</P>
<P>
Abu Sayyaf leader Abdurajak Abubakar Janjalani was killed in an
encounter with the police in Southern Mindanao on December 18.
</P>
<P>
Janjalani, the most wanted criminal in the country, was
responsible for a series of kidnapping, extortion and bombing
incidents in Mindanao. His group killed over 50 civilians in the
town of Ipil, Mindanao, in April l996.
</P>
<P>
The MILF spokesman said that the followers of Janjalani are
greatly affected by his death especially when he was slain while
the Muslim community was observing Ramadan, an Islamic religious
activity, during which strict fasting was being observed from dawn
until sunset.
</P>
<P>
"The MILF expressed condolences to the family of Janjalani not
as a bandit leader but as a Muslim brother," he said.
</P>
<P>
Southern Command Chief Angelo Reyes said Tuesday the Abu Sayyaf
group has more or less 400 members, 30 of whom were direct
followers of the slain leader and are based in the southern
province of Basilan.

<HEADLINE> Stranded Somali Refugees Returning Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 23 (Xinhua) -- More than half of some 800
Somali refugees stranded in Kenya's Indian Ocean port city of
Mombasa left by sea at mid-night Tuesday for the Kismayu port in
southern Somalia.
</P>
<P>
They were provided with three ships by Moslem businessmen in
Mombasa after the nearby Jomvu Refugee Camp where they have been
staying for more than seven years was demolished by Kenyan
authorities last week.
</P>
<P>
Jomvu camp, which originally hosted more than 100,000 Somali
refugees, has finally closed, four years after Kenyan President
Daniel arap Moi ordered all refugees to leave Coast Province, the
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said in a statement
available Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Two UNHCR-organized convoys left Jomvu for Kakuma Refugee Camp
in northern Rift Valley Province last week, relocating some 750
refugees there.
</P>
<P>
The rest, about 158 families comprising some 800 people who
opted to return home, were dumped at Fort Jesus Museum in Mombasa
Sunday. They would receive three months of food aid from the
World Food Program, said the UNHCR.
</P>
<P>
Kenya shelters 188,000 refugees in the northeastern Dadaab and
northwestern Kakuma refugee camps, down from a maximum of 420,000
persons in 1992 following large scale repatriation to Somalia and
Ethiopia and the resettlement of more than 35,000 refugees to
third countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Liao Keli, an eight-year-old
boy in the Chinese city of Chongqing, southwest China, recently
got 340,000 yuan (40,000 U.S. dollars) in compensation for an
injury he received, the largest payment of its kind in China.
</P>
<P>
Liao sued the Chongqing Trolleybus Company and Chongqing
Electric Industry Company because of an electric shock he got from
trolleybus wires 3 years ago. He had to undergo 13 operations,
with great pain, for a two and a half year period.
</P>
<P>
In another case, a woman in Beijing got 260,000 yuan for mental
anguish caused by malpractice, when a physician left a piece of
gauze in her abdominal area after performing an appendectomy.
</P>
<P>
Qian Yuan, a 19-year-old college student who received 250,000
yuan in compensation for mental anguish, says, "We should learn to
use the law to protect our rights when we are wronged." She filed
the suit after security guards at a supermarket belonging to
Shanghai Watson Consumer Products Corporation forced her to strip
for an examination when they suspected her of being a pickpocket.
</P>
<P>
"We are happy to see that changes have taken place in this and
that the compensation payments better reflect the degree of mental
anguish," says Lu Lei, a lawyer. Lu explains that, although the
damage is not tangible, it causes great suffering to the victims,
and compensation in the past was generally very little and did not
teach others a lesson.
</P>
<P>
China used to pay little attention to compensating these
victims because of traditional ideas that human dignity could not
have a money value placed on it.
</P>
<P>
But, greater contact with other countries since the reforms and
opening up began, has made the Chinese understand the importance
of reparations, and the number of mental anguish cases has been on
the rise in recent years. There were only 13,565 such cases from
1988 to 1992, or 1.73 percent of the total number of cases.
</P>
<P>
China plans to have more specific laws in this field in the
future to ensure ample mental protection, says Zou Tingqing, the
vice-president of the Chongqing Supreme People's Court.

<HEADLINE> hke122324 - Malaysia Investigates Japan's Self-Copy Paper Dumping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia has started
preliminary investigations into the dumping of self-copy paper
from Japan which caused material injury to the Malaysian industry
producing self-copy paper, the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The government's action was based on sufficient evidence that
this product dumping had indeed occurred in the country, thus
causing material injury to the Malaysian industry producing
self-copy paper, the ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
It said if the determination is affirmative, the government may
impose an anti-dumping duty at a level that would eliminate the
dumping which causes material injury.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry, allegations were made by a domestic
self-copy paper producer -- Gamuda Paper Industries Bhd that the
imports of self-copy paper from Japan are being made in the
country and the alleged product is being sold in Malaysia at a
price that is much lower than the level at which it is being sold
in Japan, thus having a negative impact on the Malaysian domestic
industry.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has imposed anti-dumping duties on the same product
against Indonesia and the European Union (EU) since April 20,
1997.

BEIJING, December 23 (Xinhua) -- China expects to maintain
grain output at 490 million tons, this year's total, or above next
year, said
</P>
<P>
Minister of Agriculture Chen Yaobang at a press conference

<P>
BEIJING, December 23 (Xinhua) -- China's 1998 grain harvest is
expected to reach last year's level of 490 million tons, according
to Minister of Agriculture Chen Yaobang.
</P>
<P>
Chen pointed to a drop in the cotton output was lower than last
year, but noted that the total output of more than 4.2 million tons
will meet demand on the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
Output levels for oil, sugar, vegetables and fruit surpassed
1997 levels, with meat output rising four percent and milk by six
percent.
</P>
<P>
Total output for aquatic products grew five percent to 38
million tons.
</P>
<P>
Township enterprises achieved a total value-added of 2,400
billion yuan, up 17 percent on the 1997 figure. Related
enterprises created some three million new jobs for rural
residents during the year.
</P>
<P>
Chen also pointed to a one million hectare increase in land
dedicated to autumn crops.
</P>
<P>
He said the government adopted a series of measures to
reinforce the household contract system and reduce financial
burdens of farmers.
</P>
<P>
Favorable autumn weather conditions helped to secure the year's
bumper harvest, according to Chen.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Export Declines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh earned 1.655 billion
U.S. dollars from export during the first four months of the
current fiscal year between July 1998 and June 1999, about 14
percent short of the targeted 1.933 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The figure represents a 5-percent negative growth compared with
the earnings made during the corresponding period of the previous
fiscal year, The Daily Star Business reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The fall in the earnings would make it difficult to reach the
country's export target of 5.8 billion dollars for the current
fiscal year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
During the July-October period, the export of raw jute and jute
products were 60.83 percent and 11.88 percent respectively short
of the original targets, the report quoted Export Promotion Bureau
officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
The exports of leather, handicraft, knitwear and chemical
products were all less than the targets. And the export of
garments, the country's major foreign exchange earner, also
registered a 9.69-percent fall.
</P>
<P>
Only tea and frozen foods recorded increases in export
earnings, of 12.9 percent and 14.86 percent respectively over the
targets.
</P>
<P>
The fall in export earnings has caused deep concern in the
government, and the National Export Committee would discuss the
situation on Thursday, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The devastating flood that hit the country and the higher
currency devaluation in some Asian countries that export similar
items are two factors causing the sharp fall in Bangladesh's
export, a report in The Financial Express daily said.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Fire Katyusha Rockets at North Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 23 (Xinhua) -- After eight Lebanese civilians
were killed in Israeli air raids, scores of Katyusha rockets were
fired Wednesday morning into Israel's northern areas, the Orient
radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Israeli media and officials said at least 10 Israelis were
injured in the attack.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has
claimed responsibility for the attack.
</P>
<P>
The Katyusha rockets are always used by Hezbollah as a means to
revenge Israeli killing of Lebanese civilians.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday afternoon, eight Lebanese civilians, including a woman
and her six children, were killed in Israel's air raids on Jinta
area near the country's eastern city of Belbek.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli strikes have raised to 28 the number of Lebanese
civilians killed in south Lebanon since the start of this year,
setting off outrage across the country.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese permanent representative to the United Nations Samir
Mubarak was instructed by Prime Minister Salim Hoss to submit to
the U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan a note of protest
containing the pictures of the killed woman and her children.
</P>
<P>
He asked Annan to distribute copies of the protest note among
the U.N. Security Council member states and the general assembly.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a self-styled security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
cross-border attack by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Spearheaded by Hezbollah, Lebanon's resistance movement has
since been fighting to oust the Israeli occupation forces.

<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, December 23 (Xinhua) -- About 500 soldiers, wearing
masks and anti-chemical clothes, Wednesday began to put 3,000 tons
of suspected Taiwanese industrial toxic wastes, dumped about 15 km
near Sihanoukville, into more than 10,000 gas barrels before
shipping them back to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The barrels will be welded shut before being stored in larger
containers until the wastes can be shipped back to Taiwan. The
cleanup could take up to at least ten days.
</P>
<P>
The suspected toxic wastes, shipped from Taiwan on November 30
by a local company Muth Vuthy, caused violent protests at the
weekend and panic among the residents. About ten thousand
residents were trying to flee to the capital Phnom Penh, fearing
being affected by the wastes.
</P>
<P>
Protests were fueled by reports that some people were dead and
others had fallen ill because of the wastes. Sihanoukville
Hospital reported one port worker dead and two others ill, but
medical workers could not confirm whether the cases were related
to the wastes.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that at least four died and 18 injured in the
protest and road accidents as residents flee the town.
</P>
<P>
Eight experts on chemical and hazardous waste from the Thai
Army arrived at Sihanoukville Tuesday to inspect the dump site and
plan to take a sample back to Bangkok for testing.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Malaysia's Political Stability Tested in 1998 (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Political tranquillity
enjoyed by Malaysians for many years was challenged in the year of
1998 in the wake of the sacking of deputy prime minister and
finance minister Anwar Ibrahim, an event sparking off an
undeniably difficult time for Malaysians.
</P>
<P>
The sacking of Anwar on September 2 amidst allegations of
sexual misconduct and his expulsion a day later from Malaysia's
largest ruling party -- the United Malays National Organization
(UMNO), of which he was the deputy president, for "low morals" --
were described as "the most shocking developments in Malaysia's
politics in recent years."
</P>
<P>
Anwar was brought into the government by Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad in 1982, appointed Deputy Prime Minister on
December 1, 1993, and declared on several occasions as Mahathir's
successor.
</P>
<P>
The political rupture between Mahathir, who is UMNO president,
and Anwar was however reportedly partly due to their odds over
monetary policies in dealing with the prevailing regional
financial crisis which dragged Malaysia's economy into recession
with gross domestic product declining 2.8 percent, 6.8 percent and
8.6 percent respectively in the first three quarters of the year.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir favored stimulating business with lower interest rates
while Anwar adhered to International Monetary Fund (IMF) style
policies particularly in maintaining tight monetary policies
including high interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian government is currently implementing expansionary
fiscal and monetary policies instead of the tight fiscal and
monetary polices pursued last year and early this year to
stimulate domestic consumer and economic activities.
</P>
<P>
After his dismissal, Anwar traveled around the country to
address public gatherings, calling for Mahathir's resignation and
reforms. He was arrested by police at his house on September 20
after addressing an illegal gathering of his supporters earlier in
the day at the National Mosque here, who later turned violent.
Anwar was detained the next day under the Internal Security Act.
</P>
<P>
Anwar was later charged with five counts of corrupt practices
and five counts of unnatural sex acts, but he denied all the
charges. His trial on four corruption charges out of the 10
charges began on November 2 in the High Court here and is still
continuing.
</P>
<P>
The dramatic events related to Anwar put at stake the political
tranquillity, which Malaysia, a multi-racial society, enjoyed for
a long time.
</P>
<P>
Demonstrations and even riots which followed shook the normally
tranquil capital city and dismayed many Malaysians as street
politics carried out by Anwar's supporters threatened public peace
and security.
</P>
<P>
Almost at every weekend in October and November, organized
illegal assemblies were held in several places in the federal
capital, which sometimes led to rioting. On a number of occasions,
police had to resort to stern actions to restore order by using
tear gas and water cannons to disperse the demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
Facing the disturbing situation, Mahathir stressed the
importance of maintaining stability in the country and urged the
people to uphold the country's democratic system to ensure
continued peace and prosperity, saying "riots, demonstrations and
other unbecoming behaviors are not the ways Malaysians do things."
</P>
<P>
As the year of 1998 is drawing to a close, the fanaticism of
Anwar's supporters died out as no more demonstrations were seen in
the past three weeks at weekends.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Malaysia's Political Stability Tested in 1998 (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Following the expulsion of Anwar from UMNO, keeping the party
united was a challenge facing Mahathir. To consolidate the party,
the party's Supreme Council purged the party by expelling 10 party
members and issuing notices to 18 others asking them to explain
why they should not be expelled. Most of them were known as
Anwar's strong supporters.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, a strong supporter of Anwar, was forced to
resign as UMNO Youth Chief on October 2.
</P>
<P>
On December 13, UMNO amended its constitution at a special
general assembly in an effort to check money politics and tighten
discipline.
</P>
<P>
The amendments abolished the awarding of bonus votes for
candidates for the posts of party president and deputy president
introduced in the 1993 party election and replaced it with a
provision for eligibility based on a percentage system, under
which a candidate vying for the president's post must receive at
least 30 percent nomination from the 165 divisions, for deputy
presidency 20 percent, vice-presidency 10 percent and supreme
council membership five percent.
</P>
<P>
The amendments were observed to have been made to consolidate
the party's structure in the run-up to the party's election
scheduled for June next year.
</P>
<P>
Though many suggest that Mahathir appoint a deputy prime
minister at an early date to fill up the vacancy left behind by
Anwar, Mahathir, afraid of causing disunity among the seniors
within the party, is still unable to make decision on who could be
the next deputy prime minister before the party election as the
post is related to the UMNO deputy president's post.
</P>
<P>
Despite the political crisis in UMNO, the backbone of the
ruling Barisan Nasional (BN) (National Front) coalition
government, all BN component parties repeatedly expressed their
strong support for Mahathir's leadership as BN chairman.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, by taking advantage of Anwar's event,
opposition parties including Democratic Action Party (DAP), the
largest opposition party in the country, and the Islam Party of
Malaysia came into coalition along with some non-governmental
groups to form two organizations -- the People's Democracy Front
and the People's Justice Movement, but both were declared by the
authorities as illegal.
</P>
<P>
The move was, however, observed to indicate the opposition's
challenge to the ruling BN coalition in the coming general
election. The opposition publicly stated its objective of eroding
away the BN's two-thirds majority in the next general election
which is due to be held in April 2000.
</P>
<P>
An early general election was much talked about in the year.
All BN component parties have been directed by BN
Secretary-General Mohamed Rahmat to activate their respective
election machinery to guarantee no erosion to the coalition's
massive majority in the next general election. Speculation is rife
about the snap polls to be held by May next year.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, Mahathir once said "Anyway, holding a general
election is a very big job. You need full attention and managing
the economy also need full attention. It is not necessary to
stretch our limited energy between managing the economy and the
elections."
</P>
<P>
It would be difficult to handle both the election and the
economy at the same time, he said, adding the BN government has to
focus on reviving the economy.
</P>
<P>
Observers said what is challenging Mahathir most is the
economic recovery his government needs to strive for. If the
government can manage an early recovery, it will surely win the
mandate of the people in the next general election, they said.
</P>
<P>
They also pointed out that developments on vacant UMNO deputy
president's post should be keenly observed as the developments may
affect the UMNO unity and stability, which are a prerequisite for
the political stability in the country.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Sees Soaring Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Convictions for violent
crimes in New Zealand have increased by 65 percent in the past
decade, including shocking increases in the number of rapists,
kidnappers and robbers.
</P>
<P>
An NZ justice ministry report "Conviction and Sentencing of
Offenders in New Zealand: 1988 to 1997" shows:
</P>
<P>
-- Last year, 230 people were convicted of rape, an increase of
180 percent since 1988, though 1997's figure was the lowest in
the past five years;
</P>
<P>
-- Convictions for robberies jumped by 60 percent during the
past 10 years, and aggravated robbery convictions more than
doubled;
</P>
<P>
-- Last year, 1,113 people were found guilty of kidnappings or
abductions, up 113 percent from 1988;
</P>
<P>
-- Convictions for dealing in hard drugs have doubled since
1988; and
crimes against the justice system, including breaching bail and
obstructing or perverting the course of justice, have nearly
doubled in the decade.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, which was made public here Wednesday,
male offenders accounted for 84 percent of non-traffic offenses.
</P>
<P>
Offenders in their 20s were responsible for 45 percent of
crimes, of which 23 percent was committed by those in their 30s.
Teenagers accounted for 21 percent and those aged over 40
accounted for 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
A latest prison census showed that the number of people in
prison in the country has jumped by more than 70 percent and they
are serving longer sentences for more violent crimes than they
did a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
According to the census, which was taken on November 20, 1997,
there were 4,935 sentenced prisoners in New Zealand, a country
with a population of less than 3.8 million.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Out of Economic Recession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand economy has
 shrugged off the recessionary blues with higher-than-expected
growth in the third quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics New Zealand said Wednesday that the country's
economic activity in the third quarter rose by 0.7 percent after
one percent and 0.8 percent shrinks for the first and second
quarters respectively.
</P>
<P>
Local economists had expected a flat result for the quarter
before the official figure came out.
</P>
<P>
But Wednesday's result completed the worst year for the New
Zealand economy since 1992. The economy grew only 0.4 percent in
the year to September, the lowest result since September 1992.
</P>
<P>
Anyhow, the news about the positive growth in the third quarter
means "New Zealand is officially out of recession," the Evening
Post said.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand Deputy Government Statistician Ian Ewing said in a
media release that the boost from growth was export-led with
industries such as forestry and manufacturing recovering after
falls in production earlier in the year. Exports were up 3.6
percent in the third quarter, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the Wellington-based newspaper, the news gave a
boost to the New Zealand dollar, which has somewhat risen in its
valuation against the U.S. dollar. Short-term interest rates have
also risen with 90-day bank bills up from 4.5 percent to 4.7
percent.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports showed business confidence in New Zealand has
been increasing in recent months and some sectors have shown
signs of growth. The forestry sector, which suffered at the peak
of the Asian economic crisis, has seen demand returning, with log
shipments to Japan and the Republic of Korea increasing. The
agricultural sector has also been boosted by a mild winter and
favorable growing conditions in spring.

<HEADLINE> Australia Announces "World's First" Oceans Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Australia Wednesday launched
a comprehensive, national plan to ensure the conservation of its
rich marine biodiversity and security for marine-based industries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference in Canberra, Australian Federal
Environment Minister Robert Hill claimed Australia is the first
country in the world to develop such a plan, entitled Australia's
Oceans Policy.
</P>
<P>
Nan Bray, chief of the Marine Research Center under the
Commonwealth of Scientific, Industrial Research Organization, said
Australia's marine and coastal resources currently contribute more
than 42 billion U.S. dollars a year to the national economy.
</P>
<P>
The minister added the plan will be "the guiding force in the
future use and care of Australia's marine and coastal resources,"
saying the federal government would allocate 30 million U.S.
dollars over three years for a range of actions associated with
its implementation.
</P>
<P>
"At the core of the policy is a commitment to ecosystem-based
management of our marine jurisdiction which will be implemented
through a new regional marine planning process."
</P>
<P>
Based on large marine ecosystems, regional marine plans would
integrate sectoral commercial interests and conservation
requirements, he said.
</P>
<P>
"To drive the implementation of the policy and the regional
planning process, the (federal) government will establish a
National Oceans Ministerial Board which will include all relevant
Commonwealth ministers."
</P>
<P>
The policy also sets out a range of initial actions to be
undertaken by the government, including additional funding to
improve understanding of the marine environment, increased support
for the declaration and management of new marine reserves in
Australian waters, measures to increase the effectiveness of
surveillance and enforcement of illegal fishing in Australia's
marine jurisdiction.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Announces First National Water Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
announced the country's first national water policy which was
designed to ensure proper management and best utilization of water
resources, press reports here said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The objectives of the policy include comprehensive development
of main rivers, management of water resources in an efficient
manner, decentralization of management of water resources, and
ensuring availability of water to all elements of society.
</P>
<P>
The policy, which was approved by the cabinet on Monday after
comprehensive discussions by the National Water Council, was
announced by Water Resources Minister Abdur Razzak on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The policy set the guidelines for future water management in
both the public and the private sectors, Razzak said.
</P>
<P>
The framing of the policy was possible because of the signing
of the Ganges Water Sharing Treaty with India in 1996, he said.
The minister hoped that talks on sharing the waters of 53 other
rivers with neighboring countries would resume soon.
</P>
<P>
Under the policy, which would be reviewed periodically and
revised if necessary, the government through its agencies would
undertake comprehensive development and management of the main
rivers through a system of barrages and other structural and
non-structural measures, develop water resources of the major
rivers for multipurpose use, such irrigation, fisheries,
navigation and forestry.
</P>
<P>
The government would de-silt water courses to maintain
navigation channels and proper drainage, delineate water-stress
areas based on land characteristics and water availability for
managing dry season demand, and take steps to protect water
quality and ensure efficiency of its use.
</P>
<P>
The government would develop early-warning and flood-proofing
systems to manage flood, drought, and other natural disasters,
designate flood risk zones and take appropriate measures to
provide desired levels of protection for life, property, vital
infrastructure, agriculture and wetlands.
</P>
<P>
Regions of economic importance such as metropolitan areas,
airports and export processing zones would be fully protected
against floods as a matter of first priority, according to the
policy.
</P>
<P>
About the rural areas, the policy pointed out that the people
would be motivated to develop different flood proofing measures
such as rising of platform for homesteads, market places and
educational institutions, and adjusting the cropping pattern to
suite the flood regime.

<HEADLINE> Mutant Gene For Heart-Rhythm Abnormality Identified </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Researchers from Baylor
College of Medicine in Houston have located a gene responsible for
a heart-rhythm abnormality that can cause sudden death for
people under 35, the Circulation reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Dr Robert Roberts and his colleagues found the gene's
approximate location by studying seven generations of a large
Canadian family with 10 people having this disorder. They studied
DNA from 149 members of the family and narrowed down the location
of the bad gene to an area of chromosome 3.
</P>
<P>
The disorder kills the muscle cells of the right ventricle of
the heart, which are replaced with fatty, fibrous tissue.
</P>
<P>
People with the disorder can be treated with implanted
defibrillators, drugs and surgery. A defibrillator shocks the
heart to restore a normal rhythm.
</P>
<P>
Dr Roberts said the immediate benefit of the discovery was the
ability to screen people who had the bad gene, and then implant a
defibrillator.
</P>
<P>
Dr Hugh Calkins, director of electrophysiology at Johns Hopkins
University, called the findings "a very significant
breakthrough".

<HEADLINE> Soeharto's Son-in-Law Says He Will Not Relinquish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Prabowo Subianto, a son-in-law
of former president Soeharto, has said that he would not
relinquish his Indonesian citizenship, according to national
newspapers on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the newspapers on Tuesday, Prabowo, former chief
of the Army's Special Force (Kopassus), acknowledged that he had
been granted Jordanian citizenship by a Royal Decree.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from Amman, the capital of Jordan, the
office of Prime Minister Fayez Tarawneh has confirmed that
Prabowo's bid for citizenship had been endorsed by a royal decree
on December 10.
</P>
<P>
Prabowo said in his letter that he has rejected the granting of

honorary Jordanian citizenship because Indonesia does not
recognize dual
citizenship.
</P>
<P>
Prabowo and two other Kopassus senior officers were sanctioned
in August after a military council found they were involved in the
abduction and torture of political activists earlier in the year.
</P>
<P>
Prabowo was given an early retirement, while the two others
were barred from holding operational positions within the Armed
Forces (ABRI).

three Kopassus officers in August, did not rule out the
possibility of the three being brought before a military court
should more evidence surface during the trial of 11 Kopassus
members.

<P>
The military trial of the 11 soldiers, including seven
noncommissioned officers, on charges of kidnapping and torture is

<P>
Earlier on Tuesday, Justice Minister Muladi warned Prabowo
against accepting Jordanian citizenship.
</P>
<P>
"We do not recognize dual citizenship... Once someone accepts
another citizenship, he loses his Indonesian citizenship," Muladi
said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that change in the nationality of Prabowo will not
affect the legal prosecution against him for alleged kidnapping of
pro-democracy activists.
</P>
<P>
However, it would be difficult to try Prabowo at the military
tribunal if he is in Jordan because Indonesia has no extradition
agreement with the Middle Eastern country.

PANAMA CITY, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Panamanian Justice
Minister Mariela Sagel on Tuesday rejected a request that taxi and
bus drivers be allowed to carry guns amid soaring crime rates.
</P>
<P>
In a radio interview, Sagel said she would meet with
representatives of taxi drivers unions to analyze insecurity in
Panama City.
</P>
<P>
Taxi and bus drivers, who have been targeted by robbers, have
armed themselves after the murders of over 100 of their colleagues
in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
But commuters said the gun-toting drivers were dangerous since
they lacked training to use arms.
</P>
<P>
Union leader Jorge Shailer said Panamanian taxi drivers were
forced to carry guns to defend themselves since police had failed
to curb the crime wave.

BELGRADE, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Both Srdan Ivanisevic, the
father of Croatian top tennis player Goran Ivanisevic, and
Croatia Tennis Federation president Suad Rizvanbegovic received a
one-month suspended jail sentence, according to reports from
Zagreb, Croatia on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Srdan Ivanisevic introduced legal proceedings against
Rizvanbegovic, who accused him last April in the government press
of having founded a political party.
</P>
<P>
The accusation angered Srdan Ivanisevic.
</P>
<P>
However, he was handed the same punishment for publicly
accusing Rizvanbegovic of having only sponsoring certain tennis
clubs.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the men were strained after Goran Ivanisevic
refused to play Davis Cup tennis for Croatia.
</P>
<P>
The top player asserted that he could served the country as

<HEADLINE> Kyrgyz Probe Continues on Corruption in Finance Ministry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Kyrgyz Interior Minister
Omurbek Kutuyev said Tuesday that the probe into alleged
corruption and embezzlement in the Finance Ministry is continuing.
</P>
<P>
Kutuyev told lawmakers that charges of embezzlement, fraud and
corruption had been brought against detained ministry officials.
About 35 such facts have been checked, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kyrgyz Prosecutor-General Asanbek Sharshenaliyev said that if
the corruption charges are not confirmed, the cases will be
closed.
</P>
<P>
He said a task force combating corruption plans to detain and
bring charges against several more state officials. He did not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Talaibek Koichumanov has sharply condemned
the arrest of Finance Ministry officials, saying the announcement
of an indictment prior to a court decision is a gross violation
of human rights.
</P>
<P>
He also accused law-enforcement officers of blackmailing and
slandering the defendants.
</P>
<P>
"A good initiative to combat corruption, advanced by the
president, has been discredited," Koichumanov said.
</P>
<P>
"The Finance Ministry is not guilty of anything," the minister
claimed.
</P>
<P>
The former Soviet republic has stepped up its fight against
corruption in recent months.
</P>
<P>
Hot lines are being installed in the country to handle complai
nts about corrupt officials, Shirshenaliyev, the
prosecutor-general said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Shirshenaliyev heads the Coordinating Council Against
Corruption and Economic Crime, a task force created by President
Askar Akayev on December 19.
</P>
<P>
The council, which includes representatives of security and
law enforcement structures, tax agencies, customs structures and
the prosecutor's office, will take steps to tighten the struggle
against corruption, Shirshenaliyev said.
</P>
<P>
Government comptrollers and the Presidential Administration
will be assisting the council, he said.
</P>
<P>
The new structure will control the investigation of all
corruption charges in the country, the prosecutor said.
</P>
<P>
He said 383 officials had been dismissed over the past five
years on charges of corruption. The majority of crimes involving
abuse of office were committed by low-level rather than by senior
officials, Shirshenaliyev said.

<HEADLINE> Australia Announces "World's First" Oceans Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Australia Wednesday launched
a comprehensive, national plan to ensure the conservation of its
rich marine biodiversity and security for marine-based industries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference in Canberra, Australian Federal
Environment Minister Robert Hill claimed Australia is the first
country in the world to develop such a plan, entitled Australia's
Oceans Policy.
</P>
<P>
Nan Bray, chief of the Marine Research Center under the
Commonwealth of Scientific, Industrial Research Organization, said
Australia's marine and coastal resources currently contribute more
than 42 billion U.S. dollars a year to the national economy.
</P>
<P>
The minister added the plan will be "the guiding force in the
future use and care of Australia's marine and coastal resources,"
saying the federal government would allocate 300 million U.S.
dollars over three years for a range of actions associated with
its implementation.
</P>
<P>
"At the core of the policy is a commitment to ecosystem-based
management of our marine jurisdiction which will be implemented
through a new regional marine planning process."
</P>
<P>
Based on large marine ecosystems, regional marine plans would
integrate sectoral commercial interests and conservation
requirements, he said.
</P>
<P>
"To drive the implementation of the policy and the regional
planning process, the (federal) government will establish a
National Oceans Ministerial Board which will include all relevant
Commonwealth ministers."
</P>
<P>
The policy also sets out a range of initial actions to be
undertaken by the government, including additional funding to
improve understanding of the marine environment, increased support
for the declaration and management of new marine reserves in
Australian waters, measures to increase the effectiveness of
surveillance and enforcement of illegal fishing in Australia's
marine jurisdiction.

<HEADLINE> Poland's Trade Deficit Goes Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Poland registered a trade
deficit of 16.3 billion U.S. dollars in the first 10 months this
year, up 3.2 billion dollars from the same period last year, the
Central Statistics Bureau said.
</P>
<P>
During the period, imports increased 11.5 percent while exports
rose 3.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Central Statistics Bureau attributed the widened trade
deficit to the slump of Poland's exports to the European Union
(EU).
</P>
<P>
The country's trade deficit with the EU amounted to 12.4
billion dollars from January to October.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Transportation departments
in China's Guangdong Province have drawn up plans for the spring
period, the annual peak season, during the Spring Festival.
</P>
<P>
Departments will take steps to ensure the smooth movement of
transport by putting more buses and passengers trains and planes
into operation.
</P>
<P>
The number of passengers is expected to rise dramatically early
next year as more farmers, especially in the flood-hit areas come
to Guangdong looking for jobs.
</P>
<P>
It is predicted that 21 million people may be on the move
before Spring Festival, a rise of 4 percent over last Spring
Festival, and there may be more passengers after the festival.
</P>
<P>
The railway department expects some 2.63 million people to
travel by train before the festival and the figure may rise to 4.6
million after the festival.
</P>
<P>
The number of passengers traveling by air may also increase
considerably as more people go sightseeing in southern China
during the season.

BUCHAREST, December 22 (Xinhua) -- "The results in sports were
as outstanding as ever though 1998 wasn't too rich in
competitions abroad," the national Rompres news agency Tuesday
quoted Nicolae Vieru, the president of Romania's Gymnastics
Federation as saying.
</P>
<P>
He mentioned that the women senior team got the "gold" at the

Corina Ungureanu also won the floor event while Simona Amanar

two gold medals, a silver one and a bronze one, Nicolae Vieru

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Imports Soar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan imports will reach
over 16.1 billion dollars this year, 26 percent increase over
last year, the statistics and computer central office said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In the January-October period, imports reached 13.1 billion
dollars, rising by nearly 26 percent over the 10.4 billion dollars
registered in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The increase was due to uncertainty preceding the recent
presidential elections, prompting store-owners to hoard supplies
they believed could be sold at a higher price in case of a crisis
after the voting.
</P>
<P>
The office said that exports would total 1.5 billion dollars in
November and 1.3 billions in December.
</P>
<P>
The United States is Venezuela's largest supplier, with 7.1
billion dollars worth of sales, or 44 percent of the total,
followed by Colombia with 915 million dollars, Japan with 858
million dollars and Mexico with 732 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Electrical supplies dominated the imports with a 30.3 share
of the market.
</P>
<P>
They are followed by transportation materials with 18.6
percent, and chemicals with 10.2 percent.

<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Former Brazil coach
Mario Zagallo signed a six-month contract with Sao Paolo's
Portuguesa, according to club officials on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ilidio Lico, Portuguesa vice-president, said Zagallo's
contract could be extended for the whole of next year depending
on results.
</P>
<P>
Zagallo won the World Cup as a player in 1958 and 1962, then
as a coach in 1970. He served as an assistant coach to Carlos
Alberto Perreira when Brazil earned a fourth crown in the United
States in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, Brazil coached by Zagallo lost to France at the
1998 World Cup final.
</P>
<P>
The 67-year-old would join his team which reached the
Brazilian championship final in 1996 and the semi-final in the
last two years.

ROME, December 22 (Xinhua) -- A new social pact designated to
create jobs and boost economic growth was signed here Tuesday by
Italian central government, industrial associations, labor unions
and local governments.
</P>
<P>
Under the pact, companies will reduce their welfare
contributions to employees by 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
This would lead to a 1.2 percent drop in labor costs by 2003.
</P>
<P>
The pact also rules that the government will allocate 1.6
trillion lire (about 1 billion U.S. dollars) in 3 years for the
job-training program for young people.
</P>
<P>
A permanent body will be set up inside the prime minister's
office to monitor the implementation of the pact.
</P>
<P>
After the signing ceremony, Italian Prime Minister Massimo
D'Alema described the pact as "dynamic", and called on the whole
society, not only the government, to take its own responsibility.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The prospect of oil prices
staying low are crushing Venezuela's hopes of an increase in crude
revenues for the next three years, Deputy Energy and Mines
Minister Dolores Dobarro said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Dobarro said that world oil inventories were still large and
Iraq was selling more crude at lower prices.
</P>
<P>
She said that prices would recover only if other producers
committed themselves to cut output.
</P>
<P>
Dobarro said Venezuela would completely comply with its
commitment to reduce output by 525,000 barrels a day by January 1,
when production would go down by 80,000 to 100,000 barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
She said the latest pledge by Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and
Mexico to postpone further cuts until December 1999 could be
shared by other countries in an extraordinary meeting of the
Organization of Petroleum Producing Countries (OPEC) and by

<HEADLINE> China's Lawn Business Now Offering Great Potential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, December 23 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese lawn specialist
says that the lawn business is expected to grow 40 percentage
points annually over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
Han Liebao, the head of the lawn research center of the
Botanical College at China Agriculture University says he believes
there is great potential in China's lawn business with the growing
number of golf courses, airports, highways, and squares.
</P>
<P>
Han says that the boom in roof gardens in cities like Beijing,
Shanghai, and Shenzhen means another opportunity for the lawn
business and that all aspects of the business from planting to
machinery are profitable now.
</P>
<P>
He estimates that China needs around 300,000 tons of grass seed
annually. Its annual grass seeds consumption now is only one
percent of the U.S.'s and that imports of good grass seed have
increased 80 percentage points annually.
</P>
<P>
Wen Sanyuan, a planter in Guangdong Province, says he's happy
with his annual income from the lawn business and that he can
produce sod five times a year. A square meter of sod can generate
5,000 yuan (600 U.S. dollars) in the summer and profits from lawns
can be two or three times those from rice.
</P>
<P>
Wen sells his sod in the city of Guangzhou, the provincial
capital, 60 kilometers from his home town.

<HEADLINE> FIFA Plays Down Threat to UK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 22 (Xinhua) -- World football governing body
FIFA has played down fears that the four UK football associations
are facing a renewed threat to their privileged position in world
football following the FA cash-for-votes scandal.
</P>
<P>
The move follows reports that the associations faced a renewed
threat to their automatic right to the vice-president's position
on the executive committee of world soccer's governing body,
according to the BBC on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Since the end of World War II, England, Wales, Scotland and
Northern Ireland have shared the privilege of nominating the
vice-president - who is one of the 24 members of the game's most
senior decision-making board.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland FA president Jim Boyce has said that three
members of the executive committee had told him that a motion
proposing an end to this right would be put before the next FIFA
Congress, in Los Angeles next July.
</P>
<P>
In the past, similar moves proposed largely by central or
south American countries have been overwhelmingly defeated.
However, the UK has recently clashed with other member states
over a series of issues.
</P>
<P>
But on Tuesday a FIFA spokesman said: "Experience shows that
it's not that easy to change the statutes.
</P>
<P>
"You have to come up with a motion which one affiliated
country has to submit and then has to be supported by two other
countries." But the agenda at the FIFA Congress is always fairly
limited, there aren't hundreds of motions on the agenda which the
Congress has to deal with.
</P>
<P>
He added: "We've had this feeling of uneasiness towards the
British situation for years but no-one has wanted to change it.
</P>
<P>
"Even the fact that Britain has four national associations has
been discussed and debated for years and nothing has happened on
that."
</P>
<P>
The home countries have fallen out with other FIFA members on
several issues:
</P>
<P>
The English FA courted opposition by apparently ignoring the
gentleman's agreement which former chairman Sir Bert Millichip
had made with Germany to support their 2006 World Cup campaign in
exchange for backing to host Euro 96.
</P>
<P>
Then, they went against the rest of Europe and switched their
allegiance from UEFA president Lennart Johansson to Sepp Blatter
for the race to become head of FIFA.
</P>
<P>
The recent controversy over the 3.2 million pounds loan or
grant which the FA Chairman Keith Wiseman and former the FA Chief
Executive Graham Kelly agreed to give the Welsh FA has also
damaged the UK's reputation. The loan, which led to Mr Kelly's
resignation, was alleged to have been in return for the Welsh
supporting the FA chairman's bid to replace Scotland's David Will
as the Home Nations'vice-president at Fifa.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Tommy Brooks is hoping to
be Mike Tyson's trainer when the former heavyweight champion
prepares his comeback fight next month.
</P>
<P>
"In order for him to be successful again, to regain the title,
we have to go back to the old style," Brooks said of Tyson, who
will fight South Africa's Francois Botha on January 16 in Las
Vegas.
</P>
<P>
"We are looking to get that head movement, nonstop punching
and stepping aside and around his opponent back," Brooks said.
</P>
<P>
Brooks joined Tyson's camp as head trainer seven weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
"When you are a new trainer, what I've been concentrating on
is not trying to change his style but working to get back to the
Mike Tyson of old," Brooks said. "I was worried that I might not
have enough time, but he showed me he was taking everything in
that we were working on. He was putting his punches together in
bunches and not trying to take him out in one punch. He was not
squaring up."
</P>
<P>
Brooks has helped Holyfield to beat Tyson twice. "The thing
that happened to Mike was he wasn't in shape and he was getting
hit by punches that he didn't think he could get hit by and he
just lost it," Brooks said.

<HEADLINE> Referee Could Sue Di Canio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Referee Paul Alcock is
considering possible legal action against Sheffield Wednesday
forward Paolo Di Canio for pushing him over during the game with
Arsenal three months ago.
</P>
<P>
The 44-year-old official claims he is still suffering physical
problems as a result of the incident and has not refereed a
Premiership match since November 7.
</P>
<P>
"I have been having physiotherapy since the incident but it
has gone much deeper than that," he told the Daily Mail newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"Last Tuesday, I was in a London hospital under general
anaesthetic, having treatment on my back, to put a disc back in
place.
</P>
<P>
"Since the incident I have had continuous pins and needles
down my left leg. I was unable to sleep without painkillers and
it has been hard for me and my family," he said.
</P>
<P>
Di Canio was suspended for 11 matches following the incident
and is currently in dispute with Wednesday for failing to return
to the club following compassionate leave.
</P>
<P>
He is still in Italy and says he is suffering from stress and
depression but the club has now imposed a third fine on him,
taking his total bill, including legal costs, to around 125,000
pounds.
</P>
<P>
"If he does require medical attention, then he should be seen
by our own medical advisors. We have not been able to get that
message across to his lawyers. But it's very difficult to
communicate when it's on a one-way basis," said Wednesday
secretary Graham Mackrell.
</P>
<P>
Referee Alcock insists he has no personal grudge against Di
Canio but is concerned about his loss of earnings.
</P>
<P>
"If I refereed him in a match tomorrow, it would be fine for
me as long as he kept within the rules. But I can't make any
further comment on the specific incident because it could
seriously jeopardise the course of action I wish to take," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"It would be dangerous for me to say any more. All I will say
is that I am determined to get fit and get back to refereeing. It
has been so frustrating sitting on the sidelines," he added.

<P>
WASHINGTON, December 22 (Xinhua) -- US West, a major sponsor
of Salt Lake's 2002 Winter Olympics, has written a letter to the
organizing committee to protest the "unsavory allegations" during
the games bidding.
</P>
<P>
According to a local press report, US West has asked Salt Lake
Organizing Committee President Frank Joklik to "clarify what has
transpired and what actions the Olympic movement taking to
address these issues."
</P>
<P>
"The ideals and spirit of the Olympic Games and the values and
high standards of the athletes draw companies like ours to
sponsor the process and to use these powerful symbols of
commitment, determination and fair play in our marketing,
management and community affairs efforts," Mark Roellig, US
West's general counsel, said in a December 18 letter.
</P>
<P>
"The very core of these ideals and the spirit of the games are
now under scrutiny and perhaps tainted. This is an extremely
serious issue for all of us," Roellig wrote.
</P>
<P>
Other sponsors also showed their concern to this scandal.
</P>
<P>
"We've expressed our concerns to the International Olympic
Committee and they assured us they will take swift and decisive
action, and we will monitor them to ensure that," said Ben
Deutch, spokeman for Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
"As an Olympic sponsor, we are very concerned that the
Olympics keep the proper perspective and any allegation raises a
concern," said Bill Berry, spokeman for Delta Air Lines, another
sponsor.
</P>
<P>
SLOC is worrying that sponors will not offer their aid for the
Games, which still need more than $600 million of the estimated
$1.4 billion budget.

<HEADLINE> McManaman Eyes Boxing Day Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Steve McManaman looks set to
return to Liverpool's first team on Boxing Day after playing and
scoring in a specially arranged reserve friendly fixture.
</P>
<P>
McManaman and fellow midfielder David Thompson grabbed the
goals as Liverpool beat Bradford City 2-0, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
But of more importance was that the winger emerged unscathed
from his first match for almost six weeks with no apparent
reaction to his Achilles tendon injury.
</P>
<P>
He now looks set to return to first team duties against
Middlesborough on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Recent long-term injury victims Rob Jones and Oyvind
Leonhardsen also had run-outs in the reserve match, but Frenchman
Jean-Michel Ferri had not recovered sufficiently from an ankle
injury.
</P>
<P>
Team mate Jamie Redknapp was delighted at the prospect of
McManaman's return.
</P>
<P>
"Macca will be a breath of fresh air to us when he comes back
because he's such a lively player. He's one of the best I have
ever seen and of course you miss a player of that calibre," he
said.
</P>
<P>
McManaman's comeback could create a tactical problem for
Liverpool boss Gerard Houllier who will almost certainly have to
change the side's system to accommodate the 26-year-old.
</P>
<P>
Houllier has stuck with a 5-3-2 formation in McManaman's
absence from which midfield trio Paul Ince, Jamie Redknapp and
Patrik Berger are unlikely to be displaced.
</P>
<P>
That means Liverpool may have to revert to a 4-4-2 style, with
either Phil Babb or Stig Bjornebye stepping down.
</P>
<P>
McManaman's last match for the club was the home defeat
against Derby County at the beginning of November.
</P>
<P>
Within five days of that game, Roy Evans, the man credited
with nurturing the England international's talent, resigned as
co-manager.
</P>
<P>
McManaman's return to the team is also likely to renew
transfer speculation about the Liverpool-born player.
</P>
<P>
European and English clubs have expressed an interest in
McManaman, whose current contract expires at the end of the
season. However, the 26-year-old has said he wants to stay put.

<HEADLINE> Hospital Updates Conditions of Octuplets, Mother </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The mother of world's
first octuplets to be born alive is "alert, happy and excited"
following surgery early Monday morning to control bleeding,
according to the latest press briefing released by Texas
Children's Hospital Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The hospital, where the octuplets are under intensive care, has
so far put out six press briefings online on the conditions of the
babies and their mother.
</P>
<P>
"The babies had an uneventful night," Tuesday's briefing said.
"All eight infants remain critical, but stable."
</P>
<P>
According to the hospital, Baby E (the fifth), the smallest of
the octuplets with the birthweight of 320 grams, measures
lengthwise at 25 centimeters. She is approximately the size of a
Beanie Baby toy and can fit in a woman's hand.
</P>
<P>
Baby A is now off the ventilator; babies B through H are all
breathing with the assistance of ventilators. Two of them are
receiving oxgen ranging from 35 percent to 100 percent. All are
being kept sleepy and quiet under a plastic blanket on a warming
bed and have been treated with surfactant replacement to help with
premature lung diseases. All eight infants are receiving
intravenous sugar and fluids, the hospital said.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's briefing identified the mother as Mrs. Chukwu.
"Companies, organizations and individuals have already begun
calling in donations for Mrs. Chukwu and the Chukwu octuplets,"
the hospital said.
</P>
<P>
A previous briefing quoted Dr. Leonard Weisman, chief of
neonatology service at the hospital, as saying that premature
babies such as the octuplets have an 85 percent chance of
surviving and leading productive lives. "They are all critically
ill, (but) several are showing improvements," the doctor said.
</P>
<P>
The first baby was born on December 8, and others on December
20. Their mother underwent surgery to control bleeding about 18
hours after delivering seven of the octuplets by Cesarean section.

BUCHAREST, December 22 (Xinhua) -- A contract was signed early
this week for oil extraction in the Black Sea continental shelf by
Romania's National Agency for Mineral Resources and National Oil
Petrom Company and ELF AQUITAINE of France.
</P>
<P>
Romania's National Agency for Mineral Resources and National
Oil Petrom struck a deal in April over the exploring of
approximately 10,000 square kilometers off-shore the Black Sea. In
sea water less deep than 100 meters, Petrom will process 70
percent of the allotted shelf, while ELF 30 percent. ELF will
process 70 percent and Petrom 30 percent in waters from 100 to
1,600 deep.
</P>
<P>
The total operation cost amounts to 1.5 billion U.S. dollars.
Under the contract, the two oil companies benefit from exclusivity
in this area for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
ELF AQUITAINE, a world leader in oil extraction operating in
deep water, will invest 10 million U.S. dollars in the first phase
and is expected to come up with 500 million dollars afterwards.

<HEADLINE> Germany Replaces France in Confederations Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 22 (Xinhua) -- European champion Germany
will replace World Cup winner France in next year's
Confederations' Cup in Mexico, FIFA, soccer's governing body,
said in Zurich, Switzerland, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The tournament will take place July 24 to August 4 _ four days
earlier than planned _ to accommodate the Germans, FIFA said.
</P>
<P>
After weeks of debate over the schedule and to the anger of
FIFA and local organizers, France withdrew because of clashes
with its domestic and European obligations, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The French move reflected a feeling by many European squads
that the Confederations Cup is an unnecessary feature on an
overcrowded soccer calendar.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the world champion and host nation, FIFA
invited continental champions Brazil, New Zealand, Egypt and
Saudi Arabia along with South American and CONCACAF runners-up
Bolivia and the United States to participate in the competition.
</P>
<P>
Germany will play in Group B in Guadalajara against Brazil,
the United States and New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
FIFA initially moved the eight-nation event from January 8-20
to July 28-August 8 to placate France. The French federation said
it accepted this, but then changed its mind because the French
national league begins its 1999-2000 championship on July 28.
</P>
<P>
France then asked for the competition to be moved to the start
of the summer.

LONDON, December 22 (Xinhua) -- European markets appeared lost
of energy Tuesday after the unexpectedly strong run Monday took
the wind from their sails.
</P>
<P>
London's blue chips suffered a modest downturn in a thin
uninspiring session, with little in the way of seasonal cheer for
any bulls still trading before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE 100 ended 33.2 lower at 5843.3 on volume of 620m
shares traded. The leading index had put together a slim advance
in early trade, in spite of a dismal session in Asia.
</P>
<P>
But sentiment was gradually eroded as players looked to
consolidate on Monday's impressive 2.3 percent surge. The
performance on Wall Street depressed sentiment further, as trading
there was flat to lower, with the technology sector under sharp
pressure.
</P>
<P>
German shares closed firmer as dollar strength was countered by
Wall Street's losses. The Dax index ended trading off intra-day
highs at 4825 - up 44 points.
</P>
<P>
French stocks were little changed in late deals, coming off
firmer levels in line with Wall Street's drift.
</P>
<P>
The Cac 40 gained 17 points to close at 3820. Overall market
sentiment remains bullish, although there is little fresh news
providing direction for investors, said a trader in Paris.

vocational education started, in cooperation with small and

school masters and of high sanitary schools. Programs were applied
for giving fresh impetus to the study of widely spoken languages,
classical languages, sport and arts in secondary and high schools.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) Tuesday announced the approval of the third annual loan
for Armenia under the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility
(ESAF), totaling about 59 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The loan, which has been increased by some 11 million dollars,
will be used to support the government's economic program for
1999. The loan is available in two equal semiannual installments
of about 29 million dollars, the first of which is made available
at the end of December, this year.
</P>
<P>
The major objectives of Armenia's development strategy are to
address the spillover effects of the Russian crisis while trying
to move forward in consolidating the gains achieved so far in
stabilization and deepening structural reform. The government
program is designed to achieve the real annual GDP growth of at
least 5.5 percent in 1998 and 4.0 percent in 1999. End-period
inflation is targeted at single-digits in both years.
</P>
<P>
The total commitment under the three-year loan is thus
increased to the equivalent of about 154 million dollars for the
country.

BUCHAREST, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The year 1998 is for the
Romanian Education Ministry a year when "comprehensive reform
measures were taken for all education levels in Romania," said a
Romanian Education Ministry official Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Director of Public Relations Directorate in the Education
Ministry Mircea Muresan made the statement in an interview with
the national Rompres news agency.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the landmarks of the Romanian education reform
that turned into reality in 1998, Muresan mentioned the curricula,
syllabuses and textbooks. He spoke about the relaunch of
scientific research in universities, the improvement of the
infrastructure, the reform of school and academic management
through decentralization and the institutional autonomy of the
education units, and advanced forms of international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Education Ministry was reorganized in 1998, he said, adding
that contests were held for more than 180 posts. The reform of
vocational education started, in cooperation with small and
medium-sized units, as well as the reform of colleges that train
school masters and of high sanitary schools. Programs were applied
for giving fresh impetus to the study of widely spoken languages,
classical languages, sport and arts in secondary and high schools.
</P>
<P>
The private school network extended considerably in 1998 and
the university management reform resulted in university autonomy,
he said.

<HEADLINE> IMF Okays Third Annual ESAF Loan for Armenia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) Tuesday announced the approval of the third annual loan
for Armenia under the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility
(ESAF), totaling about 59 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The loan, which has been increased by some 11 million dollars,
will be used to support the government's economic program for
1999. The loan is available in two equal semiannual installments
of about 29 million dollars, the first of which is made available
at the end of December, this year.
</P>
<P>
The major objectives of Armenia's development strategy are to
address the spillover effects of the Russian crisis while trying
to move forward in consolidating the gains achieved so far in
stabilization and deepening structural reform. The government
program is designed to achieve the real annual GDP growth of at
least 5.5 percent in 1998 and 4.0 percent in 1999. End-period
inflation is targeted at single-digits in both years.
</P>
<P>
The total commitment under the three-year loan is thus
increased to the equivalent of about 154 million dollars for the
country.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, December 22 (Xinhua) -- NATO would continue its
open-door policy as a priority even after the Washington Summit in
1999, and also its enlargement, Klaus Naumann, chairman of the
NATO Military Committee said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>

role played by Romania as NATO's partner that went beyond the
Partnership for Peace (PfP)and said interoperability between
Romanian Armed Forces and NATO forces was an essential criterion
in assessing Romania's admission request.
</P>
<P>
He said Romania, a candidate country having many assets and
having appreciatedly contributed to NATO operations in Bosnia,
still had to make efforts for a better state economy.
</P>
<P>
NATO would design a special program for the candidate countries
as part of the enlargement process, in order to bring them closer
to the Alliance, he added.
</P>
<P>
Romania's Prime Minister Radu Vasile said that Romania had been
undergoing a straight and painful process of economic and
institutional reforms, yet it had been paying special attention to
the restructuring and modernization of its armed forces as well to
better performances to attain interoperability with NATO forces.

<HEADLINE> European Central Bank Decides Interest Rate at 3 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The European Central Bank (ECB)
decided Tuesday to set the unitary key interest rate for the 11
nations joining monetary union next month at 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken at the European Central Bank's last
council meeting before the launch of the euro. ECB President Wim
Duisenberg announced it on the same day evening in Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
He said, interest rates in the euro zone were already "very low
by historical standards", and ruled out a possibility of swift
lowering of lending rate. The ECB wanted to maintain this rate for
the "foreseeable future," he added.
</P>
<P>
With starting of the Euro as of next January, the ECB will be
in charge of setting the interest rates for the whole euro zone.
</P>
<P>
The new rate will be applied as the "initial tender rate" at
which the ECB will lend money to commercial banks in the euro zone
and will determine overall lending rate levels in the 11 euro
countries.
</P>
<P>
As a transitory measure, the deposit rate will be initially set
at 2.75 percent and the marginal lending rate at 3.25 percent. As
of 21 January the rates for these lending facilities will be set
at 2 per cent and 4.5 per cent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The temporary narrowing of the corridor was aimed to ensure a
smooth launch of the new euro money market, the ECB said.
</P>
<P>
On New Year's Eve, the ECB will set the final conversion rates
of the euro with other currencies.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Public Don't Pay Close Attention to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Although Saturday's U.S
House of Representatives vote to impeach President Bill Clinton
was only the second time a president has ever been impeached, the
public didn't seem much interested.
</P>
<P>
Only about one-third of American adults said they paid very
close attention to the impeachment proceedings, according to
findings released on Tuesday by the Pew Research Center for the
People &AMP; the Press.
</P>
<P>
"There was no suspense involved" in the impeachment, said
Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center. "They
(Americans) don't like it. They see it as an exercise in
partisanship."
</P>
<P>
The poll was based on telephone interviews December 19-21 with
805 adults who participated in a similar poll December 9-13.
Clinton's job approval ratings jumped from 61 percent in the first
poll to 71 percent in the more recent one.
</P>
<P>
The poll also shows 67 percent said House members who voted for
impeachment did so for political reasons; 25 percent said
lawmakers voted for impeachment because they felt Clinton's
actions warranted removal from office.
</P>
<P>
The poll's margin of error was plus or minus 4 percentage
points.

<HEADLINE> UK's Prime Minister Backs Minister on House Loan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 22 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair on Tuesday defended Trade Secretary Peter Mandelson after
the minister admitted receiving a 373,000 pound (620,000 U.S.
dollars) secret loan from Paymaster General Geoffrey Robinson.
</P>
<P>
Blair's official spokesman said the matter was considered
closed after it had been looked into by the Cabinet Secretary Sir
Richard Wilson.
</P>
<P>
He said he was satisfied Mandelson had properly "insulated
himself" from an investigation into Robinson's business affairs.
</P>
<P>
Mandelson said earlier that he had been given a "stiff kicking"
by "mischievous" newspapers -- but had not needed to declare the
loan, which he put towards buying a home, as it was "a personal
arrangement".
</P>
<P>
Mandelson paid 475,000 pounds (780,000 U.S. dollars) for the
house in west London's fashionable Notting Hill district more than
two years ago while in opposition.
</P>
<P>
After the trade secretary was appointed to his current post in
Summer, he was informed the Department of Trade and Industry would
be investigating Robinson's financial dealings.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Mandelson would now be writing to the new
Registrar for Members Interests inviting her to rule on whether he
had breached Commons rules by not declaring the loan.
</P>
<P>
Mandelson said the outstanding amount was 332,000 pounds
(548,000 U.S. dollars). He paid interest at a base rate and hoped
to finish paying it all off soon.
</P>
<P>
Downing Street said ministerial code only required ministers to
ensure they were not placed in a situation where they might be
facing a conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
Opposition Conservative MPs have criticized the loan and
demanded more details and a full inquiry.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Federal Reserve Leaves Interest Rates Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Reserve
policy-makers decided to keep short-term interest rates unchanged
at this year's final meeting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Open Market Committee's decision, announced by Fed
spokeswoman Lynn Fox after the meeting ended at 12:55 p.m., was in
line with most economists forecasts. It leaves the federal funds
overnight bank lending rate at 4.75 percent, the level it has been
at since it was last cut by a quarter percentage point on Nov. 17.
The discount rate on emergency loans from the central bank remains
steady at 4.50 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Fed has cut official interest rates three times over the
past three months in a move to shield the U.S. economy and nervous
financial markets from the fallout of the world economic slump
that began in Asia last year.
</P>
<P>
With the U.S. economy demonstrating continued growth which
began in March 1991, many economists said the Federal Reserve is
likely to wait for fresh evidence of a slowdown in this country
before cutting rates again. It will probably get the evidence, but
not before its next meeting scheduled for Feb. 2-3, 1999. The next
year's second meeting has been set for March 30.
