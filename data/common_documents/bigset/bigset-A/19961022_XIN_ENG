<HEADLINE> Russian Premier Reaffirms Chechen Settlement Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin said Monday the Kremlin still wanted a peaceful
solution to the Chechen crisis but ruled out the possibility of
Chechnya's secession from Russia.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin told the first meeting of the Russian Security
Council since its chief Alexander Lebed was sacked by President
Boris Yeltsin last week, "We do not need a war, we will hold talks
and go further in this direction."
</P>
<P>
But he said, "The firmness of the territorial integrity of
Russia can not be subject of discussion."
</P>
<P>
Alexander Lebed was Yeltsin's personal envoy to Chechnya and
succeeded in negotiating a ceasefire and peace agreement with
rebels in the breakaway republic in August. Many observers fear
his dismissal will threaten the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Lebed's replacement on the Security Council, Ivan Rybkin, a
former speaker of the State Duma (lower house of parliament), was
appointed by Yeltsin on Saturday and was at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin said the Chechen settlement would remain the main
task of the Security Council and it was important to ensure "the
understanding of all parties, including the Chechnya sides."
</P>
<P>
Rybkin said that many things had been done "clumsily" in
Chechnya by the Security Council over the past few months,
referring to a number of agreements signed by Lebed with the
Chechen separatist leadership on a peaceful settlement to the
20-month conflict between the rebels and government troops.
</P>
<P>
He called for the immediate cooperation of all Security Council
members in finding a solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Rybkin said the Security Council is an instrument of the
Russian state and a body subordinate to the president.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped that council regulations and future legislation
would clearly define the range of the duties of the secretary and
the council's divisions.

BEIJING, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Colombian President Ernesto
Samper Pizano said today in Beijing that his current China tour is

noted, his visit will further consolidate friendly ties between
the two states.
</P>

Colombia and China will continue their dialogue on
multi-lateral matters, as well as bilateral issues, the President
said.
</P>
<P>
With regard to trade ties, Samper, who earlier today met
enterpreneurs from both countries, said that Colombia is willing
to increase banana and coffee exports to China, and at the same
time import more from China.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that China is certain to become one of
Colombia's important co-operative partners in Asia.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Nurses, Junior Drs Go on Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's nurses and junior
doctors today have gone on a countrywide strike for the second
time in two months, accusing the government of failing to respond
to their salary related demands.
</P>
<P>
The nurses went on a two-week strike together with other civil
servants in August demanding a 20 percent salary adjustment as
well as increases in various allowances, a 40-hour working week
with anything beyond that being treated as overtime.
</P>
<P>
They then went back to work after the government promised to
look into their demands.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman for the strikers Farai Jiah said today that apart
from the failure by the government to meet their demands, there
were discrepancies in the payment of their October salaries which
were back-dated to July.
</P>
<P>
He said the rest of the civil service was also ''keen'' to
join the strike.
</P>
<P>
Jiah added general workers and nurse aides had been asked to
remain at work on a go-slow.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot Businessmen Urged to Meet International </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot businessmen are urged
today to adjust their mentality to meet increasing international
competition.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an international conference on bankers on the
Cypriot economy and future prospects, Cyprus' Finance Minister
Christodoulos Christodoulou said "if Cyprus is to maintain a
healthy rate of economic growth, local businesses have to meet
the new international realities which affect the local economic
and monetary system."
</P>
<P>
He said the implementation of the GATT (General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade) and the reduction of import duties on the
European Union (EU) goods mean that local industry and
agriculture will be less protected from international competition
than in the past.
</P>
<P>
"The private sector must look to overseas markets and offer
high quality products and services at competitive prices while
the public sector must aim to reduce operating costs and
increase effectiveness," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He called on local entrepreneurs to diversify their markets
and take advantage of the opportunities offered in Central and
Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union republics as well as
the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the view that the local economy will develop
further in 1997 and obtain a higher rate of growth.

<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, Oct 21 (Xinhua) -- A traffic route linking Sarajevo
with the Muslim enclave of Gorazde was formally opened Sunday, a
spokesman for the NATO-led Implementation Force(IFOR) said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The route was a single-lane and gravel-paved track 125
kilometers long, of which some 75 kilometers was built by IFOR
engineering troops, said IFOR spokesman Simon Haselock.
</P>
<P>
It took 600 soldiers from ten countries nine months to build
the track. Two soldiers died in an accident during construction.
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton agreement, Western countries agreed to help
build a modern highway between Sarajevo and Gorazde, which was
surrounded by Serb-controlled territory.
</P>
<P>
However, international donors have yet to provide money for it,
Haselock said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Privatisation Needs Proper Strategy, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 21 (Xinhua) -- There is need for clear
strategies and procedures to be followed if any privatisation of
public enterprises is to succeed, Zimbabwe's Industry and
Commerce Deputy Minister Obert Mpofu said here today.
</P>
<P>
Opening a two-week workshop on public enterprise restructuring
and privatisation in Harare, Mpofu said disposal and
privatisation of state enterprises should not be carried out in a
haphazard manner.
</P>
<P>
He said, ''the government should not be caught in a situation
where the objective is merely to dispose of often loss-making
state enterprises regardless of the cost to the government and
the nation as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
He stressed, ''there is need to put in place elaborate
programs for public enterprise reform that will lead to the
successful transformation of these enterprises into productive
and profitable enterprises, thereby promoting employment creation
and economic growth.''
</P>
<P>
While objectives of privatisation programs might vary from one
country to another, in Zimbabwe the objectives would include
facilitation of economic growth and indigenisation of the
economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out, ''one of the most important objectives of the
privatisation program in Zimbabwe is the indigenisation of the
economy through a trust fund arrangement.'' enditem

<HEADLINE> Russian Premier to Sign Package of Accords in Kiev </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin will sign a package of bilateral agreements during
his official visit to Ukraine early next month, Russian Deputy
Premier Valery Serov said today.
</P>
<P>
"A large package of bilateral agreements, including agreements
on the division of the Black Sea Fleet and the status of
Sevastopol, are expected to be concluded during Chernomyrdin's
stay in Kiev," Serov told the Interfax News Agency.
</P>
<P>
But the planned full-scale political treaty between the two
countries will not be signed.
</P>
<P>
Serov said, "It can be signed when understanding related to all
aspects of Russian-Ukrainian relations, including the Black Sea
Fleet, are carried out."
</P>
<P>
Serov described Chernomyrdin's forthcoming visit as "a good
chance to state Russia`s credo in relations with Ukraine".
</P>
<P>
The Russian premier`s Kiev trip has been delayed several times,
mainly because of a dispute between the two countries over the
division of the former Soviet Union-era Black Sea Fleet.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about current bilateral trade and economic ties, Serov
said that in the first half of the year bilateral trade volume
grew 46 percent while Russia's trade turnover with the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) as a whole only went up
36 percent.
</P>
<P>
He said the most promising form of economic integration was
cooperation between industrial and financial bodies and the
formation of international financial-industrial groups.
</P>
<P>
The Russian side has a special interest in nuclear power
engineering, the aluminium industry and aircraft-engine
manufacturing, the Russian deputy premier said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to long-term bilateral cooperation with Ukraine,
Serov spoke of possible agreements with third countries on free
trade, customs and domestic legislation as well as the exchange of
information to coordinate economic reforms.

BRUSSELS, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has
become the only major foreign investor in Central and Eastern
European Countries (CEECs) with an investment of 8.214 million
ECUs (some 10.7 million U.S. dollars) from 1992 to 1994.
</P>
<P>
The EU's foreign investment in CEECs accounted for some 13
percent of its total foreign direct investment (FDI) in the rest

<P>
The FDI in CEECs equaled the total FDI by the EU in South
America with 7 percent of its FDI, plus newly-industrialized
countries of Asia and China with another 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the CEECs received only 2 percent of the total FDI

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Israeli former Prime
Minister Shimon Perez said in Cape Town today that there is
little chance of prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu being ousted
in the near future.
</P>
<P>
"I don't see it right now," he told journalists, adding: "We
have foolishly changed our electoral system and that makes it
even more complicated."
</P>
<P>
The visiting former Israeli leader also ruled out the
possibility of a military coup. "Not in our country," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said there is a growing tide of opposition to Netanyahu's
policies, but there is no objective way of measuring it.
</P>
<P>
"Ostensibly all people are for peace, and the process would
have to go ahead," he added.
</P>
<P>
Perez had met with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat a few
weeks ago and explained the views of the Israeli opposition. He
had not assumed the role of intermediary between the Israeli
government and the Palestinians, he said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat thought "the government did not have any capacity for
decision making," Perez said.
</P>
<P>
Perez is in South Africa for a visit. He held talks with

<HEADLINE> S.African Spy Denies Palme Murder Allegations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Johannesburg, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Former South African
security police spy Craig Williamson today denied allegations
that he was involved in the 1986 assassination of Swedish Prime
Minister Olof Palme.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a media briefing at his attorney's office in
Johannesburg, Williamson said he was not in any way involved in
the assassination, nor did he know anything about it.
</P>
<P>
Palme, who spoke out against South Africa's apartheid
policies, was gunned down in a street in Stockholm. Police have
yet to expose the killer's identity or motives.
</P>
<P>
Williamson said although Palme was not considered "a friend"
by the South African Authorities at the time, he was "opposed to
Soviet-style marxism" and was therefore not seen as a threat to
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
His attorney Allen Levin said he and Williamson had met Glen
Goosen, head of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's
investigation unit, and Williamson will make a submission to the
commission.
</P>
<P>
Williamson arrived in South Africa yesterday after being freed
from a jail in Luanda, Angola.
</P>
<P>
He was arrested two weeks ago by Angolan Authorities during a
police operation aimed at clearing the country of illegal alins.
</P>
<P>
While in detention in Angola, Williamson was questioned by
Swedish investigators regarding the allegations by former South
African Police Commander, Eugene de Kock, that Williamson was
involved in Palme's assassination.

<HEADLINE> Time Ripe to Turn Tianjin into North's China Economic Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Economists and government
officials attending an on-going seminar in Tianjin said today that
it is time to turn the port city into the economic center of north
China.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that the establishment of a regional economic
center will push forward economic development in north China as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
With rich land resources, 120 square kilometers of coastal
waste land and shoals available for development, and a solid
science and education foundation, Tianjin believes it has every
reason to become the economic center of north China.
</P>
<P>
Through hard efforts over the past 18 years, China has formed
two economic centers, the Pearl River and the Yangtze River Delta
areas, which have played a significant role in boosting the
economic development in south and central China.
</P>
<P>
The seminar has been jointly sponsored by the Research and
Development Center under the State Council, and Tianjin
Municipality.

<HEADLINE> UK Government Denies Arms-for-Oil Deal With Argentina </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The British government has
flatly denied a press report saying that it had agreed to a secret
plan to re-equip the Argentine navy in return for a lucrative deal
to explore for oil in the disputed waters around the Falklands
(Malvinas).
</P>
<P>
A British Foreign Office spokesman denied this allegation today
and insisted that the country's weapons embargo against Argentina
remained in force.
</P>
<P>
"The embargo has not been relaxed. There is absolutely no link
between the joint declaration with Argentina on oil exploration in
the South Atlantic and the arms embargo," the spokesman said in a
statement issued earlier today.
</P>
<P>
The Observer newspaper reported Sunday that the Rolls-Royce
would be allowed to open negotiations with the Argentine side to
export key components to the Argentine navy which would enable it
to repair engines in six of its major warships.
</P>
<P>
In return, the Argentine government would approve a three-way
deal to give British companies access to the potential oil
bonanzas in the South Atlantic and exploration licenses would be
awarded later this month.

<HEADLINE> Sino-German Workshop on Environment Cooperation Held in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 21 (Xinhua) -- More than 20 German environment
experts and industrial and commercial personnel attended the
Sino-German Workshop on Environment Cooperation here today.
</P>
<P>
During a brief meeting between Federal Deputy Chancellor and
Foreign Minister of Germany Klaus Kinkel, who is on a visit to
China, and China's State Bureau for Environmental Protection
Director Xie Zhenhua before the workshop opened, Kinkel praised
China for its "rapid economic development" in recent years and its
efforts on environmental protection. He said he hoped that the
workshop will promote the cooperation between the environmental
protection industries of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Xie Zhenhua told Xinhua that China introduced 2.7 billion US
dollars worth of foreign funds for the environmental protection
during the Eighth Five-year Plan (1991-1995) period and plans to
introduce four billion US dollars into the field in the coming
five years.
</P>
<P>
He said that an agreement on the environmental protection
between China and Germany, signed in 1994, has promoted and
strengthened the bilateral cooperation in the area.
</P>
<P>
China and Germany have conducted much cooperation in the
environmental protection, he said, pointing out that the
cooperation mainly concentrates on personnel and technical
training and there should be more substantial cooperation, such as
the cooperation between the environmental protection industries.
</P>
<P>
According to Xie, the global environmental protection industry
now produces an output value of 300 billion US dollars, and the
figure is expected to rise to 600 billion US dollars by the year
2000. The environmental protection industry in the Asia-Pacific
region now has an output value of 30 billion US dollars, while
China produces only 40 billion yuan from its environmental
protection industry.
</P>
<P>
China has a large market for the environmental protection
industry, and the potential for cooperation in the field is huge,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Secretary General of China Association for Environmental
Protection Industry Jiang Xiaoyu gave a lecture at the workshop on
the development of China's environmental protection industry.
</P>
<P>
According to Jiang, China has launched "A Plan on the Control
of Overall Discharge of Pollutants" and "A Trans-Century Green
Project Plan". The first-phase green project includes one
thousand and several hundred pollution treatment projects, which
will require an investment of more than 180 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
This has set high standards for the development of the
environmental protection industry, but will also provide extremely
good opportunities for its development and a huge market for the
industry, she said.

TIRANA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Albanian President Sali Berisha
announced Monday that his ruling Democratic Party won the local
elections on Sunday.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban militia is
ready to accept an unconditional ceasefire with all factions in
Afghanistan, said a senior Taliban official today in Kabul.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from Kabul, acting Information and Culture
Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi made the statement after a proposed
ceasefire between the Taliban and forces of the ousted Afghan
government from 0730 GMT today failed to come into force.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, talks between Dostum and Pakistani Interior Minister
Nasirullah Babar ended today in Mazar-i-Sharif, Dostum's
headquarters in the north, without finalizing a ceasefire
agreement, said reports.
</P>
<P>
Dostum, who controls seven provinces in northern Afghanistan,
proposed a ceasefire among the warring factions on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Babar, shuttling among the Afghan factions trying to broker
peace talks, delivered the proposal to the Taliban leadership in
their southern headquarters of Kandahar, who initially put two
conditions on the ceasefire -- exchange of prisoners of war and a
12-member commission to monitor the ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Ahmad Shah Masood, military commander of the
ousted Afghan government who is only 12 kilometers away from
Kabul, also put condition of "demilitarization" of Kabul for
ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
Masood is making a quick come-back in the past few days,
advancing steadily toward Kabul, which was taken from the
government by the Taliban on September 27 after nearly a year of
besieging.

<HEADLINE> Downsizing Trend Slows in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The downsizing trend of U.S.
companies is slowing and the outlook for job creation is getting
bright, according to an annual survey of companies by the American
Management Association.
</P>
<P>
In a report out today, 46 percent of companies said they plan
to add jobs before July. In the same period, 21 percent plan job
cuts, but that's a drop from the 30 percent in last year's survey.
</P>
<P>
While the number of jobs is going up, companies still are
aggressively eliminating jobs that do not add value or give a
competitive advantage, according to the association.
</P>
<P>
About one-third of the companies cutting jobs are adding jobs
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
For example, AT&AMP;T cut 7,700 jobs through September but hired
almost as many in its wireless and other growing divisions.
</P>
<P>
And Xerox eliminated 400 jobs, mostly managerial staffs, during
the first half of the year, but added 1,200, mostly technicians
and professionals.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, 68 percent of companies created jobs
from July 1995 to June 1996.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak: EU Cannot Replace US in Mideast Politics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
today said Europe should play a role in the Middle East peace
process, but this does not replace the basic US role in the peace
march.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after touring the Sadat City, some 90
kilometers northwest of Cairo, Mubarak said French President
Jacques Chirac, a friend of Egypt, is making studious efforts in
support of the Palestinian cause.
</P>
<P>
Israel, which said it does not want the participation of
another mediator in the peace talks, sends about 70 percent of its
exports to the European market, he said.
</P>
<P>
European countries are a major financer to the Palestinians
and the Israelis and they deserve a role, the president added.
</P>
<P>
Asked about a proposal made by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
on convening an Arab summit within a couple of months with an
Iraqi participation, Mubarak said there should be a favorable
atmosphere and strong practical need to convene such a summit.
</P>
<P>
However, the difference between the Israelis and the
Palestinians over the implementation of the signed agreement does
not constitute a strong reason.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli recalcitrance on the overdue troops withdrawal from
the Last West Bank town of Hebron has prevented the two sides from
reaching any mechanism to implement the 1995 Taba agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli push for tougher security for the 450 Jewish
settlers among 200,000 Palestinians was blankly rejected by the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"Let us wait and see what will happen", Mubarak added.
</P>
<P>
On the Economic Conference for the Middle East and North Africa
slated for November 12-14 in Cairo, Mubarak said it serves the
interest of Egypt and is open to all foreign investors.

<P>
BEIJING, October 21 (Xinhua)-- China today issued a set of
three souvenir coins to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the
victory of the Long March by the Red Army, an important event in
China's revolutionary cause.
</P>
<P>
Sixty years ago, the Red Army, led by the Communist Party of
China (CPC), covered 12,500 kilometers, trekking through more than
a dozen provinces and municipalities, and strengthened its
military force through the great feat. It laid a solid foundation
for final victory and the founding of New China.
</P>
<P>
The set of commemorative coins include a gold and two silver
coins. The gold coin, issued with a face value of 50 yuan,
features the assembly hall of the revolutionary government in
Ruijin, with a picture of Chairman Mao Zedong carried on the other
side.
</P>
<P>
On the faces of the ten yuan-silver coins is the place where
the Zunyi Meeting was held, at which the leadership of Mao Zedong
in the CPC was established, and the Baota Mountain in Yan'an, the
revolutionary base in Shaanxi province.
</P>
<P>
The backs of the coins bear the image of Chairman Mao Zedong
riding a horse, and the victorious meeting of armies after the
victory of the Long March.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 6,000 gold and 20,000 silver coins have been minted.
</P>
<P>
"The Long March event is a historic monument and deserves a
lasting commemoration." said Chen Muhua, vice-chairman of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, at the
inauguration ceremony.
</P>
<P>
A group of Red Army veteran generals also attended the
inauguration ceremony, which was held at the Great Hall of the

<HEADLINE> China to Start New Health Care Program Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 21 (Xinhua) -- China is to start a new health
care program on January 1, 1997 in 57 cities nationwide, according
to a senior official.
</P>
<P>
State Councillor Peng Peiyun today told a teleconference on
health care system reforms for the nation's employees, that it is
of great importance to create a medical insurance system combining
company or work unit health funds, with individual health accounts.
</P>
<P>
The move is aimed at guaranteeing basic health care for
workers, controlling the use of medical funds, easing the burden
on the State and enterprises, boosting a reasonable flow of
laborers, and promoting the reform of health care system.
</P>
<P>
A total of 57 medium and small-sized cities in 27 provinces,
autonomous regions and municipalities have already taken part in
the reforms. Some cities have formulated concrete plans of action,
and put them into effect.
</P>
<P>
According to the new program, workers' medical costs will be
shared by the State, companies or work units, and
individuals. Medical costs of employees in China used to be
totally paid by the State and the enterprises they worked with.
</P>
<P>
Peng said the new system will provide basic health care for all
the workers in urban areas, while keeping pace with the
development of China's productivity.
</P>
<P>
When employees become ill, they will be able to have access to
necessary and affordable medical care and treatment, she said.
</P>
<P>
Companies and work units will pay about 10 percent of the
medicare, equal to 10 percent of their total salary, according to
the new program.
</P>
<P>
It is imperative that all departments and organizations of the
central government, and provincial governments, be part of a local
health care system, she said.
</P>
<P>
The experimental work of the new system started in east China's
booming city of Zhenjiang, in Jiangsu Province, and Jiujiang, in
Jiangxi Province, and was extended to other parts of the country
in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Color Chaos Pollutes UK's High Streets: Architect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Many of Britain's high streets
are a visual mess inflicting "color pollution" on those who live
and work there, according to the author of a new book on color
and the environment.
</P>
<P>
Michael Lancaster, a landscape architect and color consultant,
urges planning authorities to set up color advisory groups to help
set guidelines for the appearance of towns and cities.
</P>
<P>
If do not, he warns, the current decline into visual chaos will
prevail. "Most of the high streets in Britain are a mess.
Commercial interests have gained the upper hand and this has been
without reference to color."
</P>
<P>
The author says that while the use of various lurid shades all
in the same area may have a role -- for example in a fairground --
it also has its limitations. "At some point you reach saturation.
People also need a restful environment."
</P>
<P>
Lancaster's new book, Colorscape, is an attempt to explain the
importance of color to the environment and in particular to
architecture. In his introduction, he points out that while many
people may look at colors, they often fail to absorb their full
impact."
</P>
<P>
"This would provide an explanation for the fact that so much of
what might be regarded as visual pollution -- in the form of
industrial dereliction, massed advertisement hoardings and simply
litter -- ofter goes unnoticed," he says.
</P>
<P>
Lancaster puts some of the blame on schools which do not teach
enough awareness of architecture and the impact of color in modern
environment. He says the role of color is largely ignored by most
architects and architectural schools.

<HEADLINE> UN-Sponsored Military Talks in Cyprus to Begin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Military talks among the
United Nations, the Greek Cypriot side and the Turkish
military forces in Cyprus are due to begin in the next few
days.
</P>
<P>
This was announced today by Cyprus government spokesman
Yiannakis Cassoulides, who told the press briefing that the talks
will start with military chiefs of its National Guard (NG) and
the Turkish troops in the island state.
</P>
<P>
The United States first proposed a dialogue between the
military commanders of the N.G. and Turkish forces in
July when U.S. permanent representative to the U.N. Madeleine
Albright visited the island.
</P>
<P>
But the dialogue never got off the ground because of a
Turkish Cypriot demand to participate.
</P>
<P>
Cassoulides said that during this morning's meeting between
President Glafcos Clerides and U.N. Secretary General's resident
representative, Gustave Feissel, it was agreed that
U.N. Peacekeeping Forces in Cyprus (UNFICYP) representatives meet
"very soon" with the NG's chiefs of staff to discuss matters
aimed to reduce tension along the cease-fire line.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that if and when an agreement is reached
on banning the use of live ammunition along the cease-fire line,
the UNFICYP should observe its implementation through unwarned
inspections.
</P>
<P>
After his meeting with President Clerides earlier today,
Feissel said that military talks among the U.N. and the
Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides on unmanning along the
cease-fire line are already underway and that the U.N. has
"specific proposals" to put forward to both sides in this regard.
</P>
<P>
An unmanning agreement was reached between the Greek and
Turkish Cypriot sides in 1989.
</P>
<P>
The current U.N. peace initiative came after a series of
tragic incidents happened in the past few months during which
four unarmed Greek Cypriots were killed along the buffer zone
and one Turkish soldier was found dead on his sentry post.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek Cypriot south and
Turkish Cypriot north since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded and
seized the northern third of the island following an
Athens-backed coup.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania needs a
concertd efforts and determination to boost its poor export
trade.
</P>
<P>
The advice was made in Der es Salaam today by the Minister for
Industries and Trade, Abdallah Kigoda when he officially opened a
week-long national seminar on the Uruguay Round table.
</P>
<P>
The minister told about 60 participants from governments,
public and private institutions, that in 1994, Tanzania's total
exports were of worth 519.4 million U.S. Dollars and imports
worth 1.3 billiion U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said Tanzania has therefore to boost its poor exports.
</P>
<P>
"We have a long way to go, Tanzanias have to face the future
with great understanding and determination to challenge problems
hindering trade development," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Kigoda said that trade has become the veritable engine of the
world economic growth through the 20th century with
interdependence of countries on each other for commodities and
services.
</P>
<P>
On global trade, the minister said that The African continent
had only a two percen share of the world trade in 1994 compared
to Asia which had the lion's cake of 25 percent in the developing
world.
</P>
<P>
He further said Africa had a long way to go to compete
effectively in global trade.
</P>
<P>
The minister said while Asia was followed by South America
which had a five percent share, the Middle East and Central Asian
economies at about three percent, Western Europe had a 43 percent
share and the developed America about 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Kigoda said Tanzania participated in the Uruguay meeting
because it was imperative to be better integrated into the wolrd
trade to face the development challenges in the face of
globalizaion and liberalization.
</P>
<P>
He told the participants that there was need to have a
framework on international cooperation provinding for workable,
measurable and practical realisation and access to internaional
markets. enditem

<HEADLINE> US Peace Coordinator Leaves for Home as Hebron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Middle East peace
Coordinator Dennis Ross announced today that he was returning to
the U.S. as a redeployment deal on Hebron still needed to be
worked out between Israel and the Palestinian Authority (PA).
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in Jerusalem this afternoon, Ross said
that he was returning to Washington to consult with U.S. Secretary
of State Warren Christopher.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Ross informed Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu of his decision during the consultations which were
also attended by Foreign Minister David Levy, Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai and U.S. Ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk.
</P>
<P>
Ross, who has played a key role in the Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations over the past two weeks, said that he will be
ready to return to the Middle East when his services are
needed.
</P>
<P>
Ross said that there were still delicate issues to be
negotiated between Israel and the PA. He stressed that there
would be a continued active U.S. role in the negotiations between
the Israelis and Palestinians, disclosing the two sides would
enter negotiations on technical matters in a week's time.
</P>
<P>
"I expect to return when I think time is right and
proper," the U.S. envoy said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hassan Asfour, one of the chief Palestinian
negotiators, told Palestinian Radio today that Ross was
returning to the U.S. for consultations, and that he will be
back in the region "only in a week."
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio revealed this morning that the peace coordinator
was weighing the possibility of leaving the region if a Hebron
redeployment deal could not be worked out by the end of this week.
</P>
<P>
The report pointed out that Ross's decision may give impetus
to wrap up the talks, but it could also be interpreted publicly
as a sign of failure, and even a sign of danger to trigger
further violence.
</P>
<P>
Assuming it could take 10 days to actually implement a
Hebron redeployment, the accord would have to be concluded
this week for the implementation to take effect before the U.S.
presidential elections on November 5.
</P>
<P>
However, as Ross is leaving and will be returning to the region
only in a week, it is now difficult to say whether Israel and the
PA can reach an agreement in time.
</P>
<P>
The redeployment of Israeli troops from Hebron, the last West
Bank town still under Israeli occupation, has been a hard nut to
crack in the resumed Palestinian-Israeli negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Wanted Greek Criminal Shot Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Greek police shot dead a wanted
criminal outside an Athens hospital today after he ignored calls
to surrender and fired on police closing in on him.
</P>
<P>
Pavlos Keremidis, a 45-year-old notorious criminal, went to the
Igeia hospital in the northern part of Athens to visit a women
friend of his where he was encountered by the police.
</P>
<P>
Keremidis escaped from the Alikarnassos prison on the island of
Crete in 1989 and has been accused of killing two policemen trying
to arrest him. According to police, he stole an automatic weapon
from one of them.
</P>
<P>
He was arrested a few months after his escape and taken to the
Trikala prison in central Greece from where he escaped again
together with 14 other inmates.
</P>
<P>
Police said he had created a gang comprised of Russians and
Ukrainians and robbed banks.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, police believe that Keremidis was the mastermind
behind the kidnapping of well-known Greek industrialist Alexandros
Haitoglou and for whose release he had demanded 400 million
drachmas (1.73 million U.S. dollars) in ransom.
</P>
<P>
Police had issued a reward for 250 million drachmas (1.08
million dollars) for information leading to the arrest of
Keremidis.

<HEADLINE> Iraq to Buy 300 Trucks from Turkey to Transport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Iraq agreed to buy 300
trucks from Turkey to transport food and medicine to its capital
Baghdad in accordance with an oil-for-food deal signed with the
United Nations in May this year, the Iraqi news agency (INA)
reported today.
</P>
<P>
This decision was announced by Sami al-Mashhadani,
director-general of Iraq's State Company for Land Transport, who
recently paid a four-day visit to Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Al-Mashhadani said that Turkey has agreed to sell 300 brand
new trucks to Iraq, and a new plan was also worked out to
transport some of Iraq's imports of food and medicine under the
oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi-U.N. oil plan allows Iraq to sell two billion U.S.
dollars worth of oil in six months in exchange for badly-needed
food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies for its
sanctions-hit population.
</P>
<P>
Since then, quite a number of Turkish commercial delegations
have visited Iraq trying to reactivate trade exchange between the
two countries, according to INA.

<HEADLINE> French FM Arrives in Egypt to Fix Chirac's Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 21 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Herve de
Charette said today that Europe and France can play an important
role in facilitating the Middle East peace process toward a prompt
and just solution.
</P>
<P>
The French minister made the remarks after meeting with his
Egyptian counterpart Amr Moussa on the latest developments of the
Middle East region.
</P>
<P>
De Charette arrived this afternoon to prepare for a visit by
French President Jacques Chirac, slated for Friday, in conclusion
of his six-leg Middle East tour designed to bolster French and
European peace efforts in the region.
</P>
<P>
De Charette, who did not accompany Chirac to Israel today,
would make preparations for Chirac's talks with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak during his several-hour brief visit here.
</P>
<P>
During a joint press conference with Syrian President Hafez
Assad Sunday, Chirac said "I did not come here to teach people
lessons."
</P>
<P>
"I (am) simply saying that we are availale and that we have
valid reasons to be involved. A certain balance of things may
justify the presence of Europe and of France," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chirac appeared to give his support to Syria's call for Israeli
withdrawl from the Golan Heights, which Israel seized from Syria
during the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
"There shall be no security without peace," he said during a
banquet in Damascus Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
"The principle of land for peace remains the basis for any
agreement. This holds for the Syrian territory of the Golan
Heights and I shall say so tomorrow in Israel."
</P>
<P>
Syria, a former French colony, has repeated calls for a bigger
European role in the peace march in the region.
</P>
<P>
However, Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy has said there was
no need for another mediator in Arab-Israeli negotiations and such
ambitions could be harmful.
</P>
<P>
Chirac, who flew on to Israel today for what seems to be the most
difficult stage of his seven-day tour of the region, also praised
the U.S. role.
</P>
<P>
Washington has over the past two decades played the key role
in helping forge peace agreements in the Middle East. These have
so far involved Israel, Egypt, Jordan and Palestine.
</P>
<P>
Chirac will also visit Jordan, Lebanon and the Palestinian
self-rule areas.

<HEADLINE> Iran Criticizes Pakistan for Supporting Taliban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Ali
Akbar Velayati today criticized Pakistan for its support to the
militant Taliban in Afghanistan, saying that "outside interference
will complicate the Afghan crisis."
</P>
<P>
Velayati told Zafar Helali, the Pakistan special envoy sent
by Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, that no single faction in
Afghanistan is capable of forming an "absolute government" in
Afghanistan by keeping out other groups from the political
scene.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the statement by the Iranian
foreign minister gave vent to Iran's anger over the setback in
its foreign policy on the Afghan issue.
</P>
<P>
The Tehran government lost a political game to Pakistan, which
got high points in backing the Taliban group to oust former
Afghan president Buranuddin Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
Iran maintains that the Taliban has flourished as a result of
U.S. planning, Saudi financial support and Pakistan's logistical
backing.
</P>
<P>
The seizure of the Kabul by the Taliban has strained the
relations between Tehran and Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
Velayati said "the Afghan crisis was an old and complicated
question and that the Islamic Republic of Iran believes that
there is no military solution to it."
</P>
<P>
He also emphasized Iran's readiness to help restore peace and
stability in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani envoy said that his country is ready to cooperate
 with Iran in efforts to bring peace to the war-torn Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his government's concern over the recent developments
in Afghanistan and its impact on the security of the region,
he indicated that his country believes that all Afghan factions
and ethnic groups should join hands to set up a broad-based
government in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Zafar Helali arrived here this morning carrying a message
from Bhutto for President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani in a bid
to iron out difference on the Afghan issue.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Allaedin
Boroujerdi, he said that Pakistan will never turn its back
to Iran.

<P>
OTTAWA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Canadian investigators pulled
out today the bodies of eight Americans from the wreckage of a
plane that crashed Sunday on the northern shore of New Brunswick
Province.
</P>
<P>
Most of the victims were policemen from the U.S. state of
Massachusetts, who were returning from an elk-hunting trip on
Anticosti Island, Quebec, in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, according
to local media reports.
</P>
<P>
Investigators from the Canadian Transportation Safety Board are
in a process of examining the wreckage to determine what caused
the crash.
</P>
<P>
"The autopsies will hopefully begin today as a means of
positively identifying all the victims," a Canadian official was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Inspectors from the American Transportation Safety Board are
expected to arrive at the crash site today, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The twin-engine plane was on its way Sunday to the U.S. state
of Maine when it radioed that it was having mechanical problems.
</P>
<P>
It attempted to land at a nearby airstrip at Carlo, on New
Brunswick's northern shore, narrowly missed several homes before
crashing and exploding in a field, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
The plane is owned by a small U.S. charter flying company
Telford Aviation of Waterville, Maine. So far, the company has not
decline to make comments on the crash.

<HEADLINE> France Keen on Saving Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 21 (Xinhua) -- In an apparent talkback to the
Israeli discontent, French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette said
here today France need not ask anyone for permission to help the
troubled Middle East peace process tide over difficulties.
</P>
<P>
The French minister arrived here this afternoon to prepare for
a visit to Egypt by French President Jacques Chirac Friday. Egypt
is the last leg of his six-nation Middle East tour designed to
bolster French and European role in the peace drive in the region.
</P>
<P>
Fresh from his meeting with Arab League Secretary General Esmat
Abdel Meguid this evening, de Charette stressed France's keenness
to revive the faltering peace march.
</P>
<P>
"France adds a European visualization to the peace process out
of keenness on helping full-fledged peace prevail in the whole
region," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said France has a clear-cut "mid-way stance," and dismissed
the Israeli accusation that France is biased toward the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
Israel has said there was no need for another mediator in
Arab-Israeli negotiations and such ambitions could be harmful.
</P>
<P>
Abdel Meguid characterized the French role as a purposeful one
that is not meant to embarrass any country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he expressed thanks to the U.S. for its "important
and principal role" in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Europe does not want its role to be confined to funding some
of the Palestinian projects," said Abdel Meguid, stressing that
Europe is bent on realising stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
Abdel Meguid praised the French support for all Arab countries,
especially Lebanon, Eritrea and Yemen.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Raises Issue of Nazi Criminal Hiding in Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 21 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
raised the issue of a Nazi criminal believed to be hiding in Syria
during his talks with Syrian President Hafez Al-Assad on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Agence France Presse (AFP) quoted a French official
accompanying Chirac on his tour in the Middle East as saying today
in Haifa, Israel, that Chirac insisted on France's demand for
cooperation from Syria in hunting down the Nazi criminal named
Alois Brunner.
</P>
<P>
A new French rotating commission in charge of the issue was
lately set up by an investigation judge in charge of the files of
Brunner, who has sent relevant documents to the Syrian government,
said the AFP.
</P>
<P>
Chirac asked Al-Assad to allow the French judge to go to Syria
and investigate on the site, said the official.
</P>
<P>
According to Western sources, Brunner has been living in Syria
for years.
</P>
<P>
Damascus has denied the allegation.
</P>
<P>
The Simon Wiesenthal Center, which is in charge of hunting Nazi
criminals around the world, said that Brunner, who is now living
in Damascus under the pseudonym of Georg Fisher, is responsible
for the death and deportation of 143,000 people, including several
thousand French citizens, during World War II.
</P>
<P>
"The latest information concerning Brunner still has shown his
presence in Damascus," said Shimon Samuels, the head of the
European section of the Wiesenthal Center, in a recent letter to
Chirac.
</P>
<P>
Chirac also raised with Assad the issue of an Israeli pilot
named Ron Arad, who was shot down by Syrian troops in 1986 and is
believed to be in captivity in Syria.
</P>
<P>
Chirac will meet the family of Arad during his visit in Israel,
AFP quoted French officials as saying.

<HEADLINE> France Backs Turkey to Deepen Integration with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- French Minister-Delegate in
Charge of European Affairs Michel Barnier today assured Turkey of
France's support for Turkey's bid for closer integration with
Europe.
</P>
<P>
Barnier, who arrived here today for the 75th anniversary of
the Ankara Agreement his country signed with Turkey, made the
pledge in a joint press conference with Turkish Deputy Prime
Minister and Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller.
</P>
<P>
He said: "We attach great importance to Turkey growing
roots in Europe, therefore we think that the Ankara protocol
-- Turkey signed with the then EC for associate membership
and eventual full membership -- should be honored."
</P>
<P>
However, he warned that "integrating with Europe is not
merely entering a supermarket, and it also calls for integrating
with its political system."
</P>
<P>
The minister-delegate said that the European Union (EU) should
promote good neighborly ties between Turkey and Greece.
</P>
<P>
Ciller reasserted Turkey's determination to enter the EU as
a full member and warned that Ankara did not want to fall
behind the Eastern and Central European countries in securing
full membership.
</P>
<P>
According to informed sources, Turkish officials reminded the
visiting French official of the fact that Turkey was not among
the 12 candidate countries slated for EU membership, which
aroused discontent among the Turkish people.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Barnier was here on a fact finding
mission on behalf of President Jacques Chirac who is scheduled
to pay an official visit to Turkey in 1997.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the French official stressed that Chirac
attaches great importance to Turkey and acts as its chief
supporter in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Barnier also said Chirac will continue to act like Turkey's
lawyer in Europe, but cautioned that Turkey too has to
defend its own rights and interests forcefully.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 21 (Xinhua) -- More than 2.8 million tourists
visited Egypt from January to September in 1996, up 25 percent
over the same period last year, a top Egyptian tourism official
said today.
</P>
<P>
The tourists spent 18 million nights, which constitutes a 17
percent increase over the same period last year, Minister of
Tourism Mamdouh el-Beltagui said before kicking off a trip by 183
British tourists on bikes from the Pyramids Plateau to Sinai, a
triangular peninsula bordering Asia and Africa.
</P>
<P>
The trip fits in the Ministry of Tourism's promotion campaign,
especially in the British tourism market.
</P>
<P>
About 300,000 British tourists come to Egypt and spend 1.5
million nights a year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has the highest rate of tourist stay duration as tourists
spend an average of 6.7 nights here, while elsewhere in the world,
the average is four nights.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has predicted an unprecedented 3.7 million tourists for
1996.
</P>
<P>
Tourism, one of the country's top four money-spinners, absorbs
large number of people and serves as an instrument for enhancing
international understanding and buttressing world peace, he
added.

<HEADLINE> US Official: KDP Leader Willing to Conclude </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Assistant Secretary of
State Robert Pelletreau said today that he had found Leader of
Iraq's Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) Massoud Barzani is willing
to conclude a cease-fire with its rival -- the Patriotic Union of
Kurdistan (PUK).
</P>
<P>
Pelletreau made the remarks after meeting with Barzani in the
Turkish border town of Silopi, Sirnak province, which borders
northern Iraq, in a bid to work out a solution to the prolonged
bitter clashes between the two Kurdish parties.
</P>
<P>
Pelletreau said that he had stressed to the Kurdish leader the
importance of seeing that neither Iraq nor Iran interfered with
the inter-Kurdish fighting in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Pelletreau is scheduled to meet PUK leader Jalal Talabani
in Ankara Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. envoy met with KDP and PUK officials last week
in Washington in an attempt to bring a truce between the two
sides and to convince the KDP to cut its ties with the
Iraqi government.
</P>
<P>
Barzani threatened last week to call for help from Baghdad
again if things developed to the KDP's detriment on the
battlefield.
</P>
<P>
The KDP captured a series of major towns in northern Iraq
in a Baghdad-backed operation last month, forcing the U.S. to
evacuate many of its security and intelligence workers from the
region.
</P>
<P>
In a recent offensive, the PUK recaptured much of its
lost ground including Sulaimaniya, one of the biggest cities in
northern Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Kornblum Trys to Tackle Bosnian Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, October 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Assistant Secretary of
State John Kornblum arrived here on Monday, to mediate disputes
among the three ethnic nations of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival, Kornblum met separately with the three
members of the newly-elected presidency, Alija Izetbegovic of the
Muslim side, Kresimir Zubak of the Croat side and Momcilo
Krajisnik of the Serb side who, escorted by Nato soldiers, came
from his headquarters in Pale to the U.S. embassy here for the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The three members met only once since their election in
September and the dispute mainly between Izetbegovic and Krajisnik
on the site of their next meetings has stalled the work of joint
institutions set up under the Dayton peace accords.
</P>
<P>
Krajisnik reportedly proposed holding meetings of the
presidency alternately in the Muslim-Croat federation and the Serb
republic to emphasize the equality of the two Bosnian entities,
while Izetbegovic insisted on their meeting in the central part of
Sarajevo to stress the unity of the country.
</P>
<P>
Kornblum also had to deal with the problems of local elections
which was tentatively scheduled for November 23 to 24. But it was
criticized by European officials as too hasty, and the Serb side
threatened to boycott if rules they disliked were not changed.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Three Gorges Resettlement Meeting Calls for Concerted Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, October 22 (Xinhua) -- A national meeting to discuss
the resettlement of people living in the Three Gorges Project
area, the world's largest water conservancy program, has called
for concerted efforts to ensure the damming of the river is a
success in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua said at the seven-day meeting,
which ended in Yichang on Sunday, that the central government, all
departments under the State Council, and provinces and
municipalities, should strengthen their support for the
resettlement work.
</P>
<P>
Zou stressed that the primary task is to resettle and relocate
people who are directly affected by the damming of the river. He
added that the resettlement work will be even harder after the
damming is finished, so departments and people concerned should
have a clear understanding of the situation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the management of the resettlement funds, the
vice-premier said that measures must be taken to ensure the
resettlement funds are primarily used in the work of relocating
people.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Premier Li Peng inspected the dam site from October 17
to 20, and pointed out that the success of the Three Gorges
Project hinges on the smooth resettlement of people living in the
huge reservoir area.

<HEADLINE> Time of Jobs for Life Gone in Netherlands: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The days of "jobs for life"
are gone in the Netherlands, according to an official publication
which appeared today in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The booklet, entitled Working and Learning in the Netherlands
1996, presents a cohesive picture of the labor market and the
education system in the country.
</P>
<P>
The share of part-time workers in total employment, and the
growth in that share, are greater in the Netherlands than in
neighboring countries, says the booklet.
</P>
<P>
The book notes that working with computers and large quantities
of information are becoming ever more important, as are the
ability to empathize and communication skills.
</P>
<P>
The strength of the Netherlands lies in its high knowledge
level and labor productivity, but high labor costs are one of its
weaknesses, says the booklet.

<HEADLINE> Zhu Rongji on China's Economic Growth (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji
said today that the country's economy has developed in a
sustained, rapid, healthy and stable way.
</P>
<P>
Meeting a group of well-known entrepreneurs in Beijing from
international information and financial circles, led by Raymond
Ch'ien, president of the Lam Soon Hong Kong Group, Zhu said that
over the past years, China's economy has maintained an annual
growth rate of about nine percent, and it is expected to reach to
about ten percent this year.
</P>
<P>
He noted that inflation rate was as high as 21.8 percent in
1994, but it will be down to below 6.5 percent this year. It is
possible to control it to six percent next year.
</P>
<P>
The country's foreign exchange reserve has greatly increased,
and is expected to rise to 100 billion U.S. dollars at the end of
next month, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Zhu said China has announced the free convertibility
of the Renminbi under the current account (trade, tourist items
and labor services) which will greatly help improve the
environment for investment.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three years, China has absorbed an annual average
of 30 billion U.S. Dollars in foreign funds, and this year the figure
will increase to more than 37 Billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, it is totally unnecessary to worry about China's
ability to make payments while doing business in China, and
lending money to the country.
</P>
<P>
The topic of China's economy was one of three that Zhu talked
about to the visitors during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The second topic covered the development of China's
tele-communications.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that tele-communications in China have developed
rapidly, and its information market is large.
</P>
<P>
Noting that about 20 million telephones were newly installed
throughout the country last year, the annual growth figure will
surely not be lower than the level of last year, he said.

China is striving for the realization of economic and
information modernizations, and accelerating its efforts to
establish various networks, such as those in banks, tax collection
and customs throughout the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
All in all, the market in China's information industry is
indeed huge, and it needs to strengthen cooperation with foreign
corporations, he added.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, Zhu stressed that China's adherence to Deng Xiaoping's
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and
implementing the policy of reform and opening to the outside
world, remains unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Especially after Hong Kong's return to the motherland next
year, he said China will carry out the principles of "one country,
two systems", "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong", and a
high-degree of autonomy.
</P>
<P>
This will be conducive not only to maintaining Hong Kong's
stability and prosperity, but also to promoting economic growth of
China's inland areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that China is willing to cooperate with foreign
companies on the basis of principles of equality and mutual
benefit, and hopes that they will have the interest in the
country's market.

He said it was of course impossible to say that there is no
small risk in cooperation, adding: "But I think that such a risk
is extremely small."

<TEXT>
<P>
In the speech, Jiang spoke highly of Zunyi Meeting, which was
held in Zunyi City, Guizhou Province, during the early days of
Long March.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said in the course of the meeting, the Party and the Red
Army, summarized lessons learned from setbacks which the army
suffered in the fifth battle against encirclement and suppression,
launched by the Kuomintang army.
</P>
<P>
The meeting marked an end of domination of "Left" adventurism
in the Party, and finally determined Mao Zedong's leadership, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Our Party came to realize that only through combining basic
principles of Marxism-Leninism, with the practical conditions of
China, and dealing with major problems of the Chinese revolution
independently, could we lead the revolutionary cause to victory,
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"This was a very important indicator of our Party's maturity
theoretically and politically, and it also marked a new stage of
development of the Chinese revolution," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
To combine basic principles of Marxism-Leninism with China's
practice, was the fundamental theoretical base for the Party to
formulate correct guidelines and policies and take our own road in
a creative way, to achieve continuous successes in the Party's and
people's causes, he said.
</P>
<P>
"This truth has been proven repeatedly by China's practice in
the new-democratic revolution, the socialist revolution and
construction, and the current reform and opening-up practices, and
modernization drive," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also noted that the march created a Long March spirit for
the whole Party, and the people.
</P>
<P>
The spirit of the Long March means that it is necessary to
regard the fundamental interests of Chinese people high above all;
firmly believe just causes will finally succeed; sacrifice all in
order to save the nation and the people; adhere to principles of
maintaining independence and seeking truth from facts; and go
through thick and thin together with the masses, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"The spirit of the Long March is the best indicator of the
Chinese nation's spirit of being indomitable, and making
unremitting efforts to improve itself," he said, adding that it
has led Chinese revolution, and will continue to lead Chinese
modernization cause from victory to victory.

<HEADLINE> Buddhist Pilgrimage Tourism Urged in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 22 (Xinhua) -- A group of Nepali ministers
and lawmakers asked the government to speed up the development of
Lumbini in west Nepal to tap the city's great potential of
pilgrimage tourism, the official news agency RSS said today.
</P>
<P>
Nepal's tourism industry would undergo a sea change if proper
arrangements are made to attract pilgrim tourists to Lumbini, the
birthplace of Buddhism founder Sakyamuni, or Buddha, they said.
</P>
<P>
Some 30 cabinet members and MPs representing the Lumbini zone,
about 120 kilometers west of Kathmandu, recently held a meeting to
draw the government's attention to the all-round development of
the area, according to the RSS.
</P>
<P>
They called for the development of the infrastructure in
Lumbini and other places in the area closely associated with
Buddha's life and times.
</P>
<P>
The demands, contained in a memorandum earlier submitted to
Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, include those for an
international airport and a university in Lumbini, road
construction in the city and a tourism-oriented development
program in the area.
</P>
<P>
The group of dignitaries also called for the formation of a
joint parliamentary committee to mobilize the participation of the
government and lawmakers in the Lumbini development campaign and
seek international cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Hails Long March (4) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jiang said that, under the leadership of the CPC, Chinese
people of various ethnic groups are working hard to build China
into a prosperous, democratic and civilized socialist modernized
country.
</P>
<P>
"It's our new Long March to achieve this grand goal, which is
a glorious and arduous task," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The Party has created Deng Xiaoping's theory of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics, and established basic
lines and a series of principles and policies, as well as a
development strategy in three phases, and a cross-century
blueprint.
</P>
<P>
The crux of the matter for the moment, Jiang said, is to fully
implement those lines, principles and policies, and make enormous
and arduous efforts for the success of the new Long March.
</P>
<P>
Jiang pointed out that the Party now is in a peaceful environment,
and its major task is to develop social productive forces, and
promote the overall progress of society, with economic
construction at the core.
</P>
<P>
The cause we are carrying forward today is the continuation of
the revolutionary cause created by revolutionists of the old
generations, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the way of modernizing our socialist country, we are
inevitably confronted with various difficulties and risks, which
determines that we need to carry forward the Long March spirit,
and our party's tradition of hard struggle and plain living.
</P>
<P>
Jiang called on Chinese officials at all levels to take old
revolutionaries as models, and always keep in mind the purpose of
serving the people wholeheartedly.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Long March spirit should be carried forward
from generation to generation, in a move to encourage the whole
Chinese nation to work hard, and make new achievements on the
country's new Long March road of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Factions Fight for Strategic Pass </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban militia
and the ousted government forces are fighting today for the final
pass to Kabul, which lies just 12 kilometers away from the Afghan
capital.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Kabul said troops of the former government
military commander, Ahmad Shah Masood, fired rockets and tank
cannons at Taliban forces defending the Khair Kana pass and
heights above the pass.
</P>
<P>
"We have orders to advance and take the pass," ex-government
commander Sabir was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, who mounted their defenses on the Old Road, one of
the two main northern routes out of Kabul just two kilometers
below the pass, fired back at Masood's forces, which controlled
the heights east of the pass and the plains to the north.
</P>
<P>
The two forces are only one kilometer away from each other,
according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Taliban, who are waiting for the three-party
opposition alliance to sign a ceasefire agreement, rejected any
power-sharing deal with the former government.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban-run Radio Shariat quoted the acting head of the
militia's ruling council in Kabul, Mullah Mohammed Hassan, as
saying that there could be no political deal with the ex-regime.
</P>
<P>
"We will not make a joint government with those who have
destroyed this country over the past four and a half years,"
Hassan reportedly told UN Special Ambassador Norbert Holl.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue our Jehad (holy war against the former
government) until not even an inch of the Afghan territory is
under their control," the radio station said, quoting top Taliban
commander Maulawi Jalaluddin Haqani.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban took Kabul on September 27 but have in the past 10
days been fighting off a fierce assault by ex-government forces,
who are threatening the city for the first time since their
ouster.
</P>
<P>
Masood launched a guerrilla war against the Taliban two weeks
ago, a change in tactics which saw him quickly reclaim three key
strategic areas, reversing a three-week string of victories for
the Taliban militia in and around Kabul.

<HEADLINE> Ceasefire if Taliban Pull Out from Kabul: Dostum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan northern warlord
Rashid Dostum today demanded the Taliban militia leave Kabul as
condition for a ceasefire agreement, reports from Afghanistan said
today.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Yousif, chief spokesman of Dostum who controls seven
provinces in northern Afghanistan, said today, "If the Taliban do
not agree to our terms and do not leave Kabul, they will be
responsible for future fighting."
</P>
<P>
In Dostum's headquarters in the northern city of
Mazar-i-Sharif, the spokesman said, "We have found evidence that
foreign trainers are supporting the Taliban to continue the war.
But I do not want to name the country which is interfering."
</P>
<P>
Yousif said his faction wants a UN peacekeeping force for Kabul
or the presence of another neutral force.
</P>
<P>
He warned the Taliban that attacks on territory held by Dostum
would lead to retaliation.
</P>
<P>
Dostum initially proposed a ceasefire to the Taliban through
Pakistani Interior Minister Nasirullah Babar, who spent one week
in Afghanistan, trying to bring a ceasefire among warring
factions.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference here today after returning from
Afghanistan, Babar said the Taliban were willing to sign the
ceasefire agreement and were waiting for Dostum's reply, which
Babar thought would be positive.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Speaker Stresses Resistance Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Berri stressed that it was Lebanon's choice to continue the
resistance, to deepen the national unity, to strengthen the
people's confidence in the state and to consolidate the
Syrian-Lebanese relations of "common fate."
</P>
<P>
One hundred and twenty-one members of the 128-seat parliament
voted in favor of Berri, who had been the speaker of the last
parliament of 1992.
</P>
<P>
In his speech to the first general session of the new
parliament, Berri also underlined his country's adherence to
U.N. Security council Resolution 425, which calls for an
unconditional Israeli withdrawal from South Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"The Chamber of Deputies demands an eradication of the Israeli
occupation of our most loved land," the house speaker said,
adding that "Israel escalates its aggressive activities (in
South Lebanon) day by day."
</P>
<P>
He accused the Israeli government of Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu of attempting to push the peace process backward to
"the zero Point" and to impose its "understanding of security" on
the parties concerned in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Berri described Syria as "the closest brother of Lebanon,"
emphasizing that it always supported Lebanon's legitimacy, unity,
sovereignty and independence.
</P>
<P>
"What the two countries want are the same, that is their
peace, the just and comprehensive peace, and a human prosperity
in the two states," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the two countries should "help each other in
matters pertaining to their security and national interests."
</P>
<P>
Among the country's three top leaders, better-known as the
"Troika," Berri became the second who won a renewal of the
mandate after the last Parliament gave President Elias Hrawi a
three-year extension of his presidency last November.
</P>
<P>
Berri, a Shiite Moslem and a father of nine children, was born
in a family of Lebanese origin in Sierra Leone in 1938 and
received high education in the Faculty of Law in the Lebanese
University.
</P>
<P>
He joined the Lebanese pro-Syrian Amal Movement after the
civil war started in 1975 and become the group's leader in 1980.
</P>
<P>
Elie Frizli, the former deputy house speaker, was also
re-elected in today's parliamentary general session, with 115
deputies voting in his favor.
</P>
<P>
After the re-election of Berri, President Hrawi will start
Wednesday consultations to choose a new prime minister, reliable
official sources said.
</P>
<P>
The president, who has the constitutional right to name the
prime minister, will hear the view of each of the 128 deputies
and will name the majority choice.
</P>
<P>
A survey made by the Beirut leftist daily As-Safir said that
112 to 114 members of the unicameral house support a renewal of
incumbent Prime Minister Rafik Hariri's mandate.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President hails Long March (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The Long March was a big struggle between the revolutionary
force and counter-revolutionary force, between the bright fate and
the dark fate," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"It was a great turning point in the cause of the Chinese
revolution under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party,
from failure to victory," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The victory of the Long March is a solemn declaration to the
world that the Chinese Communist party and the people's army under
its leadership, which were armed with Marxist theory, and deeply
rooted in the people of the country's various ethnic
nationalities, are invincible," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The victory of the Long March had spread the views of the
Party, sown the seeds of revolution, and enhanced the impact of
the Party and the Red Army. The heroic deeds of the Long March had
greatly inspired the revolutionary fighting will of the Chinese
people, and shocked the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The victory of the Long March realized our Party's strategic
policy of going north to fight against the Japanese invasion, and
shifting the main forces of the Red Army to the forefront of
resisting the Japanese invasion," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Long March laid a solid foundation in setting up a united
front of resistance against the Japanese invasion, and enabling
the Red Army to become the backbone in the war against the
Japanese invasion," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The victory of the Long March preserved and strengthened the
revolutionary forces. The veteran Communist Party members, and Red
Army officers and soldiers who had been tempered in the Long March,
later became the most precious wealth of our Party and the
army. Many of them became the backbone of the Party, the Army and
the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The greatest significance of the victory of the Long March
was the establishment of Comrade Mao Zedong's leading position in
the Red Army and the Party Central Committee, and the formation of
the first-generation central collective leadership, with Comrade
Mao Zedong as the core. This is the critical guarantee for our
Party and the revolutionary cause to pull through difficulties,
and continuously open up new aspects," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Today, when we mark the victory of the Long March, we are
remembering the glorious deeds of the Red Army, summarizing the
historic experience of the Long March, carrying forward the
revolutionary spirit of the Long March, and continuously pushing
forward the great cause pioneered by the veteran revolutionaries,"
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"During the Long March, the Red Army was extremely in short of
materials to maintain even the simplest living conditions. But the
officers and the soldiers of the Red Army overcame the most
unimaginable hardship and difficulties, to realize their strategic
goals," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"What did the Red Army rely on to achieve all this? They
depended on the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party,
the great firm unity of the whole Party and the whole army, and
the great unity between the army and the people, and the Red
Army's determination to conquer all enemies, and all the
difficulties," he said.

ISTANBUL, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Galatasaray have asked FIFA to
authorise Romania midfielder Iulian Filipescu's transfer from
Steaua Bucharest despite the Romanian champions accusing the
Turks of illegally poaching the player.
</P>
<P>
Filipescu signed for Galatasaray last week and was presented
to local reporters and fans when he arrived in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
But Steaua claim the three million U.S. dollar deal is invalid
as their officials were excluded from the transfer negotiations.
Steaua have returned the first instalment of the fee -- 800,000
U.S. dollars -- and say they want Filipescu back.
</P>
<P>
But in a letter Galatasaray wrote to FIFA general secretary
Sepp Blatter on Monday, Galatasaray claim the deal is valid and
have asked FIFA to issue the player's international clearance
certificate releasing him to play for them.
</P>
<P>
Galatasaray say they met with Steaua executives twice during
the negotiations, and even offered extra money and to play a
friendly as part of the deal. They have also paid most of the
transfer fee for a second player, forward Adrian Ilie.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 22 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin today
praised the Long March as the unparalleled revolutionary
undertaking in Chinese history.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting in Beijing to mark the 60th anniversary of
the victorious Long March, Jiang said that the march will be
remembered as a permanent monument to the Chinese revolution.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended by nearly 6,000 people, including
veterans of the Red Army who participated in the Long March.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was sponsored by the Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) and the Central Military Commission.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the CPC Central Committee, the State Council and
the Central Military Commission, the leader extended heartfelt
greetings to proletarian revolutionaries of the older generation,
officers and soldiers of the Red Army who participated in the Long
March, and the people who did their utmost to assist the Red Army
during the Long March, and to veterans of the Red Army present at
today's meeting.
</P>
<P>
He said that 60 years ago, the three fronts of the Red Army
joined forces in Huining and Jiangtaibao, declaring the total
failure of attempts by Kuomintang reactionaries to wipe out the
CPC and the Red Army, and the successful accomplishment of the
strategic movement of the Red Army to resist Japanese invaders in
north China.

He said, "The Long March is an unparalleled historical
undertaking, created by the CPC and the Worker-Peasant Red Army
under CPC leadership, and a world-shaking heroic poem for the
Chinese nation."
</P>
<P>
He said that the Red Army, under the command of Late Chairman
Mao Zedong, marched 12,500 kilometers across ten provinces, by

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Worried By Worsening Situation in Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) today voiced strong concerns over
the worsening situation in eastern Zaire, which it said has forced
220,000 refugees out of camps in the Uvira region.
</P>
<P>
Due to continued fighting in the town of Uvira, more than
220,000 refugees from 12 camps in the region have fled the
camps. Most of them are hiding in surrounding hills and
countryside with little or no assistance, UNHCR spokesman Ron
Redmond told a news briefing here.
</P>
<P>
The situation there "has now deteriorated to such an extent
that we're almost back to an emergency phase like we faced in
1994," said Redmond.
</P>
<P>
About 54 relief workers there, including eight UNHCR staff,
were trapped their offices. The aid supply lines were cut off and
it was clear that humanitarian workers could no longer work, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Some of the refugees were moving northwards to the Bukavu area,
which already had about 3,000 Rwandan refugees who, the UNHCR
spokesman said, were prepared to go to the Nyengezi-Muluua camp,
</P>
<P>
Redmond noted that the UNHCR was preparing camps in Bukavu for
the possible arrival of up to 75,000 Rwandan refugees fleeing the
heavy fightings in Uvira.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR had so far received no reports of a spontaneous return
of refugees from Uvira to Rwanda or Burundi. Most of the 143,000
Burundi refugees in the Uvira region would stay on, he said.
</P>
<P>
In Goma, North Kivu, fighting occurred on Sunday in the three
camps of Kibymba, Kahindo and Katale, the spokesman said. He added
that one Zaire officer was killed and another wounded in the
attack on the UNHCR base camp in Katale.

<HEADLINE> New Air Links Between Afghanistan, Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban militia
today announced that direct commercial air links between
Afghanistan and Pakistan would start later this week, said reports
from Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Radio Shariat, the Taliban-run state broadcaster, said the
national carrier Ariana Afghan Airlines would start a twice-weekly
service to Pakistan's capital Islamabad later this week.
</P>
<P>
The announcement of the start of flights to Pakistan, the first
regular commercial service since 1994, came two days after
Pakistan agreed to provide a temporary operational maintenance
base for Ariana in the southern city of Karachi.
</P>
<P>
According to Pakistani sources, Ariana has been granted
permission to fly from Kabul to Punjab's provincial capital of
Lahore, with a stop in Islamabad twice a week.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the airline will be allowed to fly from the
southern Afghan city of Kandahar to the nearby Pakistani city of
Quetta, an official statement in Pakistan said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Ariana has a fleet of four Boeing 727 jets, one Soviet-built
Tupelov 154 jet and a small Yak-40 aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The airline only maintained one route to the Indian capital of
New Delhi before the Taliban took over Kabul.
</P>
<P>
However, the airline now is flying to the north Indian city of
Amritsar, the Gulf city of Dubai as well as several internal
routes.

<HEADLINE> Iran Stages Maneuvers near Iranian-Afghan Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Iranian army has started
extensive maneuvers in the Torbat-Jam area near border with
Afghanistan, a well-informed source said here today.
</P>
<P>
The source said that the armored, airborne, infantry and
mechanized divisions are taking part in the maneuvers
</P>
<P>
However, there is no detail information of the maneuvers. But
local analysts said that the maneuvers would send a strong signal
to the militant Taliban in Afghanistan. Iran wants to put both
political and military pressure upon the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
The analysts said that the war games are held in an area
inside Iranian territory which is only an hour's drive to Herat
city held by Taliban.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian military move shows that the Tehran government
would continue its support to the ousted Rabbani government.
</P>
<P>
Iran has repeatedly accused Pakistan of supporting the
militant Taliban students in the fight against the ousted
government headed by Buhanuddin Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
Iran maintains that the Taliban group has flourished as a
result of U.S. planning, Saudi financial support and Pakistan's
logistical backing.
</P>
<P>
Taliban religious fighters overran Kabul on September 27,
topping the government, and now control about two-thirds of the
country in their bid to impose a strict Islamic regime.
</P>
<P>
The seizure of the Kabul by the Taliban has strained the
relations between Tehran and Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
Zafar Helali, special envoy of Pakistani Prime Minister
Benazir Bhutto arrived here Monday carrying a message from Ms
Bhutto for President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani in a bid to iron
out difference on the Afghan issue.

<HEADLINE> Saudi King Calls on Private Sector to Hire More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 22 (Xinhua) -- King Fahd of Saudi Arabia
has called on Saudi private sectors to secure more job
opportunities for local laborers in an effort to achieve the set
national goal of boosting the number of Saudi nationals in the
kingdom's workforce.
</P>
<P>
King Fahd was addressing the weekly cabinet meeting Monday
night in Saudi western Red Sea coast city of Jeddah, Kuwait News
Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The king said that "Saudi Arabia will continue its efforts to
strengthen the capabilities of Saudi citizens by improving their
educational and training standards and offering them all job
opportunities."
</P>
<P>
His assertion came three days after the Saudi authorities
refused to renew residency licenses for 13 professions, including
guarding, reviewers, receptionists, administrators, as well as
insurance and customs clearing.
</P>
<P>
About 6.5 million expatriates work in Saudi Arabia which has a
population -- including the expatriates -- of about 19
million. Fewer than 7 percent of the private sector
employees are Saudis, eonomists in the kingdom say.
</P>
<P>
Recently, "Saudization" has become the buzz-word in the
kingdom.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports, close to 40 percent of Saudi
Arabia's oil revenue leaves the country in the form of
remittances every year. Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil
producer and exporter, has since the 1980s been running a current
account deficit in which remittances have played a major role,
economists were reported as saying.
</P>
<P>
Remittances totalled 15.3 billion U.S. dollars in 1994, and
estimated to stand at 14.5 billion dollars in 1995, compared with
an estimated oil revenue of 39 billion dollars in the same year.
</P>
<P>
It is projected that Saudi Arabia's deficit in 1995 was 5
billion to 6 billion dollars comparing with an official figure
of 9 billion dollars in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the Saudi government realises that unemployment of
Saudis would be fertile ground for social upheaval and is keen
to address the problem sooner than later, observers said.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi authorities worried that the more the foreign
workers in the country, the more crimes such as drug trafficking
and robbing would occur, and values contradicting to the Islamic
values in this Islamic country might bring about some social
problems.
</P>
<P>
According to recent governmental instructions, a one-year
grace period is to be granted for owners of 14 professions which
have to be occupied by Saudi citizens, including sales, warehouse
and collections representatives. This is the first of its kind to
be adopted by the government to limit the use of foreign labor and
pave the way for local manpower.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia's 1995-2000 five-year plan sets a target of
659,900 new jobs for Saudis by the end of this century. Some
319,500 expatriate workers would be replaced by Saudi citizens.
</P>
<P>
Private companies must increase the number of Saudi workers
on their staff by 5 percent a year or face sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Lack of commitment to "Saudization" will be denied government
loans.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Saudi Interior Minister Prince Nayef Bin
Abdel-Aziz earlier asserted in a statement that the issue of
Saudizing jobs in his country was "a firm strategy of Saudi
Arabia."
</P>
<P>
However, an expert said Saudi now faces a major problem. That
is, there are about 20 percent of positions in the public sector
which require highest qualifications and expertise which the
youngsters who are about to join the Saudi workforce may not be
qualified to fill. "We will still be in need of high qualification
and expertise for several years to come," he said.
</P>
<P>
Saudi citizens have for decades enjoyed their country's oil
wealth and favored well-paid, half-day managerial jobs in the
state sector, where the government always made room for them.
</P>
<P>
Unskilled and manual jobs have been left for Asian and
non-Saudi Arab workers, while private sector managerial jobs are
filled by Western and Arab expatriates.
</P>
<P>
For the purpose of making the Saudis to be qualified for
their future jobs, various training courses and programs have
been conducted in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The job-oriented courses include specialized ones as well as
vocational ones for store operating, personnel manager, product
planning, financial controller, accounting, executive secretary,
front desk manager, industrial safety and security and so on.
</P>
<P>
"Various training programs will be conducted for a long
period, and this is certainly a policy to be enforced and
reinforced," a Saudi official was reportedly saying.

towards the 21st century.

MOSCOW, October 22 (Xinhua) -- A Russian rescue group has found
a downed German World War II bomber with four bodies inside near
Moscow, the Itar-Tass reported today.
</P>
<P>
The news agency quoted the head of the group, Sergei Tsvetkov,

It was the third World War II German plane discovered by the
group near Moscow over the past month, Tsvetkov said.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Diplomat Denies Iran-Pakistan Differences on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Ambassador to
Pakistan Mehdi Akhundzadeh today denied that Pakistan and Iran
differed on the Afghan issue.
</P>
<P>
"Iran and Pakistan share a common perception on the Afghan
issue as they wish to see an early restoration of peace and
stability in Afghanistan," he told journalists at a reception
here.
</P>
<P>
He said both countries believed that the formation of a
broad-based government in Afghanistan was the only solution to the
lingering conflict.
</P>
<P>
Islamabad and Teheran are in constant touch on the Afghan
issue, he said, adding that Pakistan's special envoy Zafar Hilali
is currently in Iran to brief Iranian officials on the subject.
</P>
<P>
Expressing concern over the fighting in Afghanistan, he said
that "there is no Jehad (holy war) being waged now in Afghanistan,
it is now civil war."
</P>
<P>
He said recent developments in the war-ravaged country would
not help bring peace as "military confrontation is not a solution
to any problem."
</P>
<P>
"We must make Afghans realize that an unstable Afghanistan is
neither in the interest of the Afghan nation nor in the interest
of the region."
</P>
<P>
The Iranian ambassador said Teheran is trying to bring Afghan
factions to the negotiation table for the formation of a
broad-based government in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
He said Iran is to host a two-day regional conference on
October 29 and 30 to discuss the latest developments in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
He said the meeting would urge the Afghan factions to find a
negotiated settlement to their differences and give up the path of
confrontation.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Interior Minister Nasirullah Babar has just ended his
shuttling diplomatic efforts in Afghanistan, resulting in bringing
all warring factions to agree on a ceasefire.

<HEADLINE> Rybkin Proposes Amnesty for Chechen Separatists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Ivan Rybkin, the newly-appointed
secretary of the Russian Security Council, has proposed an amnesty
for all Chechen fighters, the council's press service said today.
</P>
<P>
A statement said the council, "upon the initiative" of Rybkin,
had drafted an "amnesty to participants of the armed conflicts in
the North Caucasus."
</P>
<P>
Conflicts in North Caucasus include not only the Chechen war
which has left tens of thousands people dead, but also the
Ossetian-Ingushi stand-off which no longer flares but remains
unresolved.
</P>
<P>
Under the Russian Constitution, the amnesty can be proclaimed
only by the State Duma, the lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
Rybkin's proposal was largely seen as a signal that he backs a
cease-fire negotiated by his predecessor Alexander Lebed in
August, and will be working towards a peaceful solution to the
Chechen problem.
</P>
<P>
According to the Itar-Tass news agency, Rybkin, who was named
secretary of the Security Council and the president's special
envoy in Chechnya on Saturday, was expected to meet Lebed later
this afternoon over the Chechen settlement.

<HEADLINE> Collectors on the Scent Of A Bargain Flock To Auction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Collectors hoping to sniff out
a bargain had the perfect chance at a curtain raiser auction in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The auction sale on Monday was a prelude to an international
convention which opened today in the Chinese capital -- on snuff
bottles.
</P>
<P>
And snuff bottles enjoyed their own category during the China
Guardian Autumn Auction, a pioneering sale in China one day before
the convention opened.
</P>
<P>
On offer were 160 porcelain, jade, agate, crystal and red
pottery snuff bottles, with half of them being sold for a total
auction price of 4.48 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The most expensive item was an imperial gilded porcelain snuff
bottle, which went for 520,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Wei Lijun, department manager at China Guardian Auctions
Company, says that the category was set not only to meet the needs
of increasing snuff bottle collectors, but also as a welcome to
the International Chinese Snuff Bottle Convention.
</P>
<P>
The convention, an annual meeting of the US-based International
Chinese Snuff Bottle Society, has attracted some 177 members from
15 countries and regions including the United States, Britain,
France, and Germany.
</P>
<P>
Most of the convention delegates attended the snuff bottle
auction Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
The society, established in 1969, has some 800 members from
more than 40 countries and regions, including 200 in China.
</P>
<P>
Snuff bottles were developed in China in the Eighteenth Century
when the practice of inhaling snuff spread from England to the
rest of the world. The decorative bottles have long been favored
by collectors from both home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Snuff bottles have been sent by Chinese leaders as presents to
foreign guests, including former US presidents Jimmy Carter and
Ronald Reagan.

<HEADLINE> Iran Sells Oil at Record High Price </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Iran, the second largest oil
exporter in the world, is selling heavy crude oil at a five-year
record high price of 23.75 U.S. dollars per barrel, a local press
said here today.
</P>
<P>
The Persian daily Salam quoted an Oil Ministry official as
saying that Iran's heavy crude oil was sold at a price ranging from
23.70 dollars to 23.75 dollars a barrel at the Suez Canal delivery
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official said that the Iranian heavy crude oil had
a jump of 15 cents between Friday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Iranian heavy crude oil delivered at the
Egyptian port city of Seid Karir, southeast of the Mediterranean
Sea, sold at 22.05 dollars per barrel early this month.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that the developments in the
Kurdish-occupied northern Iraq was one of the reasons for the hike
in the crude prices.
</P>
<P>
He also referred to the early arrival of cold weather in
Europe and the depletion of the stockpiled oil in some industrial
countries as some of other factors to push up the prices.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh said last week that
if the present trend in oil market continues, Iran would generate
an income of some 18 billion dollars, or some 2 billion dollars
more than the previous projection by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Iran is presently exporting 3.7 million barrels of oil per
day in line with the quota set by the OPEC.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Encourages Offshore Oil Industry to Contribute More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng
today urged the offshore oil sector to pump more oil and gas
to make even greater contributions to the country's energy
development.
</P>
<P>
The premier made the remark when meeting offshore oil model
workers and advanced groups at Zhongnanhai, the site of the
Chinese Communist Party Central Committee and the central
government in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
He said that tremendous achievements have been made in the
offshore oil industry, with hard efforts exerted in the past
decade.
</P>
<P>
China is this year expected to produce 14 million tons of
offshore crude oil, and three billion cubic meters of offshore
natural gas, thanks to the policy of reform and opening up
initiated in 1979, and to fruitful international cooperation, Li
said.
</P>
<P>
The premier spoke highly of the offshore oil workers and vowed
"we will resolutely rely on the working class, and run every
undertaking of the country even better."
</P>
<P>
China's offshore oil industry has been developing by leaps and
bounds since 1982. By the end of August this year, China's
offshore industry had signed more than 100 contracts and
agreements with 65 companies in 18 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
Among the 19 operational offshore oil and gas fields, six were
developed by China's own efforts.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng pointed out that greater efforts should be made to
expand oil and gas exploration and development, adding that the
prospects are bright for the development and production of
petrochemicals and oil products in the country.

cooperation in various fields.
</P>

rights issue, all countries should abide by the principle of
mutual respect, non-interference in each other's internal affairs,
engagement in non-confrontational and strengthening dialog, to
improve relations between developed and developing countries.

should be strengthened on human rights issues, holding that
dialog is conducive, and can help international cooperation
in human rights to progress.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Warns of Refugee Disaster in Eastern Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) today expressed deep concern over
the plight of Burundian and Rwandan refugees forced to flee their
camps in eastern Zaire in the face of intensified ethnic
fighting.
</P>
<P>
"I'm deeply worried by the widening scale of violence in
eastern Zaire in recent weeks that has once again sent tens of
thousands of refugees fleeing for their lives," UNHCR High
Commissioner Sadako Ogata said in a statement reaching here
today.
</P>
<P>
Ogata was also worried about the safety of humanitarian staff
who have been unable to carry out their work because of the
fighting between Zairean troops and the Rwandan Hutu rebels
residing in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
As of this morning, more than 50 international aid workers
were trapped in UNHCR's office in Zaire's eastern town of Uvira.
Over the last 24 hours, the staff reported that they could hear
sound of gunfire outside their office.
</P>
<P>
"The refugees and humanitarian workers are at the mercy of a
very unstable and dangerous security situation, and it is
impossible at this time to predict the outcome," said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
The high commissioner appealed to all the warring sides to
halt the violence immediately and "avoid another humanitarian
disaster in a region that has already suffered enough."
</P>
<P>
Zairean military authorities reported that all 12 camps in the
Uvira region have been abandoned because of the fighting. The
220,000 refugees from the camps -- 143,000 Burundians and 75,000
Rwandans -- are reported to be either hiding in the surrounding
hills or are heading toward Bukavu, about 75 kms north of Uvira.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR field officers have also observed hundreds of local
Zaireans moving towards Uvira town, fleeing the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Some 3,000 refugees have arrived in the Nyengezi-Mulwa camp in
the Bukavu region, said the UNHCR, which is preparing existing
camps in Bukavu to receive refugee arrivals from Uvira.
</P>
<P>
Zaire is hosting one million out of the 1.7 million Rwandan
refugees. The rest are in Tanzania and other east African
countries.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Senators Want US to Clean up Former Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Philippine senators today urged
the Department of Foreign Affairs to immediately work out
arrangements for the US government to clean up Clark, one of the
US former military bases in the country.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that the Environmental Protection Committee of the
US Pacific Air Force conducted a study on the environment of the
Clark Air Base before it vacated the military facility.
</P>
<P>
The study reportedly confirmed the presence of military wastes
such as cadmium, oil and grease which threaten the health and
safety of some 6,000 families in nearby areas.
</P>
<P>
"This is a serious charge. Clark's ground water which has
reportedly been contaminated with oil, grease and cadmium is being
used by 6,000 families in Pampanga (province)," said Senator
Orlando Mercado, chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment.
</P>
<P>
"The United States should clean up its former military bases
where hazardous toxic wastes were allegedly detected," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Senator Juan Flavier warned that the deadly wastes
in Clark were just like a "ticking time bomb" ready to explode. He
stressed that the Philippine government should ask the US to clean
up Clark immediately.
</P>
<P>
"The cleanup alone will cost millions of dollars considering
that we do not have the technology and expertise. More costly is
the environmental and ecological loss which our country will
suffer from," Flavier noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government should seek compensation from the
US government for the presence of toxic wastes in the former US
air base in central Luzon.

<P>
BEIJING, October 22 (Xinhua) -- A grand celebration was held
today in Beijing to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the
victory of the momentous Long March by the Chinese Red Army.
</P>
<P>
"Today we commemorate the great victory of the Red Army's Long
March, which means we will carry on the Long March spirit
generation after generation," Chinese President Jiang Zemin said
at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The spirit will inspire and encourage all Chinese people to
work hard, and march forward to strive for new victories along the
road of a new long march -- building socialism with Chinese
characteristics, said Jiang, who is also General Secretary of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of
the Central Military Commission.
</P>
<P>
Before three o'clock this afternoon, government and Party
leaders, Red Army veterans, workers, farmers, students, and
officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army,
flocked to the Great Hall of the People for the celebration.
</P>
<P>
Over the stage hung a large banner bearing the slogan: Inherit
and expand the glorious traditions of our Party and our army,
strive to realize the Ninth Five-year Plan and Long-term Target to
2010.
</P>
<P>
The meeting started promptly at three o'clock with the playing
of the Chinese national anthem. Young pioneers presented flowers
to the 100 Red Army veterans present.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the Red Army veterans, the PLA and young
people made speeches at the gathering.
</P>
<P>
At the suggestion of Jiang Zemin, all the people attending the
celebration stood in tribute and in memory of the revolutionary
martyrs who dedicated their lives along the Long March route and
revolutionary struggles in other places.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that the Long March was a miracle of the Red Army,
led by the Chinese Communist Party, and an earth-shaking heroic
epic of the Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
"The victory of Long March proclaimed solemnly before the world
that the Chinese Communist Party, and its people's army, which was
armed with Marxism and rooted deeply in all ethnic groups of
China, could not be defeated," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"The aim of commemorating the victory of the Red Army's Long
March is to cherish the memory of the glorious achievements of the
Red Army, and to draw on the historical experience of the Long
March to carry forward the revolutionary spirit of the Long March,
to push forward the great undertakings initiated by old
revolutionaries," he said.
</P>
<P>

Jintao, together with 6,000 other people, participated in the
rally.

<HEADLINE> More Wool Expected to Be for Sale in Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The total volume of wool
available in the Australian wool selling system this year is
expected to exceed 50 million kilograms (MKGs), a wool specialist
said today.
</P>
<P>
Australia's shorn wool production has been forecast to be
around 641 MKGs in 1996-97, according to Michael Chaney, managing
director of the Wesfarmers Dalgety Ltd, one of the leading wool
companies in the country.
</P>
<P>
"Production volumes are forecast to rise gradually in
subsequent years as improved seasonal conditions lead to higher
cuts per head and better prices result in flock re-building,"
Chaney said.
</P>
<P>
In response to falling wool prices in 1995-96, many growers
withheld wool from sale, storing it in brokers' stores or on
farms.
</P>
<P>
"A survey conducted by Wesfarmers Dalgety in April last
indicated that around half of all growers were holding some wool,"
said Chaney.
</P>
<P>
"The flow of this stored wool to sale will have a major impact
on the market over the next few years and a rapid sell-off by
growers would have a dampening effect on prices," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chaney estimated that about 407 MKGs of wool remained unsold on
the Wool International stockpile at the end of June 1996, while in
1997, the total volume of wool potentially available in the
selling system would be the combination of production, grower
stocks and Wool International stockpile sales.
</P>
<P>
"In 1996-97, this is forecast to be approximately 880 MKGs
compared with 827 MKGs in 1995-96, compared with supply, total
demand for wool has been relatively constant," he said.

<TEXT>

<P>
LONDON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- One or two tigers are killed
everyday in India, according to a report published here today.
</P>
<P>
"The Indian government has killed on as the tiger population
has plummeted. The situation is desperate and the Indian
government must act now," said Allan Thornton, chairman of the
Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA).
</P>
<P>
The report is the result of a year's research throughout India
by EIA investigators.
</P>
<P>
Entitled "The Political Wilderness - India's Tiger Crisis",
the report slammed the Indian government for ignoring protection
measures and for sanctioning industrial encroachment on the tiger
habitat.
</P>
<P>
The world's tiger population had declined from an estimated
80,000 in 1900 to 5,000 to 7,000 today, and about 2,500 of them
were in India, it said.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Protests Against Heavy Security During </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 22 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques
Chirac today protested against heavy security measures imposed on
him by Israel during his two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
During his tour of the Old City of Jerusalem this morning,
Chirac had to use his elbow to make his way through the security
cordon.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in English to the security head, Chirac charged: "This
is provocation. Stop this now. Do you want me to go back to my
plane and go home to France? "
</P>
<P>
This extraordinary diplomatic incident took place during
Chirac's second-day visit in Israel.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to show French support for Palestinian claim to
East Jerusalem, French officials asked Israel not to send
officials to accompany Chirac's tour of the Old City. The French
officials also asked Israel to allow their own security people,
and not Israeli policemen, to provide security for the tour.
</P>
<P>
However, Jerusalem police spokesman Shmuel Ben-Ruby said that
Israeli police would provide security throughout Chirac's Old
City visit.
</P>
<P>
Chirac is scheduled to hold talks with Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu here this afternoon and the two men will hold
a joint press conference afterwards.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Biggest Hindu Festival in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Goddess Durga, looking bright and
brave in a giant portrait, is smiling to thousands of devotees at
the Kumudini Temple near Dhaka for this year's Durga Puja, the
biggest religious festival of the Hindu community in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
According to the Hindu mythology, Durga rescued the gods and
goddesses who were driven out of the heaven by the devil
Mahishasur. She vanquished the evil forces and re-established
peace in the heaven.
</P>
<P>
Enthusiastic Hindus all over Bangladesh have been celebrating
the Durga Puja since last Friday with devotional songs, dances and
speeches.
</P>
<P>
The 10-day festival will culminate in the immersion of a Durga
idol in a river in the last three days.
</P>
<P>
The 46-year-old Kumudini Temple, also one of the largest
private hospitals in Bangladesh, is a well-known gathering place
in the Hindu-concentrated Tangail district, less than 100
kilometers northwest of Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
"It is a temple of our Hindus. We celebrate the Durga Puja
here every year," G. Banik, a Puja organizer at the temple, told
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"I composed that song," he pointed to the stage where
dressed-up girls were singing a devotional song to a large
audience of local Hindus and foreign visitors.
</P>
<P>
More and larger celebrations are being held elsewhere in
Bangladesh, such as the Dhakeswari Temple in Dhaka. Over 110 Puja
pavilions have been erected in the Dhaka Metropolis this year,
while philanthropic functions are held during the festival.
</P>
<P>
President Shahabuddin Ahmed, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and
some cabinet ministers have visited several Puja pavilions and met
with members of the Hindu community.
</P>
<P>
Hasina, who is of the Muslim origin, assured the nation that
her government believes in non-communal politics.
</P>
<P>
"You all have equal rights to practice your respective
religions with due dignity and honor and there will be none to
interfere in it," she said.
</P>
<P>
The constitutional principles provide for religious freedom and
tolerance in Bangladesh, a country with a population of about 120
million.
Muslims are the largest community in Bangladesh with 86.6 percent
of the population, while Hindus account for 12.1 percent,
Buddhists 0.6 percent, Christians 0.4 percent and others 0.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
"Being the second largest religious community, we Hindus,
generally speaking, are living here in harmony with others," said
a Hindu editor of a local daily.
</P>
<P>
Hasina's ruling party, with memories still fresh of its victory
over the rival party in the elections some four months ago,
attaches special importance to the festival this year by
portraying Goddess Durga as a symbol of triumph over injustice,
oppression and tyranny.
</P>
<P>
"My government is pledge-bound to ensure safety and security of
the people and urge all to extend their all-out cooperation
towards making the country a dignified one in the world arena
through continued progress and prosperity," she told hundreds of
applauding Hindus at a gathering here.

<HEADLINE> China's Development Zones Continue In Importance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 22 (Xinhua) -- China will have an industrial
output value of 120 billion yuan in its 32 state development zones
by the turn of the century, according to a State Council official.
</P>
<P>
Export volume of the zones will be more than 10 billion US
dollars by then, Ge Hongsheng, deputy director of the State
Council's Special Economic Zones Office, said at the opening

billion US dollars in foreign investment and bringing in 6.46
billion US dollars from exports.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Australia To Produce 170 Million Tons of Iron Ore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Australia's iron ore
production could rise at least 20 percent by the year 2000 to 170
million tons, North Ltd. Managing Director Campbell Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
More than three quarters of this amount was expected to be
shipped to Asia, Anderson told the Australia-Japan Business
Cooperation Committee in Sydney today.
</P>
<P>
"With these trends set to continue, it will be necessary for
Australian iron ore suppliers to expand existing operations and to
develop new mines, and major refurbishment and infrastructure
support will also be required," he said.
</P>
<P>
Modest growth in worldwide steel production of one to two
percent each year was expected to stimulate a rise in annual
global iron ore production of about 25 percent during the next ten
years.
</P>
<P>
While in the past decades Japan has remained Australia's
premier market for iron ore, Australia's shipment of iron ore
products to Japan is worth more than one billion US dollars,
representing close to half of Australia's total iron ore exports.
</P>
<P>
But with the emergence of newly industrializing economies in
the region, Australia would have more opportunities for iron ore
exports.

<HEADLINE> US Mediator Stays Despite Early Announcement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Middle East peace
coordinator today remained here despite his Monday's announcement
that he was returning to the U.S. as the Israeli-Palestinian
talks on Hebron went into a deadlock.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported today that Ross held a telephone
conversation with Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu this morning,
which probably led to the change of his decision.
</P>
<P>
The report also added that Ross held separate talks with the
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators this morning, after the
Palestinian delegation walked out of the negotiations Monday
night to protest against the attitude of the Israeli delegates.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear at this movement whether Ross was just
delaying his departure, or actually has chosen to stay until a
deal on the Hebron redeployment is concluded.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Ross had announced that he was returning to the
U.S., as a Hebron redeployment deal still needed to be worked out
between Israel and Palestine.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in Jerusalem, Ross told reporters that he
is returning to Washington, and that he will be consulting with
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher.
</P>
<P>
Ross informed Netanyahu of his decision during earlier
consultations, which were also attended by Foreign Minister
David Levy, Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and U.S. Ambassador
Martin Indyk.
</P>
<P>
Ross, who has played a key role in the Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations over the past two weeks, said that he will be ready
to return to the Middle East "when his services are needed."
</P>
<P>
Ross said that there were still delicate issues to be
negotiated between Israel and Palestine, adding that "more
progress was made in the security area than in the civilian
matters."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that there will be a continued active U.S. role in
the negotiations between Israel and Palestine, adding the two
sides will enter negotiations on technical matters in a week's
time.
</P>
<P>
"I expected to return when I think time is right and proper,"
the U.S. envoy said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hassan Asfour, one of the chief Palestinian
negotiators, told Palestinian Radio that Ross was returning to
the U.S. for consultations, and that he will be back in the
region "only in a week."
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio revealed Monday morning that Ross was weighing
the possibility of leaving the region if a Hebron redeployment
deal is not worked out by the end of this week.
</P>
<P>
The report pointed out that Ross's decision may provide the
impetus to wrap up the talks, but it also could be interpreted
publicly as a sign of failure, and even trigger further
violence.
</P>
<P>
Assuming it could take 10 days to actually implement a Hebron
redeployment, the accord would have to be concluded this week
for implementation to occur before the U.S. elections on November
5.
</P>
<P>
As Ross remains here for the time being, there is still a
possibility that Israel and Palestine would reach an
agreement in time.

HARARE, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government is
planning to commercialise its agricultural services as part of
the measure to cut government spending, Agriculture Minister
Denis Morman said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
These would include soil testing, fertilizer analysis, meat
inspection and grading, disease diagnostic services and
veterinary research which were previously done by institutes
under the Agricultural Ministry, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
Norman said farmers would be required to pay for most of these
services which were currently being provided free of charge.
</P>
<P>
"All these services have been given to the farmers free of
charge and now they would have to pay for them," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
In response, Deputy Director of Zimbabwean Farmers Union,
Emmerson Zhou, said the government's cost-recovery measures
requires a careful analysis so as to guarantee some poor
farmers's access to the know-hows.
</P>
<P>
"The government's agricultural services play a pivotal role in
providing the farmers with economically viable, technically and
environmentally sound advices. But unfortunately, more than 70
percent of the rural population could not afford them," said
Zhou.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Protests Israel over Behavior of Security Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 22 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
today lodged a strong protest to Israel against the rude behavior
of Israeli security forces toward him during his visit in the old
town of Jerusalem, and threatened to cut short his visit to Israel.
</P>
<P>
French presidential spokeswoman Catherine Colonna said that the
president protested "against the behavior of the Israeli security
forces who caused an unacceptable agitation and blocked the
journalists from working."
</P>
<P>
"We are conveying the message now to the Israelis and the
president will say it himself to Benjamin Netanyahu," said the
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
Chirac, who has asked Israel to let him walk around in the old
town of East Jerusalem without police escort, said that the heavy
deployment of "occupation forces" by Israel is a "deliberate
provocation."
</P>
<P>
Israeli troops deliberately tried to block the president from
walking around freely to meet the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Closely followed by the troops armed with assault weapons and
wearing combat uniforms, Chirac finally made his way to the
Esplanade of Mosque Al Aqsa, where he hugged some Palestinian
officials who came to receive him, according to local media
reports.
</P>
<P>
Several scuffles took place between Israeli troops and the
entourage of the president and French journalists before Chirac
went to the Church of the Saint Sepulchre, where he was greeted by
the leaders of the Christian community in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Israeli troops stayed outside the church, the holiest of the
Christian religion in the world, when Chirac was visiting the tomb
of Jesus Christ.
</P>
<P>
"This is a provocation. It should stop," said Chirac in English
to the Israeli police around him after they tried to prevent him
from moving freely to some Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"What do you want? Do you want me to go back to my plane?" said
the president while making angry gestures and with his face being
red to the neck.
</P>
<P>
The president then told the journalists that the action by the
Israeli police is "deliberate".
</P>
<P>
"I have protested. I have even threatened to go back to my
plane. But this would have no effect," said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
"This is an unacceptable situation. This is an attitude which
explains everything clear," he added.
</P>
<P>
A Palestinian official accompanying the president said that
Chirac today experienced what all Palestinians are experiencing
everyday.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Appoints Misuari as SPCPD Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today named Governor Nur Misuari of the Autonomous Region in
Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) as chairman of the Southern Philippines
Council for Peace and Development (SPCPD) in concurrent capacity.
</P>
<P>
The president announced the appointment of Misuari at the
Palawan provincial capital in the southern Philippines before
presiding over the regional cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
The naming of Misuari as SCPCD chairman has long been expected
following his election as ARMM governor on September 9. But many
Congressmen said it was "unconstitutional" for Misuari to wear two
hats of power and President Ramos had no right to appoint him as
head of both the ARMM and the SPCPD.
</P>
<P>
Misuari's designation was issued two days after Ramos'
executive order creating the SPCPD and a special zone of peace and
development in the southern Philippines (ZOPAD) took effect.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the SPCPD and the ZOPAD were two major
points of the final peace agreement signed last month by the
government and the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) headed by
Misuari.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Misuari said he will do his best as both SPCPD
chairman and ARMM governor and will call an immediate meeting with
his ARMM officials to discuss the peace and development programs
in the 14 provinces and nine cities in Mindanao covered by the
SPCPD.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Promote Domestic Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia today pledged to
intensify efforts to promote domestic tourism along with moves to
woo foreign tourists to help reduce the outflow of foreign
exchange.
</P>
<P>
Culture, Arts and Tourism Minister Sabbaruddin Chik said today
efforts to promote domestic tourism would be intensified to boost
the local tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
The local tourism industry will continue to expand and become
the most important mechanism for foreign exchange earnings,
Sabbaruddin told reporters after launching the national
information terminal interactive kiosk in Petaling Jaya adjacent
to the capital city.
</P>
<P>
Expressing satisfaction with the growth of domestic tourism, he
said domestic tourism had greatly helped boost the local tourism
industry.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the number of hotel stay by domestic tourists was
7.1 million compared with 6.9 million for foreign visitors,
according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's foreign exchange earnings from the tourism industry
last year exceeded the projection for the year 2000 and made it
the top contributor in reducing the national trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
There were 7.46 million tourist arrivals in 1995, a 3.8 percent
increase from the previous year, with the income generated
reaching 9.9 billion ringgit (3.96 billion US dollars) against the
projected tourism revenue of 8.5 billion ringgit (about 3.4
billion dollars) for the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Iran Launches Nationwide Census </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Iran started a 25-day national
census today with some 25,000 statisticians involving in the event.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Tehran Radio said that the experts began
counting the country's population by going one home after another
in the various regions.
</P>
<P>
The radio said that they are making registrations and notes,
including the number of each family, age, sex distribution,
income, educational standard, ownership of property.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the national census, Iran's Supreme Leader Ali
Khamenei Monday called on the people of the whole nation to take
an active part in the national census.
</P>
<P>
Iranian population authorities have already sounded the alarm
for a danger of population explosion as 25 million youngsters
under 17 are approaching the age of marriage.
</P>
<P>
Iran's population stands now at 65 million at present.
</P>
<P>
Experts say 25 million youngsters mean 12.5 million couples in
the future. If each couple have two children, still they will add
25 million to the population.
</P>
<P>
The past decade witnessed a fast growth of population which
has been doubled from 34 million in 1976 to the present 65 million.
</P>
<P>
The population growth has posed a grave threat to the
development of the national economy and other social development.
</P>
<P>
Specialists warned that the population would be doubled again
in 20 or 25 years, thus naturally aggravating the conditions and
pressure upon the decision-makers.
</P>
<P>
Population is a major parameter in planning and designing
economic and industrial programs. Iran conducts public census on
population and housing every 10 years.
</P>
<P>
However, Iran's statistics system faces many deficiencies,
lacking the required high capability. Consequently, the data
needed for economic planning are not adequately presented or
are outdated with a high error incidence.
</P>
<P>
These problems in turn disrupt the country's economic and
industrial system.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets German Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 22 (Xinhua) -- In a meeting with German
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel in Zhongnanhai, residence of China's
central government, President Jiang Zemin said that China and
Germany should view their bilateral relations from a long-term and
strategic perspective.
</P>
<P>
"As long as the two sides earnestly abide by the principles of
mutual respect, seeking a common ground while putting aside
differences, non-interference in each other's internal affairs,
and equality and mutual benefits, there will be good prospects for
relations between the two countries," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang welcomed the minister to China, noting that the
minister's main task here is to make preparations for the German
president's visit. "President Roman Herzog's visit to China is an
important event in bilateral relations," he said, adding that he
is looking forward to meeting with him.
</P>
<P>
Jiang asked the minister to convey his regards to President
Herzog, while Kinkel conveyed the German president's regards to
Jiang, saying that Herzog is very happy to have the chance to
visit China.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese and German people have made outstanding
contributions to civilization and to the progress of mankind,
Jiang said, emphasizing that, in spite of differences in
developmental stages and social systems, the two countries share
many interests.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese and German economies are strongly supplementary and
Germany is one of China's main partners in Europe in terms of
trade and the economy. Maintaining long-term friendly relations
between the two countries suits the fundamental interests of the
two peoples in the long run and will benefit global peace and
stability, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel said that China is a great country and it is important
for China and Germany to maintain good relations. This is in line
with the two peoples' interests, he said, adding that he hopes
that there will be more co-operation between the two countries in
economic cooperation, in trade and in environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Germany will in no way intervene in China's internal affairs
and will stick to the "one China" stand on the Taiwan and Tibet
issues, Kinkel said.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Only Brokering Ceasefire in Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Interior Minister
Nasirullah Babar today said Pakistan is only trying to broker
ceasefire in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
He believes that it is up to the Afghan people themselves to
seek a permanent solution to the lingering crisis plaguing their
country.
</P>
<P>
"We are currently trying to broker ceasefire in Afghanistan and
then leave it to the Afghan groups to decide about the meeting to
hammer out a solution," he told a press conference here.
</P>
<P>
He said the Pakistani delegation led by him visited various
Afghan cities and held a series of talks with the Taliban
leadership and northern warlord Rashid Dostum in the past few
days.
</P>
<P>
The delegation has drafted a ceasefire agreement covering the
entire war-ravaged country and both warring sides have in
principle agreed to it.
</P>
<P>
He said the Taliban leadership has no reservation on the
proposed agreement which calls for immediate cessation of
hostilities followed by formation of a commission to oversee the
truce and exchange of prisoners of war and dead bodies.
</P>
<P>
Babar said the agreement was ready for signature Monday when
the ousted government, which has become part of the three-party
alliance led by Dostum, called for the demilitarization of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
However, the draft agreement only calls for ceasefire and
addresses the humanitarian issues and all other matters would be
taken up later.
</P>
<P>
He said the proposed agreement was now being discussed by the
three-party alliance which groups Dostum, former government
military commander Ahmad Shah Masood and Hizb-e-Wahdat led by
Karim Khalili.
</P>
<P>
"We will facilitate the signing of the accord whenever the
northern alliance shows readiness," he said.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question, he said the opposition alliance has
already given six names for the commission to be formed to monitor
the ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban militia, he said, have approved the nominations.
</P>
<P>
Drawing parallel between the proposed agreement and the earlier
accords brokered by Islamabad between the Afghan factions, the
interior minister said his efforts were aimed at only securing a
ceasefire in Afghanistan and has nothing to do with the formation
of government there.
</P>
<P>
"Let Afghans themselves decide about the future government," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said it was up to the Afghan groups to select the venue of
any future meeting to seek a permanent solution to the Afghan
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Replying to a question, he said Dostum had called for the
participation of other Afghan groups and the people living abroad
and, "Taliban have expressed no reservation on it."
</P>
<P>
He ruled out disintegration of Afghanistan in the wake of
recent developments, saying that all afghan factions are committed
to the territorial integrity and solidarity of their country.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question, he said the United Nations has been
supportive of Islamabad's efforts.
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to take place of anybody and that's why the
proposed ceasefire monitoring commission will work under the aegis
of the United Nations and OIC (Organization of Islamic
Conference)," he added.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Tourism As a Way Out of Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHANGJIAJIE (Hunan Province), October 22 (Xinhua) -- At an
on-going national meeting on tourism and poverty in Hunan
Province, Sun Gang, deputy director of China's National Tourism
Administration, urged departments at various levels to improve
their planning in work policies for helping the poor.
</P>
<P>
The central government has suggested that tourism be used as a
means of wiping out poverty and that poverty-stricken areas be
helped to explore the tourism market.
</P>
<P>
The Tourism Administration will provide 750,000 yuan (90,000
U.S. dollars) for five courses to train tourism directors from
economically-backward areas through next year.
</P>
<P>
An official with the State Council also called on
under-developed areas to use their situation for projects that
appeal to tourists and provide work opportunities and help the
development of local economy.
</P>
<P>
China has 65 million people in rural areas living below the
poverty line, meaning annual per capita net income of 530 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government's goal is to wipe out poverty by the
turn of the century. The country will have to help 10 million poor
people get rid of the poverty each year for the next four years.
</P>
<P>
Starting next year, the central government will add 1.5 billion
yuan in allocated funds and three billion yuan in credit annually
to provide a total of 15.3 billion yuan a year for helping the
poor.
</P>
<P>
Most of poor people live in the central and western regions,
and mountainous areas in the east. Many of these areas have
unusual landscapes and human and cultural resources that have
potential for tourism.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated tourism has already helped three million poor
people become better off. Participants at the meeting were told of
the success of scenic spots such as Zhangjiajie in Hunan,
Huangshan in Anhui, and Xishuangbanna in Yunnan in using tourism
as a means of helping the poor.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's tobacco sales netted
over 580 million U.S. dollars for this season with the average
price doubled compared with that of last year.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's Tobacco Trade Association President Jim Van Heerden
said here last night that the tobacco season which closed on
October 4 realised sales of 201.6 million kilograms of flue-cured
Virginia tobacco at the price of 2.9 U.S. Dollars per kg.
</P>
<P>
According to Heerden, the market was characterised by firm
prices throughout the season, reflecting a buoyant global demand.
</P>
<P>
And production drops in Brazil and the United States, the two
major competitors in the international market, gave further
impetus to Zimbabwean manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Heerden forecasted that the 1997 season might see a similar
market with that of this season.

<HEADLINE> China's Legal System for Patent Protection Taking Shape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, October 22 (Xinhua) -- China's Patent Law, which took
effect in April 1985 and was revised in 1992, is said by some
experts to conform both to international standards and China's own
particular conditions.
</P>
<P>
The country has a system of law and law-enforcement that
protects patents well, according to Gao Lulin, director of the
Patent Office, who made the remarks at a recent international
seminar on intellectual property rights in Hangzhou, capital of
Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
In comparison to other countries, China has a system of
administrative settlement in addition to court rulings in handling
patent disputes.
</P>
<P>
The Patent Law authorizes administrative offices to penalize
those engaged in fraudulent activities.
</P>
<P>
Administrative settlement is quite simple, economic, and
efficient, and, as a result, welcomed by those who use it, Gao
said. More than 3,500 patent disputes have been handled and 90
percent of them have been settled by administrative offices.
</P>
<P>
"If the litigant is not happy with the administrative ruling,
he can appeal through the courts for a further ruling within a
certain amount of time," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the past several years, courts in some major cities have set
up special tribunals to deal with intellectual property rights,
and by the end of last year, had handled nearly 4,000 patent
cases, settling more than 70 percent of them. Last year alone,
they handled 952 cases.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China issued a customs regulation on protection of
intellectual property rights in July 1995, which is used for
examining counterfeit trademarks and products, and pirated
products.
</P>
<P>
This year, China's Customs discovered 1,202 violations of
intellectual property rights.
</P>
<P>
China, with a population of 1.2 billion, is making an effort to
make the public more aware of the need to protect intellectual
property rights, Gao noted.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Marine exploitation is
essential to the future development of northeast China's Liaoning
Province, according to Ding Dewen, director of the State Institute
of Environmental Protection of Oceans.
</P>
<P>
Ding, also academician at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, made
the remark in a recent report entitled "The Ocean and Social
Development of Liaoning." The province is an important heavy
industry base in China.
</P>
<P>
After researching the province's marine resources for many
years, Ding has drawn the conclusion that Liaoning is capable of
developing an enormous and lucrative marine industry group, helped
by its 2,920 kilometers of coastline, and 68,000 square kilometers
of marine territory.
</P>
<P>
Ding pointed out that although the province has 6.4 million ha
of offshore water area, only one-tenth has been effectively
utilized.
</P>
<P>
The director added that the province has over 80 kinds of
profitable marine living beings, and enormous reserves of oil and
natural gas, the dominant part just waiting to be exploited.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Chinese Bridge Repaired </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, October 22 (Xinhua) -- A nearly seven-million-yuan
restoration project at the Luoyang Bridge, using the original
design of some 900 years ago, was completed recently in east
China's Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
Part of the construction materials and ornaments for the bridge
were originals from the Song Dynasty (960-1279). Luo Zhewen, an
expert on ancient architecture, said that the three-year project
is a model for ancient bridge conservation.
</P>
<P>
The Luoyang Bridge, which had been cited by late bridge expert
Mao Yisheng as one of China's most famous ancient bridges, is
situated at the mouth of the Luoyang River in Fujian province's
Quanzhou city. With its construction begun in 1053, the bridge
also represented the world's first attempt at building a bridge on
a soft mud base.
</P>
<P>
The engineers of that time developed a pioneering method of
laying a stone base in the mud to serve as piers. They were laid
in the shape of a boat as a means of reducing the effects of the
running water.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the bridge was damaged seriously in wartime
earlier in this century, and was on the verge of collapse in 1993
when the recent conservation started.
</P>
<P>
The restored bridge is 731 m long, 4.5 m wide, with 45
boat-like piers.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese President Leaves for Damascus for Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Elias Hrawi
left here this morning for Damascus for a meeting with his Syrian
counterpart Hafez al-Assad, well-informed sources in the Beirut
presidential palace announced.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the two presidents will discuss "domestic
files in Lebanon," especially the formation of a new government
after the last government's mandate ended last Tuesday, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The talks will also deal with the situations in the region, in
light of a visit to the Syrian capital by French President Jacques
Chirac at the weekend on the first leg of his tour in the region,
according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
Hrawi's visit to Damascus coincides with the opening session of
Lebanon's new parliament today in which the 128-seat house will
elect its speaker, and consultations to choose a new prime
minister will begin after the house speaker is elected.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Hrawi asked the government of Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri to carry on official function until the formation of a new
government.
</P>
<P>
Hrawi, who has the constitutional right to name the prime
minister, will hear the views of each of the 128 parliamentary
deputies and will name the majority choice to head the new
government, reliable official sources said.
</P>
<P>
They expected that the next government will be formed after
the scheduled visit by Chirac to Beirut on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Hariri, a Moslem Sunni, and former parliament speaker Nabih
Berri, a Moslem Shiite, scored victories in the Lebanese general
elections in August and September.
</P>
<P>
Both of them won seats in the parliament and became heads of
the two biggest blocs in the unicameral house.
</P>
<P>
The victories have made them the most favored candidates
respectively for the next premier and house speaker.
</P>
<P>
According to the country's constitution, the house speaker
should be a Moslem Shiite, the prime minister a Moslem Sunni
while the president a Maronite Catholic.

</P>
<P>

only wanted to be "a carrier of the message of friendship, hope,
and confidence in future and peace."
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday, the U.S. Middle East envoy Dannis Ross flew
back to Washington without gaining any result from the two-week
negotiations between Israel and Palestinians. The Palestinian

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Meets Colombian President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng met in Beijing
today with Colombian President Ernesto Samper Pizano for a
discussion of bilateral and international issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Li expressed his pleasure at meeting with Samper in Beijing,
and recalled their meeting in Copenhagen in March of last year.
</P>
<P>
Calling the talks between the Chinese and Colombian presidents
yesterday "successful", Li said he believes that Samper's visit
will push the development of Sino-Colombian friendship and
co-operation forward.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that China and Colombia are two developing countries
that share many points, and that China believes that all
countries, big or small, should have the right to independently
choose their own path to development in accordance with their own
conditions.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that countries should respect each other and
should not interfere in each other's internal affairs, or engage
in hegemonism and power politics.
</P>
<P>
China firmly opposes actions by some western countries that
interfere in the internal affairs of developing countries, no
matter what the excuse, including human rights, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that Samper's and the Colombian government's position
on safeguarding sovereignty and national esteem in the face of
external pressures has a wide-range of sympathy and support among
other countries.
</P>
<P>
China appreciates the contributions made by Colombia, as the
current chair of the Non-Aligned Movement, in defending the
principles of the movement, as well as the rights and interests of
developing countries, said Li.
</P>
<P>
Samper said he is glad to have the opportunity to visit China,
and that this visit has allowed him to witness a more open and
vigorous China.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that although the time is limited, his visit has
achieved many things, and both sides have reached a consensus on
many issues in politics and economics.
</P>
<P>
Samper said that his country holds that every country has the
right to decide its own fate without any interference, citing
Colombia as an example of a victim of hegemonism and power
politics.
</P>
<P>
On this point, Colombia and China take the same stance, Samper
noted, saying that Colombia, as the current chair of NAM, has been
making efforts to safeguard the interests of developing countries,
and his country appreciates China's understanding and support for
the movement.

invest in the Simingshan Mountain Area, an old Chinese

congratulated him on the signing of a letter of intent between BP
and the Shanghai Petrochemical Corporation Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said he hopes that BP and other overseas petroleum
companies can explore more ways of co-operation with their Chinese
counterparts on the basis of equality and mutual benefits.
</P>
<P>
Petro-chemical industry is one of China's pillar industries,
Jiang said, adding China's economic growth has provided favorable
conditions for developing the industry.

have deeply impressed him, and that the latest letter of intent

<HEADLINE> Quality of Family Life in China Improved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nanjing, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese ethics and moral
standards have changed greatly, according to a recent survey
conducted by the Women's Federation in Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
Democratic concepts have taken root among Chinese
families. More of them are handling their affairs through family
consultation instead of relying on only one member to decide, with
58.6 percent of the surveyed families saying that they use this
method to decide budgets, and 49.58 percent doing housework
together.
</P>
<P>
Parents are losing the notion of their children as property,
and more of them assume the role of friend when dealing with their
children. When selecting a university or a spouse, the wishes of
sons and daughters are more respected by the parents.
</P>
<P>
In cities, most women are choosing to delay marriage and have
children later, and in rural areas, more families are deciding to
have one child.
</P>
<P>
When choosing a spouse, people increasingly pay attention to
moral character and abilities of a person: more than 80 percent of
300 people surveyed put personal quality in first place when
selecting a spouse.
</P>
<P>
Privacy is being respected more, and neighbors quarrel less,
while divorce is no longer regarded as something shameful.
</P>
<P>
The divorce rate of those initiated by the wife is climbing, as
is the rate of divorce reached by mutual agreement, and even
re-marriage among older people is now being accepted by society.
</P>
<P>
The concept of equality is widely accepted by Chinese families.
</P>
<P>
Some other figures: Husbands and wives do household chores
together in 70.5 percent of the families surveyed; 86.68 percent
of families in a survey of 47 villages in Suzhou, in east China's
Jiangsu Province, say they never use force in family conflicts;
58.3 percent of the women surveyed think that they have high
status in the family; and more than 80 percent of the women feel
harmonious in the routine of their lives and in their sexual
lives.

Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP).
</P>
<P>
U.S. envoy Pelletreau met with KDP leader Massoud Barzani
Monday in the Turkish border town of Silopi, Sirnak province,
which borders northern Iraq, in a bid to work out a solution to
the prolonged bitter clashes between the two Kurdish groups.
</P>
<P>
Pelletreau said that he had stressed to the Kurdish leader
the importance of seeing that neither Iraq nor Iran interfered
with the inter-Kurdish fighting in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. envoy met with KDP and PUK officials last week in
Washington in an attempt to bring a truce between the two sides
and to convince the KDP to cut its ties with the Iraqi
government.
</P>
<P>
Barzani threatened last week to call for help from Baghdad
again if things developed to the KDP's detriment on the
battlefield.
</P>
<P>
The KDP captured a series a major towns in northern Iraq in a
Baghdad-backed operation last month, forcing the U.S. to
evacuate many of its security and intelligence workers from the
region.
</P>
<P>
In a recent offensive, the PUK recaptured much of its lost
ground, including Sulaimaniya, one of the biggest cities in
northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Northern Iraq has been split into rival zones since the KDP
and the PUK began fighting in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Thai Overseas Borrowing Set at 4.1 Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will make efforts to
obtain loans worth 4.1 billion US dollars from overseas sources
during the fiscal year 1997 starting on October 1, the local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The loans will be tapped in the dollar and yen only for the
projects under the eighth national economic and social development
plan or those that will be beneficial to the country.
</P>
<P>
Interest rates on foreign loans are usually lower than those on
domestic loans and state enterprises with good credit will be
encouraged to borrow more from overseas to avoid pushing high the
domestic rates, Thai caretaker Finance Minister Chaiyawat
Wibulswasdi said.
</P>
<P>
So far, the public sector in Thailand has built up foreign
debts worth 15.4 billion dollars, including 50 million dollars in
short-term debts.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Thailand's debt servicing ratio stands at 2.3
percent of its gross domestic product.

<HEADLINE> Government Intact Despite Successful Vote of No </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Israeli opposition parties
scored a hollow victory in the Knesset (Israel's parliament)
Monday, when a majority voted no-confidence in the government
over the state of the economy, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
However, the opposition failed to muster enough votes to
topple the government, because under the new Basic Law, the
government can only be ousted by a vote of at least 61 out of the
120 members of the Knesset (MK).
</P>
<P>
A motion filed by the opposition parties, Labor, Hadash, and
Meretz, passed 45-43 with two abstentions.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who only came into the
plenum for the vote, left immediately afterward, looking a little
paler, while the opposition MKs were beaming.
</P>
<P>
The plenum had been almost empty for most of the nearly
four-hour debate, but MKs spilled in for the final vote.
</P>
<P>
Although the speakers had been largely uninterrupted, as
results became clear, opposition MKs heckled Knesset Speaker Dan
Tichon and coalition chairman Michael Eitan as they explained
that the vote was insufficient to bring the government down.
</P>
<P>
Later, Moshe Katsav, Deputy Prime Minister and Tourism
Minister, admitted the incident was "embarrassing."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Meretz leader Yossi Sarid said that under the
new law there is admittedly a government, but there is no
confidence in it, adding the vote did not promise the
government "a long life."

SEOUL, October 22 (Xinhua) -- South Korean automakers saw a
sale increase of 28.2 percent on the European Union (EU) market
last month, outperforming all other major car manufacturers, the
Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency (KOTRA) said here today.
</P>
<P>
A total of 21,000 South Korean cars were sold on the EU market
in September to give Korean automakers a 2.2-percent market share,
according to the KOTRA.
</P>
<P>
During the first nine months of this year, 189,750 South Korean
cars were sold in the EU member countries, an increase of 42.2
percent over the same period last year, and the highest among all
automakers.
</P>
<P>
The EU automobile market began to recover in June this year. In
September, the sales growth was up 12.2 percent from the previous
month.
</P>
<P>
KOTRA attributed the sharp rise in sales of South Korean cars
on the EU market to the Korean automakers' focus on selling
small-sized cars and satisfying consumers' tastes.

<HEADLINE> New Period of Development for Mongolian Language </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, October 22 (Xinhua) -- China's Mongolian culture, with
its 2,000-year history, suffered during the 1960s and 1970s, along
with other traditions, at the hands of leftist ideologists, Yun
Shenghua, cultural division chief of the region's Ethnic Affairs
Commission, said here recently.
</P>
<P>
However, the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China changed all that, Yun,
who is a Mongolian, recalled, and the Mongolian people are proud
that their traditions and language are respected by State laws and
by the members of other nationalities.
</P>
<P>
In this era of rapid change, there is still a good future for
their language and culture, and they expect that their language
will prosper.
</P>
<P>
Mongolian children are encouraged to choose their mother tongue
as their first language in school, and the Mongolian language is
being taught together with Chinese and English in primary and
middle schools thanks to the importance placed on it by the
central government and regional authorities, Yun said, adding that
learning materials in the Mongolian language, from primary school
through university, are now available.
</P>
<P>
More than three million Mongolians live in the autonomous
region. In the more than 2,000 Mongolian primary schools, Chinese
is taught in the third grade, and English, in the first year of
junior middle school.
</P>
<P>
At present, more Mongolian children are going to schools where
Mongolian is the language of instruction. Yun attributes this to
the higher calibre of teachers in Mongolian-language schools and
favorable jobs provided for Mongolian-only speakers.
</P>
<P>
In an ideal school, Yun said, students have a chance to learn
Mongolian, Chinese, and a little English.
</P>
<P>
At present, 70 percent of the population of Inner Mongolia are
proficient in Mongolian and Chinese.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Phones King Hussein, Mubarak on Hebron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu made phone calls Monday night to Jordanian King
Hussein and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to discuss the crisis
in the peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians, reported
Israel Radio today.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu discussed the issue with the two Arab leaders who
are both unhappy about Israel's intransigent positions regarding
negotiations with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak denied that he had advised Palestinian Authority (PA)
President Yasser Arafat to sign agreement on Hebron.
</P>
<P>
It appears all uncertain whether an agreement on Hebron
redeployment will be concluded soon in spite of intensive
negotiations in the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Middle East peace coordinator Dennis Ross, who observed
the talks all the time as a facilitator, announced at a press
conference here Monday afternoon that he had decided to go home
and will return when need arises in the future.
</P>
<P>
The joint Israeli-Palestinian Steering Committee met here
Monday night despite Ross's departure. But angry Palestinian
negotiators walked out of the security sub-committee talks to
protest the attitude of Israeli interlocutors, which they
described as that of "occupiers toward the occupied."
</P>
<P>
PLO security chief Mohammed Dahlan, referring to Dan Shomron,
Israeli chief negotiator and former army chief of staff, said,
"Unfortunately the head of the Israeli delegation treats the
Palestinian negotiators as if he is a military leader, and not as
a negotiator."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian negotiators went to Bethlehem to report to
Arafat, who flew to the West Bank city from the Gaza Strip
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Late Monday night, Arafat, in a militant mood, called for
"struggle, fight and Jihad" while delivering a speech in the
Deheishe Refugee Camp.
</P>
<P>
But, according to an Israel Radio report, the civil affairs
sub-committee talks between Israelis and Palestinians continued
Monday night and progress was achieved.
</P>
<P>
A senior Israeli diplomatic source shifted blame on the PA for
the stalled Hebron talks. The source told reporters that the two
sides were close to wrap up an agreement last week, but the
Palestinians backtracked out of political considerations.

<HEADLINE> Relics of Japanese Invasion Turned Into Patriotic Education Bases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Places in northeast China
which experienced the atrocities of Japanese aggressors have
become patriotic education bases for Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
The locations are receiving hundreds of thousands of visitors
every year.
</P>
<P>
The history of the Japanese invasion in northeast China dates
back to the Sino-Japanese War in 1894 and 1895, and the
Japan-Russia War at the beginning of this century, when Japanese
aggressors occupied the East Liaoning Peninsular, Lushun Port and
a railway.
</P>
<P>
On the night of September 18, 1931, the Japanese troops
stationed in northeast China triggered the war that led to the
invasion of China.
</P>
<P>
There are now more than 30 sites marking the Japanese invasion
in northeast China, according to the cultural relics
administration departments.
</P>
<P>
Four of them have been designated by the State Council to be
under key state protection, and the others are under local
protection.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, more than ten million yuan has been
put into the protection of the sites, and a number of museums have
been restored or set up.
</P>
<P>
The Museum of the Criminal Testimony of Army Unit 731 in
Harbin, capital of Heilongjiang Province, receives more than three
million people a year.
</P>
<P>
Army Unit 731 was engaged in chemical warfare and experimented
with chemical weapons on thousands of Chinese.
</P>
<P>
The sites and museums have also attracted Japanese people
expressing their remorse. More than 25,000 Japanese have visited a
pit in Pingdingshan in Fushun City, Liaoning Province, where
thousands of Chinese were buried by Japanese soldiers during the
Second World War.

FUZHOU, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The South Shaolin Temple will be
reconstructed on its original site in southeast China's Fujian
Province.
</P>
<P>
According to historical records, there are two Shaolin Temples
in China, one in central China's Henan Province, and the other in
Fuqing City in Fujian. The movie "Shaolin Temple," which triggered
a craze for Shaolin Boxing in the 1980s, is based on anecdotes
about the martial-arts monks of the temple in Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
According to Qiu Yuqing, former mayor of Fuqing, the
reconstruction of the South Shaolin Temple will cost more than 30
million yuan. Apart from government investment, a large portion of
the funds needs to be collected from people who were born in
Fuqing and now live overseas.
</P>
<P>
The city government has invested three million yuan in the
project since the site was discovered in Shaolin Village,
Dongzhang Township, in June of 1993, according to Qiu.

A martial arts school will also be built after the temple is
reconstructed, Qiu said.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, October 22 (Xinhua) -- An increasing number of
overseas business people are choosing Guangzhou, capital of
Guangdong province, as the place to invest in China, and are
facing fierce competition in the retail market.
</P>
<P>
The city is one of the places chosen by China to experiment
with ways to use more overseas funds in retailing sector,
according to local officials.
</P>
<P>
Large general merchandisers in the world, such as the US's
Wal-Mart, Britain's Marks and Spencer and Japan's Yaohan,
expressed the intention to come to launch joint ventures in
Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the city developed new preferential
treatment for multinational retailers to attract them to the city.
</P>
<P>
The province is in the forefront of China's reform and
opening-up drive, and Guangzhou started using overseas funds on a
trial basis in its retailing sector in 1993, and now has a dozen
overseas-backed retail ventures, involving a total investment of
28 million US dollars. Six of them have opened for business.
</P>
<P>
Sino-overseas retail joint ventures with import and export
rights can only be set up in six metropolises and five special
economic zones, such as Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Hainan,
and under current policy, sole overseas investment in the retail
sector is not permitted, and the wholesale business is closed to
overseas investors.

<HEADLINE> New Local Law in China Improves Investment Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, October 22 (Xinhua) -- In recent years, the Chinese
government has begun a fair competition policy for foreign
investors, replacing its preferential policies adopted during the
past decade.
</P>
<P>
The "Regulations for Joint Ventures" Recently issued by the
Fujian Provincial Government focuses on rights and interests of
joint ventures and government administrative behavior.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that the regulations reflect local government's
determination to improve the investment environment by using the
law.
</P>
<P>
Although China approved a series of laws and regulations on
foreign investment after 1978, when its reform and opening-up
policy started, most of them "emphasized conditions and procedures
of foreign investment, and few focused on the management of joint
ventures," an official with the provincial People's Congress noted.
</P>
<P>
The regulations also specify the duties of administrative
organizations and give joint ventures the right to challenge fines
and extra payments which do not accord with the laws and
regulations concerned.

BEIJING, October 22 (Xinhua) -- More than one million primary
school pupils from 28 cities across China will be shown how to
keep their teeth clean to avoid oral diseases as part of a
national campaign to improve oral health.
</P>
<P>
The program will include the use of fluoride toothpaste and
correct brushing of teeth, officials from the Ministry of Health
and the National Committee for Oral Health announced here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Procter &AMP; Gamble announced a donation of 10 million yuan (about
1.2 million US dollars) to the Oral Health Foundation of China to
support the program and research and prevention of tooth decay,
development of advanced oral health care products, and a national
survey on oral health care problems.
</P>
<P>
P&AMP;G is also marketing its Crest fluoride toothpaste, which has
passed the National Committee's evaluation process, to help
prevent tooth decay.
</P>
<P>
The incidence of tooth decay among Chinese pre-school children
has reached 80 to 90 percent due to lack of oral health care,
according to Prof. Dai Zhicheng, chairman of the committee.
</P>
<P>
Oral diseases also seriously affect the health of more than
half of China's adults, Dai said.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization has cited tooth decay as one of
the three major non-infectious diseases which should be prevented
and treated globally.
</P>
<P>
China has formulated a national oral health care program,
mainly for schools and vast rural areas, through the National
Committee and local organizations, according to Dai.
</P>
<P>
Fluoride toothpaste has been proven to be effective to
compensate for a fluoride deficiency and to prevent tooth decay,
said John Pepper, chairman and CEO of P&AMP;G.
</P>
<P>
A leading part of P&AMP;G's strategy is to improve the quality of
life of consumers in China and around the world, Pepper explained,
noting that "there is no better example of P&AMP;G doing this than
what we are doing to bring fluoride toothpaste and other oral
health care products to China."
</P>
<P>
P&AMP;G (China) Ltd. has seven joint ventures in China and is
working in co-operation with the State Education Commission on
education projects for oral health care among primary school
pupils in Beijing, Guangzhou, Shanghai, Tianjin, and other cities
since last year.

<HEADLINE> Info Users in Malaysia Urged to Do Self-Censorship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Information users in
Malaysia have been urged to exercise self-censorship, opting only
the good and rejecting the bad.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said today the
society must act for itself as the government could not keep up
with the rapid advance in communications technology through the
formulation of laws or policies or control mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
The government's control is not important if only useful
information is channelled through the telecommunications
equipment, he said when opening a new operating center of
Malaysia's TV3 television station near the capital.
</P>
<P>
All sorts of propaganda, deviationist teachings, foreign
ideologies and pornographic materials are being disseminated
through the modern equipment of communications technology, the
prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
"Human desire is exploited to reap more profits. The situation
is not much different from trafficking in drugs, regardless of its
effect," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian government, he said, would continue to use the
laws and certain technology to censor such materials which were
channelled through telecommunications equipment.
</P>
<P>
But just like drugs which were rejected because the majority of
the people were aware of its harmful effect, undesirable
information too could be rejected through similar awareness, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir appealed to the country's radio and television
stations to play a major role in efforts to combat these negative
elements by not only censoring the materials and programs for
broadcast but also selecting programs that are both entertaining
and contributing to development of good character.
</P>
<P>
He said those assigned the task must be selected people because
they had to make important value judgment in the selection and
censorship of the programs.
</P>
<P>
"We don't need fanatics who reject everything but we also don't
need people who are too liberal or irresponsible as censors in our
broadcasting stations," he said.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that TV3, as the country's first private television
station launched in June 1984, would become an example of a
responsible corporate and information body.

460 suspects in the last three days in a crackdown on criminals

<P>
The paper quoted a police spokesman Peter Kimanthi as saying
that it was believed seven of them were involved in a wave of
armed robberies in the city last week.

"We have intensified police checks at entry points along the
national borders to ensure that anybody coming into the country
does not bring illegal firearms with them," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, October 22 (Xinhua) -- China has closed more than ten
disc-making plants for serious copyright violations so far this
year, a senior copyright protection official has reported.
</P>
<P>
China has repeatedly conducted spot checks at business venues
where disks are produced, distributed and sold.
</P>
<P>
The surprise checks have successfully tracked down factories
violating copyright rules, Chen Zhaokuan, deputy director of the
Copyright Department of the State Copyright Bureau, said.
</P>
<P>
"Those operations that have violated the rules have been given
administrative punishments, and some of them have been ordered to
close down," Chen told an international seminar on intellectual
property rights protection. The meeting was recently held in
Hangzhou, capital city of southeast China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
People's courts nationwide have heard 2,600 copyright cases,
and finalized around 2,500 since 1991 when China implemented a
copyright law, Chen revealed.
</P>
<P>
"China has taken a series of measures to reinforce copyright
management," Chen said, citing rules for preventing unauthorized
use of overseas books and audio-video products, as well as those
against the use of illegally-duplicated computer software.
</P>
<P>
He said that China has established an authorization system for
overseas copyright owners, adding that China has also begun to
conduct supervision at customs posts, and introduced engraving
source identifications (SIDs) on the moulds of CD-ROM disks.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China has dispatched supervisors to disk plants to
bolster the management of audio-video products, electronic
publishing and reproduction processes, said Chen, who is also
deputy secretary-general of China Society of Intellectual
Property.

</P>
<P>
It is believed the devaluation is part of the International
Monetary Fund's (IMF) tough condition to extend financial
assistance to Pakistan, which is under severe pressure of debt
service and balance of payment.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and the IMF held negotiations last week to seek a
solution for releasing the delayed second and third batches of
IMF's 600 million dollars standby loan.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 22 (Xinhua) -- India and Russia are expected
to sign new services-to-services exchange agreement between the
armed forces of the two countries and arms deals during the
three-day visit of Russian Defense Minister Gen. Igor Rodionov,
who arrived here Monday night, local press said here today.
</P>
<P>
The Russian defense minister is expected to sign "some
concrete" arms deal including the supply of 40 top-of-the-line
Sukhoi Su-30MK long-range fighter bombers and MSTA-S self-
propelled howitzers. Several agreements including training of
Indian military personnel and exchange of operational experience
are also expected to be signed during Rodionov's visit.
</P>
<P>
More than 8,000 Indian officers and servicemen underwent
military training in the former Soviet Union. Defense cooperation
between the two countries has been "back on the track" since
Russian President Boris Yeltsin's visit to India in January 1993,
but the training of Indian officers in the top Russian military
academies still remains to be restarted after it came to a
grinding half in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Indian and Russian officials and diplomats have neither
confirmed nor denied the reports regarding the deals that are
expected to be signed between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Aleman Leads in Nicaragua's Presidential Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The latest official report
today suggested that Arnoldo Aleman, the right-wing presidential
candidate, was well ahead of his Sandinista rival Daniel Ortega in
Nicaragua's general elections.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Electoral Council (CSE) said that as 35.7 percent
of all ballot boxes were counted by mid-morning, Aleman had bagged
48.04 percent of the votes against Ortega's 39.35 percent in the
elections last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Under Nicaragua's electoral law, the candidate who receives
more than 45 percent of the votes can be declared the winner but a
second round of voting must be held if none of the candidates
passes the 45 percent mark.
</P>
<P>
Estimatedly 2.3 million Nicaraguans went to the voting booths
on Sunday to elect a president, a vice president, representatives
to the National Assembly and the Central American Parliament, and
local government officials.
</P>
<P>
If needed, a second-round presidential runoff could take place
at the end of next month.
</P>
<P>
However, with initial returns, Aleman had already claimed
victory.
</P>
<P>
Ortega, in his response, insisted that the claiming was too
early and it was hard to say who might win the election before the
CSE announces the final results, because a Sandinista count of
ballots put him slightly ahead.

DHAKA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's export earnings rose
11.84 percent to TK 32.30 billion (about 766.6 million US dollars)
during the first two months of the current fiscal beginning from
July 1 compared with the corresponding period of the previous
fiscal.
</P>
<P>
According to the Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce and Industry
(MCCI), in the same July-August period last year, Bangladesh's
export earnings were TK 28.79 billion (about 685.4 million
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Of the total earnings in the two months of this fiscal, raw
jute and jute goods, traditional exports, contributed TK 2.62
billion (about 62.4 million dollars) or 8.13 percent while
non-jute items earned TK 29.58 billion (704.2 million dollars) or
91.87 percent.
</P>
<P>
Although the export earnings increased in the two months, the
performance of some major items, including the pillar item of
ready-made garments, was not up to the mark.

Export receipts from the ready-made garments during these two
months rose 7.10 percent to TK 16.95 billion (40.35 million

<HEADLINE> Indian Industry Ministry Reviewing FDI Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 22 (Xinhua) -- India's Industry Ministry is
to review the foreign direct investment (FDI) projects already
approved to find out the reasons for the delay in their
implementation, a government official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will start the review process with the power
sector and will look into all the mega projects which have been
approved so far.
</P>
<P>
It will also take up the snags in the implementation of these
projects with the concerned departments for speedy clearances.
This is expected to augment the inflow positions, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest figures available with the Industry
Ministry, the actual FDI inflow in the first eight months of 1996
was 1.63 billion US dollars as against the 1.82 billion dollars
actual inflow in 1995. The ministry now expects the FDI inflow to
reach only last year's level, which will be far below the figure
of 3 billion dollars projected by the Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
While the total foreign investment approvals have reached an
impressive figure of 23.3 billion dollars from August 1991 to
August 1996, the actual inflow during this period was just 5.1
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Besides speeding up the implementation of the mega FDI
projects, the ministry's decision to undertake a sector-wise
review was aimed at regaining the confidence of foreign investors
in the country.
</P>
<P>
There has been a fall of about 10 percent in the number of new
FDI proposals in the last few months and several foreign companies
were understood to be putting on hold their investment plans in
India, the same source added.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: U.S. Urged to End Embargo Against Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The international
community has strongly urged the United States to implement last
year's United Nations resolution ending its three-decade long
embargo against Cuba, and to stop imposing its laws on other
countries.
</P>
<P>
A report by the U.N. Secretary General, available today, said
that the General Assembly adopted a resolution entitled "Necessity
of ending the economic, commercial and financial embargo imposed
by the United States against Cuba" on November 2, 1995.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali then invited
governments and U.N. agencies to provide him with any information
they wanted to contribute to the preparation of his report.
</P>
<P>
By September 5, the secretary-general had received replies from
69 governments and five bodies and agencies within the U.N. system.
</P>
<P>
The overwhelming majority of the replies urged the U.S. to
implement the General Assembly's resolution and expressed concern
at the losses and hardships suffered by Cuba and its people.
</P>
<P>
The reply of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP)
noted that the effects of the U.S. embargo on Cuba are diverse and
mainly derived from its economic dimensions.
</P>
<P>
The embargo has directly affected Cuba's foreign trade and
indirectly its entire economy. According to official estimates by
the Cuban government, the impact on the economy and trade from
1960 to 1993 amounts to 29.7 billion U.S dollars in direct effects
and some 6.4 billion U.S. dollars in indirect effects.
</P>
<P>
Financially, Cuba estimates losses of 3.5 billion dollars as
the embargo has prevented Cuba's access to all sources of
multilateral public financing. Cuba also has lost an additional
3.3 billion dollars because of the impossibility of renegotiating
its foreign debt, the UNDP estimates.
</P>
<P>
In the social area, official figures estimate damages amounting
to 1.3 billion dollars as the country has faced economic
difficulties which affected education, water supplies, sanitation
and public health, the UNDP added.
</P>
<P>
The Russian government said in its reply, "Almost the entire
world community, with few exceptions, regards the continuing
commercial and economic embargo against Cuba imposed by the
U.S. as a manifestation of the outdated mentality of confrontation
between blocs."
</P>
<P>
Russia said that lifting the embargo and normalizing U.S.-Cuban
relations would promote a more healthy international situation and
would facilitate Cuba's inclusion in world economic relations and
thus advance Cuban society towards democracy and greater openness.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Helms-Burton Act adopted by the U.S. Congress
in March, which imposes sanctions on foreign companies investing
in Cuba, the Indian government said India has consistently opposed
any unilateral measures by one country which impinge on the
sovereignty of another country.
</P>
<P>
The German government also said that Germany has consistently
expressed its opposition to the promulgation and application by
U.N. member states of laws and regulations whose extraterritorial
effects affect the sovereignty of other states, as well as the
freedom to trade.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban government, in a 76-section long reply, stated the
main points and consequences of the U.S. new legislation. It said
internationalizing the 35-year long blockade against Cuba through
the Helms-Burton law is aimed at stifling its economy and
undermining its political, institutional and social order.
</P>
<P>
The United States imposed its embargo against Cuba in 1962.
The United Nations General Assembly has adopted four resolutions
urging the U.S. to end its embargo since 1992.

<P>
WASHINGTON, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
expected to continue a strong cooperative relationship with the
next japanese government, which will be soon formed after the
election.
</P>
<P>
"We look forward to working with the next government, and we
certainly look forward to working with the ministers that are
appointed in that government," State Department spokesman Nicholas
Burns said.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Liberal Democratic Party has won 239 seats in the
500-member lower house of Parliament, the key chamber, in the
national elections held on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
With a dozen short of the majority it needs, the Liberal
Democrats, which has dominated the country for most of the
post-war era, will almost be sure to form a coalition with another
party and Ryutaro Hashimoto is likely to take a second term of
premiership.
</P>
<P>
The United States sees the U.S.-Japan relationship as the
fundamental key for its presence at the Asia-Pacific areas.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to continue to have a productive and sustained,
excellent relationship with Japan in the future," Burns said.
</P>
<P>
Later at a White House briefing, Press Secretary Mike McCurry
said: "We congratulate Prime Minister Hashimoto on his own
re-election to the Diet (Parliament). We look forward to working
with the New Japanese government when it is formed."
</P>
<P>
"The United States has enjoyed excellent working relationships
with Prime Minister Hashimoto. The president looks forward to
seeing him when they meet in the Philippines for the APEC meeting
coming up next month."

<HEADLINE> Telecom Forum Opens on Global Mobile Satellite Systems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Delegates from more than 126
countries met here today at a major forum to formulate a common
policy towards new satellite technologies which may usher in a new
era of personal telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
The focus of the three-day forum, organized by the
International Telecommunication Union (ITU), is a host of new
satellite systems, known collectively as Global Mobile
Communications by Satellite (GMPCS), which could offer users a way
to make phone calls, send faxes and even transfer multimedia data
from and to anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
These new non-geostationary satellite systems, most of them are
scheduled to come into operation within the next five years, will
offer global coverage via "constellations" of low earth orbit
satellites circling around the earth, transferring signals to
earth stations or between each other.
</P>
<P>
A major benefit of the new system is that it is able to provide
reliable communications for remote areas or parts of the world
with poor fixed-line telecommunications infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Despite the advantages, new GMPCS systems also bring along many
problems which need to be ironed out before operators begin
offering services to users.
</P>
<P>
Issues of sovereignty over national communications,
inter-connection between existing networks and new services, and
global licensing of both operators and equipment will be very
challenging to revolve, critics warned.
</P>
<P>
For developing countries, the fact that the new systems are
privately owned, and therefore not directly controlled by
governments as were previous global satellite systems, is one
source of general concern.
</P>
<P>
More specific issues include the possibility that GMPCS
services will be provided even in countries where they have not
been authorized, and that the possible bypass of developing
countries' public networks will result in loss of revenues.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, as the new systems become more sophisticated and
begin to offer a wide range of advanced services, developing
countries also fear that their networks will ultimately be unable
to compete for customers.
</P>
<P>
ITU said that the forum cannot produce prescriptive regulatory
outcomes with binding force. However, it shall prepare reports
and opinions for consideration by ITU members.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening session of the forum today, ITU
Secretary-General Pekka Tarjanne said he did not see the ITU's
role in the development of GMPCS as that of a global regulator.
Instead, he recommended that nations continue to work towards
agreement on common approaches to common problems.

WASHINGTON, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Spokesman of the U.S. State
Department Niclolas Burns said today that the Sino-U.S. relations
are improved, although the two countries have a number of
outstanding and strong differences on important issues.
</P>
<P>
"We're certainly in a better position than we were in 1995 and

He said that the United States and China have decided that "the
importance of our relationship is so great that we need to agree

other, despite the fact that we have problems."
</P>
<P>
"The key thing, given the importance of the relationship, is to
keep (high-level) meeting," he said.
</P>
<P>
For this purpose, he said, Secretary of State Warren
Christopher will travel to Beijing for a couple of days in
November.
</P>
<P>
He said that the secretary believes "very strongly" that the
United States has got to keep working with the Chinese side.
</P>
<P>
"There are a number of issues where we can work very positively
and fruitfully together," he said, citing the issue of Korean
Peninsula as an example.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 22 (Xinhua) -- China is striving to
restructure state investment and is planning to put more funds
into infrastructure projects such as transport, energy resources,
telecoms, and residential housing, according to a senior Chinese
construction expert.
</P>
<P>
China's fast economic growth means a boom in the construction
sector, where output value will rise at an average annual rate of
13 percent, Chief Engineer of China's Ministry of Construction,
Yao Bing, said Monday in an address to the ongoing International
Conference on Construction Modernization and Education. This means
a great potential in its construction business for foreign
investors.
</P>
<P>
China is set to begin large-scale housing development along
with other huge projects such as the Three Gorges water-control
project on the Yangtze River and the Beijing-Kowloon Railway.
</P>
<P>
To realize its goal of making housing more comfortable, China
will build 1.65 billion sq.m. of existing urban housing nationwide
and renovate and upgrade 2.9 billion sq.m. of existing housing.
</P>
<P>
China is also planning to add 230 cities and 5,000 towns in the
remaining years of the century.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 foreign enterprises from over a dozen countries
and regions, including the United States, Japan, France, Britain,
Germany, Italy, Malaysia and Singapore, have engineering contracts
in Chinese construction.
</P>

HAVANA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Cuban authorities said today
that they were sending emergency food and building materials to
help people left homeless by Hurricane Lili which lashed the
country last weekend.
</P>
<P>
International aid agencies including the Red Cross have also
arrived on the island to assess the country's situation.
</P>
<P>
The shipping of aid material for the hurricane victims began 24
hours after Lili struck the central and western part of the
island, the weekly "Trabajadores" (workers) quoted the authorities
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The hurricane destroyed 146,000 homes, caused flooding and the
loss of crops and forced 250,000 people to leave their homes. But
nobody is reported to have died, according to the Cuban
authorities.
</P>
<P>
The authorities are sending 6,000 tons of grains and peas in
particular, which are nutritious and cheap to buy on the
international market.
</P>
<P>
Building materials including asbestos shingles, cement and
paper are also being provided.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Magazine Names Mysterious Drug Dealer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Orlando Sanchez
Cristtancho, a popular Colombian motor dealer, could be the
mysterious and powerful drug baron nicknamed the "man in
overalls," the "Semana" magazine claimed today.
</P>
<P>
The "man in overalls" is even feared by the Cali drug cartel
chieftains who have described him as "worse than (late drug
kingpin) Pablo Escobar," said "Semana" in its latest issue.
</P>
<P>
The magazine revealed a telephone conversation which took place
in May between Miguel Rodrigez Orejuela and Helmer "Pacho"
Herrera, two Cali cartel chieftains, over the May 24 attack on
Rodrigez's son William Rodriguez Abadia which left him critically
injured and five of his bodyguards dead.
</P>
<P>
"Semana" said Rodriguez asked Herrera in their conversation to
speak with the "man in overalls" to clear up an accounting problem
that angered the mysterious person.
</P>
<P>
Miguel Rodriguez then identified the "man in overalls" as
Orlando Sanchez, whom prosecutors believe masterminded a major
assassination case.
</P>
<P>
"Semana" quoted judicial sources and security bodies as saying
that it is very possible that Sanchez is the "man in overalls."
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the man had worked many years for
Rodriguez Orejuela and served as a permanent business liaison
between Colombian cartels and the Mexican underworld.
</P>
<P>
According to "Semana," the "man in overalls" has his own
organization, which is among five cartels that have been fighting
for control of drug turfs in the past 12 months as the Cali cartel
was dismantled.

<HEADLINE> China Has More Cellular Phones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 22 (Xinhua) -- In the first nine months of
this year, China saw an increase of 2.265 million new subscribers
for cellular phones, "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper cited information from the Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications as saying that by the end of September of this
year, the total number of cellular-phone subscribers amounted to
5.89 million. The figure is expected to reach seven million by the
end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong Province claimed the largest number of new cellular
phone users during January-September, with the figure recorded as
398,589.
</P>
<P>
Cellular phone service was first introduced to China in 1987,
it has since experienced an annual growth rate of 200
percent. Cellular-phone service has now become available in all
Chinese cities and in many towns and townships in coastal regions.
</P>
<P>
Rapid development of the country's cellular-phone service has
been supported by the fast expansion of the country's telephone
work.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, in the first nine months of this
year, there were 12.059 million new telephone subscribers
(including 2.265 million new cellular-phone users), or more than
90 percent of the phone-installation target set for 1996 -- a
total of 13 million new phone subscribers.
</P>
<P>
Again Guangdong continued to top other provinces, autonomous
regions and municipalities in telephone installations.
</P>
<P>
A source from the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications
predicted that this year's target of 13 million will be exceeded
by two million.

<HEADLINE> Elections to Become Shorter, Cheaper in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The federal elections in Canada
are to become shorter and cheaper under the legislation which was
tabled at the House of Commons today.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, Canada's federal election campaigns would be
reduced to a minimum of 36 days from the current 47.
</P>
<P>
A permanent voters list would be created, thus removing the
need for tens of thousands of enumerators, and an estimated 22
million U.S. dollars will be saved per election as a result.
</P>
<P>
In the next general election, polling hours across the country
is also expected to have some changes.
</P>
<P>
Under the current Canada Elections Act, polls open across the
country from 9 a.m. and end at 8 p.m. local time.
</P>
<P>
But voters in the west provinces, especially in British
Columbia, have complained that while they are still voting,
results in eastern and central Canada are already known.
</P>
<P>
Under a private member's bill introduced last month in the
Commons, polls will open later in the east time zone areas so that
voters in the west can cast their ballots without already knowing
the results in other provinces.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian government has expressed the hope that these
changes will be in place by the next general election, which is
widely expected early next year.

<HEADLINE> Russian Duma Not Ready to Ratify Start-2 Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 21 (Xinhua) -- State Duma Speaker Gennady
Seleznyov said here today that Russian lawmakers are not in any
hurry to ratify the Start-2 arms reduction treaty signed with the
U.S. in 1993.
</P>
<P>
"We are not in a hurry to discuss the ratification of the
treaty before we have conducted detailed studies of various ways
to handle it," Seleznyov said at a meeting with visiting
U.S. Senator Sam Nunn, a ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed
Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
Members of the State Duma (lower house of parliament) have
insisted on holding a hearing to determine whether the treaty of
the second Strategic Arms Reduction Talks (Start-2) is in Russia's
security interests, he said.
</P>
<P>
Duma members Vladimir Lukin and Viktor Ilyukhin, who are in
charge of international politics and security, suggested reopening
negotiations with their U.S. counterparts to modify the treaty to
make it acceptable to the Russians, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
There is growing opposition in the Duma and other circles to
the treaty, partly because of the cost of dismantling the nuclear
weapons, and also because many Russians feel they would be
vulnerable and open to blackmail from the West.
</P>
<P>
Russians see the ratification of the Start-2 treaty as linked
to NATO's planned expansion into eastern Europe, which is fiercely
opposed by Russia. Some lawmakers want to use the ratification of
the treaty as a bargaining chip over the issue.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry delivered a speech to the
Duma last Thursday, in an attempt to persuade the Russian
parliament to ratify the treaty.
</P>
<P>
Start-2 requires the United States and Russia to slash their
nuclear arsenals to between 3,000 and 3,500 long-range warheads
each by the year 2003, a reduction of some two-thirds from Cold
War levels.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Senate ratified the treaty in January this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The Ukrainian government has
decided to go by an international treaty and phase out chemicals
that could deplete the ozone layer in the upper atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
A UNIAN news service report today said the decision regarding
chlorfluorocrabons, or CFCs, aims to implement the Montreal Ozone
Protection Protocol first open for signature in 1987.
</P>
<P>
As a signatory of the treaty, Ukraine should stop, by the year
2000, the production and applications of the chemicals now widely
used as coolant, solvent, spray propellant, etc.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine actually doesn't make CFCs, but import the chemicals
for use in virtually all industrial sectors.
</P>
<P>
If released into open air, CFCs could reach and destroy the
ozone layer that provides a shield for life on Earth against the
excessive solar radiation in the ultraviolet spectrum.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Maintain Financial Support Over Media </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Russia will continue to give
favorable financial and tax treatment to journalists and media
organizations, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Ignatenko said
here today.
</P>
<P>
He was responding to fears by journalists that their tax
treatment would be changed in the 1997 budget which was debated by
the lower house of parliament last week.
</P>
<P>
Under the current law, journalists and media organizations
don't pay tax or value-added tax and, unlike other businesses, are
not obliged to change their foreign currency earnings into roubles.
</P>
<P>
Media organizations and journalists welcomed the government's
decision, and pointed out that any real improvement in the
financial situation of the cash-strapped media in Russia can only
come about as a result of economic development.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the government and the State Duma, the
Journalists Association said that changing the tax-collection
rules over the media would remove the supporting pillars which are
propping the sector up.

<HEADLINE> WFP to Evacuate Stranded U.N. Staff from Eastern Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP) will
try to evacuate stranded United Nations and other agency personnel
on Tuesday following a last minute decision by the Zairean
authorities to allow a WFP-chartered flight into strife-torn Uvira
in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
A WFP-chartered Hercules plane has twice tried to fly into
Uvira but each time was denied permission to land by the Zairean
authorities who had insisted that the plane first stop at Bukavu,
capital of South Kivu province in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
There are between 44 and 54 U.N. and other aid workers stranded
at Uvira, a lakeside town some 2,000 kilometers east of the
capital Kinshasa, where they have been manning refugee camps.
</P>
<P>
The area has seen fierce fighting between Zairean troops and
Banyamurenges rebels, ethnic Tutsis originally from Rwanda, but
who have been living in Zaire for several generations.
</P>
<P>
WFP has been providing emergency food rations to some 225,000
refugees from neighboring Burundi and Rwanda in the Uvira camps
who had fled the ethnic conflicts in their countries. But reports
say the refugees are abandoning the camps because of the fighting
and that a mass exodus of more than 200,000 refugees is underway.
</P>
<P>
In Geneva, a spokesman for the United Nations High Commission
for Refugees (UNHCR) confirmed fighting between Zairean troops and
the ethnic Tutsis near Bwegera, just north of Uvira.
</P>
<P>
Conflict between Zairean government forces and the ethnic
Tutsis, who have been denied Zairean citizenship, has been growing
for months.

<HEADLINE> China Calls for Greater Efforts Against Drug Menace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 21 (Xinhua) -- China today called for
greater and worldwide efforts in cracking down on drug-related
crimes.
</P>
<P>
Shi Weiqiang, speaking on behalf of the Chinese delegation at
the "International Drug Control" session of the 51st General
Assembly today, said China supports the convening of a special
session of the General Assembly on Drug Control in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"China hopes that the session will set forth clear strategic
goals and specific measures," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegation is of the view that combating drugs
should be a priority on the U.N. agenda.
</P>
<P>
The international community should enhance cooperation and
adopt more resolute and effective measures in combating illicit
supply, demand, production, marketing and trafficking of drugs as
well as in countering crimes such as smuggling and money
laundering, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese representative also said China has consistently
maintained that producing, consuming and transit states should
share responsibility and join efforts at the national, regional
and international levels in the war against the drug menace.
</P>
<P>
The developing countries are experiencing more difficulties in
their fight against drugs, so they should benefit more from the
technical and financial assistance resulting from international
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Shi added that in the efforts to combat drug abuse and related
crimes, the sovereignty and territorial integrity of nations
should be strictly respected.
</P>
<P>
"No interference in another state's internal affairs on the
pretext of cooperation is allowed," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also gave an account of China's achievements in cracking
down on drug abuse and related crimes. He held out hope that
China can get support from the international community, since, he
said, the situation in the Golden Triangle Areas "has yet to be
changed fundamentally."

YANGON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar will increase crude oil
and fuel imports to meet the growing local fuel consumption,
according to "the New Light of Myanmar" today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the Ministry of Energy is coordinating
with foreign oil companies and local enterprises to extend crude
oil and fuel imports as local demand for fuel is growing due to
adoption of the market-oriented system in the country.
</P>
<P>
At present, Myanmar imports 100 million US dollars worth of
fuel annually. The daily consumption of petrol in the country is
over 150,000 gallons and diesel oil is over 400,000 gallons.

<HEADLINE> Mindanao Peace Talks Going on Quietly, Says Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Peace talks between the
Philippine government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF)
are going on quietly and smoothly despite occasional clashes in
Mindanao, the Philippine Star newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
"We are talking with MILF and we hope the MILF will fulfill its
intention of reaching an agreement with the government, armed
force spokesman Fredesvindo Cobarrubias was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the paper said, the rebel group is waging
small-scale attacks against government forces guarding an
irrigation project in Carmen, in central Mindanao, the MILF's
stronghold.
</P>
<P>
But both the government and MILF said that the occasional
clashes would not affect the peace negotiations, according to the
paper.
</P>
<P>
The 15,000-strong MILF has rejected a peace agreement signed by
the government and the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) last
month, and has become the major rebel group in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
As clashes between the government and MILF forces are casting a
shadow over the peace prospects in Mindanao, the government is
trying to secure a formal ceasefire agreement with the Muslim
rebel group.

PANAMA CITY, October 21 (Xinhua) -- A multinational center to
help Latin American countries fight drug trafficking could be set
up in Panama.
</P>
<P>
Panamanian President Ernesto Perez Balladares put forward the
plan during talks here with U.S. President Bill Clinton's
anti-drugs supremo General Barry McCaffrey today.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference after the talks, Perez Balladares said
the two sides discussed the setting up of an anti-drugs center on
the U.S. Howard Air Base in Panama and are to form a special
commission to work out the proposal.
</P>
<P>
Officials from Panama's foreign ministry have already started
enlisting the support of other Latin American governments,
although Foreign Minister Ricard Alberto Arias said he was not
trying to seek political support or backing.
</P>
<P>
Rather he was inviting the countries to take take part in the
center within their own framework and interests.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Export processing zones will
continue to play an important role in the country's economic
development, participants attending a conference agreed Monday.
</P>
<P>
Stress should be put on developing high-tech sectors in the
future, according to the participants at the conference of the
World Export Processing Zones Association (Wepza).
</P>
<P>
The three-day 16th international conference opened yesterday in
the Tianjin Economic Technological Development Area (TEDA).
</P>
<P>
It is the first time an international conference of Wepza, a
world organization of 35 export processing-zone organizations, has
been held in China, said today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Teda, a 35-sq-km export-oriented zone approved by the central
government in 1984, was chosen as the meeting site.
</P>
<P>
"Teda is one of the most successful zones financially in
China," Richard Bolin, director of Wepza's secretariat, said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, the original 32 State-level economic
and technological-development zones had approved 10,193
overseas-invested projects with an actual inflow of overseas
captial totalling 10 billion US dollars, or 7.5 percent of China's
total, according to Ge Hongsheng, director of the Office for
Special Economic Zones under the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Ge said that such zones will play a key role in China's
economic development as a "testing place" and "window." He also
urged existing economic-development zones to introduce more
high-tech and high value-added overseas-investment projects.
</P>
<P>
Bolin said such zones can help them avoid trade barriers and
the zones generally provide relatively good infrastructure and
convenient services.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Likely to Reshuffle Cabinet Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
has hinted at a cabinet revamp in January next year after an
assessment is made on the performance of his cabinet members.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the first international conference on governance
innovations held here on Monday, Ramos said that "I will do what
is necessary and appropriate for those who can not live up to the
standards they themselves set."
</P>
<P>
The president said that a reshuffle of his cabinet could be
expected by January after the Philippines hosts the informal
leadership conference of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) in November. However, he did not mention any cabinet
members to be affected by the revamp.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said at the meeting that he required all cabinet members
to submit their performance contracts at the start of every year,
thus getting the chance to judge their performance individually.
</P>
<P>
He added that the contract was a policy innovation "that has
been proven very effective" in monitoring the performance of his
official family.
</P>
<P>
The president has in the past replaced cabinet officials
involved in controversies. Labor Secretary Nieves Confesor and
Foreign Affairs Secretary Roberto Romulo were replaced last year
following the outrage over the hanging of Filipino maid Flor
Contemplacion in Singapore.

<HEADLINE> BP, Sinopec Plan 2.5 Billion US Dollar Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The China and Petrochemical
Corp (Sinopec) and British Petroleum Development (BP) will
co-operate in building a 2.5 billion US dollars ethylene
manufacturing complex in eastern China, according to today's China
Daily.
</P>
<P>
A letter of intent for the 50:50 equity joint venture was
signed yesterday in Beijing between Sinopec's Shanghai
Petrochemical Co Ltd and the BP Chemicals Co.
</P>
<P>
The complex is expected to produce 650,000 tons of ethylene and
derivative products annually.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary reports are expected to be ready this year, but
production might not be reached until early next century.
</P>
<P>
This venture, one of China's State-planned six major ethylene
projects for the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) and development
up to 2010, is likely to occur before 2000, a Sinopec executive
said.
</P>
<P>
A letter of intent for another of the six projects, worth 6
billion US dollars and scheduled for construction in Nanjing in
Jiangsu Province, was signed early this year between Sinopec and
the German company of BASF.
</P>
<P>
Chinese are still selecting foreign partners for the other
four, which will be built in Tianjin and other provinces of Gansu,
Liaoning and Fujian.
</P>
<P>
All six will be capable of producing more than 600,000 tons of
ethylene a year.
</P>
<P>
The facilities for the production of ethylene and downstream
products will be installed in plants in several locations in
Shanghai and Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
If possible, a sub-project for manufacturing a chemical called
vinyl cyanide will be started before other sub-projects, a Sinopec
executive said.
</P>
<P>
The co-operation between BP, a world-famous oil firm, and
Shanghai Petrochemical Co, one of China's largest petrochemical
conglomerates, will benefit the country's petrochemical industry
and corporate management, president Sheng Huaren said at the
signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
This project, still under negotiation with BP, should utilize
advanced technology and be of world-class scale, efficient and
competitive, Sheng noted.

WASHINGTON, October 21 (Xinhua) -- A wildfire destroyed at
least 12 homes and damaged eight others in an Orange County
community in California today while firefighters were battling a
607-hectare wildfire northwest of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of residents of the Los Angeles suburb of Calabasas
fled as fire raced through dry brush, fanned by gusting winds.
Four schools were evacuated as the blaze spread at an alarming
rate.
</P>
<P>
Officials said the fire, racing through rugged terrain and had
already swept through 600 hectares, was continuing its course of
expansion.
</P>
<P>
Firefighters were mobilized to battle the fires on the ground
and from the air, but their efforts were hampered by high winds.
Helicopters were dropping water on the fire, but they found the
water just turned into a fine spray that had little effect on the
flames.
</P>
<P>
However, firefighters were close to containing a wildfire in
northern California that had threatened homes and businesses along
the coast in the Los Padres National Forest. The fire has
consumed some 270 hectares.

<HEADLINE> Trade Promoted With Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 22 (Xinhua) -- China wishes to develop trade
and carry out deeper economic co-operation with the Republic of
Colombia, today's China daily cited Wu Yi, minister of Foreign
Trade and Economic Co-operation as saying.
</P>
<P>
Wu made her remark at a meeting with her Colombian counterpart,
Morris Harf Meyer, who is in a four-day visit with President
Ernesto Samper Pizano, the first Colombian president to visit
China.
</P>
<P>
"Bilateral trade is still small, but it is expected to grow
rapidly with the promotion of the two governments," said Wu.
</P>
<P>
According to customs statistics, bilateral trade reached 65.9
million US dollars in 1995, including 52.2 million US dollars in
Chinese exports and 13.7 million US dollars in imports from
Colombia.
</P>
<P>
Major Chinese exports include paraffin wax, machinery,
light-industrial products, textiles and garments. In contrast,
China mainly imports from Colombia bananas, coffee and, in some
years, cotton, sugar and steel.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade topped 27.9 million US dollars in the first
eight months of 1996. Chinese exports reached 27.5 million US
dollars, while Colombia exports to China reached 380,000 US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
"China welcomes Colombia to make a list of the products it
wants to sell to China, so that bilateral trade can grow more
rapidly and evenly," said Wu.
</P>
<P>
Colombia is famous for its tropical products including bananas,
coffee and plants. But due to various reasons such as the drinking
habits of Chinese people, who usually favour tea instead of
coffee, teh market for some Colombian products is limited.
</P>
<P>
Meyer said the Colombia Government will soon set up a special
office in Beijing to promote bilateral trade and economic
co-operation with China.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the anti-dumping tariffs Colombia has imposed on some
Chinese export commodities, including textiles and shoes, since
February this year, Wu Yi said she wished the Colombian Government
would reconsider the matter.
</P>
<P>
"Some Chinese products are cheap simply because the labour cost
and prices of raw materials are cheaper than those in other
countries," said Wu.
</P>
<P>
At the reception in the meeting hall of the China Council for
the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT) yesterday morning,
welcoming the visit of the Colombian President and his delegation,
An Chenxing, vice-chairman of CCPIT disclosed that an agreement
would be signed between CCPIT and Proexport Colombia, the Invest
in Colombia Corporation and the Colombian Confederation of
Chambers of Commerce to lay to solid foundation for future
Sino-Colombian bilateral economic co-operation.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the reception, President Pizano said he hoped
that bilateral economic ties would be further cemented for mutual
benefit.

Delphi's operations in China, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Covering an area of 12,300 sq m in the East District of

</P>
<P>
"Our products will be exported to Europe and gradually sold in
the domestic market," said Norbert Geisinger, president of Delphi
Packard Electric Systems. "We have established long-term and very
close relations with China."
</P>
<P>
Delphi has 11 joint ventures producing automobile systems,
parts, batteries and electronics in northern and central China. It
also has four technological-transfer contracts with Chinese
automobile manufacturers.
</P>
<P>

BEIJING, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The ecosystem of Northeast
China's Bohai Bay has improved markedly this year following
tighter controls on pollution sources by nearby provinces and
cities, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Local governments in Shandong, Liaoning and Hebei provinces and
Tianjin have all taken measures to close paper mills producing
less than 100 tons. Paper mills discharge waste water into the bay
via local rivers.
</P>
<P>
More and more people in the area are becoming aware of the
function the marine environment plays in social development, the
newspaper commended.
</P>
<P>
Dalian, a scenic coastal city at the southern end of the
Liaodong Peninsula, is taking stringent measures to treat and
control its coastal pollution sources.
</P>
<P>
Industrial development in the 1920s left many sources of
pollution scattered along the Dalian Bay, a part of the Bohai Bay.
</P>
<P>
Last year these pollution sources discharged 250 million tons
of industrial waste water into the Bohai Bay.
</P>
<P>
The Dalian city government ordered the factories to close down
pollution-causing operations, construct waste-treatment, or more
away from the coast.

WASHINGTON, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The United States will
evacuate about 600 Iraqi opposition members to an Air Force base
in Guam and be processed for asylum into this country, the State
Department said on Monday.

<P>
These Iraqi opposition members are now staying in Silopi in

September, and will fly to Anderson Air Force Base in Guam late on
Monday, State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said.

all feared persecution or the risk of serious harm to themselves
or their families should they have stayed in Iraq," Burns said.

The 600 Iraqi opposition members will join more than 2,000
other northern Iraqis already in Guam, most of them are Kurds or

northern Iraq.

WASHINGTON, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Export-Import Bank
today announced the approval of financial backing for 200 million
U.S. dollars in exports of oil well services to the Cabinda oil
field offshore Angola.
</P>
<P>
Offshore oil operations have been conducted in Cabinda for
almost 40 years. The U.S. bank's guarantee of an 88.6 million
dollar loan by Societe Generale, New York will enable the
Houston-based Halliburton Energy Services to perform oil well
completion and remediation services for four years in the Cabinda
Concession Area.
</P>
<P>
The financing provided to borrower Sonangol, the Angolan
national oil company, will be secured by the proceeds of oil sales
through an offshore escrow account. In addition, Banco Nacional de
Angola (BNA), the central bank of Angola, is also providing a
repayment guarantee to the U.S. Ex-Im Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Ex-Im Bank is a governmental agency which helps finance and

<HEADLINE> Canadian Retailers Expect Bleak Christmas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Canadian retailers appear to be
bracing themselves for another difficult Christmas season, a
survey of business expectations shows.
</P>
<P>
Retailers' optimism on sales and employment for the current
quarter fell sharply from third-quarter levels, the Globe and Mail
newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Canadian retailers are "once bitten, twice shy" ahead of the
coming Christmas shopping season, said Steve Munden of the Dun &AMP;
Bradstreet Canada Ltd. that did the survey.
</P>
<P>
"The last couple of Christmas seasons have been pretty poor in
Canada," he said. "It is possible of `Here we go again.'"
</P>
<P>
Last year's Christmas season was a bad one for Canadian
retailers. Sales tumbled 2.9 percent from the previous year. The
1994 season was good, with December sales 5.8 percent ahead of a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
However, in both years, retailers endured tremendous pressure
on price margins. Between November and December, retail prices
fell 0.5 percent in 1995, and 0.3 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Lower optimism among retailers results not just from the soft
sales environment, but pickier shoppers and increased competition
from specialty discount stores, Munden added.
</P>
<P>
The latest retail sales figures from Statistics Canada will
surely prompt more fears of a weak Christmas for retailers.
</P>
<P>
Statistics Canada reported today that the retail sales
decreased 0.4 percent in August after three months of gains. The
month's sales figure had been widely expected to rise by the same
number.

<HEADLINE> Ross to Be Back Soon to Mideast, U.S. Official Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Middle East mediator
Dennis Ross is returning from his 16 days of Israeli-Palestinian
peace talks, but will soon be back to the region if needed, the
State Department said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ross is back to Washington at the instruction of Secretary of
State Warren Christopher after he has failed to break a stalemate
in Israeli-Palestinian talks ever since the Washington emergency
summit on the Middle East peace process early this month.
</P>
<P>
But he "will be heading back to Taba and Elat and Jerusalem and
Gaza to continue his own involvement in these talks in a very
short period of time," State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns
said.
</P>
<P>
Ross has failed to make the two parts agree on most critical
outstanding issues such as the redeployment of Israeli troops in
Hebron, which, though agreed upon by the former Israeli Labor
government and the Palestinians in 1993, was suspended by the new
Likud government after it won the May elections.
</P>
<P>
But Ross said formal talks in Elat in Israel and Taba in Egypt,
along with informal discussions, had reached a level of
specificity that made his involvement less important.
</P>
<P>
He said other U.S. diplomats would remain actively involved
when he is in Washington to talk with Christopher over the talks.
</P>
<P>
"Ambassador Martin Indyk, our ambassador to Israel, and Ed
Abington, our consul general in Jerusalem, will be physically
present in Taba and Elat as these talks proceed this week. So the
United States will remain at the table," Burns said.
</P>
<P>
Burns acknowledged that there were "very tough issues", "While
they've made progress, they haven't made all the progress they
need to make to get to the finish line." he added.

NEW YORK, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Stocks ended slightly lower
today as a wave of profit-taking wiped out another push to record
levels amid solid earnings reports from IBM and several large oil
companies.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average lost 3.36 to 6,090.87.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 11-to-9 margin,
with volume totaling 414.62 million shares, down from 467.94
million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
Other major stock indexes also retreated today.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell 0.97 to 709.85, and
the NYSE's composite index fell 0.40 to 377.92.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index fell 6.08 to 1,236.40, and the
American Stock Exchange's market value index fell 2.16 to 576.87.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the blue-chip barometer surrendered a nearly 40-point
jump that put the Dow above 6,100 just a week after its first
close above 6,000. But it later lost 34 points at the attack of
profit-taking.
