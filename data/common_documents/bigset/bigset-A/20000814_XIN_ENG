<HEADLINE> China to Push Ahead Personnel System Reform of Institutions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The Organization Department of
the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and the
Ministry of Personnel have jointly issued a document concerning
the speeding up of personnel system reform in institutions
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The document said that it is an urgent task to push ahead the
personnel system reform at institutions, catering to the
requirement of building the socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
The document said the administrative ranks of officials at the
institutions should be phased out gradually and staff members at
the institutions will no longer be paid or receive other benefits
according to their administrative ranks.
</P>
<P>
It called for building personnel systems that take into
consideration the characteristics of the various institutions. A
contractual system should be promoted in all institutions where
officials will no longer get a permanent post.
</P>
<P>
Institutions should be allowed to remove their staff members
from their posts according to contracts and staff members can also
quit their posts according to contracts as well.
</P>
<P>
A competition mechanism should be introduced in determining
leaders of the institutions, the document said.
</P>
<P>
The document also called for the establishment of a public
hiring and examination system for staff members who want to work
for an institution and determine where they might work.
</P>
<P>
Staff members at institutions are to be paid according to their
achievement and outstanding personnel will receive higher salaries.
</P>
<P>
Those who fail to be re-employed at their institutions are
encouraged to seek jobs at newly established business ventures
started by the institution, receive more training or go to
grassroots units.

<HEADLINE> Japanese PM's Visit to Bangladesh is Uncertain: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro
Mori's much-expected visit to Bangladesh has become uncertain,
the official Bangladesh News Agency reported Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a highly placed official as saying that the
visit was to take place on August 19 but now it is "unlikely."
</P>
<P>
This uncertainty is due to the country's current flood
situation and affliction of a large number of people by dengue
virus, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 20 percent land of the country is under flood waters. It
is feared that the intensity of the flood might increase in the
coming days as the forecast says there will be more rainfall.
</P>
<P>
A source at Dengue Control Room here said that during the last
24 hours ending 3 p.m. Sunday, 55 new patients were admitted to
different hospitals in the country, raising the number of people
afflicted by the disease to 1,540. With no death reported in the
last 24 hours, the toll remained at 27.
</P>
<P>
In the prevailing situation, the government of the country is
in doubt about giving proper welcome to Prime Minister Yoshiro
Mori, the official said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Official Visits Turkey on Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Assistant Secretary of State
for Middle East Affairs Edward Walker arrived here Monday for a
two-day visit aimed at seeking Ankara's support for the Israeli-
Palestinian peace talks, Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Prior to a meeting with his Turkish counterpart Ugur Ziyal,
Walker said that U.S. President Bill Clinton was especially
interested in the opinions of Turkey, an important country and the
U.S. ally in the region.
</P>
<P>
Walker said that he would inform Clinton of the results of his
ongoing tour to the Middle East countries, which was aimed at
rallying support to the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks which were
at a critical period.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem is expected to receive
Walker early on Tuesday, after which Walker will leave Turkey for
other Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has called on both Israel and the Palestinians not to
take unilateral actions that will harm the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
As envoy of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, Shlomo Ben-Ami,
Israeli public security minister and acting foreign minister, paid
a one-day visit to Ankara last Thursday, informing Turkish leaders
of the developments after the failed Camp David peace summit.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Turkish officials told Ben-Ami that Ankara
wants the two sides to sort out their disputes through U.S.
mediation, without taking any "unilateral" action to deride the
current peace process.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Ami's visit was viewed as a counter-measure against
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's previous visit to Turkey in a
bid to seek Ankara's support for his unilateral declaration of the
Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Arafat urged Muslim Turkey to play a more
active role in the Mideast peace process, especially in the talks
with Israel over the fate of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Ottoman Turks had ruled Jerusalem, as well as the rest of
the Middle East, for 400 years until early 20th century.
</P>
<P>
Turkish leaders assured Arafat that they would stress Ankara's
sensitivity over the Jerusalem issue, but they made no clear
support for Arafat's decision to unilaterally declare a Palestinian
state on September 13.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Israel was satisfied with Ankara's moderate
advice to Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Ankara is not eager to get involved in the Mideast peace because
it faces a dilemma between its Muslim brother Palestine and its
Mideast ally Israel.
</P>
<P>
In a recent statement, however, the Foreign Ministry said that
Turkey would seriously consider ways to contribute positively to
the peace process which is vital for the stability and prosperity
of the region.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that Turkey is trying to pursue a balanced
position in the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
When the Middle East peace process was launched in Madrid,
Spain, in 1991, Turkey allowed the Palestine Liberation
Organization (PLO) Office in Ankara to be turned into an embassy.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Turkey has formed close military, political
and economic ties with Israel in order to contain their common
rivals Syria and Iran in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Turkey was one of the first Muslim countries to recognize Israel
in 1948, but lowered its level of diplomatic representation to
charge d'affaires in Tel Aviv in 1981 when Israel declared
Jerusalem as its "eternal" capital. It also closed its consulate-
general in Arab East Jerusalem as well.
</P>
<P>
But Turkey reciprocally upgraded its diplomatic relations with
Israel to the level of ambassador in 1991 when it turned the PLO
Office in Ankara into an embassy.

<HEADLINE> Iran Calls for More OIC Support for Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Hamid Reza Asefi hereon Monday called on the Organization of the
Islamic Conference (OIC) to make more efforts to help the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Given the current sensitive situation, Iran deems it necessary
for the OIC to support the Palestinians, Asefi was quoted by the
Islamic Republic News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the recent developments in the Middle East, especially
the failure of the U.S.-mediated Camp David talks, has made the
situation sensitive, which has intensified the "hopes and fears."
</P>
<P>
Islamic states should strengthen their solidarity and unity with
regard to the Palestinian issue, he added.
</P>
<P>
Iran, currently holding the presidency of the 55-member OIC, has
recently launched an initiative to mobilize Islamic support for
Palestine.
</P>
<P>
President Khatami has sent Deputy Foreign Minister for Arab and
African Affairs Mohammad Sadr as his envoy to deliver his messages
to the leaders of Jordan, Tunisia, Syria, Lebanon and Saudi Arabia
on
the Palestinian issue.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi earlier also made
telephone contacts with a number of Islamic foreign ministers on
the Middle East issue.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat last Thursday paid a short
visit to Iran, and Iran pledged to do its best to help solve the
Middle East problem.
</P>
<P>
Iran does not recognize Israel and has bitterly opposed to any
peace talks with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Iran insists that Jerusalem belongs to the Palestinians and the
whole Islamic world, and the only solution to the Middle East issue
is
Israel's unconditional withdrawal from Arab lands and the return of
Palestinian refugees to their homelands.

CAIRO, August 14 (Xinhua) -- An Egyptian secondary school
student has committed suicide due to failure to pass the

return to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The examinations for a secondary education certificate are vital
for the students to obtain good chances to go to university and
have a bright future.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Reformists Form Fraction in Majlis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Iranian reformist legislators on
Monday evening officially formed a reformist fraction inside the
reformist-dominated Majlis (parliament) to push forward the reforms
advocated by President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Some 120 lawmakers from the 290-seat Majlis attended a meeting
of the reformist coalition of "May 23 Front" and elected the
radical-turned reformist lawmaker Ali Akbar Mohtashamipour to head
the front's legislators in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Mohtashamipour, a cleric who served as interior minister in
1985-1989, was elected into the Majlis in June in a runoff in the
Tehran constituency.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also elected Ali Shakourirad and Abolqassem
Sarhadizadeh as Mohtashamipour's deputies, both from the reformist
party of Iran Islamic Participation Front headed by Khatami's
brother Mohammad Reza Khatami, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
So far some 180 Majlis deputies have filled up registration
forms of the "May 23 Front" while some 30 others are expected to do
the same soon, the agency quoted Reza Yousofian, a member of the
front from Shiraz southern Fars province, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Yousofian said the fraction of the "May 23 Front" in the
Majlis has decided to form a seven-member presiding board and four
members of the board will be elected later on.
</P>
<P>
The "May 23 Front" was formed to mark the unexpected victory of
President Khatami in the 1997 presidential elections and was named
after the date of the elections.
</P>
<P>
The front, which comprises 18 pro-reformist political parties
and groups, won more than two-thirds of seats in the Majlis in the
February parliamentary elections, dealing a serious blow on the
powerful conservatives.
</P>
<P>
However, some reports said the front might face some splits
between different groups due to their different views and under the
pressure of the conservatives, who still control the country's
major state organs such as the judiciary and the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the formation of the front's fraction in the
Majlis was aimed at improving coordination inside the front to
prevent sharp differences.
</P>
<P>
Some observers believed the front's fraction inside the Majlis
will also be able to help President Khatami win his reelection
in the next year's presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Khatami announced his readiness to run for another
term to carry out his reformist programs and reformist papers have
urged the reformists to be united to support Khatami in the
elections.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Business Inventories Rise 0.9 Percent in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. companies increased
their inventories by 0.9 percent in June to a seasonally adjusted
rate of 1.19 trillion U.S. dollars, the Commerce Department
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
June's overall increase was unchanged from the revised May
figure of 0.9 percent, which earlier had been estimated at 0.8
percent, the fastest pace in six months.
</P>
<P>
Stocks of oil and oil products, which saw a price spike this
summer, soared 4.7 percent while drug inventories rose 3.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Business sales jumped 0.9 percent to 904.2 billion dollars in
June, with oil and oil products, electrical goods, motor vehicles,
automotive equipment and beer, wine and alcoholic beverages
leading the way. The June sales increase slowed from a 1.1 percent
jump in May.
</P>
<P>
Year on year, inventories were up 6.8 percent, while sales were
up 8.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The June rise in sales left the inventory-to-sales ratio
unchanged but near a record low. The ratio stood at 1.32 in June,
meaning it would take 1.32 months to use up inventories at the
June sales pace. The ratio, which hit a record low of 1.31 months
in March, was unchanged in June from May and down from 1.34 in
June 1999.
</P>
<P>
On the inventory front, retailers posted the biggest gain in
June, as they had in May. They boosted inventories by 1.2 percent
to 387.2 billion dollars. In May, retailers' inventories jumped by
1.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Despite the big increase in inventories, retailers' sales grew
by a modest 0.4 percent in June to 268.5 billion dollars. Sales
inched up 0.1 percent in May.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Proposes to Guyana to Settle Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez
proposed his Guyanese counterpart, Bharrat Jagdeo, to look for a
solution to the territorial dispute over the Esequibo region.
</P>
<P>
In a letter released to the press Monday, Chavez proposed to
Jagdeo a separate meeting during the Summit of South American
Heads of State, to take place from August 31 to September 1 in
Brasilia.
</P>
<P>
The Esequibo dispute between Venezuela and Guyana dates back
100 years. The region extends on a 150,000 square kilometer
surface and lies between both countries. It has a wealth in
natural resources and oil reserves.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan leader said he is ready to pay a visit to Guyana
and that details over it could be arranged in Brasilia.
</P>
<P>
Chavez told Jagdeo that the recent elections in Venezuela are
the culmination of a revolutionary political process and that the
country requires its diverse long-term problems to be solved.
</P>
<P>
The territorial dispute became once again news when Chavez said
Guyana authorized a United States company to build a satellite
launching base in Esequibo.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Not Welcome in Colombia: Rebel FARC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The rebel Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia (FARC) said U.S. President Bill Clinton is not
welcome in Colombia, referring to his next visit to the South
American country on August 30.
</P>
<P>
"Clinton brings with him enough dollars for Colombians to keep
on killing each other indefinitely," said Alfonso Cano, FARC
ideologist in an interview to the Internet magazine "Semana"
published Monday.
</P>
<P>
The United States is searching to progressively increase his
military participation in Colombia's internal affairs. That is why
the U.S. president is not welcome, said the guerrilla leader.
</P>
<P>
The Colombian leader considers Clinton's first visit as the
United States' support for President Pastrana's "Plan of Colombia"
aimed at controlling drugs trafficking, peace and development in
the South American country.
</P>
<P>
The Plan of Colombia channels resources amounting to 7.5
billion U.S. dollars, out of which 1.3 billion dollars will be
provided by the United States.
</P>
<P>
Senior U.S. officials, like Under Secretary of State for
Political Affairs Thomas Pickering and National Anti Drugs Policy
head General Barry McCaffrey, met Colombian leaders last Thursday
in Cartagena, capital of the state of Bolivar, to prepare for
Clinton's visit.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese President Vows to Fight for Territorial Integrity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese President Omar Hassan
Ahmed el-Bashir vowed on Monday to fight against the rebels in the
south of his country in an effort to maintain territorial
integrity, said a report reaching here.
</P>
<P>
"No matter how long it might take, we will continue to fight the
war with the rebels so long as they are still reluctant to agree to
peaceful settlement," el-Bashir said in an interview with the
Egyptian television in Khartoum.
</P>
<P>
"We are determined not to allow our country to be divided," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Sudan Liberation Army (SPLA), the major rebel group, took up
arms in 1983 in an attempt to gain greater autonomy from the Muslim
government in Khartoum for the mostly Christian and animist south.
The endless war and war-related famine have left millions dead and
displaced.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government and the SPLA have held several rounds of
talks under the auspices of the Inter-Governmental Development
Authority, or IGAD, grouping Eastern African countries, to seek
political solutions. But so far, little has been achieved.
</P>
<P>
El-Bashir pledged that once conflicts are resolved peacefully,
every citizen in the south will have the right to enjoy full
political and civilian rights.
</P>
<P>
But, meanwhile, he stressed that religion will not be separated
from state affairs, referring to the fact that Islamic laws form
the basis of Sudan's politics.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese leader spoke highly of the efforts exerted by Egypt
to help Sudan realize peace and national reconciliation by
initiating a peace proposal last year to bring Sudan's political
forces together to seek political settlement for the armed and
political conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's support for the Sudanese peace process will promote the
country's efforts to maintain internal stability which is key to
the development of national economy, he added.

Road accidents are common in Egypt due to high speed and
negligence of traffic rules. Official reports say that about 3,000
people die in traffic accidents each year.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Vice President Pledges to Work for Cyprus Solution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Vice President Al Gore has
pledged to continue working for a just and lasting solution to the
Cyprus issue and expressed support for the U.N.-led efforts toward
a comprehensive settlement.
</P>
<P>
Gore, the Democratic presidential candidate, made the remarks at
a questionnaire by the American Hellenic Institute (AHI) on the
Greek-Turkish relations and Cyprus, Cyprus News Agency reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Expressing support for the current Cyprus talks under U.N.
auspices, Gore said he remains "deeply engaged" and if elected U.S.
president, he will redouble his efforts to find a peaceful solution
to the Cyprus issue and other disputes in accordance with
international law.
</P>
<P>
He noted the U.S. administration is working hard to build on the
hopeful developments between Greece and Turkey to make progress in
the Aegean Sea and on Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
"I am fully committed to this process and to reaching a just and
lasting solution to the Cyprus dispute which permits all Cypriots
to live in security," Gore said.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus issue has remained unsolved since 1974 when the
island was divided after Turkey sent troops and took over the
northern third of the island in the wake of a failed coup seeking
union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-sponsored proximity talks to reach a settlement in
Cyprus have already been held in December last year as well as in
February and July of this year. A fourth round is to begin on
September 12 in New York.
</P>
<P>
Gore noted tensions in Cyprus, Greek-Turkish disagreements in
the Aegean, and Turkey's relationship with the European Union have
serious implications for the regional stability and the evolution
of European political and security structures.
</P>
<P>
"Our goal should be to stabilize the region by reducing long-
standing Greek-Turkish tensions and pursuing a comprehensive
settlement on Cyprus," he concluded.
</P>
<P>
Nicholas Chimicles, president of the AHI Public Affairs
Committee, welcomed Gore's committment to the search for a
settlement of the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
He regretted, however, that Gore's statement is very general and
it does not provide specific answers to the questions posed in the
questionnaire.

<HEADLINE> Survey: One Third of Swiss Overweight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Nearly a third of Swiss are
overweight, and pay little attention to their diet, according to a
new survey made public Monday by the Federal Health Office.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that up to 30 percent of Swiss people over
the age of 15 are lacking a healthy diet. A fifth said they do not
eat salad and vegetables on a daily basis, while 30 percent
admitted to not consuming fruit every day.
</P>
<P>
More men were found to be overweight than are women, although
roughly equivalent numbers of both sexes were classified as obese.
The worst affected age group was between 50 and 64.
</P>
<P>
The study also found that over 4 percent of the population is
underweight. Women are worst affected: 6.8 percent are below their
ideal body weight compared to only 1.6 percent of men.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Health Office concluded that diets were worst among
people with low levels of education. From a geographical
perspective, it said the French-speaking Swiss have a less
balanced diet than their counterparts in the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
Excessive alcohol consumption was found to be less of a problem
with 3.8 percent of the population reporting that they regularly
drink alcohol twice a day.
</P>
<P>
Those found to be overweight had a body mass index (BMI) of
between 25 and 29.9. The BMI is an internationally recognized
measurement based on the relationship between the height and body
weight. Those with a BMI above 30 are classed as obese.

<HEADLINE> Ratings Affirmed For AIG Finance (HK) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Fitch, the international rating
agency, Monday affirmed its "AA" Long-term local currency rating
for AIG Finance (HK) Limited, a restricted license bank.
</P>
<P>
The agency said on the back of the economic recovery in Hong
Kong since the last quarter of 1999, unemployment has begun to
fall and domestic consumption shows signs of improvement.
</P>
<P>
This has brought about a more favorable operating environment
for Hong Kong's financial institutions whose weakened asset
quality has begun to improve, it added.
</P>
<P>
Driven by an improvement in operating expenses and portfolio
quality, AIG Finance (HK) Limited's performance in 1999 registered
a healthy rebound.
</P>
<P>
Net income rose by more than 38 percent, and asset quality
remains sound as indicated by the ratio of non-accrual loans to
total loans which was maintained at 5.04 percent at year-end 1999,
according to the announcement.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the rating affirmation, City economists said it
reflects the bank's consistently strong capital position and good
asset quality.
</P>
<P>
However, the bank will continue to face keen competition in the
Hong Kong market, and profitability may yet see some effects from
the current mortgage loan price war, they added.

<HEADLINE> Rescue Efforts Continue for Sunken Russian Submarine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The Russian military continued
its efforts Monday to rescue a nuclear submarine that sank to the
bottom of the Barents Sea during a training mission Sunday.
</P>
<P>
President Vladimir Putin has been kept informed about the
progress of the rescue operation, Russian media reported.
</P>
<P>
The multipurpose "Kursk" failed to respond to radio signals at
a predetermined time, but communications with crew members were re-
established later.
</P>
<P>
The submarine's atomic power plant has been taken off line and
is under control with radiation at normal levels, the Navy press
service said.
</P>
<P>
According to the independent NTV channel, there are no lights
aboard the submarine and there could be problems with air supply
following the shutdown of the nuclear power reactors.
</P>
<P>
It was not clear what caused the submarine to be sunken aside
from the earlier version of "technical problem," but the Itar-Tass
news agency, quoting a Northern Fleet source, said it could be a
result of a collision with a foreign submarine.
</P>
<P>
Tass quoted another military source as saying that the crisis "
developed instantly" and that the sailors had no time to even
float a rescue buoy. The place of the incident was found by a Navy
rescue ship.
</P>
<P>
"Kursk" remains on the Barents Sea floor, where the sea is
about 100 meters deep. Three submarines and five submersible
attack vessels have come to its rescue.
</P>
<P>
A decision on how Kursk, or its crew, will be lifted is likely
to be taken later Monday or in the early hours of Tuesday,
Interfax said, citing the press service of the Northern Fleet.
</P>
<P>
An aircraft carrier, the Admiral Kuznetsov, has dropped anchor
at the site of the accident. Its deck is being used as a landing
site for rescue helicopters that are monitoring the area.
</P>
<P>
More rescue vessels are expected to arrive at the place of the
accident, the press service said.
</P>
<P>
The weather is good for rescue operations, but the underwater
currents are very strong, which may complicate rescue operations,
the service said.
</P>
<P>
The submarine was commissioned for the Russian Navy in 1995. It
has a displacement of 14,700-23,860 tons and can dive to depths of
up to 500 meters. The submarine is armed with torpedoes and "
Granite" cruise missiles. The vessel can operate autonomously for
up to 120 days and carries a 107-man crew, including 52 officers,
the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Northern Fleet started its routine exercises last
Thursday aimed at improving cooperation between the ships of the
versatile aircraft carrier group and other forces of the fleet,
Russian media reported.
</P>
<P>
The maneuvers, which involved 20 warships, submarines and
auxiliary vessels and 10 coast units, were scheduled to end Sunday.

<HEADLINE> India Rejects Pakistani Statement On Possible Nuclear War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 14 (Xinhua) -- India Monday categorically
rejected Pakistan's contention that a conflict between the two
countries could lead to a full-scale nuclear war and asserted that
such "needlessly alarmist" statement by Pakistani leaders were not
helpful for confidence-building, the Press Trust of India (PTI)
reported.
</P>
<P>
"India categorically rejects the thesis as also the supposition
on which it is based," an Indian foreign office spokesman was
quoted as saying in response to questions on remarks by Pakistan
Foreign Minister Abdul Sattar.
</P>
<P>
Sattar had reportedly stated that "both Pakistan and India
possess nuclear capabilities and a conflict between the two
countries can erupt into a complete war, in which the nuclear
weapons may be used".
</P>
<P>
"We do not share the assessment about the possibility or
imminence of a nuclear war. We believe that it is not helpful for
confidence-building and overall peace and security for countries
with nuclear weapons to make statements about their possible use,"
said the Indian spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The reported statement of the Pakistan foreign minister were "
needlessly alarmist" and were "designed to heighten anxiety", he
added.

<HEADLINE> Indian President Bombards Crimes Against Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Indian President K R Narayanan
on Monday made a strong plea for rewriting laws so that there was
a deterrent against crimes against women as "neither conscience
nor common sense is responding to this tragic problem".
</P>
<P>
"Our women are still treated as less than human. Day in and day
out, we read in the newspapers gruesome stories of dowry deaths of
young women in the flower of their youth, because of the
insatiable greed of husbands and the in-laws," said the President
in an address to the nation on the eve of India's Independence Day,
which falls on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Criticizing the law enforcing agencies and the inadequacy of
the laws, Narayanan said that the law enforcing agencies remain
indifferent or ineffective, and the law itself remains awfully
inadequate.
</P>
<P>
"In fact statistics show that crimes against women have been on
the increase. No place is safe for them, not even their own homes,
" he noted.
</P>
<P>
The land of India today is soaked by the tears of women in
general, and even girl children, who are ill-treated and murdered,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Besides this, Narayanan said there has been a resurgence of old
superstitions and outmoded social practices retarding the progress
of society along modern lines.
</P>
<P>
"Today child marriages are common in some states of India and
are celebrated openly with impunity, receiving publicity in the
sensation-crazy sections of our media," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the international front, the Indian President said that
India wished to be friends and live in peaceful co-existence with
all nations of the world, more especially with neighbors.
</P>
<P>
"At the same time we will have to be prepared to defend the
unity and integrity of our nation and the safety and prosperity of
our people," he added.

<HEADLINE> 10 Injured in Kashmir Grenade Blast, Militants Set Precondition For Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Militants hurled a powerful
grenade at a security patrol which missed its target and exploded
on a road injuring at least 10 people in Pulwama district of
Kashmir on Monday, the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported.
</P>
<P>
The explosion triggered panic among residents of the area, but
no militant outfit has so far claimed responsibility for the blast,
the PTI quoted local official sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday, Hizbul Mujahideen, a major militant group in
Kashmir, said peace talks with New Delhi could be resumed only
after India accepts Jammu and Kashmir as a disputed territory and
involves Pakistan in the peace talks, the PTI reported.
</P>
<P>
"If India is serious to resolve Kashmir issue and interested in
ending the untold miseries people of Jammu and Kashmir have been
put to, she should accept the disputed status of the state and
accept Pakistan as a party to the issue," a statement released by
the outfit to the local press in Kashmir said.
</P>
<P>
Once India accepts "these hard facts" a solution to the Kashmir
issue will not be far away, the statement added.

ISLAMABAD, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations has given
Afghanistan's Ariana airlines permission to fly 135 sick children
to Germany for treatment, news reaching here said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council agreed to make an exception to the
sanctions, which were imposed last November and banned
international flight of Afghan aircrafts, for the ailing children,
Afghan Taliban's Foreign Minister Wakil Ahmed Muttawakil told a

according to Ariana chief Mulla Hamidullah.
</P>
<P>
He said the Ariana flight will return on Sunday.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Security Council Paves Way for Creation of Special Court for Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Monday unanimously adopted a resolution to pave the way for the
establishment of a special court to try rebel leader Foday Sankoh
and his followers in Sierra Leone, who launched war and attacked U.
N. peacekeepers, for war crimes.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, recognizing "the particular circumstances of
Sierra Leone," said, "A credible system of justice and
accountability for the very serious crimes committed there would
end impunity and would contribute to the process of national
reconciliation and to the restoration and maintenance of peace."
</P>
<P>
The resolution asked U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to enter
into an agreement with the Sierra Leonean Government to create an
independent special court prosecute crimes against humanity, war
crimes and other serious violations of both international and
Sierra Leonean laws.
</P>
<P>
The resolution also asked Annan to suggest a possible
alternative host country for the court if it cannot be located in
Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council underlined "the importance of ensuring the
impartiality, independence and credibility of the process, in
particular with regard to the status of the judges and the
prosecutors," the resolution said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council requested Annan to submit a report, within
30 days, to the 15-nation body on the implementation of the
resolution, particularly on his consultations and negotiations
with the government of Sierra Leone on the special court.
</P>
<P>
The rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF), led by Sankoh,
violated a peace accord signed by rebels and the government in
Togo in July last year by taking more than 500 U.N. soldiers
hostage and surrounding 223 others for more than two months in the
eastern part of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Captured in May, Sankoh is currently in the government custody
in Freetown, capital of Sierra Leone, and he is likely to be one
of the first rebels brought to trial before the special court.
</P>
<P>
In a report to the Security Council, Annan said that the RUF
still poses a threat to the peace process in the war-torn African
nation.
</P>
<P>
In response, the 15-nation body adopted a resolution on August
4, giving the U.N. peacekeepers in Sierra Leone a tougher mandate
to deal with rebels violating the peace accord. The U.N.
peacekeeping force, known as the UNAMSIL, was sent into Sierra
Leone to monitor the peace accord, which was intended to end the
bloody civil war.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. force is due to "deter, and where necessary,
decisively counter the threat of RUF attack by responding robustly
to any hostile actions" or threat of imminent use of force, said
the resolution, which, however, said attacks on the UNAMSIL by the
RUF rebels had "revealed serious inherent weakness in the mission'
s structure, command and control and resources."

Monday unanimously adopted a resolution to pave the way for the
establishment of a special court to try rebel leader Foday Sankoh
and his followers in Sierra Leone, who launched war and attacked U.
N. peacekeepers, for war crimes.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, recognizing "the particular circumstances of
Sierra Leone," said, "A credible system of justice and
accountability for the very serious crimes committed there would
end impunity and would contribute to the process of national
reconciliation and to the restoration and maintenance of peace."
</P>
<P>
The resolution asked U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to enter
into an agreement with the Sierra Leonean government to create an
independent special court prosecute crimes against humanity, war
crimes and other serious violations of both international and
Sierra Leonean laws.
</P>
<P>
The resolution also asked Annan to suggest a possible
alternative host country for the court if it cannot be located in
Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The resolution endorsed a request from the Sierra Leonean
government for the United Nations to help in setting up a special
court to try those charged with war crimes and crimes against
humanity. However, the resolution did not name any group or person
suspected of such crimes.
</P>
<P>
But diplomats here said it opened the way for the prosecution
of Sankoh and his closest lieutenants.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council underlined "the importance of ensuring the
impartiality, independence and credibility of the process, in
particular with regard to the status of the judges and the
prosecutors," the resolution said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council requested Annan to submit a report, within
30 days, to the 15-nation body on the implementation of the
resolution, particularly on his consultations and negotiations
with the government of Sierra Leone on the special court.
</P>
<P>
The rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF), led by Sankoh,
violated a peace accord signed by rebels and the government in
Togo in July last year by taking more than 500 U.N. soldiers
hostage and surrounding 223 others for more than two months in the
eastern part of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Captured in May, Sankoh is currently in the government custody
in Freetown, capital of Sierra Leone, and he is likely to be one
of the first rebels brought to trial before the special court.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh, who received a blanket amnesty for war crimes under the
July 7, 1999 peace accord. The Security Council resolution said
that the United Nations did not accept the amnesty applied to
genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and other serious
violations of humanitarian law.
</P>
<P>
In a report to the Security Council, Annan said that the RUF
still poses a threat to the peace process in the war-torn African
nation.
</P>
<P>
In response, the 15-nation body adopted a resolution on August
4, giving the U.N. peacekeepers in Sierra Leone a tougher mandate
to deal with rebels violating the peace accord. The U.N.
peacekeeping force, known as the UNAMSIL, was sent into Sierra
Leone to monitor the peace accord, which was intended to end the
bloody civil war.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. force is due to "deter, and where necessary,
decisively counter the threat of RUF attack by responding robustly
to any hostile actions" or threat of imminent use of force, said
the resolution, which, however, said attacks on the UNAMSIL by the
RUF rebels had "revealed serious inherent weakness in the mission'
s structure, command and control and resources."

<HEADLINE> Honda Production Boosts UK Car Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Britain's car firms are rejoicing
after Japanese car giant Honda unveiled plans to double its UK car
production.
</P>
<P>
The company, which is Japan's third largest car maker, has
decided recently that it will shift the entire production of its
new three-door Civic model to its Swindon plant next year.
</P>
<P>
Honda said that because the yen has not proved as weak against
the pound as the euro, it will export around 10,000 Civic cars a
year from its Wiltshire factory back to Japan -- the first time
Honda cars manufactured in Britain have been exported back to the
country.
</P>
<P>
The news comes after warnings from car makers like Toyota,
Nissan and Matsushita that they may move production to the
continent if Britain does not adopt the European single currency.
</P>
<P>
However, Honda's decision suggests that not all companies are
finding the going difficult. Its announcement coincided with an
opinion poll conducted by BBC Radio 4, showing that two-thirds of
British people now believed that joining the euro would be bad for
Britain.

<HEADLINE> China's First High-Definition TV Network Opens in Shenzhen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, August 14 (Xinhua) -- China's first wide-band high-
definition cable television network opened in Shenzhen today,
attracting large groups of local residents who came to watch TV
programs broadcast by the network at a big electric appliance
store this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The digital cable television system, which was produced by the
Shenzhen Skyworth Group, includes high-definition TV terminals and
equipment for making programs, transmitting and modulating at TV
stations.
</P>
<P>
The State Development Planning Commission has already granted
24 million yuan (about 2.9 million U.S. dollars) to support the
construction of the digital TV station in Shenzhen and will invest
another 10 million yuan (about 1.2 million US dollars) to promote
the research and production of chips for digital TV.
</P>
<P>
There are currently more than 300 million TV users in China,
and 81 million of them are receiving cable TV programs.
</P>
<P>
To broadcast high-definition TV programs through satellite and
cable TV networks and then put high-definition TV terminals at low
and middle levels into the market is a way to speed up the
development of the national electronics industry, said Du Baichuan,
vice-president of the Chinese Academy of Broadcasting Science.
</P>
<P>
The popularization of digital television in Shenzhen will
become a new economic growth point for the city over the next five
years, said an official with the municipal government. It was
estimated that the sales volume of digital television in the city
will reach 100 billion yuan (about 12 billion US dollars) if 15
percent of the local families buy digital televisions.
</P>
<P>
A 32" high-definition television produced by the Skyworth Group,
which was shown at the store, will be sold at 15,000 yuan with an
additional 4,999 yuan for some key fittings.
</P>
<P>
The Skyworth Group, one of the four major color television
manufacturers in China, has an annual sales volume of 5 billion
yuan (about 600 million U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Ban on Several Iranian Papers to be Lifted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Iran's First Deputy Judiciary
Chief Hadi Marvi stated on Monday that the temporary ban on several
papers would be lifted in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Talks have been held with head of Tehran Justice Department Ali
Alizadeh and he promised to lift the temporary ban on several
papers on which investigations have been completed, Marvi said in
an interview with the official Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA).
</P>
<P>
However, he did not mention the names and the number of the
papers to be freed.
</P>
<P>
Iran's conservative-dominated Judiciary temporarily closed down
22 newspapers and journals, mostly reformist, in a wholesale
crackdown on the reformist allies of President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
At present only two major reformist newspapers, Iran, published
by the IRNA, and Hamshahri (Citizen), published by the Tehran
municipality, escaped the wholesale crackdown.
</P>
<P>
Along with the closure of reformist papers, a dozen of reporters
and writers had been also summoned to court or put into prison on
various charges.
</P>
<P>
Marvi said that Judiciary Chief Ayatollah Hashemi Shahroudi does
not favor the current process of banning papers and has underlined
the need to lift the temporary ban on papers on which preliminary
examinations have ended.
</P>
<P>
The judiciary does not agree with the current bans on the
papers, he said, the judges issued the rulings for ban in
accordance with the press law while other judges have a different
interpretation on the ban orders.
</P>
<P>
He also denied the rumors that arrest warrants would be issued
gradually for a list of 100 journalists.
</P>
<P>
The powerful conservatives passed a strict press law amendment
in April before handing over the Majlis (parliament) to the
reformists who won a landslide victory in the February
parliamentary polls.
</P>
<P>
After taking over the Majlis in May, the reformists vowed to
offer more freedom to the press and to uphold freedom of
expression.
</P>
<P>
However, Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei last week
ordered the reformist-dominated Majlis to withdraw a reformist bill
to amend the press law.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei said that the debate on the bill to amend the press law
is against the national interest, stressing that the present press
law can prevent foreign elements from infiltrating into the
country's press corps.

<HEADLINE> Khatami: No Military Solution to Afghan Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
underlined on Monday there is no military solution to the Afghan
issue and the only way out is to accept the right of the Afghan
people to choose their own destiny.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Francesco Vendrell, special envoy of U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Afghanistan, Khatami said the
displacement and killing of the oppressed people of Afghanistan
stem from conflicts in that country.
</P>
<P>
He said the lack of a representative and stable government in
Afghanistan has created difficulties not only for the Afghan people
but also for the region. Iran has suffered much from the tragedy
due to the production and trafficking of narcotics in Afghanistan,
he added.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president expressed hope that through the
cooperation offered by the U.N., the cause root of corruption in
Afghanistan will be eradicated.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Iran's efforts to solve the Afghan issue, he said
Iran has tried to take steps in removing the problems of
Afghanistan, although such efforts have met obstacles due to
warmongering and illogical attitudes of some groups.
</P>
<P>
Khatami noted Iran has held consultations with neighboring
countries, the U.N., the Organization of the Islamic Conference
(OIC) and the Group of 6+2 formed by the United States, Russia and
the six neighbors of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"Our religious, national and humane duty demands our
intervention for the good of the great nation of Afghanistan which
has been entangled in atrocities and backwardness," he added.
</P>
<P>
Vendrell, who arrived here on Saturday, briefed Khatami on the
latest developments in the region, particularly the Afghan crisis,
saying negotiation is the only way of achieving peace and
understanding in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the conflicts will come to an end during
his tenure and through his contacts with Afghan groups,
Afghanistan's neighbors and international organizations, peace will
be restored to that country.
</P>
<P>
International organizations and rich countries can help in the
reconstruction programs in Afghanistan provided peace is
established in that country, he said.

<HEADLINE> EU to Probe Proposed Nuclear Joint Venture Against Monopoly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) said
Monday it has decided to undertake an in-depth investigation into
a proposed joint venture which it fears could monopolize certain
nuclear technology markets in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the EU's anti-trust watchdog, said
the proposed joint venture between French companies Framatome SA
and Cogema SA, and Germany's Siemens AG, raises serious doubts
about its compatibility with the EU common market for its "strong
positions on certain nuclear technology markets".
</P>
<P>
It said available information showed the joint venture,
combining the nuclear technology advantages boasted by the three
companies, could impact on Europe's nuclear technology markets by
monopolizing the design and manufacture of fuel assemblies,
instrumentation and control systems, and the replacement and
installation of nuclear power plant components.
</P>
<P>
The EU investigation, in its second phase, is expected to take
four months.

<TEXT>
<P>
An overall plan for western region development has been listed
in the country's Tenth Five-Year Plan (2001-2005) for National
Economic and Social Development.
</P>
<P>
At present, various provinces and autonomous regions in the
west and departments of the State Council are drafting development
plans for each locality and trade.
</P>
<P>
China will inject an estimated 32.6 billion yuan (3.93 billion
U.S. dollars) into the construction of 78 large and medium-sized
basic projects in the west this year. Focus will be put on ten
major projects.
</P>
<P>
Efforts will also be made to speed up the work for such major
projects as a west-to-east natural gas transmission, a west-to-
east electricity transmission, and a railway stretching to the
Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Li said that emphasis on environmental protection will be put
on returning farmland to forests and grasslands, protecting
natural forest resources, preventing and controlling
desertification, and carrying out a water and soil conservation
project in the west.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that to implement the western region development
program it is necessary to consolidate and strengthen the status
of agriculture as the foundation of China's economy and develop
agriculture and rural economy in the western regions.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of the year, west China saw a major
improvement in economic growth. Its GDP and consumption rose

<HEADLINE> Policy of Peaceful Reunification, One Country and Two Systems Remains Unchanged: President Jiang (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIDAIHE, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The policy of "peaceful
reunification and one country, two systems" remains unchanged,
however, the one-China principle is the prerequisite and basis for
resuming cross-straits dialog and negotiations.
</P>
<P>
As long as the Taiwan authorities recognize the one-China
principle, cross-straits dialog can be resumed, and everything can
be discussed, said Chinese President Jiang Zemin in a meeting
today with Bill Archer, member of the U.S. House of
Representatives and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee,
at the seaside resort of Beidaihe, about 300 kilometers east of
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government has reiterated its adherence to the one-
China policy and observance to the three Sino-U.S. joint
communiques and relevant commitments, he said, noting that China
hopes that the U.S. government will take practical actions to
fulfill its commitments.
</P>
<P>
Calling Archer an old friend of the Chinese people, Jiang
praised his efforts to advance Sino-U.S. relations and push
forward the settlement of Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR)
with China at an early date in the U.S. House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
He said that bilateral relations have witnessed vicissitude
over the years, however, the main trend is one that is moving
forward. He added that historic facts prove that the stable and
smooth development of bilateral relations is not only beneficial
to both countries, but is also conducive to peace, stability and
development in the Asia-Pacific region and the world at large.
</P>
<P>
Maintaining a good bilateral relationship is the common
aspiration of the people of the two countries, he said.

All the far-sighted statesmen should see clearly and go along

a strategic perspective, Jiang said, adding that the U.S. congress
plays an important role in formulating domestic and foreign
policies, and China is willing to increase contact with U.S.
congressmen and personnel of other areas to push forward Sino-U.S.
relations.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Sino-U.S. agreement on China's entry to the
World Trade Organization, which was (WTO) signed last November,
provided new momentum for promoting bilateral economic and trade
cooperation. He added that the U.S. government is committed to
settling PNTR issue, and China hopes that such an issue will be
completely solved at an early date, thus creating favorable
conditions for expanding economic and trade cooperation as well as
improving and developing bilateral relations as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Archer said that both countries should develop their relations
from a long-term perspective, and he would like to make efforts to
promote bilateral relations. He said he understood China's stance
on the Taiwan issue, and the United States will continue to pursue
the one-China policy.

<HEADLINE> Four "Snakeheads" Caught in Chongqing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Border police in southwest
China's Chongqing City arrested four stowaway agents known as "
snakeheads" today and a number of stowaways at the city's Jiangbei
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
The four snakeheads, pretending to be relatives of high-ranking
officials, tried in vain to bribe the border police and build an "
illegal border crossing to Europe" at the airport, police sources
said.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing City opened an air route to Munich, Germany, in June
this year and it is the only air route to Europe in the western
part of China.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Xiaoyi, chief of staff of Chongqing Border Security Police
Bureau, said after the new air route became operational some
snakeheads tried to bribe border police and organize stowaways to
Europe.
</P>
<P>
Four days ago, the four snakeheads made phone calls to
Chongqing border police claiming to be relatives of high-ranking
officials from the Ministry of Public Security and a military area
command of the People's Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
They promised to pay 10 times the amount of the border
policeman's salary when each stowaway smoothly reached Munich and
they expected to build up a long-term relationship with the border
police.
</P>
<P>
The border policy pretended to agree with the idea in an effort
to catch all the members of the stowaway group. Later,
plainclothes police officers at the airport caught the four
snakeheads.
</P>
<P>
So far, Chongqing has opened air routes to Japan, the Republic
of Korea, Thailand and some other countries and the city's border
police have cracked seven stowaway cases involving 40 stowaways in
recent two years.

<HEADLINE> Production Accidents Kill 1,470 People in Yunnan in Six Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Accidents at factories and mines
claimed the lives of 1,470 people and wounded another 3,332 in
Yunnan Province, southwest China, in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
An official with the provincial safe production commission said
today that about 80 percent of the dead and wounded people were
farmer-turned factory workers or miners.
</P>
<P>
The farmer-turned factory workers or miners were the major
victims of the accidents, however, many of them were directly
responsible for the accidents, according to a provincial
government official.
</P>
<P>
Most of them do not have much training in the area of factory
work or mining and are not knowledgeable about the necessary
safety precautions to take while doing these jobs, said the
official.
</P>
<P>
As it is the case in other parts of the country, quite a number
of farmers with less education and temporary workers without
special training in Yunnan Province have been seeking jobs in
urban business ventures or township enterprises, with the
mushrooming of the non-public ownership economy.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate that nearly 60 percent of the accidents
taking place in the province and claiming people's lives in the
first half of this year were caused due to violations of operation
procedures and work disciplines.
</P>
<P>
The Yunnan provincial government has required all of the rural
mines and 52 fireworks factories to suspend production until the
problems hindering safe production are solved.

<HEADLINE> Barak Ordered to Explain Official's Dismissal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Israel's High Court Monday
ordered Prime Minister Ehud Barak to explain his reasons for
dismissing Foreign Ministry Director-General Eytan Bentsur, court
officials announced.
</P>
<P>
In the show-cause order, the High Court also stated that
Bentsur, a career diplomat who has worked in the ministry for 35
years, will remain at his jobs until further rulings.
</P>
<P>
Bentsur, along with four Israeli diplomats close to former
Foreign Minister David Levy, was sacked by Barak last Sunday after
the prime minister took the ministry under his own care. Bentsur
was later appointed Israeli ambassador to France.
</P>
<P>
Levy resigned August 2, because of his differences with Barak
over the approach in negotiations with the Palestinians over the
final-status issues.
</P>
<P>
His resignation and Bentsur's quick dismissal prompted many
analysts to judge Barak's move as a purge against Levy's
confidants, and led to an appeal to the High court by Israel's
Movement for Quality Government against Bentsur's sacking. In the
petition, the movement called the move "brutal and destructive."
</P>
<P>
To add a dramatic tint to the case, Israeli ambassador to France
Eliyahu Ben Elissar, who was also dismissed in the "purge," died of
heart failure in Paris on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In Monday's deliberation of the appeal, Supreme Court President
Aharon Barak reportedly said the prime minister should show his
reasons for the dismissal, as the matter is very serious.
</P>
<P>
To Barak's disadvantage, Bentsur argued in his affidavit to the
court that he was summarily fired by Barak because of his loyalty
to Levy.
</P>
<P>
It contradicted Barak's early affidavit, submitted by the state
attorney's office on behalf of the prime minister, which said that
Bentsur was not dismissed, but only "had completed a four-year
term" in the post.

During the telephone conversation initiated by Putin, the two

hold talks with Putin in a bid to win Russia's support for the
Palestinian position toward the peace talks, but Putin reportedly
cautioned him against making hasty decisions on declaring
statehood.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak and Putin stressed the importance of continuing efforts
to help achieve a just and permanent peace based on international
legitimacy resolutions for the peoples in the region to enjoy
genuine stability, el-Sharif said.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian leader said on Sunday the Palestinians can delay
declaring statehood beyond their self-imposed deadline of September
13 for a final peace accord with Israel.

MANILA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Philippine legislators have
approved a bill to benefit the country's thousands of school
teachers and employees of institutions of higher learning, House
Speaker Manny Villar said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to Villar, the House of Representatives finally
passed a measure last week that will entitle children of teachers
and employees in public and private institutions of higher
learning to free tuition and other school fees.
</P>
<P>
Villar said that the House bill offers a big incentive to the

<P>
"We recognize the needs of our country's teachers and it will
continue to provide them with incentives," said Villar, pointing
out that giving such benefits will help improve the quality of
education in the country.
</P>
<P>
The bill, says Villar, is a practical measure since it will
give teachers and employees an added benefit without any cost to
the institution.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The government will not risk the
lives of the hostages being held by the Abu Sayyaf by resorting to
a military option to rescue them, a senior government official
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said in a radio interview
that there are too many lives at stake to agitate the extremist
group into putting the lives of the hostages at risk.
</P>
<P>
"There are too many lives involved. We cannot resort to a
military solution until we exhaust all efforts," Zamora said
</P>
<P>
He issued the statement following calls from some sectors for
the government to resort to military action in finally ending the
three-and-a-half-month hostage standoff in Jolo.
</P>
<P>
But Zamora said President Joseph Estrada has put a premium on
the safety of the hostages, and has ordered that all peaceful
means be exhausted to secure their freedom.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Abu Sayyaf has released six Malaysians, two Germans
and three local Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf is still holding hostage 14 of the 21 people
abducted in April from Malaysian diving resort of Sipadan and then
moved to the southern Philippine island province of Sulu.
</P>
<P>
The 14 Sipadan hostages consist of three Malaysians, two
Germans, two French citizens, two Finns, two South Africans and
two Filipinos and a Lebanese woman. The rebels are also holding
three French journalists and 13 local Filipinos.

NEW DELHI, August 14 (Xinhua) -- A thick blanket of security
cover was Monday thrown around in the country especially in the

<P>
NAIROBI, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan government has
pledged to support all youth programs aimed at controlling AIDS,
Rwanda News Agency reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Rwanda expects a lot from youths particularly in as far as
AIDS control is concerned, because the disease is hindering
development," Francois Ngarambe, Rwandan Minister of Youth, Sports
and Culture, was quoted as saying at a youth gathering.
</P>
<P>
At the function, Innocent Ntaganira, co-ordinator of the
National AIDS Control Program, said AIDS is claiming the most
productive portion of the population and youth, especially those
in schools, need to play a crucial role in educating others and
putting in place possible modalities that can be used to fight the
pandemic.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the fact that an AIDS cure is not yet in place, the
epidemic can be controlled through total abstinence from sex and
faithfulness in marriage," the co-ordinator said.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the youth gathering, Ms. Janet Kagame urged
youth to be always active in sports and to consider and always
remember their role in development.

<HEADLINE> Somali Transitional Parliament Announced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of Somali
clans have declared the establishment of a transitional parliament,
the first of its kind in the country since the 1991 fall of
President Mohamed Siad Barre.
</P>
<P>
The representatives made the declaration Sunday in Arta,
Djibouti, where they have been holding Somali national peace
conference since May 2.
</P>
<P>
Djibouti President Ismael Omar Gulleh, sponsor of the Somali
peace process, and U.N. envoy David Stephen, were among the 1,200
people attending the inauguration of the Somali transitional
assembly.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of the transitional constitution, the 245-strong
parliament is making preparations to elect new president and prime
minister of the state.
</P>
<P>
The result of the election is likely to be announced before
Tuesday and a new Somali government will be established soon. The
cabinet will initially be working in the south-central Somali city
of Baidoa until the security situation in Mogadishu improves.
</P>
<P>
However, Hussein Mohamed Aidid, a key warlord in Somalia, has
been opposing the transitional parliament, and vowed to derail the
Djibouti-led peace process.
</P>
<P>
Aidid, who controls the southern part of the country,
threatened on Sunday that he would send his militiamen to Somalia'
s air and sea points of entry to prevent the delegates from
returning home.
</P>
<P>
Somalia has been in political turmoil since the downfall of the
Siad regime in 1991. Successive years of fighting between warlords
has plunged the country into disintegration.
</P>
<P>
So far, the world community has organized 12 peace conferences
with the participation of representatives from Somali clans, but
none of them succeeded.

<HEADLINE> Stranded Russian Submarine May Be Flooded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, August 14 (Xinhua) -- A Russian nuclear submarine that
was stranded on the bottom of Barents Sea may have become partly
filled with water, the Interfax news agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The multipurpose "Kursk," which was on a training mission as
part of Russian Northern Fleet's regular exercises, failed to
respond to radio signals at a predetermined time. Communications
with crew members were re-established later, Interfax said,
quoting the Russian Navy press service.
</P>
<P>
The submarine's atomic power plant has been taken off line and
is under control with radiation at normal levels, the press
service said.
</P>
<P>
According to the independent NTV channel, there are no lights
aboard the submarine and there could be problems with air supply
following the shutdown of the nuclear power reactors.
</P>
<P>
"Kursk" remains on the Barents Sea floor, where the sea is
about 100 meters deep. Three submarines and five submersible
attack vessels have come to its rescue.  Northern Fleet
Commander Admiral Vyacheslav Popov is overseeing the rescue
operation, which is aimed at raising the submarine to the surface
and evacuating its crew.
</P>
<P>
The "Kursk" was commissioned for the Russian Navy in 1995. It
has a displacement of 14,700 - 23,860 tons and can dive to depths
of up to 500 meters. The submarine is armed with torpedoes and "
Granite" cruise missiles. It can operate autonomously for up to
120 days and carries a 107-man crew, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Northern Fleet started its routine exercises last
Thursday aimed at improving cooperation between the ships of the
versatile aircraft carrier group and other forces of the fleet,
Russian media reported.
</P>
<P>
The maneuvers, which involved 20 warships, submarines and
auxiliary vessels and 10 coast units, were scheduled to end on
Sunday.

<HEADLINE> EU to Provide More Aid to Mozambique's Flood Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The European Union said Monday
that it has approved a further fund of 1.1 million euros (990,000
U.S. dollars) in humanitarian aid to help flood victims in
Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
The aid aims to help the resettlement of an estimated 18,850
families there.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, said the aid
will allow non-governmental organizations to carry out projects on
food security, water, sanitation and shelters in Gaza, Inhambane
and Sofala provinces.
</P>
<P>
Since the start of the floods, the value of the aid has totaled
10.83 million euros (9.75 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Commission said it remains on course to phase out its
relief and resettlement programs by the end of the year, as the
strategic focus shifts to structural support for large-scale
rehabilitation and ongoing development initiatives.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: China's Largest Environmental Protection Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 14 (Xinhua) -- China launched its largest ever
environmental protection program in 1996 to curb worsening
industrial pollution nationwide and improve the quality of air and
water in the country's 46 major cities. The program is scheduled
to be completed this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the four-year program, the total amount of
discharges involving 12 major pollutants should be curbed to
designated levels by 2000, and all of the 230,000 polluting
industrial firms must meet the industrial pollution discharge
standards set by central and local governments this year or face
being closed down.
</P>
<P>
Under the State Council's "Decisions on Some Issues Concerning
Environmental Protection," as the program is called, the quality
of air and water in residential and industrial districts in 46
major cities must reach the standards set by the central
government.
</P>
<P>
The 46 cities include Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Chongqing,
and provincial capital cities, coastal open cities and cities
designated as tourist destinations.
</P>
<P>
Controlling pollution is a serious matter and top leaders have
reiterated the pollution control targets must be met. By the end
of June this year, 210,900 of all the 238,000 industrial firms
across China were up to state requirements, accounting for 88.4
percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
But only 78.9 percent of China's key polluting firms, usually
large state-owned large plants, have met the targets, while only
66 percent of the top 620 state-owned firms are up to the
standards.
</P>
<P>
The 210 key state-owned firms which are yet to meet the
pollution control targets involve metallurgical, chemical, coal-
mining, non-ferrous metals and paper-making industries.

<P>
BEIJING, August 14 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese farmer-turned
entrepreneur has just offered a free training course for 28
officials from the Tibet Autonomous Region on the management of
township enterprises, the State Ethnic Affairs Commission said
today.
</P>
<P>
The project is one of the many clinched when an entrepreneur
delegation, organized by the Ministry of Agriculture, visited the
autonomous region last year.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Helin, a famous farmer-turned entrepreneur in east China'
s Anhui Province, has invited a group of renowned professors and
entrepreneurs, as well as some government officials, to provide
lectures to the 28 officials, who come from eight prefectures and
cities in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
The month-long training course involves the socialist market
economy, the art of leadership, scientific advancement and
sustainable development, as well as taxation, government policies,
and laws and regulations.
</P>
<P>
Zhang, a deputy to the National People's Congress, China's top
legislature, set up a township entrepreneur school in 1985 to help
local township entrepreneurs.

<HEADLINE> Shenzhen Eyes Potential of High-Tech Cooperation with HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The government of Shenzhen
City attaches great importance to cooperation with Hong Kong in
high-tech development, which is of abundant resources and great
potential between both sides.
</P>
<P>
Li Decheng, executive vice-mayor of Shenzhen, said Monday in
Hong Kong that the Shenzhen city government is fully aware of the
priority of Hong Kong in the market capitalization and information
technology infrastructure, while Shenzhen has its advantage of
manufacturing and research.
</P>
<P>
The coordination between Shenzhen and Hong Kong will surely
boost the industrialization of high-tech for both sides, noted Li
at a press conference of "Achievement of Opening and Reform of
Shenzhen and the Second China Hi-Tech Fair" held Monday in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
Li said the output value of high-tech products of Shenzhen in
1999 totaled 81.9 billion yuan (9.8 billion U.S. dollars),
accounting for 40.5 percent of local gross industrial output and
the high-tech industry has become the primary growth point for the
local economy.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Hong Kong has been the biggest investor and
the most important gateway of imports and exports for Shenzhen,
since the establishment of the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone two
decades ago.
</P>
<P>
The high-tech development in Shenzhen will surely benefit from
the institutions of venture capital investment and scientific
research in Hong Kong, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said top universities of both the Chinese mainland and Hong
Kong, such as Beijing University, Qinghua University and the Hong
Kong University of Science and Technology, have all made Shenzhen
a base for the high-tech research and production.
</P>
<P>
Under the "one country, two systems" principle, the cooperation
between Shenzhen and Hong Kong is now improving at deeper level
and in broader fields, he said.

<HEADLINE> Israel Announces Dramatic Tax Reductions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Finance Minister
Avraham Shochat announced Monday that purchase tax on 630 products
will be abolished or dramatically lowered.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a specially arranged press conference, Shochat said
that the tax reduction move will go into effect at 12 p.m. (2100
GMT) Monday night.
</P>
<P>
According to the new regulations, purchase tax on some 300
items, including video cameras, walkmans, carpets and cosmetics,
will be abolished at all. To date, Israelis have to pay a 17
percent purchase tax, the highest in developed countries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, taxes on another approximately 330 items, including
television sets and refrigerators, will be cut from 80 percent to
40 percent.
</P>
<P>
Although the new system does not reduce the tax burden on fuel,
cigarettes and alcohol, most Israeli consumers are expected to
welcome the move.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the dramatic tax reduction was an example of so-
called election economy, in which Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
wanted to use the economic bait to prevail on potential voters.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister's control in Israel's 120-member Knesset had
shrunk to 40 seats following a series of resignations of his ruling
partners due to differences over the Israeli-Palestinian peace
process. He is facing a number of no-confidence motions and early
election bills in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that with such a minority, Barak's government
will not survive for too long and an early election will surely
take place next spring.
</P>
<P>
However, Shochat said the cuts were made possible after the
country experienced a much faster growth rate than expected. He
denied that the possibility of elections had been considered.

Dhahiri.
</P>
<P>
But the importation of these pipes has a condition: they should
be highly manufactured so that the particles will not be crumbled,
he said.

<HEADLINE> Israel Warns Against Unilateral Move on Palestinian Statehood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 14 (Xinhua) -- A senior Israeli official
Monday warned that Israel will annex part of the West Bank in
response to Palestinian unilateral move on statehood.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's diplomatic and security
chief of staff Danny Yatom told Israel Radio if the Palestinians
make a unilateral declaration of statehood, Israeli will apply
jurisdiction on significant portions of the West Bank, particularly
areas heavily populated by the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
He also said that there will be another summit with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat is on international tour after
the breakdown of the latest Palestinian-Israeli peace talks last
month at Camp David in the U.S. to rally support for the statehood
declaration on September 13.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio had quoted senior diplomatic sources here as saying
that U.S. State of Secretary Madeleine Albright will visit the
region at the end of August to examine chances for holding another
summit. U.S. Mideast special envoy Dennis Ross will arrived in the
Middle East next week.
</P>
<P>
The Camp David summit failed to achieve a breakthrough for a
comprehensive peace between the two foes. Speculations for a fresh
summit have run high recently.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Knesset (parliament) member Moshe Arens
of the opposition Likud party called it an unprecedented scandal if
the prime minister could go to another summit to reach an agreement
with the Palestinians without the support of the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
In such a situation, Arens argued that Barak cannot come back
with a fait accompli and a signed agreement.
</P>
<P>
Barak suffered a series of political blows prior to his
departure for the U.S.-brokered Camp David summit as three of his
coalition partners, the Yisrael Ba'aliya, the National Religious
Party and the ultra-Orthodox Shas Party, withdrew from his
coalition to protest his peace policies.
</P>
<P>
The ensuing resignation of former Foreign Minister David Levy
reduced Barak's government to a shaky minority of 40 seats in the
120-member Knesset.
</P>
<P>
Following the summit, both Israelis and Palestinians have been
trying to drum up international support for their positions in the
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Reports, in the meantime, predicted that the Palestinians would
postpone the statehood declaration scheduled for September 13 as
Arafat has reportedly failed to win wide support for the intention.
</P>
<P>
The Palestine Central Council is set to convene on September 8
or 9 on making a final decision on the issue, Palestinian Radio has
reported.

<HEADLINE> Controversy on Japanese PM's Visit to Dhaka Crops up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA August 14 (Xinhua) -- A controversy has cropped up
regarding the planned visit of Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro
Mori's visit to Bangladesh beginning from August 19.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh Foreign Ministry Monday reaffirmed that the visit of
Japanese prime minister is "still uncertain" due to the "
worsening flood", but did not mention the dengue affliction as a
reason for cancellation of the visit.
</P>
<P>
The official Bangladesh News Agency Sunday night quoted highly
placed foreign ministry sources as saying that the Mori's visit
to this country is "unlikely" to take place due to the country's
flood situation and affliction of a large number of people by
dengue virus.
</P>
<P>
A Senior official of the Japanese embassy, however, said on
Sunday that "So far as we know, the trip is on. We are making all
preparations for the visit."
</P>
<P>
When asked if it was correct that due to the dengue situation,
the visit has been put off, he replied " There is no danger from
dengue to our prime minister. The prime minister of Bangladesh
has already assured about all preventive measures."
</P>
<P>
Asked if floods would prevent the trip, he replied that only 20
per cent of the country's land has been flooded, it is not that
serious. "Floods are normal for the country," he added.
</P>
<P>
A competent source in the foreign ministry said the issue was
different over the uncertainty of the visit of the prime minister
of japan, the largest donor to Bangladesh economy.
</P>
<P>
Demanding anonymity, he said the dispute was concerning the
visit of National Martyrs Monument in Savar, 30 kilometers west of
Dhaka and the visit to the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman
Memorial Museum by the Japanese prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The source said Bangladesh government was ready to take a
lenient view about the visit to Bangabandhu museum issue, but was
not ready to make any concession about the visit to the national
monument.
</P>
<P>
The source said Japanese officials were unwilling about the
monument visit on the security ground. But the Bangladesh
government said that it has taken adequate security measure for
the safe visit of Mori to the monument.
</P>
<P>
The source, however, said the government's preparation is going
on in full swing to receive the Japanese prime minister in a
befitting way though Dhaka and Tokyo are bargaining on this
particular issue.
</P>
<P>
The source said the government of Sheikh Hasina is not ready to
give any concession about Savar trip because it has a bitter
experience of canceling the monument visit by the U.S. President
Bill Clinton on security reasons during his Dhaka visit on March
20 this year.
</P>
<P>
The government faced serious criticism from different quarters
for Clinton's cancellation of the trip to the martyrs memorial.
</P>
<P>
The source, however, hoped the issue would be settled at last
and Mori will visit Bangladesh.

<HEADLINE> Australian Scientists Claim New Cloning Technique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Australian scientists Monday
claimed a world-first in the development of therapeutic cloning
techniques that could be used for the treatment of diseases such
as HIV, Alzheimer's and diabetes.
</P>
<P>
Professor Alan Trounson, deputy director of the Monash
Institute of Reproduction and Development, told reporters that a
team of scientists had proven the theory that cells could be grown
using a patient's own DNA.
</P>
<P>
Therapeutic cloning involves the growing of cells in the
laboratory and reintroducing them into the body where they have
the potential to grow into any type of cell.
</P>
<P>
Trounson said that the breakthrough had been achieved by Monash
Ph.D. student Megan Munsie, who had successfully removed the DNA
from an unfertilized mouse egg and replaced it with the DNA of a
cell developed from a second mouse.
</P>
<P>
But he said it could be at least five years before the research
was applied to humans.
</P>
<P>
"This research enables us to go on and explore human
applications," Trounson told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"We've talked about it but never been able to prove it - now we
can," he said.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Ruling Party Sets Prior Condition for General Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Secretary General Joao Lourenco
of the ruling People's Movement for Liberation of Angola has said
that the second general elections in his country will "only take
place when security and peace conditions are in place", the
official news agency Angop reported here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
At the moment no one is in a position to tell whether those
conditions are in place for the holding of elections in the year
2001, Lourenco said when addressing the state-owned TPA television
station at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
He explained that under the electoral law currently in force in
Angola, the calling of the elections needs a prior consultation
between the head of state and the political parties to fix the
exact dates.
</P>
<P>
The consultation will only take place after the approval of the
new constitution, further to the creation of minimum conditions
that can secure the free circulation of people and goods and the
re-settlement of the internally displaced persons, he said.
</P>
<P>
The secretary general appealed to the political parties in the
country to engage themselves in the elaboration of the new
constitutional law for the rapid implementing of the
presuppositions related to the realization of the elections.
</P>
<P>
In a normal situation, after the first general elections in
1992, Angola was to hold the third elections this year, but due to
the lack of security it was not possible to fulfill the terms
provided in the law, Lourenco said, stressing that "this situation
is due to the post-elections war started by the Jonas Savimbi's
organization."
</P>
<P>
"The government has the constitutional duty of combating to
reach peace in the country," he added.

<HEADLINE> Illegal Imports Threaten Tanzania's Tea Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Tea production, one of
Tanzania's pillar industries, is facing the threat of illegal
imports, which totals about 5,000 tons a year.
</P>
<P>
The official Daily News Monday quoted Chairman of Tea Board of
Tanzania (TBT) Abdallah Mdee as saying that since the TBT Act was
put into force on October 1, 1997, the board has never issued any
import license for tea, but the shelves of shops and supermarkets
in Tanzania are stacked with foreign tea.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania is producing an average of 25,000 tons of tea a year
and about 5,000 tons is for domestic demand, with the surplus of
20,000 tons for export, the chairman said, noting that the
industry employs over 1 million Tanzanians who depend on it for
their livelihood.
</P>
<P>
Since the illegal tea are being smuggled, no taxes are paid on
them and they could be sold at a lower price than the local
product, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the tea industry is very young and can not stand the
influx of foreign tea, warning that illegal imports will kill the
industry and subsequently affect the 1 million people.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, customs officials said they have recently impounded
large amounts of tea at both official entry points and secret
routes from a neighboring country.
</P>
<P>
Such cargo was destroyed to protect the local industry, they
said.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, some 23,626 tons of tea were
produced in Tanzania in 1999 and 21,364 tons were exported for 24.
3 million U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> China Develops Advanced E-Commerce Service System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 14 (Xinhua) -- China has developed an
internationally advanced e-commerce service system that can
connect with various terminals and greatly reduce the costs of e-
commerce service providers.
</P>
<P>
The system, called iSwitch Platform, can transform service
requests by customers using different terminals. Customers can
connect using almost all the terminals available in the market,
including PC, mobile phones, fax machines, Personal Data Assistant
(PDA), television and even pagers.
</P>
<P>
The system is developed by the Shenzhen-based Liming Network
Systems Co., a major computer network integration company that has
developed networks for over 800 institutions in China, including
the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges.
</P>
<P>
While it provides the maximum flexibility and mobility for
customers, the system also greatly reduces the costs for
businesses in operating and maintaining different e-commerce
systems.
</P>
<P>
For example, a typical branch of a securities company in China
provides telephone and Internet trading services, which means they
need dozens or even hundreds of telephone lines and a website.
</P>
<P>
"With iSwitch, they need only one data telecommunications line
to connect with the platform, the rest will be left by us," Deng
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the impact of iSwitch on stock exchanges,
securities companies, banks and other e-commerce providers might
turnout to be "revolutionary".
</P>
<P>
Since the first platform went into commercial operation last
March in Shenzhen, the company has opened new platforms in Hong
Kong, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Xiamen and Beijing, connecting more
than 100 securities brokers, banks, certificate agents and other e-
commerce providers.
</P>
<P>
It has taken the Liming company three years to develop the
system. The company has the full intellectual property rights.
</P>
<P>
The prototype system was developed in November 1998. In
December 1999, a review by the Ministry of Information Industry
said the system was of a world class standard.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIDAIHE, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
told visiting Palestinian President Yasser Arafat here Monday that
China believes that the Palestinian National Authority led by

<HEADLINE> Iranian Government Ratifies Merger of Ministries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 14 (Xinhua) -- As part of cabinet shake-up by
President Mohammad Khatami, the Iranian government has approved a
bill to forge two new ministries on the basis of two mergers, the
Islamic Republic News Agency reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a session on Sunday, the government ratified the creation the
Industries and Mines Ministry through the tie-up of the Ministry of
Industries and Ministry of Mines and Metals, and the Agriculture
and Construction Jihad Ministry by combining the Ministry of
Agriculture and Ministry of Construction Jihad.
</P>
<P>
But it is not clear who will be appointed to head the two new
ministries.
</P>
<P>
In June, President Khatami appointed former Minister of Post,
Telegraph and Telephones Mohammad Reza Aref to head the newly
formed State Management and Planning Organization, which came into
existance by the consolidation of the Planning and Budget
Organization and the Civil Administration and Recruitment
Organization.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the reformists won a landslide victory over the
conservatives in the February parliamentary election, President
Khatami has been advised to make a big change in his cabinet by
removing those who are not fully coordinated with the reformists.
</P>
<P>
Last month, some 211 members of reformist-controlled parliament,
which started work on May 27, urged Khatami to take an immediate
action to reshuffle his cabinet by merging some ministries.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Khatami, the parliamentarians called on his
government to submit a bill to the parliament in a month for merger
of several ministries doing similar jobs.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Accuses U.S., Britain of Shelving Health Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The United States and British
representatives at the United Nations Sanctions Committee have put
on hold Iraqi medical contracts worth over 370 million U.S.
dollars, Iraqi Health Minister Umid Medhat Mubarak said here on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the health minister said that during the past
seven phases of the U.N. oil-for-food program, Iraq concluded
medical contracts with foreign countries worth over 1.24 billion
dollars, but only 870 million dollars worth of contracts were
approved by the U.N. Sanctions Committee.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and British delegates at the U.N. Sanctions Committee
were behind the nonfulfillment of contracts "to induce the Iraqi
people as much losses as possible," Mubarak said.
</P>
<P>
The policy of suspending medical contracts by the U.S. and
Britain has aggravated the suffering of the Iraqi people, who have
reeled from the 10-year-old U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has claimed that a total of 1,989 contracts Iraq signed
with foreign countries during the past seven phases of the U.N.
oil-for-food program were put on hold.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has frequently accused the U.S. and Britain of blocking
Iraq's vital imports to impede the implementation of the U.N.
humanitarian program.
</P>
<P>
Since the program was launched in late 1996, the U.S. and
Britain have blocked over 3 billion dollars worth of contracts that
needed by Iraq to buy daily necessities, oil equipment and spare
parts, according to U.N. statistics released last April.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under crippling U.N. sanctions ever since its 1990
invasion of Kuwait, but the U.N. oil-for-food accord allows Baghdad
to export crude in return for U.N.-supervised imports of food,
medicine and other humanitarian supplies.

<HEADLINE> Negotiation Ball in Israel's Court: PLC Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, August 14 ( Xinhua ) -- Speaker of the Palestinian
Legislative Council Ahmed Qureia said Monday that the ball of
negotiations is now in Israel's court.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement, Qureia, who is also a member of the
Palestinian negotiating team, said he has not met his Israeli
counterpart Shlomo Ben Ami since the collapse of the Camp David
summit, dismissing any contacts between them.
</P>
<P>
Resuming negotiations, holding a second summit and reaching an
agreement are dependent upon the Israeli government's position, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Without a position within the framework of international
legitimacy, an agreement can not be reached and the situation will
be extremely difficult," he added.
</P>
<P>
Should Israel be willing to arrive at a lasting peace agreement,
it has to abide by the international legitimacy resolutions, he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians still stick to the peace process, he said. A
solution to Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees and settlements can not
be found unless Israel commits itself to the international
legitimacy resolutions and abjures its roundabout methods and
procrastination, added Qureia.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Capital Rescue Program to Expire at Yearend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government will end its
capital rescue program for local financial institutions at the end
of this year, a Finance Ministry source disclosed here Monday.
</P>
<P>
As the program, a reform measure the ministry initiated on
August 14, 1998, is coming to the end, local financial
institutions will not be able to apply for its assistance any more,
said the source, who refused to be identified.
</P>
<P>
For those financial institutions which still need governmental
assistance after the end of the program, the Financial Sector
Restructuring Authority will be authorized to consider such
requests until March 31, 2001, the source said.
</P>
<P>
Officials said the program has been successful in the sense
that it had helped restore the confidence of the public and
investors that all financial institutions had adequate equity.
</P>
<P>
However, in practice, the conditions for the financial support
include many strict requirements. As a result, of the 300 billion
baht (7.5 billion U.S. dollars) that had been allocated for the
measure, 229.3 billion baht (5.7 billion dollars) is left unused.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen financial institutions, including commercial banks,
finance companies and securities companies, have applied for help
under the program,seeking a total of 61.7 billion baht (1.8
billion dollars).

<HEADLINE> Indian Bank Orders Conversion of US Dollar Accounts to Rupees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The Reserve Bank of India (RBI)
Monday ordered U.S. dollar-denominated Exchange Earners Foreign
Currency (EEFC) account holders to convert 50 percent of their
accounts into rupees by August 23 to prop up the Indian currency's
value, the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported from Mumbai.
</P>
<P>
The rupee, which declined sharply against the U.S. dollar early
on Monday on renewed heavy dollar demand, had dipped by a whopping
1.4 percent against the greenback last week and had lost around 5.
5 percent of its value since January, the PTI noted.
</P>
<P>
According to an RBI statement, pending a review of the EEFC
account, it has been decided that the balances in these accounts
will be scaled down to 50 percent of the amount held on August 11
this year.
</P>
<P>
"The excess of over 50 percent should be converted into rupees
latest by August 23, 2000, and the authorized dealers should
report compliance by the due date," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The bank also decided to permit future accretions only up to 50
percent of what is currently eligible and henceforth such
accretions should be maintained in liquid form as current or
savings accounts, the PTI added.
</P>
<P>
In fairly hectic but cautious trade at the Interbank Foreign
Exchange Market, the rupee dipped to 45.88/91 against one dollar
in late morning business on Monday, the PTI reported.

<HEADLINE> Gas Flaring Must Be Ended: Nigerian Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has given
order that gas flaring in the country's oil producing regions,
with its negative consequences on the environment, must be ended
by the year 2004, local press reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Minister of State for Environment Imeh Okopido was
quoted as saying on Sunday in Port Harcourt, an oil city in the
Niger delta area, that all oil companies operating in Nigeria must
find out ways to ensure the halt by that date.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria is rich in both oil and natural gas, but the gas is
usually burned out during the oil producing process, causing great
economic losses and environmental problems.
</P>
<P>
A natural gas liquidation factory costing more than 3 billion U.
S. dollars was put into operation earlier this year as a effort to
stop the long existing problem.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government hopes that revenue from gas export may
in ten years equal to about 50 percent of its current crude oil
export, changing the country's total dependence upon oil industry.

<HEADLINE> Coast Shelter Forest Expanding in Southwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, August 14 (Xinhua) -- More than 98 percent of the
coastline in southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region
have been afforested, forming a strong shield against typhoons.
</P>
<P>
Coast Shelter Forest Project is one of the 10 major ecological
construction projects in China. Since Guangxi started this project
in 1987, its acreage of the shelter forest has grown by 25,000
hectares annually with 1,230 kilometer-long coast line greened.
</P>
<P>
Officials with Guangxi's forest bureau attributed the rapid
expansion of shelter forest mainly to local governments' enhanced
efforts, scientific afforestation and active participation on the
part of local farmers and fishermen.
</P>
<P>
"It is very difficult to plant trees along the coast, as the
coastal land are mainly made up of sandy soil," an official said,
adding that various measures have been applied, including the use
of ABT tree-root growing powder and putting fertilizer in tree
holes, which proved to be effective.
</P>
<P>
Local Statistics indicate that from 1987 to 1999, Guangxi spent
630 million yuan in coastal afforestation, of the total, more than
26 million yuan were from local farmers and fishermen.
</P>
<P>
To improve the effectiveness of the coast shelter forest,
Guangxi will start the second stage of the project next year and
by 2010, 200,000 hectares of land will be afforested.

<HEADLINE> Albright to Visit Middle East: Radio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright is expected to visit Israel and other Middle
East countries at the end of this month, Israel Radio reported
Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
Quoting Israeli political sources, the report said that the
visit will follow that of U.S. Mideast special envoy Dennis Ross,
who is scheduled to arrive in Israel next Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's Office denied confirming the
report.
</P>
<P>
Both visits, the radio said, are obviously aiming to examine
possibilities to jump-start the Israeli-Palestinian peace process,
which hit a deadlock after the failure of last month's Camp David
summit talks.
</P>
<P>
The summit, attended by Barak, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
and U.S. President Bill Clinton, did make progress on some issues
but failed to narrow the two sides' gaps on the status of Jerusalem
and the return of Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
Since then, media speculations have run high saying that Barak
and Arafat will meet again, probably at the end of this month or at
the beginning of next month, to seal a deal before the September 13
deadline for such an agreement.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believed that if there are no progress regarding a
second Israeli-Palestinian summit, Albright may not bother to visit
the region again.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The Belgian police said Monday
that there were several fatal accidents happened over the past
weekend in this country.
</P>
<P>
The police arrested a driver who killed a cyclist Sunday at
Zuienkerke in West Flanders. The victim, a 50-year-old man, died
on the spot.
</P>
<P>
The driver was drunk and fled from the scene. At the time of
his arrest in the coastal resort of Wenduine, he was too
inebriated to be questioned, the police said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Sunday, a cyclist was killed in a separate accident
at Langemark, also in West Flanders, one of the provinces in
Belgium. The police said a young driver lost control over his car
and hit a group of cycling tourists. Two other cyclists were taken
to hospital with severe injuries.
</P>
<P>
At Peutie, near Brussels, two cyclists were injured when they
were hit by a car on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, former world cycling champion Johan Museeuw is in
hospital at Ghent, a major Belgian city, where he took his wife
and three-year-old son for a ride on his motorcycle. He suffered a
severe concussion and several other injuries.

<P>
BRUSSELS, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Fifteen people were injured as
two trains, including one passenger train, collided head-on Monday
in a tunnel in eastern Belgium, local television network reported.
</P>
<P>
RTBF, the radio and television network for the French-speaking
part of the country, said that two of the injured were in serious
conditions. One was a train driver.
</P>
<P>
The accident took place in the eastern Belgian city of Liege,
between the city's two communities of Liege Palais and Liege
Guillemins. No immediate explanation was given as how the accident
had happened.
</P>
<P>
Initial impression at the scene was that either the signal
system on either side of the tunnel went wrong at the time or
either of the two trains involved ignored the signal before
entering the tunnel.
</P>
<P>
Though the two trains did not derail due to the impact of the
collision but clearance work within the tunnel will not be
complete until late Tuesday, said RTBF.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities were mobilizing shuttle buses to replace the
train services between the two municipal communities.

<HEADLINE> Stone-Throwing Lebanese Shot by Israeli Soldier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 14 (Xinhua) -- One Lebanese civilian has suffered
a gunshot wound when an Israeli soldier fired at him in retaliation
for fresh stone-throwing attacks across the Fatma Gate on the
common border.
</P>
<P>
According to local press reports Monday, the incident took place
on Sunday. The incessant hostilities have prompted the United
Nations to probe the legal aspects of the phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
U.N. legal experts had termed the tossing of stone an individual
practice reflecting an emotional mood that does not constitute a
border violation.
</P>
<P>
Only when the stone causes an injury will it be classified as a
violation, the U.N. jurists have decided. Both Lebanon and Israel
have not adopted the U.N. concept as yet.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hezbollah's Secretary General Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah
has classified the stone-throwing phenomenon as "merely a symbolic
expression of emotion for the cameras."
</P>
<P>
In a speech at an elections rally in east Lebanon's Bekka valley
Sunday, Nasrallah said the United Nations, the European Union and
the Security Council were bringing pressure to bear for the
cessation of the stone-throwing attacks "because they want to
provide tranquility to Israel," the An Nahar newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
"All of them also want the Lebanese army to deploy along the
border so that Israel's security, not Lebanon's, is safeguarded,"
said Nasrallah, whose guerrillas are still functioning in the
southern Lebanese zone that was vacated by Israel May 24.
</P>
<P>
"I want to ask the Americans, the Europeans and pro-American
Lebanese this question: if the Lebanese army is deployed on the
border, will you approve of the army shelling northern Israel if
Israel shelled Lebanese civilians?" Nasrallah said.
</P>
<P>
"If an Israeli bulldozer crossed the border, as it happened a
few days ago, and if Israeli spy balloons enter Lebanese air space
and gunboats Lebanese territorial waters, do you agree that the
army should fire on them?" Nasrallah added.
</P>
<P>
The Americans and the Europeans are preoccupied with ensuring
Israel's tranquility, not Lebanon's, he concluded.

<HEADLINE> Record Victims Drown in Kinneret Due to Low Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Since the beginning of this
summer's swimming season, there are already 11 drowning cases in
Israel's Lake Kinneret, a record number in the same period in the
past 20 years, Israel's Jerusalem Post daily reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Quoting Lake Kinneret Authority's official, the report said that
the low water level of the lake has been a contributing factor to
the drowning cases.
</P>
<P>
"The low level of the lake means that bathers have to walk a
much longer way to reach the water in order to take a dip or swim,"
said Lake Kinneret Authority chairman Zvi Ortenberg.
</P>
<P>
"The problems arises when they reach the water and go in as far
as, say, their chest, as many would in normal circumstances, and
then suddenly there is a shelf or ridge where the water is much
deeper," added Ortenberg.
</P>
<P>
The water level of the lake, which is Israel's major fresh water
reservoir and has been a sovereignty contentious point between
Israel and Syria, has dropped close to 214 meters below sea level
due to this summer's depleted drought in Israel.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, a man named Abdullah Wahdan from Ramallah, the 11th
victim this summer, drown in the lake. His body later was found on
the lakebed about six meters below the surface, which underlined
Ortenberg's analyses.
</P>
<P>
The chairman urged tourists to swim only at organized beaches
and obey the instructions of lifeguards on duty. The lifeguards had
complained that many swimmers defied their suggestions about
dangerous bathing conditions, such as strong winds and heavy surf.

<HEADLINE> Angola to Increase Oil Production by 34 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Angola may increase its oil
production from next year to 1 million barrels per day, marking a
34 percent growth from the current capacity, the official news
agency Angop reported here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
As new wells are put into operation, the oil production in
Angola will grow to 1 million barrels per day from the current 745,
000 barrels per day, said Angolan Oil Minister Botelho de
Vasconcelos at the weekend while addressing a lecture on the oil
sector.
</P>
<P>
Angola is the second largest oil-producing country in the
African continent, next to Nigeria. As more and more foreign oil
explorers came and operated in the oil-abundant country, the
southwest African state has become an oil exporter since 1978.

GENEVA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Two delegates of the
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), kidnapped in
Georgia over a week ago, returned to Geneva on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Arriving in Geneva on board a plane from the Georgian capital,
Tbilisi, chartered by the ICRC, the French and Italian delegates,
Sophie Prokofiev and Natalia Zelino, were met by their families at
the airport.
</P>
<P>
ICRC spokesman Chris Bowers said that they would spend two days
in debriefing. He said the organization had not paid a ransom to
secure their freedom. The ICRC said that they appeared to be in
good health.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC announced in the early hours of August 13 the release
of the two and their colleague Yuri Darchiev, who had been held in
the Pankisi valley since August 4,2000 while carrying out a
humanitarian assignment. The international humanitarian
organization has suspended operations in Georgia since then.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Want Tougher Line on Right-wing Extremism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Most Swiss want the authorities
to do more to clamp down on right-wing extremism, according to a
survey published on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Up to 68 percent of those questioned said they thought the
police had been too lax when a crowd of neo-nazis disrupted a
speech given by the finance minister, Kaspar Villiger, on August 1,
said the survey in the Swiss German-language newspaper "
SonntagsBlick".
</P>
<P>
They criticized that police did virtually nothing to prevent
the extremists getting to the site of the speech, or to disperse
the group when it heckled the minister. The survey found that only
18 percent felt the police had behaved correctly and 13 percent
had no opinion.
</P>
<P>
The poll was carried out by the Isopublic polling institute,
which questioned over 1,000 people in German and French-speaking
Switzerland.

<HEADLINE> Geneva to Host Public Information Center on Cults </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Six years after 48 members of the
Solar temple cult were killed or committed suicide in western
Switzerland, the authorities in Geneva are to open the first
public information center on cults in the country, according to a
Swiss Radio International report Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Geneva-based Center for Information on Beliefs, due to be
open to the public next January, is created with cooperation among
eight cantons, Geneva, Neuchatel, Jura, Fribourg, Valais, Vaud,
Ticino and Berne, most of them in the French-speaking region of
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
On the night of October 4, 1994, 48 people were murdered or
killed themselves in the belief they were being transferred to
another planet. 25 died at the small skiing resort of Granges-sur-
Salvan in canton Valais. Another 23 perished in the village of
Cheiry, in canton Fribourg. Some had been shot in the head several
times.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the deaths, the Justice department in Geneva
invited the other cantons to join it in exchanging information on
cult activities.
</P>
<P>
"We realized there was a need for adequate information
concerning cults, both to prevent tragedies and to improve the
awareness of the public," said Francois Bellanger, the Geneva's
Justice department's expert on cults, who conducted the report.
</P>
<P>
"The aim of the center is to provide neutral information to the
public about different beliefs," he said. The center will obtain
information from religious groups willing to cooperate, as well as
from private groups which help victims of sects and from
university researchers.
</P>
<P>
Geneva is one of the Swiss cantons subtly tightening
legislation in this area. The local parliament is considering two
laws, one designed to help the victims of cults and another which
would crack down on the commercial activities of religious
organizations.
</P>
<P>
For now the center will operate primarily in the French-
speaking part of Switzerland. "It is to be hoped that one day the
federal government will change its mind and we will have a center
for the whole of Switzerland," Bellanger said.
</P>
<P>
As a prelude to the creation of the center, the Geneva
authorities will this autumn publish a booklet, aimed at potential
victims and parents, outlining the dangers of cults.

<HEADLINE> Urban Residents Spending More on Clothes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Urban Chinese have been spending
more on clothes, shoes and fashion commodities since the beginning
of the year, an official with the State Administration of Textile
Industry said today.
</P>
<P>
The disposable income of urban residents saw an annual increase
of 8.7 percent in the January-June period, averaging 543 yuan per
month. They spent some 405 yuan each month, and 46 yuan on
clothing, up 5 percent year-on-year, the official said.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months, factory prices for textile products
picked up considerably, due to a significant increase of the
garment trade on the domestic market and a price hike of raw
materials. By June, factory prices for textiles grew by 3.7
percentage point and that of chemical fiber products by 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
Trade volume on major textile markets in Jiangsu, Shenyang,
Wuhan and Guangdong provinces all registered a double-digit growth.

BEIJING, August 14 (Xinhua) -- China today threatened to
deliver severe punishments on insurance companies using
administrative forces and other dishonest means to sell accident
insurance policies to students.
</P>
<P>
The warning by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC)
comes at a time when students are returning to school after their
summer vacation.
</P>
<P>
Student accident insurance is cheap and popular. But some
insurance companies have been using administrative forces to
expand their market share or even monopolize local markets.
</P>
<P>
CIRC reiterates that customers have free will to purchase any
kind of insurance policies, including accident insurance for
children.

<HEADLINE> China's Industrial Belt Struggles to Control Pollution (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Northeastern provinces of
Liaoning, Jilin and Heilongjiang has been making every effort to
meet State deadlines in controlling industrial pollution.
</P>
<P>
In a decision to control growing industrial pollution following
18 years of high economic growth, the central government vowed
four years ago to close down all the polluting industrial firms
that failed to meet industrial pollution discharge standards set
by both the central and local governments by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that by the end of June only 82 percent of the
13,800 firms in Liaoning have met the standards, while 73 percent
of the 5,600 firms in Jilin and 75 percent of the 2,900 firms in
Heilongjiang were up to standards.
</P>
<P>
In comparison, 86 percent of all the 230,000 industrial firms
across China were up to the standard.
</P>
<P>
Progress made by the northeastern provinces is still considered
significant by many observers as many of the polluting firms in
the economically-troubled region are still too poor to build
pollution-control facilities without the government's financial
support.
</P>
<P>
Leading provincial and municipal government officials in the
region have done all they can to help many polluting firms meet
the deadline, including funding support for financially difficult
firms.
</P>
<P>
The region has also worked hard to use financial resources such
as donations collected by the central government and loans from
the World Bank to build waste water treatment plants and promote
clean production among large firms.
</P>
<P>
In Shenyang, the largest industrial center in the region, 54
firms have been closed down because they were heavy polluters and
appeared unable to meet the deadline set by local governments. (

<HEADLINE> Twenty New Cities to Be Set Up in China Every Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 14 (Xinhua) -- China is planning to set up 20
new cities annually in the coming 20 years, according to an
article published in the latest issue of "Outlook Weekly".
</P>
<P>
The article, written by Minister of Civil Affairs Doje Cering,
states the plan will help improve the urbanization of China's
rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Doje Cering said that in the coming two decades, about 12
million people from China's rural areas will move to urban areas
annually. Therefore, 20 new cities need to be set up.
</P>
<P>
Only counties with more than 50 percent urban residents can be
approved as cities. China set up more than 400 county-level cities
in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
The article points out that more cities should be set up in the
country's central and western areas, which is the requirement of
future and nationwide city layout planning.
</P>
<P>
Stress should be given to large and medium-sized cities with
obvious regional and infrastructure advantages.

In Changchun, capital of Jilin Province, Zhang Junxian,
director of the Changchun Environmental Protection Bureau, said
the Bureau has sent its officials to every key polluting firms who
are having difficulty meeting the deadline.
</P>
<P>
"The officials are told to stay in the designated firms to
ensure the Bureau is satisfied that firms are doing something to
cut pollution and are going to meet the deadline."
</P>
<P>
For those who could not meet the deadline, local governments
plan to close down those outdated and firms considered to be
loosing money. Leading environmental officials in the region say
more than 90 percent of the polluting firms are expected to meet
the deadline.
</P>
<P>
China has closed more than 60,000 polluting small firms over
the past few years.

<P>
BEIRUT, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Fifty school principals from south
Lebanon have been lectured on how to educate students and residents
about the dangers of land mines, Daily Star newspaper reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
At a seminar Sunday in Ibl es-Saqi, a formerly Israeli-occupied
village, army officers showed participants real plastic mines
removed from Israel's former occupation zone.
</P>
<P>
Israel withdrew its troops from south Lebanon on May 24, ending
the 22-year occupation there and the western Bekka, but years of
conflicts between Israeli occupation troops and Lebanese resistance
forces have left numerous land mines scattered in the areas.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, the first of its kind since Israel's pullout, was
organized by the Social Affairs Ministry and the Communist Party's
Popular Rescue Association.
</P>
<P>
"It is very difficult to remove mines in Lebanon because maps of
the minefields are not available," First Lieutenant Sharbel Serhal
said, "the army was able to remove mines it had planted on the
former front line in the western Bekka in three days because it had
the maps."
</P>
<P>
He also explained the differences between the mines planted by
militias and anti-personnel mines left over by the Israelis. The
most dangerous mines are those of the anti-personnel type. They
explode when stepped on by pedestrians.
</P>
<P>
Serhal warned of unexploded cluster bombs that produce explosive
shrapnel if tampered with. "People who find lanes or wires lying
above the surface must inform the nearest army position to have the
area examined," he added.
</P>
<P>
An official from U.S. Agency for International Development,
Toufiq Rizkallah said his organization has allocated 200 million U.
S. dollars for the period between 1998 and 2001 to finance
Lebanon's mine-sweeping plans, awareness campaigns, statistics and
medical aid for mine victims.
</P>
<P>
While no figures are available about mines planted by militias,
Israel admitted that it left more than 130,000 mines in Lebanon,
but maps it supplied only showed the locations of 3,000 mines, the
U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon said.
</P>
<P>
Since Israeli pullout, five civilians have been killed and 25
others injured in landmine explosions in the south.
</P>
<P>
The first Ukrainian troops, specialized in de-mining, arrived in
Beirut in June, but only a small percentage of mines have been
cleared so far.

MANILA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Share prices at the Philippine
Stock Exchange closed lower Monday as investors cashed in on gains
made in previous sessions.
</P>
<P>
The 30-company Phisix, the market's main index, dropped 11.01

But the broader all-shares index slightly rose by 4.59 points

Analysts said profit-taking dominated market activity after
investors unloaded shares of some blue chip issues.
</P>
<P>
"It's expected that after days of gains on technical rebounds,
the market will go down again on profit-taking. Nothing really
fundamental holds the market, so the previous gains were not
permanent," said Edward Lopez, a local market analyst.

<HEADLINE> Thai Economy Expected to Grow 5 Percent This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The Thai economy is expected to
grow 5 percent this year despite the current impact of higher oil
prices, according to a report of the Commerce Ministry available
here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister and Commerce Minister Supachai
Panitchpakdi was quoted as saying Thai exports in the first six
months of this year expanded by 21 percent over the same period of
last year and this would be a key factor leading to the country's
achievement of its economic growth rate of 5 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The 21-percent expansion of Thai exports in the first half of
this year will not only help boost overall export growth at the
year end to no less than 10 percent, but also lead to an economic
growth of around 5 percent, despite the current oil price hike, he
described.
</P>
<P>
Supachai stressed that Thailand's fiscal status and
international trade had been sound despite a recent rise in
domestic oil prices and that it is not necessary now to adjust
economic figures earlier forecast by the Office of the National
Economic and Social Development Board.

NAIROBI, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Five international airlines,
including three that have been operating charter flights between
Europe and Kenya, will start their scheduled services to the
Kenyan capital Nairobi from the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The five international airlines are Russian carrier Aeroflot,
Olympic of Greece, Corsair of France, Condor and LTU of Germany,
the East African weekly reported Monday.
</P>

The entry of the French and German airlines is expected to
facilitate direct passenger service between Kenya, France and
Germany following the termination of operations by their national
airlines Air France and Lufthansa, in March this year and April
last year respectively.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, passenger services between Kenya, Russia and Greece,
which have been adversely affected since last year when Aeroflot
and Olympic suspended flights to Nairobi, are set to resume.
</P>
<P>
Condor and LTU, which have been operating weekly charter
flights to the Kenyan tourist resort town of Mombasa, will from
mid-December start scheduled flights, filling up the gap created

<HEADLINE> Zambia Steps up War Against Poachers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government is
expected to deploy paramilitary policemen from Monday in all
national game parks and game reserves following intensified
poaching, the Zambia Daily Mail newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The paramilitary officers would be ferried to the parks by two
helicopters that have been acquired by the Ministry of Tourism to
undertake the exercise, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
It quoted Tourism Minister Anoshi Chipawa as saying here on
Sunday that the tourism sector has been invaded by a lot of
poachers after the national parks were left without game guards
following their retrenchment by the Zambia Wildlife Authority (
ZAWA) in January this year.
</P>
<P>
The minister condemned the manner in which ZAWA conducted the
retrenchment, saying the game guards should have been spared in
order to guarantee the safety of animals in the parks.
</P>
<P>
Chipawa, who did not name the species of animals that are being
targeted by poachers, said Zambia can not afford to continue
losing animals in the parks because the tourism sector is
dependent on wildlife.
</P>
<P>
Poaching, if allowed to continue, would reduce the number of
tourists to the country, he warned.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Times of Zambia newspaper reported that the
elephant population in the country has gone down from 250,000 in
1992 to 20,000 last year because of indiscriminate killing of
prime animals.

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Sell State-Run Railway Corporation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Zambia will sell its railway
corporation to local or international buyers with some
concessional terms, the Zambia Daily Mail newspaper reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Privatization Agency (ZPA) was quoted as saying that the
sale of Zambia Railways Limited will be advertised locally and
internationally this month.
</P>
<P>
According to ZPA, loss of traffic from fellow state-owned
enterprises because of economic reform, lack of funding from the
government and excess capacity in the transport sector are the
main reasons for the privatization of the railway corporation.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian government expects to tap private sector funds to
induce investments in the corporation's infrastructure and
equipment to improve efficiency, increase capacity and ensure
quality service.

BERLIN -- As auction on universal mobile telecommunication

According to a report of the Bild newspaper Monday, Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder backed Finance Minister Hans Eichel on devoting
all the proceeds from the sale to slashing national debt. Up to
last Friday, bidders have offered more than 63 billion Deutsche
marks (29 billion U.S. dollars) for UMTS licenses. If all the
money goes to national debt reduction, the federal government is
expected to save 3 billion marks (1.39 billion dollars) in
interest payment. But Edmund Stoiber, governor of Bavarian state
and chairman of the opposition Christian Social Union, maintained
that the money should be used to further reduce the tax rate on
personal income. (Germany-Cellphone)

<HEADLINE> Lieberman Promises To Obey Gore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Democratic vice presidential
candidate Joseph Lieberman Sunday minimized his differences with
Al Gore but said that if the two ever disagreed in office, Gore
would decide and he would obey.
</P>
<P>
"I know how it works. When he and I disagree, he wins," the two-
term Connecticut senator told "Fox News Sunday".
</P>
<P>
In a Sunday television interview, Lieberman was pressed hard on
his opinion about his differences on a number of issues with Gore.
</P>
<P>
Republicans have jumped on Lieberman's record as a centrist as
a sign that he was more in tune with Republican presidential
candidate George W. Bush on school vouchers, affirmative action
and campaign finance than with his own Democratic presidential
running mate.
</P>
<P>
But Lieberman said Republicans had exaggerated his differences
with Gore and misstated his position on the crucial question of
whether the Social Security retirement program should be
privatized.
</P>
<P>
Lieberman said he and Gore agreed on the vast majority of
issues, but continued to disagree on school vouchers.
</P>
<P>
But he said ultimately, "after the internal debates that Al (
Gore) and I have, his position will be my position. That's
constitutionally necessary."
</P>
<P>
On the entertainment industry, despite its heavy contributions
to the Democratic Party and close relationship to the Clinton
administration, Lieberman reiterated his call for less sex and
violence in the movies and on television.
</P>
<P>
Lieberman, a two-term U.S. senator from Connecticut, is the
first Jewish politician to run on a major U.S. political ticket.
</P>
<P>
Gore campaign chairman William Daley said public opinion polls
showed most "American people have no problem in voting for a
Jewish candidate," but it remained to be seen how voters would
respond in November. "We'll find out," Daley said.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts believe that Lieberman's selection by
Democratic presidential hopeful Al Gore is testing the extent to
which U.S. voters are comfortable with the idea of a Jew holding
the nation's second-highest post -- one in which he would assume
the presidency should the commander-in-chief die in office.
</P>
<P>
Appearing on CNN's "Larry King Live" earlier this week,
Lieberman rejected suggestions that his religion would influence
his policies regarding Israel.
</P>
<P>
"In my work in the Senate, and if I am honored and fortunate
enough to become the vice president of the United States, my first
and primary loyalty is, of course, to the United States of America,
" Lieberman said.

<HEADLINE> China Reduces Timber Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 14 (Xinhua) -- China's timber production is
declining along with the implementation of national key ecological
projects, including the protection of natural forests.
</P>
<P>
China will reduce timber output by six million cubic meters
annually until 2010, with big diametric timber from natural
forests taking a lion's share, an official with the State Forestry
Administration (SFA) said today.
</P>
<P>
China produced 53.26 million cubic meters of timber in 1999,
down 12.2 percent from 1998. Timber output was 6.54 million cubic
meters less than last year.
</P>
<P>
It is predicted that China needs 260 million cubic meters of
wood this year, 118 million more than the domestic supply and
imports combined. The demand-supply gap will be enlarged to 33
million cubic meters in the following decade.
</P>
<P>
To ensure timber supply, China has stepped up efforts to build
forestry centers nationwide, including some fast-growing and
fertile wood, rare species of wood and wood used for industrial
materials, mainly in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the
middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River and southern China's
collectively-owned forests, according to SFA Director Wang Zhibao.

<HEADLINE> Unilever Becomes 1st Foreign Firm to Plant Trees in Three Gorges Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of local villagers in
southwest China's Chongqing City braved heavy rains last Saturday
to attend a ceremony for the start of a tree-planting progrom
funded by Unilever, the world's largest manufacturer of daily
necessities from Europe.
</P>
<P>
Unilever is the first international company to plant trees in
the Three Gorges area in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River,
where the mammoth Three Gorges Hydraulic Project is located.
</P>
<P>
At the ceremony, Unilever (China) Co., Ltd. donated 100,000
yuan to the local government for planting 20,000 trees covering 40
ha. in Kaixian County, Chongqing.
</P>
<P>
Chen Zhi, a Chongqing government official in charge of
environmental protection along the Yangtze River, spoke highly of
Unilever's program and welcomed more foreign companies to follow
suit.
</P>
<P>
According to Unilever sources, the tree-planting project in the
Three Gorges is merely a small part of its five-year environmental
program launched this June, known as the "Unilever Living
Environment Initiative: Clean Water and Green Mountains for China".
</P>
<P>
In 2000, the first year for the five-year program, Unilever
will donate seven million yuan to plant 500,000 trees across the
country.
</P>
<P>
Kaixian, 83 km away from the Yangtze River, will have a big
part of its land submerged under water once the Three Gorges
Project is completed by 2009. More than 100,000 of local residents
will be relocated, accounting for one-tenth of the total to be
resettled by the dam project.
</P>
<P>
Since the launching of the Three Gorges Project in 1993, China'
s central and local governments have attached great importance to
the environmental protection in the Three Gorges area. A series of
polices and substantial measures have been adopted to deal with
the issue.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, efforts have been made to create greater publicity
among local people about the importance of environmental
protection.
</P>
<P>
In Kaixian, many primary school students are familiar with this
slogan: Never Forget Environmental Protect While Promoting
Cultural and Ethic Progress.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan President Rafiq Tarar
Monday asked New Delhi to keep in view the realities of the
Kashmir dispute, saying attempts at finding a settlement of the
issue sans Pakistan will "fail and create further complications."
</P>
<P>
In his address at the national flag-hoisting ceremony held in
the President House here to mark the country's 53rd Independence
Day, Tarar also reiterated Islamabad's commitment to "support the
Kashmiris politically, diplomatically and morally in their just
struggle."
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan, being a fundamental party to the Kashmir dispute,has
offered to hold a serious, purposeful and result-oriented dialogue
with the Indian leadership," he said. "India should keep in view
the ground and historical realities and demonstrate its sincerity
both in commitment and action for a resolution of the issue."
</P>
<P>
The president stressed that attempts at finding a settlement of
the Kashmir issue while isolating Pakistan will fail and give rise
to further complications.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the international community to uphold the
principles of truth and justice and contribute toward a resolution
of the Kashmir dispute on the basis of relevant U.N.resolutions
and in line with the aspirations of the Kashmiri people.
</P>
<P>
"If the U.N. resolutions are discriminated against as old and
new or if they are determined by the size of a state party to the
resolutions, the United Nations will lose its credibility," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Tarar warned that Kashmir, which has been a source of military
conflicts between Pakistan and India in the past, has become a
nuclear flash point
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, he stated, is a peace-loving country and believes in
a peaceful settlement of the Kashmir dispute. He added that his
country will welcome any efforts for a resolution of the issue"in
accordance with the will of the Kashmiri people."

<HEADLINE> Poor Funding Threatens Malaria Control: WHO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Poor funding for research into
more effective and cheaper drugs for malaria is a major threat to
the fight against the pandemic, the World Health Organization (WHO)
has said.
</P>
<P>
In an interview here on Sunday with The Herald newspaper,
senior WHO advisor to the Roll Back Malaria Project James Banda
said "the challenge we have is to convince the world that malaria
is a major problem which requires mobilizing a lot of money to
combat it."
</P>
<P>
According to Banda, despite it being preventable and curable,
malaria kills over 1 million people worldwide, 25 percent of them
in southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
"Malaria is considered a poor man's disease. But it is making
the poor countries poorer," Banda said.
</P>
<P>
For an effective campaign against malaria, the WHO adviser
advocated that the private sector has to be encouraged to do more
research on malaria.
</P>
<P>
Health experts estimated that if malaria had been eradicated 35
years ago, Africa's gross domestic product would be 32 percent
higher than it is today.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to reduce the disease's impact on economies, the
WHO southern African malaria control program will start Monday a
12-day meeting in Victoria Falls of Zimbabwe to find a long-term
solution to the malaria pandemic.

LOS ANGELES, August 13 (Xinhua) -- About 4,000 people marched
noisily but peacefully through Los Angeles on the eve of the
Democratic National Convention, demanding a new trial for former
Black Panther activist Mumia Abu-Jamal.
</P>
<P>
The march started at Pershing Square, about seven blocks from
the convention hall, where as many as 1,500 protesters had
gathered peacefully to listen to music and speeches from such
notables as actor Ed Asner, who called for a new trial for Abu-
Jamal.
</P>
<P>
Officers on motorcycles escorted demonstrators on their mile-
long route from the downtown area to the heavily fortified Staples
Center convention site along streets lined by police guarding
boarded-up stores, banks and business offices.
</P>
<P>
One person was arrested for vandalism but no injuries or
serious incidents were reported.
</P>
<P>
Abu-Jamal, who is on death row in Pennsylvania for the 1981
murder of a Philadelphia police officer, has become a cause
celebre of death penalty opponents worldwide. Earlier this month,
similar protests were also staged in Philadelphia where Republican
National Convention was held.
</P>
<P>
Both Al Gore and George W. Bush support the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
The rhetoric was stridently anti-establishment and the rally
attracted groups ranging from gay rights to animal rights
activists, as well as socialist workers and labor unions shouting
"Free Mumia."
</P>
<P>
Addressing the crowd between African drummers and a Latino rap
band, civil rights leader Jesse Jackson said, "There are more
police here than people. They should go catch the criminals and
set the people free."
</P>
<P>
Actor-activist Ed Asner said Abu-Jamal's case was "as important
as any in the history of this country."
</P>
<P>
Informed sources say the rally was the first of some 20
demonstrations planned for the week that have put police on full
alert.
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police, mindful of the 1992 riots that followed the
acquittal of four white officers for beating black motorist Rodney
King and currently embroiled in a major police corruption scandal,
are as anxious as the Democratic Party for the convention to go
well.

BEIDAIHE, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the
Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress (NPC),
said here Monday that Sino-U.S. relations, have generally
maintained an improving and developing trend this year thanks to
the joint efforts of the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remarks during a meeting with Bill Archer, member
of the U.S. House of Representatives from Texas and chairman of
the House Ways and Means Committee, at this summer resort some 300
kilometers away from Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Li appreciated Archer's active support over the past years for
the improvement and development of the China-U.S. relations, and
his efforts at the U.S. Congress in this regard.
</P>
<P>
A healthy and stable development of the relations between China
and the U.S. will serve the common interests of both countries and
peoples as well as the peace and stability of the region and the
entire world, Li Peng stated.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-U.S. relations, have generally maintained an improving
and developing trend since the beginning of this year thanks to
the joint efforts of the two sides, and progress has been made in
some areas in terms of cooperation and exchange, Li noted.

<P>
The NPC chairman said as China and the United States share
common interests on many issues, they should not let the
differences on some issues stand in the way of developing
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Archer said great changes have taken place since his last visit
to China in 1977. This demonstrated that China's policy of reform
and opening to the outside world is a successful one. He stressed
he has always stood for developing the friendly and cooperative
relations with China.
</P>
<P>
There is no reason why U.S. and China should become enemies, he
said. The two sides should enhance understanding and cooperation.
The internal affairs of a country should be decided upon by its
own people, and should not be interfered by any foreign powers.
Trade issues, in particular, should not become a "weapon" to
interfere in other countries' internal matters.
</P>
<P>
Over the past years, an increasing number of U.S. congressmen
have visited China, and NPC member delegations also visited the
United States. Li said that those visits have helped increase
mutual understanding, and such visits should continue.
</P>
<P>
China's NPC is willing to maintain and strengthen links with
the U.S. Congress so as to deepen mutual understanding, broaden
common ground and play positive role in helping improve and
develop the bilateral ties, Li Peng said.
</P>
<P>
Besides Beijing, the American guests are scheduled to visit
northwest China's Shaanxi province and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region.

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Because of the costly maintenance
expenses, the handover ceremony hall in the Macao Special
Administrative Region (SAR) is being dismantled.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the hall started in May last year and it had
been designed to be a temporary structure for the Chinese and
Portuguese governments to hold the ceremony marking Macao's power
transfer in last December.
</P>
<P>
From January 28 to March 28, the hall accommodated the presents
given to the Macao SAR by China's provincial governments and the
Hong Kong SAR government to mark Macao's return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
With the conclusion of the exhibition, the SAR government
invited some architectural specialists to study the feasibility of
hall's permanent preservation. The conclusion is negative.
</P>
<P>
Many residents and tourists said it is a great regret the
historic site cannot be preserved. However, official sources said
that a commemorative park featuring the theme of handover might be
built at the same site.
</P>
<P>
Over the past several months, streams of tourists and local
residents have flocked to the site to relish the atmosphere of
that solemn historic event which became a turning point for Macao.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Unlikely to Continue GSP Facilities to Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government is unlikely to
continue the Generalized System of Preference (GSP) facilities to
Bangladesh even the Bangladeshi government forms Workers' Welfare
Association in the country's export processing zones (EPZ), The
Bangladesh Observer reported here Monday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials in Washington indicated that it is against the
policy of the U.S. government to provide GSP facilities to a
country where workers' rights are not protected as per the
convention of International Labor Organization (ILO).
</P>
<P>
They were quoted as saying that prohibition of trade union
activities in two EPZs in Bangladesh is contradictory to the ILO
convention and to the fundamental rights of workers and employees
as well.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government is unable to continue GSP to Bangladesh if
trade unions are not allowed in EPZs, they added.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi government has already taken an initiative to
form Workers' Welfare Association in the EPZs instead of allowing
trade unions. The government is also trying hard to make the U.S.
government understand that the proposed welfare association will
protect workers' rights in the EPZs.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Bangladeshi Embassy in Washington told the
newspaper that they had already received a draft proposal on the
welfare association from Bangladesh. This draft would be handed
over to the U.S. authorities prior to the hearing on GSP for
Bangladesh which is scheduled for August 15.

SEOUL, August 14 (Xinhua) -- South Korea and the Democratic

MOSCOW, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The death toll in last Tuesday's

<P>
Seven people were killed at the scene of the explosion, which

Five of the wounded died later in hospital.

No one has claimed responsibility for the rush-hour attack, the
most powerful to hit the Russian capital this year, although some
officials immediately pointed their fingers at separatists of the
breakaway republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Last year, a series of explosions across Russia killed more

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scholar Deciphers Ancient Characters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Decoding ancient scripts seems to
be a boring and labor-cost work. But for Liu Huan, a reputed
expert on ancient characters, the work is interesting and "amazing
".
</P>
<P>
Liu, 55, who has been cudgeling his mind in deciphering
Jiaguwen, scripts on bones or tortoise shells of the Shang Dynasty
(16th--11th century B.C.), has over the past 30 years decoded some
100 difficult characters of the 3,000-year-old scripts.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists have found more than 5,000 ancient characters
inscribed on some 150,000 pieces of bones and tortoise shells.
Generations of experts have deciphered only about 2,000 characters.
</P>
<P>
Liu worked out new explanations on such difficult characters as
"zuo" (sit ) and "bai" (do obeisance), based on extensive study of
the Chinese ancient culture, mythologies, decrees and regulations,
inscriptions on bronze, and seal characters.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that it is hard to decipher those inscriptions
because thousands of years of evolution has brought about great
changes to the vocabulary, pronunciation, meaning, and grammar of
the ancient Chinese language.
</P>
<P>
Jiaguwen is the only ancient scripts still in use today, unlike
the cuneiform writing of the ancient Near East, the hieroglyphic
writing of ancient Egypt, and Mayan writing used by Indians, which
have all died away.
</P>
<P>
Liu has never gotten tired of the study. "It's like
communicating with the ancient people," he said. "The more
characters I decipher, the more I learn about their writers. It's
just amazing," he added.

<HEADLINE> 5,000 MBA Graduates Trained in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 14 (Xinhua) -- China has churned out some 5,000
MBA (masters of business administration) graduates during the past
decade, the Beijing-based national newspaper China Daily reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Put on trial in early 1980s, MBA Program was formally
introduced in China in 1990, when 86 candidates were enrolled into
nine authorized universities.
</P>
<P>
Nine years later, China already has 4,988 MBA graduates from 56
business schools which are scattering in its 19 provinces and
municipalities, .
</P>
<P>
"MBAs are now big business," the paper said, proving the
argument with the fact that 35,416 university graduates with a
minimum of two years' work experience will sit for this year's MBA
entrance examination and about 12,000 will be enrolled.
</P>
<P>
In tandem with the national training program for business
leaders of State-owned enterprises, China kicked off the executive
MBA (EMBA) system in 1997. Latest statistics show that China had 6,
178 EMBA students by the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
MBA degree holders are generally properly treated in the
country. 78.5 percent of them have been promoted and 33 percent
have become top business leaders. And 75 percent of them said they
are satisfactory with their current positions.
</P>
<P>
To further develop MBA program, the MBA Committee has mapped
out several regulations to standardize the MBA education around
the country and a quaternary check-up system will be set up.
</P>
<P>
Viewing a faculty of both rich teaching and practice experience
as the key to MBA education, China has set its mind to improving
the quality of teachers. From 1995 to 1997 a nationwide training
program covering all MBA courses was given to MBA teachers.
</P>
<P>
Many MBA-offering schools have teamed up with foreign
counterparts to improve their teaching standards and to gear their
education with international practice.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, more than 10 business schools have their own joint
MBA programs and offer diplomas from foreign educational
institutions.

PHNOM PENH, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Households in Phnom Penh and
Krandal province who use more than an average amount of
electricity will have to pay extra fees, the Cambodia Daily
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Under the new pricing system, residential customers who use
more than 50 kilowatt hours a month will have to pay an extra 200
to 300 riel (3800 riel=1 U.S. dollar for every kilowatt hour, Ty
Norin, director of planning at Electricite du Cambodge, was quoted

<P>
Residential customers now pay a rate of 350 riel per kilowatt
hour, about 0.02 dollar less than the actual cost of the
electricity.

who use more than 100 kilowatt hour will pay 650 riel, Ty Norin
said.

hours a month will be charged on a sliding scale, with small
businesses paying 650 riel per kilowatt hour and heavy industry
paying 480 riel.
</P>
<P>
Ty Norin said the new prices will mean households and business
will share electricity costs more fairly, while the poorest
families will still enjoy low rates.

<HEADLINE> Nuclear Bomb Feared in Sea Off Greenland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, August 13 (Xinhua) -- A nuclear bomb is believed to
be under sea off the Greenland archipelago, the Jyllands-Posten
newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The bomb was dropped when an American B-52 bomber, loaded with
four nuclear bombs, crashed in 1968. Only three bombs were found
after the accident. However, Washington claimed afterwards that
the plane wreckage and the nuclear bombs had all been cleared up.
</P>
<P>
The conclusion was drawn by former employees of the Greenland
Thule Air Base. Documents they owned indicate that an unexploded
nuclear bomb is still sleeping on the seabed near the Thule Air
Base in the northwest of the archipelago.
</P>
<P>
The news came out only a week before American representatives
go to Greenland for negotiations on using the Thule Air Base for
the deployment of a controversial U.S. national missile defense
system.
</P>
<P>
Major Greenland politicians are opposed to the inclusion of the
Thule base in the missile defense scheme.

<HEADLINE> Olympics Organizers to Issue Free Passes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Free passes to games precincts
will be issued to non-ticket holders although more than 1.5
million Olympic tickets remain on sale.
</P>
<P>
The organisers plan to release 420,000 free passes, including
about 370,000 passes available for Sydney Olympic Park at Homebush
Bay, which houses a hub of venues.
</P>
<P>
Olympics Minister Michael Knight said in a statement that
though there are still plenty of cheap tickets to events at Sydney
Olympic Park, they recognize the need to continue to provide free
public access to the area.
</P>
<P>
Unlike previous Olympics, the main concentration of Olympic
stadiums is surrounded by a common security fence and only people
who hold tickets or passes will be allowed to enter the precinct.
</P>
<P>
Organizers have come under fire for trying to restrict entry to
games precincts to non ticket-holders, leading to a compromise on
the free passes.
</P>
<P>
The passes do not allow access to any stadium but include free
public transport. They would be available on nine days between
Sept. 13 and the closing ceremony.

<HEADLINE> World Records Remain Intact after Fifth-day U.S. Olympic Trials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 13 (Xinhua) -- After 16 out of 26 finals
competed in the U.S. Olympic swimming trials, all the world
records remain intact despite a string of teenagers and veterans
have qualified for the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Neil Walker, 24, claimed the men's 100m freestyle crown in 48.
71 seconds, namely half a second behind the world record of 48.21
set by Russian legendary swimmer Alexender Popov six years ago in
Monte Carlo.
</P>
<P>
Gary Hall also qualified as he finished second in 48.84,
beating Scott Tucker to a close third in 48.95.
</P>
<P>
Sabir Muhammad, 24, failed again in his bid to become the first
African American in the Olympic swimming team as he finished last
in 51.00 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Another teenager Kyle Salyards, 19, swam the fastest in the men
's 200m breaststroke in 2:13.21, a far cry from his compatriot
Mike Barrowman's world record of 2:10.16, set in the 1992
Barcelona Games.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old Tom Wilkens finished second in 2:13.34, while
Brendan Hansen was in third in 2:13.49.
</P>
<P>
Misty Hyman became the winner in the women's 200m butterfly by
clocking in 2:09.27, another huge gap behind the world mark of 2:
05.81, set up by Australia's Susan O'Neill in May.
</P>
<P>
Without the absence of Jenny Thompson, who won the 100m
butterfly earlier, Kaitlin Sandeno claimed the second Olympic spot
by finishing in 2:09.54.
</P>
<P>
As the trials completed its fifth-day competitions, only 10
finals remained to be contested with the first world record still
waiting to be surpassed in Indianapolis.

<HEADLINE> 100 Films to be Shown at Changchun Film Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, August 14 (Xinhua) -- A total of 91 films have so
far been confirmed to participate in the Fifth China Changchun
Film Festival scheduled to open from August 23 to 26.
</P>
<P>
According to Hu Donghui, vice-chairman of the festival's
organizing committee, of the 91 films, 70 are in the Chinese
language, including 45 from China's mainland, 12 from China's Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region and 13 from China's Taiwan
province.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 21 are from the United States, France, Spain and
Japan and other foreign countries, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
All the films were produced since the year 1998, some of which
have won wide international attention and some have become great
success in ticket-booking, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
Since it is still 10 days ahead of the festival, Hu predicted
that the number of participating films will exceed 100, a record
number in the festival's history.
</P>
<P>
First held in 1992 and once every two years since then, the
festival, together with the Shanghai Film Festival, has been
considered one of the two major film festivals in China.

<HEADLINE> German Politicians Debate How to Use Income from UMTS Auction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, August 13 (Xinhua) -- As auction on universal mobile
telecommunication system (UMTS) is still going on in Germany,
politicians have started debating how to use the income from
selling licenses of the third general mobile phone frequency.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of the Bild newspaper Monday, Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder backed Finance Minister Hans Eichel on devoting
all the proceeds from the sale to slashing national debt.
</P>
<P>
Up to last Friday, bidders have offered more than 63 billion
Deutsche marks (29 billion U.S. dollars) for UMTS licenses. If all
the money goes to national debt reduction, the federal government
is expected to save 3 billion marks (1.39 billion dollars) in
interest payment.
</P>
<P>
But Edmund Stoiber, governor of Bavarian state and chairman of
the opposition Christian Social Union, maintained that the money
should be used to further reduce the tax rate on personal income.
</P>
<P>
"This should not happen that Eichel's pocket is full of money
and that he now reduces the tax rate for corporations, but not for
the normal taxpayers," Stoiber told the Bild's Sunday edition.
</P>
<P>
Adolf Roth, vice chairman of the budget committee of the
Bundestag (lower house of parliament) and a member of the main
opposition Christian Democratic Union, suggested that the income
should be used to reduce tax burdens, such as the solidarity fee,
which is paid by individuals and companies to support the former
East German region.
</P>
<P>
Even in the coalition government, there are different voices on
how to use the savings from the interest payment. Eichel proposed
that the savings be invested in education and transportation
improvement, while Environment Minister Juergen Trittin, who is
from the Green Party, called for investment in energy-saving
research.

<HEADLINE> China Reports Rise in Coal Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 14 (Xinhua) -- China's coal export soared 44.8
percent in the first six months to 25.88 million tons, compared to
the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the State Coal Industry Administration said that
rising exports have become a leading force promoting the industry
and using up some of the country's surplus coal.
</P>
<P>
The sources attributed the rapid export growth to the
government's measures to encourage exports in order to cut down
the stockpile in the domestic market, according to today's China
Daily.
</P>
<P>
The country plans to sell 46.1 million tons of coal abroad this
year, compared with 38 million tons in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government has achieved some success in closing
small mines and reducing total coal production.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of the year, the country produced 451.62
million tons of coal, down by 39.83 million tons, or 8.11 percent
from last year.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to this shrinking production, the country's overstock of
coal should be reduced by 27.66 million tons to reach 152.54
million tons in six months time.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, in some areas, especially in east China, serious
oversupply has been eased and coal prices have gone up, China
Daily said.

<HEADLINE> Price War Hurts Beijing's Gold Market: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Industrial insiders are worried about the cuts and want the
government to get involved to stimulate the industry.
</P>
<P>
In the past three weeks, dealers in Beijing have cut their
prices one after another as they struggle to sell their products
and compete for market share.
</P>
<P>
Most gold jewelry prices in Beijing are down to less than 90
yuan per gram from more than 92 yuan. The lowest price is 87 yuan
per gram.
</P>
<P>
Roland Wang, a manager of the World Gold Council (North China),
said the price cuts are a move by dealers to promote sales off
season.
</P>
<P>
But the move reduces the profits of both the dealers and
producers, and is not a good way forward, Wang said. "From a long-
term perspective, the price war is harmful to the future
development of the gold jewelry producers and dealers."
</P>
<P>
He urged producers to make different types of jewelry that more
people will want to buy.
</P>
<P>
And he said changes in the pricing mechanism are necessary to
encourage the industry to produce more higher quality and
expensive gold jewelry.
</P>
<P>
The prices basically fluctuate in line with gold bullion prices
set by the People's Bank of China, the central bank. The current
gold bullion selling price is 77.8 yuan per gram.
</P>
<P>
Wang said price reform would stimulate demand for the precious
metal as the jewelry takes the lion's share of gold consumption on
the Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
Government officials admit price reform is a pressing task.
</P>
<P>
Pilot reform has begun in east China's Jiangsu and Zhejiang
provinces and in Shanghai Municipality.

<HEADLINE> System Puts Criminals at Police Fingertips </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Fingerprints of 10 million
Chinese who have been arrested for criminal behavior in the past
have been compiled in a computer database, which will be
accessible to police online in 21 provinces across the country.
</P>
<P>
According to today's China Daily, police had solved about 1,000
criminal cases last year by using the database, developed by the
Beijing Institute of Criminal Science, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 million yuan (about 12.1 million U.S. dollars) in
economic losses have been saved and 10,000 criminal cases have
been solved with help from the system, according to Zhu Qiang, the
institute's director.
</P>
<P>
China began fingerprinting suspected criminals in the 1950s,
but the method was performed by hand until the 1990s, which often
resulted in low efficiency, according to the paper.

<HEADLINE> Feature: World Librarians Proactive to Meet Internet Challenges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Zhong Cuihua
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 14 (Xinhua) -- "There is a big gap between us
and the developed countries, but we have started," Matilda Amissah-
Arthur from Ghana Library Association said on Monday, excited about
what changes internet can bring to the library society.
</P>
<P>
Like most librarians attending the 66th General Conference of
the International Federation of Library Association (ILFA) and
Institutions here, Amissah-Arthur embraces the internet and is
proactive to explore the possibilities that the hi-tech provides
and to meet its challenges.
</P>
<P>
"Now we have eight ISPs (Internet Service Providers) and about
10,000 individual internet users in Ghana. We have been trying a
lot on ways to popularize the use of computers and internet by
organizing workshops and training courses," Amissah-Arthur told
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Coming from the western African country with a population of 18
million, Amissah-Arthur is well aware of the potential benefits
internet can bring about, but she stressed that people must
understand the internet well in order to make good use of it.
</P>
<P>
"It (the internet) is a good thing for developing countries if
you really understand it and know what to do with it," she said.
</P>
<P>
Sandro Karumidze, director of the Internet Center of Open
Society-Georgia Foundation, said one of the big challenges his
country is facing is to have internet in the Georgian language so
as to have more Georgian information online.
</P>
<P>
"The problem is to have automation of our libraries and to put
libraries on the internet as well so as to make it easier for
people to search for information which is available in Georgian
libraries," Karumidze said.
</P>
<P>
The young Georgian professional admits that so far there are too
few computers in his country and there is not enough financial
support. This, as he sees it, highlights the advantage of having
access to the internet since libraries, which cannot afford to buy
enough magazines and books, can search a lot of information through
the internet.
</P>
<P>
Siew Kim Tan from Singapore National Library Board told Xinhua
that the Singaporeans have been making great efforts to promote the
use of computers among people from all walks of life.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that the internet is changing the lives of
people, Tan also believes that libraries have a role which is
irreplaceable both at present and in the future. Rather, internet
and libraries can mutually reinforce each other.
</P>
<P>
"Although people can find lots of information on the internet,
they need to be careful because they can never be sure whether the
sources are reliable." On the other hand, Tan said "the library is
a place where people can have social interaction and whose
environment is more conducive to reading."
</P>
<P>
Thereby, the Singaporean government is planning to build more
libraries to better cater to the needs of residents.
</P>
<P>
Elaborating on the advantages of internet, Tan said "we can also
supplement our resources by getting information from internet.
There are a lot of resources we can use on internet, which are fast
and up-to-date."
</P>
<P>
Professor Michael Koenig from Long Island University in the
United States sees knowledge management as a very important topic
that should be addressed in the information era. "It is easy to
find information but it is not easy to find relevant information
you need. One has to use the knowledge navigator."
</P>
<P>
With the use of internet, said Professor Koenig, "librarians
have become less insular and they need to change from the
traditional role of organizing libraries to organizing electronic
resources on the internet."
</P>
<P>
"The change is immediate and will ultimately change the whole
world. The need will be even greater as there are more and more
resources needed to be organized on the internet," he added.
</P>
<P>
The week-long conference whose opening plenum was held Monday at
Jerusalem's International Conference Center, attracted 1,800
librarians from 80 countries. The event, however, was boycotted by
Arab countries which were opposed to holding the conference in the
still controversial city.
</P>
<P>
Due to the boycotting of Arab nations, the conference entitled "
Information for Cooperation: Creating the Global Library of the
Future," seemed to have acquired some political color.
</P>
<P>
Sixteen Israeli singers were invited to sing songs of peace at
Monday's opening plenum and speakers could not help mentioning the
fact that the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks have entered a
critical stage.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Minister of Regional Cooperation Shimon Peres, who was
supposed to deliver a keynote speech on Monday's ceremony, failed
to show up as he was on a tour to some Asian countries to explain
the Israeli positions on the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
In the proceedings of the conference, seen as the largest event
in the Holy City this year, the impact of growing, high-technology,
international communication on libraries and librarianship is
expected to be emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening plenum, head of the Israeli organizing
committee for the conference, Professor Sarah Japhet said "our
great aspiration is to turn the world into one great library."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says not Involved in Russian Submarine Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Monday that no signs showed that any U.S. naval vessels were
involved in the accident of a Russian submarine in the Barents Sea.
</P>
<P>
Russian officials said Submarine Kursk, with a crew of more
than 100, was apparently involved in a major collision in the
Barents sea, and sustained serious damage.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon said that there was a U.S. Navy electronic
surveillance ship operating in the Barents sea, but would not said
whether a U.S. submarine was in the area.
</P>
<P>
"We have no indication that a U.S. vessel was involved in this
accident," Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. Craig Quigley said.
</P>
<P>
he would not comment on whether any U.S. submarines were in the
vicinity of the Kursk at the time of the accident, only saying
that the U.S. Navy electronic surveillance ship was in the general
area "a long way away" from the Kursk.
</P>
<P>
U.S. submarines normally monitor the movement of Russian
submarines. It was even more likely in this case because of the
size of the Russian naval exercise, which Pentagon officials
described as the largest of the year.
</P>
<P>
Quigley said the U.S. military had not been asked to assist in
a potential rescue of the Russian crew.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Security Council Backs Large U.N. Peacekeeping Force for Horn of Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Monday endorsed proposals by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to
establish a large peacekeeping force to monitor the June 18 accord
to halt the two-year border conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
The Council members voiced the endorsement in an initial open
debate on the proposal made by Annan on Friday last week. But they
stressed that a cease-fire was not enough as the two Horn of
Africa nations must forge a genuine peace and that planned U.N.
force could not remain indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
Chen Xu, representative of the Chinese Mission to the United
Nations, told the Security Council meeting that Annan's report was
clear and specific on the U.N. Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea,
and his proposal has generated a good framework to promote the
peace process between the two neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
"It is our hope that the Security Council, on the basis of the
contacts with Ethiopia, Eritrea and the Organization of African
Unity (OAU), can take actions on the secretary-general's proposal
at an early date in order to officially determine the number of
the Mission staff and its mandate," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Annan, in his report to the Security Council last Friday,
proposed establishing a 4,200-strong U.N. peacekeeping force to
monitor an accord halting a two-year border war between Ethiopia
and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief proposed turning this into a full-scale
military force of up to 4,200-strong personnel, including 220
military observers, three infantry battalions and support units,
such as logistical, medical and support staff.
</P>
<P>
Andrei Granovsky, representative of Russia, said, "It is
important that the detailed proposals on peacekeeping operations
contained in the secretary-general's report are based on the June
18 Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities and the conclusions
of the United Nations reconnaissance mission to the region."
</P>
<P>
Martin Andjaba, Namibian permanent representative to the
United Nations, said, "the June 18 signing of the Agreement on the
Cessation of Hostilities between the Governments of Ethiopia and
Eritrea have been a major step towards peaceful resolution of the
conflict."
</P>
<P>
The Namibian ambassador called on the two parties "to continue
to demonstrate in good faith for the sake of peace, development
and prosperity, not only for the two nations, but also for Africa
as a whole."
</P>
<P>
Tesfa Alem Seyoum, charge d'affaires of the Eritrean Mission
to the United Nations, told the Security Council it was meeting "
at a time when a vast sovereignty territory of the state of
Eritrea has been invaded and occupied by neighboring Ethiopia,
with impunity, since last May."
</P>
<P>
Welcoming Annan's proposal for a full-fledged U.N.
peacekeeping force, the senior Eritrean diplomat said that more
than one million of his countrymen were internally displaced and
some 95,000 others had fled to Sudan "as a result of Ethiopia's
invasion which was aimed at destroying the small nation of Eritrea
and the dignity of its people."
</P>
<P>
Fesseha Tessema of Ethiopia, who also voiced his satisfaction
with the main elements of Annan's report, agreed with speakers who
said that the war should never happen again.
</P>
<P>
"Our conscience is clear. Not only were we victims of blatant
aggression but also our government and our people gave their best
try to end it peacefully," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia and Eritrea, under the auspices of the OAU, signed in
the June 18 cease-fire accord in Algiers to halt a conflict that
has uprooted more than 1 million people.
</P>
<P>
Annan sent the reconnaissance mission to the Horn of Africa
region and hammered out his report on the basis of the
observations of the mission.
</P>
<P>
In his report, Annan also proposed that the mission monitor
the redeployment of Ethiopian forces to the positions they had
held on May 6, 1998, as well as the position of Eritrean forces,
which are to remain 25 kilometers away from the redeployed
Ethiopian forces.
</P>
<P>
 Ethiopia and Eritrea have been locked in a border conflict
since May 6, 1998, with sporadic fighting costing the two Horn of
African nations tens of thousands of lives and millions of U.S.
dollars in armaments.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea, an Italian colony until World War Two, was an
Ethiopian province until 1993, when it became independent with
Ethiopian support.
</P>
<P>
Fighting which first broke out along 965-kilometer border in
1998 flared up again in May this year, with each side accusing the
other of seizing disputed territory.
</P>
<P>
The situation has been worsened by a severe drought in the
region which the Ethiopian government estimates has left more than
10 million of its people in need of emergency food aid.
</P>
<P>
"The people of Eritrea and Ethiopia have suffered terrible
losses during two long years of war," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
On July 31, the Security Council approved an advance part of
up to 100 military observers, called the U.N. Mission in Ethiopia
and Eritrea (UNMEE), to maintain liaison between the two sides and
help prepare for a full-scale peacekeeping operation.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Ready to Help in Russian Submarine Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Monday that it was ready to help rescue crippled Russian submarine,
which was collided earlier in the Barents Sea.
</P>
<P>
"We through various channels have made clear to the Russians
that any assistance we can offer is available," White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters in Los Angles where the
Democrats were going to hold their convention.
</P>
<P>
But he said Washington had not been asked for any kind of
assistance from Russians.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton was briefed on the accident earlier in
the morning and National Security adviser Sandy Berger
communicated the U.S. offer in a previously scheduled conversation
with his Russian counterparts, Lockhart said. But Washington had
not been asked yet for any kind of assistance from Russians.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Pentagon told a briefing that no U.S. naval
vessels were involved in the accident of the Russian Submarine
Kursk in the Barents Sea.
</P>
<P>
Russian officials said Submarine Kursk, with a crew of more
than 100, was apparently involved in a major collision in the
Barents sea, and sustained serious damage.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. Craig Quigley told reporters that
there was a U.S. Navy electronic surveillance ship operating in
the Barents sea.
</P>
<P>
"We have no indication that a U.S. vessel was involved in this
accident," Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. Craig Quigley said.
</P>
<P>
he would not comment on whether any U.S. submarines were in the
vicinity of the Kursk at the time of the accident, only saying
that the U.S. Navy electronic surveillance was in the general area
"a long way away" from the Kursk.
</P>
<P>
U.S. submarines normally monitor the movement of Russian
submarines. It was even more likely to do so in this case because
of the size of the Russian naval exercise, which Pentagon
officials described as the largest of the year.
</P>
<P>
Quigley said the U.S. military had not been asked to assist in
a potential rescue of the Russian crew.

<HEADLINE> Arctic Temperatures Warmest in Four Centuries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Arctic temperatures in the
late 20th century were the warmest in four centuries and have been
accompanied by a variety of other environmental changes, according
to a new study.
</P>
<P>
Funded by the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Office of
Polar Programs and Division of Atmospheric Sciences, the new study
examined air temperature measurements, atmospheric circulation
observations, precipitation data, snow cover and snow depth
records.
</P>
<P>
The study also included sea ice measurements, ocean structure
data, permafrost temperature observations, glacier mass balances,
plant growth observations and carbon flux measurements, Science
Daily reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
In some of the northernmost regions of the world, temperatures
have warmed alarmingly in a very short period, according to
climate data.
</P>
<P>
Parts of Alaska and northern Eurasia, for example, have warmed
by nearly 6 degrees Celsius in the winter months over the past 30
years.
</P>
<P>
"It is undeniable that a major warming is affecting the Arctic
environment," said Michael T. Ledbetter, NSF's Arctic System
Science Program Director.
</P>
<P>
"Our study validates climate-model results that predict the
Arctic will be among the first regions on Earth to respond to a
global warming trend," said Serreze, a leading scientist of the
study. "Given what we are seeing, continued monitoring of this
region is crucial."

<HEADLINE> World Leaders Invited to Witness Signing of Burundi Peace Deal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 15 (Xinhua) -- About 24 heads of state
have been invited to witness the historic signing ceremony of the
Burundi peace agreement scheduled in Tanzania's northern town of
Arusha on August 28.
</P>
<P>
According to sources close to the Mwalimu Nyerere Foundation,
which has been facilitating the talks for the last two years, most
leaders have agreed to attend the ceremony, which is expected to
bring a new hope to end the seven-year ethnic civil war in the
central African state.
</P>
<P>
Those invited to witness the signing included President Bill
Clinton of the United States and former South African president
Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton earlier this year spoke to Burundi delegates
via satellite hook-up from Washington, urging them to redouble
peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
The sources said an advanced team of the U.S. President has
already arrived in Arusha.
</P>
<P>
Public relation officials of the U.S. embassy here said that
Clinton had received the invitation but they refused to confirm
whether he has accepted it or not.
</P>
<P>
Other invited leaders are from Libya, Algeria, Belgium,
Botswana, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Nigeria,
Ghana, Swaziland, Kenya, Togo, Mali, Mozambique, Rwanda, Saudi
Arabia, South Africa, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Lesotho and host
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The Organization of African Unity and the United Nations will
also send high-powered delegations to the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
More than 200,000 Burundians, most of them civilians, have been
killed in the ethnic war between the minority Tutsis and the
majority Hutus since 1993. The Tutsis, who account for about 14
percent of the total population, are dominating the national army
and economy of the land-locked country.

<HEADLINE> S.Leone Welcomes UN Decision to Set Up Special Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The Sierra Leonean government has
welcomed a United Nations' decision to help set up an
international special court to put on trial the rebels who killed
thousands of civilians during the country's nine-year-old civil
war, according to reports reaching here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leonean President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah was quoted as
saying in the capital Freetown that the UN decision had sent a
clear message to perpetrators that collective action was now being
taken to end the problems in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
The UN decision was a historical step "toward the establishment
of justice and peace in Sierra Leone", said Kabbah in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The UN Security Council on Monday voted unanimously to accept a
request from Kabbah's government for UN help in setting up a
special court to try those charged with war crimes and crimes
against humanity during the civil war.
</P>
<P>
Although the UN resolution did not name any particular rebel or
group, the Sierra Leonean government has made it clear that the
rebel Revolutionary United Front leader Foday Sankoh and his
followers would be brought to justice.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh, who has been under government custody in a secret place
since his arrest on May 17 by the government forces, is held
responsible for the abduction of about 500 UN peacekeepers in May.

<HEADLINE> OAU Chief Urges Zanzibaris to Maintain Peace in Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Salim Ahmed Salim,
secretary-general of the Organization of African Unity (OAU),
Tuesday urged Zanzibaris to ease political tension as they prepare
for the general elections scheduled on October 29.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival at the Dar es Salaam International Airport,
the OAU chief, himself a Zanzibari, said although tension is
normal when elections are approaching, people must be ready to
accept and respect democratic principals.
</P>
<P>
He called on Zanzibaris contesting the elections to be prepared
to concede defeat and continue to assist the new government in
improving the welfare of the people who he said are still poor.
</P>
<P>
"We must understand that there are always different views, but
national interests are more important," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Salim admitted that the Indian Ocean Isles, which is a semi-
autonomous region of Tanzania, has a long history of political
arguments and misunderstandings. But, the OAU chief said, he
believes one day lasting peace must be realized.
</P>
<P>
He lauded the two candidates vying for the presidential
position in Zanzibar in the upcoming elections, Amani Karume on
the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) ticket and Seif Hamad
representing the opposition Civic United Front (CUF) for their
civilized dialogs in a recent call-in interview organized by the
British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC).
</P>
<P>
Salim urged other Zanzibaris, especially CCM and CUF followers
to follow their suit.
</P>
<P>
Political tension has been rising high in Zanzibar since the
voting registration exercise started on August 8, forcing the
government to enhance security in the Isles.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar joined with mainland Tanganyika to form the United
Republic of Tanzania in 1964. But it has its own government and
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar's CCM, under President Salmin Amour, claimed a narrow
victory over the CUF in the 1995 elections, but the CUF questioned
the result.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Mine Workers End Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 15 (Xinhua) -- President of Associated Mine
Workers of Zimbabwe Jeffrey Mutandare Tuesday said that striking
workers will go back to work on Wednesday following agreements
with employers on their grievances.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that the Public Service, Labor and Social
Welfare Ministry had helped settle the dispute in accordance with
the Labor Relations Act.
</P>
<P>
"The ministry has intervened to settle the matter and has
ordered employers to pay the workers the agreed minimum wage
increases," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president said the workers were against the system in which
there was no uniformity on the awarding of minimum wages
increments to the workers.
</P>
<P>
The workers, who earned a minimum wage of 39 U.S. dollars a
month, complained that their employers were using their own
discretion to award individual workers minimum wage increases.
</P>
<P>
The employers said they have lost millions of dollars due to
the two-day strike by their workers.

<HEADLINE> Summit on Congo Reaffirms Support for Ceasefire Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Wang Nengbiao
</P>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The summit aimed at putting the
peace process back on track in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo (DRC) ended here early Tuesday morning with a final
communique reaffirming its strong support for the Lusaka
ceasefire agreement as the only accepted and viable basis for
resolving the two-year conflict in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
With regard to ceasefire violations, the summit, which started
on Monday, regretted the fact that ceasefire violations have
persisted.
</P>
<P>
The summit, which lasted over successive 18 hours, affirmed the
validity of the Kampala plan adopted on April 8 of this year for
the disengagement and redeployment of forces as the appropriate
framework for addressing ceasefire violations.
</P>
<P>
The summit attended by all the signatories of the Lusaka
agreement welcomed the initiative of Rwanda to withdraw 200
kilometers from the position declared in the disengagement plan
and all the parties reaffirmed their commitment to beginning or
proceeding with the withdrawals of at least 15 kilometers from
their declared positions in conformity with the plan.
</P>
<P>
The parties committed themselves not to taking advantage of the
withdrawals by occupying the vacated areas.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of deployment of the United Nations military
observers, the summit welcomed the readiness of the U.N. to
commence such deployment but acknowledged that existing conditions
in the DRC have not made it possible for the deployment to begin.
</P>
<P>
The summit therefore appealed to the government of the DRC to
cooperate fully with the U.N. Organization Mission so as to
satisfy the conditions necessary for the speedy deployment of the
military observers.
</P>
<P>
The summit expressed serious concern about the critical
shortage of resources for the Joint Military Committee (JMC), in
particular funds to meet operational costs as well as for
essential equipment to enable the JMC to carry out its mandate of
verifying ceasefire violations and monitoring the implementation
of the ceasefire agreement signed one year ago.
</P>
<P>
To this effect, the summit made an earnest appeal to the
international community to urgently make available adequate
resources to the JMC set up under the ceasefire agreement.
</P>
<P>
Regarding inter-Congolese political negotiations, the summit
addressed the difficulties that had stalled the facilitation. In
this connection, the summit, with the exception of the DRC
government, reaffirmed its full support for the facilitator,
Botswana's former President Ketumile Masire.
</P>
<P>
An appeal was made to the DRC government to reconsider its
decision in order to ensure the speedy finalization of
arrangements for the convening of the national dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Gravely concerned at the immense suffering the people of the
DRC are undergoing as a result of the war, the summit stressed the
urgent need to alleviate the suffering.
</P>
<P>
To this end, the summit urged all the parties to facilitate the
implementation of humanitarian operations by granting unhindered
access of humanitarian and aid agencies and workers to the
vulnerable population and victims of war, and in particular the
refugees and displaced persons who are in desperate need of
medical and food assistance.
</P>
<P>
Heads of state from the DRC, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Rwanda and
Uganda participated in the meeting. Angola is represented by its
defence minister. leaders of rebel groups also attended the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Also present were presidents from Tanzania, Mozambique, Malawi
and South Africa, Swaziland King and Salim Ahamed Salim,
secretary general of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), and
representatives from the U.N., the Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) and the Southern African Development
Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
Zambian President Frederick Chiluba, peace broker of the DRC,
presided over the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The conflict has sucked in Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia, which
support President of the DRC Laurent Kabila, and also Rwanda and
Uganda, which now back different rebel groups in the DRC to fight
the Kabila government.
</P>
<P>
The continued fighting has hampered the deployment of the U.N.
forces and observers.

<HEADLINE> Israel FM Says No Talks Under Threat With Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Any unilateral Palestinian move would also "almost certainly"
be matched by a similar Israeli move, said Ben Ami after meeting
with Italian Prime Minister Giuliano Amato.
</P>
<P>
Italian Prime Minister Giuliano Amato urged Israel to pursue
talks with the Palestinians despite the failure of the July 11-
July 25 Camp David summit.
</P>
<P>
According to a communique from Amato's office, during their
talks the premier stressed that the peace process is in a crucial
phase, and that both sides must find enough courage and
willingness to bring it to a final conclusion.
</P>
<P>
The communique added that Amato assured Ben Ami that Italy will
continue to provide support to the peace process both as a member
of the EU and as an individual partner of both Israel and the
Palestinian authorities.
</P>
<P>
Ben Ami sounded a more optimistic note when he told reporters
that negotiations have never been interrupted "in the recent past".
</P>
<P>
Ben Ami said he sees "real possibilities" of getting the two
sides lined up again in a "pre-summit" situation.
</P>
<P>
Ben Ami pointed out that the favorable conjunction of factors
in favor of an agreement include Arafat, Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak and President Bill Clinton, also voicing doubts whether
the two U.S. presidential candidates will be as committed to a
Middle Eastern settlement as Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"We could reach agreement on a final accord in the coming weeks
of September," he suggested before flying back to Israel.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, the Israelis are standing by their demand that
Jerusalem, the whole city including the Arab eastern sector
occupied in the 1967 Six War, should be their capital in
perpetuity, while the Palestinians are equally firm in demanding
that they should have at least part of the city as their own
capital.

<HEADLINE> British Ministers Accused of Kosovo Bombing Cover-up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 14 (Xinhua) -- A furious row has erupted in
Britain over accusations that the government tried to cover up
information showing most bombs dropped in the Kosovo war missed
their targets.
</P>
<P>
The Conservative Party accused ministers of misleading the
public after an investigation showed some bombs achieved a hit
rate of only 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
"We have been calling for an inquiry for over a year, which the
government have rejected... because they wanted to cover up the
truth," Conservative shadow defence secretary Ian Duncan Smith
said.
</P>
<P>
But Downing Street issued a denial of reports in an attempt to
stop the details being made public.
</P>
<P>
The joint investigation by the BBC and industry magazine Flight
International revealed as many as 31 percent of the cluster bombs,
which were blamed for large numbers of civilian casualties, missed
their targets.
</P>
<P>
The much-vaunted laser-guided smart bombs also achieved only a
66 percent strike rate, the investigation suggested.
</P>
<P>
The information indicates that collateral damage, civilian
casualties and damage to property might have been worse than
previously thought as British pilots were flying at a high
altitude.
</P>
<P>
Smith said the leaked information showed the need for an
independent inquiry into the Kosovo campaign and accused the
government of trying to hide the truth.
</P>
<P>
"Serious questions must be answered, such as why so few targets
were hit, why so few missions were flown in first few weeks of the
campaign, and did politicians intervene to stop the RAF and other
air forces from operating as they needed to?" he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Armed Forces Minister John Spellar denied the public
had been lied to over the campaign's success rate and that the
government had tried to cover up the report.
</P>
<P>
He told BBC Radio 4's Today program that figures showing the
number of bombs which hit their targets did not include bombs
which were unaccounted for.
</P>
<P>
Downing Street also stressed the accuracy figures related to
hits which pilots were able to confirm.

degrees on the Richter scale Monday jolted Mexico's Michoacan
state, causing minor damage, official sources said.
</P>
<P>
The quake, which had its epicenter at Caleta de Campos, was
felt at Arteaga in southern Michoacan, where it caused minor
damages to some buildings and distress among a number of people.

According to the spokesman, members of the Civil Protection
Department are moving around the zone to detect possible damages.

<HEADLINE> Study Finds Net Advertising Still Relying on Banners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Although more Web sites are
carrying multiple types and sizes of online advertisements, the
468 x 60 banner remains far and away the most popular advertising
form on the Internet, according to a report released Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report from AdRelevance, a U.S. innovator in Internet
advertising measurement technology, said that 97 percent of all
Web sites carry standard 468 x 60 banner ads. With more sites
carrying five or more ad dimensions, the average site now supports
four different ad formats, compared to three sizes in the second
half of last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a report for the second quarter of 2000 from
AdKnowledge, a Web marketing management service, found 125 x 125
buttons to be the second most popular ad size on the Internet, far
behind the 468 x 60 banner. The report also found the 480 x 60
banner to be the least popular size of ad. AdRelevance found
vertical banners, used by only 16 percent of sites, to be least
popular advertising dimension.
</P>
<P>
According to the AdRelevance report, business-to-business sites
are the most expensive for advertisers, with an average rate card
of 47.27 U.S. dollars. Closely following B2B sites are health and
fitness and home and garden sites, both with an average rate card
of 42.50 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Rate card prices for standard 468 x 60 standard banners have
declined slightly in the past six months, dropping from an average
full banner price of 33.22 U.S. dollars to 30.52 dollars per
thousand impressions (CPM), according to the AdRelevance report.
</P>
<P>
"Impressions" are the number of times an ad is rendered for
viewing. One impression is equivalent to one opportunity to see an
ad. CMP is the cost per thousand impressions for a particular site.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks End Higher In Hope For Steady Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks ended higher
Monday as the new economic data raised hope that the Federal
Reserve will leave interest rates alone at the monetary policy
meeting next week.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 148.34 at 11,176.14.
The blue chip index crossed the 11,000 threshold last Friday for
the first time since April 25.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor'
s 500 index rose 19.72 at 1,491.56 and the technology heavy Nasdaq
composite index rose 60.22 at 3,849.69.
</P>
<P>
Stocks rose after the Commerce Department reported that U.S.
companies boosted inventories in June by a strong 0.9 percent,
faster than the 0.6 percent in expectations. The rise in
inventories can indicate either a weakening in demand or
stockpiling by business in anticipation of robust sales.
</P>
<P>
Investors believed that the positive economic data could prompt
the Federal Reserve to leave rates unchanged on August 22 when the
central bankers meet on the rate issue. A slew of data, including
the July wholesale prices report, showed recently that the U.S.
economy is slowing and inflation remains absent after six hikes in
rates in the past 14 months.
</P>
<P>
J.P. Morgan led the Dow's advance. Home Depot's stock is also
higher, helping to drive the blue chip index higher.
</P>
<P>
In the Nasdaq composite index, Internet and telecommunications
parts makers are driving-gears. Juniper Networks and Ciena Corp.
moved higher.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index rose 7.31 at 672.05 and the American Stock
Exchange index rose 5.13 at 928.87. The Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies rose 4.22 at 514.48.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by nearly a 2-to-1
margin on the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,853 up, 1,048 down
and 474 unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume declined to 781.64 million shares from 833.80
million in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Businesses Change Web-Spending Patterns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Businesses have
significantly changed their Web-spending patterns in the past year,
an American market research firm reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Gone are the days of Web spending to build an Internet presence,
according to International Data Corporation (IDC), and in their
place is spending to integrate the Internet into internal and
external business process. In other words, purchases of Web-
related technology are now a business imperative, IDC's report
said.
</P>
<P>
"Today, corporate Internet spending is an investment that
directly impacts the strategic direction of organizations," said
the report. "The strategic impact remains, but it has shifted from
reducing costs to the transformation of business models."
</P>
<P>
While the reason for Web spending is evolving, IDC said, the
amounts expended for IT hardware, software and services will
remain high. The research firm expects Web spending by U.S.
businesses on IT products and services to more than double from
119 billion U.S. dollars in 2000 to 282.5 billion dollars in 2003.
</P>
<P>
According to IDC, this year, for the first time, U.S.
businesses will spend more on Web-related IT services than
hardware, but hardware products which enable the interface and
access of Web technologies are still important.
</P>
<P>
Spending on software will grow faster than any other type of
Web IT spending, IDC said. Web software-related spending will
increase at an annual growth rate of 43 percent between 1999 to
2003, compared with 35 percent growth rate for the overall market.
Despite the high growth, however, software will remain the
smallest part of the market.

blocking of the river since the war in Kosovo.

Recalling that not long ago people could drink water from the

<HEADLINE> British Government Accused of "Giving Comfort" to Racists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations was set to
launch an attack on the British government's record on race
relations, after condemnation from more than 30 British human
rights and ethnic minority groups.
</P>
<P>
The criticism was contained in a report submitted by the groups
to the U.N. committee responsible for monitoring racism. The
report accused the British government of "giving comfort" to
racists.
</P>
<P>
The charges came as British Home Office officials were in
Geneva, where they were questioned by the UN Committee on the
Elimination of All Forms of Race Discrimination (CERD) about
Britain's progress in implementing recommendations made by CERD in
1997.
</P>
<P>
CERD is expected to publish its latest report on Britain in the
next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
There were 49 recommendations made in the report, which was co-
ordinated by Liberty and anti-racist body the 1990 Trust.
</P>
<P>
Among those who contributed to the report were the Refugee
Council, the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants and
relatives of black people who have died in police custody.
</P>
<P>
Their demands include the end of detention for asylum seekers
and the creation of an independent police complaints authority.
</P>
<P>
On the Labor government's 1999 Immigration and Asylum Act, the
report said it "created racial tensions rather than racial harmony.
"
</P>
<P>
And the government's dispersal of asylum seekers around the UK
and making them use food vouchers instead of giving them cash, has
"stigmatized" them and led to incidents of harassment, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
The campaigners also point out that black people were six times
more likely to be stopped and searched by police, were over-
represented in the jail population and often received longer jail
sentences than those given to whites.
</P>
<P>
The report highlights an increase in racial attacks over recent
years, with surveys suggesting that 40 percent of Britain's ethnic
minority community have suffered harassment.
</P>
<P>
A Home Office spokeswoman said: "The government has made no
secret of the fact that all public services, including government
departments, can and should do more to promote racial equality and
tackle discrimination.
</P>
<P>
"This is a priority for the government and we have put in place
a radical program of reform which will have far-reaching effects
in all public services," she added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Denies Accusation of Backing Plot Against Liberian President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. ambassador to Liberia on
Tuesday dismissed as "false and baseless" a local media report
that his government was involved in a plot to assassinate Liberian
President Charles Taylor, the News Agency of Nigeria reported.
</P>
<P>
"The allegation attributed to reliable sources in the Patriot
Newspaper edition of Saturday and broadcast on the Liberia
Communications Network are completely false and baseless",
Ambassador Bismarck Myrick was quoted as saying in Liberia's
capital Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
The pro-government newspaper and radio reported last week that
the U.S. government had offered two million U.S. dollars to
finance some dissidents to kill Taylor.
</P>
<P>
Ligerian government, whose ties with the U.S. and its western
allies have been soured recently, made no comment on the reports.
</P>
<P>
Western countries have been accusing Taylor of secretly backing
the rebels in Sierra Leone and Taylor in return accused those
countries of supporting dissidents to topple him.
</P>
<P>
Taylor Monday made an announcement that his government would do
whatever possible to arrest the dissidents once they were on its
territory.
