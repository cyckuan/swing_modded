<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi PM Replies to Supreme Court on Reported Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina Wednesday replied to the full bench of the Appellate
Division of the Supreme Court on her reported remarks concerning
the highest court of justice.
</P>
<P>
The attorney general submitted Hasina's reply before the
Appellate Division when the court took it up for hearing in the
morning.
</P>
<P>
Chief Justice A.T.M. Afzal replied in the negative when he was
asked whether the reply should go to the press.
</P>
<P>
The court, however, reserved the order on the prime minister's
reported remarks. "The court in this regard reserves its order and
would pass it later," Afzal said.
</P>
<P>
Following a contempt petition against Hasina filed by Supreme
Court Bar Association President Habibul Islam Bhuiyan on February
3, the court passed an order asking for a signed statement from
the prime minister within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The is the first time in the country that a contempt petition
has been moved against an incumbent prime minister and the
country's highest court has asked for a written statement.
</P>
<P>
"1,200 bail petitions were granted by the High Court in two
days (in August last year)... the matter was brought to the notice
of the chief justice who took no action, instead, expanded the
bench," Hasina was reported as saying at a press conference on
January 29.
</P>
<P>
Bhuiyan charged in his petition that the prime minister had
committed contempt of court through her reported remarks against
the judiciary and prayed for drawing contempt proceedings against
her.
</P>
<P>
According to the petition of Bhuiyan, the High Court granted
bail to only 367 persons on the dates and the number was far below
the figure quoted by the prime minister.

<HEADLINE> NATO Readying Ground Troops for Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 17 (Xinhua) -- NATO is close to finishing
ground troop preparation for peace implementation in Kosovo, an
alliance official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told the
press that the Western military alliance had prepared an advance
element of 2,300 to be deployed in the Yugoslav province once the
peace deal is reached at Rambouillet, France, Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The advance element, or the enabling force as the official put
it, would later be replaced by heavily-armored and mechanized
reinforcement of between 5,000 and 6,000 before the final peace
implementation force of 28,000 to 30,000 are in place for the
three-year period of interim autonomous rule.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the next few days would be critical in
that NATO decision-making body the North Atlantic Council meets on
a daily basis to review and analyze the situation in Kosovo and
the progress of the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The six-nation Contact Group gave midnight Saturday as the
deadline for the Rambouillet talks while the NATO official said
that the alliance was expecting a positive result from the talks
at noon Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The official said that though some signs at Rambouillet were
not encouraging, NATO still hoped for a political solution.
</P>
<P>
But he warned that NATO war planes were still there in the
region and the military intervention plan was still at hand.
</P>
<P>
The NATO Military Committee approved late Tuesday night the
option plan for the deployment of ground troops in Kosovo and
handed the plan to the council for approval. The council is
expected to complete the ground troop generation process Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The deployment of NATO-led peace implementation force, to be
named as Joint Guardian, has already got the go-ahead from Russia
that agreed to hand an annex of the peace deal to the negotiating
parties and the annex explicitly stipulates the deployment of
NATO-led peace implementation force in Kosovo, the official said.
</P>
<P>
NATO was expecting cooperation in the form of troop
contribution from Russia, the official added.
</P>
<P>
The same official stressed that NATO had learned the lessons
from Dayton when the multinational peace implementaion force
arrived in Bosnia only 30 days after the signing of the peace
deal.
</P>
<P>
He said that NATO had to act quickly this time so as not to
leave a vacuum between the signing of the peace agreement and the
deployment of ground troops.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has reiterated his
opposition to the deployment of an international force on the
territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Accepts Zambia's Assurances About UNITA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 17 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela Wednesday accepted assurances by Zambian President
Frederick Chiluba that his government was not aiding Angola's
rebel movement UNITA.
</P>
<P>
The message will be conveyed to Angolan President Jose Eduardo
dos Santos accordingly, South African Press Association quoted
Mandela as saying.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a lightning visit by Chiluba to Cape Town,
Mandela said he had been briefed on regional efforts to broker
peace in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
They had also discussed an accusation by Angola that Chiluba
was helping National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA) in the civil war.
</P>
<P>
"He has given me the assurance that is not correct and we have
taken a decision that we will convey to President dos Santos from
Angola," Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Chiluba is the chief regional mediator in attempts
to broker peace in the DRC, Mandela said: "He has come to brief me
on the progress that has been made."
</P>
<P>
Mandela did not refer to reports of a major rebel advance on
three fronts on the capital Kinshasa, but said there were "very
encouraging developments" in the ongoing conflict.
</P>
<P>
Mandela declined to give details, but said Deputy President
Thabo Mbeki would visit Lusaka soon to discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
Neither Mandela nor Chiluba would be drawn to answer questions
on whether they were any nearer to organizing a regional summit
for the signing of a cease-fire among the warring parties in the
DRC.
</P>
<P>
Mandela would only say that progress was being made and that
everybody involved in the conflict understood that there could be
no military solution.

<HEADLINE> EU to Test Tax Reduction to Create More Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
Wednesday that it had asked European Union member states to
encourage job creation through reduction of value-added tax on
certain services.
</P>
<P>
A commission officials told the press that the commission had
presented to member states a proposal for a union-wide directive
allowing those willing member states to apply, for an experimental
period, a reduced VAT rate on such labor-intensive services as
repair on movable tangible property, renovation of buildings and
domestic care.
</P>
<P>
The target services must be provided directly to final
consumers while the application of a reduced rate must at no time
prejudice the smooth functioning of the single market of the
union.
</P>
<P>
The proposed VAT reduction is expected to exploit the enormous
potential for job creation in businesses offering local services,
the official added.
</P>
<P>
"Taxation can and must be geared more closely to job creation,"
said Mario Monti, European commissioner responsible for taxation.
</P>
<P>
"The package of measures to counter harmful tax competition is
designed to re-balance the tax burden between labor and the other
more mobile factors while the proposal for a common system of
energy taxation will make it possible to compensate for the
reduction in non-wage labor costs."
</P>
<P>
The commission proposal provides that the European Council of
Ministers may authorize member states to apply for VAT reduction
for a three-year experiment between January 1, 2000 and December
31, 2002.

<HEADLINE> Annan to Send Libya Letter on Lockerbie Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 17 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan has said he planned to send a letter to Libya Wednesday
with clarifications about arrangements for the trial of two
suspects in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie,
Scotland.
</P>
<P>
"I am going to be sending them a letter but obviously I cannot
discuss with you what is in the letter," he told reporters Tuesday
morning upon his arrival at U.N. headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Answering a press question whether he had discussed the
contents with the United States and Britain, as well as Libya, he
said, "I hope the letter will be acceptable to all of them." "We
have offered clarifications and answered some of their (the
Libyans') questions and I hope that the understandings contained
in the letter will be sufficient for us to move forward," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Currently at issue is Libya's surrender of the two suspects for
trial before a Scottish court in the Netherlands. The two suspects
were accused of involvement in the December 1988 bombing of Pan Am
flight 103 over the Scottish village of Lockerbie in which 270
people were killed, including 11 on the ground.
</P>
<P>
Libya confirmed over the weekend that it was willing to
extradite the two alleged intelligence agents for trial but it
first requested certain written assurances.
</P>
<P>
U.N.-based diplomatic sources said Tuesday that Annan was
proposing, with U.S. and British agreement, that Scottish
prosecutors should not attempt to undermine the Libyan government.
</P>
<P>
Annan was also expected to tell that Libya U.N. monitors could
ensure the suspects -- Abdel Basset Ali Mohamed al-Megrahi and
Lamen Khalifa Fhimah -- would not be interrogated by British or
American security services.
</P>
<P>
If convicted, they would have the right to appeal to a similar
Scottish court sitting in the Netherlands and, if they lost their
appeal, would have regular access to Libyan consular services
while serving their sentence at Barlinnie jail, near Glasgow.
</P>
<P>
South Africa and Saudi Arabia, which sent envoys to Tripoli to
persuade Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi to hand over the two men,
said Saturday agreement had been reached.
</P>
<P>
Tripoli had apparently removed the chief remaining stumbling
block and agreed that the two should serve any jail sentences in
Scotland and not in Libya.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council imposed sanctions on Libya in 1992 and
toughened them in 1993 because of its failure to extradite the
suspects to Britain or the United States for trial.
</P>
<P>
But London and Washington in August 1998 dropped their
insistence that the trial take place in either country and
challenged Libya to make good on its repeated offer to allow them
to be tried before a Scottish court in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who failed to persuade Tripoli into the surrender of the
two suspects during his early January visit to Libya, has asked
South Africa and Saudi Arabia for assistance to promote the
process of settling the long-standing Lockerbie issue. The U.N.
chief has since maintained contacts with all relevant parties to
seek an early start of the trial procedure.

<HEADLINE> OAU Calls for Cease-Fire Between Eritrea and </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of
African Unity (OAU) High-level Delegation Wednesday urged both
Ethiopia and Eritrea "to put an immediate end to the fighting and
to re-commit themselves to a peaceful resolution of the dispute
based on the OAU proposals for a Framework Agreement".
</P>
<P>
A statement issued here by the OAU High-Level Delegation "on
the current hostilities between Eritrea and Ethiopia" said, "the
Heads of State of Burkina Faso, Zimbabwe and Djibouti and the
Secretary General of the OAU expressed their grave concern at the
resumption and escalation of fighting between Eritrea and Ethiopia
in spite of the sustained efforts made by the OAU and other
members of the international community to seek a peaceful solution
to the dispute between the two countries."
</P>
<P>
The statement said, "they are particularly concerned over the
loss of lives, the destruction of infrastructure and property as
well as the immense suffering of the peoples caused by the
fighting."
</P>
<P>
"The OAU High-Level Delegation reiterates its disposition to
continue to work toward a peaceful resolution of the dispute and
to create the necessary conditions for a speedy implementation of
the Framework Agreement, " the statement pointed out.
</P>
<P>
It said, "in this regard, the OAU High-Level Delegation directs
its Committee of Ambassador to convey its message to the
governments of Ethiopia and Eritrea as a matter of urgency."
</P>
<P>
"The OAU High-Level Delegation, which remains seized with this
matter, is considering appropriate ways and means to pursue its
peace efforts," the statement said in conclusion.
</P>
<P>
Hostilities between Ethiopia and Eritrea resumed on February 6,
1999 in the contested Badme border zone, before spreading to a
second front around the towns of Tsorona and Zalambessa. The OAU
Secretary General and the United Nations Security Council called
for an immediate cease-fire last week.

<HEADLINE> Kurds on Hunger Strike in London </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Dozens of Kurds who are
occupying the Greek embassy in London said Wednesday they were on
hunger strike to protest at the capture by Turkey of their leader
Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
They also pledged to set themselves on fire if police ever
tried to storm the building.
</P>
<P>
"They had put their clothes and something else together, if the
police start to attack, they will set fire to burn themselves in
the building," one protester outside the mission in west London,
which is currently under heavy siege by London police, told
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
A Kurd spokesman told reporters earlier that there were about
90 Kurds in the embassy with a Greek caretaker as their hostage.
</P>
<P>
The protesters inside the mission were on hunger strike because
they "could not get food supply from outside" as they are under
heavy police guard, a spokesman of the protesters told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Chief Superintendent Anthony Wills, a London police officer who
is supervising the handling of the demonstration, was quoted as
saying earlier that police "have offered (the protesters inside)
food which they refused."
</P>
<P>
The protest outside the embassy reached its second day after
hundreds of Kurds had held a vigil through the rather cold London
night.
</P>
<P>
"We are hoping to end this (protest and hunger strike), but as
the situation is developing, it's hard to control," a Kurdish
spokesman outside the mission told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
He also said he wanted the United Nations to influence the
treatment of Ocalan "to make sure he will not be executed."
</P>
<P>
The occupation of the London embassy was one of some 20
seizures of Greek and Kenyan missions around the world.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was captured late Monday after he left the Greek embassy
in Kenya, where he had been sheltered for 12 days. He had been
repatriated to Turkey, where he would face charges of terrorism
and might face an execution.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a Kurdish spokesman in London suggested the protest
could end soon. He said the Kurds in the mission were seeking
assurances from police that they would not be arrested for
storming the building early Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Hits Two Month High Against Yen in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar climbed to a two-
month high against the yen in Tokyo Wednesday, being traded in the
118 yen range for the first time since December 10 last year on
buying by overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
At 5 p.m. local time (0800 GMT), the U.S. currency was quoted
at 118.60-63 yen, up from 118.34-37 yen at 9 a.m. (2400 GMT
Tuesday), but down from 118.70-80 in New York overnight.
</P>
<P>
In New York on Tuesday, the dollar temporarily rose to 118.90
yen, the highest level in the market since December 8, on comments
the same day in Tokyo by Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa
and other Japanese officials expressing approval of a weak yen.
</P>
<P>
Traders jumped to buy dollars and dump yen after Miyazawa
announced that the Japanese government was cutting its sales of 10-
year bonds by about 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Vice Finance Minister for International Affairs Eisuke
Sakakibara and Haruhiko Kuroda, head of the International Bureau
at the Finance Ministry, both said Wednesday it was natural for
the yen to weaken in the wake of an easing by the Bank of Japan.
</P>
<P>
The approval of a weaker yen follows the decision by the
central bank last Friday to lower its targeted overnight call rate
from 0.25 percent to 0.15 percent in a bid to curb long-term
Japanese interest rates.

<HEADLINE> National Reconciliation Urged in Lesotho </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Participants at a Southern
African Regional Institute for Policy Studies conference on the
political crisis in Lesotho have recommended that a process of
national reconciliation and peace building be adopted in the
mountainous kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe News Agency reported Wednesday that the crisis,
which prompted Botswanan and South African army to intervene to
quell an armed uprising, was sparked off last year when opposition
parties and some army rebels accused the ruling Lesotho Congress
for Democracy of rigging elections in which it won 79 out of 80
parliamentary seats.
</P>
<P>
The participants, among them academics, representatives of
political parties and civil organizations, wrote in a statement on
Wednesday that there was need for an institutional framework to
address the constitution, electoral system, economic
reconstruction and development in Lesotho.
</P>
<P>
The conference, held in Maseru early this month, also said
security and human rights issues needed to be addressed.
</P>
<P>
"Realizing that the presence of foreign troops in Lesotho is a
potential source of political instability we recommend that
Lesotho should embark on a process of national reconciliation with
full commitment and maximum inclusiveness," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The participants further recommended that Lesotho should not be
required to pay costs of the intervention forces.
</P>
<P>
The Interim Political Authority which has been put in place to
address these concerns was also recommended to be strengthened to
enable it to restore Lesotho to political stability.
</P>
<P>
The Southern African Development Community, the Organization of
African Unity and the United Nations were also urged to assist in
ensuring that foreign troops in Lesotho were withdrawn.

<HEADLINE> WHO: Much to Be Done to Stop Common Killer Like Influenza </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Major strides have been made
since the World Health Organization (WHO) instituted influenza
surveillance to combat the disease 50 years ago but there is still
much that can and should be done to stop the common killer, said
the organization's chief here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Influenza epidemics kill hundreds of thousands of people a year
and cause millions of cases of illness, according to WHO.
</P>
<P>
The major challenges revolve around influenza vaccines, WHO
Director-General Gro Harlem Brundtland said in opening a meeting
of over 300 leading international experts marking the 50th
anniversary of WHO influenza surveillance.
</P>
<P>
Since the launching of WHO's Global Surveillance Program for
Influenza, 110 national influenza centers in 83 countries have
joined the program, plus four Collaborating Centers for Virus
Reference and Research in Australia, Japan, the United Kingdom and
the United States of America.
</P>
<P>
Brundtland said that the influenza vaccines must be made more
efficient, measures must be taken to ensure that they reach
at-risk populations and, above all, the correct vaccines must be
made available as universally as possible.
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is clear: to further reduce the mortality and
morbidity related to influenza, particularly in those areas of our
globe where resources are scarce," she said.
</P>
<P>
"Our target should now be to see these improvements in the
prevention and control of influenza be made available throughout
the globe in the course of the next century; a perspective
imbedded in the long process of the strategy of Health for All,"
she stressed.
</P>
<P>
Since 1580, when the first well-described pandemic of
influenza-like disease occurred, 31 such possible influenza
pandemics have been documented, with three occurring in this
century: in 1918, 1957 and 1968. During the Spanish Flu pandemic
of 1918-1920, at least 20 million people died from influenza.
</P>
<P>
"We have to recognize that the unpredictability of an influenza
pandemic, and the rapid and serious consequences which can occur
when a pandemic strain does appear, gives us ample justification
for constant vigilance and careful planning to improve
preparedness," the WHO chief added.

<HEADLINE> Meeting With Kofi Annan Productive: Cypriot FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus Foreign Minister
Ioannis Kasoulides described his meeting with U.N. chief Kofi
Annan as "productive", the Cyprus News Agency reported on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides, who arrived in New York on Sunday, held meetings
with Annan and U.S. Presidential Emissary for Cyprus Richard
Holbrooke on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides and Annan discussed Annan's good offices concerning
the implementation of U.N. Security Council resolutions 1217 and
1218.
</P>
<P>
The two resolutions express support for a fresh U.N. initiative
aimed at achieving a just and lasting settlement to Cyprus issue
and the reduction of tensions on the island.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides said Annan has been following the development of the
shuttle mediation by his resident representative to Cyprus Ann
Hercus.
</P>
<P>
"He will decide accordingly for the appropriate timing for
talks under his auspices," Kasoulides added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to his meeting with Holbrooke, Kasoulides said he
does not expect to receive any answers concerning U.S. positions
but points out the meeting was "very useful."
</P>
<P>
"We discussed the combination of the various aspects of the
Cyprus problem, including the issue of security," Kasoulides
said, adding that the issue of a multinational force on the
island in the framework of demilitarization was also discussed.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke did not give any details concerning the meeting,
stressing that it was "private."
</P>
<P>
He pledged continued U.S. efforts for a settlement to the
Cyprus issue, but said it is extremely difficult for progress to
be made.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated
south and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when
Turkey landed its troops and took over the northern third of
the island in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the island
through a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation formula, but so far no
tangible results have been achieved.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Defends Shoot-out at Israeli Consulate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu Wednesday defended the shoot-out at the Israeli
consulate in Berlin, in which three Kurdish protesters were shot
dead by Israeli security guards.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a news conference in Tel-Aviv, Netanyahu said that
the security guards had shot in self-defense.
</P>
<P>
He added that the guards were entitled to use necessary forces,
including opening fire, against any attempt to take consulate
members as hostages.
</P>
<P>
Over a dozen other protesters were also wounded during the
clashes when they tried to break into the consulate.
</P>
<P>
No Israelis were injured in the violence, the Israeli Foreign
Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The Kurdish protesters stormed the consulate after a news
report claimed that Israel's spy agency Mossad had helped Turkey
track and capture the Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
The arrest of Ocalan by Turkish agents on Tuesday has sparked
Kurdish riots and demonstrations throughout Europe.
</P>
<P>
At the news conference, Netanyahu denied again that Israel was
involved in Ocalan's capture at the Greek Embassy in Nairobi,
Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israel closed all its political missions in Europe
on Wednesday after the violence in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio also quoted Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon,
who is currently visiting the United States, as saying that the
clashes in the Berlin consulate were a serious matter.
</P>
<P>
Sharon stressed again the need to fight terrorism locally,
regionally and internationally. He said that there is no room for
compromise with terror.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Industrial Production Remains Unchanged in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Reserve
said Wednesday that production at the nation's factories, mines
and utilities was unchanged in January.
</P>
<P>
Sluggishness in industrial production continued to reflect the
loss of export sales to economically troubled countries in Asia
and elsewhere of the world.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing output only edged a seasonally adjusted 0.1
percent higher. Gains in the output of autos, computers,
semiconductors, lumber and furniture offset declines for aircraft,
steel, clothing and tobacco.
</P>
<P>
Utility output rose 0.2 percent but mining output dropped 1.8
percent, reflecting a sharp decline in coal production and
lackluster oil and gas extraction.
</P>
<P>
The various changes left U.S. industry operating at 80.5
percent of its capacity. That is the lowest level in more than six
years and means industry has the capacity to increase output, if
necessary, without incurring inflation-causing production
bottlenecks.

CCZ Executive Director Elizabeth Nerwande said in a statement
most families no longer had disposable income because of high cost
of food.
</P>
<P>
"Most consumers in the low income group can no longer afford
three decent meals," she said.
</P>
<P>
A CCZ survey on basic commodities prices found that a family of
six would now need 1,388 Zimbabwean Dollars (35.5 U.S. Dollars) a
month to purchase basic commodities. The bill would go up to
4,985 Zimbabwean Dollars (127 U.S. Dollars) if other essentials
like transport and accommodation were added.
</P>
<P>
The price of bread recently went up by about 16.5 percent and
cost of other basic goods could increase soon, she said.
</P>
<P>
She said consumers were failing to raise subscriptions fees to
CCZ and lodge complaints against unfair practice by shop owners.
</P>
<P>
"One cannot think of sparing a cent to join the council or to
lodge a complaint," she said, adding, "As a result they are
deprived of the right to seek redress."

BERLIN, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Israeli security guards shot
dead three Kurds Wednesday as pro-Ocalan protesters attempted to
storm the Israeli consulate general in Berlin, police said.
</P>
<P>
Sixteen others were injured in the shootings, some of them
seriously, and were being treated in hospital for their wounds.
Two of the shooting victims died instantly, and the third died of
his wounds in hospital.
</P>
<P>
The deaths came as Kurds continued protests across Europe for
the second day in outrage over the the seizure of Kurdish
guerrilla leader Abdullah Ocalan in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Ocalan's supporters held protests at diplomatic
missions and took hostages in more than 20 European cities.

<HEADLINE> Kurdish Protesters End Occupation of U.N. Office at Geneva </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- About 20 Kurdish protesters,
who penetrated the United Nations Office at Geneva (UNOG) early
Tuesday and occupied one of its conference halls since then, left
the building peacefully Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
In a separate incident, roughly 30 Kurdish demonstrators ended
their three-hour occupation of the Geneva-based United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) around noon.
</P>
<P>
But Kurds continued to occupy the Greek embassy in Berne and
the Greek consulate in Zurich.
</P>
<P>
The Kurds' occupation of the U.N. offices and the Greek
missions in Switzerland took place following the arrest of Kurdish
rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Swiss federal government condemned Kurdish
protesters' occupation of Greek diplomatic missions and the United
Nations European headquarters in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
"The Federal Council (cabinet) condemns the occupation of the
Greek embassy in Berne and further acts of violence in
Switzerland," the government said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
It also urged the government of Turkey to ensure a fair trial
for Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
"The cabinet expects Turkish authorities to treat Ocalan...
fairly and to conduct a legally correct trial," the Swiss
statement said.

<HEADLINE> Security Tightened Around Embassies in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Egypt on Wednesday tightened
security around several foreign diplomatic missions after the
arrest of Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Safety precautions have been stepped up around a number of
foreign embassies, consulates as well as airline offices in Egypt,
sources of the Egyptian Interior Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The cautionary measures are part of the ministry's regular
procedures, not emergency measures, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
Greek and Kenyan embassies in some European countries were
reportedly stormed Tuesday by Ocalan's supporters after the
Kurdish rebel leader was flown from Kenya to Turkey earlier in the
day.
</P>
<P>
The Kurds blamed Greece, which provided shelter to Ocalan in
its embassy in Nairobi in the past two weeks, for handing over the
Kurdish leader to Ankara, Athen's long-time rival.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Turkish embassy in Cairo told Egypt's Middle
East News Agency that it has buttressed security measures around
all Turkish offices in Cairo with the help of the Egyptian
Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
A senior diplomat of the embassy said safety precautions were
adopted by all Turkish embassies around the world following
Ocalan's arrest.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan, leader of Turkey's outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party, has
led the Kurds since 1984 in an armed insurgency against the
Turkish government for greater autonomy in southeast Turkey.

<HEADLINE> German Leaders Shocked Over Shooting of Kurds at </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, February 17 (Xinhua) -- German leaders expressed shock
and called for calm Wednesday after Israeli security guards shot
dead three Kurdish protesters trying to storm the Israeli
consulate in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
"It is time to make it clear to everyone involved... that
everything must be done to get emotions under control," said
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's spokesman Uwe-Karsten Heye in Bonn.
He added he was "shocked" at the shootings.
</P>
<P>
The situation must not be allowed to get out of control, said
Heye. "This event makes it necessary to keep a cool head."
</P>
<P>
Heye said the European Union (EU) would have to consider a new
bid to help achieve a peaceful resolution of conflict between
Turkey and the Kurds.
</P>
<P>
In reaction to the shootings, Interior Minister Otto Schily
canceled a trip to remain in Bonn to help coordinate security
measures.
</P>
<P>
German police said they had arrested some 400 Kurds since
disturbances began early Tuesday linked to the arrest of Kurdish
Workers Party (PKK) leader Abduallah Ocalan by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The shootings ensure the Ocalan case will top the agenda at the
EU special summit in Bonn on February 26, said media reports here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
There was anger in Bonn that Greece had not informed fellow EU
member states it had been hiding Ocalan at its embassy in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder was not told about Ocalan by Greece even though
Germany holds the EU's rotating presidency for the first half of
1999, said Heye. It is regarded as a normal EU diplomatic practice
to inform the country holding the presidency of security risks to
the 15-nation bloc.
</P>
<P>
But Germany may have to dampen its displeasure over Greece.
Bonn declined to demand the extradition of Ocalan late last year
while he was being held in Italy. This was despite the fact that
German authorities had issued an arrest warrant for Ocalan over
accusations of murder and belonging to a terrorist group.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder apparently feared violent unrest from the 500,000
Kurds who comprise a major part of the 2.1 million Turkish
citizens living in the country. The PKK has been involved in
shootings and attacks on Turkish consulates, businesses, mosques
and clubs in Germany since the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Berlin police said the three Kurdish protestors were shot dead
by Israeli security forces when they tried to storm Israel's
Berlin consulate.

<HEADLINE> Clinton May Face More Trouble as Judge Raises Contempt Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Only days after U.S.
President Bill Clinton's impeachment trial ended in bipartisan
acquittal, a federal judge said in Little Rock City of Arkansas
State that she is ready to consider citing him for contempt for
denying under oath that he had a relationship with former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright, who oversaw Paula
Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit against Clinton, said she waited
because of the trial and an appeal of Jones' case. The appeal
ended when the president and Jones reached an 850,000 U.S. dollar
settlement last year.
</P>
<P>
"Accordingly, I believe that now it is time for the court to
address the contempt issue," Wright said in an order issued
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The judge said she would step aside from the case if she were
asked to do so by attorneys because of her contact with a House
impeachment case prosecutor. She gave lawyers until Friday to file
a request.
</P>
<P>
Wright's order did not say whether Clinton might face a charge
of civil or criminal contempt. Civil contempt is used to compel
someone to testify, such as the 18-month jail term imposed on
Susan McDougal after she refused to testify before the Whitewater
grand jury.
</P>
<P>
Punishments for contempt range from a reprimand to a fine or
jail.
</P>
<P>
The White House referred requests for comment to Clinton's
private lawyer, Robert Bennett, who did not return a call to his
office.
</P>
<P>
Wright raised the possibility of contempt in a footnote to her
September 1 decision to release a transcript of Clinton's
testimony in the Jones case on January 17, 1998.
</P>
<P>
In his deposition, Clinton said: "I have never had sexual
relations with Monica Lewinsky." He acknowledged on August 17 last
year before a federal grand jury -- and again in a nationally
televised address -- that he had an inappropriate relationship
with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
Clinton testified to the grand jury that he might not have been
paying attention when his lawyer told the judge about Lewinsky's
affidavit and said there was no sex of any kind with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Jones alleged that Clinton, when he was governor of Arkansas,
made a crude advance in a room at a Little Rock hotel in 1991. She
was a state worker at the time. Clinton has denied her accusation.
</P>
<P>
Jones' lawsuit brought to light the president's affair with
Lewinsky and set in motion a criminal investigation that resulted
in the House vote to impeach Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, Clinton was acquitted by the Senate on charges of
perjury and obstruction of justice.

<HEADLINE> Northern Irish Talks on Arms End Without Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's main
republican and unionist parties ended their fresh session
Wednesday without an agreement to end the row on when Irish
Republican Army (IRA) guerrillas should hand over arms.
</P>
<P>
"We very much hope that it (disarmament) does take place over
the course of the next few weeks but I can't say that anything
happened this morning to give me any assurance of it," the
province's First Minister David Trimble said after the talks in
Belfast, the provincial capital of Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, however, asked for further
talks with their long-time adversaries, the pro-British Ulster
Unionist Party (UUP) led by Trimble.
</P>
<P>
The discussions represented a significant thaw in icy relations
and came 24 hours after the parties joined forces in a key vote in
the Northern Ireland Assembly to back plans for a local
administration.
</P>
<P>
The UUP says it will refuse to sit in a proposed 10-minister
ruling provincial executive with Sinn Fein, until the IRA disarms
itself to prove committment to peace.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein says the unionist policy breaches the watershed Good
Friday agreement of last April that mapped out proposals for a
power-sharing provincial administration, under British rule, with
links to an all-Ireland ministerial council.

WASHINGTON, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The United States Wednesday
warned its citizens of special security precaution when traveling
abroad because of outrageous reaction by Kurds in Europe to the
capture of the Kurdish Worker Party's leader, Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
"Americans traveling or residing abroad are urged to review
their personal security... or contact the nearest U.S. embassy or
consulate by telephone or fax for up-to-date information on
security conditions," the State Department said in a statement.

<P>
The State Department said U.S. government personnel and
facilities were taking appropriate security measures following the

</P>
<P>
Kurd supporters have protested across Europe in response to
Ocalan's capture in Kenya Monday after he was under Greek
protection in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
Many of the protests centered on Greek embassies but three
Kurds were shot and killed outside Israel's consulate in Berlin
Wednesday in the most violent incident so far of the
demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
The State Department said Greek diplomatic missions had been
subjected to violence and it was possible "this danger may extend

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Russia and Syria agreed
Wednesday that a Middle East settlement needs progress in Israel's
ties with Syria, Lebanon as well as the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Moscow and Damascus "are unanimous in the opinion that the
Middle Eastern settlement can be talked about after progress is
made not only on the Israeli-Palestinian issues, but on
Israeli-Syrian and Israeli-Lebanese ones as well," Russian Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov said at a press conference following his
meeting with his Syrian counterpart, Farouk ash-Shara.
</P>
<P>
"We are absolutely convinced of the need for continuity and
sequence in the negotiating process so as to accommodate previous
agreements. The Syrian and Lebanese tracks should be brought
closer," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said Russia is conducting consultations with all states
involved in the Middle East peace process aimed at "sketching out
possible steps for advancing every aspect of the settlement."
</P>
<P>
His talks with the Syrian foreign minister "reaffirmed the
interest of both Arab countries and Israel in Russia's active role
as a co-sponsor," Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
Ash-Shara, who arrived here Tuesday on a three-day working
visit, is scheduled to meeting Russian Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev Thursday, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
Syria will "extend military technological cooperation with
Russia and no one has any right to criticize us for this,"
ash-Shara said, in apparent reference to the United States' threat
that it might cut aid to Russia by 50 million U.S. dollars a year
in response to Russian supplies of anti-tank weapons to Syria.

"Syria has a legitimate right to self-defense and nurtures no
aggressive plans against any country," but "the conditions we live
in compel us to arm and to seek ways to defend ourselves,"
ash-Shara' said.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed the view that Syria could disturb the regional
balance since it only possesses the military equivalent of just
one-tenth of the Israeli arsenal.

<HEADLINE> Annan Sends Lockerbie Letter to Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 17 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan sent a letter to Libya Wednesday with clarifications
about arrangements for the trial of two suspects in the 1988
bombing of a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said the letter had been "signed by
him and picked up" by Libya's U.N. ambassador Abuzed Dorda.
</P>
<P>
Annan, in answer to queries earlier, said, "We have offered
clarifications and answered some of their (the Libyans') questions
and I hope that the understandings contained in the letter will be
sufficient for us to move forward."
</P>
<P>
Currently at issue is the handing over by Libya for trial
before a Scottish court sitting at Camp Zeist, a former military
base in the Netherlands, of two suspects in the December 1988
bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over the Scottish village of
Lockerbie in which 270 people were killed, including 11 on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
Libya confirmed over the weekend that it was willing to
extradite the two alleged intelligence agents for trial but it
first requested certain written assurances.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources here said Tuesday that Annan was proposing,
with U.S. and British agreement, that Scottish prosecutors should
not attempt to undermine the Libyan government.
</P>
<P>
Annan was also expected to tell Libya U.N. monitors could
ensure the suspects -- Abdel Basset Ali Mohamed al-Megrahi and
Lamen Khalifa Fhimah -- would not be interrogated by British or
American security services.
</P>
<P>
If convicted, they would have the right to appeal to a similar
Scottish court sitting in the Netherlands and, if they lost their
appeal, would have regular access to Libyan consular services
while serving their sentence at Barlinnie jail, near Glasgow.
</P>
<P>
South Africa and Saudi Arabia, which sent envoys to Tripoli to
persuade Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi to hand over the two men,
said Saturday agreement had been reached.
</P>
<P>
Tripoli had apparently removed the chief remaining stumbling
block and agreed that the two should serve any jail sentences in
Scotland and not in Libya.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council imposed sanctions on Libya in 1992 and
toughened them in 1993 because of its failure to extradite the
suspects to Britain or the United States. They include a flight
and arms ban and an embargo on some types of oil equipment and
would be suspended when the two arrive in the Netherlands.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Manufacturing Up in December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Canada's manufacturers'
shipments rose 1.4 percent to 39.5 billion Canadian dollars (26.5
billion U.S. dollars) in December, Statistics Canada reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Overall for the year, shipments increased 3.1 percent in 1998
to 448.3 billion Canadian dollars (300.4 billion U.S. dollars),
compared with 434 billion Canadian dollars (290.78 billion U.S.
dollars) in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Shipments rose in 15 of the 33 manufacturing sectors surveyed.
The big jump was in rolling stock, which leaped 95.6 percent as
manufacturers completed and delivered a number of large contracts
for year's end.
</P>
<P>
The motor vehicle industry, which rose 3 percent, was the next
largest contributor to the overall increase.
</P>
<P>
The largest offsetting decrease in shipments came in the
refined petroleum and coal industry, which was off 6.3 percent due
to lower oil prices and a warmer-than-usual winter, said the
federal agency.

<HEADLINE> Schroeder Vows Tough Line on Kurdish Extremists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, February 17 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder vowed to take a tough line on Kurdish extremist violence
Wednesday after Israeli security guards shot dead three Kurdish
protesters trying to storm the Israeli consulate in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
"Those who live here are welcome if they adhere to law and
order," said Schroeder. "Those who violate the law must leave the
country."
</P>
<P>
Schroeder, who spoke to reporters in Schwerin, said he
regretted the deaths of the three Kurds but stressed the
Turkish-Kurdish conflict was not an issue which could be fought
out in Germany.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot tolerate conflicts being played out on German
streets which are not even our conflicts," he said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said the Berlin shootings and
Kurdish violence would mainly hurt, aside from innocent people,
the Kurdish cause.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder apparently feared violent unrest from the 500,000
Kurds who comprise a major part of the 2.1 million Turkish
citizens living in the country.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder called on Turkey to ensure that Ocalan was given a
fair trial and said that, in conformity with the practice of all
European Union states, the death sentence should be ruled out.

<HEADLINE> Russian Duma Opposes Use of Force in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The Russian State Duma
Wednesday unanimously approved a statement against the use of
force in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The lower house of parliament said the conflict must be settled
"by purely peaceful means that avoid the use of armed force in the
region."
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers urged the international community to "consolidate
their efforts to prevent an armed solution to the Kosovo problem
without U.N. Security Council sanction."
</P>
<P>
The Duma called impermissible the use of force "in the form of
bomb attacks against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia or the
sending of NATO armed forces to Yugoslavia by unilateral decision
of the NATO leadership," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Any armed actions by NATO countries unauthorized by the
Security Council prompt the question of Russia's adherence to
earlier resolutions on Yugoslavia, the statement said, in apparent
reference to unilateral lifting of arms embargo against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"In this situation, Russia may rightfully consider rendering
effective assistance to Yugoslavia to answer such aggression," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov
told reporters Wednesday that Russian troops could be deployed on
Yugoslav territory only if its lawful government appeals to Russia
and the U.N. Security Council passes the appropriate resolution,
the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"Yugoslavia is a sovereign country and any questions related to
an international presence there, be it civilian or military, may
be answered only with the consent of its legitimate authorities,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> WFP to Donate Food to Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP)
will offer food, worth about 2.7 million U.S. Dollars, for 80,000
hunger-stricken people in Mozambique, a senior official with the
organization said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Domenic Charpelli, WFP representative to Mozambique, said in a
telephone interview that the money would be given to help those
hit by natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
Charpelli said that it had been previously predicted that the
country, especially southern areas, would be hit by drought, but
things turned out to be that many parts of the country are now
threatened by flood, with water level of most rivers in the
country on the rise, so the aid is mainly aimed at those hit by
flood.
</P>
<P>
The aid includes about 5,000 tons of maize and beans, enough
for four months consumption for the 80,000 people, the WFP
representative said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Mozambican government, the aid will be
distributed in a principle of "work for relief" (excluding aged
people, children and those disabled), instead of free donation.
</P>
<P>
WFP has carried out several aid projects in the southern
African country, including rehabilitation of schools, roads,
health centers and wells destroyed in the civil war which ended in
1992, with about 12 million Dollars in school projects alone,
Charpelli said.
</P>
<P>
The organization is currently carrying out a program to offer
food for about 30,000 boarding students in the country, which cost
11 million U.S. Dollars.

<HEADLINE> Official: Russia Faces Imminent Grain Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Grain shortages in Russia,
which suffered its 40-year worst harvest last year, will amount to
10 million tons in the first half of 1999, a ranking Agricultural
Ministry official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Vasily Shapochkin, who is in charge of livestock and breeding
at the Russian Ministry of Food and Agriculture, said shortages of
feed grain (including centralized imports of maize) would amount
to 6 million tons of the overall shortage, the Interfax news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Prospects for this year's harvest remain bleak. Deputy Prime
Minister Gennady Kulik said the country is likely to experience a
replay of last year's drought which affected over 40 million
hectares of farmland and destroyed crops in 12 million hectares in
44 of the 89 Russian regions.
</P>
<P>
Over 3 million hectares of winter crops, or nearly 25 percent
of the total, are in poor shape, Agriculture and Food Minister
Viktor Semyonov said.
</P>
<P>
According to plans, the country will harvest some 68 million
tons of grain this year, as against its need of 73-75 million
tons, Semyonov said.
</P>
<P>
Both the United States and the European Union have pledged food
aid to Russia.

<HEADLINE> DR Congo Wants to Benefit from Egypt's Expertise: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Minister of Democratic
Republic of Congo (DR Congo) Jean Charles Okoto Lolakombe said on
Wednesday his visit to Egypt is aimed at benefiting from the
country's expertise in setting up mega-projects
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Egypt's Middle East News Agency before
wrapping up his three-day visit, Lolakombe said that DR Congo is
interested in getting acquainted with Egypt's experience in the
projects in agricultural and industrial domains.
</P>
<P>
The coming period will witness further cooperation between the
two countries in various fields following the signing of a number
of cooperation agreements during his visit, Lolakombe said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the key role of the private sector in boosting the
bilateral cooperation in the future, adding a team of Egyptian
businessmen will visit DR Congo to get acquainted with investment
spheres there.
</P>
<P>
The Congolese official denied reports that his two visits to
Egypt within two months were intended to seek weapons and
ammunition to fight rebels in his country.
</P>
<P>
Lolakombe stressed that his country at present needs to fight
poverty and hunger and raise the standard of living of its people.
</P>
<P>
On the armed conflicts in DR Congo, he said "economic fighting"
aimed at looting his country's wealth and destabilizing the
country by foreign countries is still raging.
</P>
<P>
DR Congo has accused Rwanda and Uganda of sending troops to the
country to help rebels in fighting against the government forces.
</P>
<P>
Defending the presence of Zimbabwean, Namibian, Chadian and
Angolan troops in DR Congo, Lolakombe said that under the United
Nations Charter, DR Congo is allowed to invite troops of friendly
countries to counter any attack.
</P>
<P>
He also turned down conditions set by Rwanda and Uganda that
forces of the aforesaid four countries should withdraw first
before they pull out their troops.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank (WB) has
embarked on an educational initiative aimed at providing
Zimbabwean schools with access to computers and the Internet, a WB
official said in Bulawayo Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Anthony Bloome, the WB official, said this in the second
largest city of Zimbabwe when addressing delegates to a two-day
Information Technology (IT) Conference.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe News Agency quoted Bloome as saying that the
initiative, dubbed World Links for Development, would help
establish a national network of schools/centers which would
develop into "Schoolnet-Zimbabwe" as to be called.
</P>
<P>
The WB official said the pilot phase of the World Links for
Development program is expected to see the introduction of between
nine and 18 world centers by June, 1999 throughout the southern
African country, with at least one in each of its 10 provinces.
</P>
<P>
He added that the centers would serve as central educational
resource centers by serving surrounding clusters of schools, and
also operate as community telecenters by providing adult,
continuing, non-formal and distance education, electronic resource
libraries, information and communication technology training and
micro-enterprise development.
</P>
<P>
The objectives of the World Bank initiative include
establishing a global learning network linking thousands of
students and educators around the world, improving and expanding
educational opportunities and horizons in developing countries,
and promoting the effective use of information and communication
technology in education.
</P>
<P>
The program also seeks to improve the prospects of employment
and build bridges among the youth, said Bloome.
</P>
<P>
The World Links for Development, which aims to be operating in
40 countries by the end of the year 2000, is currently underway in
six African countries, four Latin American countries and two
Mediterranean countries.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania, Burundi to Restore Full Diplomatic Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania and Burundi
will restore full diplomatic relationship after more than two and
a half years of estrangement resulted from a military coup in
Burundi, a Tanzanian foreign ministry spokesman said here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Simeon Ileta, spokesman for the Tanzanian Ministry of Foreign
Affairs and International Cooperation, said that the two countries
have made public a joint communique to fully resume bilateral
cooperation in the diplomatic, security, economic, cultural,
scientific and technical fields.
</P>
<P>
Burundi will soon send an ambassador to Tanzania, Ileta told
Xinhua, adding that since 1996 the Burundian diplomatic mission in
Dar es Salaam has been represented by a charge d'affairs.
</P>
<P>
"In the diplomatic field, the two governments agreed to upgrade
the representation of the Republic of Burundi in Tanzania to
ambassadorial level," he cited the communique as saying.
</P>
<P>
The communique was issued by Burundian Minister for External
Relations and Cooperation, Severin Ntahomvukiye, and his Tanzanian
counterpart Jakaya Kikwete in Dar es Salaam Tuesday before the
former winded up his four-day working visit to Tanzania from
February 14 to 17.
</P>
<P>
The Burundian minister, who was carrying a special message from
 President Pierre Buyoya to Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa,
held discussions with Kikwete, and paid a courtesy call on
Tanzanian Vice- President Omar Juma, who received the message on
behalf of Mkapa.
</P>
<P>
Ileta revealed that Ntahomvukiye will also visit Kenya and
Uganda to improve bilateral relationships.
</P>
<P>
The government of Burundi has applied to join the East African
Cooperation (EAC) and requested the support of the Tanzanian
government toward such an end.
</P>
<P>
On security issues, according to the communique, Tanzania and
Burundi decided that the Tripartite Committee, comprising the two
countries and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR), should meet in Bujumbura, capital of Burundi, during
March 28-29, to consider all matters related to refugees and
security.
</P>
<P>
In the economic, cultural, scientific and technical spheres,
the two governments decided to reactivate the Joint Commission of
Cooperation. It was agreed that the government of Burundi will
convene the fourth session of the commission in Bujumbura in
September.
</P>
<P>
Ntahomvukiye reiterated his government's commitment to pursue
peace talks under the facilitation of Julius Nyerere, the former
president of Tanzania and chief international mediator, until an
agreement has been reached, said the communique.
</P>
<P>
Seven African countries -- Tanzania, Uganda, Kenya, Rwanda, the
 Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia and Zambia, backed by the
Organization of African Unity (OAU), have imposed economic
sanctions on Burundi shortly after Major Pierre Buyoya, a Tutsi,
toppled a civilian government in June of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Tanzania and Burundi have been strained since
then. The two countries even exchanged fires at border after
Burundi accused Tanzania of hosting armed Hutu rebels in its
refugee camps in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
The embargo on Burundi was suspended last month at a regional
summit held in Arusha, a northern town of Tanzania, as Burundian
government has partly met terms set by the countries to lift the
ban, such as restoring parliament and holding negotiations with
various opposition groups.
</P>
<P>
Following the suspension decision, President Mkapa has ordered
Tanzanian businessmen to resume trade with land-locked Burundi as
soon as possible. The state-owned Air Tanzania Corporation has
already resumed regular flights to Burundi.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba Wednesday called for a pull-out of foreign troops from the
war-torn Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to bring peace to that
country.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba, who has been mediating the six-month conflict with a
mandate of the Southern African Development Community (SADC), made
the appeal before leaving here Wednesday morning for Cape Town,
South Africa, to have a brief discussion about the peace process
in the DRC with SADC Chairman, South African President Nelson
Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Reportedly, Chiluba also discussed with Mandela about Angola's
recent accusation that Zambia is supplying arms to the rebel
movement National Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
After the talks Mandela said that he is happy over the progress
the SADC has made in finding solution to the conflict in the third
largest African country.
</P>
<P>
Mandela praised Chiluba for his efforts to seek a peaceful
settlement of the war.
</P>
<P>
Returning here Wednesday afternoon from the talks with his
South African counterpart, Chiluba said that the issue of pulling
out of foreign troops from the DRC is one of the modalities to
ensure peace in the vast central African country.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said now DRC President Laurent Kabila is willing to
meet rebels in Kinshasa even out of Kinshasa, capital of the DRC.
</P>
<P>
The six-month-old war has dragged in six foreign countries and
threatens to become a full-scale multinational conflict.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and Chad have sent their troops there
to back Kabila while Rwanda and Uganda have been accused of
backing the rebels although they said they have deployed their
troops in the DRC for their own security interests and accused
Kabila of backing their anti-government forces.

<HEADLINE> UK Unveils Robot Fire Fighter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 17 (Xinhua) -- British engineers have
developed a robotic fire fighter which can go into the heart of
fires and remove flammable or dangerous chemicals, the BBC
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The new vehicle, named Fire Spy, is developed by the UK's West
Yorkshire Fire Service and JCB and is believed to be able to save
human fire fighters' lives, according to BBC One's TV program
Tomrrow's World.
</P>
<P>
Fire Spy has been designed to withstand temperatures of up to
800 degrees centigrade. All the wiring has been upgraded to stand
high temperatures.
</P>
<P>
It is controlled remotely. The driver can see what is happening
in the blaze through two cameras, infrared and standard, which
beam back video pictures.
</P>
<P>
At the front of the machine is a powerful grabbing arm with the
strength of over 15 human fire fighters.
</P>
<P>
The new machine will be in service by the end of February 1999.
The designers are now working on a special hose attachment that
would carry water right to the center of any fire.

Public relations manager, Justice Kemei said the board's depots
in Nairobi, North Eastern and Coast provinces were being stocked
with maize to meet the demand.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the maize would be sold on a commercial basis
to meet any relief food requirement under the National Famine
Relief Program.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Kemei said that parts of Nyanza, Western and
Rift Valley provinces which experienced food insufficiency had
also been supplied with adequate maize stocks to meet demand.
</P>
<P>
"Equally, contingency measures are in place to move more maize
from surplus areas where the board is currently involved in buying
maize to the deficit areas," he said.
</P>
<P>
The board also disclosed that it has so far purchased over
560,000 bags of maize since it started its market intervention to
stabilize prices and improve distribution.

<HEADLINE> Congo(K) Rebel Leader on Ways to End Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The political leader of
the rebels in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Ernest Wamba
dia Wamba, said here Wednesday that there are only two options in
ending the conflicts in the country -- to conduct direct
negotiations or to oust President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the University of Dar es Salaam, Ernest Wamba dia
Wamba, President of the rebel group, the Rally for Democracy for
Congo (RCD) , said he preferred the first option but will also
choose the second one if need arises.
</P>
<P>
"If Kabila does not want to negotiate with us, we will
overthrow him," Wamba said. "If he wants to continue the war, we
will make sure that they cannot win militarily."
</P>
<P>
Wamba dia Wamba was speaking at a seminar organized by the Dar
es Salaam University Political Science Association (DUPSA), in
collaboration with the Dar es Salaam Philosophical Club (DAPHIC),
with the theme of current situation in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the negotiations must be between the two
warring parties while the rest of mediators be facilitators and
advisors.
</P>
<P>
The rebel leader said President Kabila has been refusing to
have direct negotiations with his party, thus delaying peace
process. He cited a Southern African Development Community (SADC)
meeting in Zambian capital Lusaka and another meeting in Libyan
capital Tripoli, where he said the rebels could not sit at the
negotiation table.
</P>
<P>
He ruled out the possibility that he or his party will go to
Kinshasa, capital of the DRC, for negotiations, but he said they
could meet elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
Wamba dia Wamba underscored the need for African governments to
press for peace in the DRC, warning that instability in the vast
African country has far-reaching effects on the entire continent.
</P>
<P>
Responding to questions, Wamba allayed widespread allegations
that his group was being financially and materially backed the
United States government. However, he did not disclose their
financiers.
</P>
<P>
The rebel leader also said he has decided to go to the bush to
bring about democratic changes in the country and prevent the
people of the DRC from suffering from a genocide like that of
Rwanda in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The seminar was attended by over 500 students, lecturers and
members of the public. Wamba dia Wamba, who came to Tanzania to
see his family and handle other affairs, was a history professor
at the university until he devoted himself to the rebel movement
against the government of Kabila last August.

<HEADLINE> New Progress Expected for China's Economic Powerhouse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PUDONG, SHANGHAI, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai's dynamic
Pudong New Area is predicting considerable economic progress
throughout this new Chinese Lunar New Year with the opening of
many more financial institutions and the completion of numerous
infrastructure projects high on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
The industrial output of Pudong, China's economic powerhouse,
is expected to increase by about 15 percent this year, based on
the 142.2 billion yuan (17 billion US dollars) realized last year,
which was the entire industrial output of Shanghai in 1989.
</P>
<P>
About 88.5 percent of more than 2,000 enterprises funded by 88
international big name firms are now operational, including a
micro-electronic joint venture, NEC-Microelectronic Company
Limited, which has become China's largest producer of integrated
circuit chips after its trial production run earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Pudong International Airport will open for worldwide flights
this year, and the 88-storey Jinmao Mansion, the tallest building
in China, dwarfs some 100 other skyscrapers springing up in Pudong'
s Lujiazui Financial Area.
</P>
<P>
The Pudong International Convention Center will also become a
focus of attention in September when it stages its first
convention attracting representatives from the world's 500 biggest
companies.
</P>
<P>
Other infrastructural projects which are underway or to be
finished this year include a subway linking Pudong with urban
Shanghai, and a gas-supply project bringing natural gas to Pudong
from the East China Sea.
</P>
<P>
As China's financial center, Pudong has been chosen as the
headquarters of increasing numbers of domestic and overseas
financial and banking institutions, such as the Shanghai Futures
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
So far, 72 foreign-funded financial institutions have set up in
the region and 18 of them are permitted to handle renminbi
business.

SOFIA, February 18 (Xinhua) - Bulgaria will demand visas to

Foreign Minister Nadezhda Mihailova said after the Cabinet's
Thursday meeting.
</P>

Romania, Russia, Tadzhikistan, Tunisia, Turkmenistan, Ukraine,

<P>
However, under the new regulation, citizens from Russia,
Ukraine, Romania, Macedonia, Yugoslavia, Georgia and Tunisia do
not need to obtain visas from Bulgaria when entering the country.
</P>
<P>
The new introduction of visa requirements aims to expedite the
alignment of Bulgarian to European legislation, Mihailova said.

<P>
It is expected that the countries in question will reciprocate
by imposing visa requirements for Bulgarian nationals.

<HEADLINE> Russia Urges Fair Trial for Ocalan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"We want to express our conviction that any form of terrorism
or violence is inadmissible no matter what slogan is used to
disguise it," spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin said.
</P>
<P>
Moscow "firmly supports civilized, non-violent, and political
methods" in resolving issues concerning human rights and the
rights of national and ethnic minorities, he added.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan, who may face the death penalty on terrorism charges in
Turkey, was arrested earlier this week in Kenya, sparking protests
by ethnic Kurds, some of which were violent, across Europe.
</P>
<P>
Rakhmanin stressed the fact that although Turkey has not
outlawed the death penalty, "It has refrained from carrying out
executions since 1984.
</P>
<P>
"These high humanitarian principles should not be discarded in
Ocalan's case," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a group of deputies of the Russian State Duma, or
lower house of parliament, submitted a draft resolution Thursday
calling for economic sanctions on Turkey for the arrest of Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Lukin, head of the Duma International Affairs
Committee, called the draft document "pure lobbying," saying it
had been drafted "by people who had invited Ocalan when he arrived
in Russian territory with a false passport at the end of last year.
"
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was later whisked out of Russia to Italy, where he
applied for political asylum in vain.
</P>
<P>
"We advocate respect for the rights of the Kurdish ethnic
minority, but we must not support the brutal, armed extremist wing
fighting for the separation of Kurds living in Turkey, Syria and
Iraq and the formation of an independent Kurdish state," Lukin
said.
</P>
<P>
He warned the road chosen by the Kurdish extremists would mean
"redrawing the map of a world beset by serious wars."
</P>
<P>
Lukin ruled out the possibility of the approval of the draft,
saying Russia must not evince a double standard while defending
its own territorial integrity.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Central Bank Unveils Reform Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Korea (BOK) on
Thursday unveiled a package of reform measures which calls for
sharply enhancing the efficiency and competitiveness of the
central bank's operations.
</P>
<P>
Under the reform package announced by BOK governor Chon Chol-
hwan, the central bank will open its key policy making posts in
its international, research and management departments to outside
experts who will be appointed as heads of major departments and
divisions of BOK.
</P>
<P>
The new experts will include lawyers, accountants and financial
specialists who will be in charge of research, international, and
policy-making sections of the bank starting sometime this year.
</P>
<P>
"We are pushing ahead with a plan to acquire monetary and
international financial experts. We are also willing to invite
foreign experts as advisors," Chon said.
</P>
<P>
Despite anticipated opposition from BOK employees, the central
bank will strongly implement the reform plan, he said, adding that
the plan will help raise the bank's capabilities to the level of
central banks in advanced countries.
</P>
<P>
To help foster specialization, Chon said his bank will classify
the current 13 departments into five categories and shorten its
decision-making process from seven steps to two stages as well as
relegate half of upper management powers to lower management.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to promote productivity, the central bank will
also carry out a new performance-based management system and
transform the bank's office operations into teams.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Korea has drastically cut its staff by 25.5 percent
from 2,894 at the end of 1997 to 2,157 as of this week. It also
closed three departments and three overseas representative offices
last year.
</P>
<P>
Under the new rule, the bank will offer its senior officials
two-year employment contracts instead of lifetime engagement.
</P>
<P>
When vacancies arise, it will post a recruitment notice both
within the bank and in public and select the final candidate
through transparent procedures.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time in the BOK's 50-year history that it
has committed to realize such revolutionary measures. We will
continue to reform and improve the hierarchy of the central bank
until it can compete with advanced nations' banks,'' said the
governor.
</P>
<P>
However, the implementation of the new reform plan will depend
on future negotiations with union leaders. This is the most
difficult part, analysts said.

LONDON, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The Kurdish protesters who had
been occupying the Greek embassy in London left the building on
Thursday afternoon, after three days of siege.
</P>
<P>
About 50 or so Kurds left the mission in Holland Park of west
London, each one was accompanied by a police officer who was
waiting outside and checking them. Some of the Kurds were seen
taken away by police for questioning.
</P>
<P>
They were hailed by the protesters outside the embassy, who
were waving and shouting support on them.
</P>
<P>
The Kurds, who are protesting at the capture by Turkey of their
leader Abdullah Ocalan, said earlier they would make a statement
at midday and giving themselves up at 1300 GMT.
</P>
<P>
The protesters forced their way into the five-storey building
in Holland Park of west London early Tuesday, holding an embassy
clerk hostage.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, a 15-year-old Kurdish girl set herself on fire in
front of the building, but was a minute later rescued by police
around and sent to hospital.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan, who is held responsible by the Turks for thousands of
killings, was arrested in Kenya on Monday after leaving the Greek
Embassy in Nairobi, where he had been given protection.
</P>
<P>
He is now in a prison in Turkey, the country against which his
guerrillas have fought a 14-year war.
</P>
<P>
During their three-day protest, the demonstrators in London
have demanded the British government and the United Nations stop
the Turkish government from killing Ocalan.

Thursday their three-day occupation of the Greek embassy in London.
</P>
<P>
They left the building in Holland Park of west London after
making a statement to the media.
</P>

The Kurds, who are protesting at the capture by Turkey of their

</P>
<P>
But no statement was issued up to 1345 GMT. It was estimated

mission up had not reached any agreement on whether the Kurds
should be arrested if they leave the mission peacefully.
</P>
<P>
Police said the 50 or so protesters would be taken away "in an
orderly manner" for questioning.
</P>
<P>
The protesters forced their way into the five-storey building

<HEADLINE> EU to Reform Fishery and Aquaculture Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
Thursday that it has proposed reforming the Common Organization of
Markets (COM) in fishery and aquaculture products.
</P>
<P>
Commission officials said the proposed reform is aimed at
encouraging European Union fishermen to catch only fish that can
be readily sold to avoid depleting fish stocks.
</P>
<P>
The reform is also expected to ensure a better match between
supply and demand in order to protect employment in both the
catching and processing sectors.
</P>
<P>
The EU market in fishery and aquaculture products has undergone
extensive changes over the past few years, mainly due to the
depletion of fish stocks and changes in consumer habits.
</P>
<P>
The strong dependency of the EU on fishery imports is also a
reason for reform, since the 15-nation bloc now imports 60 percent
of the fishery products it consumes.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Foreign Reserve Up to 55 Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 18 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's total foreign
exchange reserve rose to 55.78 billion U.S. dollars as of February
15 from last month's 53 billion, the Bank of Korea (BOK) said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The total foreign exchange reserve includes foreign currency
deposits at overseas branches of South Korean banks.
</P>
<P>
Bankers attributed the rise to domestic financial institutions'
repayment of their emergency foreign currency loans to the central
bank.
</P>
<P>
At the height of the financial crisis at the end of 1997, when
the nation's usable foreign exchange holdings plummeted to 8.87
billion dollars, BOK extended 23.29 billion dollars in emergency
foreign currency loans to domestic financial institutions. Now
over 20.55 billion dollars of the loans have been repaid, said the
central bank.
</P>
<P>
"Domestic financial institutions are expected to repay the
remaining loans by the end of June this year," said Kim Yeong-rim,
manager of the BOK International Finance Division.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by South Korea's enhanced external credibility,
bankers said the state will have no problem reaching its goal of
60 billion dollars in foreign exchange reserves by the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the South Korean government announced Thursday that
it will repay one billion dollars to the International Monetary
Fund (IMF), from which the country borrowed 58 billion dollars at
the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made due to the increase of usable foreign
exchange reserves.
</P>
<P>
The repayment will leave South Korea with 14.2 billion dollars
of the IMF's loan outstanding. In the past two months, Seoul has
returned 3.8 billion dollars to the IMF.
</P>
<P>
"Along with the latest upgrade of South Korea's credit rating
to an investment level by international rating agencies, the
repayment will help enhance foreign investors' confidence in the
country," said the South Korean Ministry for Finance and Economy.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
on Thursday that it had recommended opening of the pre-accession
screening with Malta as a formal acceptance of its application for
European Union membership.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the executive body of the 15-nation bloc, made
the recommendation after its meeting on Wednesday as requested by
the European council of foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
The commission analyzed Malta's preparation for EU membership
according to the union's political, economic and legislative
criteria.
</P>
<P>
European Foreign Affairs Commissioner Hans van den Broek said:
"I am pleased that Malta has rejoined the enlargement process. It
is making good progress in preparing for EU membership."
</P>
<P>
The commissioner added that it was recommended to the council
to reactivate the pre-accession screening process for the
Mediterranean island state, with a view to enable the start of
accession talks at the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The commission recommended that Malta's political institutions
are functioning smoothly and its economy displays all the
characteristics of a market economy, though the country has to
abolish taxes on imports of certain products to align itself with
the Common Customs Tariff of the union.
</P>
<P>
Malta applied for EU membership in July 1990 and the European
Commission issued its opinion on its membership application in
1993.
</P>
<P>
In April 1995, the European council of ministers decided that
accession negotiations with Malta should start within six months
but the Maltese government elected by the October 1996 general
elections decided to freeze the membership application.
</P>
<P>
The new Maltese government elected by the September 1998
general elections pronounced its intention to reactivate the
country's application for EU membership.

TEHRAN, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami announced on Thursday that Iran is ready to sign security
pacts with the countries in the region in order to maintain
security and stability.
</P>
<P>
Security of the region will be materialized only through
cooperation of the regional countries, Khatami said at a
flag-hoisting ceremony held in the second marine region of the
armed forces in the southern Bushehr province.
</P>
<P>
He said that in a bid to ensure the regional security, Iran is
ready to cooperate with the regional countries, the Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president stressed that Iran is for the evacuation
of alien forces from the Gulf region and maintained that the
security of the region will be preserved through the evacuation of
the alien forces from the region.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Iran and its six southern neighbors have
been improved after Khatami came to power in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Despite of their differences over some issues, Iran and the
Gulf states have repeatedly announced their readiness to promote
their relations and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
However, some Arab countries still see Iran as a potential
threat to the regional security.
</P>
<P>
Iran rejected the allegation about its threat to its
neighbors, but claiming that the presence of foreign forces in
the region is the real factor of insecurity and tensions.

Ethiopian government's efforts at land rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony of donating 30 motorcycles and four pick-ups to

Oromia, Tigray and Southern Region were helped through the
"Rehabilitation and Development of Rural Lands and Infrastructure"
project.

<HEADLINE> Israel Expands Occupied Zone in S. Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Israel expanded its occupied
zone in south Lebanon overnight by annexing a village into
the border encalve, the Voice of the People radio reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A joint force of Israeli troops and allied South Lebanon Army
(SLA) militia escorted by trucks, bulldozers and jeeps, laid down
a barbed-wire barricade around the town of Arnoun just outside
the Israeli occupied zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
They set up a checkpoint to supervise traffic in and out
of the town's western outskirts from neighboring villages and
towns.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted residents as saying that they were told
that Arnoun was part of the so-called security zone which
Israel established in 1985 to allegedly protect its north from
Lebanese guerrillas' attacks.
</P>
<P>
The radio said many small signboards were found inside the
village, on which "Stop, before you is the security zone"
were written in English, Arabic and Hebrew.
</P>
<P>
Arnoun, with no more than 70 residents, overlooks the
nearby hilltop Beaufort Castle, the strongest Israeli redoubt in
the enclave.
</P>
<P>
The village is reported to be always used by guerrillas
of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, to launch
attacks on Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah is leading a guerrilla war to oust Israeli
occupation forces and SLA from the country.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese government swiftly reacted to the Israeli act
which it decried as a fresh aggression over the country.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese President Emile Lahoud and Prime Minister Salim Hoss
expressed their strong condemnation in separate meetings with
commander of the United Nations' peacekeeping troops in Lebanon
Gen. J.K. Konrote and rotational head of the five-nation
monitoring group Richard Erckman.
</P>
<P>
The monitoring group was set up following an Israeli 16-day
blitz on Lebanon in April, 1996 with the task of overseeing an
understanding to preclude civilians from the ongoing conflicts in
south Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Greeting Friends on Net Popular in East China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The high-tech world of
computers is changing even the face of the traditional Chinese
Lunar New Year as increasing numbers of people are sending
electronic greetings cards on-line to friends and family and even
exchanging messages with relatives across thousands of miles.
</P>
<P>
A perfect example happened in the eastern coastal province of
Zhejiang where Doctor Wu Yue clicked his mouse and suddenly on the
terminal screen two Chinese cartoon children appeared singing a
message wishing him Happy New Year...all the way from Singapore,
almost as soon as it had been sent.
</P>
<P>
"It's quick and economical," said Doctor Wu, "It requires only
a few minutes to send an electronic card on the Internet. This
means I do not have to go to a post office, write an envelope or
buy stamps."
</P>
<P>
Yao Bini, even though in her 60s, is another discovering that
the new technology is a boon. She was so excited when she had a
dialogue on Internet with her son who is studying in the United
States that it brought tears to her eyes. Yao spent one hour "
talking" with her son on-line.
</P>
<P>
"It costs only 0.35 yuan per minute," explained Yao, who had
bought a computer and connected it to the Internet in order to
talk freely with her son.
</P>
<P>
Yao even invited relatives and friends to her home on Spring
Festival Eve at her son's request for he wanted to greet them
personally during the celebrations via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Hangzhou, the capital city of Zhejiang, began to provide people
with access to the Internet in 1995. Today, nearly 40,000 people
have taken advantage of the service, according to the city's
telecommunications office.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a number of middle school students in Beijing have
called on people to send less paper cards because of the
increasing need to protect wood resources. E-mail and electronic
cards are now ideal alternative choices, they insist.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics showed that more than 2.1 million people had
access to the Internet last year across China.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Calls for Int'l Cooperation in Drug Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has called on every
nation which is serious about the drug problem to represent at the
forthcoming Fourth International Conference on Heroin in Yangon to
find ways and means to promote international cooperation and to
observe first-hand the Myanmar government's efforts to overcome
the problem.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar will host the conference which is scheduled for
February 23-26 in cooperation with the Office of Director-General
of Interpol, expecting several dozen countries to attend.
</P>
<P>
Quoting a recent press release of the Myanmar Embassy in
Washington, an official Information Sheet said here Thursday
evening that the conference will provide an unequaled opportunity
for the international community to strengthen the principle of
shared responsibility, calling on the countries to have courage to
put the long-term interest of its people ahead of short-term
political consideration.
</P>
<P>
It stressed that "in the final analysis, it is not the fate of
one regime of one nation that is at stake. It is the future of
humanity."
</P>
<P>
"Notwithstanding the fact that all assistance to the country
has been curtailed for political reasons, the Myanmar authorities,
relying on their own resources, have registered significant
successes in their campaigns," it said.
</P>
<P>
It added that Myanmar has seized and destroyed more than 3,700
kilograms of heroin, 22,700 kilograms of opium, 10 million
amphetamine tablets and eliminated more than 70 heroin refining
camps.
</P>
<P>
In addition to its national efforts, the Myanmar government
actively seeks international cooperation, initiating memorandums
of understanding for suppression of narcotic drugs with all its
neighbors and the U.N. Drug Control Program as well as with the
Russian Federation, it pointed out, saying that the agreements
focus on reducing drug trafficking, eliminating poppy cultivation
through economic and social development programs and reducing the
demand for consumption of drugs.
</P>
<P>
The Information Sheet regretted that "it is unfortunate that at
a time when there is an urgent need to promote multilateral
initiatives to overcome the drug menace, there are some who have
become so blinded by such emotive issues as human rights and
democracy that they are unable to separate the wheat from the
chaff."
</P>
<P>
"They readily believe the allegations of systematic violations
of human rights in Myanmar and the sensational stories that
authorities there are hand in glove with drug traffickers," it
complained.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the United States and Britain and some other
European countries have announced boycott of the conference, over
which Myanmar has expressed regret, urging the two countries to
put politics aside for the sake of the millions of people around
the world whose lives are threatened by the drug trade.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Sends Relief to Afghan Earthquake Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations and other
international agencies are sending relief supplies including
shelter and food to the scene of an earthquake which struck Afghan
areas some 100 kilometers south of Kabul on February 11.
</P>
<P>
While U.N. international staff have been out of Afghanistan
since the murder of an Italian military observer last August, the
U.N. sent a team of four international staff members to Kabul this
week to help coordinate earthquake relief efforts led by the Red
Cross movement, said a U.N. press release.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. staff are also sending food, shelter materials,
blankets and medicines to the worst-affected families.
</P>
<P>
Assessments on the extent of the area affected by the quake,
which measured between 5.5 and 5.9 on the Richter scale, continue
to grow as teams probe further into snowbound villages.
</P>
<P>
After surveying 63 villages, international agencies estimated
the number of heavily damaged and destroyed houses at more than
5,500, meaning that at least 30,000 people are homeless.
</P>
<P>
The casualty count has not increased beyond 39 dead and 256
wounded, since a tremor preceding the quake alerted residents to
flee their homes, said the press release.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. was in the process of assessing security conditions in
Afghanistan in order to return international staffs to the country
when the earthquake struck.

<HEADLINE> South Korea to Issue Presidential Amnesty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 18 (Xinhua) -- South Korea will grant amnesty
to tens of thousands of prisoners next week to mark the first
anniversary of President Kim Dae-jung's inauguration, the Justice
Ministry said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Justice Minister Park Sang-cheon will reveal the amnesty plan
to President Kim Friday, who will mark his first year in office
next Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Upon approval by the president, the amnesty will be presented
to a cabinet meeting scheduled for next Monday and those to be
pardoned will be revealed soon.
</P>
<P>
"The number of people to be pardoned will fall short of last
August's five million, but many minor offenders will be included
in consideration of economic difficulties in the wake of the
International Monetary Fund chill," the Yonhap News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the presidential pardon will go to 17 "political
prisoners" who have refused to abandon their communist ideology
and some 2,000 violators who cannot pay fines of less than five
million won (roughly 4,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Persons on the spotlight are Woo Yong-gak, 71, who has been in
prison over the past 41 years, and 16 other "unrepentant"
communist prisoners. If granted amnesty, they will be freed
without submitting written pledges to honor South Korean laws.
</P>
<P>
Yonhap also said Park Ji-man, son of the late president Park
Chung-hee and imprisoned for drug addiction, will be released
under the upcoming amnesty.
</P>
<P>
Last August, the South Korean government granted amnesty to
five million prisoners, most of whom committed minor offenses such
as traffic law violations.

<HEADLINE> Australia's State Governments Urged to Make United Response to Heroin Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 18 (Xinhua) --In an effort to force a united
response to the heroin problem, the Victorian state government may
put it on the agenda at the next meeting of heads of the state and
territory governments.
</P>
<P>
At least 60 users have died in Melbourne, capital of Victoria,
during the first 46 days of 1999, 15 more than the road toll for
the same period in the city.
</P>
<P>
Victoria's premier Jeff Kennett Thursday said he supported a
national controlled heroin trial. However, he also expressed
concern that trials might encourage further use and, then if they
did not work, a reversed approach of a crackdown would be needed,
Australian Associated Press reported from Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
Kennett expressed frustration at the problem, which he admitted
had worsened since he commissioned the Premier's Drug Advisory
Council in late 1995.
</P>
<P>
"I think we owe it to the community of Australia to have a
national approach starting with education, but then with detection
and then with penalties for those who peddle drugs while
recognizing in the main that those who use them are ... people
with a health problem," Kennett said.
</P>
<P>
Kennett also called for a tougher approach to drug importers
and dealers.
</P>
<P>
"It's not just dealing with these people (users); it's dealing
with those bastards who bring the stuff in," Kennett said.
</P>
<P>
The Victorian state government announced Thursday a further 6
million Australian dollars (3.8 million U.S. dollars) for two new
projects aimed at reducing heroin overdoses.
</P>
<P>
The campaign is particularly targeting heroin users, helping
them to understand the ways in which they can reduce the risk of
overdosing.
</P>
<P>
The second component of the scheme will give special training
to health, education and youth workers to ensure they are equipped
to help drug users.

<HEADLINE> Highway Rrobbers Steal Boxes of Gold Bar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February18 (Xinhua) -- Armed robbers attacked a van
conveying gold bars and made away with at least 10 boxes of the
precious metal which was being conveyed from a mine in the Ashanti
Region of Accra, capital of Ghana, the Ghanaian News Agency
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The robbers who attacked security personnel escorting the gold
bars Tuesday, also seized and took away two vehicles, which
happened to be on the spot of the robbery.
</P>
<P>
Some small cash in U.S. Dollars and in the Ghanaian Cedis was
also taken away from one of the occupants of the two vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The gold was being transported by road by a private security
agency on behalf of the owner, Amansie Mining Resources.
</P>
<P>
According to newspaper reports, the robbers numbering about 10,
wearing military gear and driving a Peugeot Estate, intercepted
the bullion van near Apam Junction, some 100 kilometers to Accra
at about 3.30 p.m. local time (1550 GMT) and after everything,
left the van and the men behind.
</P>
<P>
The regional police command confirmed the robbery, the first
of its kind in the country.
</P>

robbers' Peugeot car had been noted down by the escorts some of
whom were left unharmed.

<HEADLINE> French Police Arrest 14 PKK Supporters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 18 (Xinhua) -- French police have arrested 14
supporters of the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) in Paris and
questioned 346 Kurds who participated in protests against the
capture by Turkey of the PKK chief Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
Police sources said the arrested Kurds were involved in a three-
hour occupation of the Kenyan embassy in Paris on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Kurds also demonstrated in front of the Greek consulate in
Paris and the headquarters of the French Socialist Party over the
past two days.
</P>
<P>
Police have reinforced security measures in front of the
properties of Turkey in Paris, such as embassy and the Turkish air
company office.
</P>
<P>
About 20 Kurds have been occupying the office of the French
Communist Party in Strasbourg, demanding an intervention by the
French political parties in the Ocalan case.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the French press continued to give heavy coverage to
the Ocalan affair on Thursday, and they speculated on the
participation by Israel in the capture of Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
The violent accident in front of the Israeli consulate in
Berlin was also heavily reported by the French newspapers.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party newspaper "Humanite" Thursday condemned the
killing of three Kurds "like rabbits" by an Israeli guard in the
Berlin consulate and described the capture of Ocalan as an act of
"international piracy."
</P>
<P>
The French government has called on Turkey to give Ocalan a
fair trial.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac Wednesday expressed his belief
that Turkey would proceed the justice against Ocalan "in the
respect of a state of law."
</P>
<P>
"He was arrested, he is in prison. I am sure that his trial
will go ahead in the respect of the state of law," he said in an
interview with the American television APTV.

<HEADLINE> WHO Launches Global Initiative to Combat Avoidable Blindness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Aiming to eliminate avoidable
blindness by 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched
here Thursday a global initiative "Vision 2020: the Right to Sight
".
</P>
<P>
"Blindness represents a serious public health, social and
economic problem for our member states," said WHO Director-General
Gro Harlem Brundtland. "It is especially true for the developing
countries, where nine out of 10 of the world's blind live."
</P>
<P>
WHO estimates that there are about 180 million people worldwide
who are visually disabled. Of these, between 40 and 45 million
persons are blind and, by definition, cannot walk about unaided.
Around 60 percent of the world's blind reside in sub-Saharan
Africa, China and India.
</P>
<P>
Brundtland warned that the figure of the blind could double by
2020 if the present trend persisted because of the population
growth and ageing.
</P>
<P>
She believed that the only way to reduce the global burden of
blindness is a meaningful worldwide partnership.
</P>
<P>
"Vision 2020 is about partnership," she said. "We must be able
to reach out and form new partnerships to broaden the range of
collaborators also from fields not directly involved in health
care."
</P>
<P>
Cataract, trachoma, onchocerciasis, childhood blindness and
refractive errors and low vision are five immediate priorities
within the framework of Vision 2020.
</P>
<P>
"Cataract is responsible today for close to 50 percent of
global blindness," the WHO chief noted. "We are looking at a
disorder that is associated with ageing and affects all
populations around the world."
</P>
<P>
She said that fighting cataract would be one of the many
international activities highlighted in 1999, the International
Year of the Older Persons.
</P>
<P>
Vision 2020 will place emphasis on the training of mid-level
personnel through four five-year plans with the first one starting
in 2000.

<HEADLINE> Euro Zone Posts Trade Surplus With Rest of World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The euro zone posted a trade
surplus of 6.5 billion euros (7.3 billion U.S. dollars) with the
rest of the world in November last year, Eurostat reported on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Luxembourg-based statistical bureau of the European
community said that the 11-nation euro zone had nevertheless seen
a decrease of trade surplus by 1.8 billion euros on November 1997.
</P>
<P>
The trade surplus for the 15-nation European Union was 1.5
billion euros (1.7 billion dollars) in November 1998, whereas the
union had a trade surplus of 4.1 billion euros in the same month a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Trade with the rest of the world continued to be slowing last
November in both the euro zone and the European Union, largely due
to the financial and economic difficulties in Asia, Russia and
elsewhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
The euro zone trade surplus included that with the four EU
member states that had either opted to stay out or been left out
of the single currency mechanism.
</P>
<P>
The euro zone now includes Germany, France, Italy, Spain, the
Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Ireland, Portugal, Austria and
Finland. EU member states Britain, Sweden, Denmark and Greece are
outside the single currency zone.

<HEADLINE> Kurds to End Occupation of Greek Embassy in London </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The Kurdish protesters inside
the Greek embassy in London would finish their occupation at about
1300 GMT on Thursday, one of the campaigners inside the building
said.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to end it after the demonstration at one o'clock
this afternoon," he was quoted by media here as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Kurds, who are protesting at the capture by Turkey of their
leader Abdullah Ocalan, said they wanted to make a statement in
front of the building in Holland Park of west London at midday
before giving themselves up.
</P>
<P>
The protesters have been occupying the Greek mission for three
days, holding an embassy clerk hostage since early Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The protesters said on Wednesday that they had begun a hunger
strike and were prepared to set themselves on fire if police tried
to force them out of the building.
</P>
<P>
Police said earlier they would not use force to bring the siege
to an end.
</P>
<P>
A crowd of Kurds also spent a cold night on a nearby side road
to support the occupiers in the building, braving the sporadic
rain.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan, who is held responsible by the Turks for thousands of
killings, was arrested in Kenya on Monday after leaving the Greek
Embassy in Nairobi, where he had been given protection.
</P>
<P>
He is now in a prison in Turkey, the country against which his
guerrillas have fought a 14-year war.
</P>
<P>
During their three-day protest, the demonstrators in London
have demanded the British government and the United Nations to
stop the Turkish government from killing Ocalan.

<HEADLINE> 45 People Arrested for Attack on Leader's Brother </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Iranian authorities have
arrested 45 people in connection with the attack on Hadi
Khamenei, younger brother of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The arrests were made with the people's assistance and the
case has sent to the judiciary, according to a statement issued by
the office of Qom governor general Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Hadi Khamenei was beaten and injured by a group of hardliners
in the holy city of Qom, central Iran last Thursday night in a
mourning ceremony inside the Mohammadi Mosque for the sixth Imam
of the Shiite Muslims.
</P>
<P>
Hadi Khamenei, advisor to President Mohammad Khatami and
managing director of the pro-Khatami left-wing daily Jahan-e
Eslam (Islamic World), was taken to hospital due to severity of
the injuries, earlier reports said.
</P>
<P>
The attackers, calling Khamenei a "hypocrite," used stones,
pieces of wood, iron bars, shoes, praying stones and any other
objects they laid their hands on and attacked him before he
delivered a speech.
</P>
<P>
After the attack, Khatami ordered the interior and
intelligence ministries to probe into and seriously confront
those responsible for the attack.

<HEADLINE> Manila Optimistic About Peace Talks With Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Thursday that it will be able to forge peace with the Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF), following a commitment from both sides to
holding a meeting on March 1 to set the agenda of their informal
talks.
</P>
<P>
In a radio interview here Thursday, Manuel Yan, presidential
adviser on the peace process, said the technical committees of the
government and the MILF met last week and signed a new agreement
committing to continuing their preliminary peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He said that President Joseph Estrada and MILF Chairman Hashim
Salamat may meet in Mindanao next week.
</P>
<P>
"The president is scheduled to meet with Salamat but there's no
definite date yet, maybe next week," Yan said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada is scheduled to visit Mindanao in the last week of
February to see for himself the status of government projects in
the south and find out what needs to be done further to put its
development on the fast lane.
</P>
<P>
The president said he is willing to meet Salamat at a neutral
venue in Mindanao to help move the peace process forward and
determine how the MILF can help the government speed up
development projects in the area.
</P>
<P>
"There's no question that we can achieve peace because both
sides have already committed to continuing the peace talks," Yan
said.
</P>
<P>
At present, Yan said, the committee on the cessation of
hostilities is meeting to agree on the boundaries and areas
occupied by the MILF in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
He said the government continues to explore all avenues to
pursue genuine and lasting peace in Mindanao by tapping the help
of all groups, such as religious organizations.
</P>
<P>
The 12,000-strong MILF, the major rebel group in the
Philippines, has been fighting for an independent Muslim state in
Mindanao over the past 20 years.

<P>
SHANGHAI, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The cross-century project to
improve shipping conditions at the mouth of the Yangtze River,
China's longest river, has been progressing smoothly, with a 9.9-
kilometer-long dike already completed.
</P>
<P>
This project, launched on January 27, 1998, is aimed at
clearing and deepening the channel as part of the nation's
ambitious effort to turn Shanghai into an international shipping
center.
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to cost 3.27 billion yuan for its first
phase, which will take three years to complete. By the year 2000,
the depth of the shipping channel at the mouth of the Yangtze will
be increased from seven meters to 8.5 meters.
</P>
<P>
The ultimate goal of the three-phase project is to raise the
depth at the mouth to 12.5 meters to allow ships of a deadweight
of more than 100,000 tons to enter the Shanghai harbor.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai harbor, handled 3.06 million TEUs last year,
ranking as the world's tenth largest container terminal.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The city of Shanghai has
removed its restrictions on the use of electricity this year as
power supplies increase, according to an official source.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, with help from the East China Power Grid, is now able
to stop power outages and restrictions on power use, a Municipal
Power Administration official says.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai plans to generate 44.9 billion kwh of electricity this
year, up 4.6 percent from 1998. The peak power load in the summer
has been estimated at 9.7 million kw, an increase of 8 percent
from last year.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the official said, Shanghai will use some 3 billion
yuan to renovate its power grid this year to increase power
supplies and improve reliability and will build nine 220,000-volt
transformers and seven 220,000-volt power lines this year. To
regulate use, Shanghai will raise price limits during peak seasons
to encourage power use at night, especially late at night, he said.

<HEADLINE> World Gold Demand Recovers Remarkably </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Gold demand in the last
quarter of 1998 recovered remarkably, reaching the highest level
ever recorded in any three-month period, the World Gold Council
announced here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Fourth quarter demand in the countries monitored by the World
Gold Council was 807 tons, six percent above the fourth quarter of
1997 and just ahead of the previous record for any quarter," the
council said in a news release.
</P>
<P>
Demand for 1998 as a whole was 2,712 tons, 11 percent below the
annual record set in 1997, it said.
</P>
<P>
Overall demand in the developing markets was 19 percent below
the 1997 level while demand in the developed markets was 11
percent above 1997.
</P>
<P>
The fourth quarter record was the result of strong demand in
the United States, Europe, Brazil and Mexico, and steady
performance in the Middle East, which more than offset the
continued impact of the economic and currency crisis in several
Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
George Milling-Stanley, manager of Gold Market Analysis, said
at a briefing in Johannesburg that the year 1998 should be seen as
a year of recovery.
</P>
<P>
"Looking at the year quarter by quarter: after three months,
gold consumption was running 40 percent behind the 1997 level;
after six months, the decline was 24 percent, and after nine
months, demand was still running 17 percent below that for the
same period of 1997.
</P>
<P>
"The shortfall of just 11 percent for the full year represents
a significant recovery after a poor start."
</P>
<P>
The poor performance at the first few months of 1998 was due to
" substantial dishoarding" prompted by the financial crisis in
Asia, he said.
</P>
<P>
Milling-Stanley interpreted the gold demand trends in 1998 as
"a growing appreciation of the role of gold as a monetary asset".
</P>
<P>
"There were continued strong gains in the demand for gold as an
 investment."
</P>
<P>
"All over the world, investors are looking for ways to preserve
their wealth, and increasingly those investors are starting to
turn to gold," he said.
</P>
<P>
The World Gold Council, with its headquarters in Geneva,
Switzerland, is an international organization formed and funded by
leading gold mining companies from around the world to increase
the demand for gold.
</P>
<P>
It monitors 27 countries which account for 80 percent of global
gold demand.

<HEADLINE> 15 Die in 1998 Under Oregon Assisted-Suicide Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, February 17 (Xinhua) -- A report released
Wednesday said in the first year under Oregon's groundbreaking
assisted-suicide law, the only one in the United States, there are
no signs the state has become the "death mecca" as its harshest
critics had feared.
</P>
<P>
The first report on Oregon's Death with Dignity Act showed that
doctors prescribed lethal drugs to 23 people in 1998, and 15 died
after taking the drugs. Another six died of their illnesses, while
two were alive as of January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
"Just a few individuals are using it, and when it is used it is
used very carefully," said the report, adding that there were 29,
000 deaths in Oregon in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Backers of assisted suicide said the report, to be published in
Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine, shows the law is being
implemented in Oregon very reasonably and very carefully.
</P>
<P>
First approved in 1994 and reaffirmed by Oregon voters in
November 1997, the law allows a doctor to prescribe a lethal dose
of medication to hasten the death of patients who have less than
six months to live.
</P>
<P>
Oregon health officials said the study also disproved fears of
opponents that the law would result in a lower standard of care,
or that terminally ill patients would be pushed into suicide by
financial concerns.
</P>
<P>
"It's very positive to have the relatives gather around and say
their final goodbyes, and to reminisce about their family stories,
said Dr. Peter Rasmussen, a Salem oncologist who has assisted in
two suicides.
</P>
<P>
But opponents of Physician-assisted suicide were unmoved,
continue to criticize it as "dismissing the value of human life".

<P>
-- Three Kurdish demonstrators were killed on Wednesday by
Israeli security guards outside the Israeli consulate in Berlin,
when they tried to occupy the consulate to protest suspected
Israeli participation in the abduction of PKK leader Abdullah
Ocalan. After forcing back the attorneys of Ocalan, Turkey has
banned the presence of international observers during his trial.
</P>
<P>
-- President Jacques Chirac starts a three-day state visit to

</P>
<P>
-- In the wake of the capture of PKK chief Abdullah Ocalan, a
deadly shooting accident took place on Wednesday in front of the
Israeli consulate in Berlin, during which three Kurdish
demonstrators were killed and dozens injured by Israeli security
guards. German police have arrested more than one thousand Kurds
around the country to prevent an outbreak of violence.
</P>
<P>
-- Israel is suspected to have been involved in the kidnapping
of Ocalan because the Jewish state has established a strategic
alliance with Turkey under a military cooperation agreement of
1996. The agreement includes the exchange of intelligence
information on the organizations considered to be ``terrorist'' by
either of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Le Monde:
</P>
<P>
-- All the political groups of Ankara hailed the capture of
Ocalan as a historic event on the fight against the separatist
group the PKK. Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said the
arrest of ``Apo'' will be a solution to the Kurdish problem. Some
political leaders said that it is time to ``extend the hand'' to
the Kurdish population in southeast Anatolia.
</P>
<P>
-- Less than two hours after being accused by the German press
agency DPA of being involved in the abduction of Ocalan, Israel
categorically denied the charge. DPA quoted western intelligence
sources as saying that the Mossad played a decisive role in the
affair.

<HEADLINE> Two Cleared for Nigeria's Presidential Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Independent National Electoral
Commission (INEC) of Nigeria has cleared General Olusegun Obasanjo
of the People's Democratic Party (PDP) and Chief Olu Falae of the
All People's Party (APP) as candidates for February 27
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Also cleared was Obasanjo's running mate Alhaji Abubakar Atiku,
INEC Chairman Justice Ephraim Akpata announced Wednesday at the
end of the screening exercise in capital Abuja, New Nigerian
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said Falae's running mate Alhaji Umaru Shinkafi of the APP
would be screened later as he obtained permission to attend to an
urgent assignment in Lagos.
</P>
<P>
The INEC chief explained that the registered Alliance for
Democracy (AD) did not present a candidate for the forthcoming
presidential election and for that, any vote in favor of the party
on February 27 polls would be declared void.
</P>
<P>
He said at a press conference that the AD and the APP had
informed the INEC about the alliance between them and "we have
taken cognizance of this fact."
</P>
<P>
During the screening exercise, he added, Falae who was chosen
as AD presidential candidate presented his voter registration
card and his APP membership card, and "we were satisfied with
them."
</P>
<P>
National Secretary of the APP Josiah Odunna declared in Abuja
Wednesday that Ogbonnaya Onu who was picked as the party's
presidential flag bearer had agreed with the party on the choice
of Chief Olu Falae as the alliance candidate.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the APP and the AD may demand a two-week
postponement of the February 27 polls to perfect their
newly-formed alliance, saying that the period before February 27
is too short to make for an effective electoral campaign for the
presidential candidates.

ISLAMABAD, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif may visit India at a time yet to be decided by the
two sides, Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The reports that Sharif will accompany his Indian counterpart
Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who is going to visit Pakistan on February
20-21 on the occasion of inaugural cross border bus service
between the two countries, on his return journey to India are not
correct, Aziz told a press briefing here Thursday morning.

The Pakistani prime minister is not scheduled to visit India
immediately after the bus journey of Vajpayee, Aziz said.
</P>

He said Sharif's visit to India depends on the outcome of the
talks between the two prime ministers during Vajpayee's

MANILA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The Bureau of Internal Revenue
(BIR) of the Philippines Thursday urged business establishments to
follow the government's revenue regulation on value-added tax
(VAT).
</P>
<P>
BIR Commissioner Beethoven Rualo told reporters that those who
fail to obey the rule will be fined at least 5,000 pesos (125 U.S.
dollars) for the first offense.
</P>

Rualo issued the warning after the bureau found out that there
are still some business establishments ignoring the directive of
lumping the 10 percent VAT with the total amount in the receipt to
avoid confusion of the customers.
</P>
<P>
According to him, some business establishments issue receipts
that show separate VAT.
</P>
<P>
These establishments might be cheating customers by charging
double VAT, Rualo added.

<HEADLINE> Scientists: Tomatoes May Lower Cancer Risk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Tomatoes, a staple of the
western diet, could be one of the best defenses against cancer, U.
S. researchers reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Of 72 studies, 35 showed a link between increased tomato intake
and lower cancer risk -- usually a 40 percent reduction in risk,
according to Dr. Edward Giovannucci, of the Brigham and Women's
Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
Giovannucci leads a team of researchers who have compared the
diets of cancer patients to healthy people the same age and
reported their findings in the February 17th issue of the Journal
of the National Cancer Institute.
</P>
<P>
"The evidence for a benefit was strongest for cancers of the
prostate, lung and stomach," Giovannucci said.
</P>
<P>
Other researchers believe that tomatoes are rich in vitamins C
and A, as well as folic acid and potassium -- all vital nutrients.
Vitamins C and A are linked with a lower risk of cancer, and folic
acid is important for preventing heart disease and other problems,
they added.
</P>
<P>
Biovannucci said what makes tomatoes unique is lycopene, which
may account for or contribute to these benefits, "but this
possibility is not yet proven and requires further study."

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Bans Importing Rotten Cereals for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government
has ordered various regions to ban the import of rotten cereals
for domestic animals, fearing that they might be misused.
</P>
<P>
"We have discovered that some businessmen are fooling us and
selling food to people which is unfit for human consumption," a
government statement said, quoted by The Guardian newspaper on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The statement, issued Wednesday by the official Tanzania
Information Services, said that unscrupulous businessmen have been
importing rotten food purporting to be for cattle but selling the
food to human beings.
</P>
<P>
The businessmen are taking advantage of a food shortage in the
country resulted from a prolonged drought starting October last
year.
</P>
<P>
"Regional commissioners along the border must make sure that
such grain is not imported into the country," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Frederick Sumaye said earlier this week that
Tanzania needs some 561,000 tons of food between now and May to
alleviate the looming famine in the country.
</P>
<P>
Sumaye said the newly planted crops have also started to wilt
due to lack of rains and unusually higher temperatures.

<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Intel Corp, the world's
largest computer microprocessor maker, sets 300 million U.S.
dollars to launch its largest advertising and marketing campaign
for Pentium III, available in personal computers on February 26,
according to a report from the company late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 companies gathered in San Jose Wednesday to
preview software and other products designed for Pentium III
microprocessor, which will supply the brainpower for personal
computers initially costing about 2,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Few technical details about the pentium III processor were
available, except the clock speeds, which will start at 450 and
500 megahertz when the product is shipped next week by PC makers.
Intel executives said a Pentium III running at 550 megahertz will
be available sometime in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
Intel leaked samples of Pentium III processor, using a code
name "Katmai", to several hundred software and hardware developers
about a year ago so they could invest games and business programs
that depend on pentium III.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Standards of Living Drop: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe is facing a challenge
to halting the declining standards of living inherited from
distorted social and economic structures, the weekly Business
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The deteriorating economic environment has hampered present
poverty alleviation programs. The government has been forced to
divert its attention to more pressing issues such as the
depreciating currency and meeting budgetary targets, the Business
reported.
</P>
<P>
Funding by non-governmental organizations has also declined as
financiers adjust their pockets in line with the dictates of the
trading conditions. Zimbabwe has, as a result, slipped in human
development rankings from 111 out of 160 countries to 130 out of
174 countries as of last year.
</P>
<P>
A study conducted by the Central Statistical Office (CSO) noted
that 76 percent of the rural population is now deemed poor while
41 percent of people in the urban centers have also joined the
ranks of poor people.
</P>
<P>
Poverty continues to deepen with far reaching consequences in
rural areas than in urban areas because of skewed living
standards, which are higher than those found in the region.
</P>
<P>
Major cities, particularly Harare, the country's capital, and
Bulawayo, the country's second largest city have been bogged down
by the poverty burden along with other provincial capitals, more
prone to poor rainfall patterns.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's anti-Israeli
guerrilla group Hezbollah, or Party of God, has confiscated
Israeli-made dairy products from Lebanese villagers in south
Lebanon, the Daily Star reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The party announced on Wednesday that they had seized four
boxes containing a total of 120 bottles of milk and yogurt in the
village of Srifa, east of the country's southern port city of
Tyre and a few kilometers from the Israeli occupied zone in
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The plastic bottles with Hebrew writing on them were taken
away from the villagers, who allegedly tried to sell them in the
country, by local Hezbollah members to the party's office in the
city, a spokesman for the group said.
</P>
<P>
"The boxes will be handed to the Lebanese authorities, who
will launch an investigation into the matter," he added.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon, which observes an Arab boycott against Israeli
products, is officially at war with the Jewish state who set up a
self-styled security zone in 1985 in south Lebanon to allegedly
protect its north from Lebanese guerrillas' attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah is leading a guerrilla war trying
to oust Israeli occupation forces and its ally South Lebanon Army
from the country.
</P>
<P>
The party's leader in southern Lebanon Sheik Nabil Qaouq said
smuggling, selling or using Israeli made goods, even if they are
gifts, is religiously, nationally and morally forbidden.
</P>
<P>
"Those who deal with these products are traitors to their
nation, and we urge the concerned authorities to investigate the
matter and adopt stricter measures to prevent such acts," he said.
</P>
<P>
He called on Lebanese people to report the presense of any
Israeli goods on the markets.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Unemployment Up in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Some 195,000 people were
unemployed in Israel in 1998, or 8.6 percent of the workforce on
average, according figures issued Thursday by the Central Bureau
of Statistics.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment peaked in the third quarter of 1998 at 205,000,
or 8.9 percent of the total workforce. The construction was one
of the hardest-hit sectors because of its prolonged recession.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, unemployment continued to be higher among women,
their average was 9.4 percent, compared with 7.3 percent among
men.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 workforce came to 2.272 million people, an increase
of 2.8 percent over 1997. The proportion of civilian workers over
the age of 15 to the total population stood at 53.5 percent,
nearly the same as in 1997. Out of the total, 1.266 million were
men, an increase of 2.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The situation in the construction industry reflected the worst
of Israel's economic slowdown. Comparison of the 1998 figures
with 1996 showed that more than 20,000 people have lost their
jobs.
</P>
<P>
About 26,000 Palestinians and another 35,000 foreigners are
currently employed by the construction sector, as well as
130,000 Israelis.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Hopes to See Constructive Indo-Pak PM Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan hopes the prime
ministers of Pakistan and India will have "meaningful and
constructive" talks to move the dialogue process forward during
Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's upcoming visit to
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee is going to make a visit to Pakistan on February 20-21
on the occasion of inaugural trans border bus service between the
two South Asian nations. This will be the first visit by an Indian
head of state to Pakistan in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a weekly press briefing here Thursday, Foreign
Minister Sartaj Aziz said that Vajpayee's visit provides "an
historic opportunity" for talks on all the outstanding issues
between the two countries at the highest political level.
</P>
<P>
"If we are able to seize the opportunities and establish a
tension free and stable environment, it would permit our two
peoples to channelize their energies and resources to the more
pressing requirements of nation building and socio-economic
development," said Aziz.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee and his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif agreed in
their joint statement in New York last September that an
environment of durable peace and stability was in the supreme
national interest of both countries as well as the region.
</P>
<P>
"We expect that the two leaders should agree on concrete
measures to build on the commitments contained in their joint
statement," Aziz noted.
</P>
<P>
In the forthcoming talks between the two prime ministers, the
settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir issue will again be accorded
the highest priority, said Aziz.
</P>
<P>
Sharif will once again stress the centrality of "this
fundamental issue in the Pak-Indo bilateral relationship",
according to Aziz.
</P>
<P>
In the post-nuclear test security environment in the South
Asian region, issues related to peace and security and the Jammu
and Kashmir dispute have acquired an added significance, said
Aziz. "Its implications are no longer limited to the region but
extend beyond."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan will also like to see the early resolution of the
other disputes between the two countries, including Siachen,
Wullar Barrage and Sir Creek, Aziz added.
</P>
<P>
Aziz stressed that Pakistan has taken a number of
confidence-building measures, including unilateral release of
Indian fishermen, New Delhi-Lahore bus service, sale of
electricity and enhanced sports contacts, to improve the
atmosphere of serious and meaningful negotiations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
"India must now reciprocate our sincerity of purpose if the
present dialogue is to succeed," he added. "It must seriously
commit itself to a solution of the root cause of the tensions and
hostilities between the two countries, namely, the Jammu and
Kashmir dispute."
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee is scheduled to make the inaugural journey of the bus
service between New Delhi and Lahore, capital of Pakistan's Punjab
province, Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee and Sharif will hold the third meeting between them
and the seventh between the prime ministers of Pakistan and India
since the resumption of the bilateral dialogue in 1997.

<HEADLINE> E. Africa Business Directory Ready in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The national chambers of
commerce and industry of the three east African countries are
doing preparatory work to compile a business directory, the first
of its kind in the region, to promote regional trade and
investment.
</P>
<P>
Raphael Omusi, senior trade officer of the Kenya National
Chamber of Commerce and Industry told Xinhua Thursday that the
data and material gathering for the publication of the directory
is still underway and the directory will come off the press in
June this year.
</P>
<P>
As the state heads of the three east African countries are to
ratify the Draft Treaty of the East African Community in July, the
initiative to publish the book is aimed at giving up-to-date
business information and boosting trade within the wider east
African market.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that the directory, in printed version and
computer disc, will contain such information as company's name,
founding date, number of employees, annual turnover and top
management etc.
</P>
<P>
According to Omusi, the book will give detailed information to
many investors and businessmen who want to acquaint themselves
with the general business potential of the region as it comes off
the press and will be distributed in Africa and other continents.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Embassies, Airport on top Alert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Extraordinarily tight
security were imposed since Wednesday night at Israeli embassies
worldwide, on national flag carrier planes and at Ben Gurion
International Airport for fear of revenge attacks by Kurdish
separatists.
</P>
<P>
The security measures were taken following the shooting
incident Wednesday at Israeli consulate in Berlin, in which three
Kurdish protestors were killed by Israeli guards.
</P>
<P>
The decision by the Israeli security guards to open fire was
"justified," said a preliminary probe of the Israel's Internal
Security Service Shin Bet.
</P>
<P>
However, the probe also turned up serious questions related to
the demonstrators's success in penetrating the consulate building
and the prior measures that were taken, particularly in the light
of reports that Kurds may launch more attacks on Israeli
legations.
</P>
<P>
In the Wednesday incident, Israeli security guards in the
Berlin consulate shot dead three Kurds, one of them a woman, and
wounded 15 others, including a 11-year-old boy, when a crowd of
about 50 to 70 Kurds stormed the building and briefly took a
woman staffer hostage.
</P>
<P>
The Kurds were apparently incensed over reports that Israel's
intelligence Mossad had been involved in the capture of Kurdish
leader Abdullah Acalan in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
A more thorough investigation of the incident will start
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
After holding three hours of meeting with security officials
in Tel Aviv Wednesday night, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
also spoke with German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's senior
advisor on internal security Dieter Hombach.
</P>
<P>
While the incident was still under investigation, Foreign
Ministry contacted its missions across Europe and urged
non-essential personnel to leave the premises immediately.
</P>
<P>
In Israel, tight security were also beefed up around the
embassies of Turkey, Greece and Cyprus.

<HEADLINE> Red-Crowned Cranes Pass Winter In East China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Over 1,400 red-crowned cranes
have flown from the cold northern China to pass winter in the
Yancheng Precious Birds Nature Reserve in coastal Jiangsu Province
in east China.
</P>
<P>
The reserve is located along the coast of the Yellow Sea,
covering over 400,000 hectares of polders in five cities and
counties. Before the mid 1980s, only about 200 red-crowned cranes,
which are under the category one national protection, flew to the
area every winter.
</P>
<P>
In order to better protect the precious species, an
administrative office was set up in the reserve in 1984. Two years
later, the reserve successfully experimented on artificial
breeding of the rare bird.
</P>
<P>
In October 1992, the nature reserve was upgraded to the
national level. The following month, it joined the International
Man and Biosphere Reserve Network sponsored by the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.
</P>
<P>
Now the reserve receives over 80 percent of the wild red-crown
cranes of the world.

HANGZHOU, February 18 (Xinhua) -- China displaced and resettled
a record 18.393 million people who fell victims to the devastating
summer flooding in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The human and material resources used for the displacement also
broke the records of China's disaster relief history, a national
meeting on disaster relief held here was told.
</P>
<P>
The affected localities, including Hubei, Hunan, Anhui,
Heilongjiang, and Jilin provinces, make painstaking efforts and
accumulated precious experiences in providing temporary dwellings,
food, clothing and medical treatment in the process of the
displacement.

The regions made a wonder by successfully ensuring the safety
of every victim in the emergency resettlement.

JERUSALEM, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news

<P>
Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli embassies throughout Europe closed since Wednesday
and diplomats went on alert for escalating Kurdish violence,
following the killing of three Kurdish protestors who stormed the
Israeli consulate in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- In a statement issued in New York, Israeli Foreign Minister
Ariel Sharon asserted that the incident in Berlin "makes clear
again how right the Israeli government was to insist on the
uncompromising struggle against terrorism in all its forms,
including Palestinian terrorism, against which the Palestinian
National Authority is not taking proper action."
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Wednesday that
Israel was not involved in Turkish's capture of Kurdish leader
Abdullah Ocalan and the security guards in the Israeli consulate
in Berlin opened fire only after a Kurdish demonstrator tried to

<HEADLINE> Chinese Customs Strive to Protect Joint Ventures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 18 (Xinhua) -- China's General Administration
of Customs said the customs houses nationwide will strengthen the
crackdown on brandname products smuggling in a bid to protect the
interests of joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
Smuggling of products manufactured by some famous joint
ventures has been rampant in China's coastal regions since 1998.
The evasion of tariff and value added taxes of these products has
resulted in great losses to China's customs, and the low prices of
smuggled goods have disturbed the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
Take Lux soap of Shanghai Unilever for example, the smuggled
Lux soaps evaded 100 million yuan of tariff last year and reduced
the market share of Shanghai Unilever by 50 percent, which brought
about a drop in the company's tax by 45 million yuan as against
1997.
</P>
<P>
China will step up protection of legal rights of the joint
ventures funded by foreign companies and in turn help maintain a
healthy domestic market order, officials said.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Army General Abducted by Anti-Government Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The New People's Army, an
anti-government armed group in the Philippines, has abducted an
army brigadier general and a captain in the Southern Philippine
city of Davao, an official report said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine News Agency reported Thursday that Brig. Gen.
Victor Obillo and Capt. Eduardo Montealto were kidnapped by the
anti-government group while inspecting an engineering project on
the outskirts of Davao City Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that Obillo, commanding general of the 55th
Army Engineering Brigade, and his logistics officer, Montealto
were snatched by heavily armed guerrillas of the New People's Army
after their vehicle were blocked in Carmen, Baguio District, Davao
City Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
But Obillo's driver and a civilian were not touched by the
rebels who asked them to report the incident to their
headquarters, it said.
</P>
<P>
The anti-government group kidnapped the two military officers
in a bid to force a prisoner-swap with the government, which has
rejected the proposed swap in the past, according to the agency.

<P>
MANILA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The Bureau of Internal Revenue
(BIR) of the Philippines Thursday urged business establishments to
follow the government's revenue regulation on value-added tax
(VTA).
</P>
<P>
BIR Commissioner Beethoven Rualo told reporters that those who
fail to obey the rule will be fined at least 5,000 pesos (125 U.S.
dollars) for the first offense.
</P>
<P>
Rualo issued the warning after the bureau found out that there
are still some business establishments ignoring the directive of
lumping the 10 percent VTA with the total amount in the receipt to
avoid confusion of the customers.
</P>
<P>
According to him, some business establishments issue receipts
that show separate VAT.
</P>
<P>
These establishments might be cheating customers by charging
double VAT, Rualo added.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Govt Withdraws Price Hikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean Minister of
Industry and Commerce has directed all millers and bakers to
withdraw immediately the price increases they have effected on
flour and bread since the government has not approved them, the
daily Herald reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Minister Nathan Shamuyarira, who held a meeting with the millers
 Wednesday afternoon, told the paper that the government wanted to
keep the prices of basic foodstuffs low and affordable.
</P>
<P>
The millers had been allowed to increase their prices by 22
percent last October but they were now saying this had been eroded
by the 67 percent fuel price hikes and the 20 percent cost of
living adjustment awarded by the government to workers in December
last year.
</P>
<P>
"I impressed on them that they must withdraw the increases
that they have made and the ball is now in their court. They are
going to think about it," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
The price of bread went up by 16 percent or more early this
month after millers increased the price of flour without
government approval.
</P>
<P>
"They (millers) indicated that it would be very difficult for
them to comply with my request because they have already increased
the prices and were already in operation," said the minister,
adding, "I still stressed to them that they must comply."

<HEADLINE> Most Ugandan MPs Fail to Declare Riches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Most of Uganda's 279 MPs
including Vice President Specioza Kazibwe and ministers have
failed to declare their incomes, assets and liabilities for the
year 1998 as required.
</P>
<P>
Under the Leadership Code, all the MPs should report their
riches to Inspector General of Government (IGG) Jotham Tumwesigye
at the end of the year, the Monitor newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the IGG wrote to the Speaker of Parliament
Francis Ayume on February 10, requesting him to remind the MPs not
to breach the code.
</P>
<P>
Tumwesigye told the Speaker that on September 18, 1998 his
office distributed forms to all MPs for completion but only 15 out
of the 279 legislators complied.
</P>
<P>
According to section five of the Leadership Code made in 1992,
leaders are required to submit their statements of income, assets
and liabilities to the IGG within three months after becoming a
leader; and annually during the month of December.
</P>
<P>
This act by the MPs is clear defiance of the law and should be
stopped, the report said.

<P>
The Citizen:
</P>
<P>
-- South Africa's opposition parties were highly critical of
Wednesday's 1999/2000 budget, accusing the government of a
populist, pre-election budget that avoided the realities which
need to be addressed.
</P>
<P>
The Star:
</P>
<P>
-- South African Airways, the national airline, would shed
between 900 and 1,100 of its nearly 11,000 jobs in a huge

HANGZHOU, February 18 (Xinhua) -- China displaced and resettled
a record 18.393 people who fell victims to the devastating summer
flooding in 1998.
</P>

The affected localities, including Hubei, Hunan, Anhui,
Heilongjiang, and Jilin provinces, make painstaking efforts and

food, clothing and medical treatment in the process of the
displacement.
</P>
<P>
The regions made a wonder by successfully ensuring the safety
of every victim in the emergency resettlement.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, one third to half of the damaged
houses in northern China areas had been rebuilt, and 90 percent of
the victims in southern China had moved into new houses before the
Spring Festival.

NAIROBI, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Kenyan newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Kenya Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The Kenyan government moved swiftly Wednesday and imposed a
temporary closure of all its missions abroad and put them under
high security alert in the wake of terrorist threats and
spontaneous attacks by pro-Kurdish sympathizers, following the
arrest of their leader Abdallah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
Daily Nation:

<HEADLINE> Way of Thinking on Spring Festival at Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, February 18 (Xinhua) -- About two thirds of the
residents questioned in a survey in Shenyang, capital of Liaoning
Province, said that they are no longer so interested in the
traditional Lunar New Year.
</P>
<P>
The recent survey showed that about 64 percent of the
respondents said they do not have a big buying plan during the
festival, also known as the "spring festival", which traditionally
featured rich family banquet and gift-giving to relatives and
friends, and a chance to put on new clothes.
</P>
<P>
However, 12 percent of the people said they plan to travel
during the holidays, which are the longest of the year in China.
Statistics also show that about 4,000 Shenyang residents will
travel to overseas while 7,000 to other parts of the country in
this year's Spring Festival.
</P>
<P>
While in the past Spring Festival gifts focused on foodstuffs
and fruits, now one third of the people expressed their wish to
receive fresh flowers or greeting cards and books.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the change in the concept on the Spring Festival
is a reflection of the improved living standard and higher
expectation on cultural life and the wish to further improve the
quality of life.
</P>
<P>
Despite the change, Lunar New Year will remain one of the most
important holidays in the country, they added.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Foreign Minister on Indo-Pak Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Foreign Minister
Sartaj Aziz has made it clear that no quarter would be given to
India on the Kashmir issue when the prime ministers of India and
Pakistan hold discussions on a whole range of subjects on February
20-21.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview Wednesday in Islamabad with India's
one of the major English newspapers "The Hindu", which made it
public, Aziz said, "We think that engaging in a dialogue on
Kashmir is the only route. The higher the level of dialogue, the
more meaningful it can be. So, I don't think the fact that there
have been a few things such as bus service, sale of electricity to
India, cricket match mean a dilution of Pakistan's principled
position on Kashmir."
</P>
<P>
India and Pakistan Wednesday signed a formal agreement for the
commencement of the Delhi-Lahore bus service, which is to be
inaugurated by Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee when he
travels to Lahore, Pakistan on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee will head a 16-member delegation for discussions with
the Pakistani side during his two day visit to Lahore. He is
expected to be received at the Wagah Border by Pakistan Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif.
</P>
<P>
When asked what would be the agenda for the summit talks
between Vajpayee and Sharif, the Pakistan foreign minister said
that while an entire range of issues would come up, the focus
would remain on core issues including Kashmir, the major dispute
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Asked how he perceived the symbolism behind an Indian prime
minister taking the first-ever cross-border bus trip in decades to
visit Pakistan, Aziz said that Pakistan was interested in a
"meaningful dialogue" with India. It should become a meaningful,
result-oriented dialogue, conducted in a business-like manner so
that the issues that have plagued the relationship between the two
countries for all these years could be addressed in a more
sustainable manner. "We regard it as more than symbolism because
it is happening after many years that an Indian prime minister is
visiting Pakistan..." he said.

<HEADLINE> Lome IV Talks Search for Successor Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Negotiations for a successor
agreement to Lome IV, a trade partnership between the 15-member
European Union (EU) and 71 African, Caribbean and the Pacific
states (ACP), will begin, with the final pact expected to be
signed early next year, an official here has said.
</P>
<P>
President of the ACP National Chambers of Commerce, Industry
and other Economic operators Danny Meyer refuted Wednesday the
rumor that the new agreement would result in ACP nations losing
preferential access into the lucrative EU market, the daily Herald
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Negotiations for a successor agreement are now starting but
this does not mean the position will change. It is not true that
we might lose everything. We might come out with a stronger
position," said Meyer.
</P>
<P>
He urged the private sectors in the ACP states to contribute to
 negotiations for a successor agreement and work together to
strengthen the relationship with the EU.
</P>
<P>
Lome IV centers mainly on trade and allows the 71 ACP states
preferential access into the 15-member EU market. The agreement
is due to expire next February.
</P>
<P>
Reports quoted Glenys Kinnock, a member of European Parliament
and Vice- President of the ACP-EU joint assembly, as saying Monday
that ACP states such as Zimbabwe, Mauritius, Gabon, Senegal and
Cote d'Ivoire were now on the EU list of "non-least developed
countries" which should not enjoy the preferential market access.
</P>
<P>
""Such countries should no longer qualify for this and there
have been suggestions that there should be regional cooperation
leading to free trade areas with only the least developed
countries benefiting from the previous agreement," Kinnock said.
</P>
<P>
Kinnock was in Harare on a five-day visit collecting
information for a European Parliamentary report concerning the
cooperation between ACP and the EU in the post Lome era.
</P>
<P>
She also held meetings with the Zimbabwe National Chamber of
Commerce, Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries and other business
representative bodies.

<P>
BEIJING, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Sources from the Ministry of
Land and Resources revealed that one billion cubic meters of
underground water can be exploited annually in the arid northwest
China.
</P>
<P>
The newly-discovered underground water will supply adequate
fresh water to the region, which will in turn boost the growth of
the region's mining and chemical industry, agriculture, and animal
husbandry, experts said.
</P>
<P>
Scientific research and exploration show that large natural
reservoirs are buried underground in Qaidam Basin in Qinghai
Province and Tarim, Junggar Basins as well as Taklimakan Desert in
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The supply of fresh water in Taklimakan Desert is crucial to
the exploration of oil and natural gas there, experts said, adding
that it will also benefit the local ecosystem in the water-
deficient regions and regions without potable water.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Industrial Output Down Last December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The year-on-year industrial
production and sales in the Philippines declined last December and
caused the further slowdown of the nation's economy, the National
Statistics Office said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a report released here, the office said that value of
production in the manufacturing sector decreased by 5.8 percent
and its corresponding volume by 10.6 percent last December from a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
The drop in value of production was due to the decline in 10
out of 16 sectors, such as petroleum products, wearing apparel,
electrical machinery and transport equipment, the office said.
</P>
<P>
"The volume of production index declined by 10.6 percent.
Decreases were observed in nine out of 16 sectors led by petroleum
refineries which declined by 23.4 percent," it said.
</P>
<P>
The office said that other sectors which largely contributed to
the negative performance of the overall production volume include
wearing apparel, food manufacturing, chemicals and transport
equipment.
</P>
<P>
The volume of the net sales for last December posted a decline
of 6 percent over the same month in 1997, it said.
</P>
<P>
The drops in the manufacturing sector could be attributed to
the credit crunch and weak consumption demand in the country in
1998, economists said.
</P>
<P>
The declines in the manufacturing sector, coupled with the poor
agricultural performance, made the country's gross domestic
product shrink by 0.5 percent last year.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar's Fertility Rate Declines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The fertility rate of Myanmar
women declined and the contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR)
increased between 1991 and 1997, according to the findings of the
country's fertility and reproductive health survey (FRHS).
</P>
<P>
The CPR of Myanmar women was found to be 33 percent in 1997,
said U Saw Tun, Myanmar Minister of Immigration and Population, at
a dissemination workshop on findings of FRHS for entry into the
country report to be issued, official newspaper The New Light of
Myanmar reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The two-day workshop, which began here Wednesday, is jointly
conducted by the Myanmar ministry and the U.N. Population Fund
(UNFPA).
</P>
<P>
U Saw Tun quoted the findings of the FRHS as saying that "the
birth and death rates are declining and the population growth
rate is also declining finally resulting in a decline in the
proportion of the younger ages, the growing number of the
population in the working ages and the old age population."
</P>
<P>
As for fertility, it is higher among rural women than urban
with the western Rakhine state having the highest fertility rate
which reflects the slow progress of the region in the past, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that about 55 percent of Myanmar women and over 12
percent of those aged between 45-49 are of never-married category,
indicating an unusual finding about Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
This high proportion of never-married accounted for 50 percent
of the fertility decline of the country, he added.
</P>
<P>
As part of the country's birth-spacing program, the Myanmar
ministry undertook the FRHS in 1997, the second countrywide
demographic survey, to produce reliable estimates of major survey
variables for the whole country, including both urban and rural
areas.
</P>
<P>
The first survey, which was population changes and fertility
survey (PCFS) and conducted in 1991, showed Myanmar's fertility
rate standing at 3.5 but it dropped to 2.8 in the 1997 survey.
</P>
<P>
The contraceptive prevalence rate in the PCFS in 1991 was 16.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the infant and maternal mortality rates in Myanmar
were 48.6 and 1.7 per 1,000 births respectively.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's population is estimated to have reached 46.4 million
in the 1997-98 fiscal year, maintaining an annual growth rate of
1.84 percent, according to official statistics.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Says Bin Laden Leaves Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's
representative of the Taliban militia told the United States on
Wednesday that Osama bin Laden, accused of bombing U.S. embassies
in Africa, had left Taliban-controlled territory, the State
Department confirmed.
</P>
<P>
Abdul Hakeem Mujahid, Taliban's representative to the United
Nations, said he had told Karl Inderfurth, assistant U.S.
secretary of state for South Asian affairs, that bin Laden had
left last Friday or Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"He is not in the area in control of the Taliban," Mujahid told
reporters after his meeting with Inderfurth at the State
Department. "He decided himself to leave," he added.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Foley confirmed that Mujahid
had said bin Laden had left. But he said he could not confirm
this independently at this time, "but we will continue our efforts
to locate him and see that he is brought to justice," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Mujahid had not told Inderfurth where bin Laden was now,
or the circumstances of his departure, but had said the Taliban
had placed increasing restrictions on the Saudi-born exile in
recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
"We understand that more will be made clear in time regarding
the circumstances of his departure," Foley said, "We have been
told that the Taliban will not support international terrorism in
any form. We hope this will prove true."
</P>
<P>
Bin Laden has been indicted by the United States for
masterminding last August's bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya
and Tanzania, which killed 239 people.
</P>
<P>
A key Afghan opposition group, however, said bin Laden was
still in Afghanistan and reports to the contrary were a ploy to
ease U.S. pressure on the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
Foley said the United States had asked for the meeting with
Mujahid to try to clear up confusion over bin laden's movements.

GENEVA -- The European Union (EU) requested the World Trade
Organization (WTO) here Wednesday to set up a panel to examine the
United States' controversial "Section 301" trade law but which it
has used to press trade sanctions but the EU move was blocked by
the U.S., according to WTO officials.
</P>
<P>
However, the panel will surely be established if the EU insists
its request a second time, because the rules of the WTO's dispute
settlement mechanism state that a panel must be granted at the
second time of asking unless all members are opposed. (EU-US

LONDON February 17 (Xinhua) - Unemployment continues to fall in

WASHINGTON -- The United States remained strongly opposed to
the idea of establishing greater links between the world's major
currencies, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Despite renewed pressure from Europe to more closely link the
dollar with the Japanese yen and Europe's new euro, Rubin said he
believed such proposals would likely at some point put U.S.
domestic economic interests at odds with maintaining some type of
fixed exchange rates. (US-Currency Zones)

<HEADLINE> Central America Eyes Extended Commercial Benefits With U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Jose, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The Central American
countries will appeal to U.S. President Bill Clinton for an
extension of commercial benefits given under the Caribbean Basin
Initiative (CBI), a senior Costa Rican official said here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The presidents of Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua
and Costa Rica will meet Clinton in Guatemala in March when he is
due to visit the region, said Anabel Gonzalez, deputy minister of
foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, which will also take him to Honduras, Clinton
will see the consequences of the damage done last October by
Hurricane Mitch, which destroyed the infrastructure in Nicaragua
and Honduras, the two poorest countries of the region.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rican President Miguel Angel Rodriguez has insisted that
the benefits of the CBI should be extended, comparing them with
those of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) signed by
the U.S., Canada and Mexico, said Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
He and his counterparts in the region held that the extension
of commercial benefits will help attract investment to the region
and contribute to its reconstruction work.
</P>
<P>
The CBI was granted by former U.S. president Ronald Reagan to
Central America in the 1980s in the fight against the Sandanista
regime in Nicaragua, but the benefits granted were limited and
unilateral, and subject to arbitrary abolition by Washington.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Gov't Plans to Send Poor Kids to School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government is
to open a special registration procedure so more children of poor
families can go to school at this time of crisis, a senior
official said.
</P>
<P>
The registration will start late April after the government
completes its inventory of children requiring assistance to remain
in school, Coordinating Minister for People's Welfare and Poverty
Alleviation Haryono Suyono said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The inventory-taking of eligible poor children was underway,
the Jakarta Post daily Thursday quoted the minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest official estimates, around 2.5 million
children in Indonesia have had to drop out of schools and
universities on account of the economic crisis. The figure was
much smaller than the earlier projected 8 million.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government introduced the six-year basic
compulsory education program in 1994, and later changed it to nine
years in order to cover the three years of high school education.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bureau of Statistics said in 1997 that the
illiteracy rate in Indonesia is 10.9 percent of the total
population of 200 million. a total of 13.22 percent of all
children over 5 years of age have not yet been sent to school.
</P>
<P>
The government also hoped the private sector and other elements
in society would help maintain children in school.

BANGKOK, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Thailand last year achieved
its tourist target as 77 million foreign visitors chose the
country as their holiday destination, an increase of 7.53 percent

<HEADLINE> World Bank's IFC to Triple Investment in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The International Finance
Corporation (IFC), the World Bank's private investment arm, is to
triple its investment of 40 million U.S. dollars to 120 million
dollars here this year, the official Daily News said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
IFC's Vice President Jemal-Ud-Din Kassum said that the Sri
Lankan economy was very resilient and its estimated growth rate of
4.5 percent in 1998 was satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
He said Sri Lanka's fundamentals were promising and its
macro-economic management was sound. There was long-term potential
here which should not deter long-term investors.
</P>
<P>
Kassum together with senior regional officials from IFC India
were in Colombo to review existing investments and explore new
investment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
He was of the view that Sri Lanka should ensure the resilience
is further strengthened to overcome immediate and future
challenges.
</P>
<P>
"Sri Lanka must continue the momentum and increase the pace of
liberalization and reforms, further encourage more private sector
participation and investment," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kassum observed that Sri Lankan exports were facing severe
competition in international markets and therefore their
competitiveness should be improved. There should be a reduction in
infrastructure costs and medium- and long-term production levels
must be improved, he added.
</P>
<P>
IFC's current investments in Sri Lanka are in the financial,
hotel and tourism and power and infrastructure sectors. The IFC
was now looking towards investment in healthcare, information
technology and education.

<HEADLINE> Origin of Chinese Heroine Mulan Confirmed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, February 18 (Xinhua)-- The forthcoming Chinese
premiere of Walt Disney's cartoon feature film "Mulan" has
awakened growing interest in the origin of this ancient Chinese
heroine.
</P>
<P>
Experts in central China's Henan Province say Hua Mulan, the
leading character of this traditional Chinese folk tale, was a
native of Henan.
</P>
<P>
Her hometown was Dazhou Village in Yucheng County, where tomb
and memorial temple to Mulan still exist.
</P>
<P>
According to historical records, Mulan joined the army in place
of her old and sick father in the Sui Dynasty, 1,300 years ago.
Nobody guessed she was a female until the war ended because she
disguised herself as a man. She was later hailed as a great
warrior for her brilliant warlike achievements.
</P>
<P>
Her story has been popular among ordinary people in China for
centuries and government officials of the Tang Dynasty (618-907)
built a memorial temple in her hometown. The temple was expanded
in the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) but later burned down in a fire.
</P>
<P>
The existing memorial temple was rebuilt in 1994. It contains
two tablets representing the Yuan and Qing dynasties and the
inscriptions record the life experience and brilliant achievements
of Mulan.
</P>
<P>
However, Hebei, Shandong, Shaanxi and Sichuan provinces also
claim that they are the birthplaces of Mulan but Chinese
historians are convinced that Henan's records are more authentic.
</P>
<P>
The government of Henan is now considering opening a tourist
attraction in Mulan's hometown soon.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China's famous Beijing Opera House, which is
making tour performances in the United States, is mainly
performing a revised version of the classic story of Hua Mulan.

WASHINGTON, February 17 (Xinhua) -- NBA deputy commissioner
Russ Granik said Houston Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich is the top
candidate to coach the U.S. men's basketball team at the 2000

</P>
<P>
Tomjanovich led a team without NBA players to a bronze medal at

Granik, also president of USA Basketball, said:"While I don't

the consideration that the team he was originally supposed to
coach and the team that he actually took to Greece were vastly
different.
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of sentiment that Rudy should be rewarded for
the time and effort he put in with that team."
</P>
<P>
The national team committee met Wednesday in Chicago to discuss
coach and player candidates.
</P>

Utah Juzz coach Jerry Sloan is also a candidate to coach the
Olympic team. Sloan was an assistant on the 1996 team that won the

<HEADLINE> EDS-Updates with more details U.S. Sends More Planes to Europe for Possible Strike on Serbs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen Wednesday ordered the deployment of an additional 51
military aircraft to Europe for possible air strikes on Serb
targets if a peace agreement over Kosovo is not reached this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Department said in a statement that peace talks
were continuing in Rambouillet, France, between the Serbs and
Kosovo's ethnic Albanians and no decision had been made on the use
of force. But the U.S. troops were being deployed to Europe "to
assure that NATO has the capability to conduct operations should
that prove necessary".
</P>
<P>
The additional aircraft include 12 F-117 Nighthawk stealth
fighters, 10 EA-6B Prowlers, four KC-10 refuelers and 25 KC-135
refuelers, the Defense Department said. Additional U.S. aircraft,
including bombers, remain in a standby posture in the United
States in case they are needed to support the operation.
</P>
<P>
All the 51 aircraft will be moved to their European bases in
Italy and other countries within 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
"They'll be moving in the next couple of days to Europe,"
Defense Department spokesman Kenneth Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
This was to move them into place in case the Serbs blocked a
peace deal and NATO decided to launch air strikes as soon as this
weekend, Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
The additional warplanes bring to 260 the number of U.S.
aircraft that would be available for any NATO strikes against
Serbia, he added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the State Department warned Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic that the Serbs faced "swift and
severe" consequences if they persist in rejecting a NATO
peacekeeping force in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
With a demand that Milosevic change his position by noon
Saturday in favor of the deployment of NATO peacekeeping troops,
State Department spokesman James Foley said: "If it would take
some military action to force Mr. Milosevic to his senses, so be
it."
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration took the tough action by sending
more warplanes to Europe after Milosevic was approached by U.S.
mediator Christopher Hill and rejected a NATO peacekeeping force
in Kosovo as part of a settlement to end conflict between Serbs
and ethnic Albanians who are seeking independence from Serbia.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who had sent Hill to
Belgrade, but was unable to sway Milosevic, is weighing a decision
whether to intervene in the negotiations again.
</P>
<P>
Foley said the door remains open for the Yugoslav leader to
yield to the demands of the Contact Group, including the United
States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Russia.
</P>
<P>
"We do not see the issue as closed," he said. "President
Milosevic still has time to see the light."
</P>
<P>
Foley also said some progress in the negotiations had been made
on other issues, and lawyers were working on texts of an accord to
end the yearlong Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
"The Serb side is dealing with the prospect of a peace
agreement," he said.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Gets Loans Under Miyazawa Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines Wednesday
signed agreements for Japanese loans worth 600 million U.S.
dollars under the Miyazawa fund, the Philippine Daily Inquirer
said.
</P>
<P>
A statement from the Finance Department was quoted as saying
the two 300-million-U.S. dollar loans are to co-finance reform
programs in the Philippines' power and banking sectors with the
loans of the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
The agreements were signed by Finance Secretary Edgardo
Espiritu and Hidemi Kawai, senior executive director of the
Export-Import Bank of Japan, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The reforms, aided by the Japanese funds, would have "far
reaching impact" in reinforcing the economy to help it "withstand
financial shocks," Espiritu said.
</P>
<P>
He said the banking sector reform program would help strengthen
the regulatory functions of the financial system as well as
promote transparency.
</P>
<P>
The power sector reforms were aimed at developing a more
private sector-driven environment, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government established a 30-billion-U.S. dollar
fund, called the Miyazawa fund, to assist the recovery of Asian
economies mired in the region's financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines submitted a list of projects totaling 6 billion
U.S. dollars that it hoped would be financed by the fund.

<HEADLINE> 2.3 Tons of Cocaine Seized in Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, February 17 (Xinhua)-- More than 2.3 tons of
cocaine were seized by Colombia's anti-drug police in two
operations in the provinces of Narino and Cauca Valley, said
police sources on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The operations were carried out in the outskirts of Pasto and
Anserma Nuevo. Police also destroyed three laboratories which had
the capacity to produce three tons of cocaine per week.
</P>
<P>
Near the laboratories, the police found 21 warehouses and food
which were sufficient to feed 100 men for up to three months.
</P>
<P>
They also discovered microwave ovens, electrical equipment,
motorized water pumps and other equipment used in the processing
of the drug.
</P>
<P>
The Colombian government has stepped up its efforts in fighting
drugs. In 1998, the anti-narcotic police arrested more than 10,
000 drug trafficking suspects, destroyed 180 laboratories and
seized nearly 100 tons of drugs.

<HEADLINE> Kunming Preparing for World Horticulture Exposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Kunming, the capital city of
southwest China's Yunnan Province, has spent a total of 6.3
billion yuan (759 million U.S. dollars) on improving
infrastructure facilities over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
This was part of the local government's effort preparing for
the upcoming '99 Kunming World Horticulture Exposition due to be
held here from May 1 to October 31. The exposition is expected to
attract 88 countries and international organizations and 10
million visitors from home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Some two billion yuan has been invested for building and
expanding 70 roads and 19 flyovers. Construction of main city road
network has been completed 10 years ahead of schedule, thereby
easing the traffic jam in the city.
</P>
<P>
As one of the country's main airports, the Kunming Airport has
opened more than 70 domestic air lines and eight international air
lines. Its handling capacity is expected to reach 10 million
passengers a year with the completion of a one-billion-yuan
renovation project.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the local government got 150 million U.S. dollars
in loans from the World Bank and raised another one billion yuan
locally for setting up four waste water treatment factories and
other facilities in order to improve water quality of the Dianchi
Lake in the southern part of the city.
</P>
<P>
Starting from last August, the city banned the use of coal and
made strict restrictions on the discharge of waste gas from
vehicles. The city's air quality improved remarkably.
</P>
<P>
The city has also invested 600 million yuan in building public
lawns and on afforestation on 31 major roads to raise its green
coverage rate to 29 percent.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Rejects Idea on Currency Zones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The United States remained
strongly opposed to the idea of establishing greater links between
the world's major currencies, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Despite renewed pressure from Europe to more closely link the
dollar with the Japanese yen and Europe's new euro, Rubin said he
believed such proposals would likely at some point put U.S.
domestic economic interests at odds with maintaining some type of
fixed exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
Officials in France, Germany and Japan have endorsed searching
for ways to more closely link the currencies of the United States,
Japan and Europe as a way to reduce the extreme volatility in
exchange markets witnessed in recent years.
</P>
<P>
But Rubin said such an idea would ultimately be doomed to
create even more speculative turbulence.
</P>
<P>
"Bands become wonderful speculative targets for those who are
worried about speculation," he said at news briefing.
</P>
<P>
Rubin made the comments as he and his counterparts of other
members of the Group of Seven -- which also includes Japan,
Germany France, Italy, Britain and Canada -- are preparing to meet
on Saturday in Bonn to review progress in overhauling the global
financial architecture.
</P>
<P>
The G-7 leaders committed themselves to this effort last May at
their annual summit in Birmingham, England, but so far have made
only modest progress in working out details of just how to
accomplish the goal.
</P>
<P>
The currency crisis, which began in Thailand in July 1997, has
pushed one-third of the globe into recession and left economic
policy-makers scrambling to come up with ways to tame turbulent
financial markets.
</P>
<P>
As he has in the past, Rubin stressed the urgent need for Japan
to push forward with efforts to lift its own economy out of
recession as a key to restoring growth to its troubled Asian
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Rubin also warned that the soaring U.S. trade deficit, which is
at a record level, is not sustainable and therefore other
developed nations including those in Europe must do their part to
take exports from crisis nations.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. position makes it unlikely that the other G-7 members
will get very far with any proposals to link currencies more
closely at the incoming G-7 financial meeting which also will be
attended by central bank presidents of the seven largest
industrial countries.
</P>
<P>
But Rubin said the G-7 countries were ready to endorse a
proposal to promote better and more timely release of the foreign
currency reserves held by countries. Failure to adequately reveal
reserve positions has been cited as a key triggering event of the
currency turmoil in both Thailand and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the group would also likely favorably review a
proposal by a study group to create a forum for financial
regulators to coordinate regulation of financial markets. This
idea is being put forward by officials from G-7 and developing
countries who have been working under the direction of Hans
Tietmyer, head of the German central bank.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Government Takes Steps to Increase Emergency Oil Reserve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Energy Department
announced Wednesday it will allow companies to store as much as 70
million barrels of oil in its underground reserve for a year or
more.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time in a week that the government took
steps to increase the amount of oil in its emergency reserve,
hoping also to help the ailing petroleum industry reduce supplies
on the market.
</P>
<P>
With prices severely depressed, the opportunity to remove even
modest amounts of oil from the market for a year might be
attractive to some companies that are betting prices might rebound
in the future, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
They also said the amount involved is not enough to
significantly affect prices, especially at a time when inventories
are high. Worldwide oil prices are at a 12-year low.
</P>
<P>
Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said opening the Strategic
Petroleum Reserve on the Texas-Louisiana coast for private storage
is a unique opportunity "to add to our energy security" at a time
when private storage space is hard to find and prices are
depressed.
</P>
<P>
The American Petroleum Institute reported that crude oil stocks
at the end of January were at 330.2 million barrels, up almost 3
percent from the previous month. About 19 million barrels of oil
are consumed daily in the United States, according to the API.
</P>
<P>
The oil stored temporarily in the reserve would remain the
property of the commercial owner, but some of it would be turned
over to the government in lieu of a fee and become part of the
reserve's permanent inventory, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The Strategic Petroleum Reserve currently has 561 million
barrels of government-owned oil that can be used in case of an
emergency. The reserve has a capacity of 680 million barrels.
</P>
<P>
The Department set a March 10 deadlines for offers and said it
could receive oil at a rate of 150,000 to 200,000 barrels a day at
its Big Hill storage site south of Beaumont, Texas. The oil must
be stored in six empty caverns at Big Hill for at least a year,
the officials added.
</P>
<P>
The government has been criticized by some members of Congress
from oil states for not doing more to help the depressed domestic
oil industry. Last month alone, 11,500 oil industry workers lost
their jobs, according to industry figures.
</P>
<P>
The government doesn't predict any substantial price rebound
anytime soon. Prices could be depressed well into the next decade
and not likely exceed 14 U.S. dollars a barrel until after 2000,
the Energy Information Administration predicted recently.
</P>
<P>
In a related action, the Energy Department announced it would
spend 19 million to help small producers pay for new technology
needed to produce oil from fields where recovery has been
difficult. The federal money, provided on a matching basis, was
hoped to prompt increased private spending on use of such
technology.

<HEADLINE> China Sets Zero Growth for Ocean Fishing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Agriculture
has set a zero growth rate this year for the country's ocean
fishing industry in a bid to stop excessive fishing in coastal
waters and to ensure sustainable growth in the area.
</P>
<P>
This decision, made following cautious consideration and in-
depth studies, is also part of the effort to better protect the
dwindling ocean fishery resources so as to ensure a sustainable
development of the fishing industry, today's Guangming Daily
reported.
</P>
<P>
Ocean fishing has been growing sharply in recent years, pushing
China's fishery output to the world's top place since 1989.
</P>
<P>
While swelling the pocket of the fishermen and enabling an
ample market supply, the increasingly rapid growth has also
accelerated the depletion of fish resources in the country's
Yellow, Bohai, East and South China sea areas, the Daily said.
</P>
<P>
Under a scheme to curb the production, fishing in the coastal
and inland waters will be under strict control.
</P>
<P>
In principle, no new vessels for domestic fishing will be
allowed to be added. The upgrading of old fishing vehicles will
also be under control.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will also extend the fishing-ban period in the
Yellow Sea north of the 35 degrees north latitude by half a month.
Fishing ban will also be introduced to the South China Sea as soon
as possible.

CARACAS, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan President Hugo
Chavez on Wednesday urged the congress to grant him fast-track
powers to deal with the country's economic troubles.

attract foreign investment and crack down on rampant government
corruption.
</P>
<P>
Chavez, who took the helm on February 2, is struggling with a
weak economy, which was worsened by the 12-year low in world oil
prices. The country is the world's second largest exporter of
crude oil.

SANTIAGO, February 17 (Xinhua)-- Chile's fruit exports hit a
record-high of 1.5 million tons in 1998, an increase of 14.1
percent over 1997.
</P>
<P>
According to the Federation of Fruit Producers in Chile, the
income generated from fruit exports reached 1.36 billion U.S.
dollars in 1998, up 5.6 percent compared with 1997.
</P>
<P>
Export volume went up 137 percent for avocados, 24 percent for
apples and 8.9 percent for kiwis, but that of almonds plunged by
half and nectarines by 22.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Chile's total exports fell 12 percent in the year, principally
due to the price fall in the world market of its primary export
products, including copper and fish flour, and the shrinking
demand in major markets.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sends More Planes to Europe for Possible Strike on Serbs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen Wednesday ordered the deployment of an additional 51
fighter aircraft to Europe for possible air strikes on Serb
targets if a peace agreement over Kosovo is not reached this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Department said in a statement that peace talks
were continuing in Rambouillet, France, between the Serbs and
Kosovo's ethnic Albanians and no decision had been made on the use
of force. But the U.S. troops were being deployed to Europe "to
assure that NATO has the capability to conduct operations should
that prove necessary".
</P>
<P>
The additional aircraft include 12 F-117 Nighthawk stealth
fighters, 10 EA-6B Prowlers, four KC-10 refuelers and 25 KC-135
refuelers, the Defense Department said. Additional U.S. aircraft,
including bombers, remain in a standby posture in the United
States in case they are needed to support the operation.
</P>
<P>
All the 51 aircraft will be moved to their European bases in
Italy and other countries within 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
"They'll be moving in the next couple of days to Europe,"
Defense Department spokesman Kenneth Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
This was to move them into place in case the Serbs blocked a
peace deal and NATO decided to launch air strikes as soon as this
weekend, Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
If negotiators for the Belgrade government and the ethnic
Albanians in the Serbian province of Kosovo fail to sign a pact by
Saturday, Yugoslavia could face NATO military strikes.

<HEADLINE> 15 Bulgarian Medical Workers Held in Libya Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sofia, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Fifteen of the 19 Bulgarian
medical workers detained in Libya have been released, the
Bulgarian Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, the consular department of the Libyan Foreign
Ministry formally handed over a list of the released to the
Bulgarian Embassy in Libya.
</P>
<P>
Four Bulgarian citizens are still detained.
</P>
<P>
The 19 Bulgarian doctors and nurses were held in Libya since
last week and subjected to AIDS tests after cases of the disease
were registered in the hospital where they work, a Bulgarian
newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
At a Bulgarian cabinet meeting on Thursday, Foreign Minister
Nadezhda Mihailova will propose the dismissal of Krustyu Ilov as
Sofia's Ambassador in Tripoli for failing to protect adequately
the interests of Bulgarian nationals in Libya, the Foreign
Ministry said. According to the rules of procedure involved, the
president will have to issue a decree on the ambassador's
dismissal.
</P>
<P>
Mihailova has assigned a working group of Bulgarian diplomats
who are leaving for Libya to clarify the situation and cope with
still unresolved problems, said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Wednesday, Foreign Ministry spokesman Radko Vlaikov
told journalists that the ministry had no official information on
the whereabouts of the Bulgarian health service employees in Libya.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Bulgarian Embassy in Tripoli had several
meetings with the Libyan Foreign Ministry, but was not given the
requested official information either. However, the Libyan
authorities assured the diplomats that the arrested Bulgarians
were in good health and were treated well.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria and Libya have signed an agreement on legal assistance,
but even without such a document, when a country requests
information about any of its citizens detained in the territory of
another country, the latter should immediately honor the request
in line with international practice, said Vlaiko.
</P>
<P>
Media reports said that Bulgarian medical personnel were in
trouble with Libyan authorities for divulging information on cases
of AIDS, a disease which officially does not exist in Libya.

<HEADLINE> ADB Pledges 1.52 Billion Dollar Loan to Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank
(ADB) plans to provide Indonesia with 1.52 billion U.S. dollar
loans this year to help the country come out of its economic
crisis, ADB President Tadao Chino said.
</P>
<P>
"Indonesia is now entering a very crucial period of managing
the crisis and getting on with the economic recovery process,"
local leading newspapers Thursday quoted Chino as saying here
Wednesday after meeting President B.J. Habibie.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the loans would be split among five different
areas including 400 million U.S. dollars for power sector
restructuring, 300 million U.S. dollars for health and nutrition
sector development and 320 million U.S. dollars for community and
local government support sector development.
</P>
<P>
The other 300 million U.S. dollars for industrial and trade
deregulation and small- and medium-sized enterprise development,
and the remaining 200 million U.S. dollars for corporate
governance reforms for state enterprises.

The ADB last year approved two loan packages including 1.5
billion U.S. dollars for financial sector reforms and a 300
million U.S. dollars loan for the development of social welfare.
The bank has so far released 1 billion U.S. dollars of its
commitment.
</P>
<P>
Chino, who arrived in Jakarta on Tuesday for a two-day visit,

<HEADLINE> Albania Strengthens Guard on Embassies After Ocalan's Arrest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Albania Wednesday strengthened
security control around foreign embassies and consulates,
especially those of Turkey and Greece, after Kurdish Workers Party
leader Abdullah Ocalan was arrested by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Albanian special troops were mobilized for the guard action.
The number of Albanian police guards at the embassies of Turkey
and Greece was doubled. The police also increased street patrols.
</P>
<P>
The arrest of Ocalan on Tuesday has triggered massive violence
against Greek diplomatic missions in some European countries.
</P>
<P>
Many Kurdish supporters of Ocalan broke into the Greek
embassies and consulates, holding hostages in some cases, but
later releasing them. The protesters alleged that Greece was
responsible for the arrest of Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan, Turkey's most wanted fugitive, was arrested in Kenya
and then brought back to Turkey after leaving the Greek Embassy in
Nairobi.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Rubber to Be Traded as Futures Commodity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian rubber will be
traded in futures trading if the country decided to quit from the
International Natural Rubber Organization (INRO), a senior
official said.
</P>
<P>
"Indonesia cannot remain alone in setting the INRO rubber price
after the withdrawal of Thailand and Malaysia," Minister of
Industry and Trade Rahardi Ramelan said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"If Thailand really quits INRO, Indonesia will have no choice
but to follow suit," local press Thursday quoted the minister as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Ramelan said he would ask for formal confirmation of Thailand's
withdrawal from the group before making a final decision.
</P>
<P>
Thailand, the world's largest rubber producer, decided last
week to quit INRO, while Malaysia notified the group last year it
was leaving INRO. Malaysia's departure becomes official this
October.
</P>
<P>
Producing countries have accused INRO of not doing enough to
prop up sagging prices. INRO's main aim is to stabilize world
rubber prices by buying when prices drop sharply and selling when
they surge.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian traders said INRO last intervened in the market in
September and November, when it bought 8,000 tons of rubber. No
fresh intervention has been seen since.
</P>
<P>
Traders said Indonesia, which is grappling with its worst
economic crisis in decades, has yet to pay last year's 60 million
U.S. dollar fee. Indonesia's natural rubber output is expected to
be 1.55 million tons in 1998 against 1.5 million tons in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Increasing Economic Development In Pudong New Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PUDONG, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai will continue its
economic development policies in the Pudong New Area, Vice-mayor
Zhou Yupeng told a Spring Festival gathering of senior executives
of foreign-funded enterprises recently.
</P>
<P>
Zhou is in charge of economic development in the Pudong New
Area and told the gathering that the municipal government will
increase efforts there because it represents the economic
development of Shanghai and China as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government will put another 100 billion yuan (12
billion U.S. dollars) into infrastructure this year, in airports,
the subway, and pedestrians underpasses. Many large multinationals,
organizations, and groups will also set up branches in the area.
</P>
<P>
The area has had 5,472 projects, valued at more than 27.5
billion U.S. dollars, since it was established in June 1990. More
than 140 projects involving 88 multinationals are worth 11 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Foreign funds have contributed to the development of Shanghai's
pillar industries like telecommunications, biological engineering,
automobiles, and computers.
</P>
<P>
There were 554 foreign-funded projects last year, worth 2.9
billion U.S. dollars, nearly 50 percent more than in 1997, and
fixed assets investment was worth 58 billion yuan. Pudong's GDP
last year was 70.9 billion yuan, up 16.8 percent.

<HEADLINE> Mexican President Announces Plan Against Forest Fires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The Mexican government
will allocate more than 30 million U.S. dollars to the prevention
and fighting of forest fires in 1999 and begin reforestation,
President Ernesto Zedillo said on Wednesday in the state of Oaxaca.
</P>
<P>
During his tour of Oaxaca, 480 kilometers south of Mexico City,
President Zedillo said that his government would channel more than
300 million dollars to any natural disaster which may occur this
year.
</P>
<P>
He said that a fund of 30 million dollars would be assigned to
combat forest fires, which in 1998 destroyed 849,632 hectares of
forests and jungle in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
The government plan covers the reforestation of 160,000
hectares of forests and jungle, the collection of 30 tons of seeds
and the production of 300 million plants for use in the next cycle
of reforestation.

UNITED NATIONS -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has said he
planned to send a letter to Libya Wednesday with clarifications
about arrangements for the trial of two suspects in the 1988
bombing of a Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
"I am going to be sending them a letter but obviously I cannot
discuss with you what is in the letter," he said.
</P>
<P>
Answering a press question whether he had discussed the
contents with the United States and Britain, as well as Libya, he
said, "I hope the letter will be acceptable to all of them." "We
have offered clarifications and answered some of their (the
Libyans') questions and I hope that the understandings contained
in the letter will be sufficient for us to move forward," he added.

opening to take a "more convincing" approach to Turkey in
mediating the island's future, the foreign minister of Cyprus said
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Yiannakis Cassoulides told reporters after meeting with U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright that he did not expect a
reciprocal gesture from Turkey for the decision on the S-300
missiles.
</P>
<P>
But he said it "creates opportunities for the United States to
be more convincing toward the Turks" on a Cypriot proposal to
reunite the divided island. (US-Cyprus)

<HEADLINE> Blair Holds Talks with Trimble on N.Irish Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The Northern Ireland's Ulster
Unionist leader David Trimble met British Prime Minister Tony
Blair in Downing Street on Wednesday to assess how best to get
round the stumbling block of paramilitary disarmament in the
province.
</P>
<P>
Downing Street said the prime minister also spoke for 15
minutes on the telephone to Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern to
"compare notes on where we are in the process."
</P>
<P>
Speaking later after his meeting with Blair, Trimble said in
Downing Street that "There is only one issue left to be resolved."
</P>
<P>
Referring to decommissioning, Trimble told reporters: "The
Prime Minister shares our view that it should happen as soon as
possible to permit the new institutions to proceed as smoothly as
possible, which is what we would like to see."
</P>
<P>
An unprecedented meeting between the Ulster Unionist Party and
Sinn Fein earlier in the day ended with no sign of progress on the
issue of arms disposal.
</P>
<P>
The Ulster Unionists say they will not take part in a new
Northern Ireland executive or cabinet with Sinn Fein before the
IRA starts to decommission its weapons and explosives stockpiles.
</P>
<P>
But Sinn Fein have repeatedly said they cannot simply tell the
IRA to give up its arms at this stage and maintain decommissioning
is not a pre-condition of the Good Friday Agreement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam, speaking after
separate talks at Downing Street, praised the progress made in the
province, while admitting decommissioning remained the "hardest
issue".
</P>
<P>
She said what was important "is to congratulate the assembly on
the progress they have made in the last couple of days."
</P>
<P>
"I think it is another step forward. It is them making the
decisions, which is important," she added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Impose Sanction on Canada, UK Firms on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The United States will
impose sanctions on two Canadian and British firms for their
taking part in a 200 million U.S. dollar Iranian oil project under
a U.S. law that seeks to deter large foreign investments in Iran's
energy sector, the State Department said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Iran cleared the way for Canada's Bow Valley Energy
Ltd. and Britain's Premier Oil Plc. to begin building offshore
platforms and drilling wells in the Balal oil field.
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. law would not allow any foreign companies to
invest more than 200 million dollars annually in the oil and
natural gas sectors of either Iran or Libya.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Foley said the U.S. law "will
certainly" be applied to Bow Valley and Premier Oil.
</P>
<P>
A senior executive with Bow Valley, said his company had the
full support of the Canadian government in its efforts to produce
oil in Iran.
</P>
<P>
"From our perspective, we are a Canadian company complying with
Canadian laws doing business legally in Iran with Premier as
partner," Bow Valley Chief Financial Officer Dinesh Dattani said.
"It doesn't sound reasonable to us to deal with a U.S. situation."
</P>
<P>
The law also allows President Bill Clinton to waive imposing
sanctions against foreign companies investing in Iran if it is in
the best interests of the United States to do so.
</P>
<P>
The administration issued such a waiver last May for France's
Total SA, Russia's Gazprom and Malaysia's Petronas after the
companies entered into a $2 billion deal to develop Iran's South
Pars natural gas field.
</P>
<P>
Clitnon's earlier move to waive sanctions against the
European oil companies could bode well for Bow Valley because of
its partnership with Britain's Premier, he said.

<HEADLINE> Angola Turns Down U.N. Political, Military Presence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Angolan President
Eduardo dos Santos has turned down a U.N. political or military
presence in his war-torn country, as the U.N. Security Council has
requested, but he wants U.N. relief workers to stay, according to
his letter circulated here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In his letter transmitted to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
on Friday, the Angolan president said that his government also
agreed to accept human rights monitors based in Angola where the
fighting has been intensified.
</P>
<P>
However, dos Santos rejected any future presence for the U.N.
Observer Mission in Angola, known as MONUA, "no matter what the
form" saying that rebel leader Jonas Savimbi had ignored all peace
agreements to date.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council, in its January 21 resolution, called for
a "continued multidisciplinary presence" of the United Nations in
Angola to keep peace and render humanitarian assistance.
</P>
<P>
Annan has already proposed the withdrawal of the 1,000-member
MONUA, from the war-raged southwest African country following the
mandate of the U.N. peacekeeping mission expires on February 26.
</P>
<P>
The president said the U.N. special representative should be
based in the U.N. headquarters in New York and be able to "work
with the Angolan Government in the follow-up of developments,"
the letter said.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the operation, including U.N. Special Envoy Issa
Diallo, should be out of the African country by March 20, the
president said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council has voiced its hope to a reduced MONUA
could continue to operate in Angola, even if under another name.
</P>
<P>
The latest round of fighting, which broke out in early
December last year, escalated after the warring parties resorted
to force to solve their problems, plunging the U.N. peacekeeping
operations virtually into a standstill in the country.
</P>
<P>
The breakdown of the 1994 peace accord, mediated by the world
body, is blamed mainly on rebel UNITA, headed by Sanvimbi, which
refused to hand over land under its control to a national unity
government and did not disarm its fighters as called for in the
peace accord, known as the Lusaka Protocol.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Calls for Ceasefire in Congo (K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council on Wednesday called on all parties in Congo (K) to stop
fighting and resolve their differences "through democratic means."
</P>
<P>
In a statement read to the press, the president of the
15-member Council, Robert Fowler of Canada, said, "Council members
called on all parties, especially the rebel movement, to cease
hostilities, put a ceasefire in place, and to work through
democratic means to resolving their differences."
</P>
<P>
The statement was issued after the council was briefed on the
situation in the central African country where a rebellion that
broke out in August last year against President Laurent Kabila,
who came to power in what was previously known as Zaire in 1997
after his victory in the long-standing struggle against late
dictator Mobutu Sese Seko.
</P>
<P>
Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia have sent troops and equipment to
support President Kabila against a Tutsi-led rebellion.
</P>
<P>
"The members of the Council were particularly concerned about
the continuing flow of illegal arms and military training to the
territory of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and called for
the cessation of these activities," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Council members were deeply concerned about the continuing
impact of the hostilities on civilian populations and on the
delivery of humanitarian assistance to those so affected," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The members of the Council consider that it is vital to ensure
that there be a broad base, multi-ethnic involvement in the peace
efforts," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Council members welcomed peace efforts by Zambian President
Frederick Chaluba and said that they were pleased with U.N.
special human rights investigator Roberto Garreton who had returned to
the country. "They stressed the need for a thorough investigation
of reported massacres and said the perpetrators of such acts
should not escape with impunity," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Garreton, a Chilean, was once declared "persona non grata" by
Kabila for denouncing the slaughter of thousands of Rwandan Hutus
who fled to Congo (K) when Tutsi exiles took power in Rwanda after
1994 massacres there by Hutus.

<HEADLINE> Exhibition on Slave Ship Opens in Ghana's Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 17 (Xinhua) -- An exhibition of discoveries
from a slave ship, Fredensborg, opened in Accra Wednesday with a
call on the developed nations which thrived on slave labor to
provide "the appropriate reward for Africa," according to a Ghana
News Agency report.
</P>
<P>
''Africa, in the face of these contributions, does not deserve
the colossal debt she is carrying on her shoulders; she has
offered more than her fair share toward the material and spiritual
upliftment of the world and deserves to be reciprocated in a
genuine and humane manner,'' the report quoted Ghanaian Minister
of Tourism Mike Gizo as saying.
</P>
<P>
The ship, named after Fort Fredensborg (now in ruins), was
built in 1737 by the Danish West India-Guinea company in
Copenhagen, Denmark.
</P>
<P>
It ran aground while it was on a return journey with a cargo
of slaves and some other goods from the Gulf of Guinea to Saint
Croix Island in the West Indies and Copenhagen to complete one of
her journeys of the triangular slave trade.
</P>
<P>
It sunk a few nautical miles from Norway on December 1, 1768.
</P>
<P>
Gizo said the event has now established the truth about a
systematic program of activities which took place over 300 years
and witnessed the forced departure of approximately 40 million
Africans from their homeland as enslaved people to work in
plantations, industries and construction in the New World.
</P>
<P>
''It also brings into sharp focus the exceptional contribution
Africa in general and Ghana in particular have made to world
civilization,'' said the minister.
</P>
<P>
''This is a living testimony of heinous crime against humanity,
coupled with the revelation of policies and legalities as captured
in various historical accounts to make it look a genuine trade
transaction,'' he added.

<HEADLINE> Yeast Cells Glow Green to Detect Carcinogens in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 17 (Xinhua) -- British scientists have
developed a new type of sensor using genetically modified yeast
cells which could detect potential carcinogens in water and drugs.
</P>
<P>
With the help of a gene from a jellyfish, researchers at the
University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology, UK,
created yeast cells that fluoresce bright green when exposed to
substances that damage DNA.
</P>
<P>
"The more damage, the brighter the glow", Richard Walmsley,
head of the team that developed the device, was quoted Wednesday
by New Scientist magazine as saying.
</P>
<P>
Walmsley said the new sensor, which gives a result in as little
as four hours, was quicker and more accurate than the standard
test for carcinogenic substances.
</P>
<P>
The researchers engineered the yeast so the gene for a green
fluorescent protein from the jellyfish is switched on at the same
time as RAD54, a gene that detects yeast DNA damage. Yeast cells
are very similar to mammalian cells.
</P>
<P>
In this way, the brightness of the green light reflects the
amount of repair under way in the yeast cells. The brightness, as
measured by a fluorescence detector, rises rapidly above
background levels when the yeast cells are exposed to a mutagen.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T-TCI Merger Wins Approval of Regulators, Shareholders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Federal regulators and
shareholders of both AT&AMP;T Corp. and cable giant TCI approved on
Wednesday the merger deal of the two companies that could give
consumers one-stop shopping -- from local calling to high-speed
Internet access -- over cable TV lines.
</P>
<P>
Federal Communications Commission officials, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said the agency voted to clear the deal,
which was valued at nearly $32 billion when it was announced in
June. But the action isn't considered official and final until the
commission publicly releases information on the order.
</P>
<P>
Shareholders of AT&AMP;T overwhelmingly approved the deal at a
meeting this morning in New Jersey. And a majority of TCI's
shareholders, meeting in Colorado, approved the deal later in the
day. The merger plan must also be approved by local cable
franchising authorities.
</P>
<P>
AT&AMP;T is the nation's largest telecommunications company and
biggest provider of mobile phone services. TCI is the nation's
second-largest cable TV company, with lines reaching one-third of
all U.S. homes.
</P>
<P>
Many of those TCI lines have been upgraded to permit cable TV
customers to connect their computers to the Internet and access
online data at speeds as much as 100 times faster than
conventional telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
Eventually, AT&AMP;T intends to make TCI's lines capable of
providing customers with local phone service, too. AT&AMP;T has a
separate agreement with cable company Time Warner to provide local
phone service over its high-speed cable TV lines. More cable
agreements are expected.
</P>
<P>
The cable agreements would give AT&AMP;T a way to get into homes
without having to rely on phone lines controlled by the regional
Bell companies, which dominate the local phone market.
</P>
<P>
Through the merger, AT&AMP;T also will control TCI's stake in
AtHome Corp., a leading provider of high-speed Internet access.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department approved the merger in December on the
condition that TCI sell its interest in a rival mobile phone
company, Sprint PCS.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Judge Gives Pilots Union More Time to Defend Itself </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 17 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. federal judge
Wednesday gave American Airlines' pilots union more time to defend
itself against contempt charges that stemmed from failing to halt
a sickout that at one point grounded more than half the flights of
the nation's second-largest airline.
</P>
<P>
The Allied Pilots Association had asked U.S. District Judge Joe
Kendall to hear its side of the case before imposing damages. The
union said it needed more time to rebut the carrier's claims of
financial harm suffered as a result of the job action.
</P>
<P>
The airline's lawyer, Dee Kelly, urged the judge to proceed,
saying, "I frankly think they've had notice. The airline has
suffered huge losses and we would like to show the court how
much."
</P>
<P>
The union placed 10 million U.S. dollars, or one-quarter of its
assets, with the court on Tuesday in preparation for the fine
Kendall promised last Saturday, when he ruled that the union did
not do enough to prevent the sickout once he ordered pilots back
to work.
</P>
<P>
The pilots' work action took place over 10 days and resulted in
delays and cancellations for more than 600,000 passengers when
about 6,000 flights were left at the gate. Flights, however,
appear to be back to normal.
</P>
<P>
Doug Herring, vice president and controller for American, told
the judge the carrier has lost an estimated 58.7 million dollars
in revenue from last Wednesday to the end of last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
For the entire 10 days of the work action, losses "will easily
exceed 150 million dollars," Herring said.

<HEADLINE> UK Unemployment Falls to 18-Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON February 17 (Xinhua) - Unemployment continues to fall in
Britain with the employment market now at its strongest in almost
nine years.
</P>
<P>
The latest figures released by the Office for National
Statistics (ONS) showed the total number of Britons in work rose
to an all-time high of 27.3 million.
</P>
<P>
However, the fall was not enough to move the unemployment rate
which remains at 4.6 percent of the workforce.
</P>
<P>
Last month, 1,305,000 people received unemployment benefits,
according to the ONS measure of claimant numbers.
</P>
<P>
The ONS said the rate of employment, at 78.3 percent, was at
its highest since the Spring of 1990 and the unemployment numbers
were at 18-year lows.
</P>
<P>
It is commonly believed here that the condition of the UK labor
market, together with the news that inflation has remained at 2.6
percent, will have a considerable bearing on the Bank of England's
next move on interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Many businesses and unions are pushing for further cuts in the
rate which they say will help Britain's faltering economy.
</P>
<P>
However, analyst Philip Shaw of Investec said: "It's surprising
to see the official data continuing to show unemployment falling."
</P>
<P>
"Nonetheless, the Bank of England has made it clear these
figures don't pose a threat to further reductions in interest
rates," he added.

<HEADLINE> European Stock Markets Slip on Oil Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON February 17 (Xinhua) - Falling oil prices and a weak
start on Wall Street weighed on European markets Wednesday as
London's blue-chip index reversed a five-day winning streak to
close nearly half a percentage point lower.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE 100 ended 30.2 points at 6078.4 after trading in a
range between 6111.9 and 6040.7 during the day.
</P>
<P>
The slump comes amid a global oil glut and underlined OPEC's
failure to stick to supply-constraining production quotas.
</P>
<P>
Adding to the bad news, oil giant BP Amoca said it would cut
3,000 more jobs this year as it strives to achieve 2 billion US
dollars in savings from the companies' 55 billion US dollars
merger a year ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
However, one trader in the City said: "It has been a pretty
impressive performance in London particularly when you look at the
losses recorded elsewhere in Europe."
</P>
<P>
German shares were down with many investors sidelined due to a
lack of corporate news and carnival festivities in most of western
Germany.
</P>
<P>
The leading Xetra Dax index finished down 75 points at 4820 on
the day.
</P>
<P>
Prench stock prices fell back in line with other European stock
markets, as investors turned cautious on their exposure to the
market, traders said.
</P>
<P>
The leading Cac 40 index closed 67 points lower at 3985 on
Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Cypriot Foreign Ministers Meet on Missile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government's
decision not to deploy air defense missiles would give the
Clinton administration an opening to take a "more convincing"
approach to Turkey in mediating the island's future, the foreign
minister of Cyprus said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Yiannakis Cassoulides told reporters after meeting with U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright that he did not expect a
reciprocal gesture from Turkey for the decision on the S-300
missiles.
</P>
<P>
But he said it "creates opportunities for the United States
to be more convincing toward the Turks" on a Cypriot proposal to
reunite the divided island.
</P>
<P>
Albright praised as courageous Cypriot Prime Minister Glafcos
Clerides's decision not to deploy the Russian missile system and
urged all sides to work with the U.N. representative in Cyprus,
Ann Hercus.
</P>
<P>
Cassoulides said their meeting was "extremely useful," and
Albright had reaffirmed a U.S. commitment to seek a solution for
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus was divided in 1974 after Turkish troops invaded the
island and took control of about 35 percent of the island's
northern part, then helped set up a separate Turkish Cypriot
state there. But no other countries have recognized the division.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Clinton administration sent Richard Holbrooke,
a senior diplomat, to the island to pursue a Cyprus accord so
that the division could be settled, but there was no breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
Cassoulides said he hoped Holbrooke would remain involved
even after the Senate approves his nomination to be U.S.
ambassador to the United Nations.

<HEADLINE> Ireland Persists to Fight EU Duty-Free Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 17 (Xinhua) - The Irish government said on
Wednesday that it would persist in its fight to retain duty-free
shopping despite an EU report which found no reason to extend the
June 30 deadline on tax-free sales.
</P>
<P>
"This particular battle may appear to be lost but the fight
goes on," Reuters quoted Irish Minister for Public Enterprise Mary
O'Rourke as saying in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Ireland has joined calls by France, Britain and Germany to
reconsider the decision, arguing that abolition of tax-free
shopping could have a severe impact on employment.
</P>
<P>
But the European Union said in a report on Wednesday that it
saw no justification for extending duty-free sales in the EU
because it would not help overall employment and would be unfair
to normal retailers.
</P>
<P>
O'Rourke said the document was "inadequate" in that it failed
to adequately address the employment issue.
</P>
<P>
"One of the conditions on which duty-free's abolition rested in
1991 was the carrying out of a jobs impact. This document could
not be classified as an impact study. It is a somewhat vague
report and is far from conclusive," she said.
</P>
<P>
EU governments would have to vote unanimously to overturn the
duty-free plan. EU finance ministers are due to discuss the
Commission's report on March 15.

<HEADLINE> IFC, EBRD Finance Oil Development in Caspian SEA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The International Finance
Corporation (IFC) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (EBRD) will each invest up to 200 million U.S. dollars
in the Early Oil Project to develop the offshore Chirag Field in
the Caspian Sea, the IFC announced on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Early Oil Project, undertaken by affiliates of 11
international oil companies and the State Oil Company of the
Azerbaijan Republic, is the first stage of the development of the
Chirag, Azeri and Deepwater Gunashli field complex.
</P>
<P>
It includes the refurbishment of an existing offshore platform,
drilling wells and building subsea pipelines as well as installing
terminals in Azerbaijan and Georgia and repairing and completing
two oil pipelines, through Azerbaijan to the Russian border and to
Supsa, Georgia. Production commenced in November 1997 and is
currently over 80,000 barrels of oil per day.
</P>
<P>
The total development cost of the Chirag Field is estimated to
amount to 10-12 billion dollars and the ultimate recovery of crude
oil over 4 billion barrels. Production is forecast to reach more
than 800,000 barrels per day in the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The EBRD and IFC will each provide financing of up to 200
million dollars of which up to 100 million dollars will be
syndicated. The facility will be provided by way of five separate
loans by each of the EBRD and IFC to affiliates of BP Amoco plc,
Exxon Corporation, Lukoil Joint Stock Company, Turkiye Petrolleri
A.O, and Union Oil Company of California.
</P>
<P>
Citibank, Dresdner Bank and Societe Generale acted as
Co-Arrangers and each contributed 25 million dollars to the
syndicated loans.
</P>
<P>
IFC, a member of the World Bank, provides specially financing
to private sector of developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The EBRD was established in 1991 to aid the transition from
centrally planned to market economies in central and eastern
Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States.

<HEADLINE> Ghana Earns $171Million From Timber Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Ghana earned 171 million U.S.
Dollars from exporting 415,700 cubic meters of timber and wood
products last year, the official Ghana News Agency (GNA) said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A Forest Products Inspection Bureau (FPIB) report said that
the earnings showed an increase of three percent in value and a
decrease of six percent in volume over 1997 when the timber export
of 442,078 cubic meters valued at about 170.5 million Dollars,
indicating that the government's policy of adding value to timber
is on course.
</P>
<P>
"This was in conformity with the Government's policy to
encourage downstream processing and export of value-added
products. The year ended with signs of positive development in the
timber industry," GNA quoted the report as saying.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the major wood products exported was kiln dried lumber
which recorded about 46 million Dollars, in value followed by air
dried lumber about 44.6 million Dollars and veneers about 45
million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Major destination for Ghana's wood products were Germany,
Ireland, Britain, Italy, the United States and France, said the
report. Others are Belgium, the Netherlands, Saudi Arabia, Spain,
and Burkina Faso.

<HEADLINE> New Smart Car Preparing to Take The Road </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Researchers in Germany are
testing a new generation of smart cars which can take charge of
steering, brakes and even indicate when it is about to change
lane.
</P>
<P>
The new autopilot system, developed at the Fraunhofer Institute
for Information and Data Processing, Germany, has been designed to
cope with busy urban conditions, New Scientist magazine said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Previous system already on the market could only keep a car a
certain distance from the one in front and has no control over the
steering.
</P>
<P>
But rather than simply telling the driver to slow down on empty
roads, the new system can take control of the car and maneuver it
out of danger. If the driver wants to regain control, they simply
have to put their hands back on the wheel and start driving again.
</P>
<P>
The new system does not automatically keep to speed limits,
instead it simply stays in line with the other cars, speeding up
when they do and slowing or stopping when necessary. This tactic
avoids the need to recognize individual lanes which is difficult
on busy town streets.
</P>
<P>
The system relies on two video cameras on the front of the car.
This visual information is fed into two computer chips. These work
out where the car is on the road and where any other cars are.
</P>
<P>
The chips recognize cars, pedestrians and road junctions by
comparing what the cameras see with stored three-dimensional
models. If action is necessary, then the steering, for example, is
automatically adjusted.
</P>
<P>
The test system has its weaknesses. The database only contains
ideal roads of specified widths.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that it will be a long time before we see such
vehicles on the road, because the electronics are still too big to
fit in most of today's cars.
</P>
<P>
There would also need to be legal changes. In the UK, for
example, automatic control of steering and brakes is illegal.

<HEADLINE> EU Requests WTO to Probe U.S. Trade Law Section 301 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
requested the World Trade Organization (WTO) here Wednesday to set
up a panel to examine the United States' controversial "Section
301" trade law but which it has used to press trade sanctions but
the EU move was blocked by the U.S., according to WTO officials.
</P>
<P>
However, the panel will surely be established if the EU insists
its request a second time, because the rules of the WTO's dispute
settlement machanism state that a panel must be granted at the
second time of asking unless all members are opposed.
</P>
<P>
After its first proposal was blocked, the EU promptly said it
would apply for a special session of the WTO's Dispute Settlement
Body (DSB) within 15 days to reconsider the request.
</P>
<P>
WTO officials said EU trade envoy Roderick Abbott had told the
DSB, which meets behind closed doors, that the U.S. law was
incompatible with the WTO as it allows unilateral action while the
Geneva-based body operates on a multilateral basis.
</P>
<P>
Section 301 of the U.S. Trade Act was recently used by the U.S.
as the basis of its threat to impose swinging trade sanctions on
the EU in the two sides' dispute over banana imports.
</P>
<P>
U.S. trade envoy Rita Hayes told the meeting that the EU's
interpretation of the Section 301 was "factually and legally
inaccurate", according to WTO officials.
</P>
<P>
She said the EU's move was an attempt to distract attention
from the banana dispute itself. The U.S. says the 15-nation bloc's
banana import regime breaks free trade rules by discriminating in
favor of former European colonies.
</P>
<P>
The United States has threatened to impose punitive duties on
$520 million of EU exports in the row over bananas.

<P>
Brussels, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) on
Wednesday expressed its deep concerns about the ongoing crisis in
the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), saying that the current
conflict can only be solved through a negotiated settlement.
</P>
<P>
The EU said in a presidency declaration that in view of some
positive signals with regard to a possible signing of a ceasefire
agreement, the EU is of the opinion that peace efforts should now
be enhanced in order to bring about a speedy conclusion of such an
agreement.
</P>
<P>
"The European Union welcomes President Kabila's preparedness to
enter into negotiations with all parties to the conflict,
including the rebel movement, and encourages him to conclude a
ceasefire agreement as soon as possible. The European Union also
urges all other parties involved in the conflict, both the rebel
movement and external actors, to participate in a constructive
manner in the ongoing peace efforts," the declaration said.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation European bloc also said that it strongly condemns
acts of violence perpetrated against the civilian population since
the beginning of the crisis. The EU "firmly calls on the conflict
parties to respect human rights and humanitarian law."
</P>
<P>
"The European Union hopes that the forthcoming mission to DRC
by the UN Special Rapporteur Mr. Garreton will help shed light on
the consequences of the conflict on the human rights' situation,
and that it will contribute to enhanced cooperation between the
international community and the DRC in this field," the EU
presidency declaration said.
