<HEADLINE> VW Confirms Continued Bid for Rolls-Royce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Europe's largest carmaker Volkswagen
confirmed Friday that it was still bidding for British carmaker
Rolls-Royce despite Rolls' parent company Vickers has announced
its German rival BMW as the winner in the bidding.
</P>
<P>
Kurt Rippholz, spokesman for the German company, told German
press agency DPA in Wolfsburg that VW submitted an improved bid
last Monday, on which Vickers announced the principal agreement to
negotiate with BMW.
</P>
<P>
Rippholz said that along with the new offer, VW also presented
Vickers with detailed investment plans and concepts about
Rolls-Royce's future development.
</P>
<P>
Rippholz declined to disclose financial details of VW's new
offer. But German press reports estimated the bid well above the
340 million pounds (570 million U.S. dollars) offered by BMW,
which makes the V12 engine for Rolls-Royce.
</P>
<P>
Suedeutsche newspaper said VW offered about 1.1 billion marks
(600 million dollars), while the Financial Times had earlier
reported a figure of 1.7 billion marks (927 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Vickers said that it would negotiate exclusively
with BMW during this month and a final decision would be made at a
special shareholders' meeting in late May.
</P>
<P>
BMW has threatened to cease supplying engines and components to
Rolls-Royce should it not take over the luxury carmaker.

<HEADLINE> Basic Law Means Hong Kong-Mainland Ties Entering New Era (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The Secretary for Constitutional
Affairs, Michael Suen, told a symposium on Friday that relations
between the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong entered a new era
after Hong Kong was returned to China on July 1 last year.
</P>
<P>
He told the symposium, "Hong Kong is Our Home", which was held
on the occasion of the eighth anniversary of the Basic Law, that
the three guiding principles of "one country, two systems", "Hong
Kong people governing Hong Kong", and High Degree of Autonomy
form the cornerstones of the Basic Law and are also the framework
within which the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR)
will conduct its affairs and which defines its relations with the
Central Authorities.
</P>
<P>
Suen said that People's Republic of China's constitution and
the Basic Law provide legal protection for the former colony's
capitalist system and way of life and that the leaders are
committed to these principles.
</P>
<P>
He quoted President Jiang Zemin as saying during the First
Session of the Ninth National People's Congress last month that
the central authorities and all provinces, regions, and
municipalities will abide by the Basic Law and fully support the
HKSAR government in accordance with the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
The Central People's Government will not allow any authorities
on the mainland, or any local regions to interfere in matters
involving the autonomy of the HKSAR, he said, and that this
demonstrates the commitment of the government to the Basic Law and
to relations between the mainland and the HKSAR.

<TEXT>
<P>
Suen said the Basic Law provides a broad principle for the
division of responsibilities between the Hong Kong SAR government
and the MFA Office. Since the founding of the HKSAR, the
Constitutional Affairs Bureau has maintained frequent contacts
with various departments in MFA and they have developed a smooth
and cordial working relationship, he said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong continues to play an active role in international
affairs and maintains close contacts with international
partners. Its government representatives have been part of
China's delegations in more than 30 international conferences and
have participated on their own under the name "Hong Kong, China",
in over 500 international conferences.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, the central government has agreed to give
authorization to the Hong Kong SAR government for 34 bilateral
agreements on air services, overflights, juridical assistance, and
visas.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said they are confident that cooperation with the
MFA will allow Hong Kong's external affairs to be handled properly
in line with the Basic Law and the 'one country, two systems'
principle.
</P>
<P>
Suen said that the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the
State Council has good contacts with the Hong Kong SAR and that
there are direct contacts across the border between police and
immigration and customs officers that contribute much to mutual
understanding and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
This represents the result of their determination to implement
the Basic Law and to enhance mutual understanding and
communication and he said he believes that the mainland and Hong
Kong will do even more in the 21st century through common efforts
and cooperation.

It said that the planes, which are better suited to operate in
the extreme heat of the coming summer months, will join the eight
Tornados already based in Kuwait.

<P>
HARARE, April 3 (Xanhua) -- The Zimbabwe National Chamber of
Commerce Friday welcomed the recent decision by South Africa that
60 pgrcent of industrial and agricultural products from members
of the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) enjoy no
import tariffs.
</P>
<P>
"The goodwill gesture by the South Qfrican government to scrap
import tariffs on 60 percent of industrial and agricultural
products as of January 1, 1999 is a positive contribution towards
achiaving regional economic growth," said Danny Meyer, president
of the Chamber of Commerce, quoted by the Zimbabwe News Agency.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, this action servesto kick-s|art the process of
phasing out import tariffs on all products originating from
wi|hin the region faster than t*-!Qyears ppoposed in the
SADC trade protocol yet to be ratified by most member states," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
For the Zimbabwean business community, Meyer said, the
decision opened the door wider as accessintn the largest and
most lucrative market in the region would become easier.
</P>
<P>
But, he addeD, it was difficult to say which specific sectors
were likely"to benefiT kn the absence of exact deta)ls of the 60
percent of industrial and agricultural products being proposed.
</P>
<P>
HowevEr, the move would in general have a major and positive
impact on the agricultural and industriaL sectors as South Africa
was Zimbabwe's lagest export market.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan, Canada Enjoy Excellent Ties: Pak Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Minister of State for
Foreign Affairs Siddique Khan Kanju said here Friday that his
country and Canada enjoy excellent bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Kanju expressed the hope that the on-going visit to Pakistan by
Governor General of Canada Romeo Leblanc would further strengthen
these ties.
</P>
<P>
While meeting Canada's Secretary of State for Asia-Pacific
Raymond Chan, who is here accompanying Romeo Leblanc, Kanju said
significant initiatives were taken during the Canadian Prime
Minister's visit to Pakistan two years ago.
</P>
<P>
"Our Prime Minister will also be visiting Canada later this
year," he said, adding that "such visits provide the impetus to
further consolidation of bilateral ties."
</P>
<P>
He briefed Raymond Chan in detail about the Pak-India relations
and the foreign secretary-level talks between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Unless the core issue of Kashmir was addressed in an integrated
manner besides other issues, the process of dialogue would not
succeed, he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Kashmir issue had to be resolved in
accordance with the resolutions of the Security Council of the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Kanju also briefed his Canadian guest on the situation in
Afghanistan and the initiatives taken by the Pakistani government
to bring all Afghan factions within negotiating range.
</P>
<P>
On the occasion, Raymond Chan said that Canada would urge both
India and Pakistan to seek a political solution of their problems
including the Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
He said Canada would be happy to assist in any way. The offer
of mediation made by the Canadian Prime Minister during his last
visit to Pakistan was still open, he added.
</P>
<P>
He expressed Canada's concern over the situation in Afghanistan
and said that it would continue to support U.N. efforts to resolve
the conflict.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Pakistan's Acting Speaker Muhammad Jaffar Iqbal held
a meeting here with members of the Canadian parliament Deepak
Obhrai, Real Menard, Nelson A. Riis and Elizabeth Kingston, who
are also accompanying the Governor General.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting the two sides discussed issues including
prospects of the Canadian investment in Pakistan and Pak-Canada
relations.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Makes 24-Million-Dollar Appeal for Somali Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) presented here on Friday an
appeal of 24 million U.S. dollars for its 1998 Somali program.
</P>
<P>
"The program is in a crucial phase," said UNHCR's Regional
Director Albert-Alain Peters. "Thousands of Somali refugees have
decided to return home, mainly to the northwest of the country,
and we need to be able to give the same opportunity to many
others."
</P>
<P>
The majority of refugees who fled the civil war in Somalia
beginning in 1989 are in Ethiopia (240,000 as of January 1, 1998)
and Kenya (134,000). Smaller groups are in Djibouti, Yemen and
Libya.
</P>
<P>
Authorities in Hargeisa in northwest Somalia have agreed with
UNHCR on a cumulative target of 100,000 returns for 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR expects 60,000 Somalis from Ethiopia to return to the
northwest in 1998, and another 16,500 from other countries.
</P>
<P>
"In some areas of Somalia the situation is very encouraging,"
Peters said. "This is why people are registering to return. We
must give our full support to reintegration where people are
asking for."
</P>
<P>
"If we do so now, we have the chance to make their return a
success," Peters stressed.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR's reintegration program includes aid for education, where
in some regions less than 20 percent of primary school-aged
children attend school, and boys outnumber girls two to one.
</P>
<P>
Assistance also targets the estimated 35 percent of households
headed by women, with initiatives designed to give women their own
source of livelihood through a range of small businesses. Clean
water will be supplied to communities and their livestock from new
wells and traditional water catchments.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Welcomes S. Africa's Tariff Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe National Chamber of
Commerce Friday welcomed the recent decision by South Africa that
60 percent of industrial and agricultural products from members
of the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) enjoy no
import tariffs.
</P>
<P>
"The goodwill gesture by the South African government to scrap
import tariffs on 60 percent of industrial and agricultural
products as of January 1, 1999 is a positive contribution towards
achieving regional economic growth," said Danny Meyer, president
of the Chamber of Commerce, quoted by the Zimbabwe News Agency.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, this action serves to kick-start the process of
phasing out import tariffs on all products originating from
within the region faster than the eight years proposed in the
SADC trade protocol yet to be ratified by most member states," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
For the Zimbabwean business community, Meyer said, the
decision opened the door wider as access into the largest and
most lucrative market in the region would become easier.
</P>
<P>
But, he added, it was difficult to say which specific sectors
were likely to benefit in the absence of exact details of the 60
percent of industrial and agricultural products being proposed.
</P>
<P>
However, the move would in general have a major and positive
impact on the agricultural and industrial sectors as South Africa
was Zimbabwe's largest export market.

HARARE, April 3 (Xinhua) -- A four-week photographic
exhibition of "masterpieces of Chinese cultural relics" opened
Friday in Harare.
</P>
<P>
About 100 people including high-ranking officials from the
Zimbabwean government and foreign diplomats in Harare attended
the opening ceremony of the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech, S.J. Chifunyise, acting Zimbabwe's

very cordial relations existing between Zimbabwe and China.
</P>
<P>
"The exhibition will show the people of Zimbabwe for the first
time fifty beautiful pictures of Chinese cultural relics dated
from the neolithic age to the Qing Dynasty," he said, adding "It
marks a new development in cultural exchanges between our two
countries."
</P>
<P>
Also on the occasion, Qiu Bohua, charge d'affaires of the
Chinese Embassy to Zimbabwe, noted that up to December 1997, a

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Dollar Gains in Value </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean Dollar, which fell
sharply against major currencies at the end of last year, has
appreciated by about 12 percent since the beginning of the year
as stability slowly claws back onto the foreign exchange market,
Finance Minister Herbert Murerwa said Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to him, import pressure on foreign exchange reserves
was declining due to policy measures undertaken by the government
and reserve bank.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the government ordered all corporate foreign
currency account holders to offload their foreign exchange onto
the market and increased the rediscount rate twice in less than
two months to 31.5 percent in a bid to prop up the tumbling
Zimbabwean Dollar.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean Dollar, which fell 40 percent aga0HT+.h}wder immense import pr
essure, has been stable for the
past month trading at between 16 and 17 Dollars against the U.S.
Dollar.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the finance minister said, efforts by the
government to secure a three-billion-Zimbabwean-Dollar (about 180
million U.S. Dollars) one year stand-by balance of payment
facility with the International Monetary Fund and foreign
currency inflows from tobacco sales would further stabilize the
currency, the news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"The economic program we have put in place seeks to bring
about macro-economic stability and restore investor confidence,"
he said, adding "The process of fiscal consolidation will
continue in this context."

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Refugees Hard to Cope with: UNHCR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The influx of Sierra Leonean
refugees from an eastern diamond production region into
neighboring Guinea and Liberia have brought new problems to
refugees agencies.
</P>
<P>
It is even more troublesome particularly when the United
Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) has just begun to
repatriate Liberian refugees who fled the civil war to Guinea in
the past years.
</P>
<P>
According to a UNHCR regional director, 25,000 refugees
recently arrived in a Guinean border town, some of them were
badly wounded by the junta forces.
</P>
<P>
Most of the women were reported to have been raped while some
of the young men were taken hostage by the junta forces, with
their property looted, he said, quoted by the British
Broadcasting Corporation Friday.
</P>
<P>
To cater for the needs of the refugees, the UNHCR has to
organize the putting up of new structures within that area with
the help and assistance of the Guinean government and
international non-governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to cope despite the extremely difficult
situation," the UNHCR official said.
</P>
<P>
The situation will become more difficult in the next two
months with the onset of the rainy season, which is a threat to
the existing bad roads for transportation of necessities.
</P>
<P>
However, the official expressed confidence, saying that
UNHCR's work has the support of the Guinean and Liberian
governments, the international Communities, organizations such as
World Food Program and local communities.

<HEADLINE> Mugabe Sets Conditions for Stepping Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
said Friday he is willing to step down provided this is by
popular demand through the right channels, the Zimbabwe News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a ruling Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic
Front (ZANU-PF) rally at Gutu-Mupandawana growth point in
Masvingo Province, south Zimbabwe, Mugabe said he would only step
down through a resolution by his party's congress if a majority
of his followers felt it was time for him to go.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, while addressing a meeting of traditional chiefs and
local politicians at a local hotel in Gutu, Mugabe accused people
who had constantly stated that he had overstayed in power.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe has ruled Zimbabwe since its independence from British
colonialists in 1980.
</P>
<P>
"Some people say Mugabe has overstayed. These people say I
should take the example of South African President Nelson
Mandela. They do not look at the fact that the Mandelas have
their own way of doing things, and we have our own way of doing
things," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have our own constitution of how a president steps down,"
he noted.
</P>
<P>
After listening to the various sentiments suggesting
factionalism had reached unprecedented heights in Masvingo, the
president tasked new Provincial Chairman Zephania Matchaba-Hove
with uniting the people.
</P>
<P>
"We, as the leadership in general, will do as much as we can
to help you achieve unity in the province," he said.

<HEADLINE> Brittan Praises China for Its Response to Asian Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 3 (Xinhua) -- European Commission Vice President
Leon Brittan Friday praised China for its "steady response" to the
Asian financial crisis, notably by resisting any devaluation of
its currency.
</P>
<P>
Brittan, in his closing speech at the third Asia-Europe
Business Forum, said: "It is my firm belief that China is coming
of age on the international scene."
</P>
<P>
Brittan stressed: "No country in Asia -- perhaps no country in the
world -- is more important for the future of the global economy
than China."
</P>
<P>
"Within the next twenty years, China is forecast to be the
second largest trading nation. Achieving her successful
integration into the world economic system is a huge strategic
challenge for Europe." he added.
</P>
<P>
To further develop EU-China relations in the coming years,
Brittan disclosed that the Commission has just set out a new
strategy, which he very much hoped will soon be endorsed by EU
member states.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his confidence in the ability of Asian countries to
bounce back from their current difficulties, Brittan said: "The
fundamentals of the Asian economies are sound; their peoples are
industrious, hard-working and well trained ... Asia can take off
again."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the measures the EU is going to take to ease the
Asian crisis, Brittan said it plans to set up an Asia-Europe
Meeting (ASEM) Trust Fund at the World Bank to help financial
restructuring and to prepare projects dealing with the social
aspects of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the Commission proposes to establish a network of
European financial experts to facilitate the provision of European
expertise in areas such as banking supervision and financial
restructuring.
</P>
<P>
And finally, in the event that it should become necessary, the
EU stands ready to provide substantial quantities of emergency
food aid, Brittan said.
</P>
<P>
"We very much hope, of course, that such a situation will not
come about," he added.

<HEADLINE> Iraq's Stance on Banned Weapons Justified: Aziz </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Iraq said on Friday that the
inspections of the eight Iraqi presidential sites by a special
group of the United Nations have justified its position that it
has no prohibited weapons, the Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"The outcome of the group's visit (to the presidential sites)
has verified Iraq's credibility and exposed (the falsehood of) the
allegations of the United States, Britain ... about those sites,"
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz in a statement carried by
the news agency.
</P>
<P>
The special group, formed under an agreement signed between the
U.N. and Iraq in February, comprises senior diplomats appointed by
the U.N. and weapons experts of the U.N. Special Commission
(UNSCOM). It completed the first round of its eight-day mission on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Through reviewing the huge fuss of the U.S. and Britain, "we
would notice the great difference between those lies and the
truth," Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain have alleged that Iraq has hidden its
weapons of mass destruction in the presidential sites, which they
have maintained should be inspected by the UNSCOM. But Iraq has
declared the sites off-limits for reasons of national sovereignty
and security.
</P>
<P>
The issue was at the core of a crisis last February when the
U.S., backed by Britain and some other countries, threatened to
take military actions to force Iraqi compliance with the arms
inspections.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan succeeded through a tough
mediation in persuading Iraq to open the presidential sites to
inspections, which helped defuse the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The diplomats of the special group have come to realize the
flatness of the lies of the U.S. and Britain, Aziz said, stressing
that what has been achieved is a triumph for the truth over the
falsehood.
</P>
<P>
He accused the two countries of using the lies as pretexts for
committing an aggression against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"Such a result makes it imperative for the U.N. Security
Council to seriously work for lifting the eight-year-old unjust
embargo on Iraq ...," said Aziz.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed economic sanctions on Iraq, barring export of
oil, its main revenue earner, in 1990 after its invasion of
Kuwait. The U.N. Security Council will not lift the sanctions
until the UNSCOM certifies that Iraq has destroyed all its banned
weapons.

<HEADLINE> China Urges More Efforts to Promote Asia-Europe Partnership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Addressing the afternoon session of the Second Asia-Europe
Meeting (ASEM2), Premier Zhu said that the ASEM mechanism is of
major importance to "summing up the successful experience gained
in Asia-Europe cooperation over the past two years."
</P>
<P>
"Positive changes of strategic significance have taken place in
the mutually beneficial cooperation and mutual relations between
the two continents of Asia and Europe," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have also made marked progress in the fields of
political consultations, economic and trade cooperation, cultural
exchanges and cooperation in international affairs, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Practice has proved that ASEM has already played and will
continue to play a positive role in promoting the friendly and
mutually beneficial cooperation between Asia and Europe," Premier
Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Forecasting the future of ASEM, Premier Zhu expressed the
desire of establishing "a new type of Asia-Europe partnership,"
envisaging the prospects of Asia-Europe cooperation in the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
Putting forward some fresh initiatives aimed at strengthening
Asia-Europe relationship, the Chinese premier stressed that both
sides "should persist in giving top priority to our respective
advantages and open up various cooperation channels."
</P>
<P>
He also appealed for reducing trade barriers, enhancing
cooperation in both large enterprises and small companies,
relaxing restrictions on technical transfers and providing
developing countries with advanced technologies.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu proposed to hold an "Asia-Europe Scientific and
Technological Ministerial Meeting" to exchange views on issues of
mutual intertest and work out specific measures for the
development of scientific and technological cooperation.
</P>
<P>
On ASEM political consultation and dialogue, he pointed out:
"differences should be handled properly in the spirit of
respecting each other, seeking common ground while putting aside
differences and making steady progress."
</P>
<P>
"We should cherish and develop the existing sound atmosphere
for and momentum of dialogue, replace confrontation with dialogue
and conflict with cooperation, and strives to find and expand the
converging points of common interests," Premier Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
"We must establish and develop a new type of cross-century
partnership so as to contribute to peace and development in Asia
and Europe and in the world at large," he added.
</P>
<P>
Early Friday, Premier Zhu held talks with German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl at the conference center to exchange views on
bilateral relations and other issues of common interest.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday afternoon, Premier Zhu attended the summit talks of
the participating 10 Asian countries to coordinate their stands on
the key issues of the ASEM2 conference, especially on the Asian
financial crisis.

<HEADLINE> Canadians Hit by Salmonella </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Some 275 Canadians across the
country, most of them children, have been hit by salmonella
poisoning, a report said Friday.
</P>
<P>
There were cases of salmonella poisoning in every Canadian
province except British Columbia, according to the Globe and Mail
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"It's a substantial outbreak," Andrea Ellis, an epidemiologist
with the federal Laboratory Centre of Disease Control, was quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Canada's most populous province of Ontario had only 529 cases
of salmonella poisoning in all of 1995. "So to have just under 200
cases in one month is quite significant," she said.
</P>
<P>
Salmonella bacteria are the most common cause of food
poisoning. The symptoms of salmonella poisoning include fever,
diarrhea, vomitting and abdominal cramps.
</P>
<P>
The outbreak was first noted last month in St. John's, New
Brunswick. Part of the cases could be linked to a packaged
luncheon snack.
</P>
<P>
The products have since been voluntarily recalled by the food
processor J.M. Schneider Inc..

<HEADLINE> German Central Banker Still Worries about Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 3 (Xinhua) -- German central bank president Hans
Tietmeyer on Friday restated his doubt about the ability of Italy
and Belgium to considerably reduce their massive debts anytime
soon in order to live up to the stability criteria for the single
European currency, the euro.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a hearing at the German parliament, Tietmeyer
insisted that Italy and Belgium make binding commitments to reduce
their debt levels which are more than double the 60 percent of
gross domestic product that the EU Maastricht Treaty set as a
target for countries adopting the euro.
</P>
<P>
However, the German central banker was also careful enough to
duck any clear recommendation to disqualify the two countries from
the euro club. "The selection of participants remains a political
decision," he said.
</P>
<P>
The German cabinet last month already decided to follow a EU
Commission's recommendation to launch the euro in January 1999
with 11 member states, also including Italy and Belgium.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Lebanon to Issue Billion Dollars of Eurobonds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 3 (Xinhua) -- In the Middle East's largest single
borrowing, Lebanon signed an agreement with a French bank Friday
to issue 1 billion U.S. dollars Eurobonds.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by Lebanese Minister of State for
Financial Affairs Fuad Sinyoura and Nigolas Kostantiku,
representative of the Paribas bank which helped Lebanon issue 5
billion U.S. dollars Eurobonds a week ago.
</P>
<P>
The issue is aimed at bringing down the country's ballooning
deficit and reduce large domestic debt.
</P>
<P>
The National News Agency quoted Sinioura as saying that the
issue is the largest single borrowing ever in the Middle East, and
also for the world's emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
The issue will be divided into a five-year offering carrying
8.5 percent interest rate and 8 percent for three-year, both in
the same amount.
</P>
<P>
"We decided to further issue 1 billion dollars in light of the
strong demand for the earlier issue," he said.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Lebanese, Arab and western investors were rushing
to buy into the country's 5 billion dollars Eurobonds marketed
also by Paribas bank through the "roadshows," a series of
presentations that move from one country to country.
</P>
<P>
The issue, the minister said, will serve to reduce the
government's heavy burdens imposed by the public debt which has
reached 15 billion dollars in January. Out of it, 12.6 billion
dollars are internal.
</P>
<P>
"We intend to reduce large domestic debt with the high
interest rate through borrowing lower interest-rate debt in
foreign currencies," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the outside borrowing will also pave the way for the
Lebanese private sector to gain enough loans to invest in the
country's economy, he added.

<HEADLINE> Chinese PM Calls for Promoting Asia-Europe Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji called
on Asian and European countries to increase mutual investment and
reduce trade barriers so as to further push forward their
bilateral economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Zhu made the statement in his address to the second Asia-Europe
Meeting here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, entitled "Enhance Mutually Beneficial
Cooperation and Promote Common Development," Zhu urged Asia and
Europe to give top priority to economic cooperation and trade.
</P>
<P>
To this end, Zhu suggested that the two sides give play to
their respective advantages and open up various cooperation
channels.
</P>
<P>
Zhu appealed to the two continents for further enhancing their
cooperation in the scientific and technological field.
</P>
<P>
Developed countries, he said, should relax the restrictions on
technical transfer and provide developing countries with advanced
technologies, which he believed serves the interests of developed
countries themselves.
</P>
<P>
Zhu suggested an "Asia-Europe Scientific and Technological
Ministerial Meeting" be held for ASEM members to work for specific
measures for developing the scientific cooperation. China stands
ready to host the proposed meeting, the Chinese premier said.
</P>
<P>
On working for closer international cooperation in the
financial sector, Zhu hoped the two sides will strengthen mutual
co-ordination and support, conduct closer cooperation between
their financial supervisory and regulatory departments.
</P>
<P>
The Asian financial crisis shows that to take precautions
against financial risks is the shared responsibility and in the
common interests of both sides, Zhu pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He said the two sides should actively participate in
international financial support programs to guard against and
resist financial risks.
</P>
<P>
Zhu also called on the two sides to step up political dialogue
and consultation.
</P>
<P>
"We should cherish and develop the existing sound atmosphere
for and momentum of dialogue, replace confrontation with dialogue
and conflict with cooperation, and strive to find and expand the
converging points of common interests," Zhu said.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Records Decrease in Population Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria, with Africa's biggest
popluation, has recorded a decrease in its population growth rate
from 3.2 percent in the 1980s to 2.8 percent in 1995, official
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Nkess Nkposong, an official from the Federal Ministry of
Health told a workshop in Ibadan City Thursday that the total
number of children a Nigerian woman would give birth to by the
end of her reproductive life was 5.5 in 1995, compared to 6.6 in
1981-82.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's population was estimated at 104 million as in 1997,
the 10th largest in the world.
</P>
<P>
Projecting from the 1991 census, Nigeria would have a
population of 180 million by the year 2017, said Nkp osong, who
is an assistant director of the Department of Community
Development and Population Activities.
</P>
<P>
"Information from 1995 surveys indicates that Nigeria may have
entered the first stage of demographic transition," the official
said, "This is a situation where there is rapid decline in the
birth and death rates with the former declining more rapidly so
that population growth is declining."
</P>
<P>
The official, however, regreted that Nigeria's infant
mortality rate is still very high with 114 per 1,000 while the
maternal mortality is extremely high with an estimated number of
1,000 per 100,000 live births.
</P>
<P>
The situation may have to do with the fact that about 13
percent of Nigerian girls began to bear children at age 15 and
nearly half by 20.
</P>
<P>
Poor medical service is also to blame, Nkposong said, adding
that there is currently one hospital bed to approximately 900
Nigerians.

<P>
He said the move is taken to prevent the possibilities of
troubles spreading from neighboring Sierra Leone, adding that "If
we are attacked, we can't use sticks and bottles to defend the
country."

"We are a sovereign country. We have to bring arms in and
we'll not hide them. Nobody will stop us," Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the west African peacekeeping force (ECOMOG) accused
Taylor's government of smuggling weapons into the country in
defiance of the United Nations' arms embargo.
</P>
<P>
"If Liberia is to continue to be part of it (ECOMOG), the
force needs to be responsible and topless structured," Taylor
said.
</P>
<P>
"We support ECOMOG, but only an ECOMOG which respects the
president of an ECOWAS (Economic Community of West African
States) country," he said.

ANKARA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Turkey on Friday accused the

</P>
<P>
Most cases of drug trafficking in Turkey have been found
relating to the PKK, a Turkish security official declining to be
named was quoted by the news agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
"There are indications that money from the drug smuggling has
become one of the important financial sources (of the PKK)," the
official said.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has used the money to support its 14-year-old fighting
against the Turkish government in an attempt to set up an
independent Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey, he said.
</P>
<P>
The official said the PKK hired the unemployed or illegal
immigrants in Turkey to serve as street sellers or smuggle drug to
Europe.
</P>
<P>
"Some PKK branches in some European countries are also involved
in these unlawful activities," he added.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is one of the key routes to transfer drugs from Asia to
Europe. According to official statistics, around 10 tonnes of
hashish and 3.5 tonnes of heroin were seized in Turkey last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Botswana
Democratic Party (BDP) has nominated just-retired army commander
lieutenant-general Seretse Khama as vice-president of Botswana,
South African Press Association (SAPA) quoted the president's
office as saying Friday.
</P>
<P>
Khama's appointment will be subject to his election into
parliament within four months and the attainment of parliamentary
approval.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the BDP's parliamentary majority ensures a
smooth passage of the nomination through the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Khama would contest a by-election at Serowe North, the family
birthplace and seat of the Bamangwato paramount chief.
</P>
<P>
He is the eldest son of Botswana's first president, late
Seretse Khama who was also founder of the BDP. He followed
his father as paramount chief of the Bamangwato, the country's
largest and most influential tribe.
</P>
<P>
The presidential office said the date of the by-election would
be announced as soon as incumbent member of parliament Roy
Blackbeard, former agriculture minister, retires from active
politics.
</P>
<P>
Khama, who retired from the army on March 31 along with
President Ketumile Masire, has already been appointed as Minister
of Presidential Affairs and Public Administration, which is
considered to be the president's right hand.
</P>
<P>
The ministry controls the army, police, information and
broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
It is widely accepted that the new president, Festus Mogae,
brought Khama into his government to help reunite the BDP, which
has seen various factions fighting for control of the party.
</P>
<P>
Mogae succeeded Masire after Masire's retirement Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Businesses Like Toll-Free Numbers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- High demand by Canadian businesses
for toll-free numbers has forced phone companies here to introduce
877 numbers starting Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Canadian businesses use 800 and 888 numbers for customers who
wish to place orders or get product help. At present, Canada has
about 250,000 toll-free numbers in service.
</P>
<P>
The 888 numbers, launched just two years ago, ran out three
years earlier than expected.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of 877 numbers across North America will add
another 7.89 million combinations firms can use, said reports
Friday.
</P>
<P>
At the current rate, Canadian phone companies are expected to
run out of 877 numbers by September 1999. After that, it will
introduce 866 and 855 toll-free prefixes.
</P>
<P>
It took almost 30 years for phone companies in North America to
run out of 800 numbers.

ecu (1 ecu=$1.07) for the former Yugoslavia, a release from the
the UN spokesman's office said on Friday.

In Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Croatia, the aid will mainly
support the return of displaced persons and refugees, in close
coordination with the Office of the High Representative and the UN
High Commissioner for Refugees.
</P>
<P>
This new humanitarian aid infusion brings ECHO's total
contribution to the former Yugoslavia since the beginning of the

<HEADLINE> London, Frankfurt Stocks End at New Records </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe had a
record breaking week, with London and Frankfurt both hitting new
record closing highs Friday and Paris ending slightly lower after
all of the three markets touched all-time intraday highs.
</P>
<P>
Britain's FTSE 100 index of leading shares had soared 50 points
earlier to reach an intraday record of 6,105.3, inspired by Wall
Street's big gains Thursday, before ending marginally up, yet
hitting its third consecutive record closing high.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that earlier Wall Street inspired gains gave way
to a tenacious two-way pull, but the index managed to stay above
the 6,050 level, closing at 6,064.2, up 11.4 points or 0.19
percent on the day, and a rise of 124.9 points from last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Profit-taking on the last trading day of the tax year helped to
wipe out early gains, and some caution was noted ahead of next
week's Bank of England monetary meeting.
</P>
<P>
German shares in Frankfurt staged an even sharper rally, with
the DAX-30 index finishing the week at a fresh closing peak of
5,223.52, up 46.86 points or 0.91 percent after having hit a new
intraday record of 5,246.04.
</P>
<P>
Traders said that the market maintained a positive tone despite
declines in Asia, boosted by a firmer Dow, a strong dollar and
sharp gains in some heavyweight stocks.
</P>
<P>
The CAC-40 index in Paris closed slightly lower on record
volume, down from a fresh intraday high of 3,987.82 on concerns
that Wall Street would be hit by a weaker than expected March U.S.
jobs report.
</P>
<P>
The index closed at 3932.02, down 3.86 points or 0.10 percent,
but a rise of 121.79 from last week.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Says He Will Do His Best Despite Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said Friday he does not intend to be deterred from doing his work
as the nation's chief executive by Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr's investigation of sexual misconduct allegations.
</P>
<P>
Back home after his African trip, Clinton appeared in the Rose
Garden today to express his concern over the Senate-passed budget
blueprint that rejects his domestic priorities.
</P>
<P>
Following a formal statement, he was asked about reports on CNN
and in U.S. News and World Report that Starr is being urged by
some of his deputies to indict former intern Monica Lewinsky and
to name Clinton as an unindicted co-conspirator.
</P>
<P>
The weekly magazine said the debate in Starr's camp took on a
new impetus after a federal judge's dismissal of the Paula Jones
sexual harassment lawsuit against the president.
</P>
<P>
In response Clinton said, "I'm not going to comment on that.
I'm going to try to do what the Supreme Court said I should do and
not be deterred in any way by that. I'm going to do my best."
</P>
<P>
The reports, attributed to "informed sources" but not
identified said some members of Starr's team are convinced only an
indictment of Lewinsky can bring the question of obstruction of
justice and suborning perjury to a public trial now that the Jones
case has been thrown out.
</P>
<P>
U.S. News said a faction in Starr's office believes the special
counsel should continue his federal grand jury investigation and
pile up evidence to be turned over to Congress.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Canadian Governor
General Romeo Leblanc called here Saturday for stronger business
relations with Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a luncheon hosted by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
in his honor, Leblanc said, "under the Colombo Plan of the
nineteen-fifties, and later under bilateral arrangements, some two
billion (U.S.) dollars from our country has helped to develop your
own."
</P>
<P>
This partnership has left its mark all over Pakistan, in
projects ranging from small schools and clinics to the mighty dams
at Warsak and Tarbela, said Leblanc.
</P>
<P>
"We still continue our cooperative work in infrastructure, but
we balance it by a growing emphasis on human development" he
added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Canada and Pakistan are now working together on
environmental protection, the regulation of energy, financial
credit systems, human rights, health care, education, and
training, especially for women, and on strengthening social and
economic institutions generally.
</P>
<P>
The governor general said that Pakistan has been "a leader in
economic reforms." It has created a friendly environment for
investment and growth. And Canada's partnership with Pakistan is
broadening from aid to a growing trade, he added.
</P>
<P>
Canada wants to give renewed impetus to bilateral economic
relations, said Leblanc, adding that "Our friendly and productive
relationship has the potential for impressive growth."
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sharif said on the occasion that his government
has initiated wide-ranging economic reforms. "It is our objective
to create and nurture a corporate culture in Pakistan, wherein the
private sector could play its role in nation building," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the attractive investment incentives included in the
new and business friendly investment policy made Pakistan a land
of many opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Sharif expressed his confidence that the current two-way trade
and the level of Canadian investment in Pakistan can be increased
manifold.

<HEADLINE> ASEM Calls for Closer Asia-Europe Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The 25 leaders attending the second
Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM 2) agreed on Saturday to foster
political dialogue, reinforce cooperation in economic and other
fields.
</P>
<P>
By adopting the Chairman's Statement at the end of the two-day
conference, leaders from China, Japan, South Korea, the seven
ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) countries, and the
15 EU member states, confirmed that the ASEM process should be
conducted on the basis of equal partnership, mutual respect and
mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
It should also be an open and evolutionary process conducted on
the basis of consensus by the heads of state and government.
</P>
<P>
"As an informal process, ASEM needs not be institutionalized. It
should stimulate and facilitate progress in other fora; go beyond
governments in order to promote dialogue and cooperation between
the business/private sectors of the two regions," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
At the summit, all leaders recognized the growing
interdependence of the economies and economic policies of the ASEM
countries and agreed on the importance of deepening dialogue and
cooperation between Asia and Europe.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the leaders looked forward to the early
implementation of the Investment Promotion Action Plan and of the
Trade Facilitation Action Plan, adopted at the ASEM, and asked
economic ministers of the ASEM countries to supervise the
implementation closely.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that it was essential in a highly integrated world
economy that all trading nations were members of the World Trade
Organization, and full participation in the WTO by ASEM partners
will strengthen the organization.
</P>
<P>
On the financial crisis in Asia, the leaders attached high
importance to remedying the financial and economic situation in
Asia and reaffirmed their commitment to working together to
address this global concern.
</P>
<P>
The leaders encouraged businesses to play an active part in the
restoration of economic confidence and growth in the affected
Asian countries, and to maintain and extend business investment
activities in both regions.
</P>
<P>
They also attached importance to the cooperation in the fields
of culture, science and technology in order to diversify further
Asian-European cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"Since science and technology has increasingly become the key
factor and chief engine for economic growth, and there is enormous
potential for mutually-beneficial cooperation between Asia and
Europe, leaders noted various follow-up activities in this field
and called for further efforts to strengthen technological
cooperation between Asia and Europe," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The leaders also agreed to expand Asian-European dialogue on
global political issues and general security issues, such as
environment, arms control, illegal drugs and money laundering, and
the welfare of women and children.
</P>
<P>
The first ASEM meeting was held in Bangkok, Thailand, in 1996,
and the next ASEM conference will be held in Seoul, South Korea,
in the year 2000.

SHENGYANG, Northeast China, April 4 (Xinhua) -- An all-star
squad comprised of foreign players beat their top Chinese rivals
83-80 in the All-Star Weekend for the Chinese professional
basketball league here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
American Ray Kelly scored a buzz-beating three-pointer,
completing his side's come-from-behind victory.

Trailing by 11 points at halftime, the league's foreign

</P>
<P>
The foreign stars then pulled away 67-58 on a 9-0 run which
witnessed two three-pointers, as many dunks and three steals.
</P>
<P>
Waking up from lethargy, the Chinese all-star squad clawed back
to 72-72 and surged ahead on a three-pointer by Ju Weisong from
Shangdong.
</P>
<P>
The foreign stars regained the lead with 38 seconds to go, but

<HEADLINE> Fashionable Clothing Gains Popularity in Lhasa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Tibetan youngsters are quietly
abandoning traditional dress and opting instead for fashionable
clothing.
</P>
<P>
Young Tibetan women greet the arrival of Spring by changing
their rather redundant winter clothing for colorful fashionable
dress.
</P>
<P>
One particular street in Lhasa is particularly well-known for
shops selling the latest fashions, with 100 boutiques changing
their window displays almost overnight during the transition from
one season to another. Spring collections from coastal areas such
as Guangzhou appear in the shops almost immediately.
</P>
<P>
Shopping for fashionable clothing has emerged as a new hobby
for an increasing number of young Tibetan women, with related
items representing a new flash point for consumption.
</P>
<P>
The popularity of fashionable clothing in Lhasa readily
indicates that Tibetans share the pursuit of beauty on the same
level as other nationalities, according to a Tibetan fashion
designer.
</P>
<P>
Most urban residents no longer have to worry about adequate
food and clothing, and can thus pay greater to their quality of
life and indeed fashionable clothing.
</P>
<P>
Gaizhoin, a clerk for a government department, wears
fashionable dresses during her leisure time. She said that dresses
add to pleasantness and spark a more lively aura in certain social
activities.
</P>
<P>
She said that some fashionable clothing items cost as much as
1,000 yuan, but quickly added the expense is worthwhile since they
make her appear more vigorous and impressive.
</P>
<P>
Foresighted businessmen have paid special attention to the
clothing market in Tibet, with many opening shops to sell the
latest fashions. Various name brand products have gained
increasing popularity in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
One boutique owner who opened a shop in Lhasa some five years
ago said he never imagined that styles of fashionable clothing
would change so fast. He cited the intense competition and noted
risk in operating boutiques is greater than purchasing shares on
the stock market.

<HEADLINE> Uganda: ADF Rebels Eat Captives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Rebels of the Allied Democratic
Forces (ADF)in Uganda have eaten captives, the daily New Vision
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Lieutenant Colonel Francis Okello, the
commanding officer of the 53rd Battalion of Uganda Army, as
saying that the ADF rebels have eaten an unspecified number of
abducted people and even one of their commanders who was unable
to move due to his illness.
</P>
<P>
But Okello did not give the name of the commander.
</P>
<P>
In a broadcast of Radio Tooro, Wycliff Mwesigwa, the
intelligence officer of the Second Division of Ugandan Army,
confirmed the cannibalism in Okello's briefing to the local
media.
</P>
<P>
Broadcasting from Radio Tooro covers the west of Uganda,
Rwanda and parts of Tanzania and the Democratic Republic of
Congo.
</P>
<P>
There are at least 50 local people still held by ADF rebels.
The captives are used by the rebels as laborers and human shields
in fightings.
</P>
<P>
ADF is a Uganda rebel group with hundreds of its remnants
active in western Uganda and eastern Congo. It had some 1,500
fighters in November 1996.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the Ugandan Army and the government troops of Congo
have launched a joint operation against ADF rebels in their
common border areas. The coordinated operations have forced the
rebels to retreat northward to Kivu Province of the Democratic
Congo, Okello said.

<HEADLINE> Belgians, Dutch Tie in Davis Cup Tourney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Filip Dewulf on Saturday gave the
hosts some hope of advancing to the quarter-finals of the world
group Davis Cup tennis tournament.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian ace did not drop a set en route to pulling the host
side back on equal footing with the visiting Dutch side with one
win each from the two opening singles.
</P>
<P>
Dewulf, ranked 54th on the ATP tour, overwhelmed Sjeng
Schalken, 60th, 7-5, 6-2, 7-5 in a little over two hours in their
opening singles match that was put off from Friday due to rain.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's match was also delayed by rain and play was
interfered by gusts of wind that affected the serves on both sides
of the court.
</P>
<P>
Yet a more determined Dewulf threw in all he got to make
Belgium one up on the scoreboard. The Belgian player turned out
more in control via placement shots that kept Schalken busy
returning shots from difficult angles in the second set.
</P>
<P>
Dewulf then came from 2-4 down in the third but almost
squandered three match points in his final serving game. He at
last pulled off the winner after grabbing an advantage ensuing the
deuce that he allowed too hastily.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Dewulf will pair off with Libor Pimek in the doubles
that is put off from Saturday, before meeting in the first of the
reverse singles Jan Siemerink who entertained hundreds of Dutch
followers on Friday by winning the first opening singles.
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old Dutch, ranked 29th on the ATP tour, routed
71st-ranked Johan van Herck 6-4, 6-3, 4-6, 6-1 in three hours.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands and Belgium met four times previously in the
Davis Cup, each winning two encounters. The Dutch whitewashed the
Belgians in their last Davis Cup tie in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Health Ministry Urges Prudent Use of Iodized Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 4 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Health issued
an order today banning the forced sales of specified iodized
products and foodstuffs, and urged consumers to exhibit prudence
when using related products.
</P>
<P>
"The Ministry of Health explicitly prohibits public health
departments, medical institutions and individuals from using
administrative economic means to compulsorily market iodized
products and foodstuffs to kindergartens, nor can they claim that
related products help eliminate diseases caused by iodine
deficiencies," according to a ministry official.
</P>
<P>
The official's remarks came in response to an outbreak of
health-threatening reactions suffered by people taking iodized
calcium nutrients sold in several counties in Shandong and Anhui
Provinces in east China and northeastern Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
The official urged consumers to protect their health by seeking
medical advice prior to their use of iodized nutrients.
</P>
<P>
China has drafted a plan to eliminate diseases associated with
iodine deficiences the year 2000, with the main measure for
attaining the goal centered on promoting the use of iodized salt.
</P>
<P>
However, the official reiterated that administrative and
economic means cannot be used to sell over-the-counter iodized
calcium nutrients and specified iodized foodstuffs to
kindergartens and schools, nor can related products be promoted in
any other manner. Instead, he said, products must be sold through
normal market channels.
</P>
<P>
"Units and individuals are strictly prohibited from marketing
related products in the sole pursuit of profit," according to
official.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the Ministry of Health issued an urgent notice
calling for public health departments nationwide to launch a
comprehensive examination of iodized foodstuffs and related
products sold as nutrients.

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The major news items in leading
U.S. newspapers Saturday:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- A veteran officer of the Central Intelligence Agency,
enraged by his dismissal, tried to extort 500,000 dollars from the
CIA in exchange for his loyalty and, when the agency would not buy
his silence, told two foreign nations how the United States spied
on them, officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton warned in unusually explicit terms Friday
that Japan must change course if it hopes to pull its economy out
of a long-running decline that has worsened markedly in recent
weeks. He made the warning when the Japanese yen fell to a
six-and-a-half year low against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
-- Buoyant in his first day back in the Oval Office after 12
days in Africa, President Clinton gathered his economic advisers
in the Rose Garden and lambasted the budget proposal Senate
Republicans pushed through on Thursday night. Clearly emboldened
by the dismissal of Paula Corbin Jones's sexual misconduct lawsuit
against him, the president vowed not to be distracted by such
matters.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- In a series of public statements in recent days, House
Speaker Newt Gingrich has said Republican congressional leaders
are taking a deliberate and cautious approach to the possibility
that they would receive a report from independent counsel Kenneth
W. Starr.
</P>
<P>
-- In a report certain to exacerbate the badly strained
relations between the United Nations and Congress, the U.N. Human
Rights Commission has concluded that the United States applies the
death penalty unfairly and called for a moratorium on further
executions.
</P>
<P>
-- A year after the government began implementing it, a
controversial provision of immigration law is under attack from
human rights groups that charge the measure may be sending
refugees back to terrible fates in their homelands. However, the
Immigration and Naturalization Service maintains that there is no
evidence of that.

Shangdong.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Diplomats Leave Baghdad After Inspection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Twenty senior diplomats of the
United Nations' special group responsible for accompanying arms
inspectors to eight Iraqi presidential sites left here Saturday
afternoon after an eight-day, first round of inspections.
</P>
<P>
Janayatha Dhanapala, head of the special group, told reporters
before departure that he was happy about the outcome of his
mission, and he would submit a final report on the results of the
mission to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The 20 senior diplomats of different countries had accompanied
arms experts from the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) on
dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction in searching Iraqi
presidential sites since March 26.
</P>
<P>
The mission was completed Thursday night. According to
diplomatic sources, they found no prohibited weapons in those
sites.
</P>
<P>
The eight presidential sites were at the center of an arms
inspection crisis between Iraq and the U.N. which was defused
after Annan and Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz signed an
agreement on February 23.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord, Iraq agreed to open its eight presidential
palaces to inspections in which arms experts should be accompanied
by a multinational group of 20 diplomats whenever they visit the
presidential complexes.

<HEADLINE> Families Essential for Social Security in China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Families remain as an essential
basis for social security in China, and their functions for
nurturing the young and caring for the elderly, disabled and
infirmed cannot be entirely replaced by the social welfare,
according to Chinese sociologists.
</P>
<P>
In his address to the '98 Beijing International Conference on
Family, Social Security and Social Welfare which opened today in
the Chinese capital, Lu Xueyi, director of the Institute of
Sociology at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, noted that it
would be extremely difficult for the State to replace the care and
support provided by families, However, he did note the existence
of complementary functions between families and society in terms
of social security.
</P>
<P>
Lu explained that penetration of the welfare state into
families requires significant increase in funding, and
acknowledged that only advanced economies can afford such a high
costs.
</P>
<P>
"State and societal penetration in family functions such as
care and support have primly met the physical needs of people,"
said Lu, adding that "care and support nurtures frequent
interaction between family members and is irreplaceable in terms
of communications and emotional well-being."
</P>
<P>
The prestigious sociologist also noted that the existence
attachments and morality ensure that family support and care are
voluntary actions free of the need for external intervention, and
therefore guarantee efficiency and require no additional external
management costs.
</P>
<P>
Many countries have, in fact, been deliberating welfare
policies and introduced programs to downsize their welfare systems
since the end of the 1970's. The State-family relationship has
indeed been on the cutting edge of change. State responsibilities
for families are gradually being shifted to the families
themselves in order to relieve heavy financial pressures.

<P>
Experts participating in the conference also pointed out that
current social phenomena, such as changing value concepts, aging
populations and the rising divorce rate, as well as both
unemployment and layoffs have challenged traditional Chinese
family functions centering on care and support.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yiyun, a research fellow with the Institute of Sociology
at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, noted that most
families continue to provide security for family members,
particularly in terms of providing emotional support and ensuring
the material well-being of children.
</P>
<P>
Most families continue to care for and protecting their
dependent members, as well as the elderly, disabled and infirmed,
said Chen. She also pointied out that this has been the major
factor prompting the Chinese government and various NGOs to attach
great importance to building civilized families, or families with
improved social ethical and cultural progress. Moreover, she
added, related activities have been one of the primary tasks of
social development in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that healthy and stable families are prerequisites
for social stability.
</P>
<P>
The three-day conference is sponsored by the Institute of
Sociology at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the Chinese
Association of Family Culture Studies and the Jinglun Family
Center.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 scholars and experts from 13 countries and
regions are expected to discuss methods for improving the social
security system in the course of modernization, industrialization
and urbanization, as well as the potential of families to offer
resources and assume responsibility for improving social
security.

<HEADLINE> Shake-up of S. African Intelligence Structures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 4 (Xinhua) -- A major shake-up of South
African Military Intelligence (MI) and an examination of its role
and that of police intelligence are predicted after an MI report
was proved flawed, Saturday Star reported.
</P>
<P>
The MI report, which was handed directly to President Nelson
Mandela by South African National Defense Force (SANDF) chief
general Georg Meiring on February 5, claimed that senior African
National Congress (ANC) officials were plotting a coup against
the government.
</P>
<P>
Named in the report were Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, president
of the ANC Women's League and ex-wife of Mandela; former ANC
official and now co-leader of the United Democratic Movement
Bantu Holomisa, Meiring's heir-apparent; SANDF Chief of Staff
Siphiwe Nyanda and Robert McBride, a Foreign Ministry official
who was detained last month in Mozambique for alleged arms
smuggling.
</P>
<P>
The judicial commission of inquiry appointed by Mandela last
week found that the process of compiling the report was so flawed
that it was impossible to take its allegations seriously.
</P>
<P>
Doubts have now been cast on the military intelligence's
credibility and its future is in question, said Saturday Star.
</P>
<P>
Mandela is continuing consultations with key cabinet ministers
on the next course of action and the findings of the commission.
</P>
<P>
He will brief leaders of the opposition parties early next
week on the findings of the commission.
</P>
<P>
Military intelligence had breached the laws governing
intelligence operations in South Africa, the paper quoted sources
within the security establishment as saying.
</P>
<P>
The National Strategic Intelligence Act of 1994 prohibits MI
from covertly collecting domestic military intelligence or
foreign non-military intelligence -- something which was done to
compile the report.
</P>
<P>
The controversial report has also cast doubt on the
circumstances around the arrest of McBride.
</P>
<P>
The report did not follow accepted procedure. It should have
gone through the National Intelligence Coordinating Committee
(NICOC) and the Ministry of Defense before it reached the
president.
</P>
<P>
Meiring explained in a statement earlier this week that he
breached the procedure because the information was sensitive and
could not be treated in the normal way.
</P>
<P>
But he failed to explain why NICOC knew nothing about the
decision to gather information on McBride. The surveillance had
been conducted from 1995.
</P>
<P>
Until about two months ago, MI head Dirk Verbeek sat on NICOC
as chief of intelligence of the SANDF, and before Meiring
received the information, Verbeek, as head of MI, would have
received it. This was confirmed by Meiring's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Meiring's statement also failed to explain how the report was
leaked to media shortly after McBride's arrest in Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
He failed to explain why SANDF generals were said to be
planning to meet with Suiker Britz, the man responsible for
investigation of illegal weapons possession in the South African
Police Service's Special Investigation Unit.
</P>
<P>
Britz, who did not meet McBride in Mozambique during his
information-gathering trip to that country, said later that there
was enough evidence to convict McBride of arms smuggling.
</P>
<P>
Britz confirmed that he was approached by an SANDF general who
wanted urgently to meet him to discuss the McBride case. The
SANDF said it was working with the police.
</P>
<P>
Mandela was suspicious of the report from the outset because
it implicated trusted members of his government in an alleged
coup based on information from one single source -- Vusi Madida,
also known as Vusi Mbatha, a self-confessed informer for the
former security forces.
</P>
<P>
Mandela was forced to go public with his concerns and appoint
a judicial commission of inquiry last Friday when the report was
leaked to the press and used to fuel rumors that McBride was
guilty of gun-running.
</P>
<P>
Madida, the sole source of information in the MI report, has
also been arrested along with McBride. Madida was reported last
week as having told Mozambican police that he and McBride planned
to send arms to Fretilin guerrillas fighting for East Timor's
independence from Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Intelligence sources said that both Madida and Alex Mamba, who
Madida named in his statement to the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission as a weapons smuggler with whom he had contact, worked
for police intelligence and MI. Mamba is believed to have tipped
off the Mozambican and South African police that McBride had
walked into the trap set for him last month.
</P>
<P>
The South African government said it believed that with the
1999 general election drawing near, it was possible that elements
dissatisfied with the current government would try to launch a
disinformation campaign to destabilize the country.

<HEADLINE> Beijingers Join Effort to Plant Trees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Communist Party and State leaders
and some two million Beijing residents and members of the People's
Liberation Army participated in today's annual tree-planting
activities held throughout the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
Related activities attracted people from all walks of life,
including officials, members of the PLA and armed police,
government employees, workers, farmers and students.
</P>
<P>
In 1985, the Beijing Municipal People's Congress designated the
first Sunday of April each year as a voluntary day for planting
trees, with related efforts over 14 years helping to increase
general public awareness of the importance of afforestation,
ecology and the environment.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that the forest rate coverage for the
Chinese capital reached 38.26 percent by the end of 1997, with
landscaped areas covering 33.4 percent of the total urban
area. Both rates represent considerably increases in figures for
only a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
As part of an ongoing landscaping and beautification program,
the municipal government has pledged to raise the city's forest
cover rate coverage to 40 percent by the end of this year, a level
which will be achieved one year ahead of the official
schedule. Reaching the objective will require that Beijing
residents plant an average of 3-5 trees each during the year.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary statistics indicated that a total of 1.5 million
trees were planted during today's activities, with participants
also cleaning landscaped areas covering some four million square
meters.
</P>
<P>
In addition, more than 200 Chinese and foreign students
attending the Beijing Language and Culture University (BLCU)
gathered in the institution's new International Garden to plant a
tree representing peace and friendship.
</P>
<P>
More than 40,000 students from 162 countries and regions have
attended the BLCU, the country's leading center for training
teachers of the Chinese as a Foreign Language.
</P>
<P>
The BLCU, founded in 1962, was known the Beijing Language
Institute until 1996.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong, a leading world
financial and trading center, has been playing an active role in
the protection of intellectual property rights, a local government
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Customs and Excise Training School, Secretary
for Trade and Industry of the government of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) Chau Tak-hay underlined the need to
"maintain Hong Kong's integrity as an international financial and
trading center."
</P>
<P>
He said the Customs and Excise Department of the Hong Kong SAR
government has been doing well in "suppressing piracy activities
at all levels, from import to manufacture and from storage to
distribution."
</P>
<P>
The department has been highly regarded both locally and
internationally by law enforcement agencies as well as trademark
and copyright owners in the fight against copyright infringement
and counterfeiting, Chau said.
</P>
<P>
Apart from protecting intellectual property rights, he added,
the department has been doing very well in protecting revenue from
dutiable goods, in dealing with illegal traffic of narcotics and
other contraband, in safeguarding the credibility of Hong Kong's
export licensing and origin certification systems and in enforcing
copyright and trade descriptions legislation.
</P>
<P>
The secretary expressed the hope that the department upholds
this fine reputation and continues to play an important role in
the protection of intellectual property rights.
</P>
<P>
He also told the probationary inspectors and probationary
customs officers at the school the need for them to know more
about every aspects of "our country," noting that local residents
had been living in a society and cultural environment very
different from that of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
"For everyone of us there is a need to know more about every
aspects of our country -- her culture, history, geography and even
 the way of life and thinking of our mainland compatriots," Chau
said, adding: "All of us need to increase our sense of national
identity so that we may be better equipped to implement faithfully
the policy of 'One Country, Two Systems'."

MANILA, April 4 (Xinhua) -- President Fidel Ramos Saturday
placed under a state of calamity all provinces, cities and towns
with at least 25 hectares affected by forest fires due to the El
Nino weather disturbance.
</P>
<P>
"All provinces and cities/towns suffering from forest fires
covering an area of 25 hectares or more are hereby declared
calamity areas," Ramos said in a memorandum to Defense Secretary
Fortunato Abat.
</P>
<P>
Ramos ordered all affected local government units to utilize
local government funds and personnel, equipment as well as
volunteers to put out such fires.
</P>
<P>
He chided local officials for their failure to initiate
effective preventive measures to control the spread of forest
fires which have reportedly destroyed at least 2,000 hectares of
forest during the recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
Ramos earlier released a total of 10 million pesos from the
Calamity Fund to contain the forest fires in Palawan province, an
island in the southern Philippines, and in other areas in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Aside from Palawan, forest fires have also affected more than
4,000 hectares of virgin forest in the provinces of Benguet,

fires.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian Government Urges Prince to Cut Ties with Khmer Rouge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian government reaffirmed
its stance Friday that Prince Norodom Ranariddh must stop his
military cooperation with outlawed Khmer Rouge.
</P>
<P>
A memorandum released by government also asked Ranariddh to
order his troop to stop fighting against the government forces
before he can be allowed to take part in the election.
</P>
<P>
"Price Ranariddh indeed maintained an unholy alliance with the
Khmer Rouge that was indeed brought into the cities to be used as
the backbones of the military coup in July 1997 to eliminate his
rival ahead of the general election scheduled for 1998," said the
memorandum.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, "Failure of Prince Ranariddh to publicly
disassociate himself from the Khmer Rouge will not liberate him
from being a political hostage of the Khmer Rouge."
</P>
<P>
"He must also prove that his order to ceasefire has been
carried out by his troops. If not, he must disassociate himself
from them and declare them outlawed. Failing to do that will deny
him and his party the rights to run in the election according to
political party law," said the memorandum.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum also said that "the royal pardon was granted
only to Prince Ranariddh" and could not be used
for his convicted generals because it is not part of the Japanese
peace plan.
</P>
<P>
Before departing for Bangkok on Friday, Ranariddh expressed his
hope that his generals should also be pardoned.
</P>
<P>
"I never abandon anybody and I think my generals are
reasonable, I hope that royal pardon will be granted to them under
the Japanese peace mediation and under U.N. facilitation to those
two generals," Ranariddh said.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh ended his first five-day home trip to Cambodia on
Friday under full protection provided by the government, the
United Nations organization and other foreign institutions.
</P>
<P>
He was pardoned by his father King Norodom Sihanouk on March 21
after he was sentenced to 35 years in prison on March 4 and 18 by the
Cambodian Military Court.

<HEADLINE> 2 Sentenced to Death in Iranian Killing Case in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 4 (Xinhua) -- An anti-terrorist court in
Pakistan Saturday awarded death sentence to two man for the last
year killing of five Iranian cadets in Rawalpindi, sister city of
the federal capital.
</P>
<P>
The court, however, acquitted a co-accused of the murder
charges and reserved its judgment on the fate of three absconders.
</P>
<P>
Those who were awarded death sentence included Muhammad Asif
and Muhammad Yaqub, while Qari Muhammad Siddique was acquitted.
All the accused were present when the judgment was announced.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian cadets along with their Pakistani driver were
gunned down in Rawalpindi, about 20 km south of the capital, on
September 17 last year. The Pakistani law enforcement agencies
arrested six men and charged them with murder.
</P>
<P>
The local administration made strict security arrangements
around the jail on the occasion. No one, including journalists,
were allowed to enter the jail.
</P>
<P>
In order to curb the rising sectarian violence in the country,
the Pakistani government led by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
introduced an anti-terrorism law shortly after it came to power
early last year.

<HEADLINE> Saudis Beef up Disaster Prevention During Hajj </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The Saudi government has been
beefing up disaster-prevention measures as 2 million Muslim across
the world are heading for Mecca and packing the holy sites to pay
their homage to the Prophet.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from Mecca, this year's hajj is marked by
huge efforts by the authorities to try to avoid a repeat of
previous disasters, which had caused heavy loss of lives.
</P>
<P>
Intricate preparations have been undertaken throughout the year
for the world's biggest gathering of the Muslims and "all
necessary facilities were set" for the hajj, which starts on April
6.
</P>
<P>
The reports said a total of 10,800 fire-resistant tents have
been fitted with 42,000 water sprinklers in a bid to avoid the
1997 blaze during the pilgrimage, which was caused by a cooking
gas cylinder in a camp on the Mina plain, south of Mecca, killed 343
pilgrims and injured many others.
</P>
<P>
Those tents provided this year cover 25 percent of the targeted
area in Mina and is the first phase of a plan to set up all the
tents of the same kind to house 2 million pilgrims every year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Saudi authorities said they would encourage the
pilgrims to buy fast food and would punish those who insisted on
cooking meals in the camp area.
</P>
<P>
Some 600 roaming trucks would sell more than a million fast
food meals, Saudi Undersecretary of State of the Commerce Ministry
Mohammed Hassen Qareb was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Other precautions included underground storage of 100,000 cubic
meters of water for the pilgrims.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Interior Minister Prince Nayef Bin Abdel-Aziz, also
chairman of the Supreme Hajj Committee, inspected the facilities
at Hajj sites of Mecca, Mina, Arafat and Muzdalifa as well as the
security arrangements recently and said "Saudi Arabia has made all
arrangements for the welfare and security of pilgrims."
</P>
<P>
The pilgrimage to Mecca, the birthplace of Prophet Mohammad, is
the largest annual event in the kingdom. According to Islamic
teachings, every Muslim should try to make the pilgrimage at least
once in a lifetime.

<HEADLINE> S. African Property Companies Explore Overseas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 4 (Xinhua) -- South African major real
estate companies have substantially increased their service to
locals intent on relocating or investing in property overseas,
newspaper Saturday Star reported.
</P>
<P>
Seeff Residential Properties, one of the leading real estate
companies in South Africa, was quoted as saying that it had
entered into a joint venture with Ray White Real Estate of
Australia to market Australian residential and commercial
properties in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Australia has always been a popular relocation destination for
the South Africans, Andrew Smith, managing director of Seeff
Residential Properties said.
</P>
<P>
"Uprooting and re-establishing a family in a new country is
never easy. Seeff's aim with the new joint venture is to take the
bumps out of this well-traveled road," he said.
</P>
<P>
Smith believed that the recent easing of foreign exchange
controls has globalized the South African property market and it
is now essential for top property firms to diversify
internationally.
</P>
<P>
The recent Property Expo at Midrand, a city between
Johannesburg and Pretoria, reflected this growing interest in the
overseas market.

<HEADLINE> Another 1,000 Iraqi POWs Back from Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Another batch of about 1,000 Iraqi
prisoners of war (POWs) released by Iran have returned to their
homeland, the Iraqi News Agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The agency said Iraq again set free 50 Iranians captured during
their eight-year war from 1980-88 in the latest POW exchange, a
decade after the fightings ended.
</P>
<P>
A swap ceremony, the second in three days, was held Friday
evening at the border city of al-Mundhariya under the supervision
of the Red Cross Society. The first batch of 800 Iraqi POWs
released by Iran arrived home Thursday evening; and on the same
day Iraq freed 62 Iranian POWs.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted Iraqi Foreign Under-Secretary Riyadh al-Qaisi
as saying that more POWs will be released in the coming days under
a scheduled program agreed on by the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's al-Zawra weekly on Thursday reported that Iran will set
free 6,000 Iraqi POWs in the biggest such release since 1990.
</P>
<P>
Iraq said Iran still holds up to 20,000 Iraqis as POWs after
39,000 were released in 1990, an accusation Iran often denied.
Iran says Iraq keeps 6,000 to 10,000 Iranian prisoners, though
Iraq declared that it does not have any.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts here believe the repatriation of POWs will
help remove the obstacles that have been preventing the two
neighbors from resuming diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
During their bloody war in the 1980s, an estimated 1 million
Iranian and Iraqis were killed or wounded.

<HEADLINE> S. African Property Companies Explore Overseas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 4 (Xinhua) -- South African major real
estate companies have substantially increased their service to
locals intent on relocating or investing in property overseas,
newspaper Saturday Star reported.
</P>
<P>
Seeff Residential Properties, one of the leading real estate
companies in South Africa, was quoted as saying that it had
entered into a joint venture with Ray White Real Estate of
Australia to market Australian residential and commercial
properties in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Australia has always been a popular relocation destination for
the South Africans, Andrew Smith, managing director of Seeff
Residential Properties said.
</P>
<P>
"Uprooting and re-establishing a family in a new country is
never easy. Seeff's aim with the new joint venture is to take the
bumps out of this well-traveled road," he said.
</P>
<P>
Smith believed that the recent easing of foreign exchange
controls has globalized the South African property market and it
is now essential for top property firms to diversify
internationally.
</P>
<P>
The recent Property Expo at Midrand, a city between
Johannesburg and Pretoria, reflected this growing interest in the
overseas market.
</P>
<P>
At the exhibition, the Sovereign Surfers Paradise Hotel on
Australia's Gold Coast canvassed South African investment in two
new hotel apartment suite developments, and the stand attracted a
lot of attention.
</P>
<P>
According to local real estate companies, South Africans also

International reported that it had been inundated with requests
from hundreds of serious buyers for a foothold in the British
property market.
</P>
<P>
"We have been mandated by 110 potential investors to secure
suitable properties. The main reason for their interest in London
is to have an overseas rand hedge.
</P>
<P>
Property in London, which has been an exceptional recovery in
recent months, currently offers one of the best investment
opportunities given its 10 percent rise forecast for the year to
June 1998, property experts said.

MOSCOW, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev has
decreed to cut the government positions by ten to improve
efficiency of the government work, the Interfax news agency
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In a dispatch from Bishkek, capital of Kyrgyzstan, the Russian
news agency said that the positions of deputy prime ministers
in charge of agriculture, finance and social programs have been
scrapped.
</P>
<P>
The president also abolished the Ministry for Cooperation with

Only one deputy prime minister position has been retained in
the reshuffle and Kyrgyzstan's representative to the four-nation
Integration Committee and the Customs Union will be given the rank
of a deputy premier, the report said.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 4 (Xinhua) -- To meet the growing demand for
energy, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has
decided to explore the use of nuclear power, the Philippine News
Agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Nuclear experts in the region will meet within the next three
months to study how the grouping can work together to ensure
nuclear safety and manage nuclear waste in Southeast Asia, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The decision, made by the ASEAN Committee on Science and
Technology (COST) during a meeting ending here Friday, came in
response to the projected energy demands of continued development
in the region.
</P>
<P>
The committee also decided that a fresh approach was called for
if cooperation among members in the field of science and
technology was to be boosted.
</P>
<P>
The committee considered commercializing some of its more
successful projects, such as the ASEAN Science and Technology
Information Network which consists of data bases of interest to
researchers, development planners, policy makers and
entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
This move is part of the concerted effort that ASEAN has been
making to involve the private sector in its schemes and programs.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN says its science and technology programs are aimed at
beefing up the region's industrial competitiveness.

<HEADLINE> Male Kindergarten Teachers Play Important Role (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ten years ago, Pan began to adopt such teaching methods as
imitation, consciousness and thought-provocation. He also started
courses in boxing, shooting, fencing and wrestling to improve the
students' courage through reasonable and rational pushing and
shoving.
</P>
<P>
"I don't expect my kid to be an excellent artist or a
first-class scientist," said one parent, an employee with China
Eastern Airlines. "But I hope he becomes a man with a strong will
and good habits."
</P>
<P>
Feng Lirong, president of the Soong Ching Ling Kindergarten
where Pan works, said: "The teaching methods adopted by Pan are
better compared with the traditional ones in that it make kids
more quick-witted, courageous and more capable of protecting
themselves."
</P>
<P>
Last year the school employed another male kindergarten
teacher, a graduate of Shanghai Jiaotong University. The new
teacher monitors science courses and is also very popular.
</P>
<P>
Male teachers encounter great difficulties from society because
taking care of children is traditionally regarded as "inferior
work" in China and only done by females.
</P>
<P>
Pan, 31, said he has courted women several times, and each time
was rebuffed because of his "inferior occupation."
</P>
<P>
"I have confidence and I will convince the public with my
achievements that a male teacher can build his career in
kindergarten," Pan said.
</P>
<P>
This autumn, Pan will tour Canada as a visiting scholar and
lecturer on his teaching methods.

<HEADLINE> Male Kindergarten Teachers Play Important Role (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Wearing earphones and seated in
stark darkness, a group of urban kids listen attentively to the
sounds of nature -- deafening thunder and the howl of wild
animals. Their teacher believes this will help improve the
children's courage.
</P>
<P>
Pan Haohan, employed 10 years ago as the city's first male
kindergarten teacher, aims to transform the timid kids into
persistent and dauntless citizens adaptable to an increasingly
competitive society.
</P>
<P>
The 40 male kindergarten teachers in Shanghai are particularly
conspicuous among the city's 20,000 female kindergarten teachers
for their different thoughts toward pre-school education.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey covering 204 administrators and teachers of
kindergarteners and 284 parents shows that 76 percent of them
believe that male teachers will be popular among the children and
62 percent of them agree that male teachers would be more
effective in improving the students' creativity and personalities.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai-based Wenhui Daily has recently begun a write-in
column encouraging readers to comment on whether the hiring of
male teachers indicates that children need masculine guidance in
kindergarten.
</P>
<P>
Feng Yuwei, director of the Shanghai Teachers Training Center,
said that the participation of male teachers in kindergarten is
necessary, but the success of pre-school education does not depend
solely on the gender of the teacher. The psychological quality,
teaching methods and educational objectives also are important, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that China's adoption of the one-child
policy in the late 1970s has unexpectedly created an unfavorable
circumstance for the healthy growth of children because of the
lack of sibling competition in the one-child families.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a large number of Chinese teachers, especially
female teachers, have habitually treated bold and aggressive kids
as "bad kids" and regard obedient kids as model ones, which has
also had a negative impact on the competitive nature of
children.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Population Heads for Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan experts predict that
Kenya's population growth rate is set to sharply decline and its
population is expected to be stabilized as the country moves
toward the final stage of the population transition period.
</P>
<P>
Murugaru Kimani, Lecturer at the Nairobi University's
Institute of Population, said that the theory of demographic
transition has three stages, according to a Daily Nation report
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He said that the early stage of a country's development is
characterized by high rates of both birth and death and most of
African countries is at the stage.
</P>
<P>
During the middle stage, the death rate declines but birth
rate remains high, said the lecturer, adding that Kenya has moved
from the early stage and now is in the middle stage.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the final stage of the transition has low death
and birth rates and Kenya is heading for the final stage.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Kenya started experiencing a fertility decline in
the late 1980s, he pointed out that fertility rates fell from 3.8
percent in 1979 to 3.3 percent in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Although Kenya's population is expected to rise from the
present 28.8 million to 36 million by 2025, experts believe that
the population will eventually reach stabilization stage where
the number of births will roughly harmonize with the number of
deaths.
</P>
<P>
Some experts argue that the decline in population growth rate
can be speeded up through the introduction of contraceptives and
sex education in schools.
</P>
<P>
In Kenya, some 33 percent of married women use all manners of
contraceptives and the figure is set to rise, according to the
1997 World Population Data Sheet.

<HEADLINE> Russian Pair Takes Ice Dancing World Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Russian pair Anjelika Krylova
and Oleg Ovsyannikov clinched the ice dancing title at the World
Figure Skating Championships in Minnesota on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Russian pair, showing their unbeaten streak from very
beginning, dominated the rest of field in all four sessions,
including compulsory dance, second compulsoy dance, original dance
and free dance.
</P>
<P>
The pair won three silvers at 1996 and 1997 World Figure
Skating Championships and the 1998 Nagano Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
"It was a bit hard to skate today because it was the end of a
long and tiring season," said Ovsyannikov after the competition.
"We had many competitions, however, I am very happy about how we
skated here and how the audience appreciated our perfomance."
</P>
<P>
Marina Anissina and Gwendal Perizerat of France took the second
place and the bronze medal went to Canada's Shae-Lynn Bourne and
Victor Kraatz.
</P>
<P>
The two pairs, also competed in the first rank throughout the
four programs, presented sweet dances to the American
skating-lovers.
</P>
<P>
The French pair, 1998 Olympics bronze medalists, were satisfied
with their presentation.
</P>
<P>
"This is by far the best program we have skated," said Peizerat
after the competition. "Our technique was perfect. With each step
you could feel love between Romeo and Juliet."
</P>
<P>
Anissina, who began skating together with Peiserat in 1993,
said, "I am so proud that the crowd reacted so well to the
program."
</P>
<P>
The Canadians, who finished third in the last two World
Championships and placed fourth at the 1998 Olympics, also
expressed their happiness with their result.
</P>
<P>
"That's the best we have ever skated the free dance. That's a
great way to end the season, skating in Minneapolis in front of
such a great crowd," Bourne said.
</P>
<P>
The crowd, including a quite big number of Canadians, responded
warmly to the ice-dancers.
</P>
<P>
"I think right after the Olympics we got all the frustration
out of us," added Kraatz.

<HEADLINE> Russian Duma Puts Off Vote on Premier Minister Nomination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The Russian State Duma (the lower
house of parliament) Friday postponed a vote on President Boris
Yeltsin's prime minister nomination after receiving a letter from
him.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Yeltsin withdrew his March 27 demand for a Duma
vote on the nomination, but asked again for its approval of the
prime ministership for 35-year-old Sergei Kiriyenko.
</P>
<P>
The move, a legal formality allowing the Duma one more week to
consider the candidacy, was taken "for the sake of preserving
political stability and public accord," Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin initially threatened to dismiss the Duma unless it
approved the nomination. But his conduct was strongly opposed by
his legislative opponents, who were enraged by his nominating
Kiriyenko without consulting them.
</P>
<P>
To avert a looming showdown, Yeltsin held a meeting with
legislative leaders on Thursday, and agreed to hold a broad
discussion with them on the formation of a new government.
</P>
<P>
The Itar-Tass news agency said Chairman of the State Duma
Gennady Seleznev had announced the Duma would study the nomination
in the following week.

<P>
LUANDA, April 4 (Xinhua) --wXYpZrent of the National Union
for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) Jonas Savimbi pledged
Friday in Bailundo to complete the peace process as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
In his Bailundo headquarters, Savimbi told the visiting U.S.
presidential envoy Paul Hare that UNITA will soon finish the
remaining tasks stipulated in the Lusaka Peace Accord.
</P>
<P>
Returning to Luanda, Hare disclosed UNITA's plan to the press
at the airport. He said that Savimbi expressed his hope that all
problems hindering the peace process could be resolved as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
Hare added that the UNITA leader assured him that in all areas
controlled by UNITA except Bailundo and Andulo, the
reestablishm_@orities will begin on April 6.
</P>
<P>
He said that he was satisfied with the recent developments in
the Angolan peace process, particularly, with some UNITA leaders
moving to the capital city and its radio shut down.
</P>
<P>
However, Hare said that there are still some hurdles on the
way to full peace. He called on the Angolan government and UNITA
to carry out the demilitarization of remaining rebel fighters and
the reestablishment of state authorities in all areas controlled
by the opposition movement.
</P>
<P>
The United States is one of the observers monitoring the
Angolan peace process.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador to Luanda Donald Steinberg who accompanied
Hare also congratulated on the big step forward toward peace in
Angola.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the relocation of UNITA headquarters to Luanda,
Government spokesman in the Joint Committee for Peace Process
Higino Carneiro said Friday that what his government cared about
is the relocation of UNITA leadership to the capital city while
Savimbi can live where he likes to, but he should abide by the
law.
</P>
<P>
As for the bloodsheds resulting in violation of the Lusaka
Peace Accord by the remaining rebel soldiers, Carneiro said that
since UNITA had declared demilitarization, the intervention of
the Angolan armed forces and the national police was legitimate.
</P>
<P>
The government was just fighting against the outlaws, he
added.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Former President's House Declared Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's former president Kenneth
Kaunda's house has been declared a prison with immediate effect,
government-controlled Zambia Daily Mail reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
This move is in accordance with a statutory instrument signed
by home affairs minister Peter Machungwa in the government
gazette published on April 1, said the Daily.
</P>
<P>
It quoted Machungwa, who confirmed the declaration of Kaunda's
Kalundu house in Lusaka as a prison, as saying Friday that Kaunda
who is under house arrest is no longer a detainee but a remandee
that needed to be kept in prison.
</P>
<P>
"Under the laws of Zambia, all persons charged with criminal
offences are supposed to be kept in prison and to that effect we
have declared Kalundu house, where Dr. Kaunda is restricted, as a
prison," said the home minister.
</P>
<P>
The statutory instrument empowers the commissioner of prisons
to be in control of the Kalundu house and also vests powers in
the officer-in-charge to allow visitors twice a week or in
special circumstances allow further visits at his discretion.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda, also opposition leader, was detained last December for
alleged involvement in Zambia's foiled military coup last
October. Later under the pressure from international community,
he was shifted from prison to his Kalundu house under house
arrest.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda was formally charged with concealment of treason one
month ago but the trial is supposed to be a marathonic one.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Yen's Dive Prompts Panic in Asian Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Asian currencies, including the
Thai baht, and the region's stock markets took a dive during the
week amid warnings that Japan's economy is on the brink of
disaster.
</P>
<P>
The bearish scenario was compounded by U.S. rating agency
Moody's investors service's announcement on Thursday that it had
lowered Japan's country ceiling and currency ratings to negative
from stable, driving the yen to 135.20 to the dollar, its worst
level since August 1991.
</P>
<P>
The announcement also sent Japan's key stock market Nikkei
Average down a further 185.12 points to end at 15,517.78 after the
previous day's plunge of 3.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Moody's said it changed its outlook for Japan's economy because
of the inability of Japanese leaders to hammer out policies to get
the world's second-largest economy out of a seven-year economic
downturn and the country's worsening fiscal situation.
</P>
<P>
Norio Ohga, chairman of Japanese electronic giant Sony, added
to the fuel, predicting at a briefing earlier that the Japanese
economy is on the brink of collapse and at risk of a long spiral
of deflation.
</P>
<P>
Ohga's comments followed a jolt from a central bank survey
released hours earlier showing confidence among Japanese companies
plunged in late March.
</P>
<P>
Amid worries that a tumbling yen and a sinking Japanese economy
would worsen the regional economic turmoil, most regional
currencies, which had been tracking the embattled yen the whole
week, dipped further and breached psychological levels.
</P>
<P>
The Thai baht fell to 41.30 against the dollar from Thursday's
Asian trading close of 40.99 -- reversing the gains of the past
few weeks.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian ringgit dropped to 3.7900 from 3.7400, the
Singapore dollar weakened to 1.6330 from 1.6275, and the
Indonesian rupiah to 8,550 to 8,500.
</P>
<P>
Most stock markets in the region also plummeted on concern over
economic reform in Japan and a weakening in regional currencies.
Thai share prices dived 2.4 percent in thin trade on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong share prices fell 1.2 percent lower in pre-holiday
trading Thursday, while Singapore's stock prices ended 1.1 percent
lower.
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursday, Malaysia's key stock index closed 2.6 percent
lower, and share prices plunged 4.2 percent on the Korea Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
"Basically Japan is being exposed as something of a disaster
area as opposed to the engine of economic growth it once was," a
Siam Sanwa Securities analyst in Bangkok said.
</P>
<P>
"It is obvious that something bad is happening in Japan, so
there is going to be a serious spillover effect here, particularly
with the exposure of Japanese banks in Thailand and the region.
This could lead to a real crisis," said a Seamico Securities
analyst in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
The only positive news on Thursday was that Indonesian shares
rose 3.3 percent amid news reports that the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) and the Indonesian government will be able to reach an
agreement by next week on the country's economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
IMF officials, however, said that some work still needed to be
done on Indonesia's 74-billion-dollar private debt.
</P>
<P>
Despite the chaos caused by the gloomy prospects of the
Japanese economy, Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, who
was in London for the second Asia-Europe summit, promised to take
action.
</P>
<P>
"Japan will take the necessary economic measures and, at the
same time, provide assistance to the countries of Asia as well,"
he reportedly said.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The domestic air services would be
given entirely to the private sector while the national Biman
Bangladesh Airlines will concentrate mainly on regional and
international routes, the Independent newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by Civil Aviation and Tourism Minister
Mosharraf Hossain while on a recent visit to a private airline in
Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
The issue of allowing private sector airlines to operate on
regional routes "may be considered later on", the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Biman incurs a loss of 200 million taka (about
4.35 million U.S. dollars) annually on its domestic routes.
</P>
<P>
"The loss is recovered from the income of its international
wing," he said, adding that Biman "will raise fare on its domestic
route from May next."
</P>
<P>
The government encouraged the private sector to come forward,
taking advantage of the atmosphere created for this purpose, he
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The Kuala Lumpur Stock
Exchange closed the week on a lower note due to concern over
corporate failures and impending problems in the financial sector.
</P>
<P>
At the close of this week's trading, the 100-quality stocks
Composite Index plunged 61.14 points to 666.48 from last week's
close, the all-share Emas Index fell 14.44 points to 169.65, the
Industrial Index was 88.12 points lower at 1,217.99 while the
Second Board Index lost 15.29 points to 166.42.
</P>
<P>
The CI touched its highest intraday level of 728.29 early
Monday morning before closing the week at its lowest level.
</P>
<P>
The market succumbed to selling pressure except for slight
bargain-hunting on Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
The announcement of construction and engineering-based Wembley
Industries being placed under receivership by PhileoAllied Bank
following its failure to repay loans raised concern of other
corporate failures should banks turn aggressive in demanding
repayments, a dealer said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the widely-anticipated merger announcement of
finance companies with the deadline on March 31 was discounted by
the market while poor corporate results failed to lift sentiment,
the dealer said.
</P>
<P>
Finance counters were also suppressed towards the week's end by
reports that 30 percent of the 100,000 finance companies staff
might be laid-off following the mergers while banks having
exceeded their exposure limit to a single client did not help
matters.
</P>
<P>
Uncomfortable about conditions in the market, foreign funds
started selling bluechips with Thursday seeing programmed selling
from U.S. and U.K. funds.
</P>
<P>
During the week, the main board volume fell to 799.821 million
shares worth 1.995 billion ringgit (530.585 million U.S. dollars)
from last week's 857.898 million shares valued at 2.152 billion
ringgit (572.34 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The second board turnover decreased to 90.645 million shares
worth 200.180 million ringgit (53.239 million U.S. dollars) from
91.094 million shares valued at 246.792 million ringgit (65.636
million U.S. dollars) last week.
</P>
<P>
However, off-market volume this week expanded to 76.455 million
shares worth 237.795 million ringgit (63.243 million U.S. dollars)
from 53.994 million shares valued at 202.994 million ringgit
(53.987 million U.S. dollars) last week.
</P>
<P>
A total of 17 companies requested for temporary suspension of
their shares pending results, mergers and other announcements this
week when there were no new listings.
</P>
<P>
The suspended counters were Advance Synergy, Bernas, UMG Group
and Kim Hin on Monday followed by Malpac, Ekran, Wembley, Bescorp,
Len Cheong, Arab-Malaysian Finance, Affin Holdings and ACF
Holdings on Tuesday, Esprit, Maybank and SEA Devt on Wednesday,
Kurnia Setia on Thursday and Apex Equity on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Malaysia CPO, Tin &AMP; Rubber Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's markets of the
crude palm oil (CPO) physicals, tin and rubber closed the week all
higher.
</P>
<P>
On the CPO physicals market, April south ended the week at
2,275 ringgit (605.05 U.S. dollars) per ton, 55 ringgit (14.62
U.S. dollars) better than last week's close of 2,220 ringgit
(590.42 U.S. dollars) per ton.
</P>
<P>
The CPO physicals market is expected to be in a tight-range
trading next week with prices to move within the current levels on
the back of the currency factor, a dealer said.
</P>
<P>
On the Kuala Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM), tin price closed the
week 88 sen (23 U.S. cents) higher at 20.73 ringgit (5.51 U.S.
dollars) per kg.
</P>
<P>
This week saw the price heading upwards gradually since Tuesday
on the back of a continued lower ringgit.
</P>
<P>
The price ranged between 19.85 ringgit (5.28 U.S. dollars) and
20.73 ringgit (5.51 U.S. dollars) per kg this week.
</P>
<P>
Turnover for the week settled at 321 tons against last week's
turnover of 184 tons.
</P>
<P>
The KLTM may trend lower next week as a downward technical
correction may take center stage and erase some of its previous
hefty gains, a dealer said.
</P>
<P>
During the week, rubber prices on the Malaysian rubber market
were on their uptrend as many foreign enquiries came in, boosted
by the continued depreciation of ringgit.
</P>
<P>
April RSS One ended the week seven sen better at 276.50 sen
(73.5 U.S. cents) per kg from 269.50 sen (71.6 U.S. cents) per kg
last week while SMR 20 added 6.50 sen per kg at 273.00 sen (72.6
U.S. cents) per kg.
</P>
<P>
The International Natural Rubber Organization daily market
indicator price for April 2 stood at 192.57 Malaysian/Singapore
cents versus 187.43 cents on March 26.
</P>
<P>
The five-day moving average was at 190.57 cents versus 188.32
cents.
</P>
<P>
The local rubber market is expected to rally further next week
if ringgit continues to depreciate against the U.S. dollar,
dealers said.

<P>
SHANGHAI, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The public sector of the economy
in east China's Shanghai municipality, a leading industrial and
financial center, remained stable in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The latest data from the municipal statistics bureau show that
the publically owned sector completed added value of 259 billion
yuan, accounting for 77 percent of the municipality's total GDP
(gross domestic product) in 1997, matching the previous year's
level.
</P>
<P>
The publically-owned sector is composed of state-owned and
collectively-owned businesses.
</P>
<P>
State-owned firms completed 191 billion yuan of added value, or
57 percent of the total GDP. The state economy still plays the
major role in key sectors such as commercial, financial and
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's non-public sector maintained rapid development,
according to the statistics. The municipality has 63,000 private
firms and 160,000 self-employed households, completing 76.9

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Explores New Markets for Manpower Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh is increasing its
manpower export mainly to the Gulf states after having lost some
overseas employment markets in such Asian countries as Malaysia,
South Korea and Singapore hit by the monetary turmoil, press
reports said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The number of Bangladeshi migrant workers in Malaysia, one of
the biggest venues for Bangladesh's manpower, fell short of the
target by 23 percent in 1997, according to statistics of the
Bureau of Manpower, Employment and Training.
</P>
<P>
The target of manpower export to Malaysia was fixed at 300,000
in 1997, but the actual number was recorded at about 230,000, the
statistics showed.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the number of Bangladeshi migrants to South Korea
came down to 2,844 in 1997 as against 66,631 in 1996, and
Bangladesh was able to send only 448 persons during the first two
months of this year.
</P>
<P>
The main objective of the on-going drive to seek new markets is
to maintain the manpower export at a reasonable level, the reports
said.
</P>
<P>
Manpower export is a major foreign exchange earner for
Bangladesh. In 1997, about 1.53 billion U.S. dollars in
remittances was sent back home as against 1.36 billion dollars in
1996.

DHAKA, April 4 (Xinhua) -- At least 182 people were killed in
69 road accidents in Bangladesh in the first three months of this
year, a police source said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Reckless driving, inefficiency of the drivers and lack of
public awareness are the main causes of the accidents, according
the source.
</P>
<P>
Overloading in transport also contributes to the frequency of
accidents, an official from the Bangladesh Road transport
Authority said.
</P>
<P>
The most tragic of the road accidents this year was the
collision between a passenger bus and a truck on the
Dhaka-Chittagong highway in Comilla, 90 km southeast of Dhaka, on
January 23. Ten people were killed and 40 others injured in the
accident.
</P>
<P>
Also on the Dhaka-Chittagong highway, two inter-district
passenger buses fell into a roadside ditch on March 28 due to
reckless driving, leaving nine people dead and at least 25
injured.
</P>
<P>
About 20 percent of the accidents during the three months
involved motor vehicles falling into roadside ditches due to
reckless driving.

<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian Luizao scored two
goals to pace Vasco to sail into the next round of Libertadores
Cup here Friday night.
</P>
<P>
In a scoreless first half, Luizao tasted his first kick against
Mexico's Guadalajara goalie Zedano as the ball flew high over the

</P>
<P>
Vasco blew another chance in the 40th minute when a free kick
by Pedrinho smashed into the goal post.
</P>
<P>
In the second half, both teams kept each other locked up until
Guadalajara's Robles was expelled in the 56th minute, but Ramon
sent another free kick to the post four minutes later.
</P>
<P>
All that changed when Luizao headed in a goal in the 68th
minute before Vasco mounted a series of good plays.
</P>
<P>
In the 80th minute, Luizao put a great dribble to Ramon and
recovered the ball off the hands of goalie Zedano to net in his
second.
</P>

<HEADLINE> New Schedule Announced for International Skating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The International Skating Union
(ISU) will improve its events schedule in the next season and to
amend the rules for the free dance.
</P>
<P>
"We now have 20 official ISU events over a seven month season
and we have introduced prize money, a Grand Prix, and a Junior
Grand Prix," said ISU president Ottavio Cinquanta at a press
conference in Minnesota on Friday.
</P>
<P>
From next season, Cinquanta said, "we will have four
Championships -- Europeans, Four Continents, Worlds and Junior --
seven Grand Prix events and nine Junior events."
</P>
<P>
On ice dance judging, he said, the technical committee was
working to amend the rules to include some specific requrements
and elements for the Free Dance.
</P>
<P>
"This will help the skaters and judges know better what is
expected of them," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to Cinquanta, the proposals will be discussed and
voted on at the ISU Congress in Stockholm in June. "It is the
member federation that will make this final decision," said the
president.
</P>
<P>
On the new proposal for two free programs, the president said
there is a new proposal to be discussed at Congress that would
require skaters to have two free programs in a season.
</P>
<P>
The requirement, he said, would be that a skater must present a
different program at the World Championships to the one they
present at the European or Four Continents Championships.
</P>
<P>
"I am in favor of this new proposal because it would make for
more varity for the audience," said Cinquanta.
</P>
<P>
He also said that more money must be invested to educate the
judges.
</P>
<P>
"Judges and coaches could have ongoing seminars where coaches
are giving information, and the judges are accepting the
information," Cinquanta said. "This education is necessary for the
future success of ice dancing."
</P>
<P>
On the age of skaters, the ISU president said that the age
should not be younger than 15 as a matter of health.
</P>
<P>
"We have to protect the young skaters and the minimum age is
now 15. This is a health protection consideration," he said. "The
only power ISU has over skaters is when they skate in an ISU
event."
</P>
<P>
Also he said, skaters have their own right to decide whether
they stay on not in the sport.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot persuade skaters to remain in the sport. And in the
end, it's their own decision," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese American Michelle Kwan,
a runner-up at the 1998 Olympics, led the Women's short program at
the World Figure Skating Championships at Minneapolis, Minnesota
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old skater, who is competing for her fifth world
championships, made steady triple jumps and performed artfully to
cheer the crowd of spectoters at Target Center and received almost
the full marks both in technichs and presentation.
</P>
<P>
Kwan is heavily favored to win the world championship this time
with Olympic gold medalist Tara Lipinski and bronze medalist Chen
Lu skipping the competition.
</P>
<P>
Poland's Anna Rechnio, who was placed 14th at 1995 World
Championships and 19th at 1998 Olympics, surprised the American
skating lovers when she remarkably finished second in the short
program.
</P>
<P>
France's Laetitia Hubert skated third. The 24-year-old French
woman also improved from her sixth position in the 1997 World
Championships.
</P>
<P>
However, two hopeful Russians skated flatly. Irina Slutskaya,
who was placed fifth at the Olympics and bronze medalist at 1996
World Championships, finished fourth today. Maria Butyrskaya, who
was fourth place finisher at the Olympics this year, skated fifth
at the short program.
</P>
<P>
The figure skating rule gives the short program 33.3 percent of
the overall score while the free program 66.7 percent. The free
program will be held Saturday night.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The Russian government will work
out a plan to raise more funds for military reforms by scaling
down defense spending and selling redundant military assets,
acting Russian Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Itar-Tass news agency reported that Kiriyenko and acting
Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev held a two-hour meeting to discuss
military reforms.
</P>
<P>
The two decided that the committee for military construction
would be retained, but a financial guarantee committee for
military reforms, chaired by former First Deputy Prime Minister
Anatoly Chubais, would be scrapped.
</P>
<P>
Kiriyenko praised the progress already made in military
reforms, saying that despite limited financial allocation, defense
officials had worked out clear goals for reforms and worked hard
to achieve them.
</P>
<P>
He said the pace of military reforms must be maintained and the
set tasks must be accomplished in accordance with the actual
financial situation.
</P>
<P>
Due to financial difficulties, Russian servicemen has not been
paid for a month and the government has a large amount of defense
orders to pay, Kiriyenko said.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine: G-7 Breaks Chernobyl Promise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma
Friday accused the Group of Seven industrialized countries of
breaking an agreement to replace the Chernobyl nuclear power plant.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma said the agreement in 1994 had two new nuclear plants
to replace Chernobyl, scene of the world's worst nuclear accident
in 1986.
</P>
<P>
He criticized the Group of seven during talks with visiting
Canadian Natural Resources Minister Ralph Goodale who announced
that Canada was to give 20 million U.S. dollars to help build two
new nuclear power stations.
</P>
<P>
Goodale also promised assistance with advanced technology in
drying and saving nuclear materials during his visit.
</P>
<P>
The aid package included equipment for removing anti-personnel
mines with which Canada had much experience.
</P>
<P>
President Kuchma said Ukraine welcomed the assistance. The two
men also discussed other bilateral cooperation issues.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Most Americans Feel Influenced by Martin Luther King Jr. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 3 (Xinhua) -- A new poll by the Marist
Institute says most Americans feel the late Martin Luther King Jr.
has influenced their lives.
</P>
<P>
The survey says that 30 years after the civil rights leader was
killed in Memphis, Tennessee, 58 percent of the country feels his
life influenced them somewhat or a great deal.
</P>
<P>
The feeling was stronger among black Americans at 89 percent.
</P>
<P>
While 45 percent of white Americans said King influenced them
little or not at all, only 11 percent of blacks felt that way.
</P>
<P>
The responses were reversed when it came to the course of race
relations in the United States. Sixty-two percent of whites said
they thought race relations had improved in the years since King
was assassinated, compared to only 40 percent of blacks.
</P>
<P>
The poll found that 63 percent of blacks thought the progress
towards civil rights for minorities was too slow, while half of
whites thought the pace had been about right. Thirteen percent of
whites and three percent of blacks thought the pace was too fast.
</P>
<P>
The telephone survey was conducted on January 26 and 27, among
917 adults within the continental United States. Phone numbers
were selected to ensure that each region of the country was
represented in proportion to its population.
</P>
<P>
The pollsters say the survey has a margin of error of 3.5
percent.

<HEADLINE> Vietnamese Leaders Call for Closer Ties with China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the Communist Party of
Vietnam (CPV) called for closer relations with the Communist Party
of China (CPC) at meetings with a visiting CPC delegation Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegation is headed by Zeng Qinghong, alternate
member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and
member of the Secretariat of the Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
In their separate meetings with Zeng, General Secretary of the
CPV Central Committee Le Kha Phieu and Consultant of the Central
Committee Do Muoi urged more contacts and mutual support between
the two parties, underscoring the need for the two sides to draw
on each other's successful experience in the new era.
</P>
<P>
Noting the long-standing friendship between the two parties and
two nations, the CPV leaders praised the rapid development of
inter-party and bilateral ties in various fields since the
normalization of Sino-Vietnamese relations in 1991.
</P>
<P>
They said that the CPV and Vietnamese people were happy for the
achievements made by the CPC and Chinese people in their reforms,
opening to the outside world and socialist modernization.
</P>
<P>
The achievements were good not only for China, but also for the
world, they said.
</P>
<P>
Le Kha Phieu and Do Muoi stressed the CPV's policy to adhere to
the socialist road and its strategy to implement overall reforms,
adding that the party was determined to overcome all difficulties
in the bid to fundamentally industrialize and modernize the
country by 2020, as targeted by the CPV's eighth congress.
</P>
<P>
During the meetings, Zeng praised the overall reform led by the
CPV.
</P>
<P>
He said that Vietnam enjoyed political and social stability,
economic growth, continual improvement of people's lives and
marked progress in every field.
</P>
<P>
Zeng especially praised the smooth power transition completed
at the fourth plenary session of the CPV's eighth congress last
December and the National Assembly last September.
</P>
<P>
He said that the three visits to China by Do Muoi made a
significant contribution to promoting the friendly cooperation
between the two parties and two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that both the CPC and the CPV upheld the combination of
the basic theories of Maxism and Leninism with the specific
practice. Both parties formulated their targets, policies and
guiding principles on the basis of their specific national
conditions, he added.
</P>
<P>
Zeng called for an increase of exchange and cooperation between
the two countries and expressed confidence that the two parties
and two peoples would achieve their respective goals.

<HEADLINE> East China Province Strengthens Supervision Over Administration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Officials including the
city's Party secretary and the Mayor, have to offer a detailed plan
to the local newspaper and get it published if they are scheduled
to move into state-funded new housing.
</P>
<P>
If the general public believes that the reasons listed in the
plan are not justifiable, then the plan could not be carried out.
</P>
<P>
Today's People's Daily reported that the new system,
implemented in Jinhua city, eastern China's Zhejiang Province,
aims to increase the transparency of government affairs and
prevent behind-the-scenes deals.
</P>
<P>
"The practice is virtually in line with the central
government's principle of 'rule by law', " said Qiu Baoxing,
secretary of the Communist Party Committee of the city.
</P>
<P>
He believed that making government affairs known to the public
could effectively reduce the possibilities of power-abusing and
check power-for-money deals.
</P>
<P>
To date, the system mainly covers a series of issues which the
public concerns most, such as the enrollment of students and
public servants, the registration of industrial and commercial
enterprises, the transfer and approval of the ownership of land.
</P>
<P>
By "devaluing power," namely only regards the power as a means
to serve the people, government officials can really become
"public servants," according to the Party secretary.
</P>
<P>
A total of five directors of the municipal government
departments have been dismissed, demoted or criticized publicly
for failing to implement the system.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that over 80 percent of city's villages have
also adopted the practice by publishing revenues and expenditures
of the villages on the notice boards, which has helped dispel the
doubts of the villagers.
</P>
<P>
Zheng Shangjin, mayor of the city, said that the practice has
closed the ties between government officials and ordinary citizens
and helped establish a clean and honest government.

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Martin Luther King Jr.'s
"Mountaintop" speech rang out again Friday night at the church
where the late American civil rights leader delivered his last
public address 30 years ago -- the night before he was
assassinated.
</P>
<P>
"Martin believed in this country, that black and white can live
together," The Associated Press quoted Bishop Chandler Owens of
the Church of God in Christ as saying. "And I think we have come a
long way toward that goal. Every step we make in that direction,
we must remember the great dreamer."
</P>
<P>
The memorial service in Memphis, Tennessee was part of a
weekend long "Pilgrimage to Memphis," a series of seminars and
other events honoring King and other champions of the civil rights
movement.
</P>
<P>
King was killed on April 4, 1968, by a rifle shot while
standing on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel, now a civil rights
museum. King was in Memphis to support a strike by sanitation
workers.
</P>
<P>
The opening session for the pilgrimage was held at Clayborn
Temple, the church were the marches for the sanitation strike
began and ended.
</P>
<P>
"We saw ourselves as the liberation movement, the freedom
movement, a justice movement, a movement that wanted to transform
America," said the Rev. James Lawson, a close King associate, said
at the opening session.
</P>
<P>
He said, while the civil rights movement of the 1950s and '60s
achieved many of its goals, much work remains to be done, and King
set the example of how to do it.

COLOMBO, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The International Tourism
Development Institute of Japan and Sri Lanka's Ceylon Tourist

Tourist arrivals from Japan to Sri Lanka have declined over the

destination and many Japanese tourists now visit that country.

The spokesman said Senanayake had discussions with officials
from 15 leading tour companies in Japan.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Opposes Interference in Its Internal Affairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavian Foreign Minister
Zivorad Jovanovic reiterated Friday that international pressure on
the Kosovo crisis amounted to outside interference in his
country's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
During talks with Russia's First Deputy Foreign Minister
Igor Ivanov, Jovanovic said that interference in the internal affairs
of other countries violated the United Nations Charter and
international laws, the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug reported.
</P>
<P>
He said he was surprised that the six-nation Contact Group on
the former Yugoslavia interfered in the internal affairs of the
Republic of Serbia and Yugoslavia through the U.N. Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov, who arrived Thursday for a working visit, briefed
Jovanovic on Russia's stand on the U.N. Security Council
resolution for an arms embargo against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Yugoslavian President Slobodan Milosevic and Serbian
President Milan Milutinovic also met Russia's first deputy foreign
minister.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council imposed an arms embargo Tuesday to
pressure Belgrade to open unconditional dialogue with ethnic
Albanian leaders in the troubled Serbian province Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo has a 90 percent ethnic Albanian majority which has been
seeking independence from Yugoslavia since 1981. Violence there
has been growing this year after the failure to implement an
education agreement reached between Milosevic and the leader of
ethnic Albanians, Ibrahim Rugova.

HANOI, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The Communist Party of China (CPC)
and the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) agreed here Friday to
further promote the friendly cooperation between the two parties
and the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached during the talks between the Chinese
delegation, headed by Zeng Qinghong, secretary of the Secretariat
of the CPC Central Committee, and the Vietnamese delegation, led
by Phan Dien, chairman of the Department of Economy of the CPV
Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Zeng arrived here Thursday for a six-day official goodwill
visit to Vietnam at the invitation of the CPV Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
The two sides briefed each other about the situations in their
respective countries and exchanged views on how to advance
friendly cooperation between the two parties and the two nations.
</P>
<P>
Zeng said that the relations between the two parties had
continuously developed since the normalization of the

</P>
<P>
The China-Vietnamese relations were important in China's
foreign policies, especially in its policies towards neighboring
countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zeng extended his heartfelt congratulations to the
accomplishment the CPV made in its 10-year reforms. He believed the
Vietnamese people, under the leadership of the CPV, were able to
materialize the blueprint mapped out by the CPV.
</P>
<P>
Phan Dien outlined his party's achievements in reforms and
economic construction since the Eighth Congress of the CPV, as
well as major measures his party had taken to overcome its current
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
He said the Vietnamese government and the CPV attached great
importance to maintaining good neighborly relations and
cooperation with China.
</P>
<P>
Ex-CPV General-Secretary Do Muoi met with Chinese President
Jiang Zemin during his China tour last year, and reached consensus
on some major issues, which could serve as guidelines for the two
parties' relations into the 21st century, he said.

economic relations.

<HEADLINE> Italian Economy Expands in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The Italian economy began expanding
again last year, but the growth failed to revive the employment
situation, according to the government's 1997 economic report.
</P>
<P>
Economic growth last year, when gross domestic product (GDP)
grew by just under two percent, was driven by a 2.4 percent
increase in private demand and a general increase in disposable
family incomes, the report said.
</P>
<P>
But the recovery in business and industry failed to produce an
upturn in employment, which fell by 0.2 percent. The overall
jobless rate was put at 12.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Investment rose by 0.6 percent, which showed that short-term
prospects for job creation were modest. The only area where
investment took off strongly in 1997 was in intermediary goods,
the report said, indicating that most new jobs will probably be
confined to service industries.
</P>
<P>
Investment in the construction industry fell sharply,
reflecting the crisis in the house-building sector, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, rising international demand and a strong U.S. dollar
boosted Italian exports, which grew by 6.3 percent. The rise
however failed to counterbalance "the exceptional expansion in
imports," which soared by 11.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The government attributed the import boom to automobile buying
and industry's need to stock up on new materials.
</P>
<P>
Despite the sharp increase in purchase of foreign products, the
falling deficit in invisible earnings meant that the current
account balance slipped slightly to 3.2 percent of GDP, it added.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves Second Annual ESAF Loan for Guinea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) announced Friday the approval of a 31 million U.S. dollar
loan for Guinea under the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility
(ESAF).
</P>
<P>
The loan, the second annual loan under ESAF, is provided in
support of the government's economic program for 1998-2000.
</P>
<P>
It is available in two equal semi-annual installments, the
first of which will be made available on April 15.
</P>
<P>
The main macroeconomic objectives of the 1998 program include
achieving a growth rate of five percent in gross domestic product
(GDP) real terms, bringing down inflation to about 3.5 percent and
containing the current account deficit at 7.7 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
The ESAF is a concessional IMF facility for assisting member
countries that are undertaking economic reform programs to
strengthen their balance of payments and to improve their growth
prospects.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Import More Rice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' rice imports for
1998 may reach as high as 1.5 million tons due to the lingering
effects of the El Nino weather phenomenon on the country's rice
farms, press reports said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
National Food Authority deputy administrator Gregorio Tan was
quoted as saying the food agency has standby authority from the
government to import up to 1.15 million tons of rice this year.
</P>
<P>
But Tan said his agency was still waiting for the April crop
survey of the Bureau of Agricultural Statistics to determine how
much more the government will need in terms of imports.
</P>
<P>
Due to the dry spell caused by El Nino which significantly
reduced farm yields and plantings, the rice supply shortfall can
reach anywhere between 1.2 to 1.5 million tons, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Tan, the agency has already imported 500,000 tons
of rice, most of which came from Vietnam, followed by China and
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The agency expects to bring in another 300,000 tons before the
start of the traditional lean rice supply period of July-September
in the country.
</P>
<P>
To ensure that rice stocks will be ample, the government will
make sure the national rice inventory by July 1 of every year is
good for 90 days supply.
</P>
<P>
But early indications reveal that to keep this ideal buffer
level, more than 1.15 million tons in imports will be needed, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The country's grain production for the first semester of 1998
is expected to fall by more than 12 percent due to the drought, it
said.

MEXICO, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Frankie Liles retained his WBA
super middleweight title by winning a unanimous decision over
Russian Andrei Schkalikov in Bayamon, Puerto Rico on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
Schkalikov took an aggressive manner, hurting Liles in both the

</P>
<P>
Liles improved to 32-1 with 20 knockouts, while Schkalikov fell

</P>
<P>
On the undercard, last-minute replacement Fred Norwood who had
29-0 including 18 knockouts, scored a unanimous decision win over
Venezuela's Antonio Cermeno to take the vacant WBA featherweight
title.
</P>
<P>
Cermeno, 26-2 with 16 knockouts, originally was to challenge

<HEADLINE> Thai Finance Chief Vows to Maintain High Interest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Interest rates of Thailand's banks
will remain high until the basic economic problems of the country
are solved and liquidity pressure eased, Finance Minister Tarrin
Nimmanhaeminda said.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's Bangkok Post quoted the minister as saying that
foreign investors would see any effort to force interest rate cuts
as unwise until economic fundamentals improved.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks after Bangkok bank, the country's largest
bank, announced on Thursday that it was raising lending interest
rates by 25-75 basis points.
</P>
<P>
Bangkok Bank's move reflected continued tight liquidity in the
financial system, Tarrin said.
</P>
<P>
Authorities have maintained that interest rates could drop only
when the baht stabilizes and capital inflows improve through a
revival of investor confidence.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the baht traded at 40.7 against the dollar, bouncing
back after dropping as low as 41.2 earlier in the day. Dealers
said the weakness of the Japanese yen, which hit a seven-year low
against the dollar near 135, was pulling down the baht.
</P>
<P>
Tarrin said the liquidation of the 56 closed finance firms,
recapitalization of other financial institutions and the takeover
of four troubled banks would help increase investor confidence.
</P>
<P>
Local bankers said fierce competition for deposits has also
caused interest rates to remain high.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Doje Cering, who was recently
re-appointed as minister of civil affairs, said yesterday that his
ministry will try to improve China's social environment to ensure
the reform, economic development and social stability.
</P>
<P>
The minister, from the Tibetan ethnic group, promised to take
responsibility for sharing the central government's cares for the
poor, reported today's "China Daily."
</P>
<P>
He also vowed to help people suffering from natural disasters
get over their difficulties by improving social welfare and
disaster relief.
</P>
<P>
The minister said one of the most important tasks in his new
five-year term is to extend the scope of democracy at the
grassroots level to make sure that people directly exercise their
democratic rights.
</P>
<P>
People would manage their own affairs according to the law by
regulating the direct election of the village committees in rural
areas and neighbourhood committees in urban areas. Both of these
are self-management organizations.
</P>
<P>
The services the ministry provides go "from the cradle to the
grave," the minister said, referring to its administration over
citizens' birth, marriage and funeral service.
</P>
<P>
Doje Cering was confident that his ministry will continue to
play a key role in pressing ahead with the socialization of
China's welfare undertakings, particularly welfare services for an
ever-increasing number of senior citizens, more than 60 million
disabled people and other groups of urban and rural poor.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Ask World Bank for Housing Loan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government plans to
borrow 1.14 billion U.S. dollars from the World Bank to set up
more socialized housing and at the same time develop the market
for secondary mortgage papers, a Philippine newspaper said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The loan will be on top of the 500 million dollar financial
sector adjustment loan the World Bank has committed to the
Philippines, the Malaya newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
The development of secondary market for housing mortgage papers
will deepen the source of funding for mass housing.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines currently has a housing backlog in excess of
one million units.
</P>
<P>
The loan from the multilateral financing institution would be
used to establish institutions having the capability to create a
framework for private secondary mortgage institutions, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The government aims to provide the necessary legal reforms to
reduce the credit risk at a time when the cost of mortgage
takeouts have gone up.
</P>
<P>
This will also help address the complaints of property
developers of the high interest rates crippling the sector.

were either removed from city streets or sealed up and steel
barricades were set up outside schools.

Chevenement said that heavy penalties will be implemented
against "drunken behavior, introducing banned objects into
stadiums such as knives, or inciting racial hatred" during the

</P>
<P>
Punishment for such offenses will include jail terms and bans
from attending matches in France for five years, the minister

BEIJING, April 4 (Xinhua) -- China's medical reform aims to ban
the practice of "lengthy prescription," a common practice enables
many hospitals to make money from medicine, today's China Daily
reported.
</P>
<P>
The ministry is also scheduled to gradually lower the cost of

However, charges for technical services should be increased in

The minister vows to improve service quality and efficiency by
reorganizing hospital design and facilities and improve
community-based health centers.
</P>
<P>
The final objective is to realize "the basic health for all,
and the sooner, the better," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that he is fully aware of the responsibilities
of his office because China's health reform and development lag
behind social and economic progress.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that he would study and work hard and try to
be a qualified health administrator, thus leaving a good

Hernan Gumy 6-4, 3-6, 6-3, 7-5 for almost four hours.
</P>
<P>
Argentina's Franco Squillari, ranked 116th, romped Chile's
397-ranked Hermes Gamonal 6-2, 6-4, 6-2 in the second single.
</P>
<P>
Cheered on by a sellout crowd at the Buenos Aires Lawn Tennis
Club, Gumy came close to pushing the left-hander Rios to five
sets. But the 21-year-old Rios survived three set points off his
own serve when he was down 5-4 before wrapping up the afternoon's
work by winning the next three games.
</P>
<P>
Gumy, who was playing his first match after six months out of
the game due to a groin injury, beat Rios in the final of the
Santiago Open in 1996.

<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori
Friday praised China for its support for the education
modernization in his country.
</P>
<P>
He spoke at a ceremony marking the donation of machinery and
instruments by China.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori said that there exists an open credit line of 150
million U.S. dollars from the Bank of China for the acquisition of
machinery and equipment for educational uses.
</P>
<P>
A second credit line of 19.5 million U.S. dollars from China is
also open for centers of training and services for small and
medium-sized business entrepreneurs in Peru, Fujimori added.
</P>
<P>
"This means a strong promotion for the process of education
modernization we are implementing, especially in the technical
area for the creation of jobs," said the president.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori noted that the trade between the two countries reached
650 million U.S. dollars in 1997 after years of growth.
</P>
<P>
"This is a signal of the enormous potential existing for
commercial and technological cooperation in general exchanges
between Peru and China," he said.

<HEADLINE> Defending Champion Loses Two Singles in Davis Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion Sweden suffered
a big blow by losing the first two singles in the first round of
the Davis Cup World Group on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Without three of its top players, Sweden fielded in Magnus
Norman and Mikael Tillstrom in the first day competition against
Slovakia.
</P>
<P>
Dominik Hrbaty survived a protracted match to win over Norman,
who was battling the flu, 7-6 (7-5), 4-6, 6-4, 3-6, 6-2 while
Karol Kucera outwitted Tillstrom from a first set deficit 1-6,
6-1, 6-2, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
The defeats were a shock for the defending champion but still
reasonable as Swedish Jonas Bjorkman and Thomas Enqvist were
absent with injuries while doubles specialist Nicklas Kulti
skipped the tournament to accompany his wife who just gave birth.
</P>
<P>
Hrbaty took 3 hours 20 minutes to take his match, pacing the
Slovaks for a great chance to qualify for the second round as the
doubles will reel off on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Led by former star Miloslav Mecir, who is currently captain,
Slovakia has won 11 of its 12 Davis Cup matches to progress
quickly in five years from the bottom ranks to the World Group,
the top 16 of Davis Cup.
</P>
<P>
In Saturday doubles, Kucera and Jan Kroslak were expected to
team against Sweden's Magnus Larsson and Tillstrom.
</P>
<P>
On their home turf, two Davis Cup rookies gave Germany a 2-0
lead over South Africa in opening singles.
</P>
<P>
Nicolas Kiefer overcame a two-set deficit in his Davis Cup
debut for a 4-6, 4-6, 6-1, 6-2, 6-2 victory over Grant Stafford
before Tommy Haas celebrated his 20th birthday by upsetting Wayne
Ferreira 7-6 (7-2), 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 to put the Germans one victory
away from the second round.
</P>
<P>
The match also marked the debut of Boris Becker as Germany's
Davis Cup team boss. Becker was in semi retirement but might play
the doubles on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In Australia, Zimbabwe's Byron Black toppled U.S. Open champion
Pat Rafter to level the tie against Australia at 1-1. Black
bounced back to defeat fourth-ranked Rafter 3-6, 6-3, 6-2, 7-6
(7-0).
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Australia's Jason Stoltenberg beat Wayne Black in the
opening set 6-3, 6-4, 5-7, 7-5.
</P>
<P>
In Brussels, Jan Siemerink gave the Netherlands a 1-0 lead over
Belgium by beating Johan Van Herck 6-4, 6-3, 4-6, 6-1, while the
game between Belgium's No. 1 Filip De Wulf and Dutchman Sjeng
Schalken was postponed to Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In Genoa, Italy took 1-0 lead over India as rain curbed Mahesh
Bhupathi's efforts to level the score. India's No.1 player was
leading Davis Cup debutante Davide Sanguinetti 6-2, 6-2, 2-3 when
the match was rained out.
</P>
<P>
Andrea Gaudenzi gave Italy its 1-0 with a 6-0, 6-2, 1-6, 6-2
victory against Prahland Srinath, making his Davis Cup debut.
</P>
<P>
In Zurich, Switzerland and the Czech Republic finished 1-1 as
Bohdan Ulihrach beat Switzerland's Ivo Heuberger 6-7 (8-6), 6-0,
7-5, 6-2 and Marc Rosset rebounded to beat Daniel Vacek 3-6, 6-2,
7-6 (7-5), 6-0.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's Gustavo Kuerten gave the home crowd a scare before he
rallied to defeat Spain's Carlos Moya 5-7, 1-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4.
Yet, his teammate Fernando Meligeni was defeated by Alex Corretja
of Spain 4-6, 6-4, 3-6, 6-4, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
The matches between the United States and Russia were postponed
by rain with Jim Courier slated to play Yevgeny Kafelnikov and
Andre Agassi facing Andrei Olhovskiy.

<P>
MANILA, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Philippine newspapers Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Manila Bulletin:
</P>
<P>
-- A fireman was killed after a burning tree fell on him as he
fought a fire that has raged for 19 days, threatening to destroy
one of the Philippines' virgin forests, officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Manila Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The Philippine government on Friday alerted its 3,000
firefighting teams to ensure that 10 of the protected areas in the
country are kept safe from forest fires.
</P>
<P>
Manila Standard:
</P>
<P>
-- Forest firefighters are sparing no effort to control a
massive forest fire that has been eating up hectares upon hectares
of pine trees since Monday in the Bokod and Itogon towns of
Benguet province, the northern Philippines.

<HEADLINE> 23 Percent of US Homes Online by 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 3 (Xinhua) -- By the end of this year, 23
percent of all U.S. households will be accesssing the Internet and
other online services, according to a new study of International
Data Corporation (IDC), a leading American provider of information
technology data, analysis and consulting.
</P>
<P>
DIC analysts also expect home users to catch up business users
when it comes to sophistication about use of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Online and Internet usage in the home has increased dramatically
over the past 18 months, according to the IDC study. By the end of
1996, only about 13 percent of all U.S. households were online. The
current level is more than 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the increase in the number of users, both the
frequency of use and the amount of time spent online have also grown
significantly. Nearly 60 percent of all online households access their
online service at least once a day, increasing from only 35 percent
for the prior year.
</P>
<P>
Sub-PCs of 1,000 dollars and new devices like WebTV and digital
set-top boxes are partly contributed to the sharp increase.
</P>
<P>
The study also found that electronic commerce is even more
widespread among home users than business users, indicating that more
home users who are buying over the Web seem to feel comfortable with
Web-based payment mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
Business users tend to purchase more expensive goods such as
airline tickets, hotel reservations, computer hardware and software.
</P>
<P>
Aside from the availability of less expensive PCs and new Internet
devices, IDC cites World Wide Web content as a driver for increase
Internet access from home.

<HEADLINE> "Easy Passage" Put in Place Between Nicaragua, Honduras </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Nicaragua and Honduras have
started an "easy passage" system at their border post of El
Guasaule to speed up the processing of tourists, the Nicaraguan
Foreign Ministry said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The system is part of agreements reached by the CA-4 Group,
made up of Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Nicaragua, which
provide for a single point where migration and customs officers
work together to simplify the procedures for nationals and
passenger vehicles of the four countries.
</P>
<P>
Vehicles and their passengers of any of the CA-4 Group
countries will be granted a permit of stay of 90 days.
</P>
<P>
The CA-4 migration directors, who gathered in San Salvador
Wednesday, agreed to maintain open the border posts between the
four countries from 08:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. local time).
</P>
<P>
But the El Guasaule border post will be open around the clock.

<HEADLINE> Dutch Leads Belgians in Davis Cup Tourney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Jan Siemerink entertained
hundreds of followers by winning the first of Friday's opening
singles of the Dutch-Belgian Davis Cup tie in the world group.
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old, ranked 29th on the ATP tour, routed
71st-ranked Johan van Herck 6-4, 6-3, 4-6 and 6-1 in three hours,
though they had to wait for almost five hours for rain to stop and
match to start.
</P>
<P>
Siemerink, finalist of last month's Rotterdam championship and
semi-finalist at the London and Copenhagen open, proved simply too
much for Van Herck even though the Dutchman played stronger on
faster courts.
</P>
<P>
But Siemerink seemed to have little problem with the slow clay
court in Brussels and with the humidity by unleashing powerful
winning serves and demonstrating fleet-footedness.
</P>
<P>
The second of the day's opening singles between Sjeng Schalken
of the Netherlands and Filip Dewulf of Belgium had to be put off
for Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands and Belgium met four times previously in the
Davis Cup, each winning two encounters. The Dutch whitewashed the
Belgians in their last Davis Cup tie in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Dalian Wanda, Pohang Enter AFC Championship Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 3 (Xinhua) -- China's national first division
league champion Dalian Wanda and defending champion Pohang
Steelers of South Korea qualified for the final after winning
their semi-final matches at the 17th Asian Football Confederation
(AFC) Club Championships Finals here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Wanda, three-time and defending national league champion, won
over last year's AFC Club Championship runner-up Pirouzi from Iran
2-0 in Friday's first semi-final.
</P>
<P>
Wanda is to take on Pohang Steelers, who beat last year's Asian
 Super Cup winner Al-Hilal from Saudi Arabia in the championship
final, set for Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
If Wanda wins over Pohang Steelers on Sunday, it would be
China's second triumph at the annual tournament, following the
victory in 1989 by China's Liaoning provincial team. The city of
Dalian is in the Northeastern Chinese province.
</P>
<P>
Pohang Steelers beat Al-Hilal 1-0 in Friday's second
semi-final.
</P>
<P>
Al-Hilal will meet Pirouzi in the third-place play-off prior to
the championship final Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Wanda's first goal in the Friday semi-final came in the 32nd
minute of the first half, when forward Wang Tao opened the score
with a slam shot within the goal area after receiving a pass from
teammate and national team member Hao Haidong.
</P>
<P>
Hao made it two for Wanda when he scored with a short-range
shot 64 minutes into the game.
</P>
<P>
The veteran Chinese national team player was later named the
most valuable player of the match.
</P>
<P>
Pohang Steelers scored the sole goal of the game at the 45th
minute, through the efforts by Park Tae Ha, who was assisted by
teammate Hwang Sun Hong in the attack.
</P>
<P>
Much more physically fit, the Saudis launched wave upon wave of
offensives in the second half, with numerous threatening shots.
</P>
<P>
The match would have gone the very other way if not for the
tremendous efforts by Pohang's goalkeeper Kim Lee Sup, who
retrieved many dangerous shots from the swift and aggressive Saudi
forwards.
</P>
<P>
The four sides for the Hong Kong championship came out of a
qualifying tournament some four months long involving 15 teams
from West and Central Asia and 16 squads from East Asia.
</P>
<P>
The AFC Club Championships have been held annually since 1967,
except for 1969 and 1972-1984. Club sides from Israel, Iran and
South Korea each won three championships.

<HEADLINE> State Department Reject Lawmaker's Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The State Department on Friday
rejected a demand by Benjamin Gilman, a key Republican
Representative, that President Bill Clinton make a decision within
three weeks on whether foreign companies are violating a U.S. law
prohibiting large investments in Iran's energy sector and whether
sanctions should be imposed against the companies as a result.
</P>
<P>
"All options available remain open, including the possibility
of sanctions," State Department spokesman James Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to speculate as to when our review will be
complete, but it certainly wouldn't be based on some arbitrary
deadline," he added.
</P>
<P>
Gilman, the chairman of the House International Relations
Committee sent a letter on Thursday to Clinton, saying his panel
will decide whether the White House is skirting the law if the
Clinton administration does not act three weeks later when
Congress reconvene after a recess.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. President, refusing to enforce the law in this case is not
an option, not least because your oath of office requires you to
see that the laws are faithfully executed," Gilman said.
</P>
<P>
"Congress is about to begin a three week recess. If (the law)
remains unimplemented when we reconvene, this committee will begin
to explore whether there has been a willful decision to not
enforce the law i this matters," he added.
</P>
<P>
Since late last year, the U.S. State Department has been
reviewing whether a 2 billion U.S. dollar deal by France's Total,
Russia's Gazprom and Malaysia's Petronas to develop a major
Iranian gas field violates a U.S. law that seeks to punish
companies investing 20 million or more U.S. dollars in Iran's or
Libya's energy sector over a 12-month period.
</P>
<P>
The State Department has also been reviewing whether a separate
$180 million deal in Iran's energy sector by Indonesia's Bakrie
Minorak Petroleum and Canada's Bow Valley Energy Ltd violates the
law.
</P>
<P>
Gilman criticized the administration for taking too long to
render a decision in either case and said "Congress cannot be
indifferent to whether the laws it passes are enforced."
</P>
<P>
Rubin said U.S. policy is being pursued under the law but that
the administration is examining what he called new factors,
including whether the Asia financial crisis is having as impact on
the investment.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. law against foreign companies investing in Iran's
energy sector has been criticized worldwide, especially by U.S.
allies, which rejected the law as interfering into other
countries' affairs.
</P>
<P>
They have vowed to retaliate if the United States enforce the
law and punish their firms.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration has delayed to make a decision
whether to punish those foreign companies for fear of backfire
its action could ensue.

NEW YORK, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar fell against most

</P>
<P>
Moody's Investors Service, a leading U.S. rating company,

That and a bullish Wall Street sent the greenback to 135.10 yen,

<HEADLINE> Quebec Liberals Lead in Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The Liberal Party of Quebec would
win the next provincial election with Jean Charest as their
leader, the latest poll suggests.
</P>
<P>
Almost half of Quebecers -- 49.7 percent -- would vote for the
Liberals if an election were held now, according to the poll by
the SOM firm for The Gazette and Le Soleil newspapers.
</P>
<P>
Only 30.7 percent of respondents said they would vote for the
ruling Parti Quebecois, whose leader Lucien Bouchard promised to
hold another sovereignty referendum if he wins.
</P>
<P>
With the undecided votes factored in, the poll showed, the
results of the election would have been 57.5 percent for the
Liberals, 35.5 percent for the Parti Quebecois, and 7.1 percent
for other parties.
</P>
<P>
The poll is the first taken since Charest announced last week
his intention to seek the Liberal leadership after Daniel Johnson
said he would step down to give his party a better chance to win
the next election, which must be held by autumn 1999.
</P>
<P>
Charest officially resigned on Friday as leader of the federal
Progressive Conservative Party after he bid farewell in the House
of Commons on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Pollsers attributed the strong support for the pro-unity
Liberals largely to the fact that its potential leader Charest is
benefiting from enormous media attention around his jump into
Quebec politics.
</P>
<P>
The poll also showed that Charest leads Bouchard in all age
groups except those under 25 years old in the French-speaking
province of Canada.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Net Wealth Grows in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Canada's national net worth rose
3.6 percent to 2.7 trillion dollars (1.9 trillion USD) in 1997,
reaching 87,100 per capita, Statistics Canada reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
"This was the result of an increase in national wealth, less a
small rise in Canada's net foreign indebtedness," the statistics
agency said.
</P>
<P>
Canada's national wealth rose 3.5 percent to 3 trillion
dollars, in line with an increase in domestic expenditures in
1997.
</P>
<P>
The gain resulted from acquisitions and revaluations of
tangible assets such as automobiles, houses, household
furnishings, appliances, land, business machinery and equipment,
office buildings, manufacturing plants and refineries.
</P>
<P>
"The change in wealth was broadly based in that all assets
grew, though at different rates," the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Individuals accounted for 49 percent of national wealth,
unchanged from 1996.
</P>
<P>
National wealth grew almost 4.0 percent in both the personal
and corporate sectors, compared with a modest 1.4 percent in the
government sector.

<HEADLINE> UK, Ireland Optimistic on N.Irish Peace Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 3 (Xinhua) - Both UK Prime Minister Tony Blair
and his Irish counterparts Bertie Ahern expressed confidence
Friday in the Northern Ireland peace process, saying an agreement
is within sight.
</P>
<P>
The two prime ministers made the statement after having held
talks on the intensifying Northern Irish peace process in London
Friday and pledged "intense contact" over the weekend with all the
participants of the peace talks in Belfast.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders, meeting on the fringes of an Asia-Europe
summit, said that a deal could be reached with "realistic
negotiation".
</P>
<P>
The deadline for a peace agreement was set for April 9, but
deep divisions still exist between Catholic and Protestant
leaders.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the chairman of the peace talks, former U.S. senator
George Mitchell, said Friday evening that a political settlement
is in sight, but adding that he had failed to complete an agenda
for a settlement as he had planned.
</P>
<P>
The agenda was originally planned to be put to the parties
involved in the peace talks Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
The document was supposed to pave the way for a final
settlement early next week and to list areas of agreement and
other issues he wants to try to resolve in meetings.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Friday, UK Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam and
Gerry Adams, the leader of the Irish Republican Army's political
wing Sinn Fein, also expressed optimism that a peace deal could be
reached within the deadline.

WASHINGTON, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Friday that it believed Israel had nothing to do with the death of
a Hamas bomb-maker.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin told a briefing that as
Washington had no independent information on the case, "I'm not
aware of any reason to doubt" Israel's denial.
</P>
<P>
The bombmaker, Muhyideen al-Sharif, was found dead on Sunday
near a booby-trapped car in the West Bank town of Ramallah. He was
said to be shot dead.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian Legislative Council said on Thursday that the
death of Sharif was a "criminal act" perpetrated by Israel. Hamas
has vowed to take revenge.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Friday that
Israel had nothing to do with Sharif's death.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the United States obviously believed what Netanyahu
had said.
</P>
<P>
"We obviously take Prime Minister Netanyahu at his word," he
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Rubin also deplored threats of revenge by Hamas, saying: "We
deplore the statements of those Hamas officials who are trying to
use this event as an excuse advocate violence."

<HEADLINE> Ex-CIA Employee Charged With Spying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 2 (Xinhua) -- A fired employee of the Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA) was charged Friday with giving national
defense secrets to two foreign governments and was held without
bail.
</P>
<P>
Frederick Douglas Groat, who was arrested Wednesday night
without incident by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI),
entered a not guilty plea through his attorney at the federal
courthouse here to all five counts against him.
</P>
<P>
All four espionage counts allege that the spying took place
between March 24, 1997 and some time in April 1997.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Eric Dubelier persuaded U.S. District Judge Norma
Holloway Johnson to continue holding the burly and bearded Groat
without bail by calling him "a risk of flight and a danger to the
community."
</P>
<P>
"Based on his former employment with the CIA, he is trained in
travel and false identity and deception," Dubelier said.
</P>
<P>
"He has no ties to the community and he possesses sensitive
classified information" that could be communicated to foreign
nations if he were allowed to go free.
</P>
<P>
Groat, 50, who worked at the CIA for 16 years until being fired
in 1996, also was charged with trying to extort more than 500,000
U.S. dollars from the spy agency in return for not revealing
secrets to foreign governments.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Attorney Wilma Lewis said after the hearing that Groat
participated during his CIA career in classified covert operations
aimed at the penetration of cryptographic systems of foreign
governments.
</P>
<P>
He allegedly disclosed national defense information concerning
the targeting and compromise of the cryptographic systems of two
unidentified foreign governments to those governments.
</P>
<P>
"The alleged unauthorized disclosure of these activities could
have a significant impact on the national security of the United
States," said Lewis, whose office will prosecute the case.
</P>
<P>
"This case involves highly sensitive classified information
that could have a serious impact on the national security of the
United States. In short this is a serious espionage case," she
said.
</P>
<P>
Dubelier told the judge that Groat had been trained by the CIA
"in traveling in false identification and deception."
</P>
<P>
He said Groat possessed sensitive intelligence information
which could cause "grave damage" to national security if
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
George Tenet, the head of the CIA, said in a statement that the
full extent of any damage to national security has yet to be
determined.
</P>
<P>
"The charges against Mr Groat are extremely serious," Tenet
said. "His arrest demonstrates that the U.S. government will not
rest in our efforts against those who would commit espionage...;
nor will we be intimidated by threats of blackmail."
</P>
<P>
The case is the latest in a series of embarrassing spy cases
involving the CIA.
</P>
<P>
CIA turncoat Aldrich Ames was arrested in 1994 and has pleaded
guilty to betraying at least 11 Soviet and Eastern European agents
working for the United States in one of the most damaging
espionage cases in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
Harold Nicholson pleaded guilty last year to spying for Moscow,
becoming the highest-ranking CIA officer convicted in a spy case.

<HEADLINE> Small Plane Crashes in Lake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 3 (Xinhua) -- A small plane carrying the
county attorney of Denton County, Texas of the United States,
crashed into Lake Ponchartrain. She was rescued Friday after
clinging to wreckage for 12 hours, but her daughter and two other
people were missing.
</P>
<P>
The airplane, bound from Denton, Texas, to New Orleans, was
under radar control when it vanished about 10:30 p.m. Thursday
about 16 kilometers north of the New Orleans Lakefront Airport,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
Attorney Carmen Rivera-Worley was found in the lake about 10:30
a.m. Friday, The Associated Press quoted the Coast Guard as
saying. There were no signs of the three other people aboard the
single-engine Cherokee PA28, said Coast Guard Petty Officer Renee
Gordon.
</P>
<P>
Ms. Rivera-Worley, 44, was taken to a Medical Center. Her
condition was not immediately determined but hospital officials
did say she was conscious.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Aviation Administration reported that the plane to
New Orleans, had been cleared for approach when an air traffic
controller noticed it was off course. The pilot said he had
instrument problems and wanted to climb above the clouds,
according to the FAA. Radar showed the plane descending and then
it disappeared.

<HEADLINE> China Urges Europe to Help Address Asian Financial Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan on Friday urged European countries to adopt strong and
concrete measures to help Asian countries overcome the financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held in London during the ASEM
conference, Tang said it is always easy to adopt a document but
it's more important to implement it and adopt strong measures to
translate ideas into reality.
</P>
<P>
Leaders from all the 25 participating members of the ASEM
meeting on Friday issued a special statement on the Asian
financial crisis, reaffirming the urgent need to respond
decisively to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese foreign minister said the impact of the financial
crisis in Asia has gone far beyond the Asian area, and has spread
to other regions of the world.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, all Asian countries, including those present at the
ASEM meeting, hope European countries to pay close attention to
this matter and make substantial contribution to alleviating the
financial problem.
</P>
<P>
"We think the European countries should be interested in this
matter and should make contributions, because by doing so, not
only the Asian countries will benefit, but Europe as well."
</P>
<P>
Tang pledged again not to devalue the Chinese currency. "The
message to Hong Kong is that we are determined to maintain
prosperity and stability in Hong Kong. The message to our Asian
neighbors is that China is a responsible country."
</P>
<P>
"We know that once we commit ourselves to this promise, we are
under pressure and we may pay a price. But in order to safeguard
the economic and financial stability in the Asian countries hit by
the financial crisis, we are willing to do so at any cost."
</P>
<P>
On China's accession into the World Trade Organization (WTO),
Tang said it is well acknowledged that China and the WTO need each
other. "On the one hand, China needs the WTO, but on the other
hand, the WTO is not a real world trading organization without the
participation of China."
</P>
<P>
He stated that over the past 12 years, China has been working
hard for its admission to the WTO, and has conducted numerous
negotiations on this issue. "The core of this issue is how to
strike a balance between rights and obligations. "
</P>
<P>
No matter when China will join the WTO, China's opening up
policy will not change and China will open wider to the outside,
he underlined.
</P>
<P>
On China's relations with Britain and the EU as a whole, Tang
said the official visit of Premier Zhu Rongji to Britain and the
China-European Union (EU) summit held on the sidelines of the ASEM
conference were very successful.
</P>
<P>
"As a result, the relationship between China and Britain as
well as the relationship between China and the EU will be brought
to a higher level."
</P>
<P>
Tang added that the main purposes of Zhu's visit to Britain and
his participation in the ASEM conference are to deepen mutual
understanding, to expand common ground and to promote mutual
cooperation and common development.

<HEADLINE> Forty Students Arrested to Curb Campus Riots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 3 (Xinhua) -- South African police Friday
fired teargas and rubber bullets and arrested at least 40
students to curb riots on the campus of the University of
Transkei (Unitra) at Umtata in Eastern Cape province, South
African Press Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Police were called in when about 400 students toyi-toyed
(danced in traditional way ) and blocked entrances to the
university.
</P>
<P>
Police vehicles were stoned, police spokesman Wayne Hackart
said. "The situation is tense. Police have fired a lot of rubber
bullets and a lot of teargas," he added
</P>
<P>
The arrested 40 would be charged with public violence, said
Hackart.
</P>
<P>
Unitra public relations manager, Karuna Gopal, said the
students were part of a group given until Friday to pay
outstanding tuition fees. But she denied there were riots on the
campus.
</P>
<P>
"We have about 4,600 registered students who paid their fees.
Those who have not yet paid were given until today to pay. They
are now protesting but there are no riots at Unitra."
</P>
<P>
Unrest flared on the university's campus Monday when the
university announced that students who owed money would be
refused entry.
</P>
<P>
Students' failure to pay tuition fees plunged many
universities of South Africa into financial crisis and even
forced the Fort Hare University to shut down for a certain period
earlier this year.

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky Lawyer Urges Probe End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 3 (Xinhua) -- With Paula Jones' lawsuit
dismissed, former White House intern Monica Lewinsky's lawyer
pleaded publicly Friday with Whitewater prosecutors to end their
criminal investigation of his client.
</P>
<P>
"The American people want this matter to end," William Ginsburg
said.
</P>
<P>
Ginsburg said the effect of the judge's decisions to exclude
Ms. Lewinsky from the Jones case, and then to throw out the
lawsuit in its entirety is that the court "has ruled twice now
that there was no perjury," according to news reports.
</P>
<P>
Continued investigation of the matter will "be against the will
of the American people," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Whitewater prosecutor Kenneth Starr has made clear the
judge's ruling will have no effect on his investigation into
whether President Bill Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky had an affair and
then lied about it under oath in the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
Ginsburg said that Starr needs to consider the will of the
country along with the facts and law.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Required to Decide on Iran Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Benjamin Gilman, a key
Republican Representative, wrote a letter on Thursday to President
Bill Clinton, demanding his administration make a decision on
whether foreign companies are violating a U.S. law prohibiting
large investments in Iran's energy sector and whether sanctions
should be imposed against the companies as a result.
</P>
<P>
The chairman of the House International Relations Committee
said his panel will decide whether the White House is skirting the
law if the Clinton administration does not act three weeks later
when Congress reconvene after a recess.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. President, refusing to enforce the law in this case is not
an option, not least because your oath of office requires you to
see that the laws are faithfully executed," Gilman said.
</P>
<P>
"Congress is about to begin a three week recess. If (the law)
remains unimplemented when we reconvene, this committee will begin
to explore whether there has been a willful decision to not
enforce the law i this matters," he added.
</P>
<P>
Since late last year, the U.S. State Department has been
reviewing whether a 2 billion U.S. Dollars deal by France's Total,
Russia's Gazprom and Malaysia's Petronas to develop a major
Iranian gas field violates a U.S. law that seeks to punish
companies investing 20 million or more U.S.dollars in Iran's or
Libya's energy sector over a 12-month period.
</P>
<P>
The State Department has also been reviewing whether a separate
$180 million deal in Iran's energy sector by Indonesia's Bakrie
Minorak Petroleum and Canada's Bow Valley Energy Ltd violates the
law.
</P>
<P>
Gilman criticized the administration for taking too long to
render a decision in either case and said "Congress cannot be
indifferent to whether the laws it passes are enforced."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. law against foreign companies investing in Iran's
energy sector has been criticized worldwide, especially by U.S.
allies, which rejected the law as interfering into other
countries' affairs.
</P>
<P>
They have vowed to retaliate if the United States enforce the
law and punish their firms.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration has delayed to make a decision
whether to punish those foreign companies for fear of backfire
its action could ensue.
