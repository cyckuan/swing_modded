Nine kidnapped students freed in southern Philippines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) _ Renegade Muslim rebels freed nine
college students they kidnapped in the southern Philippines after
being warned the military would attack their hideout, police said
Tuesday.
	   Police provincial director Isah Abdulla said the victims were
freed late Monday in Tuburan on Basilan island, a few kilometers
(miles) east of where they were abducted Saturday.
	   The students, five women and four men, were returning home for a
weekend stay with their wealthy families on the strife-torn island
when they were kidnapped, police said.
	   Abdulla said the kidnappers, led by Wahab Sakate, a disgruntled
Moro National Liberation Front leader, freed the victims without
any ransom payment after being warned that government troops had
located their hideout and would launch an attack.
	   The students joined their parents immediately after being
released by the kidnappers, who were allowed to peacefully leave
the area.
	   The government signed a peace pact with the MNLF in 1996 to end
a quarter-century rebellion that killed more than 120,000 people.
However, some MNLF members became bandits and resorted to
kidnapping and other crimes to support themselves.
	   Two smaller Muslim rebel groups _ the fundamentalist Abu Sayyaf
and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front _ are still fighting the
government.
	   All three groups are believed to have a presence on Basilan.

Special funeral planned for Northern Ireland's three lost boys

	   BALLYMONEY, Northern Ireland _ A Catholic priest faced the
delicate task of laying to rest three young brothers, raised as
Protestants and killed by a sectarian firebomb in politically
charged Northern Ireland.
	   ``It is not the place to be political,'' the Rev. Peter Forde
said Monday. ``But three children who had just begun life were lent
to us, and we as a society failed in our responsibility.''
	   Forde said nothing could prepare him for the ``unnatural'' sight
of a trio of little coffins in the special funeral Mass on Tuesday,
but he hoped his carefully chosen words would make a difference to
the family of Richard, Mark and Jason Quinn, and to the watching
world.
	   The Mass was scheduled for 11 a.m. (1000 GMT) at the Church or
Our Lady and St. Patrick, with burial planned in the nearby town of
Rasharkin, where the Quinn family has its roots.
	   Irene Quinn, the boys' grandmother, said her daughter wanted
them buried in Rasharkin so she never again would have to set foot
in Ballymoney. Chrissie Quinn's oldest son, 13-year-old Lee, spent
Saturday night with his grandmother and so escaped the attack.
	   Tensions spilling over from a blocked Protestant march outside a
rural church near Portadown were blamed for the early Sunday
morning firebombing of the Quinn house. Police said they believed
the family was targeted because Chrissie Quinn lived there with her
Protestant boyfriend.
	   Two men were being questioned, police said.
	   Ms. Quinn is Catholic, but was raising the boys as Protestants
because she thought it would make life easier for them in
Ballymoney, a hard-line Protestant stronghold about 40 miles (60
kms) northwest of Belfast.
	   Forde said the boys' mother retreated into shock but she
insisted that her sons must receive a Catholic funeral and burial.
	   ``She's physically incapable of doing anything more than nodding
her head and shaking it, it's all so new to her,'' he said. ``But
she was adamant that it all be Catholic. On that point, she had no
hesitation.''
	   Members of the Protestant Orange Order shied away from
confrontation Monday in marches across Northern Ireland, weighed
down by their own bitter divisions and subdued by the shock of the
deaths of the boys, who were 11, 10 and 9.
	   At hundreds of marches, Orangemen paused for silence in respect
for the siblings.
	   But skirmishes between security forces and protesters on the
barricade which stands between the marchers and their goal resumed
early Tuesday, but the level of violence was mild compared with
previous nights, police said.
	   Officers were beaten back by fireworks and gasoline bombs as
they attempted to get at three masked protesters pulling metal
sheeting from the barricade and police responded with plastic
bullets.
	   After a speech by Protestant leader Ian Paisley, thousands of
protesters left in droves, with less than 200 remaining on site
overnight, by far the smallest gathering since the standoff began.

112 uranium mine protesters arrested at Jabiluka
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Police arrested more than 100
protesters Tuesday at Energy Resources of Australia's Jabiluka mine
development at Kakadu, a world heritage listed area in the Northern
Territory.
	   The 112 were among 130 who entered a machinery compound at dawn,
according to a statement issued by the protesters. Of these 130, 20
``locked on'' to machinery in the compound.
	   The protesters, who have been campaigning at the site since
March, want development of the Jabiluka mine stopped.
	   The arrests Tuesday bring the total since the protest action
began to about 350.
	   ERA has identified more than 90,000 metric tons of uranium oxide
in ore at Jabiluka and plans to mine the deposit over 30 years.
	   The company already mines uranium ore at the nearby Ranger mine.
	   Philip Shirvington, ERA's chief executive, has said independent
scientific studies have found no adverse impact on the environment
from uranium mining at Ranger.

U.S. manages compromise statement on Israel
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comment from Palestinian representative; adds new
Richardson quotes. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The United States managed to head off a
Security Council resolution that would have condemned Israel for
trying to expand Jerusalem's boundaries.
	   The 15-member council instead approved a compromise presidential
statement that calls Israel's June 21 decision ``a serious and
damaging development.'' It also calls on Israel not to proceed with
the expansion of Jerusalem's boundaries.
	   Heading into the late-night council meeting Monday, U.S.
Ambassador Bill Richardson called the statement appropriate.
	   ``We had a choice: a presidential statement that was consensus,
that is moderate, or vetoing a resolution condemning Israel, which
would have exacerbated tensions,'' he said. ``The outcome ... sends
the message of support for the Middle East peace process.''
	   An Arab-sponsored resolution would have condemned Israel for the
move and demanded that the expansion decision be rescinded. The
measure was softened to a presidential statement after repeated
U.S. objections and intense, high-level negotiations between
Washington and Arab capitals, said the U.S. official, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
	   Such a statement doesn't carry the weight of international law
that a resolution does and is adopted by consensus.
	   The Palestinians' U.N. representative, Nasser al-Kidwa, said he
was pleased to have a document that took Israel to task for the
move _ even if he didn't get the resolution Arab states had wanted.
	   ``I think it's a good step forward,'' al-Kidwa said. ``The
council qualified the Israeli action as serious and damaging. It
calls upon the Israeli government not to proceed with its
decision.''
	   Richardson has said the United States regretted Israel's
decision to extend Jerusalem's boundaries to include several towns
and expand some municipal services from Jerusalem to West Bank
settlements. However, a U.N. resolution condemning the move would
inflame passions and hinder U.S. diplomatic efforts to revive the
stalled Middle East peace process, he has said.
	   Washington could have vetoed a resolution, but doing so is
considered a diplomatic setback because it would have implied that
Washington couldn't negotiate a compromise.
	   The draft statement said it supported U.S. efforts at breaking
the deadlock.
	   It noted that both the Palestinians and Israel agreed in
previous peace accords that permanent status negotiations would
cover the issue of Jerusalem, which the Palestinians want as the
capital of a future state.
	   ``The council therefore calls upon the parties to avoid actions
which might prejudice the outcome of these negotiations,'' the
draft said.
	   Israeli's U.N. ambassador, Dore Gold, said the council should
never have taken up the issue, which he has called a municipal one
that had no place before the council.
	   ``From 1948 to 1967, the U.N. Security Council never met once to
consider the destruction of 58 synagogues in the Old City of
Jerusalem, the expulsion of its Jewish inhabitants and the denial
of Jewish access to the Western Wall,'' he said in a telephone
interview.
	   He said the statement actually ``contravenes the Oslo peace
agreements, which provide that Jerusalem remains under exclusive
Israeli jurisdiction while being an issue for permanent status
negotiations.''
	   Israel maintains that as a municipal decision, the June 21 move
is preserving and protecting the city _ not altering it _ and is
acting in accordance with the Oslo agreements.
	   Israeli diplomats, speaking on condition that they not be
identified, said Israel recognized that the Palestinians didn't
reach their original goal by passing a resolution. They emphasized
that what was important was for both sides to get on with permanent
status negotiations.

Philippine Airlines gets OK for asset disposal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Cash-strapped Philippine Airlines
received approval Tuesday to dispose of about dlrs 1.75 million in
assets to raise money for its operations.
	   The assets to be sold include two unused flight control
computers, a boiler unit, nine new tow trucks, and aircraft parts.
They will be returned to suppliers for refunds, the airline said.
	   The Securities and Exchange Commission approved the disposal on
the condition that the money be used strictly for the airline's
operations.
	   All asset sales and disposals by Philippine Airlines beyond 3
million pesos (dlrs 71,500) now require approval from the SEC,
after the airline secured the commission's intercession last month
for a rehabilitation plan.
	   The airline has been in the red for some time. But the Asian
financial crisis and a recent devastating pilots' strike further
affected its operations, hurting its ability to pay maturing
obligations.
	   Philippine Airlines has 85 billion pesos (dlrs 2 billion) in
outstanding debt, incurred largely from a recent refleeting and
modernization program.

	   RAS AL-KHAIMAH, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ An Azerbaijani cargo
aircraft burst into flames shortly after take off and crashed into
the sea, the Emirates News Agency reported Tuesday.
	   The fate of the eight crew members aboard the Ilyushin-76 was
not immediately known, the agency said.
	   The plane took off from the airport at the emirate of Ras
al-Khaimah at 23:30 p.m (1930 GMT) Monday. Eyewitnesses said they
saw it catch fire before crashing into the sea 500 meters (550
yards) from shore, the agency said.
	   Medical and rescue teams have rushed to the crash site, but
there was no word of any survivors.
	   An official at the coast guard of Ras al-Khaimah, an emirate at
the northern tip of the United Arab Emirates, said 60 people
including a dozen scuba divers were involved in the rescue effort.
	   An airport official said that diving teams initially had
difficulty getting close to the plane due to the heat of burning
wreckage.
	   ``An area of around 200 meters (220 yards) was in flames at the
time of the crash but was extinguished after 15 minutes,'' the
official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The Ras al-Khaimah airport receives about 40 flights every week
from cities in the former Soviet Union, where air safety has
declined dramatically as many cash-strapped airlines have failed to
provide adequate maintenance of aging aircraft.
	   In December, 85 people were killed when a Tajik airliner crashed
in the emirate of Sharjah.

Government announces new strategy with rebels in southern Mexico
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By ALEJANDRO RUIZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) _ Facing heavy criticism
after bloody raids on towns that support a rebel movement, the
government of Mexico's southern Chiapas state announced a new peace
strategy that relies on political, not military, muscle.
	   In a statement Monday night, Gov. Roberto Albores Guillen called
for setting up ``transitional juntas'' in 32 towns that have formed
parallel, largely symbolic councils that support the rebels. He
also called for disarming all ``armed civilian groups.''
	   But the plan offered little to please supporters of the
Zapatista National Liberation Army. The governor didn't say who
would make up the planned juntas, and he didn't specify what he
meant by ``armed civilian groups.''
	   Albores Guillen has always denied the existence of
pro-government paramilitary groups in the state, although reporters
have interviewed members of the groups and some soldiers have
admitted helping train them.
	   The governor also said he had instructed the state attorney
general to take another look at cases against people arrested in
government raids on two rebel-supporting towns ``so that ... the
detained can have their freedom without delay.''
	   But he didn't mention those arrested in another raid in the
municipality of El Bosque, by far the bloodiest of the four attacks
on rebel-supporting towns this year. Nine Zapatista supporters and
a policeman were killed in the June 10 attack.
	   The raids caused an outcry among human rights groups and some
federal lawmakers, who denounced them as a ``second massacre''
after the Dec. 22 killings by a paramilitary group of 45 Indians in
a hamlet that had aligned itself with the rebels.
	   The new plan follows another state proposal for peace early this
year that failed to reduce tensions between the government and
rebel supporters.
	   The Zapatistas rose up on Jan. 1, 1994, and fought a brief war
with government troops. The two sides soon began negotiations, but
those stalled on Sept. 2, 1996, when the Zapatistas accused the
government of reneging on written promises to grant Indians more
autonomy.
	   In the new plan, the governor proposed transitional governments
to replace the autonomous, parallel councils in towns that support
the rebels.
	   The new juntas would have authority until local Oct. 4 elections
in all 111 municipalities in Chiapas. He did not say who would
appoint their members.
	   Albores Guillen also did not specify whether his proposal to
disarm ``civilian armed groups'' would include the pro-government
paramilitary groups that train in Indian hamlets around Chiapas. He
said only that the disarming would be carried out ``without
distinguishing between political, ideological or religious
affiliation.''
	   There was no immediate reaction from the Zapatistas or their
supporters.

U.S. delegation says Cambodian electoral process ``flawed''
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBIN McDOWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The groups which will assess the
credibility of Cambodia's upcoming elections for the United States
blasted on Tuesday the process leading up to the polls as
``fundamentally flawed.''
	   But a delegation from the National Democratic Institute for
International Affairs and the International Republican Institute
said that despite the concerns it will send observers to Cambodia
to monitor the elections.
	   The two groups are Washington D.C.-based nonprofit organizations
which have worked to strengthen democracy in Cambodia since 1992.
	   ``The process leading up to the elections scheduled for July 26
is fundamentally flawed,'' the groups said in a statement following
a fourth assessment of Cambodia's political environment since the
country's top leader, Hun Sen, ousted Prince Norodom Ranariddh as
his co-premier in a bloody coup last year.
	   The groups said that Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party enjoyed
exclusive control over the military, security forces, civil
service, electronic media and electoral administration.
	   They also noted political violence and intimidation, especially
in the countryside, with no efforts by the authorities to arrest
those responsible.
	   The groups said they took into account not just the campaign
period but the larger political environment in which the elections
are taking place and the effects of that environment on the
electoral process.
	   The NDI-IRI warned that ``acquiescence to seriously flawed
elections will only contribute to a deterioration of the political
environment and undermine genuine efforts to advance Cambodia's
democracy.''
	   In an effort to win back legitimacy and aid, Hun Sen has called
for new elections July 26 and is allowing Ranariddh, who was chased
into exile for nine months after he was deposed, to participate.
	   Opponents of Hun Sen say he is trying to ensure victory in the
upcoming polls by using violence, including murder, and
intimidation, and was also rigging the electoral machinery in his
favor.
	   The NDI-IRI delegation noted that despite the obstacles,
political parties and prospective voters were actively
participating in the electoral process, and that ``outcome is not a
forgone conclusion and it merits international attention.''
	   It recommended that the international community deploy as many
election monitors as possible.
	   ``The international community, which encouraged the exiled
political opposition to return and participate in the campaign,
should closely monitor the entire election process,'' it wrote.
``This should include monitoring the post-election period.''
	   The U.S. has said it will issue an independent judgment of
whether Cambodia's elections are free and fair and won't be bound
by the assessment of an international umbrella group of observers.
	   Washington has already shown indications of drawing a harder
line in the elections than other international players involved in
the polls, refusing to supply direct election aid to Hun Sen's
government

Four home runs key Rockies' win over Padres, 9-5
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DENVER (AP) _ Vinny Castilla, Larry Walker, Ellis Burks and Todd
Helton hit solo home runs Monday night as the Colorado Rockies ran
their winning streak to a season-high four games with a 9-5 victory
over the San Diego Padres.
	   Tony Gwynn, in the midst of the longest slump of his career, did
not start for the Padres. The eight-time NL batting champion
pinch-hit in the eighth inning and flied out, making him 0-for-18.
	   Greg Vaughn had a three-run double for San Diego, making it 4-1
in the third.
	   Bobby Jones (3-3) overcame wildness problems to get the win,
going six innings and allowing five runs and five hits.
	   San Diego scored in the second when Vaughn walked, Jim Leyritz
doubled and Ruben Rivera had an RBI groundout. Colorado countered
in the bottom half on Helton's 14th homer, off Sterling Hitchcock
(4-3).
 &UR; Brewers 4, Phillies 2
	   In Milwaukee, Marc Newfield homered, doubled and drove in two
runs in a rare start as the Milwaukee Brewers ended the
Philadelphia Phillies' six-game winning streak.
	   Steve Woodard (6-5) allowed two runs and seven hits in 6 1-3
innings in helping prevent Philadelphia from winning seven straight
for the first time since May 1995.
	   Bob Wickman pitched the ninth for his 13th save in 14 chances.
Tyler Green (6-5) took the loss.
 &UR; Pirates 6, Cubs 2
	   In Pittsburgh, Jon Lieber limited Chicago to one run in 7 1-3
innings and the Pittsburgh Pirates, apparently responding to a
players-only meeting, beat the Cubs to halt a six-game losing
streak.
	   Tony Womack hit an inside-the-park homer and drove in two runs
as the Pirates, losers of eight of nine and 11 of 13, won their
first since July 2. They had won only twice in their previous 12
home games.
	   Lieber (6-10) became only the second Pittsburgh starter to win
in a span of 14 games. Jeremi Gonzalez (7-6) had won four straight
decisions.
 &UR; Reds 6, Cardinals 5, 13 innings
	   In St. Louis, Eduardo Perez RBI single in the 13th inning gave
the Cincinnati Reds their eighth straight win, a come-from-behind
decision against the St. Louis Cardinals.
	   Mark McGwire, who homered twice Sunday to increase his major
league-leading total to 40, went 0-for-3 with three walks. McGwire
popped out to center with two on and two outs in the ninth and he
was intentionally walked with one out and nobody on in the 12th.
	   St. Louis manager Tony La Russa said McGwire will not start
Tuesday night.
	   Bret Boone opened the 11th with a double off Bobby Witt (0-1)
and scored one out later on Perez's single to right.
	   Gabe White (3-3) pitched three scoreless innings as the Reds won
for the 13th time in 14 games.
	   Ron Gant homered for the third consecutive game for the
Cardinals, who had a three-game winning streak snapped.
	   The Reds scored two runs in the ninth off Jeff Brantley, who
they traded away this winter, to tie the game at 5.
 &UR; Dodgers 7, Giants 5
	   In Los Angeles, Eric Karros and Raul Mondesi homered during a
four-run first inning and Gary Sheffield had three hits as the Los
Angeles Dodgers beat the San Francisco Giants.
	   Dave Mlicki (5-4) allowed four runs and eight hits in 6 2-3
innings, sending the Giants to their fourth straight loss. Mlicki
is 4-0 in seven starts since coming over in the trade that sent
Hideo Nomo to the Mets.
	   Jeff Shaw pitched the ninth for his 24th save and first since
joining the Dodgers.
	   Danny Darwin (6-6) gave up seven runs and a season-high 11 hits
in 5 2-3 innings, making him 0-3 in his last five outings. The
42-year-old right-hander absorbed his first career loss at Dodger
Stadium, where he was 4-0 with a 1.38 ERA in 12 appearances.
 &UR; Marlins 8, Expos 7
	   In Miami, first baseman Brad Fullmer's throwing error allowed
Edgar Renteria to score in the ninth inning, and the Florida
Marlins extended their winning streak to a season-high four games
with a victory over the Montreal Expos.
	   Florida won for the sixth time in seven games. The start of the
game was delayed 2 hours, 20 minutes because of rain.
	   Renteria led off the ninth against Anthony Telford (3-3) with
his third single and moved to second on Mark Kotsay's sacrifice.
	   Todd Zeile hit a grounder and Renteria held as third baseman
Shane Andrews threw to first for the out. Renteria broke after
Andrews' throw, and Fullmer's rushed throw was wide of third and
allowed the winning run to score.
	   Antonio Alfonseca (2-2) was the winner.

Azeri cargo plane crashes off Emirates coast

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with four bodies recovered &QL;

<TEXT>
	   RAS AL-KHAIMAH, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ An Azerbaijani cargo
aircraft burst into flames shortly after take off and crashed into
the sea, the Emirates News Agency reported Tuesday.
	   Scuba divers recovered the bodies of four of the eight crew
members aboard the Ilyushin-76, said a coast guard official
speaking on condition of anonymity. Divers found the bodies early
Tuesday morning.
	   The plane took off from the airport at the emirate of Ras
al-Khaimah at 23:30 p.m (1930 GMT) Monday. Eyewitnesses said they
saw it catch fire before crashing into the sea 500 meters (550
yards) from shore, the agency said.
	   Medical and rescue teams rushed to the crash site, but there was
no word of any survivors.
	   An official at the coast guard of Ras al-Khaimah, an emirate at
the northern tip of the United Arab Emirates, said 60 people were
involved in the rescue effort.
	   An airport official said that diving teams initially had
difficulty getting close to the plane due to the heat of burning
wreckage.
	   ``An area of around 200 meters (220 yards) was in flames at the
time of the crash but was extinguished after 15 minutes,'' the
official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The Ras al-Khaimah airport receives about 40 flights every week
from cities in the former Soviet Union, where air safety has
declined dramatically as many cash-strapped airlines have failed to
provide adequate maintenance of aging aircraft.
	   In December, 85 people were killed when a Tajik airliner crashed
in the emirate of Sharjah.

	   In Phoenix, rookie Danny Klassen atoned for his costly error
moments earlier with a go-ahead home run in a heated fifth inning
to help the Arizona Diamondbacks beat the Houston Astros.

Kiriyenko says Russia will have no problem repaying new loans
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo TOK103
 &UR; By TODD ZAUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Russian Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko said
Tuesday that Russia would have no problems repaying a new package
of international loans designed to stabilize the country's troubled
financial markets.
	   Kiriyenko, speaking at the close of two-day visit to Tokyo,
welcomed Monday's agreement with the International Monetary Fund
and other lenders for dlrs 17.1 billion in loans to help see Russia
through its latest financial turmoil.
	   Asked if Russia would have any trouble repaying the new loans,
Kiriyenko replied, ``There is no danger of that.''
	   ``Our biggest problem isn't debt, but that for such a long time
we have lived beyond our means,'' he told a press conference.
	   ``IMF aid is very important, but we shouldn't overestimate it.
The most important thing is to balance spending and income.''
	   On Monday, Japan said it would contribute to the package,
agreeing to provide a dlrs 800 million loan to Russia from its
Export-Import Bank. The money was part of a dlrs 1.5 billion untied
loan that Japan had promised.
	   The new agreements, including lending from the World Bank,
brings the total committed to Russia in 1998 an 1999 to dlrs 22.6
billion.
	   With millions of Russians facing poverty due to the country's
economic woes the loans provide a desperately needed infusion of
cash.
	   Kiriyenko arrived in Tokyo on Monday to discuss ways to increase
economic ties that he said could bolster growth in both Russia and
Japan.
	   On Tuesday, the 35-year old premier said the two countries
agreed to cooperate on oil and natural gas development in Siberia.
	   ``Energy needs in the Asia-Pacific region are increasing and
joint development by Russia and Japan will contribute to security
throughout the region,'' he said.
	   Kiriyenko arrived Monday just as political turmoil in Japan was
peaking following a defeat Sunday by the ruling Liberal Democratic
Party in parliamentary elections.
	   Just hours before Kiriyenko's meeting with his Japanese
counterpart, Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto announced he would
resign to take responsibility for the electoral setback.
	   But Kiriyenko, the first Russian premier to visit Japan, said
political uncertainty wouldn't hurt ties between the two countries.
	   ``We confirmed that despite political changes in both countries
the foundation of our relationship has not changed,'' Kiriyenko
said.
	   He said he would welcome the new Japanese prime minister to
Russia in the fall _ a trip that had been planned for Hashimoto.
	   Hashimoto said that he and Kiriyenko agreed at their meeting to
set up a joint investment facility to help the Russian economy.
	   Hashimoto, with strong personal ties to Russian President Boris
Yeltsin, has been a key force behind the increasingly friendly
atmosphere between the two countries, which have never signed a
peace treaty formally ending World War II.
	   After leaving Japan Tuesday, Kiriyenko was to travel to China.

South Korean workers launch nationwide strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Tens of thousands of auto,
shipbuilding and other metal workers walked off their jobs Tuesday,
joining in a nationwide strike called to protest spreading layoffs.
	   While concerned about its negative impact on the economy as a
whole, government officials said the strike was not expected to
seriously hurt the affected industries.
	   Lee Soo-young, a Labor Ministry spokesman, noted that most of
the industries hit by the strike already have large inventories of
unsold goods and can easily absorb the walkout.
	   ``What we are worried about is its psychological impact on
foreign investors,'' Lee said.
	   Government officials have consistently said that wooing back
foreign investors who fled in the face of last year's currency
crisis is the only way to revive South Korea's battered economy.
	   Thousands of financially shaky companies have collapsed since
the government accepted a dlrs 58 billion bailout of the economy in
December and began the task of restructuring. The number of jobless
has doubled to 1.5 million and will likely top 2 million by the end
of the year.
	   In a rare show of solidarity, the mainstream Federation of
Korean Trade Unions and the militant Korean Confederation of Trade
Unions joined hands to organize this week's strikes.
	   ``We cannot accept layoffs. They threaten our livelihood,'' said
Sohn Nak-koo, a spokesman for the confederation.
	   Organizers said about 55,000 workers from 22 plants launched
Tuesday's strikes. They will be joined Wednesday by 50,000 more
workers, mostly from banking and state-run companies being offered
for sale, they said.
	   All except the 26,000 workers from the nation's leading auto
firm, Hyundai Motors Co., were scheduled to walk off their jobs for
three days. The Hyundai strike was indefinite.

	   In Seatle, Edgar Martinez homered twice and Ken Griffey Jr. made
a spectacular catch with his back to home plate for Seattle.
	   The Rangers had three errors and remained a half-game behind
first-place Anaheim in the AL West.
	   After Griffey's RBI single, Martinez hit a three-run homer to
cap a four-run first off Todd Van Poppel (1-2). Martinez led off
the sixth with a solo homer, his 17th, to make it 9-3.
	   Griffey, who had an RBI fielder's choice in the fourth when
Seattle scored three runs, made a basket catch of Will Clark's
towering fly ball while running toward the fence in the fifth and
received a standing ovation from 25,170 fans in the Kingdome at the
end of the inning.
	   Ken Cloude (5-7) allowed eight hits in a career-best eight
innings.
 &UR; Athletics 5, Angels 2 &QC; 
	   In Oakland, California, Mike Oquist pitched seven strong innings
and Kevin Mitchell hit a three-run homer for Oakland.
	   Oquist (6-5), who won at Anaheim in his last start, allowed
seven hits in seven-plus innings. Bill Taylor pitched the ninth for
his 20th save.
	   The Angels have lost nine of their last 11 games.
	   Jarrod Washburn (4-2) pitched six innings, allowing five runs on
eight hits.

 &UR; Pakistani surgeon wins Magsaysay prize for government service

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A Pakistani surgeon who provides
modern medical service to poor people for free was named winner
Tuesday of the 1998 Ramon Magsaysay Award for government service.
	   Adibul Hasan Rizvi, director of Karachi's Sindh Institute of
Urology and Transplantation, is the first of five winners to be
named this year.
	   The awards board cited Rizvi for ``transcending the limits of a
public service hospital to make kidney dialysis, renal transplants,
and other life-saving medical services available free to thousands
of Pakistani citizens.''
	   Rizvi began the institute in 1972 as an eight-bed extension of
the burns ward of the Civil Hospital in Karachi, Pakistan's largest
city. The project was expanded and granted institute status in
1991.
	   The institute became one of the fastest growing urological and
transplant centers in the region and one of the few to provide free
medical service for poor people with kidney and related disorders.
	   More than 10 million Pakistanis are believed to be suffering
from kidney and related diseases. About 13,000 of them die each
year because they cannot afford the expensive treatment, which
normally ranges from dlrs 1,000 to dlrs 100,000.
	   Four other recipients of this year's Magsaysay Award will be
chosen in the areas of international understanding, community
leadership, public service and journalism, literature and creative
arts.
	   They will be honored at the 40th presentation ceremonies in
Manila on Aug. 31, the birth date of Magsaysay, a popular
Philippine president who died in a plane crash in 1957.
	   The winners of the award, considered the Asian equivalent of the
Nobel Prize, each receive a certificate, medallion and dlrs 50,000.

NFL pioneer and Hall-of-Famer `Red' Badgro dead at 95
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo SE1 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SEATTLE (AP) _ Morris ``Red'' Badgro, a Hall of Famer who caught
the first touchdown pass of the first NFL championship game in
1933, died Monday at the age of 95.
	   He had been hospitalized briefly after a fall in Kent, a suburb
south of Seattle.
	   A four-time All-NFL selection who played end on offense and
defense, Badgro was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1981 when he
was 78.
	   Badgro played basketball, football and baseball at the
University of Southern California. After college he played with the
football New York Yankees in 1927, the minor league baseball team
in Tulsa, Okla., in 1928, and the old St. Louis Browns of the
American League in 1929 and 1930 as a utility outfielder.
	   Returning to the NFL, he played for the New York Giants in
1930-35 and the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1936. Later, he held college
coaching jobs at Columbia University and the University of
Washington.
	   In the 1933 championship game, he caught a 29-yard pass from
Harry Newman for a touchdown that gave the New York Giants a 7-6
lead.
	   However, he said in 1994 that it always bothered him that he
failed to score on the last play of the game. He could not get past
Harold ``Red'' Grange and the Giants lost to the Chicago Bears
23-21.

Bankruptcies rising at fastest pace since World War II
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Fueled by a recession and shrinking access to
credit, Japanese corporate bankruptcies are rising at their fastest
pace since the end of World War II, a private credit research
agency said Tuesday.
	   The number of companies that failed in June rose 29.1 percent
from a year earlier to 1,741, the most ever recorded for the month,
Teikoku Databank Ltd. announced.
	   ``The economy has entered a vicious spiral of recession,'' the
agency said in a report.
	   Government measures to revive the economy have come too late,
creating a sense of disappointment in financial markets that has
prompted banks to curtail lending, it said.
	   Debt left behind by bankrupt companies in June soared 237.5
percent to 1.36 trillion yen (dlrs 9.7 billion) also the highest
level for any June.
	   Teikoku also said that bankruptcy cases for the first six months

Accused sex tourist denies child sex in Cambodia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ The first man in the state of Western
Australia to be charged with sex tourism offenses on Tuesday denied
having sex with a girl and taking pornographic photographs of
children in Cambodia.
	   John Arthur Lee, 43, pleaded innocent in the Perth District
Court to one charge of having sex with an underage girl and eight
counts of indecently dealing with underage girls.
	   He also denied 17 counts of possessing child pornography at his
former home, one count of displaying child pornography and one
count of indecently dealing with a child in Perth in January last
year.
	   Judge David Charters renewed Lee's bail of U.S. dlrs 13,600
(22,000 Australian dollars) and ordered him to appear in court
again on Sept. 21, but Lee remained in custody as he could not meet
bail.
	   Prosecutor Stephen Hall told an earlier court hearing Lee
traveled to Cambodia for an eight-week holiday in January last
year.
	   During that time the prosecution alleged he took or instructed
someone else to take photographs of Cambodian girls as young as 11,
in various sexual positions.
	   It also was alleged Lee had sex with one of the girls.
	   Police found photographs when they searched Lee's flat and car
after he showed them to work colleagues, the court heard.
	   They seized two albums containing dozens of photographs of Lee
and semi-naked and naked girls, Hall said.

Greenspan urges Japan to resolve bad debt problems quickly
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said
Tuesday that Japan should move quickly to clean up bad loans in its
financial system, a Japanese Finance Ministry official said.
	   Greenspan made his remarks in a meeting with Finance Minister
Hikaru Matsunaga in Tokyo, said a senior ministry official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   ``Resolution of the bad debt problem is very important,'' the
official quoted Greenspan as telling Matsunaga.
	   Japanese banks are saddled with more than 77 trillion yen (dlrs
546 billion) in bad loans, making them reluctant to extend fresh
loans and hampering the nation's economic recovery.
	   ``Finally, getting the underlying land collateral off the books
is (also) important,'' Greenspan was quoted as telling the finance
minister.
	   Matsunaga explained to the Fed chairman Japan's plans to shore
up its ailing financial system.
	   Japan's scheme, dubbed the ``Total Plan'' includes a panel to
resolve disputes over ownership of bad debt collateral.
	   During the meeting with Matsunaga, Greenspan also explained the
U.S. experience with cleaning up bad debts at savings and loan
institutions and banks in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the
official said.
	   Matsunaga stressed that Japan's plans for financial system
reform will continue under the new administration.
	   On Monday, Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto announced he would
resign in the wake of his party's stunning defeat in Sunday's
elections for the upper house of Parliament.
	   Greenspan is currently in Japan after attending Monday's one-day
meeting of the Bank for International Settlements.

Ramos says return of Marcos ``cronies'' could scare off investors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By OLIVER TEVES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippines' former president
warned Tuesday that foreign investors could be scared off by the
return of ``cronies'' of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos to
positions of power under new President Joseph Estrada.
	   Former President Fidel Ramos said investors will be concerned
about whether the new government, which took office June 30, is
blocking free competition by practicing favoritism toward the
former ``cronies.''
	   ``In a level playing ground ... friends of the administration
will not be given priority or special favors,'' Ramos said in a
radio interview.
	   It was the first time that Ramos has commented publicly since
stepping down on policies regarding the recovery of the alleged
ill-gotten wealth of Marcos and his close associates.
	   Critics say Estrada has allowed Marcos' associates to regain
control of the business empires they built with help from Marcos
but lost after the former dictator was toppled in a ``people
power'' revolt 12 years ago.
	   One of the most powerful people under the Marcos administration,
business tycoon Eduardo Cojuangco Jr., recently regained the
chairmanship of San Miguel Corp., the Philippines' largest food and
beverage conglomerate.
	   Cojuangco's shares in San Miguel were seized by the government
after Marcos' ouster on suspicion they were obtained illegally.
However, a court ruled this year that he could cast votes for
directors based on his contested 20 percent stake in the company.
	   Estrada, however, said charges of a resurgence of ``cronyism''
are ``fabricated and flimsy.''
	   ``Not one of the cronies is back,'' he said in reaction to
Ramos' statements.
	   He said it was under former President Corazon Aquino that
Cojuangco, who fled the country with Marcos, returned to the
Philippines, and under Ramos that Cojuangco won back his vote in
San Miguel.
	   Cojuangco was one of the staunchest supporters of Estrada's
presidential bid and is chairman of Estrada's Struggle of the
Filipino Masses party.
	   Critics say Lucio Tan, another tycoon closely associated with
Marcos who reportedly backed Estrada, also could benefit from the
Estrada administration.
	   Tan, who controls troubled Philippine Airlines and has interests
in banking, tobacco and beer, allegedly owes the government 25.6
billion (dlrs 624 million) in taxes and could benefit from a tax
amnesty program being proposed by the Estrada government.

East Timor's governor calls for calm as thousands flee
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING for all needing &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The Indonesian-appointed governor of
East Timor has reportedly called for calm as thousands of people
flee the troubled territory amid fears of a new outbreak of violent
protests.
	   The exodus comes ahead of a planned visit to Indonesia later
this week by Jamsheed Marker, the United Nations' special envoy for
the former Portuguese colony.
	   Fearing attack by indigenous Timorese, at least 20,000
non-Timorese Indonesian settlers have fled since late last month.
Some have driven across the land border into West Timor. Many have
returned by boat to homes on other islands.
	   Officials and some immigrants said they were scared by possible
mass protests during Marker's visit and the 22nd anniversary on
Friday of Indonesia's annexation of the half-island territory.
	   ``I am appealing to all people from other provinces...to wisely
assess the situation,'' Gov. Abilio Soares was quoted as saying by
the Jakarta Post on Tuesday.
	   ``I ask you to report to the authorities whoever is spreading
rumors or riots and demonstrations,'' he said.
	   Several protesters have been shot to death by Indonesian troops
recently during pro-independence demonstrations. There have also
been clashes between rival groups who either want East Timor to
break away from Indonesia or to remain part of it.
	   Because of security concerns, it was unclear Tuesday whether
Marker will visit East Timor or conduct meetings elsewhere in
Indonesia.
	   Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975, and annexed it a year
later. The United Nations, Portugal and many other governments
refuse to recognize Indonesian sovereignty over the territory.
	   Over the past two decades, East Timor has endured a guerrilla
war and human rights abuses. Animosity between settlers from other
islands and indigenous Timorese is rife. Many Timorese complain
they remain poor as outsiders make money in the underdeveloped
territory.
	   Demonstrations on East Timor have intensified in recent weeks
following the resignation of ex-President Suharto in May.
	   His successor, B.J. Habibie, has promised more democracy and
offered to grant a measure of autonomy to East Timor in return for
international recognition of Indonesian sovereignty.
	   However, Habibie has rejected a demand from separatists to hold
a referendum on possible independence.
	   On Monday, the military warned East Timorese protesters not to
fly flags belonging to the Fretilin guerrilla group.

Weak yen a mixed blessing but mostly negative for Vietnam
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ A weak yen has some benefits for Vietnam,
but the impact is mostly negative and is causing ``serious
uncertainty,'' the Communist Party newspaper Nhan Dan said Tuesday.
	   ``The world cannot wait too long before taking some rescue
actions,'' it quoted Le Van Chau, chairman of the State Securities
Commission, as saying.
	   In an analysis of the Japanese currency's influence, the paper
said a weak yen means cheaper imports from Japan and easier
repayment of yen-denominated debts.
	   But it also hurts Vietnam's exports to Japan and could lead to
cuts in Japanese development assistance and foreign investment.
	   ``The first difficulties Vietnam has to face is that any
uncertainty of our partners will reverse many of our strategic
plans,'' Chau said.
	   ``The mounting pressure of the yen on the regional currencies
creates new danger of recession and uncertainty. We have to take
into account this factor in working out our strategy to limit the
impact of the regional crisis.''
	   Last year, Vietnam had exports worth 264.4 billion yen (dlrs
1.87 billion at current exchange rates) to Japan and imports of
154.8 billion yen (dlrs 1.1 billion).
	   Initially, Vietnam was not hit as hard as some of its neighbors
by the Asian economic crisis, and it has not permitted its currency
to fall as far.
	   But exports and foreign investment are shrinking as unemployment
is rising. The government has been making promises recently to
speed up the decade-old Doi Moi economic reforms.

Military chief orders troops to watch for early signs of trouble
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The capital's newly-appointed military
commander has ordered his troops to watch for early signs of unrest
as the worst economic crisis in 30 years continues to bite, the
Jakarta Post reported Tuesday.
	   Jakarta, a city of about 10 million, was rocked by protests and
riots in May that helped oust former President Suharto, ending 32
years of autocratic rule.
	   At the time, Jakarta's security forces, under a different
commander, were criticized for not taking swift action to quell the
violence, in which about 1,200 people were killed.
	   Angry mobs targeted members of the ethnic Chinese community.
Hundreds of Chinese-owned stores and homes were burned and women's
groups say scores of Chinese women and girls were raped.
	   Some indigenous Indonesians have made Chinese people the
scapegoats for rising unemployment and soaring inflation.
	   Some fear that violence might return to the streets if the
economic situation worsens.
	   Speaking after he was sworn in Monday, Maj. Gen. Djadja
Suparman, 49, said his troops would work ``hand-in-hand'' with all
residents of Jakarta, regardless of their social and cultural
backgrounds.
	   ``The riots, destruction, looting and arson in Jakarta and other
regions in mid-May are still fresh in our minds,'' he said. ``We
all realize now that the tragedy could degrade Indonesia's positive
image in the international community and damage our political and
economic growth.''
	   Djadja's appointment is one of several key command changes made
since the riots by the head of the military, Gen. Wiranto.
	   Some analysts have said Wiranto has tried to protect his own
position. Nevertheless, he maintains the command changes are
routine and in line with procedures.

Singapore court gives stiff sentences to two oil spill captains
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JONATHAN DRAKE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A Singapore court handed down stiff sentences
including imprisonment on Tuesday to the captains of two tankers
that collided last year in the busy port city's worst oil spill.
	   On October 15, the Thai supertanker Orapin Global and the
Cypriot oil tanker Evoikos collided in the Singapore Strait,
dumping about 29,000 tons of heavy fuel oil.
	   Michael Chalkitis, the 58-year old Greek captain of the
fully-laden Evoikos, was sentenced Tuesday in subordinate court to
three months imprisonment and fined the maximum total of 60,000
Singapore dollars (dlrs 35,100).
	   The empty Orapin Global's 54-year old Polish captain, Jan
Sokolowski, received a two month jail term and the maximum combined
fine of 11,000 Singapore dollars (dlrs 6,400).
	   Sokolowski pleaded guilty on June 29 to charges under the
Merchant Shipping Act and Penal Code of excessive speed and
negligent navigation.
	   Only four days later in the joint trial, Chalkitis also pleaded
guilty to charges of not taking timely action to avoid the
collision and failing to keep a proper look-out, both under the
Merchant Shipping Act.
	   Noting that the cost of the spill ran into the tens of millions,
District Judge Adrian Soon said ``offenses associated with the
violation of safety regulations ... must be treated firmly and with
utmost severity.''
	   Both captain's punishments would act to deter others from
breaking shipping and public safety laws in the future, he added.
	   Some 16 government and private organizations, 650 workers and a
total of 80 boats joined in a massive clean-up after the accident,
which occurred when the Orapin Global was traveling in the wrong
lane and the Evoikos also strayed into opposing traffic.
	   Both captains had been warned repeatedly by Singapore port
authorities of a possible collision for several minutes before they
ran into each other.
	   Chalkitis has appealed the prison sentence but will pay the
fine. Sokolowski had not yet decided whether to appeal any portion
of his punishment.
	   The matter does not end with the two captains' punishment,
however. The ship owners are claiming damages against one another
and the owners of Evoikos' cargo are also seeking compensation.
	   In addition, there will be claims by various parties, such as
Singapore's Maritime and Port Authority, for the cost of the
clean-up operation, estimated at 30 million Singapore dollars (dlrs
17.5 million). Other ships and businesses affected by the spill are
also suing for damages.

Human rights group says 20 rape victims died in Indonesia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A human rights group has alleged that
20 women died after they were raped along with more than 100 others
during recent riots, a news report said Tuesday.
	   The Jakarta Post newspaper quoted activists from the Volunteers
for Humanity group as saying they had documented evidence that 168
girls and women were raped when rioting broke out in mid-May and as
sporadic unrest continued through to July 3 in Jakarta and four
other cities.
	   Details of the attacks were presented to Indonesia's National
Rights Commission.
	   In a report, the group alleged that 20 rape victims were
murdered by their assailants, left to die in burning buildings or
later died of wounds inflicted when they were attacked.
	   It cited the case of a 9-year-old girl who was raped by a gang
that mutilated her genitals. She died several days later in a
Singapore hospital.
	   The report backed claims by other human rights groups that many
of those attacked were members of Indonesia's ethnic Chinese
minority.
	   Chinese make up a small fraction of Indonesia's 202 million
population. But they dominate industry and commerce and have become
the scapegoats for the worst economic crisis in 30 years.
	   Many are Christians and Buddhists while most other Indonesians
are Muslims.
	   Women's activists say rape was used as a way to terrorize the
Chinese community.
	   The riots in May led to the resignation of President Suharto
after 32 years in power.
	   Since then, his successor President B.J. Habibie has set up an
anti-rape task force.
	   Last week, the National Human Rights Commission accused
Suharto's government and the military of not doing enough to
protect women during the outbreak of violence.

Mild earthquakes shake Myanmar and Thailand
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Two mild earthquakes rumbled through
Myanmar early Tuesday, the Earthquake Division of Thailand's
Meteorological Department said.
	   The quakes followed two mild temblors that shook northern
Thailand on Monday.
	   The Thai quakes had magnitudes of 4.1 and 3.5 and were centered
in the Fang district of Chiang Mai province, 580 kilometers (360
miles) north of Bangkok.
	   The division said it had not yet determined the magnitude of the
Myanmar quakes.
	   Damages have yet to be reported, but the earthquakes were
believed to have been centered in lightly populated areas.
	   Several fault lines run through northern Thailand and also along
the Myanmar-China border, although major quakes usually don't
strike the area.

Southeast Asian bloc launches website, plans satellite channel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Seeking a collective voice, information
ministers from 10 Southeast Asian nations agreed Tuesday to
establish a satellite television channel and launch a website on
the internet.
	   ``We're not criticizing the Western media,'' said General George
Yeo, Singapore's minister of information and the arts, ``but this
will enable us to have our collective voice in the world.''
	   The satellite channel is planned for the year 2000, but the
internet website promoting the region's culture was launched on
Monday.
	   The ten ministers met in Bangkok over the past two days at the
5th Conference of ASEAN Ministers Responsible for Information.
	   ASEAN, or the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, groups
Brunei Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. Cambodia's minister also attended
the meeting.
	   Many ministers expressed unhappiness over how the Western media,
particularly CNN and the BBC cover their countries, saying the only
way they learn about what's happening in neighboring nations is
through media with a Western viewpoint.
	   The ASEAN satellite channel still faces several stumbling blocs,
including how to fund the project during the Asian economic crisis,
restrictions on news and information in some member states, and
language problems.
	   ``We have difficulty pronouncing each other's names, so it will
take time to establish mutual comprehensibility,'' Yeo said.
	   Supatra Masdit of Thailand said English would be the preferred
language for programming. She added that member countries would not
be allowed to censor the satellite channel.
	   Some ASEAN countries, particularly Myanmar and Vietnam, exercise
tight control over news and information and access to the internet.
	   Myanmar's Minister of Information, Gen. Kyi Aung, denied,
however, that his government censors news and said it was committed
to conforming to ASEAN's goal of freedom of information.
	   ``We are not restricting the news,'' Kyi Aung said. ``We are
broadcasting the correct news if it benefits the people.''

Special funeral planned for Northern Ireland's three lost boys

scheduled to begin at 1000 GMT

<TEXT>
	   BALLYMONEY, Northern Ireland _ A Catholic priest faced the
delicate task of laying to rest three young brothers, raised as
Protestants and killed by a sectarian firebomb in politically
charged Northern Ireland.
	   ``It is not the place to be political,'' the Rev. Peter Forde
said Monday. ``But three children who had just begun life were lent
to us, and we as a society failed in our responsibility.''
	   Forde said nothing could prepare him for the ``unnatural'' sight
of a trio of little coffins in the special funeral Mass on Tuesday,
but he hoped his carefully chosen words would make a difference to
the family of Richard, Mark and Jason Quinn, and to the watching
world.
	   The Mass was scheduled for 11 a.m. (1000 GMT) at the Church or
Our Lady and St. Patrick, with burial planned in the nearby town of
Rasharkin, where the Quinn family has its roots.
	   Irene Quinn, the boys' grandmother, said her daughter wanted
them buried in Rasharkin so she never again would have to set foot
in Ballymoney. Chrissie Quinn's oldest son, 13-year-old Lee, spent
Saturday night with his grandmother and so escaped the attack.
	   Tensions spilling over from a blocked Protestant march outside a
rural church near Portadown were blamed for the early Sunday
morning firebombing of the Quinn house. Police said they believed
the family was targeted because Chrissie Quinn lived there with her
Protestant boyfriend.
	   Two men were being questioned, police said.
	   Ms. Quinn is Catholic, but was raising the boys as Protestants
because she thought it would make life easier for them in
Ballymoney, a hard-line Protestant stronghold about 40 miles (60
kms) northwest of Belfast.
	   Forde said the boys' mother retreated into shock but she
insisted that her sons must receive a Catholic funeral and burial.
	   ``She's physically incapable of doing anything more than nodding
her head and shaking it, it's all so new to her,'' he said. ``But
she was adamant that it all be Catholic. On that point, she had no
hesitation.''
	   Members of the Protestant Orange Order shied away from
confrontation Monday in marches across Northern Ireland, weighed
down by their own bitter divisions and subdued by the shock of the
deaths of the boys, who were 11, 10 and 9.
	   At hundreds of marches, Orangemen paused for silence in respect
for the siblings.
	   But skirmishes between security forces and protesters on the
barricade which stands between the marchers and their goal resumed
early Tuesday, but the level of violence was mild compared with
previous nights, police said.
	   Officers were beaten back by fireworks and gasoline bombs as
they attempted to get at three masked protesters pulling metal
sheeting from the barricade and police responded with plastic
bullets.
	   Three Orange halls came under attack by firebombs.
	   After a speech by Protestant leader Ian Paisley, thousands of
protesters left in droves, with less than 200 remaining on site
overnight, by far the smallest gathering since the standoff began.
By morning the number had diminished to a ``handful,'' police said.

Dollar falls in Tokyo, Japanese stocks finish lower
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing Nikkei, mid-afternoon dollar and bond
prices &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar fell against the yen Tuesday on
speculation some central banks in Asia may have sold U.S. Treasury
bonds. Japanese stock prices finished higher.
	   At mid-afternoon, the dollar bought 141.28 yen in Tokyo, down
1.14 yen from late Monday and also below its late New York rate of
141.42 overnight.
	   Traders cited unconfirmed talk in the currency market that
several unidentified Asian central banks sold U.S. Treasuries
overnight as one reason for the dollar's drop against the yen.
	   Sales of Treasuries hurt the dollar because it can decrease
demand for the U.S. currency.
	   Also supporting the yen were expectations the big loss suffered
by Japan's ruling party in elections held Sunday could force the
government to take more drastic economic stimulus measures, traders
said.
	   The Liberal Democratic Party's defeat was viewed as a vote of
no-confidence in its efforts to revive Japan's moribund economy,
which has entered its worst recession since World War II.
	   But dollar-yen trading is likely to stay within a narrow range
until a successor is named for outgoing Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto, who announced his intention to resign Monday, traders
said.
	   The Liberal Democrats were expected to name a new leader on July
21.
	   Despite the setback in the upper house polls, however, the party
remains firmly in control of the government because it has a
majority in Parliament's more powerful lower house.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, share prices advanced moderately as
many investors took to the sidelines amid uncertainty over who will
succeed Hashimoto.
	   The 225-issue benchmark Nikkei Stock Average rose 128.52 points,
or 0.79 percent, closing at 16,488.91 points. On Monday, the index
had gained 270.33 points, or 1.68 percent.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 10.21 points, or 0.81 percent, to 1,266.65.
The TOPIX closed up 14.94 points, or 1.20 percent, the previous
day.
	   In fixed-income security trading, the yield on the benchmark No.
182 10-year Japanese government bond rose to 1.445 percent from
Monday's finish of 1.415 percent, driving its price down to 110.11
yen from 110.33 yen.

Philippine stocks, peso gain on stable Asian currencies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks rose Tuesday as
investors hunted for bargains with encouragement from the stable
performance of Asian currencies in morning trading, traders said.
	   The peso strengthened along with other regional currencies,
buoyed by advances in the yen, dealers said.
	   Preliminary data showed the 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange
Index rose 9.02 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,784.87, following
Monday's 26.36-point, or 1.5 percent, decline.
	   Traders said expectations of more concrete economic reforms in
Japan followed the resignation of Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto on Monday. Hashimoto stepped down to take responsibility
for his ruling Liberal Democratic Party's poor performance in
Sunday's Upper House election.
	   Another factor which aided the market's ascent Tuesday was the
decline in yields in Monday's weekly treasury bill auction, said
Jose Ricardo Garcia, vice president of Diversified Securities Inc.
	   All T-bill yields declined Monday. The bellwether 91-day T-bill
fetched an average yield of 14.756 percent, 0.165 percentage point
lower than the previous level.
	   The 91-day T-bill yields are used by banks to help determine the
interest rates they charge customers. Lower interest rates would
provide businesses cheaper access to funds and would encourage
investors to shift their money from fixed-income instruments to
other types of investments, such as stocks.
	   Despite the positive developments both here and abroad, however,
Garcia expects the market to remain generally weak.
	   ``I don't think investors would want to take the chance right
now to enter the market and take a long position. There are still a
lot of uncertainties,'' he said.
	   Hashimoto's resignation, while viewed positively, still left
some level of uncertainty in the region since it resulted in a
leadership vacuum in Japan, traders said.
	   The expectations of better prospects for Japan nevertheless
boosted Asian currencies including the peso, traders said. The
dollar averaged 41.873 pesos in morning trading, down from Monday's
42.218 pesos.
	   A trader with a foreign bank said the bulk of early transactions
were interbank dealings, with commercial demand for dollars
remaining relatively light.
	   The peso, along with other regional currencies, is expected to
closely track the yen-dollar rate, she said.
	   After pulling back from a test of the sensitive level of 42.50
pesos on Monday, the yen's advance has pulled the peso into a new
range of 41.50 pesos to 42.00 pesos to the dollar.
	   Despite the sharp drop in Treasury bill yields, the central
bank's overnight borrowing and lending rates remained at 13.125
percent and 15.125 percent respectively.

Harrods buys 50 percent of Thai offshore oil block
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The Thai subsidiary of Harrods Energy
of Britain signed an agreement Tuesday to buy a 50 percent stake in
an offshore petroleum block from the Petroleum Authority of
Thailand.
	   Harrods, owned by Egyptian magnate Mohamed Al Fayed, will take
over exploration activities, including a seismic study of the block
and drilling an exploratory well.
	   The block, labeled B5/27, is off the coast of Prachuab Khiri
Khan, 230 kilometers (143 miles) southwest of Bangkok.
	   Thailand's coastal waters are rich in deposits of natural gas
and oil, although the country's energy needs outstrip its supply,
thus making it dependent on oil from the Middle East.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Hopes were high that a new leadership would move
quickly to put Japan's ailing economy back on track after the
ruling party suffered defeat in weekend elections widely viewed as
a referendum on its fiscal policies.
	   Japanese media said the balloting for Parliament's upper house
that stripped the ruling Liberal Democrats of 17 seats showed
people wanted action to pull the nation out of its worst recession
in decades.
	   Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto resigned Monday to take
responsibility for the electoral humiliation.
	   Tokyo financial markets reflected the optimism for change.
	   After plunging on worries about political instability following
the election, the Japanese yen recovered Tuesday on hopes that
Tokyo had finally been shaken into a realization that tax cuts and
other concrete steps were needed for an economic turnaround.
	   The dollar was trading at 141.23 yen as of Tuesday midafternoon,
down 1.19 yen from late Monday. Share prices were mixed in morning
trading.
	   ``The kind of prime minister we need is someone who has
commitment and ability to face Japan's economic problems and tackle
reforms from a deep and broad viewpoint,'' the Asahi newspaper said
in an editorial Tuesday.
	   It was unclear, however, whether the Liberal Democrats were
ready for that challenge _ the party appeared more intent on its
usual infighting to get a lead in the race to replace Hashimoto.
	   Because the Liberal Democrats hold the majority in the more
powerful lower house, which chooses the prime minister, the party
president, expected to be chosen next Tuesday, becomes prime
minister.
	   The leading possible successors jockeying for power are Foreign
Minister Keizo Obuchi, 61, and former Chief Cabinet Secretary
Seiroku Kajiyama. Both are both old-style politicians in the party,
and not economic experts, although in recent months Kajiyama has
pushed more aggressively for economic reforms.
	   Kajiyama, 72, has a serious international image problem, having
made remarks that offended both the United States and Japan's Asian
neighbors.
	   In 1990, Kajiyama said prostitutes in Japan and blacks in the
United States ``ruin the atmosphere of the neighborhoods they move
into.'' He retracted the remark but later stirred up another
controversy by suggesting that women who served as sex slaves for
Japanese troops during World War II did it for the money.
	   Japanese media reported that some of the younger Liberal
Democratic lawmakers were backing outspoken 56-year-old Health
Minister Junichiro Koizumi, but he is unlikely to get enough
support from the party elders, crucial for the party presidency.
	   Koizumi said the new leader should reflect the voters' message
of anger at the party's failures.
	   ``It's no good just to change faces,'' he said.
	   Former Health Minister Naoto Kan, who leads the new Democratic
Party, is now Japan's most popular politician.
	   Kan's party, which pushed for tax cuts to stimulate the economy,
was also the biggest gainer in the weekend elections. But Kan, 51,
stands no chance of becoming prime minister, even if his party
manages to fight the odds and unite a fragmented opposition.
	   In a survey of 55 top corporate executives published Tuesday by
the Nihon Keizai newspaper, only 16 said they backed any politician
as a replacement for Hashimoto.
	   Of those, 13 tapped Kajiyama.
	   Another factor that might dampen the possibility of major
reforms is that politicians have for decades left much of the
decision-making to the powerful bureaucrats.
	   Many Japanese believe the bureaucrats stand in the way of what
is needed for a better economy, including loosening business
regulations as well as belt-tightening for smaller government.
	   Parliament is expected to choose a new prime minister later this
month. Hashimoto will serve until a successor is chosen.

Controversial women's bill stalls Indian legislature

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ A controversy over quotas for women
politicians stalled proceedings in the Indian parliament for the
second straight morning Tuesday.
	   Protests by some lawmakers on Monday kept a measure to reserve a
third of parliamentary seats for women from being introduced for
debate. The speaker tried to move on to other business Tuesday
morning, but angry shouting over the women's bill forced him to
adjourn the morning session of parliament after only a few minutes.
	   The bill, meant to increase women's participation in India's
democracy, was first introduced in 1996 by a previous government
but met with similar opposition and never came to a vote. Women
accused men in parliament of refusing to surrender any power in a
country where religious practice and tradition often keep women in
the shadows.
	   Speaker G.M.C. Balayogi had met with party leaders earlier
Tuesday to try to resolve the impasse and indicated that the
women's bill would be introduced later Tuesday. But leaders of the
parties that had staged Monday's protests said they wanted a few
days to consider how to proceed.
	   Repeated delays could jeopardize plans for parliament to vote on
the federal budget later this week.
	   Members of parties who rely on the votes of Muslims and other
minorities say they won't let the bill be considered unless it
includes quotas within the quota for the minorities they represent.
Women's groups say the quota-within-a-quota demand may be a tactic
to stall the bill rather than a legitimate attempt to help
minorities.
	   A similar measure was passed in 1995 for municipal and village
councils. Results have been mixed at the local level. Some women
politicians are merely fronts for their husbands or fathers, or
have been ousted in no-confidence votes.

Indonesia plans to import more rice, other food as prices soar
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HARIS SYAMAUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia said Tuesday it would import
more rice to alleviate a shortfall caused by a combination of
economic crisis and drought.
	   Bedu Amang, who heads the government's food distribution
organization, Bulog, said it would also open a tender for the
importation of wheat flour.
	   The price of rice has increased by about 100 percent in the past
year, he said after a meeting with President B.J. Habibie.
	   The prices of other staple foods have also increased as
inflation runs at more than 50 percent overall. The government's
Bureau of Statistics recently predicted that inflation could top 85
percent for 1998.
	   It also warned that poverty levels were skyrocketing.
	   In recent months several donor countries have provided food aid
to Indonesia.
	   Amang said the latest shipment would be provided from Japan.
	   He said that Bulog would also subsidize distribution of
essential commodities, including cooking oil, sugar and soya beans.
	   Long lines of shoppers wanting subsidized food have become a
regular sight in markets across the country.
	   Under a dlrs 43 billion bailout agreement with the International
Monetary Fund, many food subsidies are to be maintained to
alleviate hardship for millions of poor Indonesians.
	   The subsidies are to be phased out later as part of the economic
reforms.
	   In May, big hikes in food and fuel prices helped spark riots,
which resulted in 1,200 deaths and helped forced President Suharto
to resign after 32 years in office.
	   Many fear that violence will return if prices continue to rise
along with growing unemployment.
	   Under Suharto, Indonesia had transformed itself from a rice
importer in the 1960s to self-sufficiency in the 1980s.
	   However, much of that achievement has unraveled as the country
continues to grapple with economic and political uncertainty.

Forest fires in Russian Far East burn
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Forest fires in Russia's Far East have consumed
40,000 hectares (98,000 acres) of land and show no sign of abating,
a news agency reported Tuesday.
	   Regional emergency officials said 74 separate fires had been
identified, with one blaze on the Kamchatka peninsula accounting
for about a fourth of the total damage, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported.
	   Over 700 firefighters, with eight helicopters, are battling the
blazes.
	   The Far East has been ravaged by forest fires this summer
because of an unusually dry winter and spring.

Natural gas field discovered in southwestern China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Prospectors have discovered a large natural gas
field in southwestern China, the official Xinhua News Agency
reported Tuesday.
	   The field, in the Kaijiang region of Sichuan province, contains
an estimated 260 billion cubic meters (338 billion cubic yards) of
natural gas, Xinhua said.
	   It was first explored in the 1980s, and more extensive,
high-technology drilling began after the state gas company and
Sichuan's Petroleum Administration Bureau joined forces on the
project in 1993, Xinhua said.
	   China's 1997 natural gas production was 2.5 billion cubic meters
(3.25 billion cubic yards), a 9.9 percent increase from the
previous year, according to the government's statistics bureau.
	   Years of fast-paced economic growth turned China into a net oil
importer in 1993. It remains bent on increasing domestic supplies
of oil and gas to reduce foreign exchange expenses and protect
supplies from the uncertainties of the international market.

Love of country motivates U-S team
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HANK LOWENKRON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) _ Individual needs are being pushed aside by
the thrill of representing one's country, say members of the U.S.
team that will start competing against Belgium on Friday.
	   ``It's nice to come together as a team and play for your
country,'' said Andre Agassi, who tied the U.S. record of 16
consecutive victories in Davis Cup play earlier this year.
	   Agassi, who like teammate Jim Courier was once ranked No. 1 in
the world, is representing his country in the event for the 19th
time. He's 25-5 after having his record streak snapped by Russia's
Yevgeny Kafelnikov in the first round this year.
	   And at 28, Agassi isn't ready to stop competing for the Davis
Cup.
	   ``The memories that I've had inspire me to continue,'' said
Agassi, who is here instead of taking advantage of a week off to
spend time with his wife, actress Brooke Shields.
	   Courier has a unique streak going as he represents the U.S. for
the 12th time. The Americans have never lost a tie when Courier has
been on the team.
	   It's no big deal, he said Monday as the team made a public
appearance at a Planet Hollywood restaurant.
	   ``Not really,'' he said. ``If my record was perfect, then maybe
I'd be concerned about it. But I've had the good fortune to play on
a lot of good teams. When they've needed me to come up with a good
result, I have. And when I've gone out and lost the fourth match,
Andre or someone else has won the crucial fifth match.''
	   Meanwhile, the man promoting ticket sales for the event said
he's been encouraged by recent interest.
	   ``Sales were a little soft,'' said Russ Cline, who has been
promoting ticket sales for Davis Cup events in the United States
since 1989. ``They were behind any other second-round
(quarterfinal) ties I've done.''
	   Cline said he's hopeful of having between 4,000 to 5,000
spectators at each day of the competition. The 8,461-seat Stadium
Court at the Indianapolis Tennis Center will be set up with about
5,200 seats.
	   Both teams will have two practice sessions at the tennis
facility Tuesday, and the draw for the matches will be held on
Thursday when the captains must announce their line-up.
	   There's no mystery about the American team. Agassi and Courier,
13-8 in Cup play, will compete in singles. Todd Martin and Richey
Reneberg, who only played together in one tournament before they
scored a valuable point as the U-S defeated Russia 3-2 in the
opening round of this year's World Group play, will play doubles.
	   The same four players who represented the United States in that
tie at Stone Mountain, Georgia, are back to wear their national
red-white-and-blue uniform.
	   ``We are a very solid team with Andre and Jim. Todd and I played
well together against the Russians,'' said Reneberg, who at 32 is
the oldest player to represent the country since 33-year-old John
McEnroe last played for the U.S. in 1992. ``We have some continuity
and we all know what to do and what not to do. Belgium has a very
good team and we can't take them lightly.''
	   Belgium captain Koen Gonnissen doesn't plan to announce his
lineup until Thursday.
	   He'll be choosing from among four young players _ Filip Dewulf,
Christophe Van Garsse, Johan Van Herck and 17-year-old Xavier
Malisse, who left Belgium to develop his game at Nick Bollettieri's
tennis academy in Florida.

<TEXT>
	   RAS AL-KHAIMAH, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ A Ukrainian cargo
plane burst into flames shortly after take off and crashed into the
sea, airline officials and witnesses said Tuesday.
	   Scuba divers recovered the bodies of four of the eight crew
members aboard the four-engine Ilyushin-76, a coast guard official
said on condition of anonymity. Divers found the bodies Tuesday
morning. The official said he did not expect to find anyone alive.
	   The plane, flight number TII-2570, belonged to a private
Ukrainian company, A.T.I, and was carrying about 38 tons of cargo,
said an official from Azerbaijani Airlines, who also spoke on
condition of anonymity. He said all crew members were Ukrainian.
	   The plane took off from the airport at the emirate of Ras
al-Khaimah at 11:30 p.m. (1930 GMT) Monday.
	   But it caught fire minutes after take-off and then exploded
right before it crashed into the sea 500 meters (550 yards) from
shore, said Mohammad Hussein, a 46-year-old businessmen who saw the
plane from a hotel terrace near the beach. He said he saw hundreds
of watermelons floating in the sea after the crash.
	   The Azerbaijani Airlines official said the plane was headed for
Ukraine. The Emirates News Agency said it was en route to Russia.
There was no immediate way to reconcile the discrepancy.
	   On Tuesday, helicopters hovered over the wreckage while divers
in yellow and blue suits took shifts searching the sea for bodies.
	   An official at the coast guard of Ras al-Khaimah, an emirate at
the northern tip of the United Arab Emirates, said about 60 people
were involved in the rescue effort.
	   An airport official said diving teams initially had difficulty
getting close to the plane due to the heat of the burning wreckage.
	   ``An area of around 200 meters (220 yards) was in flames at the
time of the crash but was extinguished after 15 minutes,'' the
official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The Ras al-Khaimah airport receives about 40 flights every week
from cities in the former Soviet Union, where air safety has
declined dramatically as many cash-strapped airlines have failed to
provide adequate maintenance of aging aircraft.
	   In December, 85 people were killed when a Tajik airliner crashed
in the emirate of Sharjah.

millions &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Illegal gambling in Singapore on World Cup
soccer matches totaled hundreds of millions of dollars, a newspaper
reported Tuesday.
	   As much as 500 million Singapore dollars (dlrs 290 million)
changed hands during the monthlong competition, various informed
gamblers told The Straits Times.
	   They added that about 10 million Singapore dollars (dlrs 5.8
million) was bet on the finals, and that bookies reaped big profits
on the surprise victory by the French.
	   The paper said Sunday's championship game marked the end of a
gambling spell that gripped the predominantly Chinese island
republic.
	   Individuals from drivers to chief executive officers placed
money on the outcome of various matches, and office pools were
common, the report added.
	   Aside from state-sanctioned horse racing and national lotteries,
gambling is illegal in Singapore, though the authorities often turn
a blind eye to informal betting.
	   Organized gambling is taken more seriously, though. In June,
Singapore authorities broke up two syndicates that were taking bets
on soccer matches, arresting 15 people on the first day of the
World Cup.
	   Illegal gambling on soccer remains a huge business in Asia, with
transactions reaching billions annually and occasional reports of
global match-fixing coordinated from the region.

Holyfield-Akinwande bout could be back on
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ A major hurdle in the rescheduling of Evander
Holyfield's title defense against Henry Akinwande has been cleared,
meaning the fight could be back on after being canceled in June,
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported Tuesday.
	   Akinwande tested positive for the hepatitis B virus on June 5, a
day before the two fighters were to square off for Holyfield's WBA
and IBF championships.
	   But Akinwande's most recent blood test showed the residual
strain of the virus in his system is noninfectious, the newspaper
said.
	   ``We have a situation where it has become more likely than not
that this fight will go forward as soon as it's practicable,'' said
Jim Thomas, Holyfield's attorney.
	   A potential make-up date of Aug. 29 at Madison Square Garden,
the site of the original fight, has been scheduled by fight
promoter Don King and Showtime executive Jay Larkin.
	   But Akinwande can still be denied a license by the New York
State Athletic Commission, since the virus still is detectable in
his blood. A positive test can occur even after a person recovers.
	   Madison Square Garden also has rights of first refusal on any
dates, and managers there are not enthusiastic about a make-up
since the first fight was not financially successful.
	   The paper also reported that an alternative site and date would
be Las Vegas on Sept. 5.
	   Holyfield, who lives in Atlanta, received an offer from HBO
television for dlrs 20 million to fight Lennox Lewis and unify the
heavyweight belts since the Akinwande fight was called off.
	   But Holyfield said he wouldn't commit to that date _ proposed
for December _ until the Akinwande situation was settled.
	   ``I have to listen to my body,'' Holyfield said, adding he would
prefer to fight Lewis in the spring.

Thai telecoms tycoon launches new political party

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A Thai telecommunications tycoon whose
previous foray into national politics led to the destruction of his
party launched a new political party Tuesday to compete in the next
election.
	   Thaksin Shinawatra, the scion of a wealthy merchant family who
amassed a dlrs 2 billion fortune through monopolistic government
concessions on satellites and mobile phones, said his new ``Thais
Love Thais'' party won't be a millionaires' club.
	   ``I'm a self-made man who built himself up from scratch, so I
understand the problems of the poor,'' he said.
	   Thaksin's new party may represent a threat to the Democrat Party
of Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai by siphoning off support in
northern Thailand during the next election. The Democrat-led
coalition government holds a slim majority in parliament.
	   Chuan still has more than three years left in office, but no
elected Thai prime minister has ever completed his term because of
the fractious nature of the country's coalition governments.
	   Thaksin's crafted image as someone who went from rags to riches
is rarely questioned by, and appeals to many Thais.
	   He said his party would only accept ``quality people'' and offer
an alternative to corruption-riddled Thai governments.
	   His party's chief adviser is Narong Wongwan, who has been denied
a visa to the United States on suspicion of involvement in drug
trafficking.
	   Thaksin served as foreign minister for three months in 1994
before he was forced to resign because of conflicts of interest
involving his communications empire.
	   He then joined Palang Dharma (Power of Truth) Party and led it
to a respectable showing in 1995 elections by promising clean
government and to solve Bangkok's notorious traffic problems or
resign in six months.
	   He didn't solve the traffic problem and he didn't resign.
	   When he led Palang Dharma to join a coalition government widely
regarded as corrupt, he alienated the party's supporters. They
accused him of caring more about protecting his business interests
than clean government.
	   Out of more than 20 members of Parliament, only one was
re-elected and the party all but disintegrated. Many members blamed
Thaksin for wrecking the party.
	   Thaksin quit politics but has sporadically talked about making a
comeback.
	   ``I still have a strong passion to change Thai politics for the
better. That's why I have come back with a reform-minded political
party,'' he said.

Hart accuses English of spying on All Blacks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ New Zealand coach John Hart
exonerated Australia of any suggestions that they spied on his All
Blacks before last weekend's rugby union test.
	   But he said Tuesday that he believed England, on admission from
one of their own test players, spied on the All Blacks ahead of the
two-test series last month.
	   After being accused of being out of line by approaching the
referee at halftime in the first test against England at Dunedin,
Hart turned the tables on his accusers.
	   He said Tuesday that an English player had confirmed his
suspicions that the All Blacks' private training session in
Queenstown ahead of the test had been secretly videotaped.
	   ``Clearly some of their defensive ploys were geared against our
moves,'' Hart said. ``My understanding is that the English team, on
the Friday night before the test sat down and went thorough a full
video and planned how to shut down all our moves and calls.
	   ``And that was from a player in their test side to one of my
players that night (Saturday). But before that I had an inkling it
was going on.''
	   Meanwhile, Hart predicted that South Africa will beat Australia
in the second Tri-Nations rugby test in Perth on Saturday because
they are a fresher side.
	   Hart believes the battered Australians, who suffered numerous
injuries in their 24-16 win over the All Blacks, may pay the price
for a tough win last weekend in Melbourne.
	   ``South Africa will be better prepared in the sense that they
are coming off a two-week break and have no injuries that I know
of,'' Hart said. (djp)

	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ Andrew Mehrtens paid the price for
a high error rate in the test against Australia when he was dropped
from the All Blacks rugby union team to play South Africa in
Wellington on July 25.
	   Mehrtens gives way to Auckland's Carlos Spencer in one of three
changes made to the team Tuesday following last Saturday night's
24-16 loss in Melbourne.
	   Other changes will see the return of Mark Mayerhofler for Scott
McLeod at center, following his recovery from a hamstring strain,
while on the wing Jonah Lomu regains his starting position from
Joeli Vidiri.
	   ``Andrew by his own admission will be a little concerned about
his inconsistency in the last two tests and his high error rate,''
said New Zealand coach John Hart.
	   ``And when we look at the analysis we've done, we are getting
ourselves into problems because of the high number of errors and
we've just got to minimize that error rate.''
	   ``We cannot afford those at this level.''
	   The reserves for the team will be named on the weekend.
	   The New Zealand team: Christian Cullen, Jeff Wilson, Mark
Mayerhofler, Jonah Lomu, Walter Little, Carlos Spencer, Justin
Marshall, Taine Randell (captain), Josh Kronfeld, Ian Jones, Robin
Brooke, Michael Jones, Craig Dowd, Anton Oliver, Olo Brown. (djp)

Indian woman battles attitudes, powerful seminary

<TEXT>
	   DEOBAND, India (AP) _ Her office was burned, her election
posters ripped from walls. Crowds stood outside her home shouting
insults.
	   But backed by a law ensuring a woman's right to run for local
office, women's rights activist Zeenat Naaz prevailed. Two years
ago, she became the first woman mayor of Deoband, 190 kilometers
(120 miles) north of New Delhi.
	   Her fight did not end there, however. Earlier this year, less
than halfway through her term, Naaz, a Muslim, was thrown out of
office in a vote of confidence she says was engineered by leaders
of Deoband's powerful Islamic seminary. She is now fighting her
ouster in the courts.
	   The struggle for women's rights in India is not merely a local
one. While a 1995 law set aside certain seats for women on
municipal and village councils, a similar proposal setting aside a
third of the seats in the national parliament for women was
derailed Tuesday.
	   The bill's critics staged rowdy protests Monday at the
parliament building, at one point snatching a copy of the draft
legislation from the hands of the law minister and ripping it to
pieces before it could be introduced for debate. Because of the
opposition, from men who say the law should include special quotas
for Muslim and other minority women, the parliament speaker said
Tuesday that the introduction of the bill would be indefinitely
postponed.
	   In Deoband, the seminary known as Darul Uloom, or Center of
Learning, says voting by unveiled women, let alone their running
for public office, violates Islam. Naaz is one of the few women in
this Muslim-majority town of 100,000 to reject the all-enveloping
veil known as a burqa.
	   The 1,000 students at the 140-year-old Darul Uloom come from all
over the world, studying to head mosques and argue Islamic law. The
opinions of its leaders are sought whenever Islamic law is debated
in South Asia.
	   Their views on the role of women are unambiguous. ``It is
biologically, religiously and prophetically proven that men are
superior to women,'' says Maulana Adil Siddiqui, seminary
spokesman. ``Women can be educated and improved, but not to the
extent of a man.''
	   Afghanistan's Taliban army draws its ideological inspiration
from the Darul Uloom. The Taliban prohibits girls from going beyond
elementary school and bans most women from working in the
two-thirds of the war-torn country it controls.
	   The school enjoys great influence over India's Muslims, who make
up about 12 percent of the population of nearly 1 billion, the
largest minority in this predominately Hindu country.
	   That sway is especially strong in Deoband, where Naaz is
outspoken about the need for India's women to have a greater say in
its democracy.
	   ``Muslim women are downtrodden. ... They are afraid to speak up
and don't have confidence in themselves. I wanted to help them,''
she said.
	   Darul Uloom clerics and students refer to Naaz with disdain, but
deny direct involvement in her ouster.
	   As mayor, Naaz gave destitute women sewing machines so that they
could set up small seamstress businesses and started adult
education classes for them. Roads were repaired, drains cleaned and
four schools for poor children opened, say her supporters, many of
them poor women.
	   Naaz ``stood up for all those who needed her help,'' said
Mustare, a 32-year-old Deoband homemaker who uses one name only.
	   Naaz's husband Mohammad Arshad, a 38-year-old craftsman, said he
is proud of his wife and will continue encouraging her political
career. The couple has two daughters and two sons.
	   Naaz, one of the few women in Deoband educated beyond elementary
school, has run the private Committee for Women's Struggle for the
past 10 years. Committee members often act as women's advocates in
marital disputes.
	   Naaz is fighting a way of life in much of small-town India. In
Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state where Deoband is
located, five other chairwomen have been removed by no-confidence
votes in conservative Hindu, as well as Muslim communities.
	   Soon after her election, Naaz arrived at a Deoband park to kick
off celebrations of a national holiday, only to discover male
politicians had started the ceremony early so that her deputy, a
man, could unfurl the Indian flag.

U.S., Japan business heads press Tokyo to take economic steps
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ U.S. and Japanese industry leaders urged Japan's
government Monday to speed efforts to revive the country's economy
from recession.
	   The call came in a joint statement issued at the close of the
35th annual Japan-U.S. Business Conference, a two-day gathering of
business leaders from the world's two largest economies.
	   Unlike previous meetings where bitter bilateral trade disputes
dominated the proceedings, this year's discussions focused on the
woes of the shrinking Japanese economy.
	   ``There were many areas we could agree to, perhaps more so than
in the past,'' said Minoru Makihara, conference co-chair and
chairman of Japanese trading house Mitsubishi Corp.
	   Representatives of the two nation's business communities
recommended that Japan act quickly to clean up bad loans burdening
its banks, adopt permanent corporate and income tax cuts,
deregulate its markets and improve the Japanese social safety net.
	   Conference co-chair Michael Jordan, chairman and chief executive
officer of CBS Corp., said it was important for Japan to implement
these measures to head off criticism about Japan's surplus in trade
with the United States.
	   ``This is a matter, obviously, of some concern,'' he said of
Japan's burgeoning surplus.
	   The joint statement also called on both the United States and
Japan to aid nations hurt by the Asian economic crisis and work for
stronger pollution control commitments from developing countries.
	   The 36th Japan-U.S. Business Conference is to be held next year
in San Francisco.

<TEXT>
	   RAS AL-KHAIMAH, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ A Ukrainian cargo
plane with eight crew members on board burst into flames shortly
after take off and crashed into the sea, airline officials and
witnesses said Tuesday. Rescue workers recovered the bodies of four
of the crew members, a coast guard offical said on condition of
anonymity.
	   The four-engine Ilyushin-76 caught fire and exploded minutes
after taking off from the airport at the emirate of Ras al-Khaimah
at 11:30 p.m. (1930 GMT) Monday. It crashed into the sea 500 meters
(550 yards) from shore, said Mohammad Hussein, a 46-year-old
businessman who saw the aircraft from a hotel terrace near the
beach.
	   The plane, flight number TII-2570, belonged to a private
Ukrainian company, A.T.I., and was carrying about 38 tons of cargo,
said an official from Azerbaijani Airlines, who spoke on condition
of anonymity. He said all its crew members were Ukrainian.
	   Divers found four bodies Tuesday morning. The coast guard
official said he did not expect to find anyone alive.
	   The Azerbaijani Airlines official said the plane was headed for
Ukraine. The Emirates News Agency said it was en route to Russia.
There was no immediate way to reconcile the discrepancy.
	   On Tuesday, helicopters hovered over the wreckage while divers
working in shifts searched the sea for bodies. Hussein, the
businessman, said he saw hundreds of watermelons floating in the
sea after the crash.
	   An official at the coast guard of Ras al-Khaimah, an emirate at
the northern tip of the United Arab Emirates, said about 60 people
were involved in the rescue effort.
	   An airport official said diving teams initially had difficulty
getting close to the plane due to the heat of the burning wreckage.
	   ``An area of around 200 meters (220 yards) was in flames at the
time of the crash but was extinguished after 15 minutes,'' the
official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The Ras al-Khaimah airport receives about 40 flights every week
from cities in the former Soviet Union, where air safety has
declined dramatically as many cash-strapped airlines have failed to
provide adequate maintenance of aging aircraft.
	   In December, 85 people were killed when a Tajik airliner crashed
in the emirate of Sharjah.

Deposed Cambodian co-premier hopes France's win is an omen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHUM PONGROR, Cambodia (AP) _ Prince Norodom Ranariddh said
Monday he sees France's World Cup soccer victory as a sign that he
will defeat his archrival, Cambodian leader Hun Sen, in the July 26
elections.
	   Ranariddh, who was ousted by Hun Sen in a bloody coup one year
ago, picked France as his favorite to win the World Cup. Hun Sen
picked Brazil.
	   ``Hun Sen said he bet on Brazil ... but now Brazil lost to
France in a shameful defeat, 3-0,'' Ranariddh told reporters while
on the campaign trail at a pagoda in the central province of
Kompong Chhnang.
	   ``Since Brazil was defeated, he also may lose in the election.
He may go the direction of Brazil,'' the prince said playfully,
turning to the crowd of about 800 supporters, who burst into
applause.
	   Unlike Ranariddh, who has crisscrossed Cambodia during the
one-month election campaign, Hun Sen has preferred to stay on the
sidelines.
	   Opponents accuse him of stacking the electoral mechanisms in his
favor and using violence and intimidation to ensure he wins.
	   Hun Sen hopes the election will restore international legitimacy
and aid lost following his violent takeover last year.

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Angry protests in India's federal
legislature succeeded Tuesday in derailing an effort to set aside a
third of the parliament's seats for women.
	   Speaker G.M.C. Balayogi told parliament the bill would not be
introduced ``for the time being.
	   ``Consensus has so far not been possible,'' Balayogi said. He
had met earlier in the day with leaders of political parties to try
to find a way to push the bill forward.
	   Monday, the bill's critics staged rowdy protests in parliament,
at one point snatching a copy of the draft legislation from the
hands of the law minister and ripping it to pieces.
	   The bill, meant to increase women's participation in India's
democracy, was first introduced in 1996 by a previous government
but met with similar opposition then and never came to a vote.
Women accused men in parliament of refusing to surrender any power
in a country where religious practice and tradition often keep
women in the shadows.
	   Members of parties who rely on the votes of Muslims and lower
class Hindus say they won't let the bill be considered unless it
includes quotas within the quota for the groups they represent.
Women's groups say the quota-within-a-quota demand may be a tactic
to stall the bill, rather than a legitimate attempt to help
minorities.
	   A similar measure was passed in 1995 for municipal and village
councils. Results have been mixed at the local level. Some women
politicians are merely fronts for husbands or fathers, or have been
ousted in no-confidence votes.

Ionian Bank, the country's fourth largest.
	   Potential buyers have until Aug. 24 to submit bids.
	   The government's plans to privatize Ionian prompted violent
reactions from the bank's staff in May, leading to a six-week
strike by employees seeking to maintain benefits and the guarantee
of a job until the retirement age of 62.
	   Ionian is the largest bank to be privatized and a key element in
the government's effort to meet targets for participation in the
European Union's single currency by 2001.
	   The tender includes an obligation to maintain the current labor
relations framework for the staff's social security arrangements
and other benefits.
	   But it does not explicitly require the buyer to maintain the
bank's staff for a certain period, as the employees' unionists had
demanded.
	   The buyer will have to pay the purchase price in cash upon
transfer of the stake, which will take place through the Athens
Stock Exchange.
	   At least two major Greek banks are expected to emerge as
potential buyers. Alpha Credit Bank, the largest private lender,
has expressed an interest. Market analysts have said Alpha Credit
could team up with a foreign bank in order to make a joint bid.
	   But Ionian's price has been running high since Eurobank, a
member of the Latsis shipping group, began aggressive expansion in
the Greek market.
	   Last Thursday, Eurobank bought a 12 percent stake in Ergobank,
Greece's fifth-largest bank and second-largest private sector bank,
for 101 billion drachmas (about dlrs 331 million) in what could be
an attempt to put together a joint bid with Ergobank for the Ionian
stake.
	   With an estimated stock market value of around 400 billion
drachmas (dlrs 1.3 billion), Ionian's 51 percent stake could reach
a price of about 200 billion drachmas (dlrs 655 million).

Outgoing Chechen premier calls for cutting all ties with Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Chechnya's outgoing prime minister said ongoing
negotiations with Russia have produced no results and the rebel
republic should cut all relations with the Kremlin, a news report
said Tuesday.
	   ``Russia cannot be trusted because it has never deemed it
necessary to fulfill its commitments,'' Shamil Basayev, who stepped
down July 3, told the Interfax news agency.
	   Basayev was a prominent guerrilla leader during the 1994-96 war
with Russia, and agreed to serve as Chechnya's prime minister on an
interim basis for the first half of this year.
	   He pledged to rein in rampant crime and improve the moribund
economy shattered by the war, but failed to make any significant
progress during his six months in office.
	   As prime minister, Basayev said he ``constantly felt open and
covert resistance from the Russian government.''
	   ``The endless visits of Russian ministers to Chechnya produced
absolutely no results indicating Russia's willingness to build
civilized relations with Chechnya,'' he said.
	   Russia and Chechnya signed a peace deal last year, but the
agreement did not address Chechnya's political status. Chechnya
considers itself fully independent, but no other country recognizes
the claim and the Kremlin insists Chechnya remains part of Russia.

Russian prime minister makes debut visit to Beijing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Russian Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko planned
to discuss boosting sagging trade and investing in China's energy
sector during a brief visit to Beijing Tuesday.
	   The five-hour stopover on his way home from Japan marks
Kiriyenko's first trip to Russia's powerful neighbor and former
socialist adversary since he took over as prime minister in April.
	   He will meet with Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Premier Zhu
Rongji, in part to prepare for Jiang's visit to Russia in early
September, said Evgueni Verlin, a Russian Embassy spokesman.
	   Kiriyenko is on ``a working visit to discuss problems with trade
and to search for breakthroughs, especially in the field of
energy,'' said Verlin.
	   The Russian prime minister and Zhu will discuss projects to pipe
gas from eastern Siberia and build a nuclear power plant in eastern
China's Lianyungang, Verlin said.
	   Financing is believed to have been a problem for the projects.
Verlin noted that Kiriyenko is accompanied by Russia's ministers
for finance and atomic energy.
	   Scientific cooperation and measures to boost slackening trade _
by opening Chinese department stores in Moscow and other Russian
cities, for example _ will also be discussed, Verlin said.
	   Russia and China have set a U.S. dlrs 20 billion target for
two-way trade by 2000. But commerce between them amounted to just
U.S. dlrs 6.12 billion in 1997, down 10 percent from the previous
year.
	   Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov will follow up with
further talks on a visit to China July 22-26, said Chinese Foreign
Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang.

Opposition claims to have stopped Taliban advance
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ZAHEERUDDIN ABDULLAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Opposition soldiers ambushed Taliban
troops, cut their supply lines and stopped their advance toward the
headquarters of a key enemy commander in northwestern Afghanistan,
opposition officials said Tuesday.
	   The anti-Taliban alliance launched its counter-offensive
following a weekend of heavy fighting in which the Taliban took
control of the key northern province of Faryab.
	   The Taliban militia, which rules about 85 per cent of the
country, said its soldiers were marching toward neighboring Jozjan
province and the headquarters of opposition leader Rashid Dostum.
	   ``We've stopped them, and we have cut the roads from Maimana to
Jozjan,'' said an opposition spokesman who identified himself only
as Abdullah.
	   There was no immediate comment from Taliban officials in the
capital, Kabul.
	   Reached by satellite telephone, Abdullah accused the government
of neighboring Pakistan of encouraging the Taliban to press ahead
with a military solution rather than negotiate an end to the
conflict.
	   Pakistan was the first country officially to recognize the
Taliban army but it routinely denies supporting the force. Saudi
Arabia and United Arab Emirates have also recognized the Taliban.
	   The United Nations has accused Afghanistan's neighbors of
helping both sides in the conflict.
	   Since taking control of Kabul in September 1996, the Taliban has
been seeking official recognition from the United Nations, which
has repeatedly condemned the religious militia's human rights
record, particularly its treatment of women.
	   In areas under its control, the Taliban has imposed a harsh form
of Islamic law that denies women the right to work and go to
school. It also forces them to wear an all-enveloping robe called a
burqua and publicly punishes them for traveling outside their home
unaccompanied by a close male relative.
	   The opposition alliance, made up mostly of the country's
minority ethnic groups, is trying to stop the Taliban from
consolidating its hold over the entire country.
	   However, last weekend's capture of northwestern Faryab province
was a significant gain for Taliban troops, who had been routed out
of key provinces in northern Afghanistan in May 1997.

Saudis release eight Filipinos and Dutchman held for evangelizing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Saudi Arabia has freed eight
Filipinos and a Dutch national who were jailed for distributing
Christian pamphlets in the kingdom, diplomats said Tuesday.
	   Four Filipinos were sent home Monday and another four are
awaiting deportation, probably before Wednesday, a Filipino
diplomat said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Wim Den Hartog was deported to the Netherlands on Monday, said a
Dutch diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Preaching Christianity in Saudi Arabia, a conservative Muslim
nation, is punishable by up to a year in prison and deportation.
	   The Filipinos and Dutchman belonged to a Bible-study group in
the Saudi capital, Riyadh, where they were accused of evangelizing.
	   Saudi officials would not comment on the case.
	   The group was arrested in early June. Two Filipinos arrested
along with the group were later released.
	   The Dutch and Filipino embassies said Saudi authorities had
refused to allow their officials to visit their citizens in jail.

Hopes high for change as Japan's leaders jockey for power
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS 3rd graf to RAISE that Hashimoto will serve until
successor found; ADDS in 9th graf that Parliament expects to vote
by July 30; UPDATES market figures in 6th graf &QL; 
 &UR; By TODD ZAUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Hopes were high Tuesday that a new leadership would
move quickly to put Japan's ailing economy back on track after the
ruling party suffered defeat in elections seen as a rejection of
its policies.
	   Japanese media said the balloting for Parliament's upper house
that stripped the ruling Liberal Democrats of 17 seats showed
people wanted action to pull the nation out of its worst recession
in decades.
	   Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto resigned Monday to take
responsibility for the electoral humiliation, though he will serve
until a successor is chosen by Parliament.
	   Tokyo financial markets reflected the optimism for change.
	   After plunging on worries about political instability following
the election, the Japanese yen recovered Tuesday on hopes that
Tokyo had finally been shaken into a realization that tax cuts and
other concrete steps were needed for an economic turnaround.
	   The dollar was trading at 141.36 yen late Tuesday, down 1.06 yen
from late Monday. The Tokyo Stock Exchange's main index closed 0.79
percent higher.
	   ``The kind of prime minister we need is someone who has
commitment and ability to face Japan's economic problems and tackle
reforms from a deep and broad viewpoint,'' the newspaper Asahi said
in an editorial Tuesday.
	   It was unclear, however, whether the Liberal Democrats were
ready for that challenge _ the party appeared more intent on its
usual infighting to get a lead in the race to replace Hashimoto.
	   Because the Liberal Democrats hold the majority in the more
powerful lower house, which chooses the prime minister, the party
president, expected to be chosen next Tuesday, becomes prime
minister. The Parliament was expected to meet to vote on the
nominee before July 30.
	   The leading possible successors jockeying for power are Foreign
Minister Keizo Obuchi, 61, and former Chief Cabinet Secretary
Seiroku Kajiyama. Both are old-style politicians in the party, and
not economic experts, although in recent months Kajiyama has pushed
more aggressively for economic reforms.
	   Kajiyama, 72, has a serious international image problem, having
made remarks that offended both the United States and Japan's Asian
neighbors.
	   In 1990, Kajiyama said prostitutes in Japan and blacks in the
United States ``ruin the atmosphere of the neighborhoods they move
into.'' He retracted the remark but later stirred up another
controversy by suggesting that women who served as sex slaves for
Japanese troops during World War II did it for the money.
	   Japanese media reported that some of the younger Liberal
Democratic lawmakers were backing outspoken 56-year-old Health
Minister Junichiro Koizumi, but he is unlikely to get enough
support from the party elders, crucial for the party presidency.
	   Koizumi said the new leader should reflect the voters' message
of anger at the party's failures.
	   ``It's no good just to change faces,'' he said.
	   Former Health Minister Naoto Kan, who leads the new Democratic
Party, is now Japan's most popular politician.
	   Kan's party, which pushed for tax cuts to stimulate the economy,
was also the biggest gainer in the weekend elections. But Kan, 51,
stands no chance of becoming prime minister, even if his party
manages to fight the odds and unite a fragmented opposition.
	   In a survey of 55 top corporate executives published Tuesday by
the newspaper Nihon Keizai, only 16 said they backed any politician
as a replacement for Hashimoto.
	   Of those, 13 tapped Kajiyama.
	   Another factor that might dampen the possibility of major
reforms is that politicians for decades have left much of the
decision-making to the powerful bureaucrats.
	   Many Japanese believe the bureaucrats stand in the way of what
is needed for a better economy, including loosening business
regulations as well as belt-tightening for smaller government.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Five firefighters were killed after they were
encircled by windswept flames while battling a forest fire in
southern Russia, a news report said Tuesday.
	   The firemen were trapped and burned to death in a massive pine
forest blaze in the Volgograd region, 900 kilometers (560 miles)
south of Moscow, the Interfax news agency said.
	   Gusts of wind caused the fire to leap from treetop-to-treetop,
and the firefighters suddenly found themselves surrounded and
unable to escape, the report said.
	   A sixth fireman suffered serious burns and was hospitalized.
	   Meanwhile, forest fires in Russia's Far East have consumed
40,000 hectares (98,000 acres) of land and show no sign of abating,
the ITAR-Tass news agency reported Tuesday.
	   Officials said 74 separate fires had been identified, with one
blaze on the Kamchatka peninsula accounting for about a fourth of
the total damage, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   Over 700 firefighters, with eight helicopters, were battling the
blazes.
	   The Far East has been ravaged by forest fires this summer
because of an unusually dry winter and spring.

Trade group, markets react cautiously to news on sanctions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Business leaders and the stock market
reacted cautiously Tuesday to news that the U.S. president wants
flexibility to lift economic sanctions against India and Pakistan.
	   Officials at the Confederation of Indian Industry, an
influential business group, said it would be premature to comment
until legislation was actually passed for modifying the sanctions
imposed to punish India and Pakistan for their nuclear tests in
May.
	   The news had barely filtered in when the Indian markets opened
Tuesday.
	   ``This would be extremely positive. It is exactly what the
financial markets are looking for,'' said Gul Tekchandani, chief
investment officer of the Sun, a mutual funds agency in the Indian
business hub of Bombay.
	   On Monday, the Clinton administration asked the U.S. Congress
for authority to waive economic sanctions on India and Pakistan,
saying it would do so only if India and Pakistan made ``substantial
progress'' toward easing international concerns about nuclear
weapons proliferation in South Asia.
	   The U.S. sanctions were automatic, and under current law only
Congress can lift them. The U.S. Senate is expected to take up
legislation soon that would waive the current sanctions for nine
months and then allow the president to waive them further after
assessing the nuclear policies of India and Pakistan.
	   Last week, the Senate voted 98-0 to exempt wheat and other
American agricultural exports from the sanctions, thereby
re-opening an important market for U.S. farmers.

Tokyo stocks rise on continued hopes for tax cuts, dollar down

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stock prices rose moderately Tuesday on
continued hopes that the government might implement a
larger-than-expected tax cut to stimulate the sagging economy. The
U.S. dollar slipped against the yen.
	   The 225-issue benchmark Nikkei Stock Average gained 128.52
points, or 0.79 percent, closing at 16,488.91. On Monday, the index
had climbed 270.33 points, or 1.68 percent.
	   Traders said the Nikkei index headed into positive territory in
the afternoon following a Japanese news report that the
government's tax panel chief would propose 6 trillion yen (dlrs
42.5 billion) in permanent tax cuts.
	   Japan's major opposition political parties had urged such
large-scale tax cuts in the campaign for Sunday's election for half
the seats in Parliament's upper house. Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto's governing party suffered a humiliating defeat in the
voting.
	   The Liberal Democratic Party's defeat was viewed as a vote of
no-confidence in its efforts so far to revive Japan's economy,
which has entered its worst recession since World War II.
	   Trading was moderate, with an estimated 402 million shares
changing hands on the first section, compared with Monday's 389
million. Advances outnumbered retreats 747 to 378, with 146 issues
unchanged.
	   Many foreign investors held back to await indications on who
will succeed Hashimoto, traders said.
	   The Liberal Democrats were expected to name a new leader on July
21.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 10.21 points, or 0.81 percent, to 1,266.65. It
had climbed 14.94 points, or 1.20 percent, the previous day.
	   In late afternoon, the dollar bought 141.36 yen, down 1.06 yen
from late Monday in Tokyo and also below its late New York rate of
141.42 overnight. It ranged between 140.65 yen and 141.65 yen in
Tuesday's trading.
	   As one reason for the dollar's decline, traders cited
unconfirmed talk in the currency market that several unidentified
Asian central banks had sold U.S. Treasuries overnight.
	   This would hurt the dollar because it can decrease demand for
the U.S. currency.
	   Also supporting the yen were expectations that the governing
party's election loss could prompt the government to take more
drastic economic stimulus measures, traders said.
	   Despite the defeat in the upper house polls, the party remains
firmly in control of the government because it has a majority in
Parliament's more powerful lower house.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 1.445 percent from Monday's finish of 1.415
percent, driving its price down to 110.11 yen from 110.33 yen.

	   Ranariddh, who was ousted by Hun Sen in a bloody coup one year
ago, picked France as his favorite to win the World Cup. Hun Sen
picked Brazil.
	   ``Hun Sen said he bet on Brazil ... but now Brazil lost to
France in a shameful defeat, 3-0,'' Ranariddh told reporters while
on the campaign trail at a pagoda in the central province of
Kompong Chhnang.
	   ``Since Brazil was defeated, he also may lose in the election.
He may go the direction of Brazil,'' the prince said playfully,
turning to the crowd of about 800 supporters, who burst into
applause.
	   Unlike Ranariddh, who has crisscrossed Cambodia during the
one-month election campaign, Hun Sen has preferred to stay on the
sidelines.
	   Opponents accuse him of stacking the electoral mechanisms in his
favor and using violence and intimidation to ensure he wins.
	   Hun Sen hopes the election will restore international legitimacy
and aid lost following his violent takeover last year.

Human rights group say 20 rape victims died in Indonesia

 &UR; Eds: ADDS comment from China, graf 2, final grafs &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ An Indonesian human rights group has
alleged that 20 women died after they were raped along with more
than 100 others during recent riots, a news report said Tuesday.
	   Meanwhile in Beijing, China's Foreign Ministry expressed its
``concern and sympathy'' for ethnic Chinese attacked during the
disturbances and called on the Indonesian government to prevent
further violence.
	   The newspaper Jakarta Post quoted activists from the Volunteers
for Humanity group as saying they had documented evidence that 168
girls and women were raped when rioting broke out in mid-May and as
sporadic unrest continued through to July 3 in Jakarta and four
other cities.
	   Details of the attacks were presented to Indonesia's National
Rights Commission.
	   In a report, the group alleged that 20 rape victims were
murdered by their assailants, left to die in burning buildings or
later died of wounds inflicted when they were attacked.
	   It cited the case of a 9-year-old girl who was raped by a gang
that mutilated her genitals. She died several days later in a
Singapore hospital.
	   The report backed claims by other human rights groups that many
of those attacked were members of Indonesia's ethnic Chinese
minority.
	   Chinese make up a small fraction of Indonesia's 202 million
population. But they dominate industry and commerce and have become
the scapegoats for the worst economic crisis in 30 years.
	   Many are Christians and Buddhists, while most other Indonesians
are Muslims.
	   Women's activists say rape was used as a way to terrorize the
Chinese community.
	   The riots in May led to the resignation of President Suharto
after 32 years in power.
	   Since then, his successor President B.J. Habibie has set up an
anti-rape task force.
	   Last week, the National Human Rights Commission accused
Suharto's government and the military of not doing enough to
protect women during the outbreak of violence.
	   In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang
said Tuesday, ``The Chinese side expresses its concern and sympathy
toward the Indonesian Chinese who suffered during the riots.
	   ``As a friendly neighbor of Indonesia, the Chinese government
hopes that the Indonesian government will adopt effective measures
so that Indonesian people of all ethnic groups, including Chinese,
will live and work in contentment,'' he told reporters.
	   Previously, China has said problems in Indonesia are an internal
affair.

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Angry protests in India's federal
legislature succeeded Tuesday in derailing an effort to set aside a
third of the parliament's seats for women.
	   Speaker G.M.C. Balayogi told parliament the bill would not be
introduced ``for the time being.
	   ``Consensus has so far not been possible,'' Balayogi said. He
had met earlier in the day with leaders of political parties to try
to find a way to push the bill forward.
	   Monday, the bill's critics staged rowdy protests in parliament,
at one point snatching a copy of the draft legislation from the
hands of the law minister and ripping it to pieces.
	   The bill, meant to increase women's participation in India's
democracy, was first introduced in 1996 by a previous government
but met with similar opposition then and never came to a vote.
	   Veena Nayyar, president of the independent Women's Political
Watch, said a minority of men were afraid of losing their
parliamentary seats to women.
	   ``They want to just stay glued to their chairs,'' she said.
``They just don't want to share decision-making power with women.''
	   Religious practice and tradition often keep women in the shadows
in India.
	   Members of parties who rely on the votes of Muslims and lower
class Hindus say they won't let the bill be considered unless it
includes quotas within the quota for the groups they represent.
Women's groups say the quota-within-a-quota demand may be a tactic
to stall the bill, rather than a legitimate attempt to help
minorities.
	   Nasreen Faiyaz, coordinator of the National Alliance of Women,
said opposition from members of parties that officially support the
bill had doomed it.
	   ``I don't think it's going to passed,'' lamented Faiyaz. Her
alliance, which has strongly supported the bill, led a group of
women demonstrators to parliament Tuesday. They were not allowed
inside.
	   A similar measure was passed in 1995 for municipal and village
councils. Results have been mixed at the local level. Some women
politicians are merely fronts for husbands or fathers, or have been
ousted in no-confidence votes.

Chinese dissident freed, appeals for release of colleagues

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS throughout to UPDATE with Clinton, Chinese reactions,
comments on party registration; no pickup &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A Chinese democracy campaigner detained with
eight others for setting up a political party has called for the
release of his fellow organizers, a human rights group said
Tuesday.
	   Police escorted activist Cheng Fan from eastern Hangzhou city to
his home in Wenzhou, 250 kilometers (150 miles) to the south, and
then released him Monday night, the Hong Kong-based Information
Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement reported.
	   With Cheng's release, four of the nine organizers of the China
Democracy Party rounded up Friday remain in custody. Three of them
have been formally arrested.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton, through his spokesman, expressed
disappointment Monday with the latest tightening of controls on
dissidents but said he still believes China will gradually open up.
	   Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang defended the
detentions, saying Tuesday that most dissidents ``are criminals''
and that their cases are always handled according to law.
	   ``Nobody is entitled to interfere,'' he told reporters. ``China
is opposed to any acts aiming at interfering in China's internal
affairs by using human rights.''
	   The families of two of these dissidents, Wang Youcai and Zhu
Yufu, have sent clothes to the detention center in Hangzhou, as per
instructions from police _ a sign they could be held in custody for
a long time, the Information Center said.
	   The day President Clinton arrived in China last month, Wang and
others announced that they were setting up the China Democracy
Party to oppose the ruling Communist Party's political monopoly.
	   Authorities immediately began detaining the organizers for brief
periods and refused to allow them to register the group, as
required by law. Friday's roundup came a week after Clinton ended
his China visit.
	   Upon his release Monday night, Cheng Fan and fellow democracy
campaigner Zhai Weimin sent a petition to President Jiang Zemin
calling for the release of those still in custody, the Information
Center said.
	   Their attempts to register the China Democracy Party ``did not
violate any law,'' the Information Center quoted the letter as
saying.
	   But Tang, the Chinese spokesman, pointing to laws on registering
new social groups, suggested that officials regarded the China
Democracy Party as illegal.
	   ``As to those social organizations which undermine China's
security, it is illegal,'' he said.

Hong Kong share prices rebound
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Share prices in Hong Kong rebounded Tuesday
after three straight sessions of declines.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue chips,
rose 79.73 points, or 1.0 percent, closing at 8,178.93. On Monday,
the index had lost 106.57 points.
	   Turnover fell to 2.70 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 346
million) from Monday's 4.05 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
519 million).
	   Brokers said there was selective bargain-hunting following
Monday's sharp falls, caused by the defeat of Japan's ruling party
in parliamentary elections.
	   They said trading was extremely thin because many investors were
holding back to see who will succeed Japanese Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto, who announced his resignation Monday.
	   Among gainers, HSBC Holdings rose 3.50 Hong Kong dollars to
184.00, Swire Pacific ``A'' rose 95 cents to 28.25, Hang Seng Bank
rose 60 cents to 41.20, and Hutchison Whampoa rose 20 cents to
37.90.

Russia's reserves fall to dlrs 13.5
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's Central Bank said its hard-currency
reserves had fallen to dlrs 13.5 billion Tuesday, from 15.1 billion
earlier this month, but an international bailout should bolster
reserves soon.
	   Central Bank chairman Sergei Dubinin said he expects reserves to
rise by at least dlrs 5 billion as money begins to arrive from a
loan package announced by the International Monetary Fund and other
lenders Monday.
	   The bank has been spending U.S. dollars to support the Russian
ruble and prevent a possible devaluation. The loan package is
expected to take pressure off the ruble, which has been trading at
about 6.2 to the dollar.

Voters get say on Panama's next president a year before election
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NIKO PRICE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) _ Panama's presidential election is
nearly a year away, but the deciding votes will probably be cast
next month.
	   In a nationwide referendum, voters on Aug. 30 will decide
whether to amend the constitution and let President Ernesto Perez
Balladares run for a second term.
	   The stakes are high. If voters say yes, Perez Balladares is
probably unbeatable in 1999, opposition leaders admit. If voters
say no, the ruling party doesn't have anyone groomed to succeed
him.
	   And the political payoff is big: the next president will oversee
the U.S. handover of the Panama Canal, along with some of the
country's most valuable land.
	   The process of revising constitutions to extend terms in office
is being repeated throughout Latin America as countries that have
recently shed dictatorships move toward new, democratically elected
strongmen.
	   In 1993, Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori had congress
rewrite the constitution to allow his re-election; he was voted in
again two years later. In 1994, Argentines changed the constitution
to let President Carlos Menem run again; he won with 50 percent of
the vote, and is now trying to bypass the law to run for a third
term.
	   Brazil's congress last year passed a constitutional amendment to
allow the re-election of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso;
elections are set for October. And in the Dominican Republic,
President Leonel Fernandez also is trying to change the
constitution to allow his re-election _ only four years after it
was banned.
	   Many democracy groups worry that as these new democratically
elected dynasties emerge, there will be few checks on the popular
but often authoritarian leaders. The politicians say they are
letting democracy bloom by giving voters more power.
	   But in Panama, despite Perez Balladares' overwhelming
popularity, polls show most people don't want to let him run again.
	   According to the latest poll, published June 22 by the newspaper
La Prensa, 48 percent of respondents planned to vote ``no'' and 33
percent ``yes.'' The poll surveyed 1,224 people from June 13-14 and
had a margin of error of 3 percentage points.
	   But the ruling party is determined to win. It reportedly has
collected dlrs 5 million for the campaign _ a considerable sum in a
poor country of 2.6 million people _ and opposition leaders expect
the ruling party to double or triple their war chest by the
referendum date.
	   Ruling-party officials don't deny that possibility. ``We are
prepared to spend whatever it takes,'' said Presidency Minister
Olmedo Miranda, one of four ministers on leave to help run the
campaign.
	   He said the president needs another term to finish the
transition to a free-market economy, with privatizations, lower
import duties and foreign investment incentives.
	   Miranda also presented the re-election option as a matter of
expanding voter freedom, and said the principle is more important
than the specific re-election of Perez Balladares.
	   Opposition leaders call that ridiculous. They say the president
is desperate for another term, both because he wants to be in
office to receive the Panama Canal next year, and because they say
he has financial interests at stake.
	   And the opposition's main message, repeated in news media and
posters across the city, is that Perez Balladares wants to be a
dictator like those Panama fought to rid itself of.
	   ``He is carrying out a coup d'etat, disguised as a democratic
necessity,'' said Ramon Morales, an opposition leader and executive
vice-president of Panama's biggest insurance company. ``For
Panamanians, re-election is synonymous with dictatorship.''
	   He noted that Perez Balladares belongs to the same party as
former military dictator Gen. Manuel Noriega.
	   ``It's a party organized exclusively for abuse of power, for
corruption,'' he said.
	   Mireya Moscoso, president of Panama's largest opposition party
and a declared candidate for next year's election, accused ruling
party members of corruption, and said they want another term
because it's profitable.
	   ``There will be land handed back (to Panama) and thousands and
thousands of dollars in investment. There are strong economic
influences,'' she said.

Association says pay dispute not settled
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ An Australian pay dispute which
threatened to disrupt last season's international cricket calendar
was set to erupt again, Australian Cricketers' Association (ACA)
president Tim May said Tuesday.
	   May said negotiations with the Australian Cricket Board (ACB)
over pay and conditions for the country's first-class cricketers
had again broken down.
	   Asked how negotiations with the board were progressing, May
said: ``They are not going anywhere.''
	   ``It's a stalemate and could be described as a lull before the
storm.''
	   The dispute flared last October and culminated in threats of
player strikes last season.
	   May said the ACA maintained its position that a proportion of
total cricket revenue be paid directly to the players' association.
	   The board has resisted direct payments to the ACA, fearing it
would diminish monies available to players, but has agreed to set
aside a proportion of total cricket revenue for player remuneration
and welfare.
	   An ACB spokesman would not comment on May's remarks. (djp)

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Industry leaders from the United States and Japan
urged the Japanese government on Monday to speed efforts designed
to revive the country's moribund economy.
	   The call came in joint statement issued issued at the close of
the 35th annual Japan-U.S. Business Conference, a two-day gathering
of business leaders from the world's two largest economies.
	   Unlike previous meetings where bitter bilateral trade disputes
dominated the proceedings, this year's discussions focused on the
woes of the shrinking Japanese economy.
	   ``There were many areas we could agree to, perhaps more so than
in the past,'' said Minoru Makihara, conference co-chair and
chairman of Japanese trading house Mitsubishi Corp.
	   Representatives of the two nation's business communities
recommended that Japan act quickly to clean up bad loans burdening
its banks, enact ``permanent'' corporate and income tax cuts,
deregulate its markets and improve the Japanese social safety net.
	   Conference co-chair Michael Jordan, chairman and chief executive
officer of CBS Corp., said it was important for Japan to implement
these measures to head off criticism about the Japanese trade
surplus with the United States.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The Thai subsidiary of Harrods Energy
of Britain signed an agreement Tuesday to buy a 50 percent stake in
an offshore petroleum block from the Petroleum Authority of
Thailand.
	   Harrods, owned by Egyptian magnate Mohamed Al Fayed, will take
over exploration activities, including a seismic study of the block
and drilling an exploratory well.
	   The block, labeled B5/27, is off the coast of Prachuab Khiri
Khan, 230 kilometers (143 miles) southwest of Bangkok.
	   Thailand's coastal waters are rich in deposits of natural gas
and oil, although the country's energy needs outstrip its supply,
thus making it dependent on oil from the Middle East.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Prospectors have discovered a large natural gas
field in southwestern China, the official Xinhua news agency
reported Tuesday.
	   The field, located in the Kaijiang region of Sichuan province,
contains an estimated 260 billion cubic meters (338 billion cubic
yards) of natural gas, Xinhua said.
	   Although first explored in the 1980s, more extensive,
high-technology drilling began after the state gas company and
Sichuan's Petroleum Administration Bureau joined forces on the
project in 1993, Xinhua said.
	   China's 1997 natural gas production was 2.5 billion cubic meters
(3.25 billion cubic yards), a 9.9 percent increase on the year,
according to the government's statistics bureau.
	   Years of fast-paced economic growth turned China into a net oil
importer in 1993. It remains bent on increasing domestic supplies
of oil and gas to reduce foreign exchange expenses and protect
supplies from the uncertainties of the international market.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Faced with rising unemployment and scarce new
jobs, China is offering tax breaks for laid-off workers who start
their own businesses, the official Xinhua News Agency reported
Tuesday.
	   The National Industrial and Commercial Bureau is waiving taxes
and fees for the first year for businesses started by the laid-off,
Xinhua said. Those in the service trade will have the charges
waived or reduced for three years.
	   In a nationwide circular on the tax breaks, the bureau urged its
regulators nationwide to help the unemployed find jobs, Xinhua
said.
	   Chinese leaders are worried about unrest as once protected state
industries lay off millions of workers to cope with market reforms.
	   To prevent strife, Chinese leaders have urged local governments
to make sure the laid-off are given either new jobs or social
welfare.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Fueled by a recession and shrinking access to
credit, Japanese corporate bankruptcies are rising at their fastest
pace since the end of World War II, a private credit research
agency said Tuesday.
	   The number of companies that failed in June rose 29.1 percent
from a year earlier to 1,741, the most ever recorded for the month,
Teikoku Databank Ltd. announced.
	   ``The economy has entered a vicious spiral of recession,'' the
agency said in a report.
	   Government measures to revive the economy have come too late,
creating a sense of disappointment in financial markets that has
prompted banks to curtail lending, it said.
	   Debt left behind by bankrupt companies in June soared 237.5
percent to 1.36 trillion yen (dlrs 9.7 billion) also the highest
level for any June.
	   Teikoku also said that bankruptcy cases for the first six months
of the year rose 29.5 percent to 10,173 from the same period last
year.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Cash-strapped Philippine Airlines
received approval Tuesday to dispose of about dlrs 1.75 million in
assets to raise money for its operations.
	   The assets to be sold include two unused flight control
computers, a boiler unit, nine new tow trucks, and aircraft parts.
They will be returned to suppliers for refunds, the airline said.
	   The Securities and Exchange Commission approved the disposal on
the condition that the money be used strictly for the airline's
operations.
	   All asset sales and disposals by Philippine Airlines beyond 3
million pesos (dlrs 71,500) now require approval from the SEC,
after the airline secured the commission's intercession last month
for a rehabilitation plan.
	   The airline has been in the red for some time. But the Asian
financial crisis and a recent devastating pilots' strike further
affected its operations, hurting its ability to pay maturing
obligations.
	   Philippine Airlines has 85 billion pesos (dlrs 2 billion) in
outstanding debt, incurred largely from a recent refleeting and
modernization program.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ An Israeli opposition leader met Jordanian
officials Tuesday on ways to restart Middle East peace talks.
	   Ehud Barak, head of the opposition Labor Party, met separately
with King Hussein and his brother and heir, Crown Prince Hassan.
They were the latest in a series of Jordanian meetings with Israeli
opposition leaders amid mounting frustration over the stalemate.
	   Former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres held talks Monday, a
day after a visit by Yossi Beilin, an opposition lawmaker.
	   A Jordanian government official said the meetings were ``aimed
at exchanging views on the stalled Mideast peace process, to listen
to the viewpoint of the Israeli Labor Party on the peace stalemate
and discuss ways to revive the peace process.''
	   The official, speaking on customary condition of anonymity,
declined to provide other details.
	   Jordan has become increasingly critical of the policies of the
right-wing Israeli administration. Amman is eager for a settlement
to ease opposition among its people to its 1994 treaty with Israel.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A Finland native who narrowly missed winning a seat
in Japan's Parliament says he hasn't given up his dream of becoming
a national legislator.
	   ``I feel I'm not defeated,'' Marutei Tsurunen told The
Associated Press on Tuesday. ``It was a good fight.''
	   Tsurunen, a Japanese citizen for 19 years, ran for a seat in
Kanagawa prefecture, or state, southwest of Tokyo, finishing
fourth. But only the top three finishers in his district are sent
to Parliament.
	   The 58-year-old Tsurunen, an independent city assemblyman in
Kanagawa since 1992, came in a mere 7,000 votes behind the
third-place finisher in Sunday's election. Tsurunen garnered
slightly over 500,000 votes.
	   Despite the loss, that was better than the first time he ran in
1995 when Tsurunen fell short by 30,000 votes.
	   In largely conformist Japan, the former Lutheran missionary
chose to emphasize his difference by campaigning on an unusual
issue: his genes.
	   He emphasized his blue eyes and evoked the symbolism of his
native Finland by urging voters to ``import a lawmaker direct from
the land of Santa Claus.''
	   Had he won, the northern Karelia native, would have become the
first Westerner to gain national office in Japan.
	   Tsurunen's original name was Martti Turunen, but took a
Japanese-sounding name as a requirement to become a citizen.
	   He promised a gentler, welfare-oriented society and cleaner
government, arguing that offering financial security in old age
would do wonders for Japan's struggling economy and boost consumer
spending.
	   Since the next upper house election isn't scheduled until 2001,
Tsurunen said he is considering running for the more powerful lower
house if the chamber is dissolved this year.
	   That could happen as some opposition parties are demanding just
that amid the political turmoil following the resignation of Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto on Monday.
	   ``I haven't given up yet,'' he said.

In change of position, Palestinians say they'll meet with Israelis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a change of position, the Palestinians said
Tuesday they are willing to meet with top Israeli officials in a
last attempt to break the 16-month deadlock over a West Bank troop
withdrawal.
	   With months of U.S. mediation efforts bearing little fruit, U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has asked both sides to meet
and try to resolve key sticking points without her help.
	   The U.S. peace initiative, first submitted in January, calls for
a gradual Israeli troop withdrawal from 13 percent of the West
Bank, with each pullback to be met by Palestinian security
gestures.
	   The Palestinians have accepted the U.S. initiative. However,
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he could not hand
over land until the Palestinians proved they were serious about
cracking down on Islamic militants.
	   The U.S. State Department spokesman, James Rubin, on Monday
sharply criticized Israel for suggesting it was up to the
Palestinians to make concessions. Rubin said the Palestinians had
``gone a long way'' to combat terrorism. Therefore, Rubin said,
Israel was wrong to say ``the ball is in the Palestinians' court.''
	   The chief Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat, said Albright
wants Israel and the Palestinians to try and settle two issues in
face-to-face meetings _ the scope of the withdrawal and the
procedure for changing the PLO Covenant.
	   Netanyahu claims the Palestinians never made good on a promise
to annul sections of the PLO charter calling for Israel's
destruction. The Palestinians say they fulfilled their commitment
when they assembled the Palestine National Council, the
Palestinians' parliament-in-exile, in 1996 and voted to rescind the
offending sections of the PLO founding charter.
	   Erekat said the Palestinians are willing to hold direct talks
with the Israelis, but that they don't expect much from such
contacts. ``In principle, we are not against meeting,'' Erekat
said, adding that a final decision would be made once Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat returned from China on Thursday.
	   Erekat said the Palestinians would not agree to a withdrawal
from less than 13 percent and considered the annulment of sections
of the PLO Covenant to be an issue that has long been settled.

British inflation falls from 6-year high to 3.7 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British inflation fell sharply last month from a
6-year high of 4.2 percent to 3.7 percent, according to official
figures released Tuesday.
	   The drop of half a percentage point in June eased pressure on
the Labor government, which has repeatedly missed its target for
consumer price increases, and brought some relief to exporters who
are still getting hit with high interest rates, a strong pound and
fallout from the economic crisis in Southeast Asia.
	   Inflation had risen from 4 percent in April to 4.2 percent in
May, the highest figure since May 1992 when it stood at 4.3
percent. At the time, the Treasury called the rising inflation
temporary and predicted it would retreat in July.
	   The underlying rate of inflation, which excludes mortgage
interest payments, fell from 3.2 percent in May to 2.8 percent in
June, still above the government's elusive target of 2.5 percent.
	   Since Labor's election victory in May 1997, the government has
only managed to hit the target once, in January.

Taiwanese invest dlrs 160.5 million in Malaysia in 1998's first

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Taiwanese companies invested dlrs
160.5 million in 26 projects in Malaysia in this year's first six
months, signaling growing business links between the countries
despite the absence of diplomatic ties.
	   Six of the projects, worth dlrs 13 million, were new while the
others were expansions or diversifications of existing projects,
Malaysian Trade and Industry Minister Rafidah Aziz said in Taipei
Monday, the domestic news agency, Bernama, reported.
	   The report gave no comparative figures for 1997.
	   ``The continued interest of Taiwanese investors in the
manufacturing and agriculture sectors is a testimony of their
confidence in the investment climate in Malaysia,'' she said at a
meeting with businesses in the Taiwanese capital.
	   Investments were mostly in manufacturing, aquaculture and
floriculture, she said.
	   Malaysia was the largest recipient of Taiwanese foreign direct
investment in the first quarter of 1998, accounting for 23 percent
of all Taiwanese investments in ASEAN member countries, Bernama
said, quoting a Taiwan government report.
	   The Association of Southeast Asian Nations groups Brunei,
Myanmar, Laos, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam, the Philippines,
Indonesia and Thailand.
	   Although Malaysia and Taiwan have no diplomatic relations,
business has been quietly growing. Last year, trade between
Malaysia and Taiwan amounted to dlrs 5.2 billion.
	   In April, Taiwan Premier Vincent Siew visited Malaysia along
with a 30-member business delegation.
	   The Chinese Embassy in Kuala Lumpur criticized the visit, even
though it was described by Malaysians as private. Beijing considers
Taiwan a breakaway province with no right to conduct its own
foreign affairs. It wants its diplomatic partners to shun formal
relations with Taiwan, seat of the Nationalist government driven
off the mainland by Communist forces in 1949.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Serbian opposition leaders to travel to Kosovo;
clash in Decani region; trims. &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ In their own search for peace in
Kosovo, Serbian opposition leaders on Tuesday left for the troubled
province for meetings with local Serb and possibly ethnic Albanian
politicians.
	   The ``Alliance for Change'' includes the most prominent
opposition parties and is led by former Yugoslav Premier Milan
Panic, a Serbian-American businessman.
	   ``The absolute priority is to establish peace and security in
Kosovo,'' said Zoran Djindjic, the leader of the Democratic Party
and former mayor of Belgrade.
	   But with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic _ who ordered the
police crackdown in Kosovo _ holding power in Serbia, the largest
of Yugoslavia's two republics, the mission has little more than
symbolic character, a fact recognized by the opposition leaders.
	   ``We have the possibility of proposing certain solutions, but we
do not have the influence to have those solutions implemented,''
said Djindjic before departure from Belgrade, capital of both
Serbia and Yugoslavia.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed since February when
Milosevic launched the crackdown on Albanian separatists who had
been attacking Serb police and military facilities.
	   In early reports of fighting Tuesday, the Yugoslav news agency
Tanjug said three Serbian policemen were wounded in attacks by
militants in the Decani region, close to the border with Albania.
The three _ all identified by name _ were expected to survive.
	   Their mission by the Serbian opposition comes ahead of a
potentially volatile period in Kosovo, with the leadership of the
Democratic League of Kosovo, the main ethnic Albanian party,
announcing that the first constituent session of the self-styled
Kosovo parliament would convene within a week.
	   The Serbian government does not recognize elections that chose
the parliament or made Ibrahim Rugova the president of Kosovo's
Albanians, 90 percent of the Serbian province's population. The
parliament, elected last March in an unofficial ballot, is
dominated by Rugova's party but has been boycotted by most other
Albanian parties.
	   The militant Kosovo Liberation Army, reportedly in control of
about 40 percent of Kosovo, has refused to heed any of the Albanian
political parties and are unlikely to recognize the authority of
either parliament or Rugova.
	   Earlier this month, other influential ethnic Albanian parties
proposed formation of an ethnic Albanian National Council, which
would include representatives from all parties and present a

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Angry protests in India's federal
legislature succeeded Tuesday in derailing an effort to set aside a
third of parliament's seats for women.
	   Speaker G.M.C. Balayogi told parliament the bill would not be
introduced ``for the time being.
	   ``Consensus has so far not been possible,'' Balayogi said. He
had met earlier in the day with leaders of political parties to try
to find a way to push the bill forward.
	   Women members greeted the announcement with loud protests.
Balayogi quickly adjourned the house for lunch.
	   On Monday, the bill's critics staged rowdy outbursts in
parliament, at one point snatching a copy of the draft legislation
from the hands of the law minister and ripping it to pieces.
	   The bill, meant to increase women's participation in India's
democracy, was first introduced in 1996 by a previous government
but met with similar opposition and never came to a vote. Religious
practice and tradition often keep women in the shadows in India.
	   Members of parties who rely on the votes of Muslims and lower
class Hindus say they won't let the bill be considered unless it
includes quotas within the quota for the groups they represent.
Women's groups say the quota-within-a-quota demand may be a tactic
to stall the bill, rather than a legitimate attempt to help
minorities.
	   An angry Mohini Giri, chairperson of the National Commission for
Women, led a group of women protesters in a demonstration outside
the Parliament building Tuesday.
	   ``The government should have introduced the bill and then
considered amendments ...,'' Giri said.
	   Veena Nayyar, president of the independent Women's Political
Watch, said a minority of men were afraid of losing their
parliamentary seats to women.
	   ``They just don't want to share decision-making power with
women,'' she said.
	   A similar measure was passed in 1995 for municipal and village
councils. Results have been mixed at the local level. Some women
politicians are merely fronts for husbands or fathers, or have been
ousted in no-confidence votes.

Japan suffers first death from antibiotic-resistant bacteria
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A stomach-cancer patient who died this spring was
infected with bacteria resistant to antibiotics, the first such
death in Japan, a health official said Tuesday.
	   The man, who was not identified, developed peritonitis _
inflammation of the membrane lining the abdomen _ after cancer
surgery, said Takeshi Sasaki of the Health and Welfare Ministry.
The patient was in his 60s.
	   Sasaki said the man was the first person with such an infection
to die in Japan, though he would not say precisely what the cause
of death was. The man was one of eight people in the country
confirmed to suffer from antibiotic-resistant infections.
	   Antibiotic resistance is a rapidly growing problem. Last summer,
doctors discovered that strains of one of the world's most common
and serious germs _ staph _ are developing resistance to
vancomycin, the antibiotic of last resort.
	   In the Japanese case, the man was infected with another
vancomycin-resistant germ, enterococcus, which is deadly for
surgery and cancer patients, Sasaki said.
	   The hard-to-kill germ is often spread when hospital workers do
not properly wash their hands.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's Central Bank said its hard-currency
reserves had fallen to dlrs 13.5 billion Tuesday, from 15.1 billion
earlier this month, but an international bailout should bolster
reserves soon.
	   Central Bank chairman Sergei Dubinin said he expects reserves to
rise by at least dlrs 5 billion as money begins to arrive from a
loan package announced by the International Monetary Fund and other
lenders Monday.
	   The bank has been spending U.S. dollars to support the Russian
ruble and prevent a possible devaluation. The loan package is
expected to take pressure off the ruble, which has been trading at
about 6.2 to the dollar.

German supreme court upholds controversial language reform
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNE THOMPSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Germany's highest court upheld reforms to the
German language on Tuesday, ruling against a couple who had tried
to fight the changes as unconstitutional.
	   The unanimous verdict clears the way for the reform to take
effect Aug. 1, and sets a legal precedent for 30 other challenges
to the language changes, a subject of passionate debate in this
rule-loving nation.
	   Gunda Diercks-Elsner and Thomas Elsner, from the northern town
of Luebeck, had filed the complaint last year arguing that the
language changes _ the first basic reform of German in nearly a
century _ deprived them of their basic right to guide their two
sons' education.
	   They also argued that the sweeping changes, decided on by state
cultural ministers who oversee education, should also have required
approval by the federal parliament.
	   In its ruling, the Federal Constitutional Court said the states
have the right to approve language reform and that the changes do
not injure the rights of parents or children.
	   Besides, the court said, the changes are relatively minor. They
include: shortening lengthy compound nouns; more consistent
spellings; reducing comma rules from 52 to nine; and limiting use
of the old German letter for a double ``s,'' which looks roughly
like a capital B.
	   Many German academics, authors and parents have opposed the
language reform, agreed to by officials from Germany, Switzerland
and Austria in 1996. Numerous legal challenges have sought to stop
the changes before they officially take effect, although many
schools adopted the new rules early.
	   Citizen groups in the state of Schleswig-Holstein _ where the
parents who brought the lawsuit live _ succeeded in forcing a
referendum on the changes. The vote is set for Sept. 27, alongside
federal parliamentary elections.
	   The parents had withdrawn their case from the high court last
week after Focus magazine quoted a government source as saying the
court had decided to reject their challenge. The judges ruled on
the case anyway, using their right to decide matters of public
interest even when the complaint has been dropped.

Study: Asian women frustrated with their lot
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: In graf 2, Ogilvy and Mather takes an ampersand &QL; 
 &UR; By JASMINA KUZMANOVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Though not rebelling openly, Asian women are
becoming increasingly frustrated with societies that pay them much
less than men and force them to juggle many responsibilities, a
study released Tuesday said.
	   Pay for women in Asia is only about 30 percent of what male
counterparts receive, said the study by Ogilvy and Mather Asia
Pacific, the region's largest advertising agency. In comparison,
Western women's pay is about 80 percent of men's.
	   ``We see a continued inequality here, in both developed and
underdeveloped regions,'' said Mark Blair, the agency's planning
director.
	   ``Quite simply, the life for women in Asia is not fair,'' he
said.
	   The study was conducted over several months in 22 Asian cities
in 11 countries: Japan, India, China with Hong Kong, Indonesia,
Malaysia, South Korea, the Philippines, Singapore, Sri Lanka,
Taiwan and Thailand.
	   About 1,200 mothers of dependent children responded to the
survey, which was conducted in person during group meetings. The
participants ranged in age from their mid-20s to late 40s, which is
also the most frequently targeted commercial group.
	   Unlike Western women, who express their resentment more openly,
Asian women ``simmer within, beneath the calm exterior,'' the study
said.
	   The reasons for their dissatisfaction are many: too little
money, too many responsibilities, too little respect, always taking
second place to their husbands, and having to put a lid on their
ambitions for the sake of the family.
	   ``Though not content with their roles, women in Asia accept them
more readily'' than their Western counterparts, Blair said. They
also sacrifice themselves more willingly, but expect reward and
recognition of their efforts.
	   Compared with the West, the feminist concept of sisterhood has
taken less root in Asian societies. Instead, the women here
associate themselves primarily with their family, and secondly with
their nation or country, the study said.
	   In prosperous Singapore, where women constitute 40 percent of
the work force, ``women actually enjoyed juggling their different
roles,'' Blair noted.
	   Singaporean women also were more concerned about ``keeping up''
with their peers and the society. Just one generation away from
relative poverty, many working mothers in Singapore saw their work
place as a ``breathing place'' where they can escape from the
demands of the home.
	   Higher expectations created by better education and increased
gender equality also made Singaporean women more sensitive about
returning to the role of a homemaker.
	   ``My husband worries that if I don't keep up with society, I'll
end up talking about the price of fish at wet market,'' one
Singaporean woman said.
	   The economic crisis that has troubled the region for the past
year was also reflected in women's lives.
	   Many women reported spending less on holidays and cutting down
on luxuries. Most said the crisis caused tension at home, with
husbands worrying about keeping their jobs.

East Timor's governor calls for calm after thousands leave

<TEXT>
	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ The Indonesian-appointed governor of East
Timor has called for calm after thousands left the territory amid
fears of a new outbreak of violent protests.
	   The exodus came ahead of a planned visit to Indonesia later this
week by Jamsheed Marker, the United Nations' special envoy for the
former Portuguese colony.
	   Fearing attack by indigenous Timorese, at least 20,000
non-Timorese Indonesian settlers have fled since late last month.
	   Some have driven from the East Timorese capital of Dili across
the land border into West Timor. Many have returned by boat to
homes on other islands.
	   Officials and some immigrants said they were afraid of possible
mass protests during Marker's visit and the 22nd anniversary Friday
of Indonesia's annexation of the half-island territory.
	   ``I hope Dili residents will reconsider their plan to leave
because the security apparatus will protect residents,'' Gov.
Abilio Soares told local reporters Monday.
	   ``If you receive any threats or are being terrorized, just
report this to the police, and they will investigate the case,'' he
said.
	   Dili was quiet Tuesday. Many shops were closed because their
owners had left, and there was little traffic. A few military
trucks patrolled.
	   ``We're facing problems,'' said Jose Guteres, a bus conductor.
``There aren't many passengers traveling around the city.''
	   Several protesters have been shot to death by Indonesian troops
recently during pro-independence demonstrations. There also have
been clashes between rival groups that either want East Timor to
break away from Indonesia or to remain part of it.
	   Some people in Dili have been threatened as tension builds. One
ethnic Chinese shopkeeper, who requested anonymity, said a man told
him to close his store and leave town, adding: ``Just give the key
to me, not to anybody else, because the key is mine.''
	   Because of security concerns, it was unclear Tuesday whether
Marker would visit East Timor or conduct meetings elsewhere in
Indonesia.
	   Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975, and annexed it a year
later. The United Nations, Portugal and many other governments
refuse to recognize Indonesian sovereignty there.
	   Over the past two decades, East Timor has endured a guerrilla
war and human rights abuses. Animosity between settlers from other
islands and indigenous Timorese is rife. Many Timorese complain
they remain poor as outsiders make money in the underdeveloped
territory.
	   Demonstrations on East Timor have intensified in recent weeks
following the resignation of Suharto as president in May.
	   His successor, B.J. Habibie, has promised more democracy and has
offered to grant a measure of autonomy to East Timor in return for
international recognition of Indonesian sovereignty.
	   However, Habibie has rejected a demand from separatists to hold
a referendum on possible independence.

Takanohana keeps sole lead, Akebono suffers second loss
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAGOYA, Japan (AP) _ Takanohana kept the sole lead at 10-0, but
fellow yokozuna (grand champion) Akebono suffered his second defeat
Tuesday with five days left in the 15-day Nagoya Grand Sumo
Tournament.
	   One victory behind Takanohana at 9-1 were Hawaiian-born ozeki
(champion) Musashimaru and No. 9 maegashira (senior wrestler)
Kotonowaka.
	   Tied with Akebono, or Chad Rowan from Hawaii, at 8-2 were new
yokozuna Wakanohana and ozeki Takanonami.
	   Takanohana, seeking his 19th tournament title, grabbed komusubi
(junior champion second class) Kaio's belt and easily forced him
out, leaving Kaio at 3-7.
	   No. 4 maegashira (senior wrestler) Dejima (7-3) fought off
Akebono's pushing attempts at the ring's edge and tossed him down.
	   Musashimaru, or Fiamalu Penitani, sent out winless No. 4
maegashira Tochinowaka with hand thrusts.
	   Kotonowaka and No. 8 maegashira Asahiyutaka (6-4) each tried arm
throws before Kotonowaka overpowered his foe and toppled him.
	   Wakanohana charged No. 5 maegashira Tochiazuma (5-5) with a
series of pulling attempts and drove him out.
	   Ozeki Takanonami twisted down No. 6 maegashira Hamanoshima
(3-7).
	   No. 11 maegashira Kyokushuzan (6-4), or Mongolian Batbayar
Davaa, threw down No. 14 maegashira Dewaarashi (3-7) after more
than 60 seconds of midring pushing. A sumo bout usually ends in 10
to 15 seconds.
	   No. 15 maegashira Kyokutenho (3-7), or Tsevegnyam Nyamjav, also
from Mongolia, downed No. 12 maegashira Kotoinazuma (4-6) with an
arm throw.
	   In makushita, the top junior division, No. 56-ranked Kitaazuma
(3-2), or Brazilian Tetsuya Takeda, sent out No. 59-ranked Ryuho.
	   In sandanme, the second-highest junior division, No. 65-ranked
Azumakaze (4-1), or Brazilian Tussato Guiuliano Kotinda, drove out
No. 72-ranked Wakaseijo, but No. 17-ranked Kyokutenzan (3-2), or
Mongolian Enkhbat Batmunkha, was thrown down by No. 16-ranked
Wakainami.
	   Wrestlers in junior divisions have only seven bouts during the
15-day tournament.

Manhunt continues as Seoul reviews policy toward North Korea

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ More troops were trucked and flown to
South Korea's jagged east coast Tuesday to join in what officials
feared would turn into a prolonged hunt for possible North Korean
infiltrators.
	   After three days of fruitless searching, Defense Ministry
officials said they were moving in more soldiers along a rocky
mountain range that runs to the North Korean border _ a possible
escape route offering a multitude of hiding places.
	   ``All measures are being taken to expand the dragnet and block
the likely escape routes on the east coast,'' said Col. Hwang
Dong-kyu, a spokesman for the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
	   ``We believe this is going to take some time,'' said a Defense
Ministry spokesman, Oh Jong-seok. ``We are prepared for a long
search.''
	   South Korea launched the manhunt after a diving suit-clad body
washed ashore Sunday. The dead man was armed with a submachine gun
and a hand grenade. Also found nearby was a torpedo-shaped
underwater propulsion device similar to ones used by North Korean
intruders in the past.
	   Officials believe the suspected North Korean agent died of a
heart attack and that two companions managed to come ashore and
might be trying to return to the North by land.
	   North Korea accused South Korean ultrarightists of staging the
incident to sabotage President Kim Dae-jung's policy of
accommodation and cooperation with the North.
	   ``We have nothing to do with the incident,'' the Pyongyang
government said in a statement carried Tuesday by its official
Korean Central News Agency.
	   South Korea said it lamented the North's ``deceitfulness'' and
demanded an immediate apology along with a pledge to halt further
intrusions.
	   With a dusk-to-dawn curfew in force on the east coast, soldiers
and police laid ambushes or searched rugged mountains and deep
valleys in a growing radius from Donghae, 195 kilometers (117
miles) east of Seoul, where the body was first discovered.
	   A Defense Ministry spokesman declined to say how many troops had
been committed to the search, but said the force had been increased
by 50 percent Tuesday.
	   It was the third North Korean infiltration reported along the
east coast, coming less than three weeks after a northern submarine
was found tangled in a fishing net on June 22.
	   Nine bodies were found in the small sub, all shot to death in
what military investigators described as a murder-suicide committed
by senior officers to avoid capture.
	   On Sept. 18, 1996, a larger North Korean submarine was found
stranded in the same general area, touching off a 53-day manhunt
for the craft's 26 occupants.
	   The manhunt by 60,000 soldiers, reservists and police left 37
people dead _ 24 North Koreans and 13 South Koreans _ and sent
relations between North and South Korea plunging to their lowest
level in years.
	   A North Korean infiltrator from that submarine was captured and
another was believed to have returned to the North across the land
border.
	   The latest incursion put a strain on President Kim Dae-jung's
policy of trying to open up the North's reclusive society through
expanded civilian economic, cultural and personal exchanges
	   Kim was to convene a full national security meeting Wednesday to
discuss specific South Korean countermeasures as his conservative
opposition criticized his policy as too naive.
	   The Koreas remain technically at war, with no peace treaty
signed at the end of their 1950-53 war.

U.S. appeals WTO ruling against shrimp import ban
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The United States has filed a formal notice of
appeal against a World Trade Organization ruling that U.S. import
restrictions on shrimp were inconsistent with its obligations, a
statement issued Tuesday by the U.S. Trade Representative said.
	   In April, a WTO panel decided that a U.S. embargo on shrimp
imports from India, Malaysia, Pakistan, and Thailand is an illegal
attempt to unilaterally impose U.S. standards on other countries.
	   Under a law restricting the import of shrimp harvested with
equipment that harms endangered species of sea turtles, the United
States has blocked shrimp imports from the four, which have
declined to adopt measures to ensure trawling nets won't ensnare
the turtles.
	   Environmentalists contend that failure to equip shrimp nets with
turtle-excluder devices costing dlrs 75 results in the death of
150,000 turtles a year worldwide.
	   The appeal will be heard by a three-member panel of the
Geneva-based WTO's standing Appellate Body, which functions as an
appeals court.
	   That body should issue its findings within 90 days, the U.S.
statement said.
	   It noted the comment by U.S. Trade Representative Charlene
Barshefsky at the time of the report that she believed the WTO
panel reached the wrong conclusion. She added the decision would
not change U.S. law or affect enforcement of the Endangered Species
Act.
	   The WTO agreement recognizes the rights of members to adopt
these types of laws for the purpose of conserving exhaustible
natural resources, Barshefsky said.

Prime minister's new residence to cost dlrs 4.25 million
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The prime minister's new residence
in Malaysia's proposed administrative capital will cost 17 million
ringgit (dlrs 4.25 million), Parliament was told Tuesday.
	   The residence had been planned keeping in mind the status of the
head of government and was designed to reflect Malaysia's
sovereignty and grandeur, Fauzi Abdul Rahman, deputy minister in
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's office, was quoted as saying by
Bernama news agency.
	   Fauzi Abdul made the disclosure in response to a question by a
member from the opposition party, Parti Islam SeMalaysia.
	   The dlrs 8 billion Putrajaya, a planned ``garden city'' 25
kilometers (16 miles) south of Kuala Lumpur, was among the big
civil works postponed because of Malaysia's economic crisis. But
parts of the projects are being completed.

France shows off military might on Bastille Day
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France celebrated Bastille Day Tuesday with a
parade showing off the nation's military might. But heady reminders
of the country's World Cup victory were never far away.
	   President Jacques Chirac set the tone, arriving at the
Champs-Elysees for a military parade with a small badge of the
World Cup mascot, ``Footix,'' on his dark blue suit.
	   All 22 members of France's World Cup-winning squad were guests
of honor at a garden party later Tuesday at Chirac's presidential
palace.
	   Thousands of people lined the Champs-Elysees to watch the
parade, with dozens of fighter jets and military helicopters
thundering over the famed avenue, and tanks rolling down toward the
Place de la Concorde.
	   The biggest cheer was for a parade of firemen who drove down the
avenue in their fire trucks.
	   The parade also featured The Republican Guard, riding horses and
wearing their gilded helmets with red plumes. In total, 4,000
troops took part.
	   The Champs-Elysees has been the scene of wild celebrations since
France clinched its first ever World Cup by beating Brazil 3-0 on
Sunday.
	   More than one million people flocked to the avenue Sunday night,
dancing and singing until the early hours of the morning. On
Monday, an estimated 800,000 people turned out to salute the French
team who paraded the World Cup on an open-top bus.
	   Bastille Day commemorates the storming by Parisians of the
Bastille prison on July 14, 1789, setting off the French Revolution
that toppled King Louis XVI and put an end to monarchy.
	   Defense Minister Alain Richard said the annual military parade
reflected France's defense restructuring to meet new international
peacekeeping obligations. He said the process began during the
presidency of Francois Mitterand.
	   ``We realized that after Bosnia and the Gulf War we had begun a
new chapter,'' Richard said in an interview with Europe-1 radio.

China concerned about suffering of Chinese in Indonesia riots
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China expressed ``concern and sympathy'' Tuesday
for ethnic Chinese attacked in bloody riots in Indonesia and called
on Indonesia's government to prevent further violence.
	   Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang noted that the
Indonesian authorities are investigating the May riots that led to
President Suharto's resignation.
	   Rioters targeted ethnic Chinese, resented for their dominance of
Indonesia's commercial life, and looted their homes and businesses.
Campaigners for women's rights charge that rape was used to
terrorize the Chinese community.
	   ``The Chinese side expresses its concern and sympathy toward the
Indonesian Chinese who suffered during the riots,'' Tang told
reporters in response to a question about reports that ethnic
Chinese women were raped.
	   ``As a friendly neighbor of Indonesia, the Chinese government
hopes that the Indonesian government will adopt effective measures
so that Indonesian people of all ethnic groups, including Chinese,
will live and work in contentment, and continue to make
contributions to the social development and economic prosperity of
Indonesia,'' Tang said at a briefing.
	   The newspaper Jakarta Post on Tuesday quoted the Volunteers for
Humanity group as saying it had documented the rapes of 168 girls
and women, starting in the mid-May riots and continuing through
July 3 in sporadic unrest in Jakarta and four other cities.
	   The group alleged that 20 rape victims were murdered by their
assailants, were left to die in burning buildings or later died of
wounds inflicted when they were attacked.
	   The report backed claims by other human rights groups that many
of those attacked were members of Indonesia's ethnic Chinese
minority.
	   Since then, Suharto's successor, President B.J. Habibie, has set
up an anti-rape task force.

China says U.S. government should rein in Senate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China demanded Tuesday that the Clinton
administration take steps to rein in the U.S. Congress to put a
stop to resolutions Beijing sees as hostile.
	   The Chinese Foreign Ministry was reacting to Senate votes Friday
that reaffirmed U.S. commitments toward Taiwan and supported the
island's entry into the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.
	   China regards Taiwan, which has ruled itself since a civil war
ended in 1949, as a rebel province that foreign governments should
not support. China says the island is unqualified to join bodies
such as the World Bank because it is part of China and not a
sovereign state.
	   ``We are strongly opposed and express our dissatisfaction'' at
the Senate resolutions that were aimed at ``interfering in China's
internal affairs,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang said.
	   Some members of the U.S. Congress are presenting ``anti-China
resolutions one after the other, trying to obstruct the improvement
and development of China-U.S. relations. They will not succeed in
their attempts,'' Tang said at a briefing for reporters.
	   ``We hope that the U.S. government will adopt effective measures
to eliminate interference and prevent the Congress from passing
anti-China resolutions so that Sino-U.S. relations will not be
harmed,'' Tang said.
	   The U.S. constitution entitles the government ``to adopt
effective measures to prevent the Congress from passing such
resolutions,'' Tang added without elaborating.
	   The Senate votes Friday were a response to remarks made by
President Bill Clinton during his recent tour of China that
supported Beijing's claims to Taiwan.
	   Clinton publicly restated Washington's opposition to any efforts
by Taiwan to declare independence, or join bodies such as the
United Nations for which statehood is required.
	   Taiwanese leaders criticized his remarks, fearing they could
undermine their efforts to win more world recognition for Taiwan.
Congressional conservatives also were critical, prompting Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott to introduce Friday's resolution to
``repair the damage'' he said Clinton's remarks had caused.
	   The resolution repeated a U.S. pledge to help Taiwan ``maintain
a sufficient self-defense capability'' and called on China to
renounce the use of force against the island.

Spanish bull-running festival ends with one person injured
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PAMPLONA, Spain (AP) _ Some 2,000 people raced in the final
bull-run of Spain's annual San Fermin festival Tuesday, with one
person suffering head injuries from a fall.
	   Hundreds of thousands of visitors flock each year to the San
Fermin fiesta whose main attraction is the dawn bull run.
Participants test their bravery and speed by racing ahead of six
bulls through the cobblestone streets of this small northern town.
	   The bulls are fought, and invariably killed, by professional
matadors in the town's bull ring later in the day.
	   One Spaniard was treated for head injuries after falling during
the final run, according to the local government press department.
He was later released from hospital.
	   The centuries-old festival, which includes nine days of non-stop
revelry, became increasingly popular internationally following the
publication in 1927 of Ernest Hemingway's ``Fiesta _ The Sun Also
Rises'' based on the writer's experiences in Pamplona.
	   Injuries are frequent in the runs and death always a
possibility. This year just three people were treated for horn
wounds although none were in serious condition.
	   The last fatality was a 22-year-old American who was gored to
death in 1995, the 13th runner to die since officials began keeping
records in 1924.

<TEXT>
	   RAS AL-KHAIMAH, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ A Ukrainian cargo
plane with eight crew members on board burst into flames minutes
after taking off and crashed into the sea, aviation officials and
witnesses said Tuesday. All aboard were believed killed.
	   Divers recovered body parts Tuesday belonging to six of the crew
members, a coast guard official said on condition of anonymity.
	   The four-engine Ilyushin-76 was owned by Ukraine's Defense
Ministry and was on lease to a private Kiev-based cargo airline,
A.T.I. Aircompany, the Ukrainian Emergency Situations Ministry
said.
	   Officials said the plane, with a crew of seven military men and
a civilian, was carrying 40 tons of unspecified cargo from the Gulf
emirate of Ras Al-Khaimah to Mykolayiv in southern Ukraine.
Russia's Interfax news agency said the cargo was not dangerous.
	   A.T.I. officials in Kiev confirmed the crash but would not
comment further. Stu Carrie, manager of Ras Al-Khaimah airport,
said the plane was about 15 years old.
	   Officials at the Emergency Situations Ministry, who spoke on
customary condition of anonymity, said the pilot had attempted a
sea landing after the engine caught fire.
	   Mohammed Al-Ghaith, an Emirates' civil aviation official heading
the crash investigation, said there were no technical faults when
the flight took off at 11 p.m. (1900 GMT) Monday.
	   ``We can't guess. There is no room for guessing,'' he said when
asked about the cause of the crash. He said divers were still
looking for the plane's black box, which records in-flight data.
	   Initial reports by the official Emirates News Agency said the
aircraft belonged to Azerbaijani Airlines.
	   Mohammad Hussein, a 46-year-old businessman, said he saw the
plane catch fire minutes after take-off and then explode before it
crashed into the sea 500 meters (550 yards) from shore. Hundreds of
watermelons were floating in the sea after the crash, he said.
	   An airport official said diving teams initially had difficulty
getting close to the plane due to the heat of the burning wreckage.
	   In the states of the former Soviet Union, it is not uncommon for
private companies to charter military planes for cargo flights, and
the Emirates has a flourishing trade with the region.
	   The Ras al-Khaimah airport receives about 40 flights every week
from cities in the former Soviet Union, where air safety has
declined dramatically as many cash-strapped airlines have failed to
provide adequate maintenance of aging aircraft.
	   In December, 85 people were killed when a Tajik airliner crashed
in the emirate of Sharjah.

Palestinians change position, say they'll meet with Israelis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The Palestinians, in a change of position, said
Tuesday they are willing to meet with top Israeli officials in a
last-ditch effort to break the 16-month deadlock over a West Bank
troop withdrawal.
	   With months of U.S. mediation efforts bearing little fruit, U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has asked both sides to meet
and try to resolve key sticking points without her help.
	   The U.S. peace initiative, first submitted in January, calls for
a gradual Israeli troop withdrawal from 13 percent of the occupied
West Bank, with each pullback to be met by Palestinian security
gestures. Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967
Mideast war.
	   The Palestinians have accepted the U.S. initiative. However,
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he could not hand
over land until the Palestinians proved they were serious about
cracking down on Islamic militants.
	   The U.S. State Department spokesman, James Rubin, on Monday
sharply criticized Israel for suggesting it was up to the
Palestinians to make concessions. Rubin said the Palestinians had
``gone a long way'' to combat terrorism. Therefore, Rubin said,
Israel was wrong to say ``the ball is in the Palestinians' court.''
	   The chief Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat, said Albright
wants Israel and the Palestinians to try and settle two issues in
face-to-face meetings _ the scope of the withdrawal and the
procedure for changing the PLO Covenant.
	   Netanyahu claims the Palestinians never made good on a promise
to annul sections of the PLO charter calling for Israel's
destruction. The Palestinians say they fulfilled their commitment
when they assembled the Palestine National Council, the
Palestinians' parliament-in-exile, in 1996 and voted to rescind the
offending sections of the PLO founding charter.
	   Erekat said the Palestinians are willing to hold direct talks
with the Israelis but that they don't expect much from such
contacts. ``In principle, we are not against meeting,'' Erekat
said, adding that a final decision would be made once Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat returned from China on Thursday.
	   Erekat said the Palestinians would not agree to a withdrawal
from less than 13 percent and considered the annulment of sections
of the PLO Covenant to be an issue that has long been settled.

Chinese minister visits Taiwan for technology exchange
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ In a sign of warming relations, a Chinese
minister arrived in Taiwan Tuesday to promote technology exchanges
in only the second minister-level visit from China in nearly half a
century.
	   Zhu Lilan, head of China's Science and Technology Ministry, was
to attend a technology seminar and meet industry leaders during her
eight-day visit in her private capacity as a Beijing University
professor.
	   ``We need to strengthen our technological cooperation with the
advent of the 21st century,'' Zhu told reporters. ``It shall help
to make the Chinese people become more prosperous.''
	   Her visit will enhance understanding and prepare for the day
when political hostilities ease to make large-scale cooperation
possible, said Shih Chin-tai, president of the Industrial
Technology Research Institute, a co-sponsor of the seminar.
	   Obstacles remain at this stage, Shih said, but he believes
Taiwanese and Chinese industries will eventually be integrated to
share resources.
	   Taiwan is the seat of the Nationalist government driven from
mainland China by Communist forces in 1949. China considers Taiwan
a renegade province, and the two governments do not recognize each
other.
	   The two sides only slowly resumed contacts through semi-official
negotiating bodies early this year following a three-year deadlock
resulting from China's anger over a Taiwanese campaign to gain
international recognition.
	   China has tried to promote trade and cultural exchanges to avoid
having the hostile political climate alienate Taiwanese.
	   Wu Shaozu, minister of the Chinese State Physical, Cultural and
Sports Commission, visited Taiwan early last year in his capacity
as president of the Chinese Olympic Committee. The sports
commission was later downgraded in a government restructuring last
March.
	   Another 90-member Chinese delegation of scholars and
professionals arrived in Taiwan Tuesday to attend the weeklong
seminar on cross-strait technology exchanges. The seminar, first of
its kind, opens Wednesday.
	   The Chinese delegates will present their latest technology in
communications, chemistry, machinery and aeronautics with the hope
of selling it to Taiwanese industries, officials said.
	   Officials said Taiwanese industries will be able to make use of
some of the technology, but refused to predict how large the market
will be.
	   Taiwanese investors have sunk U.S. dlrs 30 billion into China.
Taiwanese authorities have discouraged high-tech and infrastructure
investment in China for fear Taiwan's economy would eventually be
absorbed by China if business ties develop unchecked.

Sparse protest marks anniversary of deadly bridge collapse
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RAMAT GAN, Israel (AP) _ Several dozen protesters marked the
anniversary Tuesday of the deadly collapse of a footbridge leading
to the opening ceremonies of Israel's Maccabiah Games, and called
for the clean-up of the polluted river below.
	   Four Australian athletes died and dozens were injured after
being plunged into the Yarkon River last July 14. Two of the
deaths, which came weeks after the accident, have been blamed on
the polluted waters of the river, although
	   ``One year after the event, the pollution level is higher than
it was a year ago, yet nothing is being done,'' said Dianne
Steinman, president of Executive Council of Australian Jewry, who
took part in Tuesday's protest at the bridge site. At one point, a
dead fish floated past in the murky green water.
	   Five people, including the games organizing committee chairman,
are on trial in Tel Aviv on charges of criminal negligence in
connection with the bridge collapse.
	   But Steinman reiterated the Australian demand for an independent
parliamentary inquiry.
	   ``We have to satisfy the competitors and their parents that it
will be entirely safe to enter the next games'' in 2001, Steinman
said. ``We feel that sufficent attention was not paid to the safety
of competitors. We are not just looking for those responsible a
year ago. We are looking to the future to ensure that it will be
safe to return.''
	   The families of some of the victims have called for Australia to
launch an international campaign against the Israeli government and
to boycott the next games if there is no independent inquiry.
Maccabiah Australia has made no official announcement on the
question.
	   Steinman said the Australian Jewish community would make its
feelings known when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visits
Australia next month.
	   Tuesday's demonstration was organized by the Council for a
Beautiful Israel and the Israel Union for Environmental Defense.
The few dozen participants were outnumbered by journalists.
	   Relatives of the victims held memorial services last week in
Australia. But Colin Elterman, whose daughter spent 10 months in
critical condition after she fell into the Yarkon, said they had
refused to take part in official memorials in Israel.

Russian prime minister makes debut visit to Beijing

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Russian Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko arrived
in Beijing Tuesday to discuss boosting sagging trade and investing
in China's energy sector.
	   The five-hour stopover on his way home from Japan marked
Kiriyenko's first trip to Russia's powerful neighbor and former
socialist adversary since he took over as prime minister in April.
	   Kiriyenko met with Premier Zhu Rongji for talks on trade and
other issues, and was to see Chinese President Jiang Zemin later
Tuesday. The meetings were partly to prepare for Jiang's visit to
Russia in September, said Evgueni Verlin, a Russian Embassy
spokesman.
	   Kiriyenko is on ``a working visit to discuss problems with trade
and to search for breakthroughs, especially in the field of
energy,'' said Verlin.
	   The Russian prime minister and Zhu were to discuss projects to
pipe gas from eastern Siberia and build a nuclear power plant in
eastern China's Lianyungang, Verlin said.
	   Financing is believed to have been a problem for the projects.
Verlin noted that Kiriyenko is accompanied by Russia's ministers
for finance and atomic energy.
	   Scientific cooperation and measures to boost slackening trade _
by opening Chinese department stores in Moscow and other Russian
cities, for example _ also were to be discussed, Verlin said.
	   Russia and China have set a U.S. dlrs 20 billion target for
two-way trade by 2000. But commerce between them amounted to just
U.S. dlrs 6.12 billion in 1997, down 10 percent from the previous
year.
	   Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov will follow up with
further talks on a visit to China July 22-26, said Chinese Foreign
Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ In their own search for peace in
Kosovo, Serbian opposition leaders headed to the contested province
on Tuesday for meetings with local Serb and possibly ethnic
Albanian politicians.
	   The group, calling itself the ``Alliance for Change,'' includes
members of prominent opposition parties and is led by former
Yugoslav Premier Milan Panic, a Serbian-American businessman.
	   ``The absolute priority is to establish peace and security in
Kosovo,'' said Zoran Djindjic, leader of the Democratic Party and
the former mayor of Belgrade.
	   However, the mission had little more than symbolic value because
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, who ordered the police
crackdown in Kosovo, also holds power in Serbia, the largest of
Yugoslavia's two republics.
	   ``We have the possibility of proposing certain solutions, but we
do not have the influence to have those solutions implemented,''
Djindjic said before departing from Belgrade, the capital of both
Serbia and Yugoslavia.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed since February when
Milosevic launched the crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists who
had attacked Serb police and military facilities. Ethnic Albanians
comprise 90 percent of the Serbian province's population, but Serbs
consider Kosovo an essential part of Serbia and refuse to give it
up.
	   Western powers fear the fighting could spark a wider war in the
Balkans and have tried to help negotiate a peaceful solution to the
conflict.
	   In early reports of fighting Tuesday, the Yugoslav news agency
Tanjug said three Serbian policemen were wounded in attacks by
militants in the Decani region, close to the border with Albania.
The three _ all identified by name _ were expected to survive.
	   The Serbian opposition's mission comes on the eve of a
potentially volatile period in Kosovo. The leadership of the
Democratic League of Kosovo, the main ethnic Albanian party,
announced that the first session of the self-styled Kosovo
parliament would convene within a week.
	   The Serbian government does not recognize elections that chose
the parliament or made Ibrahim Rugova the president of Kosovo's
Albanians. The parliament, elected last March in an unofficial
ballot, is dominated by Rugova's party, but most other Albanian
parties have boycotted it.
	   The militant Kosovo Liberation Army, which reportedly controls
about 40 percent of Kosovo, has refused to obey any of the ethnic
Albanian political parties and is unlikely to recognize the
authority of either the parliament or Rugova.
	   Earlier this month, other Albanian parties proposed forming an
ethnic Albanian National Council, to include representatives from
all parties and the KLA. But Rugova apparently rejected the
proposal.

Shipowner in custody pending hearing on shooting of rival
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PIRAEUS, Greece (AP) _ A member of one of Greece's most
prominent shipping families was held in custody Tuesday pending a
hearing on charges he took part in the shooting of a business
rival.
	   Vangelis Ventouris, 39, was accused of attempted murder and
illegal use of a weapon after rival shipowner Constantinos
Agapitos, 40, identified him as one of two attackers who shot him
early Monday. The attackers drove past Agapitos' car on a
motorcycle in Pireaus, about 10 kilometers (six miles) south of
Athens.
	   Agapitos was shot in his legs and right shoulder, but doctors
said his life was not in danger.
	   Ventouris' hearing was scheduled for Thursday, when a judge
could order a trial or toss out the charges.
	   Ventouris has denied any involvement in the attack, saying he
was watching the World Cup final with friends when it occurred.
	   ``It saddens me that a person who was hit is accusing me,''
Ventouris told reporters. ``I have complete trust in the justice
system.''
	   Police who searched his home found a motorcycle which fits the
description of the one used in the attack. They also found a
.38-caliber revolver. A ballistics report was ordered to determine
if it was the weapon used, media reports said.
	   Agapitos told police he began receiving threatening telephone
calls after his recent purchase of the ferry Panagia Tinou II,
which had been seized by the National Bank from Ventouris Sea
Lines, run by Vangelis Ventouris.
	   Agapitos, whose family owns the Agapitos Lines passenger
ferries, is in charge of the Agapitos Express Ferries division,
which has seven vessels.

activists prior to Suharto's resignation as president two months
ago, news reports said.
	   Human rights groups say as many as 24 activists were abducted
and that at least nine remain missing.
	   Military Police Commander Maj. Gen. Syamsu Djalal said the
arrested soldiers were officers and enlisted men within the ranks
of Kompassus, Indonesia's special forces group, the official Antara
news agency reported.
	   He refused to name them, but said they were detained after a
thorough investigation, including the questioning of 43 witnesses,
among them 20 military personnel.
	   Djalal said the investigation was continuing and more arrests
might follow.
	   Suharto, who maintained power for 32 years with the support of
the powerful military, quit in May after bloody rioting followed
weeks of protests by students demanding democratic reform.
	   The newspaper Suara Pembaruan reported that the arrested
soldiers were being held at Jakarta's military headquarters.
	   Earlier, military spokesman Brig. Gen. Syamsul Ma'arif said the
men had been ordered to investigate the activities of several
anti-government protesters. However, they went beyond this order
and allegedly took the activists captive, he said.
	   Some activists, who are now free, have testified to Indonesia's
National Human Rights Commission that they were abducted by masked
men, tortured and questioned about their political activities.
	   Meanwhile, Jakarta's newly appointed military commander has
ordered his troops to watch for early signs of unrest as the worst
economic crisis in 30 years continues to bite, the Jakarta Post
reported.
	   At the time of the May rioting, Jakarta's security forces, under
a different commander, were criticized for not taking swift action
to quell the violence, in which about 1,200 people were killed.
	   Angry mobs targeted members of the ethnic Chinese community.
Hundreds of Chinese-owned stores and homes were burned and women's
groups say scores of Chinese women and girls were raped.
	   Some indigenous Indonesians have made Chinese people the
scapegoats for rising unemployment and soaring inflation.
	   In Beijing Tuesday, China expressed ``concern and sympathy'' for
ethnic Chinese who were attacked and called on Indonesia's
government to prevent further violence.
	   Some fear that violence might return to the streets if the
economic situation worsens.
	   Speaking after he was sworn in Monday, Maj. Gen. Djadja
Suparman, 49, said his troops would work ``hand-in-hand'' with all
residents of Jakarta, regardless of their social and cultural
backgrounds.
	   ``The riots, destruction, looting and arson in Jakarta and other
regions in mid-May are still fresh in our minds,'' he said. ``We
all realize now that the tragedy could degrade Indonesia's positive
image in the international community and damage our political and
economic growth.''

	   VIRGINIA WATER, England (AP) _ Lee Westwood reclaimed No.1
position on the PGA European tour money list with a convincing win

the European tour money-list.
	   Montgomerie, who lost the Irish Open at Druids Glen in a playoff
the previous week, finished five strokes behind Westwood at Loch
Lomond in equal-seventh position.
	   He slipped back to No.2 on the European tour money list with
dlrs 715,940.
	   South Africa's Ernie Els, who has slipped from No.2 to No.4 on
the PGA tours international money list, has also fallen from No.1
to No.3 on the European tour money list with winnings of dlrs
625,370.

Security officials clear away roadblocks; bus service resumes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ Taxi and mini-buses service resumed in
the Somali capital Tuesday after security officials cleared away
dozens of roadblocks manned by freelance gunmen demanding money
from drivers.
	   The privately owned mini-buses _ the main means of public
transport _ stopped running Sunday. On some routes, there were 10
or more, each charging 5,000 Somali shillings (65 U.S. cents) to
pass.
	   Security personnel working for faction leader Ali Mahdi Mohamed,
who controls north Mogadishu, said they had cleared away 20
roadblocks Monday on roads connecting the northern and southern
parts of the city.
	   Officials loyal to south Mogadishu faction leader Hussein
Mohamed Aidid cleared away another 17 roadblocks from the main road
leading south to Afgoie.
	   Also in north Mogadishu, gunmen loyal to Sheikh Ali Sheikh
Mohamud, who ran the now-defunct Islamic Court, detained at least a
dozen freelance gunmen not allied to any particular faction.
	   Those captured were whipped in public and their guns were
confiscated, witness Nur Omar Mohamed said, adding that many gunmen
managed to escape.
	   The rise in highway robberies, banditry and extortion by the
freelance gunmen has increased tensions in the war-torn capital
where Ali Mahdi and Aidid have been attempting to create a unified
municipal administration.
	   The gunmen appear to be trying to make as much money as possible
before this happens.
	   Ali Mahdi, Aidid and a third faction leader, Hassan Osman Ali
Atto, returned Saturday from a five-day trip to Libya where they
met with Libyan leader Moammar Ghadafi.
	   Ghadafi, who is known to be close to Aidid and has reportedly
provided him with arms and militia equipment, is said to be
pressing Somali leaders to resume talks on establishing a joint
administration in Mogadishu and reopening air and sea ports closed
because of factional rivalry.
	   Aidid said Ghadafi has guaranteed to pay all the city's
expenditures and the upkeep of a 6,000-man police force ``if the
Somalis can help themselves.''
	   Last December in Cairo, the three Mogadishu faction leaders and
21 others agreed to form an interim government and hold a national
reconcilation conference.
	   But the conference in the central town of Baidoa, which is
controlled by Aidid's forces, has been postponed three times for
lack of funds _ and security.
	   There has been no central government in Somalia since Aidid's
father _ Gen. Mohamed Farah Aidid _ and Ali Madhi joined forces in
1991 to oust dictator Mohamed Siad Barre, then turned on each other
as the country disintegrated into warring fiefdoms.

U.N. refugee agency reports worsening situation in Angola
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The U.N. refugee agency said Tuesday thousands of
refugees have fled into Congo to escape fighting in Angola.
	   Some 22,000 refugees are now camped out in the Kisangi area in
the south-eastern region of Congo, said Kris Janowski, spokesman
for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.
	   Last week, some 7,000 refugees crossed the border from Angola to
Congo to escape continuing clashes between Angolan government
forces and UNITA rebels.
	   Janowski said UNHCR is buying food supplies in Congo which it
intends to try to transport to the refugees within a few days.
	   Attacks by suspected members of the former rebel movement UNITA
on police and civilians in remote areas of the country are
threatening to derail Angola's 1994 peace pact.
	   The government says remnants of UNITA's 70,000-strong guerrilla
army are responsible for the attacks. UNITA has angrily rejected
the accusations, blaming roaming gangs of bandits for the
incidents.

Deposed Cambodian co-premier denies raising private army
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Cambodia-Election &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KHUM PONGROR, Cambodia (AP) _ Prince Norodom Ranariddh on
Tuesday denied allegations that his political party was building up
its own private army, calling them a fabrication to hurt his
chances in the July 26 election.
	   Ranariddh said the government of strongman Hun Sen fabricated
the charge because it was worried by the large crowds that have
shown up at opposition rallies since the election campaign began
last month.
	   ``The only way they can think to stop FUNCINPEC (party) is by
launching accusations,'' Ranariddh said. ``I would like to
completely deny them.''
	   ``I don't have even the slightest plan or interest to create any
army, which would be illegal,'' he added.
	   Last week, the Ministry of Defense wrote a letter to the
National Election Committee accusing Ranariddh's party of having
``illegal troops.''
	   Earlier, when the allegation first surfaced, Hun Sen warned in a
speech that ``it is very dangerous to use force. No one can beat
Hun Sen by using force.''
	   Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party won U.N.-sponsored polls in 1993,
but was forced to form a coalition government with Hun Sen's
Cambodian People's Party, and the two men became co-premiers. Hun
Sen ousted Ranariddh in a coup a year ago, becoming the country's
undisputed sole leader.
	   The allegations of what would amount to an illegal armed plot
could be used as a pretext by Hun Sen for moving violently against
his opponents, as he has in the past.
	   In the weeks before deposing Ranariddh last year, Hun Sen
accused the prince of bringing ex-Khmer Rouge guerrillas into the
capital to stage his own seizure of power.
	   Ranariddh also said Tuesday that if he wins the elections, he
will tackle the problem of Vietnamese living illegally in Cambodia.
	   Speaking to supporters at a pagoda in Kompong Chhnang province,
Ranariddh repeated his warning that if Hun Sen's party wins, the
number of Vietnamese living in Cambodia will mount.
	   ``Voting correctly will bring down the number of Yuon,'' he told
the crowd of about 800 supporters, using a derogatory word for
Vietnamese.
	   Hun Sen is identified by many Cambodians with the decade-long
Vietnamese occupation that followed Hanoi's invasion in 1979, which
overthrew the genocidal Khmer Rouge regime. He was a key figure in
the government installed by Hanoi.
	   Ranariddh and other opposition figures have frequently been
exploiting traditional prejudice against Vietnamese to win support.
	   ``If you don't want our lakes depleted of fish, who will you
vote for?'' Ranariddh called to the crowd.
	   ``FUNCINPEC!'' they roared back.
	   ``If you don't want forests raped of trees, who will you vote
for?'' he asked, to which the crowd again yelled, ``FUNCINPEC!''
	   Ranariddh and other opposition politicians have alleged that as
many as 6,000 Vietnamese have been illegally allowed to register to
vote. They say actual numbers might be much higher, and could tilt
the polls in Hun Sen's favor.
	   A National Election Committee spokesman, Samraing Kamsan, said
the body had urged all provincial electoral commissions to review
their lists of registered voters.
	   More than 1,300 people so far have been identified as illegal
immigrants, almost all of them in Phnom Penh, he said at a news
conference Monday.
	   He said their names would be dropped from the voter rolls, but
refused to specify their nationalities.

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Indian soldiers arranged piles of
plastic explosives and racks of rifles and rocket launchers in a
parliament building Tuesday to show lethal evidence of the Kashmiri
uprising to the politicians who control military spending.
	   The three-day display of arms seized from Kashmiri militants
opened on Tuesday, with Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee,
several members of his Cabinet and other lawmakers in attendance.
Army officials said policy makers needed to know about the
challenges their troops faced.
	   ``This is to make the people aware of the importance of the
Pakistani threat and how sinister it is,'' said Lal Krishna Advani,
the hard-line home minister in charge of security in the
Indian-held part of Kashmir.
	   ``It is a war, although it is a proxy war. We are determined to
see that this proxy war is defeated,'' Advani said.
	   New Delhi accuses officially Islamic Pakistan of backing a
9-year-old insurgency in Jammu-Kashmir, the only Muslim-majority
state in predominantly Hindu India. Pakistan says it lends only
moral support to the militants.
	   The Himalayan territory of Kashmir is divided between India and
Pakistan. Both countries lay claim to the whole territory, and they
have fought two wars over it since 1947.
	   The 700 weapons on display for members of parliament were seized
over the last decade in clashes between Kashmiri fighters and
Indian troops.
	   In a budget expected to be enacted on Friday, Finance Minister
Yashwant Sinha proposed a 14.3 percent increase in defense spending
over last year's level, to 412 billion rupees (dlrs 10 billion).
But he said he would consider a greater increase.
	   Annual defense spending has taken up about 2.4 percent of
India's gross domestic product over the past decade. Lawmakers in
the past have demanded that defense spending be raised to 3 percent
of GDP.

Funeral for Northern Ireland's three brothers, victims of hatred

<TEXT>
	   BALLYMONEY, Northern Ireland (AP) _ As a mournful church bell
tolled Tuesday morning, the small coffins of three young brothers
were carried by pallbearers into a rural church near the home where
they died in a sectarian firebomb attack, victims of a war of
hatred in Northern Ireland.
	   A crowd outside the Roman Catholic Church of Our Lady and St.
Patrick stood in silence, some wiping tears as Richard, Mark and
Jason Quinn who were raised as Protestants began their final
journey, followed by their grief-stricking parents and surviving
brother.
	   Pictures of the boys in happier times lay on the top of the
white coffins with brass nameplates and crosses.
	   As the coffins were carried from their grandmother's bungalow in
Rasharkin, about 7 miles 12 kms) away, friends and neighbors
sobbed. Their father, John Dillon, wept and stroked the coffin he
carried. Their mother, Chrissie Quinn, 29, her eyes red from
crying, led a procession of dozens of relatives and friends as well
as fire officers who tried to save the children.
	   Tensions spilling over from a blocked Protestant march outside a
rural church near Portadown were blamed for the early Sunday
morning firebombing of the Quinn house. Police said they believed
the family was targeted because Chrissie Quinn lived there with her
Protestant boyfriend.
	   Two men were being questioned, police said.
	   Inside the packed church, the Rev. Peter Forde told the
congregation that many people were undoubtedly asking whether it
was God's will that three young boys would be killed by a firebomb.
	   ``God would not have chosen it this way. I'm sure he had good
and interesting plans for Richard and for Mark and for Jason. But
someone, certainly not through God's will, stopped those plans,''
he said.
	   ``We meet in sorrow at the deaths of these children, but our
shared sorrow is a beacon of hope for the whole community. In this
our troubled country, may it light our way ahead,'' Forde said.
	   Forde said Monday that nothing could prepare him for the
``unnatural'' sight of a trio of little coffins in the special
funeral Mass, but he hoped his carefully chosen words would make a
difference to the Quinn family, and to the watching world.
	   ``It is not the place to be political,'' he said. ``But three
children who had just begun life were lent to us, and we as a
society failed in our responsibility.''
	   Irene Quinn, the boys' grandmother, said her daughter wanted
them buried in Rasharkin, where the family has its roots, so she
never again would have to set foot in Ballymoney. Chrissie Quinn's
oldest son, 13-year-old Lee, spent Saturday night with his
grandmother and so escaped the attack.
	   Ms. Quinn is Catholic, but was raising the boys as Protestants
because she thought it would make life easier for them in
Ballymoney, a hard-line Protestant stronghold about 40 miles (60
kms) northwest of Belfast.
	   -- FOLLOWING MATERIAL EMBARGOED UNTIL 1100 GMT --
	   The Most Rev. Patrick Walsh, Bishop of Down and Connor, told the
congregation that in the wake of the horrific murders ``voices have
been raised _ voices of sanity, voices of reason. Agonizing words,
words of self-examination, courageous words, words of strength,
words of healing have been spoken.''
	   ``The time for words is over. It is now time for silence, a
silence in which we will hear the voice of God,'' he said. ``...
There is silence on this sad day here in Ballymoney and in
Rasharkin _ may that silence fall over every town and village in
our land, not a brooding silence but the silence in which we can
all listen to what God is saying to us. Or will silent voice try to
drown out once more the quiet voice of God?''
	   --END EMBARGOED MATERIAL--
	   Forde said the boys' mother retreated into shock but she
insisted that her sons must receive a Catholic funeral and burial.
	   ``She's physically incapable of doing anything more than nodding
her head and shaking it, it's all so new to her,'' he said. ``But
she was adamant that it all be Catholic. On that point, she had no
hesitation.''
	   Members of the Protestant Orange Order shied away from
confrontation Monday in marches across Northern Ireland, weighed
down by their own bitter divisions and subdued by the shock of the
deaths of the boys, who were 11, 10 and 9.
	   At hundreds of marches, Orangemen paused for silence in respect
for the siblings.
	   But skirmishes between security forces and protesters on the
barricade which stands between the marchers and their goal resumed
early Tuesday. The level of violence was mild, however, compared
with previous nights, police said.
	   Officers were beaten back by fireworks and gasoline bombs as
they attempted to get at three masked protesters pulling metal
sheeting from the barricade and police responded with plastic
bullets.
	   Three Orange halls came under attack by firebombs.
	   After a speech by Protestant leader Ian Paisley, thousands of
protesters left in droves, with less than 200 remaining on site
overnight, by far the smallest gathering since the standoff began.
By morning the number had diminished to a ``handful,'' police said.
	   The Portadown chapter of the Royal Black Preceptory, the senior
branch of the Orange Order, canceled its march Tuesday to the
annual gathering in Scarva in County Armagh, because of the killing
of the children.
	   The Black Preceptory sponsors the day's big event, the
reenactment of the Battle of the Boyne at Scarva, which
traditionally marks the end of the July 12 celebrations. Other
Royal Black groups were marching, however, and 60,000 people were
expected at Scarva.
	   Members of the Orange Order in Portadown are insisting on their
right to march through a Catholic neighborhood even though a
government-appointed parades commission twice denied their
application.
	   Hundreds of police and British soldiers have maintained the
blockade since July 5, and Prime Minister Tony Blair has insisted
the law will be enforced.
	   On Sunday, after the Quinn boys' deaths, the Portadown Orange
lodges rejected calls from political and religious leaders to call
off their protest, though they did move to scale down the size of
the crowds, which grew to more than 20,000 last week.
	   Elsewhere, army specialists defused a car bomb Monday containing
500 pounds (240 kgs) of explosives, which had been left behind the
court house in Newry, near the border with the Irish republic. No
one claimed responsibility, but police said it appeared to be the
work of Irish Republican Army dissidents.

Russian bailout package now await's parliament's verdict
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: NEW throughout with Yeltsin meeting parliamentary leaders.
CHANGES byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By GREG MYRE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ With international lenders agreeing to prop up
Russia's shaky economy, President Boris Yeltsin focused Tuesday on
his next key task: convincing parliament to pass an austerity plan.
	   Yeltsin, who's often in conflict with the Communists and other
hard-liners in parliament, sought to charm his opponents Tuesday.
He invited parliamentary leaders to the Kremlin and urged swift
passage of a economic rescue package that seeks to revamp the tax
system and cut the state's budget deficit.
	   ``We shall not be able to implement (the program) if you do not
confirm it,'' Yeltsin told the lawmakers. ``Of course, I can decide
some matters myself, but in the main, the destiny of the program
depends on you.''
	   The International Monetary Fund and other lenders reached
tentative agreement Monday on dlrs 22.6 billion loan package
designed to prop up the country's crumbling financial markets and
prevent a collapse of the currency.
	   The deal gave an immediate boost to Russia's hard-hit stock
market, which has lost more than half its value since the beginning
of the year.
	   Stocks surged 9 percent Monday and leapt another 14 percent in
early trading Tuesday. It was the market's best showing since the
crisis began biting in May.
	   The IMF board meets in Washington on Monday to review the loan
agreement, and it could send dlrs 5 billion or more to Russia as
next week. However, the IMF wants Russia to address chronic
problems such as its budget deficit and its inability to collect
taxes.
	   Yeltsin's administration has sent more than 20 proposals to
parliament, but Communist lawmakers and other government opponents
have resisted spending cuts and tax increases. They say the
government should be spending more money, not less, to help
struggling Russian citizens and companies.
	   Parliament's lower house, the State Duma, turned down several
proposals earlier this month, and Communist leaders have not given
any indication that their position has changed.
	   The Duma holds a special session Wednesday to debate the
economic package, and it was not clear which way they would vote.
	   If parliament refuses Yeltsin's economic plan, then the IMF and
other lenders might withhold the loans, which Russia needs
urgently.
	   The IMF board ``will make a judgment about the (loan) in the
light of whatever decision the Duma makes,'' the IMF's chief
negotiator, John Odling-Smee, said Monday.
	   The proposed loans are to come from three sources: the IMF, the
World Bank and the Japanese government. When combined with
already-negotiated loans, the package totals dlrs 22.6 billion
spread over this year and next.
	   Millions of Russians have been pushed into poverty by the
country's shrinking economy during the 1990s, and the infusion of
cash is designed to ward off another big downturn.
	   The government hopes the loans will prevent a devaluation of the
ruble, restore foreign investors' confidence, and allow the state
to begin paying off its many debts, including billions of dollars
owed to unpaid workers.

Most Asian stock markets rebound
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets rebounded Tuesday as
fears faded of political turmoil in Japan following the resignation
of Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto.
	   In Tokyo, the 225-issue benchmark Nikkei Stock Average gained
128.52 points, or 0.79 percent, closing at 16,488.91. On Monday,
the index had climbed 270.33 points, or 1.68 percent.
	   Traders said the Nikkei index headed into positive territory in
the afternoon following a Japanese news report that the
government's tax panel chief would propose 6 trillion yen (dlrs
42.5 billion) in permanent tax cuts.
	   Japan's major opposition political parties had urged such
large-scale tax cuts in the campaign for Sunday's election for half
the seats in Parliament's upper house. Hashimoto's governing party
suffered a humiliating defeat in the voting.
	   In currency trading, the dollar was quoted at 141.36 yen, down
1.06 yen from late Monday in Tokyo and also below its late New York
rate of 141.42 overnight.
	   South Korean shares closed sharply higher on hopes the yen will
stabilize following Hashimoto's resignation.
	   A nationwide strike Tuesday by workers protesting spreading
layoffs had little impact on the market. While concerned about its
negative impact on the economy as a whole, government officials
said the strike was not expected to seriously hurt the affected
industries.
	   The Seoul Stock Exchange's key Composite Stock Price Index rose
5.38 points, or 1.8 percent, to 306.73.
	   Singapore share prices closed mixed, but the key index ended at
a 9 1/2-year low because of heavy selling in index stocks. The
Straits Times Industrial Index fell 10.75 points, or 1.0 percent,
to 1,042.44.
	   Dealers said shares fell in the afternoon because of concerns
over Malaysia's corporate sector and uncertainty over Japan's
leadership.
	   Elsewhere:
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed higher on the back
of a recovery in the New Zealand dollar and a corresponding fall in
short-term interest rates. The NZSE-40 Capital Index rose 38.13
points, or 1.8 percent, to 2,078.27.
	   TAIPEI: Share prices closed lower as lingering concerns over the
slowdown in the local economy prompted wary investors to move to
the sidelines following gains earlier in the session. The market's
key Weighted Stock Price Index fell 26.31 points, or 0.33 percent,
to 7,789.22.
	   HONG KONG: Share prices closed higher after three straight
sessions of declines. The Hang Seng Index rose 79.73 points, or 1.0
percent, closing at 8,178.93.
	   MANILA: Philippine stocks closed higher as investors hunted for
bargains. The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index rose 9.02
points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,784.87.
	   SYDNEY: Australian shares closed higher in line with stronger
regional markets. The All Ordinaries Index rose 35.6 points, or 1.3
percent, to 2,754.2.
	   BANGKOK: Thai share prices closed lower in light trading. The
Stock Exchange of Thailand index fell 1.04 points, or 0.4 percent,
to 265.71.
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian share prices closed lower, with the
government's latest measures to shore up confidence in the
country's banking system failing to stoke up enthusiasm. The
benchmark Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange Composite Index slipped 0.98
point to 420.33.
	   JAKARTA: Share prices closed higher on continued speculative
buying in some state-owned stocks. The Composite Index rose 4.201
points, or 0.9 percent, to 463.874.

Bodies recovered from cargo plane crash off of Emirates coast

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Ukrainian officials saying plane belonged to
military, crashed after engine fire. &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAS AL-KHAIMAH, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ A Ukrainian cargo
plane with eight crew members on board burst into flames minutes
after taking off and crashed into the sea, aviation officials and
witnesses said Tuesday. All aboard were believed killed.
	   Divers recovered body parts Tuesday belonging to six of the crew
members, a coast guard official said on condition of anonymity.
	   The four-engine Ilyushin-76 was owned by Ukraine's Defense
Ministry and was on lease to a private Kiev-based cargo airline,
A.T.I. Aircompany, the Ukrainian Emergency Situations Ministry
said.
	   Officials said the plane, with a crew of seven military men and
a civilian, was carrying 40 tons of unspecified cargo from the Gulf
emirate of Ras Al-Khaimah to Mykolayiv in southern Ukraine.
Russia's Interfax news agency said the cargo was not dangerous.
	   A.T.I. officials in Kiev confirmed the crash but would not
comment further. Stu Carrie, manager of Ras Al-Khaimah airport,
said the plane was about 15 years old.
	   Officials at the Emergency Situations Ministry, who spoke on
customary condition of anonymity, said the pilot had attempted a
sea landing after the engine caught fire.
	   Mohammed Al-Ghaith, an Emirates' civil aviation official heading
the crash investigation, said there were no technical faults when
the flight took off at 11 p.m. (1900 GMT) Monday.
	   ``We can't guess. There is no room for guessing,'' he said when
asked about the cause of the crash. He said scuba divers were still
looking for the plane's black box, which records in-flight data.
	   Initial reports by the official Emirates News Agency said the
aircraft belonged to Azerbaijani Airlines.
	   Mohammad Hussein, a 46-year-old businessman, said he saw the
plane catch fire minutes after take-off and then explode before
crashing into the sea 500 meters (550 yards) from shore. Hundreds
of watermelons were floating in the sea after the crash, he said.
	   An airport official said diving teams initially had difficulty
getting close to the plane due to the heat of the burning wreckage.
	   In the states of the former Soviet Union, it is not uncommon for
private companies to charter military planes for cargo flights, and
the Emirates has a flourishing trade with the region.
	   The Ras al-Khaimah airport receives about 40 flights every week
from cities in the former Soviet Union, where air safety has
declined dramatically as many cash-strapped airlines have failed to
provide adequate maintenance of aging aircraft.
	   In December, 85 people were killed when a Tajik airliner crashed
in the emirate of Sharjah.

Cyprus may delay missile purchase if island is demilitarized
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The president of Cyprus said Tuesday he still
plans to purchase anti-aircraft missiles from Russia, but that the
sale could be canceled if the island is demilitarized, a news
report said.
	   President Glafkos Clerides, whose government controls the ethnic
Greek side of the divided island nation, told reporters that either
way he would pay for the S-300 anti-aircraft missiles, the
ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   But he said he will not have the weapons delivered if a deal
could be made with Turkey, which controls the ethnic Turkish side
of the Island.
	   Turkey is angered by the deal and has threatened military action
to prevent the deployment of the weapons.
	   Clerides did not say when the missiles would be delivered and
that a time frame for delivery did not come up during talks Monday
with Russian President Boris Yeltsin.
	   Citing unidentified government sources, ITAR-Tass said delivery
could occur between August and November.
	   Cyprus has been divided into Greek and Turkish communities since
1974, when Turkish troops invaded following an abortive coup by
ethnic Greeks who supported union with Greece.
	   Clerides' government is recognized internationally, while the
breakaway Turkish Cypriot state is recognized only by Turkey.

Seven elite troops arrested in kidnapping case in Indonesia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS graf 3 to correct spelling of Kopassus &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Military police on Tuesday arrested
seven elite Indonesian soldiers accused of kidnapping pro-democracy
activists prior to Suharto's resignation as president two months
ago, news reports said.
	   Human rights groups say as many as 24 activists were abducted
and that at least nine remain missing.
	   Military Police Commander Maj. Gen. Syamsu Djalal said the
arrested soldiers were officers and enlisted men within the ranks
of Kopassus, Indonesia's special forces group, the official Antara
news agency reported.
	   He refused to name them, but said they were detained after a
thorough investigation, including the questioning of 43 witnesses,
among them 20 military personnel.
	   Djalal said the investigation was continuing and more arrests
might follow.
	   Suharto, who maintained power for 32 years with the support of
the powerful military, quit in May after bloody rioting followed
weeks of protests by students demanding democratic reform.
	   The newspaper Suara Pembaruan reported that the arrested
soldiers were being held at Jakarta's military headquarters.
	   Earlier, military spokesman Brig. Gen. Syamsul Ma'arif said the
men had been ordered to investigate the activities of several
anti-government protesters. However, they went beyond this order
and allegedly took the activists captive, he said.
	   Some activists, who are now free, have testified to Indonesia's
National Human Rights Commission that they were abducted by masked
men, tortured and questioned about their political activities.
	   Meanwhile, Jakarta's newly appointed military commander has
ordered his troops to watch for early signs of unrest as the worst
economic crisis in 30 years continues to bite, the Jakarta Post
reported.
	   At the time of the May rioting, Jakarta's security forces, under
a different commander, were criticized for not taking swift action
to quell the violence, in which about 1,200 people were killed.
	   Angry mobs targeted members of the ethnic Chinese community.
Hundreds of Chinese-owned stores and homes were burned and women's
groups say scores of Chinese women and girls were raped.
	   Some indigenous Indonesians have made Chinese people the
scapegoats for rising unemployment and soaring inflation.
	   In Beijing Tuesday, China expressed ``concern and sympathy'' for
ethnic Chinese who were attacked and called on Indonesia's
government to prevent further violence.
	   Some fear that violence might return to the streets if the
economic situation worsens.
	   Speaking after he was sworn in Monday, Maj. Gen. Djadja
Suparman, 49, said his troops would work ``hand-in-hand'' with all
residents of Jakarta, regardless of their social and cultural
backgrounds.
	   ``The riots, destruction, looting and arson in Jakarta and other
regions in mid-May are still fresh in our minds,'' he said. ``We
all realize now that the tragedy could degrade Indonesia's positive
image in the international community and damage our political and
economic growth.''

U.S. appeals WTO ruling against shrimp import ban
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The United States has appealed a World Trade
Organization ruling that U.S. import restrictions on shrimp were
inconsistent with its obligations, a statement issued Tuesday by
the U.S. Trade Representative said.
	   In April, a WTO panel decided that a U.S. embargo on shrimp
imports from India, Malaysia, Pakistan, and Thailand is an illegal
attempt to impose U.S. standards on other countries.
	   The United States has blocked shrimp imports from the four
countries under a law restricting the import of shrimp caught with
trawling nets and equipment that harm endangered species of sea
turtles. The four have declined to adopt measures to ensure
trawling nets won't ensnare and kill the turtles.
	   Environmentalists say failure to equip shrimp nets with
turtle-excluder devices costing dlrs 75 each causes the death of
150,000 turtles a year worldwide.
	   The U.S. appeal will be heard by a panel of the Geneva-based
WTO's standing Appellate Body. The body should issue its findings
within 90 days, the U.S. statement said.

	   A summary of late financial and business news from The
Associated Press. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets rebounded Tuesday as
fears faded of political turmoil in Japan following the resignation
of Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto. In Tokyo, the 225-issue
benchmark Nikkei Stock Average gained 128.52 points, or 0.79
percent, closing at 16,488.91. On Monday, the index had climbed
270.33 points, or 1.68 percent. Traders said the Nikkei index
headed into positive territory in the afternoon following a
Japanese news report that the government's tax panel chief would
propose 6 trillion yen (dlrs 42.5 billion) in permanent tax cuts.
Japan's major opposition political parties had urged such
large-scale tax cuts in the campaign for Sunday's election for half
the seats in Parliament's upper house. Hashimoto's governing party
suffered a humiliating defeat in the voting. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ With international lenders agreeing to prop up
Russia's shaky economy, President Boris Yeltsin focused Tuesday on
his next key task: convincing parliament to pass an austerity plan.
Yeltsin, who's often in conflict with the Communists and other
hard-liners in parliament, sought to charm his opponents Tuesday.
He invited parliamentary leaders to the Kremlin and urged swift
passage of a economic rescue package that seeks to revamp the tax
system and cut the state's budget deficit. ``We shall not be able
to implement (the program) if you do not confirm it,'' Yeltsin told
the lawmakers. ``Of course, I can decide some matters myself, but
in the main, the destiny of the program depends on you.'' The
International Monetary Fund and other lenders reached tentative
agreement Monday on dlrs 22.6 billion loan package designed to prop
up the country's crumbling financial markets and prevent a collapse
of the currency. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   LONDON (AP) _ British inflation fell sharply last month from a
6-year high of 4.2 percent to 3.7 percent, according to official
figures released Tuesday. The drop of half a percentage point in
June eased pressure on the Labor government, which has repeatedly
missed its target for consumer price increases, and brought some
relief to exporters who are still getting hit with high interest
rates, a strong pound and fallout from the economic crisis in
Southeast Asia. Inflation had risen from 4 percent in April to 4.2
percent in May, the highest figure since May 1992 when it stood at
4.3 percent. At the time, the Treasury called the rising inflation
temporary and predicted it would retreat in July. The underlying
rate of inflation, which excludes mortgage interest payments, fell
from 3.2 percent in May to 2.8 percent in June, still above the
government's elusive target of 2.5 percent. (BRITAIN-INFLATION)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said
Tuesday that Japan should move quickly to clean up bad loans in its
financial system, a Japanese Finance Ministry official said.
Greenspan made his remarks in a meeting with Finance Minister
Hikaru Matsunaga in Tokyo, said a senior ministry official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity. ``Resolution of the bad debt
problem is very important,'' the official quoted Greenspan as
telling Matsunaga. Japanese banks are saddled with more than 77
trillion yen (dlrs 546 billion) in bad loans, making them reluctant
to extend fresh loans and hampering the nation's economic recovery.
``Finally, getting the underlying land collateral off the books is
(also) important,'' Greenspan was quoted as telling the finance
minister. Matsunaga explained to the Fed chairman Japan's plans to
shore up its ailing financial system. (JAPAN-GREENSPAN)
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Tens of thousands of auto,
shipbuilding and other metal workers walked off their jobs Tuesday,
joining in a nationwide strike called to protest spreading layoffs.
While concerned about its negative impact on the economy as a
whole, government officials said the strike was not expected to
seriously hurt the affected industries. Lee Soo-young, a Labor
Ministry spokesman, noted that most of the industries hit by the
strike already have large inventories of unsold goods and can
easily absorb the walkout. ``What we are worried about is its
psychological impact on foreign investors,'' Lee said. Government
officials have consistently said that wooing back foreign investors
who fled in the face of last year's currency crisis is the only way
to revive South Korea's battered economy. (SKOREA-LABOR)

Allegations of illicit relationship in high-profile treason case
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The lead defense attorney in a high-profile
treason case on Tuesday asked the Supreme Court to declare a
mistrial, claiming a female member of his team was involved in a
secret personal relationship with the trial judge.
	   The petition, citing hearsay, also alleged that Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu overstepped his authority and discussed the case
with Judge Amnon Straschnov while the trial was still in process.
	   Netanyahu's office and a spokesman for the courts denied the
allegations by defense attorney Amnon Zichroni.
	   The high court turned down Zichroni's petition Tuesday, saying
it did not have the authority to declare a mistrial in the case of
Nahum Manbar, a former paratrooper convicted last month of selling
dlrs 16 million worth of chemical weapons materials to Iran.
	   The Supreme Court said, however, that Zichroni could ask
Straschnov to disqualify himself. Straschnov, who has not responded
directly to the allegations, was to hand down Manbar's sentence
Wednesday. Manbar faces life in prison.
	   Earlier Tuesday, the Supreme Court lifted a news blackout on the
affair which dominated radio and TV news shows throughout the day.
	   In his petition, Zichroni said that a member of his team,
attorney Pninat Yanai, 26, maintained a ``close, personal,
intensive relationship'' with Straschnov during the trial and
passed on confidential information about the case to the judge.
	   Zichroni also said Yanai was ``a close friend'' of Netanyahu
spokesman Shai Bazak. Zichroni said he learned from Yanai's former
boyfriend, Ziv Chen, that Bazak had told Yanai the prime minister
had discussed the case with the judge.
	   Last month, after Manbar's conviction on treason charges,
Netanyahu said he hoped the defendant would receive a long
sentence. ``I hope he will pay a heavy price for the terrible thing
he has done,'' Netanyahu said then.
	   Zichroni accused Netanyahu at the time of taking advantage of
his position by meddling in legal proceedings.
	   Yanai was an apprentice lawyer in Straschnov's office before
being hired by Zichroni. Yanai charged Tuesday that Zichroni put
her on the Manbar defense team because he wanted to make use of her
previous professional connection with the judge.
	   ``The allegations in the petition that I had erotic relations
with the judge are a lie and aimed at humiliating me and
discrediting the judge,'' Yanai said. She said Chen, her former
boyfriend, was engaged in a vendetta against her.
	   Manbar, an Israeli businessman living in Switzerland, was
arrested in March 1997 on one of his visits to Israel. Israeli
newspapers reported at the time that U.S. officials had asked
Netanyahu to stop Manbar's sales to Iran. The reports also said the
CIA provided Israel with information on Manbar's ties to Iran.
	   Manbar was barred from the United States in 1994, after the U.S.
State Department said he and two of his companies violated a U.S.
trade embargo against Iran.

King Hussein off to Mayo Clinic for medical checkup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ King Hussein of Jordan left Tuesday for
medical tests at the Mayo Clinic in the United States after
suffering from a high fever that has caused him fatigue.
	   Jordanian doctors believe that the illness is a recurrence of a
bout of bacteria that attacked his lymphatic glands in October, an
official said, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Last year, Hussein suffered fever, fatigue and weight loss, but
doctors and the king himself said he had recovered in the spring as
a result of antibiotics subscribed after tests during another visit
to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.
	   ``The symptoms are similar this time,'' the official said. ``His
majesty has been feeling tired and lazy because of a continuous
fever over the last few weeks.''
	   He said after telephone consultations with the Mayo Clinic,
Hussein decided to go there for a complete medical examination ``to
closely analyze the case.''
	   The king underwent surgery to remove cancer from his ureter and
left kidney in the same hospital in 1992.
	   Hussein has looked healthy and recently participated in several
state functions and ribbon-cutting events, such as high school
graduations, lectures and field inspections of various projects.
	   Even when he left Amman on Tuesday, he walked comfortably on the
airport's tarmac and shook hands with family members and officials.
He smiled as he took control of his private jet with his
American-born wife, Queen Noor, sitting next to him in the cockpit.
Hussein is a certified pilot.

U.N. refugee agency reports worsening situation in Angola
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The U.N. refugee agency said Tuesday that
thousands of refugees have fled into Congo to escape fighting in
neighboring Angola.
	   Some 22,000 refugees are now camped out in the Kisangi area in
the southeastern region of Congo, said Kris Janowski, spokesman for
the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.
	   Last week, about 7,000 refugees crossed into Congo to escape
continuing clashes between Angolan government forces and suspected
rebels of UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the National Union for
the Total Independence of Angola.
	   Janowski said UNHCR is buying food supplies in Congo to
transport to the refugees within a few days.
	   Attacks by suspected members of UNITA on police and civilians
threaten to derail Angola's 1994 peace pact.
	   The government says remnants of UNITA's 70,000-strong guerrilla
army are responsible for the attacks. UNITA has angrily rejected
the accusations, blaming roaming gangs of bandits for the
incidents.

Chinese premier, chatting with Arafat, criticizes Israel

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji told Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat on Tuesday that Israel was wrong for delaying
troop withdrawals from the West Bank.
	   Zhu reaffirmed China's longstanding support for the
Palestinians' ``just cause,'' and said Chinese businesses would
support a Palestinian state with investments.
	   ``Israel's delay in withdrawing from the West Bank is wrong,''
Zhu told Arafat at the start of their meeting.
	   Zhu added that he had told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu during a visit to China in May that security could come
not through ``a Great Wall, or nuclear weapons, but only through
peaceful coexistence.''
	   Netanyahu's government has stalled on withdrawing troops. It has
refused a U.S. compromise that would link a pull-back from 13
percent of the West Bank with corresponding security gestures from
the Palestinians.
	   Despite China's support, Zhu said Beijing would never be a
moderator in the Middle East peace talks.
	   Arafat's visit to Beijing, which began Monday, has focused on
using Chinese influence to revive the peace process and securing
support for the Palestinians.
	   Chinese President Jiang Zemin told Arafat Monday night that
China would support an independent Palestinian state and pledged to
use China's U.N. Security Council seat to push forward the peace
process, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   China has long been a strong supporter of the Palestinian cause
but over the past decade has developed good diplomatic and strong
economic ties with Israel.

Chernobyl's only operational reactor suffers malfunction
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Operators at Ukraine's Chernobyl nuclear
power plant registered a minor malfunction in its only working
reactor and successfully repaired it, officials said Tuesday.
	   There were no radiation leaks, officials said.
	   The malfunction occurred before dawn Monday in one of the
systems that regulates power in reactor No. 3, and led to a slight
overheating in a pipe carrying steam to the reactor's turbine, said
plant spokesman Serhiy Pavlutsky.
	   The regulator, one of six, was fixed within 40 minutes while the
reactor's power capacity was reduced by 5 percent to allow for
repairs, he said.
	   Plant officials put the malfunction at Level 1, the lowest on
the International Nuclear Event Scale used to assess accidents at
nuclear power plants.
	   The incident came after a week of repairs on the reactor in
June, when it was shut down because of an unspecified malfunction
in one of its turbine generators. That accident occurred just a
month after the reactor was restarted following more than 10 months
of repairs.
	   Chernobyl's reactor No. 4 was destroyed in a 1986 explosion and
fire, the world's worst nuclear accident. Another reactor was shut
down after being badly damaged by a 1991 fire, and a third is not
operational.
	   Ukraine has pledged to close the ill-fated plant by 2000, but
wants dlrs 1.2 billion in international aid to build two new
reactors to compensate for lost energy and to find new jobs for
Chernobyl's workers.

Funeral for Northern Ireland's three brothers, victims of hatred
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new quotes from Forde and cards on floral
tributes; Fixes typo in graf 2; Writes through previously embargoed
material &QL; 
 &UR; By KRISTIN GAZLAY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BALLYMONEY, Northern Ireland (AP) _ As a mournful church bell
tolled Tuesday morning, the small coffins of three young brothers
were carried by pallbearers into a rural church near the home where
they died in a sectarian firebomb attack, victims of a war of
hatred in Northern Ireland.
	   A crowd outside the Roman Catholic Church of Our Lady and St.
Patrick stood in silence, some wiping tears as Richard, Mark and
Jason Quinn, who were raised as Protestants, began their final
journey, followed by their grief-stricken parents and surviving
brother.
	   Pictures of the boys in happier times lay on top of the white
coffins with brass nameplates and crosses.
	   Half a dozen floral tributes rested against the church's stone
wall. One card read: ``Sleep in peace little angels.''
	   As the coffins were carried to hearses from their grandmother's
bungalow in Rasharkin, about 7 miles 12 kms) away, relatives,
friends and neighbors sobbed. The boys' father, John Dillon, wept
and stroked the coffin he carried. Their mother, Chrissie Quinn,
29, her eyes red from crying, led a procession of dozens of
relatives and friends as well as fire officers who tried to save
the children.
	   Tensions spilling over from a blocked Protestant march outside a
rural church near Portadown were blamed for the early Sunday
morning firebombing of the Quinn house. Police said they believed
the family was targeted because Chrissie Quinn lived there with her
Protestant boyfriend.
	   Two men were being questioned, police said.
	   Inside the packed church, the Rev. Peter Forde told the
congregation that many people were undoubtedly asking whether it
was God's will that three young boys would be killed by a firebomb.
	   ``But of course it is not God who commits murder, or any evil
act. ... God would not have chosen it this way. I'm sure he had
good and interesting plans for Richard and for Mark and for Jason.
But someone, certainly not through God's will, stopped those
plans,'' the priest said.
	   Forde asked the family to trust that God was now looking after
Richard, Mark and Jason _ ``and that one day all of us will hope to
meet them again.''
	   ``We meet in sorrow at the deaths of these children, but our
shared sorrow is a beacon of hope for the whole community. In this
our troubled country, may it light our way ahead,'' he said.
	   Forde said Monday that nothing could prepare him for the
``unnatural'' sight of a trio of little coffins in the special
funeral Mass, but he hoped his carefully chosen words would make a
difference to the Quinn family, and to the watching world.
	   ``It is not the place to be political,'' he said. ``But three
children who had just begun life were lent to us, and we as a
society failed in our responsibility.''
	   Irene Quinn, the boys' grandmother, said her daughter wanted
them buried in Rasharkin, where the family has its roots, so she
never again would have to set foot in Ballymoney. Chrissie Quinn's
oldest son, 13-year-old Lee, spent Saturday night with his
grandmother and so escaped the attack.
	   Ms. Quinn is Catholic, but was raising the boys as Protestants
because she thought it would make life easier for them in
Ballymoney, a hard-line Protestant stronghold about 40 miles (60
kms) northwest of Belfast.
	   The Most Rev. Patrick Walsh, Bishop of Down and Connor, said in
prepared remarks to the congregation that in the wake of the
horrific murders ``voices have been raised _ voices of sanity,
voices of reason. Agonizing words, words of self-examination,
courageous words, words of strength, words of healing have been
spoken.''
	   ``The time for words is over. It is now time for silence, a
silence in which we will hear the voice of God,'' he said. ``...
There is silence on this sad day here in Ballymoney and in
Rasharkin _ may that silence fall over every town and village in
our land, not a brooding silence but the silence in which we can
all listen to what God is saying to us. Or will silent voice try to
drown out once more the quiet voice of God?''

East Timor leader might get small cut to sentence: report
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Indonesia-East Timor &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ East Timorese rebel leader Xanana
Gusmao might be granted a slight reduction in his 20-year prison
sentence next month as part of celebrations to mark Indonesian
independence, a news report said Tuesday.
	   Indonesia is to celebrate 53 years of independence from Dutch
colonial rule on Aug. 17.
	   It is customary to reduce the sentences of some prisoners as a
reward for good behavior.
	   Gusmao, regarded as a model prisoner, has received some minor
reductions this way on past independence days.
	   The official Antara news agency Tuesday quoted Minister of
Justice Muladi as saying Gusmao would probably receive another
small cut to his prison term.
	   Muladi said the government planned to release 90 more political
prisoners sometime this week, but Gusmao would remain behind bars
until a settlement had been reached on the future of East Timor.
	   President B.J. Habibie has promised to free most of Indonesia's
200 political prisoners, jailed under his autocratic predecessor,
former President Suharto. So far, 28 dissidents have been released
on the orders of Habibie, who also plans to enact sweeping
democratic reforms and hold elections next year.
	   Habibie has said Gusmao can be freed as well, but only in return
for international recognition of Indonesian sovereignty over East
Timor.
	   Indonesia invaded East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, in
1975 and annexed it a year later.
	   The United Nations, Portugal and many other governments refuse
to recognize Indonesia's claim over the territory, which has
endured decades of guerrilla war and human rights abuse.
	   This week, Jamsheed Marker, a special U.N. envoy on the East
Timor problem, is scheduled to visit Indonesia for talks. However,
it is unclear whether he will go ahead with a plan to visit East
Timor because of security concerns.
	   In recent weeks, two people were shot to death and others were
wounded after troops opened fire to quell pro- and anti-Indonesian
demonstrations staged there during visits by European diplomats.

Activists accuse Myanmar military of covering up drug dispute
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ An armed confrontation between two
Myanmar ethnic groups over a heroin shipment was mediated and
covered up by the military government, a dissidents group said
Tuesday.
	   The All Burma Students Democratic Front, an organization of
exiled students, said that on June 6, the Myanmar National
Democratic Alliance seized a shipment of heroin near the Chinese
border after a gunbattle with members of the United Wa State Army.
	   The heroin was being smuggled into China. Both ethnic groups
have cease-fire agreements with Myanmar's military government and
are allied with it.
	   Myanmar, also known as Burma, is the world's second largest
producer of heroin after Afghanistan. Its military government says
it is fighting drugs.
	   The MNDA is composed of ethnic Kokang Chinese and has been named
in U.S. State Department reports as a drug trafficking army. Its
leaders have denied the charge.
	   The Wa have taken over much of the opium and heroin smuggling
business once controlled by opium warlord Khun Sa, who has
surrendered to the Myanmar government but not been imprisoned.
	   The ABSDF said Myanmar's military intelligence was mediating the
dispute between the two groups, and the state-run press has not
reported the incident, signaling a cover-up by the military.
	   The ABSDF said the Kokang Chinese handed over the heroin to
military intelligence on June 28.
	   Representatives of both the MNDA and the UWSA are helping to
draft Myanmar's new constitution under the direction of the
military. The government has called MNDA and UWSA officers
respected ethnic leaders.

Nigerian dissident group threatens to boycott transition
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By FRANK AIGBOGUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ A prominent Nigerian dissident group has
threatened to boycott the country's transition to democracy, which
is expected to be unveiled later this week, and has demanded power
be handed to civilians on Oct. 1.
	   The demand by the Joint Action Committee on Nigeria comes amid
reports that Nigeria's new military leader, Gen. Abdulsalam
Abubakar, will extend the country's transition program to civilian
rule, which had been originally scheduled to end with an Oct. 1
handover.
	   Abubakar is expected to announce the transition plans in a
televised address later this week, perhaps as early as Wednesday.
The Lagos-based This Day newspaper has reported that the civilian
handover will be made on March 31, 1999, after elections are held.
That report could not immediately be confirmed.
	   But the Joint Action Committee said that only the establishment
of a government of national unity led by a committee of six drawn
from across Nigeria could midwife the transition program and heal
the wounds created by the annulled 1993 presidential elections and
the death last week of Moshood Abiola, the apparent winner of those
elections.
	   ``We want a sense of national well-being,'' said the group's
leader, Lagos lawyer Gani Fawehinmi, after a Monday meeting. The
group is comprised of 52 dissident groups.
	   The group believes that a national conference must be set up
before fresh elections are held to discuss ways to ensure that
Nigeria's southerners _ who have been long excluded from power _
are given a role in the country's future.
	   Abiola, a southerner from the Yoruba ethnic group, died Tuesday.
While his family and many other southerners believe he was killed,
initial autopsy reports say the 60-year-old died of long-standing
heart disease.
	   But the Lagos-based daily The Guardian reported Tuesday that the
government's chief radiologist, Col. O. Awofeso, had written a
report in September 1994 saying Abiola's heart was dangerously
enlarged. The Guardian said Abacha initially approved a
recommendation that Abiola be sent abroad for treatment, but then
rescinded his order.
	   Abiola had been imprisoned since declaring himself president in
1994. The government says he was on the brink of release when he
died.
	   Nigeria's transition to democracy was created by Gen. Sani
Abacha, the former dictator who died last month. While Abacha had
blatantly manipulated the transition in ways that made it clear he
intended to transform himself into a nominally civilian leader,
Abubakar has said he intends the country to truly move toward
democracy.
	   Abubakar has freed dozens of political prisoners, vowed to free
the rest and met with dissidents and foreign envoys since taking
office, a break from the brutal and isolated rule of his
predecessor
	   However, many Nigerian opposition groups remain deeply suspicion
of him and all other military leaders, worried that their chance at
democracy will be snatched away.

Opposition criticizes Museveni's Movement as one-party politics
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HENRY WASSWA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Members of Uganda's political opposition
on Tuesday criticized the role of President Yoweri Museveni's
ruling Movement as a smoke screen to disguise a one-party state.
	   Museveni was re-elected chairman Monday of what had formerly
been called the National Resistance Movement at the organization's
week-long congress.
	   ``All these are tricks to muzzle political parties and make the
Movement the only group where people are able to express their
views,'' said opposition legislator Ken Lukyamuzi. ``But the
struggle is still on to bring multi-party democracy in the
country.''
	   Parties other than the Movement _ to which all Ugandans must
belong _ are permitted, but they cannot stage political rallies,
field candidiates for election or hold congresses.
	   Candidates who disagree with the Movement and Museveni, however,
can run for office on their own.
	   Museveni formed the NRM when he began a bush war against former
President Milton Obote in 1981. He took power in 1986 and was voted
president 10 years later in elections described as free and fair by
international observers.
	   ``I have a lot of pleasure that we have a political organization
that brings together all Ugandans from grass roots to the top,''
Museveni told the more than 1,000 delegates who overwhelmingly
backed him as head of the Movement with 970 votes.
	   ``The NRM has given marginalized groups a say in the country,''
he said.
	   Museveni and his closest colleagues claim that party politics
plunged Uganda into nearly two decades of murderous civil conflict
and destroyed the economy.
	   In his acceptance speech Monday, Museveni focused on the war
against rebels operating in the country's north and west, in an
apparent attempt, the government-owned New Vision newspaper said
Tuesday, to rally the nation behind him.
	   The president assured Movement delegates representing 42
districts that the national army was increasing pressure on Lord's
Resistance Army rebels operating in the north of the country and
the Allied Democratic Forces in the west.
	   The two rebel groups, which Museveni described as criminal and
satanic, have killed thousands of civilians and abducted an
estimated 10,000 children and teenagers for use in their ranks in
an effort to destabilize Museveni's government.
	   But critics warned that Museveni was losing popular support
because of his political policies.
	   International donors, however, praise Museveni and his free
market economic policies.
	   ``With the NRM, Museveni can rule this country against the
peoples' wish because the parties, though legal, are not allowed to
function,'' said a member of the opposition Democratic Party's
youth wing, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   ``But we believe that in the future he will lose because people
will not allow it to continue,'' he added. ``People will fight as
they are doing in the northern region.''

EU gives go-ahead to joint Maersk Air-Finnair flights
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union's executive
Commission gave the green light Tuesday to joint flights by the
Danish airline Maersk Air and Finnair between Copenhagen and
Stockholm.
	   The Commission said the Finnish airline and Maersk Air can
continue to cooperate on the route between the Danish and Swedish
capitals for six years. The partners began the joint service in
April 1997.
	   ``This joint venture was authorized because it enhances
competition on a route previously dominated by one carrier,'' the
Commission said in a statement.
	   The Commission has powers to check joint-ventures that impact on
markets within the 15-nation EU, and can veto those judged to
infringe EU laws on fair business competition.

Airport subcontractors arrested for alleged corruption
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARCOS CALO MEDINA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ In another setback for Hong Kong's new
multibillion-dollar airport, 12 people connected with construction
of its transportation network were arrested Tuesday on suspicion of
bribery and corruption.
	   Two shareholders, five engineers and five employees of
subcontractors are accused of using substandard materials for the
construction of a station on the railway to the new airport, the
Independent Commission Against Corruption said.
	   The commission did not give any details on those arrested, nor
did it disclose the extent of the damage to the Hong Kong Station
in the territory's Central business district.
	   ``The investigation revealed that they may have accepted
bribes,'' said commission spokeswoman Valentina Chan.
	   During the investigation, 14 handguns and about 1,000 rounds of
ammunition were found and turned over to police. The commission did
not know whether the guns were owned by any of those arrested.
	   The announcement followed a string of problems since the dlrs 20
billion airport opened July 6, and seemed certain to increase the
growing criticism of the airport management and government.
	   New Chek Lap Kok airport replaced Hong Kong's venerable,
downtown Kai Tak airport to great expectations. But it immediately
became ensnared in a series of problems with flight delays,
baggage-handling and airport services.
	   The focus now has shifted to deep problems in the highly
profitable cargo section. The main cargo handler had to put an
embargo on most shipments late last week to work through mechanical
and computer problems.
	   Airport officials said Tuesday that passenger services were
continuing to improve, with at least 90 percent of arrivals and
departures within a half-hour of the scheduled time and waits for
baggage ranging from 15-25 minutes.
	   Hong Kong radio said seven cargo planes used the new airport
Tuesday. Cargo flights partially resumed Sunday in an effort to
clear some of the backlog created by massive problems when the
airport opened last week.
	   Signaling their skeptical attitude toward the whole airport
project, legislators said Tuesday they would launch hearings in at
least four different directions.
	   Legislative panels said they would look into the cargo problems,
transportation to and from the new airport, reported security
lapses at the airport and complaints about the noise it generates.

Attorney General's Office continues investigation of Suharto
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Officials of the Attorney General's
Office said Tuesday they recently met with former President Suharto
as part of an investigation into corruption.
	   Suwardjono, a junior attorney general dealing with the case,
said he talked with Suharto several weeks ago.
	   ``His response was very good. He promised to give whatever is
needed'' for the investigation, Suwardjono told a news conference.
	   He said he specifically asked about the former president's legal
representation. However, he refused to give further details of the
meeting at Suharto's Jakarta residence.
	   The Attorney General's Office is investigating more than a dozen
charitable foundations set up and controlled by Suharto, who
resigned in May after a wave of protests and riots.
	   Critics have alleged that the charities were used for corrupt
purposes.
	   The foundations reaped special levies on thousands of civil
servants and enjoyed other government privileges.
	   Suharto has denied any wrongdoing.
	   Attorney General Muhammad Ghalib has set a four-month timetable
for the investigation.
	   On Monday, Ghalib said his investigators have found no evidence
of money being sent overseas by Suharto.
	   Some critics have alleged that the former leader, who was in
power for 32 years, took money out of Indonesia before he quit.
Suharto has denied this.
	   ``Up till now we haven't found any (foreign accounts). We are
still looking,'' Ghalib was quoted as saying by the official Antara
news agency.
	   The Suharto family built up a big business empire over the
years, and critics say it contributed to Indonesia's economic
crisis because of its monopolistic practices. Prices and
unemployment are rising rapidly as the country grapples with its
worst economic crisis in decades.

Philippine stocks, peso gain on stable Asian currencies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with peso closing higher &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks rose Tuesday as
investors hunted for bargains with encouragement from the stable
performance of Asian currencies, traders said.
	   The peso strengthened along with other regional currencies,
buoyed by advances in the yen, dealers said.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index rose 9.02 points,
or 0.5 percent, to 1,784.87, following Monday's 26.36-point, or 1.5
percent, decline.
	   Traders said expectations of more concrete economic reforms in
Japan followed the resignation of Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto on Monday. Hashimoto stepped down to take responsibility
for his ruling Liberal Democratic Party's poor performance in
Sunday's upper house election.
	   Another factor that aided the market's ascent Tuesday was the
decline in yields in Monday's weekly treasury bill auction, said
Jose Ricardo Garcia, vice president of Diversified Securities Inc.
	   All T-bill yields fell Monday. The bellwether 91-day T-bill
fetched an average yield of 14.756 percent, 0.165 percentage point
lower than the previous level.
	   The 91-day yields are used by banks to help determine the
interest rates they charge customers. Lower interest rates would
provide businesses with cheaper access to funds and encourage
investors to shift their money from fixed-income instruments to
other types of investments such as stocks.
	   Despite the positive developments both here and abroad, however,
Garcia expects the market to remain generally weak.
	   ``I don't think investors would want to take the chance right
now to enter the market and take a long position. There are still a
lot of uncertainties,'' he said.
	   Hashimoto's resignation, while viewed positively, still left
some level of uncertainty in the region since it resulted in a
leadership vacuum in Japan, traders said.
	   The expectations of better prospects for Japan nevertheless
boosted Asian currencies including the peso, traders said. The
dollar averaged 41.862 pesos for the day, down from Monday's 42.218
pesos.
	   A trader with a foreign bank said that despite the stronger
trend of the peso and other regional currencies, sentiment is
likely to remain cautious until the policies of Japan's new prime
minister are known.
	   The peso was last traded at 41.830 pesos to the dollar,
indicating that in the absence of adverse overnight developments,
the peso may extend its gains in early transactions Wednesday.

Philippine finance secretary says 2.5 percent growth still
</HEADLINE>
achievable &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippines can still achieve 2.5
percent economic growth this year if the government cuts its budget
deficit, an official said Tuesday.
	   ``We have established that gross national product of 2.5 percent
is still attainable, but the truth is that we have to work harder
to reduce the budget deficit,'' Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu
said.
	   Because of Southeast Asia's financial crisis, Philippine
economic growth has slowed sharply from the 5.8 percent GNP growth
registered in 1997. But the country remains in better shape than
many of its neighbors, whose economies are shrinking.
	   The International Monetary Fund expects the Philippines will
post GNP growth of less than 2.5 percent this year, while the
Development Budget Coordinating Council, which is made up of
finance, economic and monetary officials, is proposing a revised
growth target of between 2.5 and 3.0 percent.
	   The proposed target has not been endorsed by newly elected
President Joseph Estrada. The previous administration's 1998 GNP
growth target was 3 to 4 percent.
	   Espiritu said the budget deficit could swell to 70 billion pesos
(dlrs 1.7 billion) this year if no steps are taken to cut
expenditures and raise tax revenues. However, if the political will
is there, the deficit can be reduced to around 20 billion pesos
(dlrs 475 million), he said.
	   In the first half of 1998, the country posted a budget deficit
of 26.7 billion pesos (dlrs 635 million) following a 4.5 billion
peso (dlrs 107 million) surplus a year earlier.
	   With consumer prices on the rise, economists say the government
will have to tighten its purse strings to prevent further inflation
pressures from building and pushing up interest rates.
	   Inflation reached double-digit levels in May for the first time
in close to two years. In June, consumer prices rose 10.7 percent
from a year earlier.

State railways strike; Olympic pilots hold talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Strikes protesting proposals to
restructure the state railroad halted most train service out of
Athens on Tuesday to add to the travel disruptions in Greece.
	   Only one train per destination was scheduled to leave Athens for
selected places. Passengers bound for other destinations were
forced to travel by bus.
	   Rail workers in northern Greece did not take part in the strike.
	   Railway employees have been staging strikes Greece since the
spring in opposition to changes in working hours and government
plans to privatize the railroad.
	   Meanwhile, flight delays due to air traffic congestion continued
at the Athens airport. Olympic Airways pilots resumed talks with
government officials to seek to resolve a work-to-rule action
because of a pay dispute.
	   The protests by the pilots have aggravated the delays at the
international and domestic airports since last week.
	   Employees of the state-run tourist organization also went on
strike to oppose planned restructuring and the transferring of its
management from the Ministry of Tourism to the Ministry of
Development. Union leaders fear a loss of job guarantees after the
reforms.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Se Ri Pak, the emerging star on the LPGA tour, and
Australia's Karrie Webb will headline the dlrs 954,500 Women's
British Open at Royal Lytham and St. Annes starting Aug. 13.
	   Pak, winner of the U.S. Open on July 5, was top of the list of
British Open starters released by the Ladies Golf Union on Tuesday.
	   The 20-year-old South Korean will be aiming to become only the
second woman to win back-to-back U.S. Open and British Open titles.
	   Webb, who won the British Open in 1995 and again last year at
Sunningdale, will be aiming to achieve a record by becoming the
first woman to win the tournament three times.
	   Nancy Lopez will spearhead the American challenge, which will
also include Kelly Robbins, Chris Johnson, Michelle McGann, Dottie
Pepper, Julie Inkster and 1996 champion Emilee Klein.
	   The last European to win the tournament was Sweden's Liselotte
Neumann, who won in 1994.
	   Neumann will return this year along with 1997 world No.1 Annika
Sorenstam. British hopes will be headed by Laura Davies, Kathryn
Marshall and Mhairi McKay.
	   Pak has the best form going into the British Open.
	   She has had 16 starts for only three top-ten finishes this year
_ but all three have been tournament wins. Recently she has been
shattering LPGA records and heads the money list with dlrs 645,170.
	   Her win on Sunday at the Jamie Farr Kroger Classic gave her
back-to-back titles after her U.S. Open win. She also won the
McDonald's LPGA Championship on May 17.

London shares rally on encouraging inflation figures
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prices rallied early Tuesday on the London Stock
Exchange, where traders said lower-than-expected inflation figures
eased concerns about a new round of higher interest rates.
	   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was up 77.5
points, or 1.3 percent, at 6,035.7 in the early afternoon.
	   ``The market has really taken off,'' said Jeremy Batstone, head
of research at NatWest Stockbrokers. ``The inflation numbers were
very positive. Maybe we are closer than we thought to the peak in
the interest rate cycle?''
	   A drop in seasonal food prices reduced Britain's underlying
inflation rate to 2.8 percent in June from 3.2 percent in May. That
is still missing the government's annual target of 2.5 percent but
investors were nonetheless encouraged
	   Provisional volume came to 344.7 million shares.

Duma decides against sending delegation to czar's funeral
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICK WADHAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Parliament decided Tuesday not to send a
delegation to this week's burial of Russia's last czar, a
controversial event that many of the country's top figures have
chosen to avoid.
	   Czar Nicholas II, his family and several servants were executed
by the Bolsheviks in 1918, and their bones were dumped in a pit
near Yekaterinburg in central Russia. They were found in 1991 and
will be buried Friday at a cathedral in St. Petersburg where most
of Russia's czars are interred.
	   Three days of ceremonies begin in Yekaterinburg on Wednesday
when the bones will be placed in small wooden caskets. The remains
will be flown to St. Petersburg on Thursday and buried the next
day.
	   The ceremony was originally intended as a healing gesture for
the country, but has sparked a number of controversies that
threaten to drive Russia's politicians, religious leaders, and
ordinary citizens further apart.
	   Communists, who are the largest bloc in parliament, have never
felt comfortable with an elaborate ceremony honoring the last czar,
and this contributed to parliament's decision not to send a
delegation.
	   Gennady Seleznyov, a Communist who is the speaker of
parliament's lower house, noted that Nicholas abdicated a year
before he was executed, and therefore was a private citizen when he
died.
	   ``We don't see the need to make a ceremony out of this. It is
not the emperor or his remains that will be buried,'' Seleznyov
said.
	   Many envisioned the burial as a way for Russia to formally
acknowledge the abuses that took place during the Communist era.
President Boris Yeltsin was the driving force behind the plans for
the burial, but even he won't be attending Friday due to the
controversy surrounding it.
	   ``It could have marked a closing of the books of Communism, an
admission of the old regime's excesses and a desire to look to the
future,'' an editorial in the Moscow Times newspaper said Tuesday.
	   ``But it now looks like it will turn into one of the most
cowardly, self-seeking and, frankly, stupid cat fights in the
history of post-Soviet Russia,'' the newspaper added.
	   The ceremonies have been steadily scaled back in recent months
as leading figures have pulled out.
	   The head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Alexy II,
said he would not attend because he had doubts about the bones'
authenticity.
	   Yeltsin has not said why he is skipping Friday's service, but he
values the support of the patriarch, and apparently does not want
to go against him on such a sensitive issue.
	   In the latest round of the squabble, opponents of the burial
threatened the Russian orthodox priests who agreed to conduct the
service. The seven priests and five deacons will still participate,
said Andrei Chizov, a spokesman for the St. Petersburg diocese.
	   Friday's burial will take place on the 80th anniversary of the
deaths of Nicholas and his family.

Sultan's birthday tainted by financial fiasco
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOCELYN GECKER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, Brunei (AP) _ National flags and smiling
pictures of His Majesty bedecked the capital Tuesday as workers
prepared for the sultan's big birthday bash.
	   Unlike in the boom years of the early 1990s, however, when
Michael Jackson was jetted in to entertain, the festivities have
been upstaged by concerns that the first economic tremors in years
could rock this oil-rich kingdom.
	   The Brunei government announced last week it was taking over the
collapsed Amedeo Development Corp., the Southeast Asian country's
primary developer, owned by the sultan's younger brother, Prince
Jefri. It said, however, it would not assume the company's
mountainous debts worldwide.
	   The extent of Amedeo's worth and its losses, which have been
estimated in the billions, is unclear. A global investigation
launched by the sultan is still under way.
	   Jefri and many senior company officials are reportedly in hiding
in Europe. Officials at Amedeo headquarters here told a reporter no
one was available for comment.
	   Despite government assurances that the economy can withstand the
shock of Amedeo's collapse, the government has slashed its
development budget from dlrs 700 million to dlrs 530 million,
contractors are not getting paid and banks have tightened lending
to government contractors.
	   ``We are in full recession,'' said the head of one bank, who
spoke on condition of anonymity. ``The dues from the government are
enormous. There are big question marks. Will the people (owed
money) ever get paid?''
	   One of the government's top contractors is owed more than dlrs
47 million from work dating back to 1993.
	   ``We understand there is no money,'' the company's managing
director said, adding that 2,000 foreign workers have been laid off
in the last year. ``We are confident the government will pay us
sooner or later. The problem is, when.''
	   Bankers and even government officials are saying the time has
come for financial transparency.
	   Under a state of emergency imposed in 1962, it is a crime
punishable by prison to reveal the country's currency reserves. The
government budget is also kept secret.
	   ``We need to move toward a public administration system that
would be more transparent and easy for the public to deal with,''
said Awang Haji Hazair, the permanent secretary to the prime
minister, one of several positions held by the sultan, who is also
defense and finance minister.
	   The much-publicized flamboyance of the Brunei royal family,
whose lavish palaces hold fleets of cars, has always been one of
the open secrets in the tiny Islamic kingdom on Borneo Island.
	   With cash from Amedeo, Prince Jefri bought a string of the
world's most prestigious hotels, now at risk of being sold: the
Plaza Athenee in Paris, the New York Palace, the Dorchester Hotel
in London and the Bel-Air in Los Angeles.
	   According to a report in Britain's Sunday Telegraph last week,
Amedeo has debts of hundreds of millions of dollars to British
suppliers who have not been paid for years.
	   The collapse, according to analysts, was triggered by the Asian
financial crisis and the plunging price of oil, which generates 80
percent of Brunei's wealth.
	   Inside Brunei, fear of financial turmoil is further heightened
by the country's penchant for secrecy and its culture of not
criticizing the royal family. Neither the government nor the local
press has fully broached the subject of Amedeo.
	   Locals have taken to surfing the Internet for news of their
country.
	   ``It's a royal matter. They say it's confidential, so we have to
pretend we don't hear it,'' said Sharen, a 28-year-old government
worker, who receives e-mailed articles on Brunei from a friend in
Britain. ``I don't know what the truth is, but deep inside I feel
scared.''
	   Some Bruneians in the capital said they would skip the sultan's
52nd birthday parade Wednesday. Instead, they will tune in to his
televised speech from the palace, hoping it sheds light on the
financial fiasco.

Ukraine opens Sevastopol for civilian foreign ships

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The Ukrainian government has opened the
once-secret Bay of Sevastopol for foreign civilian ships, according
to a Cabinet decision published Tuesday.
	   The regulation, approved last week, allows foreign commercial
ships to enter Sevastopol's Kamyshova bight, and for the creation
of two border crossing points at Sevastopol's sea trading and
fishing ports.
	   Sevastopol, the Crimean Peninsula home port of the former Soviet

Airport subcontractors arrested for alleged corruption
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CLARIFIES that handguns were found in a series of raids in
graf 5; ADDS television report that airport passenger terminal
included in investigation in graf 6 &QL; 
 &UR; By MARCOS CALO MEDINA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ In another setback for Hong Kong's new
multibillion-dollar airport, 12 people connected with construction
of its transportation network were arrested Tuesday on suspicion of
bribery and corruption.
	   Two shareholders, five engineers and five employees of
subcontractors are accused of using substandard materials for the
construction of a station on the railway to the new airport, the
Independent Commission Against Corruption said.
	   The commission did not give any details on those arrested, nor
did it disclose the extent of the damage to the Hong Kong Station
in the territory's Central business district.
	   ``The investigation revealed that they may have accepted
bribes,'' said commission spokeswoman Valentina Chan.
	   A series of raids on 33 sites that began Monday night yielded 14
handguns and about 1,000 rounds of ammunition. The commission did
not know whether the guns were owned by any of those arrested, and
turned the items over to police.
	   Television Broadcast Ltd. reported that the foundation of the
railway station was not deep enough, adding that the ICAC
investigation will include other railway stations, surrounding
residential areas and an extension of the new airport's passenger
terminal.
	   The announcement followed a string of problems since the dlrs 20
billion airport opened July 6, and seemed certain to increase the
growing criticism of the airport management and government.
	   New Chek Lap Kok airport replaced Hong Kong's venerable,
downtown Kai Tak airport to great expectations. But it immediately
became ensnared in a series of problems with flight delays,
baggage-handling and airport services.
	   The focus now has shifted to deep problems in the highly
profitable cargo section. The main cargo handler had to put an
embargo on most shipments late last week to work through mechanical
and computer problems.
	   Airport officials said Tuesday that passenger services were
continuing to improve, with at least 90 percent of arrivals and
departures within a half-hour of the scheduled time and waits for
baggage ranging from 15-25 minutes.
	   Hong Kong radio said seven cargo planes used the new airport
Tuesday. Cargo flights partially resumed Sunday in an effort to
clear some of the backlog created by massive problems when the
airport opened last week.
	   Signaling their skeptical attitude toward the whole airport
project, legislators said Tuesday they would launch hearings in at
least four different directions.
	   Legislative panels said they would look into the cargo problems,
transportation to and from the new airport, reported security
lapses at the airport and complaints about the noise it generates.

 &UR; Yeltsin says again he won't run in 2000 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin told Russian legislators
Tuesday he does not plan to seek another term when his current
tenure expires in the year 2000, news reports said.
	   ``I want Russia to start working calmly with a new president in
the year 2000,'' Yeltsin said during a meeting with a group of
deputies from the State Duma, parliament's lower house, according
to the Kremlin press service.
	   Oleg Morozov, leader of the Russian Regions faction, said
afterward that Yeltsin ``clearly and definitely'' indicated that he
would not run for office, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Yeltsin has said on multiple occasions that he doesn't plan to
run for a third term in the year 2000, but he hasn't ruled it out
entirely.
	   Yeltsin also held talks with Gennady Seleznyov, the speaker of
parliament, and told him that there were no grounds to dissolve the
Duma and hold new elections, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   But, Yeltsin warned, if he had to resign for any reason, the
country would collapse into chaos.
	   ``In case I have to quit early, you (the parliament) will be the
first to shake and the whole country will be drawn into the
situation of fighting,'' Yeltsin said, according to Seleznyov.
	   A constitutional limit of two presidential terms would appear to
rule out another bid by Yeltsin.
	   However, some aides have hinted the 67-year old leader may run
again, claiming that Yeltsin's first term began during Soviet times
and should not count toward the two-term limit. Russia's
constitutional court is expected to rule on the issue later this
year.
	   Potential candidates for the 2000 race include former Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, Communist
Party leader Gennady Zyuganov, who came in second in the 1996
election, and former national security chief Alexander Lebed.

Mahathir: Going to IMF would worsen economic crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: EMBARGOED until 1300 GMT July 14, when the interview is
broadcast &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Although Malaysia's economy is
heading into recession, seeking help from the International
Monetary Fund would only worsen the crisis, Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad said Tuesday.
	   ``What we really see is that when the other countries sought IMF
assistance, the situation became worse,'' Mahathir said in an
interview broadcast over national radio and television.
	   It was his first detailed comment since Monday's government
forecast that the economy would contract by up to 2 percent in
1998.
	   Currencies in Indonesia and South Korea fell sharply after they
signed up for IMF bailout packages, he said.
	   ``That is why we do not see any reason to seek the help of the
IMF because it cannot guarantee the strength of our ringgit,''
Mahathir added.
	   But he said Malaysia would have to borrow overseas to pay for
its development and finance its budget deficit.
	   ``We don't have any other way except to borrow,'' he said.
	   If the treasury prints more money, it would push the ringgit
lower, he said. The currency has lost nearly 40 percent of its
value against the dollar in one year.
	   Mahathir has consistently maintained that IMF prescriptions
don't work. Of late, many independent analysts and U.S.-based
economists also have said that high interest rates and tight
monetary policies suggested by the IMF for Asian nations would
impede recovery.
	   Banks were refusing to reduce interest rates and lend more money
to companies that were struggling to cope with depressed demand and
falling production, Mahathir said.
	   ``Yes, we are trying to discuss with the banks and advise them
to give out more loans,'' he said.
	   ``If we can't order the banks, our objectives would not be
fulfilled. But if we continue to direct the banks, we'll be
criticized. Not only that, sometimes our currency will be further
devalued.''
	   Mahathir exhorted Malaysians to rally behind the government.
	   ``Thank Allah, in Malaysia, the Chinese, Malays, Indians,
Kadazans, Muruts Bajaus, all support the government. This gives us
the courage, for example, to reject proposals that we accept help
from the IMF.''
	   Sixty percent of Malaysians are Malays. The Chinese are the
largest minority, followed by the Indians and other smaller groups.

President seeks U.S. support for NATO membership, more investments
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIHAI CONSTANTIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ President Emil Constantinescu left
Tuesday for a nine-day visit to the United States in hopes of
winning greater U.S. support for Romania's NATO membership and more
American investments at home.
	   Foreign investors complain that Romanian bureaucracy and rigid
laws keep them from developing business here.
	   When Constantinescu came to power in November 1996, he promised
Romanians that foreign investors would come in large numbers. That
optimism turned out to be unfounded.
	   So the president will seek to improve Romania's image among
American political and business people of a Balkan country plagued
by economic and political instability.
	   `` The declared mission of this visit is changing the image of
Romania among all U.S. officials,'' top presidential adviser Zoe
Petre stated.
	   It is the first official visit by a Romanian president to the
White House since 1978 when former dictator Nicolae Ceausescu met
Richard Nixon.
	   Constantinescu was scheduled to have a 30-minute private meeting
with President Clinton in the Oval Office, according to an official
press release.
	   He was expected to tell the American president about improving
stability in Romania, a law that gives access to files of the
former communist secret police and about government attempts to
fight bureaucracy and corruption.
	   Constantinescu will also address Congress and meet with Defense
Secretary William Cohen and other Pentagon officials.
	   The Romanian delegation is to sign two loan agreements.
	   While no major contracts were expected to be signed, some
Romanian businessmen traveled with their president in hopes of
establishing contacts in the United States.
	   Americans so far have invested a mere dlrs 380 million in
Romania, a country of 23 million people. By comparison, U.S.
investments in Hungary with a population of over ten million have
exceeded dlrs 6 billion.
	   A dlrs 1.45 billion contract between Bell Textron and the
Romanian army for the purchase of 96 Bell AH1RO Dracula helicopters
is in doubt because of a recent refusal by the Romanian finance
minister to sign government guarantees.
	   In July 1997, Bill Clinton came to Romania just after a Madrid
summit, where Romania failed to be invited to join NATO. Now,
Romanian officials are aware there's little chance such an
invitation will come next year.
	   Nevertheless, they hope to promote their cause of eventual NATO
membership in talks with U.S. defense officials.
	   Outside Washington, Constantinescu will visit Chicago and San
Francisco.

Russian bailout package now await's parliament's verdict

 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with comment from market trader in graf 7. RESTORES
dropped words `as soon as' in graf 8.
 &UR; By GREG MYRE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ With international lenders agreeing to prop up
Russia's shaky economy, President Boris Yeltsin focused Tuesday on
his next key task: convincing parliament to pass an austerity plan.
	   Yeltsin, who's often in conflict with the Communists and other
hard-liners in parliament, sought to charm his opponents Tuesday.
He invited parliamentary leaders to the Kremlin and urged swift
passage of a economic rescue package that seeks to revamp the tax
system and cut the state's budget deficit.
	   ``We shall not be able to implement (the program) if you do not
confirm it,'' Yeltsin told the lawmakers. ``Of course, I can decide
some matters myself, but in the main, the destiny of the program
depends on you.''
	   The International Monetary Fund and other lenders reached
tentative agreement Monday on dlrs 22.6 billion loan package
designed to support the country's crumbling financial markets and
prevent a collapse of the currency.
	   The deal gave an immediate boost to Russia's hard-hit stock
market, which has lost more than half its value this year.
	   Stocks surged 9 percent Monday and leapt another 14 percent in
early trading Tuesday. It was the market's best showing since the
crisis began biting in May.
	   ``Sentiment has absolutely turned around,'' said Pavel Patyako,
a trader at Chase Manhattan in Moscow.
	   The IMF board meets in Washington on Monday to review the loan
agreement, and it could send dlrs 5 billion or more to Russia as
soon as next week. However, the IMF wants Russia to address chronic
problems such as its budget deficit and its inability to collect
taxes.
	   Yeltsin's administration has sent more than 20 proposals to
parliament, but Communist lawmakers and other government opponents
have resisted spending cuts and tax increases. They say the
government should be spending more money, not less, to help
struggling Russian citizens and companies.
	   Parliament's lower house, the State Duma, turned down several
proposals earlier this month, and Communist leaders have not given
any indication that their position has changed.
	   The Duma holds a special session Wednesday to debate the
economic package, and it was not clear which way they would vote.
	   If parliament turns down Yeltsin's economic plan, then the IMF
and other lenders might withhold the loans, which Russia needs
urgently.
	   The IMF board ``will make a judgment about the (loan) in the
light of whatever decision the Duma makes,'' the IMF's chief
negotiator, John Odling-Smee, said Monday.
	   The proposed loans are to come from three sources: the IMF, the
World Bank and the Japanese government. When combined with
already-negotiated loans, the package totals dlrs 22.6 billion
spread over this year and next.
	   Millions of Russians have been pushed into poverty by the
country's shrinking economy during the 1990s, and the infusion of
cash is designed to ward off another big downturn.

Estrada orders probe of Filipino workers' detention in Saudi

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada ordered
officials Tuesday to investigate the reported detention in Saudi
Arabia of several Filipino workers for preaching Christianity.
	   The Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines has sought
Estrada's help in securing the release of 20 workers arrested
recently by Saudi Arabian authorities for practicing their
religion.
	   Twelve other Filipinos and a Dutch citizen were arrested last
month for distributing materials on Christianity, a government
statement said.
	   Both acts are forbidden in the Islamic country.
	   Eight of the Filipinos were released after the Vatican expressed
its concern over the arrests and detentions of the workers, the
statement said.
	   Four of the freed workers arrived in Manila Tuesday but declined
to talk to reporters, saying their statements might jeopardize the
condition of the Filipinos still in jail.
	   Tens of thousands of Christians, mostly expatriate workers, stay
in Saudi Arabia, one of the world's most important Islamic centers.

Police shoot dead two militants, search for a third continues
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Police fought an hourlong gunbattle Tuesday
with three men wanted in attacks since 1993 that left more than 50
people dead. A policeman and two of the suspects were killed, the
Interior Ministry said.
	   The clash was the first in Egypt since March when security
forces killed a suspected Muslim militant in the south.
	   The gunbattle occurred at the men's hideout on a farm in Abu
Qurqas, 220 kilometers (135 miles) south of Cairo, a region long
scarred by fighting with Muslim militants, the ministry said.
	   Two of the men were shot to death. A policeman was killed as
security forces pursued the third man, who escaped.
	   All three were said to be members of al-Gamaa al-Islamiya, or
the Islamic Group, which the government blames for much of the
political violence in southern Egypt since 1992.
	   More than 1,200 people have died in violence carried out by
Islamic militants who seek to replace Egypt's largely secular
government with strict religious rule.
	   The men were blamed for attacks that killed 43 civilians, seven
policemen and two local guards, mainly in southern Egypt.

Swiss bank ombudsman says U.S., Israeli reporters show prejudice
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ U.S. and Israeli reporters often have
shown prejudice in reporting about Holocaust assets in Swiss banks,
but have recently become ``more realistic,'' the banking ombudsman
said Tuesday.
	   Hanspeter Haeni said he also faced international auditors who
were initially hostile, but in the end found only ``minor technical
deficiencies'' in his operations.
	   Haeni was appointed by the umbrella Swiss Bankers Association to
help the heirs of Holocaust assets look for dormant accounts
belonging to Nazi victims.
	   Until an international panel took over the search in the middle
of last year, Haeni faced heavy demands for interviews, he said in
his annual report for 1997 issued Tuesday.
	   He ``often encountered prejudice and misunderstanding, which
unfortunately all too often proved impossible to correct,''
apparently because of ``a concerted and massive media campaign.''
	   ``U.S. and Israeli media, in particular, often showed a
disturbing inclination to selective reporting, concentrating on
subjects which fitted their preconceived notions,'' he said.
	   Haeni said that objectivity began to return after he reported
last July finding 10 million Swiss francs (dlrs 7.1 million)
belonging to nine Holocaust victims.
	   ``Growing understanding of the subject matter led to what now
became more realistic reporting,'' even from his harshest critics,
he said.
	   It might appear disappointing that less than 1 percent of the
searches succeeded in finding assets deposited before the end of
World War II, especially when compared with ``exaggerated
expectations,'' he said.
	   But considering the lack of documents, the banks' procedure
worked, he said. Some 14 accounts were found for 4,001 possible
names submitted by applicants, many of whom tried the names of
several relatives whose names might have been on an account.
	   Many of the search requests were ``largely based on assumptions
and almost without exception could only be substantiated vaguely or
not at all,'' he said.
	   ``Written evidence shows that some assets supposedly deposited
in Switzerland had already been extorted by the Nazis,'' Haeni
said.
	   In other cases persecuted Nazi victims sent their money to
Switzerland, but then had it transferred elsewhere or reclaimed it
after the war.
	   ``Finally, there also remains the most devastating explanation:
namely, that entire families were wiped out by the Nazi terror,
with the result that no successors can possibly claim still
existing assets.''
	   Some 5,600 people made initial inquiries for Holocaust accounts.
But only about half filled out a questionnaire to start a search,
because many ``received misleading or actually incorrect
information'' that led them to believe they were entitled to
restitution without rights to an account, Haeni said.
	   The subsequent search by a U.S.-led panel still is pending, with
more than 2,000 claims to be judged on the basis of less stringent
rules of evidence.

France shows off military might on Bastille Day

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Still basking in World Cup glory, France on Tuesday
held yet another party, celebrating Bastille Day with a parade to
show off the nation's military might.
	   President Jacques Chirac set the tone, arriving at the
Champs-Elysees for the military parade with a small badge of the
World Cup mascot, ``Footix,'' on the lapel of his dark blue suit.
	   All 22 members of France's World Cup-winning squad later
attended a garden party at Chirac's presidential palace, waving the
World Cup to cheering crowds on arrival.
	   Chirac, in a televised speech, said the victory was particularly
good for France due to the multiracial nature of the team, which
features players of Algerian, African and Armenian origin.
	   ``This French team which is not only red, white and blue, but
also multicolored, gives a beautiful image of France,'' Chirac
said.
	   He spoke of ``an image of a victorious France, a France that
wins together'' and a country ``that for once has distanced itself
from internal squabbles and meanness.''
	   Many have seen the World Cup success as a blow for the
far-right, anti-immigrant National Front, which has criticized
French soccer authorities for ``baptizing foreigners as French
players.''
	   Thousands of people lined the Champs-Elysees to watch the
parade, with dozens of fighter jets and military helicopters
thundering overhead, and tanks rolling down toward the Place de la
Concorde.
	   Also on show were four Tornado jets belonging to Britain's Royal
Air Force.
	   The biggest cheer was for a parade of firemen who drove down the
avenue in their fire trucks.
	   The parade also featured The Republican Guard, riding horses and
wearing their gilded helmets with red plumes. In total, 4,000
troops took part.
	   Celebrations, including street parties, were expected to
continue until the early hours of Wednesday.
	   The Champs-Elysees has been the scene of wild celebrations since
France clinched its first ever World Cup by beating Brazil 3-0 on
Sunday.
	   More than one million people flocked to the avenue Sunday night,
dancing and singing until the early hours of the morning. On
Monday, an estimated 800,000 people turned out to salute the French
team.
	   Bastille Day commemorates the storming by Parisians of the
Bastille prison on July 14, 1789, setting off the French Revolution
that toppled King Louis XVI and put an end to monarchy.
	   Defense Minister Alain Richard said the parade reflected
France's defense restructuring to meet new international
peacekeeping obligations. He said the process began during the
presidency of Francois Mitterand.
	   ``We realized that after Bosnia and the Gulf War we had begun a
new chapter,'' Richard said in an interview with Europe-1 radio.

Top international official tells Bosnian Croats to return home
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSTAR, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ A senior foreign diplomat on
Tuesday urged Bosnian Croats to ignore hard-line leaders and return
to Muslim-dominated areas they fled during the war.
	   ``You can return no matter what anyone says to you and we will
help you,'' said Sir Martin Garrod, an aide to Bosnian High
Representative Carlos Westendorp. ``What we need are Croat leaders
who are prepared to let Croat people to return where they wish to
return.''
	   He spoke in Mostar, which remains divided between Bosnian
Muslims and Croats despite their formal union in a federation meant
to counterbalance Bosnian Serbs controlling the other half of the
country.
	   Some Bosnian Croat leaders continue to favor a separate,
ethnically pure state in the southwest of the country that can
eventually join neighboring Croatia.
	   A precondition for secession would be to keep territories they
control as ethnically clean as possible. Refugee returns would work
against this aim and are generally opposed by hard-line Bosnian
Croat leaders.

Shipowner in custody pending hearing on shooting of rival
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PIRAEUS, Greece (AP) _ A member of one of Greece's most
prominent shipping families was held in custody Tuesday pending a
hearing on charges he took part in the shooting of a business
rival.
	   Vangelis Ventouris, 39, was accused of attempted murder and
illegal use of a weapon after rival shipowner Constantinos
Agapitos, 40, identified him as one of two attackers who shot him
early Monday. The attackers drove past Agapitos' car on a
motorcycle in Pireaus, about 10 kilometers (six miles) south of
Athens.
	   Agapitos was shot in his legs and right shoulder, but doctors
said his life was not in danger.
	   Ventouris' hearing was scheduled for Thursday, when a judge
could order a trial or toss out the charges.
	   Agapitos told police he began receiving threatening telephone
calls after his recent purchase of the ferry Panagia Tinou II,
which had been seized by the National Bank from Ventouris Sea
Lines, run by Vangelis Ventouris.
	   Agapitos, whose family owns the Agapitos Lines passenger
ferries, is in charge of the Agapitos Express Ferries division,
which has seven vessels.

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine Airlines is negotiating
with potential investors who would help form break-off companies to
handle some of the financially troubled airline's major operations,
officials said Tuesday.
	   The PAL officials said they will ask the investors to hire some
of the airline's remaining personnel to prevent more layoffs at the
flag carrier.
	   The move is part of a rehabilitation plan being prepared to save
Asia's oldest airline from closure after a devastating 22-day
strike last month by its pilots' union.
	   PAL officials are negotiating with another union representing
more than 5,000 ground workers who have threatened to strike to
demand the reinstatement of thousands of employees laid off by the
airline last month.
	   PAL senior vice president Manolo Aquino said the airline is
talking with potential investors for spin-off companies that would
handle the airline's maintenance and engineering, ground handling,
flight information services, cargo services and catering.
	   Another PAL official, Avelino Zapanta, said the potential
investors include Lufthansa Airlines and General Electric.
	   PAL's three unions have opposed the plan to break the airline up
into separate companies, saying it is an attempt to reduce the
unions' influence.
	   Zapanta said the airline remains in precarious condition with
assets totaling 90 billion pesos (dlrs 2.1 billion) and financial
obligations amounting to 85 billion pesos (dlrs 2 billion). ``The
difference is so slim. Just one cough will blow it away,'' he said.
	   The airlines' 625 pilots went on strike for 22 days last month,
aggravating financial losses caused by Asia's currency storm and
setting back an ambitious dlrs 4 billion modernization program. PAL
fired all the striking pilots after they ignored a government
return-to-work order.
	   At the height of the pilots' walkout, PAL laid off 5,000 of its
more than 13,000 workers to minimize losses, prompting the
airline's ground personnel and flight attendants to threaten to
strike as well.
	   PAL received approval Tuesday to dispose of about dlrs 1.75
million in assets to raise money for its operations.
	   The assets to be sold include two unused flight control
computers, a boiler unit, nine new tow trucks, and aircraft parts.
They will be returned to suppliers for refunds, the airline said.
	   The Securities and Exchange Commission approved the disposal on
the condition that the money be used strictly for the airline's
operations.
	   All asset sales and disposals by Philippine Airlines beyond 3
million pesos (dlrs 71,500) now require approval from the SEC,
after the airline secured the commission's intercession last month
for a rehabilitation plan.
	   Under the rehabilitation plan, PAL is slashing its work force,
disposing of 40 of its 54 planes, suspending more than two-thirds
of its routes and selling some subsidiaries. The commission also
allowed the airline to defer payments on maturing financial
obligations worth dlrs 2 billion.

Spanish bull-running festival ends with one person injured
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PAMPLONA, Spain (AP) _ Some 2,000 people raced in the final
bull-run of Spain's annual San Fermin festival Tuesday, with one
person suffering head injuries from a fall.
	   Hundreds of thousands of visitors flock each year to the San
Fermin fiesta whose main attraction is the dawn bull run.
Participants test their bravery and speed by racing ahead of six
bulls through the cobblestone streets of this small northern town.
	   The bulls are fought, and invariably killed, by professional
matadors in the town's bull ring later in the day.
	   One Spaniard was treated for head injuries after falling during
the final run, according to the local government press department.
He was later released from hospital.
	   The centuries-old festival, which includes nine days of non-stop
revelry, became increasingly popular internationally following the
publication in 1927 of Ernest Hemingway's ``The Sun Also Rises''
based on the writer's experiences in Pamplona.
	   Injuries are frequent in the runs and death always a
possibility. This year just three people were treated for horn
wounds although none were in serious condition.
	   The last fatality was a 22-year-old American who was gored to
death in 1995, the 13th runner to die since officials began keeping
records in 1924.

Postal workers strike enters sixth day in India
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Striking postal workers marched in New
Delhi Tuesday as mail piled up in post offices across India for the
sixth day.
	   The government has given in to many of their demands, but
Tuesday's protesters were pressing for the payment of pensions to
300,000 non-contract workers, said a spokesman for the National
Federation of Postal Employees.
	   No talks were scheduled with the government Tuesday to break the
deadlock. Press Trust of India news agency said the government was
considering bringing in courier services to fill in for the more
than 650,000 striking postal workers
	   A huge backlog of unsorted mail piled up in post offices staffed
by temporary workers, former workers recalled from retirement and
soldiers.
	   Leftist parties that control postal workers' unions walked out
of the upper house of parliament after heated arguments with
Communications Minister Sushma Swaraj, PTI said.
	   Swaraj said the strike was staged to embarrass the right-wing
government.
	   The demand for pensions for so-called ``temporary'' workers,
some of whom have been employed for decades with contracts, will be
considered by the federal Cabinet soon, PTI quoted the minister as
saying.
	   The postal workers went on strike last Thursday, demanding
higher wages and bonuses. They included 300,000 non-contract
workers who don't get the benefits their colleagues enjoy.
	   The government has agreed to most of their demands, including
revised salaries for permanent employees and employment benefits
for the non-contract workers. But the government has refused to
grant lifelong pensions to the non-contract workers.
	   The wages of most of the postal workers will be raised to 3,050
rupees (dlrs 72) a month from 2,750 rupees (dlrs 65). The average
annual per capita income in India, one of the world's poorest
countries, is about 1,500 rupees (dlrs 37) a month.

Treason trial of former prime minister begins
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) _ Azerbaijan's former prime minister went
on trial for treason Tuesday in the country's Supreme Court, and he
could be sentenced to life in prison if convicted.
	   Suret Huseinov is charged with high treason for leading an
attempted coup against President Geidar Aliev in 1994.
	   Huseinov, who was prime minister at the time of the attempted
coup, briefly seized control of parts of the former Soviet
republic. But he fled to Russia when the coup collapsed. He was
arrested on the outskirts of Moscow in 1997 and extradited to
Azerbaijan.
	   Azerbaijani authorities also accuse Huseinov of organizing coup
attempts in the republic in 1995 and 1996, using the army in trying
to disperse 1993 protests, and stealing coins of historical value.
	   Aliev, Azerbaijan's former Communist Party boss, has dealt
harshly with political opponents and has sought the extradition of
a number of former Azerbaijani officials who took refuge in Russia.

U.S. military official praises Indonesian armed forces
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A senior U.S. military officer praised
the Indonesian armed forces Tuesday for their handling of the
nation's economic and political turmoil.
	   Air Force Gen. Joseph Ralston, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, discussed U.S.-Indonesian affairs after a meeting with
President B.J. Habibie at the presidential palace.
	   He said the Indonesian military, known by its acronym ABRI, had
helped secure stability after the unrest that led to the
resignation in May of authoritarian President Suharto.
	   ``We are very pleased with the role that ABRI has played during
the past crisis,'' Ralston said at a news conference. ``I think
they have acted very responsibly. They have established the
conditions by which you can have political stability.''
	   Under armed forces chief Gen. Wiranto, the military tried to
maintain order amid student protests against Suharto and riots over
price increases that killed as many as 1,200 people in Jakarta.
	   It also backed the transition from Suharto to his civilian
successor, Habibie, despite reports that many in the military
disapproved of the new president.
	   However, human rights groups have criticized the Indonesian
military for its frequent use of force to curb student rallies. In
the most dramatic case, security forces killed four students at a
demonstration in Jakarta, triggering the citywide rioting.
	   Critics also accused the armed forces of responding slowly to
much of the rioting and of failing to thoroughly investigate
reports that rioters raped ethnic Chinese women.
	   Additionally, the military has been tainted by its alleged
involvement in the kidnapping of pro-democracy activists earlier
this year. On Tuesday, military police arrested seven elite
Indonesian soldiers suspected in the case.
	   Ralston said the purpose of his visit was to resume military
contacts between Indonesia and the United States, including
engineering, medical and humanitarian cooperation. The contacts
were held up by the political turmoil.

Spree River returns to bed as tunneling through Berlin continues
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Two years after being rerouted for construction of
a massive new train and car tunnel through central Berlin, the
Spree River was allowed back into its own bed Tuesday.
	   A 200-meter (660-foot) stretch of the river near the historic
Reichstag parliament building was moved about 70 meters (230 feet)
north in July 1996 to allow for work on the 3.5 kilometer (2.2
mile) long tunnel.
	   The tunnel, which goes under the Tiergarten park, is intended to
ease the traffic congestion expected to accompany the federal
government's move from Bonn.
	   On Tuesday, workers began diverting the river back into its
original bed, a process that is expected to take two or three
weeks. Once the artificial riverbed dries out, digging will resume
there, the railway said.
	   The tunnel will be divided into eight sections _ two for auto
traffic, two for subways and four for long-distance trains running
north and south through Berlin.
	   The trains will connect with east-west rail traffic at the
under-construction Lehrter station, which will become Europe's
biggest train hub.
	   In addition, three train stations are being overhauled for a
total project cost of more than 4.5 billion marks (dlrs 2.5
billion).
	   Although the government's move begins next year, the tunnel will
not be finished until 2003, the German railway said.

Iranian defector's father says U.S. exploiting his son
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ The former commander of Iran's Revolutionary
Guards, whose son defected this year to the United States, says
Washington has exploited his son's plight for propaganda.
	   ``The U.S. government's exploitation of a young psychologically
traumatized person is a politically ugly act,'' the Iran News daily
quoted Maj. Gen. Mohsen Rezaei as saying Tuesday.
	   ``This act by the United States betrays the inability of the
United States to confront Iran,'' he said.
	   Rezaei's eldest son, Ahmad, said last week that he had been
granted political asylum in the United States.
	   In an interview with the Voice of America's Persian service last
month, he said he fled Iran because he ``was seeking a way to bring
peace and quiet to my life.''
	   The VOA interview, in Farsi, was denounced by Iran.
	   Shortly before the interview was broadcast, Iran's official
Islamic Republic News Agency reported that Rezaei had been
kidnapped by Americans in March as he was trying to return home
from a visit to the United Arab Emirates.
	   In the interview, the younger Rezaei accused Iran's religious
government of giving Islam a bad name by committing ``all their
illegal work under the guise of Islam.''
	   Rezaei, speaking from Los Angeles, said he left Iran on Feb. 6
and arrived in the United States on March 26.
	   His father, a hard-liner, is secretary of the powerful
Expediency Council, a key policy-making body.

Philippine president orders importation of sugar
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada has
authorized imports of sugar at a lower tariff rate to prevent
shortages, the presidential palace said Tuesday.
	   Nicolas Alonso, administrator of the Sugar Regulatory
Administration, said the Philippines will import about 200,000 tons
of sugar to fill the country's buffer stock, normally about 300,000
tons.
	   Philippine sugar production is estimated to reach only about
115,000 tons by August, the end of the current crop year, Alonso
said.
	   He said the government plans to lower the 65 percent tariff on
sugar from the Philippines' partners in the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations to 50 percent.
	   Filipino sugar producers are not resisting the plan to lower the
tariff, which the government hopes to implement before the end of
July so that the first shipments can arrive by mid-August, he said.
	   Most of the sugar is expected to come from Thailand.
	   If the tariff is not lowered, the price of imported sugar would
shoot up to more than 900 pesos per 50-kilogram bag (97 cents a
pound), Alonso said.
	   He said the new tariff would not be too high for consumers and
not too low for sugar producers.
	   ``It's a good balance,'' he said.

Court fines two newspaper publishers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Two newspaper owners have been fined for
``publishing falsehoods,'' papers reported Tuesday, in the latest
move against press freedom in Iran.
	   A court convicted Mohammad Mahdavi Khorrami, the publisher of
the now defunct Gozaresh-e-Ruz daily, of ``publishing falsehoods,
and material and images offending public decency,'' the newspapers
Kayhan and Iran Daily said.
	   In its sentence Monday, the court ordered Khorrami to pay 12
million rials (dlrs 4,000) and banned him for three years from
owning or heading any publication.
	   The same court in Tehran also convicted Seyed Morteza Nabavi,
the publisher of the newspaper Resalat, of publishing
``falsehoods'' early this year by distorting statements from an
Iranian military official, the newspapers said.
	   Nabavi was fined 3 million rials (dlrs 1,000) on Monday.
	   The court, which specializes in press matters, sent a statement
to the newspapers giving its findings.
	   Gozaresh-e-Ruz, a moderate paper, angered authorities in June
when it reported that Iranian officials had been transferring money
to foreign bank accounts.
	   In its first week of publication in May, Gozaresh-e-Ruz ran a
front-page picture of a teenage boy and girl with the caption,
``Friendship Under Fear.'' The line referred to the prohibition on
dating under Iran's strict Islamic code.
	   The government accused the paper of ``promoting issues
detrimental to public decency, insulting the authorities and
disturbing public opinion.''
	   The paper closed last month in a move widely seen as
anticipating its being shut down by the court.
	   Press freedom blossomed after the moderate President Mohammad
Khatami took office last August. But his hard-line rivals in the
hierarchy have been trying to reverse the trend.
	   On June 10, a court revoked the operating license of Jameah, an
outspoken daily that had been testing the limits of press freedom.
The authorities accused it of publishing ``insults and lies.''
	   But the popular Jameah has said it will continue to appear until
the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance, which is in charge of
licensing, officially informs it of the revocation.

King Hussein off to Mayo Clinic for medical checkup
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Hussein's remarks, trims elsewhere. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ King Hussein of Jordan left Tuesday for
medical tests at the Mayo Clinic in the United States after
suffering from a high fever that has caused him fatigue.
	   Jordanian doctors believe that the illness is a recurrence of a
bout of bacteria that attacked his lymphatic glands in October, an
official said, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Last year, Hussein suffered fever, fatigue and weight loss, but
doctors and the king himself said he had recovered in the spring as
a result of antibiotics subscribed after tests during another visit
to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.
	   ``Actually, I have spells of high fever, three times a day, and
the other syptoms which I had previously,'' Hussein told the
state-run Jordan Television. Exminations he underwent in Amman
proved ``there is no big problem at all,'' he said.
	   The Jordanian official said after telephone consultations with
the Mayo Clinic, Hussein decided to go there for a complete medical
examination ``to closely analyze the case.''
	   The king underwent surgery to remove cancer from his ureter and
left kidney in the same hospital in 1992.
	   Hussein has looked healthy and recently participated in several
state functions and ribbon-cutting events, such as high school
graduations, lectures and field inspections of various projects.
	   Even when he left Amman on Tuesday, he walked comfortably on the
airport's tarmac and shook hands with family members and officials.
He smiled as he took control of his private jet with his
American-born wife, Queen Noor, sitting next to him in the cockpit.
Hussein is a certified pilot.

	   LONDON (AP) _ A man who placed a 16-pound (dlrs 26.60) bet on a
five-winning selection which included France winning the World Cup
has failed to collect his 57,537-pound (dlrs 95,500) payoff.
	   The mystery winner placed the bet with British bookmaker William
Hill at Surbiton, Surrey, on July 4 but has not been seen in the
betting shop since.
	   William Hill spokesman Graham Sharpe said he had no idea who the
man was.
	   The correct selections on the winning ticket were: Arsenal to
win the FA Cup at odds of 8-1; Chelsea to win the Cup Winner's Cup
at 5-1; Nottingham Forest for Division One at 6-1; Notts County to
win Division Three at 11-1; and France to win the World Cup.

Rebels kill village chief, four relatives in eastern Turkey
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DIYARBAKIR, Turkey (AP) _ Kurdish rebels stormed into a village
in eastern Turkey and shot to death the village chief and four
members of his family, the Anatolia news agency said Tuesday.
	   The overnight attack took place in Topca in the province of
Erzurum. Anatolia said the rebels opened fire when Topca's
administrative chief refused to hand over weapons belonging to the
government-backed village guards.
	   An estimated 90,000 village guards are fighting alongside the
Turkish army in its war against the Kurdistan Workers Party, which
has been fighting for autonomy in Turkey's southeast since 1984.
Some 37,000 people have died in the conflict.

Swiss bank ombudsman says U.S., Israeli reporters prejudiced
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ U.S. and Israeli media have often
been prejudiced in their reporting about Holocaust assets in Swiss
banks, but have recently become ``more realistic,'' the banking
ombudsman said Tuesday.
	   Hanspeter Haeni said he also faced international auditors who
were initially hostile, but in the end found only ``minor technical
deficiencies'' in his operations.
	   Haeni was appointed by the umbrella Swiss Bankers Association to
help the heirs of Holocaust assets look for dormant accounts
belonging to Nazi victims.
	   Until an international panel took over the search in the middle
of last year, Haeni faced heavy demands for interviews, he said in
his annual report for 1997 issued Tuesday.
	   He ``often encountered prejudice and misunderstanding, which
unfortunately all too often proved impossible to correct,''
apparently because of ``a concerted and massive media campaign.''
	   ``U.S. and Israeli media, in particular, often showed a
disturbing inclination to selective reporting, concentrating on
subjects which fitted their preconceived notions,'' he said.
	   Haeni said that objectivity began to return after he reported
last July finding 10 million Swiss francs (dlrs 7.1 million)
belonging to nine Holocaust victims.
	   ``Growing understanding of the subject matter led to what now
became more realistic reporting,'' even from his harshest critics,
he said.
	   It might appear disappointing that less than 1 percent of the
searches succeeded in finding assets deposited before the end of
World War II, especially when compared with ``exaggerated
expectations,'' he said.
	   But considering the lack of documents, the banks' procedure
worked, he said. Some 14 accounts were found for 4,001 possible
names submitted by applicants, many of whom tried the names of
several relatives whose names might have been on an account.
	   Many of the search requests were ``largely based on assumptions
and almost without exception could only be substantiated vaguely or
not at all,'' he said.
	   ``Written evidence shows that some assets supposedly deposited
in Switzerland had already been extorted by the Nazis,'' Haeni
said.
	   In other cases persecuted Nazi victims sent their money to
Switzerland, but then had it transferred elsewhere or reclaimed it
after the war.
	   ``Finally, there also remains the most devastating explanation:
namely, that entire families were wiped out by the Nazi terror,
with the result that no successors can possibly claim still
existing assets.''
	   Some 5,600 people made initial inquiries for Holocaust accounts.
But only about half filled out a questionnaire to start a search,
because many ``received misleading or actually incorrect
information'' that led them to believe they were entitled to
restitution without rights to an account, Haeni said.
	   The subsequent search by a U.S.-led panel is pending, with more
than 2,000 claims to be judged on the basis of less stringent rules
of evidence.

<TEXT>
	   BALLYMONEY, Northern Ireland (AP) _ As a mournful church bell
tolled Tuesday morning, the small coffins of three young brothers
were carried by pallbearers into a rural church near the home where
they died in a sectarian firebomb attack, victims of a war of
hatred in Northern Ireland.
	   A huge crowd stood in silence outside the Roman Catholic Church
of Our Lady and St. Patrick, many wiping tears as Richard, Mark and
Jason Quinn, who were raised as Protestants, began their final
journey followed by their grief-stricken mother and surviving
brother.
	   Pictures of the boys in happier times lay on top of the white
coffins with brass nameplates and crosses.
	   Half a dozen floral tributes rested against the church's stone
wall. One card read: ``Sleep in peace little angels.''
	   As the coffins were carried from their grandmother's bungalow in
Rasharkin, about 7 miles 12 kms) away, relatives, friends and
neighbors sobbed. Their mother, Chrissie Quinn, 29, her eyes red
from crying, led a procession of dozens of relatives and friends as
well as fire officers who tried to save the children. Her close
friend John Dillon wept and stroked the coffin he carried to the
hearse, where the brothers were laid side by side.
	   Tensions spilling over from a blocked Protestant march outside a
rural church near Portadown were blamed for the early Sunday
morning firebombing of the Quinn house. Police said they believed
the family was targeted because Chrissie Quinn lived there with her
Protestant boyfriend.
	   Two men were being questioned, police said.
	   During the Requiem Mass, the boys' aunt, Amanda Ramsey, read a
poem she wrote with two other people called ``Little Lips'' that
reduced the congregation to tears and drew spontaneous applause at
its close.
	   In a strong ringing voice, she read: ``Why would someone do this
is a question on our lips? Who would have such evil at their
fingertips? ... Richard, Mark and Jason in our memory you will
stay. I can still feel the cold, wet lips from when I kissed you
and you were on your way.'' The poem included a line, ``Please let
the evil people be brought to justice soon.''
	   The Rev. Peter Forde told the congregation that many people were
undoubtedly asking whether it was God's will that three young boys
would be killed by a firebomb.
	   ``But then certainly it is not God who commits murder, or any
evil act. ... God would not have chosen it this way. I'm sure he
had interesting plans, good plans, for Richard, for Mark and for
Jason. But someone, certainly not through God's will, put an end to
those plans,'' the priest said.
	   Forde asked the family to trust that God was now looking after
Richard, Mark and Jason _ and that one day ``all of us will meet
them again.''
	   ``We meet in sorrow at the death of these children, but our
shared sorrow is a beacon of hope for all the community. And in
this our very troubled country, may it light our way ahead,'' he
said.
	   The Most Rev. Patrick Walsh, Bishop of Down and Connor, called
it ``the saddest of sad funerals.''
	   Since the horrific murders, he said, ``voices have been raised _
voices of sanity, voices of reason. Agonizing words, words of
self-examination, courageous words, words of strength, words of
healing have been spoken.''
	   ``But perhaps now the time for words is over. Perhaps now it is
now time for silence, a silence in which we can all hear the voice
of God,'' he said. ``... There is silence on this sad day here in
Ballymoney and in Rasharkin _ may that silence fall over every town
and village in our land, not a brooding silence but the silence in
which we can all listen to what God is saying to us. Or will silent
voice try to drown out once more the quiet voice of God?''
	   At the end of the 90 minute service, pallbearers carried the
three coffins to the hearse, and the boys began their final
journey. Hundreds followed the hearse including Seamus Mallon,
Catholic deputy leader of Northern Ireland's new government.
	   Irene Quinn, the boys' grandmother, said her daughter wanted
them buried in Rasharkin, where the family has its roots, so she
never again would have to set foot in Ballymoney. Chrissie Quinn's
oldest son, 13-year-old Lee, spent Saturday night with his
grandmother and so escaped the attack.
	   Ms. Quinn is Catholic, but was raising the boys as Protestants
because she thought it would make life easier for them in
Ballymoney, a hard-line Protestant stronghold about 40 miles (60
kms) northwest of Belfast.

Iranian court fines two newspaper publishers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Two newspaper owners have been fined for
``publishing falsehoods,'' papers reported Tuesday, in what
appeared to be the latest move against press freedom in Iran.
	   A court convicted Mohammad Mahdavi Khorrami, the publisher of
the now defunct Gozaresh-e-Ruz daily, of ``publishing falsehoods,
and material and images offending public decency,'' the newspapers
Kayhan and Iran Daily said.
	   In its sentence Monday, the court ordered Khorrami to pay 12
million rials (dlrs 4,000) and banned him for three years from
owning or heading any publication.
	   The same court in Tehran also convicted Seyed Morteza Nabavi,
the publisher of the newspaper Resalat, of publishing
``falsehoods'' early this year by distorting statements from an
Iranian military official, the newspapers said.
	   Nabavi was fined 3 million rials (dlrs 1,000) on Monday.
	   The court, which specializes in press matters, sent a statement
to the newspapers giving its findings.
	   Gozaresh-e-Ruz, a moderate paper, angered authorities in June
when it reported that Iranian officials had been transferring money
to foreign bank accounts.
	   In its first week of publication in May, Gozaresh-e-Ruz ran a
front-page picture of a teenage boy and girl with the caption,
``Friendship Under Fear.'' The line referred to the prohibition on
dating under Iran's strict Islamic code.
	   The government accused the paper of ``promoting issues
detrimental to public decency, insulting the authorities and
disturbing public opinion.''
	   The paper closed last month in a move widely seen as
anticipating its being shut down by the court.
	   Press freedom blossomed after the moderate President Mohammad
Khatami took office last August. But his hard-line rivals in the
hierarchy have been trying to reverse the trend.
	   On June 10, a court revoked the operating license of Jameah, an
outspoken daily that had been testing the limits of press freedom.
The authorities accused it of publishing ``insults and lies.''
	   But the popular Jameah has said it will continue to appear until
the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance, which is in charge of
licensing, officially informs it of the revocation.

	   ROME (AP) _ A wildcat strike by bus and subway workers on
Tuesday snarled Rome's traffic and stranded thousands of tourists
and commuters.
	   The nine-hour strike came without warning at the morning rush
hour (0600 gmt). Transport unions were protesting the terms of
contracts offered to new workers.
	   Tuesday's walkout came as a series of transport strikes
nationwide threaten to disrupt travel throughout Italy the week.

Malaysian electric company defers joint venture with Indonesia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's electric company has
deferred a joint venture project to build a coal-fired power plant
in Sumatra, Indonesia, because of the region's economic crisis, a
news report said Tuesday.
	   ``It is difficult to say when (the project can proceed), but we
are looking at a period of between 10 and 15 years,'' the national
news agency Bernama quoted Ahmad Tajuddin Ali, executive chairman
of Tenaga Nasional Berhad, as saying.
	   Demand for electricity in Malaysia has also slowed, Tajuddin
told reporters in Kulim, about 400 kilometers (250 miles) northwest
of Kuala Lumpur.
	   Many factories, the biggest users of electric power, had cut
their working hours due to lower demand for their products locally
and overseas.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Basking in World Cup glory, France on Tuesday held
yet another party, celebrating Bastille Day with a parade to show
off the nation's military might.
	   President Jacques Chirac set the tone, arriving at the
Champs-Elysees for the military parade with a small badge of the
World Cup mascot, ``Footix,'' on the lapel of his dark blue suit.
	   All 22 members of France's World Cup-winning squad later
attended a garden party at Chirac's presidential palace, waving the
World Cup to cheering crowds on arrival.
	   Thousands of people, many of them youngsters, were invited to
the garden party and sang ``We are the champions'' and popular
soccer chants when the team was presented.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ King Hussein Tuesday urged the Israeli
government to make ``courageous and swift'' actions towards a
Middle East peace settlement.
	   ``I am concerned over the peace process and the current
situation,'' Hussein said in remarks broadcast by the the state-run
Jordan Television.
	   ``There must be courageous and swift decisions taken to serve
the peace process and towards a comprehensive settlement,'' Hussein
said.
	   ``We should concentrate on the time element'' because ``we have
lost a lot in the past'' he added.
	   Hussein made the remarks after talks with visiting Israeli Labor
Party leader Ehud Barak. Later, the king left for the United States
for medical tests.
	   Besides Hussein, Barak met with the king's brother, Crown Prince
Hassan. The meetings were the latest in a series that Jordanian
leaders have had with Israeli opposition leaders amid mounting
frustration over the stalemate.
	   Former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres held talks with the
Jordanians on Monday, a day after a visit by Yossi Beilin, an
opposition lawmaker.
	   A Jordanian government official said the meetings were ``aimed
at exchanging views on the stalled Mideast peace process, to listen
to the viewpoint of the Israeli Labor Party on the peace stalemate
and discuss ways to revive the peace process.''
	   The official, speaking on customary condition of anonymity,
declined to provide details.
	   Jordan has become increasingly critical of the policies of the
right-wing Israeli administration. Amman is eager for a settlement
to ease opposition among its people to its 1994 treaty with Israel.

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Syria and Iraq signed a memorandum of
understanding Tuesday to reopen a pipeline after a 16-year closure,
Iraqi Oil Minister Amer Mohammed Rashid said.
	   The pipeline, which can carry 650,000 barrels a day, links
Iraq's Kirkuk oil fields to the Mediterranean terminals of Banias
in Syria and Tripoli in Lebanon. Syria closed the pipeline in 1982
to support its ally Iran during the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war.
	   On Monday, Rashid said the pipeline would first pump 300,000
barrels a day on an experimental basis.
	   The two countries also agreed to construct a new pipeline with a
capacity of 1.4 million barrels a day and a refinery in Banias.
Rashid did not give an estimate of its cost.
	   The U.N. Security Council decided in February to allow Iraq to
boost the value of oil sales under the oil-for-food deal from dlrs
2 billion within six months to dlrs 5.2 billion.
	   The United Nations imposed sweeping economic sanctions against
Iraq following Baghdad's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The oil-for-food
deal is an exemption to those sanctions.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ Aluminum Bahrain B.S.C. signed a dlrs 400
million loan Tuesday with a consortium of local and international
banks to finance three new projects.
	   The projects _ construction of a petroleum coke calcination
plant and a desalination plant and upgrade of a jetty _ were
approved by the company last December. They will take more than two
years to complete.
	   The company said in a statement that the banks involved in the
arrangement are: Al-Ahli Commercial bank B.S.C, Arab Banking Corp.,
Arab National Bank, Chase Manhattan Bank, Societe Generale,
Somitomo Bank Ltd., National Bank of Bahrain B.S.C., Bank of
Bahrain &AMP; Kuwait B.S.C., Gulf International Bank B.S.C, Riyad Bank,

Grindlays Bahrain Bank B.S.C.
	   The three projects will be located at the company's Marine
terminal, some 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) away from its giant
smelter, the largest in the Middle East.
	   ALBA is 77 percent owned by the Bahraini government, 20 percent
by the Saudi Public Investment Fund and 3 percent by Germany's
Breton Investments Ltd.
	   The company recorded dlrs 725 million in sales last years, which
was 39.2 percent increase over sales in 1994.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Its government in disarray and economy in need of
quick remedies, Japan groped for a decisive and capable successor
Tuesday to take the helm from resigning Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto.
	   But the country's ruling Liberal Democrats ran headfirst into
the same quandary that had helped keep Hashimoto in power long
after he became unpopular: lack of an heir apparent.
	   The top possibilities _ Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi and former
Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama _ seemed short of either
popular appeal or the expertise needed to quell Japan's worst
recession since World War II.
	   ``At this point, I'm not sure who the alternatives are,'' said
Ron Bevacqua, economist with Merrill Lynch Japan Inc.
	   Hashimoto resigned Monday, stepping down a day after voters
angry over his handling of the failing economy dealt the LDP a
bruising defeat in elections for the upper house of Parliament.
	   The departure created a vacuum at the helm of the world's
second-largest economy, and triggered calls at home and abroad for
a talented, strong successor _ and fast.
	   ``What is really required now ... is a person with the will and
capacity to face up to the trials facing the Japanese economy,''
the newspaper Asahi said in an editorial Tuesday.
	   Tokyo financial markets reflected optimism that the election
would shock Japan's leadership into action.
	   The 225-issue benchmark Nikkei Stock Average gained 128.52
points, or 0.79 percent, closing at 16,488.91. In late afternoon,
the dollar bought 141.36 yen, down 1.06 yen from late Monday in
Tokyo.
	   The LDP, which still controls the powerful lower house of
Parliament and therefore the key to the premiership, set itself a
strict timetable, planning to choose a new party president next
Tuesday.
	   The nominee would then go to a vote before Parliament. Hashimoto
will serve until a successor is approved, a move expected by July
30.
	   If the schedule was clear, the choice of a leader was not. The
lack of a clear successor, in fact, had helped keep Hashimoto in
office for 2 1/2 years _ long by Japanese standards _ despite a
slumping economy and pitiful approval ratings.
	   Both Obuchi, 61, and Kajiyama, 72, are old-style politicians in
the party, and not economic experts, although in recent months
Kajiyama has pushed more aggressively for economic reforms.
	   But the result of Sunday's election has been seen not only as a
condemnation of Hashimoto's economic policies, but also of business
as usual in the LDP _ meaning power brokers like Obuchi and
Kajiyama could prove to be liabilities if chosen to lead the party.
	   ``Obuchi would be a big mistake,'' said Bevacqua. ``A decision
in his favor would be driven by internal balancing act, and a sign
that the LDP hasn't really learned its lesson yet.''
	   Kajiyama also has a serious international image problem.
	   In 1990, he compared blacks in the United States to prostitutes
in Japan. He retracted the remark but later stirred up more trouble
by suggesting that women forced into prostitution by Japanese
troops during World War II did it for the money.
	   Meanwhile, some younger LDP lawmakers were backing outspoken
56-year-old Health Minister Junichiro Koizumi, but he is unlikely
to get enough support from the party elders, crucial for the party
presidency. It was also unclear how skilled a leader he would be.
	   Across the aisle in the opposition camp is Japan's most popular
politician: former Health Minister Naoto Kan, who leads the new
Democratic Party.
	   The Democrats, who pushed for tax cuts to stimulate the economy,
were also the biggest gainers in the weekend elections. But Kan,
51, stands no chance of becoming prime minister, even if his party
manages to fight the odds and unite a fragmented opposition.
	   In a survey of 55 top corporate executives published Tuesday by
the newspaper Nihon Keizai, only 16 said they backed any politician
as a replacement for Hashimoto. Of those, 13 tapped Kajiyama.
	   Business leaders _ both Japanese and foreign _ seemed to feel
that quick moves to reform the country's troubled economy and
financial sector were more vital than who was named to do it.
	   ``The swiftness with which these proposals can be implemented is
by far more important,'' Michael Jordan, chairman and chief
executive officer of CBS Corp., said at a U.S.-Japan business
conference.

Russian prime minister makes debut visit to Beijing

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Russian Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko arrived
in Beijing Tuesday to discuss boosting sagging trade and investing
in China's energy sector.
	   The five-hour stopover on his way home from Japan marked
Kiriyenko's first trip to Russia's powerful neighbor and former
socialist adversary since he took over as prime minister in April.
	   Kiriyenko met with Premier Zhu Rongji for talks on trade and
other issues, and was to see Chinese President Jiang Zemin later
Tuesday. The meetings were partly to prepare for Jiang's visit to
Russia in September, said Evgueni Verlin, a Russian Embassy
spokesman.
	   After meeting Zhu, Kiriyenko told reporters that he wanted
Chinese companies to establish production lines in Russia. He
suggested they could set up in mining towns, ``where we have so
many available workers and not enough work.''
	   Verlin, the embassy spokesman, said Kiriyenko was on ``a working
visit to discuss problems with trade and to search for
breakthroughs, especially in the field of energy.''
	   The Russian prime minister and Zhu were to discuss projects to
pipe gas from eastern Siberia and build a nuclear power plant in
eastern China's Lianyungang, Verlin said.
	   Financing is believed to have been a problem for the projects.
Verlin noted that Kiriyenko is accompanied by Russia's ministers
for finance and atomic energy.
	   Scientific cooperation and measures to boost slackening trade _
by opening Chinese department stores in Moscow and other Russian
cities, for example _ also were to be discussed, Verlin said.
	   Russia and China have set a U.S. dlrs 20 billion target for
two-way trade by 2000. But commerce between them amounted to just
U.S. dlrs 6.12 billion in 1997, down 10 percent from the previous
year.
	   Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov will follow up with
further talks on a visit to China July 22-26, said Chinese Foreign
Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang.

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji told Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat on Tuesday that Israel was wrong for delaying
troop withdrawals from the West Bank.
	   Zhu reaffirmed China's longstanding support for the
Palestinians' ``just cause,'' and said Chinese businesses would
support a Palestinian state with investments.
	   ``Israel's delay in withdrawing from the West Bank is wrong,''
Zhu told Arafat at the start of their meeting.
	   Zhu added that he had told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu during a visit to China in May that security could come
not through ``a Great Wall, or nuclear weapons, but only through
peaceful coexistence.''
	   Netanyahu's government has stalled on withdrawing troops. It has
refused a U.S. compromise that would link a pull-back from 13
percent of the West Bank with corresponding security gestures from
the Palestinians.
	   Despite China's support, Zhu said Beijing would never be a
moderator in the Middle East peace talks.
	   Arafat's visit to Beijing, which began Monday, has focused on
using Chinese influence to revive the peace process and securing
support for the Palestinians.
	   Chinese President Jiang Zemin told Arafat Monday night that
China would support an independent Palestinian state and pledged to
use China's U.N. Security Council seat to push forward the peace
process, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   Li Ruihuan, another senior Chinese leader who met Arafat
Tuesday, said the Palestinians will succeed in establishing an
independent Palestinian state if they remain ``united and stick to
principles and flexible and pragmatic tactics,'' Xinhua said.
	   Li, a member of the ruling Communist Party's elite Politburo
Standing Committee, said the Palestinian leader is respected
worldwide and ``even ordinary Chinese, like villagers in remote
areas, know Arafat's name,'' Xinhua said.
	   Li added that the best way to resolve the Middle East issue is
to negotiate in accordance with U.N. resolutions and the principle
of land for peace, Xinhua said.
	   China has long been a strong supporter of the Palestinian cause
but over the past decade has developed good diplomatic and strong
economic ties with Israel.

China: No pledge to Israel not to sell nuclear technology to Iran
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ China never promised Israel that it would
not sell nuclear technology to Iran, a Chinese minister said in
remarks published Tuesday.
	   In any case, China abides by the treaties that control arms
sales ``therefore there is no need'' to make such promises, Chinese
Assistant Foreign Minister Ji Peiding was quoted as saying by
Egypt's newspaper Al-Ahram.
	   In an interview with Al-Ahram, Ji denied a statement by Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he had received an
``absolute commitment'' from Chinese leaders that they have not
provided Iran with nuclear weapons technology and would not do so
in the future.
	   The reported commitment covered biological, chemical and nuclear
weapons as well as surface-to-surface missiles.
	   Netanyahu made the statement after his May visit to China.
	   Ji said China's cooperation with Iran ``in the peaceful use of
nuclear technology has stopped because of a lack of funding.'' He
did elaborate or explain the extent of the nuclear cooperation with
Iran.
	   Ji said that Netanyahu had explained to Chinese officials that
his government was worried that Iran, which opposes the existence
of Israel, could attack the Jewish state.
	   According to Israel's Haaretz newspaper, China supplied Iran in
March with nearly 1,000 tons of high-quality steel, which was
apparently intended for ballistic missiles. The transaction ranked
high on Netanyahu's agenda during his meetings with Chinese
leaders.
	   Asked why China never commented on Netanyahu's statement
earlier, Ji said ``Netanyahu is a politician who was addressing his
constituency (in Israel) and that is all I can say.''
	   ``I repeat we do not have to pledge to stop cooperation with
Arab states and Iran because it is of a kind that does not go
overboard (into nuclear technology),'' Ji said.

Serbian opposition meets with Kosovo Albanians

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ In their own search for peace in
Kosovo, Serbian opposition leaders on Tuesday left for the troubled
province for meetings with local Serb politicians and ethnic
Albanian representatives.
	   The ``Alliance for Change'' includes the most prominent
opposition parties and is led by former Yugoslav Premier Milan
Panic, a Serbian-American businessman.
	   ``The absolute priority is to establish peace and security in
Kosovo,'' said Zoran Djindjic, the leader of the Democratic Party
and former mayor of Belgrade.
	   But with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic _ who ordered the
police crackdown in Kosovo _ holding power in Serbia, the largest
of Yugoslavia's two republics, the mission has little more than
symbolic character, a fact recognized by the opposition leaders.
	   ``We have the possibility of proposing certain solutions, but we
do not have the influence to have those solutions implemented,''
said Djindjic before departure from Belgrade, capital of both
Serbia and Yugoslavia. In Pristina, they met with prominent ethnic
Albanian personalities Fehmi Agani, Veton Surroi and Blerim Shalla,
but no immediate details emerged from their talks.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed since February, when
Milosevic launched the crackdown on Albanian separatists who had
been attacking Serb police and military facilities.
	   In fighting Tuesday, the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug said three
Serbian policemen were wounded in attacks by militants in the
Decani region, close to the border with Albania. The three _ all
identified by name _ were expected to survive.
	   The ethnic Albanian Kosovo Information Center reported four
Kosovo Liberation Army fighters wounded in the latest fighting in
Stari Trg, a mine site just outside Kosovska Mitrovica, 35
kilometers (20 miles) northwest of Pristina. Five Albanian villages
were reportedly shelled.
	   The center reported additional fighting in the border area with
Albania, near Djakovica, saying Serb forces there also were
shelling Albanian villages.
	   The mission by the Serbian opposition comes ahead of a
potentially volatile period in Kosovo, with the leadership of the
Democratic League of Kosovo, the main ethnic Albanian party,
announcing that the first constituent session of the self-styled
Kosovo parliament would convene within a week.
	   The Serbian government does not recognize elections that chose
the parliament or made Ibrahim Rugova the president of Kosovo's
Albanians, 90 percent of the Serbian province's population. The
parliament, elected last March in an unofficial ballot, is
dominated by Rugova's party but has been boycotted by most other
Albanian parties.
	   The militant Kosovo Liberation Army, reportedly in control of
about 40 percent of Kosovo, has refused to heed any of the Albanian
political parties and are unlikely to recognize the authority of
either parliament or Rugova.
	   Earlier this month, other influential ethnic Albanian parties
proposed formation of an ethnic Albanian National Council, which
would include representatives from all parties and present a
unified Albanian body to encompass the KLA. But Rugova apparently
rejected the proposal.

Mount Merapi spews out heat clouds; warning status remains
</HEADLINE>
`caution' &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Mount Merapi spewed out heat clouds
sporadically Tuesday, but authorities left the warning status at
``caution'' for the volcano in Central Java.
	   An official at a monitoring post in Kaliurang said heat clouds
spread out from the volcano at least four times Tuesday, but there
were no casualties.
	   ``Its status is still at `caution' level,'' said the official,
who identified himself only as Panut.
	   Contacted by telephone, Panut said the peak of the 2,968-meter
(9,737-foot) Mount Merapi could not seen from his post because of
clouds and fog.
	   Kaliurang is a mountainous region near Yogyakarta, about 400
kilometers (250 miles) east of Jakarta.
	   Occasional clouds of gas have been reported at the mountain
since a loud explosion before dawn last Saturday, which sent gray
ash over a wide area.
	   The Saturday explosion and subsequent heat clouds damaged trees
on the volcano's slopes and vegetable patches in a nearby village.
	   Authorities then raised the status to ``alert'' until noon
Sunday. The alert has remained in effect for people and sand miners
living along rivers around the volcano.
	   Mount Merapi, near the border of Central Java and East Java, is
the most active of 500 Indonesia's volcanoes.
	   A sudden eruption in 1994 sent a steam cloud that flattened a
village on its slopes, killing 60 inhabitants and severely burning
others.
	   Its most destructive eruption this century killed 1,300 people
in 1930.

Spectator in critical condition after Tour de France accident
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CORK, Ireland (AP) _ An 11-year-old girl was in critical
condition Tuesday after being struck by a bicycle while watching
the Irish stage of the Tour de France.
	   Laura Seward was among a group of spectators hit by one of the
race competitors as cyclists sped through Youghal on Monday
afternoon.
	   She suffered serious head injuries and was airlifted to Cork's
University Hospital, where her condition was listed as critical.
	   The cyclist involved in the incident was not immediately
identified. It was believed that he did not realize the magnitude
of the accident and continued the stage on a replacement bicycle.
	   Irish police were investigating.
	   The girl was taken to the same hospital where British rider
Chris Boardman was treated for a broken wrist and facial injuries
after crashing Monday.
	   Boardman, who was wearing the leader's yellow jersey when he
crashed out of the race, said the incident involving the girl had
been a shock to everybody.
	   ``It is an attraction of the tour that the spectators can get so
close and be right next to the riders,'' he said. ``You can hear
them breathing. That's why they've avoided putting barriers up
along the route. The down side to that is, of course, that people
are not trained to watch bike races.''
	   The Tour de France was back in France on Tuesday after the
prologue and the first two stages in Ireland over the weekend.

Thailand delays bidding on new privatized power plants
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand will delay calling for bids on
new privatized power projects because of the country's economic
crisis, officials with state energy agencies said Tuesday.
	   The bidding, originally scheduled for 1997, will take place
sometime next year, said Viravat Chlayon, governor of the
Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand. He spoke at a seminar
on energy in Bangkok.
	   Piyasvasti Amranand, secretary-general of the National Energy
Policy Council, said in a paper presented at the seminar that the
bidding wouldn't be held until the end of 1999.
	   Due to the economic slowdown, Thailand had already scaled down
the specifications for the power projects, from an initially
planned 2,500 megawatts of new generating capacity to 1,900 mw,
with the projects due to come on stream around 2006 or 2007.
	   Peak demand from January to June this year was 14,200 mw, down 2
percent from the same period last year.
	   The two power agencies are jointly reviewing the amount of new
electricity needed as well as bidding procedures, Viravat said. In
previous bidding, the electricity authority awarded power projects
totaling 5,878 mw to seven international and domestic consortia.
	   Weak energy demand because of the recession has caused the
agency to delay purchases of electricity from several private
operators with which it had already negotiated contracts.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ Russian Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko arrived
in Beijing Tuesday to discuss boosting sagging trade and investing
in China's energy sector.
	   The five-hour stopover on his way home from Japan marked
Kiriyenko's first trip to Russia's powerful neighbor and former

	   Kiriyenko met Premier Zhu Rongji for talks on trade and other

Chinese companies to establish production lines in Russia. He
suggested they could set up in mining towns, ``where we have so
many available workers and not enough work.''
	   Verlin, the embassy spokesman, said Kiriyenko was on ``a working
visit to discuss problems with trade and to search for
breakthroughs, especially in the field of energy.''
	   The Russian prime minister and Zhu were to discuss projects to
pipe gas from eastern Siberia and build a nuclear power plant in
eastern China's Lianyungang, Verlin said.
	   Financing is believed to have been a problem for the projects.
Verlin noted that Kiriyenko is accompanied by Russia's ministers
for finance and atomic energy.
	   Scientific cooperation and measures to boost slackening trade _
by opening Chinese department stores in Moscow and other Russian
cities, for example _ also were to be discussed, Verlin said.
	   Russia and China have set a U.S. dlrs 20 billion target for
two-way trade by 2000. But commerce between them amounted to just
U.S. dlrs 6.12 billion in 1997, down 10 percent from the previous
year.
	   Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov will follow up with
further talks on a visit to China July 22-26, said Chinese Foreign
Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang.

Thousands driven from homes by fighting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Heavy fighting between rebels and
government troops in southern Sudan has driven thousands of people
from their villages into the remaining government-held towns in the
region, the U.N. food agency said Tuesday.
	   Both sides are targeting and raiding villages in southwestern
Bahr el Ghazal province, the World Food Program said.
	   The agency said an average of 2,500 people a day _ many severely
malnourished _ have poured into the provincial capital Wau. WFP
said it has registerd 50,000 people at its feeding center there
since May 1.
	   ``Some of the women and children are horrendously
malnourished,'' said Ismat Fahmi, WFP deputy representative in the
Sudanese capital, Khartoum. ``More and more we are hearing that
lack of food, disease and raids by armed men are big factors,
forcing entire communities to flee their villages in northern Bahr
el-Ghazal.''
	   WFP said on Tuesday it began to fly an addition 150 tons of
relief food a week into Wau, doubling the amount it has been
delivering since May 30.
	   At least 9,000 people have arrived in the government-held town
of Aweil, about 150 kilometers (93 miles) northwest of Wau, which
is engulfed by heavy fighting. All food has to be airdropped there,
a WFP statement said.
	   WFP staff have not been able to enter the area by road since the
beginning of the year due to heavy fighting. The organization is
now assessing whether relief workers can go to Aweil to set up
delivery points and receive supplies.
	   Fighting has disrupted efforts to feed thousands of malnourished
people in the region, and teams of aid workers have been repeatedly
forced to abandon their sites and leave food behind because of
fighting.
	   Other relief agencies speak of a mounting death toll as
war-and-drought-induced famine has worsened in recent months and it
has been difficult or impossible to deliver food in adqeduate
amounts where it is needed.
	   Rebels of the Sudan People's Liberation Army have been fighting
since 1983 for autonomy for the Christian and animist south from
the Arab and Muslim north.
	   An estimated 1.5 million people have died in the fighting and
accompanying famine.
	   An earlier civil war that began shortly after Sudan's
independence from Britain in 1956 ended inconclusively in 1972.
	   Relief agencies are concerned about lack of international
response to their appeals for funds.

Mahathir: Going to IMF would worsen economic crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Although Malaysia's economy is
heading into recession, seeking help from the International
Monetary Fund would only worsen the crisis, Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad said Tuesday.
	   ``What we really see is that when the other countries sought IMF
assistance, the situation became worse,'' Mahathir said in an
interview broadcast over national radio and television.
	   It was his first detailed comment since Monday's government
forecast that the economy would contract by up to 2 percent in
1998.
	   Currencies in Indonesia and South Korea fell sharply after they
signed up for IMF bailout packages, he said.
	   ``That is why we do not see any reason to seek the help of the
IMF because it cannot guarantee the strength of our ringgit,'' the
Malaysian currency, Mahathir added.
	   But he said Malaysia would have to borrow overseas to pay for
its development and finance its budget deficit.
	   ``We don't have any other way except to borrow,'' he said.
	   If the treasury prints more money, it would push the ringgit
lower, he said. The currency has lost nearly 40 percent of its
value against the dollar in one year.
	   Mahathir has consistently maintained that IMF prescriptions
don't work. Of late, many independent analysts and U.S.-based
economists also have said that high interest rates and tight
monetary policies suggested by the IMF for Asian nations would
impede recovery.
	   Banks were refusing to reduce interest rates and lend more money
to companies that were struggling to cope with depressed demand and
falling production, Mahathir said.
	   ``Yes, we are trying to discuss with the banks and advise them
to give out more loans,'' he said.
	   ``If we can't order the banks, our objectives would not be
fulfilled. But if we continue to direct the banks, we'll be
criticized. Not only that, sometimes our currency will be further
devalued.''
	   Mahathir exhorted Malaysians to rally behind the government.
	   ``Thank Allah, in Malaysia, the Chinese, Malays, Indians,
Kadazans, Muruts Bajaus, all support the government. This gives us
the courage, for example, to reject proposals that we accept help
from the IMF.''
	   Sixty percent of Malaysians are Malays. The Chinese are the
largest minority, followed by the Indians and other smaller groups.

Three arrested on suspicion of killing St. Petersburg official
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Police in Kyrgyzstan detained three men on
suspicion of being involved in the killing of a St. Petersburg
official last year, a news agency reported Tuesday.
	   The three unidentified men are suspected by the Russian Federal
Security Service of being involved in a number of contract killings
in Russia from 1993 to 1997, the Interfax news agency said.
	   One of those killed was Mikhail Manevich, the deputy governor of
the Leningrad region and St. Petersburg's privatization chief. He
was shot to death by a sniper who fired eight bullets into his car.
The sniper escaped.
	   Two of the three suspects were Kyrgyz by birth, and the FSB
search for them focused on the Fergana Valley in southern
Kyrgyzstan, Interfax said. A fourth suspect was detained several
days earlier, the report said.
	   All of the suspects were detained by officers of the FSB
Anti-terrorist Center and will be brought to Moscow, Interfax said.

Gucci's ex-wife says she was obsessed with killing him, but never
</HEADLINE>
carried out plan &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ The ex-wife of slain fashion heir Maurizio
Gucci testified Tuesday that she tried to find someone to kill him,
but never carried out the plan.
	   Patrizia Reggiani Martinelli is on trial for Gucci's 1995 murder
along with four other alleged co-conspirators. Three have
confessed; only Reggiani Martinelli and the alleged triggerman say
they are innocent.
	   On Tuesday, she admitted repeatedly asking those around her,
including her servants, to find someone to kill Gucci. But she
denied telling her friend and psychic, Pina Auriemma, to go through
with it.
	   Auriemma has testified that she served as an intermediary
between Reggiani Martinelli and the people who carried out the
killing. Gucci was gunned down on his office steps on March 27,
1995.
	   Reggiani Martinelli testified that her anger and resentment at
Gucci, who left her in 1985, grew into an obsession. She even
discussed killing him with her attorney, she said.
	   ``Instead of saying hello, I'd say haven't you found someone to
kill my husband yet?'' she said.
	   The once-glamorous Reggiani Martinelli appeared in court without
make-up and with her dark hair pulled into a soft bun.
Self-possessed and calm, she answered prosecutors evenly.
	   Court-appointed psychologists watched her attentively, taking
notes. Reggiani Martinelli's defense is expected to hinge on a
court-ordered psychiatric evaluation to be presented in October.
	   Her lawyers claim that a 1992 brain tumor operation left her
unable to reason well enough to carry out a murder plot. They say
Auriemma and the other defendants killed Gucci on their own, then
blackmailed Reggiani Martinelli.

New interior minister sacks police chiefs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Interior Minister Sandor Pinter on
Tuesday fired three top police officials, including one appointed
to the post he was forced out of earlier under the previous
government.
	   Sacked were National Police Chief Laszlo Forgacs, and two top
deputies. Pinter had been Forgacs's predecessor until he was fired
by the previous Socialist government for alleged incompetence in
fighting organized crime.
	   Pinter was appointed interior minister by Premier Viktor Orban
whose center-right Cabinet was sworn into office last week, Orban
has identified combating organized crime as one of his priorities.
	   There have been over 140 bombing incidents in the country in the
past seven years. The most recent, in downtown Budapest July 2,
killed four people and injured 25.

Belgrade court calls for investigation against Sakic's wife
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A Belgrade court has called for an
investigation of suspected genocide against the wife of Dinko
Sakic, the commander of a Croat World War II concentration camp
currently on trial in Croatia.
	   Nada Luburic-Sakic, who lives in Argentina, is believed to have
run a female camp in Jasenovac, where tens of thousands of Serbs,
Jews, Gypsies and Croat insurgents were killed by Croatia's
pro-Nazi regime.
	   Sakic, now in Zagreb's main prison, fled Croatia in 1945 when
its wartime Nazi puppet state was defeated. He lived quietly in
Argentina until April this year when he acknowledged in an
interview that he ran Jasenovac. His wife Nada remained in
Argentina following Sakic's arrest.
	   Nazi hunter Efraim Zuroff, whose efforts led to Sakic's arrest
and extradition, has asked the Argentine government to arrest and
extradite Nada Sakic on suspicion of war crimes.
	   Belgrade's Politika daily said there is evidence indicating that
Nada Sakic committed acts of genocide when running the camp.
	   Sakic and his wife have claimed ``nothing happened'' in
Jasenovac and that detainees were dying of natural causes, which
outraged survivors and prompted his extradition to Croatia.

Funeral for Northern Ireland's three brothers, victims of hatred
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to raise material from funeral &QL; 
 &UR; By KRISTIN GAZLAY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BALLYMONEY, Northern Ireland (AP) _ As the small coffins of
three young brothers lay before the altar of a Catholic church
Tuesday, their aunt reduced mourners to tears when she asked why
anyone would want to kill them. ``Who would have such evil at their
fingertips?''
	   Richard, Mark and Jason Quinn, whose mother is Catholic but who
had been raised as Protestants, died in a sectarian firebomb
attack, victims of a war of hatred in Northern Ireland.
	   Their deaths Sunday night shocked a province all too accustomed
to dying and led to serious soul-searching about the future of its
shaky peace. But their funeral focused a global spotlight on the
emotional distress and devastation that more than 20 years of
violence have wrought on individual families.
	   In a strong voice, the boys' aunt, Amanda Ramsey, read a poem
she wrote with two other people called ``Little Lips.''
	   ``Why would someone do this is a question on our lips? ...
Richard, Mark and Jason in our memory you will stay. I can still
feel the cold, wet lips from when I kissed you and you were on your
way,'' she read. ``...Please let the evil people be brought to
justice soon.''
	   The packed congregation at the Roman Catholic Church of Our Lady
and St. Patrick wept and burst into spontaneous applause at its
close.
	   It was a day of tears for what The Most Rev. Patrick Walsh,
Bishop of Down and Connor, called ``the saddest of sad funerals.''
	   When the boys' coffins were carried from their grandmother's
bungalow in Rasharkin, about 7 miles (12 kms) away, for the last
time, many relatives, friends and neighbors sobbed. Their mother,
Chrissie Quinn, 29, had to be supported at times. Her close friend
John Dillon wept and stroked the coffin he carried to the hearse,
where the brothers were laid side by side.
	   And when the 90 minute funeral service ended, and the boys'
coffins were returned to the hearse for their final journey to
Rasharkin for burial, there wasn't a dry eye in the huge crowd
standing silently outside.
	   Pictures of the boys in happier times lay on top of the white
coffins with brass nameplates and crosses.
	   Half a dozen floral tributes rested against the church's stone
wall. One card read: ``Sleep in peace little angels.''
	   Tensions spilling over from a blocked Protestant march outside a
rural church near Portadown were blamed for the early Sunday
morning firebombing of the Quinn house. Police said they believed
the family was targeted because Chrissie Quinn lived there with her
Protestant boyfriend.
	   Two men were being questioned, police said.

Thai government to sell sugar factories to liquor tycoon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's Cabinet on Tuesday approved
the sale of three loss-making state-owned sugar factories to a
company owned by the country's top liquor tycoon.
	   Chonburi Sugar Factory, owned by Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi, one
of Thailand's richest and most influential businessmen, was the
only company to bid on the factories, said Thien Mekanontchai,
director-general of the Department of Industrial Works.
	   The total sales price for the three state factories, in
Suphanburi, Lampang and Uttaradit provinces, is 620 million baht
(dlrs 15.1 million).
	   But the industry ministry, the factories' owner, remains
responsible for existing debts totaling about 550 million to 600
million baht (dlrs 13.4-dlrs 14.6 million), Thien said.
	   The ministry sought to sell the mills because they run an annual
combined loss of 50 million to 100 million baht (dlrs 1.2-dlrs 2.4
million).

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Georgia rejected on Tuesday a top
Russian general's accusation that the republic's supporters were
involved in a mine blast that killed five Russian peacekeepers and
left three wounded.
	   The powerful landmine exploded on Sunday while Russian troops
were looking for mines on a road in Georgia's breakaway Abkhazia
region.
	   Gen. Sergei Korobko, top commander of the Russian peacekeeping
troops in the area, said the mine was set off by the White Legion,
a militia that supports Georgia's central government and often
clashes with the separatists in Abkhazia.
	   The White Legion has accused the Russian peacekeepers of siding
with the rebels and has frequently threatened to attack the Russian
forces. Still, White Legion leaders denied responsibility for the
attack.
	   Georgia's Ministry of Defense dismissed Korobko's claim. ``We
are surprised that Gen. Korobko accuses the Georgian side of this
terrorist act without any reason.''
	   ``The (Russian) peacekeepers bear the entire responsibility for
what is going on in the zone.''
	   The Russian Foreign Ministry said Tuesday it may withdraw all
Russian peacekeeping forces from Abkhazia if attacks on the troops
continue, the Interfax news agency said.
	   Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin reiterated Russia's belief
that Georgian supporters set off the explosion. ``We demand
effective measures to put a stop to the terrorist activities of the
White Legion,'' he said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Russia deployed peacekeepers in the Black Sea province of
Abkhazia in 1994 to separate Georgian government troops and
Abkhazian separatist forces following a war. The region is still in
turmoil, and a political settlement is not expected soon.

Asian Development bank ready to expand in crisis-ridden Indonesia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The Asian Development Bank is prepared
to expand its lending to crisis-ridden Indonesia, its program
director Shoji Nishimoto said Tuesday.
	   ``Indonesia has been the largest client and borrower of the
ADB,'' he told journalists, adding that the bank wasn't under the
same constraints as commercial financial institutions.
	   ``The ADB isn't a commercial bank, so we shouldn't let Indonesia
fall,'' he said.
	   Indonesia is currently enduring its worst economic crisis in 30
years. The currency, the rupiah, has lost about 80 percent of its
value. Inflation, bankruptcies and unemployment are all soaring.
	   ADB is backing a dlrs 43 billion rescue package put together by
the International Monetary Fund.
	   Responding to questions on whether the ADB would also contribute
up to dlrs 6 billion in international lending required to plug a
gap in Indonesia's 1998 budget, Nishimoto said the ADB was ``quite
prepared to expand'' loans to Indonesia.
	   Nishimoto was speaking at a press conference to announce the

American player found guilty of doping offense but escapes

suspension &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ American teen-ager Samantha Reeves has been found
guilty of a doping offense but will not be sanctioned because she
took steroids unwittingly, the International Tennis Federation said
Tuesday.
	   In what is believed to be the first doping case in women's
tennis, the ITF said Reeves, 19, of Monona, Wisc., tested positive
for traces of nandrolone metabolites in an out-of-competition test
in December 1997.
	   Nandrolone is considered a ``Class 1'' banned substance, a
performance-enhancing anabolic steroid whose use would normally
result in a long ban.
	   The ITF appeals committee, meeting in London on July 5, ruled
that Reeves was guilty of a doping offense but cited ``exceptional
circumstances'' for not imposing any sanctions.
	   The ITF said Reeves never disputed that the banned substances
were found in her sample, and that she acted in ``good faith'' in
taking a product which she believed was for weight loss.
	   ``Had she known or suspected that the product had anobolic
characteristics, she would not have taken it,'' the statement said.
	   ``The Appeals Committee concludes that Ms. Reeves was naive and
immature at the time of the offense, being 18 years old and having
just joined the professuional circuit as an amateur.
	   ``The Appeals Committee were satisfied that it would therefore
be harsh to consider her actions unreasonable in the light of her
exceptional circumstances.''
	   The ITF said the finding of a doping offense ``is a sanction in
itself, since the matter, while pending, has had emotional and
financial consequences for Ms. Reeves.''
	   The ITF stressed that players should seek expert advice before
taking any medical products and said Reeves could face a life ban
for a second offense.
	   Reeves, currently ranked No. 133 in the world, has retained her
amateur status while playing on the WTA Tour. She has played in all
three Grand Slam tournaments so far this year, losing in the first
round at the Australian Open, French Open and Wimbledon.
	   Reeves was ranked No. 1 in the U.S. 18-and-under division in
1996 and played on the USTA circuit in 1997.

Funeral for Northern Ireland's three brothers, victims of hatred
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS text of poem in graf 1 and 5, and time of murders in
graf 3 to Sunday morning &QL; 
 &UR; By KRISTIN GAZLAY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BALLYMONEY, Northern Ireland (AP) _ As the small coffins of
three young brothers lay before the altar of a Catholic church
Tuesday, their aunt reduced mourners to tears when she asked why
anyone would want to kill them. ``Who would have so much evil at
their fingertips?''
	   Richard, Mark and Jason Quinn, whose mother is Catholic but who
had been raised as Protestants, died in a sectarian firebomb
attack, victims of a war of hatred in Northern Ireland.
	   Their deaths Sunday morning shocked a province all too
accustomed to dying and led to serious soul-searching about the
future of its shaky peace. But their funeral focused a global
spotlight on the emotional distress and devastation that more than
20 years of violence have wrought on individual families.
	   In a strong voice, the boys' aunt, Amanda Ramsey, read a poem
she wrote with two other people called ``Little Lips.''
	   ``Why would someone do this is the question on our lips? ...
Richard, Mark and Jason in our memory you will stay. I can still
feel the cold, wet lips from when I kissed you and you were on your
way,'' she read. ``...Please let the evil people be brought to
justice soon.''

Japan gives wartime forced laborers 18-yen pension
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Two Korean women forced to work in a Japanese
factory during World War II finally got their pensions from the
government Tuesday: 18 yen (12 cents) apiece.
	   Yang Chun-ki and Kwon Byong-suk, both 68, were forced to work at
machine tool maker Nachi-Fujikoshi Corp. in Toyama in northeastern
Japan during the war, Kyodo News agency reported.
	   The Toyama Social Insurance Agency office calculated the amount
according to a pension law that stipulates that payment on quitting
the system will be the equivalent of 15 days' wages, the report
said.
	   Since the monthly wage at the time was 36 yen (now 25 cents),
and the daily pay can be calculated to be 1.20 yen (0.8 cent), the
office paid 18 yen (12 cents), officials at the agency office were
quoted as saying.
	   Officials could not be reached late Tuesday for comment.
	   Hiroshi Yamada, a lawyer representing the women, was quoted as
saying the government deserves credit for making the payment after
half a century _ but he said the amount should have been more in
line with current prices.
	   The amount would be enough to pay the sales tax on a moderately
priced cup of coffee.
	   In 1941, 18 yen would have been equivalent to about dlrs 4.20.
	   In 1996, the Toyama District Court rejected a damages suit filed
against Nachi-Fujikoshi by three other South Korea women who served
as forced laborers. The court ruled the statute of limitations had
expired.
	   Insurance money, of a meager amount, has also been paid to South
Koreans who were former conscript laborers in Nagasaki and
Hiroshima.
	   Japan ruled the Korean Peninsula from 1910 to 1945, and forced
an estimated 1.2 million Koreans to work in Japanese factories to
offset a labor shortage.

Mazda recalls Familia in Japan over fuel-connector problem
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Mazda Motor Corp. said Tuesday it has started
recalling 8,460 of its remodeled Familia cars in Japan to repair a
fuel-connector defect that could cause a fire.
	   Of the vehicles recalled, 4,645 are sedans and 3,815 are wagons,
a Mazda spokeswoman said.
	   Mazda started sales of remodeled Familia cars in late June in
Japan. It hasn't started selling the models overseas yet.
	   The company has no estimate of the cost of the recall, but it
isn't expected to have a major impact on Mazda's earnings because
it only requires inspection and replacement of a small part, the
spokeswoman said.
	   Mazda is 33.4 percent owned by Ford Motor Co. of the United
States.

	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Italian President Oscar
Luigi Scalfaro arrived on Tuesday for meetings with political
leaders and Italian troops serving in the NATO-led peace force.
	   He met with the three members of the joint presidency, Alija
Izetbegovic, Kresimir Zubak and Momcilo Krajisnik and discussed
issues related to the peace process and the ``path
Bosnia-Herzegovina is taking, which is not an easy path,'' the
Italian President said after the meeting.
	   The main focus of the talks was the return of refugees, the
reconstruction of refugee homes and their safety.
	   Izetbegovic said that reconstruction of the country together is
making significant progress and recalled Italy's involvement
beginning in the first days of the Bosnian crisis.
	   Izetbegovic's Croat colleague Kresimir Zubak said the crisis in
neighboring Kosovo should not shift all the world's attention from
Bosnia.
	   Times have come in which the people of Bosnia have to work
together toward equality of all nations, said Bosnian Serb
presidency member Momcilo Krajisnik. ``We are no longer enemies,
the war was over a long time ago,'' he said.
	   Italy currently contributes some 2,200 troops to the
33,000-strong international effort to keep peace in Bosnia.

Ruling party hints it might take action against Madikizela-Mandela
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ The ruling African National
Congress hinted Tuesday it may expel Winnie Madikizela-Mandela from
a key party committee.
	   Madikizela-Mandela, who was divorced from President Nelson
Mandela in 1996, recently complained in a letter to the ANC about
an alleged campaign to harass her and threatened to quit the
party's National Executive Committee.
	   Kgalema Motlanthe, the ANC secretary-general, said Tuesday that
a committee of three National Executive Committee members would
discuss her future on the ANC's National Working Committee in light
of her recent absenteeism.
	   He said the committee also would discuss matters raised in
Madikizela-Mandela's letter that accused Sport and recreation
Minister Steve Tshwete of being part of a campaign to harass her.
	   The Star, a Johannesburg daily, reported Tuesday that the Party
had warned Madikizela-Mandela, the president of the ANC Women's
League and a heroine of the anti-apartheid struggle, to drop her
planned legal action against Tshwete or face party disciplinary
action.
	   In an interview in The Star last year, Madikizela-Mandela
accused the ANC of reneging on its election promises.
	   In a reply on behalf of the party, Tshwete accused her of being
a ``wayward charlatan'' and an ``armchair populist.''
	   Madikizela-Mandela has said she will sue Tshwete because of the
remarks.

China: No pledge to Israel not to sell nuclear technology to Iran
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITS to fix slug &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ China never promised Israel that it would
not sell nuclear technology to Iran, a Chinese minister said in
remarks published Tuesday.
	   In any case, China abides by the treaties that control arms
sales ``therefore there is no need'' to make such promises, Chinese
Assistant Foreign Minister Ji Peiding was quoted as saying by
Egypt's newspaper Al-Ahram.
	   In an interview with Al-Ahram, Ji denied a statement by Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he had received an
``absolute commitment'' from Chinese leaders that they have not
provided Iran with nuclear weapons technology and would not do so
in the future.
	   The reported commitment covered biological, chemical and nuclear
weapons as well as surface-to-surface missiles.
	   Netanyahu made the statement after his May visit to China.
	   Ji said China's cooperation with Iran ``in the peaceful use of
nuclear technology has stopped because of a lack of funding.'' He
did elaborate or explain the extent of the nuclear cooperation with
Iran.
	   Ji said that Netanyahu had explained to Chinese officials that
his government was worried that Iran, which opposes the existence
of Israel, could attack the Jewish state.
	   According to Israel's Haaretz newspaper, China supplied Iran in
March with nearly 1,000 tons of high-quality steel, which was
apparently intended for ballistic missiles. The transaction ranked
high on Netanyahu's agenda during his meetings with Chinese
leaders.
	   Asked why China never commented on Netanyahu's statement
earlier, Ji said ``Netanyahu is a politician who was addressing his
constituency (in Israel) and that is all I can say.''
	   ``I repeat we do not have to pledge to stop cooperation with
Arab states and Iran because it is of a kind that does not go
overboard (into nuclear technology),'' Ji said.

Author sends support message to Colombian peace talks in Germany
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IAN MADER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Nobel prize-winning Colombian author
Gabriel Garcia Marquez sent a supportive message Tuesday to civic
leaders holding preliminary peace talks in Germany with Colombia's
second-largest rebel group.
	   ``Everything depends on what happens'' in Germany, Garcia
Marquez said in a statement from Mexico to the Colombian civic
delegation meeting with representatives of the National Liberation
Army, or ELN.
	   ``This is our historical responsibility at the doors of the next
millennium,'' said Garcia Marquez, who because of health reasons
declined to help mediate the talks. ``We are in your hands. Thank
you and good luck.''
	   Since Sunday, rebels and Colombian delegates have been
sequestered in a cloister in the southern state of Bavaria for
meetings aimed at arranging direct talks with president-elect
Andres Pastrana.
	   The ELN talks _ combined with Pastrana's overtures toward
Colombia's largest rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, or FARC _ have raised hopes of an end to Colombia's
34-year civil war.
	   Pastrana, who takes office Aug. 7, was traveling this week in
France. Colombia's El Espectador newspaper reported Tuesday that he
may seek to meet with the ELN in Europe after talks wind up in
Germany.
	   Colombian delegates _ from industry, labor, social agencies and
the Roman Catholic church _ were meeting with rebels at the
Himmelspforten cloister in the town of Wuerzburg, on the Main
river.
	   In Mainz, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's chief aide for security and
intelligence, Bernd Schmidbauer, met with Colombian Environment
Minister Eduardo Verano. Colombian ministry sources, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said the talks dealt with how to stop the
ELN rebels from bombing Colombian oil pipelines.
	   The three-day talks are closed at the insistence of Germany's
Roman Catholic Bishops' Conference, which helped coordinate the
meetings. Journalists have been turned away from the cloister's
walled compound.
	   In a statement Tuesday, the church said Monday that rebels and
delegates broke into small groups to discuss the causes of
Colombia's conflict and potential solutions. The talks are taking
place in ``an atmosphere of honesty, transparency and clarity, but
most of all of cordiality,'' the statement said.
	   The church has scheduled a news conference Wednesday in Mainz,
40 kilometers (25 miles) southwest of Frankfurt.
	   The 5,000-member ELN has sought to stop what it calls foreign
exploitation of Colombia's natural resources and often attacks oil
pipelines and kidnaps industry executives.
	   Based mainly in Colombia's northeast oil-producing regions, the
ELN is less active militarily than the 15,000-member FARC and is
considered more likely to disarm in return for political
concessions.

Palestinians: Security Council action on Jerusalem falls short
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A U.N. Security Council statement criticizing
Israel for seeking to expand Jerusalem's boundaries falls short of
expectations and will not deter Israel from going through with the
plan, a Palestinian Cabinet minister said Tuesday.
	   Israel's Foreign Ministry said in a statement it regretted
Monday's decision by the Security Council. The ministry said the
Jerusalem plan, adopted June 21, was municipal in nature and did
not violate the Israeli-Palestinian peace agreements.
	   The Palestinians had hoped the 15-member council would adopt a
binding resolution condemning Israel. However, the United States
likely would have vetoed such a resolution.
	   In a compromise, the council instead approved a statement that
calls Israel's Jerusalem plan ``a serious and damaging
development.'' It also calls on Israel not to proceed with the
move.
	   Under the Israeli proposal, the municipal boundaries of
Jerusalem would be expanded to include suburbs to the west, in
Israel proper. Jerusalem municipal authority would also be extended
to several Jewish West Bank settlements adjacent to the city.
	   Palestinian Higher Education Minister Hanan Ashrawi said Tuesday
she would have preferred a resolution, even at the risk of inviting
a U.S. veto, over a diluted compromise.
	   ``It is unfortunate that once again the United States has
deflected the work of the Security Council to dilute its position
and come up with a non-binding statement,'' Ashrawi said.
	   The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Bill Richardson, has
called the Security Council statement appropriate and said it sends
the message of support for the Middle East peace process.

23 killed, 6 injured in Iran road accident
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A road accident in northeastern Iran left 23
people dead and five injured, the official Islamic Republic News
Agency reported Tuesday.
	   It said a car, a van and a tanker truck were involved in the
accident late Monday on a road linking the city of Mashhad with the
town of Chenaran in the province of Khorasan.
	   The agency did not elaborate and it was not clear if the three
vehicles collided or hit other objects along the highway or
overturned after going off the road. IRNA only said the car driver
caused the accident by leaving his lane.
	   Six people in the car and van were instantly killed, and 17 who
were critically injured died on the way to the hospital, IRNA said.
	   It reported that the driver of the tanker truck was discharged
from the hospital, but did not say how badly the others were
injured.
	   Mashhad is 900 kilometers (560 miles) northeast of the capital,
Tehran.

Turkish military court convicts pro-Islamic journalist
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ A Turkish military court sentenced a
journalist to 14 months in prison on Tuesday for saying the
military was recruiting members of a pro-secular Muslim sect.
	   Yasar Kaplan was convicted of undermining military hierarchy and
attempting to destroy trust in commanders for three articles in
pro-Islamic Akit newspaper last February.
	   The articles said the military was trying to increase the
influence of the Alawite sect in the armed forces. The Alawites are
seen as supporters of Turkey's secular system.
	   Turkey's military sees itself as the guardian of the country's
secular system.
	   Although a number of Turkish journalists have been imprisoned
for their writings, convictions by a military court are rare.
	   Military courts in Turkey can try civilians accused of violating
military laws.

Small arms conference drafts plan for combating spread of weapons
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG MELLGREN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ International control of military small arms
must be tightened to stop the weapons from flowing into hands of
criminals and terrorists, said a 21-nation congress that concluded
Tuesday with proposals for better control.
	   The congress, whose participants ranged the wealthy and stable
to the poor and troubled, did not release a text of its proposals.
The proposals are subject to the approval of their governments.
	   A summary released at the end of the closed-door meeting said
the countries agreed that ``the uncontrolled used of these weapons
causes untold human suffering.'' They also said a first step is
preventing the illegal transfer of weapons, often left over from
civil wars or in surplus stockpiles from the Cold War.
	   They recommended improved international control and information
about the manufacture and sales of light weapons; stronger laws and
police cooperation against illicit trafficking; and helping
countries dispose of stockpiles at the end of an armed conflict.
	   ``The goal for such a process must be _ in a very overall way _
that people someday won't feel threatened in their daily lives by
small arms,'' said Norway's deputy foreign minister Aslaug Haga at
the end of the meeting. ``We are talking about military-type
weapons that can be operated by one person, that are easily sold
and flow easily over borders.''
	   The United Nations estimates that 90 percent of those killed or
wounded by light military weapons are civilians, 80 percent of them
children. Often the weapons fall into the hands of terrorists, drug
cartels and even renegade soldiers. Some experts say half of the
world's small arms transfers are illegal.
	   ``We certainly regard the meeting as a success,'' the head of
the U.S. delegation, Joseph Smaldone, said. ``To my knowledge, this
is the first meeting of governments of this variety to deal with
the whole range of small arms issues.''
	   The countries ranged from major Western powers to African
countries recovering from civil wars and Latin American nations
that struggle with drug-related violence.
	   However, key arms producers, including Russia, Israel and China,
were missing.
	   ```We are early in the process,'' Haga explained at a news
conference. ``The countries invited to this congress were ones that
have shown an active interest so far in the process.''
	   She said the Oslo meeting will be followed up by other sessions
leading up to a global small arms conference in Switzerland in 2000
or 2001.
	   Norway was among a handful of countries that began a drive to
ban anti-personnel mines in 1996. That effort snowballed into a
global movement, and a total ban on the weapons negotiated in Oslo
last year.
	   ``The land mine process was extremely complicated. I think it
would be right to say that this process is probably even more
complicated,'' she said. ``It is essential that we have very many
countries involved because the weapons moved across absolutely all
borders.''
	   Other countries at the talks were Canada, Britain, France,
Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, Brazil,
Mexico, Colombia, Indonesia, Japan, the Philippines, Burkina Faso,
Mali, Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe.

	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ On the eve of a visit to Lithuania,
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said his country supports
quick EU membership for the three Baltic states.
	   ``Finland, which has very close cooperation with the Baltic

possible. That is our aim too,'' Kinkel told a news conference
Tuesday.
	   Kinkel, on a brief visit to Finland, was due to meet the prime
ministers of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania in the Lithuanian
coastal town of Nida on Wednesday.
	   He discussed EU expansion and security questions with Finland's
Foreign Minister Tarja Halonen, as well as the transfer of the EU
presidency from Austria to Germany in January and to Finland in
July 1999.
	   When Germany takes over the EU presidency in January, it will
continue the process of EU expansion and agricultural reform,
Kinkel said, adding that even though Germany is the largest EU
country, it does not need more power within the 15-member bloc.
	   He also said that Russia should be more closely tied to the
European Union.

Report: Red Wings coach faces more heart tests
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DETROIT (AP) _ Red Wings coach Scotty Bowman faces more
cardiovascular tests following abnormal results of a stress test
last week, a television station reported.
	   The 64-year-old coach of the Stanley Cup champions said Monday
he wouldn't be back ``unless my health is 100 percent.''
	   Further tests this week will try to determine if Bowman has
blocked arteries, Detroit television station WXYZ reported Monday
night.
	   Calls to Red Wings offices were not answered Monday night.
	   Bowman's brother Jack, a scout with the Buffalo Sabres, died
last month from heart problems at 59.
	   ``I underwent the toughest set of medical tests I ever
experienced,'' Bowman told the Toronto Star, ``and now we'll
discuss the results, exactly where I'm at.''
	   Bowman said he would leave a decision on retirement up to his
doctor.
	   ``I know my wife wants me to quit, but I also know she'll
support whatever the verdict is,'' Bowman said. ``We've agreed to
abide by what the doctor says.''
	   Bowman coached Detroit to a second straight Stanley Cup
championship last month, the eighth of his career.

Boardman released from hospital
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CORK, Ireland (AP) _ Chris Boardman was released from Cork's
University Hospital on Tuesday, one day after suffering a
concussion and other injuries in a crash during the Tour de France.
	   The 29-year-old British cyclist held the leader's yellow jersey
after the first two days of the tour, which started Saturday in
Dublin.
	   But the 1992 Olympic pursuit champion crashed out during the
127.7-mile second stage from Enniscorthy to Cork.
	   Boardman clipped wheels with another rider and crashed heavily
into a stone wall near Youghal, 30 miles (48 kms) from Cork.
	   He was knocked unconscious and rushed to Cork's University
Hospital, where he was treated overnight for concussion, bruising
and cuts. Doctors originally reported he had a broken wrist but
later said there were no broken bones.
	   Boardman, who has crashed out of three of the last four Tours de
France, could not remember a thing about the crash but said he was
lucky he was wearing a helmet.
	   ``It's a shame to go out of the tour like that, but it's a
matter of getting on with things now,'' he said. ``I haven't got a
clue what happened. I remember riding cross winds, and the next
thing I remember is waking up and looking at the ceiling of the
ambulance.''
	   Boardman said he had no objections to helmets being made
compulsory equipment on the Tour.
	   ``If I was unconscious with a helmet, then I don't like to think
what would have happened if I had not been wearing one,'' he said.
``Yesterday was a real lesson for me.''
	   Hospital consultant Stephen Cusack said Boardman had some
``nasty'' abrasions but it appeared the safety equipment he was
wearing took the brunt of the impact.
	   It is the fourth time in the last five years he has been forced
to abandon the Tour de France.
	   In 1994 he quit his first Tour with fatigue after a week of
racing. In 1995 he crashed in the opening time trial stage in
Brittany and smashed an ankle bone.
	   He finished the Tour in 1996 but crashed on a mountain descent
last year, injuring his back and forcing him to retire at later
stage.

German official defends decision not to hire Muslim teacher over
</HEADLINE>
scarf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Federal education minister Juergen
Ruettgers defended Tuesday a state official's refusal to hire a
Muslim teacher because she insists on wearing a traditional
headscarf.
	   In order to integrate foreign children into the German education
system, he said, the state needs partners ``who accept the basics
of the constitution: human rights, separation of powers and
tolerance.''
	   Requiring women to wear a scarf is ``a religious demand that
goes against the constitution's call for tolerance,'' he said.
	   Fereshta Ludin, a 25-year-old German citizen of Afghan heritage,
successfully completed an internship this year teaching English and
social studies at a secondary school in Pluederhausen, near
Stuttgart.
	   But the culture and education minister in southern
Baden-Wuerttembuerg state, Annette Schavan, refused Monday to hire
Ludin as a teacher because she insisted on wearing a headscarf in
the classroom.
	   The minister says the scarf is political and is ``understood as
a symbol of the exclusion of woman from civil and cultural
society.''
	   But Protestant Bishop Ulrich Fischer released an open letter
Tuesday criticizing the decision as an unjustified impingement on
the teacher's religious freedom.
	   School officials and students also protested. ``I don't like
losing my colleagues,'' said principal Peter Skobowsky, who praised
her work and relationship with the students.
	   Jogoda Kolinger, whose 13-year-old daughter was one of Ludin's
students, appreciated Ludin's conservative dress. ``Many of (the
teachers) come here with mini-skirts, so the headscarf certainly
doesn't bother me,'' she said.
	   Ludin could not be reached for comment Tuesday.

Finance Minister reassures Kenyan Indians of vital economic role
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Kenyans of Indian origin have a major role
to play in boosting the manufacturing sector in the East African
nation to rival the importance of agriculture, Finance Minister
Simeon Nyache said Tuesday.
	   ``Kenyans of Indian origin will continue to play a significant
role in this process,'' Nyache told a one-day seminar on relations
between Kenya and India into the 21st century. He earlier
emphasized the ``tremendous'' role Kenyan Indians have played in
making manufacturing account for 14 percent of Kenya's gross
domestic product.
	   Agriculture currently accounts for 30 percent of Kenya's GDP.
	   Nyache's assertion that ``Kenya will continue to remain a
multi-ethnic society'' appeared intended to reassure Kenyan's
estimated 70,000 citizens of Indian origin of their place in
society at a time of mounting complaints from Kenyan Africans about
questionable business deals and practices involving Kenyan Indians
and Indians.
	   Indian External Affairs Ministry official Pavan Varma said
another 30,000 Indians living in Kenya hold British passports.
	   Indian-owned shops and businesses have often been the targets of
rioting that has followed political demonstrations.
	   Over the past five years, Indians born in neighboring Uganda
have begun to trickle back at the invitation of President Yoweri
Museveni. In 1972, in a widely popular move, dictator Idi Amin Dada
expelled the entire community of 70,000. The Ugandan economy then
collapsed.
	   While bi-lateral trade between Kenya and India grew by more than
350 percent on both sides from 1992-97 after both countries began
to open up their closed economies, India holds a 5.3 billion
shilling (dlrs 88 million) surplus, Nyache said.
	   Foreign Minister Boyana Godana said he hoped the seminar would
come up with ways of correcting the imbalance.
	   Amit Mitra, secretary-general of the Indian branch of the
International Federation of Chambers of Commerce, suggested, among
other things, Indian investment in Kenyan agro-processing and joint
ventures like software training institutions in which India has
excelled.
	   There are about 5,000 Kenyans pursuing higher education in
India.

Fighters beat BlueWave 10-5
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Katsuhiro Nishiura went 4-for-4 and drove in five
runs with two homers as the Pacific League's front-running Nippon
Ham Fighters trounced the Orix BlueWave 10-5 at Tokyo Dome Tuesday.
	   The Fighters jumped to a 4-0 lead in the first inning, when
Nigel Wilson, formerly of the Cleveland Indians, singled home two
runs and Jerry Brooks, a former Florida Marlins player, brought in
another.
	   Nishiura now has 16 homers this season.
	   The Fighters are seven games ahead of the second-place Kintetsu
Buffaloes, who lost 8-7 to the Seibu Lions at Seibu Dome.
	   Lions pinch hitter Norio Tanabe drove in the tie-breaking run in
the bottom of the ninth with a sacrifice fly.
	   At Fukuoka Dome, Julio Franco drove in four runs with two home
runs as the Chiba Lotte Marines beat the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks 8-1.
	   Franco, formerly with the Milwaukee Brewers, has 12 homers.
	   In the Central League, Robert Rose drove in four runs with home
runs in the first and seventh innings and Takuro Ishii doubled home
the winning run in the bottom of the ninth as the front-running
Yokohama BayStars edged the Yomiuri Giants 8-7 at Yokohama.
	   The Giants had tied the game 7-7 in the top of the ninth on
Hideki Matsui's single.
	   Matsui also hit a grand slam home run in the five-run fifth
inning.
	   Rose, formerly with the California Angels, has nine homers.
Matsui has 19 and leads the league.
	   The BayStars are four games ahead of the second-place Chunichi
Dragons, who lost 3-1 to the Hiroshima Toyo Carp at Hiroshima,
their third straight defeat.
	   At Tokyo's Jingu Stadium, the Yakult Swallows beat the Hanshin
Tigers 10-3 on 12 hits, including a home run by Dwayne Hosey.
	   Hosey, formerly with the Boston Red Sox, has seven homers.

<TEXT>
	   RAS AL-KHAIMAH, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ A Ukrainian cargo
plane with eight crew members on board burst into flames minutes
after taking off and crashed into the sea, aviation officials and
witnesses said Tuesday. All aboard were believed killed.
	   Divers recovered body parts Tuesday belonging to six of the crew
members, a coast guard official said on condition of anonymity.
	   A witness said hundreds of watermelons spilled out into the sea
from the aircraft after it crashed Monday night, about 500 meters
(550 yards) from the shore.
	   ``It was like a field of watermelons on the water,'' said
Mohammad Hussein, a 46-year-old businessman, who said he saw the
plane catch fire minutes after take-off and then explode. He said
he witnessed the crash from the terrace of a hotel on the beach.
	   The four-engine Ilyushin-76 was owned by Ukraine's Defense
Ministry and was on lease to a private Kiev-based cargo airline,
A.T.I. Aircompany, the Ukrainian Emergency Situations Ministry
said.
	   The Ukrainian Embassy said the plane carried several cars and
audio equipment apparently to be sold in Ukraine. Emirates
officials said it had a crew of seven military men and one
civilian.
	   Officials refused to comment on the nature of the cargo except
to say that it weighed 40 tons and was being ferried from the Gulf
emirate of Ras Al-Khaimah to Mykolayiv in southern Ukraine.
	   Russia's Interfax news agency said the cargo was not dangerous.
	   A.T.I. officials in Kiev confirmed the crash but would not
comment further. Stu Carrie, manager of Ras Al-Khaimah airport,
said the plane was about 15 years old.
	   An official speaking on condition of anonymity said one of the
instruments that recorded in-flight conditions and data was
recovered Tuesday and the search was continuing for the other.
	   Officials at the Emergency Situations Ministry, who spoke on
customary condition of anonymity, said the pilot had attempted a
sea landing after the engine caught fire.
	   Mohammed Al-Ghaith, an Emirates' civil aviation official heading
the crash investigation, said there were no technical faults when
the flight took off at 11 p.m. (1900 GMT) Monday.
	   ``We can't guess. There is no room for guessing,'' he said when
asked about the cause of the crash.
	   Initial reports by the official Emirates News Agency said the
aircraft belonged to Azerbaijani Airlines.
	   An airport official said diving teams initially had difficulty
getting close to the plane due to the heat of the burning wreckage.
	   In the states of the former Soviet Union, it is not uncommon for
private companies to charter military planes for cargo flights, and
the Emirates has a flourishing trade with the region.
	   The Ras al-Khaimah airport receives about 40 flights every week
from cities in the former Soviet Union, where air safety has
declined dramatically as many cash-strapped airlines have failed to
provide adequate maintenance of aging aircraft.
	   In December, 85 people were killed when a Tajik airliner crashed
in the emirate of Sharjah.

Champion jockey questioned by police over party strip
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHEARSLEY, England (AP) _ Leading British jockey Pat Eddery was
questioned by police for allegedly stripping in front of teenage
girls at his daughter's 13th birthday party, Thames Valley Police
said Tuesday.
	   The Sun newspaper reported that Eddery, an 11-time British
champion, did a ``Full Monty'' strip at Sunday's party in the
Chearsley village hall.
	   The Sun said Eddery stripped in front of 30 girls aged between
10 and 14 when the disc jockey played ``You Sexy Thing'' _ a hit on
The Full Monty movie soundtrack.
	   The paper said his daughter Natasha watched in horror as the
46-year-old jockey ``danced among her pals with his full manhood in
view.''
	   Eddery's wife Carolyn Eddery, a former British amateur ladies
champion jockey, denied the allegations Tuesday.
	   Eddery was not available for comment but his agent said he would
ride two horses as scheduled at the Brighton races Tuesday
afternoon.
	   A Thames Valley Police spokesman confirmed Eddery had been
questioned after a complaint made by a member of the public and
inquiries were continuing. No charges have been filed.

Greenspan urges Japan to resolve bad debt problems quickly
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in 8th graf with Greenspan urging freeing up of land
market. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said
Tuesday that Japan should move quickly to clean up bad loans in its
financial system, a Japanese Finance Ministry official said.
	   Greenspan made his remarks in a meeting with Finance Minister
Hikaru Matsunaga in Tokyo, said a senior ministry official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   ``Resolution of the bad debt problem is very important,'' the
official quoted Greenspan as telling Matsunaga.
	   Japanese banks are saddled with more than 77 trillion yen (dlrs
546 billion) in bad loans, making them reluctant to extend fresh
loans and hampering the nation's economic recovery.
	   ``Finally, getting the underlying land collateral off the books
is (also) important,'' Greenspan was quoted as telling the finance
minister.
	   Matsunaga explained to the Fed chairman Japan's plans to shore
up its ailing financial system.
	   Japan's scheme, dubbed the ``Total Plan,'' includes a panel to
resolve disputes over ownership of bad debt collateral.
	   Kyodo News agency reported later Tuesday that Greenspan, in a
meeting with former Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, also urged
Japan to thaw the country's frozen land market, where sales of
collateralized land plots offered against bank loans that later
soured have stalled.
	   During the meeting with Matsunaga, Greenspan explained the U.S.
experience with cleaning up bad debts at savings and loan
institutions and banks in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the
official said.
	   Matsunaga stressed that Japan's plans for financial system
reform will continue under the new administration.
	   On Monday, Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto announced he would
resign in the wake of his party's stunning defeat in Sunday's
elections for the upper house of Parliament.
	   Greenspan came to Japan to attend Monday's one-day meeting of
the Bank for International Settlements.

Italian Scala looks set to become new Real Madrid coach
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Italy's Nevio Scala looked set to become
Real Madrid's new coach replacing Jose Antonio Camacho who tendered
his resignation last week after less than a month on the job, news
reports said Tuesday.
	   Scala, former coach with Germany's Borussia Dortmund, arrived in
Madrid on Tuesday for contract talks with Real chairman Lornezo
Sanz. National television said a two-season contract could be
announced later in the day.
	   If appointed Scala would replace Camacho who resigned last
Thursday after disagreements over the contract for one of his
assistants. His decision came just over a month before the start of
teh next Spanish first division season on Aug. 30.
	   Camacho, in turn, had replaced German Juup Heynckes who was let
go in June after one season, despite leading Real to a record
seventh European Champions title. The side defeated Dortmund to
reach the final.
	   Madrid had initially indicated it was chasing Dutch national
team coach Guus Hiddink for the job.

Russian bailout package now await's parliament's verdict

 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with market close in graf 6. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ With international lenders agreeing to prop up
Russia's shaky economy, President Boris Yeltsin focused Tuesday on
his next key task: convincing parliament to pass an austerity plan.
	   Yeltsin, who's often in conflict with the Communists and other
hard-liners in parliament, sought to charm his opponents Tuesday.
He invited parliamentary leaders to the Kremlin and urged swift
passage of a economic rescue package that seeks to revamp the tax
system and cut the state's budget deficit.
	   ``We shall not be able to implement (the program) if you do not
confirm it,'' Yeltsin told the lawmakers. ``Of course, I can decide
some matters myself, but in the main, the destiny of the program
depends on you.''
	   The International Monetary Fund and other lenders reached
tentative agreement Monday on dlrs 22.6 billion loan package
designed to support the country's crumbling financial markets and
prevent a collapse of the currency.
	   The deal gave an immediate boost to Russia's hard-hit stock
market, which has lost more than half its value this year.
	   Stocks shot up 16.8 percent at the market's close Tuesday,
following a 9 percent surge on Monday. It was the market's best
showing since the crisis began biting in May.
	   ``Sentiment has absolutely turned around,'' said Pavel Patyako,
a trader at Chase Manhattan in Moscow.
	   The IMF board meets in Washington on Monday to review the loan
agreement, and it could send dlrs 5 billion or more to Russia as
soon as next week. However, the IMF wants Russia to address chronic
problems such as its budget deficit and its inability to collect
taxes.
	   Yeltsin's administration has sent more than 20 proposals to
parliament, but Communist lawmakers and other government opponents
have resisted spending cuts and tax increases. They say the
government should be spending more money, not less, to help
struggling Russian citizens and companies.
	   Parliament's lower house, the State Duma, turned down several
proposals earlier this month, and Communist leaders have not given
any indication that their position has changed.
	   The Duma holds a special session Wednesday to debate the
economic package, and it was not clear which way they would vote.
	   If parliament turns down Yeltsin's economic plan, then the IMF
and other lenders might withhold the loans, which Russia needs
urgently.
	   The IMF board ``will make a judgment about the (loan) in the
light of whatever decision the Duma makes,'' the IMF's chief
negotiator, John Odling-Smee, said Monday.
	   The proposed loans are to come from three sources: the IMF, the
World Bank and the Japanese government. When combined with
already-negotiated loans, the package totals dlrs 22.6 billion
spread over this year and next.
	   Millions of Russians have been pushed into poverty by the
country's shrinking economy during the 1990s, and the infusion of
cash is designed to ward off another big downturn.

Nigerian dissident group threatens to boycott transition plan

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ A prominent Nigerian dissident group has
threatened to boycott the government's soon-to-be-announced plans
for a transition to democracy, demanding the transfer to civilian
rule occur as scheduled on Oct. 1.
	   The threatened boycott by the Joint Action Committee on Nigeria
comes amid reports that Nigeria's new military leader, Gen.
Abdulsalam Abubakar, will delay the handover to civilian rule.
	   Abubakar is expected to announce the revised transition plans in
a televised address later this week, perhaps as early as Wednesday.
The new plans call for the military to hand over power on March 31,
after elections are held, the Lagos-based This Day newspaper has
reported. That report could not be immediately confirmed.
	   The Joint Action Committee said that only a government of
national unity, led by a cross-section of Nigerians, could shepherd
the country through the transition and heal the wounds created when
the 1993 presidential elections were annulled.
	   Faith in the country's rulers was further tested when the
presumed winner of that election, Moshood Abiola, died in custody
last week.
	   ``We want a sense of national well-being,'' said the committee's
leader, Lagos lawyer Gani Fawehinmi, after a Monday meeting. The
committee is comprised of 52 dissident groups.
	   The committee believes that a national conference must be set up
before new elections to discuss ways to ensure that Nigeria's
southerners _ who long have been excluded from power _ are given a
role in the country's future.
	   Abiola, a southerner from the Yoruba ethnic group, died July 14.
While his family and many other southerners believe he was killed,
initial autopsy reports show the 60-year-old died of a heart
attack.
	   The Lagos-based daily The Guardian reported Tuesday that the
government's chief radiologist, Col. O. Awofeso, reported in
September 1994 that Abiola's heart was dangerously enlarged. The
Guardian said Gen. Sani Abacha, the former dictator who died last
month, initially gave approval for Abiola to be sent abroad for
treatment, but then rescinded his order.
	   Abiola had been imprisoned since declaring himself president in
1994. The government says he was on the brink of release when he
died.
	   Abacha had originally created Nigeria's plans for a transition
to democracy. But he had blatantly manipulated the transition to
transform himself into a nominally civilian leader.
	   Abubakar has said he intends the country to move toward real
democracy.
	   Since taking office, Abubakar has freed dozens of political
prisoners, vowed to free the rest and met with dissidents and
foreign envoys.
	   However, many Nigerian opposition groups remain deeply
suspicious of him and all other military leaders.

Airport subcontractors arrested for alleged corruption

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ In another setback for Hong Kong's new
multibillion-dollar airport, 12 people connected with construction
of its transportation network were arrested Tuesday on suspicion of
bribery and corruption.
	   Two shareholders, five engineers and five employees of
subcontractors are accused of using substandard materials for the
construction of a station on the railway to the new airport, the
Independent Commission Against Corruption said.
	   The commission did not give any details on those arrested, nor
did it disclose the extent of the damage to the Hong Kong Station
in the territory's Central business district.
	   ``The investigation revealed that they may have accepted
bribes,'' said commission spokeswoman Valentina Chan.
	   A series of raids on 33 sites that began Monday night yielded 14
handguns and about 1,000 rounds of ammunition. The commission did
not know whether the guns were owned by any of those arrested, and
turned the items over to police.
	   Police said they have arrested a woman in connection with the
seizure of the handguns and ammunition, but it was not immediately
known if the suspect had anything to do with the commission's
investigation.
	   The Mass Transit Railway Corp., which operates the airport line,
said all the railway stations are safe.
	   Television Broadcast Ltd. reported that the foundation of the
railway station was not deep enough, adding that the ICAC
investigation will include other railway stations, surrounding
residential areas and an extension of the new airport's passenger
terminal.
	   The announcement followed a string of problems since the dlrs 20
billion airport opened July 6, and seemed certain to increase the
growing criticism of the airport management and government.
	   New Chek Lap Kok airport replaced Hong Kong's venerable,
downtown Kai Tak airport to great expectations. But it immediately
became ensnared in a series of problems with flight delays,
baggage-handling and airport services.
	   The focus now has shifted to deep problems in the highly
profitable cargo section. The main cargo handler had to put an
embargo on most shipments late last week to work through mechanical
and computer problems.
	   Airport officials said Tuesday that passenger services were
continuing to improve, with at least 90 percent of arrivals and
departures within a half-hour of the scheduled time and waits for
baggage ranging from 15-25 minutes.
	   Hong Kong radio said seven cargo planes used the new airport
Tuesday. Cargo flights partially resumed Sunday in an effort to
clear some of the backlog created by massive problems when the
airport opened last week.
	   Meanwhile, Beijing has agreed that Hong Kong airlines could use
Huangtian airport in southern Shenzhen city for the movement of
cargo.
	   A government statement said a Hong Kong delegation headed by
Stephen Ip, Hong Kong's secretary for economic services, will meet
with Chinese officials in Shenzhen Wednesday to discuss the
assistance.
	   Signaling their skeptical attitude toward the whole airport
project, legislators said Tuesday they would launch hearings in at
least four different directions.
	   Legislative panels said they would look into the cargo problems,
transportation to and from the new airport, reported security
lapses at the airport and complaints about the noise it generates.

Finance Minister reassures Kenyan Indians of vital economic role
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS name of Finance Minister to Nyachae throughout; &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Kenyans of Indian origin have a major role
to play in boosting the manufacturing sector in the East African
nation to rival the importance of agriculture, Finance Minister
Simeon Nyachae said Tuesday.
	   ``Kenyans of Indian origin will continue to play a significant
role in this process,'' Nyachae told a one-day seminar on relations
between Kenya and India into the 21st century. He earlier
emphasized the ``tremendous'' role Kenyan Indians have played in
making manufacturing account for 14 percent of Kenya's gross
domestic product.
	   Agriculture currently accounts for 30 percent of Kenya's GDP.
	   Nyachae's assertion that ``Kenya will continue to remain a
multi-ethnic society'' appeared intended to reassure Kenyan's
estimated 70,000 citizens of Indian origin of their place in
society at a time of mounting complaints from Kenyan Africans about
questionable business deals and practices involving Kenyan Indians
and Indians.
	   Indian External Affairs Ministry official Pavan Varma said
another 30,000 Indians living in Kenya hold British passports.
	   Indian-owned shops and businesses have often been the targets of
rioting that has followed political demonstrations.
	   Over the past five years, Indians born in neighboring Uganda
have begun to trickle back at the invitation of President Yoweri
Museveni. In 1972, in a widely popular move, dictator Idi Amin Dada
expelled the entire community of 70,000. The Ugandan economy then
collapsed.
	   While bi-lateral trade between Kenya and India grew by more than
350 percent on both sides from 1992-97 after both countries began
to open up their closed economies, India holds a 5.3 billion
shilling (dlrs 88 million) surplus, Nyachae said.
	   Foreign Minister Boyana Godana said he hoped the seminar would
come up with ways of correcting the imbalance.
	   Amit Mitra, secretary-general of the Indian branch of the
International Federation of Chambers of Commerce, suggested, among
other things, Indian investment in Kenyan agro-processing and joint
ventures like software training institutions in which India has
excelled.
	   There are about 5,000 Kenyans pursuing higher education in
India.

Palestinians: Security Council action on Jerusalem falls short
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A U.N. Security Council statement criticizing
Israel for seeking to expand Jerusalem's boundaries falls short of
expectations and will not deter Israel from going through with the
plan, a Palestinian Cabinet minister said Tuesday.
	   Israel's Foreign Ministry said in a statement it regretted
Monday's decision by the Security Council. The ministry said the
Jerusalem plan, adopted June 21, was municipal in nature and did
not violate the Israeli-Palestinian peace agreements.
	   The Palestinians had hoped the 15-member council would pursue a
binding resolution condemning Israel. However, the United States
likely would have vetoed such a resolution, thus blocking it.
	   In a compromise, the council instead approved a statement that
calls Israel's Jerusalem plan ``a serious and damaging
development.'' It also calls on Israel not to proceed with the
move.
	   Under the Israeli proposal, the municipal boundaries of
Jerusalem would be expanded to include suburbs to the west, in
Israel proper. Jerusalem municipal authority would also be extended
to several Jewish West Bank settlements adjacent to the city.
	   Palestinian Higher Education Minister Hanan Ashrawi said Tuesday
she would have preferred a resolution, even at the risk of inviting
a U.S. veto, over a diluted compromise.
	   ``It is unfortunate that once again the United States has
deflected the work of the Security Council to dilute its position
and come up with a non-binding statement,'' Ashrawi said.
	   The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Bill Richardson, has
called the Security Council statement appropriate and said it sends
the message of support for the Middle East peace process.

International press group protests Kenyan action against opposition
</HEADLINE>
media &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- The International Press Institute
expressed concern Tuesday over the Kenyan government's refusal to
register three opposition publications that have been extensively
covering alleged high-level corruption.
	   On Friday, the government notified Finance magazine, and the
Star and Post on Sunday newspapers that they their applications for
registration have been rejected, making it illegal for them to
continue publishing.
	   In a letter to President Daniel Arap Moi, the IPI urged Moi to
overrule the decision and allow the publications to continue to
operate ``without further harassment.''
	   ``Censorship, whether direct or indirect, is unacceptable,'' the
letter, signed by IPI Director Johann Fritz, said. ``Thus,
restrictions on the free entry to the field of journalism or over
its practices must be abolished.''
	   In Nairobi, Tony Gachoka, editor and publisher of Post on
Sunday, said the government move was intended ``to deny both
Kenyans and international observers information about the true
state of the country's economic and political realities and to keep
the Kenyan people unaware.''
	   Gachoka told The Associated Press he was in hiding after police
raided the offices of the Post on Sunday July 2.
	   He said he already had a certificate of registration for the
newspaper.
	   Star editor Magayu Magayu appeared in court earlier this month
to answer charges he was publishing ``an alarming publication.''
	   A magistrate's court on Friday set bail, but police picked
Magayu up again as soon as he left court.
	   Finance publisher Njehu Gatabaki, who is also an opposition
member of parliament, has a history of problems with the Moi
government since he first began putting out Finance in 1986. The
publication has never been registered.
	   All three editor-publishers have complained of police harassment
because they are publishing stories about alleged high-level
corruption and politically motivated ethnic violence that do not
appear in the mainstream press.
	   Moi reluctantly agreed to multiparty elections in 1992, the
first in Kenya since 1966.
	   The IPI is a global network of editors and media executives
based in Vienna.

	   RAS AL-KHAIMAH, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ A Ukrainian cargo
plane with eight crew members on board burst into flames minutes
after taking off and crashed into the sea, aviation officials and
witnesses said Tuesday. All aboard were believed killed.
	   Divers recovered body parts Tuesday belonging to six of the crew
members, a coast guard official said on condition of anonymity.
	   A witness said hundreds of watermelons spilled out into the sea
from the aircraft after it crashed Monday night, about 500 meters
(550 yards) from the shore.
	   ``It was like a field of watermelons on the water,'' said
Mohammad Hussein, a 46-year-old businessman, who said he saw the
plane catch fire minutes after take-off and then explode. He said
he witnessed the crash from the terrace of a hotel on the beach.
	   The four-engine Ilyushin-76 was owned by Ukraine's Defense
Ministry and was on lease to a private Kiev-based cargo airline,
A.T.I. Aircompany, the Ukrainian Emergency Situations Ministry
said.
	   The Ukrainian Embassy said the plane carried several cars and
audio equipment apparently to be sold in Ukraine. Emirates
officials said it had a crew of seven military men and one
civilian.
	   Officials refused to comment on the nature of the cargo except
to say that it weighed 40 tons and was being ferried from the Gulf
emirate of Ras Al-Khaimah to Mykolayiv in southern Ukraine.

Foreign investment increases tenfold in Bangladesh
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Foreign investment in Bangladesh jumped
tenfold during the last fiscal year, reaching an unprecedented dlrs
3.3 billion, Finance Minister Shah Mohammad Kibria said Tuesday.
	   Kibria said investment proposals worth another dlrs 3.4 billion
were awaiting approval from the government-controlled Board of
Investment. He said Bangladesh had attracted only dlrs 320 million
in investment during the fiscal year that ended in June.
	   ``There has been a huge surge in foreign direct investment in
electricity, natural gas and physical infrastructure,'' Kibria
said. The investors are offered a series of incentives, including
tax holidays, easy repatriation of capital and dividend and low
taxes, he added.
	   Kibria said the Bangladeshi economy, growing at over five
percent a year, had not been affected by the economic turmoil in
Southeast Asia.

 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's highest court cleared the way
Tuesday for a reform of the German language that noted writers and
many ordinary Germans would rather see scrapped.
	   The Federal Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe ruled against a
couple who claimed the changes _ the first major overhaul of
written German in nearly a century _ were unconstitutional.
	   The unanimous verdict set a legal precedent for several other
challenges against the reform, scheduled to take effect Aug. 1
after years of debate over how to simplify one of the world's more
complex languages.
	   Changes include shortening lengthy compound words, cutting comma
rules to quicken the flow of writing, a number of new spellings and
fewer exceptions to writing rules.
	   Education officials said they now expect all German schools to
teach the new rules starting this fall.
	   ``The verdict creates clarity for many unsettled pupils, parents
and teachers,'' said Wolfgang Lieb, chairman of the conference of
state education ministers.
	   But opponents still hope to punch a hole in the reform. A Sept.
27 referendum in Schleswig-Holstein would, if approved, legally bar
the state from applying the changes. Most of Germany's 16 states
are waiting for the referendum before using the new German in
official documents.
	   The federal government also foresees a delay of several months
because it needs to coordinate with state bureaucracies, an
Interior Ministry spokesman said Tuesday.
	   Confusion and controversy have surrounded the language reform
here since culture ministers from Germany, Switzerland and Austria
agreed on it in 1996.
	   The other two countries seemed to take the changes in stride.
But in rule-loving Germany more than 100 prominent authors and
academics signed an appeal urging politicians to stop the reform,
calling it ``absolutely unnecessary in most respects.'' Signers
included Germany's best-known author, Guenter Grass, who wrote
``The Tin Drum.''
	   Last year, two parents filed the complaint the court rejected on
Thursday. Gunda Diercks-Elsner and Thomas Elsner, from the northern
town of Luebeck, had argued that the changes abused their basic
parental rights and that parliament should vote on the reform.
	   The judges threw out the challenge, saying the changes affect
only a small part of written German and did not challenge parents'
authority.
	   Some of the changes bring German closer to English. Sentences
such as ``He's the man who came to dinner'' have needed a comma
before ``who'' in German but won't require it in future.
	   And Germans will no longer ``cleanup'' but ``clean up'' _ as in
``sauber machen.'' The reform separates many such run-on composite
verbs.
	   Other words will be spelled more phonetically. Dolphin, for
example, will be spelled ``Delfin'' instead of ``Delphin.'' (In
German, nouns are are capitalized _ one thing that will stay the
same under the new rules.)
	   Some schools have already started using the new rules. But to
allow Germans to get used to the changes, the old and new writing
styles will officially exist side-by-side until 2005.

12 killed in Yemen shooting and explosion
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AHMED AL-HAJ &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Tribesmen protesting gasoline price hikes
ambushed soldiers with automatic rifles, killing eight of them, a
tribal leader said Tuesday.
	   An opposition newspaper said the army retaliated after the
ambush Monday, sending helicopter gunships that fired missiles at
suspected tribal hideouts. But there were no casualties, the
newspaper, al-Wihadawy, said Tuesday.
	   The ambush took place in the hills of Marib and al-Jawaf, 170
kilometers (105 miles) northeast of the capital San`a, the tribal
leader said speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   In a separate incident, five people were killed and two
seriously injured Monday night after grenades, rockets and guns
stored in their house exploded, security officials said Tuesday.
	   The explosion occurred in Lahj, 35 kilometers (21 miles) north
of the southern port city of Aden. The arms cache was apparently a
remnant of the 1994 civil war and exploded accidentally, officials
said, adding that the incident was not linked to the ongoing
anti-government violence.
	   Al-Wihadawy, an Arabic-language newspaper, said the government
has sent reinforcements over the past few days to Marib and
al-Jawaf to quell the unrest.
	   It said more than 50 tanks, tens of armored personnel carriers
and heavy artillery were seen moving towards the Marib district.
	   The troops also will guard vital oil pipelines in Marib where
tribesmen have blown up seven pipelines over the past month in an
attempt to pressure the government to reverse its decision to raise
fuel prices.
	   Tribesmen and security forces have been fighting since June 19
when the government raised prices of gasoline, kerosene and cooking
gas by 40 percent to meet demands by the International Monetary
Fund.
	   The price hikes are among IMF requirements to remove subsidies
on petroleum products and other commodities by the end of 1998 in
Yemen. In its drive for financial reforms, the government has
already cut other subsidies and stepped up privatization of
state-controlled companies.
	   The government has not released a death toll from the clashes
but the Yemen Times daily newspaper said earlier this month that 52
people had been killed and 214 injured.
	   Large parts of Yemen are lawless, inhabited by tribes who do not
hesitate to kidnap foreigners or use firearms to settle scores with
rivals or to express discontentment against the government.

Church group gets go-ahead to continue Eritrea aid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ A church group said Tuesday it has agreed with
Eritrea to extend its operations there for a year to help Eritreans
expelled from Ethiopia during the countries' border dispute.
	   Eritrean President Isaias Afewerki agreed that the Lutheran
World Federation ``would facilitate rehabilitation and
reintegration measures,'' although specific details remain to be
thrashed out, the group said in a statement.
	   In April the government, in an effort to break the country's
dependence on foreign aid, asked aid groups including LWF to halt
operations and hand over their equipment, said Rudolf Hinz of the
group's world service department.
	   The LWF, involved in water, soil and rebuilding projects, has
been working in the country since 1992. Its budget for Eritrea last
year was dlrs 2.13 million.
	   Eritrea claims as many as 6,000 of its citizens have already
been deported. On Sunday, Ethiopia deported 1,000 members of
Eritrea's ruling party who had been residing in Ethiopia, accusing
them of spying or raising funds for the Eritrean war effort.
	   Border clashes erupted between the two neighboring Horn of
Africa countries on May 6.
	   Tensions escalated in early June when each country bombed the
other and battles raged for a brief period on three fronts.
Hundreds were killed before fighting gave way to a stalemate on the
border where thousands of troops are massed on each side.
	   Both Eritrea and Ethiopia have appealed recently to
international donors to help them with the people displaced by the
conflict.

Allegations of illicit relationship in high-profile treason case

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with defense attorney saying he will ask judge to
disqualify himself, Netanyahu's spokesman demanding apology &QL; 
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The defense attorney in a high-profile treason
trial said Tuesday he would ask the judge to withdraw from the
case, claiming the jurist was involved in an ``intensive'' personal
relationship with a female member of the defense team.
	   In a petition to the Supreme Court, the defense attorney, citing
hearsay, also also alleged that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
discussed the treason case with Judge Amnon Straschnov while the
trial was under way.
	   Netanyahu's office and a spokesman for the courts, speaking on
behalf of Straschnov, denied the allegations.
	   At issue is the case of Nachum Manbar, a former Israeli
paratrooper convicted last month of selling dlrs 16 million worth
of chemical and biological weapons materials to Iran.
	   Straschnov was to hand down Manbar's sentence Wednesday, with
Manbar facing life in prison.
	   Manbar's defense attorney, Amnon Zichroni, will ask the judge at
the beginning of Wednesday's session to disqualify himself, said
Zichroni's spokesman, Dror Arad-Ayalon.
	   Zichroni initially asked the Supreme Court on Tuesday to declare
a mistrial and overturn Manbar's conviction in the Tel Aviv
District Court. However, the court ruled it did not have
jurisdiction in the matter.
	   In his petition to the high court, Zichroni said that a member
of his team, attorney Pninat Yanai, 26, maintained a ``close,
personal, intensive relationship'' with Straschnov during the trial
and passed on confidential information about the case to the judge.
	   Zichroni also said Yanai was ``a close friend'' of Netanyahu
spokesman Shai Bazak. Zichroni said he learned from Yanai's former
boyfriend, Ziv Chen, that Bazak had told Yanai the prime minister
had discussed the case with the judge.
	   Bazak called Zichroni's allegations a ``blatant lie'' and
demanded that the attorney apologize.
	   Last month, after Manbar's conviction on treason charges,
Netanyahu said he hoped the defendant would receive a long
sentence. ``I hope he will pay a heavy price for the terrible thing
he has done,'' Netanyahu said then.
	   Zichroni accused Netanyahu at the time of taking advantage of
his position by meddling in legal proceedings.
	   Yanai was an apprentice lawyer in Straschnov's office before
being hired by Zichroni. Yanai charged Tuesday that Zichroni put
her on the Manbar defense team because he wanted to make use of her
previous professional connection with the judge. Yanai has since
been fired from the team.
	   ``The allegations in the petition that I had erotic relations
with the judge are a lie and aimed at humiliating me and
discrediting the judge,'' Yanai told the court. Chen, her former
boyfriend, was engaged in a vendetta against her, she said.
	   Close to tears, Yanai told reporters the allegations against her
``are a bad joke'' and that she was appearing at the Supreme Court
in order to clear her name.
	   Manbar, an Israeli businessman living in Switzerland, was
arrested in March 1997 on one of his visits to Israel. Israeli
newspapers reported at the time that U.S. officials had asked
Netanyahu to stop Manbar's sales to Iran. The reports also said the
CIA provided Israel with information on Manbar's ties to Iran.
	   Manbar was barred from the United States in 1994, after the U.S.
State Department said he and two of his companies violated a U.S.
trade embargo against Iran.

Amnesty: Israel human rights report leaves out West Bank, Gaza
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HILARY APPELMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's report to the United Nations on its
own human-rights record fails to address Israeli violations against
Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Amnesty International
said Tuesday.
	   The London-based human rights group called the omission of any
mention of the Palestinian territories in the 369-page report to
the U.N. Human Rights Committee ``unacceptable ... especially given
the scale and seriousness of the human rights violations
perpetrated against their populations.''
	   While the Palestinians have gained autonomy in major cities of
the West Bank and most of Gaza, Israel still exercises wide-ranging
control over their lives, and Israeli troops still deal daily with
the Palestinian population.
	   Israel's Justice Ministry, which prepared the report, had no
immediate response to Amnesty's assertion. Israel is to present the
report to the U.N. committee in Geneva on Wednesday and Thursday.
	   Amnesty said it was particularly concerned about killings of
Palestinians by Israeli troops, Israel's use of physical force in
interrogations of Palestinian suspects, the arbitrary detention of
dozens of prisoners without charge or trial, and ``unfair'' trials
of Palestinians in Israeli military courts.
	   Amnesty noted that Israel's report also fails to address the
human rights situation in the swath of southern Lebanon occupied by
Israel, or in the Golan Heights, which Israel captured in the 1967
Mideast War along with the West Bank and Gaza.
	   Lebanese detainees are also tortured and held without charge or
trial, the group said.
	   Elizabeth Brown, a researcher in Amnesty's Mideast department,
said ``everybody was surprised'' by the omissions in the Israeli
report. ``They avoided the major issues,'' she said.
	   Amnesty and several Israeli human rights groups urged the U.N.
committee this week to question Israel about the situation in the
Palestinian territories and other occupied areas. Amnesty asked
that the committee ask Israel to submit a supplementary report.
	   Jose Diaz, a spokesman for the committee in Geneva, said the
committee would not respond to the request until after Israel had
formally presented its report on Wednesday and Thursday.
	   The Israeli report does address the question of torture and
mistreatment of suspects, noting that the use of ``moderate
physical pressure'' during interrogations is limited and closely
supervised.
	   The use of such pressure must be approved on a case-by-case
basis, when the suspect is believed to have information that could
prevent terror attacks or other imminent and foreseeable dangers,
the report said.
	   The report added that it is ``expressly forbidden to injure or
torture suspects.''
	   Amnesty and other human rights groups have charged that Israel
systematically uses practices such as tying up detainees in painful
positions, shaking them violently and depriving them of sleep for
prolonged periods.
	   The rest of the Israeli report deals with the rights of Israeli
citizens, addressing such issues as the status of women and
minorities and freedom of speech and religion.

Russian bailout package now await's parliament's verdict

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin invited parliament leaders
to the Kremlin Tuesday and urged them _ nicely _ to act quickly on
the government's austerity plan now that international lenders have
agreed to prop up Russia's shaky economy.
	   Yeltsin, who's often in conflict with the Communists and other
hard-liners in parliament, sought to charm his opponents, offering
them tea and cookies as he urged swift passage of the economic
rescue package.
	   ``We are one team, we are one state, we are the leaders of this
state,'' Yeltsin told the lawmakers. ``We shall not be able to
implement (the program) if you do not confirm it.''
	   The International Monetary Fund and other lenders reached
tentative agreement Monday on dlrs 22.6 billion loan package
designed to support the country's crumbling financial markets and
prevent a collapse of the currency.
	   The State Duma, parliament's lower house, holds a special
session Wednesday to debate the economic package. If parliament
turns down Yeltsin's economic plan, then the IMF and other lenders
might withhold the loans, which Russia needs urgently.
	   One lawmaker said it was the first time Yeltsin was not
confrontational.
	   ``For the first time, the president was in a very peaceful
mood,'' said Nikolai Kharitonov, leader of the Agrarian Party. ``I
have met him many times, but today was the first time tea was
served.''
	   Yeltsin said it was important for the parliament to act now.
	   ``Of course, I can decide some matters myself,'' Yeltsin said,
indicating that he might implement part of the plan by decree.
``But in the main, the destiny of the program depends on you.''
	   The international loan deal gave an immediate boost to Russia's
hard-hit stock market, which has lost more than half its value this
year.
	   Stocks shot up 16.8 percent Tuesday, on the heels of a 9 percent
surge on Monday. It was the market's best showing since the crisis
began in May.
	   ``The optimism is all around the place, and people believe that
if Russia gets serious about fixing its problems, it could be
really a great story again,'' said Dmitry Kryukov, a trader at the
MFK Renaissance investment bank in Moscow.
	   Russia's Central Bank said its hard-currency reserves had fallen
to dlrs 13.5 billion Tuesday, from 15.1 billion earlier this month.
Bank Chairman Sergei Dubinin said he expects reserves to rise as
money begins to arrive from the loan package.
	   The proposed loans are to come from three sources: the IMF, the
World Bank and the Japanese government. When combined with
already-negotiated loans, the package totals dlrs 22.6 billion
spread over this year and next.
	   The IMF board meets in Washington on Monday to review the loan
agreement, and it could send dlrs 5 billion or more to Russia as
soon as next week. However, the IMF wants Russia to address chronic
problems such as its budget deficit and its inability to collect
taxes.
	   Yeltsin's administration has sent more than 20 proposals to
parliament, but Communist lawmakers and other opponents have
resisted spending cuts and tax increases. They say the government
should be spending more money, not less, to help struggling Russian
citizens and companies.
	   Parliament's lower house, the State Duma, turned down several
proposals earlier this month, and Communist leaders have not given
any indication that their position has changed.
	   Millions of Russians have been pushed into poverty by the
country's shrinking economy during the 1990s, and the infusion of
cash is designed to ward off another big downturn.

Strike cripples life in Nepalese capital, 124 arrested
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) _ Police detained 124 people trying to
enforce a general strike in the Nepalese capital Tuesday to protest
the killing of a lawmaker two weeks ago.
	   The strike, called by the National Democratic Party to protest
the killing of Mirza Dilshad Beg, crippled life in Katmandu,
shutting down shops and schools and forcing vehicles off roads.
	   Beg and his driver were gunned down on June 29 by unidentified
assailants. Police are investigating the case and no one has been
charged yet.
	   Police detained 124 persons attempting to enforce the strike by
obstructing traffic and pelting stones at vehicles, home ministry
spokesman Gopendra Bahadur Pandey said. Over a dozen vehicles were
damaged, he said.
	   A bus conductor was injured when his bus was stoned by
protestors.
	   Organizers alleged at least 300 of their supporters were
arrested by police and party members were being harassed by police.

EU, Mexico launch free trade talks
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By PAUL AMES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Mexico formally launched talks Tuesday
aimed at securing a free-trade pact with the European Union and
diversifying its international commerce which is currently
dominated by trade with the United States.
	   The 15-nation EU is already Mexico's second-largest trading
partner, but their 1997 exchanges worth dlrs 14 billion pale beside
Mexico-U.S. trade which totaled dlrs 176 billion last year.
	   ``We are giving the highest priority to these negotiations,''
said Mexican Commerce Secretary Herminio Blanco. ``We will be
devoting the maximum resources to liberalize trade between our
countries.''
	   Blanco and Mexico's Foreign Secretary Rosario Green kicked off
the trade talks with the EU's Commissioner for Latin American
relations Manuel Marin and Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang
Schuessel, chairman of the EU's Foreign Ministers council.
	   They set up a panel that is expected to hold the first full
negotiating session in September, either in Mexico City or at EU
headquarters in Brussels.
	   No deadline was set for concluding the talks and EU officials
acknowledged they could take years.
	   ``It's very difficult to predict when they will finish,'' Marin
told a news conference. ``It's better to have a good agreement,
than a quick agreement.''
	   Officials said manufactured goods which account for 62 percent
of Mexico's exports to the Union would likely prove the thorniest
problem in the negotiations.
	   Some EU nations fear their industries, particularly in textiles
and the electrical goods sector, will be overexposed to Mexican
competition.
	   ``Without doubt the negotiations we started today will be
complex,'' Blanco told the meeting. ``Fortunately there are no
unsolvable problems in the sensitive sectors of our economies.''
	   The Europeans are eager to reverse a decline in their slice of
Mexico's foreign trade, particularly since Mexico signed the North
American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and the United States in
1994.
	   Since the start of the 1990s, the EU's share of Mexico's total
trade fell from 11 percent to 6 percent. Some 80 percent of
Mexico's trade is with the United States.
	   ``We are not happy with our performance,'' said Schuessel. ``We
hope these negotiations ... will help us catch up in the light of
the NAFTA accord.''
	   Dovetailing a Mexico-EU free-trade pact with NAFTA and other
trade accords Mexico has with Central and South American nations,
could prove tricky for the negotiators.
	   They have to draw up ``rules of origin'' to ensure products from
other nations don't sneak into the EU via favorable trading
conditions granted to Mexico, or that tariff-free EU goods aren't
re-exported through Mexico into the United States, Canada or South
American nations.
	   The European Commission, the EU's executive body, will handle
the negotiations on behalf of the European bloc with a mandate from
the 15 member nations.
	   As well as trade in goods and services, the talks will also aim
to open up public procurement markets, liberalize capital movements
and adopt agreements to ensure fair competition among companies.

	   LORIENT, France (AP) - Jens Hepper of Germany won Tuesday's
third stage of the Tour de France as the race returned to French
ground.
	   Heppner held off Xavier Jan of France in a final sprint after
both had broken slightly away from the pack in the, final
kilometers (miles). Heppner spoiled the Frenchman's attempt to win
a stage on Bastille Day on the 169-kilometer (105-mile) leg south
through Britany on the western coast of France from Roscoff to
Lorient.
	   Bo Hamburger of Denmark took over the overall lead from Erik
Zabel of Germany. Hmbuerger finished fourth in the stage, just
behind American George Hincapie. Both were two seconds behind the
leaders.
	   Zabel lost his overall lead ending up 14th in the main pack more
than a minute behind.
	   The Tour de France tried to settle down after three hectic days
and one hectic night in Ireland.
	   Britain's Chris Boardman won the prologue and held the leader's
yellow jersey for a day before crashing out in Monday's stage to
Cork. He remained in the hospital overnight before being released.
	   The Tour is also recovering from the controversy involving the
top-ranked French team Festina. A Belgian member of its staff
remained jailed after having been arrested last week near the
French-Belgian border in possesion of performance-enhancing drugs.
	   Monday night, 186 cyclists and team personnel flew to Brittany
Monday evening in three chartered planes.
	   Most of the rest of the 3,500 persons following the Tour de
France went overnight on ferries to land on French soil just around
noon, just before the start of the state. The leg was the shortest
of this year's Tour de France outside of the time trials.
	   The race heads south until hitting the Pyrenees Jluy 20 then
heads to the Alps before finishing in Paris Aug. 2

Parliament approves transfer of presidential powers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ In a move designed to avoid a legal
vacuum after September parliamentary elections, the Slovak
parliament transferred Tuesday presidential powers to dissolve and
name a cabinet to the parliament speaker.
	   The amendment to the constituion was approved by both the
opposition and the governing coalition in the otherwise bitterly
divided parliament.
	   Slovakia has been without a president since early March when
Michal Kovac ended his term of office with no successor.
	   All attempts to elect a president turned into a farce as
everyone knew no candidate, proposed either by the deputies
supporting Premier Vladimir Meciar or by the opposition, had a
chance to receive the necessary majority of votes.
	   While five unsuccessful rounds of presidential elections were
taking place in the parliament, Meciar enjoyed most presidential
powers that had been transferred to the government in March.
	   The opposition was worried Meciar could abuse the situation and
carry on regardless of the election results in September if there
were not enough deputies to support a presidential candidate.
	   The amendment passed on Tuesday was proposed by the government.

Amnesty: Israel human rights report leaves out West Bank, Gaza

Italian designer barred from using pope recording in fashion show
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Bowing to a Vatican veto, Italian designer Kean Etro
on Tuesday gave up plans embellish his fashion show on Rome's
Spanish Steps with a recording of Pope John Paul II singing a
Gregorian chant.
	   ``We just wanted to pay homage, to make our contribution to the
re-discovery of spirituality all over the world,'' the Milanese
designer said in a statement. ``However, we respect your wishes and
we'll replace the song.''
	   Etro wanted to use a new arrangement of a Gregorian chant the
pope performed during a Mass in 1997. But Vatican Radio, which has
exclusive rights to papal recordings, threatened to take Etro to
court to stop him.
	   The fashion extravaganza at the Spanish Steps on Thursday is the
final event of the annual High Fashion week in Rome.

Italian designer barred from using pope recording in fashion show
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Bowing to a Vatican veto, Italian designer Kean Etro
on Tuesday gave up plans embellish his fashion show on Rome's
Spanish Steps with a recording of Pope John Paul II singing a
Gregorian chant.
	   ``We just wanted to pay homage, to make our contribution to the
re-discovery of spirituality all over the world,'' the Milanese
designer said in a statement. ``However, we respect your wishes and
we'll replace the song.''
	   Etro wanted to use a new arrangement of a Gregorian chant the
pope performed during a Mass in 1997. But Vatican Radio, which has
exclusive rights to papal recordings, refused permission,
threatening to take Etro to court to stop him.
	   The fashion extravaganza at the Spanish Steps on Thursday is the
final event of the annual High Fashion week in Rome.

Romania names former striker as new soccer coach
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ A former striker and coach of
Romania's under-21 soccer team was appointed Tuesday to head the
country's national soccer team for two years.
	   Victor Piturca, 42, replaces Anghel Iordanescu, who has signed a
contract with Greece. Piturca's salary is confidential, but
Iordanescu will be paid dlrs 400,000 a year by Greece, a fortune in
Romania.
	   Romania was eliminated by Croatia in the World Cup, losing 1-0.
The team is comprised of several aging soccer stars and a handful
of budding young ones who play for mainly European soccer clubs.
	   Convicted of gambling during the Communist years, Piturca said
he aims to get the team to the European Championships in two years.
	   ``I was a striker, and so I will train the team to be on the
offensive,'' said Piturca after he was named.
	   Piturca played for Romania 13 times and in 1986 won the European
Champions' Cup with Steaua Bucharest.
	   Romania will next play a friendly game against Germany in Malta
on Sept. 5 and after that against Liechtenstein, Portugal and
Hungary for the European Championship in Holland and Belgium.
	   Romania's star player Gheorghe Hagi recently resigned from the
national squad after 17 years and 114 caps.

	   BALLYMONEY, Northern Ireland (AP) _ As the small coffins of
three young brothers lay before the altar of a Catholic church
Tuesday, a young woman reduced mourners to tears when she asked why
anyone would want to kill them. ``Who would have so much evil at
their fingertips?''
	   Richard, Mark and Jason Quinn, born to a Catholic mother but
raised as Protestants, died in a sectarian firebomb attack, victims
of a war of hatred in Northern Ireland.
	   Their deaths Sunday morning shocked a province all too
accustomed to dying and led to serious soul-searching about the
future of its shaky peace.
	   ``The entire community must begin to work together at every
level to eradicate the evil of sectarianism,'' said Seamus Mallon,
Catholic deputy minister of Northern Ireland's new government and
one of the mourners at the funeral. ``That work cannot be
postponed. It must start today and must be the responsibility of
everyone who wants to create a new future.''
	   But the boys' funeral also focused a global spotlight on the
emotional distress and devastation that more than 20 years of
violence have wrought on individual families and their communities.
	   In a strong voice, Andrea Ramsey read a poem she wrote with
Amanda McAlonan called ``Little Lips.'' The young women knew the
Quinn brothers.
	   ``Why would someone do this is the question on our lips? ... Oh
Lord, please let the evil people be brought to justice some day,''
she read. ``Richard, Mark and Jason in our memory you will stay. I
can still feel the cold, wet lips from when I kissed you and then
you ran away. ... I miss you so much, your little lips long to
touch. Kisses and hugs _ Rest In Peace.''
	   The packed congregation at the Roman Catholic Church of Our Lady
and St. Patrick wept and burst into spontaneous applause at its
close.
	   It was a day of tears for what The Most Rev. Patrick Walsh,
Bishop of Down and Connor, called ``the saddest of sad funerals.''
	   When the boys' coffins were carried from their grandmother's
bungalow in Rasharkin, about 7 miles (12 kms) away, many relatives,
friends and neighbors sobbed. Their mother, Chrissie Quinn, 29, had
to be supported at times. Her close friend John Dillon wept and
stroked the coffin he carried to the hearse, where the brothers
were laid side by side.
	   And when the 90 minute funeral service ended, and the boys'
coffins were returned to the hearse for their final journey to
Rasharkin for burial, there wasn't a dry eye in the huge crowd
standing silently outside.
	   Pictures of the boys in happier times lay on top of the white
coffins with brass nameplates and crosses.
	   Half a dozen floral tributes rested against the church's stone
wall. One card read: ``Sleep in peace little angels.''
	   Tensions spilling over from a blocked Protestant march outside a
rural church near Portadown were blamed for the firebombing of the
Quinn house. Police said they believed the family was targeted
because Chrissie Quinn lived there with her Protestant boyfriend.
	   Two men were being questioned, police said.
	   Bishop Walsh said the blame for the children's murders lay not
only with the killers themselves but also with those who had
incited violence with their words.
	   ``The weapons of hate-filled words inevitably fuel weapons of
murderous destruction,'' he said.
	   The Rev. Peter Forde told the congregation that many people were
undoubtedly asking whether it was God's will that three young boys
would be killed by a firebomb.
	   ``God would not have chosen it this way. I'm sure he had
interesting plans, good plans, for Richard, for Mark and for Jason.
But someone, certainly not through God's will, put an end to those
plans,'' the priest said.
	   Forde asked the family to trust that God was now looking after
Richard, Mark and Jason _ and that one day ``all of us will meet
them again.''
	   ``We meet in sorrow at the death of these children, but our
shared sorrow is a beacon of hope for all the community. And in
this our very troubled country, may it light our way ahead,'' he
said.
	   Irene Quinn, the boys' grandmother, said her daughter wanted the
boys buried in Rasharkin, where the family has its roots, so she
never again would have to set foot in Ballymoney. Chrissie Quinn's
oldest son, 13-year-old Lee, spent Saturday night with his
grandmother and so escaped the attack.
	   Ms. Quinn was raising the boys as Protestants because she
thought it would make life easier for them in Ballymoney, a
hard-line Protestant stronghold about 40 miles (60 kms) northwest
of Belfast.
	   Members of the Protestant Orange Order shied away from
confrontation Monday in marches across Northern Ireland, weighed
down by their own bitter divisions and subdued by the shock of the
deaths of the boys, who were 11, 10 and 9.
	   But members of the Orange Order in Portadown are insisting on
their right to march through a Catholic neighborhood even though a
government-appointed parades commission twice denied their
application. Hundreds of police and British soldiers have
maintained the blockade since July 5, and Prime Minister Tony Blair
has insisted the law will be enforced.
	   All the senior chaplains of the Orange Order issued a statement
Tuesday supporting the County Armagh chaplain, The Rev. William
Bingham, who declared on Sunday that walking down the Catholic
Garvachy Road was not worth a life _ let alone the lives of three
boys.
	   There were minor skirmishes early Tuesday between security
forces and protesters at the barricades, and elsewhere in Northern
Ireland three Orange halls were attacked with firebombs.

EU, Mexico launch free trade talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Mexico on Tuesday formally opened free
trade talks with the European Union on Tuesday to help boost trade
beyond its North American base.
	   The 15-nation EU is already Mexico's second-largest trading
partner, but their 1997 exchanges worth dlrs 14 billion pale beside
Mexico-U.S. trade which totaled dlrs 176 billion last year.
	   ``We are giving the highest priority to these negotiations,''
said Mexican Commerce Secretary Herminio Blanco. ``We will be
devoting the maximum resources to liberalize trade between our
countries.''
	   Blanco and Mexico's Foreign Secretary Rosario Green kicked off
the trade talks with the EU's Commissioner for Latin American
relations Manuel Marin and Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang
Schuessel, chairman of the EU's Foreign Ministers council.
	   They set up a panel that is expected to hold the first full
negotiating session in September, either in Mexico City or at EU
headquarters in Brussels.
	   No deadline was set for concluding the talks and EU officials
acknowledged they could take years.
	   ``It's very difficult to predict when they will finish,'' Marin
told a news conference. ``It's better to have a good agreement,
than a quick agreement.''
	   Officials said manufactured goods which account for 62 percent
of Mexico's exports to the Union would likely prove the thorniest
problem in the negotiations.
	   ``Without doubt the negotiations we started today will be
complex,'' Blanco told the meeting. ``Fortunately there are no
unsolvable problems in the sensitive sectors of our economies.''
	   The Europeans are eager to reverse a decline in their slice of
Mexico's foreign trade, particularly since Mexico signed the North
American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and the United States in
1994.
	   Since the start of the 1990s, the EU's share of Mexico's total
trade fell from 11 percent to 6 percent. Some 80 percent of
Mexico's trade is with the United States.
	   ``We are not happy with our performance,'' said Schuessel. ``We
hope these negotiations ... will help us catch up in the light of
the NAFTA accord.''
	   Dovetailing a Mexico-EU free-trade pact with NAFTA and other
trade accords Mexico has with Central and South American nations
could prove tricky for the negotiators.
	   They have to draw up ``rules of origin'' to ensure products from
other nations don't sneak into the EU via favorable trading
conditions granted to Mexico, or that tariff-free EU goods aren't
re-exported through Mexico into the United States, Canada or South
American nations.
	   The European Commission, the EU's executive body, will handle
the negotiations on behalf of the European bloc with a mandate from
the 15 member nations. The talks will cover public procurement,
capital movements and fair competition among companies.

Amnesty: Israel human rights report leaves out West Bank, Gaza
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 6 grafs to UPDATE with Human Rights Watch also
criticizing Israel, no comment from Justice, Foreign ministries;
ADDS comments from government spokesman in grafs 8-10 &QL;

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's report to the United Nations on its
own human-rights record fails to address Israeli violations against
Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, two international
human rights groups said Tuesday.
	   The London-based Amnesty International called the omission of
any mention of the Palestinian territories in the 369-page report
to the U.N. Human Rights Committee ``unacceptable ... especially
given the scale and seriousness of the human rights violations
perpetrated against their populations.''
	   Human Rights Watch, based in New York, said the report
``seriously misrepresents Israel's human rights record.''
	   Both groups said the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights requires Israel to report on the situation in
territories it occupies.
	   While the Palestinians have gained autonomy in major cities of
the West Bank and most of Gaza, Israel still exercises wide-ranging
control over their lives, and Israeli troops still deal daily with
the Palestinian population.
	   Israel's Justice Ministry and Foreign Ministry, which prepared
the report, did not respond to the groups' assertions. Israel is to
present the report to the U.N. committee in Geneva on Wednesday and
Thursday.
	   Amnesty said it was particularly concerned about killings of
Palestinians by Israeli troops, Israel's use of physical force in
interrogations of Palestinian suspects, the arbitrary detention of
dozens of prisoners without charge or trial, and ``unfair'' trials
of Palestinians in Israeli military courts.
	   Amnesty noted that Israel's report also fails to address the
human rights situation in the swath of southern Lebanon occupied by
Israel, or in the Golan Heights, which Israel captured in the 1967
Mideast War along with the West Bank and Gaza.
	   Lebanese detainees are also tortured and held without charge or
trial, the group said.
	   Israeli government spokesman Moshe Fogel noted that the
emergency law Israel applies in the West Bank and Gaza is based on
pre-state British mandatory law. He said Israel should be not be
judged by the standards of countries at peace, because Israel is
faced with a ``belligerent population'' in the territories.
	   Fogel said that since 1967, Israel has allowed Israeli and
international human rights groups free access to the territories.
	   ``In spite of criticism, we continue to be open for examination
and to be accountable on the score of human rights,'' he said.
	   Amnesty and several Israeli human rights groups urged the U.N.
committee this week to question Israel about the situation in the
Palestinian territories and other occupied areas. Amnesty asked
that the committee ask Israel to submit a supplementary report.
	   Jose Diaz, a spokesman for the committee in Geneva, said the
committee would not respond to the request until after Israel had
formally presented its report on Wednesday and Thursday.
	   The Israeli report does address the question of torture and
mistreatment of suspects, noting that the use of ``moderate
physical pressure'' during interrogations is limited and closely
supervised.
	   The use of such pressure must be approved on a case-by-case
basis, when the suspect is believed to have information that could
prevent terror attacks or other imminent and foreseeable dangers,
the report said.
	   The report added that it is ``expressly forbidden to injure or
torture suspects.''
	   Amnesty and other human rights groups have charged that Israel
systematically uses practices such as tying up detainees in painful
positions, shaking them violently and depriving them of sleep for
prolonged periods.
	   The rest of the Israeli report deals with the rights of Israeli
citizens, addressing such issues as the status of women and
minorities and freedom of speech and religion.

Fragile Turkish coalition splits over wage hike dispute
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz said Tuesday
he would not back track from a 20 percent salary hike for civil
servants, even if it breaks up his minority government.
	   ``I can't even give a half percent over the 20 percent,'' the
Anatolia news agency quoted Yilmaz as telling his center-right
Motherland Party in Parliament. ``Our decision might lead to the
breakup of the government.''
	   One of Yilmaz's coalition partners, the Democratic Turkey Party,
has been insisting on a rise of 40 percent for civil servants.
	   Thousands of civil servants took to the streets nationwide on
Tuesday to protest the proposed 20 percent. Salaries in the public
sector are regularly increased, although not proportionally to
inflation.
	   But Yilmaz, intent on halving Turkey's chronic 100 percent
inflation by the end of this year, insists on strict fiscal
measures and accepted scrutiny of the Turkish economy by the
International Monetary Fund last month.
	   Deputy Premier Bulent Ecevit, leader of the third coalition
partner, the Democratic Left Party, proposed early elections in the
fall. ``If the government is not allowed to work in harmony, then
we might as well go to the polls before the end of the year,'' he
told reporters in Istanbul.
	   Yilmaz has already made a deal for elections in April with the
social democratic Republican People's Party, which gives key
support to the minority government.
	   Yilmaz came to power last year after the military forced the
previous, Islamic-led government out of power.
	   Turkey has been governed by fragile coalitions since 1991. Three
have collapsed since 1995.

Romania names former striker as new soccer coach
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ A former striker and coach of
Romania's under-21 soccer team was appointed Tuesday to head the
country's national soccer team for two years.
	   Victor Piturca, 42, replaces Anghel Iordanescu, who has signed a
contract with Greece. Piturca's salary is confidential, but Greece
will pay Iordanescu dlrs 400,000 a year, a fortune in Romania.
	   Romania was eliminated by Croatia in the World Cup, losing 1-0.
The team is comprised of several aging soccer stars and a handful
of budding young ones who play for mainly European soccer clubs.
	   Piturca, who had been convicted of gambling during the Communist
years, said he aims to get the team to the European Championships
in two years.
	   ``I was a striker, and so I will train the team to be on the
offensive,'' said Piturca after he was named.
	   Piturca played for Romania 13 times and in 1986 won the European
Champions' Cup with Steaua Bucharest.
	   Romania will next play a friendly game against Germany in Malta
on Sept. 5 and after that against Liechtenstein, Portugal and
Hungary for the European Championship in Holland and Belgium.
	   Romania's star player, Gheorghe Hagi, recently retired from the
national squad after 17 years and 114 caps.

Funeral for Northern Ireland's three brothers, victims of hatred

 &UR; Eds: INSERTS sentence in graf 6 saying parish priest initially
identified Ramsey as the boys' aunt &QL;

<TEXT>
	   BALLYMONEY, Northern Ireland (AP) _ As the small coffins of
three young brothers lay before the altar of a Catholic church
Tuesday, a young woman reduced mourners to tears when she asked why
anyone would want to kill them. ``Who would have so much evil at
their fingertips?''
	   Richard, Mark and Jason Quinn, born to a Catholic mother but
raised as Protestants, died in a sectarian firebomb attack, victims
of a war of hatred in Northern Ireland.
	   Their deaths Sunday morning shocked a province all too
accustomed to dying and led to serious soul-searching about the
future of its shaky peace.
	   ``The entire community must begin to work together at every
level to eradicate the evil of sectarianism,'' said Seamus Mallon,
Catholic deputy minister of Northern Ireland's new government and
one of the mourners at the funeral. ``That work cannot be
postponed. It must start today and must be the responsibility of
everyone who wants to create a new future.''
	   But the boys' funeral also focused a global spotlight on the
emotional distress and devastation that more than 20 years of
violence have wrought on individual families and their communities.
	   In a strong voice, Andrea Ramsey read a poem she wrote with
Amanda McAlonan called ``Little Lips.'' The young women knew the
Quinn brothers. The parish priest, The Rev. Peter Forde, initially
identified Ramsey as the boys' aunt.

Argentina records slight dip in unemployment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Argentina's unemployment rate
dipped slightly in recent months, ebbing from 13.7 percent in
October 1997 to just below 13.4 percent in May, a report said
Tuesday.
	   Carlos Rodriguez, deputy economics minister, disclosed the
figures to the newspaper Clarin. He credited payroll tax cuts and
other measures dating as far back as 1996 for the falling
unemployment.
	   ``Now, we're seeing the results of a labor system that tries to
imitate the highly regulated European model,'' Rodriguez told the
prominent Buenos Aires daily.
	   He said the payroll tax cuts and other measures, put in place by
former economics minister Domingo Cavallo, have had a lasting
effect on Argentina's economy.
	   High unemployment has been a chief complaint of Argentines,
whose jobless rate reached a record 18.4 percent in May 1995 _
blamed on the so-called ``Tequila Effect'' of the Mexican economic
crisis.
	   A government report last October said the 13.7 percent
unemployment meant some 1.7 million Argentines went without work.
	   The government of President Carlos Menem has exhorted the
nation's Congress to overhaul labor laws to spur job creation. His
economics minister, Roque Fernandez, has warned that double-digit
unemployment could persist until 2000 without such ``labor
flexibility.''

Allegations of illicit relationship in high-profile treason case
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The trial of an Israeli paratrooper convicted
of treason was tainted by the judge's ``intensive'' personal
relationship with a member of the defense team and possible
improper contacts between the judge and the prime minister, the
defense attorney said Tuesday.
	   The attorney, Amnon Zichroni said he will ask that Judge Amnon
Straschnov withdraw from the case Wednesday.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office and a spokesman for
the courts, speaking on behalf of Straschnov, denied the
allegations.
	   Former Israeli paratrooper Nachum Manbar was convicted last
month of selling dlrs 16 million worth of chemical and biological
weapons materials to Iran.
	   Straschnov was to hand down Manbar's sentence Wednesday, with
Manbar facing life in prison.
	   Zichroni asked the Supreme Court on Tuesday to declare a
mistrial and overturn Manbar's conviction, but the court ruled it
did not have jurisdiction.
	   In his petition to the high court, Zichroni said that a member
of his team, attorney Pninat Yanai, 26, maintained a ``close,
personal, intensive relationship'' with Straschnov during the trial
and gave him confidential information about the case.
	   Zichroni also said he learned from Yanai's former boyfriend, Ziv
Chen, that Netanyahu spokesman Shai Bazak had told Yanai that the
prime minister had discussed the case with the judge.
	   Bazak called Zichroni's allegations a ``blatant lie'' and
demanded that the attorney apologize.
	   Yanai was an apprentice lawyer in Straschnov's office before
being hired by Zichroni. Yanai charged Tuesday that Zichroni put
her on the Manbar defense team because he wanted to make use of her
previous professional connection with the judge. Yanai has since
been fired from the team.
	   ``The allegations in the petition that I had erotic relations
with the judge are a lie and aimed at humiliating me and
discrediting the judge,'' Yanai told the court. Chen was engaged in
a vendetta against her, she said.

Neurologist: Ronaldo should not have played after fit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ Brazilian striker Ronaldo should not
have played in the World Cup final after suffering a convulsive
fit, a leading English neurologist said Tuesday.
	   Adrian Williams, professor of clinical neurology at Birmingham
University, said Ronaldo would have been feeling the after effects
of his seizure during his below-par performance in Brazil's 3-0
loss to France.
	   ``The idea that someone would be able to carry on a few hours
after a seizure is wrong,'' Williams said. ``I'm not saying that it
would be dangerous, but there is no way that he would have been
able to perform to the best of his ability within 24 hours of his
first fit _ if it was his first fit.''
	   Brazil's preparation for the World Cup final was thrown into
turmoil Sunday after the star striker had convulsions and was
rushed to hospital.
	   Brazil coach Mario Zagello left Ronaldo off the team sheet
issued 72 minutes before the final but he was reinstated about 40
minutes before the game when a second team sheet was released.
	   The Brazilians did not warm up on the pitch before the game,
adding to media speculation about a rift in the camp.
	   Various explanations were issued by Brazil team doctor Lidio
Toledo. Initially it was reported Ronaldo had suffered an ankle
injury, later he was reported to have had an ``upset stomach''
after lunch.
	   Toledo finally admitted Monday that Ronaldo had suffered a
stress-related fit.
	   ``We lost the World Cup but I won another cup _ my life,''
Ronaldo said. ``I don't remember what happened but I went to sleep
and, like the doctor said, it seems I had a fit for about 30 or 40
seconds.''
	   The FIFA World Player of the Year arrived at the Stade de France
45 minutes before the kick-off after neurological and cardiac tests
had cleared him of any series medical condition.
	   Williams said it would be difficult to determine what had caused
Ronaldo's convulsions but doubted it was purely stress related.

Tighten laws on protests, media freedom, Mugabe tells lawmakers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Embattled President Robert Mugabe asked
lawmakers convening for a new session of Parliament on Tuesday to
tigheten curbs on demonstrations and media freedom.
	   He said the 150 lawmakers should empower police to ban public
protests if they risked ``ending up as a riotous event.''
	   Speaking before the official opening of Parliament in Harare,
Mugabe said the government would not allow independent media
organizations to thrive on what he described as ``manufactured
lies.''
	   ``Let the gutter press take heed, because we are not going to
have this kind of journalism in this country,'' he said.
	   Mugabe's remarks to lawmakers and guests came as his embattled
government was the target of increasing criticism in three
small-circulation independent weekly newspapers and a few monthly
publications.
	   The state controls the nation's two mass-circulation daily
newspapers and three weeklies. There is no independent broadcast
station operating outside the state Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corp.
	   Independent publications have criticized his government for
economic mismanagement and failing to clamp down on high level
graft.
	   They have also called on Mugabe, the only black leader since the
former British colony of Rhodesia became independent Zimbabwe in
1980, to step down.
	   Unrest over deteriorating economic conditions and government
corruption has posed the most serious threat to Mugabe, leading to
food riots, student protests and a series of strikes in recent
months.
	   Most essential commodities have increased in price by more than
25 percent since November, when the Zimbabwe dollar plunged by
nearly 60 percent in value against the U.S. dollar.
	   Inflation has exceeded 30 percent this month and unemployment
reached more than 50 percent.
	   The ruling party holds all but three of the 150 seats in the
parliament.
	   Mugabe warned lawmakers Tuesday against dissent and said members
who did not follow the party line faced disciplinary action.
	   ``You must obey the party whip and follow that line or else,''
he said.
	   A top provincial party official was expelled from the party
earlier this year after criticizing Mugabe's authoritarian
leadership.

Amnesty: Israel human rights report leaves out West Bank, Gaza
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's report to the United Nations on its
own human-rights record omits Israeli violations against
Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, two international
human rights groups said Tuesday.
	   The London-based Amnesty International called the omission of
Palestinian territories in the 369-page report to the U.N. Human
Rights Committee ``unacceptable ... especially given the scale and
seriousness of the human rights violations perpetrated against
their populations.''
	   Human Rights Watch, based in New York, said the report
``seriously misrepresents Israel's human rights record.''
	   Both groups said the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights requires Israel to report on the situation in
territories it occupies.
	   While the Palestinians have gained autonomy in major cities of
the West Bank and most of Gaza, Israel still exercises wide-ranging
control over their lives, and Israeli troops still deal daily with
the Palestinian population.
	   Israel's Justice Ministry and Foreign Ministry, which prepared
the report, did not respond to the groups' assertions. Israel is to
present the report to the U.N. committee in Geneva on Wednesday and
Thursday.
	   Amnesty said it was particularly concerned about killings of
Palestinians by Israeli troops, Israel's use of physical force in
interrogations of Palestinian suspects, the arbitrary detention of
dozens of prisoners without charge or trial, and ``unfair'' trials
of Palestinians in Israeli military courts.
	   Amnesty noted that Israel's report also fails to address the
human rights situation in the swath of southern Lebanon occupied by
Israel, or in the Golan Heights, which Israel captured in the 1967
Mideast War along with the West Bank and Gaza.
	   Lebanese detainees are also tortured and held without charge or
trial, the group said.
	   Israeli government spokesman Moshe Fogel noted that the
emergency law Israel applies in the West Bank and Gaza is based on
pre-state British mandatory law. He said Israel should be not be
judged by the standards of countries at peace, because Israel is
faced with a ``belligerent population'' in the territories.
	   Fogel said that since 1967, Israel has allowed Israeli and
international human rights groups free access to the territories.
	   ``In spite of criticism, we continue to be open for examination
and to be accountable on the score of human rights,'' he said.
	   Amnesty and several Israeli human rights groups urged the U.N.
committee this week to question Israel about the situation in the
Palestinian territories and other occupied areas. Amnesty asked
that the committee ask Israel to submit a supplementary report.
	   Jose Diaz, a spokesman for the committee in Geneva, said the
committee would not respond to the request until after Israel had
formally presented its report on Wednesday and Thursday.
	   The Israeli report does address the question of torture and
mistreatment of suspects, noting that the use of ``moderate
physical pressure'' during interrogations is limited and closely
supervised.
	   The use of such pressure must be approved on a case-by-case
basis, when the suspect is believed to have information that could
prevent terror attacks or other imminent and foreseeable dangers,
the report said.
	   The report added that it is ``expressly forbidden to injure or
torture suspects.''
	   Amnesty and other human rights groups have charged that Israeli
interrogators tie up detainees in painful positions, shake them
violently and deprive them of sleep for prolonged periods.
	   The rest of the Israeli report deals with the rights of Israeli
citizens, addressing such issues as the status of women and
minorities and freedom of speech and religion.

Government to transfer some police out of troubled area
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ The government said Tuesday it
will send hundreds of reinforcement to a town in KwaZulu Natal to
try to quell political violence that killed 23 people last week.
	   Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi also told reporters
some police officers will be transferred out of the town of
Richmond, where witnesses claim some police have been involved in
the violence.
	   Mufamadi said 240 extra men from outside the area would be
deployed around Richmond and that the government is considering
sending troops to the area.
	   President Nelson Mandela spoke at the funeral Sunday in Richmond
and pledged that the government would combat ``sinister'' elements
in the security forces.
	   ``We have been patient in trying to deal with such sinister
forces which are attempting to take us back to the apartheid days.
We will no longer treat such forces with kid gloves,'' Mandela
warned.
	   Richmond, 450 kilometers (280 miles) southeast of Johannesburg,
was hard-hit by political violence in the last years of apartheid
and the run-up to the first all-race elections in 1994. More than
10,000 people were killed in the last decade, many in fighting
between supporters of the African National Congress and the rival
Inkatha Freedom Party.
	   The new round of violence revolves around a local power struggle
between the AND and the United Democratic Movement, a new political
party. There are fears could escalate as the country moves closer
to next year's elections.
	   The local UDM leader, Sifiso Nkabinde, was expelled as a local
ANC chairman because he allegedly had informed for the
apartheid-era security forces. Nkabinde earlier this year was
acquitted of charges that he killed 16 people.
	   Nkabinde, who has denied being behind the killings, told the
South African Press Association on Tuesday that suggestions by some
politicians that the violence has escalated since his aquittal were
an attempt to discredit him and his party.

Young women bring tears at funeral with poem for murdered brothers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Northern Ireland &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BALLYMONEY, Northern Ireland (AP) _ A poem written by two young
women who knew the three young boys murdered in a sectarian
firebomb attack brought mourners at their funeral Tuesday to tears.
The tribute by Andrea Ramsey and Amanda McAlonan was read by Ramsey
at the funeral at the Roman Catholic Church of Our Lady and St.
Patrick.
	   Tribute To `Three Jolly Fellas'
	   I woke up this morning to hear the horror on the news
	   That three young lives were taken which leaves me sad and
confused.
	   Why would someone do this is the question on our lips.
	   Who would have so much evil at their fingertips?
	   And take the lives of Richard, Mark and Jason in such a terrible
way.
	   We will never forget them, not even for a day.
	   Three jolly fellas who had so much to learn and enjoy
	   Have been snatched away from us today.
	   And we all have a feeling of loss that will never go away.
	   My heart goes out to their family, I know it seems so unfair.
	   Just remember we will all meet again when we go up there _ life
will be so much easier and there will be no violence.
	   Father, we pray in memory of these precious little boys,
	   There will be no more evil ploys.
	   Oh Lord, please let the evil people be brought to justice some
day.
	   And help everyone through this terrible time
	   That brings sadness to every home and every room.
	   Richard, Mark and Jason, in our memories you will stay.
	   I can still feel the cold, wet lips of when I kissed you and
then you ran away.
	   So I guess the next few lines are going to have to be goodbye.
	   I miss you so much, your little lips long to touch.
	   Kisses and hugs _ Rest In Peace.

Procter &AMP; Gamble Co. to increase investments in Ukraine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - The Procter &AMP; Gamble Co. plans to invest
dlrs 230 million in Ukraine over the next five years, according to
a report Tuesday.
	   P&AMP;G plans to use the funds to upgrade the Tambrands factory at
Boryspil near Kiev, its main producer of women's hygienic products
for Europe, the Kyiv Post reported.
	   Investments also would be channeled into manufacturing new
products in the former Soviet republic, further developing
distribution infrastructure and increasing brand marketing
activities, the report said, citing Herbert Schmitz, P&AMP;G's
president for Central and Eastern Europe.
	   The announcement of new investments came despite earlier
troubles which the Cincinnati-based company has experienced in
Ukraine.
	   In March, the government canceled certificates covering about
half of the products P&AMP;G marketed in the country and ordered it to
suspend sales and advertising of the affected goods. The move came
after a dispute about import and sales certification requirements.
	   Schmitz told Kyiv Post the problems had since been resolved.
However, like many foreign investors, he said Ukraine's investment
climate left much to be desired.
	   ``We expect that the government will help to create favorable
conditions for investment,'' Schmitz said. ``Much has still to be
done in the areas of trademark protection, acceptance of
international accounting practices, tax and customs.''

Group dismisses safety fears over silicone breast implants but
</HEADLINE>
calls for tougher controls &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A government review dismissed fears over the
safety of silicone breast implants Tuesday, rejecting a U.S.-style
ban on cosmetic implants, but called for tougher controls over
their use.
	   Thousands of women have claimed that leaking silicone implants
have caused a variety of problems ranging from memory loss and
partial paralysis to rheumatism and arthritis. Opponents have
called for the devices to be banned.
	   Developed in the 1960s, they have been outlawed in the United
States since 1992 and last week, American manufacturer Dow Corning,
the largest of the four producers of silicone implants, agreed a
dlrs 3 billion plan to compensate 170,000 women worldwide who
registered claims against them. None of the companies have admitted
liability.
	   While the British report concluded that the evidence does not
support claims that silicone gel implants can cause arthritis-like
illnesses, it called for further research into the possible health
risks associated with silicone leaking into a woman's body.
	   But the Independent Review Group on Silicone Breast Implants
said the information given to women receiving the implants was
``often inadequate'' and called for tougher guidelines.
	   It recommended a cooling-off period of several days between the
initial consultation and surgery, and that women should be warned
of the health risks and informed of the cost of future surgery to
replace the original implant. It called for Britain's voluntary
national breast implant register to be made compulsory and for
doctors to give a full money-back guarantee if women change their
minds before the operation.
	   Roger Sturrock, a professor of rheumatology at Glasgow
University who chaired the inquiry, said, ``in the final analysis,
the suggested link between these implants and any established
connective tissue disease does not stand up to scientific
scrutiny.''
	   The report has been endorsed by the British Association of
Plastic Surgeons and the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic
Surgeons.
	   The move was expected to infuriate anti-silicone campaigners.
	   Silicone Support U.K., which represents 2,500 women who claim to
have suffered ill health as a result of silicone breast implants,
described the situation as an ``absolute disgrace.''
	   Lesley Wildman, 39, of east London, had silicone breast implants
five years ago and claims to have been poisoned by the silicone
gel. ``Silicone has ruined my life,'' she said. ``I am in a
wheelchair, and I am housebound.''

Council calls on Congo, Rwanda to prosecute, ready to take other
</HEADLINE>
measures &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with reaction from human rigts group, TRIMS. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ A Security Council decision to let Congo
and Rwanda prosecute citizens for human rights violations _ and not
refer the cases to an international tribunal _ is inadequate
because justice won't be served, a human rights official said
Tuesday.
	   Congolese and Rwandan authorities haven't cooperated before in
investigating the alleged massacres of Rwandan Hutu refugees during
Laurent Kabila's sweep across Congo in 1996-97, said Suliman Baldo,
senior researcher in the Africa division of Human Rights Watch.
	   ``What counts is to identify the killers and punish them,'' he
said. ``And we don't believe that referring matters to Congolese
and Rwandan authorities is the course to achieve this end.''
	   A presidential statement endorsed late Monday by the 15-member
council called on Rwanda and Congo to use their own judicial
systems to prosecute suspects. It made no mention of suggestions by
U.N. human rights investigators that an international tribunal
prosecute the crimes if Congo and Rwanda are unable or unwilling to
do so.
	   But the council, apparently aware of this possibility, said it
was ready to consider ``additional steps to ensure that the
perpetrators of the massacres, other atrocities and violations of
international humanitarian law are brought to justice.''
	   It requested both countries report back to the U.N. chief by
Oct. 15 on progress made toward investigating and prosecuting those
responsible.
	   ``We find this statement very disappointing,'' Baldo said.
	   The tribunal recommendation was made in a report by the U.N.
human rights team which was pulled from Congo in April because of
what the United Nations said was a complete lack of cooperation
from the government.
	   The team was sent in August to investigate massacres of Rwandan
Hutu refugees allegedly carried out by Kabila's rebel forces during
their victorious march across the African nation of Zaire. In May
1997, Kabila took power in Zaire and renamed it Congo.
	   The Rwandan Hutu refugees had fled across the border to Zaire to
escape punishment for the 1994 Hutu-sponsored massacre of an
estimated half-million Tutsis. Rwanda's Tutsi-led government
supported Kabila in his successful campaign to oust Mobutu Sese
Seko.

British government to spend more on education, health
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain's Treasury chief promised Tuesday to spend
billions more on social services _ notably education and health _
drawing fire from opposition politicians who warned he was on a
risky spending binge.
	   Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown outlined a serious
shakeup in the way Britain spends taxpayers' money, saying agencies
must show real improvements in what he called ``front-line
services,'' such as classroom teaching, health provision and
crime-fighting.
	   ``It is money in return for modernization,'' Brown told the
House of Commons.
	   But political foes branded Brown's plans as an example of
spending gone out of control. The chancellor made his statement
after the Labor government of Prime Minister Tony Blair conducted
what it called a comprehensive review of Britain's public spending
priorities.
	   ``This is not a comprehensive spending review. It's a
comprehensive spending failure,'' said lawmaker Francis Maude, who
speaks on Treasury matters for the opposition Conservative Party.
	   Maude warned Brown: ``You risk spending us into recession.''
	   Brown outlined government spending plans for the next three
years and said the biggest increases will be an extra 19 billion
pounds (dlrs 31 billion) on education and an extra 21 billion
pounds (dlrs 34 billion) on the public health services.
	   Although Brown plans to spend billions more in areas ranging
from transportation to crime-fighting to museums, he insisted the
budgets will show surpluses for each of the next three years.
	   Brown promised budget surpluses starting at 7 billion pounds
(dlrs 11 billion) next year and rising to 13 billion pounds (dlrs
21 billion) by 2001.
	   But the Conservative lawmaker, Maude, said Brown's spending
plans were ``disguised through a series of accounting fiddles and
deceptions.''

McCaffrey seeks to soothe Dutch anger over remarks about Dutch drug
</HEADLINE>
policy &QL; 
 &UR; By MELISSA EDDY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- U.S. drug czar Barry R. McCaffrey sought
Tuesday to ease Dutch anger over criticism of their permissive drug
laws, saying he has ``high respect'' for the Netherlands despite
differences over narcotics policy.
	   McCaffrey, a retired general, visited the headquarters of the
U.N. Drug Control Program as part of an 8-day fact-finding tour of
Europe. But the tour has been overshadowed by McCaffrey's strong
criticism of the Dutch policy of allowing citizens to use marijuana
and other soft drugs for therapeutic and recreational purposes.
	   On Thursday, McCaffrey told CNN's ``Talkback Live'' that the
policy was an ``unmitigated disaster'' which had contributed to
crime in the Netherlands.
	   That prompted a sharp response from the Netherlands' ambassador
to the United States, Joris M. Vos, who said he was ``confounded
and dismayed'' by McCaffrey's description of the Netherlands.
	   ``I must say that I find the timing of your remarks, six days
before your planned visit to the Netherlands with a view to gaining
firsthand knowledge about Dutch drugs policy and its results,
rather astonishing,'' Vos wrote McCaffrey.
	   On Tuesday, McCaffrey's spokesman, Robert Housman, issued a
statement expressing concern that the Dutch government was being
``pulled into an internal political debate'' in the United States
by those who support decriminalizing drugs.
	   ``These legalizers put American children at risk,'' the
statement said. ``The Dutch government should be renouncing them,
not siding with them ... Every nation is free to set their own
policies domestically. However, other nations must respect the
sovereignty of others and be keenly aware of the impacts of their
policies on the global community.''
	   Asked about his criticism of the Dutch, McCaffrey told a press
conference that ``we believe a frank exchange of views among
friends is most productive. We have a high respect for the Dutch.''
	   McCaffrey arrives in the Netherlands on Thursday after a visit
Wednesday to Switzerland. The Swiss maintain a controversial
program of state-distribution of small amounts of heroin and other
hard drugs to selected addicts under strict medical supervision.
	   McCaffrey said he was looking forward to his visit to the
Netherlands. His spokesman said McCaffrey would take a ``hard but
objective'' look at the Dutch program.
	   McCaffrey's visit is aimed at underscoring the need for
international cooperation on combating drugs and to examine
European treatment and prevention programs.
	   McCaffrey arrived here from Sweden. He is also to visit Portugal
and England on the tour.

Germany arrests two more suspects in beating of French policeman
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOVER, Germany (AP) _ Two more Germans have been arrested in
last month's severe beating of a French policemen during rioting
that followed a World Cup match in France, police said Tuesday.
	   A 23-year-old man from Herne and a 33-year-old man from
Gelsenkirchen, both in North Rhine-Westphalia state, were arrested
Monday based on witness testimony and media photos of the rioting,
police in Hanover said. The suspects' names were not released. Two
Germans previously were arrested in France, and one in Hamburg.
	   Policeman Daniel Nivel has been in a coma since hooligans beat
him with an iron bar June 21 in rioting that followed a
Germany-Yugoslavia match at Lens, in northern France. Doctors say
he has permanent brain damage.
	   The beating was the worst of the violence that erupted in
several French cities hosting the five-week soccer championship
before it ended Sunday with France winning the final.
	   In all, more than 200 people have been arrested.
	   The Lens incident prompted Germany to tighten controls at its
border with France for remainder of the World Cup matches. Some
suspected German hooligans were turned back at the border.

Investors withdraw from Ukraine but central bank promises
</HEADLINE>
stabilization &QL; 
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - Foreign investors have begun to withdraw
from Ukraine's financial market, putting extra pressure on the
national currency, the hryvna, the country's central bank said
Tuesday.
	   Foreigners repatriated dlrs 130 million kept in government bonds
over the first nine days of July, double the figure for the
corresponding period in June, the National Bank said in a
statement.
	   The increasing pressure on the hryvna created by the exodus
forced the bank to spend dlrs 150 million of its reserves since the
beginning of July to support the currency. That is six times what
the bank spent over the same period in June.
	   The hryvna slipped to 2.11 per U.S. dollar Tuesday, down from
2.06 at the beginning of July. The government has pledged to keep
the currency within the trading band of 1.8 to 2.25 hryvna per U.S.
dollar by the end of 1998.
	   National Bank chief Viktor Yuschenko said Tuesday the situation
remained under the bank's firm control. He said the bank was slowly
lowering the value of the hryvna so it would spend less of its
reserves, which have decreased by dlrs 300 million to dlrs 1.7
billion in recent months.
	   Yuschenko said Ukraine's successful negotiations with the
International Monetary Fund last week provided hope for quick
stabilization.
	   ``Our policies are supported (by the IMF), which will allow us
to control our financial market this year,'' Yuschenko told a news
conference.
	   A high-ranking government delegation met with IMF executives in
Washington last week and the sides reached understanding on a new
dlrs 2.5 billion loan for Ukraine, according to Yuschenko.
	   The disbursement of a huge aid package to Russia, whose
financial markets greatly influence those in Ukraine, was also a
positive sign, he added.
	   ``Foreign investors will react positively to the changes very
soon,'' said Yuschenko.
	   An IMF mission will arrive in Kiev next week, and government
officials have expressed hope the fund's delegation will decide to
recommend to the IMF board of directors that it approve the
three-year, dlrs 2.5 billion loan for Ukraine.
	   Yuschenko said first signs of stabilization may already appear
next week when the Finance Ministry is expected to launch a few new
foreign borrowing projects.
	   Ukraine badly needs foreign financial aid. The government does
not have enough money to repay huge sums in foreign and domestic
debt in the next few months, and blames poor revenue collection.

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and the
leaders of Congo and Namibia on Tuesday said they had agreed a
``security pact'' to prevent Jonas Savimbi, the leader of Angola's
former rebel movement, from undermining the country's peace
process.
	   After three hours of talks here, the three heads of state issued
a written statement appealing to Savimbi to ``rejoin the (Angolan)
peace process.''
	   Dos Santos invited Congo's President Laurent Kabila and
Namibia's President Sam Nujoma for talks apparently aimed at
increasing pressure on Savimbi, who has been dragging his feet on
the implementation of Angola's 1994 peace deal.
	   The 1994 deal ended a two-decade civil war betwen the government
and Savimbi's UNITA rebels, but its implementation is running years
behind schedule.
	   In their statement, the three presidents said they would ``take
action to dissuade the UNITA leader from carrying out actions which
jeopardized the security of their countries as well as regional
peace and stability.''
	   Details of the intended measures were not given, although UNITA
is believed to have secret bases in remote areas of the Congo, on
Angola's northern border, and in Namibia, to the south.
	   Dos Santos provided troops to help Kabila's overthrow of
President Mobutu, a Savimbi ally, last year, and in the past has
threatened to launch attacks into Namibia to crush alleged UNITA
bases there.
	   UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola _ is refusing to hand over its central
highland strongholds to the government despite pressure for the
United Nations which brokered the peace agreement.
	   The government has blamed UNITA for recent attacks on police and
civilians in rural areas of Angola which threaten to derail the
peace process. It has also claimed that UNITA is keeping armed men
hidden in the bush of the vast southwest African nation.
	   The former rebel group has denied the allegations.

Trainer changes story, says drugs were for his team
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LILLE, France (AP) _ An official with the Festina cycling team
has told a magistrate he was carrying performance-enhancing drugs
in his car for his team _ not for his personal use as he said
earlier, judicial sources said Tuesday.
	   Previously, Willy Voet, 53, had said the drugs were for his own
use and had nothing to do with his team.
	   Voet was placed under formal investigation and detained last
week after customs officials in the French-Belgian border town of
Neuville-en-Ferrain discovered anabolic steroids in his car, which
was painted with Festina colors.
	   The judicial sources, speaking on customary anonymity, said Voet
has changed his story and now says he was acting under team's
orders.
	   Festina, one of 21 teams riding in this year's Tour de France,
is among the favorites.
	   Team director Bruno Roussel, asked Tuesday about the
accusations, called them ``absurd.''
	   ``It's absurd the information published today by the press,'' he
said. ``I don't understand it at all.
	   ``To stop the tour is out of the question. These are riders who
work all year long and train a lot in order to get there, who have
done nothing wrong. All that I know is that they have done nothing
bad.''

Some German spelling and grammar changes going into effect Aug. 1
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Germany-Language Reform &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Some examples of German spelling and grammar changes agreed by
officials from Germany, Switzerland and Austria in 1996. The
changes are to take effect in Germany on Aug. 1.
	   ---
 &UR; Spelling
	   _Use of the time-honored German letter for a double ``s'' _
which looks roughly like a capital B _ is curtailed. It remains in
use after a long vowel sound, but is replaced with ``ss'' after a
short vowel sound. The German word for ``keg'' becomes ``Fass.''
	   _Both foreign and Germanized spellings allowed for many foreign
words: ``Chicoree'' and ``Schikoree'' for chicory; ``Joghurt'' and
``Jogurt.''
	   ---
 &UR; Compound verbs
	   _Limits on the German penchant for stringing together nouns and
verbs in lengthy compound verbs and gerunds. Bicycle riding will be
``Rad fahren'' instead of ``radfahren.''
	   ---
 &UR; Capitalization
	   _More words to be capitalized. Nouns already are capitalized in
German, but now many other situations will require capital letters
as well.
	   ---
 &UR; Comma rules
	   _Rules that keep German thick with commas are simplified. Commas
will no longer be necessary between independent clauses separated
by ``and'' or ``but,'' and in several other cases.

Briton proposes cease-fire to deliver aid in southern Sudan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INCORPORATES BC-Sudan-Fighting and Famine &QL; 
 &UR; By DIANNA CAHN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ A British official met Tuesday in the
Kenyan capital with senior Sudanese rebels in an effort to arrange
safe passage for relief aid to millions in southern Sudan
threatened by civil war and famine.
	   And the U.N. food agency said heavy fighting between rebels and
government troops in southern Sudan has driven thousands of people
from their villages into the remaining government-held towns
southwestern Bahr el-Ghazal region.
	   ``Some of the women and children are horrendously
malnourished,'' said Ismat Fahmi, WFP deputy representative in the
Sudanese capital, Khartoum. ``More and more we are hearing that
lack of food, disease and raids by armed men are big factors,
forcing entire communities to flee their villages in northern Bahr
el-Ghazal.''
	   Derek Fatchett, Foreign and Commonwealth Office Minister, said
he was leaving later Tuesday for Khartoum to hold similar talks
with government officials.
	   He was proposing a three-month cease-fire along three key road,
river and rail routes into southern Sudan.
	   ``We cannot turn our back on their plight,'' Fatchett told
reporters. ``For them, the political settlement may be too long in
coming. That is why the notion of safe aid corridors is so
important.''
	   The governor of southern Warap state in Bahr el-Ghazal said food
shortages and hunger will increase unless the government and relief
organizations come to its aid.
	   ``We are expecting the situation to get even worse ... if no
remedy is reached concerning the relief situation and assistance by
both the federal government and the local and international
non-government organizations,'' Arop Acheir was quoted as saying in
the Khartoum independent daily Akhbar Al-Sa'a.
	   Rebels of the Sudan People's Liberation Army have been fighting
the Khartoum government since 1983 for autonomy for the Christian
and animist south from the Arab and Muslim north.
	   An estimated 1.5 million people have died in the fighting and
accompanying famine. International relief agencies say fighting and
lack of funds are preventing them from reaching the worst-hit
areas.
	   The safe corridors Fatchett pointed out on a map all lead to
Bahr el-Ghazal from Ethiopia by rail, by boat down the Nile River
and by road from Uganda.
	   The government-held provincial capital, Wau, where WFP said
50,000 people have already converged, is the terminus for both road
and rail routes.
	   Other relief agencies reported mounting death tolls Tuesday as
fighting continued to prevent food from reaching the worst-affected
areas.
	   Fatchett said aid agencies currently spend 90 percent of their
funds to transport food to the area by air and that only 10 percent
goes for food and emergency supplies.
	   He said officials of the Sudan Peoples' Liberation Movement, the
political arm of the SPLA, voiced ``no objections in principle to
the idea,'' but raised detailed points that needed to be explored.
He did not elaborate.
	   Fatchett said monitoring a cease-fire would be very difficult
and suggested that a small force of monitors was preferable.
	   ``Any cease-fire we know that works is one in which the parties
have confidence. When we are talking about delivering aid, I think
the best way to monitor is to have that light touch,'' the British
official said.
	   He said he was encouraged that the international community
appeared to be closely watching developments in Sudan, a
development he said could indicate more international involvement
in ending the conflict.
	   He said Britain was putting forth the proposal under the
auspices of the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development, a
regional grouping of countries in eastern Africa and the Horn of
Africa which has been trying to broker a negotiated settlement to
the 15-year war.

Procter and Gamble Co. to increase investments in Ukraine
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to remove ampersands &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - The Procter and Gamble Co. plans to invest
dlrs 230 million in Ukraine over the next five years, according to
a report Tuesday.
	   The company plans to use the funds to upgrade the Tambrands
factory at Boryspil near Kiev, its main producer of women's
hygienic products for Europe, the Kyiv Post reported.
	   Investments also would be channeled into manufacturing new
products in the former Soviet republic, further developing
distribution infrastructure and increasing brand marketing
activities, the report said, citing Herbert Schmitz, Proctor and
Gamble's president for Central and Eastern Europe.
	   The announcement of new investments came despite earlier
troubles which the Cincinnati-based company has experienced in
Ukraine.
	   In March, the government canceled certificates covering about
half of the products Proctor and Gamble marketed in the country and
ordered it to suspend sales and advertising of the affected goods.
The move came after a dispute about import and sales certification
requirements.
	   Schmitz told Kyiv Post the problems had since been resolved.
However, like many foreign investors, he said Ukraine's investment
climate left much to be desired.
	   ``We expect that the government will help to create favorable
conditions for investment,'' Schmitz said. ``Much has still to be
done in the areas of trademark protection, acceptance of
international accounting practices, tax and customs.''

At Royal Birkdale, the answer is blowing in the wind
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SOUTHPORT, England (AP) _ Unlike a U.S. Open course, Royal
Birkdale doesn't need a lawn mower to bring the world's best
golfers to their knees.
	   Just let that wind blow in from the Irish Sea, the way it has
for the first few practice rounds of the British Open, and the
toughest test of golf takes on a whole new meaning.
	   ``It was hard just to walk forward,'' U.S. Open champion Lee
Janzen said.
	   Janzen was the only player to match par last month at The
Olympic Club in San Francisco, where the fairways were mowed so
tightly they rolled like linoleum floors, sending seemingly safe
tee shots scurrying into unforgiving rough.
	   If the gusts stay the same when the 127th Open championship
begins Thursday, par might be enough to win the Claret Jug.
	   ``It's the toughest par 70 I've ever played,'' Ernie Els said.
``I would say it's even tougher than Olympic Club if it blows like
this.''
	   The wind can be measured either by speed _ gusts up to 40 mph
(65 kph) that whip over the sand dunes framing just about every
hole at Royal Birkdale _ or by club selection.
	   During a practice round Monday, Tiger Woods hit a 3-iron all of
152 yards (139 meters) on No. 7, the 177-yard (162 meters) par 3.
	   ``Somebody said it's a two-club wind,'' said Masters champion
Mark O'Meara, shaking his head. ``I know that Tiger can hit a
9-iron 157 yards (144 meters) pretty easily with no wind, and he
hit a 3-iron.''
	   Do the math.
	   Royal Birkdale measures 7,018 yards (6,415 meters), plenty long
for a par 70, with plenty of trouble lurking in pot bunkers down
the side of the fairways and the foot-high (0.3 meter-high) meadow
rye in the rough, which looks like a Kansas wheat field.
	   Add the wind, and Birkdale becomes the ultimate test of
patience.
	   ``Obviously, the conditions play an important role any time you
play in an Open championship,'' said O'Meara, who finished third at
Birkdale in 1991 and who won a European tour event there in 1987.
``This will be no exception.''
	   Remember the fuss over the 468-yard (428 meters) 17th hole at
Olympic that played as a par 4? With wind as strong as it's been
this week, Birkdale has about four of those under these conditions.
	   ``On the second hole, 410 yards (375 meters), I hit two drivers
and did not get there,'' said 1996 British Open champion Tom
Lehman.
	   That's the challenge facing Justin Leonard, trying to become the
first back-to-back British Open champion since Tom Watson in 1983,
young guns like Woods, Els, David Duval and England's Lee Westwood,
and the veterans like O'Meara, Lehman, Watson and Nick Price.
	   And it could be quite an experience for two heralded amateurs _
Matt Kuchar, the U.S. Amateur champion who tied for 21st at the
Masters and 14th at the U.S. Open, and 18-year-old Spanish phenom
Sergio Garcia, the British Amateur champion.
	   ``Everything about it is difficult,'' Garcia said.
	   The field of 156 players also includes Gary Player, appearing in
his 43rd consecutive Open, but not Jack Nicklaus, who at age 58 is
ending his remarkable streak of 146 consecutive majors.
	   Heavy spring rains in England have left the fairways green and
lush, unlike the yellowish, dry conditions of 1991 when Ian
Baker-Finch tied the Open record with a 130 on the weekend for an
8-under 272, the lowest score ever at Birkdale.
	   Whether anyone can get close to that score depends on the wind.
	   And the wind could very well determine which players will be in
contention Sunday. The toughest of circumstances tends to eliminate
most everyone.
	   ``I'm not sure this suits anybody's game,'' Lehman said. ``If
you do not hit it solid, you have no chance whatsoever of
winning.''
	   Most of the attention so far has centered around Westwood,
partly because he represents Britain's best hope to win the Open
since Nick Faldo in 1992 and partly because he is one of the
hottest players.
	   Westwood has won seven times on four continents in the past
seven months, including on the PGA Tour in New Orleans the week
before the Masters. He is coming off a victory last week at Loch
Lomond, which gave him the lead over Colin Montgomerie on the
European money list.
	   ``There was a lot of hard work that went into my game before the
last seven or eight months,'' Westwood said. ``It paid off with a
bang. Like any sport, you start getting a few good results, your
confidence grows. And when your confidence grows, you feel you're
unbeatable.''
	   But that feeling can be fleeting when the wind howls off the
Lancashire Coast. Just ask David Duval, a five-time winner since
October and a runner-up at the Masters.
	   ``I don't know how they rounded the golf course to make it seem
like every hole plays into the wind,'' Duval said. ``I guess you
get a break on 17 and 18. Other than that, it just beats you to
death.''
	   British odds makers list Woods and Westwood the favorites. At
this rate, the safe bet is on Birkdale.

Gucci's ex-wife says obsession with murder backfired into
</HEADLINE>
blackmail &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: for AMS. Updates throughout &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ The ex-wife of slain fashion heir Maurizio
Gucci testified Tuesday that her obsession with killing Gucci
backfired into blackmail.
	   Patrizia Reggiani Martinelli admitted she tried to find someone
to kill Gucci, but said she never carried out the plan. Others did,
then blackmailed her, she testified.
	   Taking the stand for the first time since the trial began in
May, the once-glamorous Reggiani Martinelli appeared without
make-up, her dark hair pulled into a sedate bun.
	   She is on trial for Gucci's 1995 murder along with four other
alleged co-conspirators. Three have confessed; only Reggiani
Martinelli and the alleged triggerman say they are innocent.
	   Reggiani Martinelli admitted Tuesday that she'd repeatedly asked
those around her, including her servants, her lawyer and her
confidant, the psychic Pina Auriemma, to find someone to kill
Gucci.
	   But she insisted she never followed through on what she admitted
was an ``obsession'' with murdering Gucci, who left her in 1985.
	   She said that a few days after Gucci was gunned down on the
steps to his office on March 27, 1995, Auriemma told her his murder
was a ``present,'' demanded hush money and threatened her.
	   ``You are now our golden egg,'' Auriemma said, according to
Reggiani Martinelli.
	   Auriemma has testified to a different version of events, saying
she was only an intermediary between Reggiani Martinelli and the
killers.
	   Reggiani Martinelli described herself as a virtual ``hostage''
to the blackmailers. She said she had to call Auriemma every day
and even take her on vacations on the Gucci yacht.
	   Court-appointed psychologists watched her calm, self-possessed
testimony attentively, taking notes. Reggiani Martinelli's defense
is expected to hinge on a court-ordered psychiatric evaluation to
be presented in October.
	   Her lawyers claim that a 1992 brain tumor operation left her
unable to reason well enough to carry out a murder plot.
	   Her testimony is scheduled to resume on Friday.

Serbian opposition meets with Kosovo Albanians
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with comments by opposition leaders,
detail about Serb attack. &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian opposition leaders and
ethnic Albanian representatives agreed Tuesday that a solution to
the Kosovo conflict can only be achieved by peaceful means.
	   In their own search for peace in Kosovo, the opposition leaders
on Tuesday met in the troubled province with local Serb politicians
and ethnic Albanians.
	   The ``Alliance for Change'' includes the most prominent
opposition parties and is led by former Yugoslav Premier Milan
Panic, a Serbian-American businessman.
	   ``The absolute priority is to establish peace and security in
Kosovo,'' said Zoran Djindjic, the leader of the Democratic Party
and former mayor of Belgrade.
	   But with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic _ who ordered the
police crackdown in Kosovo _ holding power in Serbia, the largest
of Yugoslavia's two republics, the mission has little more than
symbolic character, a fact recognized by the opposition leaders.
	   In Pristina, Djindjic acknowledged his delegation had no
specific mandate to negotiate with the Albanians, ``but we are
nevertheless very worried by the current situation.''
	   The delegation met with prominent ethnic Albanian officials
Fehmi Agani, Veton Surroi and Blerim Shalla.
	   ``I am satisfied that there is an agreement between us and the
ethnic Albanian side that a solution can only be found through
peaceful and political means _ and that there is no political goal
worth killing people for,'' Djindjic said.
	   Similarly, Vesna Pesic, leader of the Serbian Civic Alliance,
said: ``For peace in Kosovo, it is essential to end the hostilities
and stop the ongoing conflicts first. This is a central issue that
has to be agreed to by both sides.
	   ``I don't think it is possible to restart the dialogue until
there is a cease-fire,'' she added.
	   Fehmi Agani, the head of the Albanian team, said, ``We came to
the joint conclusion that the situation is unbearable. There are
not many differences in our views on that issue.''
	   But he reiterated the Albanians' routine call for independence,
which is opposed by all Serbs, including the opposition.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed since February, when
Milosevic launched the crackdown on Albanian separatists who had
been attacking Serb police and military facilities.
	   In fighting Tuesday, the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug said three
Serbian policemen were wounded in attacks by militants in the
Decani region, close to the border with Albania. The three were
expected to survive.
	   The ethnic Albanian Kosovo Information Center reported four
Kosovo Liberation Army fighters wounded in the latest fighting in
Stari Trg, a mine site just outside Kosovska Mitrovica, 35
kilometers (20 miles) northwest of Pristina. Five Albanian villages
were reportedly shelled.
	   The center later reported clashes since early morning close to
Djakovica, 75 kilometers (47 miles) southwest of Pristina, along
the border with Albania. Serb forces were shelling Junik and Nec
villages just northwest of Djakovica.

Fresh selling pushes coffee price down to 18-month low
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The average wholesale cost of coffee fell to an
18-month low on a wave of selling on European and American markets,
according to calculations released Tuesday by the International
Coffee Organization.
	   The intergovernmental agency put its latest daily market
indicator price at dlrs 0.9421 a pound, compared with dlrs 0.9657
dollars previously, and the lowest level since January 13, 1997.
	   Traders said that coffee was coming under selling pressure
because of the prospect of growing oversupply, thanks to the bumper
crop now being harvested in Brazil.
	   Also putting a lid on the market was the receding threat of
frosts in the giant producer's coffee zone this year, traders said.
	   ``The risk declines sharply from here and normally this is the
time of the year when a further sell-off is seen,'' said Lawrence
Eagles, commodities analyst at London-based futures brokers, G.N.I.
Ltd.
	   Trade organization records show that a freeze can strike
Brazil's coffee-growing region _ often seriously damaging the
following year's production potential _ from the end of May until
late August, although mid-June to mid-July is the most likely time.
	   Serious frost damage in 1994, which led to a sharp drop in
output from Brazil's 1995-96 (March-April) harvest, helped set the
Coffee Organization's indicator price on course for the near-record
high of dlrs 3.2598 a pound touched in May 1997.
	   Brazil is the world's biggest supplier of coffee, accounting for
around a third of global production.

Palestinian policeman sentenced to death for killing fellow officer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ A Palestinian police officer who shot
and burned a fellow officer to death was sentenced to die for the
crime Tuesday by a Palestinian military court.
	   The body of 22-year-old Hamdi Karajeh was found in a forest in
the West Bank city of Hebron on July 5th, a day after the killing.
	   Fahmi Tawil, a 27 year-old officer in the Palestinian
Preventative Security unit admitted he had killed him, saying
Karajeh had been harassing his wife, said Hassan Abu Namous, the
condemned man's lawyer.
	   Several Palestinians have been sentenced to death by Palestinian
security courts but Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has reduced
each sentence to life in prison.

Moi announces major cuts in his and cabinet salaries
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ President Daniel Arap Moi said Tuesday he
would take a 50-percent cut in salary and his two dozen ministers
would take 30-pecents cuts, his office said in a statement.
	   Moi said the cuts were in response to the economic hardships
Kenya is undergoing, the statement said.
	   A senior economist at the Central Bank of Kenya was quoted in
Tuesday's East African Standard saying the economy was essentially
``dead.''
	   Economic growth has dropped from 4.6 percent in 1996 to 2.3 per
cent in 1997. Preliminary figures for this year show a continuing
decline.
	   The statement did not say how much Moi or his ministers earn,
and this information is generally not available to the public.
	   Salaries of assistant ministers and members of parliament were
not affected.
	   About 287,000 unionized teachers are threatening to strike if
the government does not honor its pledge _ made during the run-up
to last year's general elections _ to grant them 200 percent pay
increases over five years.
	   The government has drawn up a bill, which if passed by
parliament, would effectively erase its commitment to raise
teachers' salaries.

Former Argentine junta leader formally charged in kidnapping cases
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ A former junta leader detained on
allegations of kidnapping children during Argentina's ``dirty war''
was indicted Tuesday, court officials said.
	   Jorge Rafael Videla, a member of the junta that seized power in
a 1976 coup, has been held since late June while a judge questioned
him on accusations of child abduction and forgery of identity
documents.
	   Videla, 72, is being prosecuted in connection with five cases,
including those of two children given to a former military doctor.
	   He will remain in jail until the start of his court case, with
bail set at dlrs 5 million, Federal Judge Roberto Marquevich ruled
Tuesday. Videla's lawyers are expected to appeal the decision to
prosecute him.
	   Details of Videla's next court appearance were not immediately
available.
	   ``Videla, in his capacity as commander of chief of the Argentine
Army, ordered a systematic plan to forcibly take possession of the
children of persons suspected of counter-insurgency,'' Marquevich
charged in the ruling.
	   The children's parents were among those who disappeared during
Argentina's ``dirty war,'' when thousands of political opponents,
mainly leftists, were tortured and killed by death squads.
	   Argentina says 9,000 people disappeared between 1976 and 1983
and are presumed dead, but human rights groups put the number
closer to 30,000.
	   Human rights group praised the indictment.
	   ``It's very good that the judge maintained this is something he
has not already been judged on,'' said Rosa Rosemblit, a leader of
the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo, a human rights group of
relatives of people who either ``disappeared'' or were imprisoned
during the dirty war.
	   Videla's lawyers had appealed his detention, contending that he
had already been judged and absolved of similar charges in 1985.
	   Videla was sentenced to life in prison that same year for human
rights abuses during the dictatorship. He was pardoned by President
Carlos Menem in 1990 along with all middle- and senior-ranking
officers.
	   In his first court appearance, Videla invoked his right to
refuse to answer questions before the judge and requested the case
be transferred to a military court.

Serbian opposition meets with Kosovo Albanians
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with comments by opposition leaders,
details about Serb attack. &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian opposition leaders and
ethnic Albanian representatives agreed Tuesday that a solution to
the Kosovo conflict can only be achieved peacefully.
	   In their own search for peace in Kosovo, the opposition leaders
on Tuesday met in the troubled province with local Serb politicians
and ethnic Albanians.
	   The ``Alliance for Change'' includes the most prominent
opposition parties and is led by former Yugoslav Premier Milan
Panic, a Serbian-American businessman.
	   ``The absolute priority is to establish peace and security in
Kosovo,'' said Zoran Djindjic, the leader of the Democratic Party
and former mayor of Belgrade.
	   But with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic _ who ordered the
police crackdown in Kosovo _ holding power in Serbia, the largest
of Yugoslavia's two republics, the mission has little more than
symbolic character, a fact recognized by the opposition leaders.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed since February, when
Milosevic launched the crackdown on Albanian separatists who had
been attacking Serb police and military facilities.
	   In fighting Tuesday, the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug said three
Serbian policemen were wounded in attacks by militants in the
Decani region, close to the border with Albania. The three were
expected to survive.
	   The ethnic Albanian Kosovo Information Center reported four
Kosovo Liberation Army fighters wounded in the latest fighting in
Stari Trg, a mine site just outside Kosovska Mitrovica, 35
kilometers (20 miles) northwest of Pristina. Five Albanian villages
were reportedly shelled.
	   The center later reported clashes since early morning close to
Djakovica, 75 kilometers (47 miles) southwest of Pristina, along
the border with Albania. Serb forces were shelling Junik and Nec
villages just northwest of Djakovica.

Rebels claim victory in large government offensive
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Sudanese rebels thwarted a major
government offensive in southern Sudan, killing 273 troops and
capturing heavy equipment including tanks and mortar launchers, a
rebel official said Tuesday.
	   The battle took place at the Upper Nile province town of Ulu,
about 160 kilometers (100 miles) southwest of Rosieres Dam on the
Blue Nile River near the Ethiopian border, which supplies most of
the electricity to the Sudanese capital, Khartoum.
	   Justin Yaac Arop, a senior official in the Sudanese People's
Liberation Movement, said government forces tried to retake Ulu,
which the Sudan People's Liberation Army captured in June.
	   But Arop said SPLA forces repelled the offensive, and 273
government troops and 15 rebels were killed.
	   There was no immediate comment on the claim from the Sudanese
government.
	   Arop said the SPLA also captured 25 prisoners of war, five
Soviet era T-55 tanks, two of which were destroyed, two armored
personnel carriers, seven mortar rocket launchers, eight trucks and
anti- aircraft and machine guns.
	   On Monday, a newspaper in Khartoum reported that Sudanese
President Omar el-Bashir visited the southern garrison town of Juba
and told the army that his government had ``decided to clean all
areas from the rebels.''
	   El-Bashir said an end to the rebellion was vital to the
country's economic progress.
	   ``We want the young men who are carrying guns, be they on our
side or on the other side, to come and build Sudan,'' the Akhbar
al-Youm daily quoted el-Bashir as saying.
	   Juba, a government stronghold in the south, is 1,200 kilometers
(770 miles), south of the capital, Khartoum.

Report: Rwandan population to swell to 11 million by 2012
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ The population of Rwanda, already one of
the world's most densely populated countries, is expected to swell
from an estimated 7.5 million to 11.2 million in 2012, according to
a U.N. survey.
	   The pressure of population and the shortage of land, a major
source of food in the country, could be a threat to social and
economic stability, U.N. experts familiar with the survey said
Tuesday.
	   The government has made accommodation of both Hutu and Tutsi
refugees a priority.
	   Before the 1994 Hutu-organized genocide of more than 500,000
minority Tutsis and politically moderate Hutus, Rwanda had a
population of about 7.5 million.
	   The victory by the Tutsi-led rebels, who stopped the killing in
July 1994, made it possible for about 800,000 Tutsi exiles to
return home. In addition, about 1.2 million Hutu refugees returned
in November 1996, occupying every inch of the land.
	   Rwanda occupies an area of 26,338 square kilometers (10,535
square miles) with the highest population density in Africa _ 409
persons on one square kilometer, according to the survey by the
U.N. Population Fund and Rwandan Ministry of Finance and Economic
Planning.
	   The survey was released on World Population Day July 11.
	   In northwestern Rwanda, where the Hutu rebels have killed
thousands of people since 1996, the density is almost double that
of the rest of the country _ 563 persons per square kilometer,
according to the survey.
	   During 1980s, Rwanda was self-sufficient in food production
after the area of planting had been increased to cope with the
population pressure.
	   But by the mid-1980s, the population growth had overcome food
production. Some population experts saw one of the reasons for the
1994 genocide to be the decline of availability of food, coupled
with the sharp drop in international coffee prices _ Rwanda's major
hard currency earner.

Northern Ireland buries three brothers killed in firebombing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BALLYMONEY, Northern Ireland (AP) _ On a cold, gray July day, in
the ``saddest of sad funerals,'' Northern Ireland said a
tear-filled farewell Tuesday to three young brothers incinerated in
a sectarian attack that came as they slept in their beds.
	   As a bell tolled mournfully, the small coffins of Richard, Mark
and Jason Quinn _ three boys born to a Catholic mother who were
being raised Protestant _ were carried into a rural Roman Catholic
church by strapping young men whose faces were contorted with
grief.
	   ``We meet in sorrow for the death of these children, but our
shared sorrow is a beacon of hope for all our community,'' said the
Rev. Peter Forde, Ballymoney's Roman Catholic parish priest. ``And
in this, our very troubled country, may it light our way ahead.''
	   The hundreds of Catholic and Protestant mourners who overflowed
the Church of Our Lady and St. Patrick cried throughout much of the
90-minute Requiem Mass. But it was a heartfelt poem written by two
young women who knew the boys that struck the deepest chord _ and
drew spontaneous applause.
	   ``Why would someone do this, is the question on our lips. Who
would have so much evil at their fingertips?'' one of the women,
Andrea Ramsey, read in a strong, clear voice.
	   ``Three jolly fellas, who had so much to learn and enjoy, have
been snatched away from us today,'' she continued. ``And we all
have a feeling of loss that will never go away.''
	   ``Richard, Mark and Jason, in our memories you will stay. I can
still feel the cold, wet lips of when I kissed you and then you ran
away.''
	   The crowd murmurred its approval of the line: ``Oh Lord, please
let the evil people be brought to justice some day.''
	   Tensions spilling over from a Protestant march blocked since
July 5 near Portadown, about 60 miles (100 kms) southwest of
Ballymoney, were blamed for the Sunday morning firebombing of the
Quinn house.
	   Authorities said they believed the family was targeted because
Chrissie Quinn, 29, lived there with her Protestant boyfriend. Two
men are being questioned in connection with the attack.
	   Throughout most of Tuesday's Mass, Ms. Quinn and the boys'
13-year-old brother Lee, who survived because he was spending the
night at his grandmothers', sat dazed and expressionless, still in
shock.
	   But grief was etched on the faces of the 12 men charged with
carrying the little white coffins up the aisle to the altar, who
found the task almost more than their emotions could bear.
	   Though four men were assigned a burden one man could easily
shoulder alone, members of each group leaned on each other for
support and comforted those who broke down as they entered the old
stone church.
	   Pictures of the smiling boys _ ages 11, 10 and 9 _ lay atop the
white coffins, alongside brass nameplates and crosses.
	   On what he called ``this saddest of sad funerals,'' the Most
Rev. Patrick Walsh, bishop of Down and Connor, told the
congregation that in the wake of the horrific killings ``voices
have been raised _ voices of sanity, voices of reason. Agonizing
words, words of self-examination, courageous words, words of
strength, words of healing have been spoken.''
	   He also made an indirect reference to the Protestant marchers'
insistence on parading through a Catholic neighborhood in Portadown
and the rippling violence it has touched off, saying, ``The weapons
of hate-filled words inevitably fuel weapons of murderous
destruction.''
	   Later, a sweet, lilting choir sang a hymn with the phrase ``if
you walk among the burning flames, you shall not be harmed,''
followed by the chorus, ``Be not afraid, I go before you always.''
	   Richard, Mark and Jason Quinn were buried in nearby Rusharkin,
where the Quinn family has its roots, in the Catholic ground of St.
Mary's Church.
	   Irene Quinn, the boys' grandmother, said her daughter wanted
them buried there so she never again would have to set foot in
Ballymoney. Chrissie Quinn was also insistent the boys have a
Catholic funeral.
	   Among the mourners were the firefighters who tried to save the
boys; Colin Parry, who lost a son in a 1993 IRA bombing in
Warrington, England; and Seamus Mallon, the Catholic deputy leader
of the new Belfast Assembly, set up as part of Northern Ireland's
fledgling peace plan.
	   ``The entire community must begin to work together at every
level to eradicate the evil of sectarianism and to ensure that all
of the problems that we have are solved by everyone _ whatever
their religion or political persuasion,'' Mallon said.
	   But mourner Kate Condy, 67, who tried to help heal the wounds
for years as a member of Northern Ireland's non-sectarian Alliance
Party, found she couldn't be too hopeful.
	   ``You would think something like this would shock sense into
people,'' she said. ``But the people who did this are
unshockable.''

	   SOWETO, South Africa _ Toddlers were singing the South African
anthem Tuesday as U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin strolled
into a day-care center that Francine Mbense built in her garage in
this black township.
	   Four years after white rule ended in South Africa, more than
half its blacks live in poverty, with no running water, much less
jobs.
	   Under pressure to provide more for a people long neglected under
apartheid, the government is looking at microenterprises funded by
government and foreign loans to help redress the imbalance.
	   Nakekelana Preschool _ Nakekelana means ``caring'' in Zulu _ can
now afford tiny tables and chairs, books and other materials for
the tots thanks to a 15,000-rand (dlrs 2,460) loan provided by a
South African company. The company received its own start-up
funding from the U.S. Agency for International Develelopment.
	   ``This is terrific,'' Rubin shouted to Mbense over the din of 39
young voices singing at full throttle. Told the childrens' parents
were working, with part of their salaries paying the tuition which
in turn was repaying the loan, Rubin shouted again: ``This is
terrific!''
	   But a discussion Rubin held later with finance officials, small
business entrepreneurs and government officials at Vista
University's Soweto campus showed the enormous challenge of
redistributing South Africa's wealth.
	   ``We tend to think we have found a panacea: all we need to do is
give away this money and they will be successful entrepreneurs,''
scoffed Bob Tucker, executive director of the Council of South
African Banks.
	   Small-business entrepreneurs backed up the point. Coming from
poor townships, undereducated and unused to dealing with the
business community, they said starting a business was trial and
error.
	   Still, there are successes. Simon Aphane, who runs the VITA
company that specializes in microenterprise loans, said it has
loaned 3.1 million rand (dlrs 508,0000) to 168 businesses,
including Mbense's, and has a 98 percent repayment rate.
	   Zanele Mbeki, wife of Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, said the
Women's Development Bank which she advises has made 12,000 loans to
5,000 clients.
	   ``Each client represents a job,'' she declared.
	   Ntombi Msimang, who owns a restaurant in Soweto specializing in
African cuisine, said she was cowed at first by the business
environment. But she recently summed up the courage to walk into
her bank manager's office and appeal for a lower loan rate.
	   ``I was paying 4 percent above prime rate, and I told him it was
too much,'' Msimang, her head swathed in a traditional
orange-and-blue cloth headdress, said in an interview.
	   To her surprise, the banker reset her loan 1 percent above the
prime rate.
	   ``What worries me is how few of the multitudes can do that, or
go sit down with a banker and say: `I have no collateral but I have
a plan that will make money,''' she said.
	   Banks are not eager make loans without collateral. Msimang's is
guaranteed by a program, funded by the government with a healthy
injection of foreign aid, so her bank faces no risk if she can't
make her payments.
	   With public funds already stretched to extend medical, education
and other benefits for South Africa's 43 million people, there is
not much left for seed money for small businesses.
	   One banker made clear he's not in the business of philanthropy.
	   ``I've got impatient shareholders I've got to deliver profits to
as soon as I can,'' said Mutle Mogase, an official of a division of
banking giant ABSA.
	   In a speech later at the Soweto campus _ interrupted when a rat
scampered across the stage _ Rubin complained about banking loan
practices that freeze out a majority of South Africans.
	   ``South Africa has a world class, sophisticated system of
banking and finance,'' Rubin said. ``However, access to credit is
very unequally distributed.''

Champion jockey questioned by police over party strip

<TEXT>
	   CHEARSLEY, England (AP) _ Leading British jockey Pat Eddery was
questioned by police Tuesday for allegedly stripping in front of
teenage girls at his daughter's 13th birthday party
	   Eddery voluntarily went to the Thame Valley police station for
questioning after a Sun newspaper report claimed he performed a
``Full Monty'' strip at Sunday's party in the Chearsley village
hall.
	   In a statement, the 11-time British champion jockey's lawyer
John Harding said Eddery went to the police as a result of
allegations appearing in the Sun newspaper.
	   ``He categorically denies the allegations made in the newspaper
about his behavior and will continue to assist the police in
whatever way he can,'' Harding said.
	   A Thames Valley Police spokeswoman said Eddery had been
interviewed but no charges had been filed and the investigation
would continue.
	   The Sun said Eddery stripped in front of 30 girls aged between
10 and 14 when the disc jockey played ``You Sexy Thing'' _ a hit on
The Full Monty movie soundtrack.
	   The paper said his daughter Natasha watched in horror as her
46-year-old father ``danced among her pals with his full manhood in
view.''
	   Eddery's wife Carolyn Eddery, a former British amateur ladies
champion jockey, denied the allegations.
	   Eddery rode two horses as scheduled at the Brighton races
Tuesday, finishing fourth on a 6-4 favorite in the first race and
last in the second race.

Telekom teammates Heppner is now fourth, Zabel 10th and Bjarne
Riis, the 1996 Tour winner, also from Denmark, 33rd. All a little
more than a minute behind.
	   TOUR TIDBIT: Chris Boardman is recovering from a concussion,
bruises and cuts but left the hospital following his hard fall on
Monday which cost him the overall lead.
	   QUOTE OF THE DAY: ``We hoped to win the stage but we got the
yellow jersey. We're content with this consolation prize,''
Hamburger on his attack with Casino teammate Pascal Chanteur in
getting only the overall lead.
	   THE NEXT STAGE: Wednesday's stage from Plouay to Cholet, 252
kilometers
	   (156 miles) along the westtern coast as the Tour slowly heads
south to the Pyrenees.

Blockbuster gives way to Bergman on his 80th birthday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ ``Titanic'' gave way to a titan Tuesday
when the movie theater in Ingmar Bergman's island village observed
his 80th birthday by taking the American blockbuster off its screen
and replacing it with ``Fanny and Alexander.''
	   The 1982 movie, Bergman's last, is regarded by many as the
height of a career of innovative and searching cinema.
	   Bergman is viewed as a national treasure by Swedes, even if
their mettle is tested by his films' emotional intensity and
sometimes-exhausting length.
	   The movie house in Faaroe, the Baltic island 175 kilometers (110
miles) southeast of Stockholm where Bergman lives, actually had to
cancel two movies to fit in the more than five-hour-long ``Fanny
and Alexander.'' Along with ``Titanic,'' the showing of ``As Good
as it Gets'' was suspended.
	   Bergman, who has remained active as a theatrical director,
delighted fans this year with the announcement that he was writing
a script for a movie to be directed by Liv Ullmann, renowned for
her acting in many of Bergman's films.

Anti-Censorship group criticizes Israel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ An anti-censorship group criticized Israel on
Tuesday for imposing what it said was a ``heavy censorship regime''
on the media in both Israel and the Palestinian controlled
territories.
	   ``The Israeli government interprets national security interests
far too broadly, using them as an excuse for heavy censorship, both
in Israel and the Occupied Territories,'' Frances D'Souza,
Executive Director of Article 19 said.
	   D'Souza said that Israel needed to implement institutional
reforms to safeguard press freedom and ensure access to
information.
	   It is wrong that Israeli, Palestinian and foreign journalists
have to exercise self-censorship on the basis of voluntary
censorship agreements, she said.
	   ``The lack of free debate and dearth of official information
about the security situation takes a heavy toll on informed debate
and leaves the door to prejudice and violence wide open,'' said
D'Souza.
	   Article 19, which takes its name from the free speech article of
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, is a privately funded
non-government organization based in London.

World Cup: Owner of Ronaldo's club blasts Brazil
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ The owner of Ronaldo's Italian club on
Tuesday blasted Brazil for allowing the star striker to play in the
World Cup final after he had convulsions.
	   ``The Brazilian federation behaved in an absurd manner. Its
actions could have had much more serious consequences,'' Inter
Milan owner Massimo Moratti told reporters after a meeting of Serie
A presidents. ``Now I only hope that Ronaldo has the chance to
rest, because he was put under unusual pressure.''
	   Brazil's team doctor said Monday that Ronaldo went into
convulsions for about 30 seconds just hours before Sunday night's
final and was feeling ``emotional stress.''
	   Dr. Lideo Toledo said he took the 21-year-old player to the
hospital for a battery of neurological and cardiac tests.
	   Ronaldo's name was not on Brazil coach Mario Zagallo's starting
lineup sheet issued 72 minutes before the final, but he did start
the match.
	   ``It was a serious mistake to have Ronaldo play in those
conditions,'' Moratti said.
	   The two-time FIFA Player of the Year was unimpressive and Brazil
was routed 3-0 by France, which benefited from two goals by
Zinedine Zidane.
	   ``I am not familiar with _ actually, I know very little about _
what happened,'' Moratti said, ``but nonetheless, even though
Ronaldo expressed the desire to play, I think someone should have
looked at him more as a person than a player.''
	   Moratti, who brought Ronaldo to Inter Milan from Spanish club FC
Barcelona in a record-shattering multimillion-dollar deal, said his
star has been given a month off by the club.
	   ``You all saw how good Zidane is,'' Moratti said. ``The best of
all, no? And yet Zidane was not put under the pressure Ronaldo was.
Zidane and France won the World Cup, but the front pages continue
to be about Ronaldo.
	   ``It is evident that a situation like that creates stress and
tiredness,'' he went on. ``In general, he handles everything in an
intelligent and balanced manner. This time, evidently, he wasn't
able to.''

World Cup: Coach vs. Newspaper war continues
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The war between France's main sports daily and the
now-revered coach of the nation's World Cup team is far from over.
	   In fact, it took an uglier turn Tuesday, with the L'Equipe
newspaper blasting coach Aime Jacquet in an editorial for not,
essentially, accepting its apology _ for having earlier questioned
his abilities.
	   The editorial was written by Jerome Bureau, the paper's top
editor, who before the Cup had criticized Jacquet as a coach and
questioned his methods of preparing for the tournament.
	   ``Yes, in the months before this World Cup, we criticized you
severely,'' Bureau wrote. ``As a coach, not as a man.''
	   But he added:
	   ``Nothing, Mr. Jacquet, justifies your calling us, myself and
the journalists here, `louts'' and `dishonest people.' Nothing
legitimizes the extreme violence of those terms.''
	   Bureau, recalling Jacquet's remarks on French TV after the
victory, called it ``sad'' that the coach ``preferred hate to
forgiveness.''
	   After France's stunning World Cup victory over Brazil, Bureau
had gone on French TV to publicly acknowledge that L'Equipe had
been wrong. He even said he'd offered to resign, but that his boss
had refused the offer.
	   But Jacquet said he'd never pardon those who had so harshly
criticized him.
	   Jacquet, who is stepping down as coach of the national team, is
now a full-fledged hero in France. On Tuesday, President Jacques
Chirac named him Chevalier of the Legion of Honor, one of France's
top honors.
	   And for days, adoring crowds have chanted: ``Merci, Aime!''

Canadian military crew heads to Guyana after fatal accident
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ A replacement Canadian military crew
left Nova Scotia on Tuesday for Guyana, where a bus crash has
claimed the life of a Canadian Forces airman and injured a number
of others.
	   Warrant Officer Don Richard McKinnon, 44, who was stationed at
the military air base in Greenwood, in the eastern province of Nova
Scotia, died as a result of the collision between the shuttle bus
and a truck on the way to Guyana's main airport.
	   McKinnon was part of an eight-member C-130 Hercules aircraft
crew that was delivering humanitarian aid to Georgetown, Guyana.
	   Two other Canadians, Capt. Jacques Simard and Capt. Mike
Goostrey, 29, were severely injured, suffering from multiple broken
bones. They and three others were in stable condition in hospital.
The remaining two were treated and released from hospital. Simard's
age was not immediately available.
	   On Tuesday, another crew from Greenwood was en route to Guyana
to bring home the injured and their Hercules.
	   The shuttle's driver and conductor were also injured in the
crash. The shuttle was carrying them to Cheddi Jagan International
Airport, about 40 kilometres south of Georgetown.
	   The bus slammed into the truck near the village of Pearl, about
12 kilometres (eight miles) from the airport, one of the passengers
told The Associated Press. McKinnon was apparently in the rear
seat.
	   Other members of the original Canadian crew were: Marc Laroche,
28; Michael Thornley, 27; Gaeton La Pierre, 38; and Kerry Plourde,
34. No information was available on the eighth person. Their ranks
were not immediately available. As well, officials could not
immediately confirm the exact spellings of their names.

Ketchup or ketschup? German court backs language reform
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ German is notorious for its run-on words,
thickets of commas and agonizing rules on capital letters. Not that
things are about to get easy, but a bit of relief is in sight.
	   After years of debate, Germany's highest court cleared the way
Tuesday for the first overhaul of written German in nearly a
century.
	   Opposed by leading authors and many ordinary Germans, the new
rules are to take effect Aug. 1, in time for the new school year.
	   Its backers say the reform simplifies. Still, much of it clearly
won't be a big help to people who don't know German already.
	   The spelling ``Ketschup'' will be allowed alongside ``Ketchup,''
because some words will gain new, more phonetically German
spellings.
	   The changes also try to bring German closer to English by
eliminating many comma rules to make writing snappier. Sentences
such as ``He's the man who came to dinner'' have needed a comma
before ``who'' in German but won't require it in future.
	   And Germans will no longer ``cleanup'' but ``clean up'' _ as in
``sauber machen.'' The reform separates many such strung together
composite verbs, which can run up to 20 letters.
	   Use of the time-honored German letter for ``ss'' _ which looks
roughly like a capital B _ will be limited.
	   Though Tuesday's verdict by the Federal Constitutional Court in
Karlsruhe said the changes were relatively minor, they still go too
far for some in this rule-loving country.
	   More than 100 prominent authors and academics signed an appeal
urging politicians to scrap it after officials from Germany,
Switzerland and Austria agreed on it in 1996.
	   Signers included Germany's best-known author Guenter Grass, who
wrote ``The Tin Drum.'' The appeal called the reform unnecessary
and said parts of it actually made German worse.
	   But the constitutional court now ruled against a couple who
argued the new system unconstitutionally deprived them of parental
control over their two school-age sons.
	   The unanimous decision doomed several other challenges against
the reform, and education officials said they now expect all German
schools to teach the new rules starting this fall.
	   ``The verdict creates clarity for many unsettled pupils, parents
and teachers,'' said Wolfgang Lieb, chairman of the conference of
state education ministers.
	   Opponents haven't given up the fight yet, though. A Sept. 27
referendum in Schleswig-Holstein would, if approved, legally bar
the state from applying the changes, creating new confusion.
	   Some schools have already started using the new rules. But to
allow Germans to get used to the changes, the old and new writing
styles will officially exist side-by-side until 2005.

Ecological group protests sea turtle deaths in Baja California
</HEADLINE>
Peninsula &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A leading environmental group urged Mexico on
Tuesday to fine a Mexican-Japanese salt manufacturer for the death
of some 300 sea turtles and to halt an expansion project in the
Baja California Peninsula.
	   The Group of 100 artists, writers and intellectuals reacted
after a government environmental prosecutor ruled the turtle deaths
in December were caused by an accidental spill of brine from the
salt works.
	   ``The prosecutor is showing his intention of justifying the
massive deaths of the marine turtles and covering up the pollution
of the lagoons this causes,'' the group said in a news release
signed by its president, poet Homero Aridjis.
	   Many gray whales which deliver their calves in the area were
also affected by the spill, the group said.
	   Exportadora de Sal S.A., 51 percent owned by the Mexican
government and the rest by Mitsubishi of Japan, is a massive
saltworks that evaporates huge quantities of sea water in the sate
of Baja California South. Its salt is exported, mainly to Japan
	   The works are centered around the Ojo de Libre, Guerrero Negro,
and the Vizcaino Desert Biosphere Reserve. It now plans to expand
the works to San Ignacio Lagoon, near Magdalena Bay, a wintering
ground for gray whales.
	   Exportadora de Sal said there was no one immediately available
for comment.

Israel ignores Palestinian areas in Human rights report
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INCORPORATES material from Israel-Human Rights,
Israel-Palestinian-UN, Jordan-Israel &QL; 
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a report to the United Nations regarding its
own record on human rights, Israel failed to mention violations
against Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
international human rights groups said Tuesday.
	   The London-based Amnesty International called the omission of
any mention of the Palestinian territories in the 369-page report
to the U.N. Human Rights Committee ``unacceptable ... especially
given the scale and seriousness of the human rights violations
perpetrated against their populations.''
	   Human Rights Watch, based in New York, said the report
``seriously misrepresents Israel's human rights record.''
	   Israel's Justice Ministry and Foreign Ministry, which prepared
the report, did not respond to the groups' assertions. Israel is to
present the report to the U.N. committee in Geneva on Wednesday and
Thursday.
	   Under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,
Israel is required to report on the situation in territories it
occupies, both groups said. Israel captured the West Bank and Gaza
Strip from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians hope to
establish an independent state on that land.
	   While the Palestinians have gained autonomy in major cities of
the West Bank and most of Gaza, Israel still exercises wide-ranging
control over their lives, and Israeli troops still deal daily with
the Palestinian population.
	   In January 1997, Israel signed a peace deal promising to
withdraw its troops from more West Bank land and turn it over to
Palestinian control, but has so far failed to do so.
	   Meanwhile, senior Palestinian officials said Tuesday they were
willing to meet with their Israeli counterparts in a last attempt
to break the 16-month deadlock over the troop redeployment.
	   The change in position came after U.S. Secretary Madeleine
Albright asked both sides to meet and try and settle key sticking
points which months of American mediation failed to resolve.
	   The United States has proposed a peace initiative which calls
for a gradual Israeli troop withdrawal from 13 percent of the West
Bank, with each pullback to be met by Palestinian security
gestures.
	   The Palestinians have accepted the U.S. initiative. However,
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he could not hand
over land until the Palestinians proved they were serious about
cracking down on Islamic militants.
	   The chief Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat, said Albright
wants Israel and the Palestinians to settle two issues in
face-to-face meetings _ the scope of the withdrawal and the
procedure for changing sections of the PLO Covenant which call for
Israel's destruction.
	   Erekat said the Palestinians are willing to hold direct talks
with the Israelis, but that they don't expect much from such
contacts. ``In principle, we are not against meeting,'' Erekat
said, adding that a final decision would be made once Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat returned from China on Thursday.
	   Palestinian officials also expressed disappointment over a
carefully worded U.N. Security Council statement Monday criticizing
Israel for seeking to expand Jerusalem's boundaries.
	   Palestinian Cabinet Minister Hanan Ashrawi said the statement,
which called the plan ``a serious and damaging development,'' fell
short of their expectations and will not deter Israel from going
through with the plan which will extend Jerusalem's municipal
authority to Jewish settlements in the West Bank.
	   And in Jordan, King Hussein, Israel's closest ally in the region
since the two signed a peace accord in 1994 urged the Israeli
government to make ``courageous and swift'' actions towards a peace
settlement. He said Wednesday that ties with Israel have not been
the same since the stalemate in Mideast peace talks.
	   ``We have not coordinated as we had coordinated in the past,''
Hussein told reporters during a meeting with Israel's opposition
leader Ehud Barak.

Former Miss Universe running for president finally talks substance
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEVEN GUTKIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Watching her lead in the polls
disappear, a former Miss Universe running for president of
Venezuela exchanged her vague campaign promises Tuesday for
substantive proposals.
	   Irene Saez told foreign reporters she would balance the budget,
improve tax collection and fill the government with ``people who
have come to give, not to take.''
	   For months, the 36-year-old candidate spoke about her ``love''
for the people and the need for a more ``human'' government. Now
she's pledging to avoid a currency devaluation and trim Venezuela's
notoriously bloated bureaucracy. She would also work to reduce the
country's dependence on oil, she said.
	   The switch may help Saez overcome a slide in the polls, most of
which show her trailing former coup leader Hugo Chavez by at least
10 percentage points. But her experimentation with different hair
and speaking styles - and the endorsement of a discredited
political party - seem to be hurting her chances for victory in
December's presidential race.
	   Saez, until recently the mayor of a well-run Caracas
municipality, had led all polls for nearly a year. Now, Venezuela
is alive with talk of Chavez, whose populist rhetoric has alarmed
the wealthy and won over millions of supporters in the shantytowns.
	   A slump in world petroleum prices is wreaking havoc on
Venezuela's oil-based economy, and attempts to open markets to
foreign competition have led to a popular backlash.
	   Saez spoke Tuesday of the need to keep markets free. Yet
Chavez's talk of a moratorium on debt payments and a halt to
privatization efforts appears to be winning the day.
	   When Saez, the 1982 Miss Universe, accepted an endorsement from
the Social Christian Copei Party in May, many Venezuelans saw it as
a sellout to powerful interests.
	   On Tuesday, she said she has ``never mortgaged the interests of
my community to any political party.''
	   Responding to critics who called one of her recent hairdos a
poor attempt to imitate Argentina's most famous populist, Saez
insisted: ``It was not a reference to Evita Peron.''

Yekaterinburg is about to lose its czar, but not everyone cares

<TEXT>
	   YEKATERINBURG, Russia (AP) _ After seven years of confusion and
debate, the bones of Russia's last czar and his family are about to
leave this Ural Mountains city for burial in St. Petersburg.
	   Not everyone is going to miss them.
	   ``What funeral?'' asked Sergei Koptelov, a taxi driver in his
20s, raising his eyebrows in surprise Tuesday. ``Didn't they bury
them the other day?''
	   Koptelov isn't alone in his lack of enthusiasm about the
elaborate plans for ushering away the bones of Czar Nicholas II and
his family, who met their end here at the hands of Bolshevik
executioners.
	   Throughout Yekaterinburg, many people cannot quite figure out _
or care about _ what is going on.
	   Despite comprehensive genetic tests carried out in Russia,
Britain and the United States, the Russian Orthodox Church has
refused to recognize the bones _ found in a pit outside town, and
dug up seven years ago _ as those of the royal family, and has
tried to minimize its role in the funeral.
	   President Boris Yeltsin decided to snub the burial after the
patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church, Alexy II, refused to take
part.
	   ``Local authorities lost all their interest in the funeral after
Yeltsin decided not to attend,'' said Mikhail Sinitzin, 35, a soft
spoken physician, standing in the middle of a dusty plot of land.
	   Here, a small wooden chapel marks the site of a house where
Nicholas, his wife, Alexandra, and their family spent their last
weeks in captivity before being executed in a basement on July 17,
1918.
	   ``Look at this desolation,'' Sinitzin said angrily, pointing at
a deep dirt track left by a truck that circled the chapel. ``They
did not even care to spruce it up.''
	   Yekaterinburg governor Eduard Rossel fought hard for the royal
remains to be buried in his city. He lost, and on Wednesday, the
royal skeletons will be taken from the Yekaterinburg city morgue
and placed into small wooden coffins. Hearses will drive them to
the Church of the Ascension of the Lord.
	   After lying in state overnight, they will be loaded into hearses
for the drive to the airport Thursday. They will be flown to St.
Petersburg and taken in a cortege to the Peter and Paul Cathedral,
the traditional resting place of Russia's czars.
	   The funeral will be held Friday, exactly 80 years after the
family's deaths.
	   In St. Petersburg, preparations neared completion Tuesday as
members of the Romanov clan, which ruled Russia for three
centuries, arrived from their homes in exile all over the world.
	   ``We want to make sure that we are not only burying the last
emperor of Russia, but that we also begin burying the horrid part
of our country's history _ the misery, the sacrifice, the losses of
life suffered by Russians of all social classes, not just the
czar,'' said Nicholas Romanov, the 75-year-old head of the Romanov
Family Association.

Romanian man opens fire on Gypsies, killing one and injuring six
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ A Romanian man fatally shot one Gypsy
and injured six others when spraying them with bullets from his
hunting rifle, Adevarul daily reported Tuesday.
	   The incident was sparked by a row between the 60-year-old man
and the Gypsies or Roma late Sunday in the western city of
Hunedoara, the paper said.
	   One of the Gypsies hit the man and he retaliated by firing two
rounds of bullets from his hunting rifle. Anghel Caolo, a
49-year-old Roma, died and six others, including a 14-year-old boy,
were wounded.
	   There were no further details. Romanians, who are prejudiced
against Gypsies, have occasionally torched their homes in the past
few years after fights between the two sides.
	   Officially, there are a half a million Gypsies in Romania,
although there are believed to be as many as 2.5 million.

Council extends Central African Republic peacekeepers with eye

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ U.N. peacekeepers will remain in the
Central African Republic through October under a Security Council
resolution approved Tuesday that sets the stage for U.N.
involvement in upcoming legislative elections.
	   The 15-member council agreed unanimously to extend the mandate
of the 1,400-member mission until Oct. 25.
	   The council called on the country to adopt a plan for the
elections, now scheduled for Sept. 30, ``and so enable the United
Nations and international organizations to make arrangements for
the provision of the necessary assistance.''
	   The Security Council authorized the peacekeeping mission in
March to replace French troops who had been in the country to help
enforce a peace agreement. Since May 1996, mutinous soldiers have
staged three major rebellions against President Ange-Felix Patasse.
	   His election in 1993 ended more than a decade of army rule.
French troops joined with government soldiers in each rebellion to
help protect the presidency. They were withdrawn in April as part
of France's reductions in defense spending.
	   The Central African Republic's U.N. ambassador, Antonio Deinde
Fernandez, told the council the peacekeepers had been indispensable
in promoting peace and security in the areas where they operate,
primarily the capital Bangui and its outskirts.
	   ``This is why the government and people of the Central African
Republic believe fervently that an enlargement of the mandate of
the mission to cover the entire country will enable the beneficial
effect of its presence to be felt countrywide and therefore further
the acceleration of national peace,'' he said.
	   In the resolution, the council said the peacekeepers could
conduct limited reconnaissance missions outside Bangui.
	   It also called on donor countries to provide more aid.
	   The U.N. force is comprised of primarily African troops from
Burkina Faso, Senegal, Chad, Ivory Coast, Egypt, Gabon, Mali and
Togo. France and Canada are the only other non-African country
playing a role.
	   Previous peace missions in Africa mainly have involved western
nations, with token military and diplomatic support from African
countries.

a deep dirt track left by a truck that circled the chapel. ``They
did not even care to spruce it up.''
	   Yekaterinburg governor Eduard Rossel fought hard for the royal
remains to be buried in his city. He lost, and on Wednesday, the
royal skeletons will be taken from the Yekaterinburg city morgue
and placed into small wooden coffins. Hearses will drive them to
the Church of the Ascension of the Lord.
	   After lying in state overnight, they will be loaded into hearses
for the drive to the airport Thursday. They will be flown to St.
Petersburg and taken in a cortege to the Peter and Paul Cathedral,
the traditional resting place of Russia's czars.
	   The funeral will be held Friday, exactly 80 years after the
family's deaths.
	   In St. Petersburg, preparations neared completion Tuesday as
members of the Romanov clan, which ruled Russia for three
centuries, arrived from their homes in exile all over the world.
	   ``We want to make sure that we are not only burying the last
emperor of Russia, but that we also begin burying the horrid part
of our country's history _ the misery, the sacrifice, the losses of
life suffered by Russians of all social classes, not just the
czar,'' said Nicholas Romanov, the 75-year-old head of the Romanov
Family Association.

Former Miss Universe running for president finally talks substance

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Watching her lead in the polls
disappear, a former Miss Universe running for president of
Venezuela exchanged her vague campaign promises Tuesday for
substantive proposals.
	   Irene Saez told foreign reporters she would balance the budget,
improve tax collection and fill the government with ``people who
have come to give, not to take.''
	   For months, the 36-year-old candidate spoke about her ``love''
for the people and the need for a more ``human'' government. Now
she's pledging to avoid a currency devaluation and trim Venezuela's
notoriously bloated bureaucracy. She would also work to reduce the
country's dependence on oil, she said.
	   The switch may help Saez overcome a slide in the polls, most of
which show her trailing former coup leader Hugo Chavez by at least
10 percentage points. But her experimentation with different hair
and speaking styles - and the endorsement of a discredited
political party - seem to be hurting her chances for victory in
December's presidential race.
	   Saez, until recently the mayor of a well-run Caracas
municipality, had led all polls for nearly a year. Now, Venezuela
is alive with talk of Chavez, whose populist rhetoric has alarmed
the wealthy and won over millions of supporters in the shantytowns.
	   A slump in world petroleum prices is wreaking havoc on
Venezuela's oil-based economy, and attempts to open markets to
foreign competition have led to a popular backlash.
	   Saez spoke Tuesday of the need to keep markets free. Yet
Chavez's talk of a moratorium on debt payments and a halt to
privatization efforts appears to be winning the day.
	   When Saez, the 1981 Miss Universe, accepted an endorsement from
the Social Christian Copei Party in May, many Venezuelans saw it as
a sellout to powerful interests.

Belarus says planned US-sponsored radio station propagandist
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ Plans to set up an U.S.-sponsored
independent Belarusian radio station in Poland will not improve
relations between the two neighbors, a statement from the Foreign
Ministry said Tuesday.
	   The station set up by Belarusian journalists is due to start
broadcasting to Belarus this fall from the Polish town of
Bialystok, 200 kilometers (125 miles) northeast of Warsaw, the
Polish daily Gazeta Wyborcza reported Monday.
	   The opening of the radio station ``will not contribute to the
traditionally neighborly Belarusian-Polish relations,'' the
Belarusian Foreign Ministry statement said.
	   Announcement of the plans for the station are a ``direct
propaganda pressure'' on Belarus and is linked to the eviction of
Western diplomats from their homes in Minsk, the statement said.
	   Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko remained adamant that
the diplomatic compound where the ambassadors lived was now the
official residence of the president.
	   ``They do not necessarily have to live 10 meters from the
president's residence,'' Lukashenko said Tuesday a visit to the
southeastern Gomel region.
	   Diplomats from the United States, Britain, Germany, France,
Greece, Italy, and Japan have returned home to consult with their
governments over the dispute. The Bulgarian and Polish ambassadors
also have been recalled home.
	   Lukashenko said Belarus was not afraid of international
isolation after the European Union and other countries said they
would no longer issue visas to Belarusian officials.
	   ``We will not respond to savage tools with savage tools,''
Lukashenko said. ``We are a more civilized nation.''

Doctors: Bowman's heart is OK
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with with medical report; CHANGES overline &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DETROIT (AP) _ Scotty Bowman was told Tuesday he shows no signs
of a heart problem, and he will have more tests before deciding if
he is healthy enough to return as coach of the Detroit Red Wings.
	   ``He has not had any symptoms of a heart problem and his EKG is
normal,'' said Dr. William O'Neill, chief cardiologist at William
Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak.
	   The 64-year-old coach of the Stanley Cup champions said Monday
he wouldn't be back ``unless my health is 100 percent.''
	   The results of a cardiac stress test were inconclusive, O'Neill
said. Bowman is to consult with the doctor and have further routine
diagnostic testing this week.
	   Detroit television station WXYZ reported Monday night that
Bowman's stress test last week was abnormal.
	   Bowman's brother Jack, a scout with the Buffalo Sabres, died
last month from heart problems at 59.
	   ``I underwent the toughest set of medical tests I ever
experienced,'' Bowman told the Toronto Star, ``and now we'll
discuss the results, exactly where I'm at.''
	   Bowman said he would leave a decision on retirement up to his
doctor.
	   ``I know my wife wants me to quit, but I also know she'll
support whatever the verdict is,'' Bowman said. ``We've agreed to
abide by what the doctor says.''
	   Bowman coached Detroit to a second straight Stanley Cup
championship last month, the eighth of his career.

SUBS item on Nigeria to ADD detail.

 &UR; Eds: Contains items on Uganda, Tanzania, Ghana, Nigeria, Portugal.
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ------
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Sudan, Britain and the United States have
been invited to attend a two-day peace conference organized Acholis
from northern Uganda that begins Friday in London.
	   Patrick Oguro Otto, chairman of the conference entitled
``Removing the Obstacles to Peace,'' told the government-owned New
Vision newspaper the three countries were invited because they are
home to a number of Ugandan political dissidents, some of whom are
involved in armed rebellion against the government of President
Yoweri Museveni.
	   The Lord's Resistance Army, which has been laying waste to
northern Uganda for 12 years, operates from bases in southern
Sudan, and LRA representatives live in London.
	   From Ugandan independence in 1962 until Museveni took power in
1986, people from northern Uganda _ Acholis and those from smaller
tribes _ controlled the country. Many now claim they are being
marginalized by Museveni and his colleagues, who come from the
south.
	   Oguro Otto said some 300 people are expected to attend the
Kacoke Madit (Acholi for peace meeting), including 60 from Uganda,
including Acholi members of parliament and government district
officials who are not Acholi themselves.

	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ A large brush fire is burning in
world-famous Serengeti National Park and has already burned 8 sq.
kms.
	   The Swahili language Nipishe said Monday it is believed the fire
was set by people who wanted to flush out the protected wild
animals that live there in order to kill them easily.
	   Tanzania's oldest game reserve covers 15,000 sq. km. along the
country's northern border with Kenya.
	   The newspaper did not say in what part of the park the fire was
burning.
	    &UR; ----- &QC; 
	   ACCRA, Ghana (AP) _ Ghana's energy crisis will persist unless
rainfall increases, a spokesman for the country's major
electricity-producing dam has said.
	   Ben Osei-Afeng, an official of the Volta River Authority which
manages the Akosombo Dam, said insufficient rains had left water
levels at the dam well below minimum operating levels.
	   Only two of six turbines at the dam were working, he said.
	   Since the beginning of the year, Ghana has experienced a severe
energy shortage forcing the government to resort to power
rationing.
	   To offset the crisis, the government has signed agreements with
several international companies to install power barges and plans
to set up new thermal energy plants.
	    &UR; ----- &QC; 
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Thousands of commuters lined up at bus
stops and petrol stations Tuesday as the nation's commercial
capital was hit by yet another severe fuel shortage.
	   In Lagos, motorists waited for hours outside gas stations where
``No fuel'' signs were posted.
	   Commercial vehicle operators hiked their fares by more than 100
percent along several routes, forcing hundreds of people to walk to
work, the national news agency NAN reported Monday.
	   Although the world's sixth largest oil producer, Nigeria has
been hit by recurring fuel shortages in recent years. Its four
state-run refineries have ground to a halt due to neglect,
mismanagement and corruption.
	   The latest crisis came as tanker drivers, fearing they would be
targeted by rioters, refused to bring supplies into Lagos after the
city was hit by waves of violence last week following the death of
imprisoned opposition leader Moshood Abiola. Over 55 people were
killed country-wide in clashes.
	   But by Tuesday afternoon, with the violence over, a few tankers
could been seen coming into the city and lines were expected to
shorten soon.
	   The shortages, which often keep much of the country waiting for
gasoline, have been particularly acute recently in Abeokuta,
Abiola's hometown. Filling stations have been closed there for the
past five days, the news agency reported.
	   Residents say the shortages were caused by fuel suppliers who
hoarded petrol, fearing their stations would be set ablaze by
rioters.
	   Initial autopsy results indicate Abiola, the apparent winner of
1993's annulled presidential elections, died of natural causes.
Many Nigerians, though, suspect he was killed by the junta.
	    &UR; ---- &QC; 
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Angolan state oil company Sonangol and
U.S. company Esso, a subsidiary of Exxon Corp., have discovered a
new oilfield in deep water about 360 kilometers (223 miles)
northwest of Luanda, according to a report here Tuesday.
	   The oilfield has an estimated production capacity of 16,000
barrels per day, according to an unidentified Sonangol source cited
by the Portuguese news agency Lusa.
	   The oilfield, named Hungo 1, is the third to be discovered by
Sonangol and Esso in Bloc 15, according to the report.
	   The previous two discoveries can produce 10,000 and 6,500
barrels per day, Lusa reported.
	   Other companies active in Bloc 15 are British Petroleum, Italy's
Agip and Norway's Norske Staps Oljeselskap.
	   Angola is sub-Saharan Africa's second-largest oil producer after
Nigeria with production of about 700,000 barrels per day.
	    &UR; ----- &QC; 
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Ministers from the seven-member
Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries, which includes five
African nations, were due to meet Tuesday in Cape Verde in West
Africa for the organization's second annual summit.
	   The foreign ministers were to be joined on Thursday by the
countries' heads of state and government.
	   The meeting, attended by delegations from Angola, Mozambique,
Guinea Bissau, Cape Verde, Sao Tome and Principe, Portugal and
Brazil, was to look at ways of deepening cooperation between its
members.
	   The Community recently has been criticized by politicians from
its member countries who complain the organization has had little
international impact since its creation three years ago.
	   Much of the blame for the inactivity has been directed at the
Community's executive secretary, former Angolan prime minister
Marcolino Moco.
	   The organization has also been restricted by the internal
problems of its African members. The meeting was expected to
analyze the two-month-old civil war in Guinea-Bissau, the military
and civil unrest in Sao Tome and Principe, and the delayed
implementation of Angola's 1994 peace pact.
	   Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso was not due to
attend.

Siberian miners reject appeal to lift rail blockade
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Striking Siberian coal miners Tuesday rejected an
appeal by the regional governor to lift their blockade of the
Trans-Siberian railway.
	   The leaders of strike committees in the mining towns of
Anzhero-Sudzhensk and Yurga said the blockade would stay in place
until the government meets their demands, the ITAR-Tass news agency
said.
	   Aman Tuleyev, governor of the Kemerovo region, Monday appealed
to the miners to lift their 11-day-old blockade, at least long
enough to allow a train laden with enriched uranium to pass.
	   The train, carrying the uranium to a nuclear power plant in the
Tomsk region of Siberia, has been stranded for several days and
poses a threat to the environment, Tuleyev said.
	   The miners rejected the appeal, and placed the blame for the
blockade on the government, ITAR-Tass said.
	   In a letter to the Russian Cabinet, strike leaders accused the
government of failing to meet commitments made under an agreement
that ended a blockade of the Trans-Siberian line in May, the news
agency said.
	   Miners are demanding the resignation of President Boris Yeltsin,
an overhaul of the economy and the immediate payment of salaries
that have gone unpaid for up to six months.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Sysuyev has said the government is
prepared to negotiate with the miners only if they lift the
blockade. The miners insist the blockade will stay in place until
the government meets at least some of their demands.
	   The stalemate has cost the region millions of rubles and has
forced some factories to shut down because of a lack of fuel and
equipment.

Israel ignores Palestinian areas in Human rights report
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with material from Israel-Human Rights,
Israel-Palestinian-UN, Jordan-Israel &QL; 
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a report to the United Nations regarding its
own record on human rights, Israel failed to mention violations
against Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
international human rights groups said Tuesday.
	   The London-based Amnesty International called the omission of
the Palestinian territories in the 369-page report to the U.N.
Human Rights Committee ``unacceptable ... especially given the
scale and seriousness of the human rights violations perpetrated
against their populations.''
	   Human Rights Watch, based in New York, said the report
``seriously misrepresents Israel's human rights record.''
	   Israel's Justice Ministry and Foreign Ministry, which prepared
the report, did not respond to the groups' assertions. Israel is to
present the report to the U.N. committee in Geneva on Wednesday and
Thursday.
	   Under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,
Israel is required to report on the situation in territories it
occupies, both groups said. Israel captured the West Bank and Gaza
Strip from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians hope to
establish an independent state on that land.
	   While the Palestinians have gained autonomy in major cities of
the West Bank and most of Gaza, Israel still exercises wide-ranging
control over their lives, and Israeli troops still deal daily with
the Palestinian population.
	   In January 1997, Israel signed a peace deal promising to
withdraw its troops from more West Bank land and turn it over to
Palestinian control, but has so far failed to do so.
	   Meanwhile, senior Palestinian officials said Tuesday they were
willing to meet with their Israeli counterparts in a last attempt
to break the 16-month deadlock over the troop redeployment.
	   The change in position came after U.S. Secretary Madeleine
Albright asked both sides to meet and try and settle key sticking
points which months of American mediation failed to resolve.
	   The United States has proposed a peace initiative which calls
for a gradual Israeli troop withdrawal from 13 percent of the West
Bank, with each pullback to be met by Palestinian security
gestures.
	   The Palestinians have accepted the U.S. initiative. However,
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he could not hand
over land until the Palestinians proved they were serious about
cracking down on Islamic militants.
	   The chief Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat, said Albright
wants Israel and the Palestinians to settle two issues in
face-to-face meetings _ the scope of the withdrawal and the
procedure for changing sections of the PLO Covenant which call for
Israel's destruction.
	   Erekat said the Palestinians are willing to hold direct talks
with the Israelis, but that they don't expect much from such
contacts. ``In principle, we are not against meeting,'' Erekat
said, adding that a final decision would be made once Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat returned from China on Thursday.
	   Palestinian officials also expressed disappointment over a
carefully worded U.N. Security Council statement Monday criticizing
Israel for seeking to expand Jerusalem's boundaries.
	   Palestinian Cabinet Minister Hanan Ashrawi said the statement,
which called the plan ``a serious and damaging development,'' fell
short of their expectations and will not deter Israel from going
through with the plan which will extend Jerusalem's municipal
authority to Jewish settlements in the West Bank.
	   And in Jordan, King Hussein, Israel's closest ally in the region
since the two signed a peace accord in 1994 urged the Israeli
government to make ``courageous and swift'' actions towards a peace
settlement. He said Wednesday that ties with Israel have not been
the same since the stalemate in Mideast peace talks.
	   ``We have not coordinated as we had coordinated in the past,''
Hussein told reporters during a meeting with Israel's opposition
leader Ehud Barak.

Union, passenger group criticize German railroad's planned cuts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ A railroad union and a passenger
association on Tuesday criticized a proposal by the Deutsche Bahn
railroad to cut nearly a fifth of its long-distance trains.
	   The railroad still must negotiate the proposed schedule changes
with Germany's 16 states, who might be forced to boost local and
regional trains to make up for the lost service.
	   Deutsche Bahn, which said Tuesday that none of the changes were
final, says it needs to boost profitability amid a decline in
passenger demand.
	   The company says the decline began before the June 3 crash in
northern Germany of InterCity Express 884, which killed 100 people.
	   Passenger demand in the first quarter of this year decreased 2
percent from the same period the previous year, and Deutsche Bahn
forecasts an overall 8 percent decline for the entire year.
	   The proposed cuts, according to Deutsche Bahn lists obtained by
The Associated Press, would mean about 18 percent less trains
running per day on key inter-city routes. Among those affected are
the Muenster-Frankfurt, Wuerzburg-Munich, and Berlin-Stralsund
routes.
	   The GdED union said the proposed cuts were too high and could
cost up to 1,000 railroad jobs.
	   The Pro-Bahn passenger association said cutting the number of
trains was the wrong strategy. Less trains would make rail
transportation even less attractive and cost the system even more
passengers, group spokesman Holger Jansen said.

Grand National deaths accidental
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A Jockey Club report into the deaths of three
horses at the Grand National steeple chase at Aintree on April 4
has concluded the cause of each fatality was accidental.
	   But the report recommended tougher rules for the next event to
improve safety standards, after only six of the 37 starters
completed the gruelling event.
	   An inquiry was called after the deaths of Pashto, Do Rightly and
Griffins Bar, which all fell independently of each other at the
first, third and fifth fences.
	   The inquiry found there was ``no causal link between any of the
fatalities and the heavy going, the condition of the course, the
height of the fences, or the number of runners.''
	   However, the inquiry team, after consulting with trainers,
jockeys, officials and animal welfare representatives, made several
recommendations to make the Grand National safer.
	   Major recommendations included the introduction of more
stringent vetting of horses before the race, reviews of
handicapping and enhancing of eligibility criteria for horses and
jockeys.
	   Another recommendation means that any horse declared for the
Grand National will be automatically banned from running if it
races in any other event within the five days before the race.
	   Griffins Bar, one of the fatally-injured trio this year, had
fallen at the second fence of an event on April 2 before lining up
again 48 hours later for the Grand National.
	   Charles Barnett, managing director at Aintree, said the the
executive accepted the report finding and would implement the
recommendations.
	   ``The Grand National is the world's greatest steeplechase but
while it is demanding it must always be fair and risk-minimised,''
he said.

Official: Hunger, disease have killed hundreds in Sierra Leone
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CLARENCE ROY-MACAULAY &QC;

<TEXT>
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ Hunger and disease have killed at
least 750 people who have crowded into a town in eastern Sierra
Leone over the past few months to escape fighting, a United Nations
aid official said Tuesday.
	   Thousands more people in the town of Massingbi, in Sierra
Leone's diamond-rich Kono district, are in danger from measles,
malnutrition and diarrhea, the official said on condition of
anonymity. He said fighting in the region was hampering the ability
of aid groups to reach the town.
	   Massingbi, which is about 200 kilometers (120 miles) from
Freetown, has swelled with inhabitants as residents have fled
fighting in towns throughout the Kono region.
	   A Nigerian-led intervention force known as ECOMOG drove Sierra
Leone's military junta from power in February, but continues to
battle the remnants of the renegade army and its rebel allies who
fled into the bush near the Liberian and Guinean borders.
	   Intervention force officials, who are now fighting on behalf of
President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah _ who they restored to the presidency
by driving out the junta _ say the rebels are weakened but still
able to fight.
	   Ousted junta fighters and the rebels have been blamed for
horrific atrocities, including murders, mutilations and rapes.
	   Thousands of civilians have been driven from their homes, while
scores have had hands and arms amputated, or have been tortured or
killed by the rebels.

Northern Ireland buries three brothers killed in firebombing

	   BALLYMONEY, Northern Ireland (AP) _ On a cold, gray July day, in
the ``saddest of sad funerals,'' Northern Ireland said a
tear-filled farewell Tuesday to three young brothers incinerated in
a sectarian attack that came as they slept in their beds.
	   As a bell tolled mournfully, the small coffins of Richard, Mark
and Jason Quinn _ three boys born to a Catholic mother who were
being raised Protestant _ were carried into a rural Roman Catholic
church by strapping young men whose faces were contorted with
grief.
	   ``We meet in sorrow for the death of these children, but our
shared sorrow is a beacon of hope for all our community,'' said the
Rev. Peter Forde, Ballymoney's Roman Catholic parish priest. ``And
in this, our very troubled country, may it light our way ahead.''
	   The hundreds of Catholic and Protestant mourners who overflowed
the Church of Our Lady and St. Patrick cried throughout much of the
90-minute Requiem Mass. But it was a heartfelt poem written by two
young women who knew the boys that struck the deepest chord _ and
drew spontaneous applause.
	   ``Why would someone do this, is the question on our lips. Who
would have so much evil at their fingertips?'' one of the women,
Andrea Ramsey, read in a strong, clear voice.
	   ``Three jolly fellas, who had so much to learn and enjoy, have
been snatched away from us today,'' she continued. ``And we all
have a feeling of loss that will never go away.''
	   ``Richard, Mark and Jason, in our memories you will stay. I can
still feel the cold, wet lips of when I kissed you and then you ran
away.''
	   The crowd murmurred its approval of the line: ``Oh Lord, please
let the evil people be brought to justice some day.''
	   Tensions spilling over from a Protestant march blocked since
July 5 near Portadown, about 60 miles (100 kms) southwest of
Ballymoney, were blamed for the Sunday morning firebombing of the
Quinn house.
	   Authorities said they believed the family was targeted because
Chrissie Quinn, 29, lived there with her Protestant boyfriend. Two
men are being questioned in connection with the attack.
	   Throughout most of Tuesday's Mass, Ms. Quinn and the boys'
13-year-old brother Lee, who survived because he was spending the
night at his grandmothers', sat dazed and expressionless, still in
shock.
	   But grief was etched on the faces of the 12 men charged with
carrying the little white coffins up the aisle to the altar, who
found the task almost more than their emotions could bear.
	   Though four men were assigned a burden one man could easily
shoulder alone, members of each group leaned on each other for
support and comforted those who broke down as they entered the old
stone church.
	   Pictures of the smiling boys _ ages 11, 10 and 9 _ lay atop the
white coffins, alongside brass nameplates and crosses.
	   On what he called ``this saddest of sad funerals,'' the Most
Rev. Patrick Walsh, bishop of Down and Connor, told the
congregation that in the wake of the horrific killings ``voices
have been raised _ voices of sanity, voices of reason. Agonizing
words, words of self-examination, courageous words, words of
strength, words of healing have been spoken.''
	   He also made an indirect reference to the Protestant marchers'
insistence on parading through a Catholic neighborhood in Portadown
and the rippling violence it has touched off, saying, ``The weapons
of hate-filled words inevitably fuel weapons of murderous
destruction.''
	   Later, a sweet, lilting choir sang a hymn with the phrase ``if
you walk among the burning flames, you shall not be harmed,''
followed by the chorus, ``Be not afraid, I go before you always.''
	   Richard, Mark and Jason Quinn were buried in nearby Rasharkin,
where the Quinn family has its roots, in the Catholic ground of St.
Mary's Church.

McCaffrey seeks to soothe Dutch anger over remarks about Dutch drug

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- U.S. drug czar Barry R. McCaffrey sought
Tuesday to ease Dutch anger over criticism of their permissive drug
laws, saying he has ``high respect'' for the Netherlands despite
differences over narcotics policy.
	   McCaffrey, a retired general, visited the headquarters of the
U.N. Drug Control Program as part of an 8-day fact-finding tour of
Europe aimed at underscoring the need for international cooperation
on combating drugs.
	   But the tour has been overshadowed by McCaffrey's strong
criticism of the Dutch policy of allowing citizens to use marijuana
and other soft drugs for therapeutic and recreational purposes.
	   On Thursday, McCaffrey told CNN's ``Talkback Live'' that the
policy was an ``unmitigated disaster'' which had contributed to
crime in the Netherlands.
	   That prompted a sharp response from the Netherlands' ambassador
to the United States, Joris M. Vos, who said he was ``confounded
and dismayed'' by McCaffrey's description of the Netherlands.
	   ``I must say that I find the timing of your remarks, six days
before your planned visit to the Netherlands with a view to gaining
firsthand knowledge about Dutch drugs policy and its results,
rather astonishing,'' Vos wrote McCaffrey.
	   After a press conference Tuesday at the U.N. drug control
headquarters, McCaffrey's spokesman, Robert Housman, distributed a
statement expressing concern that the Dutch government was being
``pulled into an internal political debate'' in the United States
by those who support decriminalizing drugs.
	   ``These legalizers put American children at risk,'' the
statement said. ``The Dutch government should be renouncing them,
not siding with them ... Every nation is free to set their own
policies domestically. However, other nations must respect the
sovereignty of others and be keenly aware of the impacts of their
policies on the global community.''
	   Three hours after handing out the printed statement, Housman
telephoned news agencies to say it ``no longer stands'' because the
comments did not reflect McCaffrey's views.
	   Housman said no new statement would be issued and gave no
further reason for withdrawing the original.
	   ``The general is going there (Netherlands) to take an
open-minded, analytical look,'' Housman said. ``He's there to
listen.''
	   McCaffrey was asked at the press conference about his critical
remarks about the Dutch system.
	   ``We believe a frank exchange of views among friends is most
productive,'' he replied. ``We have a high respect for the Dutch.''
	   McCaffrey heads for the Netherlands on Thursday after a visit
Wednesday to Switzerland. The Swiss maintain a controversial
program of state-distribution of small amounts of heroin and other
hard drugs to selected addicts under strict medical supervision.
	   In The Hague, Dutch foreign ministry spokeswoman Birgitta
Tazalaar said Dutch officials would welcome McCaffrey but added,
``how can you learn if you are coming with preconceived ideas?''
	   She said the liberal drug policy ``works for us ... We are free
to have our own policy.''
	   McCaffrey arrived here from Sweden. He is also to visit Portugal
and England on the tour.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) - In efforts to find a peaceful solution to
the Kosovo conflict, Turkish President Suleyman Demirel conferred
Tuesday with his Albanian host and counterpart Rexhep Meidani.
	   Both presidents underscored the need for a peaceful solution to
the Kosovo crisis and condemned the escalating violence.
	   Demirel, who heades a 140-member Turkish delegation, said ``The
world opinion, including Turkey, is with Kosovo'' after their
closed-door meeting.
	   The area used to be part of the Ottoman Empire.
	   During Demirel's two-day visit, cooperation agreements are also
expected to be signed between the two countries in the fields of
social assistance and social insurance.
	   Demirel is accompanied by Foreign Minister Ismail Cem, Labor
Minister Nami Cagan, Sport Minister Yucel Seckiner and a delegation
of leading Turkish businessmen.
	   On Wednesday, Demirel will meet the Albanian parliament.

Four people charged in plot to bomb London
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Police charged four young people Tuesday in a
failed bomb plot that was blamed on Irish dissidents opposed to the
Northern Ireland peace process.
	   Scotland Yard said the four, three men aged 19, 21 and 25, and a
21-year-old women, were charged with conspiracy to cause
explosions. The two younger men and the women were also charged
with possessing explosives.
	   On Friday, Scotland Yard said that police had thwarted ``an
imminent planned terrorist attack in London.''
	   The four people charged on Tuesday were among 10 in Ireland and
Britain in a joint operation by police and security services.
	   Police, who have warned that there remained a real threat to
April's Northern Ireland peace agreement from splinter groups, said
that the arrests have come after a prolonged investigation into
dissident IRA groups.

Hoover wins four cases brought in `free flights' debacle
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DIRK BEVERIDGE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Appliance maker Hoover won four lawsuits Tuesday
in an embarrassing ``free flights'' promotion that cost millions
and made the company a laughingstock.
	   ``They're winning at the moment,'' conceded Harry Cichy, the
head of a consumers group calling itself the Hoover Holiday
Pressure Group. The group hoped to file tens of thousands of cases
against the Hoover European Appliance Group in one big lawsuit.
	   But Cichy said the battle may not be over. The Hoover Holiday
Pressure Group had previously won two test cases _ and they were
upheld on appeal _ before Tuesday's losses.
	   ``We're disappointed with today's outcome, but it has to be
taken as a whole,'' Cichy said. ``They can't take the first two
away.''
	   Several more lawsuits are still in the pipeline before Judge
Ivor Bennett, sitting in tiny St. Helens just outside Liverpool.
Cichy said his group's lawyers will have to study verdicts in 14
separate test cases before deciding whether to file a class action.
	   Cichy said up to 350,000 people in Britain and Ireland might
have grounds to sue.
	   Hoover, meanwhile, hopes the cases it has won will set the
precedent. ``We are confident of similar outcomes in the future,''
the company said in a statement.
	   Hoover pointed out it has prevailed in most of the lawsuits
filed in the free flights saga in various courts around Britain,
although spokeswoman Caroline Knight said she was unable to provide
any exact tally.
	   Bennett ruled Tuesday that Hoover was not in breach of contract
against four would-be travelers, Harold Bray, Colleen Codling,
Jacqueline Freeman and Roger Diament.
	   Cichy claimed they were victimized by fine print.
	   ``Some of this group were offered tickets, but they were offered
London tickets and they lived in Manchester, so the judge said,
`You were offered tickets,''' Cichy said.
	   Hoover is hoping to finally end the mess it created through the
ill-fated offer in which it promised two free international
airplane flights to anybody in Britain and Ireland who brought an
appliance for as little as 100 pounds (about dlrs 165).
	   The deal was too good to be true, and it turned into one of the
biggest marketing mistakes in corporate history.
	   Many people bought vaccuum cleaners just so they could get a
free vacation. When Hoover tried to use red tape to stop them, many
kept fighting.
	   Hoover Europe's former corporate parent, the Maytag Corp., of
Newton, Iowa, finally paid out dlrs 72 million to fly some 220,000
customers on their trips.
	   Maytag later sold Hoover Europe to the Italian appliance maker
Candy S.p.A, although Maytag had to set up a fund to deal with the
free flights litigation.

	   LORIENT, France (AP) - The Tour de France returned to home
ground Tuesday on its national holiday but Dane Bo Hambuerger and
American George Hincapie had their own celebration.
	   Hamburger took over the overall lead in the race on Bastille Day
by two seconds over Hincapie, the American champion.
	   Both were in hunt as a small group of riders broke away to gain
an advantage over the main group and set up a contest for the
yellow jersey.
	   Hincapie came in third on the day, two seconds behind the stage
winner Jens Heppner.
	   Heppner held off Xavier Jan of France in a final sprint after
both had broken slightly away from the pack in the final stretch.
Heppner spoiled the Frenchman's attempt to win a stage of Bastille
Day on the 169-kilometer (105-mile) leg south through Brittany from
Roscoff to Lorient on the west coast of France.
	   Hincapie, who is a member of the U.S. Postal team, was third on
the day. But he participated in the breakaway and got a second in
one of the bonus sprints. However Hamburger got two wins and a
third in the three and gained 14 seconds compared to Hincapie's
four to wrest the overall lead from him.
	   Hincapie was upset over the participation of Heppner and Jan in
the pace-setting of the small group.
	   ``The FDJ guy (Jan) and Telekom guy (Heppner)were sitting up all
day,'' Hincapie said, meaning they were not pushing hard during the
fast pace.
	   ``With a sprint like that at the end it is different because
everyone is so wasted except for those two other guys,'' Hincapie
said.
	   If Hincapie would have won the stage, he would have gotten 20
bonus seconds, enough to put him first.
	   However he tired at the end.
	   ``I cramped with about 10 kilometers to go. I floated in the
back until my legs came back,'' he said.
	   That gave Hamburger the chance to get close enough to take the
overall lead.
	   Hamburger was looking for the stage victory too but wasn't that
disappointed.
	   ``We're content with a consolation prize,'' he said meaning the
leader's yellow jersey heading into Wednesday's fourth stage from
Plouay to Cholet as the Tour heads slowly south to the Pyrenees.
	   The Tour de France tried to settle down after three hectic days
and one hectic night in Ireland.
	   Britain's Chris Boardman won the prologue and held the leader's
yellow jersey for a day before crashing out in Monday's stage to
Cork. He remained in the hospital overnight before being released.
He is recovering from a concussion with bruises and deep cuts.
	   The Tour is also recovering from the controversy involving the
top-ranked French team Festina. A Belgian member of its staff
remained jailed after having been arrested last week near the
French-Belgian border in possesion of performance-enhancing drugs.
	   Late Tuesday the Festina team issued a statement saying they
were astonished at recent press stories saying the man charged has
changed his version of things.
	   According to judicial sources, after first admitting the drugs
were for his personal use, the man charged said that he was under
orders.
	   Festina officials denied those accusations and said that they
had hired two lawyers to protect their image and riders.
	   Festina team director Bruno Roussel said he wants his version to
be heard.
	   ``I have then asked a judge or persons in authority to come to
me so that I can explain how a team functions, comment we do our
work so that the team can be able to work again quietly and do what
they came here for, that is to win the Tour,'' Roussel said.
	   Monday night, 186 cyclists and team personnel flew to Brittany
Monday evening in three chartered planes.
	   Most of the rest of the 3,500 persons following the Tour de
France went overnight on ferries to land on French soil just around
noon, just before the start of the state. The leg was the shortest
of this year's Tour de France outside of the time trials.
	   The race finishes in Paris Aug. 2.

	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and the
leaders of nearby Congo and Namibia said Tuesday that they have
agreed on a ``security pact'' to prevent the leader of Angola's
former rebel movement from undermining the country's peace process.
	   After three hours of talks here, the three heads of state issued
a written statement appealing to Jonas Savimbi to ``rejoin the
(Angolan) peace process.''
	   Dos Santos invited Congo's President Laurent Kabila and
Namibia's President Sam Nujoma for talks apparently aimed at
increasing pressure on Savimbi, who has been dragging his feet on
the implementation of Angola's 1994 peace deal.
	   The 1994 deal ended a two-decade civil war between the
government and Savimbi's UNITA rebels, but its implementation is
running years behind schedule.
	   In their statement, the three presidents said they would ``take
action to dissuade the UNITA leader from carrying out actions which
jeopardized the security of their countries as well as regional
peace and stability.''
	   Details of the intended measures were not given, although UNITA
is believed to have secret bases in remote areas of Congo and
Namibia.
	   Last year, Dos Santos provided troops to help Kabila overthrow
the late dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, a Savimbi ally, and in the
past, has threatened to launch attacks into Namibia to crush
alleged UNITA bases there.
	   UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola _ is refusing to hand over its central
highland strongholds to the government despite pressure for the
United Nations which brokered the peace agreement.
	   The government has blamed UNITA for recent attacks on police and
civilians in rural areas of Angola that threaten to derail the
peace process. It has also claimed that UNITA is keeping armed men
hidden in the bush of the vast southwest African nation.
	   The former rebel group has denied the allegations.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian military is stepping up efforts to
control the illicit export of military equipment and technology,
the head of the general staff told a news agency Tuesday.
	   ``The danger of the spread of materials and technologies for the
manufacture of weapons of mass destruction and means of their
delivery is obvious,'' Chief of Staff Anatoly Kvashnin told
Interfax.
	   He said the Defense Ministry's Export Control Commission is
increasing cooperation with law enforcement agencies in an effort
to stop the sale of equipment or technologies whose export is
banned.
	   Kvashnin was also quoted as saying that Russia is carefully
adhering to the Missile Technology Control Regime, which is aimed
at controlling the spread of missile technology.
	   On a tour of Russian missile sites last month, Gen. Eugene
Habiger, head of the U.S. Strategic Command, praised Russia for
carefully monitoring its nuclear arsenal.

McCaffrey seeks to soothe Dutch anger over remarks about Dutch drug

 &UR; Eds: UPDATE with McCaffrey spokesman retracting statement. &QL; 
 &UR; By MELISSA EDDY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- U.S. drug czar Barry R. McCaffrey sought
Tuesday to ease Dutch anger over criticism of their permissive drug
laws, saying he has ``high respect'' for the Netherlands despite
differences over narcotics policy.
	   McCaffrey, a retired general, visited the headquarters of the
U.N. Drug Control Program as part of an 8-day fact-finding tour of
Europe aimed at underscoring the need for international cooperation
on combating drugs.
	   But the tour has been overshadowed by McCaffrey's strong
criticism of the Dutch policy of allowing citizens to use marijuana
and other soft drugs for therapeutic and recreational purposes.
	   On Thursday, McCaffrey told CNN's ``Talkback Live'' that the
policy was an ``unmitigated disaster'' which had contributed to
crime in the Netherlands.
	   That prompted a sharp response from the Netherlands' ambassador
to the United States, Joris M. Vos, who said he was ``confounded
and dismayed'' by McCaffrey's description of the Netherlands.
	   ``I must say that I find the timing of your remarks, six days
before your planned visit to the Netherlands with a view to gaining
firsthand knowledge about Dutch drugs policy and its results,
rather astonishing,'' Vos wrote McCaffrey.
	   After a press conference Tuesday at the U.N. drug control
headquarters, McCaffrey's spokesman, Robert Housman, distributed a
statement expressing concern that the Dutch government was being
``pulled into an internal political debate'' in the United States
by those who support decriminalizing drugs.
	   ``These legalizers put American children at risk,'' the
statement said. ``The Dutch government should be renouncing them,
not siding with them ... Every nation is free to set their own
policies domestically. However, other nations must respect the
sovereignty of others and be keenly aware of the impacts of their
policies on the global community.''
	   Three hours after handing out the printed statement, Housman
telephoned news agencies to retract it. it ``no longer stands''
because the comments did not reflect McCaffrey's views.
	   Housman said no new statement would be issued and gave no
further reason for retracting the original.

	   PARIS (AP) _ One of the bystanders hit by a car driven by a

	   More than a million people were gathered on the avenue at the
time. The celebratory mood quickly turned into horror as dozens of
ambulances and 200 rescue workers converged on the scene.
	   At the time, officials said that although 11 people were injured
seriously, their lives weren't in danger.
	   The driver, a 44-year-old teacher who had been undergoing
psychiatric treatment, panicked and ran away, but later her son
brought the distraught woman to a police station, and she was
detained.
	   France Info radio reported earlier Tuesday that the woman is
currently in a psychiatric hospital.
	   The hospital spokesman said he would have no further details
Tuesday.

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A leading environmental group urged Mexico on
Tuesday to fine a Mexican-Japanese salt manufacturer for the death
of some 300 sea turtles and to halt an expansion project in the
Baja California Peninsula.
	   The Group of 100 artists, writers and intellectuals made the
appeal after a government environmental prosecutor ruled the turtle
deaths in December were caused by an accidental spill of brine from
the salt works.
	   ``The prosecutor is showing his intention of justifying the
massive deaths of the marine turtles and covering up the pollution
of the lagoons this causes,'' the group said in a news release
signed by its president, poet Homero Aridjis.
	   Many gray whales, which deliver their calves in the area, were
also affected by the spill, the group said.
	   Exportadora de Sal S.A., 51 percent owned by the Mexican
government and the rest by Mitsubishi of Japan, is a massive
saltworks that evaporates huge quantities of sea water in the state
of Baja California South. Its salt is exported mainly to Japan
	   The works are centered around the Ojo de Libre, Guerrero Negro,
and the Vizcaino Desert Biosphere Reserve. It now plans to expand
the works to San Ignacio Lagoon, near Magdalena Bay, a wintering
ground for gray whales.
	   In a statement, Exportadora de Sal promised to make public its
own investigation into the turtle deaths, especially for 94 which
died in December in Libre lagoon.
	   The statement said the company has always respected Mexican
environmental regulations and cooperated with Mexican authorities
in observing them.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Bastille Day, when the French mark the revolution
that brought democracy, always comes on July 14. But this year it
also came two days after France's smashing World Cup win.
	   In other words: another chance to party.
	   With the nation still basking in pride, President Jacques Chirac
was fully upstaged at his own annual garden party by _ who else? _
the beloved ``Les Bleus.''
	   The name of the team means the Blues, after their jerseys. But
it was their ``multicolored'' nature that Chirac chose to salute,
noting how a team that includes immigrants and immigrants' children
was helping France overcome its differences.
	   ``A country needs, at certain moments, to come together, around
an idea that makes it proud of itself,'' Chirac said in a TV
interview just before presenting the team to the crowd.
	   ``This victory has shown the solidarity, the cohesion ... that
France had a soul, or more precisely that it was looking for a
soul.''
	   As if to prove him right, an estimated 150,000 people showed up
for the annual Bastille Day military parade on the Champs-Elysees.
Not as many as came to the post-match victory celebrations, to be
sure _ but twice the number that showed up last year.
	   The Champs-Elysees was the scene of wild all-night celebration
after Sunday's victory over Brazil. Late Tuesday, news came that
one of the bystanders hurt in an accident during the partying had
died.

Allegations of illicit relationship in high-profile treason case
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lede and EDITS throughout to raise Yanai's denial.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The trial of an Israeli paratrooper convicted
of treason was tainted by the judge's relationship with a member of
the defense team and possible improper contact with the prime
minister, the defense lawyer said Tuesday.
	   The lawyer, Amnon Zichroni, said he will ask that Judge Amnon
Straschnov withdraw from the case Wednesday.
	   The judge was to hand down Nachum Manbar's sentence that day,
with Manbar facing up to life in prison. He was convicted last
month of selling dlrs 16 million worth of chemical and biological
weapons materials to Iran.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office and a spokesman for
the courts, speaking on behalf of Straschnov, denied the
allegations, as did the woman accused of having a relationship with
the judge.
	   ``The allegations in the petition that I had erotic relations
with the judge are a lie and aimed at humiliating me and
discrediting the judge,'' former defense team member Pninat Yanai
told the Supreme Court on Tuesday.
	   She said the charges stemmed from a vendetta by a former
boyfriend, Ziv Chen.
	   Yanai was an apprentice lawyer in Straschnov's office Zichroni
hired her. Yanai said Tuesday that Zichroni put her on the Manbar
defense team because he wanted to make use of her previous
professional connection with the judge. She has since been fired.
	   Zichroni asked the Supreme Court on Tuesday to declare a
mistrial and overturn Manbar's conviction, but the court ruled it
did not have jurisdiction.
	   In his petition to the high court, Zichroni said that Yanai
maintained a ``close, personal, intensive relationship'' with
Straschnov during the trial and gave him confidential information
about the case.
	   Zichroni also said Yanai was ``a close friend'' of Netanyahu
spokesman Shai Bazak. Zichroni said he learned from Yanai's
ex-boyfriend that Bazak told Yanai that the prime minister had
discussed the case with the judge.
	   Bazak called Zichroni's allegations a ``blatant lie'' and
demanded an apology.

	   ``It is possible there is happiness across France. But we were
four times world champions this century. They just one'', Cardoso
said, his voice filled with emotion. ``Our destiny is to grow and
become champions. There will be other tournaments.''
	   The next tournament is slated for 2002 in Korea and Japan.
	   Two Brazilian Air Force fighters escorted the jetliner that flew
the team from Paris as it approached the airport in Brasilia, where
the players headed to the Presidential Palace for an official
welcoming ceremony amid the cheers of thousands of fans.
	   The welcome in the capital contrasted sharply with the almost
completely quiet arrival of the players a few hours later in Rio de
Janeiro, where only a few hundred fans went to the airport to greet
them.
	   Authorities in Rio had been organizing a massive welcome, but
the plans were called off after Sunday's 3-0 defeat.
	   Ronaldo, who suffered a sudden fit of convulsions hours before
the game, looked tired as he came out of the plane in Brasilia. He
was holding the leash of a white dog given to his girlfriend as a
present, a television report said.

	   PARIS (AP) _ One of the bystanders hit by a car driven by a
panicked driver during celebrations following France's World Cup
victory has died, hospital officials said Tuesday.
	   The patient, who was not identified, died at the Beaujon
hospital in Clichy near Paris, said a spokesman for Paris' public
hospitals. The spokesman spoke on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Thirty-three people are still hospitalized from the accident in
the early-morning hours Monday, when a woman, apparently panicked
by the aggressive crowd pounding on her vehicle, plowed into a
crowd of revelers. About 80 people were injured.
	   More than a million people were gathered on the avenue at the
time. The celebratory mood quickly turned into horror as dozens of
ambulances and 200 rescue workers converged on the scene.
	   At the time, officials said that although 11 people were hurt
seriously, their lives weren't in danger. Ten people are still in
serious condition.
	   The driver, a 44-year-old teacher who had been undergoing
psychiatric treatment, panicked and ran away, but later her son
brought the distraught woman to a police station, and she was
detained.
	   France Info radio reported earlier Tuesday that the woman is
currently in a psychiatric hospital.
	   The hospital spokesman said he would have no further details
Tuesday.
	   It was the second death in France related to this year's World
Cup. A French actor was stabbed to death by an apparently deranged
English supporter following the England-Argentina game.
	   And a French policeman remains in a coma after his head was
beaten in by a German hooligan wielding an iron bar.

	   RAS AL-KHAIMAH, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ A Ukrainian cargo
plane with eight crew members on board burst into flames minutes
after taking off and crashed into the sea, aviation officials said
Tuesday. All aboard were killed.
	   A witness said hundreds of watermelons spilled out into the sea
from the aircraft after it crashed Monday night, about 500 meters
(550 yards) from the shore.
	   ``It was like a field of watermelons on the water,'' said
Mohammad Hussein, a 46-year-old businessman, who said he saw the
plane catch fire minutes after take-off and then explode. He said
he witnessed the crash from the terrace of a beachfront hotel.
	   The 15-year-old Ilyushin-76 was owned by Ukraine's Defense
Ministry and was on lease to a private Kiev-based cargo airline,
A.T.I. Aircompany, the Ukrainian Emergency Situations Ministry
said.
	   The Ukrainian Embassy said the plane carried several cars and
audio equipment apparently to be sold in Ukraine. Officials said
the cargo weighed 40 tons and was being ferried from the Gulf
emirate of Ras Al-Khaimah to Mykolayiv in southern Ukraine.
	   Emirates officials said it had a crew of seven military men and
one civilian. All eight bodies were recovered by searchers, who
also pulled up the wreckage, the official Emirates news agency WAM
said.
	   But the cockpit was apparently severed from the fuselage, and
WAM said it still hadn't been found.
	   It said the plane crashed after one of its four engines caught
fire.
	   An official speaking on condition of anonymity said one of the
instruments that recorded in-flight conditions and data was
recovered Tuesday and the search was continuing for the other.
	   Mohammed Al-Ghaith, an Emirates' civil aviation official heading
the crash investigation, said there were no technical faults when
the flight took off at 11 p.m. (1900 GMT) Monday.
	   In the states of the former Soviet Union, it is not uncommon for
private companies to charter military planes for cargo flights, and
the Emirates has a flourishing trade with the region.
	   The Ras al-Khaimah airport receives about 40 flights every week
from cities in the former Soviet Union, where air safety has
declined dramatically as many cash-strapped airlines have failed to
provide adequate maintenance of aging aircraft.
	   In December, 85 people were killed when a Tajik airliner crashed
in the emirate of Sharjah.

Court decision delays parole for Salvadorans convicted of killing
</HEADLINE>
nuns &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ZACATECOLUCA, El Salvador (AP) _ The early release of three
Salvadorans imprisoned for the 1980 murders of four U.S.
churchwomen was blocked Tuesday when a court agreed to accept an
appeal from a lawyer for two other men convicted in the case.
	   Former national guardsmen Luis Colindres, Daniel Canales and
Jose Roberto Moreno have been waiting to be freed since a judge
ruled last month that they qualified for parole under a new law to
ease prison overcrowding.
	   Two other former guards, Orlando Contreras and Carlos Joaquin
Contreras Palacios, were denied parole because one had been
convicted on weapons charges and the other participated in a prison
disturbance.
	   Defense attorney Delmy de Zuniga filed an appeal Monday asking
that Judge Gloria Platero's denial of parole be reconsidered. A
ruling on the appeal is expected within the next two weeks.
	   Under El Salvadoran law, the three who qualify for parole cannot
be freed immediately because their case is tied to that of two
other men.
	   The five guardsmen were sentenced to 30 years for kidnapping,
raping and killing Roman Catholic nuns Ita Ford, Dorothy Kazel and
Maura Clark and layworker Jean Donovan on Dec. 2, 1980.
Military-backed death squads suspected the nuns of sympathizing
with leftist guerrillas.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Bastille Day, when the French mark the revolution
that brought democracy, always comes on July 14. But this year it
also came two days after France's smashing World Cup win.
	   In other words: another chance to party.
	   With the nation still basking in pride, President Jacques Chirac
was fully upstaged at his own annual garden party by _ who else? _
the beloved ``Les Bleus.''
	   The name of the team means the Blues, after their jerseys. But
it was their ``multicolored'' nature that Chirac chose to salute,
noting how a team that includes immigrants and immigrants' children
was helping France overcome its differences.
	   ``A country needs, at certain moments, to come together, around
an idea that makes it proud of itself,'' Chirac said in a TV
interview just before presenting the team to the crowd.
	   ``This victory has shown the solidarity, the cohesion ... that
France had a soul, or more precisely that it was looking for a
soul.''
	   As if to prove him right, an estimated 150,000 people showed up
for the annual Bastille Day military parade on the Champs-Elysees.
Not as many as came to the post-match victory celebrations, to be
sure _ but twice the number that showed up last year.
	   The Champs-Elysees was the scene of wild all-night celebration
after Sunday's victory over Brazil. Late Tuesday, news came that
one of the bystanders hurt in an accident during the partying had
died.
	   The victim, who wasn't identified, was cut down by a car driven
by a woman who apparently panicked when the aggressive crowd
pounded on her vehicle. Eighty people were hurt, 11 seriously.
	   Bastille Day commemorates the storming by Parisians of the
Bastille prison on July 14, 1789, setting off the French Revolution
that toppled the monarchy.
	   The Champs-Elysees crowds watched fighter jets and military
helicopters thunder overhead in formation, tanks roll from the Arc
de Triomphe to the Place de la Concorde, and bright red fire trucks
amble by.
	   The parade also featured the colorful Republican Guard, on
horseback in their gilded helmets with red plumes.
	   As always, the popular firemen got the biggest cheers, and fire
houses across the nation were gussying up to host their annual
balls Tuesday night. The whole party was to end, as usual, with
fireworks at the Eiffel Tower.
	   But it was no usual Bastille Day at the elegant Elysee Palace,
where Chirac hosts a yearly garden party, often including
youngsters from around the country.
	   On Tuesday, 6,000 invited guests _ including 4,000 youths along
with Cabinet ministers and well-know TV hosts _ munched on
multicultural finger food and awaited the French players.
	   When the team did come out, it was to recorded strains of the
rock group Queen's ``We Are the Champions'' _ presumably the first
time Freddie Mercury and company have graced a presidential
function.

Four people charged in foiled London plot bomb

	   LONDON (AP) _ Police charged four young people Tuesday in a
failed bombing plot in the British capital that was blamed on IRA
dissidents opposed to Northern Ireland's peace process.
	   Scotland Yard said the four, three men aged 19, 21 and 25, and a
21-year-old woman, were charged with conspiracy to cause
explosions. The two younger men and the woman were also charged
with possessing explosives.
	   Police refused to release any other details, and said that the
suspects' names would be made public when they appear in
magistrates court in Woolwich, southeast London, on Wednesday.
	   On Friday, Scotland Yard said that police had thwarted ``an
imminent planned terrorist attack in London.'' It refused to
identify the intended targets, but the British media, quoting
unnamed police sources, reported that the firebombs were thought to
have been destined for London department stores.
	   The four people charged Tuesday were among 10 arrested in
Ireland and Britain on Friday in a joint operation by police and
security services.
	   All four people arrested in the Irish Republic were released
without charge on Sunday. But a police spokesman said files on a
woman and a man detained in Dublin and a man detained in Dundalk
would be sent to the prosecutor's department, which could charge
them. A man arrested in Wexford was allowed to go without any
further action.
	   Two people arrested in London have also been released.
	   On Sunday Ronnie Flanagan, Northern Ireland's police chief, said
that Irish Republican Army splinter groups opposed to the Northern
Ireland peace agreement signed in April had joined forces and were
likely to have been behind the foiled London bombing.
	   Flanagan said the dissident alliance included Continuity IRA,
the Irish National Liberation Army _ both anti-British rivals of
the IRA _ and associates of the so-called 32 County Sovereignty
Committee.
	   Police said that Friday's arrests came after a prolonged
investigation into dissident IRA groups.
	   The Sunday Times reported that three of the men arrested in
London were students _ two at University College in Dublin and one
at Queen's College in Belfast.

	   ANDREWS, North Carolina (AP) _ Abortion clinic bombing suspect
Eric Rudolph stole a pickup truck and a large quantity of food from
a home near Andrews and is believed to still be in this mountainous
area, authorities said Tuesday.
	   The bomb task force that has been tracking the 31-year-old
carpenter since a Jan. 29 bombing in Birmingham, Alabama, converged
on this area near the tip of western North Carolina with
bloodhounds and extra manpower.
	   ``The search has intensified significantly,'' said Woody
Enderson, inspector in charge of the Southeast Bombing Task Force.
``This is a pretty significant step forward because we now know for
sure he is in this area and we can now focus on a much smaller
area.''
	   Enderson said Rudolph stole a 1977 blue Datsun last Thursday
from the Nantahala community in Macon County, between Andrews and
Franklin. The truck was found Monday, he said.
	   He wouldn't respond to an NBC News report that fingerprints in
the truck matched Rudolph's.
	   Enderson would only say, ``We are confident we are dealing with
Eric Robert Rudolph.''
	   He said a Nantahala resident reported the theft of his truck and
food and provided a description of Rudolph.
	   The bombing of the New Woman All Women clinic killed a police
officer moonlighting as a security guard and severely injured a
nurse.
	   Since he was named a suspect, Rudolph has evaded a nationwide
search. A dlrs 1 million reward has been offered for information
leading to his arrest.
	   Federal agents also want to question him about bombings in
Atlanta, including the bombing at Centennial Olympic Park in July
1996 that killed one and injured more than 100. The other attacks
in Atlanta were at an abortion clinic in January 1997 and at a gay
nightclub in February 1997.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The United Nations may have to withdraw
from parts of Afghanistan because of restrictions imposed by the
Taliban leadership, the U.N. envoy to the country said Tuesday.
	   A meeting Friday of eight countries overseeing the situation in
Afghanistan was expected to take up the issue, said Lakhdar
Brahimi, the U.N. chief's special envoy for Afghanistan. It wasn't
known if any change on the U.N. role would come from the meeting.
	   But relations have deteriorated steadily between the United
Nations and the Taliban, which has imposed a strict version of
Islamic rule in the 85 percent of the country it controls.
	   Most recently, the Taliban forced international aid workers in
Kabul to relocate to abandoned dormitories for what the authorities
said were security precautions. Aid workers said the move in fact
constituted a security risk because, living together, they would be
easy targets for military attacks and hostage taking.
	   ``They don't seem to be taking any decision that is right
concerning the work of the humanitarian community in Afghanistan,''
Brahimi said after briefing the Security Council on the situation.
	   The council responded with a statement that expressed its
concern about reports of harassment of humanitarian groups,
deplored the breakdown of talks and the fact that both sides in the
conflict have been receiving arms and money from neighboring
countries.
	   The statement did not single out any countries. But it is widely
believed that the strongly Islamic Taliban is receiving aid from
Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. Russia, Central Asian countries and Iran
are thought to be helping the northern-based alliance battling the
Taliban.
	   Brahimi said the Taliban had been told that they were violating
the terms of an understanding on humanitarian issues reached in May
by making unacceptable restrictions for aid workers to operate,
particularly in the capital, Kabul.
	   ``If these conditions are not acceptable, my opinion is that we
will have to tell the Taliban `You have signed an agreement, you
implement it, or let us go and work somewhere else.'''
	   When asked if the United Nations was at the point of giving the
Taliban one last chance, Brahimi said the Taliban must know there
is a limit to what the United Nations will tolerate. ``There are
growing pressures on us _ in part from the donor community _ to say
there is a limit to what you can stand.''
	   He said representatives from Afghanistan's six neighbors _ Iran,
Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Pakistan and China _ as well
as the United States and Russia would take up the situation at a
meeting here on Friday.

El Guerrouj breaks world record for 1,500 meters

	   ROME (AP) _ Morocco's Hicham El Guerrouj slashed more than one
second off the world record for the 1,500 meters Tuesday, clocking
3 minutes, 26 seconds at the Golden Gala meet.
	   El Guerrouj, the world champion at the distance, was within
sight of the old mark throughout the race on a cool night and
coasted across the finish alone. He erased Noureddine Morceli's
standard of 3:27.37, established in July 1995.
	   The Moroccan dropped to his knees and kissed the track, before
the other competitors in the race piled on top of him in
celebration.
	   ``Everything was right in Rome,'' the 23-year-old said. ``The
weather conditions and the track were good, and I was in the right
shape.''
	   He has been closing in for some time on the 1,500 record and
Morceli's standing as the world's premier middle distance runner.
El Guerrouj seemed headed for victory at the 1996 Olympics but
tripped on the last lap, handing the Algerian the gold. But now,
after redemption at the World Championships in Athens, Greece, last
summer, El Guerrouj also has the record.
	   In other events Tuesday at Rome's cavernous Olympic Stadium,
Michael Johnson rebounded from just his second loss of the decade
in the 400 meters to win that race, while Marion Jones continued
her dominance of the 100.
	   Johnson covered the 400 in a relatively relaxed 44.40 seconds,
but it was good enough to beat Mark Richardson (second in 44.62)
and Iwan Thomas (fifth in 44.77). The double Olympic champion had
finished behind those two Britons at Oslo, Norway, last Thursday.
	   Jones was never challenged and crossed the line in a blazing
10.74 seconds. Only two women _ Florence Griffith-Joyner, who owns
the record of 10.49, and Merlene Ottey _ have ever run faster. It
was still outside the year's best time of 10.71 that Jones has hit
twice, including at the U.S. Championships, where she defended her
title last month.
	   Jones had a half-hour to recover before the long jump
competition was to start, with all three medalists from Athens
entered: Lyudmila Galkina, Niki Xanthou and Fiona May.
	   Elsewhere, Angie Vaughn beat another American, Melissa Morrison,
in a photo finish to take the women's 100-meter hurdles in 12.66.
Vaughn was the last out of the blocks but caught Morrison, who
owned four of the year's top six times in the event coming in.
	   In other women's events, world silver medalist Yelena Afanasyeva
won the 800 in 1:57.68, the year's second fastest time, while
Morocco's Zohra Ouaziz barely held off former Olympic and world
cross country champion Gete Wami of Ethiopia to take the 5,000 in a
meet record 14:44.35.
	   Other top names competing later included world 100 titlist
Maurice Greene and world 200 champ Ato Boldon, squaring off in the
dash; world and Olympic 10,000 winner Haile Gebreselassie of
Ethiopia, looking to lower his record in the 5,000, and six-time
world pole vault champ Sergei Bubka.

Nigerian dissident group threatens to boycott transition plan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 9 grafs to UPDATE with Abubakar meeting other
opposition leaders. Picks up 7th graf previous, `Abiola, a
southerner ...'
 &UR; By FRANK AIGBOGUN &QC;

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ A prominent Nigerian dissident group is
demanding that the transfer to civilian rule occur as scheduled on
Oct. 1, amid reports that the new military leader will delay the
handover.
	   Nigeria's new military leader, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, is
expected to announce the revised transition plans in a televised
address later this week, perhaps as early as Wednesday. The new
plans call for the military to hand over power on March 31, after
elections are held, the Lagos-based This Day newspaper has
reported. That report could not be immediately confirmed.
	   But the Joint Action Committee, which is threatening the
boycott, said that only a government of national unity led by a
cross-section of Nigerians could shepherd the country through the
transition and heal the wounds created when the 1993 presidential
elections were annulled.
	   Faith in the country's rulers was further tested when the
presumed winner of that election, Moshood Abiola, died in custody
last week.
	   ``We want a sense of national well-being,'' said the committee's
leader, Lagos lawyer Gani Fawehinmi, after a Monday meeting. The
committee is comprised of 52 dissident groups.
	   The committee believes that a national conference must be set up
before new elections to discuss ways to ensure that Nigeria's
southerners _ who long have been excluded from power _ are given a
role in the country's future.
	   Abubakar, meanwhile, met Tuesday with officials from the
National Democratic Coalition, another prominent opposition group.
Officials and Coalition officials declined to describe the focus of
the talks, though Abubakar is believed to have called them seeking
advice on selecting cabinet ministers. He dissolved his cabinet
last week.
	   The group has long called for a government of national unity,
and had insisted, before his death, that it be led by Abiola.
	   Abraham Adesanya, the chairman of the group, told reporters
later that the Coalition still wanted a government of national
unity, but said it could be headed ``by any credible Nigerian.''
	   Abubakar has had meetings with various opposition groups since
coming to power, including earlier talks with leaders of the
Coalition.

Two car accidents kill four vacationing Britons
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAS PALMAS, Canary Islands (AP) _ Car accidents on this Spanish
resort island chain killed four Britons over the last week, police
said Tuesday.
	   Debbie Parry, 17 and Elaine Woodcock, 32, were walking along a
sidewalk in the town of Teguise on island of Lanzarote on Sunday
when a car left the road and knocked them down, a police spokesman
said.
	   The accident was caused by a recently-licensed driver losing
control of his vehicle because of inexperience, the spokesman said
on condition of anonymity.
	   The British Foreign Office in London said Parry died in hospital
Sunday and Woodcock died late Monday.
	   Woodcock's nine-year-old daughter Emma Woodcock was also
seriously injured in the accident and Parry's 19-year-old sister
Sharon required less urgent medical treatment.
	   The four, all from Manchester in northern England, were on
vacation on Lanzarote, one of Spanish Canary Islands located off
the coast of Morocco.
	   Also Tuesday, a local traffic authority spokesman said a further
two vacationing Britons, resident in Leicester, died in a car crash
last week on the neighboring island of Fuerteventura.
	   Louise Hamill, 29, and her seven-year-old daughter, Ashleigh,
died after the car they were traveling in went out of control and
overturned.
	   Mathew Hamill, 4, was seriously injured in the crash. The driver
of the car, 29-year-old David Hamill, was unhurt, the spokesman
said.

Iafrate hopes to revive career with Carolina
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVID DROSCHAK &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MORRISVILLE, North Carolina (AP) _ Al Iafrate hopes to revive
his once thriving career with the Carolina Hurricanes, who signed
the free agent Tuesday to an incentive-laden contract that could
pay the former All-Star dlrs 3 million this season.
	   The signing of the 6-foot-3 (1.88-meter), 235-pound
(106-kilogram) Iafrate came one day after the Hurricanes, a
franchise that has missed the postseason each of the last six
seasons, landed high-profile free agent center Ron Francis with a
dlrs 20.8 million deal.
	   Once among the National Hockey League's best offensive
defensemen with a 105 mph (168 kmph) slap shot, Iafrate played in
only 59 games the past four seasons with Boston and San Jose
because of operations on both knees and a back operation.
	   Carolina general manager Jim Rutherford decided to sign the
four-time All-Star to a one-year contract after he received a
relatively clean bill of health from a Detroit doctor.
	   ``I don't see why not,'' Rutherford said when asked if Iafrate
could return to All-Star form at age 32. ``They didn't operate on
his ability. They have operated on his knees and his back. He can
play every bit as good as he did at one time as long as he's
healthy.''
	   That's the catch, and the reason Iafrate's base salary will be
dlrs 300,000 with incentives for games played and level of
production. Iafrate would likely have to put up numbers like his
25-goal, 41-assist season with Washington in 1992-93 to earn dlrs 3
million.
	   ``If I produce the way I did five years ago I will be right on
scale with all the other guys who are all-stars now,'' Iafrate said
of his contract. ``I think it's fair for both sides.''

Three killed when plane crashes on island
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Three persons were killed and a
fourth passenger was seriously injured Tuesday when a small plane
crashed upon landing on a Danish island.
	   The accident occurred as gale-force winds swept across the
country. It was not immediately known whether the wind had caused
the accident.
	   The 52-year-old pilot and two passengers, aged 18 and 21, were
killed, police said. All were Danes.
	   The four-person plane, registered in Denmark, crashed on Anholt,
an island midway between the Jutland peninsula and Sweden.
	   A rescue team managed to land with a helicopter on the island.

Sweden's crown princess says she's come to grips with eating
</HEADLINE>
disorder &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Crown Princess Victoria, who turned 21
on Tuesday, says she is winning her struggle against an eating
disorder.
	   ``I feel very good now, but everyone went through a really
difficult period,'' she said in an interview with several of
Sweden's largest newspapers.
	   Last year, in an unusual move, the royal household admitted that
the heir to the Swedish throne had an unspecified eating disorder.
The statement came after newspapers published photos of her looking
unusually thin.
	   In the wake of the admission, Victoria cancelled plans to enter
Sweden's Uppsala University and instead enrolled at America's Yale
University.
	   Although Swedish media eagerly follow the generally well-liked
royal family, they avoid the minute and intrusive coverage to which
some other royal families are subjected.
	   In the interview, Victoria thanked Swedish media for keeping
their distance during her time in the United States.
	   ``It takes time and is enormously hard'' to come to grips with
an eating disorder, she said.

Allegations of illicit relationship in high-profile treason case
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comment by Justice Minister grafs 11-12 &QL; 
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The defense attorney in a high-profile treason
trial said Tuesday he would ask the judge to withdraw from the
case, claiming the jurist was involved in an ``intensive'' personal
relationship with a female member of the defense team.
	   In a petition to the Supreme Court, the defense attorney, citing
hearsay, also also alleged that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
discussed the treason case with Judge Amnon Straschnov while the
trial was under way.
	   Netanyahu's office and a spokesman for the courts, speaking on
behalf of Straschnov, denied the allegations.
	   At issue is the case of Nachum Manbar, a former Israeli
paratrooper convicted last month of selling dlrs 16 million worth
of chemical and biological weapons materials to Iran.
	   Straschnov was to hand down Manbar's sentence Wednesday, with
Manbar facing life in prison.
	   Manbar's defense attorney, Amnon Zichroni, will ask the judge at
the beginning of Wednesday's session to disqualify himself, said
Zichroni's spokesman, Dror Arad-Ayalon.
	   Zichroni initially asked the Supreme Court on Tuesday to declare
a mistrial and overturn Manbar's conviction in the Tel Aviv
District Court. However, the court ruled it did not have
jurisdiction in the matter.
	   In his petition to the high court, Zichroni said that a member
of his team, attorney Pninat Yanai, 26, maintained a ``close,
personal, intensive relationship'' with Straschnov during the trial
and passed on confidential information about the case to the judge.
	   Zichroni also said Yanai was ``a close friend'' of Netanyahu
spokesman Shai Bazak. Zichroni said he learned from Yanai's former
boyfriend, Ziv Chen, that Bazak had told Yanai the prime minister
had discussed the case with the judge.
	   Bazak called Zichroni's allegations a ``blatant lie'' and
demanded that the attorney apologize.
	   Justice Minister Tsahi Hanegbi accused Zichroni and his
associates of attempting to destroy Straschnov's reputation for
political reasons.
	   ``They are using the court system for the wrong purposes and are
ignoring judicial decisions,'' Hanegbi said to a gathering of top
lawyers, ``They have shaken the foundation of our democracy.''

El Guerrouj breaks world record for 1,500 meters

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with El Guerrouj quotes, background, more results. &QL; 
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Morocco's Hicham El Guerrouj slashed more than one
second off the world record for the 1,500 meters Tuesday, clocking
3 minutes, 26 seconds at the Golden Gala meet.
	   El Guerrouj, the world champion at the distance, was within
sight of the old mark throughout the race on a cool night and
coasted across the finish alone. He erased Noureddine Morceli's
standard of 3:27.37, established at Nice, France, in July 1995.
	   The Moroccan dropped to his knees and kissed the track, before
the other competitors in the race piled on top of him in

	   He has been closing in for some time on the 1,500 record and
Morceli's standing as the world's premier middle distance runner.
El Guerrouj seemed headed for victory at the 1996 Olympics but
tripped on the last lap, handing the Algerian the gold. But now,
after gaining some redemption by leaving Morceli far behind at the
World Championships in Athens, Greece, last summer, El Guerrouj
also has his record.
	   ``I expect these things,'' El Guerrouj said. ``I came with the
intention of breaking the record. Considering that last year here I
ran 3:30 under the rain, (today's) result is not surprising.''
	   His pursuit of Morceli first bore fruit at the IAAF Grand Prix
Finals in Milan, Italy, two years ago, when El Guerrouj ended his
rival's four-year winning streak in the 1,500.
	   In other events Tuesday at Rome's cavernous Olympic Stadium,
Michael Johnson rebounded from just his second loss of the decade
in the 400 meters to win that race, Marion Jones continued her
dominance of the women's 100, and veteran Frankie Fredericks stayed
on track for a dlrs 1 million jackpot by winning the men's 100.
	   Johnson covered the 400 in a relatively relaxed 44.40 seconds,
but it was good enough to beat Mark Richardson (second in 44.62)
and Iwan Thomas (fifth in 44.77). The double Olympic champion had

	   Jones had a half-hour to recover before the long jump
competition was to start, with all three medalists from Athens
entered: Lyudmila Galkina, Niki Xanthou and Fiona May.
	   In the men's dash, Fredericks outleaned world 200 champ Ato
Boldon to win in 9.97. Boldon was second in 9.99, with world 100
tilist Maurice Green third in 10.04.
	   The Golden Gala is the second leg in the new Golden League, a
six-meet series that offers a dlrs 1 million jackpot to anyone who
wins their event at all six venues plus the Grand Prix Finals at
Moscow in September.
	   Elsewhere, Olympic champion and world record holder Jonathan
Edwards took the triple jump by leaping 17.60 meters on his only
clean effort. American Bryan Bronson held off world champion
Stephane Diagana of France to take the 400 hurdles in 47.76, while
Kevin Toth won the shot put with a top effort of 20.63 meters.
	   Among the women, Angie Vaughn beat another American, Melissa
Morrison, in a photo finish to take the women's 100-meter hurdles
in 12.66; world silver medalist Yelena Afanasyeva won the 800 in
1:57.68, the year's second fastest time; and Morocco's Zohra Ouaziz
barely held off former Olympic and world cross country champion
Gete Wami of Ethiopia to take the 5,000 in a meet record 14:44.35.

	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ U.S. drug czar Barry R. McCaffrey sought
Tuesday to ease Dutch anger over criticism of their permissive drug
laws, saying he has ``high respect'' for the Netherlands despite
differences over narcotics policy.
	   McCaffrey, a retired general, visited the headquarters of the
U.N. Drug Control Program as part of an 8-day fact-finding tour of
Europe aimed at underscoring the need for international cooperation
on combating drugs.
	   But the tour has been overshadowed by McCaffrey's strong
criticism of the Dutch policy of allowing citizens to use marijuana
and other soft drugs for therapeutic and recreational purposes.
	   On Thursday, McCaffrey told CNN's ``Talkback Live'' the policy
was an ``unmitigated disaster'' which had contributed to crime in
the Netherlands.
	   That prompted a sharp response from the Netherlands' ambassador
to the United States, Joris M. Vos, who said he was ``confounded
and dismayed'' by McCaffrey's description of the Netherlands.
	   ``I must say that I find the timing of your remarks, six days
before your planned visit to the Netherlands with a view to gaining
firsthand knowledge about Dutch drugs policy and its results,
rather astonishing,'' Vos wrote McCaffrey.
	   After a press conference Tuesday at the U.N. drug control
headquarters, McCaffrey's spokesman, Robert Housman, distributed a
statement expressing concern that the Dutch government was being
``pulled into an internal political debate'' in the United States
by those who support decriminalizing drugs.
	   ``These legalizers put American children at risk,'' the
statement said. ``The Dutch government should be renouncing them,
not siding with them ... Every nation is free to set their own
policies domestically. However, other nations must respect the
sovereignty of others and be keenly aware of the impacts of their
policies on the global community.''
	   Three hours after handing out the printed statement, Housman
telephoned news agencies to ``retract'' it. He said no new
statement would be issued.
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said
the United States highly values Dutch anti-narcotics cooperation in
Europe, the Caribbean and Latin America.
	   Rubin acknowledged some differences of opinion on domestic drug
policies, but said U.S.-Dutch ``coordination and shared goals
overshadow any differences of emphasis we may have.''
	   McCaffrey was asked at the press conference about his criticism
of the Dutch system.
	   ``We believe a frank exchange of views among friends is most
productive,'' he replied. ``We have a high respect for the Dutch.''
	   In The Hague, Dutch foreign ministry spokeswoman Birgitta
Tazalaar said Dutch officials would welcome McCaffrey but added,
``how can you learn if you are coming with preconceived ideas?''
	   She said the liberal drug policy ``works for us ... We are free
to have our own policy.''
	   McCaffrey arrived here from Sweden and heads for the Netherlands
on Thursday after a visit Wednesday to Switzerland.

Early results give Harvard graduate lead in Ecuador vote

	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) _ Early official results Tuesday gave Quito
Mayor Jamil Mahuad a narrow lead in Ecuador's disputed presidential
runoff, but the vote-counting in his rival's stronghold was
incomplete.
	   Mahuad, who has a master's degree in public administration from
Harvard University, already claimed victory in Sunday's runoff
election and met with officials to discuss the make up of his
government's Cabinet.
	   But his rival Alvaro Noboa, a populist from the port city of
Guayaquil, also claimed victory, saying his private exit poll shows
him with a 3-point lead. Official results were expected Wednesday.
	   Officials said that with more than 95 percent of votes counted
in 17 of Ecuador's 21 provinces, results were confirming an exit
poll that gave Mahuad a 2.6 percent win. But results from the
province of Guayas, Ecuador's most populous province and Noboa's
support base, were incomplete.
	   Noboa accused Mahuad's camp of vote fraud, and called on his
supporters to go to vote-counting stations to prevent officials
from robbing him of his win.
	   International observers monitoring the election rejected the
fraud allegations.
	   Supporters of the candidates clashed briefly outside the
Guayaquil elections board office on Monday, but no injuries or
arrests were reported. Army troops and police surrounded
vote-counting stations, and Ecuador's major cities were calm
Tuesday.
	   Mahuad, 48, and Noboa, 47, were the top vote-getters in the
first round of voting on May 31. Since neither won an outright
majority, a runoff was called.
	   Earlier this week, an exit poll sponsored by seven television
stations gave Mahuad a 51.3 to 48.7 percent lead in the vote. The
difference was within the poll's margin for error.
	   Mahuad, at one time during the campaign, had a 25-point lead in
the polls. He had the support of much of Ecuador's political elite
and business community.
	   During his six-year stint as Quito's mayor, he earned a
reputation as an honest, effective politician.
	   ``Of course, I had expected to win by more votes,'' Mahuad said
in a news conference.
	   Analysts called Noboa's stunning last-minute vote surge a
``wake-up call'' for Ecuador's discredited political establishment.
	   Noboa campaigned as the candidate of the poor, despite being
Ecuador's richest man. He played the role of a political outsider
to tar Mahuad as the establishment candidate.
	   During his campaign, he vowed to give the political elite ``the
beating of the century.''
	   ``The vote is a gesture of protest amid desperation and
abandonment by the state. It is a terrible signal for our political
system,'' said political scientist Carlos Larreategui.
	   Noboa's support surged despite his ties to eccentric former
President Abdala Bucaram, who was removed from power by Congress in
February 1997 for ``mental incapacity'' amid massive protests and
corruption allegations.
	   Congress named Fabian Alarcon as his interim replacement.
	   From exile in Panama, Bucaram called on Ecuadoreans to vote for
Noboa, his friend and political ally.
	   The winner will replace Alarcon on Aug. 10, ending 17 months of
turbulent transitional government that had led to fears for
Ecuador's shaky 19-year-old democracy.

Allegations of illicit relationship in high-profile treason case
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comment by Justice Minister. PICKS UP 11th graf
pvs: Last month, ... &QL; 
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The defense attorney in a high-profile treason
trial said Tuesday that he would ask the judge to withdraw from the
case, claiming the jurist was involved in an ``intensive'' personal
relationship with a female member of the defense team.
	   In a petition to the Supreme Court, the defense attorney, citing
hearsay, also alleged that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
discussed the treason case with Judge Amnon Straschnov while the
trial was under way.
	   Netanyahu's office and a court spokesman denied the allegations.
	   At issue is the case of Nachum Manbar, a former Israeli
paratrooper convicted last month of selling dlrs 16 million worth
of chemical and biological weapons materials to Iran.
	   Straschnov was to hand down Manbar's sentence Wednesday, with
Manbar facing life in prison.
	   Manbar's defense attorney, Amnon Zichroni, will ask the judge at
the beginning of Wednesday's session to disqualify himself, said
Zichroni's spokesman, Dror Arad-Ayalon.
	   Zichroni initially asked the Supreme Court on Tuesday to declare
a mistrial and overturn Manbar's conviction in the Tel Aviv
District Court. However, the court ruled it did not have
jurisdiction in the matter.
	   In his petition to the high court, Zichroni said a member of his
team, attorney Pninat Yanai, 26, maintained a ``close, personal,
intensive relationship'' with Straschnov during the trial and
passed on confidential information about the case to the judge.
	   Zichroni also said Yanai was ``a close friend'' of Netanyahu
spokesman Shai Bazak. Zichroni said he learned from Yanai's former
boyfriend, Ziv Chen, that Bazak had told Yanai the prime minister
had discussed the case with the judge.
	   Bazak called Zichroni's allegations a ``blatant lie'' and
demanded that the attorney apologize.
	   Justice Minister Tsahi Hanegbi accused Zichroni and his
associates of attempting to destroy Straschnov's reputation for
political reasons.
	   ``They are using the court system for the wrong purposes and are
ignoring judicial decisions,'' Hanegbi said to a gathering of top
lawyers, ``They have shaken the foundation of our democracy.''

El Guerrouj breaks world record for 1,500 meters
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to RECAST; updates with more results. &QL; 
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Hicham El Guerrouj took another long stride past
Noureddine Morceli in the annals of middle-distance running
Tuesday, slashing more than a second off the Algerian great's world
record for the 1,500 meters.
	   El Guerrouj, who beat a fading Morceli to take the 1,500 gold at
the World Championships last summer, clocked 3 minutes, 26 seconds
at the Golden Gala meet on a cool night.
	   ``Everything was right in Rome,'' the 23-year-old said after
erasing Morceli's standard of 3:27.37, established at Nice, France,
in July 1995. ``The weather conditions and the track were good, and
I was in the right shape.''
	   El Guerrouj's dominating performance left other top entrants,
including world 5,000 champion Daniel Komen (fourth in 3:31.08),
far behind. The Moroccan dropped to his knees and kissed the track
before being mobbed by other athletes.
	   ``I expect these things,'' El Guerrouj said. ``I came with the
intention of breaking the record. Considering that last year here I
ran 3:30 under the rain, (today's) result is not surprising.''
	   Nor is his ascension to the title of the world's premier middle
distance runner. While Morceli still holds the prestigious record
for the mile, that could be El Guerrouj's next target.
	   El Guerrouj appeared set to end Morceli's reign at the 1996
Olympics, when he caught the pace-setting Algerian with about 500
meters left in the 1,500 final. The two made contact and El
Guerrouj fell after tangling with Morceli's right foot. Morceli
won; El Guerrouj was last.
	   The Moroccan's pursuit of Morceli first bore fruit at the IAAF
Grand Prix Finals in Milan, Italy, in September 1996, when El
Guerrouj ended his rival's four-year winning streak at the
distance.
	   In other events Tuesday, Michael Johnson rebounded from just his
second loss of the decade in the 400 meters to win that race,
Marion Jones continued her dominance of the women's 100, and
veteran Frankie Fredericks stayed on track for a dlrs 1 million
jackpot by winning the men's 100.
	   Johnson covered the 400 in a relatively relaxed 44.40 seconds,
but it was good enough to beat Mark Richardson (second in 44.62)
and Iwan Thomas (fifth in 44.77). The double Olympic champion had
finished behind those two Britons at Oslo, Norway, last Thursday.
	   Jones was never challenged and crossed the line in a blazing
10.74 seconds. Only two women _ Florence Griffith-Joyner, who owns
the record of 10.49, and Merlene Ottey _ have ever run faster. It
was still outside the year's best time of 10.71 that Jones has hit
twice, including at the U.S. Championships, where she defended her
title last month.
	   Jones had a half-hour to recover before the long jump
competition was to start, with all three medalists from Athens
entered: Lyudmila Galkina, Niki Xanthou and Fiona May.
	   In the men's dash, Fredericks outleaned world 200 champ Ato
Boldon to win, 9.97 to 9.99, with world 100 tilist Maurice Greene
third in 10.04.
	   The Golden Gala is the second leg in the new Golden League, a
six-meet series that offers a dlrs 1 million jackpot to anyone who
wins their event at all six venues plus the Grand Prix Finals at
Moscow in September.
	   Elsewhere, world record holder Jonathan Edwards took the triple
jump by leaping 17.60 meters on his only clean effort. American
Bryan Bronson held off world champion Stephane Diagana of France to
take the 400 hurdles, Kevin Toth won the shot put, and Haile
Gebrsellasie won the 5,000 in 13:02.63, more than 20 seconds
outside the record he set last month.
	   Among the women, Angie Vaughn beat another American, Melissa
Morrison, in a photo finish to take the women's 100-meter hurdles;
Nigeria's Charity Opara took the 400 meters; world silver medalist
Yelena Afanasyeva won the 800; and Morocco's Zohra Ouaziz barely
held off former Olympic and world cross country champion Gete Wami
of Ethiopia to take the 5,000 in a meet record 14:44.35.

Ottawa provides additional funding for famine victims
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OTTAWA (CP) _ Canada will provide an additional Canadian dlrs 3
million (U.S. dlrs 2 million) in food aid to famine victims in
Sudan devastated by drought and civil war.
	   ``A humanitarian crisis of massive proportions is unfolding in
Sudan,'' Diane Marleau, minister for international co-operation,
said Tuesday in a news release announcing the extra funding.
	   ``More than 2.4 million people in southern Sudan could die from
starvation. We need to ensure that food reaches those in need and
that the situation does not deteriorate any further.''
	   The money will go to support the World Food Program's emergency
operation in Sudan. The contribution is in response to an urgent
appeal from the organization. Canada has already provided Canadian
dlrs 6 million (U.S. dlrs 4 million) this year to support relief
activities in the country and more than Canadian dlrs 100 million
(U.S. dlrs 68 million) since 1990.
	   The majority of the new contribution is direct food aid and
Canadian dlrs 200,000 (U.S. dlrs 136) will be used to repair roads
to improve access to areas of the country hardest hit by drought.

a 1976 coup, has been held since late June while a judge questioned
him on accusations of child abduction and forgery of identity
documents.
	   Videla, 72, is being prosecuted in connection with five cases,
including those of two children given to a former military doctor.
	   He will remain in jail until the start of his court case,
Federal Judge Roberto Marquevich ruled Tuesday. The judge also said
a lien equivalent to dlrs 5 million had been placed against
Videla's assets in the event of any damage awards.
	   Videla's lawyers are expected to appeal the decision to
prosecute him. Details of Videla's next court appearance were not
immediately available.

British favorites: Woods and Westwood
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TIM DAHLBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SOUTHPORT, England (AP) _ Tiger Woods and England's Lee
Westwood, who were paired for three rounds of the U.S. Open, are
together again, and co-favorites in the British Open.
	   It's the first time since his victory at the 1997 Masters that
Woods has not been listed by the London bookmaker Ladbrokes as the
sole betting favorite for any tournament he's played.
	   Woods and Westwood are both 11-1 in the latest odds to win at
Royal Birkdale, followed by David Duval and Colin Montgomerie at
14-1 and Ernie Els, Fred Couples and Jim Furyk at 16-1. Defending
champion Justin Leonard, Ernie Els and Fred Couples are 16-1, while
Tom Lehman and Mark O'Meara are 25-1.
	   Westwood, the rising British star, earned his co-favorite status
by winning the Loch Lomond tournament last weekend. He has three
victories in his last four European tour starts and seven wins in
seven countries in the past nine months.
	   ``He is showing the two characteristics that the betting public
dreams of, consistency and coolness under pressure,'' Ladbrokes
spokesman Andy Clifton said.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; KUCHAR'S KASH: Matt Kuchar's phone keeps ringing with offers
from agents and others who hope he will turn pro.
	   The star amateur began the year planning to finish his remaining
two years at Georgia Tech. But his strong showing in the Masters
and U.S. Open and his marketable smile have brought promises of big
money.
	   ``I don't really know what a million is going to do for me,''
Kuchar said before going out Tuesday for a practice round. ``I've
always played around with a couple of thousand to get by on tuition
and buying books and buying food for myself.''
	   Kuchar said he is not sure if he will turn pro or go back to
school.
	   ``Right now I am dead in the middle,'' he said. ``It seems to be
all I think about and it's hard to get focused on playing golf when
everybody wants to know what's going to happen in the future.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; JANZEN'S CADDIE: Lee Janzen gave a lot of credit to caddie Dave
Musgrove when he won the U.S. Open. Now Musgrove is carrying
Janzen's bag in a tournament he is a lot more at home in.
	   Musgrove is the only caddie who has been with the winner in
three different majors. He there when Seve Ballesteros won the
British Open in 1979 and when Sandy Lyle took the title in 1985.
	   ``He doesn't even know how many Opens he's been to, he has been
to so many,'' Janzen said. ``He has been here before and that will
be very helpful. He has the experience to know what to do when it
comes to handling the wind.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; TECHNO CLUBS: Golf club technology is moving a little too fast
for the U.S. Golf Association.
	   The organization has told club manufacturers of a proposed test
that can determine the ``spring-like'' effect in a golf club by
measuring the rebound velocity of a golf ball off a club.
	   Last month, the organization said it has developed the test in
response to concerns that sophisticated clubs were making the game
too easy.
	   At the time, the USGA said virtually all the clubs on the market
would pass muster under the new standard. Club manufacturers remain
concerned the USGA wants to restrict any club development at all.
	   The USGA has scheduled a forum for Sept. 28 at its national
headquarters in Far Hills, New Jersey for manufacturers and others
to discuss the proposed new standard.
	   ____ &QC; 
	    &UR; MILLION BUCKS: The British Open title, national adulation and
the dlrs 498,000 first prize aren't the only things at stake for
Lee Westwood at Royal Birkdale.
	   By winning the Loch Lomond World Invitational in Scotland,
Westwood set himself up for a dlrs 1 million bonus if he could win
the British Open.
	   Loch Lomond sponsor, Standard Life, put up the bonus as an
incentive for any player who could win both tournaments.
	   ``If I was to win the Open, the million dollars extra would be
fantastic,'' Westwood said. ``But actually winning the Open means
more to me.''
	   ____ &QC; 
	    &UR; IAN'S BACK: The last time the British Open was played at Royal
Birkdale, Ian Baker-Finch shot 64-66 on the weekend to win by two
strokes.
	   Seven years later, Baker-Finch is back. But this time he'll be
in the broadcast booth for ABC Sports, courtesy of a nose-dive that
began in the years since winning his first and only major.
	   The Australian's only victory since Birkdale was the 1993
Australian PGA, and he has not made a cut in America since 1994.
	   At Royal Troon last year, Baker-Finch withdrew after a 92 in the
first round. At St. Andrews in 1995, he hooked his drive so badly
on the first tee that it cleared the adjacent 18th fairway and went
out of bounds.
	   He said earlier this year he was stepping away from the game,
and will work as a golf broadcaster.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   DIVOTS: Bill Glasson, recovering from elbow surgery, withdrew
from the British Open on Tuesday. That opened a spot for Barry
Lane, the first alternate in qualifying. ... Nick Faldo, who
withdrew from the Loch Lomond tuneup after injuring his elbow in
practice, said he was feeling fine after a practice round on Royal
Birkdale. ... While Jack Nicklaus will miss his first British Open
since 1962, his son, Gary, also missed out on being in the field.
Gary Nicklaus bogeyed the last three holes and then lost in a
playoff for the final qualifying spot.

Leader of ethnic Bubi minority dies in prison in Equatorial Guinea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A prominent opposition leader from the
ethnic Bubi minority in Equatorial Guinea died in prison Tuesday,
national Spanish radio reported.
	   The Spanish Foreign Ministry called for an investigation into
the death of Martin Puye, six weeks after he was sentenced to 26
years in jail at the end of a mass treason trial in this former
Spanish colony, the radio said.
	   Puye belonged to the Bioko Autonomy Movement, an outlawed
political group that opposes Equatorial Guinea's President Teodoro
Obiang.
	   Speaking on the radio, a representative of the organization
blamed Puye's death on inadequate medical treatment as well as the
sequels of torture received prior to the trial.
	   On June 1st a military court in this tiny west African country
sentenced 15 people to death and about 70 others to jail terms of
between six and 26 years.
	   About 30 defendants in the mass trial of over 110 people were
absolved of the treason-related charges stemming from an attack on
a military barracks on the Equatorial Guinean island of Bioko in
January.
	   Last week the international human rights group Amnesty
International warned that some prisoners could die because of the
appalling conditions in jail.
	   Amnesty said that at least six people had died during pretrial
detention and that the confessions were forced out of prisoners
with torture.
	   The group had earlier denounced that the trial was part of a
crackdown by Obiang on the ethnic Bubi, the majority of whom live
on the island of Bioko.
	   Several European countries and the United States, has long
accused Obiang's government of human rights violations.
	   Obiang seized power in this oil-rich country wedged between
Cameroon and Gabon in 1979 by overthrowing his uncle Francisco
Macias Nguema.

El Guerrouj breaks world record for 1,500 meters
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS Jones time to 10.75 sted 10.74; UPDATES with Jones
adding long jump win, Masterkova winning women's 1,500 in year's
best time, Harden last in men's 100. TRIMS at bottom. &QL; 
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Hicham El Guerrouj took another long stride past
Noureddine Morceli in the annals of middle-distance running
Tuesday, slashing more than a second off the Algerian great's world
record for the 1,500 meters.
	   El Guerrouj, who beat a fading Morceli to take the 1,500 gold at
the World Championships last summer, clocked 3 minutes, 26 seconds
at the Golden Gala meet on a cool night.
	   ``Everything was right in Rome,'' the 23-year-old said after
erasing Morceli's standard of 3:27.37, established at Nice, France,
in July 1995. ``The weather conditions and the track were good, and
I was in the right shape.''
	   El Guerrouj's dominating performance left other top entrants,
including world 5,000 champion Daniel Komen (fourth in 3:31.08),
far behind. The Moroccan dropped to his knees and kissed the track
before being mobbed by other athletes.
	   In other events Tuesday, Marion Jones managed the night's only
double, continuing her dominance of the 100 meters and then going
out and beating a tough field in the long jump. Also, Michael
Johnson rebounded from just his second loss of the decade in the
400 meters to win that race; Svetlana Masterkova won the women's
1,500 in the year's best time, and veteran Frankie Fredericks
stayed on track for a dlrs 1 million jackpot by winning the men's
100.
	   ``I expect these things,'' El Guerrouj said of his run. ``I came
with the intention of breaking the record. Considering that last
year here I ran 3:30 under the rain, (today's) result is not
surprising.''
	   Nor is his ascension to the title of the world's premier middle
distance runner. While Morceli still holds the prestigious record
for the mile, that could be El Guerrouj's next target.
	   El Guerrouj appeared set to end Morceli's reign at the 1996
Olympics, when he caught the pace-setting Algerian with about 500
meters left in the 1,500 final. The two made contact and El
Guerrouj fell after tangling with Morceli's right foot. Morceli
won; El Guerrouj was last.
	   The Moroccan's pursuit of Morceli first bore fruit at the IAAF
Grand Prix Finals in Milan, Italy, in September 1996, when El
Guerrouj ended his rival's four-year winning streak at the
distance.
	   Jones, the world champion in the 100, was never challenged in
the dash and crossed the line in a blazing 10.75 seconds, a
quarter-second faster than runner-up Chrystie Gaines. Only two
women _ Florence Griffith-Joyner, who owns the record of 10.49, and
Merlene Ottey _ have ever run faster. It was still outside the
year's best time of 10.71 that Jones has hit twice, including at
the U.S. Championships, where she defended her title last month.
	   She had a half-hour to recover before the long jump, where she
beat all three medalists from Athens: Lyudmila Galkina, Niki
Xanthou and Fiona May. The American's top effort of 7.23 meters
easily bettered May, who went 6.89.
	   Johnson covered the 400 in a relatively relaxed 44.40 seconds,
but it was good enough to beat Mark Richardson (second in 44.62)
and Iwan Thomas (fifth in 44.77). The double Olympic champion had
finished behind those two Britons at Oslo, Norway, last Thursday.
	   Double Olympic champion Masterkova covered the 1,500 in 3:58.42,
a meet record and better than two seconds quicker than the prior
year's best time.
	   In the men's dash, Fredericks outleaned world 200 champ Ato
Boldon to win, 9.97 to 9.99, with world 100 titlist Maurice Greene
third in 10.04. Tim Harden, who triumphed at the U.S. Championships
after defending titlist Greene withdrew with cramps, was last
Tuesday in 10.28.
	   The Golden Gala is the second leg in the new Golden League, a
six-meet series that offers a dlrs 1 million jackpot to anyone who
wins their event at all six venues plus the Grand Prix Finals at
Moscow in September.
	   Elsewhere, Jonathan Edwards took the triple jump by leaping
17.60 meters on his only clean effort; American Bryan Bronson won
the 400 hurdles, Kevin Toth won the shot put, and Haile
Gebrsellasie won the 5,000 in 13:02.63, more than 20 seconds
outside the record he set last month.
	   Among the women, Angie Vaughn beat another American, Melissa
Morrison, in a photo finish in the 100 hurdles; Nigeria's Charity
Opara won the 400 meters; world silver medalist Yelena Afanasyeva
won the 800; and Morocco's Zohra Ouaziz won the 5,000.

J.P. Morgan, Norwest have earnings gains, but First Union has drop
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing stock prices.
 &UR; By PATRICIA LAMIELL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ J.P. Morgan and Co. Inc. said Tuesday its
second-quarter net earnings rose 29 percent, bolstered by strong
trading and corporate finance revenues.
	   Meanwhile, two regional banks big on the merger scene reported
mixed earnings results.
	   Norwest Corp., which has agreed to merge with Wells Fargo and
Co., said its profit for the April-June quarter rose 15 percent on
brisk business in most of its banking operations.
	   First Union Corp. said its net earnings dropped 63 percent
because of a dlrs 634 million charge for merger related expenses,
including the acquisition of the Money Store and CoreStates
Financial Corp.
 &UR; J.P. Morgan
	   The nation's fourth-largest bank said net earnings were dlrs 481
million, or dlrs 2.36 per share, up from dlrs 374 million, or dlrs
1.85.
	   The results included a one-time gain of dlrs 79 million after
taxes, for the sale of the firm's global trust and agency services
businesses.
	   Excluding the gain, Morgan's operating earnings rose 7 percent
to dlrs 402 million, or dlrs 1.96 per share on a diluted basis,
from dlrs 374 million, or dlrs 1.85, last year.
	   Combined interest and non-interest revenues rose to dlrs 2.15
billion from dlrs 1.79 billion.
	   The net results beat Wall Street's expectations for earnings of
dlrs 1.90 per share, according to First Call. The bank's shares
soared dlrs 7.56 to dlrs 133.56 on the New York Stock Exchange.
	   Revenue from client-focused activities _ which include corporate
finance and advisory, market-making, and asset management and
servicing _ rose 28 percent. But revenue from stock investments and
Morgan's trading for its own account fell 31 percent.
	   Morgan said it reduced its exposure to the floundering Asian
markets by 26 percent from the first quarter, to dlrs 3.4 billion.
	   Net earnings for the first half of the year dropped to dlrs 718
million, or dlrs 3.51 per share, from dlrs 798 million, or dlrs
3.89. Excluding the special items, operating income was dlrs 768
million, or dlrs 3.76 a diluted share.
 &UR; Norwest
	   Net earnings at the nation's ninth-largest banking company,
based in Minneapolis, rose to dlrs 382 million, or 49 cents per
diluted share, from dlrs 331.4 million, or 43 cents, in the
year-ago quarter.
	   Combined interest and non-interest income was dlrs 2.76 billion,
up 14 percent from dlrs 2.42 billion.
	   The earnings were in line with analysts' expectations. Norwest
shares rose dlrs 1.25 to dlrs 39.38 on the NYSE.
	   Norwest's banking group earned dlrs 274.4 million in the
quarter, up 19 percent, while mortgage banking profits rose 53
percent to dlrs 54 million. Norwest Financial, the company's credit
card unit, was the only one that suffered, reporting a 19 percent
in profits to dlrs 53 million on higher consumer credit losses.
	   Through the first six months of its fiscal year, Norwest profits
also rose 15 percent, to dlrs 749.8 million, or 96 cents per share
on a diluted basis, from dlrs 653.3 million, or 85 cents per share
in 1997.
	   Norwest announced in June it would merge with Wells Fargo and
Co., which is based in San Francisco. The dlrs 34 billion deal will
push the combined banks to seventh in size.
 &UR; First Union
	   Net earnings, including a dlrs 634 million charge for merger
expenses, dropped 63 percent to dlrs 249 million, or 26 cents per
diluted share, from dlrs 682 million, or 70 cents per share, for
the second quarter a year ago.
	   Counting the merger expenses, operating earnings rose 23 percent
to a record dlrs 883 million, or 92 cents per share on a diluted
basis, from dlrs 719 million, or 74 cents per share, in the
year-ago quarter.
	   The operating earnings exceeded analysts' expected 90 cents per
share, according to First Call. First Union's stock gained dlrs
1.81 to dlrs 64.81 on the Big Board.
	   The bank attributed the higher operating earnings to a rise in
fee income of 61 percent for investment banking and brokerage
businesses, and 53 percent for commercial lending.
	   The bank also cited a drop in nonperforming assets as a
percentage of net loans and foreclosed properties, as well as lower
annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of average net loans.
	   For the first half of the year, net income fell 25 percent to
dlrs 1.04 billion, or dlrs 1.07 per diluted share, from dlrs 1.39
billion, or dlrs 1.42 per diluted share a year ago. Operating
earnings for the first six months increased 19 percent to dlrs 1.7
billion compared with dlrs 1.4 billion in the first six months of
1997.

Heggem to sign contract with Liverpool
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TRONDHEIM, Norway (AP) _ Norwegian international Vegard Heggem
from Rosenborg signed a contract with Liverpool on Tuesday. The
transfer fee will probably be around 40 million Norwegian kroner or
dlrs 5.2 million.
	   Heggem, 23, has wanted to play in the Premier League for a long
time.
	   ``Rosenborg has let me go from Monday, and I'm looking forward
to be a Liverpool player enormously,'' Heggem told Norwegian news
agency NTB.
	   ``We got an offer from Liverpool, which the board decided to
accept. I expect Vegard to be a Liverpool player shortly; that is
what he wants,'' confirmed Rosenborg chairman Curt Christiansen.
	   Rosenborg coach Trond Sollied previously said that no one except
defender Erik Hoftun would be allowed to leave Rosenborg before the
end of the Norwegian season in October, and they want their players
for the Champions League as well.
	   Heggem could play his first game for Liverpool on Aug. 16
against Southampton, and Liverpool will also play Rosenborg in a
friendly on Aug. 29 in Oslo.
	   Heggem will be the fourth former Rosenborg player in Liverpool
in addition to Stig Inge Bjornebye, Bjorn Tore Kvarme and Oyvind
Leonardsen.
	   Many clubs have also wanted Rosenborg midfielder Roar Strand,
but he has recently signed a lifelong contract with Rosenborg until
2003.

San Diego group builds high school for Mexican Indian rebels

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OVENTIC, Mexico (AP) _ A masked Zapatista leader and a
California man have inaugurated a high school for Tzotzil Indians _
donated by a San Diego group _ in the heart of rebel territory on
the highlands of Chiapas state.
	   A Zapatista National Liberation Army commander known only as
Ezequiel and Peter Brown, head of the private group San Diegans for
Peace, inaugurated the school building Monday in a simple ceremony.
	   The San Diego group, which promotes ties between teachers in the
United States and rebel Indian communities in Chiapas, has put up
dlrs 30,000 for the building, which is three-quarters finished,
Comandante Ezequiel said. Another dlrs 10,000 is needed to complete
it.
	   Ezequiel, who also is the school's coordinator-general, said the
school will enroll up to 200 students at a time divided into equal
day and evening shifts.
	   The building has four classrooms, a dining hall, two
dormitories, an auditorium, several workshops and a computer
center.
	   Ezequiel said the school plans to start classes around September
and its curriculum will include mathematics, Tzotzil along with
Spanish and foreign languages, natural and social sciences, as well
as the arts.
	   Oventic, about 40 miles (65 kilometers) north of San Cristobal
de las Casas, is one of 32 so-called ``autonomous communities'' the
Zapatista rebels have set up during the past three years, cutting
up areas in several Chiapas municipalities which are the equivalent
of counties.
	   Federal and state governments have used armed troops and
paramilitary gangs to break up at least four of these symbolic
communities since November. Dozens of Indian villagers have been
killed and wounded and dozens more arrested.
	   The Oventic school has been named the January 1 Autonomous Rebel
High School, after the 1994 date when the Zapatistas rose up in
arms to demand an end to oppression and abject poverty.
	   ``We want to demonstrate to the bad government and the entire
world that _ yes _ we can build and administer a new kind of
education for the Indians, who have not been able to study because
of poverty,'' Ezequiel said.
	   Since peace talks broke down in 1996 the Zapatistas have kept a
low profile, giving no answer to government calls to renew
negotiations.
	   Ezequiel's appearance along with Brown is unusual because the
government in recent months has been waging a firm campaign against
foreign involvement in the Chiapas rebellion.
	   Scores of foreigners, including accredited human rights
observers, have been forced to leave for allegedly violating
Mexico's law against foreign participation in politics.

World Health Organization says polio eradication in home stretch
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ An effort to eradicate polio by the year
2000 is entering the final stretch, but money is still needed to
verify the disease has disappeared from areas in South Asia and
Africa, a U.N. agency said Tuesday.
	   Polio is still circulating widely in Bangladesh, India, Nepal,
Pakistan, Congo, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Somalia and Sudan, the World
Health Organization said in a statement.
	   Representatives from U.N. agencies and other organizations
meeting in Geneva for an annual meeting voiced concern that a
shortfall in money and complacency could thwart efforts to rid the
world of the disease by their goal of 2,000.
	   The group called on all U.N. agencies, governments and other
organizations to make eradication a top priority. Money is needed
to properly equip laboratories so that epidemiologists can certify
that countries are clear of the disease.
	   ``We are virtually on the home stretch and we badly need the
second wind to finish on time,'' said Bruce Aylward, who leads the
WHO eradication initiative.
	   He said dlrs 1.5 billion would be saved in health care costs
each year because children wouldn't have to be vaccinated.
	   The crippling disease has been wiped out in the Western
Hemisphere since 1991. But all children, even in polio-free
countries like the United States, must continue to be vaccinated
until the virus is wiped out worldwide _ because infected travelers
can easily spread polio to any part of the world.
	   The polio viral infection spreads to the spinal cord and brain,
causing paralysis and sometimes even death.

Nevis to vote on whether to secede from two-island nation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAWUD BYRON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BASSETERRE, St. Kitts and Nevis (AP) _ Residents of the
Caribbean island of Nevis will vote Aug. 10 on whether to break
with nearby St. Kitts and become a new country, the island's
premier announced Tuesday.
	   Premier Vance Amory made the announcement during a special
meeting of the Nevis Island Assembly on Tuesday morning. He called
the referendum ``a glorious day'' for the island's 10,000
inhabitants.
	   The island's five lawmakers voted in October to secede, but the
move requires a two-thirds vote by the island's 6,000 registered
voters.
	   Nevisians have long complained that their 37-square-mile
(95-square-kilometer) island, an upmarket tourist destination and
haven for offshore banks, is neglected by the government in St.
Kitts, population 33,000.
	   The island contributes 38 percent of the federation's tax
revenue but only receives 21 percent of government spending, Amory
claimed.
	   In a nonbinding vote in 1974, about 80 percent of Nevis
residents voted to become a separate state. The movement stalled in
1980 with the election of the Nevis Reformation Party, which is
friendly to the St. Kitts government.
	   Nevis reluctantly joined St. Kitts after the two islands won
independence from Britain in 1983. Neighbors Anguilla and the
British Virgin Islands decided to remain British possessions.
	   A clause in the country's constitution allows a split, and the
federation's prime minister, Denzil Douglas, has said he would not
oppose secession.
	   If separatists win the referendum, the two islands will have to
decide how to divide airspace, territorial waters and government
offices.
	   Once dependent on sugar, cotton and coconuts for revenue, both
islands rely increasingly on tourism, offshore banking and light
industries for income.

Holyfield might fight Akinwande in August
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Evander Holyfield could fight Henry Akinwande in
a mandatory defense of his WBC heavyweight title in late August or
early September.
	   The fight was supposed to happen June 6 in Madison Square
Garden, but was postponed after Akinwande tested positive for
hepatitis B the day before the match.
	   Marina Capurro, vice president of communications for Showtime,
said Tuesday that Dr. Donald Kaminsky interpreted Akinwade's latest
blood test as showing the residual strain of the virus in his
system to be noninfectious, but that the doctor will seek other
opinions.
	   ``The fight could be Aug. 29 (in New York) or Sept. 5 (at Las
Vegas)'' Capurro said. ``No one really knows now.''
	   ``When the fight was postponed, we put a hold on Aug. 29, so
that date is open,'' said Bill Jemas, executive vice president of
Madison Square Garden Sports Group.
	   The fight would be carried on pay-per-view by Showtime Event
Television.

Briton seeks safe passage for food to southern Sudan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Incorporates material from Sudan-Battle &QL; 
 &UR; By DIANNA CAHN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ With heavy fighting cutting off the supply
of food to southern Sudan, a British official met with senior
Sudanese rebels Tuesday in hopes of arranging a cease-fire and safe
routes for relief aid.
	   The U.N. food agency said fighting between rebels and government
troops in Sudan has driven thousands of people from their villages.
Millions are threatened by civil war and famine.
	   ``Some of the women and children are horrendously
malnourished,'' said Ismat Fahmi, World Food Program deputy
representative in the Sudanese capital, Khartoum. ``More and more
we are hearing that lack of food, disease and raids by armed men
are big factors, forcing entire communities to flee their
villages.''
	   Derek Fatchett, Britain's Foreign and Commonwealth Office
Minister, planned to leave for Khartoum later Tuesday for talks
with government officials.
	   He was proposing a three-month cease-fire along key road, river
and rail routes into southern Sudan.
	   ``We cannot turn our back on their plight,'' Fatchett said.
``For them, the political settlement may be too long in coming.
That is why the notion of safe aid corridors is so important.''
	   Rebels of the Sudan People's Liberation Army have been fighting
the Khartoum government since 1983 for autonomy for the Christian
and animist south from the Arab and Muslim north.
	   An estimated 1.5 million people have died in the fighting and
accompanying famine. International relief agencies say fighting and
lack of funds prevent them from reaching the worst-hit areas.
	   The rebels, meanwhile, claimed they killed 273 government
soldiers in a battle for Ulu, a town near the Ethiopian border.
There was no independent confirmation of the report.
	   Other relief agencies reported mounting death tolls Tuesday as
fighting prevented food from reaching the worst-affected areas.
	   Fatchett said aid agencies currently spend 90 percent of their
funds to bring in food by air _ leaving only 10 percent to buy the
food and emergency supplies.
	   He said officials of the Sudan Peoples' Liberation Movement, the
rebels' political arm, voiced ``no objections in principle to the
idea,'' but raised detailed points that needed to be explored. He
did not elaborate.
	   He said Britain was putting forth the proposal under the
auspices of the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development, a
regional grouping of countries in eastern Africa and the Horn of
Africa which has been trying to broker a negotiated settlement to
Sudan's 15-year war.

Olympic officer says Utah will reap financial windfall from Games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) _ Utah will benefit financially from the
2002 Winter Games, state Olympic officer John Fowler told the
Legislature's Sports Advisory Committee on Tuesday.
	   In his first annual report, Fowler estimated the Olympics will
cost the state more than dlrs 28 million for everything from new
roads to economic development promotions.
	   But Utah is expected to collect more than dlrs 47 million from
increased economic activity related to the Olympics. In addition,
the Salt Lake Organizing Committee is obligated to repay the dlrs
59 million spent by the state for Olympic facilities.
	   Most of the numbers aren't new and are only preliminary and are
likely to change once Olympic organizers finalize a major overhaul
of their dlrs 1 billion-plus budget later this year.
	   State law requires the Olympic officer to report once a year to
the Sports Advisory Committee on the financial impact of the Games.
He also recommends what costs should be absorbed by taxpayers.
	   The only state service requested so far by SLOC, according to
the report, is dlrs 860,000 for improvements at the cross-country
and biathlon venue at Wasatch Mountain State Park.
	   The report was Fowler's first since becoming the state's Olympic
watchdog last fall. The Olympic officer reviews contracts between
state agencies and the organizing committee before turning them
over to Gov. Mike Leavitt for approval.
	   Fowler has taken an active role in negotiating several
contracts, including recent deals with the University of Utah that
will bring the campus more than dlrs 32 million.
	   The school is getting the money from SLOC to help pay for
Olympic housing, as well as the expansion of Rice Stadium for the
opening and closing ceremonies.

Athletics down Angels; Devil Rays edge Red Sox
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW with Tuesday's early games; will be updated &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   OAKLAND, California (AP) _ Kenny Rogers pitched six scoreless
innings before leaving with soreness in his left hamstring as the
Oakland Athletics defeated Anaheim 6-2 Tuesday for their fifth
straight win over the Angels.
	   Rogers (9-3), who allowed four hits and walked three, was
visited on the mound during the sixth inning by a trainer and
manager Art Howe. He got out of the inning, leaving runners on
second and third, but did not return.
	   Rogers gave the A's 30 wins by starting pitchers this year, one
more than the entire 1997 season.
	   The A's scored three runs in the first on RBI singles by Matt
Stairs and Jason Giambi and a sacrifice fly by Miguel Tejada. They
added two in the second on a wild pitch by Omar Olivares (5-6) and
another RBI single by Stairs.
 &UR; Devil Rays 5, Red Sox 4
	   In St. Petersburg, Florida, Miguel Cairo's ninth-inning single
drove in the winning run as Tampa Bay ended its 11-game losing
streak.
	   Cairo singled up the middle off Carlos Reyes after Bobby Smith
singled and Paul Sorrento doubled off Ron Mahay (1-1). Sorrento's
double was for his fourth hit of the game.
	   Sorrento also homered off Bret Saberhagen for Tampa Bay's first
run in the fifth inning. Albie Lopez (5-2) pitched two innings to
get the victory.
 &UR; Tigers 8, Royals 3
	   In Detroit, Justin Thompson finally won a home game and Tony
Clark hit a three-run homer as Detroit beat Kansas City.
	   Luis Gonzalez and Deivi Cruz also homered and Damion Easley
added a two-run double for the Tigers.

Kuchar torn by decision whether to turn pro
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SOUTHPORT, England (AP) _ The smile still comes easily to Matt
Kuchar. Everything else about golf is eating away at the
20-year-old amateur, who may not be an amateur much longer.
	   Just four months ago, Kuchar was a sophomore at Georgia Tech,
the first player to win the U.S. Amateur since Tiger Woods decided
there was nothing left to prove in that arena.
	   But that innocent, pinch-me-I'm-dreaming demeanor that Kuchar
carried around Augusta National and The Olympic Club, where he
played well enough to earn a trip back to next year's Masters and
U.S. Open, is now burdened by expectations these days.
	   On Tuesday, Kuchar was afforded rare treatment for an amateur
who didn't appear on the Mike Douglas show at age 2. And he is sure
to be fodder for the British tabloids, although it won't have
anything to do with whom he's dating or the private life of his
dentist.
	   Everything comes back to money, and Kuchar is next in line to
cash in. The question is when?
	   He answered it the only way he knows how _ with a smile.
	   ``I don't know what to do,'' he said. ``I'm dead in the middle.
I've thought about it ever since the Open finished. It seems to be
all I think about. It's hard to get focused on playing golf when
everybody wants to know what's going to happen next.''
	   Agents are calling by the dozens, all wanting a piece of that
million-dollar smile. The only escape figures to be inside the
ropes, but that's where Kuchar is tormented the most.
	   ``There's a lot of second-guessing,'' he said. ``You hit a bad
shot and you're thinking, `I may not be ready.' Then you hit a good
shot, and maybe I am.''
	   This much is clear: Kuchar's popularity cannot be any higher
than it is now, unless he can find a way to navigate the bumps and
burns of British golf to another sterling finish. He missed the cut
at Loch Lomond in Scotland last week for the first time this year,
and that includes two majors and two PGA Tour events.
	   What if he fails to defend his U.S. Amateur title next month, or
doesn't even get to the quarterfinals?
	   If Kuchar doesn't realize how finicky the game of golf is, all
he has to do is look up Corey Pavin or Mark Brooks this week _ or
go to the ABC booth to find Ian Baker-Finch, who won the Open at
Birkdale in 1991 but now has trouble breaking 80.
	   Endorsement figures from industry insiders start around dlrs 2
million and go as high as dlrs 10 million, numbers that might be
difficult to digest for a college student who's thrilled with a few
thousand bucks for room and board.
	   ``It's a chance to set myself financially for a long period of
time,'' Kuchar said. ``Hopefully, it works out well enough where I
will be set, that this is the prime time for me to go and turn pro,
and that sponsors want me.''
	   So, why is this such a difficult decision?
	   There is nothing to gain by remaining an amateur except for
winning an NCAA championship _ does anyone remember who won in the
two years since Woods left Stanford?
	   Woods was at these crossroads less than two years ago after
winning his third straight Amateur. Then again, Woods had dlrs 40
million in endorsements waiting for him.
	   Asked what advice he would offer, Woods said only to ``not do it
for anybody else but yourself.''
	   ``It's not an easy one,'' Woods said. ``It's not one you wake up
and say, `It's time to go.' Look at options and pick the one that's
best for you.''

Northern Ireland buries three brothers killed in firebombing

 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS age of three boy's surviving brother graf 11

<TEXT>
	   BALLYMONEY, Northern Ireland (AP) _ On a cold, gray July day, in
the ``saddest of sad funerals,'' Northern Ireland said a
tear-filled farewell Tuesday to three young brothers incinerated in
a sectarian attack that came as they slept in their beds.
	   As a bell tolled mournfully, the small coffins of Richard, Mark
and Jason Quinn _ three boys born to a Catholic mother who were
being raised Protestant _ were carried into a rural Roman Catholic
church by strapping young men whose faces were contorted with
grief.
	   ``We meet in sorrow for the death of these children, but our
shared sorrow is a beacon of hope for all our community,'' said the
Rev. Peter Forde, Ballymoney's Roman Catholic parish priest. ``And
in this, our very troubled country, may it light our way ahead.''
	   The hundreds of Catholic and Protestant mourners who overflowed
the Church of Our Lady and St. Patrick cried throughout much of the
90-minute Requiem Mass. But it was a heartfelt poem written by two
young women who knew the boys that struck the deepest chord _ and
drew spontaneous applause.
	   ``Why would someone do this, is the question on our lips. Who
would have so much evil at their fingertips?'' one of the women,
Andrea Ramsey, read in a strong, clear voice.
	   ``Three jolly fellas, who had so much to learn and enjoy, have
been snatched away from us today,'' she continued. ``And we all
have a feeling of loss that will never go away.''
	   ``Richard, Mark and Jason, in our memories you will stay. I can
still feel the cold, wet lips of when I kissed you and then you ran
away.''
	   The crowd murmurred its approval of the line: ``Oh Lord, please
let the evil people be brought to justice some day.''
	   Tensions spilling over from a Protestant march blocked since
July 5 near Portadown, about 60 miles (100 kms) southwest of
Ballymoney, were blamed for the Sunday morning firebombing of the
Quinn house.
	   Authorities said they believed the family was targeted because
Chrissie Quinn, 29, lived there with her Protestant boyfriend. Two
men are being questioned in connection with the attack.
	   Throughout most of Tuesday's Mass, Ms. Quinn and the boys'
12-year-old brother Lee, who survived because he was spending the
night at his grandmothers', sat dazed and expressionless, still in
shock.

	   LONDON (AP) _ A government review dismissed fears over the
safety of silicone breast implants Tuesday, rejecting a U.S.-style
ban on cosmetic implants, but called for tougher controls over
their use.
	   Thousands of women have claimed that leaking silicone implants
have caused a variety of problems ranging from memory loss and
partial paralysis to rheumatism and arthritis. Opponents have
called for the devices to be banned.
	   Developed in the 1960s, they have been outlawed for cosmetic
surgery in the United States since 1992 and last week, American
manufacturer Dow Corning, the largest of the four producers of
silicone implants, agreed a dlrs 3 billion plan to compensate
170,000 women worldwide who registered claims against them. None of
the companies have admitted liability.

Briton seeks safe passage for food to southern Sudan

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ With heavy fighting cutting off the supply
of food to southern Sudan, a British official met with senior
Sudanese rebels Tuesday in hopes of arranging a cease-fire and safe
routes for relief aid.
	   The U.N. food agency said fighting between rebels and government
troops in Sudan has driven thousands of people from their villages.
Millions are threatened by civil war and famine.
	   ``Some of the women and children are horrendously
malnourished,'' said Ismat Fahmi, World Food Program deputy
representative in the Sudanese capital, Khartoum. ``More and more
we are hearing that lack of food, disease and raids by armed men
are big factors, forcing entire communities to flee their
villages.''
	   Derek Fatchett, Britain's Foreign and Commonwealth Office
Minister, planned to leave for Khartoum later Tuesday for talks
with government officials.
	   He was proposing a three-month cease-fire along key road, river
and rail routes into southern Sudan.
	   ``We cannot turn our back on their plight,'' Fatchett said.
``For them, the political settlement may be too long in coming.
That is why the notion of safe aid corridors is so important.''
	   Rebels of the Sudan People's Liberation Army have been fighting
the Khartoum government since 1983 for autonomy for the Christian
and animist south from the Arab and Muslim north.
	   An estimated 1.5 million people have died in the fighting and
accompanying famine. International relief agencies say fighting and
lack of funds prevent them from reaching the worst-hit areas.
	   The rebels, meanwhile, claimed they killed 273 government
soldiers in a battle for Ulu, a town near the Ethiopian border.
There was no independent confirmation of the report.
	   Other relief agencies reported mounting death tolls Tuesday as
fighting prevented food from reaching the worst-affected areas.
	   Fatchett said aid agencies currently spend 90 percent of their
funds to bring in food by air _ leaving only 10 percent to buy the
food and emergency supplies.
	   He said officials of the Sudan Peoples' Liberation Movement, the
rebels' political arm, voiced ``no objections in principle to the
idea,'' but raised detailed points that needed to be explored. He
did not elaborate.
	   He said Britain was putting forth the proposal under the
auspices of the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development, a
regional grouping of countries in eastern Africa and the Horn of
Africa which has been trying to broker a negotiated settlement to
Sudan's 15-year war.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ An earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 4.6
shook areas northeast of Tokyo on Wednesday morning, but there were
no immediate reports of damage or injuries, police said.
	   The earthquake was centered about 50 kilometers (31 miles)
underground in southern Ibaraki Prefecture, or state, about 100
kilometers (63 miles), northeast of the capital, the Meteorological
Agency said.
	   The quake hit at 7:09 a.m. (2209 GMT Tuesday), the agency said.
	   Also, a magnitude 2.0 quake was recorded in waters near Izu
Oshima, a resort island south of Tokyo, at 7:25 a.m. (2225 GMT
Tuesday), the agency said.

Roster at 15 as USA Team heads to Monte Carlo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ The USA Basketball men's team had its roster
reduced to 15 Tuesday on its final day of training at Moody Bible
Institute.
	   Warren Kidd, formerly of Middle Tennessee State who played last
year with Stefanel Milano in Italy, withdrew from consideration for
the final roster because of a pelvis injury. He is a 6-10
(2.05-meter) forward-center.
	   Following the team's training sessions in Monte Carlo from July
15-23, a final 12-member team will be announced.
	   With a lockout and threat of a boycott, USA Basketball removed
the 12 National Basketball Association players initially selected
for the world championships and replaced them with a host of
players with a variety of experience.
	   Of the 15 players still on the roster, five played in a
professional foreign league last year, five played in the CBA,
another played in both the CBA and Europe, two are current college
underclassmen and two completed their college eligibility last
year.
	   The USA team will begin preliminary play in the World
championships July 29 against Brazil in Greece.
	   ``I've been in pro camps where it's taken longer to pick up the
basic concepts of what we're trying to do and we're going to get
better and we'll keep working at it, but it's been a good start,''
USA coach Rudy Tomjanovich said.
	   ``I like our mix, we have guys from all walks of basketball. ...
We've got guys who are honored to be here, and we'll go out and do
the best we can.''
	   The remaining 15 members of the roster are Wendell Alexis,
Ashraf Amaya, Earl Boykins, Tim Breauz, Mateen Cleaves, Bill
Edwards, Kiwane Garris, Michael Hawkins, Gerard King, Jimmy King,
Trajan Langdon, Brad Miller, Jimmy Oliver, Jason Sasser and David
Wood.
	   During its stay in Monte Carlo, the USA team will play
exhibition games against France on July 18 and Spain the next day.
It will then move on to Rome for three days of training and an
exhibition game against Italy. USA will then head to Greece on July
26.

Hoover wins four cases brought in `free flights' debacle

 &UR; Eds: RAISES details on contest. RECASTS, EDITS to conform &QL; 
 &UR; By DIRK BEVERIDGE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Appliance maker Hoover won four lawsuits Tuesday
stemming from an embarrassing ``free flights'' promotion that cost
millions and made the company a laughingstock.
	   Hoover is hoping to finally end the mess it created through the
ill-fated sales promotion, but consumer activists are not ready to
throw in the towel and estimate hundreds of thousands of people
still may have grounds to sue.
	   The wrangling results from a Hoover promise in late 1992 and
early 1993 of two free international airplane flights to anybody in
Britain and Ireland who brought an appliance for as little as 100
pounds, about dlrs 165 at current exchange rates.
	   The response overwhelmed Hoover.
	   Many people bought vacuum cleaners just so they could get a free
vacation. When Hoover turned to technicalities to stop them, many
kept fighting. It turned into one of the biggest marketing mistakes
in corporate history.
	   Hoover Europe's former corporate parent, the Maytag Corp., of
Newton, Iowa, finally spent dlrs 72 million to fly some 220,000
customers on their trips.
	   Judge Ivor Bennett, sitting in tiny St. Helens just outside
Liverpool, ruled Tuesday that Hoover was not in breach of contract
against four would-be travelers, Harold Bray, Colleen Codling,
Jacqueline Freeman and Roger Diament.
	   Harry Cichy, who heads the Hoover Holiday Pressure Group,
claimed the four consumers were victimized by fine print. In some
cases, people were offered tickets from cities far away from their
home towns.
	   ``They're winning at the moment,'' conceded Cichy, who heads the
consumer activist organization and contends the battle against
Hoover may not be over.
	   He said up to 350,000 people in Britain and Ireland might have
grounds to sue. The group had hoped to file a class-action suit on
behalf of those consumers against the Hoover European Appliance
Group.
	   Cichy noted that the Hoover Holiday Pressure Group had
previously won two test cases _ and they were upheld on appeal _
before Tuesday's losses.
	   ``We're disappointed with today's outcome, but it has to be
taken as a whole,'' Cichy said. ``They can't take the first two
away.''
	   Several more lawsuits are still in the pipeline before Judge
Bennett. Cichy said his group's lawyers will have to study verdicts
in 14 separate test cases before deciding whether to file a
class-action suit.
	   Hoover, meanwhile, hopes the cases it has won will set the
precedent. ``We are confident of similar outcomes in the future,''
the company said in a statement Tuesday.
	   Hoover pointed out it has prevailed in most of the lawsuits
filed in the free-flights saga in various courts around Britain,
although spokeswoman Caroline Knight said she was unable to provide
any exact tally.
	   Maytag no longer owns Hoover Europe. It sold the business to the
Italian appliance maker Candy S.p.A, although Maytag had to set up
a fund to deal with the free-flights litigation.

Nicaragua and others again raise Taiwan issue for General Assembly

<TEXT>
	   UNITED STATES (AP) _ For the sixth straight year, Taiwan's
allies in the General Assembly have asked that the territory be
readmitted to the United Nations. China denounced the request
Tuesday as a move to split a sovereign state.
	   Eleven countries led by Nicaragua have asked that the status of
Taiwan be placed on the agenda of the next General Assembly
session, which gets under way in September. Five such requests have
been turned down by the assembly's steering committee, which will
convene at the start of the session to consider the agenda.
	   The Taiwanese government lost its seat in the United Nations in
1971 when the organization accepted the Communist government in
Beijing as the sole representative of the Chinese people.
	   China strongly opposes representation for Taiwan, which it
considers a renegade province. As a permanent member of the
Security Council, the Beijing government wields considerable
influence as well as a veto in the council.
	   As it has done in the past, Nicaragua is spearheading the effort
to bring the issue before the assembly. Joining in this year were
Burkina Faso, El Salvador, Gambia, Grenada, Liberia, Sao Tome and
Principe, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Senegal, Swaziland and
Solomon Islands.
	   Their request cited Taiwan's economic strength and willingness
to give aid to developing nations as indications that Taiwan ``has
been playing a positive role in the international community, a fact
which merits recognition by the United Nations.''
	   China responded in a letter to the U.N chief Tuesday that
condemned the countries for trying to split China's sovereignty. It
called on them ``to stop immediately their illegal activities of
interfering in China's internal affairs and obstructing China's
peaceful reunification.''
	   ``We have never done anything to hurt the interests of Nicaragua
and the other countries,'' said the letter, from Ambassador Qin
Huasun. ``However, what they have done has seriously hurt the
fundamental interests of China and the feelings of the 1.2 billion
Chinese people.''

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The United Nations may have to withdraw
its workers from Afghanistan because of restrictions imposed by the
Taliban leadership, the U.N. envoy to the country said Tuesday.
	   A meeting Friday of representatives from Afghanistan's six
neighbors _ Iran, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Pakistan
and China _ as well as the United States and Russia would take up
the situation, said Lakhdar Brahimi, the U.N. chief's special envoy
for Afghanistan.
	   It wasn't known if any change on the U.N. role would come from
the meeting.
	   But relations have deteriorated steadily between the United
Nations and the Taliban, which has imposed a strict version of
Islamic rule in the 85 percent of the country it controls. The
Taliban wants Afghanistan's seat at the United Nations, which is
currently held by ousted president Burhanuddin Rabbani, the leader
of the anti-Taliban alliance.
	   Most recently, the Taliban forced international aid workers in
Kabul to relocate to abandoned dormitories for what the authorities
said were security precautions.
	   ``They don't seem to be taking any decision that is right
concerning the work of the humanitarian community in Afghanistan,''
Brahimi said after briefing the Security Council on the situation.
	   The council responded with a statement that expressed its
concern about reports of harassment of humanitarian groups,
deplored the breakdown of talks and the fact that both sides in the
conflict have been receiving arms and money from neighboring
countries.
	   The statement did not single out any countries. But it is widely
believed that the strongly Islamic Taliban is receiving aid from
Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. Russia, Central Asian countries and Iran
are thought to be helping the northern-based alliance battling the
Taliban.
	   The council expressed grave concern at the fighting, which has
escalated in recent days as the Taliban took control of the key
northern province of Faryab but were stopped before reaching the
neighboring Jozjan province and the headquarters of opposition
leader Rashid Dostum.
	   The opposition alliance is trying to stop the Taliban from
consolidating its hold over the entire country.
	   Brahimi briefed the council on ``this new flareup of fighting
that is taking place, which very sadly confirmed our worst fears,''
that the arms buildup was escalating.
	   He said the Taliban had been told that they were violating the
terms of an understanding on humanitarian issues reached in May by
making unacceptable restrictions for aid workers to operate,
particularly in the capital, Kabul.
	   ``If these conditions are not acceptable, my opinion is that we
will have to tell the Taliban `You have signed an agreement, you
implement it, or let us go and work somewhere else.'''
	   When asked if the United Nations was at the point of giving the
Taliban one last chance, Brahimi said the Taliban must know there
is a limit to what the United Nations will tolerate. ``There are
growing pressures on us _ in part from the donor community _ to say
there is a limit to what you can stand.''
	   The United Nations has about 60 international workers in
Afghanistan, including representatives from the World Food Program,
UNICEF, the World Health Organization and the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees.

 &UR; Eds: Contains items on MTV Video Music Awards; New York cabs; Frank
Sinatra; Woody Guthrie and Billy Bragg; and Rene Russo

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Madonna got nine nominations Tuesday for MTV
Video Music Awards, followed by the pop band Garbage with eight.
	   The maternal one's ``Ray of Light'' received eight nominations,
including one for best video of the year. Her ``Frozen'' got one
for special effects.
	   All of Garbage's nominations were for ``Push It,'' including a
chance to compete in the group video, alternative and direction
categories.
	   The Cherry Poppin' Daddies, Chumbawamba, Natalie Imbruglia and
Mase were nominated for new artist.
	   Will Smith had six nominations, including video of the year and
viewer's choice for ``Gettin' Jiggy Wit It.''
	   The awards show will be broadcast Sept. 10 from the Universal
Amphitheatre.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Like it or not, New York cabs come with
celebrities. And, like it or not, they keep telling you, and
telling you AND telling you to buckle up.
	   But say goodbye to the recorded voices of Judd Hirsch, Joan
Rivers and Placido Domingo. This summer, New York's 12,187 talking
taxis are switching gears to new celebs, such as Adam West, famous
for playing ``Batman'' in the 1960s TV series and Cindy Adams, a
gossip columnist.
	   In this flavor-of-the day city, ``we move the old voices out,
and we move the new ones in,'' says Allan Fromberg of the Taxi and
Limousine Commission, which is replacing the ones first installed a
year ago.
	   After listening to Eartha Kitt purring into his ear over and
over again, cabbie Shafiqul Ahmed is about to install West's
soothing, deep voice, saying, ``There's no Bat gadget better than a
seatbelt for safety.''
	   Ahmed isn't exactly thrilled with having a new cabmate. Even if
it's Batman, ``it's baloney. All day long, same old thing.''
	   Plus, he adds, ``I have no idea who Adam West is. And now, I
have to deal with two things _ him and the traffic.''
	   The voice messages have interested officials in Australia, New
Zealand, Alaska and California who have contacted the TLC.
	   The agency plans to keep changing the voices about ever six
months, ``to keep things fresh,'' says TLC Chairwoman Diane
McGrath-McKechnie.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   HOBOKEN, New Jersey (AP) _ Frank Sinatra's hometown passed over
a beloved teacher who was shot to death outside his school when it
came time to dedicate a waterfront park.
	   The city decided to name the park after Sinatra, instead of John
Sacci, after Sacci's widow, Kathleen, filed a notice of claim
indicating she intended to seek workers' compensation benefits
because he was killed on the job.
	   Mayor Anthony Russo said he couldn't name the park after the
Hoboken High School teacher because Mrs. Sacci was threatening to
take taxpayers' money.
	   Russo ``is just using Frank Sinatra's name to get back at this
whole issue here,'' Mrs. Sacci said. ``I think it's a disgrace to
Frank Sinatra, as well.''
	   Sacci was killed by a man who falsely believed the teacher was
having an affair with his wife.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) _ Woody Guthrie has been dead and buried 31
years, but he's got an album of new songs out.
	   ``Mermaid Avenue'' is a collection of Guthrie lyrics set to
music and recorded by British folk musician Billy Bragg.
	   The songs include recollections of Guthrie's childhood in
Okemah, a ditty about actress Ingrid Bergman and his thoughts about
songwriter Hanns Eisler's brush with the House Committee on
Un-American Activities.
	   Bragg, who performs tonight in a warmup to this weekend's Woody
Guthrie Free Folk Arts Festival, said the singer's daughter, Nora,
asked him last year to complete ``a very considerable number of
songs'' that Guthrie wrote but never set to music.
	   The lyrics are part of the collection at the Woody Guthrie
Foundation in New York City.
	   ``Mermaid Avenue'' was named after the street in Brooklyn where
Guthrie and his family lived just after World War II.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Rene Russo is a beautiful, successful actress
with a loving husband and daughter and a reputation as one of the
more likeable people in moviemaking.
	   But her road to happiness was a long, uphill climb from an
impoverished, insecure childhood marked by illness and abandonment,
she says in the August issue of Redbook magazine.
	   ``I've probably had more depressing days than happy ones,'' the
co-star of ``Lethal Weapon 4'' said. ``I'm fortunate for what I
have, but I've struggled through life.''
	   Russo's father, Nino Russo, walked out on the family when she
was 2, and her mother worked two jobs to support two daughters.
Russo was obliged to wear a body cast for curvature of the spine
from the age of 10 to 14.
	   A self-professed ``geek,'' she finally dropped out of high
school and went to work in an eyeglass factory. At 17, she was
leaving a rock concert when she was discovered by the agent who
started her modeling career.
	   Still, her personal life _ including a brief first marriage _
was unhappy until she met husband Dan Gilroy, a screenwriter.

Hincapie looks for two seconds
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous; will be updated with day's stage about 1600

 &UR; By SALVATORE ZANCA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LORIENT, France (AP) - Two seconds is quite a lot for George
Hincapie.
	   The American cycling champion from Charlotte, North Carolina is
just that far from the yellow jersey in the Tour de France.
	   He trailed Dane Bo Hamburger in the overall standings after
Tuesday's third stage.
	   Both were in hunt as a small group of riders broke away to gain
an advantage over the main group and set up a contest for the
yellow jersey.
	   Hincapie, who is a member of the U.S. Postal team, was third on
the day. But he participated in the breakaway and got a second in
one of the bonus sprints. However Hamburger got two wins and a
third and gained 14 seconds compared to Hincapie's four to take the
overall lead from him.
	   For the stage victory, German Jens Heppner held off Xavier Jan
of France in a final sprint of the 169-kilometer (105-mile) leg
south through Brittany from Roscoff to Lorient on the west coast of
France.
	   Hincapie was upset over the French and German non-participation
on the holiday.
	   If Hincapie would have won the stage, he would have gotten 20
bonus seconds, enough to put him first.
	   However he tired at the end.
	   ``I cramped with about 10 kilometers to go. I floated in the
back until my legs came back,'' he said.
	   ``The FDJ guy (Jan) and Telekom guy (Heppner)were sitting up all
day,'' Hincapie said, meaning they were not pushing hard during the
fast pace.
	   ``With a sprint like that at the end it is different because
everyone is so wasted except for those two other guys,'' Hincapie
said.
	   That gave Hamburger the chance to get close enough to take the
overall lead.
	   The Tour de France tried to settle down after three hectic days
and one hectic night in Ireland.
	   Britain's Chris Boardman won the prologue and held the leader's
yellow jersey for a day before crashing out in Monday's stage to
Cork.
	   The Tour is also beset with the controversy involving the
top-ranked French team Festina after a Belgian member of its staff
changed his story.
	   According to judicial sources, after first admitting the drugs
were for his personal use, the man charged said that he was under
orders.
	   The masseur remained jailed after having been arrested last week
near the French-Belgian border in possesion of
performance-enhancing drugs.
	   Late Tuesday the Festina team issued a statement saying they
were astonished at recent press stories saying the man charged has
changed his version of things.
	   Festina officials denied those accusations and said that they
had hired two lawyers to protect their image and riders.

Group, lawmaker urge boycott of Pueblo supermarkets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHARLOTTE AMALIE, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) _ Consumer advocates
are urging a boycott of one of the Caribbean's largest supermarket
chains, claiming its prices in the Virgin Islands are higher than
in neighboring Puerto Rico.
	   Virgin Islands Sen. Alison Petrus on Tuesday led a protest by
the Concerned Consumers for Better Food Prices outside a Pueblo
supermarket in Charlotte Amalie. The group urged customers to join
a boycott that begins Wednesday.
	   Virgin Islands Sen. Alison Petrus, who led the protest, cited a
survey by the territory's consumer affairs department showing more
than 6,000 items are higher than in Puerto Rico, about 40 miles (64
kilometers) away.
	   The agency noted the price differences were within legal limits.
	   ``We are being treated differently from the consumers of Puerto
Rico,'' Petrus said Tuesday. ``The prices that they pay for items
are better and there's no justified reason for that.''
	   The group's organizers said they would begin handing out flyers
to customers listing other local supermarkets. They also complained
that Puerto Rican stores are in better condition.
	   Pueblo has 44 stores in Puerto Rico and four in the Virgin
Islands.
	   Virgin Islands Gov. Roy Schneider met with William Keon III,
president and chief executive officer of Pueblo Xtra International,
on Monday to discuss the complaints.
	   Keon said prices were recently raised to balance rising
overhead, but he pledged to cut costs and improve the stores.
	   ``We are going to pay more attention to the details,'' Keon
said. ``We are going to do things better to reduce costs. We have
to do things better.''

Former presidential candidate says he is political prisoner
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) _ In the first comments since his
December arrest, an imprisoned former Paraguayan presidential
candidate reiterated that he is a political prisoner.
	   In comments Tuesday to a local radio station, former Gen. Lino
Oviedo, said, ``I am a political prisoner because I confronted
Paraguay's economic and political oligarchy. My imprisonment was
simply a reaction by the powerful.''
	   After winning the governing Colorado party's primary elections
last year, Oviedo was jailed and later sentenced by a military
tribunal to 10 years in prison.
	   The retired general was found guilty of insubordination after he
refused an order by President Juan Carlos Wasmosy to resign as the
army's chief of staff. Oviedo eventually gave up following a
27-hour standoff.
	   His sentencing several months before the country was to elect a
president complicated the lead up to the elections, which were
later won by Raul Cubas, originally Oviedo's vice-presidential
candidate.
	   In his remarks from jail, Oviedo called Wasmosy ``the most
corrupt president in Paraguayan history'' although he offered no
specifics to support the allegation.
	   Cubas, who takes office August 15, has said one of his first
acts as president will be to re-examine Oviedo's case.

Colombian delegates wrap up talks with rebels in Germany
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs. To be led after news conference scheduled for 1300
GMT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MAINZ, Germany (AP) _ Colombian civic leaders hope they can
bring an end to 34 years of civil war as they wrap up four days of
talks with Colombia's second-largest rebel group.
	   The Colombian delegates and rebel representatives have been
sequestered since Sunday in a cloister in the southern state of
Bavaria for secretive meetings aimed at arranging direct peace
talks with President-elect Andres Pastrana.
	   The participants, including Colombian business and labor
leaders, were scheduled to hold a news conference Wednesday in
Mainz, just southwest of Frankfurt, to discuss what was
accomplished.
	   Talks with the 5,000-member National Liberation Army, known by
its Spanish initials ELN, and Pastrana's parallel overtures toward
Colombia's largest rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, or FARC, have raised hopes of an end to Colombia civil
war.
	   Nobel prize-winning Colombian author Gabriel Garcia Marquez, who
declined an invitation to help mediate the Germany talks because of
medical reasons, sent a supportive message to participants Tuesday.
	   ``Everything depends on what happens'' in Germany, Garcia
Marquez said in his letter. ``We are in your hands.''
	   Pastrana, who takes office Aug. 7, was traveling this week in
France. Colombia's El Espectador newspaper reported he may seek to
meet with the ELN in Europe after talks wind up in Germany.
	   In Mainz, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's chief aide for security and
intelligence, Bernd Schmidbauer, met Tuesday with Colombian
Environment Minister Eduardo Verano. Colombian ministry sources,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said those talks dealt with how
to stop the ELN rebels from bombing Colombian oil pipelines.
	   The ELN often targets pipelines and kidnaps oil industry
executives in its campaign to end what it calls foreign
exploitation of Colombia's natural resources.
	   The Colombian civic delegation spent four days with ELN
representatives at the Himmelspforten cloister in the town of
Wuerzburg, on the Main River. Germany's Roman Catholic bishops use
the Himmelspforten _ or ``Heaven's Gates'' _ as a retreat for key
decision-making.
	   The Catholic Bishops' Conference, which helped coordinate the
meetings, insisted the talks remain as closed as possible and
turned away journalists at the cloister's walled compound.

Kosovo guerrillas seek support in provincial capital
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; By ADAM BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ After gains in the rugged
countryside, Kosovo's ethnic Albanian guerrillas are now recruiting
youth in the provincial capital with cryptic phone calls and
whispers in sidewalk cafes.
	   ``You know who we are. We will need you soon,'' a recent high
school graduate quoted an anonymous caller as saying.
	   Another young ethnic Albanian said callers asked him what he
could contribute to the struggle between the Kosovo Liberation Army
and the Serb-led government.
	   ``They called a lot of people in my neighborhood,'' he said.
	   Both spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing arrest or
harassment by Serb authorities.
	   On the surface, this provincial capital of concrete apartment
blocks, coffee bars and flirting teen-agers appears far removed
from the conflict between KLA guerrillas and Serb forces, even
though some of the fighting is as close as five miles away.
	   Except for a July 3 bombing in a Serb neighborhood that caused
no injuries _ which police blamed on the KLA _ the city has been
spared from the violence.
	   But some young Albanians say the KLA is trying to build an
underground network in the capital _ their ultimate target in the
battle for independence from Serbia, the dominant of two republics
that make up the remainder of Yugoslavia.
	   The United States and the other five nations that coordinate
international policy in the Balkans support significant autonomy
but not independence for Kosovo. The so-called Contact Group has
called for an immediate cease-fire between the Serbs and the ethnic
Albanians.
	   It is impossible to determine how many young Albanians have been
approached by the KLA, or how many have joined the urban
underground.
	   There are no known incidents of retribution against those who
received a call from the KLA but did not commit themselves. How
long that relative tolerance would last was unclear.
	   A Serb crackdown on Albanian militants that began in February
has caused hundreds of deaths and a surge in support for the
militants among ethnic Albanians, who outnumber Serbs in Kosovo
9-to-1.
	   Reflecting that support, the Albanian-language Koha Ditore
newspaper reported Tuesday that 2,000 people attended a swearing-in
ceremony for new KLA members in Malisevo, 25 miles south of
Pristina.
	   The recruits, whose numbers were not reported, took an oath to
``fight for the liberation of occupied territories of Albania and
their unification ... regardless of the danger to my life.''
	   Despite the KLA's growing strength, many Pristina residents
doubt the guerrillas can threaten the capital without a clandestine
network among the city's 200,000 residents.
	   ``There will never be KLA soldiers from the countryside marching
on Pristina,'' said Albin Kurti, a nonviolent representative of the
23,000-member Kosovo Albanian students' union. ``The KLA can only
conquer Pristina with people from Pristina.''
	   The city's 12,000 students appear to be the main target of
guerrilla recruiters. Kurti estimates 2,000 students, mostly from
Kosovo's strife-torn west, have joined the KLA since the crackdown
began.
	   In recent weeks, self-styled KLA spokesmen have been boasting of
capturing the capital.
	   ``The day when the KLA will be present in Pristina is not far,''
Jakup Krasniqi was quoted by Koha Ditore as saying.
	   In case the war does come to Pristina, the students' union
recently organized a first-aid course, including how to treat
bullet and land-mine wounds and how to cope psychologically with
death and devastation.
	   A young Albanian doctor, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the guerrillas are closer than many people think.
	   ``I fight with my neighbor because he keeps playing loud
music,'' he said. ``But then it seems ridiculous in this situation.
It's not so loud that I can't hear gunfire.''

OSCE delegation visits Belgrade in effort to resume diplomatic

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ An international organization is
returning to Yugoslavia for the first time in six years as part of
diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis in separatist Kosovo
province, where ethnic Albanians are fighting for independence.
	   A delegation from the 54-nation Organization of Security and
Cooperation in Europe, or OSCE, was to begin discussions Wednesday
in Belgrade with government and opposition representatives.
	   Yugoslavia was suspended from the OSCE and other international
organizations in 1992 for allegedly fomenting ethnic conflict in
Croatia and Bosnia. Belgrade had refused to allow an OSCE mission
into the country until its membership was restored.
	   Under international pressure, the Yugoslavs agreed last Thursday
to let an initial fact-finding mission visit the country, including
Serbia's Kosovo province, where clashes between Serb and Albanian
forces have killed more than 200 people and forced thousands of
others to flee their homes.
	   The 12-member delegation, led by Hansjoerg Eiff, Germany's
ambassador to the OSCE, will travel Friday to Kosovo's provincial
capital, Pristina, to meet with ethnic Albanian leaders and local
Serb authorities. The delegation continues Sunday to Montenegro,
which together with Serbia makes up Yugoslavia.
	   The mission will test Belgrade's readiness to permit a permanent
OSCE mission into and to talk about Yugoslavia's suspended
membership, independent Radio B92 said Tuesday.
	   The OSCE mission comes ahead of a potentially volatile period in
Kosovo, with the leadership of the Democratic League of Kosovo, the
main ethnic Albanian party, announcing that the first constituent
session of the self-styled Kosovo parliament would convene within a
week.
	   The Serbian government does not recognize elections that chose
the parliament or made Ibrahim Rugova the president of Kosovo's
Albanians, who make 90 percent of Kosovo's population.
	   The militant Kosovo Liberation Army, reportedly in control of
about 40 percent of Kosovo, has refused to heed any of the Albanian
political parties and are unlikely to recognize the authority of
either parliament or Rugova.

	   ANDREWS, North Carolina (AP) _ The manhunt intensified again for
abortion clinic bombing suspect Eric Rudolph after authorities said
he took a truck and a six-month supply of food from a home last
week.
	   Rudolph, on the run nearly six months following the Alabama
bombing, was seen Thursday by the man officials say he robbed. He
disappeared after ditching the truck at a campground that leads
into the mountains and areas honeycombed with caves, according to
authorities.
	   Police said Rudolph stole the truck and the food from the man,
who operates a health food store.
	   However ABC News reported Tuesday the man Rudolph took the food
from was a friend. And the network, citing FBI sources, said
Rudolph left him money to pay for the supplies.
	   Rudolph's friend waited 24 hours before calling the sheriff,
according ABC, and Rudolph reportedly told this man that he has a
great hiding place.
	   NBC News also reported that Rudolph left money for the food and
a list of items he wanted but didn't get.
	   Calls to authorities by The Associated Press seeking comment on
the reports weren't immediately returned Tuesday night.
	   The area where Rudolph disappeared is at the southern tip of the
Appalachians.
	   Members of the Southeast Bombing Task Force converged on this
area near the tip of western North Carolina with bloodhounds and
extra manpower.
	   Rudolph, a 31-year-old outdoorsman and carpenter, is charged in
the Jan. 29 bombing of the New Woman All Women clinic, which killed
an off-duty police officer and seriously wounded a nurse in
Birmingham, Alabama. He also is wanted for questioning three
bombings in Georgia, including the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Park
bombing.
	   The FBI placed Rudolph on its 10 most wanted list on May 6 and
increased the reward to dlrs 1 million for anyone with information
leading to his arrest and conviction.
	   Since he was named a suspect in the clinic bombing, Rudolph has
evaded a nationwide search. The reward for information leading to
his capture has grown to dlrs 1 million.
	   Federal agents also want to question him about similar bombings
in Atlanta, including the bombing at Centennial Olympic Park in
July 1996 that killed one and injured more than 100. The other
attacks in Atlanta were at an abortion clinic in January 1997 and
at a gay nightclub in February 1997.

 &UR; ST. KITTS AND NEVIS: Nevis to vote on whether to secede &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BASSETERRE, St. Kitts and Nevis (AP) _ Residents of the
Caribbean island of Nevis will vote Aug. 10 on whether to break
with nearby St. Kitts and become a new country, the island's
premier announced Tuesday.
	   Premier Vance Amory made the announcement during a special
meeting of the Nevis Island Assembly Tuesday morning. He called the
referendum ``a glorious day'' for the island's 10,000 inhabitants.
	   The island's five lawmakers voted in October to secede, but the
move requires a two-thirds vote by the island's 6,000 registered
voters.
	   Nevisians have long complained that their 37-square-mile island,
an upmarket tourist destination and haven for offshore banks, is
neglected by the government in St. Kitts, population 33,000.
	   The island contributes 38 percent of the federation's tax
revenue but only receives 21 percent of government spending, Amory
claimed.
	   In a nonbinding vote in 1974, about 80 percent of Nevis
residents voted to become a separate state.
 &UR; UNITED STATES: Anti-Castro group leader subpoenaed in Cuban
smuggling case
	   MIAMI (AP) _ The leader of a group that flies the Florida
Straits in search of fleeing Cubans charged Tuesday that a federal
subpoena looking into Cuban smuggling missions amounts to
government intimidation.
	   Jose Basulto, leader of Brothers to the Rescue, said he will
appear before the grand jury Wednesday but denies any connection by
him or his anti-Castro group to any smuggling operations.
	   ``We have had nothing to do with the smuggling of Cubans or any
other nationals into the United States, recently or before and any
time in the history of Brothers to the Rescue,'' Basulto said.
	   Wilfredo Fernandez, spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in
Miami, said he could not comment on any grand jury activities.
 &UR; UNITED STATES: U.S. Sugar pays dlrs 5.7 million to settle lawsuits
	   CLEWISTON, Florida (AP) _ U.S. Sugar Corp. has agreed to pay
dlrs 5.7 million to cane harvesters to settle its portion of two
lawsuits accusing local growers of shortchanging nearly 20,000
Caribbean workers.
	   The class-action lawsuits were filed in 1989 and 1993 by former
cutters for U.S. Sugar, the Florida Sugar Cane Growers Cooperative
and Atlantic Sugar Association, a co-op controlled by the Fanjul
family of Palm Beach.
	   The settlement announced Monday covers only the claims against
U.S. Sugar. The cooperative and the Fanjuls vowed to continue to
fight the allegations they underpaid the workers.
	   ``It's been a long time coming,'' said David Gorman, a North
Palm Beach attorney for the workers, primarily Jamaicans who came
to South Florida for seasonal jobs cutting cane.
	   The workers each will receive between dlrs 100 and dlrs 300,
depending on how long they worked.
 &UR; CUBA: Jamaican minister in Cuba
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Deputy Jamaican Prime Minister Seymour
Mullings arrived in Cuba Monday for a four-day visit he billed as
an effort to help seek the ``de-isolation'' the communist-ruled
island.
	   Mullings was expected to meet President Fidel Castro and other
senior Cuban officials, including Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina
and Trade Minister Ricardo Cabrisas.
	   Mullings said he wasn't concerned that Jamaica, in seeking
Cuba's ``de-isolation'' in the Caribbean, could strain relations
with the United States.
	   ``We believe that within the U.S. administration there is a
strong feeling that more dialogue should take place and that the
(U.S.) economic embargo has not worked,'' Mullings said.
	   ``I think the Caribbean countries owe it to themselves to do
whatever is possible to ensure there is more dialogue between
Americans and Cubans,'' he added. ``There are many (U.S.)
congressmen who feel strongly that the U.S. ought to put an end to
the embargo.''
 &UR; UNITED STATES: Man in custody in four St. Martin rapes
	   MIAMI (AP) _ A man who served time for rapes on the Dutch side
of the Caribbean island of St. Martin faces extradition to face
four armed rape charges on the French side.
	   Franklin Benjamin Brooks, 35, was ordered held without bond at
an initial court appearance Tuesday, following his arrest Monday in
Miami.
	   DNA samples from two rape victims matched a blood sample from
Brooks provided by Dutch authorities, according to an arrest
complaint filed by federal prosecutors.
	   All four rapes ``were extremely similar,'' and the victims'
descriptions of their attacker all match Brooks.
	   Brooks also faces three robbery charges.
	   In court, Brooks said he did not have money to hire an attorney,
and U.S. Magistrate Judge Linnea Johnson ordered the U.S. public
defender's office to represent him.
	   A magistrate in Basse-Terre, Guadaloupe, which has jurisdiction
over the French side of St. Martin, issued an arrest warrant for
Brooks on June 29.
 &UR; UNITED STATES: Coast Guard picks up 22 Haitians off Miami
	   MIAMI (AP) _ A group of 22 Haitians was picked up after their
38-foot cabin cruiser was spotted by a Coast Guard helicopter crew
three miles off Miami.
	   The 18 men and four women aboard were transferred to the Coast
Guard cutter Point Martin, an 82-foot patrol boat based out of Fort
Pierce, and were to be returned to the Bahamas Wednesday.
	   The Haitians, who were spotted Monday afternoon, were in
satisfactory health, Coast Guard officials said.
	   The skipper of the cabin cruiser was detained by the U.S. Border
Patrol, and an investigation was under way, authorities said.
 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Pro-commonwealth party will boycott plebiscite
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ A leading opponent of Puerto Rico becoming the
51st U.S. state warned Tuesday that his party would boycott a
binding plebiscite Congress is considering to determine the
Caribbean island's future.
	   Anibal Acevedo Vila, president of the Popular Democratic Party,
said legislation on the plebiscite passed by the House but not the
Senate represented statehood bills disguised as self-determination.
	   ``Under the terms of these bills,'' Acevedo Vila told the Senate
Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, ``we cannot participate
in a plebiscite and will be forced into a court action to protect
the voting rights of the Puerto Rican people.''
	   William Miranda Marin, chairman of Puerto Rico's Democratic
Party, said the plebiscite legislation was ``fatally flawed'' and
would produce a ``sham (vote) devoid of meaning.'' He said his
party also would stay away from the polls if the legislation was
approved.
 &UR; JAMAICA: Police ask for charges against dozens of officers
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Jamaica's police department has asked
prosecutors to file charges against 39 officers during the last two
months for crimes ranging from drug smuggling to jailbreaks.
	   About 22 cases were submitted to the Director of Public
Prosecutions in June, and 17 were filed in July, said Lester
Howell, superintendent of the police department's Office of
Professional Responsibility.
	   He said Monday that most of the investigations stemmed from
complaints by citizens.
 &UR; U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS: Group, lawmaker urge supermarket boycott
	   CHARLOTTE AMALIE, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) _ Consumer advocates
are urging a boycott of one of the Caribbean's largest supermarket
chains, claiming its prices in the Virgin Islands are higher than
in neighboring Puerto Rico.
	   Virgin Islands Sen. Alison Petrus on Tuesday led a protest by
the Concerned Consumers for Better Food Prices outside a Pueblo
supermarket in Charlotte Amalie. The group urged customers to join
a boycott that begins Wednesday.
	   Virgin Islands Sen. Alison Petrus, who led the protest, cited a
survey by the territory's consumer affairs department showing more
than 6,000 items are higher than in Puerto Rico, about 40 miles (64
kilometers) away.
	   The agency noted the price differences were within legal limits.
	   ``We are being treated differently from the consumers of Puerto
Rico,'' Petrus said Tuesday. ``The prices that they pay for items
are better and there's no justified reason for that.''

 &UR; DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: Dominican congress approves extradition
legislation
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ The Dominican Congress
on Tuesday approved legislation, long sought by Washington,
allowing Dominican nationals to be extradited to the United States
and other countries.
	   President Leonel Fernandez was expected to sign the measure into
law within two weeks.
	   The Dominican Republic is a major transshipment point for drug
smugglers headed from South America to the U.S. mainland, and
hundreds of Dominicans are wanted for trial in U.S. courts on
various charges.
	   The Clinton administration has requested the extradition of 30
suspects in this Caribbean nation, while New York City police say
they want some 400 Dominican nationals for assorted crimes.
	   Crimes covered by Tuesday's measure include drug trafficking,
money laundering, murder, kidnapping and armed robbery.
	   While a 1910 treaty permitted extraditions to the United States,
a 1969 law prohibited Dominicans from being turned over to other
nations. Tuesday's legislation supersedes the 1969 law.

Orangemen settle in for long siege at Drumcree
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: recaps pvs &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT BARR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PORTADOWN, Northern Ireland (AP) _ The parades are over,
violence has ebbed, crowds near the Drumcree Anglican church have
thinned and the men of the Orange Order settled in for what may be
a long siege to demand their right to march through a Catholic
neighborhood.
	   ``Anybody who thinks that we are beaten and it's over is totally
misreading the situation. We are still going to be here,'' said
David Jones, spokesman for the Portadown Orange Lodges. ``We are
reviewing all the time where the protest action should go.''
	   Barbed wire, trenches, police and soldiers on Wednesday for the
11th day blocked the men of Northern Ireland's largest Protestant
fraternal order from marching through a hostile Catholic
neighborhood in Portadown. They are enforcing a decision by the
Parades Commission, created after trouble at Drumcree the past two
summers, to forbid the march.
	   Two years ago, police and soldiers stopped the march for four
days, but gave up in the face of violence across Northern Ireland
by Protestant hard-liners. Last year, police simply forced the
march through Catholic protesters.
	   But this year, authorities held firm against widespread
violence, which reached its depth Sunday with a firebombing that
killed three young sons of a Catholic woman.
	   Down on the Garvaghy Road, the object of all the aggravation,
residents are feeling more confident.
	   ``People are certainly more relaxed, and think, well, the
parade's not coming down,'' said Dara O'Hagan, a Sinn Fein activist
elected to Northern Ireland's new Assembly last month.
	   ``I think the Portadown district needs to get real and come into
the real world. I think the fact that they're still continuing the
protest in the circumstances is nothing short of obscene,'' she
said.
	   Some influential Orangemen wanted to end the standoff after the
deaths of Richard, Mark and Jason Quinn, who were buried Tuesday.
But the Portadown lodges reject any responsibility for the wave of
violence and say they are in a fight for their right to walk freely
in their land.
	   More than 20,000 Orangemen and supporters massed in the pasture
near the Drumcree Anglican church on Thursday, when five police
officers were injured by bombs and ball bearings fired from the
crowd. Numbers have since dwindled to a few thousand each night.
	   Portadown Orangemen have not said how they plan to maintain
their protest.
	   ``I think the Portadown protest has had their massive numbers,
and now I think it's got to take on a different level,'' said Joel
Patton, leader of the hard-line Spirit of Drumcree group within the
Orange Order.
	   He suggested that pressure should be applied to Protestants
elected to the Assembly. ``Are they prepared to work in the
Assembly while their own people are being trapped in Portadown?''
Patton said.
	   But in another sign of discord in the Order, several Orange
gatherings adopted resolutions Monday saying they wanted the
Assembly to work. Its first minister, David Trimble, is an
Orangeman, though he is now reviled by many of his brethren for
striking an agreement to share power with Catholics, including
politicians associated with the Irish Republican Army.
	   Monday was the emotional peak of the Protestant celebrations,
with hundreds of marches celebrating the victory of the Protestant
King William over the Catholic King James II at the Battle of the
Boyne in 1690.
	   At one Orange gathering Monday, Patton shouted ``traitor'' at
the Armagh County chaplain, the Rev. William Bingham, who had
called for an end to the Drumcree protest because the march was not
worth the lives of three boys.
	   Senior Orange chaplains issued a statement backing Bingham and
condemning recent violence. ``Our bitter shame at all this,
allegedly carried out in the name of Protestantism, is not in any
way lessened by the fact that many of our own people are the
victims of terrorism,'' the statement said.

	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ A former junta leader detained on
allegations of kidnapping children during Argentina's ``dirty war''
was indicted Tuesday, court officials said.
	   Jorge Rafael Videla, a member of the junta that seized power in
a 1976 coup, has been held since late June while a judge questioned
him on accusations of child abduction and forgery of identity
documents.
	   Videla, 72, is being prosecuted in connection with five cases,
including those of two children given to a former military doctor.
	   He will remain in jail until the start of his court case,
Federal Judge Roberto Marquevich ruled Tuesday. The judge also said
a lien equivalent to dlrs 5 million had been placed against
Videla's assets in the event of any damage awards.
	   The children's parents were among those who disappeared during
Argentina's ``dirty war,'' when thousands of political opponents,
mainly leftists, were tortured and killed by death squads.
	   Argentina says 9,000 people disappeared between 1976 and 1983
and are presumed dead, but human rights groups put the number
closer to 30,000.

	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Venezuela delayed the sale its huge
state-owned aluminum company for a second time Tuesday at a request
by bidders.
	   The state privatization office postponed the sale of the (dlrs)
1.55 billion Venezuelan Aluminum Corporation, scheduled for
Wednesday, until July 23. Britain's Billiton PLC and U.S.-based
Kaiser Aluminum Co. said they wanted more time to work out details
of their partnerships.
	   The privatization was first scheduled for March 25 but was
postponed when all the bidders withdrew because of concerns over
the terms of the sale.
	   The Venezuela Aluminum Company is one of the largest aluminum
companies in Latin America and accounts for 4 percent of world
production.
	   Like many Latin American countries, Venezuela has been selling
off major state-owned enterprises to raise funds, but has met with
resistance from labor groups who say the privatizations lead to
widespread lay-offs.

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Sixty three inmates escaped from
prison after digging a 10-foot-long (3 meter) tunnel in Aracaju,
1,230 miles (1,985 kms) northeast of Rio, in a northeastern state,
police said Tuesday.
	   ``There is a fear for public safety because many of these men
were serving long sentences for crimes including murder, rape and
armed robbery,'' Sergipe state police detective Flavio Albuquerque
said by telephone. Only eight inmates were recaptured so far.
	   The break-out occurred during the World Cup final between Brazil
and France on Sunday, but details of the escape only started to
emerge Monday.
	   It was unclear what equipment was used to dig the tunnel, which
led from a bathroom inside the prison to just outside the wall. The
tunnel was 3 feet (1 meter) underground.
	   Albuquerque did not know how many people were incarcerated at
the facility.
	   Officials responsible for the prison were unavailable for
comment Tuesday.

	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ In a speech Tuesday to more than 500
businessmen and politicians in South America's biggest city, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan underscored the importance of an open
global economy as a way to ``spread the benefits of
globalization.''
	   ``One of the biggest challenges we face today is to secure an
open international economy,'' Annan said. ``Our choice today is
between spreading the benefits of globalization or reserving them
for just a few.''
	   Before arriving in Sao Paulo, Annan visited the capital
Brasilia, where he witnessed the signing of the newly ratified
Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and the Treaty on the
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.
	   Annan was scheduled to visit Sao Paulo's acting Governor Geraldo
Alckmin before traveling to Uruguay.
	   He is also scheduled to visit Argentina, Guatemala and Mexico.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The United Nations may have to withdraw
its workers from Afghanistan because of restrictions imposed by the
ruling Taliban leadership, the U.N. envoy to the country said.
	   Lakhdar Brahimi, the U.N. chief's special envoy for Afghanistan,
said Tuesday that the Taliban are violating the terms of a May
agreement by placing unacceptable restrictions on aid workers,
particularly in the capital, Kabul.
	   He said a major problem came when the Taliban forced
international aid workers in Kabul to relocate to abandoned
dormitories for what the authorities said were security
precautions.
	   When asked if the United Nations was at the point of giving the
Taliban one last chance, Brahimi said the Taliban must know there
is a limit to what the United Nations will tolerate. ``There are
growing pressures on us _ in part from the donor community _ to say
there is a limit to what you can stand.''
	   Relations have been deteriorating steadily between the United
Nations and the Taliban, which has imposed a strict version of
Islamic rule in the 85 percent of the country it controls.
	   The Taliban has forced girls out of schools and women out of
jobs. Health care for women is limited. All Muslim women _
including foreigners _ can go out in public only under the escort
of a close male relative.
	   The United Nations has about 60 international workers in
Afghanistan, including representatives from the World Food Program,
UNICEF, the World Health Organization and the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees.
	   The Taliban wants Afghanistan's seat at the United Nations,
which is currently held by former president Burhanuddin Rabbani,
the leader of an alliance fighting to oust the Taliban from power.
	   The council also expressed grave concern at the fighting, which
has escalated in recent days as the Taliban took control of the key
northern province of Faryab. The religious army was stopped before
reaching the neighboring Jozjan province and the headquarters of
opposition leader Rashid Dostum.
	   A meeting Friday of representatives from Afghanistan's six
neighbors _ Iran, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Pakistan
and China _ as well as the United States and Russia would discuss
the situation, Brahimi said.

Syria's Assad will seek alternative to U.S. mediation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANTHONY SHADID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ In a rare visit abroad, Syrian President
Hafez Assad travels to France this week, again seeking an
alternative to American mediation in negotiations with Israel that
have gone nowhere for more than two years.
	   Assad has long sought a strategic partnership with another
country that would balance Israel's alliance with the United
States. In France, he finds a willing partner as well as a country
with historic political and cultural ties to the Middle East.
	   Across the Arab world, sentiments are running high for a more
active European diplomacy to break the impasse.
	   ``A French and a European role is badly needed in light of the
incapacitated American stance,'' said the Syrian newspaper Tishrin,
which speaks for the government. It warned that without a
breakthrough, the stalemate will ``bring disasters to the region.''
	   Syria traditionally has been one of the Arab world's more
isolated countries. Its good relations with Iran's Islamic
government have alienated Iraq and Gulf nations while its support
for radical Palestinian groups makes others uncomfortable.
	   But Syria's image has improved in recent months as frustration
mounts over the deadlock in Arab-Israeli negotiations.
	   Some Arab nations have begun listening to Syria's long-standing
call to isolate Israel, both economically and politically. They
have expressed admiration, too, for Assad's refusal to negotiate
with Israel unless it returns the Golan Heights, which Israel
captured in the 1967 Middle East War.
	   For its part, France sees the visit by Assad as another
opportunity to show that it wants to participate in Arab-Israeli
negotiations, either on its own or with the European Union.
	   French diplomacy in the Middle East has occasionally borne fruit
where American policy has not.
	   During Israel's offensive against Hezbollah guerrillas in
southern Lebanon in 1996, France brokered a truce that still
stands. And last month, France guaranteed an exchange of prisoners
and soldiers' remains between Lebanon and Israel.
	   France has made efforts not to anger Syria, particularly in
Lebanon, a country Syria sees as its protectorate. Many analysts
believe that France considers Syria the one country that could
assure the French a place in Middle East diplomacy.
	   ``France needs Syria if it wants to build a new policy toward
the Arabs that is worthwhile,'' said an editorial in al-Wasat, a
leading Arabic-language magazine. ``Syria is the key to Middle East
peace and the bridgehead for any regional stability.''
	   The three-day visit is, in itself, remarkable for the austere,
67-year-old Assad, who has not traveled outside the region since he
met U.S. President Bill Clinton in Geneva in January 1994.
	   He follows the visit to France with two more trips later this
year to Russia and Lebanon _ all signs that Syria's traditional
isolation may be easing.

	   DHARMSALA, India (AP) _ The first time he tried to flee Tibet,
Nhakpa Tsering was caught by Chinese border guards and thrown into
jail for five days. He was 8 years old.
	   He was luckier at age 10. He and 20 other young Tibetans
recently made a 15-day trek through frigid Himalayan passes across
the Nepalese border. They then headed to Dharmsala, the northern
Indian town where the exiled Tibetan leader, the Dalai Lama, has
made his home.
	   ``We were freezing the whole time, but it was worth it because
now I can go to school,'' said Tsering, his cheeks still burnt from
the wind and cold.
	   Hundreds of Tibetan children make the journey every year, sent
by their families to the Dalai Lama's schools to study Tibetan
subjects that are forbidden in the Chinese-run schools in Tibet.
	   China sent a 200,000-man army into Tibet in 1949-52 to assert
its historic claim to the territory. Tibetans say they were
independent for generations.
	   The Dalai Lama, who was the spiritual and political leader of
Tibet, fled during a failed anti-China uprising in 1959. Now more
than 120,000 Tibetans live in exile, and hundreds more arrive every
month.
	   The risks of the journey are daunting. Most refugees come in
winter, when howling winds and fierce cold drive Chinese border
guards inside their barracks. Some refugees don't make it, dying of
exposure or sickness along the way. Others lose fingers and toes to
frostbite. Some are caught and imprisoned.
	   Tsering said his group was forced to hide for two days behind a
giant snow drift while border guards patrolled nearby. Later, he
had to be pulled to safety after he sank up to his neck in snow.
	   In Dharmsala, Tsering and 200 other recently arrived refugees
sat on the ground, their heads reverently bowed and hands folded,
listening to the Dalai Lama welcome them.
	   ``You are the true masters of Tibet,'' he told them. ``You have
faced many problems, but you have maintained strong determination.
People in Tibet have not lost hope.''

Japan's love affair with liquor takes its toll

	   TOKYO (AP) _ In the intricate knot of alleyways behind Tokyo's
Shimbashi train station, businessmen stagger out of dilapidated
bars with names like The Soul of Drunkenness and Oblivion. Neon
casts an eerie light on one man bent double, retching, in the
middle of the street.
	   That Japan likes a drink is clear to any pedestrian out after
dark.
	   But the country's drinking habits may be more serious than
society is willing to admit, if the growing health and economic
costs of its love affair with the bottle are indicators.
	   ``Japan takes an extremely indulgent attitude toward alcohol
abuse,'' says Hideo Hosaki, a professor of medicine at Tokyo's
prestigious Keio University.
	   Amid a worldwide trend of falling alcohol intake, Japan was the
only leading industrialized country to see per capita consumption
steadily rise over the '70s and '80s, the Health and Welfare
Ministry reported in 1992.
	   The ministry hasn't compiled more recent statistics, but figures
from other sources indicate consumption may be stabilizing at the
higher levels.
	   Japan's average alcohol consumption is roughly equal to the
United States at 6.6 liters (1.74 gallons) a year per person,
according to government statistics.
	   But officials say that figure is cause for particular concern in
this country because studies indicate nearly half of all Japanese
lack an enzyme essential to breaking down alcohol in the body and
thus suffer more damage from liquor.
	   The economic impact of alcohol abuse is heavy.
	   Measured in terms of efficiency, medical fees, accidents and
absenteeism, the cost is more than 6 trillion yen (dlrs 60 billion)
a year, the health ministry estimates. About 17 percent of people
hospitalized in Japan suffer from alcohol-related illnesses.
	   Japanese society has long tolerated _ even encouraged _ public
displays of inebriation.
	   Buying a beer is as easy as slipping a coin into one of the
ubiquitous alcohol vending machines clustered in residential areas
across the country.
	   ``Drinking heavily on a daily basis isn't seen as a problem
until it's too late,'' says Tsukasa Mizusawa, a spokesman for ASK,
a citizen awareness group on alcohol abuse.
	   While private clinics and Alcoholics Anonymous are slowly
gaining a foothold, alcoholism usually isn't diagnosed until the
drinker develops severe mental disorders or a life-threatening
disease.
	   ``There are very few doctors with the expertise to treat
alcoholism,'' says Hosaki, the medical professor. ``Most doctors
completely ignore the problems alcoholism can cause in the family
and in society.''
	   The most common treatment for alcohol dependency in Japan is
simply to commit late-term alcoholics to mental institutions.
	   Advocating temperance is almost considered anti-social because
liquor plays a crucial role in forging bonds in Japanese society, a
fact reflected in the way it is consumed.
	   Every April, new company recruits are pressured into performing
what is only half-jokingly described as their first duty as
employees: drinking until they drop at company welcoming parties.
	   After-hours drinking turns Japan's corporate structure
upside-down, providing a rare respite from the rigid rules of
hierarchy. Subordinates are often allowed to openly criticize their
bosses. Loud, outrageous behavior discouraged in sober states is
indulged and sometimes admired if the offender has been drinking.
	   You may never need to fill your own glass. Drinking partners
take turns pouring for each other _ and refusing a refill is often
taken as rude.
	   News and entertainment media, meanwhile, glamorize heavy
drinking and play down its hazards.
	   When the late screen star Shintaro Katsu lit up a cigarette and
downed a beer at a news conference to discuss his throat cancer,
journalists erupted in laughter. The general attitude: What a guy.
	   Months later, Katsu was dead.
	   Ads for liquor flood prime time television _ and frequently
appear to be aimed at women and younger drinkers. Drinking in both
of those groups is rising rapidly. A slew of new beer brands,
including one called First Lady, directly capitalize on the surge
in alcohol consumption among women.
	   The Health and Welfare Ministry's 1992 study of alcohol abuse
found the number of women who consider themselves drinkers surged
from 19.2 percent in the late 1960s to 43.2 percent by the late
'80s. Twelve percent of women ages 30-50 said they consumed alcohol
every day.
	   ``The Japanese love to drink,'' says Hideaki Hattori, an elderly
man who has sold newspapers outside Shimbashi Station the past
three years.
	   It's evident every night around closing time, he says. ``You see
fights all the time.''

Russian bailout package now awaits parliament's verdict
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The fate of Russia's much-needed bailout package
rests in the hands of the State Duma, parliament's lower house.
	   The Duma is scheduled to hold a special session to debate the
package, and passage is far from certain. President Boris Yeltsin
has had a long history of clashes with communists and other
hard-liners who dominate the legislative body.
	   The State Duma turned down several proposals earlier this month,
and communist leaders have not given any indication that their
position has changed.
	   If the Duma turns down Yeltsin's economic plan on Wednesday, the
International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the Japanese
government might withhold the dlrs 17.1 billion in new loans. When
combined with already-negotiated loans, the bailout agreement
totals dlrs 22.6 billion.
	   Trying to avoid confrontation, Yeltsin invited parliament
leaders to the Kremlin on Tuesday for tea and cookies to urge them
_ nicely _ to pass the government's austerity plan.
	   ``We are one team, we are one state, we are the leaders of this
state,'' Yeltsin told the lawmakers. ``We shall not be able to
implement (the program) if you do not confirm it.''
	   One lawmaker said it was the first time Yeltsin was not
confrontational.
	   ``For the first time, the president was in a very peaceful
mood,'' said Nikolai Kharitonov, leader of the Agrarian Party. ``I
have met him many times, but today was the first time tea was
served.''
	   Yeltsin said it was important for parliament to act now.
	   ``Of course, I can decide some matters myself,'' Yeltsin told
the legislators, indicating that he might implement part of the
plan by decree. ``But ... the destiny of the program depends on
you.''
	   News of the loan agreement gave an immediate boost to Russia's
hard-hit stock market, which has lost more than half its value this
year.
	   Stocks shot up 16.8 percent Tuesday, on the heels of a 9 percent
surge on Monday. It was the market's best showing since the crisis
began in May.
	   ``The optimism is all around the place, and people believe that
if Russia gets serious about fixing its problems, it could be
really a great story again,'' said Dmitry Kryukov, a trader at the
MFK Renaissance investment bank in Moscow.
	   Russia's Central Bank said its hard-currency reserves had fallen
to dlrs 13.5 billion Tuesday, from dlrs 15.1 billion earlier this
month. Bank Chairman Sergei Dubinin said he expects reserves to
rise as money begins to arrive from the loan package.
	   The IMF board is to meet in Washington on Monday to review the
loan agreement, and it could send dlrs 5 billion or more to Russia
as soon as next week. The IMF wants Russia to address chronic
problems such as its budget deficit and its inability to collect
taxes, however.
	   Yeltsin's administration has sent more than 20 proposals to
parliament, but communist lawmakers and other opponents have
resisted spending cuts and tax increases. They say the government
should be spending more money, not less, to help struggling Russian
citizens and companies.
	   Millions of Russians have been pushed into poverty by the
country's shrinking economy during the 1990s, and the infusion of
cash is designed to ward off another big downturn.

Kosovo guerrillas seek support in provincial capital
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to add ``Yugoslavia'' in slug &QL; 
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; By ADAM BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ After gains in the rugged
countryside, Kosovo's ethnic Albanian guerrillas are now recruiting
youth in the provincial capital with cryptic phone calls and
whispers in sidewalk cafes.
	   ``You know who we are. We will need you soon,'' a recent high
school graduate quoted an anonymous caller as saying.
	   Another young ethnic Albanian said callers asked him what he
could contribute to the struggle between the Kosovo Liberation Army
and the Serb-led government.
	   ``They called a lot of people in my neighborhood,'' he said.
	   Both spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing arrest or
harassment by Serb authorities.
	   On the surface, this provincial capital of concrete apartment
blocks, coffee bars and flirting teen-agers appears far removed
from the conflict between KLA guerrillas and Serb forces, even
though some of the fighting is as close as five miles away.
	   Except for a July 3 bombing in a Serb neighborhood that caused
no injuries _ which police blamed on the KLA _ the city has been
spared from the violence.
	   But some young Albanians say the KLA is trying to build an
underground network in the capital _ their ultimate target in the
battle for independence from Serbia, the dominant of two republics
that make up the remainder of Yugoslavia.
	   The United States and the other five nations that coordinate
international policy in the Balkans support significant autonomy
but not independence for Kosovo. The so-called Contact Group has
called for an immediate cease-fire between the Serbs and the ethnic
Albanians.
	   It is impossible to determine how many young Albanians have been
approached by the KLA, or how many have joined the urban
underground.
	   There are no known incidents of retribution against those who
received a call from the KLA but did not commit themselves. How
long that relative tolerance would last was unclear.
	   A Serb crackdown on Albanian militants that began in February
has caused hundreds of deaths and a surge in support for the
militants among ethnic Albanians, who outnumber Serbs in Kosovo
9-to-1.
	   Reflecting that support, the Albanian-language Koha Ditore
newspaper reported Tuesday that 2,000 people attended a swearing-in
ceremony for new KLA members in Malisevo, 25 miles south of
Pristina.
	   The recruits, whose numbers were not reported, took an oath to
``fight for the liberation of occupied territories of Albania and
their unification ... regardless of the danger to my life.''
	   Despite the KLA's growing strength, many Pristina residents
doubt the guerrillas can threaten the capital without a clandestine
network among the city's 200,000 residents.
	   ``There will never be KLA soldiers from the countryside marching
on Pristina,'' said Albin Kurti, a nonviolent representative of the
23,000-member Kosovo Albanian students' union. ``The KLA can only
conquer Pristina with people from Pristina.''
	   The city's 12,000 students appear to be the main target of
guerrilla recruiters. Kurti estimates 2,000 students, mostly from
Kosovo's strife-torn west, have joined the KLA since the crackdown
began.
	   In recent weeks, self-styled KLA spokesmen have been boasting of
capturing the capital.
	   ``The day when the KLA will be present in Pristina is not far,''
Jakup Krasniqi was quoted by Koha Ditore as saying.
	   In case the war does come to Pristina, the students' union
recently organized a first-aid course, including how to treat
bullet and land-mine wounds and how to cope psychologically with
death and devastation.
	   A young Albanian doctor, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the guerrillas are closer than many people think.
	   ``I fight with my neighbor because he keeps playing loud
music,'' he said. ``But then it seems ridiculous in this situation.
It's not so loud that I can't hear gunfire.''

12 killed in Yemen shooting and explosion

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Tribesmen angered by government fuel price
hikes ambushed troops in an oil-rich region of Yemen, killing eight
soldiers, a tribal leader said.
	   The army retaliated after the attack Monday, sending helicopter
gunships to fire missiles at suspected tribal hideouts, the
opposition al-Wihadawy newspaper said Tuesday. There were no
casualties, it said.
	   The ambush occurred in the hills of al-Jawaf and Marib, an
oil-rich region 170 kilometers (105 miles) northeast of the
capital, San'a, said the tribal leader, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   Tribesmen have blown up seven pipelines in the area since June
19, when the government raised the prices of gasoline, kerosene and
cooking gas by 40 percent to meet International Monetary Fund
demands to remove oil subsidies.
	   In its drive for financial reform, the government has already
cut other subsidies and stepped up privatization of
state-controlled companies.
	   The government has sent reinforcements to Marib and al-Jawaf to
quell the unrest, Al-Wihadawy said. It said more than 50 tanks,
dozens of armored personnel carriers and heavy artillery were seen
moving toward Marib.
	   The government has not released a death toll from the clashes,
but the Yemen Times newspaper said earlier this month that 52
people were killed and 214 injured.
	   In a separate incident, five people were killed and two were
seriously injured Monday night after grenades, rockets and guns
stored in their house exploded, security officials said Tuesday.
	   The explosion occurred in Lahj, 35 kilometers (21 miles) north
of the southern port city of Aden. The arms cache was apparently a
remnant of the 1994 civil war and exploded accidentally, the
officials said.

<TEXT>
	   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Russia's last czar and his family will be buried
Friday, the 80th anniversary of their executions by the Bolsheviks.
Most Russians only know of Nicholas II from history books. But in
the old imperial capital of St. Petersburg, four elderly residents
vividly recall life in the turbulent years surrounding his
execution on July 17, 1918.
	   ___
 &UR; By ALICE LAGNADO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ Georgy Lugovoi grew up in an
apartment on St. Petersburg's central Nevsky Prospect, just around
the corner from the palace where Czar Nicholas II lived with the
rest of the Romanov royal family.
	   He was 17 when the Russian Revolution broke out and life
changed.
	   ``We were very afraid, and we loved the czar's family and felt
afraid for them,'' Lugovoi says. ``I spent all my time walking the
streets. There were lots of people around, working people,
peasants. ... The police were shooting from the roofs.''
	   Born in 1900, Lugovoi was five years older than Alexei, the
fragile, hemophiliac heir to the throne. He remembers walking past
the palace and seeing the czar's children at the windows, looking
down at the street.
	   ``Alexei was always carried around by a big sailor,'' he says.
	   Lugovoi, the son of a successful merchant, survived the turmoil
to become a news photographer, which allowed him to record many of
the country's great dramas. His family's large apartment was
converted into a communal dwelling, and he lived that way until two
years ago, when his wife died and he moved in with his daughter.
	   Although his family ``very much loved, respected and valued the
czar,'' Lugovoi believes Nicholas, as a leader, was too weak.
	   ``He was too kind,'' he says, and curls his fingers into fists.
``He should have seized Russia and held her firmly in his hands.''
	   ____
	   Ilya Musin was 9 when the quiet town of Kostroma, where the
Romanov dynasty was founded in 1613, celebrated the 300th
anniversary of the family's rule.
	   The central Russian town was decorated to look like a
17th-century village, and the czar steamed in on a riverboat for
the festivities.
	   ``Various types of soldiers, which don't exist nowadays, came
from different parts of Russia,'' he says. ``They were ... all on
horseback in beautiful uniforms.''
	   Musin, now 94, says his family had no sense of the impending
political changes. The revolution had little impact on Kostroma at
first, says Musin, who moved to St. Petersburg in 1919 to study
piano.
	   By then, the Russian Civil War was under way. A lack of heat
made the conservatory's practice rooms so cold that Musin
permanently damaged the muscles in his hands. He could never play
again and switched to conducting.
	   Eventually he became a teacher, founding a new school of
technique and nurturing generations of top conductors. Musin still
teaches at the conservatory and shares his three-room apartment
with aspiring students.
	   After all these years, his memories of the old hardships and the
Soviet-era informers remain clear.
	   ``Supposing I knew you and you knew me,'' he says. ``Then we
could sit down together, lock ourselves away somewhere and have a
cry.''
	   ____
	   While she was growing up, Sofia Khvatskaya's mother used to tell
her stories about the coronation of Czar Nicholas II in 1896.
	   ``She said there were very many people on the streets, and that
there were many good things to eat _ sweets and pies and
pastries,'' she says. ``And there were presents from the czar. His
assistants gave them out in the street.''
	   Khvatskaya's family owned about 10 acres of land near the
central town of Yaroslavl, with both a winter house and a summer
house, cows, horses, pigs and sheep.
	   She spent her days digging potatoes, feeding chickens and
carrying water from the river. But her family, considered
well-to-do, lost everything after the communists came to power.
	   Khvatskaya, now 92, became a dressmaker. Her husband, Alexander,
spent more than a decade in Stalin's prisons and camps.
	   She says her family prayed for the safety of the czar and his
family after he abdicated in 1917. People ``felt sick in their
souls'' when they heard the royal family had been executed.
	   ``Nicholas was the one in charge,'' she says. ``So all right,
shoot him. But why the family, the children? That was real
blasphemy.''
	   ____
	   Seven years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Mikhail
Lobodin still fears retaliation from authorities if he says too
much. But he's 96 now, and willing to take a few risks.
	   Lobodin was 15 and living in the southern city of Rostov-on-Don
when the Bolsheviks took power _ a regime he calls ``the rule of
blood.''
	   ``From October 1917, a new era of public life began,'' he says.
``A great evil came to pass. Millions died.''
	   Lobodin became a children's book writer, as well as a lawyer and
economist. He finds it shameful that it has taken so long to bury
the czar's bones since they were unearthed from a pit in 1991, and
believes the funeral should be a time of reckoning for Russia, a
``solemn affair.''
	   ``It should be done in a way that people remember what happened
all their lives, and understand that what happened was a profound
tragedy.''

Dollar lower in Tokyo, Japanese stocks rise in early trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar was lower against the yen early
Wednesday from its level in Tokyo the previous day amid continued
uncertainty over who will emerge as Japan's next leader. Japanese
stocks rose moderately.
	   The dollar bought 140.30 yen in early trading, down 1.06 yen
from late Tuesday in Tokyo but above its late New York rate of
140.02 yen overnight.
	   The yen held its strength on the belief that Japan remains
committed to reforms to buoy up Japan's economy, despite the ruling
party's crushing defeat in Sunday's elections for the upper house
of Parliament.
	   Traders said, however, that dollar-yen trading will remain in a
narrow range for the time being as they wait to see who will
succeed outgoing Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, who announced
his resignation on Monday after the electoral defeat.
	   On the stock market, share prices continued to advance as
investors were encouraged by the dollar's retreat against the yen
as well as an overnight record high close on Wall Street.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 50.55 points, or 0.31
percent, to 16,539.46 in the first 30 minutes of trading. On
Tuesday, the Nikkei index closed up 128.52 points, or 0.79 percent.
	   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average closed at
9,245.54, up 149.33 from Monday's close.
	   Also supporting Tokyo stocks were expectations that the
government will work out proposed permanent tax cuts aimed at
helping pull Japan out of recession, dealers said.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 5.14 points, or 0.41 percent, to 1,271.79. The
TOPIX closed up 10.21 points, or 0.81 percent, the day before.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 1.430 percent from Tuesday's finish of
1.445 percent, driving its price up to 110.20 yen from 110.11 yen.

El Guerrouj's battles are against clock now
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL; 
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Hicham El Guerrouj has been chasing Noureddine
Morceli for a long time.
	   First he ran after the man himself, and eventually took the
Algerian great's 1,500 meters title at the World Championships.
	   Since that breakthrough last summer, El Guerrouj's battle with
Morceli has taken on a new dimension: aiming for his status as the
world's premier middle distance runner, a mantle properly assumed
via the record books.
	   ``Right now I believe that only the clock can beat me. My only
enemy is Hicham,'' the 23-year-old Moroccan pronounced after
shattering Morceli's world record in the 1,500 meters at the IAAF
Golden Gala meet Tuesday night.
	   El Guerrouj appeared set to eclipse his rival at the 1996
Olympics, when he caught the Algerian with about 500 meters left in
the 1,500 final. But the two made contact and El Guerrouj fell to
the track after tangling with Morceli's right foot. Morceli won; El
Guerrouj was last.
	   There was no such slip-up Tuesday.
	   El Guerrouj ran the final lap alone, and this time when he hit
the ground it was to kiss the Olympic Stadium track after crossing
the finish line in 3 minutes, 26 seconds, more than a second faster
than the 3:27.37 three-time world champion Morceli ran at Nice,
France, in July 1995.
	   ``I expect these things,'' El Guerrouj said. ``I came with the
intention of breaking the record. Considering that last year here I
ran 3:30 under the rain, (Tuesday's) result is not surprising.''
	   Nor would it be surprising if his next conquest were Morceli's
mile mark, the most prestigious middle distance record.
	   The Moroccan's pursuit of Morceli first bore fruit at the Grand
Prix Finals in Milan, Italy, one month after the Atlanta Games. El
Guerrouj eased some of the Olympic disappointment by ending
Morceli's four-year unbeaten streak in the 1,500.
	   ``I have a lot of respect for Morceli,'' said El Guerrouj, who
switched from soccer to track when his mother complained he was
coming home dirty all the time, ``but I'm still at the beginning of
my career. There's more I can do.''
	   There's little Marion Jones can't do, it seems.
	   Jones managed Tuesday's only double victory, continuing her
dominance of the 100 meters and then going out a half-hour later to
beat a top field in the long jump.
	   The 100 world champion clocked a blistering 10.75 to beat
runner-up Chrystie Gaines by a full quarter-second, a lifetime in
the dash. Only two women _ Florence Griffith-Joyner, who owns the
record of 10.49, and Merlene Ottey _ have ever run faster. Jones
herself ran a 10.71 earlier this season.
	   The American's best long jump of 7.23 meters easily beat 1995
world champion Fiona May, who went 6.89.
	   Elsewhere, Michael Johnson rebounded from just his second loss
of the decade at 400 meters to win that race; Svetlana Masterkova
won the women's 1,500 in the year's best time (3:58.42), and
veteran Frankie Fredericks beat world champion Maurice Greene in
the 100 for the second time in a week.

Editor of powerful Malaysian daily quits under pressure
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The editor-in-chief of one of
Malaysia's biggest publishing groups has resigned, apparently over
differences with the governing party of Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad.
	   Johan Jaafar, of the Utusan Melayu publishing house, handed in
his resignation to Mahathir on Tuesday, the domestic news agency
Bernama reported.
	   Johan, 44, had headed the group that publishes the Utusan
Malaysia newspaper since 1992, the news agency said. He was not
immediately available for comment.
	   A journalist from Utusan quoted Johan as saying his resignation
was ``to prevent his presence from impeding the progress of the
group's newspapers and publications,'' Bernama reported.
	   The Malay-language daily has a circulation of about 250,000. On
Sundays it sells about half a million copies. It is Malaysia's most
influential newspaper.
	   The group is largely owned by Mahathir's United Malays National
Organization and the chief editor is often a political appointment
made by the prime minister.
	   Newspaper editors in Malaysia have often been removed after
falling out with their political bosses.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Prudential Insurance Co. and Mitsui Trust and
Banking Co. will establish a joint investment trust company in
Japan, a spokesman for the Japanese bank said Wednesday.
	   No details of the tie-up were available but the companies were
scheduled to hold a joint press conference later Wednesday in
Tokyo, the spokesman said.
	   Prudential is the largest insurance firm in the United States
and Mitsui is Japan's third largest trust bank, an institution that
specializes in managing money for companies and big investors.
	   Foreign firms have been rushing to get a foothold in the
Japanese market amid a program of reforms known as the ``big bang''
that is expected to open financial markets to new competitors.
	   After news of the tie-up, shares in Mitsui Trust jumped 30 yen
(21 cents), or 10 percent, to 335 yen (dlrs 2.39).

Government, unions seek end to Puerto Rico strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Talks between Puerto Rico's
government and labor unions have failed to end a strike by workers
protesting the sale of the state-owned telephone company.
	   Government Secretary Angel Morey said late Tuesday that his side
had rejected union demands that strikers who return to work be
spared sanctions. He didn't elaborate.
	   Jose Juan Hernandez, head of the Independent Telephone Employees
Union, said the two striking labor unions had rejected a government
demand that they be barred from taking to the streets again.
	   About 6,400 Puerto Rico Telephone Co. workers went on strike
June 18 to protest the dlrs 1.9 billion sale to U.S.-based GTE
Corp. and other investors.
	   Union leaders want job guarantees. The government says a
publicly-owned telephone company cannot compete in Puerto Rico's
newly-deregulated market.
	   The telephone company says it has lost dlrs 10 million because
of damage caused by saboteurs who slashed telephone cables.
	   A two-day general strike in support of the telephone workers
snarled traffic and slowed commerce last week.
	   The Greater Committee of Labor Organizations, which represents
about 60 unions, plans local protests on Thursday in eastern Puerto
Rican towns.

Rangers finally sign Richter
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ADAM NAZIMOWITZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ After much negotiation and speculation, goalie
Mike Richter will remain with the New York Rangers, the Associated
Press has learned.
	   The team finally reached agreement late Tuesday with its goalie,
who has played only with the Rangers in nine National Hockey League
seasons, according to a source within the organization familiar
with negotiations.
	   Richter won a place in Rangers history as the goalie who helped
New York win the Stanley Cup in 1994, the team's first in 54 years.
But just two days ago, it appeared Richter would be playing
elsewhere as the Rangers looked to close negotiations with
free-agent goalie Curtis Joseph.
	   Those talks hit a snag when Joseph's agent, Don Meehan, said he
had an offer for more money from another team.
	   Richter, who had expressed a desire to remain with New York,
will reportedly get a four-year deal worth between dlrs 5.4 million
and dlrs 5.5 million a year.
	   Rangers spokesman Rob Koch said the team planned a news
conference Wednesday, but he declined to specify the subject.
	   Richter, who will turn 32 in September, wasn't protected by the
Rangers in the June 26 expansion draft and he was selected by
Nashville. On July 1, Richter became an unrestricted free agent and
was free to negotiate with any NHL team.
	   Richter, who recently rejected a three-year, dlrs 15 million
deal and a five-year, dlrs 27 million offer by the Rangers, was
21-31-15 with a 2.66 goals-against average last season.

Hanson: Aboriginal voting rights may have been a mistake
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ Australians should have thought twice
about allowing Aborigines to vote, right-wing populist leader
Pauline Hanson has declared.
	   In a speech to about 500 people at a One Nation party
fund-raising dinner Tuesday night, Hanson said that while
Aborigines had a tough time in the past, the tables had now turned
``too far the other way.''
	   ``Aboriginals have had it very tough in the past and I admit
that _ they were mistreated,'' said Hanson, who is an independent
member of federal Parliament from Queensland.
	   ``They didn't have the right to vote until the Australian
people, in the referendum of 1967 when they cast that vote _ when
they believed that Aboriginals should have the right to vote and
should be treated equally, the same as everyone else.
	   ``But if Australians knew today what was foreshadowed for them,
they would have thought twice about casting that vote because they
were looking at giving the Aboriginal race equality.
	   ``But over the years the pendulum has gone too far the other way
and now there is so much discrimination, so much inequality in our
society that it is causing resentment amongst all people,'' she
said.
	   Hanson and her One Nation party believe Aborigines are now too
privileged, and want the abolition of any welfare or other special
programs designed to help them.
	   Australia has a wide variety of welfare and aid programs for
various special interest groups, ranging from refugees to
unemployed young people to drought-stricken farmers.
	   Hanson said she would be the first person to give Aboriginal
people a helping hand but told the audience they needed to help
Aborigines ``stand on their own two feet.''
	   Hanson said she was not racist and had been approached by a lot
of Aboriginal people for help.
	   ``I will not ever be called a racist and accept that because I
want accountability,'' she said.
	   Federal Aboriginal Affairs Minister John Herron on Wednesday
accused Hanson of being misinformed after she said indigenous
people were only given the right to vote in the 1967 referendum.
	   ``The 1967 referendum had nothing whatsoever to do with the
right to vote, it simply gave the commonwealth the power to
legislate on the behalf of indigenous people and to include them in
the census.
	   ``As to suggestions they should lose that basic democratic
right, I totally reject that,'' he said.
	   Herron said indigenous people were not subjected to any specific
restrictions against their right to vote in South Australia, New
South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania.
	   ``Restrictions were lifted in Western Australia in 1962 and in
Queensland in 1965,'' he said.
	   ``The Commonwealth Electoral Act of 1962 gave indigenous
Australians the unqualified right to enroll and vote in federal
elections,'' he said.
	   Aborigines make up about 386,000 of Australia's 18 million
people.
	   They consistently have the highest poverty and disease rates,
highest infant mortality rates and shortest life spans of any
Australian group.
	   Meanwhile, the opposition Labor Party has warned in an internal
report that the country's next Prime Minister could be forced to
rely on Hanson to stay in power.
	   The Daily Telegraph newspaper said the document raised the
prospect of One Nation winning the balance of power in the lower
House of Representatives at the next federal election.

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ John Smoltz revived Atlanta's rotation with
eight strong innings, and also hit a go-ahead single as the Braves
broke a three-game losing streak Tuesday night with a 4-2 victory
over the New York Mets.
	   Chipper Jones hit a solo home run and an RBI double _ misjudged
by new Mets left fielder Todd Hundley _ helping Atlanta avoid
matching its longest skid of the season.
	   The win by Smoltz (7-2) came after Denny Neagle, Greg Maddux and
Tom Glavine lost Atlanta's three previous three games at Florida.
Not since April 29-May 3, 1994, had Braves starting pitchers lost
four straight games.
	   Smoltz gave up a two-out, two-run single in the third to Hundley
_ his first RBIs of the season _ but only one hit after that. He
gave up six hits, struck out six and walked two as he matched his
longest outing of the season. Kerry Ligtenberg pitched the ninth
for his 11th save.
	   Bobby Jones (7-6) took the loss.
 &UR; Cubs 7, Pirates 4 &QC; 
	   In Pittsburgh, Glenallen Hill had three hits and two RBIs,
including one of four consecutive run-scoring singles in a six-run
sixth inning for Chicago.
	   Sammy Sosa failed to homer for the fourth consecutive game _ he
has 35 homers in 93 games _ but contributed an RBI single among the
Cubs' 11 hits.
	   Wildness by Pittsburgh starter Chris Peters (3-7) and right
fielder Jose Guillen's two-base throwing error contributed to the
Cubs' outburst, which turned a 3-1 deficit into a 7-3 lead.
	   Kevin Tapani (10-6) was the beneficiary of the big inning,
overcoming Guillen's two-run double and Turner Ward's homer to post
his eighth 10-win season in the 1990s. He left after giving up four
runs and nine hits in seven innings.
	   After Terry Mulholland pitched a scoreless eighth, Rod Beck
pitched the ninth for his 25th save.

	   OAKLAND, California (AP) _ Kenny Rogers pitched six scoreless
innings before leaving with soreness in his left hamstring as the
Oakland Athletics defeated Anaheim 6-2 Tuesday for their fifth
straight win over the Angels.
	   Rogers (9-3), who allowed four hits and walked three, was
visited on the mound during the sixth inning by a trainer and
manager Art Howe. He got out of the inning, leaving runners on
second and third, but did not return.
	   Rogers gave the A's 30 wins by starting pitchers this year, one
more than the entire 1997 season.
	   The A's scored three runs in the first on RBI singles by Matt
Stairs and Jason Giambi and a sacrifice fly by Miguel Tejada. They
added two in the second on a wild pitch by Omar Olivares (5-6) and
another RBI single by Stairs.
 &UR; Devil Rays 5, Red Sox 4
	   In St. Petersburg, Florida, Miguel Cairo's ninth-inning single
drove in the winning run as Tampa Bay ended its 11-game losing
streak.
	   Cairo singled up the middle off Carlos Reyes after Bobby Smith
singled and Paul Sorrento doubled off Ron Mahay (1-1). Sorrento's
double was for his fourth hit of the game.
	   Sorrento also homered off Bret Saberhagen for Tampa Bay's first
run in the fifth inning. Albie Lopez (5-2) pitched two innings to
get the victory.
 &UR; Tigers 8, Royals 3
	   In Detroit, Justin Thompson finally won a home game and Tony
Clark hit a three-run homer as Detroit beat Kansas City.
	   Luis Gonzalez and Deivi Cruz also homered and Damion Easley
added a two-run double for the Tigers.
	   Jose Offerman had a pair of RBI singles for the Royals.
	   Thompson (8-8) hadn't won at Tiger Stadium since last Sept. 5,
He entered Tuesday with an 0-6 record and 5.56 ERA at home this
year. He allowed three runs on seven hits in six-plus innings.
	   Tim Belcher (8-8) gave up eight runs on 12 hits in six-plus
innings as he lost for just the second time in his last eight
decisions, both against Detroit.
 &UR; Yankees 7, Indians 1 &QC; 
	   In Cleveland, Andy Pettitte plunked Yankee-killer Jim Thome on
the arm, then breezed through the rest of the Cleveland lineup for
a six-hitter.
	   With a split in the playoff-like two-game series, the Yankees
improved to 66-21 and kept pace with the 1902 Pittsburgh Pirates
for the best start this century.
	   Thome, 8-for-21 with three homers against the Yankees this
season, was hit on the right forearm by a fastball from Pettitte
(12-5) in the first. X-rays were negative on the All-Star first
baseman's arm.
	   Chuck Knoblauch hit his sixth homer, a solo shot leading off the
seventh that made it 4-1 against Dave Burba (10-7).
 &UR; Orioles 11, Blue Jays 5 &QC; 
	   In Baltimore, Chris Hoiles hit a grand slam to cap a six-run
first inning that lifted Baltimore to its sixth straight victory.
	   Rafael Palmeiro, B.J. Surhoff and Joe Carter added solo homers
for the Orioles, who completed their most successful homestand in
five years.
	   Surhoff went 4-for-4 and is 10-for-13 over his last three games,
including hits in each of his last seven at-bats.
	   Mike Mussina (7-5) pitched a seven-hitter, striking out six and
walking one, in his third complete game of the season.
	   Williams (8-4) allowed eight runs and 10 hits in five innings
for Toronto, which lost for the fifth time in six games.

	   ANDREWS, North Carolina (AP) _ The manhunt intensified again for
abortion clinic bombing suspect Eric Rudolph after authorities said
he took a truck and a six-month supply of food from a home last
week.
	   Rudolph, on the run nearly six months following the Alabama
bombing, was seen Thursday by the man officials say he robbed. He
disappeared after ditching the truck at a campground that leads
into the mountains and areas honeycombed with caves, according to
authorities.
	   Police said Rudolph stole the truck and the food from the man,
who operates a health food store.
	   However ABC News reported Tuesday the man Rudolph took the food
from was a friend. And the network, citing FBI sources, said
Rudolph left him money to pay for the supplies.
	   Rudolph's friend waited 24 hours before calling the sheriff,
according ABC, and Rudolph reportedly told this man that he has a
great hiding place.
	   NBC News also reported that Rudolph left money for the food and
a list of items he wanted but didn't get.
	   Patrick Crosby, a Justice Department spokesman with the
Southeast Bomb Task Force in Andrews, would neither confirm nor
deny the broadcast reports.
	   The area where Rudolph disappeared is at the southern tip of the
Appalachians.
	   Members of the Southeast Bombing Task Force converged on this
area near the tip of western North Carolina with bloodhounds and
extra manpower.
	   Rudolph, a 31-year-old outdoorsman and carpenter, is charged in
the Jan. 29 bombing of the New Woman All Women clinic, which killed
an off-duty police officer and seriously wounded a nurse in
Birmingham, Alabama. He also is wanted for questioning three
bombings in Georgia, including the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Park
bombing.
	   The FBI placed Rudolph on its 10 most wanted list on May 6 and
increased the reward to dlrs 1 million for anyone with information
leading to his arrest and conviction.
	   Since he was named a suspect in the clinic bombing, Rudolph has
evaded a nationwide search. The reward for information leading to
his capture has grown to dlrs 1 million.
	   Federal agents also want to question him about similar bombings
in Atlanta, including the bombing at Centennial Olympic Park in
July 1996 that killed one and injured more than 100. The other
attacks in Atlanta were at an abortion clinic in January 1997 and
at a gay nightclub in February 1997.

Dollar lower in Tokyo, Japanese stocks rise in morning session
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with late-morning stock and bond prices, dollar rate

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar was lower against the yen Wednesday
morning on hopes economic reform will continue despite political
turmoil. Japanese stocks rose moderately.
	   The dollar bought 140.69 yen in morning trading, down 0.67 yen
from late Tuesday in Tokyo but above its late New York rate of
140.02 yen overnight.
	   The yen strengthened on optimism that Japan remains committed to
reforms to buoy its economy, despite the ruling party's crushing
defeat in Sunday's elections for the upper house of Parliament.
	   Traders said, however, that the currencies will likely trade in
a narrow range until a successor is chosen for outgoing Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto. Hashimoto announced his resignation on
Monday after the electoral defeat.
	   On the stock market, share prices continued to advance as
investors were encouraged by the dollar's retreat against the yen
as well as an overnight record high close on Wall Street.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 59.34 points, or 0.36
percent, to 16,548.25 at the close of the morning session. On
Tuesday, the Nikkei index closed up 128.52 points, or 0.79 percent.
	   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average closed at
9,245.54, up 149.33 from Monday's close.
	   Also supporting Tokyo stocks were expectations that the
government will work out proposed permanent tax cuts aimed at
helping pull Japan out of recession, dealers said.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 5.47 points, or 0.43 percent, to 1,272.12. The
TOPIX closed up 10.21 points, or 0.81 percent, the day before.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 1.390 percent from Tuesday's finish of
1.445 percent, driving its price up to 110.49 yen from 110.11 yen.

Thai court throws out suit by suspended police general
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's Civil Court has thrown out a
suit lodged by the country's most controversial police general
seeking to overturn the Interior Minister's order suspending him
for insubordination.
	   The police general, Salang Bunnag, said he would appeal directly
to Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai for reinstatement, The Nation, an
English-language daily reported Wednesday.
	   Salang is being investigated by the Interior Ministry for
allegedly ordering the extrajudicial killings of six drug dealers
in 1996.
	   Salang admitted shortly after the incident that he ordered his
men to shoot the dealers, whom police marched handcuffed into a
shack and killed with single bullets to the head.
	   After a public outcry, however, Salang changed his story to say
police shot the suspects in self defense after they tried to
wrestle away the officers' guns.
	   The government of former Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh
and the police department refused to investigate Salang, and polls
showed many Thais supported his actions.
	   Upon taking office late last year, Sanan revived the
investigation into the case as one step toward cleaning up the Thai
police force, which has a reputation for corruption.
	   Salang recently lashed out verbally at Sanan for dredging up the
case, and Sanan suspended him pending a disciplinary hearing which
has yet to take place.
	   The court ruled that as the hearing hadn't taken place, it would
not hear the suit.
	   Local papers reported over the weekend that Chuan's security
detail was concerned over possible violent retaliation by Salang or
his supporters.
	   Salang led a police assault on students protesting peacefully
for social change at Thammasat University in Bangkok in 1976.
Hundreds of young people were shot dead, burned alive, hanged and
mutilated.
	   He joked on radio a few days after the attack that those who had
been killed weren't Thai, but merely Vietnamese.

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A despondent Thai policeman committed
suicide by leaping from the 13th floor of a police office building
in Bangkok, The Nation newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   The officer, Sgt. Maj. Sorasak Palat-intanao, 38, who worked in
the criminal records division, had twice tried to kill himself in
the past, the paper quoted his colleagues as saying.
	   His supervisor told the paper that the officer was on medication
to help him cure a drinking problem and may have overdosed, thus
causing his erratic behavior.

Small jetliner makes safe emergency landing in Indonesia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A commuter jetliner safely made an
emergency landing at Jakarta's main airport Wednesday after it
reported problems with its landing gear, witnesses said.
	   The twin-engined Fokker, with more than 20 passengers and crew
aboard, took off from Sukarno-Hatta International Airport at 6.20
a.m. (23:20 GMT Tuesday).
	   It returned 30 minutes later with technical problems, Merpati
Nusantara Airlines said.
	   The airline declined to give further details. However,
passengers said they were told there had been a problem with one of
the plane's wheels.
	   Many of those on board were reporters, photographers and news
crews on their way to the disputed territory of East Timor, 2,000
kilometers (1,300 miles) to the east.
	   They had planned to cover a scheduled visit there by U.N.
special envoy Jamsheed Marker later this week.
	   Marker is trying to broker a peace deal for the half-island
territory, which has endured a separatist guerrilla war as well as
protests and human rights abuses since Indonesia annexed it in
1976.

Guatemalan army denounces accusation of involvement in bishop's
</HEADLINE>
killing &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ Guatemala's army has denounced an
accusation by a Roman Catholic church worker who said two officers
were involved in the assassination of a bishop in April.
	   Ronalth Ochaeta, who worked with Bishop Juan Gerardi Conedera at
the Archbishop's Office of Human Rights, made the accusation Monday
during a visit to Madrid. He is in Spain to present a human rights
report.
	   He said he had given government investigators the license plate
number of a car with military markings that was near the house of
the bishop the evening he was killed.
	   Ochaeta did not give the names of the two officers he said were
involved in the killing, nor did he specify how he believed they
were involved. He said only that one of the officers once was a
member of the Presidential Guard.
	   In a statement read by spokeswoman Edith Vargas, the military on
Tuesday called it ``strange that Ronalth Ochaeta hasn't given the
information he has made public abroad to national news media.''
	   ``We should remember that any fact, piece of proof or
information that helps to clarify the case, should be presented to
the corresponding legal authorities, and he who doesn't do that is
committing a crime,'' Vargas said.
	   Gerardi was killed April 26, two days after presenting a report
denouncing human rights violations by the army and its
paramilitaries during Guatemala's 36-year civil war, which ended in
December 1996.
	   He was beaten to death with a cement block in the garage of his
home within the San Sebastian church.
	   The only person arrested in the case is Juan Carlos Vielman, 24,
who has maintained his innocence. He is being held on suspicion of
involvement in the murder.

Dominican congress approves extradition to U.S.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ The Dominican Congress
on approved legislation, long sought by Washington, allowing
Dominican nationals to be extradited to the United States and other
countries.
	   President Leonel Fernandez was expected to sign the measure into
law within two weeks.
	   The Dominican Republic is a major transshipment point for
illicit drugs headed from South America to the U.S. mainland, and
hundreds of Dominicans are wanted for trial in U.S. courts on
related charges.
	   The Clinton administration has requested the extradition of 30
suspects in this Caribbean nation, while New York City police say
they want some 400 Dominican nationals for assorted crimes.
	   Crimes covered by Tuesday's measure include drug trafficking,
money laundering, murder, kidnapping and armed robbery.
	   Extradition is a controversial topic here that was made more
complicated by conflicting laws. While a 1910 treaty permitted
extraditions to the United States, a 1969 law prohibited Dominicans
from being turned over to other nations. Tuesday's legislation
supersedes the 1969 law.

More workers join nationwide strike in South Korea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ With police poised to arrest their
leaders, some 45,000 employees of state-run firms and five banks
joined a nationwide strike Wednesday to protest layoffs.
	   The new walkouts brought to about 100,000 the number of workers
participating in the strike begun Tuesday by metal workers in auto,
shipbuilding and other heavy industries.
	   But 50,000 unionized workers at Korea Telecom, the national
telephone company, refused to join the strike, saying negotiations
with management on wages and other issues were making progress.
	   Police sought arrest warrants for more than a dozen labor union
officials on charges of leading illegal strikes, and the government
again appealed to workers to return to their jobs.
	   Police said many of the striking unions failed to take legally
obliged steps such as seeking government mediation of their
disputes with management.
	   The government said the strike would scare off badly needed
foreign investment, essential to revive the nation's ailing
economy.
	   ``Without restructuring of the public sector, there will no
reform,'' said Park Ji-won, a spokesman for President Kim Dae-jung.
	   ``The government repeatedly promised to do its best to minimize
job losses. The labor unions should come and talk to a tripartite
committee, not go for strikes,'' Park said.
	   The nation's two major union umbrella groups walked out of
negotiations with industry and government officials last week,
saying they would not return unless the government takes steps to
stop increasing layoffs.
	   ``We cannot help expressing our anger that the government is
poised to arrest workers who are fighting for their just rights. We
will go on with our schedule for the strike,'' the groups said in a
statement.
	   Restructuring South Korea's inefficient industries is a key
condition set by the International Monetary Fund, which bailed out
the country's economy late last year.
	   Since then, the number of jobless people has doubled to nearly
1.5 million and will likely top 2 million by the end of the year.
	   All of the strikers except 26,000 workers from the nation's
leading auto company, Hyundai Motors Co., were scheduled to return
to work Friday. The Hyundai strike was indefinite.
