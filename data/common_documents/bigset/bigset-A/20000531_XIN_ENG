<HEADLINE> Nepali Govt Presents Budget Proposal to Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Faced with an upbeat economic
outlook of six percent growth, the Nepali government announced
Tuesday an ambitious budget proposal for the fiscal year (FY)
starting on the coming July 16.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Mahesh Acharya proposed at the parliament a
spending of about 92 billion rupees (1.3 billion U.S. dollars) for
the 2000/2001 FY starting on July 16, comparing to 77.24 billion
rupees (1.1 billion U.S. dollars) for the current FY (ending on
July 15 this year).
</P>
<P>
"The present budget represents an increase of 35 percent over
the current FY," said Acharya.
</P>
<P>
The increased expenses will go to hike in civil servants pay
and security arrangement among others.
</P>
<P>
The budget set aside 43.5 billion rupees (603 million U.S.
dollars) for regular expenditure, including expenses by the
government, military, police and judiciary, while 48.1 billion
rupees (688 million U.S. dollars) will be allocated for
development projects, including those relating to poverty
alleviation.
</P>
<P>
Acharya aims to raise 64.82 billion rupees (927 million U.S.
dollars) from revenue and new tax proposals, besides receiving
about 20 billion rupees (300 U.S. dollars) from bilateral and
multilateral grants.
</P>
<P>
To increase the revenue, Acharya proposed to widen the net for
income tax and to further hike VAT (value added tax), which was
implemented from last August.
</P>
<P>
Acharya's proposition to substantially increase the salary of
government employees, police, army and teachers is feared to
enhance inflation, further marginalizing the ordinary people,
about 50 percent of whom are living on an average daily income of
less than one U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
"The new budget should lay emphasis on poverty alleviation and
on agricultural production, on which 80 percent of people are
living," said Bharat Adhikari, a MP from the opposition CPN-UML (
Communist Party of Nepal-United Marxist and Leninist).

<HEADLINE> Zambian President Candidate under Investigation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Ben Mwila, a candidate running for
the Zambian presidential elections next year, was under
investigations over embezzlement of public funds.
</P>
<P>
A government minister said here Tuesday that Zambian
auditor-general is scrutinizing how public funds at the ministry
of defense were utilized when Ben Mwila was Defense Minister from
1991 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
Information Minister and government spokesman Newstead Zimba
told a news briefing that a report which is being compiled by the
auditor general' s office would be handed over to President
Frederick Chiluba and it will be tabled at the national assembly.
</P>
<P>
Mwila, current Environment Minister, announced last Friday that
he would run for the presidency of the ruling Movement for
Multi-Party Democracy (MMD ) so as to pave the way for the general
elections next year.
</P>
<P>
A number of party cadres and the Nation Executive Committee of
the MMD called for Mwila's expulsion from the party after he
publicly announced his candidature.
</P>
<P>
Mwila, one of the country's richest with a business empire
spanning manufacturing, construction, finance and fertilizers,
helped incumbent President Frederick Chiluba defeat former
President Kenneth Kaunda in the 1991 elections and now is seen as
a leading candidate to replace Chiluba in the next year's
elections.
</P>
<P>
But Chiluba has indicated that he would ensure that Mwila does
not become the president and MMD has said it is not the time to
start the election campaign.

<HEADLINE> Syria Offers Full Cooperation with U.N.: Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister Faruk
Shareh said on Wednesday his country is ready to "cooperate fully"
with the United Nations to ensure the full implementation of U.N.
resolutions concerning Israeli troop withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Shareh made the pledge to the official Syria Arab News Agency
after meeting with U.N. special Middle East envoy Terje Roed-
Larsen, who arrived here Wednesday morning from south Lebanon for a
brief visit to Syria.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Shareh called on the United Nations to
shoulder its responsibilities in ensuring the implementation of
relevant U.N. resolutions, especially resolutions 242 and 338, in
order to establish fair and comprehensive peace, security and
stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
Larsen briefed Shareh on the work of the U.N. mission in south
Lebanon and the progress made so far in implementing U.N. Security
Council Resolution 425 of 1978, which calls for an immediate and
unconditional Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.N. will not issue any report on the withdrawal
until it verifies that Israel has completely pulled out its troops
from the occupied Lebanese territories, Larsen told reporters after
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. envoy said he and Shareh had discussed the issue of
deploying the Lebanese army in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon refused to deploy government troops in south Lebanon
vacated by Israel until the U.N. has verified that the Israeli
withdrawal is complete.
</P>
<P>
Larsen said that during the talks Shareh informed him that Syria
has agreed that the Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon should
not include the disputed Shebaa Farms, an area both Lebanon and
Syria claimed as Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
Larsen was due in Beirut later Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Threatens Peru on Funds for the Drugs War: Peru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The United States cannot exert
economic pressure on Peru by cutting the assistance it gives to
the South American country to fight drug trafficking, said Fight
Against Drugs Consuming Commission (CONTRADROGAS) president
Alejandro Aguinaga on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign assistance is important, but they cannot limit us
using that issue," said the official in relation to the
possibility that the United States might reduce its economic
support to combat drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Aguinaga dismissed the possibility that the U.S. government
might apply some kind of sanctions to Peru because of the
allegedly irregular electoral process of Sunday, by which
President Alberto Fujimori was elected for a third mandate.
</P>
<P>
The United States threatened Peru with economic and political
sanctions and the cut of military assistance if it did not carry
out transparent elections, through Resolution No. 43, promoted by
U.S. Congress and backed by President Bill Clinton himself.
</P>
<P>
According to Aguinaga, the relation between foreign aid and
what Peru invests in the war on drugs is one-to-seven, and if that
support is reduced the country would have to make an effort to
achieve its goals.
</P>
<P>
"The Peruvian government investment in the war on drugs
surpasses 700 million dollars, much more than all the external
assistance the country receives for that purpose," said the Fight
Against Drugs Consuming Commission president.

<P>
The Brazilian president said, commenting in Hanover, Germany,
the present economic situation of Argentina, that the situation in
that country is not easy and that Argentines are doing what they
must do.
</P>
<P>
"The Argentines have our solidarity, and I am confident that
Argentina will be able to retake the road of growing," said
Cardoso, who will inaugurate Wednesday in the German city the
Brazilian pavilion in the 2000 World Fair.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian president said that the Argentine crisis will
have little impact on the Brazilian economy, remembering that
despite the 1998 Russian crisis, Brazil recorded a positive growth
and a small inflation last year.
</P>
<P>
"Brazil has already gone through all this and came out all
right We need not at all imitate what is occurring in Argentina,
because the situation is different," he said.
</P>
<P>
President Cardoso said that the differences between the
Brazilian and Argentine exchange regimes will not be an obstacle
for the strengthening of the Southern Common Market (Mercosur).
</P>
<P>
According to the Brazilian president, what is important for the
country of the economic block is to maintain their budget
stability and keep inflation under control.

<HEADLINE> Price War Hits Sainsbury's Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Sainsbury's, the UK's second biggest
supermarket group, has announced a steep drop in profits - blaming,
in part, the ongoing food price war.
</P>
<P>
Underlying pre-tax profits for the year to April 3 crashed 23
percent from 755 million pounds to 580 million pounds, although
sales rose 6.3 percent to 17.4 billion pounds.
</P>
<P>
Sainsbury's said Wednesday the profit plunge was due to a poor
performance by its core supermarket business caused by vicious
price-cutting measures and higher staff and property costs.
</P>
<P>
The supermarket said it would be concentrating its program on
improving outlets in the battle to regain custom lost to other
food retailers such as Tesco and Wal-Mart's Asda chain.
</P>
<P>
Peter Davis, the group's newly installed chief executive, said:
"These results demonstrate that while we have two very strong
business .... we need to focus our efforts on our core supermarket
business."
</P>
<P>
But he admitted that recovery of the supermarket operations
would take time and he was going to concentrate on improving
Sainsbury's stores.
</P>
<P>
Peter also announced that at least 5000 jobs would be created
over the 12 months across the business. Over the last year the
group opened 20 new stores. This year it plans to open a further
13 and extend 35 others.

<HEADLINE> Italy's Bank Official Urges Reforms and Cutting Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Bank of Italy Governor Antonio Fazio
warned Wednesday that Italian business and industry are losing
ground in Europe on the competition and technological innovation
fronts and argued that a reduction in fiscal pressure and reforms
are urgently needed to free the nation's economy.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an audience which included the Italy's leading
authorities, bankers, economists and business and industry figures
gathered for the Bank of Italy's annual assembly, Fazio declared
that the time has come to unchain the nation through reforms to
revive investments, productivity and job creation.
</P>
<P>
"The positive phase of the international trend provides the
occasion to undertake reforms of the rules, public spending,
taxation," he said in his final considerations report delivered on
the red-letter day on the calendar for the Italian economy and
finance.
</P>
<P>
Citing statistics, economic indicators and forecasts and his
hopes for a degree of political stability, the central banker
signaled his desire to see a radical change of the public
administration, more equitable budgetary policy and greater
clarity in the roles of management, the government and labor.
</P>
<P>
On another front, Fazio said, "the New Economy is nothing other
than reorganization of the production set-up applied through
information and innovation. Small and medium-size enterprises in
the south can draw benefit from these great advances," he affirmed.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Declares War with Eritrea Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Zhao Yi
</P>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles
Zenawi announced Wednesday that Ethiopia's war against Eritrea was
over after Ethiopia has "liberated" all its territories lost to
Eritrea in their two- year border conflict.
</P>
<P>
Briefing resident diplomats and representatives of
international agencies here, Meles said "as of today we (Ethiopia)
have verified that all our territory is cleared from the invading
army of Eritrea".
</P>
<P>
Meles made the remarks after the Ethio-Eritrean indirect talks
held in Algiers agreed on a peaceful arrangement for the secession
of hostilities between the two Horn of African countries.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia and Eritrea began a new round of heavy fighting along
their disputed borders on May 12, with Ethiopian troops claiming
to get an upper hand in the battlefield.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia's objective "to reverse the aggression by peaceful
means, if possible, and by force, if necessary, has been
fulfilled", Meles said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that the government of Ethiopia has
changed the instructions for its army from attacking the enemy to
clear the territory to securing and protecting the liberated
areas.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia demanded the international community to provide
security guarantee to implement withdrawing its troops to the
positions before May 6, 1998, when the two countries started their
border conflict.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that "the high grounds in Shelao area of the Badme
front as well as those between Zalambessa and Senafe" must remain
clear of the Eritrean troops.
</P>
<P>
Badme, Zalambessa and Senafe are three towns situated in the
western and central border between Ethiopia and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
"We will remain where we are on the Zalambessa front," he said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister added that his country will continue to
redeploy its forces in the western front and the troops will clear
and secure the newly liberated areas in the eastern front.
</P>
<P>
Meles noted that as soon as agreement for secession of
hostilities is reached, Ethiopia is ready to go back to the border
boundaries before May 6, 1998, provided Ethiopia has the security
guarantee.
</P>
<P>
"We feel we have struck to our word and our promise that the
war will end as soon as all our territories are liberated -- not a
minute earlier, not a minute later.
</P>
<P>
"Our focus now is on the diplomatic negotiations front...If the
Eritrean army insists on extending 'warm welcome' to our army then
we will have no quarrels about making good of it, " Meles said.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Prisoners Suspend Hunger Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails,
who have been on a hunger strike since earlier this month, have
decided to suspend their hunger strike as of Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A commission for solidarity with Palestinian prisoners has also
told its members to suspend a sit-in in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
</P>
<P>
The move came after Palestinian and Israeli negotiators met
Tuesday in the West Bank town of Jericho to discuss the release of
more Palestinian prisoners and the conditions of hunger-striking
Palestinian prisoners in various Israeli jails.
</P>
<P>
However, the talks made no apparent progress on Palestinian
demands for the release of more than 200 Palestinian prisoners held
by Israel. Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat said Israel
promised an answer within a week.
</P>
<P>
Informed Palestinian sources said Israel initially agreed to
release an undisclosed number of Palestinian prisoners. The
Palestinian side has been demanding the release of 1,650
Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails.
</P>
<P>
Israel claimed it has released 383 Palestinian political
prisoners since the signing of the Sharm el-Sheikh memorandum last
September.  Hundreds of Palestinian prisoners started a hunger
strike earlier this month, demanding their release and in protest
against the inhumane treatment they received in Israeli jails.
</P>
<P>
A demonstration in support of the prisoners on May 21 turned
into bloody clashes between the Israeli troops and the
demonstrators, which killed 6 Palestinians and wounded over 1,000
others.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Calls for Substantial Negotiations in Third Round of Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government will take part
in a fourth round of proximity talks on Cyprus only if the third
round of talks warrants for a continuation, government spokesman
Michalis Papapetrou said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his daily press briefing, Papapetrou said President
Glafcos Clerides will go to the third round of talks, "prepared for
substantial negotiations, to discuss everything with good will and
in a positive spirit."
</P>
<P>
"If the Turkish (Cypriot) side has the same stance then there
will be real prospects to continue," he added.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the island in reaction to a coup in Nicosia
engineered by the junta then ruling Greece.
</P>
<P>
Two rounds of U.N.-sponsored proximity talks between the two
communities were held last December and February this year, during
which the two sides put forward their views on the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
A third round of talks is scheduled to start on July 5 in
Geneva. The Cyprus government believes it must be upgraded and
negotiations should begin to pave the way for a settlement on the
island.
</P>
<P>
Papapetrou said the Cyprus government does not participate in a
procedure for the sake of participating.
</P>
<P>
He said President Clerides is not prepared to continue what was
done in the previous rounds of talks, especially when no concrete
prospects are created for this process to continue.
</P>
<P>
"The third round of talks must prove that there are real
prospects to move forward on the problem," he added.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Ushers in Natural Disaster Task Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish Armed Forces (TSK) has
formed a task force to deal with natural disasters and provide
first-aid services, Anatolia News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an inauguration ceremony for the Natural Disasters
Search and Rescue Team, President Ahmet Necdet Sezer said it is not
possible to prevent natural disasters like earthquake and flood
from happening in Turkey, which suffers heavy human and property
losses due to frequent natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
However, "what is important is to be prepared against these
disasters and to take measures in time to minimize the disasters'
effects," he said.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has taken lessons from the two major earthquakes which
hit Turkey in August and November last year, said the president,
adding that "one of our biggest shortages in this field is the lack
of a well-trained, fully equipped, rescue team."
</P>
<P>
The Ankara-based team, equipped with the most advanced rescue
equipment, is capable of carrying out rescue operations in 18
different places, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Trained both at home and abroad, it is ready to provide first-
aid services around the clock and will also help train civil
defense organizations.

<HEADLINE> U.S. New-Home Sales Fall Sharply in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Sales of new homes in the United
States fell 5.8 percent in April to a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of 909,000 units, the largest fall in seven months, the
Commerce Department reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
April's decrease in new-homes sales, the biggest monthly
decline since a 7.2 percent decrease in September, suggests that
rising mortgage rates may finally be slowing the red-hot housing
market.
</P>
<P>
In other economic news, the government said that consumers
spent 5.26 billion U.S. dollars shopping in cyberspace during the
first quarter of this year out of total retail sales during the
period of 747.8 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
That means of every 100 dollars in retail sales rung up during
the January-March quarter, 70 cents was spent online, the Commerce
Department estimated.
</P>
<P>
The first-quarter figures on e-commerce represented an increase
of 1.2 percent from fourth-quarter online sales of 5.20 billion
dollars. The Commerce began three months ago issued quarterly
estimates of e-commerce activity in an effort to show the impact
the Internet is having on the American economy.
</P>
<P>
The 5.8 percent drop in new-home sales came on the heels of a
revised 5.8 percent jump in March sales, which had pushed the pace
to 965,000 homes, the second-highest level in history. In November
1998 sales hit an all-time high rate of 995,000 units.
</P>
<P>
Economists believe there will be increasing signs in coming
months that higher interest rates are starting to slow the economy.
Since last June, the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates
six times in an effort to raise borrowing costs enough to slow
consumer demand for big-ticket items like homes and autos and keep
overall inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
Influenced by the Fed's rate campaign, mortgage rates have been
rising, and 30-year mortgages now are at 8.62 percent, up more
than a full percentage point from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The decline in home sales was accompanied by a drop in the
median price of homes, which declined 2.2 percent to 161,400
dollars, the lowest level since last October. The median price,
the point at which half the homes sold for more and half for less,
had risen to 165,000 dollars in March.
</P>
<P>
The average home price continued to rise despite the drop in
April sales, climbing to 208,000 dollars, up 2.2 percent from 202,
300 dollars in March.
</P>
<P>
The national sales decline reflected weakness in all areas of
the country except the Northeast, where sales were actually up 8.6
percent to an annual rate of 88,000 homes in April.
</P>
<P>
Sales fell by 15.4 percent to an annual rate of 153,000 homes
in the Midwest. They were down 11.5 percent to an annual rate of
246,000 units in the West and were off a slight 0.7 percent to 422,
000 units in the South.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Leading Economic Index Dips in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The index of U.S. leading economic
indicators declined slightly in April, pointing to a continuation
of the economic expansion during 2000 but at a slower pace, the
Conference Board said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Board, a prominent research group, said in a report that
the leading index dropped 0.1 percent at 106.0 in April, following
a 0.1 percent increase in March and a 0.3 percent decline in
February. The index stood at 100 in 1996, its base year.
</P>
<P>
During the six-month span through April, the leading index rose
by 0.5 percent with six of the ten components advancing, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
"The biggest risk to the ongoing expansion, which in June will
be in its record 111th month, remains the interest-rate increase
at hand and the prospect of still more action by the Federal
Reserve Board," said Conference Board Economist Ken Goldstein. "
The data suggest that some sectors many be begging to respond to
Federal tightening."
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve has raised rates six times since last June
in an effort to cool off the U.S. economy and keep inflation at
bay.
</P>
<P>
The report said five of the ten indicators that make up the
leading index rose in April. The positive contributors to the
index were money supply, average weekly manufacturing hours,
vendor performance, stock prices and consumer expectation.
</P>
<P>
The largest negative contributors to the leading index in the
same month were manufacturers' new orders for consumer goods and
materials and the interest rate spread, it added.

<HEADLINE> Greek Government Appears Unwavering in ID Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The Greek government Wednesday
appeared unwavering in its recent decision to exclude religious
affiliation from new state-mandated identity cards.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas said that the implementation of the law on
personal data did not concern religion and the identity cards but
all the so-called sensitive personal data and public documents.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Greek government had made clear its decision
which was to implement a law that had been approved by the Greek
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The ID card furor erupted in earnest this month throughout the
predominately Orthodox nation of 11 million after a state-
appointed committee, the Authority for the Protection of Personal
Data, conveyed its opinion to the Greek Government-led by Prime
Minister Costas Simitis.
</P>
<P>
Describing the government decision on identity cards as "
authoritarian," Archbishop of Athens and All Greece Christodoulos
Wednesday accused the government of not respecting the agreement
for dialogue with the Church.

<HEADLINE> Report: Major Changes Needed for Africa to Prosper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Sub-Saharan Africa faces
enormous challenges but, under the right conditions, it could end
the cycle of missed opportunities and conflict that has marred its
prospects during the latter half of the 20th century, and spur
greater development results for many of its people, according to a
new report released Wednesday at the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The report, Can Africa Claims the 21st Century, said that while
war and discord have renewed doubts about Africa's future, a more
complex and encouraging reality is also unfolding.
</P>
<P>
It noted that where countries, such as Mozambique and Ghana,
have made key economic reforms, including liberalizing markets and
trade, improving economic management, and promoting private sector
activity, growth and personal incomes have risen and poverty has
been reduced.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere on the continent, there is also good news. Nigeria is
rebuilding its economy and political system after years of
hardship; private investment has picked up; and large projects,
such as the Maputo Transport Corridor between Mozambique and South
Africa, are offering some solutions to Africa's pressing
infrastructure needs.
</P>
<P>
In addition, more effective regulation in key sectors, such as
opening up West Africa's airspace to competition, will also help
to galvanize economic performance, the report said.
</P>
<P>
But Africa's challenges remain enormous. The study said that
despite progress since 1995, Africa enters the 21st century with
some of the world's poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
Average income per capita is lower than at the end of 1960s.
Incomes, assets, and access to essential services are unequally
distributed. The region's total income is not much more than
Belgium's. Excluding South Africa, the continent has fewer roads
than Poland. And HIV/AIDS is fast reversing some of the social
gains of the last 40 years. For example, two African countries now
have HIV infection rates in excess of 25 percent of the adult
population. They are Botswana (25.1 percent) and Zimbabwe (25.84
percent).
</P>
<P>
The report stressed that fundamental policy changes will be
required to improve Africa's prospects. With its rapidly growing
population, the region needs to grow by five percent a year just
to keep the number of poor from rising. If the percentage living
in dire poverty is to be halved by 2015, annual growth will have
to exceed seven percent and income must be distributed more
equitably.
</P>
<P>
The report said that decisive steps are needed to take in four
main areas: resolving conflict and improving governance to guide
political and economic development, greater equity and more
investment in Africa's people, increasing competitiveness and
diversifying economies, and better support from the international
development community.
</P>
<P>
"Although the challenges facing Africa may seem insurmountable,
the continent has enormous untapped potential and hidden growth
reserves," said Alan Gelb, chief economist for the World Bank's
Africa Region.
</P>
<P>
The study was jointly compiled by the African Development Bank,
the African Economic Research Consortium, the Global Coalition on
Africa, the United Nations Economic Commission on Africa and the
World Bank.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 31 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Vice President Al Gore
Wednesday called on insurance companies to treat the mentally ill
persons as equals and also cover mental health services for
children.
</P>
<P>
Gore said in a speech in Maryland State that schools will be
provided resources to diagnose and treat children with mental
disorders.
</P>
<P>
The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee noted that 51
million Americans faced mental disorders every year and only one
out of every six receive treatment.
</P>
<P>
"We have to make certain that mental illness is diagnosed,
discussed and treated openly in America. Mental illness is nothing
to be ashamed of but the stigma shames us all," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If I'm entrusted with the presidency, I will move this country
towards the day when mental illness is treated like every other
illness by every health plan," Gore said.
</P>
<P>
"If you stand with me in this election, I will give this issue
the priority it deserves," he added.
</P>
<P>
Gore, who appeared with his wife, proposed placing more mental
health professionals into schools and training teachers to
recognize warning signs early, when they could be better treated.

<HEADLINE> Peruvian Government Starts Diplomatic Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori's
government started Wednesday a diplomatic campaign to prevent
international banishment and convince the world of the legitimacy
of his reelection for a third presidential mandate.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Alberto Bustamante went to United States where
he spoke at an assembly called with urgency for Wednesday by the
Organization of American States Organization (OAS) Permanent
Council in Washington.
</P>
<P>
The assembly analyzed the report from Eduardo Stein, head of
the OAS observers mission, which withdrew from Peru, and said that
the electoral process of that country was vitiated with
irregularities.
</P>
<P>
Peruvian ambassador to the regional organization in Washington
Beatriz Ramacciotti presented a report about the elections and
repeated the position of her government that the electoral process
was clean and transparent.
</P>
<P>
The United States representative requested the assembly during
the same meeting to discuss the Peruvian case during the OAS
general annual assembly, that will be held Sunday in Canada,
attended by the foreign ministers of the continent.
</P>
<P>
Peruvian Foreign Minister Fernando de Trazegnies said that he
will go to Canada to answer to all the concerns of his colleagues
about the second electoral round of Sunday, May 28.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori was the only contestant for the runoff election after
the withdrawal of his  rival Alejandro Toledo, who had
conditioned his participation in the election to their
postponement for June.
</P>
<P>
De Trazegnies said that the foreign ministers of the neighbor
countries of Peru have stated their respect to the principle of no
intervention in the internal affairs of other countries.
</P>
<P>
The Peruvian Foreign Ministry has started contacts with the
governments of Ecuador, Cuba, Venezuela, and Mexico.

<HEADLINE> Edinburgh Drugs Link Broken By Customs Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The officers said that, in the last six month, they appeared to
have successfully fought off attempts by South African drug
couriers to use the airport as a soft target for supplying the
British market.
</P>
<P>
It was reported last year more than 150kg of the 200kg of
cannabis found being smuggled into Scotland came through Edinburgh
airport.
</P>
<P>
In the period from January to October alone, seizures of
cannabis at the airport surged by 600 percent, prompting fears
that it was becoming an important drugs route.
</P>
<P>
Customs and Excise said the recent drop suggests that gang
responsible for sending the couriers may have decided to look
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
But union officials complained there were now too few staff to
provide an effective barrier against smuggling and claimed the
customs service was "living on its past reputation".

Annan on Wednesday welcomed Israel's admission to a U.N. regional
group after being excluded for more than 40 years.
</P>
<P>
The West European and Others Group(WEOG) last Friday admitted
Israel as its temporary member, paving the way for Israel's
eventual election to key U.N. bodies.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by his spokesman's office, Annan said "I
was pleased to learn of the decision of the Western European and
Others Group to admit Israel as a temporary member."
</P>
<P>
"This step rectifies a long-standing anomaly. It should pave
the way for Israel to participate on an equal footing with other
nations in the main organs of the United Nations, and it upholds
the principle, enshrined in the Charter, of equality among all
Member States," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"This decision is particularly welcome at a time when all
people of goodwill are hoping for early and decisive progress in
the Middle East peace process," Annan added.
</P>
<P>
Israel is the only U.N. Member State which is barred from any
of the organization's five regional groups until WEOG admitted it
as its temporary member last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Israel's admission to WEOG is for an initial four years, after
which it will be subject to confirmation by the group's other
members.
</P>
<P>
WEOG includes the 15 members of the European Union, Australia,
New Zealand, Canada, Turkey and a number of other countries.

<HEADLINE> Schools Shake-up Proposals Include Large Pay Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Edinburgh, May 31 (Xinhua) - Plans for a major shake-up in
Scotland's schools were unveiled Wednesday, including a new class
of better-paid "super-teachers".
</P>
<P>
The proposals include big pay rises for all teachers and
changes in their contracts to create a more flexible profession.
</P>
<P>
The report by the independent McCrone committee, set up by
Scotland's coalition government to review teachers' pay and
conditions, is regarded here as the most far-reaching review of
teaching for a generation.
</P>
<P>
The McCrone report includes plans for a twin-track career
structure, which would mean the best classroom teachers earning
most.
</P>
<P>
The committee argues there should also be more money for
teachers who take on responsibilities outside the classroom.
</P>
<P>
However, it was given a cautious welcome by the leader of
Scotland's largest teaching union, the Educational Institute of
Scotland (EIS). Its general secretary Ronnie Smith said teachers
would decide in a ballot whether they were prepared to accept the
changes.
</P>
<P>
Scottish Education Minister Sam Galbraith said the EIS had
argued for a twin-track system for teachers. "We believe teachers
should be able to advance in their careers without necessarily
having to take on management responsibilities."
</P>
<P>
The report would require careful consideration before there
were any steps towards implementation, he said, adding he would be
carrying out a series of consultations over the summer with
employers, teachers and others.

<HEADLINE> Scotland's Companies Take Time Over Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
EDINBURGH, May 31 (Xinhua) - Scotland's leading listed
companies taken an average 34 days to pay their bills, and their
suppliers are suffering as a consequence, according to the figures
released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Federation of Small Business (FSB) revealed that the worst
late payer among plcs is Weir Group, the engineering and
construction company, which takes 61 days to settle up.
</P>
<P>
According to the figures, a fifth of all companies in the UK
take more than 60 days to pay. Among them 16 are named as taking
more than 200 days to settle up.
</P>
<P>
Eleven companies have exemplary records, taking one day to pay.
Companies in the financial services sector top the payment
efficiency poll, with 67 percent paying within the normally agreed
timescale of 30 days.
</P>
<P>
Jim Torrance, the FSB's Scottish conveyor, said: "The
publication of these tables for the first time last year put
pressure on companies, but I am disappointed only a third are
paying their bills within the normal agreed time."
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Weir Group blamed its poor performance on its
complicated network of operations that cover more than 100 plants
in 20 countries.
</P>
<P>
"We have reduced the 61 days quoted to 59 days and are aiming
to reduce it even further," he added.

<HEADLINE> FAO Seeks 30 Million U.S. Dollars in Emergency Aid to Horn of Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) Wednesday appealed for 32.6 million
U.S. dollars to bring urgently needed help to pastoralists,
farmers, and their families in Ethiopia, Eritrea, Somalia, Kenya
and Djibouti, U.N. officials said here.
</P>
<P>
Millions of people in the five countries of the Horn of Africa
are suffering from hunger and malnutrition as a consequence of
successive severe droughts. Pastoral areas in Ethiopia, northern
Kenya and Somalia have been particularly affected by the loss of
large of large numbers of livestock.
</P>
<P>
The situation has been aggravated by armed conflicts and
political and social instability, disrupting food production and
causing large numbers of refugees and the displacement of many
civilians.
</P>
<P>
"The support of the international community is urgently needed
to help farmers and their families in the Horn of Africa to
overcome the current food crisis and to stop the human tragedy,"
said Anne Bauer, chief of FAO's Special Relief Service at a donors
' meeting at the FAO headquarters in Rome.
</P>
<P>
"FAO's goal is to support crop planting and livestock
production so that agriculture can start to recover within the
next few months. However, a safe and secure environment is
urgently needed so that people can return to their homes and
fields and have access to emergency assistance and basic services
and to encourage donors to invest in recovery and development in
the region," she said.
</P>
<P>
In Ethiopia, more than 8 million people, or 13 percent of the
nation's total population, are in need of agricultural assistance,
FAO said. These farmers urgently require more than 8,000 tons of
seeds and 355,000 hand tools for the upcoming planting season, so
that they can start planting by mid-July at the latest.
</P>
<P>
Emergency supplies of about 7.9 million U.S. dollars will also
include small irrigation pumps and other agricultural inputs.
</P>
<P>
FAO estimates that up to three more cattle, calves and milking
cows have already died because of the current drought, in some
areas, up to 90 percent of the total. FAO has proposed an
emergency livestock program of about 2.5 million U.S. dollars for
emergency slaughter, disease surveillance, animal vaccines and
technical support.
</P>
<P>
In Eritrea, an estimated 367,000 people in the drought
affected areas are in need of assistance to restart their crop and
livestock production.
</P>
<P>
The 4.7-million-U.S. dollar appeal for Eritrea includes the
urgent provision of seeds, the reseeding of grazing lands to
produce hay, the development of watering points for livestock and
the provision of veterinary drugs.
</P>
<P>
In Somalia, about 750,000 people are suffering form rain and
crop failure, environmental degradation and armed conflicts.
Recent rains have slightly improved the overall situation, but
also led to flooding in some areas.
</P>
<P>
For the recovery of the agricultural sector around 5.6 million
U.S. dollars are required, mainly for seeds, and to provide
technical assistance to rehabilitate agriculture, fodder
production and veterinary assistance.
</P>
<P>
In Kenya, an estimated 103,000 farming households are in need
of agricultural assistance, mainly seeds and tools for the next
planting season starting in October. Large numbers of livestock
have also been seriously affected by the drought. FAO asked donors
to finance a 1.4 million U.S. dollars emergency program, of which
around 10.5 million U.S. dollars will be spent on emergency
assistance to recover livestock production.
</P>
<P>
In Djibouti, more than 575,000 U.S. dollars are needed for the
urgent delivery of seeds and assistance to the livestock sector,
FAO said.
</P>
<P>
The FAO appeal will be integrated into the joint U.N. Emergency
Appeal for the Drought in the Horn of Africa, t be published in
early June, the officials said.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Blasts Pan Am Flight in Split Second </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The explosive device that brought
down Pan Am Flight 103 in 1988 took a millionth of a second to
blow a hole in the fuselage of the aircraft, investigator told the
court on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Investigator Christopher Peel testified that the bomb was
inside a luggage container on the left side of the front of the
New York-bound aircraft, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Peel's testimony supported the prosecution's case that a
powerful explosion from inside a suitcase blasted apart the Boeing
747 jumbo killing 259 people on board and 11 others on the ground.
</P>
<P>
Though the defense team raised question regarding the exact
placement of the bomb, Peel, an aircraft expert from the British
Defense Evaluation and Research Agency, said that the bomb was in
the lower part of a luggage container and very close to the wall
of the container.
</P>
<P>
The fuselage of the aircraft was blown open a hole of 50
centimeters by 50 centimeters, Peel told the three Scottish judges.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution accused Libyans Abdel Basset al-Megrahi and Al-
Amin Khalifa Fahima of conspiracy to murder, murder and breaching
the international aircraft safety law.

to last up to a year and is being held in a Scottish court under
Scots Law at Camp Zeist in central Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
If found guilty, Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa
Fhimah would be sentenced to prison for life and serve their jail
term in Scotland.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Warns Land-Hungry People Against Illegal Farm Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Vice President Joseph
Msika Wednesday warned land-hungry people in the country not to
pay for stands now being illegally sold at occupied peri-urban
farms.
</P>
<P>
"The government is the only one that can give land, not the war
veterans or anyone else," Msika said, noting that "there will be a
planned shifting of people."
</P>
<P>
The vice president praised the war veterans for their
demonstration, adding: "But we are a sovereign state with a
government."
</P>
<P>
"It is not the war veterans who can give land to the people.
When land is given, there is planning involved," he said.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,000 white farms have been occupied by war veterans and
land- hungry communal people since February, this year and there
has been widespread illegal land sales at occupied farms around
Harare, the country' s capital.
</P>
<P>
The government gazetted amendments to the Land Acquisition Act,
allowing it to acquire farms without compensation. This is
expected to speed up the land resettlement program and end the
farm occupations.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Resettle Landless People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government is
identifying 841 farms which it plans to acquire soon for
resettlement, said Chairman of the National Land Acquisition
Committee Joseph Msika on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview at his office with the Zimbabwe News Agency,
Msika said the government would embark on what he described as "an
accelerated resettlement program" through which people qualifying
for resettlement would be settled simultaneously at the acquired
farms in all the provinces.
</P>
<P>
According to Msika, who is also Zimbabwean Vice President, the
legal framework gazetted last week has allowed the government to
acquire the 841 farms without any impediments.
</P>
<P>
Through the amendments of the Land Acquisition Act, the
government will only pay for improvements to the farms.
</P>
<P>
To speed up the resettlement program, Msika said, the
government would overlook infrastructural development and only
concentrate on essential services such as the provision of water
and graded roads, and the demarcation of the farms.
</P>
<P>
"We are now identifying the 841 farms province by province. Our
plan is to settle people simultaneously in all the provinces," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government is identifying war veterans, landless
and communal people who qualify for the resettlement program.
</P>
<P>
The people to be resettled would include people with master
farmer certificates, an aptitude for farming and war veterans, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Like in the past, he said, 20 percent of each of the resettled
farms would be allocated to war veterans.
</P>
<P>
He could not say how many people would be resettled on the 841
farms as the government is still working out the exact figures.
</P>
<P>
"What we are considering is the land carrying capacity. We have
to take into account its sustainability," he said, stressing that
"we will not ruin the land."
</P>
<P>
On the war veterans' demands that the resettlement should start
before the June 24 and 25 parliamentary elections, the vice
president could not specify the exact date when people would be
moved into the acquired farms.
</P>
<P>
He said they are still working out the timetable.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President Benjamin
Mkapa has underlined the importance of good road network in his
government's efforts to fasten the development of the country.
</P>
<P>
Opening a meeting of road stakeholders here on Wednesday, the
president said infrastructure, especially roads, is a critical
factor for the success of the next phase reforms focused on faster
economic growth and fighting poverty.
</P>
<P>
A good road network of trunk, regional and rural roads is one
of the most important attributes to the development of any
society, Mkapa stressed.
</P>
<P>
"A well-developed and reliable road network will also increase
the level and quality of services provided to our people, and
expand economic opportunities available to them," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said good roads will enable farmers to get their inputs on
time and at lower cost, transport their produce to urban market
faster and will also help bring the inflation down.
</P>
<P>
In urban area, said Mkapa, good roads will encourage tourism
growth, create employment and facilitate the provision of social
services.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's national road network is far from being established.
As a country with a land area of 886,040 square kilometers,
Tanzania has 88,200 kilometers of highways, among which more than
84,000 kilometers are unpaved roads.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Britain looks forward to returning
of calm and constructive dialogue with Zimbabwe, British High
Commissioner (ambassador) Peter Longworth said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Zimbabwe and the United Kingdom have been traders for a long
time," he said. "I hope it will not be long before we get back to
the situation where the bulk of our effort is directed at building
up volumes and quality of our two-way trade."
</P>
<P>
Longworth made the remark at the launch of "Trade Partners
U.K." aimed at encouraging more British firms to develop an
international dimension to their business by developing new
opportunities in overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
He said that Britain, which was Zimbabwe's second largest
trading partner, would continue to buy beef, tobacco, minerals and
horticultural products.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, he said, was buying a wide range of goods from UK
including heavy machinery and chemicals.
</P>
<P>
He said it was no secret that Zimbabwe's economy was going
through hard times and the UK and other trading partners had
noticed this in the disappointing performance of their exports.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Zimbabwe and Britain have soured over the
stance taken by Zimbabwe to compulsorily acquire white-owned land
for resettlement of landless blacks which has been described by
the British as the "land grab".

<HEADLINE> Israel Provides Lebanon Minefield Maps to UNIFIL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The Israel Defense Forces (IDF)
have provided the peacekeeping United Nations Interim Forces in
Lebanon (UNIFIL) with maps of its minefields in the former
occupation zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The map transfer was ordered by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak shortly after Israel completed its redeployment along the
international border with Lebanon last week, a statement issued by
Barak's office said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This move will make the UNIFIL's tasks easier and safer to
remove mines in these fields, laid by Israel since it set up the
buffer zone in 1985 with a self-claimed aim to protect its north
from cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Israeli cabinet approved the withdrawal in March and IDF carried
it out hastily in nearly 24 hours last week after South Lebanon
Army, the pro-Israeli militia, collapsed quickly under the pressure
of Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Israel is awaiting the United Nations' formal verification of
the withdrawal, a precondition it wanted to be met before it can
launch reprisal attacks against any future guerrilla attacks along
the border.
</P>
<P>
U.N. technical experts are continuing their work delineating the
boundary along the border line marked by the British and the French
colonial mandate in 1923, which has been generally accepted as the
international border between Israel and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Only when the cartographers have finished their works can the U.
N declare Israel's withdrawal in compliance with U.N. Security
Council resolutions 425 and 426.
</P>
<P>
Resolutions 425, adopted in 1978 after Israel's first invasion,
demanded an immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Israeli
troops from Lebanon. But only until last year did Israel agreed to
comply with the resolution, as it was considering a pullout amid
mounting casualties in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israeli television reported Tuesday that U.N. special envoy
Terje Roed-Larsen and Danny Yatom, Barak's security adviser and
confidant, had agreed in a meeting on the placement of the entire
border. However, the report had not got confirmation from Barak's
office.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Qatar on Wednesday urged Israel
to fully withdraw from all Lebanese territories, including the
disputed Shebaa Farms.
</P>
<P>
The Qatari cabinet at a session called on Israel to
unconditionally implement U.N. Security Council Resolution 425
adopted in 1978 after Israel's first invasion, which calls for an
immediate and unconditional Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel pulled out its troops from south Lebanon a week ago,
ending 22 years of occupation. But it refused to withdraw from the
Shebaa Farms, saying that the area belongs to Syria, not Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
But both Lebanon and Syria claimed that the fertile farms,
located at the western foothills of the Mount Hermon now under
Israeli occupation, is Lebanon's.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Qatari cabinet called for a resumption of
negotiations on all tracks in order to achieve a full and
comprehensive peace in the Middle East region, Kuwait News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Qatar's Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa Al-Thani has also pledged
to donate 7 million U.S. dollars for the rebuilding of south
Lebanon following the Israeli retreat.

<P>
Israel accelerated its troop pullout in face of the swift
collapse of its proxy militia, the South Lebanon Army, under
pressure from resistance guerrillas, and complete the task a week
ago, bringing its 22-year occupation to a hasty end.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Minister: Shas Not to Trade Votes with Pardon for Deri </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Health Minister Shlomo
Benizri Wednesday refuted a report that the ultra-Orthodox Shas
Party will vote for the presidential candidate who will grant a
pardon to its former leader Aryeh Deri convicted for financial
fraud.
</P>
<P>
Benizri, also from Shas, said the pardon demand came from one of
Rabbi Yitzhak Kadourie's aids, not from the Shas party itself.
</P>
<P>
Deri, former leader of Shas, has been sentenced to four years in
prison for financial fraud and is now waiting for a supreme court
decision on his appeal.
</P>
<P>
Benizri said Shas is now considering which candidate to support,
but this has nothing to do with pardon for Deri. He said Shas's
spiritual leader Rabbi Ovadia Yosef may tell its Knesset
(parliament) members to vote as they please.
</P>
<P>
Shas, the largest parliamentary grouping after Labor and the
opposition Likud, is believed to hold the key to who will win when
the secret ballot casting for a new Israeli president is held on
July 31. So far, Shas has refrained from officially announcing who
it will support.
</P>
<P>
The race for Israel's eighth president is now underway between
Regional Cooperation Minister Shimon Peres, candidate named by the
Labor-led One Israel, and Likud's candidate Moshe Kotsav.
</P>
<P>
Surveys show that Peres, now a cabinet minister in power and an
internationally known figure, takes lead over Kotsav, Knesset
member and former tourism minister.
</P>
<P>
Despite the reassuring findings, Peres is still concerned about
Shas's vote in the secret ballot casting. Analysts here observe
that although he has a good relationship with Rabbi Yosef, Shas
will hard-pressed to vote against Katsav, who like Shas supporters,
is a Sephardic Jew with origins in the Arab world and more
observant of Jewish law than Peres is.
</P>
<P>
Katsav's camp is fully aware that if Shas does not officially
back the Likud candidate, Katsav has no chance of winning. Peres,
on the other hand, might win without Shas.
</P>
<P>
There have been speculations that Shas may take advantage of the
election to ask for prices. The demand of a pardon for Deri might
be one of them.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the speculation, Deri said on Tuesday that he does
not want a pardon from the would-be president, because he believed
the good decision would be in the court, not in the president.
</P>
<P>
Benizri said most of the Shas Knesset members will vote for one
candidate and will not divide their votes. He noted that while the
legislators can prefer to vote the one closer to Shas, it does not
necessarily mean they will vote Katsav, because Peres has been very
close to Shas and to Rabbi Yosef.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Cabinet Minister Haim Ramon, the manager for
Peres' campaign, said he expects Shas Leader Yosef only to make a
decision close to the July 31 election date. He hoped Yosef's
admiration for Peres will influence his decision to back Peres.
</P>
<P>
President Ezer Weizman, 76, Sunday announced his decision to
resign on July 10 following attorney general's report on his gift-
taking scandal, three years before the end of his term.
</P>
<P>
The 120-member Israeli parliament will elect a new president on
July 31. On the following day, the new president will be sworn in.

<HEADLINE> Iran Rejects Allegations of Arms Transfer to Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Hamid Reza Asefi on Wednesday categorically rejected Israeli
allegations regarding arms shipment from Iran to Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He said the great victory of the Lebanese resistance should be a
lesson for the Israeli government, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Following the victory of the Lebanese people in defeating the
Israeli force, Iran and other Muslim countries are ready to assist
Lebanon with its reconstruction, he added.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy said Tuesday Iran is
continuing to send arms to the Iran-backed Hezbollah guerrillas
which led the Lebanese resistance against the 22-year Israeli
occupation of southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In an unexpected move, Israeli troops completed their withdrawal
from south Lebanon last week, which Iran termed as a victory for
the Islamic resistance in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Iran has refused to recognize Israel since the 1979 Islamic
revolution and openly supported armed struggle against Israeli
occupation of Islamic and Arab lands.

<HEADLINE> Syria Accepts Israeli Lebanon Withdrawal: U.N. Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Syria has fully accepted Israel's
withdrawal from south Lebanon, without demanding Israel pull out
from the disputed Shebaa Farms, said U.N. special envoy to the
Middle East Terje Roed-Larsen here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Larsen said in a statement that Syria and the United Nations
agreed "on every matter" related to the pullout, which was hastily
completed last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Syria did not require the withdrawal include the Shebaa Farms,
the envoy told reporters after meeting with Syrian Foreign Minister
Faruk Shareh.
</P>
<P>
Larsen said that during the talks Shareh had informed him that
Syria accepts fully U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's report to
the U.N. Security Council on May 22 "which also defines the lines
for the purpose of confirming the withdrawal."
</P>
<P>
In a written report to the Security Council Annan recommended
the Shebaa Farms be dealt with as part of the area patrolled by a
U.N.force monitoring a 1974 Israel-Syrian ceasefire and not as
coming under the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), formed in
1978.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon refused to deploy government troops in south Lebanon
vacated by Israel until the U.N. has verified that the Israeli
withdrawal was complete.
</P>
<P>
Last week Shareh told a press conference in Lisbon, Portugal,
that an Israeli withdrawal should include the Shebaa Farms, an area
both Lebanon and Syria claimed as Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
However, Israel said the area is part of the Golan Heights it
captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war, whose fate should
be decided during the peace talks with Syria after they resume.
</P>
<P>
Larsen arrived here from south Lebanon Wednesday morning for a
brief visit to Syria, the major power broker in Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Duma Approves Putin's Bill on Reforming Upper House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The Russian State Duma on Wednesday
overwhelmingly approved a bill tabled by President Vladimir Putin
on reforming the country's upper house, the Federation Council.
</P>
<P>
The measure cleared the lower house of parliament by a vote of
362-34 with eight abstentions in the first reading, the Interfax
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Putin expressed "full satisfaction" with the approval.
</P>
<P>
The development represents another victory for Putin, who has
moved to strengthen his reign over the regions since his
inauguration earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
The State Duma has also passed a separate bill handing the
president the power to remove regional governors and disband
regional legislatures. It was approved by a vote of 357-28.
</P>
<P>
In a televised address to the nation on May 17, Putin said the
package of bills were intended to "strengthen and cement the
Russian statehood."
</P>
<P>
Under the new measures, the regional leaders would concentrate
on their work in the regions, and their representatives, instead
of themselves, would start making laws in the Federation Council
on Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the month, Putin carved the country into seven
districts, each with its own presidential representative.
</P>
<P>
The new representatives would replace those who work in 80 of
the 89 regions in accordance with a 1997 presidential decree
signed by Putin's predecessor, Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
The new envoys are to report directly to Putin and are charged
with"guaranteeing the realization of the constitutional powers of
the head of state within the limit of the... federal district."

<HEADLINE> Grand Funeral Held in Honor of Canada's Hockey Hero </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- A grand funeral is being held
Wednesday morning in Montreal in honor of Canada's hockey hero
Maurice Richard, known as "Rocket" among hockey fans throughout
the country.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien and Quebec Premier Lucien
Bouchard are among hundreds of mourners at the funeral being
staged in the Notre-Dame Basilica.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of other people are gathering outside to say good-bye
to Richard, whose prodigious talents thrilled hockey fans for 18
years. He was seen to win his last Stanley Cup in 1960.
</P>
<P>
Remembering Richard has consumed Montreal and the rest of the
country since the 78-year-old national hero died Saturday in
hospital after a long battle with abdominal cancer and Parkinson's
disease.
</P>
<P>
In North America, players and 19,000 fans paid a brief tribute
to the Rocket's memory prior to Tuesday's start of the Stanley Cup
final series between the Dallas Stars and the New Jersey Devils.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Urged to Change Policy Toward Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Greece's Undersecretary of Defense
Dimitris Apostolakis Wednesday urged neighboring Turkey to change
its policy toward Athens.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 2nd Greek-British defense industries conference
in Athens, Apostolakis said that the Turkish leadership must
understand that there was a need to draw up a different policy
toward Greece, and that would be firm and lasting in harmony with
international law and the existing treaties binding all sides.
</P>
<P>
He stated that Greece would continue to have a need for strong
and reliable deterrent force.
</P>
<P>
For decades, Greece and Turkey, both NATO members, have been
at odds over their disputes in the territorial waters, air space
limits and the delimitation of the continental shelf in the Aegean
Sea, and the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
The two long-time rivals have since last June begun to improve
their strained relations with the holding of several rounds of low-
level talks and the signing of a number of bilateral cooperation
pacts, but Greece has complained that Turkey has not done enough
in its efforts to better the bilateral relations between the two
countries.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Releases Most Recent Statistics on World's Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations on
Wednesday released The World's Women 2000: Trends and Statistics,
the most recent statistics on world's women.
</P>
<P>
The report is a one-of-a-kind compilation of the latest data
documenting progress for women worldwide in six areas: health,
human rights and political decision-making, work, education and
communication, population, and families.
</P>
<P>
The report, produced by the United Nations Statistics Division,
becomes public just prior to a special session of the United
Nations General Assembly to review progress governments have made
in improving women's lives since the Fourth World Conference on
Women in Beijing in 1995 and to agree on future priority actions
for women.
</P>
<P>
"This report attempts to answer the urgent but complex
questions of what real progress are the world's women making in
their lives," said Nitin Desai, Under-Secretary-General for
Economic and Social Affairs.
</P>
<P>
"Available data show that women are making gains, but
persistent disparities exist between women and men. We can see
that the gender gap in enrollment in primary and secondary levels
of schooling is closing, but it is unlikely this gap will be
closed by the target date of 2005," Desai said.
</P>
<P>
"While the gender gap in rates of economic activity is
narrowing, women still must reconcile their family
responsibilities with employment outside the home," Desai said.
</P>
<P>
"Recent declines in early marriage and early childbearing in
most regions show real change in the quality of women's lives, but
in 3 of 5 countries in Southern Asia and 11 of 30 countries in sub-
Saharan Africa, at least 30 percent of young women aged 15 to 19
have been married," Desai added.
</P>
<P>
Citing progress in collecting gender statistics, the report
also stresses that new data is needed on issues unique to women
such as violence against women and maternal health.
</P>
<P>
The World's Women 2000 is the third in a series of reports that
has broken new ground. The first, issued in 1991, was a direct
response to a rising demand by wide range of users for data on
women.
</P>
<P>
The field continued to evolve with a second edition in 1995 and
now the current edition that looks at the status of women through
the lens of statistical data and analysis.

<HEADLINE> Highlights, Important Findings in The World's Women 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations on
Wednesday released a report The World's Women 2000: Trends and
Statistics, a one-of-a-kind compilation of the latest data
documenting progress for women worldwide in six areas.
</P>
<P>
Following are the highlights and important findings of the
report:
</P>
<P>
HEALTH
</P>
<P>
-- There are continuing differences in lifetime risk of
maternal mortality between developed and developing countries. An
African women's lifetime risk of dying from pregnancy-related
causes is one in 16; in Asia, one in 65; and in Europe, one in 1,
400.
</P>
<P>
-- Women now account for almost half of all cases of HIV/AIDS,
and in countries with high HIV prevalence, young women are at
higher risk of contracting HIV than young men.
</P>
<P>
-- Life expectancy continues to increase for women and men in
most developing regions but has decreased dramatically in Southern
Africa as a result of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
WORK
</P>
<P>
--Women now comprise an increasing share of the world's labor
force, at least one third in all regions except in northern Africa
and western Asia.
</P>
<P>
-- Self-employment and part-time and home-based work have
expanded opportunities for women's participation in the labor
force but are characterized by lack of security, lack of benefits
and low income.
</P>
<P>
-- More women than before are in the labor force throughout
their productive years, though obstacles to combining family
responsibilities with employment persist.
</P>
<P>
HUMAN RIGHTS AND POLITICAL DECISION-MAKING
</P>
<P>
-- Physical and sexual abuse affect millions of girls and women
worldwide, yet are known to be seriously under-reported.
</P>
<P>
-- In some African countries, more than half of all women and
girls have undergone female genital mutilation and its prevalence
is not declining.
</P>
<P>
-- Women and girls comprise half of the world's refugees and, as
refugees, are particularly vulnerable to sexual violence while in
flight, in refugee camps and/or during resettlement.
</P>
<P>
-- Despite calls for gender and equality, women are
significantly under-represented in Governments, political parties
and at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION AND COMMUNICATION
</P>
<P>
-- The gender gap in primary and secondary schooling is closing,
but women still lag behind men in some countries in Africa and
Southern Asia.
</P>
<P>
-- Two thirds of the world's 876 million illiterate are women,
and the number of illiterates is not expected to decrease
significantly in the next twenty years.
</P>
<P>
-- More women than men lack the basic literacy and computer
skills needed to enter "new media" professions.
</P>
<P>
WOMEN AND MEN IN FAMILY
</P>
<P>
-- Women are generally marrying later but more than a quarter of
women aged 15 to 19 are married in 22 countries, all in developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
Informal unions are common in developed regions and in some
countries of the developing regions.
</P>
<P>
POPULATION
</P>
<P>
-- Women are having fewer children on average but with more
women of reproductive age, world population continues to grow.
</P>
<P>
-- Women represent a large proportion of international migrants,
an estimated 56 million women out of a total of 118 million
migrants.

<HEADLINE> 7th E. Coli Death Confirmed, 2 More Being Probed in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The killer E. coli disease has
raised the death toll to seven in Canada's southern Ontario town
of Walkerton, with two additional reported deaths being
investigated, the local London Health Sciences Censer said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The latest victims included an elderly and an unidentified
adult.
</P>
<P>
Another elderly patient at the Walkerton hospital is in a
critical condition with only palliative care while three of the 10
children remain in danger of life at the London Health Sciences
Center.
</P>
<P>
Up to 1,000 people in the small town of nearly 5,000 have been
stricken with diarrhea, nausea, headaches and fever in the worst
outbreak of E. coli 0-157.
</P>
<P>
Although health officials say the outbreak has passed its peak,
they expect it to take four weeks to have a conclusion of the
death toll.
</P>
<P>
The town's water supply is reported to be contaminated after a
rainstorm flooded the area. Angry locals are saying that they were
informed of the contamination too late. They accused local
utilities officials of failing to report the problem as soon as it
was first found.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Convicts Turkish Man for Drug Trafficking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- A Bulgarian court Wednesday sentenced
a Turkish national to eight years in prison plus a fine for
smuggling 51 kilograms of heroin into the country, local media
reported.
</P>
<P>
Ismet Akasu, a 49-year-old Istanbul resident, was found guilty
by the District Court of Rousse. It was established that Akasu
smuggled the drugs into Bulgaria via the Kapitan Andreevo
Checkpoint on the Turkish border and transported them across the
country in an attempt to smuggle them out via the Danube Bridge
Checkpoint near Rousse.
</P>
<P>
The shipment, which consisted of 59 packs of heroin, was found
in December 1999 inside a spare tire of Akasu's truck, which was
intercepted in Rousse.

<HEADLINE> Syrian FM, U.N. Envoy Hold Talks in Damascus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister Faruk
Shareh held talks here Wednesday with visiting U.N. special envoy
to the Middle East Terje Roed-Larsen.
</P>
<P>
The talks focused on the details of the Israeli troop withdrawal
from south Lebanon last Wednesday and those related to the
controversial Shebaa Farms within the implementation of U.N.
Security Council resolution 425 of 1978, according to sources close
to Larsen.
</P>
<P>
Both Lebanon and Syria claimed that the fertile Shebaa Farms,
located at the western foothills of the Mount Hermon now under
Israeli occupation, belong to Lebanon and Israel should withdraw
its troops from the area.
</P>
<P>
However, Israel said the area is part of the Golan Heights it
captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war, whose fate should
be
decided during the peace talks with Syria after they resume.
</P>
<P>
The two also discussed the guarantees demanded by the U.N. for
international peacekeepers to be deployed in south Lebanon in the
wake of the withdrawal, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
Larsen arrived here from south Lebanon Wednesday morning for a
brief visit to Syria, the major power broker in Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> France Distances Itself From Proposed European Federalism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 31 (Xinhua) -- France is distancing itself from the
German proposal to build a European federation after the proposal
triggered a debate in French political circles and the media.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said on Wednesday that
the German proposal, made on May 12 by Foreign Minister Joschka
Fischer, remains vague and leaves many questions up in the air.
</P>
<P>
"If we create a hard core, a federation of nation states, how
do we draw up the list of countries which are part of it? What
will be the relations between those which are part of it and those
which are not?" he asked in a debate at the French Senate.
</P>
<P>
"What competencies would remain at the level of nation states
and what others would be transferred to the federal level? When
should the federation have a French president and a German
chancellor?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine said France will not take the debate on European
federalism as one of the issues on top of the agenda during its
rotating presidency of the European Union which starts on July 1.
</P>
<P>
President Jacques Chirac said on Tuesday that the political
ambition of Europe exists in the present process of European
integration and its future progress should come out of the "
emerging of a common sentiment of belonging" rather than imposing
an abstract idea.
</P>
<P>
French Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement, who, in
response to Fischer's proposal, accused Germany of being not cured
of Nazism and dreaming of another Holy Roman-Germanic Empire, said
on Tuesday he had accepted an invitation from Fischer to a
television debate on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Fischer proposed that Europe build a federal-style structure
with a directly elected executive, a European Constitution and a
two-chamber parliament based on the model of the German parliament.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said on Tuesday in Berlin that he found Chevenement's
attack "intriguing" and invited him to a television debate.

<HEADLINE> Japanese PM Vows to Forge Better Ties With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori
Wednesday committed himself to the further development of
relations with China.
</P>
<P>
The Japan-China relationship is one of the most important
bilateral relationships for both countries, Mori said during a
meeting with Huang Ju, a member of the Politburo of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC).
</P>
<P>
Through the exchange of visits by Chinese President Jiang Zemin
and late Japanese prime minister Keizo Obuchi, leaders of the two
countries have constantly exchanged views and as a result,
bilateral ties are entering their best development period, said
Mori.
</P>
<P>
He expressed confidence that the 21st century will see a firmer
and better Japan-China relationship.
</P>
<P>
Mori also thanked Jiang for his meetings with leaders of the
three parties of the Japanese ruling coalition, who just visited
Beijing, and said he is looking forward to Chinese Premier Zhu
Rongji's visit to Japan this fall.
</P>
<P>
Huang said that the successful exchange of visits by leaders of
the two countries at the turning point of the century helped
define the direction of bilateral ties and give fresh impetus to
their development.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have also drawn up a comprehensive plan and
specified long-term objectives for future bilateral cooperation on
the basic principle of "looking into the future while drawing
lessons from the past," Huang added.
</P>
<P>
Huang, who heads a CPC delegation, arrived here on Monday for a
six-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Since his arrival, Huang, also CPC secretary in Shanghai, has
met Japanese Foreign Minister Yohei Kono, Finance Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa, as well as some leaders of Japan's ruling and opposition
parties.

<HEADLINE> Commentary Unveils Evil Deeds of Dalai Lama </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Today's "Tibet Daily" carried a
commentary titled "Unveiling the Real Face of Dalai Lama," using a
great number of facts to prove how Dalai Lama has thwarted human
rights and prevented the development of Tibet during his rule in
the region.
</P>
<P>
The commentary denounced Dalai Lama's activities during his 40-
year exile, and said that Dalai has attempted to restore feudal
serfdom by means of betraying the national interest and that of
the people. By so doing, he has become a tool of Western anti-
China forces, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
The commentary pointed out that during his rule in Tibet, Dalai
Lama adopted feudal serfdom combining political and religious
powers. Such a system, with the monks and nobles as dictators, is
the most gloomy, cruel, and uncultured in the history of mankind.
</P>
<P>
The commentary continued that serf owners in old Tibet, which
accounted for 5 percent of the total population, not only
possessed all the productive resources such as the land, pastures,
and domestic animals, but also controlled all the serfs. Serfs
became "speaking tools" and could be sold and transferred
optionally. At the same time, they were usually cruelly tortured
or killed by the serf owners.
</P>
<P>
The commentary also unveiled the evil deeds of Dalai Lama and
his followers during their armed insurgence in 1959 which aimed to
protect feudal serfdom. Their evil deeds include splitting the
motherland, butchering Tibetan people, looting temples, and raping
women.
</P>
<P>
They killed a nine-year-old boy Samni, for example, cutting
open his belly and eating his heart. Then, they cut the boy into
small pieces and had him hung from a tree.
</P>
<P>
The commentary stressed that where there are separatist
activities, there are conflicts and the basic human rights of the
local people are threatened.
</P>
<P>
Dalai Lama has continued his separatist activities in foreign
countries and has never done a good deed for the people of Tibet.
Indeed, he has attempted to thwart the World Bank and developed
countries from providing funds to Tibet.
</P>
<P>
The commentary concluded that facts have fully proved that
Dalai Lama is the general commissary of the feudal serf owners,
head of overseas separatist forces, a tool of western anti-China
forces and the arch criminal who splits the motherland, betrays
the national interest and the Tibetan people.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Rejects to Declare Ceasefire in Mindanao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
rejected Wednesday to declare a unilateral ceasefire and allow 40
days of tranquillity in Mindanao, saying he will not allow Muslim
rebels take advantage of the situation.
</P>
<P>
According to Press Secretary and Presidential Spokesman Ricardo
Puno, the president made this clear to a multi-sectoral group that
met with him in the Presidential Palace.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said the measures undertaken by the government to
uphold the constitution would result in a genuine peace for
Mindanao and would prevent the separatist Moro Islamic Liberation
Front (MILF) to regroup in the future.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting, representatives of a multi-sectoral group
urged the president to unilaterally order a ceasefire and allow 40
days of tranquillity in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Puno said they sought a suspension of hostilities during this
40-day period, so they can bury the dead, carry the wounded,
harvest crops and salvage belongings.
</P>
<P>
The period, they added, would allow non-government
organizations to monitor the situation in the areas of conflict
and hold multi-faith dialogues.
</P>
<P>
Puno said the president told the group that the government will
be able to achieve its military objective in "a couple of days"
and this is to disable the rebel groups from regrouping and
harassing people.
</P>
<P>
Estrada also pointed out that the peace process with the MILF
has begun, with the first day of meeting successfully held on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"What the president would like to do is to assure the people
that the peace process will result in a genuine peace but he would
deny the rebels the capability of mounting armed attacks from the
satellite camps around Camp Abubakar," Puno said.
</P>
<P>
According to Armed Forces spokesman Rafael Romero, 24 camps of
the MILF had been overrun by the military since January this year.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Puno said chief government negotiator
Robert Aventajado is confident he can secure the safe release of
21 persons held hostage in Sulu province after they were abducted
from Malaysia on April 23.
</P>
<P>
He said Aventajado expects talks to continue when he returns
Thursday to Sulu. "He is still optimistic some resolution can be
obtained and that discussions will continue," Puno said.

<HEADLINE> Fiji Military Drops Plans for Civilian Govt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Fiji's military leaders Wednesday
dropped plans to set up a civilian interim government and said it
was possible the army may run the country better, the Australian
Associated Press (AAP) said.
</P>
<P>
Just hours after naming a civilian to take over as interim
prime minister, military leaders suddenly withdrew the nomination
of former diplomat Ratu Epeli Nailatikau, the AAP said.
</P>
<P>
The head of the interim military government, army Chief Frank
Bainimarama, was quoted as saying the country was not yet ready
for a civilian administration to take over.
</P>
<P>
Bainimarama Wednesday named Ratu Epeli as interim prime
minister and warned democracy may not return to Fiji for up to
three years.
</P>
<P>
But later in the day the military leader said he had deferred
the naming of an interim government until Fiji's political
situation had stabilized to the point where it could do its job of
rewriting the constitution and paving the way for new elections.
</P>
<P>
"The interim military government will be in place until it has
achieved its task in the release of all hostages at the parliament
complex and the return of all arms to the army," Bainimarama said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Military spokesman Filipo Tarakinikini confirmed Ratu Epeli
Nailatikau would not take up the prime ministerial post but, as a
former army commander, would sit on the military council, the AAP
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the decision to step back from a civilian interim
government was taken because the public service, judiciary and
police were all running smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Even after the hostage crisis was settled, the military council
would consider whether to continue or hand over to a civilian
administration, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We will have to review the whole situation," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We may run a much more efficient administration with the
military," Tarakinikini said.
</P>
<P>
He said negotiations with Speight's supporters Wednesday "went
well" and would continue Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Asked at a new conference on Wednesday when democracy would
return to Fiji, Bainimarama said: "As soon as we come up with a
new constitution."
</P>
<P>
"That could take three years," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also ruled out Chaudhry regaining the leadership.
</P>
<P>
"I am afraid Mahendra Chaudhry will no longer come back as
prime minister," Bainimarama said.
</P>
<P>
Bainimarama assumed power and declared martial law in Fiji on
last Monday in an attempt to solve the crisis caused by the taking
hostage of former prime minister Mahendra Chaudhry and his
government on May 19.
</P>
<P>
The military is negotiating with supporters of armed coup
leader George Speight to win the release of Chaudhry and more than
30 MPs, being held at Suva's parliament house.
</P>
<P>
Bainimarama has revoked Fiji's 1997, multi-racial constitution
and set up a military council to run the country.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading U.S. Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Kicking off what aides describe as a week of positive, more
personal messages, Vice President Al Gore Tuesday accepted his
first endorsement from a national environmental group and all but
ignored George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
-- Boris Bezovsky, the influential tycoon who helped bring
Russian President Vladimir Putin to power, broke ranks with him
Tuesday, sharply criticizing Putin's attempt to rein in the
regional governors as an erosion of Russia's democracy.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Mariano Faget, 54, an acting deputy director of the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service with 34 years of service in
Miami, was convicted of disclosing official secrets, making
personal use of those secrets and lying to federal investigators
about his foreign business ties and meetings with a Cuban diplomat.
</P>
<P>
-- Hezbollah has started to operate in southern Lebanon much as
it does elsewhere, as a kind of parallel government offering
social services, development loans and reconstruction aid,
following the Israeli pullout.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal
</P>
<P>
-- The Nasdaq composite soared a record 7.94 percent, or 254.37
points, to 3459.48, on widening hopes that the economy is headed
for a soft landing and that the Federal Reserve soon will stop
raising interest rates. Many investors, however, are skeptical the
rally will last, partly because volume remains weaker than normal.
The Dow Jones industrial also climbed, rising 227.89, or 2.21
percent, to 10527.13.
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton arrived in Portual for the start
of a week-long European trip that will include talks with EU and
Russian leaders. The president is also to confer with Israel's
prime minister in Berlin Thursday.

<HEADLINE> OECD Asian Roundtable Focuses on Disclosure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD)'s Second Asian Roundtable on
Corporate Governance opened here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The theme of the Roundtable, attended by over 120 delegates
from many economies in Asia as well as international and regional
bodies such as the OECD, the World Bank and the Asian Development
Bank, is disclosure, said Rafael Hui, Acting Financial Secretary
of Hong Kong, in an opening address.
</P>
<P>
"Disclosure is the most basic of corporate governance
principles because potential investors and shareholders must be
given sufficient information to make informed decisions about
their shareholdings and safeguard their interest in any given
company," Hui said.
</P>
<P>
"At the very least, one can say that better disclosure would
have allowed both governments and companies to react to underlying
economic problems in a more timely manner. Disclosure therefore is
a critically important element in the management of any modern
economy," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Roundtable meetings in the next two and a half days will
look at three important aspects of disclosure -- the role of the
board of directors in overseeing disclosure, accounting and audit
and non-financial disclosure such as related parties, ownership
structures and government policies, according to Hui.
</P>
<P>
Hui pointed out that while a number of factors were responsible
for causing the Asia economic downturn, it is now widely
recognized that the absence of or inadequacy in corporate
governance systems, particularly regarding corporate
accountability and transparency, had actually exacerbated the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
He reminded people not to forget the need for corporate
governance reform today, when the recovery of many Asian economies
is steadily underway,
</P>
<P>
The First Asian Roundtable organized by the OECD was held in
Seoul in March 1999.

<HEADLINE> China Loosens Restrictions on Overseas Investment in Mineral Exploration: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- China has recently loosened its
restrictions on overseas investment in mineral exploration.
</P>
<P>
It is now possible for solely-funded foreign companies to
conduct mineral explorations in China and geological surveys, a
Chinese official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Previously, foreign investors must seek one or more Chinese
partners with survey qualifications and mining rights to set up a
joint venture.
</P>
<P>
Zhong Weizhi, director of Geological Exploration Department
with the Ministry of Land and Resources, said that loosening
restrictions will allow more foreign investment in mineral
exploration in China.
</P>
<P>
To facilitate overseas investment in mineral exploration in
China, the ministry will also improve and streamline evaluation
and approving procedures.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry started a pilot program late last year by
delegating its power to a provincial government, authorizing the
land and resources administration in southwest China's Yunnan
Province to review, approve, register and issue licenses to
foreign companies that invest in exploration and mining activities
excluding petroleum, natural gas and radioactive minerals.
</P>
<P>
The official said the pilot program may extend to other areas
in western China, abundant in mineral resources.

<HEADLINE> More Favorable Policies to Woo Foreign Investment in Mineral Exploration: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- China will formulate and issue more
preferential policies to encourage foreign investment in mineral
exploration, a Chinese official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Zhong Weizhi, Director of Geological Exploration Department
with the Ministry of Land and Resources, said six ministries with
the central government have reached a consensus on the policy.
</P>
<P>
The director said his ministry is still formulating
preferential regulations for those investing in western China or
remote and poor inland border areas.
</P>
<P>
Mining industries in western China have become a pillar
industry in the vast region, abundant in mineral resources,
accounting for 18 percent of the regional gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
China has recently issued a number of preferential policies to
encourage foreign investment in mineral exploration in China.
</P>
<P>
Previously, foreign investors had to seek Chinese partners with
survey qualifications and mining rights to set up a joint venture
to obtain the rights of exploration in China and to conduct
geological surveys.
</P>
<P>
Western China is rich in mineral resources, including oil,
natural gas and coal.

<HEADLINE> Study Shows Smoking Causes Heavy Costs in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Tobacco-related deaths, loss of
laborers and medical expenditure have led to heavy social and
economic costs to China, the world's biggest tobacco producer and
consumer, according to a national conference to mark Anti-Tobacco
Day in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
Smoking was responsible for 514,000 deaths, while causing the
loss of 1.14 million laborers and bringing about 22.9 billion yuan
(2.7 billion U.S. dollars) in direct medical fees in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The study shows that 63 percent of male adults and 4 percent of
females smoke in China, and the number of teenager and female
smokers are growing.
</P>
<P>
Cigarettes now kill 2,000 people in China every day, and the
death toll is expected to climb to 8,000 per day, or three million
every year by the middle of the next century if current smoking
patterns persist.
</P>
<P>
Anti-smoking campaigners have long held that tobacco industry
brings more social and economic costs than economic benefits, and
China is no exception.
</P>
<P>
"The government should realize that potential and long-term
negative impact of the tobacco industry far outweighs the direct
economic benefits such as job opportunities and revenue," said a
researcher.
</P>
<P>
"We must curb smoking among China's youth through legislation,
administrative measures and education," Wang Ke'an, president of
the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine.

<HEADLINE> Manila Satisfied With 1st Day Talks With MILF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Wednesday that the peace talks held on Tuesday between the
government and the separatist Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF)
were cordial, with the two sides establishing mutual trust.
</P>
<P>
Eduarto Batenga, Philippine peace panel chairman, said in a
radio interview that the Tuesday meeting held in the southern
Cotabato City proceeded smoothly and "we're hopeful the talks will
result in something positive."
</P>
<P>
The Tuesday meeting was the first time that government and MILF
peace panel representatives met since the rebel group suspended
the formal negotiations in April.
</P>
<P>
During Tuesday's meeting, Batenga said the government formally
presented to the MILF a package of proposed political and economic
programs that would boost the peace process.
</P>
<P>
According to Batenga, the proposed government package centered
on attaining meaningful autonomy for Muslim Mindanao. He also
pointed out the need to conclude the talks by June 30, the
deadline set by President Josph Estrada.
</P>
<P>
"We discussed a political package that the government feels
will meet the MILF's needs within the mandate of the constitution,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
Batenga said the MILF asked for 15 days to study the political
package, and another 15 days to give its inputs through the
technical working committee, which would mean going beyond the
June 30 deadline.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed optimism that the decision of the national
government to issue safety and immunity passes to the participants
in the talks will enhance the cordial atmosphere of the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The talks are scheduled to conclude on Wednesday, but the MILF
is asking for extension of the peace talks to have more time to
study the proposal of the government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Armed Forces spokesman Rafael Romero said 75 MILF
rebels were killed in clashes with Army soldiers in Mindanao on
Monday and Tuesday despite the resumption of peace talks between
the government and the MILF.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado said the MILF should stop all
violent actions in Mindanao and Metro Manila before any ceasefire
can be effective.
</P>
<P>
The 15,000-strong MILF has been fighting for an independent
Muslim state in Mindanao for more than two decades.

ISLAMABAD, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Wednesday said Taiwan is
an integral part of China and the recent statements of Chen
Shuibian of Taiwan are evasive and betray his lack of sincerity
about "One China" policy.

<P>
"Pakistan believes that there is only one China," Foreign

<P>
He said, "Taiwan is an integral and inalienable part of the

representing the whole of China including Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
He said the Taiwan issue is an internal affair of the People's
Republic of China. "Outside powers should not meddle in China's
internal affairs."

"The government of Pakistan is confident that like Hong Kong
and Macao, Taiwan would soon return to the motherland," he added.

<P>
With a homely and loving atmosphere, the children have grown to
be confident and independent. They have also learnt to love other
people.
</P>
<P>
Tian Yongliang, an eight-year-old village boy, said that he
does not envy those boys and girls in ordinary families at all.
They are spoilt and often cry over trivial matters.
</P>
<P>
A chess coach, who once took a group of Chinese children abroad
for an international contest, said that some of the team members
from the children's village were the most considerate and best
behaved compared with children from ordinary families.
</P>
<P>
The children are also hard-working. Zhaoxian, a lute tutor,
said unlike those children from functional families, the three
children from the village in her class did not even miss one class
no matter how heavy it rained.
</P>
<P>
In China, all "mothers" are required to attend courses for
raising children before they enter the village, as most of these "
mothers" are still single, and have no experience on how to look
after children, said Wang Wuhai.
</P>
<P>
China now has nine SOS villages. The first village was
established in the port city of Tianjin in 1986. Funds come from
the Ministry of Civil Affairs and SOS Children's Villages.

<P>
ZHENGZHOU, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Zhou Guifang, a "mother" in the
SOS Children's Village in Kaifeng, central China's Henan Province,
was delighted to see her "oldest son", Liu Zhengguang, a 13-year-
old orphan, give a piece of candy to his youngest "brother", Niu
Shaohua.
</P>
<P>
Liu saw her parents being killed. He was hostile to everyone
when he arrived in the village. Three years of care and tender
love has changed Liu.
</P>
<P>
The SOS Children's Village is a social welfare institution
specially for the orphans. Most villages are composed of 15 to 20
families, with one mother and six to eight children living in an
independent house. The first one of the kind was set up in Austria
in 1949.
</P>
<P>
"Every orphan has a heartbreaking story to tell," said Wang
Wuhai, who runs the village. Most of them are premature and timid
and harbor prejudices. What they need is love and care. All the 14
mothers in the village believe the love and care will help them
grow into mature young adults.
</P>
<P>
Eight boys and girls in No.8 family were indifferent to their
mother Wang Liping when she arrived. Six months later, however,
they held a party for Wang's 23rd birthday, and they called her "
mum" for the first time. Moved to tears, Wang said, "That was the
best birthday present I ever got."
</P>
<P>
A variety of activities such as table-tennis contests, dancing
and singing troupes, and chess clubs are held in the village.
Village children can also learn drawing, calligraphy, computers,
and musical instruments.

<HEADLINE> China's Real Estate Sector Attracts Foreign Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Foreign capital in China's real
estate sector grew rapidly with the encouragement of the Chinese
government to promote the commercialization of the property market.
</P>
<P>
Actual foreign investment in the real estate sector was 700
million U.S. dollars in 1992, but rising to 6.22 billion U.S.
dollars in 1994.
</P>
<P>
However the Southeast Asian financial crisis of 1997 depressed
the volume of utilized foreign capital to 5.27 billion U.S.
dollars in 1997 and 4.39 billion U.S. dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
But, the experts noted, there are strong indications that the
upward trend has now resumed.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment in real estate has been spreading form the
south to the north and from coastal areas to the hinterland, the
experts said.
</P>
<P>
The investment has transferred from coastal cities such as
Shenzhen, Xiamen, Guangzhou, Shanghai and Tianjin. In recent years,
it has expanded to some big inland cities including Chengdu,
Chongqing and Wuhan.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment in real estate has also expanded from
commercial and service facilities and luxury residences to
ordinary residential buildings, and from new-district development
to old-district renovation.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, foreign investors have helped renovate such
commercial districts as Wangfujing, Xidan, Chongwen and Xuanwu
districts.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin has signed 16 contracts worth two billion U.S. dollars
with foreign investors to renovate old districts.
</P>
<P>
In Shanghai, three Hong Kong consortia allied to renovate the
Zhabei District with an investment expected to surpass 10 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors are also helping renovate old urban districts
in Dalian, Guangzhou and Fuzhou.
</P>
<P>
More and more foreign-funded developers are involved. Of some
20,000 real estate developers nationwide, more than 5,000 are Sino-
foreign joint ventures or cooperative enterprises and over 1,000
are wholly foreign-owned.

<HEADLINE> Seven Giant Nasdaq Stocks Begin Trading On SEHK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Seven name-brand Nasdaq stocks --
Amgen, Applied Materials, Cisco, Dell, Intel, Microsoft and
Starbucks -- Wednesday began trading on the Stock Exchange of Hong
Kong (SEHK), the second largest exchange in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq Stock Market and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing
Ltd. (HKEx) on Wednesday morning initiated a pilot program to
quote and trade the seven Nasdaq stocks, some of them being the
largest stocks with strong business interest in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Following the move, the Hong Kong stock market jumped 5.17
percent on Wednesday as a record gain in the Nasdaq index,
breaking its 250-day moving average at 14,700.
</P>
<P>
"This is a step forward in the development of global trading of
the world's leading stocks," Nasdaq Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer Frank G. Zarb commented.
</P>
<P>
"As our companies pursue business opportunities globally, it
makes sense that they offer their stock globally, reinforcing
their brand names in the minds of consumers and investors and
having the opportunity to access a lower cost capital."
</P>
<P>
However, the Nasdaq shares are being admitted for trading only,
but not "listed" on SEHK, and the Nasdaq retains responsibility
for the regulation of these companies to ensure that they meet the
relevant listing requirements, according to the Nasdaq chairman.
</P>
<P>
Charles Lee, chairman of HKEx, told the quoting ceremony here
Wednesday that this was the first pilot program to allow Nasdaq
stocks to be quoted for trading in an Asian time-zone exchange.
</P>
<P>
"We anticipate investors' interest will grow in parallel with
their investment knowledge in these stocks and with the extension
of their strategy to cover overseas stocks," Lee said.
</P>
<P>
The development of a liquid market in Hong Kong for global
stocks would help to establish it as an integral part of a 24-hour
global trading market linking the Asian, European and the United
States time zones, the HKEx chairman noted.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of the pilot program followed the creation of
the joint website by the SEHK and Nasdaq in December 1998, which
provides share price information on Hong Kong and the U.S. listed
companies and was the first cooperative operation of its kind
between major securities markets.
</P>
<P>
HKEx Chief Executive Kwong Ki-chi also said at the quoting
ceremony that the pilot program offered investors in Hong Kong and
the region easier access to the stocks of some of the leading
companies which are shaping the development of the new economy.
</P>
<P>
The sustained economic development in Hong Kong, China's
mainland and the Asian region would create an enormous liquidity
pool in this time-zone which would attract the trading of quality
global stocks, and these would in turn provide opportunities for
investors to diversify their investments and an alternative
hedging market for cross-border trading activities, Kwong
explained.
</P>
<P>
The seven stocks will be quoted and traded in Hong Kong dollars
(one U.S. dollar is equal to 7.8 HK dollars). And trading of the
stocks will be subject to SEHK rules and Hong Kong Law including
the market manipulation provisions of the Securities Ordinance.

</P>
<P>
The company has also established an on-line procurement

<HEADLINE> HK Govt Committed to E-commerce Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) government was fully committed to
encouraging the development of e-commerce to maintain the region's
competitive edge and drive the overall economic growth, a senior
official said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an e-commerce seminar for small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs), Hong Kong's Director of Information Technology
Services Lau Kam-hung said the government "has adopted various
measures to create an environment conducive to the adoption and
development of e-commerce in Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
"To ensure that electronic transactions can be performed
effectively over the Internet, we need a high quality and high
capacity telecommunications infrastructure to provide bandwidth
and services at affordable prices," he said.
</P>
<P>
To this end, Hong Kong has built broadband networks covering
all commercial buildings and available to over 80 percent of
households, Lau said, noting that to date the total capacity of
Hong Kong's submarine cables stands second only to that of Japan
in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The government also encourages more competition and innovation
to further enhance Hong Kong's telecommunications systems for the
development of e-commerce, Lau said, referring to the provision of
a clear and supportive legal system by the Electronic Transactions
Ordinance which, he said, has enhanced the security in the conduct
of electronic transactions.
</P>
<P>
The Ordinance, enacted in January 2000, also provides for a
voluntary certification authority recognition scheme under which
certification authorities (CAs) may apply to the government for
recognition on a voluntary basis in order to protect consumer
interests and to enhance users' confidence in electronic
transactions.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the use of public and private key pairs and
digital certificates also enables individuals and businesses to
establish the identity of the other party in electronic
transactions, ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of the
electronic messages transmitted over open communication network,
Lau said.
</P>
<P>
Citing other measures by the government to encourage e-commerce,
Lau said Hong Kong Post has become the first public certification
authority whose operation conforms to international security
standards to support various e-commerce applications in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
To address the current problem of using Chinese in electronic
communications, the government published the Hong Kong
Supplementary Character Set in September 1999.
</P>
<P>
The government is taking the lead by introducing the Electronic
Service Delivery (ESD) scheme aiming not only to improve the
delivery of public services but also help to familiarize the
citizens with the e-commerce mode of delivery and give them the
confidence in electronic transactions, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The open and common information infrastructure that we are
developing for ESD will serve as a platform for the private sector
to make use of in conducting e-commerce at a later stage," said
Lau.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from local SMEs and renowned organizations in
Australia, Japan, Singapore and the United States, attended
Wednesday's "Seminar on E-commerce in the New Millennium," an
event jointly organized by the Hong Kong Information Technology
Services Department (ITSD) and the Asia Oceanic Electronic
Messaging Association of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation to
enhance local SMEs' E-commerce awareness.
</P>
<P>
E-commerce is taking off in Hong Kong and other parts of the
world in the past one or two years. In 1999, the value of E-
commerce amounted to 96 billion U.S. dollars, and by 2003, the
figure is estimated to rise to between 1.4 billion and 3.2
trillion U.S. dollars.

<P>
NEW DELHI, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Indian Airlines (IA) will resume
its service to Nepal from Thursday after a five-month-long
suspension of its flights to Kathmandu following the hijacking of
its airliner to Kandahar, as Nepal has pledged beefed-up security
measures at Tirubhuyan airport, the local press reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The IA early this month formally announced the resumption of
its daily flights from New Delhi and five flights a week from
Calcutta from June 1 after India and Nepal entered into a
memorandum of understanding during Nepalese Foreign Minister
Chakra Prasad Bastola's visit to New Delhi earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Under the document, the Nepalese authorities have accepted the
IA's demand for the installation of an additional X-ray machine as
well as a final check by Indian security personnel at Kathmandu
airport.
</P>
<P>
The flights were suspended on December 24 last year when the IC-
814 was hijacked by gunmen who commandeered the flight to Kandahar
in Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> World No Tobacco Day Observed in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The World No Tobacco Day was observed
Wednesday in Bangladesh in a befitting manner as elsewhere in the
world, with the slogan of this year "Tobacco kills: Don't be duped.
"
</P>
<P>
In observance of the day, different socio-cultural and anti-
smoking organizations have chalked out elaborate programs in the
city and other parts of the country, including seminar, rally,
discussion meeting, and distribution of leaflets.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has undertaken
various programs to mark the day. As a part of the program, the
ministry brought out a colorful rally Wednesday morning, which was
lead by State Minister for Health and Family Welfare M. Amanullah.
</P>
<P>
Besides, a discussion meeting was held in the afternoon, with
Foreign Minister Abdus Samad Azad as the chief guest.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco is responsible for 3.5 million deaths in the world
every year. Available data suggested nearly 47 percent men and 7
percent women are smokers. In Bangladesh, the situation is still
alarming. As many as 60 percent men and 30 to 40 percent women
smoke or use tobacco.
</P>
<P>
Besides, tobacco is hardly considered by smokeless women as
harmful. It is even a social custom to offer betel nut, smokeless
tobacco leaf or its products as a symbol of hospitality. As a
result, oropharyngeal and upper esophageal cancers are common in
Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
In a message on the World No Tobacco Day, Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina said tobacco is a silent killer which kills the consumers
slowly and silently through smoking-related diseases.
</P>
<P>
Being informed that the national anti-tobacco organization and
Cancer Society have joined hands with the Ministry of Health in
its fight against tobacco, the prime minister wishes their efforts
all success and assures them of all possible cooperation from her
government.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Sells Dar Airport Handling Shares to Swiss Firm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has sold the
majority shares of the Dar es Salaam Airport Handling Company
Limited (DAHACO) at 4.8 million U.S. dollars to a Swiss firm to
conclude the privatization process of the formerly state-owned
handling company.
</P>
<P>
The Presidential Parastatal Sector Reform Commission (PSRC)
said Tuesday here that Swissport International Limited, a
subsidiary of Swissair, acquired 51 percent shares while the
Tanzanian government controlled 49 percent, newspapers said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
PSRC Chairman John Rubambe made the announcement after the
signing ceremony at which Swissport paid 480,000 U.S. dollars as a
conditional down payment for the purchase as stipulated in the
sale agreement to win exclusive rights to provide ground-handling
services at Tanzania's airports.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations for the divestiture of DAHACO started in 1996 when
 Tanzanian government decided to reduce its shareholding in the
company by 16 percent to 49 percent.
</P>
<P>
Formed on April 27, 1984, DAHACO is the sole cargo
ground-handling company to airlines in Tanzania's two major
airports, the Dar es Salaam and Kilimanjaro International
Airports.
</P>
<P>
Signing the documents, Swissport President and Chief Executive
Officer Joseph In Albon said his company plans to apply modern
technology in the DAHACO operations as a strategy to make it more
efficient and competitive.
</P>
<P>
According to Albon, Swissport which was formed three years ago
is a specialized company in airport handling activities with
operation in over 100 countries worldwide.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's former President Canaan
Banana, who was ordered to go to prison on Monday for a year for
sexual offences including sodomy, claimed that he was an innocent
man, the daily Herald reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The former president, after consulting his defense lawyer
Advocate Chris Andersen on Tuesday, told local reporters that his
conviction and sentence were "politically motivated".
</P>
<P>
However, Banana refused to say whether he is considering
applying for presidential pardon, his last option if he is to stay
out of prison.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court ruled on Monday that Banana should serve a
one-year jail term for 11 counts of sexual offences.
</P>
<P>
The court also ordered the former president to pay 250,000
Zimbabwean dollars (6,500 U.S. dollars) as restitution to his
former aide-de-camp Jefta Dube, who is one of the sodomy victims.
</P>
<P>
If he fails to pay the amount, the court said, then another two
years in jail that has been suspended on condition that he pays
would become effective.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- China downed the United States 1-0
in their Pacific Cup women's soccer clash at Bruce Stadium in
Canberra Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
The goal came five minutes from the end when Chinese captain
Sun Wen placed the ball past U.S. goalkeeper Siri Mullinix.
</P>
<P>
The penalty came when Sun, the Asian player of the year, was
brought down by U.S. substitute Danielle Slaton.
</P>
<P>
Chinese coach Ma Yuanan kept the victory in perspective.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. were without several of their top players," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But we are not at our peak yet either," he said.
</P>
<P>
American team boss April Heinrichs said any loss was a big
disappointment for the world champion.
</P>
<P>
"But we learn from our mistakes," she said.
</P>
<P>
Neither side could gain an advantage in a tense first half.
</P>
<P>
In the 28th minute, Zhao Lihong got a sight at goal after being
set up by Zhang Ouying, only to squander the best chance of the
game so far by shooting wide.
</P>
<P>
As halftime approached, a tackle by Lorrie Fair robbed Sun just
when it looked as though she had found a way through.
</P>
<P>
Good work from Slaton brought two chances for the United States
in as many minutes in the second half.
</P>
<P>
First her long cross presented Sindy Parlow with a clear header,
but the striker could only set the ball straight at goalkeeper Han
Wenxia.
</P>
<P>
Then Slaton was in action again, setting up the experienced Mia
Hamm who shot wide.
</P>
<P>
But it all came apart for Slaton when she pulled back Sun five
minutes from time to concede the match-winning penalty.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Cyprus Parties Quarrel Over "Paramilitary Group" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- A head-on clash between Cyprus'
ruling Democratic Rally (DISY) party and main opposition AKEL party
over the "paramilitary" issue is now becoming "an unending storm"
on the political arena of the island.
</P>
<P>
The row started on Friday, when AKEL deputy Costas Papacostas
charged that DISY was harbouring a clandestine paramilitary group
to keep tabs on the political opinions of officers in the National
Guard, Cyprus' armed forces.
</P>
<P>
"The aim of the paramilitary staff is to monitor National Guard
activities and record the political beliefs of Cypriot officers,
classifying them into friends, foes, and the dangerous," he said.
</P>
<P>
Papacostas said he had documents naming well-known DISY
supporters as members of the group.
</P>
<P>
But DISY vehemently denied the allegations, accusing Papacostas
of having "ulterior political motives."
</P>
<P>
The allegations are being investigated both by the defense
ministry and the police. Defense Minister Socratis Hasikos said he
had ordered Evangelos Florakis, chief of National Guard, to
investigate the allegations and report to him on June 5.
</P>
<P>
But Florakis, a retired Greek general who took the post of
National Guard Chief earlier this month, appeared to give credence
to the accusations.
</P>
<P>
He said he had seen documents relating to an alleged
paramilitary group and that they were "serious."
</P>
<P>
"I almost fell off my chair... I said this would have to be
investigated or I would resign," he said at an emergency meeting
called by the Defense Committee of the parliament to discuss the
issue.
</P>
<P>
The army chief also confirmed that some officers had come
forward to testify in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, former National Guard Chief General Demetrios Demou
distanced himself from the spat.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement, Demou said he knew nothing about any
such group and that no one had ever given him any documents
concerning its existence.
</P>
<P>
Hasikos, a former DISY deputy, told the defense committee his
ministry "never felt the presence of paramilitary groups in its
workings."
</P>
<P>
He vowed to come down hard on anyone found guilty of intervening
in army affairs.
</P>
<P>
President Glafcos Clerides has called both AKEL and DISY to calm
down over the issue, in view of the upcoming United Nations-
sponsored proximity talks on the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Michalis Papapetrou also issued a plea for
a "dampening of tones" in the clash.
</P>
<P>
Despite the government plea for calm, the row is raging both in
and outside the parliamentary defense committee, without signs of
compromise from either side.
</P>
<P>
DISY leader Nicos Anastassiades threatened to reveal documents
proving that the left-wing AKEL had received funding from an
undisclosed foreign secret service if AKEL continued its assault.
</P>
<P>
AKEL spokesman Nicos Katsourides repulsed the allegation by
saying that Anastassiades was trying to divert the public from the
real issue, which was the existence of a group with the aim to
restrict the authority of the commander of the National Guard.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that DISY was harbouring fascists, adding that
active army officers were not allowed to be party members or open
supporters.
</P>
<P>
Petros Clerides, deputy attorney-general, said that a criminal
inquiry could probe deeper into the allegations because of the
powers given by law to the attorney general.

<HEADLINE> Arafat's Advisor Denies Restart of Final Status Talks on Wednesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian-Israeli final-status
negotiations will not be resumed on Wednesday as previously agreed,
said Nabil Abu Rdeineh, advisor to Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio announced on Tuesday that the talks would be
resumed on Wednesday and would be moved from Stockholm to the
region.
</P>
<P>
Abu Rdeineh said the resumption of negotiations will be
discussed during a meeting of the Palestinian negotiating committee
to be held later in the day under the chairmanship of Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital will be
declared on September 13, said Abu Rdeineh, adding that Israel has
to pull out from all the West Bank and Gaza in accordance with
United Nations Resolution 242.
</P>
<P>
Israel has to find a swift solution to the issue of the
Palestinian prisoners in order to create a proper atmosphere for
the resumption of the talks, Abu Rdeineh added.
</P>
<P>
The final-status talks touch upon the thorniest issues between
the two sides, including Jerusalem, border, Palestinian refugees,
Jewish settlements, security and water.
</P>
<P>
Israel seized the Arab East Jerusalem in 1967 and declare the
whole Jerusalem its eternal and indivisible capital, while the
Palestinians want East Jerusalem for their future independent
state.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Lauds Europe's Role in Asia's Revival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Wednesday lauded
Europe's role in Asia's economic revival, primarily by keeping
their economies open.
</P>
<P>
"Europe's facilitating role in Asia's recovery underscores the
linkages and level of interdependence between the economies of the
two regions," Malaysia's Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad
Badawi said at the closing of a two-day Europe-Asia Business
Summit here.
</P>
<P>
He said Europe and Asia stand together now to further develop a
relationship built on mutual respect, and are creating a strategic
alliance among equals.
</P>
<P>
Although Asia-Europe cooperation in trade and investment has
remained strong since the colonial days, a more comprehensive
relationship was articulated in 1996 during the Asia-Europe summit
meeting held in Bangkok which began the ASEM process, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Subsequent ASEM meetings have strengthened the renewed efforts
at bridging the two continents, especially between two of the
world's most successful regional groupings -- the European Union
and ASEAN," he said.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah expressed his belief that the ASEM process will be an
important foundation for the development and strengthening of
future Asia-Europe cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He also believed that Europe and Asia have an important role to
play in reassessing the ugly side of globalization and
proliferation of information technology to ensure that ultimately
both remain in charge of the changes taking place.
</P>
<P>
Europe and Asia must forge a common platform on which to
articulate their concerns, he said, adding Asia-Europe relations
must address these concerns and focus on the challenges faced by
both regions.
</P>
<P>
At the business summit themed "Reshaping European-Southeast
Asian Business Ties: New Conditions, Shapes, Trends and
Opportunities," issues that were discussed included business
opportunities in Asia, development in transportation and
infrastructure, regional ports and airports, business
opportunities in Thailand after the economic crisis, business
opportunities in Europe, the multimedia super corridor in Malaysia
and the tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
The speakers included government ministers, corporate leaders
and business figures from Europe and Asia.

surge in the morning session propelled by high-tech counters.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) ended 4.10 points lower
to close at 1,795.13 points, far off an all-day high of 1,852.63

083.90 million Singapore dollars (630.17 million U.S. dollars).
Gainers outpaced losers by 173 to 125 with 245 counters unchanged.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Mozambicans Agree on Minimum Price for Cotton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican Cotton Institute
(IAM), the cotton companies, and representatives of associations
of peasant producers have agreed on a minimum price of 2,500
meticais (16 U.S. cents) a kilo for raw cotton in the coming
harvest, reports Wednesday's issue of the independent news sheet
"Metical".
</P>
<P>
In nominal terms, this is an increase of 200 meticais a kilo
on last years price of 2,300 meticais, a rise of 9 percent.
However, over the same period the meticais has devalued sharply
against the U.S. dollar. When it was introduced in mid-1999, the
price of 2,300 meticais was equivalent to over 18 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
The companies protested that even with a producer price of
2,300 meiticais a kilo, they made a loss when they exported the
cotton. In 1999, world cotton price slumped to their lowest level
in 15 years.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the price is improving, and on Tuesday stood at
61.55 cents a kilo. But "Metical" points out that there is no
guarantee that the price will not slip again later in the year.
</P>
<P>
In any case, the price is still a long way short of the 70 or
80 cents a kilo that cotton was fetching on the world market in
the mid 1990s. High international prices made possible a minimum
producer price of 3,300 meiticais a kilo, for top grade cotton, in
1997.
</P>
<P>
Currently cotton is the only crop for which the government,
through the IAM, sets a minimum producer price. But this is likely
to disappear in the next couple of years.
</P>
<P>
At Tuesday's meeting between the IAM, the companies and the
associations, there was general consensus that the liberalization
of the sector was " irreversible".
</P>
<P>
A working group has been set up to look at the entire cotton
sector, and will draw up proposals for altering the rules for
cotton marketing.

<HEADLINE> ITU's Distance-Learning Course Attracts Latin Americans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- A distance-learning course on
Telecommunication Regulation for Latin America has attracted a
record number of participants, the International Telecommunication
Union (ITU) said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The popular distance-learning course, organized by the ITU
Telecommunication Development Bureau (BDT) under the "Centers of
Excellence" project, is being delivered over the Internet to
regulatory officials in Latin America through the ITU Virtual
Training Center (VTC).
</P>
<P>
The 10-week course was launched on April 3 and runs through
June 2, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Interest in the BDT regulatory distance-learning course has
surpassed all expectations, according to the ITU.
</P>
<P>
Over 120 regulatory officials throughout the Americas region
requested to participate in the course -- more than four times the
usual capacity of the VTC (30 participants).
</P>
<P>
Even though VTC capacity was increased to accept up to 50
participants, many prospective participants were placed on a
waiting list.
</P>
<P>
The BDT plans to re-offer the Latin American regulation course
during the second half of this year.
</P>
<P>
"E-learning is opening new horizons in the development of human
resources," said Hamadoun Toure, director of the ITU
Telecommunication Development Bureau.
</P>
<P>
"We expect that the experience gained in the course for the
Americas region will set the standard for all regions of the world,
" he added.

<HEADLINE> Oil Price Increase to impact on African States' Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) has said that although the global economy
grew during 1999, the economies of sub-Saharan African countries
grew by a lower rate compared with 1998, Times of Zambia newspaper
reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A COMESA annual report just released said the increase in oil
prices and adverse climatic conditions will affect the performance
and growth of sub- Saharan economies this year and next year.
</P>
<P>
Sub-Saharan economies, excluding Nigeria and South Africa,
recorded an average growth rate of 3.2 percent last year compared
with 3.6 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to COMESA estimates, although the 3.2 percent growth
rate may appear reasonable, it was insufficient to raise per
capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the sub-Saharan countries.
</P>
<P>
The effects of war in various parts of the continent has been
cited as the major contributing factor to the hindrance of
economic growth on the continent.
</P>
<P>
"Prospects for the current year and the year 2001 are rather
mixed as oil prices rise and adverse climatic conditions, notably
flooding and drought, affect the region variably," the report
adds.
</P>
<P>
COMESA is optimistic however that the continued pursuit of
sustainable open, market- oriented economy and good governance
policies is likely to have a positive effect.

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Implement Zero Tariff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The Zambia Revenue Authority (ZRA)
will strictly implement the zero tariff under the Common Market
for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) to match tariffs from
other member countries, a senior official of ZRA has said.
</P>
<P>
Nathan Chishimaba, ZRA head of executive support unit, was
quoted by Wednesday's Times of Zambia newspaper as saying that the
COMESA Free Trade Area (FTA) scheduled for October 31 this year
will be effected on an automated system for customs data system by
changing the configuration that calculates duty at a preferential
rate.
</P>
<P>
About 13 countries in the COMESA region are operating the
system and ZRA is currently working to upgrade the system to
achieve the advanced automated system for customs data, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The implementation of zero tariffs will be done on a strictly
reciprocal basis. This means that concessions will be offered only
to the extent that various member countries will apply import
tariffs to exports originating from Zambia," the official said.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the Zambian authority had put in place an
audit and business risk department at the customs head office to
look at post- clearance of goods.
</P>
<P>
There was also a control unit at the customs head office called
outfield that consists of officers trained in enforcement and
investigations which would monitor transactions in all major
border stations, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Chishimaba, the operations of the outfield
officers would be backed by an intensive data monitoring and
exchange program with other countries in COMESA to ensure that the
rules of origin are verified.

<HEADLINE> WWF Calls for Action to Save Wild Salmon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF)
has called for decisive action to save the wild Atlantic salmon
from distinction.
</P>
<P>
"More than 300 rivers have already lost their wild salmon
stocks, and each year more rivers lose their salmon or show signs
of rapidly decreasing spawning populations," WWF's Henning Roed
said Wednesday as government representatives gathered in Canada
this week in the lead-up to the 17th North Atlantic Salmon
Conservation Organization (NASCO) meeting.
</P>
<P>
The causes of the decline are diverse but they are all man-made,
said Roed, who is coordinating the WWF's research. Dams and other
river engineering works block the salmon's passage to suitable
spawning grounds. Industrial domestic and agricultural pollution
destroys clean habitats. Farmed salmon, of which almost a million
escape each year in Norway alone, are a risk to wild salmon
because they spread diseases and parasites that can kill wild
populations.
</P>
<P>
New WWF research shows that stocks of this species have plunged
to their lowest ever levels. The wild Atlantic salmon, which
spawns in freshwater but spends much of its life at sea, could be
bound for extinction if current trends continue, according to the
WWF.
</P>
<P>
In North America, the number of large salmon returning to their
native rivers has dropped by 90 percent; the species has
disappeared from more than three quarters of Baltic rivers in the
last 100 years; and catches of salmon in Scotland and Ireland are
down to roughly 25 percent of what they were three decades ago.
</P>
<P>
"NASCO countries must institute catch limits based on
scientific recommendations, and close mixed-salmon fisheries that
adversely affect endangered salmon stocks," said Roed. "It's vital
for them to adopt standards for responsible salmon fish farming
that stop its negative impact on wild stocks, and to oppose the
introduction of genetically modified salmon."

<HEADLINE> Foreign Trade in Chongqing Increasing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Both the imports and exports of
Chongqing, the largest metropolis in southwestern China,

The city's imports increased by 70 percent to reach 270 million
U.S. dollars in the first four months, while exports doubled the
figure of last year's same period to reach 240 million U.S.
dollars.

motor vehicles and motorcycles from Japan accounting for 70
percent of the total volume.

<HEADLINE> Dental Health In China a Concern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Most Chinese children suffer from
tooth diseases, according to a recent national survey conducted by
a group of local dental experts.
</P>
<P>
In China, 76.55 percent of the five-year-olds have had decayed
teeth, at an average of four each, the survey shows.
</P>
<P>
The incidence of dental problems among teenagers is also
serious, with 85 percent of middle school students suffering from
periodontal difficulties.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that one-third of all Chinese still do not
have the habit of regularly brushing their teeth.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the consumption of sugar and the decline in
coarse food grain intake in the Chinese diet has caused the
prevalence of dental problems, according to the experts, who fear
that this trend may continue if effective measures are not taken.
</P>
<P>
To tackle the problem, the Ministry of Public Health plans a
series of campaigns urging people to take better care of their
teeth.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Smokers to Join International Quit-Smoking Contest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- A 33-year-old Chinese chain smoker
may get 10,000 U.S. dollars if he wins an international contest
for smokers trying to kick the habit.
</P>
<P>
Jia Zhenyu, a resident of north China's port city of Tianjin,
won a lottery here today to qualify for the 2000 International
Quit and Win Contest.
</P>
<P>
China's health authority hopes the campaign, involving some 31,
000 tobacco users throughout the country, can prompt more smokers
to stop smoking, even though a national survey has revealed that
only 17 percent of some 320 million smokers are serious about
quitting.
</P>
<P>
"What smokers who determine to quit the habit mostly need is
strong motives and support," Wang Zhao, an official with the
Ministry of Health, said at today's lotto drawing, at which the
annual World No-tobacco Day was also marked.
</P>
<P>
Jia, a chain smoker for nine years, has abstained from
cigarettes for the past month, as the contest rules stipulate.
</P>
<P>
It is the third time China, with the world's biggest population
of smokers, has taken part in the international contest. It is
supported by the World Health Organization (WHO) with aims to
encourage more smokers to quit.
</P>
<P>
One million smokers in 83 countries have entered the contest;
winners will be announced in August in Germany by Dr. Gro Harlem
Brundtland, director-general of the WHO.
</P>
<P>
A Tianjin participant won the 5,000 U.S. dollar prize in the
1996 contest.

<HEADLINE> Lobbying Intensifies for Turkey's Attack Helicopter Tender </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- As Turkey's multi-billion-dollar
attack helicopter bid approached its end on Friday, competing
countries have increased their lobbying activities for the project.
</P>
<P>
Following Russian Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov's visit,
Israeli Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sne also came to Ankara to
push for the joint Russian-Israeli Erdogan helicopter company in
the bid, Turkish Daily News reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Klebanov visited Ankara last week and delivered Russian
President Vladimir Putin's letter to Turkish President Ahmet Sezer
in which Putin reportedly asked for Sezer's support in the attack
helicopter project.
</P>
<P>
The tender envisages Turkey's co-production of 145 helicopters
with the bid winner, including an initial batch of 50 helicopters
for the Turkish Armed Forces (TSK).
</P>
<P>
The bid is expected to cost a total of 2 billion U.S. dollars.
Turkey had postponed its final decision, for the third time, on the
selection of the bid winner because some companies have not offered
the requested export license with their bid.
</P>
<P>
After eliminating French company Eurocopter's Tiger and U.S.
company Boeing's AH-64D Apache Longbow, the remaining three bidders
include Russian company Kamov with Israeli company IAI's KA-50/52
Erdogan, Italian company Agusta's A129-I and U.S. company Bell
Helicopter-Textron's AH-IZ King Cobra.
</P>
<P>
So far, Russia's Kamov has presented a letter of assurance for
export clearance. However, it was speculated that if Turkey selects
the King Cobra, the U.S. Congress may facilitate authorization of
an export license.
</P>
<P>
Drawing attention to close Turkish-Israeli relations, some
sources said the joint Russian-Israeli company may have a chance of
winning the bid because of its low cost and Israeli promise to
transfer high technology to Turkey in the manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has
called Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit to solicit his support
in the tender.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Coffee Production Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's coffee output is
expected to reach 50,000 tons this year, which represents an
increase of 12,000 tons within three years.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's Financial Times Wednesday quoted the Tanzania Coffee
Board (TCB) Managing Director Leslie Omari as saying that they are
implementing projects aimed at producing 60,000 tons of coffee by
the year 2003, and 70, 000 tons by the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
He said all stakeholders in the coffee industry, the Coffee
Management Unit, cooperative unions, private companies and the
coffee governing board have joined a campaign to revive coffee
production.
</P>
<P>
Under the campaign, which started about three years ago,
strategies were put in place to avail about 16 million coffee
seedlings to farmers to replace aging trees.
</P>
<P>
Coffee has been the major export in Tanzania's foreign trade
for the last two to three decades. Unlike other exports,
Tanzania's coffee remains a hot cake in the international markets
and over 98 percent of its total crop is exported.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement issued recently by the TCB, Germany
maintains its position as Tanzania's number one coffee export
market followed by Japan, the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain and
Italy.
</P>
<P>
Germany dominated 38 percent of Tanzanian total coffee exports,
followed by Japan with 18 percent, the Netherlands 14 percent and
Belgium 10 percent.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Sells State-Owned Telecom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The German-led consortium that won
the bid to buy majority shares in Uganda Telecom Limited (UTL) has
paid 33.5 million U.S. dollars for the 51 percent of stake in the
state-owned company, the New Vision daily reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The consortium, led by Detecon Gmbh and Telecel International
of Switzerland, made the payment Tuesday, six days to the June 5
deadline set by the Ugandan government.
</P>
<P>
Peter Sommer, Detecon's head of telecommunications department
for Africa, handed over the bank draft to Ugandan Finance Minister
Gerald Ssendaula in Kampala.
</P>
<P>
Orascom, a leading telecommunication firm in Egypt, has also
joined the venture.
</P>
<P>
The deal will be sealed on Friday with the signing of the
agreement to hand over UTL to the new buyers, said the report.
</P>
<P>
"The closing of this transaction will mark the full
liberalization of Uganda's telecommunications sector," Michael
Opagi, Ugandan Privatization Unit director, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The government will continue to hold a 49-percent stake in
UTL, which is expected to be sold to the public at the earliest
opportunity on the Uganda Stock Exchange," Opagi said.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Ssendaula said it is government policy to
liberalize all public utilities.
</P>
<P>
The bid-winner consortium is supposed to install 100,000 fixed
lines within the next five years in the east African country.

<HEADLINE> China's Imported Timber Stock Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The stock of imported timber in
China has soared to over one million cu m, as the size of these
imports have increased dramatically, according to customs sources.
</P>
<P>
China's foreign trade companies began importing timber in
December 1998, when China began to implement a ban on logging in
many national forests.
</P>
<P>
Overall imports in 1999 grew at the remarkable rate of 18.2
percent, the highest growth since 1994, at a total worth of 165.8
billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The entry port of Shenzhen handled 241,200 cu m of timber
imports in the first four months this year, up 50 percent from the
same period last year, while 49 new foreign companies joined in
the business of timber imports during the period.
</P>
<P>
Insiders note that rising imports of high-quality timber
materials was fanned by the booming real estate market and the
upholstering business.
</P>
<P>
Simple varieties of traditional upholstering timber materials,
such as miscellaneous timbers and pine wood, no long satisfy the
domestic market. Shenzhen Customs imported 41,200 cu m of beech
logs in the first four months this year, compared with 15,100 cu m
for the corresponding period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Customs officials also attribute rising timber imports to the
inauguration of policy to develop western China.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign trading companies have foreseen the large demand for
timber for mammoth infrastructure construction projects," said one
analyst.
</P>
<P>
However, the big leap in timber imports has already created
stockpiles, and some experts warn that it will take 6 to 10 months
for the domestic market to consume the inventory.

<HEADLINE> Innovation Revitalizing China's Traditional Industries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SUZHOU, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The Yanzhou Coal Mining Group in
east China's Shandong Province, which lost about 20 million yuan (
about 2.4 million U.S. dollars) annually two decades ago, has
ranked first in the country's coal industry in terms of sales,
profits, and taxes for four consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
It has also become China's largest coal exporter.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Jingche, chairman of the group, attributes this success to
the development and application of advanced mining technology.
</P>
<P>
"By using this technology, one coal face can now produce five
million tons of raw coal a year, five times the pre-1994 figure,"
Zhao said, adding that the new technology will soon be exported to
Australia.
</P>
<P>
China's traditional industries, including coal mining, textiles,
and automobiles, which face both challenges and opportunities at a
time of economic globalization and worldwide scientific and
technological development, have entered the critical stage of
restructuring and upgrading with new and high technologies, said
Sheng Huaren, Minister in charge of China's State Economic and
Trade Commission, while attending the China Technological
Innovation Achievements Fair held here on May 27-29.
</P>
<P>
According to Sheng, these industries, stricken with problems of
outdated equipment, inefficiency, and widespread losses over the
past decades, have shown signs of revitalizing thanks to
nationwide efforts to boost innovation in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The more than 900 enterprises at the fair, including Hai'er,
Chunlan, and Lucky, which inked a total of 2,500 deals, are all
beneficiaries of the innovation efforts.
</P>
<P>
The China Lucky Group Corporation, a major color film producer,
was almost put out of business by Kodak and Fuji products in the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
However, in 1990 the group began to devote itself to improving
its product mix and quality, and has since launched five
generations of color film, photographic paper, copy paper, and
several other new products.
</P>
<P>
The group has now captured a 24 percent share of the Chinese
color film market while extending exports to more than 40
countries.
</P>
<P>
With annual sales of 778 million yuan (about 93.73 million U.S.
dollars), the group is currently busy building a state-level
sensitive material research center.
</P>
<P>
"Propelled by innovation, Lucky must be able to secure a larger
share of the international market," said Xu Yanfang, vice director
of the group's scientific research office.
</P>
<P>
China's national technological innovation system is scheduled
to come about in the new century. At that time, analysts say,
enterprises in traditional industries will be armed with the means
to compete more effectively.

<HEADLINE> Fishing Ban in South China Sea Begins Tomorrow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, May 31 (Xinhua) --A total of 40,000 fishing boats
from south China's Hainan and Guangdong provinces and the Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region will remain in harbor for two months, as
the country's summer fishing ban will become effective at noon
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, 17,000 fishing boats are from Guangdong Province,
including 1,239 from the city of Zhuhai, and 3,600 are from the
island province of Hainan, according to information from the two
provinces.
</P>
<P>
Hainan, Guangdong, and Guangxi have all set up organizations to
oversee the execution of the fishing ban.
</P>
<P>
Preparations for implementing the fishing ban, including public
information on the significance of the program, the anchorage and
maintenance of the fishing boats, as well as arranging short-term
training courses for fishermen and providing poor fishing families
with subsidies to guarantee subsistence, all have been completed.
</P>
<P>
China has successively imposed a summer fishing ban in
restricted areas of the East China Sea, Yellow Sea, and South
China Sea since 1995, and this effort has produced positive
results.
</P>
<P>
For instance, the country first introduced the summer fishing
ban in the South China Sea last year, and as a result there was a
16 percent rise in Hainan Province's marine catches last year.
</P>
<P>
This year's fishing ban in the South China Sea will end at noon
on August 1.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The first allocation of 51.3
million yuan (6.18 million US dollars) in the property of the
bankrupt Guangdong International Trust and Investment Co. (GITIC)
was made yesterday.
</P>
<P>
At the creditors' meeting convened by the Intermediate Court of
Guangzhou yesterday, the liquidation group said this sum was paid
to creditors of the Guangdong International Leasing Co. Ltd., a
GITIC subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
The first allocation amounted to 3 percent of the company's
debts.
</P>
<P>
The liquidation group, composed of experts from world famous
accountant and legal firms including KPMG Peat Marwick, has
confirmed 67 debt claims of the Guangdong Int'l Leasing Co. Ltd.,
totaling 1.68 billion yuan (202 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Sources at the meeting reported that the liquidator is now
committed to collecting debts owed to Guangdong Int'l Leasing, and
staging auctions to liquidate the company's property.
</P>
<P>
GITIC, the investment arm of booming Guangdong Province, was

outstanding debts. It had assets of 21.47 billion yuan (2.6
billion dollars) but debts amounting to 36.15 billion yuan (4.3
billion dollars).
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji told
visiting Indian President K. R. Narayanan here today that the
president's current visit to China at the 50th anniversary of the
establishment of Sino-India diplomatic relations will help deepen
the friendship and relationship of cooperation between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Narayanan, who is in the fourth day of
his seven-day state visit to China, Zhu said that India is one of
the first countries which established diplomatic ties with China
and, the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, which China and
India co-pioneered and are widely acknowledged by the
international community, have demonstrated their full vitality,
and are a remarkable contribution to human civilization and
progress.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier noted that exchange and cooperation between
China and India in the areas of politics, economy, and culture
have been conducted constantly over the past years, and the main
course of bilateral relations remains good-neighborly, despite
some disputes.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government and people highly value their
traditional friendship with India, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"As the two biggest developing countries, China and India can
increase cooperation in international affairs, and make joint
efforts to safeguard the rights and interests of the developing
countries, as well as help build a just and rational new world
order," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the premier said that China attaches great
importance to developing trade and economic cooperation with India.
On the basis of equality and mutual benefit, China and India can
learn from each other and seek common development.
</P>
<P>
China and India should become good partners in trade and
economic cooperation, he said, urging the relevant departments of
both countries to explore new cooperation potentials.
</P>
<P>
Narayanan said the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence
initiated by the leaders of the two countries have laid a solid
foundation for political ties. In the new century, India hopes to
expand cooperation in the economic and technological areas, and
together with China contribute to the peace and development of
mankind.
</P>
<P>
After Beijing, the president will tour the city of Dalian in
northeast China's Liaoning Province, and Kunming, capital of
southwest China's Yunnan Province.

<P>
BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Teaching is the future profession
most preferred by Chinese urban children, according to a recent
survey published in today's Beijing Daily.
</P>
<P>
The survey, which was carried out among children between the
ages of 6 and 15 in nine major cities, shows that nearly one out
of five urban children want to be teachers when they become adults.
</P>
<P>
The jobs of worker and farmer were the least favored by the
children surveyed, with only 0.8 and 0.3 percent of the total,
respectively, saying they might like these occupations. Some 16.9
percent of the children said they would like to be scientists, 15.
1 percent doctors, and three percent civil servants and 2.8
percent leading officials.
</P>
<P>
The survey also revealed that the older the children are, the
more likely they will choose well-paid professions, such as
entrepreneur, lawyer, or business people.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Parents Expect Children to Win High Degrees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey shows that one-
fourth of Chinese parents would like their children to earn
advanced degrees, while 36 percent would be satisfied if their
kids can get at least undergraduate diplomas.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted among young parents in Beijing,
Shanghai, Guangzhou and Chongqing, which are all major big cities
in China. Results of the survey indicated that parents have much
higher expectation for their children than ten years ago,
according to China Youth Daily.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that 22.7 percent of the parents want their
children to become involved in high-tech-related jobs which need
professional skills or to become officials.
</P>
<P>
Some 17.5 percent of parents would like their children to be
employees in government organizations, compared with only 3.5
percent ten years ago. Those who hope their children will become
workers, clerks in companies, and primary and middle school
teachers accounted for just ten percent.
</P>
<P>
Compared with ten years ago, parents spend more money on books
and toys for their children but take less time to read stories and
sing songs to them, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
The education level of mothers has a great impact on children's
growth, it found. The survey showed that mothers with higher
degrees tend to make more intelligent evaluations of their
children. For example, 34.3 percent of mothers who have a college
education said that the most promising quality of their children
is common sense; the statistic is 10 percent higher than among
mothers with middle and high school education.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-one percent of parents said they do not have enough time
to spend with their kids, 38 percent don't think they have good
parenting skills, while only four percent blame poor environment
and financial woes for their problems with their children.

<HEADLINE> Jiang's Thinking New Development of Marxist Party Building Theory: Commentary (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The recent important thinking of
Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the Communist Party of China (
CPC) Central Committee, represents a new development of Marxist
Party-building theory, a Xinhua commentary says today.
</P>
<P>
During a recent inspection tour of south China's Guangdong
Province, Jiang said the key to running China lies in the CPC, in
its ideology, style of work, organization, discipline, and
capabilities and leadership.
</P>
<P>
The CPC will remain successful and enjoy the heartfelt support
of the people of China so long as the Party always earnestly
represents the requirements of developing China's advanced social
productive forces, the progressive course of China's advanced
culture, and the fundamental interests of the Chinese people,
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's important thinking summed up the historic experience of
the CPC over the past 80 years, analyzed the lessons of the world'
s socialist movement, and answered questions the CPC has
encountered in the country's reform and opening up and
modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
The thinking also displays the spirit of emancipating the mind
and seeking truth from facts, and will serve as the guiding
principle for Party-building in the new situation, the commentary
stresses.
</P>
<P>
The commentary notes that Jiang's thinking is, first of all, a
high and thorough condensation of the CPC's advanced features. (

<HEADLINE> Jiang's Thinking New Development of Marxist Party Building Theory: Commentary (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The CPC is the political leader and advanced representative of
the working class, and its advanced features can vary from time to
time.
</P>
<P>
Summing up the experience of the world's socialist movement,
Jiang's thinking has brought to light the essence and implications
of the Party's advanced features, and deepened the Party's
understanding of itself.
</P>
<P>
That is, the Party must always earnestly represent the
requirements of developing China's advanced social productive
forces, the progressive course of China's advanced culture, and
the fundamental interests of the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's thinking has also enriched and deepened the contents of
the Party building, the commentary says.
</P>
<P>
During the revolutionary period and in times of war, the goal
of Party building was to build up a political force that could
lead the people forward and overthrow the reactionary rule. After
taking power, the Party had shifted the goal to building itself
into a strong leader of socialist construction.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's thinking has charted the orientation for Party building
in the new century and for the advancement of China's reform and
opening to the outside world as well as its ongoing modernization
drive led by the Party, the commentary states.
</P>
<P>
While emphasizing Jiang's thinking as a new development of
Marxist Party-building theory, the commentary calls on the whole
Party to conscientiously study the "three representatives"
thinking and take concrete measures to push forward the great
cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.

300 million yuan (36 million US dollars) in donations.
</P>
<P>
The project has helped promote the education in poor rural
areas, said Gu Xiulian, vice-chairwoman of the foundation. She
added that the project will try to provide training of operative
technology to rural girls in the next phase.
</P>
<P>
She said that there are still large numbers of girl dropouts
among the poverty-stricken population, which accounted for 15
percent of the country's total poverty-stricken population.

<HEADLINE> China Sets World Records in Carbon Fiber Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Scientists at the Chinese Academy
of Sciences (CAS) have succeeded in producing the world's thinnest
carbon nanotubes, a type of carbon fiber.
</P>
<P>
A research group headed by Xie Sishen, a research professor
with the Institute of Physics under the CAS, has developed carbon
nanotubes which are only 0.5 nanometers in diameter.
</P>
<P>
This is very near the theoretical limit, which is 0.4
nanometers, said Professor Xie. Before his achievement, the
thinnest carbon nanotube in the world was 0.7 nanometers in
diameter.
</P>
<P>
One nanometer is only one/one-billionth of a meter. But carbon
nanotubes with so thin a diameter have great potential for use in
microelectronics.
</P>
<P>
Scientists have found that the thinner a carbon tube is, the
more stable its molecular structure becomes. Therefore, they
attempt to control the molecular structure of carbon nanotubes by
narrowing their diameter, and this will help promote research in
the application of such material.
</P>
<P>
The results of Professor Xie's studies were published in the
January 27 edition of "Nature," the leading English science
magazine.
</P>
<P>
Professor Xie and his research team shattered the world record
by developing the longest carbon nanometer in 1998. They are
currently experimenting with more accurate measurements of carbon
nanometers, and other aspects to consolidate their findings.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Israeli newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli settlement leaders expressed alarm Tuesday at reports
that Israel has agreed to grant the Palestinians the control of 92
percent of the West Bank, including the Jordan Valley settlements,
during the recent "back-channel" talks in Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
The Council of Jewish Communities in Judea, Samaria and Gaza
(the West Bank and Gaza Strip) has called on settlers throughout
the territories to attend an emergency meeting Wednesday evening to
discuss the issues and decide on protest action.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jordan Valley settlers are to launch their own
protest campaign. The 4,000 Jewish residents of the Jordan Valley
and Megillot regional councils were surprised by the reports,
having always believed their communities were part of the Israeli
consensus.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- The Israel Defense Forces will soon embark on a stringent new
program to fight drug abuse among its troops, with the goal of
testing every soldier at least once in his three-year service.
</P>
<P>
IDF investigations of soldiers being released from service in
recent years show a substantial rise in the number of soldiers
taking drugs. The average age at which the soldiers first take
drugs is just over 17, about a year before their induction into
military service.
</P>
<P>
Drug-related disciplinary action files on soldiers who have sold
or abused drugs (mostly marijuana and Ecstasy) also continue to
rise.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. Ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk said Tuesday that his
country expects Syria to withdraw its military forces from Lebanon
following Israel's withdrawal from the security zone last week.
</P>
<P>
Indyk promised while on a tour of Metulla, that the United
States would provide Israel with aid to assist in the redeployment
of IDF troops along the international border.
</P>
<P>
He said that Secretary of State Madeleine Albright promised
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak that the U.S. would release 50
million U.S. dollars to finance the redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and U.S. President Bill
Clinton are to meet in Germany on Thursday to discuss prospects for
peace with Syria and Lebanon after the Israeli troops' withdrawal,
as well as the bogged Palestinian-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. had hoped for a breakthrough in the Palestinian track
before the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon, and now Barak wants to
coordinate positions with Clinton as the negotiations with the
Palestinians move to a critical stage, said a source in Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Japan to Give Bangladesh Grant for Polio Eradication </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Japan will provide 9 million U.S.
dollars to Bangladesh for polio vaccines and programs related to
supplementary immunization in the country under an agreement
signed between Japan and the United Nations Children's Fund on
behalf of Bangladesh in Dhaka, the Daily Star reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The fund will be utilized to procure 90 million doses of polio
vaccines to immunize about 21 million children under five in
Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Japan is the single largest donor in this regard and it has
borne almost 50 percent of the total cost for the supplementary
immunization in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Japan started supporting Bangladesh for polio eradication in
1996, and has already provided a total of 27.5 million dollars for
implementation of its national immunization program.
</P>
<P>
Extraordinary progress has been achieved globally for polio
eradication, and the number of known polio-endemic countries
dropped from 50 in 1998 to 30 last year.
</P>
<P>
In Bangladesh, polio cases have been reduced by 87 percent due
to its supplementary immunization program. However, it is still
among the 30 remaining countries in the world where polio is
endemic.
</P>
<P>
Secretary for Health and Family Welfare Chowdhury reiterated
the need for continued support from donors till the country wins
the battle against polio virus.

<HEADLINE> Manila Confident of Attaining Yearly Growth Targets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Despite the slightly lower than
expected economic expansion in the first quarter, the Philippine
government said Wednesday that it remains confident its overall
growth targets for 2000 are still attainable.
</P>
<P>
Director General Felipe Medalla of the National Economic and
Development Authority said the recent positive developments in the
political front in Mindanao would help speed up he government's
economic recovery efforts.
</P>
<P>
Economic growth for the first quarter, measured through the
gross national product, registered at 3.45 percent, which is less
than the four to five percent growth target set by the government
for this year.
</P>
<P>
"If we can recover in the second semester, we can still achieve
our four percent goal," Medalla said in a radio interview.
</P>
<P>
Medalla said the government expects the rebound of the
agriculture sector during the subsequent months to spur growth.
The farm sector posted a growth rate of only 0.2 percent for the
January-March period.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Mdalla said the recovery of the peso and the growth
of the economy are back on track, especially now that the worst of
the Mindanao conflict appears to have ended as shown by the
resumption of the peace talks between the government and the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
He said the government still expects economic growth to reach
four percent this year, contrary to the reported analyses of
economists that growth targets may go down to two percent.
</P>
<P>
Medalla noted that the stock market appears upbeat with news
about the resumption of the peace negotiations with the Moro
Islamic Liberation Front, along with the ongoing talks for the
release of the 21 hostages in Sulu province.

TANGMAI, May 31 (Xinhua) -- After days of toil, emergency
workers in Tibet have removed a substantial chunk of a wall of mud
and rock formed during a landslide at Yigong Township in Tibet
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Officers and men of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA)
along with local residents have moved 1.31 million cubic meters of
mud from the mound, which stemmed the flow of the Yigong River,
bringing the water level at Yigong down by 21 meters.
</P>
<P>
Workers also have opened up a 38-km stretch of road linking the
Sichuan-Tibet highway with the affected area at Yiyong and built a
600-meter overhead cable to ensure transport of relief materials.
</P>
<P>
The PLA has sent to Yigong 200 motor vehicles and 600 officers
and soldiers who worked there day and night. The army also has
shipped 150 tons of relief materials to Yigong and moved 1,200
sick and old residents out of the affected area.
</P>
<P>
"PLA soldiers and armed policemen are stationed where there are
hardships and danger. Their energetic support led to the speedy
recovery at Yigong," said Gyapo, vice-chairman of the regional
government.
</P>
<P>
A rare landslide followed by mud and rock flows pelted Yigong
Township of Bomi County on the evening of April 9. About 300
million cubic meters of mud and rock temporarily dammed the Yigong
River, destroying seven kilometers of highways, submerging large
tracts of cropland and tea plantations, and leaving more than 4,
000 local people homeless.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Leader Should Face Reality: Magazine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The new leader of the Taiwan
authorities should face the reality that there is only one China
and Taiwan is an integral part of China, said a commentary in the
latest issue of Outlook Magazine, the country's most authoritative
news weekly.
</P>
<P>
In his inauguration speech, the leader promised that he would
not declare independence, nor push forth the inclusion of the so-
called "state-to-state" description in the constitution, nor
promote a referendum to change the status quo in regards to the
question of independence or reunification.
</P>
<P>
However, the speech included an absurd precondition that puts
things upside down to the promises and avoided the most crucial
issue that there is only one China, and Taiwan is an integral part
of China, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
The speech should have provided a chance for the Taiwan
authorities to revert to the stance of the one China principle. It
seems, however, that they have plans of their own.
</P>
<P>
Despite the so-called goodwill of the speech, the Taiwan
authorities have actually adopted a wait-and-see attitude, waiting
for the right moment to declare the independence of Taiwan, the
commentary noted.
</P>
<P>
The idea of Taiwan independence will not be tolerated by the
Chinese people or the international community, and it will become
increasingly difficult to accept as time goes on, the commentary
added.
</P>
<P>
The commentary called on the Taiwan leader to face the reality
of one China rather than closing his eyes to the fact.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand to Have Its Own Children's Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, May 31 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand will have its own
Children's Day on October 29 this year, the government said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The day, chosen to occur on the last Sunday each October, will
hopefully become an annual event where all communities in New
Zealand are encouraged to have special activities where adults
spend time with children, according to a press release issued by
the New Zealand government.
</P>
<P>
"If we don't honor, treasure and celebrate children, what kind
of future do we expect?" New Zealand Social Services and
Employment Minister Steve Maharey asked in the press release.
</P>
<P>
"We want this day to personify the important things that adults
need to show and share with children to improve children's lives.
Investing in children now pays dividends for the future of us all,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
Spending time with children is the major theme of Children's
Day, he said, adding that four other key messages are: love and
affection; praise and encouragement; listening and talking; and
new experiences to describe ways to unlock the potential in all
New Zealand children.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Opposition Parties Submit No-Confidence Motion Against Mori </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Four Japanese opposition parties
Wednesday submitted a no-confidence motion against Prime Minister
Yoshiro Mori's cabinet, charging that Mori's controversial remark
that Japan is a divine nation centering on the emperor violated
the country's constitution.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), the Japanese Communist
Party (JCP), the Liberal Party (LP) and the Social Democratic
Party (SDP) filed the motion to the House of Representatives
shortly after a nonbinding censure resolution against Mori was
rejected in the House of Councilors.
</P>
<P>
"The comment is a clear breach and denial of the constitution,"
the no-confidence motion said, adding that Mori "utterly lacks"
the qualities of a prime minister.
</P>
<P>
"The Mori cabinet should swiftly resign en masse before the
dissolution of the lower house and the general election," said the
motion.
</P>
<P>
Mori is expected to declare the dissolution of the lower house
on Friday for a general election slated for June 25.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties are demanding that a vote be held on the no-
confidence motion, but the ruling bloc, consisting of Mori's
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), New Komeito party and the New
Conservative Party, plans to ignore the demand and wait for the
dissolution of the lower house.
</P>
<P>
At an upper house plenary session earlier in the day, the
ruling coalition voted down the censure resolution submitted
Tuesday afternoon by the opposition bloc.
</P>
<P>
Public support rating for Mori has plunged since he made the "
divine nation" remark at a meeting of pro-Shinto lawmakers on May
15.
</P>
<P>
Critics said Mori's comment echoes the ideology that drove
Japan's wartime militarism as Japan invaded Asian countries in the
name of the emperor.

<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, May 30 (Xinhua) -- World club champion
Corinthians of Brazil downed Palmeiras 4-3 on a last-minute goal
by midfielder Vampetta to win the opening game of their Copa
Libertadores semifinals in Sao Paulo on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The two teams will meet again next Tuesday, with the winner
advancing to the finals against Argentina's Boca Juniors or
America of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Corinthians opened the scoring in the 15th minute when
Ricardinho fired the ball into the left side of the net.
</P>
<P>
In the 39th minute, Palmeiras defender Junior's shot bounced
off Corinthians defender Fabio Luciano before going into the net
to make it 1-1.
</P>
<P>
Six minutes later, Marcelinho shook off two Palmeiras players
and scored Corinthians' second goal before unguarded Edilson made
it 3-1 in the 55th minute.
</P>
<P>
Trailing by two goals, Palmeiras started playing a much more
offensive game, but were kept at bay for much of the second half
by Corinthians' tight defense.
</P>
<P>
In the 75th minute, midfielder Alex headed the pass from Junior
into the net for his team's second goal. Seven minutes later the
game was tied 3-3 when Euller scored on a pass from fellow striker
Pena.
</P>
<P>
Just when it seemed that the game would end in a draw,
Corinthians midfielder Vampetta scored the winning goal in the
90th minute.

<HEADLINE> Blazers Stay Alive With Away Win Over Lakers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Portland Trail Blazers stayed
alive Tuesday night in the Western Conference finals with a 96-88
victory over the Los Angeles Lakers.
</P>
<P>
Injured veteran Scottie Pippen managed 22 points, six steals
and four blocked shots, breaking Michael Jordan's playoff record
of 376 steals with 380.
</P>
<P>
With his team facing elimination, Pippen took complete control
in a terrific all-around performance. The versatile forward was
everywhere, running the offense while making three-pointers and
drives and spearheading the defense with blocks, steals and a
thorough shutdown of Kobe Bryant.
</P>
<P>
Rasheed Wallace was just 7-for-21 from the field, but scored 22
points, including seven of eight free throws, and grabbed 10
rebounds. Steve Smith added 13 points, and Arvydas Sabonis 12.
Brian Grant and Detlef Schrempf added nine each.
</P>
<P>
The Blazers never trailed, jumping out to an early lead for the
third straight game. Unlike Games Three and Four at home, when
they suffered through second-half collapses, the Blazers surged in
the third quarter and temporarily denied Los Angeles its first
trip to the NBA Finals since 1991 with a homecourt victory.
</P>
<P>
Shaquille O'Neal did his best to make it the big night everyone
expected with 31 points and 21 rebounds. Ron Harper added 14
points.
</P>
<P>
But Kobe Bryant made only four of 13 shots, scored 17 points
and committed six turnovers before fouling out with 4:45 to play.
Glen Rice was 1-for-8 from the field and 0-for-5 from 3-point
range, finishing with four points.
</P>
<P>
With Los Angeles up 3-2, the series shift back to Portland for
Game 6 on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
Since both competing teams in the Eastern Conference finals,
the Indiana Pacers and New York Knicks do not match up well
against the Lakers, many experts tabbed the Western Conference
finals as the real championship confrontation.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Young Shuttlers Vow to Join Thomas Cup Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's victory of bringing
home the Thomas Cup four consecutive times has motivated young
shuttlers to follow in their seniors' steps, according to the
Jakarta Post Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ronny Agustinus said that he wanted to join the Thomas Cup team
in the upcoming two years.
</P>
<P>
"I have realized that I have yet to reach my best achievement
in international tournaments. But I hope to improve my physical
condition and mentality in the future to follow in my seniors'
steps," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ronny, 22, said he always had psychological problems in
international tournaments, especially when competing in major
events and facing tough opponents.
</P>
<P>
"I have discussed how to overcome my psychological barrier with
coach Agus Dwi Santoso. I also have problems in improving my
concentration on the court. But I prefer to talk to my coach
instead of psychologists," he added.
</P>
<P>
Teammate Johan Hadikusuma shared the same idea of joining the
next Thomas Cup team.
</P>
<P>
"I don't have any experience in competing in a team event but
in the next two years I must be able to replace the seniors on the
Thomas Cup team," said Johan, who is a younger brother to the 1992
Olympic Games gold medalist Alan Budikusuma.
</P>
<P>
Both Ronny and Johan said the presence of physical trainer
Ridwan Soemardjo helped them to increase their fitness.
</P>
<P>
"But I hope the trainer and the coach can discuss about the
training program more intensively to reach the maximum performance
in the future," Ronny said.
</P>
<P>
"Should the Badminton Association of Indonesia want to have a
physical trainer, they must do it continuously, not only for a
short term period as they did with the Thomas Cup team," Johan
said.
</P>
<P>
If the singles expressed their high motivation, the doubles
specialist Ade Lukas, partnering with Santoso Sugihardjo, seemed
pessimistic on his chance to join the next team.
</P>
<P>
"The competition in the doubles sector is much tougher compared
to the singles. We still have many good young doubles, including
Candra Wijaya and Tony Gunawan; Flandy Limpele and Eng Hian; and
Halim Heryanto and Sigit Budiarto. It's really hard for us to
compete against them. But we are trying," he said.
</P>
<P>
All players said they wanted to achieve better in the upcoming
four tournaments: the Indonesian Open, Malaysia Open, Thailand
Open and Singapore Open.
</P>
<P>
"I want to win one of the four tournaments titles," said Johan,
while Ronny said he wanted to upset the seeds at the event.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government is
considering lifting the exclusive right held by state-owned
telecommunications monopoly PT Telkom and PT Indosat by 2002, a
national newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The move is part of the liberalization program of the country's
telecommunication sector, Jakarta Post quoted a senior official as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
early termination of the monopoly is meant as a response to the
new telecommunication law, effective in September.
</P>
<P>
"The new law clearly states that we have to end all the
monopolistic practices in the telecommunication sector...We are
thinking of lifting the exclusive right now held by PT Telkom and
Indosat by 2002," the official said.
</P>
<P>
PT Telkom currently has an exclusive right to provide local
fixed line service nationwide until 2010 and domestic long
distance telecommunication service until 2005, while PT Indosat
and its subsidiary PT Satelindo control over the international
long-distance service until 2004.
</P>
<P>
Under the new Telecoms Law No. 36/1999, Indonesia will
eliminate all monopolistic practices in its telecommunications
sector. The law will allow any local or foreign firms to enter the
country's telecommunications sector without having to collaborate
with Telkom and Indosat.
</P>
<P>
Director General of Post and Telecommunication Sasmito Dirdjo
said that the liberalization in the telecommunication industry
would be in line with the liberalization program set under the
ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA).

<HEADLINE> Kuchma Urges Ways for Faster Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma
Tuesday urged the establishment of a mechanism to accelerate the
country's economic growth and achieve a growth rate of 6-7 percent
in the gross domestic product (GDP) in a couple of years.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma told a gathering of more than 300 industrialists and
entrepreneurs that Ukraine's main task in developing its economy
was to create necessary conditions for such a growth rate.
</P>
<P>
He said a mechanism for rapid economic development should be
established so that Ukraine's economy could grow in a speed 50-100
percent faster than the world level.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma said such a pace, which has been proved feasible by
domestic and foreign experts, is a decisive precondition for
economic structural reform and creative development.
</P>
<P>
If Ukraine could not achieve this objective and realistic
target, it could be eliminated in the sharp world competition and
lose everything, he said, adding Ukraine has lost a lot during the
deep and long-lasting economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
He described tax reform and investment privatization as the
effective ways to realize this target.
</P>
<P>
He called for tax reduction for corporations and individuals
and private investment, saying poorly-run companies should be
allowed to go bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
A stable exchange rate was not necessarily good to the country'
s economic development, Kuchma pointed out, saying that the
current rise in the value of hryvna, Ukraine's currency, was far
more beneficial to foreign exporters than to domestic importers.

<HEADLINE> Fiji: Military Action Against Hostagetakers Ruled out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fiji's military head Commodore Frank Bainimarama said
negotiations were still continuing to try to win the release of
the toppled Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry and his fellow
hostages, held at the parliament house since May 19.
</P>
<P>
He said that a military action is not an option "right now" and
"We have to think of the lives of the hostages - we want to
continue dialogue."
</P>
<P>
According to Radio Fiji, Speight was refusing to accept any
appointment unless he and his supporters are "properly consulted."
</P>
<P>
Bainimarama said Fiji's 1997 constitution had been torn up and
may not be rewritten for anything up to three years, the AAP
reported.
</P>
<P>
Bainimarama ruled out any possibility that Mahendra Chaudhry
would return to his post. "I am afraid Mahendra Chaudhry will not
come back as prime minister," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Bainimarama appointed former military commander and
diplomat Ratu Epeli Nailatikau to head an interim council of
ministers.
</P>
<P>
As for President Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, who stepped down on
Monday night, Bainimarama said he "does not want to come back."
</P>
<P>
In Suva, the capital of Fiji, Speight's supporters began
hijacking vehicles and beating up drivers Wednesday as Tuesday
night's negotiations between the military and Speight failed to
reach a result, the AAP reported.
</P>
<P>
Tensions in the capital rose dramatically Wednesday morning
with taxis driven by ethnic Indian drivers being stopped, and
Speight's supporters took control of roads around the parliament
house compound, where 30 hostages are held, it said.

JAKARTA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Following bomb blasts in Medan,
capital of Indonesia's North Sumatra province, a grenade exploded
in Nganjuk of East Java province on Tuesday, killing two people
and injuring two others, reports reaching here Wednesday said.
</P>
<P>
A police officer said the grenade exploded at 11:30 a.m. (local

</P>
<P>
Separately, a fifth explosive device in three days found in

<HEADLINE> S.Lankan Troops Advance On Rebel Positions In North </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government troops
were advancing from two locations towards Tamil rebel-held areas
in northern Jaffna Peninsula, the official Daily News reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Troops occupying forward defenses in Chavakachcheri, Ariyali
and Sarasalai which were partially taken control by the rebels
recently, destroyed a rebel bunker line inflicting heavy
casualties on the Tigers on Tuesday, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Following the confrontations, the troops recovered 14 bodies of
the rebels. However, monitored Tiger transmissions revealed that a
large number of rebels were killed and wounded during the assault,
it reported.
</P>
<P>
A military spokesman was quoted as saying that the troops were
using new weapons which were having an effect on the battlefield
and which accounted for the remarkable military gains made by the
troops this week.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday the rebels declared a unilateral ceasefire which
government rejected stating it was a ruse on the part of the
Tigers to play for time and conscript child soldiers for their
depleted ranks.
</P>
<P>
During a search carried out Tuesday following the fighting at
Ariyali and Chavakachcheri, troops recovered a large haul of arms
and ammunition left behind by the fleeing Tamil rebels.
</P>
<P>
Government troops have also destroyed two vehicles carrying
rebels when they were attempting to cross the Navatkuli bridge,
the report added..
</P>
<P>
The Tamil rebels, who are fighting a 17-year-old war for a
separate state for the Tamil community, are engaged in a ferocious
assault in a bid to recapture their former stronghold of Jaffna
city which they lost to the troops in the end of 1995.

<HEADLINE> To Quit Smoking Makes Millionaires: Specialists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Specialists advise smokers to quit
this habit, not only because it is harmful to human health, but it
can also make millionaires.
</P>
<P>
This is an advice put forward by doctors in the southern German
city of Munich on the eve of the World Health Organization's World
No-Tobacco Day on May 31.
</P>
<P>
They assume that if a smoker, who smokes one package every day,
quits this addiction, he will save five Germany marks per day, and
save 1825 marks a year. If he begins this "investment" when he is
only 15, with a 10 percent appreciation of cigarette prices
annually, he will become a millionaire with 2.1 million marks when
he is 65.
</P>
<P>
According to WTO statistics, an estimated four million people
die each year from tobacco-linked diseases, more than the toll
from AIDS, drug abuse, road accidents and murders. Globally,
around six trillion packs of cigarettes are sold each year,
doubling the figure in 1970, according to the WHO.

<HEADLINE> Drug-related Crimes Rise in Kazakhstan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA-ATA, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Kazakh First Deputy Prime Minister
Alexander Pavlov Tuesday called on local governments to fight
drug-related crimes as their priority.
</P>
<P>
Pavlov said in Astana, capital of Kazakhstan, that drug-related
crimes rose sharply in the first four months. Of the more than 46,
000 criminal cases reported in the period, one sixth was related
with drug.
</P>
<P>
Pavlov told an anti-drug forum that the number of teenager drug
addicts increased by 4.7 percent in the same period.
</P>
<P>
Kazakh officials attributed the increase to the rise of drug
trafficking from Southeast Asian countries and Afghanistan and the
growth of a large amount of drug plants in Chuya valley.
</P>
<P>
Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev signed an order in mid-
May to work out a policy of combating drug addiction and
trafficking in 2000-2005.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Provinces Urge Federal Health Care Allocation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Canada's provincial health ministers
said Tuesday that they will discuss reforms of the health care
system only after an immediate federal injection of 4.5 billion
Canadian dollars (3 billion U.S. dollars) for provincial health
care and social programs.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting opening Tuesday in Quebec City, Quebec Health
Minister Pauline Marois said the injection could restore transfer
payments from the federal government to provincial health care and
social programs to a level of five years ago.
</P>
<P>
"After that, we'll discuss what could interest the provinces in
other areas concerning health," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian federal government has promised long-term funding
on condition that the provinces agree to map out a plan of reforms
with Federal Health Minister Allan Rock.
</P>
<P>
This is the third time the provincial health ministers have met
to discuss an agreement on health. They met with Rock months ago,
but failed to reach any deal because of the same differences,
where Rock insisted on a reform plan first, while his provincial
counterparts put more federal cash at the top place.
</P>
<P>
In a 62-page "cost-drivers" document presented to the meeting,
the provincial ministers said, "Canada's publicly funded health
care system is not in crisis, but the cost pressures and
constraints on the system are real."
</P>
<P>
Provincial and territorial health expenditures will be 67
billion Canadian dollars (44.7 billion dollars) within five years
and almost 85 billion (56.7 billion dollars) within 10 years, as a
combined result of population growth, aging, inflation and rising
costs for current programs, they said.

BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Children in China's major cities
including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Chongqing are lacking
independence, according to a recent survey conducted by the

<HEADLINE> Small Changes in Daily Habits Bring Huge Business (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Sanxiao Group is not the only enterprise which has
benefited from the improving living standard of the Chinese people.
The huge market potential brought by the changes in daily life has
been eyed by overseas producers as well. Such brands as "Crest," "
Colgate", and "Signal," produced by the U.S.'s P&AMP;G and Colgate,
and Britain's Unilever are now widely known in China.
</P>
<P>
To meet the growing demand of the Chinese people, the U.S.'s
Colgate company has recently decided to invest 36 million U.S.
dollars, joining hands with Sanxiao Group to set up a joint
venture in Yangzhou producing dental care products and detergents.
</P>
<P>
Tao Siyan,China's first doctor of folklore and professor at
the Dongnan University in Jiangsu Province, says that changes in
living habits are certain to lead to the formation of new consumer
markets. For entrepreneurs to be successful, they must have deep
insight into these changes in order to grasp the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese, who are more aware of new consumption trends in
China, have benefited from their early entry into the China market.
</P>
<P>
Japanese took the lead and exported state-of-the-art TVs, video
cassette recorders, and cameras to China, and for a long time
Japanese-made items monopolized China's household appliance market,
so that subsequently a number of related joint ventures backed by
Japanese firms were established in China.
</P>
<P>
By October 1999, nine Japanese firms had invested in more than
50 household appliance companies in China, according to Beijing
Center of Japan External Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
The great success of the Japanese aroused the attention of many
entrepreneurs in the U.S. and Europe, and they began to conduct
market research on the changing consumption habits in China,
especially in the areas of foods and hi-tech items.

NANJING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Yao Wangshi, an 80-year-old woman
in Shuangmiao Village in east China's Jiangsu Province, spent the
first 60 years of her life using only salty water to clean her
teeth.
</P>
<P>
Yao brushed her teeth for the first time only 20 years ago, she
said, because that was the first time she could afford dental care
products.
</P>
<P>
Yao regarded this change in daily habits as the result of
improving living standards, which were due to the introduction of
China's reform and opening-up policy in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
"Every adult and child in Shuangmiao Village brush their teeth
now," Yao said.
</P>
<P>
It took decades for Chinese people to gradually replace
traditional dental care methods with the use of toothbrushes and
toothpaste.
</P>
<P>
In China's infant and primary schools today, courses on oral
hygiene are among those required of everyone, and toothbrushes and
toothpaste are so common in both rural and urban areas that if
anyone fails to brush their teeth, they are usually perceived as
having poor hygiene habits.
</P>
<P>
This change in oral hygiene care has made it possible for the
establishment of the world's largest toothbrush manufacturer in
the city of Yangzhou in east China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
The Sanxiao Group, a private business set up in 1989, turned
out one billion toothbrushes last year, earning 1.5 billion yuan
in output value. Sanxiao now has 72 percent of the toothbrush
market in China, and also exports its products to more than 50
countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
Han Guoping, president of the Sanxiao Group, says that the
decision to establish the group was based on estimates that
Chinese people will pay more attention to oral hygiene now that
they are living a better life.
</P>
<P>
In the market economy, the key for enterprise success is to
create new businesses to meet the potential demand of the changing
market, Han points out.

<HEADLINE> Smog Kills 5,000 in Canada Annually: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Smog affects 20 million Canadians
and causes 5,000 premature deaths every year, a toll higher than
car accidents or breast cancer, Canadian Environment Commissioner
Richard Smith said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a report to the Commons, the environment commissioner said
smog kills more Canadians compared with breast cancer, which
causes 4,946 deaths annually, or prostate cancer, which claims 3,
622 each year.
</P>
<P>
It is also more deadly than either motor vehicle accidents or
malignant melanoma, which kill an annual 3,622 and 665
respectively, according to the commissioner.
</P>
<P>
He warned of an increasing number of vehicles eroding air
improvements achieved in the country over the past three decades.
</P>
<P>
"Overall, what we're seeing is an erosion of past gains and
people are seeing the problem is even more serious than we thought
10 years ago," he said.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Environment Minister David Anderson also stated
Tuesday that he is negotiating with provinces on a national
strategy to control air pollutants.

<HEADLINE> Barthez on Brink to Join Man United </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 30 (Xinhua) -- French World Cup-winning goalkeeper
Fabien Barthez is expected to be confirmed as a Manchester United
player on Wednesday following his big-money transfer from Monaco.
</P>
<P>
Barthez completed his medical for United on Tuesday afternoon
before jetting back to join his country's Euro 2000 squad.
</P>
<P>
The Frenchman was taken to the Alexandra private hospital in
Cheadle at lunchtime and returned to Old Trafford for further
tests before leaving the ground in a club car after three more
hours.
</P>
<P>
He later headed to the airport and is not now set to return to
Old Trafford until pre-season training starts in July - providing
there are no problems with the medicals.
</P>
<P>
The fee is estimated between 8 million and 10 million pounds
and could therefore be a world record for a goalkeeper, and the
Monaco ace has reportedly agreed a six-year contract worth 45,000
pounds-a-week.
</P>
<P>
United manager Sir Alex Ferguson said: "The first thing which
attracted me to Fabien is that he is an outstanding goalkeeper.
But after Peter Schmeichel we needed a little bit more than that."
</P>
<P>
"Peter had a great presence and a wonderful personality which
rubbed off on the rest of the team. Mark Bosnich and Raimond van
der Gouw are both terrific goalkeepers - but neither have quite
the personality which Schmeichel possessed," he said. "But Fabien
has.He is a real character. He's bouncy and bubbly, just like
Schmeichel was, and hopefully he is going to have a similar
influence on the rest of the team."
</P>
<P>
When Schmeichel quit United last summer Ferguson almost
captured the flamboyant Barthez then only for the deal to collapse.
</P>
<P>
He instead signed Bosnich, who has had a difficult season and
whose future must now be in grave doubt.
</P>
<P>
Also certainly on the way out is Italian Massimo Taibi, shipped
back home on loan with Reggina after a catalogue of embarrassing
mistakes following his 4.5 million pounds move from Venezia.
</P>
<P>
United finished the season with the dependable van der Gouw in
goal. But the Dutchman is approaching the end of his career, and
there was a clear need for a more reliable goalkeeper than Bosnich
or Taibi turned out to be.
</P>
<P>
Ferguson had hoped to keep details of Barthez's transfer under
wraps until the goalkeeper had completed his medical tests.
</P>
<P>
He was desperate to avoid a repeat of the embarrassment he
suffered when Ruud van Nistelrooy's 18 million pounds move from
PSV Eindhoven was called off after the striker failed his medical.
</P>
<P>
The United boss said: "Medicals these days are very thorough
because of the amount of money involved. But there are no worries
about Barthez's fitness, and I am confident we will be given the
go-ahead by the doctors to complete the transfer."

<HEADLINE> Museum to Showcase Red Army Slogans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The city of Liuyang in central
China's Hunan Province is planning the construction of a museum to
house a collection of slogans used by the Chinese Red Army in the
1920s and 1930s.
</P>
<P>
Liuyang, situated in northeastern Hunan, was the main site of
the Autumn Harvest Uprising, an armed uprising led by Comrade Mao
Zedong in 1927 along the Hunan-Jiangxi border. The uprising marked
the Party's independence as a revolutionary army.
</P>
<P>
The slogans, written on walls of several century-old houses,
feature subjects ranging from the building of the Red Army and
land policies, to the management of household registration. They
serve as evidence that the Communist Party of China led the broad
masses of the Chinese people in their long struggles.
</P>
<P>
The number of these slogans has decreased from 1,600 in the mid
1980s to a present 300 due to the collapse of the old houses and a
lack of protection, said a local cultural official.
</P>
<P>
To better protect these historical artifacts, experts suggest
that all the remaining slogans be cut from the old houses and be
kept together in museum. Detailed background information will
also be prepared to go along with each piece.
</P>
<P>
A group of specialists from the state cultural protection
departments based in Beijing will be sent to this south Chinese
city to offer technical advice for the cutting of the slogans.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Jamie Redknapp and Ray Parlour are
out of Euro 2000, England soccer team manager Kevin Keegan said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Keegan announced that the midfielders would not be fit in time
for the tournament and are thus out of the reckoning for his final
squad of 22, which will be announced Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
"Sadly both players, having had a scan, will not be available
for Euro 2000," said Keegan
</P>
<P>
"I have had to rule them out but I really hope they can be
available to me again for the friendly against France in September
and the World Cup qualifiers," he said.
</P>
<P>
The news is certainly a huge blow for Redknapp, who has started
four games under Keegan - including both play-off ties against
Scotland and a goal-scoring display against Belgium - and has
become a regular in the squad when available.
</P>
<P>
Redknapp said: "I have seen a specialist who has told me that I
really need to rest my knee during the coming month or so - so my
hopes of making the Euro 2000 squad are over."
</P>
<P>
"Obviously I'm very disappointed but considering the time I was
out during last season, I was delighted that Kevin Keegan
originally named me in his 28," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I spoke to him today and thanked him for the opportunity. I
also asked him to wish the lads all the best for the summer. I
will spend the next few weeks as a diehard England supporter and
will then concentrate on getting myself fully fit so that I can
play my part in helping Liverpool in their challenge for next
season's Premiership title," Redknapp added.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Scotland defeated Ireland 2-1 in a
soccer friendly match in Dublin on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Everton striker Don Hutchison became the hero of the match,
scoring one goal and creating the other during the play.
</P>
<P>
Hutchison, recently transfer listed by his club after failing
to agree a new contract, capped a fine individual performance by
popping up on his own goalline to block a shot by Robbie Keane as
Ireland pressed for an equalizer in the closing seconds.
</P>
<P>
Ireland were without Manchester United captain Roy Keane and a
number of other regulars and were outplayed in midfield by a neat
passing Scotland team.
</P>
<P>
Victory for Scotland over their neighbors from across the Irish
Sea means they have now won three of seven matches played between
the two teams, Ireland having won two and the other two resulting
in draws.
</P>
<P>
Both sides failed to qualify for this summer's Euro 2000
tournament and are seeking to prepare for World Cup qualifying
campaigns beginning this autumn.

<HEADLINE> Wales Bid for FA Cup Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The Welsh Assembly is being urged to
lobby for the FA Cup final to be staged in Cardiff, according to
local reports on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Assembly Member Alun Cairns believes the 72,000-seat Millennium
Stadium is a prime location to host the cup during the
reconstruction of Wembley Stadium.
</P>
<P>
The massive 475 million pounds Wembley project is not due for
completion for three years, with several competitions - including
football's Worthington Cup - needing temporary grounds.
</P>
<P>
Cairns has asked Tom Middlehurst, the Assembly Secretary
responsible for sport, what he is doing to attract the game to the
Millennium Stadium.
</P>
<P>
Cardiff has also been mentioned as a possible venue for the
Division One, Two and Three play-offs.
</P>
<P>
There are also hopes that the Millennium Stadium could host a
European soccer final and the Charity Shield this August, the
traditional curtain-raiser played between the Premiership and FA
Cup winners.
</P>
<P>
UEFA, European soccer's ruling body, has already given the
stadium its highest, five-star rating.
</P>
<P>
This puts the ground on a par with grounds such as the Nou Camp
in Barcelona and the San Siro in Milan.
</P>
<P>
However, there have been reports that the English Football
Association is reluctant to move its showpiece game outside
England.
</P>
<P>
Other grounds said to be in the running for the Cup final
include Old Trafford, Manchester United's ground, Twickenham, the
home of English Rugby, and Aston Villa's stadium, Villa Park.
</P>
<P>
There were complaints that the surface of the Millennium
Stadium was unsuitable for football when Wales played their first
international there against Finland in March.
</P>
<P>
But its prospects should have improved when the surface was
noticeably better for the Wales-Brazil game - the first soccer
international to be played under a closed roof.
</P>
<P>
And the stadium has already been chosen as the venue for Wales'
football team to play their future home international matches.

<HEADLINE> England Rest Owen and Wise in Soccer Friendly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 30 (Xinhua) -- England manager Kevin Keegan has
decided to pull Michael Owen and Dennis Wise out of Wednesday's
Wembley friendly against Ukraine because of "slight" back injuries.
</P>
<P>
Keegan confirmed Real Madrid star Steve McManaman would start
and Liverpool midfielder Steven Gerrard is also likely to make his
full debut.
</P>
<P>
The manager also revealed that Gerrard's Liverpool team-mate
Jamie Redknapp and Arsenal midfielder Ray Parlour are to have
scans on knee injuries.
</P>
<P>
"Jamie Redknapp and Ray Parlour are at this moment in time
being scanned," Keegan said.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone trained on Tuesday morning, with the exception of
Michael Owen and Dennis Wise - both have got slightly sore backs,"
he said. "It's nothing serious, just as a precaution I've pulled
them out. Certainly I won't consider those two for the game."
</P>
<P>
Keegan, who has yet to announce his team, said: "Certainly
Steven Gerrard and Steve McManaman will play. They are the only
two who know they are playing."
</P>
<P>
"Everything I've seen about Gerrard tells me he will shine at
international level. Steve McManaman will be given an absolute
free role, I think he deserves that opportunity," he added.
</P>
<P>
"I've always asked him to do something a bit different for
England. I may well ask him again in Euro 2000 to do something
different, but for the Ukraine game I'm going to say to him go on
and do what you have done for Madrid for the last six to eight
weeks. And we'll work around you. Macca has earned that right,"
said the manager.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 31 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Wednesday recommended the extension of the mandate of the
United Nations Peacekeeping Force In Cyprus (UNFICYP) for a
further period of six months until December 15, 2000.
</P>
<P>
In his report, Annan said that during the past six months, the
situation along the cease-fire lines had remained stable and the
UNFICYP had continued to carry out its mandate tasks with the
cooperation of both sides.
</P>
<P>
"Two positive developments are worth noting. One is the
increase in contacts between Greek and Turkish Cypriots, which are
an important factor in improving the political climate on the
island," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"The other development is the welcome decision by the Turkish
Cypriot authorities to lift unnecessary onerous measures affecting
visits to the Greek Cypriot in the north," Annan noted.
</P>
<P>
Under the current circumstances, the presence of the UNFICYP on
the island remained indispensable for the maintenance of the cease-
fire between the two sides, Annan added.
</P>
<P>
The UNFICYP was set up in 1964.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Renews U.N. Mission in W. Sahara </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Wednesday adopted a resolution to extend the mandate of the U.N.
Mission in Western Sahara (MINURSO) for two months, hoping that
relevant parties would agree on specific proposals to hold the
long-delayed referendum.
</P>
<P>
Namibia voted against the draft resolution while two other
member states, Mali and Jamaica, voted in abstentions.
</P>
<P>
The resolution was adopted by the 15 Council members after
they met in a closed-door session on Tuesday to consider a report
by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who, in his report to the
Security Council last Tuesday, called on Morocco and the Polisario
Front to come up with specific solutions to problems that have
delayed a referendum on the future of Western Sahara for more than
eight years.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council decides to extend the mandate of MINURSO
until July 31," the resolution said, "with the expectation that
the parties will offer the Secretary-General's Personal Envoy
specific and concrete proposals that can be agreed to in order to
resolve the multiple problems relating to the implementation of
the Settlement Plan."
</P>
<P>
Or, the parties will "be prepared to consider ways to achieve
an early, durable and agreed resolution to their dispute over
Western Sahara," the resolution said.
</P>
<P>
The current mandate of MINURSO expires on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Annan, in his report, said face-to-face talks held on May 14
in London under the auspices of his special envoy, former U.S.
Secretary of State James Baker, only reinforced the U.N.
assessment of "their widely divergent positions."
</P>
<P>
Also, "neither side offered any constructive suggestions on
the way forward" at their first direct talks conducted by Baker
since 1997, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has long been trying to organize a
referendum to decide whether Western Sahara should be incorporated
in Morocco, which controls most of the former Spanish colony, or
become independent, as sought by the Polisario Front.
</P>
<P>
But the referendum, first set for January 1992, has been
repeatedly postponed due to differences over who should be
eligible to vote.

UNITED NATIONS, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Security
Council Wednesday decided to extend the mandate of the United
Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) for another six
months until November 30, 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council called upon the parties concerned to
implement immediately its resolutions 338 of 1973.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council requested the Secretary-General to submit,
at the end of this period, a report on the development in the
situation and the measures taken to implement resolution 338.
</P>
<P>
In a related presidential statement, the Security Council noted
that despite the present quiet in the Israeli-Syrian sector, the
situation in the Middle East continues to be potentially dangerous
and is likely to remain so unless and until a comprehensive
settlement covering all aspects of the Middle East problem can be
reached.
</P>
<P>
The UNDOF, established in May 1974, was aimed to supervise the
cease-fire and the agreement on disengagement between Israeli and
Syrian forces.

<P>
ATHENS, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Greece's Coalition of the Left
party Wednesday criticized the ongoing NATO military exercise "
Dynamic Mix 2000," which is now taking place in Greece.
</P>
<P>
In an announcement issued Wednesday, the left-wing political
party said that the exercise was part of the "new role" of NATO's
presence in the Balkan region, inaugurated with last year's war
against Yugoslavia, which did not promote stability in the region
but, on the contrary, undermine it.
</P>
<P>
The party also accused NATO of watching ethnic cleasing being
carried out against the Serbs in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo
with indifference.
</P>
<P>
Dynamic Mix 2000, which began on May 20 and will end on June
10, involves more than 10,000 soldiers from the U.S. and another
10 NATO countries, 65 navy vessels and 293 warplanes.
</P>

It is NATO's largest exercise this year and is the first
practical application of the alliance's new structure.

<P>
That council determined Wednesday to transfer the discussion of
the Peruvian electoral crisis to the Dialogue of Foreign Ministers
to be held before the upcoming OAS General Assembly, foreseen for
June 6 and 7 in Windsor, Canada.
</P>
<P>
This agreement was approved by consensus after the United
States withdrew, for lack of support, a proposal for the Peruvian
crisis to be discussed at the Windsor meeting and "within the
range of OAS Resolution 1080" which imposes sanctions on the
countries that violate constitutional order.
</P>
<P>
Sandoval said at a press conference that "the firm and clear
position" of the Latin American countries "forced the United
States to withdraw its proposal for the matter to be discussed at
the General Assembly."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. position, seconded by Costa Rica, received the support
of 15 of the 34 ambassadors of the countries that form the
Permanent Council, while the majority of the Latin American
countries abstained from backing it up.
</P>
<P>
The Peruvian elections were held Sunday without the
participation of opposition candidate Alejandro Toledo, and with
the absence of the international observers, who withdrew several
hours before the start of the process, for which the opposition
consider them illegitimate.
</P>
<P>
Toledo, the candidate of the Peru Posible coalition, refused to
take part in the voting because he considered that he was
dispossessed of the triumph in the first round held on April 9
through "fraud," and that there would be another in the second
round.
</P>
<P>
The election was held in the middle of uncertainty, and the
Electoral Processes National Office said that by the time that 99,
78 percent of the votes cast had been computed (11,779,504 votes),
Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori had obtained 51.22 percent of
the suffrages.
</P>
<P>
Toledo had 17.68 percent, and the null or vitiated votes
represented 29.83 percent, and blank ballots 1.19 percent.

<HEADLINE> COE Member States Urged to Implement European Court Rulings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Greece and Cyprus Wednesday called
on all Council of Europe (COE) member states to implement the
European Court of Human Rights rulings.
</P>
<P>
"All COE member states have a legal obligation to fully
implement the European Court of Human Rights decisions," the Greek
Foreign Ministry said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that in the opposite case the convention on
human rights and relevant international law regulations were
violated and as a result a huge problem was created because the
principles, the institution and the credibility of the COE was
shattered.
</P>
<P>
Greece's Alternate Foreign Minister Elizabeth Papazoi and
Cyprus Attorney General Alecos Markides Wednesday chaired a
meeting in Athens to coordinate the two countries' efforts so that
the court decision in the case of Greek Cypriot Titina Loizidou
against Turkey is implemented.
</P>
<P>
In December 1996, The European Court ruled that Turkey is
guilty of violating Loizidou's human rights to enjoy peacefully
her property in the Turkish occupied part of Cyprus and be allowed
to access to it.
</P>
<P>
The court also ordered Turkey to pay some 900,000 U.S. dollars
in compensation for Loizidou.

<HEADLINE> Paraguay Lifts State of Siege </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The Paraguayan government
lifted Wednesday the state of siege in force in the country since
the frustrated coup attempt which occurred on May 18.
</P>
<P>
The measure was voided by a decree of President Luis Gonzalez
Macchi, which said that the order and tranquillity in all the
national territory has been reestablished.
</P>
<P>
The state of siege was decreed for a one-month period in the
national territory on the early morning of May 19, when a group of
military personnel and civilians, allegedly followers of former
General Lino Oviedo, rose up in arms to topple the Macchi regime.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 civilians and military men were detained by the
government after the coup attempt that was suffocated six hours
later by the government, according to reports from Asuncion, the
capital of that country.

<HEADLINE> Argentines Demonstrate Against IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Tens of thousands of
Argentines concentrated Wednesday in the Plaza de Mayo, across
from the Government House, to demonstrate against the government
adjustment policy and to reject the presence of an International
Monetary Fund (IMF) mission in the country.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration was called by the dissident General Workers
Federation (CGT), which was joined by the members of the labor
unions of state public servants, students associations, teachers,
justice workers, and small and medium businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Leader of the dissident CGT Hugo Moyano denounced to some of
the "international powers" for "killing" children and retired
workers.
</P>
<P>
Moyano said "we are ready to do whatever effort is necessary to
defeat the
financial dictatorship," and announced a general strike on June 9.
</P>
<P>
An IMF mission arrived Tuesday night in the country to monitor
the compliance with the budget targets agreed on by the Argentine
government with the international entity.
</P>
<P>
The Argentine government announced Monday a package of
adjustment measures, with a reduction of public servants' salaries
and retirement funds as the nucleus, to reduce the budget deficit.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Fall Mostly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks fell mostly
Wednesday despite the several encouraging economic reports that
show a slowdown in the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 4.80 at 10,522.33.
The blue chip index rose 227.89 points Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The technology heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 58.57 at 3,400.
91, trimming its biggest percentage gain in the previous session.
The composite rose 254.37 points or 7.94 percent Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also lower mostly. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index fell 1.85 at 1,420.60.
</P>
<P>
Stocks moved up and down and finally closed lower in a volatile
market as investors viewed signs of slower economic growth with
skepticism. The Conference Board said in a report that the Index
of Leading Economic Indicators, a key gauge of future economic
activities, dipped 0.1 percent in April after a 0.1 percent
increase in March.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Purchasing Management Association of Chicago
said in a separate report that the group's index of area business
activity fell to 53.9 in May from 56.5 in April. The Commerce
Department also reported that sales of new homes tumbled 5.8
percent in April, marking the largest decline since last September.
</P>
<P>
The three reports were encouraging. But investors did not
believe that the new data would encourage the Federal Reserve to
end the circle of interest rate increase.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve has raised rates six times since last June
in an effort to cool off the economy and keep inflation under
control. The rate hikes have hit the stock market heavily.
</P>
<P>
Investors sold some of the tech stocks that rose Tuesday. Banks
and brokerages were mostly higher.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index rose 2.22 at 643.60 and the American Stock
Exchange index rose 7.12 at 904.97. But the Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies fell 0.55 at 476.18.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,715 up, 1,290 down and 439
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume increased to 950.32 million shares from 835.26
million in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> Schroeder Launches Expo 2000 World Fair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOVER, Germany, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The world's largest fair
was launched here Wednesday evening when German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder called for a "more open world" as the Expo 2000 would
present.
</P>
<P>
Giving a speech to some 3,000 guests celebrating the fair, the
German chancellor said the world must be more tolerant and open in
an era full of new scientific findings and technical breakthroughs.
</P>
<P>
"A closed society must block the development of itself and the
whole world," he said, adding the Expo 2000 should show a "really
tolerant and world-open Germany."
</P>
<P>
"We all, and especially the Germans, must become
internationals," he said.
</P>
<P>
For 10 years, Germany has planned this "project of image"
since it reunited, according to Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
"Many have changed in this decade, not only with us, but also
in the total world, " he said. "The Expo 2000 is a great
exhibition to show these rapid changes with all of their sequences.
"
</P>
<P>
The Expo 2000 has no new topic, but it will show "the best of
cultures in more than 170 countries and regions, from the latest
findings in science to traditional arts," said the Deutsche Messe
AG which organized the fair.
</P>
<P>
"Humankind, nature, and technology" in the world are what the
Expo 2000 wants to present its 250,000 expected visitors Thursday
when it first opens the door to the public.
</P>
<P>
Besides striking and differently-styled national pavilions,
the fair also constructed a cultural-focused "Theme Park," where a
"Faust Hall" was left for the most famous German poem by Johan
Wolfgang von Goethe.
</P>
<P>
Expo chief Brigit Breuel hoped the Expo 2000 would be able to
compare with another world fair at the beginning of last century,
the World Fair in Paris in 1900.
</P>
<P>
Totally, the Mess AG projected over 40 million visitors from
all over the world in the coming 153 days, and a press official
told Xinhua more than 15,000 reporters had registered to cover the
fair.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Files Final Arguments Against Breakup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Microsoft Corp. Wednesday filed
its final legal brief in a landmark antitrust battle, offering a
rebuttal to the government's revised plan to break it up.
</P>
<P>
The company also offered testimony from several executives of
other companies, who share its belief that a breakup would be
injurious to Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
The company's filing, which came after the financial markets
closed in the east, included revisions to the government's breakup
proposal. Microsoft spokesman Jim Cullinan said the new changes "
were designed to correct the ambiguity and vagueness" of the
government's plan.
</P>
<P>
"When an injunction is so vague and ambiguous that it 'defies
comprehension,' it is void and unenforceable," Microsoft told
District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who ruled early last month
that Microsoft repeatedly violated the U.S. antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department and 17 of the 19 states that sued
Microsoft for antitrust violations recommended last month that the
company be broken into two pieces, one that would own and market
the Windows operating systems, and the other that would control
all other Microsoft software, including the popular Office suite
and the company's Internet holdings.
</P>
<P>
Jackson had given the government until last Friday to issue its
revised plan, and two business days for Microsoft to respond. A
ruling could come any time after Jackson received Microsoft's
response.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft has vehemently opposed the government's proposal to
split the company into two competing entities, saying that it
would appeal any such breakup, which would extend the legal fight
for months, if not years.

<HEADLINE> U.N. to Assess Response to Crisis in Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Spokesman Fred Eckhard said the team headed by Gen. Manfred
Eisele, formerly U.N. assistant secretary-general for peacekeeping
operations, was scheduled to leave New York Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.N. Mission in Sierra Leone, known as the
UNAMSIL, reported from Freetown that the military situation
throughout the west African country was relatively quiet with no
fighting between U.N. peacekeepers and rebel fighters belonging to
the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) for the last 10 days.
</P>
<P>
The RUF abducted more than 500 U.N. peacekeepers in early May.
Under the international pressure, it has released most of the U.N.
detainees, but is still surrounding more than 250 U.N. staff.
Negotiations are ongoing to restore U.N. personnel's freedom of
movement, according to Eckhard.
</P>
<P>
The UNAMSIL has increased its strength to 11,280 up to
Wednesday with more reinforcements to follow.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has called for a total of 16,
500 U.N. troops or more to ensure peace and the democratic process
in Sierra Leone.
