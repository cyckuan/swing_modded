FESTIVAL FOCUSES ON FAMILY, CULTURE

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Emphasizing family, community and culture, the
seven-day Kwanzaa celebration that began Sunday leads
African-Americans through a deeply reflective week where family and
philosophy overshadow presents.
</P>
<P>
   The few gifts that grace the traditional Kwanzaa table in
celebrants' homes are highly symbolic: books and heritage symbols
showing appreciation for ancient African culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the heart of our celebration of Kwanzaa is the practice of
pausing and turning inward as persons and a people and thinking
deeply about the wonder and obligation of being African in the
world,'' said Maulana Karenga in his annual message.
</P>
<P>
   Karenga founded the celebration in 1966 as a black studies
professor at California State University, Long Beach. The festival
has grown in popularity and is now celebrated by more than 28
million people around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Kwanzaa ends Jan. 1 with a feast on the Day of Meditation, a
period of self-questioning that ideally should last throughout the
coming year, which according to the ancient Egyptian calendar is
the year 6240, according to Karenga.
</P>
<P>
   Though a relatively new cultural celebration, Kwanzaa draws on
ancient winter agricultural festivals marking the harvesting of
crops and sharing of good fortune.
</P>
<P>
   A modern-day emphasis on the environment preserves that legacy,
with some Kwanzaa observers using the occasion to clean up their
neighborhoods, parks or beaches, said Chimbuko Tembo of Us, the
nonprofit African-American cultural center which Karenga chairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a time we stop and take particular appreciation for all
the beauty we have around us in terms of creation and other
people,'' Tembo said. ``It's not a religious holiday, so people who
are followers of traditional African religions ... black Jews or
Muslims can all come together around our African-ness.''
</P>
<P>
   Kwanzaa, which means ``first fruits'' in Swahili, honors seven
principles: unity, self-determination, collective work and
responsibility, cooperative economics, purpose, creativity and
faith.
</P>
<P>
   Families mark the occasion with five activities, including
reinforcing their bonds, commemorating the past, recommitting to
cultural ideals and celebrating the good life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody of goodwill can certainly appreciate the aspects of
Kwanzaa,'' Tembo said.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional symbols of Kwanzaa are set up on a table that is
first covered with a straw mat symbolizing the foundations of
African culture.
</P>
<P>
   Fruits and vegetables represent crops and the rewards of
collective labor, she said.
</P>
<P>
   A candleholder symbolizes people who continue to live in Africa
and the seven candles represent the seven principles. Ears of corn
are laid out to symbolize children, and a unity cup honoring
ancestors is used to pour libations. Last, the table contains gifts
of books and heritage symbols.
</P>
<P>
   Kwanzaa, an African-American cultural celebration that runs from
Dec. 26 through Jan. 1, honors one of the following seven
principles, translated from Swahili, each night, with the lighting
of a candle:
</P>
<P>
   Umoja _ unity
</P>
<P>
   Kujichagulia _ self-determination
</P>
<P>
   Ujima _ collective work and responsibility
</P>
<P>
   Ujamaa _ cooperative economics
</P>
<P>
   Nia _ purpose
</P>
<P>
   Kuumba _ creativity
</P>
<P>
   Imani _ faith

ROENICK GETS EARLY PENALTIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Phoenix captain Keith Tkachuk missed Sunday night's game with
back spasms. That made it even more surprising when the Kings were
able to dupe the Coyotes' leading scorer, Jeremy Roenick, into two
five-minute fighting penalties in the first period.
</P>
<P>
   The first came 4:18 into the game when Roenick and fourth-line
winger Dan Bylsma tangled in the Kings' end. The second came with
2:35 left and involved Len Barrie along the left boards.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings will never mind losing Bylsma, a healthy scratch most
of the season, and Barrie, a minor league call-up playing on the
fourth line, if they can get a player of Roenick's status out of
the game.
</P>
<P>
   Barrie, a scorer throughout his minor-league career, played five
weeks on the Kings' first line when Jozef Stumpel was sidelined
with a hernia. Stumpel returned Wednesday and Barrie has been moved
back to the fourth line.
</P>
<P>
   Roenick centers the Coyotes' first line, usually a finesse
position. But he leads the team with 64 penalty minutes. Ian
Laperriere, center on the Kings' third line, or enforcer line,
leads the NHL with 115 penalty minutes. This includes two 10-minute
misconduct penalty and a five-minute major penalty early in the
second period.
</P>
<P>
   But Roenick, who leads the Coyotes with 17 goals and 43 points,
is known for his physical play as well. Earlier this season, he was
suspended five games for slashing Chicago's Tony Amonte.
</P>
<P>
   Berg out: The Kings continued to shuffle their defensive
pairings after Aki Berg was sidelined with a rib injury in
Wednesday's 2-1 loss at San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Berg's place on the active roster was taken by Jere Karalahti,
who received his first NHL point when he assisted on Laperriere's
first-period goal.
</P>
<P>
   Berg had played two of his better games last week in place of
injured captain Rob Blake (groin). His effectiveness was limited
against San Jose because of the rib injury.
</P>
<P>
   Jaroslav Modry, a frequent healthy scratch this season, was
active in place of Garry Galley, who has missed two games with a
concussion.!dlim!!end!

 By JOHN McCLAIN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ For only the third time in franchise history,
the Tennessee Titans proved they are legitimate Super Bowl
contenders with the talent, confidence and momentum to become
champions.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Titans won't know until the playoffs if they can succeed
where the Houston Oilers failed during the Luv Ya Blue and
run-and-shoot eras, but if Sunday's powerful performance against
Jacksonville was an indication, Tennessee could be a team of
destiny.
</P>
<P>
   A three-point underdog in their home stadium, the Titans
annihilated the Jaguars 41-14 to sweep their AFC Central series and
improve their record to 12-3 entering the last game at Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans have defeated Jacksonville, the AFC's best team,
twice. And they beat St. Louis, the best team in the NFC.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said we had to take the next step, and we did, but we've
still got a long way to go to accomplish our goal,'' Titans coach
Jeff Fisher said. ``As a coach, you wish all games were like this,
but you know most of them aren't. It was a total team effort
against the best team in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Steve McNair was the Titan most responsible for
Sunday's domination of the team that entered the game with the
NFL's best record and No. 2 defense. Healthy for the first time
since the opening game, McNair threw a career-high five touchdown
passes _ one fewer than his season total _ and embarrassed the
league's second-ranked pass defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our defense was very poor,'' Jaguars coach Tom Coughlin said.
``We had no pass rush. We didn't stop the run. He was very much
under control, and he did what he wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   McNair, who had been hampered by an ankle injury, completed 23
of 33 passes for 291 yards and touchdowns to tight end Mike Roan
(four yards), tight end Jackie Harris (62), receiver Yancey Thigpen
(two), receiver Isaac Byrd (65) and receiver Kevin Dyson (13).
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you get beat like this, it's embarrassing,'' Jaguars
offensive tackle Tony Boselli said. ``They answered the bell and
beat us to the punch. They just blew us out.''
</P>
<P>
   McNair didn't throw an interception, and he was not sacked by a
defense that entered the game leading the NFL in sacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just the tip of the iceberg for Steve,'' said running
back Eddie George, who contributed 102 yards rushing to the
season-high 476-yard performance. ``He couldn't have had a better
day against a great defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve was phenomenal after experiencing so much media
scrutiny. He never lost his composure, and I think you'll see him
have more days like this.''
</P>
<P>
   The Titans watched their quarterback put the ``Air'' back in
McNair against a defense that had been dubbed ``Dare McNair''
because the strategy was designed to stop the run and force him to
throw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't offended by that strategy, but it did present more of
a challenge,'' said McNair, who underwent back surgery early in the
season and suffered a badly sprained ankle when he returned. ``A
lot of teams have been daring us to throw the ball, and we haven't
been successful. Our passing game has struggled a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Sunday, when the Titans improved their AFC Central record
to 8-1.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee's defense knocked out quarterback Mark Brunell and
limited the Jaguars to 237 yards. The Jaguars trailed 17-7 when
Brunell left the game late in the second quarter with a sprained
medial collateral ligament in his left knee. He will undergo a
magnetic resonance imaging test to determine the extent of the
damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never want to see a player get hurt, but that did make a
difference in the second half,'' Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
   Brunell was 4-of-11 for 95 yards with an interception. Jay
Fiedler finished 8-of-22 for 101 yards with two interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Titans cornerback Samari Rolle intercepted three passes. The
Titans registered four sacks, giving them 53, breaking the team
record of 52 set in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee limited Jacksonville to 65 yards rushing, including 44
by Fred Taylor, who averaged 2.8 yards on 16 carries.
</P>
<P>
   ``By getting a big lead, we made them a one-dimensional
offense,'' Fisher said. ``When we got them down 24-7 at the half,
they couldn't give the ball to Taylor like they wanted because they
were forced to throw.''
</P>
<P>
   Adelphia Coliseum has become an impenetrable fortress for the
Titans, who finished the regular season 8-0 at home for the first
time in franchise history. A record crowd of 66,641 watched them
tie a franchise record with 12 victories.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans could finish 13-3 and not win the division, even
though they beat Jacksonville twice.
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars, who haven't beaten a team with a winning record,
will win the AFC Central with a 14-2 record if they defeat
Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   It's a long shot, but the Titans still have a chance to win the
AFC Central for the first time since 1993 and earn the home-field
advantage throughout the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   If the Titans win at Pittsburgh, the Bengals win at Jacksonville
and the Colts lose at Buffalo, Tennessee will win the division and
secure the home-field advantage. Realistically, the Titans will
finish as the wild-card team with the best record and host a
first-round game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any explanations for it,'' Coughlin said.
``Obviously, one team came to play and the other didn't. We were
physically handled on both fronts. We never challenged them, and
the game was never in doubt, and I'm very disappointed about it.''

CELTICS DROP 10TH STRAIGHT ON ROAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ We bring you the unofficial NBA Glossary for
Losses on the Road:
</P>
<P>
   Two consecutive losses is a ``snag''; four consecutive losses is
a ``skid''; six consecutive losses is a ``slump''; eight
consecutive losses is a ``problem''; and 10 consecutive losses is a
``crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics have a crisis.
</P>
<P>
   They opened their season with a road win at Toronto and have
lost 10 in a row since then. That means they have not won a road
game in the United States since spring. They have lost in Texas and
they have lost in Ohio. They have lost in Rick Pitino's hometown
(New York), Antoine Walker's hometown (Chicago), and Doug Overton's
college town (Philadelphia). Sunday, it was Paul Pierce's turn. He
left tickets for 30 of his closest friends at the new Staples
Center and, in the guard's West Coast hometown, the Celtics lost
again.
</P>
<P>
   The final was 103-100, Clippers. There wasn't necessarily a
reason for the defeat; ``reasons'' is more accurate. But when
Pitino stood in the visitors' locker room and stared at a stat
sheet, all he could talk about was the Celtics' defensive problems.
He didn't like the way they defended the Clippers' 3-point
shooting. He didn't like the way his team twice failed to box out
(``We gave them 6 points right there''), and he didn't like the way
his team approached 6-foot-9-inch, 260-pound forward Maurice
Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't guard Maurice Taylor,'' Pitino said, noting that
Taylor had 26 points. ``He killed us down the stretch (13
fourth-quarter points).''
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, when Pitino thought he was going to trade his
lottery picks in 1997, he flew Taylor into Greater Boston and
worked him out in Waltham. In other words, he knew the hefty man
from Michigan could make 17-foot jumpers with ease. That would have
been useful if the 6-foot Pitino was assigned to guard Taylor, but
that job went to 6-9 Antoine Walker (28 points).
</P>
<P>
   But that's not to say Walker was the only player whose man had a
good offensive night. It was a team-wide epidemic. That lack of
defense became a problem in the fourth quarter, which the Celtics
began leading by 8 points, 76-68. Less than five minutes later, the
game was tied when dynamic rookie Lamar Odom soared to the basket
for a dunk.
</P>
<P>
   It was a different game from then on, and not just because the
game was tied. It was different because the Celtics brought out
their Road Meltdown Kit: bad shots, bad defense, and bad
ballhandling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I took a few shots that shouldn't have been taken,''
said Pierce, playing for the first time in seven games (after a
sprained left ankle). ``I've got to learn from it; it's got to be a
learning experience for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Pierce had an interesting 34 minutes on the court, finishing
with 24 points, 7 assists, and 6 rebounds. He missed four of his
five 3-pointers and was 6 of 17 from the field. After the game, he
said that the game very easily could have been a 103-100 Celtics
win. Here's why it wasn't: The Celtics acted too late.
</P>
<P>
   With 71 seconds left, the Clippers led, 100-93. The announced
crowd of 12,039 was stunned when Walker dunked to make it 101-99,
Clippers, with 23.5 seconds left. Taylor then made a terrible pass
to reserve guard Charles Jones, the ball went out of bounds, and
Taylor _ with six seconds remaining _ fouled Tony Battie. The
center made one of two free throws and then watched as Walker was
forced to foul Troy Hudson (who made two freebies for a 103-100
advantage).
</P>
<P>
   So, there were the road-weary Celtics, in a position to tie the
game despite their sloppy play. They had just under five seconds
with which to work and they were obviously going to run a play for
Pierce or Dana Barros. They opted for Barros, who got a decent
straight-on shot from about 24 feet. He missed. Despite the return
of Pierce and Danny Fortson (``My timing on rebounds was way
off''), the Celtics lost on the road. Again.
</P>
<P>
   Is there a chance that this team has some type of geographic
phobia?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it had anything to do with the West Coast,''
Pitino said. ``It had to do with our inability to stop them. It had
nothing to do with East Coast-West Coast. We could be out in
Antarctica and it wouldn't matter. It's all about defense and
offense and execution.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans in LA were raving afterward about the performances of guys
named Nesby, Piatkowski, and Closs (a crowd favorite). All of them
played well, but they also had the fortune of playing against the
anti-Rand McNallys.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time for us to look ourselves in the mirror and learn how
to finish these games off,'' Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   That would be OK if the Celtics could look in the mirror and not
see their itinerary, which calls for two scary places: Sacramento
and Denver. Unfortunately, neither place has parquet and neither
place is Boston.

 By JAYNE CUSTRED  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
IT'S hard to imagine just where the time went. Without a single
major professional team before 1960, Houston has a busy, thriving
sports scene at the end of the century.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Building the Astrodome and changing the face of baseball took a
few years. Developing championship basketball teams took some more
time, as did the maturation of some of the greatest individual
athletes in a host of sports.
</P>
<P>
   But it seems like just yesterday that George Foreman was a buff
young man, getting ready for his first bout, and A.J. Foyt was
sliding behind the wheel of a race car for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Records were set, championships won, careers started and ended,
and Houston athletics continued to grow and change and prosper. And
now the future beckons, full of promise of things even grander and
greater for Houston sports fans.
</P>
<P>
   So with the new millennium upon us, here's a look back at 10 of
the Houston area's greatest sports memories and personalities.
</P>
<P>
   Inside and Artificial
</P>
<P>
   Nothing changed baseball more than the invention of AstroTurf
and the construction of the Astrodome, the world's first domed
stadium. Suddenly, neither rain nor snow nor sleet nor cold would
affect a baseball (or football) game, and plastic turf would give
athletes everywhere a level playing field. The brainchild of Judge
Roy Hofheinz, the ``Eighth Wonder of the World'' became an
attraction in its own right, and gave a new home to Houston's
major-league baseball team, the Astros. Although the Astrodome was
met with skepticism, it has become the model for domed stadiums
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Believe It
</P>
<P>
   Hakeem Olajuwon had long provided the thrill in Houston
basketball, first at the University of Houston and then for the
Rockets. But it wasn't until 1994 that the Dream would come true
for Houston basketball fans. Under the guidance of former Rockets
player Rudy Tomjanovich and led by an unstoppable Olajuwon, the
Rockets won back-to-back NBA titles in 1994 and 1995. In 1995, with
the midseason addition of Olajuwon's former UH teammate Clyde
Drexler, the Rockets swept the Orlando Magic in one of the dominant
performances in the history of the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Luv Ya Blue
</P>
<P>
   It began when the Oilers drafted running back Earl Campbell, who
ushered in Houston's love affair with its professional football
team that reached a fever pitch in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
Campbell thundered his way into the hearts of Houston fans and
stayed there, even though the Oilers never made it to the Super
Bowl. But by the early 1990s, the glow had worn off. At the 1993
Buffalo Bills-Oilers wild-card playoff game, the Oilers led 35-3
just minutes into the second half, but the Bills rallied for the
greatest comeback in NFL history, eventually winning 41-38 in
overtime. Four years later, owner Bud Adams would move the club to
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   No One Better
</P>
<P>
   The legend of Carl Lewis was born when he first stepped onto the
track at UH under the watchful eyes of coach Tom Tellez. An amazing
nine Olympic gold medals later, Lewis is simply the greatest track
and field athlete of all time. Beginning in 1981, Lewis won 65
consecutive long-jump titles, going 10 years without losing. Other
Houstonians have joined Lewis in bringing home Olympic gold,
including Mary Lou Retton in gymnastics and Tara Lipinski in figure
skating.
</P>
<P>
   Grand Upset
</P>
<P>
   It was on the floor of the Astrodome on Jan. 20, 1968, where a
college basketball game unlike any other ever seen was played
between No. 1-ranked UCLA and No. 2 Houston. UCLA, coached by the
legendary John Wooden, was known for its fast-break offense and
pressure defense. But the Cougars were ready to run as well, and
the game marked the emergence of the big-time college hoops we know
today. Elvin Hayes and UH beat UCLA 71-69.
</P>
<P>
   Oh So Close
</P>
<P>
   It was set up perfectly for the Astros to make their first trip
to the World Series. Leading the New York Mets 3-0 in Game 6 of the
1986 National League Championship Series, all the Astros had to do
was get three outs and the series would go to a seventh game. And
the Astros liked their chances with Cy Young Award winner Mike
Scott, who had beaten the Mets twice in the series, ready to pitch
that game. But the Mets rallied to send Game 6 into extra innings
and, despite a dramatic home run by Billy Hatcher in the 14th
inning, New York prevailed 7-6 in 16 innings to win the series. It
was one of the best playoff games in baseball history but a
frustrating result for a franchise that to this day has not won a
playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   Great George
</P>
<P>
   He was the ordained minister turned heavyweight champion who
captured the hearts of sports fans with his return to the top at
age 45. Foreman, the family man with the big appetite for
cheeseburgers, returned to the ring some 40 pounds heavier than his
original fighting weight. But that didn't slow him Nov. 5, 1994,
when he knocked out Michael Moorer, becoming the oldest man to win
a heavyweight crown in history. Twenty years after losing his title
to Muhammad Ali, Foreman was named Male Athlete of the Year. He
defended his title a year later against 26-year-old Axel Schulz,
then gave up the crown after refusing a rematch.
</P>
<P>
   The A.J. Way
</P>
<P>
   At the tender age of 26, the tough-talking Texan with the quick
temper was well on his way to making auto racing a mainstream
sport. He won his first Indianapolis 500 in 1961 and would take the
checkered flag at Indy a record three more times. In 1972, he added
the Daytona 500 to his list, running over anyone who got in his
way. The absolute need to finish first drove Foyt, who won his
fifth overall United States Auto Club crown in 1967 and was the
co-driver of the winning car in Europe's 24 Hours of Le Mans.
Refusing to give in to the wave of new technology sweeping the
sport, Foyt nevertheless continued to find ways to win until he
retired in 1993 to oversee a racing ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Running Wild
</P>
<P>
   It was the era of Phi Slama Jama, when Olajuwon and Drexler
joined forces to make University of Houston basketball the hottest
game in town. Their wide-open, high-scoring offense typified the
new athleticism of college hoops, thrilling fans in the process.
The Cougars dominated, charging to the Final Four three times and
to the final in 1983 and 1984. But Houston never brought home an
NCAA title _ the 1983 loss to North Carolina State on a shot at the
buzzer was especially hard to take _ but Phi Slama Jama made it
worth watching, win or lose.
</P>
<P>
   Shining Bright
</P>
<P>
   The birth of the WNBA brought a new team to Houston basketball,
and with the Comets it was nothing but championship basketball. In
the three years the league has been in existence, the Comets have
won the title each time. Led by two-time Most Valuable Player
Cynthia Cooper, the Comets have set the standard for all WNBA teams
with their gutsy play. Never was that more evident than in the 1999
season, when the Comets had to pull together after point guard Kim
Perrot, who had helped take them to two titles, succumbed to
cancer. This time around, Perrot's inspiration led the way.

BLOWN FIELD GOALS LEAVE PATRIOTS WIND-CHILLED

<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ It was garbage time in the most frustrating
of seasons. Nothing really mattered for the Patriots except pride,
playing the role of the spoiler, and finishing the season with a
winning record.
</P>
<P>
   It appears maintaining pride still may be possible, but playing
the spoiler and having a winning record no longer are possible
following a 13-10 overtime loss to the Buffalo Bills Sunday. It
dropped the Patriots to 7-8, their first sub-.500 mark since they
were 0-2 at the start of the 1996 season.
</P>
<P>
   The defense played very well, the offense (Drew Bledsoe's 101
passing yards were the worst in a game he started and finished
since his rookie season) sputtered, and Adam Vinatieri missed
another field goal(s) that could have won a game.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots played without wide receiver Terry Glenn, who
missed his first game of the season with the flu.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots fans became even more frustrated when Steve Christie
kicked a 23-yard field goal with 1:48 remaining in overtime, giving
the 10-5 Bills' playoff hopes life.
</P>
<P>
   Vinatieri had missed a 33-yarder for the win with six seconds
remaining in the game, a ball he badly mis-kicked. His attempt to
win the game in OT from 44 yards also fell short into a tough wind.
Vinatieri, who had made 22 of 26 field goals this season, was 1 for
4 on the day, and the final kicks were reminiscent of his 32-yarder
that hit the upright in Kansas City, which would have given the
Patriots the win and perhaps changed their disappointing season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt I didn't hit it well,'' said Vinatieri of the missed
chip shot in regulation. ``I feel like I toed it a little. I knew I
didn't hit it very good.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots won the OT toss and chose to take the ball, but
they were going against the wind. Coach Pete Carroll said ``the
wind had died down a bit. It was definitely a consideration, but we
felt that Troy (Brown) was having a great day returning the ball
and we thought we could get good field position.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots had a chance to win it late in the fourth quarter
when Bledsoe took a page out of the Doug Flutie book, scampering
for a 25-yard gain, the longest run of his career, to the Bills 17.
</P>
<P>
   New England tried centering the ball with a couple of runs up
the middle by Terry Allen, and let the clock run down to six
seconds before Vinatieri attempted what looked like a sure winner.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of Vinatieri's teammates were sympathetic, even given
the wind. Certainly not defensive end Willie McGinest.
</P>
<P>
   ``What elements?'' said McGinest. ``That's his job. It's Adam's
job to make those field goals. I wished he would have made them. We
all had to play in the elements. The defense's job is to stop them.
I guess 13 points was too many today. I can only speak for myself,
but everyone is responsible for what they do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to lose anything. It's something I'll never get used
to. I hope guys from this team remember this feeling. That's the
key. If guys think this is OK, we've got to get them out of here.
Guys who are here who are fighters, those are the guys I want to
play with.''
</P>
<P>
   While the defense did a fine job containing Flutie, it did allow
168 yards on the ground and 206 in the air. The Patriots had one of
their better days rushing as Allen gained 126 yards on 27 carries
(the Patriots had a season-high 158 yards in all) and went on a
14-yard touchdown run with 12:15 left in the fourth quarter. That
came after Chad Eaton had forced a fumble of running back Jonathan
Linton, recovered it, and ran it 30 yards before being pulled down
by Flutie at the 14. Allen busted up the middle virtually untouched
to give the Patriots a 10-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   There was some question whether Linton actually had fumbled, or
whether Eaton was down on the spot. The play was reviewed and the
call was upheld by referee Mike Carey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the runner down with his elbow. The ball was not visible
until he rolled over and then the ball was visible on his chest,''
said Carey.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that the replay didn't show anyone touching Eaton
until Flutie tackled him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I picked it up, I knew somebody had to touch me,'' said
Eaton. When told that it was Flutie who had tackled him, he said,
``Don't remind me of that.''
</P>
<P>
   In OT, the Patriots took control at their 33 and a couple of big
plays _ a 20-yard pass to Ben Coates and a 12-yard run by Allen _
got the ball to the Bills 31. An offside penalty on Buffalo got it
to the 26, from where Vinatieri's 44-yarder died just before the
goal post.
</P>
<P>
   The Bills took over at their 34 and drove to the Patriots 19
when Eric Moulds, after catching a 19-yard pass from Flutie, took a
helmet hit to the midsection by free safety Tony George, who had
replaced the injured Chris Carter (hamstring), and fumbled. Tedy
Bruschi recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tebucky (Jones) was in coverage, he slipped, and I looked back
to see Flutie eyeing the ball to Moulds,'' said George. ``I made my
break. He caught it but I put my hat on the ball and got it
loose.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots, who were held to a season-low 225 total net yards,
did nothing with that break.
</P>
<P>
   The Bills took control at their 42 and Flutie drove them.
Thurman Thomas broke their back with a 9-yard run to the New
England 6, from where the Bills kicked the winner.
</P>
<P>
   The teams played to a 3-3 tie in a boring first half marked by
offensive struggles. Vinatieri missed a 44-yarder in the first
quarter after a decent drive from the Patriots 31 to the Bills 26.
On the Bills' first possession, Christie kicked a 39-yarder to make
it 3-0. Vinatieri nailed a 38-yarder right before the end of the
half after the Patriots drove from their 35 to the Bills 15, the
big play a 29-yard pass from Bledsoe to Harold Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Patriots can hold on to the fact that they didn't
quit, what they don't have this morning is a winning record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully that affects a lot of guys,'' said McGinest. ``We're
not going out losing. We have to be at least 8-8. I don't think
we're surrounded by losers here.''

 By DALE ROBERTSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
IN less than a week, the new millennium is upon us. Although a lot
can happen in five days, it's unlikely anything of grand
consequence will, seeing as how the Rockets are lottery-bound, the
Astros have nobody left to trade and our as-of-yet unnamed NFL team
is roughly 1,000 days from its first kickoff.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But if Charles Barkley returns to play on one leg, or the Astros
decide Jeff Bagwell is expendable, too, I reserve the right to
amend the following, a final accounting, if you will, of the most
wonderful and the cruelest things to have occurred on the local
sports scene since the Brothers Allen made their way up Buffalo
Bayou some 164 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the smiley-face category, two lists follow. Why?
Because there are two distinct kinds of warm fuzzies to be
recognized from Houston's amazingly rich and storied past: those
that only made us shout, ``Yippee!'' and those that actually
altered the course of history, adding fresh brush strokes to
jockdom's Big Picture.
</P>
<P>
   Our 10 most significant sports moments:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1. Bud Adams and Lamar Hunt create the AFL  &LR; _ From that day
forward, Houston was officially a ``big-league'' city, but the real
importance of the event was that it ushered in the modern, golden
era of pro football, which is now our true national pastime. With
the advent of the American Football League, players' salary
escalation began, TV's role in the game mushroomed and the eventual
merging of the two leagues created the ultimate game, the Super
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2. The construction of the Astrodome  &LR; _ The ``Eighth Wonder of
the World'' became the planet's most famous, fabulous and
revolutionary sports venue. Suddenly, weather was removed from the
equation even in a reclaimed swamp like Houston.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 3. The invention of AstroTurf &LR;  _ Necessity was the mother of
invention, unfortunately. Outfielders couldn't see fly balls in the
Dome's blinding glare, and painting the glass panes killed the
grass. Plastic turf, odious though it might be in these retro
times, soon ``sprouted'' up everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 4. Warren McVea's receiving a football scholarship from the
University of Houston &LR;  _ A century after the Civil War, white kids
and a black kid would be teammates on a college football team in
Texas. All the dire, hateful predictions notwithstanding, the earth
did not cleave under the Cougars' cleats. Elvin Hayes and Don
Chaney soon joined the basketball program, and Houston entered the
20th century.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 5. The UH-UCLA basketball game &LR;  _ The Dome floor that night was
ground zero, the place where college hoops as we know the behemoth
today began. The Cougars' upset win was a bonus.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 6. The King-Riggs tennis match &LR;  _ Despite the many silly
trappings that surrounded Bobby Riggs' biggest hustle, Billie Jean
King's victory launched the tennis boom and changed the way the
world perceived women athletes. Such attitude adjustment shouldn't
have been necessary, of course, but it was.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 7. The Astros sign Nolan Ryan to a $1 million salary &LR;  _
Speaking of ground zero
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 8. The Carl Lewis-Tom Tellez partnership &LR;  _ Perhaps Carl Lewis
would have evolved into the greatest Olympic athlete of the century
no matter who coached him, but King Carl's decision to run for
Tellez at UH was where his glorious sprint, and leap, to global
icon status began.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 9. The birth of the Virginia Slims Tour at Houston Racquet
Club &LR;  _ Promoters laughed at Houston's Gladys Heldman when she
tried to convince them women should be paid to play tennis, so
Heldman started her own tour. Footnote: Upon her retirement this
year, Steffi Graf's career prize money had blown past $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 10. The '96 referendum  &LR; _ By approving the plan to fund new
baseball and football stadiums, voters kept the Astros in Houston,
made possible the NFL's return and, yes, moved Houston back to the
cutting edge in the sports facilities game. Name another city that
will possess two retractable-roof venues.

   &UR; 2. The Rockets' second NBA title &LR;  _ Nothing beats winning.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 3. The Rockets draft Hakeem Olajuwon  &LR; _ See above.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 4. The Oilers draft Earl Campbell  &LR; _ Campbell never got the
Oilers to the Super Bowl (those pesky Steelers kept getting in the
way), but he did enough to become the most beloved local jock hero
ever, Hakeem's own towering presence notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 5. Houston joins the National League  &LR; _ The Oilers predated the
Astros, but in those days you weren't really and truly a
major-league town until you had a major-league baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 6. Bob McNair brings the NFL back to Houston &LR;  _ And bless him
for it, given the $700 million price tag. Go, Bobcats!
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 7. Rice's 10-1 season in 1949  &LR; _ The Owls finished fifth in the
national rankings and whipped North Carolina in the Cotton Bowl.
Soon thereafter, a giant stadium worthy of Jess Neely's deserving
champions rose on the vacant land west of the campus.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 8. The Astros finally make the playoffs &LR;  _ After 18 also-ran
seasons, a pennant of some kind would finally hang from the Dome's
famous rafters.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 9. The Oilers beat the Steelers on  &LR; Monday Night Football _
With the Dome SRO and stuffed with pompoms, Luv Ya Blue was born on
this rowdy December night in 1979. No regular-season victory by any
of our teams felt better than this one did.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 10. The Comets' third WNBA title  &LR; _ First, they had to pay
their final respects to Kim Perrot, the scrappy point guard who had
helped lead them to the two previous championships. That is
overcoming adversity.
</P>
<P>
   Our 10 worst sports moments:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1. Buffalo 41, Houston 38  &LR; _ Hands down, the calamity to end
all calamities, final score-wise. By blowing a 35-3 lead, the
Oilers lost their best chance to go to the Super Bowl and thus
began the inexorable series of events that led Adams to take the
franchise to Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2. The Oilers leave town  &LR; _ It wouldn't have happened if the
aforementioned hadn't happened.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 3. Nolan Ryan signs with the Rangers  &LR; _ The disgust with John
McMullen for letting Ryan go launched a downward spiral in local
baseball interest that almost drove the Astros out of Houston, too.
Nolie's entering the Hall of Fame wearing a Rangers cap was the
final shot to our heart.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 4. North Carolina State upsets UH  &LR; _ Arguably the biggest
shocker in the history of college basketball's championship game.
The vastly superior Cougars choked up, slowed down and started
missing free throws, and with a lucky bucket at the finish, N.C.
State turned the late Jimmy Valvano into a crazy man. The loss
robbed Guy Lewis of his rightful place in the Basketball Hall of
Fame.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 5. Bum Phillips' firing  &LR; _ On New Year's Eve 1980, Adams dumped
the beloved folksy coach who had presided over Luv Ya Blue. In the
end, though, it would be only the second-worst thing he did to the
city.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 6. The Astros' 16-inning loss to the Mets  &LR; _ This most
spectacular of games was the closest the Astros have been to the
World Series. With the almost unhittable Mike Scott, of whom the
Mets stood terrified, set to start Game 7 of the National League
Championship Series, the Astros were a virtual lock to win the NL
pennant.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 7. Kim Perrot's death &LR;  _ Quite simply the most heartbreaking
sports story ever to unfold in our midst.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 8. Don Wilson's death  &LR; _ The no-hit pitcher was at the top of
his game when he died of carbon monoxide poisoning in his garage.
We still don't know why it happened.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 9. James Rodney Richards' stroke  &LR; _ Another superstar pitcher
cut down in his prime, although at least he survived.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 10. Tie: Astros lose to Padres; Oilers lose to Chiefs  &LR; _ With
Randy Johnson and a murderers' row batting order, the '98 Astros
were the best team in franchise history and should have blown away
the eventual NL champions. The '93 Oilers had won a
franchise-record 11 games in a row but, in a mini-repeat of the
Buffalo disaster, let Joe Montana overtake them in the fourth
quarter. The only reason the poor Bills could lose four consecutive
Super Bowls is because the Oilers gave them two free passes. &QL;

PATRIOTS' VINATIERI LEFT WITH COLD FEET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The suspended ceiling above his locker was
askew, one white panel hanging over his head like the sword of
Damocles. It seemed fitting to be dangling there because the roof
had just fallen in on Adam Vinatieri.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' usually reliable kicker had just missed three
field goals in a 3-point loss, one a 33-yard chip shot from
straight on with six seconds left in regulation that he simply
mis-hit and a 44-yarder in overtime that the God of the Winds blew
down to the ground even though it was well-stroked.
</P>
<P>
   The same thing had happened in the first quarter when he hit
another 44-yarder that took off like it intended to fly into the
stands but went down like a duck suddenly hit by buckshot just
before it reached the goal post. They were three kicks that
typified this sad Patriot season. Three kicks that, like the team
itself, didn't quite make it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put me in a dome and I'm 3 for 4 today but we're not in a
dome, we're in Foxborough,'' Vinatieri said sadly after those
misses led to the Patriots' 13-10 loss to the Buffalo Bills Sunday,
their sixth loss in the last seven weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the short one, I didn't hit it at all. It was like I left
the club open. I toed it a little and it went right. I was hoping
it was short enough that it wouldn't matter, but it did.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other two I felt I hit pretty good but Mother Nature beat
me there. Both of them looked good. They felt good. But they fell
short. We knew we had an 8- to 10-yard wind going there. If we'd
been going in the other direction it might have gone 10 yards
farther.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Patriots were going in the wrong direction Sunday, which
is the same direction they've been headed since their return from
the bye week oh so long ago, a week that turned into the bye-bye
week because they haven't been back since.
</P>
<P>
   Not back into the game. Not back into the playoffs. Not back
into anything but a U-Haul in seven more days.
</P>
<P>
   That's where most of them will have their possessions packed by
Sunday, when they end a meaningless season against the Baltimore
Ravens on this same field in a meaningless game between two
meaningless teams. End it without so much as a cameo appearance in
the playoffs for the first time since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   End it, more than likley, not with a bang but a whimper, the
same way things ended Sunday after Vinatieri's foot and the winter
winds conspired to make them losers again.
</P>
<P>
   It was Drew Bledsoe's worst passing day since his rookie year.
It was the offense's worst day this season, which includes more
than a few other awful days. And it was amiable Vinatieri's worst
day in a long time, a day in which wind, weather, and his own foot
conspired against him and his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   But when you are 7-8 and going nowhere, not everyone wants to
hear about the weather. They don't want to hear that the flu kept
Terry Glenn home in bed while others played hurt and they don't
want to hear that the wind was blowing from the southwest at 23
miles per hour, either. What they wanted to hear was what they did
not hear with two seconds left in regulation and Vinatieri stroking
what they believed so fervently would be a victory kick.
</P>
<P>
   They wanted to hear the crowd roar. Instead, all they heard was
the wind roar and then go out of their sails completely.
</P>
<P>
   ``What elements?'' an angry Willie McGinest snapped when asked
if he felt badly for his teammate's fate. ``That's his job. It's
Adam's job to make those field goals. I wished he would have made
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all had to play in the elements. The defense's job is to
stop them. I guess 13 points was too many today. I can only speak
for myself, but everyone is responsible for what they do.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, make the kick. Across the room, Vinatieri didn't
disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``That one at the end of the fourth quarter was probably the
worst kick of my life,'' Vinatieri said of the errant 33-yarder.
``When I hit it, I knew I didn't hit it very well. I felt I crushed
the other two, but we knew about 43, 44 yards was by far the range.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this business you have to have a real short memory but this
is pretty disheartening. When I hit the one in overtime it felt for
sure like I had it but then I saw the ball starting to slow down
and then it just dipped down in front of the goal post and that was
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 33-yarder? You yank it and you know, `Wow, that's all me.'
The other two were more the elements but I don't know if there's an
easy miss. The kick falls short, it doesn't make it any easier
because the wind did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not any easier for Adam Vinatieri. Not any easier for Willie
McGinest. Not any easier for anyone in Foxborough, including the
man who seemed to move a foot closer to his final appearance there
when Vinatieri's kicks came up a foot short.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had two great chances to win the game,'' said beleaguered
coach Pete Carroll. ``Maybe one great chance and one hope with that
last kick. He kicks a great kick we win the game and we go home.
That was the thinking there. You're probably asking what would make
you think he could do that after missing the one before but, hey,
you never know. Adam's done a lot of good things for us, so we
wanted to give him a chance to do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been killing the ball in practice the last few weeks. The
last kick, he pounded that kick, but it just wasn't enough. There
was just too much wind. Unfortunately, it didn't work out.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a lot of things in Foxborough these days.

BIBLE GOT THE BOOK ON BC OFFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
 COLLEGE-BIBLE-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON _ At first, Dana Bible didn't have the slightest idea who
would be called upon to execute the offense he planned to install
at Boston College, let alone what to call it. So, when the Eagles'
new offensive coordinator met with reporters for the first time
during BC's Media Day in August, Bible was peppered with questions
about the scheme he planned to implement.
</P>
<P>
   Would it be run-oriented? Run-and-shoot? Pro-style? Multiple?
Just what, exactly?
</P>
<P>
   Bible smiled politely. He tried to describe it, but stopped in
midsentence and shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't know yet,'' he said. ``We're just going to try
and do the things that best suit the strengths of our personnel.''
</P>
<P>
   What those strengths were, Bible was not prepared to say at the
time. Nor was he prepared to put a name on his offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because it might not have been that,'' he said recently,
laughing at the recollection. ``I was as candid as I could be when
I said that we were going to play to the strengths of our players.
But we needed time to figure out what (they were). Really, there
were still seven or eight guys out there who really hadn't been the
guys. So who knew?''
</P>
<P>
   That much Bible understood when he inherited an offense that
lost eight starters from a 4-7 team, including three players who
went on to the NFL _ center Damien Woody, a first-round pick (No.
17 overall) by the Patriots; All-America running back Mike Cloud, a
second-round pick (No. 54 overall) by the Kansas City Chiefs; and
guard Doug Brzezinski, a third-round pick (No. 64) by the
Philadelphia Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early on, it was a work in progress,'' Bible said. ``We were
just trying to be solid, and as we got our feet under us, we
started to expand. That's the best way to describe it. If you look
at the kids who made up the offense, we weren't young, but we were
green with the upperclassmen because the class before had been very
talented and very productive and (had) very good players.''
</P>
<P>
   Bible put together an offense that was far from a finished work,
much less a masterpiece. He employed some creative brush strokes:
showing a few new wrinkles and virtually no tendencies in the first
three quarters against Miami, installing the option against
option-oriented Syracuse, and rallying from a 14-0 deficit in a
31-29 victory at Notre Dame with some bold moves that took the
fight right out of the Irish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he does an excellent job of game-planning each week,''
said junior quarterback Tim Hasselbeck. ``I don't know of a game
where we have seen a look that he's not prepared us for, by
watching film or in practice. We're never really guessing `What the
heck are they doing?' He does a great job of getting us ready each
week. We always do something different, but at the same time it's
something where we're still using the strengths of people on our
football team or on our offense, and that's a tribute to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, in the opener against Baylor, Bible admitted, ``In all my
career and in all my years of coaching, it was the very least that
I knew what we were going to do going into a season. I always look
for constants _ players or schemes or things that I know we can do,
something to hang your hat on. But I didn't know very much going
into the season.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until the emergence of Hasselbeck as the starting QB,
Cedric Washington as a 1,000-yard rusher, wide receiver Dedrick
DeWalt as the deep threat, and tight end Bryan Arndt as a steely
addition to the passing game that Bible was able to turn to the
pages of his good book and add new plays to the scheme.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we had evidence of what our kids could do, that
would allow us to evolve further or expand a little bit,'' Bible
said.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of his first season at BC, Bible has the Eagles
ranked third among Big East teams in total offense (380.6 yards per
game), first downs (225), and pass efficiency (126.1 rating), and
second in rushing offense 177.5 ypg). He has the offense of BC's
8-3 team preparing for a New Year's Eve showdown against Colorado
in the Insight.com Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   It was a far cry from the end of the spring game when BC coach
Tom O'Brien approached Bible and asked him for an evaluation of the
offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I let him get through the spring and then I asked him, `What
do you think?' and he said, `Well, I hope the freshman class is
good.' That was his initial statement,'' O'Brien said. ``Then he
said, `If they have the ``want to'' and want to work hard, if that
counts for anything, then we're going to be a good football team,
because these kids want to be great football players.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Bible, though, deflected any credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the culmination of a really talented group of players,
offensive coaches, and an outstanding head coach and his input that
makes this thing go,'' said Bible, a 46-year-old native of
Cincinnati who graduated in 1976 from the University of Cincinnati
and worked as a graduate assistant while earning an MBA at his alma
mater. ``I took the spring game as, `Let's try a little bit of
this, and let's try a little bit of that. I mean, in the middle of
the season I was still . . .'' he paused to search for the right
word.
</P>
<P>
   Experimenting?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes!'' he replied. ``It was like, `I didn't know he could do
that.' I had hoped, but you never know. That's the beauty of these
(bowl) practices is that we're still growing.''
</P>
<P>
   While Frank Spaziani benefited from the presence of six
battle-tested seniors to help in his transition from BC's running
backs coach to defensive coordinator, Bible faced a considerably
bigger challenge in integrating three new assistants, a slew of new
starters, and a new scheme into a cohesive offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it's probably easier for Frank, because he had some
lettermen and he had some experienced kids who had played for three
or four years,'' O'Brien said. ``The task he had was changing
defenses from a 3-4 to a 4-3 and then fitting the pieces of the
puzzle together. But he had some experience with some people who
had been in games, whereas Dana had a new quarterback, then he had
six other new starters on offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frank had been in the league, at least looking at it from the
other side of the football,'' O'Brien added, ``so he had some idea
of the personnel and the names and the way people played, but this
league was fresh and new to Dana.''
</P>
<P>
   No relation to the famous University of Texas football coach of
the same name, Bible came to The Heights after spending last season
as offensive coordinator of the Philadelphia Eagles, his second
tour of duty in the National Football League after a stint
(1990-92) as the Cincinnati Bengals' quarterbacks coach. In an odd
twist, Bible left the Eagles to coach the BC Eagles, replacing Jeff
Jagodzinski, who left the college ranks to become an NFL assistant
with the Green Bay Packers.
</P>
<P>
   A former offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach at
Stanford (1995-97), Cincinnati (1994), Miami University (1989), San
Diego State (1986-88), and North Carolina State (1983-85), Bible
found the collegial atmosphere at BC more to his liking, but the
challenges were no less daunting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent my time not focused on that, because as a coach you
have to have tunnel vision on getting the pieces in place and being
single-minded about improving every single day,'' Bible said. ``I
didn't read any more into it than that. I didn't allow myself to
worry about the challenges or allow myself to dream about what
might be. I was very much (focused on) improvement, day-to-day,
that's all.''
</P>
<P>
   Which explained why, at the beginning of the season, finding a
label for BC's new offense was the least of his concerns.

ALLISON SIDELINED FOR TESTS ON WRIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, Mass. _ This season had all the potential to be
Jason Allison's best.
</P>
<P>
   So far, though, on a pain and frustration scale, it ranks right
up there with his worst.
</P>
<P>
   When the Bruins departed on their charter flight to Long Island
Sunday, the 24-year-old Allison remained behind and said he expects
to miss at least the next three games, and perhaps more, because of
his damaged right wrist.
</P>
<P>
   Allison is expected to undergo a test Monday or Tuesday that
should determine how long he will be out, whether he needs surgery,
or whether he can continue playing.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, after practicing with his teammates at the Ristuccia
Center, Allison appeared demoralized. He's tired of not being
healthy, of not being able to take faceoffs consistently, of being
sore and unable to play at full capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Short of a miracle cure, Allison said the best-case scenario
might be for him to put a cast on his wrist, sit out a month
without having surgery, and rest it. He said that if the doctors
told him he'd be 100 percent after that, he'd agree to it. In early
November, Allison was supposed to sit out three weeks. He ended up
sitting out one, missing two games. He said he wouldn't do it that
way this time because he's sick of the roller-coaster ride he's
been on.
</P>
<P>
   He said another scenario might be arthroscopic surgery to clean
up the wrist, sit out a while until it heals, and be able to finish
out most of the season and the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The worst-case scenario is surgery that would sideline him 3-4
months. But, Allison said, if he knew his wrist wasn't going to get
any worse, he'd nurse it through the year, take time off when he
needed it, and then have the major operation in the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   The pain is unbearable at times, Allison said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's starting to scare me,'' he said. ``I want to play, and
that's the way I am, but I've got to be careful and make sure it
doesn't ruin my career. The way it's going now, the day after a
game I can't pick something up off the table . . . because of the
pain. It almost drops me. Two days later, it might feel good again.
Hopefully, that's a good sign and means it's something that just
keeps flaring up. That's why I kept playing, because it does get
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Allison said he just wants a resolution to a problem that first
reared its ugly head last February.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been maybe 10 games this year where I've felt
good,'' he said. ``The rest _ some nights have been better than
others, some nights have been awful. I can't go through that all
year. I said I wouldn't the last time it happened and I can't.
We'll see what they say. Basically, I'm going to let the
specialists make the decision for me rather than arguing with them
to play. If they told me that if I sit out a month then I'd be 100
percent, without it coming back, that would make me happy in a
way.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Christmas break, Allison already has had a few days
off. He said after having the test there was no sense trying to
rush back for the road trip that begins Monday night in Long
Island, continues in New Jersey Wednesday, and wraps up in Ottawa
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had three days off already,'' said Allison. ``It's a good
time right now to rest it. To have the test, it will be five days.
There's no sense in joining the team for two games (in two nights);
it's stupid. I'm going to give it a good week off anyway. After the
test, by Wednesday or Thursday, we should know what the plan is.''
</P>
<P>
   Allison's injury is rare, something you see in tennis but rarely
in other sports. He also said he's being told that it's not one
injury, it's different ones that have produced a domino effect on
his forearm and wrist.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one thing that has bothered me all year: (hearing),
`You have this a little bit, it might be a little bit of this or
that.' I don't want to take a month off and come back and have it
be hurting again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might take a week off and do that. I'd rather have surgery
and be out for three months than be out a month and come back and
rehurt it. Wrists are tricky things. Look what happened last year.
I had tendinitis and it turned into a torn forearm. Then I had torn
cartilage and a fracture from last year that were kind of related,
but they're not. The swelling and tiredness made another thing
happen. The tear healed in my forearm, but is it from that or from
last year? I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Nailing down the exact problem has, indeed, been difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're only going to check the tendon in the wrist and the
forearm,'' he said. ``If they fix the tendon, I'm sure they'll look
at the cartilage. If they tell me that if I take a month off and
it's not going to get better, then I have to make a decision
whether to have (arthroscopic) surgery now or wait until the end of
the year and take a week off here and there, which is what I would
have to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very frustrating for me. I haven't been able to battle
like I want to and take draws and shoot the puck as good as I'd
like. It's the NHL _ it's hard to get by if you're not 100
percent.''

NO EGG ON FACE OF SCRAMBLING FLUTIE 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL McDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Doug Flutie walked onto the Foxboro Stadium
field at 11 Sunday morning, took one look at the flags flapping
loudly at the top of the stands, and thought he could deal with the
big problem of the day.
</P>
<P>
   The wind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will make a difference,'' he said. ``We'll have to be
careful. The thing (to worry about) is not turning it over. Field
position will be important.''
</P>
<P>
   The wind was unusually high for the stadium, gusting at more
than 25 miles per hour at times, creating havoc with passes and
kicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was playing a game in Winnipeg one time,'' said Flutie of
his time in the Canadian Football League, ``and the wind was
gusting up to 70 miles an hour. I went back one time, throwing into
it, I threw the ball as far as I could, and my wide receiver caught
it for an 8-yard gain. Threw it as hard as I could, but it only
went 8 yards.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots were talking about missed opportunities after their
13-10 overtime loss to the Bills. On the Buffalo side, they were
talking about Flutie's finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just got hot after the third period,'' said Bills offensive
coordinator Joe Pendry. ``We struggled on offense the first three
quarters. Doug made some bad reads, threw to the wrong guys. And
some of our other guys around him missed assignments and were
making mental errors.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the fourth period on into the overtime, we just got hot.
Doug made the plays and we moved the ball. The plays were there
earlier, we just killed ourselves with mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Flutie was cooking over the last 28 minutes, 15 in the fourth,
and 13 in OT. He completed 15 of 18 passes after going just 7 for
17 in the first 45 minutes. He converted nine of 17 third-down
situations, after struggling mightily on them early.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to run, to play-action, and stay away from
turnovers,'' said Pendry. ``That was what we told them before the
game. Then we had three fumbles on offense, plus a bunch of drops.
Guys were fighting the ball on account of the wind. They paid too
much attention to it. It became a mental thing. Then, at the end of
the game, everyone just seemed to settle down. Doug made some big
throws, and our guys started to hold onto the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for the turnovers, Buffalo dominated. They led the
Patriots in total offense, 374 yards to 225. They controlled the
ball for 42:32 to 30:40.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, they sacked New England quarterback Drew Bledsoe six
times (not uncommon this year) and held him to 67 net yards
passing. That is the fewest net yards passing by a Patriot QB since
1992 in a game against Cincinnati, when the immortal Jeff Carlson
threw for 60.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wind dictated how we played defense today,'' said Bills
defensive coordinator Ted Cottrell. ``When they were going into the
wind, we ran more eight-man fronts thinking they were going to try
to run more. Then when they had the wind at their backs, we blitzed
them more trying to get after their pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to give their running game some credit. At times they
hit our defense just right. Terry Allen was very effective. After
one series, one of our young linebackers says to me, `Hey that guy
can really run.' I said, `No kidding, he only ran for 1,500 yards a
few years ago.' ''
</P>
<P>
   All of the Bills thought they got jobbed by referee Mike Carey
on a critical play at the start of the fourth quarter when running
back Jonathan Linton, who had a terrible game, fumbled for the
second time. Chad Eaton picked up the ball at the Buffalo 44 and
ran it to the Bills' 14, setting up the Patriots' only touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like Linton fumbled, but the Patriots should have
had the ball right there,'' said Pendry. ``Eaton made contact with
our players when he was on the ground, and the play should have
ended (at the 44).'' The Bills were right. Even after looking at
the replay, Carey got it wrong.
</P>
<P>
   However, Buffalo, after sleepwalking on offense to that point,
met the challenge with the season on the line, and Flutie made all
of the big plays coming down the stretch.

FLUTIE'S AN OLDIE BUT A GOODIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Bruce Smith, another of the old guard and he
of the two sacks of Drew Bledsoe this day, chuckled as he got
dressed and prepared to leave Foxboro Stadium Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The subject of the moment was old favorite Doug Flutie, who led
the Buffalo Bills to a touchdown late in the fourth quarter to tie
the Patriots at 10-10. He then led them to Steve Christie's 23-yard
winning field goal late in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to the party,'' said Smith, Buffalo's defensive end,
with a big smile. ``None of us know what he's going to do. Not even
the offensive linemen. He made some good plays out there today.
It's exciting. It's exciting, but it can be nerve-wracking.''
</P>
<P>
   If it was nerve-wracking from the Buffalo sideline, imagine what
it was like from the Patriot viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Here were the Patriots shutting down Flutie and the Bills and
then taking a 10-3 lead early in the fourth quarter on a Terry
Allen touchdown that followed an odd, video-challenged runback of a
fumble recovery by Chad Eaton.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots held Flutie off again, but then the Bills held,
too, and here he was again.
</P>
<P>
   To this point, Flutie had scrambled for a couple of first downs,
but he had completed only 10 of 23 passes, and the Bills had scored
only a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   He hit Sam Gash for 5 yards and then for another 8. And now
Flutie, wearing gloves more to keep his hands from drying out in
the cold and wind than strictly for the cold, was heating up. He
hit Peerless Price for 24 yards and Eric Moulds for 19 and soon the
Bills had tied it with a 1-yard run.
</P>
<P>
   The Bills then watched while Adam Vinatieri missed a 33-yard
field goal to the right.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots won the OT coin toss and took the ball and started
down the field. Here was Vinatieri lining up again, this time from
44 yards into the wind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no control over that, that's scary,'' Flutie said.
``But I honestly felt there was a good chance of him missing the
kick because of the wind.''
</P>
<P>
   Vinatieri was short on the second one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our defense shut them down enough so they had to try the
44-yarder into the wind,'' said Flutie.
</P>
<P>
   Flutie passed for 11 yards and Thurman Thomas _ remember him,
too? _ ran for 18 yards down the left sideline. But Moulds coughed
the ball up after a 17-yard reception and the Patriots got the ball
back.
</P>
<P>
   The Bills' defense held again and turned the ball over to Flutie
for the last time.
</P>
<P>
   He completed five passes around one Thomas run and then Thomas
ran up the middle for 9 yards and the Bills were in field goal
range.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thurman was amazing,'' said Flutie. ``He finds the smallest of
holes and slices through them. The one he slid through, if he
wasn't protecting the ball so hard, he probably would have
scored.''
</P>
<P>
   Not necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Christie came on and banged through a 23-yarder for the win.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, only a few games back after missing much of the season
with rib and spleen injuries, rushed 15 times for 84 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Flutie, who has been taking some heat in Buffalo for his
performances of late, completed his last 12 passes to tie a Bills
record (Jim Kelly put up the same number against the Patriots in a
1988 game) and finished 22 of 35 for 212 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Flutie, by the way, is 37. Smith is 36 and Thomas 33.
</P>
<P>
   Call it revenge of the old guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of makes up for last year,'' Flutie said. ``In our
minds, a little bit, we thought we had that game locked up last
year and they pulled it out of the hat.''
</P>
<P>
   In that one, Drew Bledsoe, playing with a pin in his finger,
threw a winning touchdown as the game ended.
</P>
<P>
   Not this time.

BILLS CONTROL OWN FATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The Bills took the long way around and had
to stare down a couple of Adam Vinatieri field goals to do it, but
at the end they knocked off the Patriots and remained in control of
their immediate playoff future.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big, important win for us to win 10 games,'' said
coach Wade Phillips, whose team improved to 10-5. ``We don't know
where we are in the playoffs yet because of other games, but it was
a giant step toward that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bills could have sneaked in for sure Sunday night, but
Seattle won, and they could get in Monday night if Miami loses. An
assortment of things can happen next weekend, but if nothing else
the Bills can win and get in.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than anything, in the playoff hunt, this is so
meaningful,'' said quarterback Doug Flutie. ``I mean, if we'd lost
this game, we'd have our backs against the wall and need help next
week and have all that kind of stuff going on. Now, we could
potentially lock up the game this week.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Smith isn't interested in the machinations of the whole
thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning takes care of everything,'' the veteran defensive end
said. ``If we win them all, we'll be in the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   And yes, he wanted to make it clear, the Bills did slip from
their heyday of four straight Super Bowl appearances in the early
'90s. They missed the playoffs in 1994 and 1997. No, he said, with
all due respect, he has no advice to the Patriots on how to deal
with any slipping fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's their problem,'' Smith said. ``We've got enough
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   One of them they can take care of next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We win one more at home and we'll be in (the playoffs) for
sure,'' Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that task is not exactly simple either: The Bills
have the Colts at home Sunday.

BLEDSOE STIL IN THROES OF SLUMP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Sunday's was one of the ugliest games
Patriots quarterback Drew Bledsoe ever has played. He threw for
just 101 yards, completing 10 of 21 passes, with no touchdowns or
interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   His only worse games came in his rookie season, 1993. Against
the Phoenix Cardinals Bledsoe had 85 yards, hitting on 8 of 17
attempts, and against the Bills he had 96 yards, going 8 of 16.
</P>
<P>
   There was an explanation for Sunday's effort, however. Half the
game he was passing against a stiff wind.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe was 7 of 12 for 62 yards in the first half, with two
sacks. In the second half, he was 3 of 9 for 39 yards with four
sacks. The lone Patriots touchdown in the Bills' 13-10 overtime win
was on a 14-yard Terry Allen run up the middle in the fourth
period.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a strong wind, it's never really consistent,''
Bledsoe said. ``You've got a prevailing wind, but then it swirls at
times and so it makes it unpredictable a little bit. So the way
I've always counteracted it is to throw the ball a little harder
and take some air off the ball so it will go through the wind, so
it will end up somewhere it's supposed to be.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not the way it always works, though. For example, Bledsoe
tried to connect with wide receiver Shawn Jefferson up the sideline
on a third-down play, but the pass went out of bounds, instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was playing so the wind would knock the ball back a little
bit, and instead it pushed the ball out of bounds,'' Bledsoe said.
</P>
<P>
   One of Bledsoe's pleasant moments came on a run, in the fourth
quarter. The game was tied at 10, and it was first and 10 from the
Buffalo 42 with 1:19 remaining. Bledsoe saw an opening to the left
and went 25 yards, picking up a first down to the Bills 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initially, everybody was covered, they dropped into a two-deep
zone, and I was looking to check the ball to one of our backs,''
said Bledsoe. ``I saw there was nothing there but green grass, so I
took off. I don't know if I could have scored if I stayed on my
feet or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Bills free safety Kurt Schulz tackled Bledsoe inbounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was somebody that had an angle to knock me out of
bounds, I would have stepped on out, but I thought I'd get as much
as I could,'' Bledsoe said.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots kicker Adam Vinatieri soon attempted a 33-yard field
goal, but the kick was wide right.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have liked to have made another first down in that
situation and we would have liked to have gotten Adam closer,
especially kicking into the wind like he was forced to do, but we
felt like we were in the right situation,'' Bledsoe said. ``We
really didn't want to take a chance at that point, so we ran the
ball and unfortunately we didn't get close enough for him to get it
through.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bledsoe liked the Patriots' effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team, we're not going to quit, we have a lot of heart,''
he said. ``I don't think anybody on this team could have possibly
imagined that this could have happened to us, what has happened,
but by the same token, the guys have a lot of pride and they're
going to play hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said it before, and I will continue to say, through this
whole thing, I don't think there has been a lack of effort. There
has been some poor execution through the stretch, but when you have
some guys we have on this team, they're not going to (quit) on this
team.''

DEFENSE LEFT HOLDING THE BAG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ For so long this season, the New England
defense has had to tote the heaviest of burdens _ its own offense _
yet week after week the defense became stronger as the offense grew
weaker.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday the defense's burden was twice as heavy _ it had to
carry the New Engand offense and its special teams. It was a load
much too heavy to bear.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like we're cursed,'' said linebacker Chris Slade. ``It
seems like everything that could go wrong has gone wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to remember this feeling,'' said defensive lineman
Willie McGinest after the Patriots lost in overtime to Buffalo,
13-10. ``Guys that say this is OK are guys that you've got to get
out of here.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Pete Carroll said he was proud the Patriots showed up to
play, a week after New England played like a high school team and
eliminated itself from the playoffs. ``This meant a lot to me,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But what about the feeling mentioned by McGinest?
</P>
<P>
   It was an emptiness, symbolized by defensive lineman Chad Eaton
flinging his helmet across the turf when Steve Christie's chip shot
field goal went between the uprights with 1:48 left in OT.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defense has been playing well all year,'' said cornerback
Tebucky Jones, who was up to the task in his second start except
for one Doug Flutie pass to Eric Moulds that set up Buffalo's lone
TD. ``And one more game . . . we played well again.''
</P>
<P>
   The offense was its usual impotent self Sunday but the defense
kept Flutie and the Bills in check for virtually all of regulation.
True, Flutie completed 12 straight passes (seven in OT, five at the
end of regulation), tying Jim Kelly's team record, but the Patriot
defense twice came up with plays, one at the end of regulation and
the other in OT, that set up the offense with chances to end the
game early.
</P>
<P>
   And, significantly, the plays were made by two youngsters,
cornerback Kato Serwanga and rookie safety Tony George, who
mysteriously has been kept on the sideline while regular free
safety Chris Carter has done next to nothing all season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a good call on the part of the coaches,'' said
Serwanga, who came in cleanly on a corner blitz on the first play
after the two-minute warning with the Bills facing third and 4 from
their 18-yard line. ``The coaches made a perfect call there and all
I had to do was execute it.''
</P>
<P>
   Serwanga, who also played well filling in at cornerback, dropped
Flutie for a 6-yard loss and the Bills were forced to punt. The
Patriot offense got the ball on the Bills' 42 with 1:19 left,
which, once upon a time, virtually would have guaranteed victory
for New England, its offense and its kicker once so dependable.
</P>
<P>
   But, as defensive lineman Chris Sullivan put it, ``early in the
season we always were so confident we were going to win close
games. But now? You just don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   An easy field goal was missed by New England's Adam Vinatieri,
sending the game into OT. But Vinatieri missed another field goal,
this a more difficult one from 44 yards into a strong wind, and it
seemed the Patriot defense now would both bend and break. Such a
result often follows when a team botches not one, but two, chances
to win.
</P>
<P>
   True enough, Flutie needed only three plays to move from his 34
to the New England 38 and then hit Moulds for a 17-yard gain to the
Patriots' 21, seemingly setting up an easy winning field goal. But
George still had a play to make.
</P>
<P>
   George displayed two instincts on the play, the first by
recognizing what was happening and getting into position to make a
play, and the second when he intentionally went after the ball and
tried to cause a fumble. Such instincts seldom have been seen from
Carter, who was forced out of Sunday's game with a lingering
hamstring pull.
</P>
<P>
   Jones was supposed to be on Moulds ``and I was supposed to push
over to the middle of the field and play the seam,'' explained
George. But the rookie saw immediately that ``Tebucky wasn't able
to get a good jam on Moulds and I saw Moulds run open, and I just
got over to make a play.''
</P>
<P>
   George not only made the tackle on Moulds ``but when I hit, I
always try to put the helmet on the ball because I've been taught
that so much.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' Tedy Bruschi recovered, and after Terry Allen
gained 20 yards on New England's first play, hinting that the
months-long slide by the offense just might be ending, the
Patriots' attack stepped back into the familiar quicksand. Three
more plays and out.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the defense folded under the burden of carrying the
team for 73 minutes. ``I could have been making these plays earlier
in the season,'' George said. But, with this Patriot offense, even
that might have made little difference.

SIGNS POINTING TO CARROLL EXIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ There were two strong signs Sunday that
Patriots coach Pete Carroll believes he is gone.
</P>
<P>
   First, in an unprecedented move, Carroll took his players into
the visiting locker room at Foxborough Stadium Thursday and
addressed them.
</P>
<P>
   Reportedly there were no other coaches or team personnel
allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll reportedly told the players that he had tried to do
everything right, and he wanted them to perform in the last two
games the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Although he never told the players he thought he was going to be
fired, they came away with that feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said as much without saying it right out,'' said someone
who was familiar with what went on in the meeting. ``The players
that were in that meeting felt he was telling them that this was
going to be their last two games (with him), and that he was going
to coach as hard as he could and he wanted them to play with
pride.''
</P>
<P>
   It perhaps was not a coincidence, then, that Carroll said in his
postgame press conference that the players played ``with pride''
and ``played a prideful game.''
</P>
<P>
   The second sign?
</P>
<P>
   Solid ESPN reporter Sal Paolantonio said Carroll had phoned
agent Bob Lamothe in California and asked him to try to get Carroll
another head coaching job in the league. Lamothe is the agent for
Seattle coach Mike Holmgren, and has the reputation of being able
to help coaches get jobs.

<P>
   ARCADIA -- Drawn to Santa Anita by scenic weather, a program of
large fields and the chance to watch Breeders' Cup Classic winner
Cat Thief in action, 44,018 fans got more than expected on opening
day.
</P>
<P>
   They witnessed the last rides of Hall of Famer Gary Stevens, who
abruptly announced his retirement late Sunday afternoon, only 36
years old but unable to stand the pain in an arthritic knee.
</P>
<P>
   They saw a long-shot 8,845th victory by Hall of Famer Laffit
Pincay, who sets a new world record with every winner he rides.
And, along with those chapters in racing history, they saw Leonard
Dunc an saddle the 3-year-old gelding Love That Red to win a
three-horse photo finish over Straight Man and favored Cat Thief in
the $200,000 Malibu Stakes.

   Leonard who? Someday, the fans who made up the largest on-site
crowd in five years for a Santa Anita opener may look back and say
they were there when Dunca n won his first major race. A babyfaced
39-year-old who got his start as a trainer at Los Alamitos, Duncan
hopes to follow noted Los Al alumni D. Wayne Lukas and Bob Baffert
to glory at the major tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be successful, win Breeders' Cup races and make lots of
money? Hec k yeah, I'd like to do that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For one gloriously sunny afternoon, the Long Beach native was
excited just to be in a Grade I winner's circle for the first time
after Love That Red ($10.40) defeated horses trained by Baffert
(Straight Man and sixth-place Prime Timber) and Lukas (Cat Thief)
as well as big-name trainers Richard Mandella (fifth-place Desert
Hero) and Ron McAnally (seventh-place Painter).
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels incredible. It feels unexplainable,'' Duncan gushed.
</P>
<P>
   ``My knees are shaking,'' said his wife, Kathy.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett Gomez -- who rode two winners, as did Corey Nakatani and
Alex S olis -- sent Love That Red inside the hurried pace-setter
Five Star Day to take a short lead in mid-stretch, and held off
Straight Man by a neck with Cat Thief a head farther back.
</P>
<P>
   Cat Thief, shortening up to 7 furlongs in his first start since
winning the 1 1/4-mile Breeders' Cup Classic in November, ran well
despite going wide, and should be set for the 1 1/16-mile San
Fernando Stakes for 4-year-olds on Jan. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan said he'll resist the temptation to try the longer San
Fernando distance with Love That Red, who proved his sprinting
ability by winning the California Cup Sprint and three other short
stakes for breeder-owne r Terry Wells in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's absolutely better around one turn,'' Duncan said. He also
descri bed Love That Red as ``telepathic'' -- the gelding
communicates his mood to the trainer. Last time out, Love That Red
was cranky and finished se cond to Cliquot in the On Trust at
Hollywood Park. ``Today, he was absolutely perfect to saddle,
completely relaxed, and I told Terry in the paddock, `I just
saddled the winner,' '' Duncan said.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan, Wells and Gomez were among a handful of big winners on
Santa An ita's 63rd opening day, its second under owner Frank
Stronach, whose mak eover of the landmark track continued with
Sunday's opening of the 500-chair FrontRunners restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Chalk bettors started well as Fun Meeting You ($6) and Matt
Garcia won the first race in front-running style. McAnally-trained
Sam's ($37.20) snapped a more than year-long losing streak in the
second.
</P>
<P>
   Pincay gave his fans what they wanted in the fourth when a
couple of left-handed cracks of the whip sent Toqueville to a
maiden win that paid $ 59.60. Solis and Mandella teamed up to win
the day's other stakes, the Blue Norther for 2-year-old fillies on
turf, with Minor Details, half an hour after they combined to win
an optional claimer with Lake William.
</P>
<P>
   And David Flores launched defense of his 1998-99 riding title by
winning the nightcap on $48 Nates Colony to leave a single perfect
pick-six ticket worth $217,147.

JOCKEY STEVENS RETIRES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA -- Midway through his mount aboard Desert Hero during
the featured $200,000 Malibu Stakes on opening day of Santa Anita's
winter/spring meeting -- Hall of fame jockey Gary Stevens told
himself, ``it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, a three-time Kentucky Derby champion who missed winning
the Triple Crown aboard Silver Charm by a nose in 1997 -- announced
his sudden retirement, Sunday -- ending a brilliant 20-year career
that began when he was 16.
</P>
<P>
   Arguably the best jockey over the last decade, Stevens said that
degenerative arthritis in his right knee has forced his career to
end prematurely.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month Stevens had arthroscopic surgery to remove
debris in his right knee -- but after returning to racing after a
30-day absence, he admitted he couldn't continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the eighth pole in the Malibu is when I said, `it's
over.''' said Stevens, who was 0-for-4 on the day. ``Before the
race was over with, I was a well-beaten fifth and I was praying for
the finish line to come just so I could stand up.''
</P>
<P>
   After his first mount in the second race aboard Naninja, Stevens
knew it was time to retire. He tried to finish his card -- but he
opted out of his last two mounts after his ride aboard Desert Hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``One hundred yards into the first race I rode, I knew this
would be my last day,'' he said. ``Today I was hoping for a
Christmas miracle. I was hoping to be able to do my job.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it wasn't fun anymore. It was time. There is bone on bone
and it's chipping away. I want to be able to walk later in life.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens leaves with six Triple Crown victories, with his other
two Kentucky Derby winners aboard Winning Colors in 1988 and
Thunder Gulch in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   He also won the 1997 Preakness with Silver Charm and the Belmont
with Thunder Gulch. His last Triple Crown victory aboard Victory
Gallop in 1998 spoiled Real Quiet's bid to become the first Triple
Crown winner since Affirmed in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, who also won seven Breeders' Cup titles, went on to
ride 4,512 winners in his career, earning a total of $187 million
in purses -- but injuries to both knee's over the last 10-years
made riding tough for the Eclipse Award winning jockey.
</P>
<P>
   ``The damage to my knee is irreparable and I was advised by my
doctors that I could carry on as long as I could withstand the
pain,'' said Stevens. ``I was hoping this last surgery would allow
me to be pain free enough to do my job and hopefully ride another
year -- but there was no way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last year and a half I've relied more on my mental savvy
than my physical savvy. But it's come to the point where I can't
rely on my smarts anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I could stick around for another year, but I realize
today that it's not fun to me anymore. It hasn't been fun the last
six months and I thought this clean up surgery would give me a
little more time.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one wants to admit when it's time to quit, but it's time.
It's a lot easier for me to say I'm not the rider that I was then
to hear it from somebody else. I can live with that, but I don't
think I can live with somebody else telling me that I'm not.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Baffert, the trainer that saddled Silver Charm and directed
his best stock in Stevens' direction -- said it's a tough loss for
racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always said he's the best rider I've ever thrown on the
back of one of my horses,'' said Baffert. ``He's one of those
riders that I had so much confidence in. I was never worried about
what kind of ride he would give the horse. I was worried whether I
would have the horse ready to run.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll always be indebted to him because he got me my first Ken &QL;
</P>
<P>
   tucky Derby -- but it's sad because there's nothing like
preparing for a big race and having Gary. Certain riders are fun to
win with and he was one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Jockey Laffit Pincay, who recently broke Bill Shoemaker's
all-time victory mark -- said Stevens was the best over the last 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure going to miss him,'' said Pincay. ``He's a champion.
I've seen him ride for many years and he's had this (knee) problem
for a long time but he never complained about it. He rode on heart
and that's what champions do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a loss because he had many good years ahead of him and he
was a gentleman and professional to be around.''

CLIPPERS HOLD OFF CELTICS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just in time to help you squeeze into that millennium bio-hazard
suit, we're introducing a revolutionary Clipper workout called
``Ty-Mo.''
</P>
<P>
   The battle cry is easy:
</P>
<P>
   Know pain, know gain.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers, who are on a first-name basis with pain, also know
that Tyrone Nesby (22 points, 7 rebounds) and Maurice ``Mo'' Taylor
(26 points, 7 rebounds) enabled them to fatten their record (9-18)
during Sunday's 103-100 victory over the Boston Celtics in front of
12,039 at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``That isn't in my job description ... playin' the five,'' said
Taylor, who was hotter than a $50 Rolex during his 13-point fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five,'' by the way, is hoop code for center.
</P>
<P>
   Right, the 6-foot-8 Taylor was required to pull off that stunt
because regular cast member Michael Olowokandi (sore left knee)
joined a wounded list that has left the Clips about as deep as a
Pauly (cq) Shore flick.
</P>
<P>
   Left-ankle misery has made goners of Derek Anderson and Brian
Skinner, while reinforcement Marty Conlon (illness in the family)
has yet to play. Backup point guard Eric Murdock tweaked his left
ankle two minutes into his second-quarter appearance Sunday and
didn't return.
</P>
<P>
   The grief even reached Coach Chris Ford (lower back spasms), who
missed two heroic wins last week, but returned Sunday to direct his
team to victory over the franchise he coached and played for.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a great win,'' said Ford, whose team led by 13 in
the second quarter, but was outscored, 34-20, in the third. ``The
guys just found ways to make it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Not before negotiating even more twists in the minefield. The
Celtics (11-15) activated their best player, Paul Pierce (24
points) Sunday morning, and received 28 points from trash-talking
marvel Antoine Walker.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers still managed to post their third consecutive
victory - the fifth in seven games - and achieve a ninth win that
required 44 games to accomplish last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're definitely not worrying about what went on last year,''
said flu-damaged rookie Lamar Odom, who produced 15 points, a
game-high 11 rebounds, 3 assists, 5 steals, 3 blocked shots and a
game-high 6 fouls. ``But it is nice to see how we've improved over
last year ... we'll try and build from there.''
</P>
<P>
   It also was sort of pleasant watching Odom steal the ball and
finish the subsequent 2-on-1 dash with a runaway slam at 10:35 of
the fourth quarter. It was a galvanizing maneuver, trimming a
Boston lead that had grown to nine (61-52) down to 76-72.
</P>
<P>
   Odom took Pierce baseline to tie it at 78 with 7:38 remaining,
Taylor drilled an 18-footer for an 80-78 Clipper lead at 7:05, and
Nesby added a 3-pointer to make it 83-78, Clips, with 6:21 before
the final horn.
</P>
<P>
   With six seconds before closing, Boston's Tony Battie stepped to
the line for a pair of free throws and his team down, 101-99. He
made the first, missed the second, Clipper Troy Hudson (15 points,
9 assists) snagged the rebound, was fouled and clinched victory
with two free throws.
</P>
<P>
   Others sources of Clipper joy were provided by backup center
Keith Closs (7 points), backup combo guard Charles Jones (a crucial
3-pointer), guard Eric Piatkowski (15 points, 3 of 6 on 3s) and the
collective savvy to commit only 11 turnovers vs. Boston's pressure
defense.
</P>
<P>
   One of those errors was an incomplete inbound pass from Taylor
that occurred with 22.4 seconds left to play and Boston trailing by
a deuce.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just bugged out on the pass,'' Taylor admitted.
</P>
<P>
   Must be that millennium bug.

KINGS LOSE AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The symptoms of a five-game losing streak were
everywhere Sunday night at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   The winning goal for the Pacific Division-leading Phoenix
Coyotes in a 3-2 overtime victory actually was scored by Kings
center Bryan Smolinski.
</P>
<P>
   Luc Robitaille scored the tying goal midway through the third
period on his only shot of the night. After scoring 10 goals in the
first six games, he has two in the last 2{ months.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings irritated Phoenix's leading scorer, Jeremy Roenick,
into two major fighting penalties early in the game only to see him
credited with the game winner in OT.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're searching for answers right now,'' Smolinski said.
``It's tough, but you have to battle through times like this.
Sometimes games just have weird endings.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the disappointing loss, Sunday's game marked the first
time in more than two weeks the last-place Kings actually recorded
a point.
</P>
<P>
   They had been stuck on 39 longer than Jack Benny, but with the
new overtime rules, they got one for tying Phoenix in regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take it,'' said Kings coach Andy Murray, who watched his
team partially recover from three brutal losses with a respectable
2-1 loss last Wednesday in San Jose. ``All the games will be tough
from now on.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray could only shrug when asked about the winning goal that
started after Jyrki Lumme hit the post on a 15-foot wrist shot. The
puck sailed in the air and Roenick took a whack with what might
have been ruled a high stick. The puck hit Smolinski's stick and
trickled past Kings goaltender Stephane Fiset.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I hadn't touched it, it might have hit off Stephane and
gone in anyway,'' said Smolinski, his team now 0-2-6 in OT.
</P>
<P>
   Even more baffling might have been the recent performance of
Robitaille, who returned Dec. 3 after missing almost a month with a
broken left foot.
</P>
<P>
   When he was named NHL Player of the Week to open the season, he
looked a lot like someone who has more than 500 goals. Lately, he
has just looked lost.
</P>
<P>
   It can be argued that first-line center Jozef Stumpel was
playing just his second game Sunday after missing five weeks with
abdominal surgery. And right winger Ziggy Palffy has not picked up
his game since being sidelined two weeks ago with back spasms.
</P>
<P>
   But Robitaille shares the leadership role with captain Rob
Blake.
</P>
<P>
   After taking a pass from Stumpel behind the Phoenix defense, he
beat goaltender Bob Essensa with a wrist shot over the left
shoulder. Robitaille then skated past the Kings bench and each
player gave him a tap as if to say, `Welcome back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you score it feels great,'' Robitaille said. ``If we
continue to play like this we're going to be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings fell behind on two goals by Travis Green, the former
Mighty Ducks center. Green has 14 goals, one more than his career
high.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes did not take a shot on Fiset for the first nine
minutes of the game. But 15 seconds after the first, Green scored
on the power play.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes were coming off an 8-2 victory in Anaheim on
Wednesday but had dropped five of their past six. They also were
playing without captain Keith Tkachuk, who injured his back in
pre-game warmups.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of capitalizing, the Kings managed only a goal in two
periods, by Ian Laperriere, the third-line center who leads the NHL
in penalty minutes with 115.
</P>
<P>
   Twice the Kings had potential goals reviewed and rejected by
instant replay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are the things that happen when you are going through a
losing streak,'' Robitaille said. ``What can you say, but you got
to keep playing hard and keep moving.''

&HT;     FEDERAL RESERVE'S Y2K COMMAND POST WILL WATCH BANKS AND
MARKETS 
</HEADLINE>
 (REPEATING FOR ALL NEEDING)  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, Dec. 26)   &HT;     (EDS: Filed in the ``w'' and ``f'' categories.)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 &HT;     c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Although the Federal Reserve Board isn't expecting
any widespread Y2K problems, the Fed will operate a special
around-the-clock command post that will monitor banks and financial
markets for computer glitches beginning Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Reserve Board Governors Roger W. Ferguson and Edward W.
Kelley will work over the New Year's weekend, helping 100 staffers
at the command center keep track of each time zone's rollover into
the new year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't expecting major problems,'' said Federal Reserve
spokeswoman Rose Pianalto. The financial markets and the banking
industry _ particularly in the United States and major
industrialized countries_ started addressing the Y2K problem early.
As a result, American bankers predict their computers will work
without a hitch on Jan. 1 and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K computer problem is the result of old programming that
expressed years with two digits, meaning that uncorrected computers
could interpret ``00'' as ``1900'' and crash, or garble data,
potentially disrupting everything from air travel to
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's main focus will be to ensure that the U.S. banking
system survives the transition into the New Year.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed, which regulates about 1,500 U.S. banks, is requiring
the largest of them to do a ``health check'' on Saturday, Jan. 1 _
a day when most banks are traditionally closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will check the lights, the heat and the computers and
report to us,'' Pianalto said. The banks will report to one of the
Fed's 12 regional banks that are also running 24-hour Y2K centers.
The regional Fed banks will report into the Fed's headquarters in
Washington. That information, in turn, will be passed along to the
White House's Y2K command center.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed will also make sure that the nation's money system _ an
electronic network that moves money _ is working. The system helps
keep ATMs running and ensures that payments like paychecks are
correctly transferred from an employer's account to individual
employee accounts at various banks.
</P>
<P>
   Fed officials and bankers were once concerned that people would
withdraw huge sums of money and even close their accounts before
the New Year because of fears that their banks would be paralyzed
by Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
   However, fear of an Y2K-inspired run on the banks was apparently
unfounded. Pianalto said bank customers appear to have taken out
more cash in anticipation of the New Year, but not enough to case
alarm.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, there was $530 billion in circulation, up 14 percent
over last November's figure of $464 billion, according to the Fed.
The amount of cash in circulation in November and December
typically increases by 7 percent annually, partly to accommodate
holiday spending, giving rise to the likelihood that only the other
7 percent hike represents withdrawals by customers concerned about
Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great economy,'' Pianalto said, explaining that part of
the increased cash can be attributed to strong holiday retail
sales. ``But some of it is probably Y2K.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's Y2K post is set up in the Federal Reserve's dining
room on the top floor of its five-story building on Constitution
Avenue and offers spectacular views of the Washington Monument and
the Lincoln and Jefferson Memorials.
</P>
<P>
   But other than the view, the center looks like dozens of other
government Y2K command centers sprinkled throughout the Washington
area. It is outfitted with about 100 computers that sit on small
desks with only enough room for the computer monitor and a phone.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed rented several televisions to follow Y2K news. Rented
clocks are set to local time in Hong Kong, London, Moscow, New York
and San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   New Zealand will be the first major country to enter into the
New Year at 6 a.m. Dec. 31. EST.
</P>
<P>
   The busiest day for the Fed will likely come on Monday, Jan. 3,
when banks and many world markets open for business. All U.S.
markets will be open then, though some markets in Japan and London
will be closed in observance of the New Year's holiday.
</P>
<P>
   During the early morning hours on Monday the Fed will check
markets in Hong Kong, Frankfurt, Germany and Paris to see how they
are doing. During the day on Monday, the 12 regional Fed banks will
call each private bank in their respective regions, again to see if
the lights, heat and computers are working. Banks are also required
to report any unusual behavior such as massive withdrawals of
funds.

&HT;     FEDERAL RESERVE'S Y2K COMMAND POST WILL WATCH BANKS AND
MARKETS 
</HEADLINE>
 (REPEATING FOR ALL NEEDING)  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, Dec. 26)   &HT;     (EDS: Filed in the ``w'' and ``f'' categories.)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 &HT;     c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Although the Federal Reserve Board isn't expecting
any widespread Y2K problems, the Fed will operate a special
around-the-clock command post that will monitor banks and financial
markets for computer glitches beginning Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Reserve Board Governors Roger W. Ferguson and Edward W.
Kelley will work over the New Year's weekend, helping 100 staffers
at the command center keep track of each time zone's rollover into
the new year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't expecting major problems,'' said Federal Reserve
spokeswoman Rose Pianalto. The financial markets and the banking
industry _ particularly in the United States and major
industrialized countries_ started addressing the Y2K problem early.
As a result, American bankers predict their computers will work
without a hitch on Jan. 1 and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K computer problem is the result of old programming that
expressed years with two digits, meaning that uncorrected computers
could interpret ``00'' as ``1900'' and crash, or garble data,
potentially disrupting everything from air travel to
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's main focus will be to ensure that the U.S. banking
system survives the transition into the New Year.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed, which regulates about 1,500 U.S. banks, is requiring
the largest of them to do a ``health check'' on Saturday, Jan. 1 _
a day when most banks are traditionally closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will check the lights, the heat and the computers and
report to us,'' Pianalto said. The banks will report to one of the
Fed's 12 regional banks that are also running 24-hour Y2K centers.
The regional Fed banks will report into the Fed's headquarters in
Washington. That information, in turn, will be passed along to the
White House's Y2K command center.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed will also make sure that the nation's money system _ an
electronic network that moves money _ is working. The system helps
keep ATMs running and ensures that payments like paychecks are
correctly transferred from an employer's account to individual
employee accounts at various banks.
</P>
<P>
   Fed officials and bankers were once concerned that people would
withdraw huge sums of money and even close their accounts before
the New Year because of fears that their banks would be paralyzed
by Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
   However, fear of an Y2K-inspired run on the banks was apparently
unfounded. Pianalto said bank customers appear to have taken out
more cash in anticipation of the New Year, but not enough to case
alarm.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, there was $530 billion in circulation, up 14 percent
over last November's figure of $464 billion, according to the Fed.
The amount of cash in circulation in November and December
typically increases by 7 percent annually, partly to accommodate
holiday spending, giving rise to the likelihood that only the other
7 percent hike represents withdrawals by customers concerned about
Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great economy,'' Pianalto said, explaining that part of
the increased cash can be attributed to strong holiday retail
sales. ``But some of it is probably Y2K.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's Y2K post is set up in the Federal Reserve's dining
room on the top floor of its five-story building on Constitution
Avenue and offers spectacular views of the Washington Monument and
the Lincoln and Jefferson Memorials.
</P>
<P>
   But other than the view, the center looks like dozens of other
government Y2K command centers sprinkled throughout the Washington
area. It is outfitted with about 100 computers that sit on small
desks with only enough room for the computer monitor and a phone.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed rented several televisions to follow Y2K news. Rented
clocks are set to local time in Hong Kong, London, Moscow, New York
and San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   New Zealand will be the first major country to enter into the
New Year at 6 a.m. Dec. 31. EST.
</P>
<P>
   The busiest day for the Fed will likely come on Monday, Jan. 3,
when banks and many world markets open for business. All U.S.
markets will be open then, though some markets in Japan and London
will be closed in observance of the New Year's holiday.
</P>
<P>
   During the early morning hours on Monday the Fed will check
markets in Hong Kong, Frankfurt, Germany and Paris to see how they
are doing. During the day on Monday, the 12 regional Fed banks will
call each private bank in their respective regions, again to see if
the lights, heat and computers are working. Banks are also required
to report any unusual behavior such as massive withdrawals of
funds.

MONTREAL'S ALGERIAN COMMUNITY RESENTS SUSPICION
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ In the shadow of a mosque on Rue Jean Talon, shoppers
in spice-scented Arab markets and sippers of highly sugared coffee
in small cafes were feeling the heat, even as a bitter Arctic wind
whipped through their adopted city Saturday. They complained
nervously of unmarked surveillance vans prowling their streets, of
bomb-sniffing dogs, of arrest warrants, police raids and close
questionings.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the talk was rumor or exaggeration, but there's no
masking the real resentment, outrage and even fear racing through
Montreal's Arab community _ especially among ethnic Algerians _
amid an intense international investigation into a suspected
terrorist plot against the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel singled out, targeted,'' said Abderrahim Alachaher, a
former schoolteacher from Algeria who now owns a grocery store
called Chez Cordoba. ``Once again, it seems all of us must be
thrown together with a few bad men.''
</P>
<P>
   The neighborhood is one of several that are heavily populated by
Algerian nationals in Canada's second-largest city. About 20,000
people from the North African country live in Montreal, and the
vast majority arrived this decade, escaping the civil strife and
economic instability that have gripped their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eight years I've been in Canada, and I've been hard-working
and built a business for my family,'' said Mourad Nasari, owner of
an electrical repair service. ``Now comes trouble. And I am
frightened Canadians are looking at us with different eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``trouble'' he referred to is on the front page of nearly
every newspaper in North America: On the eve of the millennium,
police in the United States and Canada have mounted a massive
investigation into activities of suspected Algerian Islamic
radicals after the arrests of three people with ties to Algeria in
Vermont and Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   The two men and one woman in federal custody are from Montreal
and, according to US prosecutors, have links to Algerian radical
groups. Meanwhile, French counterterrorism experts have
investigated whether Montreal is becoming a major center for
Islamic terrorist groups as a floating international population of
Islamic radicals, some suspected of committing crimes in Europe,
exploits Canada's admittedly loose immigration rules.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian Security Intelligence Service warned last year that
the country has become an important sanctuary for scores of
extremely dangerous organizations and their operatives.
</P>
<P>
   Ward Elcock, director of the intelligence agency, stated in
testimony before the Canadian Senate, ``Terrorist groups are
present here whose origins lie in every significant regional,
ethnic and national conflict there is. The nature of our society
and related policies concerning refugees and immigrants make us
particularly vulnerable to terrorist influence and activities.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, following the arrests of the past two weeks, the attention
of the FBI and Royal Canadian Mounted Police _ together with the
intellegence services of Canada, the United States, France and
other nations _ is focused heavily on Montreal as the point of
connection for suspected plotters.
</P>
<P>
   The first arrest came on Dec. 14, when US Customs officials
apprehended Ahmed Ressam, a 32-year-old Algerian national, as he
arrived in Port Angeles, Washington, aboard a ferry from British
Columbia. In the trunk of his car were nitroglycerine, timing
devices and enough explosive material to flatten a building.
</P>
<P>
   Ressam arrived in Canada in 1994 carrying a false French
passport and soon slipping into Montreal's Algerian underground as
a suspected member of a ring specializing in car break-ins and
computer thefts, authorities allege.
</P>
<P>
   The next arrests came Dec. 19, when Lucia Garofalo, 35, and
Bouabide Chamchi, 20, arrived at a remote border post in Beecher
Falls, Vt. They were taken into federal custody after specially
trained dogs detected trace amounts of explosives in Garofalo's
vehicle. The pair have been charged with fairly minor violations of
immigration law.
</P>
<P>
   Garofalo's Algerian husband was deported from Canada in 1993.
Authorities say she recently crossed the border to New England
accompanied by two Algerian males. Authorities have said they fear
she may have carried bomb-making materials or terrorist operatives
on that early December trip.
</P>
<P>
   Chamchi, also of Montreal, is an Algerian who entered Canada
illegally in 1997 as a shipboard stowaway.
</P>
<P>
   Cross-border investigators led by the FBI are looking hard at
Montreal's Algerian community, especially at those with links to
the Armed Islamic Group, responsible for massacres and atrocities
in rural Algeria as well as violent crimes in France, which ruled
Algeria until 1962. Canadian police and intelligence officials
allege radical Algerians have formed cells in Montreal to raise
money for fundamentalist Islamic causes through theft, extortion
and other crimes.
</P>
<P>
   But many Algerians and other Arabs complain bitterly that they
are being tarred by media and police. ``A whole community is being
stigmatized for the acts of a few,'' said Jerry Khourri, executive
officer of the Canadian Arab Federation.
</P>
<P>
   Until this decade, Montreal's Algerians numbered only a few
hundred, mainly university students. But larger numbers started
pouring into Canada in the 1990s as fighting flared between Islamic
fundamentalists and Algeria's military government.
</P>
<P>
   By and large, according to refugee officials, the newcomers tend
to be well-educated, Western-oriented professionals, skilled
workers afraid of persecution from both sides in their homeland's
struggle. They are attracted by Quebec's French-rooted culture _
not too dissimiliar from the culture of middle-class Algerians _
and Montreal's cosmopolitan ambience.
</P>
<P>
   But police say there are also increasing numbers of Algerian
radicals entering the country to join the loosely organized ranks
of Islamic extremists financing their activities through crime.
They like Canada because the country has welcomed Third World
nationals who claim to be fleeing persecution _ almost all are
granted at least temporary residency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Algerians chose Canada because of its commitment to
democracy and human rights. We live in harmony beside all kinds of
people, and we work very hard to get ahead,'' said Alachaher, the
grocery store owner. ``So to be depicted as dangerous or criminal _
this hurts us, this frightens us.''

A CONSCIENCE OF SOUL MUSIC DEAD AT 57 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Curtis Mayfield, a ghetto-born poet who became soul music's
social conscience and stayed a spiritual force even after he was
paralyzed in a stage accident in 1990, died Sunday in an Atlanta
hospital. He was 57.
</P>
<P>
   No reason was given for his death. He had been weak for months
and was unable to attend his induction into the Rock and Roll Hall
of Fame in New York in March. Rapper Puff Daddy inducted him at
that event, praising his ``sense of the holy and the sting of the
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Mayfield, a mainstay of the Chicago vocal group the
Impressions before turning solo, wrote some of R &AMP; B's most famous
songs. Among them are ``People Get Ready'' (which also became the
``Amazing Grace'' of the pop world, sung by everyone from Rod
Stewart to Bob Marley), ``Gypsy Woman,'' and his '70s soundtrack
hits, ``Superfly'' and ``Freddie's Dead,'' which have been sampled
by countless hip-hop artists from Puff Daddy to Ice-T. Mr. Mayfield
also wrote ``Pusherman'' (about the dead-end world of drug
hustling), an FM radio hit for the band Steppenwolf.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Mayfield was a prime musical voice of the civil rights
movement, starting with 1964's ``Keep On Pushing,'' a Top Ten hit
on both R &AMP; B and pop radio stations. His other socially conscious
songs during that era included ``We're a Winner,'' ``This is My
Country,'' and ``Choice of Colors.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Mayfield was a silky-smooth singer whose falsetto was
immediately identifiable on the radio for many years. He reached
his commercial peak in 1972 with the ``Superfly'' soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1942, Mr. Mayfield grew up in Chicago's infamous
Cabrini-Green projects, where he shared one room with his mother
and five siblings. One younger brother was retarded and Mr.
Mayfield took special care of him until the boy died of an enlarged
heart at age 18.
</P>
<P>
   Trained in church singing, Mr. Mayfield took that gospel-infused
sound into the Impressions, where he shared vocal duties with Jerry
Butler. The Impressions had a falling-out which prompted Mr.
Mayfield to turn solo, but they reunited for a memorable 1983 tour
that came to the Berklee Performance Center. The show started an
hour late because Mr. Mayfield had a bad cold and lay sick in his
hotel, but he rallied and gave a mesmerizing performance.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Mayfield was also a poet of the heart, writing such tenderly
beautiful love songs as ``Woman's Got Soul'' and ``I'm So Proud.''
Everything he did showed consummate style and a poet's touch.
</P>
<P>
   The positive thinking that lay at his core was never more
evident than after the freak accident that left him paralyzed in
1990 _ when a lighting truss fell on him during a thunderstorm at a
free Brooklyn concert. He never indulged in self-pity _ and he even
made another album in 1996, ``New World Order,'' recorded while
lying on his back.
</P>
<P>
   The album featured the songs ``Back to Living Again'' and ``Oh
So Beautiful,'' with the verse, ``Never forget the life we live is
oh so beautiful.'' Nominated for two Grammys, it didn't win, but
Eric Clapton, who won three Grammys that year, interrupted his
acceptance speech to say that Mr. Mayfield's album was his personal
favorite of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all human beings, so we can get angry or bitter or mad,
but for me it doesn't last too long,'' Mr. Mayfield told the Globe
when the album came out. ``I'd rather be humble and cry tears of
joy than to take on the stress and burdens of being dogged out and
negative.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Mayfield leaves his wife, Altheida, along with ten children,
two sisters, a brother, and seven grandchildren. Funeral
arrangements have not been announced.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: In defense of gay marriage
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   My wife and I have been married 25 years. We have three kids,
six grandchildren. And for the life of me I don't see how my
marriage, or the marriages of our kids, would be demeaned or
diminished, much less invalidated, if gays and lesbians are
permitted to marry.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in a reaction typical of the religious right, Jay Sekulow,
of the conservative American Center for Law and Justice, denounced
a recent ruling by the Vermont Supreme Court as ``a slap in the
face for marriage between a man and a woman.''
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled that, under Vermont's constitution, the state
must give homosexual couples the same protections and benefits it
gives heterosexual couples. Somehow, I don't feel slapped.
</P>
<P>
   The early guessing is that the Vermont legislature will choose
to establish legal domestic partnerships for gay and lesbian
couples rather than sanctioning marriage outright. Either way, the
ruling can have only informal impact outside Vermont, at least in
the near term.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the state constitution, the decision can't be appealed
to federal courts, so no national precedent will result from it.
Still, it likely will encourage similar challenges under other
state constitutions, and it further energizes the argument, and
dramatizes the split, over the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Public policy is simultaneously being pulled in opposite
directions.
</P>
<P>
   Congress, egged on by the regrettable Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga.,
passed the gratuitously titled Defense of Marriage Act in 1996, and
President Clinton regrettably signed it. It permits states to
refuse, if they wish, to recognize same-sex unions performed in
other states. Some 30 states have barred same-sex marriage by
statute.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, major companies in increasing numbers
are extending the same benefits to domestic partnerships that they
provide to married couples. Some 3,000 employers offer
domestic-partner insurance coverage. A number of cities have
recognized domestic-partnership rights, too.
</P>
<P>
   The case for such recognition is compelling.
</P>
<P>
   The three couples that filed the Vermont lawsuit identified more
than 300 state, and 1,000 federal, benefits earmarked for married
couples _ inheritance rights, access to insurance, hospital
visitation and tax considerations among them.
</P>
<P>
   Forget legal arguments and constitutional niceties. We cannot
fairly reserve exclusively for heterosexual couples an array of
benefits and privileges from which others are excluded by their
very nature. The inequity is both harmful and offensive.
</P>
<P>
   If the political system is unready for gay and lesbian marriage,
then lawful same-sex partnerships, with all marriage-like
privileges, would provide a reasonable stopgap until folks become
familiar and comfortable enough with the prospect to make that last
step politically possible.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show Americans split over gay marriage but overwhelmingly
opposed to acts of discrimination against homosexuals. The Vermont
ruling points a way to end some of the most embedded of those
discriminations.

 By MICHAEL WINERIP   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Treating mental illness is not one of society's big priorities,
and public policy in the field often gets made in strange,
circuitous ways. Last June the president held the first White House
conference on mental illness; this month, Dr. David Satcher
released the first surgeon general's report on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the states that are responsible for funding and
treatment. And in New York, which has the nation's largest mental
health budget, recent policy changes come courtesy not of the
president or the surgeon general, but thanks to one violent
schizophrenic man, Andrew Goldstein.
</P>
<P>
   When the president and surgeon general discuss mental health
policy, they sound cautious. They are not looking to commit new
federal money to a problem that has been the states' burden for 150
years. The surgeon general's key conclusions _ that one in five
Americans suffer some mental illness and that stigma is a main
obstacle to seeking care _ have been common knowledge for years.
</P>
<P>
   But when Goldstein pushed Kendra Webdale to her death on the
subway tracks last January, it set loose fear and outrage among the
public and forced state politicians to take action.
</P>
<P>
   Public policy ginned up in the heat of battle is often a mixed
blessing. Something gets done, though it may not have anything to
do with the crisis at hand. In the Goldstein case, some changes _
$215 million budgeted for more supervised housing, more case
managers and more beds for long-term state hospital care _ fit the
facts of the case. Other changes, like the passage of tougher
legislation to force resistant mentally ill people to comply with
treatment, may or may not be a good ideas, but had little to do
with Goldstein.
</P>
<P>
   From the early news accounts of the killing it appeared that
Goldstein had repeatedly been offered mental health services, but
had refused treatment and medication. So the solution to preventing
future Andrew Goldsteins seemed to be an aggressive new commitment
law _ ``Kendra's Law'' _ and both the Republican governor and
Democratic attorney general quickly drafted legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Then an article in The New York Times in May examining
Goldstein's psychiatric record revealed a whole new set of facts.
Goldstein had frequently and voluntarily sought long-term and
short-term hospitalization, as well as supervised housing programs,
but was repeatedly rejected because there were no vacancies in a
system short of beds, programs and money.
</P>
<P>
   Whether tougher commitment laws even make a difference in
getting dangerous people off the streets is a hard public policy
question that has divided experts for years. In a mental health
system with scarce resources, to make room for an Andrew Goldstein,
do you wind up pushing out into the street someone else who is
equally troubled? In 1995, in an effort to assess whether New York
needed to change its laws, the state financed a three-year pilot
program at Bellevue Hospital with tougher commitment rules aimed at
the resistant mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   The results of that study, completed a month before the killing
of Ms. Webdale, were inconclusive. Recently released documents make
it clear that the same Bellevue pilot program had two chances to
get Goldstein off the streets but let him go. By sheer coincidence,
he had visited the emergency room at Bellevue twice during the
pilot program. And even though this was the period when he was
regularly attacking strangers _ 13 in two years _ the psychiatrists
did not enroll him in the program. Each time, after a few days at
Bellevue, he was released to live on his own, unsupervised. A
tougher commitment standard had made no difference for the real
Andrew Goldstein.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the facts did not matter. Certain personal tragedies
so unnerve the public _ the death of a Megan Kanka in New Jersey,
the shootings at Columbine High School in Colorado _ that it
becomes almost impossible for politicians not to act, and in a
legislative instant new laws get made to register sex offenders, to
expand gun control, to commit more mental patients. On Aug. 27,
Gov. George Pataki signed Kendra's Law.
</P>
<P>
   That was just the beginning. By last summer the newly disclosed
facts of the Goldstein case justified what mental health advocates
had been arguing for years: a lack of state spending was crippling
the system. To cut costs, the state had set quotas for reducing the
patient population at every public hospital in New York, making it
extremely difficult to get long-term care. Goldstein was a perfect
example.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, after assaulting three staff members at a mental health
crisis program, he was hospitalized for eight months at Creedmoor
state hospital in Queens. But when he attacked 13 people in 1997
and 1998, his psychiatrists could not get him into a state hospital
for long-term care. Instead, he was admitted to short-term
hospitals, and usually discharged within three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The low point came in June 1998 _ six months before he killed
Ms. Webdale. Goldstein was admitted to Brookdale, a short-term
hospital, after he struck a woman on a subway car. On his third day
at Brookdale, he attacked four hospital workers. Two weeks later he
struck a nurse's assistant. The Brookdale psychiatrists applied to
have Goldstein transferred for long-term care at Creedmoor. But the
hospital put him on a waiting list, a common stalling tactic used
at the time. Within days he was back on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   During the fall, Goldstein's trial kept public interest high and
encouraged the news media to seek changes in state policy. In a
rarity, The Times, The Daily News and The Post agreed in editorials
on the need to put a moratorium on the reduction of state hospital
beds, to finance more community housing programs and to support
Kendra's law. And Pataki listened.
</P>
<P>
   For a while the shark attack effect prevailed: if a mentally ill
person committed a violent act it was perceived as part of a
pattern _ another Goldstein _ and received prime news coverage.
</P>
<P>
   But there are dangers when journalists instantly try to cast
news events in a public policy context. Last month, for example,
New Yorkers were riveted by accounts of the search for a mentally
ill homeless man who attacked a woman with a brick in midtown
Manhattan. It seemed like another tragic failure of the mental
health system _ another Goldstein! _ until the police arrested a
career crook with a drug habit who was neither homeless nor
mentally ill.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Treating mental illness is not one of society's big priorities,
and public policy in the field often gets made in strange,
circuitous ways. Last June the president held the first White House
conference on mental illness; this month, Dr. David Satcher
released the first surgeon general's report on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the states that are responsible for funding and
treatment. And in New York, which has the nation's largest mental
health budget, recent policy changes come courtesy not of the
president or the surgeon general, but thanks to one violent
schizophrenic man, Andrew Goldstein.
</P>
<P>
   When the president and surgeon general discuss mental health
policy, they sound cautious. They are not looking to commit new
federal money to a problem that has been the states' burden for 150
years. The surgeon general's key conclusions _ that one in five
Americans suffer some mental illness and that stigma is a main
obstacle to seeking care _ have been common knowledge for years.
</P>
<P>
   But when Goldstein pushed Kendra Webdale to her death on the
subway tracks last January, it set loose fear and outrage among the
public and forced state politicians to take action.
</P>
<P>
   Public policy ginned up in the heat of battle is often a mixed
blessing. Something gets done, though it may not have anything to
do with the crisis at hand. In the Goldstein case, some changes _
$215 million budgeted for more supervised housing, more case
managers and more beds for long-term state hospital care _ fit the
facts of the case. Other changes, like the passage of tougher
legislation to force resistant mentally ill people to comply with
treatment, may or may not be a good ideas, but had little to do
with Goldstein.
</P>
<P>
   From the early news accounts of the killing it appeared that
Goldstein had repeatedly been offered mental health services, but
had refused treatment and medication. So the solution to preventing
future Andrew Goldsteins seemed to be an aggressive new commitment
law _ ``Kendra's Law'' _ and both the Republican governor and
Democratic attorney general quickly drafted legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Then an article in The New York Times in May examining
Goldstein's psychiatric record revealed a whole new set of facts.
Goldstein had frequently and voluntarily sought long-term and
short-term hospitalization, as well as supervised housing programs,
but was repeatedly rejected because there were no vacancies in a
system short of beds, programs and money.
</P>
<P>
   Whether tougher commitment laws even make a difference in
getting dangerous people off the streets is a hard public policy
question that has divided experts for years. In a mental health
system with scarce resources, to make room for an Andrew Goldstein,
do you wind up pushing out into the street someone else who is
equally troubled? In 1995, in an effort to assess whether New York
needed to change its laws, the state financed a three-year pilot
program at Bellevue Hospital with tougher commitment rules aimed at
the resistant mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   The results of that study, completed a month before the killing

DEFINING MARRIAGE, AN ISSUE REIGNITED
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   With the Vermont Supreme Court's bombshell ruling last week
stopping just short of legalizing gay marriage, it might be said
that the ``courtroom period'' of the national movement for same-sex
marriage has all but ended for now. With no major marriage cases
left pending in other states, the battle, all agree, shifts to
legislatures and the court of public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   But in its wake, some legal experts say, the ruling leaves
fodder for a long-running debate: How effective are courts at
bringing about social change?
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Koppelman, assistant professor at the Northwestern
University School of Law, who has argued that a ban on gay marriage
amounts to sex discrimination, noted that a colleague cites gay
marriage as an example of how courts cannot counter public opinion:
In both Hawaii and Alaska, he says, judicial moves toward
permitting gay marriage were blocked by popular initiatives in
which nearly two-thirds voted to protect traditional definitions of
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   But in contrast, he says, he believes the Vermont ruling shows
how litigation can help bring about social change. The court
``understood both its power to reshape culture and its political
limitations,'' he says. ``It did no more than nudge the
Legislature.''
</P>
<P>
   Vermont's court told the Legislature that it must either
legalize gay marriage or fully equalize the benefits gay and
heterosexual couples receive. And it retained jurisdiction over the
case to ensure that its order was carried out.
</P>
<P>
   A model often used by gay rights advocates like Evan Wolfson,
head of the national Freedom to Marry Coalition, is the ban on
interracial marriage in the 1960s, which was abolished by judges
even while public opinion polls showed most people still
disapproved of interracial unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always have to remember it was the courts that ended race
discrimination in civil marriage, not the people and not the
legislatures first,'' Wolfson said. ``But having said that, I
believe that the polls show, and the growing support shows, that
fair-minded people in this country, the persuadable middle, are
ready to support equality and inclusion for lesbians and gay men if
the legislatures will show some leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of gay marriage disagree that the public is so ready,
and some brand the Vermont decision ``judicial tyranny.'' But they
emphasize that even in such a ``tyrannical'' mode, the courts are
held back by the weight of public opinion and cannot push it too
hard even if they want to.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Sekulow, chief counsel of the conservative American Center
for Law and Justice, pointed out that Vermont's finding that gay
couples were discriminated against could reasonably have led the
justices to rule that gay couples should simply be granted marriage
licenses. But the justices did not, though one dissenting justice
said they should have. Sekulow said, ``You ask yourself, `Gee, why
didn't they issue the marriage license? What stopped them from
taking that step?' They react as if they have a sword of Damocles
over their heads and they don't want to go there.''
</P>
<P>
   That reluctance, he said, stemmed from the awareness that
Vermonters were not ready for gay marriage _ and, according to
public opinion polls, most particularly do not believe that the
decision about gay marriage should be made by the courts rather
than the people or the lawmakers. The ruling, he said, was a
``dodge-the-bullet opinion.'' The Vermont Legislature will convene
next month, and is expected to invite testimony on how to equalize
benefits for homosexual and heterosexual couples.
</P>
<P>
   Those who want to follow the debate over gay marriage should
also keep an eye on Hawaii, where, gay rights advocates say, the
issue of gay partnership is alive despite the state Supreme Court's
recent ruling that the same-sex marriage question was moot because
voters had passed an initiative that favored limiting marriage to
man-woman unions.
</P>
<P>
   Hawaii's lawmakers, Wolfson said, will reconvene next month
still facing a court finding similar to Vermont's: homosexual
couples are discriminated against. Its lawmakers thus face a
decision about finding a remedy similar to the one their colleagues
in Vermont must make _ without the option of marriage. The third
place to watch is California, where a major fight over a ballot
initiative is brewing.
</P>
<P>
   The language on the state's Proposition 22, which will be voted
on in March, is quite simple: ``Only marriage between a man and a
woman is valid or recognized in California.''
</P>
<P>
   But gay rights advocates see the initiative as a threat that
goes far beyond marriage, threatening gains in areas like domestic
partner benefits and adoption. Kate Kendell, executive director of
the National Center for Lesbian Rights, said that in contrast to
the progress seen in Vermont, Proposition 22 ``would be the
beginning of rolling back the very basic elementary protections our
families here have been able to achieve in the last two decades.''
</P>
<P>
   Other states may turn into lesser battlegrounds as well,
although no other major marriage lawsuits are pending. Laws against
gay marriage have been passed in 27 states, along with initiatives
in two more. But groups opposed to gay marriage are calling for a
push to get statutes against gay marriage passed in the 20 or so
remaining legislatures in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   One of those groups, the Family Research Council, is also
``urging people to resist sex-partner subsidies at every level,''
said spokesman Robert Knight, referring to domestic partnership
benefits. The council will also be pushing corporations to drop
domestic partner benefits, he said, and lobbying the public against
them as well.

 COUNTING THE YEARS TO MAKE SENSE OUT OF LIFE  (The Week in Review) 
(jw) 
 By EVA HOFFMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For all the hype, the panic and the prophecies, the occasion is
real. This New Year's Eve feels different, no matter how arbitrary
the date announcing the new millennium may be. The big round number
about to invade our diaries and our lives has an undeniable
symbolic force.
</P>
<P>
   Is this mere superstition, the kind that stops us from walking
under ladders? Perhaps not entirely, for while our systems for
measuring time may be arbitrary, they are also necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Living in seemingly infinite time and space, we humans are
mortal and finite, and we cannot get along without borders and
markers to make the world graspable to our minds.
</P>
<P>
   Sigmund Freud famously opined that ``There is no time in the
unconscious,'' but as soon as we gain consciousness, we begin to
sense and search for shapes and patterns in the continuum of time.
Some of these are determined, or at least strongly influenced by,
the nature of our nature. We experience divisions of time through
the progression of the sun, the alternation of night and day, the
rhythm of our heartbeats, the limits of human life. Richard Fortey,
a paleontologist at the Natural History Museum in London and the
author of ``Life: A Natural History of the First Four Billion
Years,'' believes that an experiential sense of time is encoded
into living creatures. Small mice, whose life spans are very short,
for example, probably ``perceive time in accelerated way,'' Fortey
said.
</P>
<P>
   The human ``appreciation of time,'' he notes, ``is still
governed by the old three-score and ten'' biblical life span and
that frame ``enables us to relate to time on a certain scale.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the tempo of human activity may be to some extent
determined by our bodies (although, as Fortey observes, some
hyperactive humans nowadays seem to live ``on mice-time''), our
conceptions of time are highly elastic, ranging from the light
speed of intuition to the poet's intimation of eternity. In our own
century, our awareness of time has undergone extreme contractions
and enormous expansions, as instruments for measuring time have
become ever more precise, and as our knowledge of the earth's
history continues to be extended. Fortey, who has called himself
``a historian of the last 200 million years,'' nevertheless admits
that the eons of geological and evolutionary time remain difficult
to comprehend even for him, and that he finds the names of
geological periods _ Cambrian, Ordovician, and so on _ helpful in
giving concreteness to the numbers he works with. To this, we might
add our increasing consciousness of the subatomic world and the
universe itself, with their units of time so unfathomably
infinitesimal and incomprehensibly immense as to bring the
imagination to a standstill.
</P>
<P>
   All the more reason, perhaps, why we need not only to measure
time but, in the words of Randall Styers, assistant professor of
philosophy of religion at the Union Theological Seminary, ``to
invest it with meaning.'' Styers notes that the function of the
liturgical calendar, of which the Christian calendar is just one
instance, is ``to give shape to the passing of time'' by endowing
certain days or phases of the year with special significance. The
importance of ritual dates such as Christmas or Easter, in Styers'
view, is not so much to commemorate real events _ the actual date
of Christ's birth, for example, is a matter of considerable dispute
_ as to ``reflect important moments for the community and take the
community through its story, its own self-definition.''
</P>
<P>
   The calendar, in any culture and tradition, delineates the
contours of seasonal and shared time. Art, and especially music, is
a more individual means of molding time and giving a kind of shape
and meaning to our thoughts and emotions. For Steve Reich, a
composer and an observant Jew, religious and musical understandings
of time are salient, and to some extent interconnected. For him,
the liturgical form of the week, particularly the culminating point
of the Sabbath, provides a spiritually refreshing counterpoint to
the hurly-burly of contemporary secular time. And, even without
overt religious content, the temporal form of music, he says, is
``what saves me and other composers from mental breakdown.'' The
underlying beat of any piece of music functions as ``an abstract
grid without which you would be sliding around in nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   What about the year 2000, then, what kind of a marker and
milestone is it? It suggests a measure and a meaning; and on both
these scores, it belongs to the scale of time, which for us is the
central one _ the scale of human history. It's true that the date
derives from what was originally the Christian calendar, which was
not established until the sixth century A.D. But the Common Era
calendar, as it has come to be known, was officially adopted by the
United Nations, and therefore has become, in effect, the global
standard. Within this context, 2000 no longer refers to the
cyclical, ritual time of a particular faith, but to the more linear
chronology of historical time.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it is historians themselves, accustomed as they are
to the capriciousness of dating, who are often most resistant to

extended to 1914; while our own 20th has sometimes been shrunk to
``the short century,'' lasting from the outbreak of World War I in
1914 to the fall of the Soviet Union in 1989.

 COUNTING THE YEARS TO MAKE SENSE OUT OF LIFE  (The Week in Review) 
(jw) 
 By EVA HOFFMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For all the hype, the panic and the prophecies, the occasion is
real. This New Year's Eve feels different, no matter how arbitrary
the date announcing the new millennium may be. The big round number
about to invade our diaries and our lives has an undeniable
symbolic force.
</P>
<P>
   Is this mere superstition, the kind that stops us from walking
under ladders? Perhaps not entirely, for while our systems for
measuring time may be arbitrary, they are also necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Living in seemingly infinite time and space, we humans are
mortal and finite, and we cannot get along without borders and
markers to make the world graspable to our minds.
</P>
<P>
   Sigmund Freud famously opined that ``There is no time in the
unconscious,'' but as soon as we gain consciousness, we begin to
sense and search for shapes and patterns in the continuum of time.
Some of these are determined, or at least strongly influenced by,
the nature of our nature. We experience divisions of time through
the progression of the sun, the alternation of night and day, the
rhythm of our heartbeats, the limits of human life. Richard Fortey,
a paleontologist at the Natural History Museum in London and the
author of ``Life: A Natural History of the First Four Billion
Years,'' believes that an experiential sense of time is encoded
into living creatures. Small mice, whose life spans are very short,
for example, probably ``perceive time in accelerated way,'' Fortey
said.
</P>
<P>
   The human ``appreciation of time,'' he notes, ``is still
governed by the old three-score and ten'' biblical life span and
that frame ``enables us to relate to time on a certain scale.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the tempo of human activity may be to some extent
determined by our bodies (although, as Fortey observes, some
hyperactive humans nowadays seem to live ``on mice-time''), our
conceptions of time are highly elastic, ranging from the light
speed of intuition to the poet's intimation of eternity. In our own
century, our awareness of time has undergone extreme contractions
and enormous expansions, as instruments for measuring time have
become ever more precise, and as our knowledge of the earth's
history continues to be extended. Fortey, who has called himself
``a historian of the last 200 million years,'' nevertheless admits
that the eons of geological and evolutionary time remain difficult
to comprehend even for him, and that he finds the names of
geological periods _ Cambrian, Ordovician, and so on _ helpful in
giving concreteness to the numbers he works with. To this, we might
add our increasing consciousness of the subatomic world and the
universe itself, with their units of time so unfathomably
infinitesimal and incomprehensibly immense as to bring the
imagination to a standstill.
</P>
<P>
   All the more reason, perhaps, why we need not only to measure
time but, in the words of Randall Styers, assistant professor of
philosophy of religion at the Union Theological Seminary, ``to
invest it with meaning.'' Styers notes that the function of the
liturgical calendar, of which the Christian calendar is just one
instance, is ``to give shape to the passing of time'' by endowing
certain days or phases of the year with special significance. The
importance of ritual dates such as Christmas or Easter, in Styers'
view, is not so much to commemorate real events _ the actual date
of Christ's birth, for example, is a matter of considerable dispute
_ as to ``reflect important moments for the community and take the
community through its story, its own self-definition.''
</P>
<P>
   The calendar, in any culture and tradition, delineates the
contours of seasonal and shared time. Art, and especially music, is
a more individual means of molding time and giving a kind of shape
and meaning to our thoughts and emotions. For Steve Reich, a
composer and an observant Jew, religious and musical understandings
of time are salient, and to some extent interconnected. For him,
the liturgical form of the week, particularly the culminating point
of the Sabbath, provides a spiritually refreshing counterpoint to
the hurly-burly of contemporary secular time. And, even without
overt religious content, the temporal form of music, he says, is
``what saves me and other composers from mental breakdown.'' The
underlying beat of any piece of music functions as ``an abstract
grid without which you would be sliding around in nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   What about the year 2000, then, what kind of a marker and
milestone is it? It suggests a measure and a meaning; and on both
these scores, it belongs to the scale of time, which for us is the
central one _ the scale of human history. It's true that the date
derives from what was originally the Christian calendar, which was
not established until the sixth century A.D. But the Common Era
calendar, as it has come to be known, was officially adopted by the
United Nations, and therefore has become, in effect, the global
standard. Within this context, 2000 no longer refers to the
cyclical, ritual time of a particular faith, but to the more linear
chronology of historical time.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it is historians themselves, accustomed as they are
to the capriciousness of dating, who are often most resistant to
the fascination of round numbers. Norman Davies, the author of
``Europe'' and ``The Isles,'' notes that ``professional historians
now rarely pay attention'' to the commonplace divisions in their
structuring of the past. For example, the 19th century has been
called by some historians ``the long century,'' and has had its run
extended to 1914; while our own 20th has sometimes been shrunk to
``the short century,'' lasting from the outbreak of World War I in
1914 to the fall of the Soviet Union in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Historians, then, cannot quite do away with epochs or eras, even
if theirs are modifications of the popular versions. But it's the
ringing punctuations of decades, centuries and millennia that
resonate in the world. They help us locate and orient ourselves in
the ever lengthening progress of human history.
</P>
<P>
   A millennium, especially, is a span of time to encourage wonder
and contemplation of the centuries it contains. Without such

 &HT;    TRACKING THE ARRIVAL OF THE NEW MILLENNIUM: A GUIDE FOR Y2K
WATCHERS
 &HT;    Advance for release Thursday, Dec. 30
 &HT;    EDS: ``Today'' in the lede refers to Thursday.
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rest your eyeballs today. Tomorrow, you may be
wearing them out in front of the television.
</P>
<P>
   New Year's Eve typically is a quiet news day, with reporters
doing little but reviewing the year's events and updating party
stories. But this Dec. 31 could prove to be extremely news-filled
because of threats posed worldwide by computer software flaws and
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   For those who don't want to miss any important stories, set the
alarm clock for 6 a.m. EST Friday. That's when New Zealand will
become the first major nation to face the so-called Y2K bug, a
software flaw that could cause computers to misunderstand the new
date and malfunction. If hidden Y2K bugs are going to trigger
serious problems, such as power grid failures and
telecommunications breakdowns, Aucklanders will be among the first
to know it.
</P>
<P>
   As the Earth continues its 24-hour rotation, the threats will
pass from one time zone to the next. For Americans in the U.S.
Eastern time zone, the most dramatic three-hour portion of the day
may begin in the late afternoon when 2000 rolls from Moscow,
through the Middle East and over to Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Midnight arrives in Moscow at 4 p.m. EST. Computer experts fear
Y2K flaws will cause failures in many of Russia's vital services,
such as power generation, telecommunications and transportation.
It's even possible that aging nuclear power plants could shut down
or become dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Worries are so great the State Department authorized the
voluntary departure of employees and family members at the U.S.
embassy, and urged Americans to avoid traveling to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   But while midnight in Moscow will be tense, the next hour may be
even more worrisome. At 5 p.m. EST, the religious pilgrims packing
Israel will welcome the 2,000th anniversary of the birth of Jesus.
Security officials warn that some Christian fanatics could cause
violence, in hopes of triggering the Apocalypse. Islamic terrorists
also are believed to be planning attacks.
</P>
<P>
   During that same hour, midnight will come to Eastern Europe. The
countries there that used to be part of the old Soviet Union may be
the riskiest places on Earth, in terms of Y2K bugs. Those areas
have interlocking power systems and aging computers. The State
Department has issued travel warnings for Ukraine, Moldova and
Belarus because of the high likelihood of dangerous disruptions in
heat and electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Then at 6 p.m. EST, the world will be watching Pope John Paul II
celebrate the beginning of the 3rd millennium of Christianity,
along with about a half-million visitors. Italy is widely
considered to be poorly prepared for Y2K bugs, giving rise to
concerns about blackouts and transportation failures.
</P>
<P>
   At 7 p.m. EST, aviators will be waiting to see whether anything
bad happens during this hour, which marks midnight in Greenwich,
England. Because airlines worldwide operate on Greenwich Mean Time,
this would be the hour when any Y2K bugs would make themselves
known in air traffic control systems.
</P>
<P>
   If no big news has broken out by 7:30 p.m. EST, you might as
well go to dinner; the midnight moment will be passing over the
sparsely populated Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Then at midnight EST, all eyes will turn to the nation's two
biggest party centers: New York City and Washington, D.C. Both
cities are planning blowout celebrations with countdowns and
fireworks, and both fear being targeted by terrorists. It'll be
tough to fully relax until midnight has made its way past Seattle,
San Francisco and Los Angeles, and finally clears Hawaii at 5 a.m.
EST.
</P>
<P>
   And even then, don't expect the fat lady to sing.
</P>
<P>
   Y2K experts say that many software flaws may not become apparent
until Monday, Jan. 3, when factories and offices re-open for
regular business. Other bugs won't appear until companies have gone
through their first billing cycle and employees have gotten their
paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   Even after January, the coast won't be clear. That's because
this February happens to have 29 days. The long February in Leap
Years often confuses computers. Computer programmers say we can't
let down our guard until March.
</P>
<P>
   Which means the first day is the year 2000 is just the start of
a very long vigil. Happy New Year.

   E-nuff already. It is the surest sign that the Internet is
totally mainstream: Everyone is tired of it, not just the
sleep-starved workers at dot-com startups, but everyone _ man and
beast alike. Turn on the television and you are assaulted by an
endless parade of jabbering advertisements for e-commerce
companies. Newspapers are so bloated these days with ads for
dot-com marketers that dogs across the nation must be loosening
their teeth and straining their necks to fetch them.
</P>
<P>
   The latest sign of the times was Time magazine's selection last
week of Jeff Bezos of Amazon.com, the big online retailer of
everything from books to toys, as its ``Person of the Year.''
Time's cover headline declares, ``E-commerce Is Changing the Way
the World Shops.'' Inside is a large picture of Bezos' face,
doctored with a white ``e'' inserted in his left eye. ``An Eye on
the Future,'' says the accompanying headline. Though Bezos is worth
$10 billion, he doesn't really care about the money, Time says. And
a Time reporter says that Amazon's workers are ``all imbued with
this giddy faith that their best days lie ahead of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Innovations in technology and communications _ the telegraph,
telephone, automobile, airplane and others _ have often touched off
waves of optimism and exuberant claims about how the new thing is
going to transform society. In the 1920s, for example, as the
airplane moved beyond the Red Baron stage and started to become
used for carrying civilian passengers, there was a lot of talk of
every household's having a personal airplane in its garage. That
strain of euphoria was called ``air-mindedness.''
</P>
<P>
   Technology historians remain skeptical that the Internet age can
match the period from about the 1880s to 1910 in terms of its
impact on people's lives. Inventions and new products from that
period of technological dynamism included Bessemer steel making,
refrigeration, the light bulb, the phonograph, the telephone, the
radio, the automobile and the airplane.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the historians say, there does seem to be one truly
distinctive feature about the present. ``I don't think there has
ever been anything like the Internet and cyberspace craze in terms
of media hype,'' said Robert Post, a technology historian and a
former curator at the Smithsonian Institution.
</P>
<P>
   The use and abuse of a single vowel _ ``e'' _ also seems without
precedent. And IBM is largely to blame. Since Lou Gerstner took
over in 1993, IBM had been trying to give its image as a mainframe
dinosaur a makeover. By 1995, it was apparent that the Internet was
the future, and the company began promoting itself first as an
expert in ``network-centric computing,'' then ``network computing''
and then ``Internet solutions'' _ before settling on ``e-business''
in fall 1997. Rivals scoffed at first, and then scurried to copy
IBM when the marketing campaign caught on.
</P>
<P>
   By now, all the Internet stories seem familiar _ of dot-com
millionaires, or billionaires, of young people fleeing business
schools, investment banks and consulting firms to join the Internet
gold rush.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Ruettgers, the president of EMC, which sells the big data
storage equipment used by so many e-commerce companies, was
rummaging through his briefcase recently and pulled out a family
picture. It showed his daughter at New York's Metropolitan Museum
of Art, where she worked. Still there? ``Nah, she's 24 and went off
to join a dot-com company like everybody else,'' Ruettgers replied
in a tone that suggested he was belaboring the obvious.
</P>
<P>
   Things could get more interesting if, as some analysts predict,
there will soon be a Darwinian winnowing among dot-com companies
who have bet so much of their venture capital money on ads to try
to become brand names during the do-or-die holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   The winners will play on, while the losers will have little to
show for it and scant chance of raising more money. ``These
companies are burning enormous amounts of cash, and there will be a
massive shakeout in the new year after it becomes clear who did
well and who didn't,'' said Michael Hansen, an e-commerce
specialist at the Boston Consulting Group.

the future, and the company began promoting itself first as an
expert in ``network-centric computing,'' then ``network computing''
and then ``Internet solutions'' _ before settling on ``e-business''
in fall 1997. Rivals scoffed at first, and then scurried to copy
IBM when the marketing campaign caught on.
</P>
<P>
   By now, all the Internet stories seem familiar _ of dot-com
millionaires, or billionaires, of young people fleeing business
schools, investment banks and consulting firms to join the Internet
gold rush.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Ruettgers, the president of EMC, which sells the big data
storage equipment used by so many e-commerce companies, was
rummaging through his briefcase recently and pulled out a family
picture. It showed his daughter at New York's Metropolitan Museum
of Art, where she worked. Still there? ``Nah, she's 24 and went off
to join a dot-com company like everybody else,'' Ruettgers replied
in a tone that suggested he was belaboring the obvious.
</P>
<P>
   Things could get more interesting if, as some analysts predict,
there will soon be a Darwinian winnowing among dot-com companies
who have bet so much of their venture capital money on ads to try
to become brand names during the do-or-die holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   The winners will play on, while the losers will have little to
show for it and scant chance of raising more money. ``These
companies are burning enormous amounts of cash, and there will be a
massive shakeout in the new year after it becomes clear who did
well and who didn't,'' said Michael Hansen, an e-commerce
specialist at the Boston Consulting Group.

   ``To live on little, with contented mind,'' may be the
classically proper attitude toward wealth, but ``little'' and
``contented'' aren't seen together very much these days. A more
appropriate motto would be Oscar Wilde's ``Nothing succeeds like
excess.''
</P>
<P>
   Between the remarkable American economy, which has been growing
for almost nine years, and the dot-com tsunami, which has not yet
crested, the past decade has been a period of unprecedented wealth
creation. Consider that in 1989 there were an estimated 1.9 million
people in the country worth $1 million or more. Today that number
has jumped to about 8 million. The number of American households
worth $10 million or more has also quadrupled over the period,
jumping to 275,000 from 65,000, said Edward Wolff, a professor of
economics at New York University and an expert on wealth.
</P>
<P>
   So much money is sloshing around that it seems to have
overwhelmed the last vestiges of Puritan guilt over spending it. As
the stock market and corporate profits rise, charities nationwide
report that donations from both individuals and companies are
falling. The very idea of wretched excess, of buying as vulgar and
wealth as morally dangerous, has given way to a display-and-play
ethos.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all millionaires and billionaires by the time they're
30,'' said Leonard Ely, a 76-year-old Silicon Valley captain of
industry turned philanthropist. Ask them for a chunk of their
newfound wealth, he added, and ``They'd say, `Look, I don't have my
Ferrari and my place in Tahoe, and you're telling me I should give
money away?'''
</P>
<P>
   The new attitude was on parade at the holiday party thrown by
the society furrier Dennis Basso at the House of the Redeemer on
East 95th Street off Fifth Avenue in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Two rows of black, chauffeured cars lined the block outside the
candlelit Episcopal sanctuary, as guests nibbled caviar and ladies
with newly sculpted faces worshipped, well, fur. Upstairs, Blaine
and Robert Trump held court in the library of the former Vanderbilt
mansion, while Kathy Hilton, wife of an heir to the hotel fortune,
received rave reviews on her pink mink.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Ms. Hilton's coup, sable is de rigueur among the
pelt-wearing classes this year. ``Darling, this was the year of
sable,'' declared Basso. ``They all had to have one.'' Downstairs,
standing next to a cloakroom full of sable coats costing about
$150,000 each, Joan Collins, the former diva on ``Dynasty,'' stood
near several 30-something men in black-tie, who quietly questioned
whether her high cheekbones were real. And Michele Herbert, a Park
Avenue socialite, kissed Basso in gratitude for her $20,000
hand-beaded Russian broadtail suit.
</P>
<P>
   Even Locust Valley, N.Y., the capital of lockjaw and faded
chintz, has lost its bearings. The parking lot of the Piping Rock
Club, once filled with members' 10-year-old ``beater'' paneled
station wagons, now fills up with 3-year-old BMWs instead (and the
children own Porsches).
</P>
<P>
   Is it a new Gilded Age, with many thousands of robber barons,
instead of just a few dozen?
</P>
<P>
   ``There are striking parallels,'' said Jean Strouse, the author
of ``Morgan: American Financier'' (Random House, 1999), who spent
15 years writing and researching the biography of J.P. Morgan
(1837-1913). ``The Internet is very parallel to the building of the
railroads, the telegraph system, the transatlantic cable. People
were buying and building yachts. Enormous floating palaces.
Elaborate houses in Newport. It was an unbelievably lavish time.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an unbelievably lavish time now. ``People seem to be
shopping at two in the morning, three in the morning. That's when
they buy the expensive items,'' said James Finkelstein, the founder
of Luxuryfinder.com, an online merchant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sold out of pashmina blankets at $995 apiece,'' he said.
``We sold out of pashmina pillows for $335. We sold a lot of
caviar. A lot, a lot of caviar.'' The caviar costs $1,150 per 500
grams, but it comes with beautiful mother-of-pearl caviar spoons.
</P>
<P>
   One couple flies their palm trees from Southampton to Palm Beach
in the winter (to keep the trees warm). They also told their
decorator to put down black and white floor tiles to match the
coats of their terriers.
</P>
<P>
   Anastasia Soare, the owner of Anastasia's salon in Beverly
Hills, has grown accustomed to emergency calls from clients just in
from Europe who must have their eyebrows done at once.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was desperate,'' said Ms. Soare of one midnight call. In
response, Ms. Soare, whose shop also perfects the eyebrows of Naomi
Campbell, Jennifer Lopez, Lara Flynn Boyle and Kate Capshaw, packed
up tools in her own home in Benedict Canyon and drove across town
to her client's home. There, she performed an emergency pluck, cut
and wax. Charge: $400 to $3,000 (the latter price for flying cross
country) for as little as a five-minute session.
</P>
<P>
   Others fly their linens to Paris to be dry-cleaned. ``It's well
worth it,'' said one women at a Park Avenue cocktail party, as she
tossed her purple pashmina shawl around her shoulders. It better
be, since the tab in some homes runs to $6,000-a-month.
</P>
<P>
   It's exhausting, all this spending. Ms. Herbert, who is married
to the chairman of Pantone, a company specializing in color
graphics, talked about how hectic it is to keep up with everything.
``Let me put it this way, it would be easier if I had a job!'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   To help them keep up, the rich are hiring helpers, and even
helpers for their helpers. Mark Simone, a 44-year-old bachelor who
lives between New York and Greenwich, Conn., flipped through his
black book the other day and recited how many women he knows who
have multiple social secretaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you know how common it is for these women who do
nothing to have two secretaries,'' Simone said. ``I can think of 20
who have two.'' He equated it to having a cat. ``When you're not
home all day, you need to get another one to keep the first one
company.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the Hamptons, the magic number for summer help was four: A
houseman (to change the light bulbs and make sure there's Diet Coke
on ice), a laundress, a chef and a housekeeper.
</P>
<P>
   Children are equally the beneficiaries of excess. It's there to
be seen on any rainy day outside Nightingale-Bamford, an all-girls
private school on the Upper East Side. Ten-year-olds stand in
front, calling their very own town cars on their very own cellular
phones. An entire seventh-grade class at another New York private
school flew to Barbados for a birthday weekend. And a doting father
recently paid $17,000 to rent the F.A.O. Schwarz flagship toy store
on Fifth Avenue for his 12-year-old daughter's birthday slumber
party.
</P>
<P>
   At 3 a.m. one 12-year-old turned to another, both dressed in
flannel feetsy pajamas, and said ``We'll be in business together.''
Her friend said, ``We'll be Greenberg and Leff.'' And they would
make lots of money because the first girl knew all the ``lawyer
words.'' She recited: ``Malpractice, liability.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Malpractice, liability,'' repeated her friend.
</P>
<P>
   One young woman, who spent 13 years in the New York private
school system and is a freshman at Cornell University, pointed out
the importance of the status of such things. ``Cell phones, town
cars, country houses, and kids whose parents who have really cool
jobs have no problem making friends,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said that vacations were really important, too. ``If you go
to Florida for vacation you're not going away,'' the girl said.
Why? ``On a vacation you have to see clear water; in Florida, the
water is murky.''
</P>
<P>
   So, the rich at least, have got what they wished for. Which is
exactly what the gods are supposed to give us _ before they drive
us mad.

WHAT IF BRADLEY HAD CALLED GORE'S BLUFF? 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(jw) 
 By ADAM CLYMER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ On one level, Vice President Al Gore's
proposal to scrap all 30-second television spots in favor of
twice-weekly debates with former Sen. Bill Bradley was just what
the senator said it was: a campaign ploy. To be sure, it was a
modestly imaginative gambit that seemed to annoy Bradley by making
him defend the political system he prefers to deplore.
</P>
<P>
   But the idea is worth thinking about in two other contexts: as a
way of communicating with voters, and as a campaign spending
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   These days the only way most voters hear about Gov. George W.
Bush's views on education is by watching images of cute children
while listening to him promise local control, ``charters and
choice'' and phonics to teach reading. But if Gore's idea were
taken up, voters could hear candidates explain in depth what local
school boards should control and how much new plans would cost.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the Supreme Court banned campaign spending limits in
1976 as a violation of free speech, critics have sought indirect
ways to curb the spiraling costs of running for office.
</P>
<P>
   Their efforts became particularly urgent after politicians came
up with the idea of ``soft money'' donations in 1988. These are the
unlimited contributions made to party organizations by fat cats,
corporations and unions. The remaining contribution limits that the
Supreme Court had allowed became meaningless, and as a result
presidential elections today are hardly more regulated than they
were when the Watergate scandals led to the 1974 Federal Election
Campaign Act.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the dominant approach in Congress, backed by both
Democratic presidential candidates, is to ban soft money, which
theoretically goes to party building, but in fact buys thousands of
30-second spots _ both positive and negative _ about candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation prohibiting soft money commands majority support in
Congress, but Republican filibusters in the Senate have killed it
twice since 1997. Meanwhile, both parties are raking in soft money
as fast as they can.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' claim to virtue, based on their votes against the
filibusters, is no stronger in practice than the Republicans', as
evidenced by last week's disclosure that Democratic Party officials
had set up committees to funnel such donations into several Senate
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's challenge to Bradley last week is another indirect
approach to a spending curb. He would forswear the most costly way
to spend campaign cash: the 30-second television spots, whose price
rises sharply each election cycle. If nobody bought 30-second spots
praising or condemning candidates like competing brands of laundry
detergent, campaign costs would drop dramatically _ and the level
of political discourse might rise.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody expects that to happen.
</P>
<P>
   In this campaign, Bradley, after three years out of politics,
plainly needs television ads to introduce himself to voters. And in
subsequent campaigns, at least one side will surely see the need
for commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, perhaps not. Look at the history of presidential
debates. After the Kennedy-Nixon encounters of 1960, there were no
presidential debates in 1964, 1968 or 1972. In each of those
election years, one candidate held a big lead and saw no point in
legitimizing his rivals by sharing a television screen. The
conventional wisdom at the time was that somebody would always have
an advantage, and so no presidential candidates would ever debate
again.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, Jimmy Carter was up about 30 points in the polls after
the Republican convention. But his campaign managers thought the
lead was anything but solid and figured that debates could show
Carter had the stature to be president. So when President Ford
challenged him to debate, Carter accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Today, general election debates are regular parts of
presidential campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, it is not easy to visualize a situation in which
both sides would reject campaign advertising. Even the spots people
say they hate _ the attack ads that Gore has promised not to use in
any event _ are effective. They help politicians get elected.
</P>
<P>
   Critics like Fred Wertheimer argue, though, that those ads also
make it harder for politicians to govern because of the cynicism
the spots engender. And Robert Teeter, a Republican consultant, is
among those who argue that the public may be getting fed up, that
it wants to hear directly from candidates through debates,
interviews, short speeches _ almost any forum where the candidate
is talking live without production gimmicks.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who insists he has not given up on the idea, said last
week: ``I think the American people would love it. I think they
find the current way of doing things pretty boring.''

were when the Watergate scandals led to the 1974 Federal Election
Campaign Act.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the dominant approach in Congress, backed by both
Democratic presidential candidates, is to ban soft money, which
theoretically goes to party building, but in fact buys thousands of
30-second spots _ both positive and negative _ about candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation prohibiting soft money commands majority support in
Congress, but Republican filibusters in the Senate have killed it
twice since 1997. Meanwhile, both parties are raking in soft money
as fast as they can.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' claim to virtue, based on their votes against the
filibusters, is no stronger in practice than the Republicans', as
evidenced by last week's disclosure that Democratic Party officials
had set up committees to funnel such donations into several Senate
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's challenge to Bradley last week is another indirect
approach to a spending curb. He would forswear the most costly way
to spend campaign cash: the 30-second television spots, whose price
rises sharply each election cycle. If nobody bought 30-second spots
praising or condemning candidates like competing brands of laundry
detergent, campaign costs would drop dramatically _ and the level
of political discourse might rise.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody expects that to happen.
</P>
<P>
   In this campaign, Bradley, after three years out of politics,
plainly needs television ads to introduce himself to voters. And in
subsequent campaigns, at least one side will surely see the need
for commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, perhaps not. Look at the history of presidential
debates. After the Kennedy-Nixon encounters of 1960, there were no
presidential debates in 1964, 1968 or 1972. In each of those
election years, one candidate held a big lead and saw no point in
legitimizing his rivals by sharing a television screen. The
conventional wisdom at the time was that somebody would always have
an advantage, and so no presidential candidates would ever debate
again.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, Jimmy Carter was up about 30 points in the polls after
the Republican convention. But his campaign managers thought the
lead was anything but solid and figured that debates could show
Carter had the stature to be president. So when President Ford
challenged him to debate, Carter accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Today, general election debates are regular parts of
presidential campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, it is not easy to visualize a situation in which
both sides would reject campaign advertising. Even the spots people
say they hate _ the attack ads that Gore has promised not to use in
any event _ are effective. They help politicians get elected.
</P>
<P>
   Critics like Fred Wertheimer argue, though, that those ads also
make it harder for politicians to govern because of the cynicism
the spots engender. And Robert Teeter, a Republican consultant, is
among those who argue that the public may be getting fed up, that
it wants to hear directly from candidates through debates,
interviews, short speeches _ almost any forum where the candidate
is talking live without production gimmicks.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who insists he has not given up on the idea, said last
week: ``I think the American people would love it. I think they
find the current way of doing things pretty boring.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Racist profiling at work
 &HT;    (For release Dec. 29, 1999.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ It really isn't ``racial profiling'' so much as it is
``racist profiling,'' a far harsher term but one richly earned. The
oft-repeated incidents of singling out minorities, particularly
blacks, for immoderate exclusion or scrutiny hangs like an
albatross around the neck of this democracy-for-some.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the premier example of racist profiling is the case of
brothers, one 23 and the other 19, killed last month in an
automobile accident on an interstate highway near Fort Lauderdale.
Highway patrol officers on the scene reported that the brothers,
who were black, were traveling in the wrong direction and ran
headfirst into another car traveling in the correct direction. They
also suggested the dead may have been drunk or on drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The person in the other car was white and an FBI agent. He
lived.
</P>
<P>
   There was nobody to tell the Florida Highway Patrol which car
was traveling in the wrong direction; it was just an assumption
distorted as actuality; i.e., if there are two young black men and
a white guy in an accident, then the black men must have caused it.
</P>
<P>
   A month later, after their distraught mother's persistent
defense of her sons _ one was studying to be a computer engineer,
the other was dreaming of opening his own church _ plus some
scrutiny about how the officers on the scene came to make their
judgment, the story turned 180 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Now the facts are in, and the police have embarrassed
themselves. It was the FBI agent, with a blood-alcohol level twice
the legal limit, who wandered into the wrong lane and killed the
young brothers.
</P>
<P>
   The police were quick to call it ``an honest mistake.'' I would
agree, so long as the police concede that this type of ``honest
mistake'' is made often when it comes to determining culpability
between whites and blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Not far from there, in Miami Beach, a black couple having dinner
in a Thai restaurant saw there was a 15 percent service charge
added to their dinner bill. There was no such inclusion on bills
for whites at the next table. The owner of the establishment
claimed that blacks don't tip well and that's why the 15 percent is
on the checks of black customers.
</P>
<P>
   That's racist profiling. The owner and victims will meet next in
civil court.
</P>
<P>
   A little less conspicuous but an inequity nevertheless was an
incident I witnessed at a National Hockey League game in Sunrise,
Fla., three nights before Christmas Eve.
</P>
<P>
   As fans enter their sections of the arena, ushers require them
to show their ticket stubs. No problem there. But between periods,
most of those fans move back and forth to concession stands,
restrooms, etc. On the way back, it is rare _ very rare, almost
never _ that the usher will ask to see the ticket stub again.
</P>
<P>
   This night he did, to a 14-year-old or so black male. The
youngster produced the stub and continued on to his $60 seat below
me, joining his mother, father and brother. I don't know if he said
anything about the episode to his folks, and I suspect he didn't,
racist profiling being a fact of life for young blacks.
</P>
<P>
   I write of this, not so much to condemn the South Florida area
as a hotbed of racist profiling _ there's voluminous competition
around the rest of the country _ but to cite three incidents in
just one month's time that were visible. Imagine how much goes on
that we don't see or hear.
</P>
<P>
   More than 60 years ago, Miami Beach acquired a reputation that
blacks in the city after sundown had to produce identification or
be shuffled off to jail. The timeworn legend was that this was the
law.
</P>
<P>
   After diligent research and the finding of the actual 1936 city
ordinance, it is clear that all persons, black or white, working in
tourist-oriented jobs had to have the ID. Blacks, Negroes or
coloreds are not mentioned in the ordinance.
</P>
<P>
   But the rub was this: Blacks seen on the street after dark were
asked by police to produce their ID, whites weren't. The assumption
was that blacks had no business in the resort area unless they were
waiting tables or washing dishes.
</P>
<P>
   It was racist profiling in its early stages, backed by a
statewide policy of segregation. That buttressing element,
segregation, has been dissolved, but racist profiling seems to have
a life of its own.

FORGET THE MILLENNIUM. TRY TO PREDICT ONE WEEK.

(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)

<P>
   Six shopping days left until the century cusp, and the average
shopper has stopped ordering bulk shipments of mineral water and
started making lunch dates for January. Pundits who spent the fall
debating portents of doom have begun making predictions about the
next hundred years and the next thousand.
</P>
<P>
   Awaiting the apocalypse couldn't have remained a national sport
for long. After all, the whole fun of a national sport is rooting
for some guy, no matter how messed up he is, and wondering whether
he'll prevail against incredible odds. If the Messiah showed up He
would just prevail. What fun is that? The final weeks of most
centuries have been more nerve-racking than the denouement of this
one.
</P>
<P>
   The first time a century ended, members of a desert religious
sect got themselves buried in Qumran with their graves facing north
so they could greet the Messiah when He resurrected them. He didn't
show.
</P>
<P>
   In the 990s, Christian priests took the Vikings to be the
biblical destroyers from Gog and Magog bringing the end of the
world. Turned out they were just Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   Today the world is still intact, despite gloomy predictions from
the heavy hitters of prophecy. The mystic Edgar Cayce, who
accurately predicted the stock market crash of 1929, predicted that
the American coasts would flood in 1998. Jeane Dixon, the
astrologer who foresaw John F. Kennedy's assassination, thought a
world war would be fought in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Most notably the world was supposed to explode this past July,
according to Nostradamus, who wrote cryptic prophetic verses in
1555 and usually hated to give a verifiable date. But he liked it
when numbers came in threes, so in one of his rare specific moods
he foretold the Great Fire of 1666: ``The blood of the just will be
required in London/burned by fire in thrice twenty and six.''
</P>
<P>
   In another precise moment, he pinpointed this past July as a
time of war and heaven-sent destruction: ``In the year 1999 seven
months,/From the sky will come a great King of Terror. ... Before
and afterwards Mars rules happily.'' Interpreters of the verse have
seen the King of Terror as a fusion weapon, a nuclear warhead or a
spaceship due to land around Independence Day. (Could he have been
anticipating the movie?)
</P>
<P>
   After July came and went, fans of eschatological prophecy calmed
down a bit. But the big breakthrough came in September, the start
of the academic year, with the arrival of next year's day planners,
the Filofaxes and the art calendars in stationery stores. Ancient
mystics did not have stationery stores and could remain riled up
for longer. Contemporary mystics had to face facts. How could time
both be ending and also be mapped out on so many glossy sheets of
cardboard? Anticipating the end suddenly seemed not a sign of faith
and imagination but just a good excuse to put off one's car
payments.
</P>
<P>
   But now that the mood has changed from predicting the end to
predicting the future, the time frame seems too long term. How can
we think about the next century or the next millennium, when it's
hard enough to tell what's going to happen this week?
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry. A round-up of predictions for the coming week
appears below. Unlike predictions for the year 3000, these can be
verified. Just keep this newspaper around until next Sunday.  &QL;

AMERICA MOVES APART FROM THE U.N. ON IRAQ

   UNITED NATIONS _ A year ago, the world was mesmerized by the
spectacle of exploding rockets lighting the skies over Baghdad as
American and British warplanes taught Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein a lesson about defying U.N. arms inspections. A year later,
it is clear that the fireworks were obscuring another reality: the
final retreat of the Clinton administration from a policy of making
the United Nations the focal point of policy on Iraq _ and, indeed,
from making Iraq a focal point of policy.
</P>
<P>
   Now fixed on the glittering prize of a broader Middle East peace
among Israel and its neighbors, the administration has let Iraq
slip into the middle distance, where it is likely to remain for the
last year of the Clinton era unless Saddam does something very
foolish and provocative.
</P>
<P>
   American policy, which once put so much focus on U.N. arms
inspections to restrain Saddam's military ambitions, seems now to
rely on more quietly keeping him hemmed in with sanctions, period.
If his weapons programs get to a really dangerous point, new
large-scale bombing is always an option anyway.
</P>
<P>
   For many diplomats here, the most telling sign of Iraq's eclipse
was the decision of Richard Holbrooke, the powerful new American
representative at the United Nations, to give no priority to the
issue here when he arrived in the fall, just as final negotiations
on creating a new arms inspection system to monitor the Iraqis were
reaching a crucial point.
</P>
<P>
   That system was adopted by the Security Council a week ago but
is likely to take months to put into place _ if it can be put in
place at all, given Iraq's immediate outrage at the very idea.
</P>
<P>
   From the vantage point of the United Nations, the American
policy on Iraq now seems to be on autopilot. A senior American
official recently told a group of foreign policy experts that only
a handful of people in the United States either knew or cared about
the issue, an indication that the policy was hardly under active
review.
</P>
<P>
   For at least two years, the administration has been focused
almost exclusively on two projects: first, continuing sanctions to
try to weaken the Iraqi government and slow its quest for new
weapons of mass destruction, and second, supporting the Iraqi
opposition in exile, even though it is fragmented and few people
take it seriously as an immediate threat to Saddam. Many experts
say the only possibility of overthrow that Saddam really fears is a
palace coup.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the continuing standoff with Saddam. No arms inspections
are likely soon, and therefore there is no end in sight for
sanctions, which Saddam sees as a gross insult to Iraq's
sovereignty, as is American enforcement of no-flight zones in the
north and south, where Iraq fires on American planes and the planes
keep bombing Iraq's air defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Nine years after the Gulf War, many nations have come to
disagree with the United States that sanctions by themselves should
be the bedrock of an Iraq policy. The Arabs, for example, have said
the Americans long ago became cynical about inspections _ that they
stopped wanting the inspections to work, because if Iraq ever
passed the test it would lead to the liberation of Saddam from the
box into which sanctions help keep him. The inspections also tied
American policy to an activity carried out not by Americans, but by
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that the sanctions regime has lost virtually all the
support it once enjoyed around the world _ and that Saddam Hussein
is still firmly in place _ seems to matter very little in
Washington's thinking,'' said David Malone, a Canadian diplomat who
is president of the International Peace Academy, a research
organization with close ties to the diplomats at the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he said, ``once it became clear that partners in the
Security Council, particularly among the permanent five, were no
longer willing to support sanctions, Washington had a choice to
make between Security Council solidarity and sanctions'' to support
its goal of containing Iraq, said Malone.

   With the decision in favor of sanctions, rather than any
inspection regime the council could readily agree on, it became
inevitable that the chief U.N. arms inspection official, Richard
Butler, would soon feel a chill wind. Now, in the final days before
his agency is disbanded, there is a palpable bitterness among its
inspectors at having been sold out by Washington.
</P>
<P>
   After the effective end of inspections a year ago, it took many
months for the Security Council to decide what to do next. It is
telling that when the new plan was drawn up, the United States left
most of the work to others, stepping in only at critical points to
make sure the Iraqis will have months of work to do before they can
get to even a temporary suspension of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   If America's attitude toward working with the United Nations on
Iraq has seemed ambivalent and opaque to other countries, so too
has the attitude of Secretary-General Kofi Annan seemed confusing
to Americans and the U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   It has been almost two years since Annan went to Iraq to talk
Saddam into a modicum of cooperation with the inspection agency,
known as Unscom. The months that followed, in retrospect, can be
seen as the moment when the United States began disengaging from
the United Nations on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Annan's mission led to sham diplomatic inspections of off-limits
Iraqi palaces in the glare of publicity, while Unscom was prevented
from doing any real work. But Washington was surprisingly
uncritical. Then, after Iraq was bombed in December 1998,
administration officials in Washington leaked reports of how the
United States had long used Unscom and, by extension, the United
Nations for spying on Iraq. Malone called these leaks ``profoundly
damaging'' to Butler.
</P>
<P>
   But in a recent interview, Butler said that much of the blame
for what went wrong rested not in Washington but in the secretary
general's office, where he found some staff members ``deeply
sympathetic'' to Iraq. ``They made it clear to me after a while
that this actual pursuit of weapons was inadequately diplomatic,''
he said, still angry that Saddam, a documented liar in dealing with
inspectors and a concealer of poison gas, germ warfare and a
nuclear program, should get white-glove treatment from the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   There is a paradox here. In recent months Annan has become very
outspoken and self-critical about the mistakes the United Nations
makes when it tries to treat abusers of their own populations with
the nonjudgmental neutrality accorded other heads of government.
Some people are just evil, a recent report on the 1995 fall of
Srebrenica and the subsequent massacre of its Muslim population
recently concluded. Annan has been stung in Bosnia, Serbia and
Rwanda _ and said so with extraordinary contrition. He has
criticized Russian action in Chechnya and supported NATO in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But Iraq? By the evidence of U.N. Human Rights Commission
monitors and human rights organizations, Saddam rules with ruthless
terror and is not squeamish about gassing his own population or
using the suffering of civilians as a propaganda tool. Annan's
entourage does not dwell on this.
</P>
<P>
   Annan now has a huge challenge ahead of him. The Security
Council has given him a month to choose a successor to Butler to
head a new inspection commission. Signs of American interest are
conspicuously absent. Although the strength or weakness of the
choice will be important, American diplomats say the United States
doesn't have a favored candidate in the race.

 FLYING CORKS, KILLER POINSETTIAS AND OTHER HOLIDAY HAZARDS  (The
Week in Review) 
(jw) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's the peak of the holiday season, and the air is filled with
apocalyptic warnings tied to the turn of the millennium. But there
is plenty more to worry about than serious threats like terrorism,
doomsday cults and Y2K calamities.
</P>
<P>
   As usual at this time of year, the perennial peril profiteers,
seasonal scolds and year-end yentas are busy issuing warnings and
advice on more mundane dangers. And with the clock winding down on
the century, the worry warts are in full throat, as evidenced by
the following alarming bulletins culled from recent press releases
and news reports.
</P>
<P>
   _ JOE SHARKEY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   YOU COULD POKE YOUR EYE OUT
</P>
<P>
   Is your Champagne Y2K ready? Before you open a bottle of your
favorite bubbly to toast the promise of a new millennium this New
Year's Eve, make sure it's cold.
</P>
<P>
   The American Academy of Ophthalmology, the world's largest
association of eye M.D.s (ophthalmologists), wants to remind you
that warm bottles of Champagne, coupled with bad technique, are
responsible for causing serious, blinding injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Every few months, academy spokesperson Anne Sumers M.D. sees the
devastating results: ... ruptured eyeballs, detached retinas, the
loss of an eye. Contrary to popular belief, Sumers says her
patients were not fooling around, recklessly aiming bottles at
people, but had simply reached for a warm bottle and popped the
cork.
</P>
<P>
   ``It usually doesn't happen with the first bottle of Champagne,
because it has been on ice, but with a third or fourth bottle that
hasn't been fully chilled. A warm bottle explodes much sooner and
with greater force than a cold bottle,'' said Sumers.
</P>
<P>
   And once it explodes, it's like a bullet.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   WHY NOT STUFF THE TURKEY WITH OATMEAL
</P>
<P>
   How many times have you made a New Year's resolution to lose
five to 10 pounds that you gained during the holiday season? ...
New research suggests a novel strategy: eating a bowl of oatmeal
for breakfast might make it easier to stuff the turkey and not
yourself this holiday season. ..
</P>
<P>
   Death rates from heart attacks are relatively steady through
November and shoot up after Thanksgiving through Christmas, peaking
around the first of the year. This could be attributed to increased
food, alcohol and salt consumption and increased stress. ...
</P>
<P>
   _ Press release from the Quaker Oats Co. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NO HOLIDAY FOR JUNIOR
</P>
<P>
   With the hustle and bustle of the holiday season, parents toilet
training their toddlers may be tempted to put it on hold until
January. ``Don't give up,'' said Dr. Timothy Schum, lead researcher
on the most comprehensive toilet-training study ... ``Our research
shows that once you've moved a child out of diapers and into
disposable training pants, cloth training pants or underwear, you
can keep making progress. No matter how much the holidays disrupt
your schedule, hang in there and you'll keep moving forward.
Remember that the holidays are a time for family and memories and
even toilet training.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Press release from Kimberly-Clark, makers of Pull-Ups training
pants. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PET PERILS
</P>
<P>
   New Year's brings in a brand new year filled with the promise of
hope, prosperity, health and happiness. But be alert to any pet
hazards such as fun noisemakers [which) can frighten your pet,
causing your pet to bolt out an open door or window. ...
</P>
<P>
   Caution: Those adorable holiday costumes for your pets may be
cute at get-togethers or in family photos, but pet owners should be
wary of costumes which have rubber bands to keep them securely in
place. ... If rubber bands are accidentally left on the pet after
the fun of dressing up is over, the pet could chew off and swallow
them, causing choking. ... Resist the temptation to tie ribbons
around pets' necks for the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   -- From the Web site of Pawprints and Purrs, an animal welfare
organization (www.sniksnak.com/holidays.html) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Don't let the family dog take a bite out of your special
occasion. Even a friendly dog can be overwhelmed and stressed out
with all the holiday excitement, says C.W. Meisterfeld Ph.D.,
canine psychoanalyst based in PETaluma, Calif. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Should your dog express any warning signs towards your guests
DON'T try to force the dog to socialize. It is far more prudent to
put Fido away until all guests have left,'' says Meisterfeld.
</P>
<P>
   _ Press release for Meisterfeld's School for Canine Training &AMP;
Education &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An unprecedented 62 percent of Americans buy gifts for their
pets. ... ``The holidays are the perfect time to think about
protecting your pet from accidents and illnesses,'' says Dr. Jim
Humphries, author and leading authority on veterinary care. ``One
trip to the emergency clinic for a pet who requires surgery after
ingesting tinsel or a toy is all it takes to understand the value
of Veterinary Pet Insurance.''

   It's the peak of the holiday season, and the air is filled with
apocalyptic warnings tied to the turn of the millennium. But there
is plenty more to worry about than serious threats like terrorism,
doomsday cults and Y2K calamities.
</P>
<P>
   As usual at this time of year, the perennial peril profiteers,
seasonal scolds and year-end yentas are busy issuing warnings and
advice on more mundane dangers. And with the clock winding down on
the century, the worry warts are in full throat, as evidenced by
the following alarming bulletins culled from recent press releases
and news reports.
</P>
<P>
   _ JOE SHARKEY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   YOU COULD POKE YOUR EYE OUT
</P>
<P>
   Is your Champagne Y2K ready? Before you open a bottle of your
favorite bubbly to toast the promise of a new millennium this New
Year's Eve, make sure it's cold.
</P>
<P>
   The American Academy of Ophthalmology, the world's largest
association of eye M.D.s (ophthalmologists), wants to remind you
that warm bottles of Champagne, coupled with bad technique, are
responsible for causing serious, blinding injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Every few months, academy spokesperson Anne Sumers M.D. sees the
devastating results: ... ruptured eyeballs, detached retinas, the
loss of an eye. Contrary to popular belief, Sumers says her
patients were not fooling around, recklessly aiming bottles at
people, but had simply reached for a warm bottle and popped the
cork.
</P>
<P>
   ``It usually doesn't happen with the first bottle of Champagne,
because it has been on ice, but with a third or fourth bottle that
hasn't been fully chilled. A warm bottle explodes much sooner and
with greater force than a cold bottle,'' said Sumers.
</P>
<P>
   And once it explodes, it's like a bullet.

   WHY NOT STUFF THE TURKEY WITH OATMEAL
</P>
<P>
   How many times have you made a New Year's resolution to lose
five to 10 pounds that you gained during the holiday season? ...
New research suggests a novel strategy: eating a bowl of oatmeal
for breakfast might make it easier to stuff the turkey and not
yourself this holiday season. ..
</P>
<P>
   Death rates from heart attacks are relatively steady through
November and shoot up after Thanksgiving through Christmas, peaking
around the first of the year. This could be attributed to increased
food, alcohol and salt consumption and increased stress. ...

<P>
   NO HOLIDAY FOR JUNIOR
</P>
<P>
   With the hustle and bustle of the holiday season, parents toilet
training their toddlers may be tempted to put it on hold until
January. ``Don't give up,'' said Dr. Timothy Schum, lead researcher
on the most comprehensive toilet-training study ... ``Our research
shows that once you've moved a child out of diapers and into
disposable training pants, cloth training pants or underwear, you
can keep making progress. No matter how much the holidays disrupt
your schedule, hang in there and you'll keep moving forward.
Remember that the holidays are a time for family and memories and
even toilet training.''

   PET PERILS
</P>
<P>
   New Year's brings in a brand new year filled with the promise of
hope, prosperity, health and happiness. But be alert to any pet
hazards such as fun noisemakers [which) can frighten your pet,
causing your pet to bolt out an open door or window. ...
</P>
<P>
   Caution: Those adorable holiday costumes for your pets may be
cute at get-togethers or in family photos, but pet owners should be
wary of costumes which have rubber bands to keep them securely in
place. ... If rubber bands are accidentally left on the pet after
the fun of dressing up is over, the pet could chew off and swallow
them, causing choking. ... Resist the temptation to tie ribbons
around pets' necks for the holidays.

organization (www.sniksnak.com/holidays.html) &QL;

<P>
   Don't let the family dog take a bite out of your special
occasion. Even a friendly dog can be overwhelmed and stressed out
with all the holiday excitement, says C.W. Meisterfeld Ph.D.,
canine psychoanalyst based in PETaluma, Calif. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Should your dog express any warning signs towards your guests
DON'T try to force the dog to socialize. It is far more prudent to
put Fido away until all guests have left,'' says Meisterfeld.

   An unprecedented 62 percent of Americans buy gifts for their
pets. ... ``The holidays are the perfect time to think about
protecting your pet from accidents and illnesses,'' says Dr. Jim
Humphries, author and leading authority on veterinary care. ``One
trip to the emergency clinic for a pet who requires surgery after
ingesting tinsel or a toy is all it takes to understand the value
of Veterinary Pet Insurance.''

   For many adults, those holiday visits to the old homestead that
are supposed to look like a Norman Rockwell painting end up feeling
more like ``The Scream.'' That's because the opening of gifts is
often accompanied by the opening of old wounds, grudges and
longstanding family arguments.

issues say adults can take steps to minimize the chance for
conflict during holiday visits.

dangerous time of the year, too. ...
</P>
<P>
   Food that is not prepared properly or left on buffet tables too
long can become a breeding ground for deadly bacteria. ...
Half-consumed holiday drinks, especially a pretty punch that looks
like juice, can be very tempting to a child who may be up before
you the next morning. But just a few gulps of a holiday beverage
with alcohol in it can poison a child. .... Cigarette butts,
sometimes left in ashtrays or drink glasses after a holiday party,
can be toxic to little children.
</P>
<P>
   Holiday plants lend a festive mood to your home, but many plants
are a danger to children who may be curious about their taste.
</P>
<P>
   Spending time with family and special friends is my favorite
part of the holidays. But holiday visitors may bring personal care
products and medicines. ...
</P>
<P>
   Brightly colored pills and vitamins are very attractive to
children. Please, take the extra precautions if you have young ones
in your house, so you can all enjoy the holiday celebrations, the
family gatherings, the spirit of the season. Happy, healthy
holidays to all!

 &HT;    Progress seems to pass me by
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Progress, as far as I'm concerned, is a dirty
word, and planning ahead runs a close second. I'm just not good at
it.
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, I seem to have spent most of my life playing catch-up.
Like the time my mother threw a Burdine's bag with two bras in it
on the bed and ordered me to put one of them on and I refused
saying I wasn't ready for that kind of stuff. I reminded her I was,
after all, (SET ITAL)only(END ITAL) 15.
</P>
<P>
   The reason the march of time always catches me flat-footed, I
suspect, is because I loathe change. Had it been left up to me,
Henry Ford would never have built the Model-T because there
wouldn't have been any of those round things for it to roll on.
</P>
<P>
   While all of my friends are experimenting with DVD and eBay, I'm
still happy with a cable-unready television and a 20-year-old VCR
that quit recording in 1983. And as for shopping the Internet?
Forget it. My L.L.Bean catalog has never let me down and when I
call them, a real person answers.
</P>
<P>
   I was barely 5 the morning my mother dressed me up, pinned a
handkerchief to my jumper, and dragged me kicking and screaming to
kindergarten. School didn't coincide with my plans for that day, I
complained. I wasn't ready. Some things in life are not optional,
she explained.
</P>
<P>
   And just about the time I found myself easing into the school
groove, somebody told me I was graduating. Say what? Sorry, I said,
I'm not ready to leave.
</P>
<P>
   GO! I was told. I went, but I had no idea what came next.
College, my mother said. Not ready, I said. Then, get a job, she
said. A WHAT?
</P>
<P>
   Soon my friends were settling down with husbands and learning to
cook. I was still trying to decide on a university. About the time
they were starting families, I was looking for a job.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, I came up with a husband of my own (SET ITAL)and(END
ITAL) a stove, but I still didn't get it. And then my son came
along. One day he was 21-inches long and I was wrapping him in
flannel jammies _ the next he was 6 feet 5 and we couldn't find
jeans long enough for his legs. One day he was this spiffed-up
little kid climbing the too-tall stairs of a big blue schoolbus,
and the next he was standing in a garden promising to love, honor,
and obey while I wondered if he had enough clean clothes for the
honeymoon.
</P>
<P>
   And now an entire century has gotten away from me and once
again, I've been caught with my plans down. There is no time to
build a backyard bunker and stock it with automatic weapons so I
can shoot the neighbors if they try to steal my food and water. Nor
is there time to withdraw my life savings and stuff it into the
mattress.
</P>
<P>
   This morning a friend called to ask if my computer was
2000-ready. I told him I didn't know and asked what it might take
to accomplish that. An ominous cluck was his reply followed by a
suggestion that if I had to ask, it was probably already too late.
And when I told him the Underwood had a new ribbon in it he asked
me how I planned to get online with a 1938 typewriter.
</P>
<P>
   I do have a month's supply of cat food in the pantry, however,
and four 5-gallon jugs of water the Culligan man left in the
basement last week. And if the power goes off and with it the
boiler that heats the house, I still have the gas logs in the
fireplace. And should the natural gas flow be interrupted, then I
guess the cat and I will go sit in the car with the heater running
until it comes back on ... or until we run out of gas because the
pumps at Tom's Sunoco have glitched.
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, the whole millenium thing has passed me by so I've
decided not to worry about any of it. My plan is to take the cat
and go to bed early on the 31st and set the alarm for July, by
which time the entire mess will have straightened itself out and no
one will discover that, as usual, I've turned up a day late and a
dollar short.
</P>
<P>
   Happy 2000!

 &HT;    Need some tech support? If you can
 &HT;    get online, sites are filled with advice
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As sure as Christmas, some of you will have trouble
with that new computer you got as a holiday gift.
</P>
<P>
   If it's the only way you have of getting onto the World Wide
Web, you'll have to make do with help from friends or dial the
company's support line by telephone. But if you have another
computer and can get on the Web, there are literally dozens of free
sites that offer computer advice and help.
</P>
<P>
   We'll start with PC Help Desk, a really fine service offered
from the site located at www
</P>
<P>
   .pc-helpdesk.com/.
</P>
<P>
   There are rich databases of information, arranged by category,
on this page, so you may be able to find the answer simply by
clicking your mouse. But there are many other ways of getting help
here, including real-time online chat with other users and by
e-mail. You'll also find Y2K advice, just in case the bug bites you
New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail service probably is the most valuable, since you can
ask a specific question and get the answer by mail.
</P>
<P>
   CyberNet Information Station at www.cyberpc.com/ seems to be
geared toward offering help with Internet and Web questions. But
there also are databases that offer to help with Microsoft Windows.
This site also has a download section where you can find updates
for the programs you use, drivers (the small software programs used
by devices such as printers and modems) and utility programs that
help you make adjustments to Windows.
</P>
<P>
   TipWorld has nothing at all to do with horse racing. It is a
good bet, however, that you'll get help at
www.tipworld.com/0,2724,,0.html for your PC woes. The best feature
of this site is its organization. The PC tips are organized into
logical areas such as operating systems, the Internet, graphics,
computer care and networks.
</P>
<P>
   As is true with the previous site, you'll find a download area
for shareware and freeware programs.
</P>
<P>
   While many other sites offer general computer help, some of the
best advice comes directly from the source: the company that sold
you the computer or software. Almost certainly you'll find the Web
address in the manuals that came with your programs and computer.
Try those sites first.
</P>
<P>
   Also remember that the Microsoft site is massive and _ if your
questions or problems concern Windows or another Microsoft program
_ it's an excellent resource. The site is located at
www.microsoft.com. But since there is so much information stored
here, you'll almost certainly need to use the search feature at the
site.
</P>
<P>
   Intel, which makes the chips that power many PCs, has a site at
www.intel.com. As is true with the Microsoft site, you'll find
helpful information here. If your computer is powered by the AMD
chip _ which competes with Intel chips _ go to the site at
www.amd.com.
</P>
<P>
   Apple Macintosh owners can find help and an excellent source of
information at www.apple
</P>
<P>
   .com.

 &HT;    Taking the Internet out of `the dark ages'
 &HT;    By Heather Cocks
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Above Alan Tannenbaum's desk, overlooking his
high-tech gadgets and powerful computers, hangs an eerily prescient
picture.
</P>
<P>
   The illustration depicts a woman wearing her World Wide Web
browser. A portable computer connected to a headset projects a tiny
computer screen in front of her eye, letting her see and surf
simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   As Tannenbaum talks, the picture seems increasingly like a nod
to his vision of the Internet's evolution. He predicts the Internet
will ascend to a technological level totally free of the clunky
computers and tangle of wires that bound _ and still bind _ this
waning decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still in the dark ages, we really are,'' said
Tannenbaum, senior technical staff member for IBM Corp.'s corporate
Ease-of-Use group in Austin. ``Wireless will be the key. We're
going to see computing shrink and disappear into other devices,
letting us get at the Internet through things we can't even imagine
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   His words echo the pie-in-the-sky idealism of early 1990s
Internet users, who rang in the decade enamored of the then-private
computer network and the vast, mysterious promise it held. Even so,
few expected the Internet to explode like it has.
</P>
<P>
   Global business-to-consumer sales over the Internet surged 179
percent this year, becoming a $31.2 billion industry on pace to top
$380 billion in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   And with 160 million global users and climbing, the Internet has
blossomed from a private playground into a diverse hybrid medium _
part information hotbed, part economic model _ that analysts say
will become increasingly pervasive in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   They might not don cyborg-chic headgear like the woman gracing
Tannenbaum's wall, but many of the 500 million people expected to
connect to the Internet in 2003 will do so on devices less
conventional than today's personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   Computer makers are already trading traditional, fully-loaded
beige boxes for stylish designs that encase very basic,
Internet-centric machines. Austin-based Netpliance Inc. and Pacific
Bell took it a step further this year, unveiling small portable
machines just for e-mailing and limited online shopping. Prototypes
have appeared for Internet-ready refrigerators and cars.
</P>
<P>
   Tannenbaum, who in 25 years at IBM has literally witnessed the
Internet's development, predicts the fashion industry will shrink
Web connections even further. In New York City this past October,
InfoCharm Inc. staged a fashion show where statuesque models
strutted the catwalk wearing Web connections and keyboards sewn
into shirts, pants and jackets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fashion will be a critical part of the success of Internet
devices,'' Tannenbaum said. ``Once people start wearing these tools
built into our belts and watches and shoes, then no one will want
to walk around with just the standard watch or shoe any more. The
computer industry will take that into account.'' Some claim content
will again reign supreme, at the expense of traditional media.
Other pundits espouse Tannenbaum's belief that wireless Web access
will define the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   At work, where a wall of framed patents and awards herald his
IBM career, Tannenbaum is already part of the way there.
</P>
<P>
   A small antenna turns his laptop into a wireless device, which
he totes through the hallways without severing his Internet
connection. A second laptop sits idly on his desk, its sole
function to forward important e-mails to Tannenbaum's pager when he
is away from the office.
</P>
<P>
   One spiral notebook and a thin stack of papers sit nearby, tidy
relics of an age when paper memos provided the most important link
between corporate departments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ordinary correspondence is a thing of the past,'' Tannenbaum
said. ``When we had big documents to print, everyone would worry
about how it looked on paper, but today paper itself is unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not the Internet turns the paperless office into a
worldwide reality, most analysts agree that it will continue to
spur a total shift in the way people view computing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very exciting energy,'' said Barry Parr, an analyst
withresearch company International Data Corp. ``The Internet has
become an honest-to-God mainstream thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different world even from last year, and we realize
it's just at the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   A GLOBAL KISS
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to my page! I kiss you!!'' proclaims the large black
text on the Web site of Mahir, a Turkish man whose goofy,
self-promoting page has became an Internet phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   Mahir's site is representative of a familiar Internet
occurrence: Surfers stumbled on his Web site and e-mailed their
friends. Like wildfire, word of the site swept the globe, spawning
at least 15 parodies and enticing millions _ for no particular
reason other than curiosity _ to e-mail Mahir or check out photos
of him posing by his car, sunbathing, or engrossed in ping-pong.
His site now accepts advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a modern miracle,'' Parr said. ``We've entered this age
where people become Internet celebrities not based on anything but
that they did something mildly amusing.''
</P>
<P>
   In this decade, arguably the most essential societal turning
point was the invention of the Web, an easy-to-use graphic
interface that triggered the Internet's explosion in 1995 and
propelled it into popular consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Mahir's sudden stardom also exemplifies the Internet's
extraordinary use as a forum for meeting and communicating with new
people. Today roughly 10 percent of Internet users have their own
home page, and 25 percent have at least one close friend they've
met online, Parr said.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, PC prices have plummeted, and customers can get
three-figure rebates _ sometimes free PCs _ in exchange for signing
long-term contracts with various Internet service providers. Still,
increasingly cognizant of the Internet's undying consumer appeal,
this year a host of computer companies began making machines geared
toward simplifying network access.
</P>
<P>
   In late November, Dell released its Webpc, a stripped-down
computer optimized for Internet use. That and the similar iPaq from
Compaq Computer Corp., Dell's Houston-based rival, are the latest
entries in a market evolution sparked in 1998 by Apple Computer
Corp.'s plug-and-play iMac.
</P>
<P>
   To Parr, that underscores the degree to which the Internet's
popularity will shape the computer industry. While shopping for the
right machine for his mother, Parr realized hardware is a headache
for most people _ they just want simple devices that access the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are buying computers because they want to get onto the
Net, not because they actually want computers,'' said the analyst.
``My mother doesn't want a 'technology solution,' she just wants to
e-mail and play bridge.''
</P>
<P>
   E-COMMERCE PLAYS BIG ROLE
</P>
<P>
   If you did any holiday shopping online this year, you helped
spur the fastest growing sector of the Internet economy:
e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Since last year, the number of e-commerce companies has doubled
and their revenues swelled 127 percent, according to a study by the
Center for Research in Electronic Commerce at the University of
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   This holiday season alone, e-commerce companies are expected to
take in between $6 billion and $15 billion in revenues _ a
phenomenal amount of money for a sector that barely registered two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Tannenbaum of IBM readily admits to feeding into the frenzy. An
avid collector of antique books _ his passion is Lewis Carroll _ he
traded piles of catalogs and snail-mail missives for online
auctions, chat rooms, libraries and e-mail networks. Through
browsing and buying online, Tannenbaum quickly built his collection
to 2,000 items.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world is a marketplace,'' Tannenbaum said. ``I even have a
Mastercard that's just for Internet shopping.''
</P>
<P>
   Parr said he hopes the new decade quiets the e-commerce buzz,
molding the network back into a true information medium and less of
a shopping tool.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope we stop talking about it, because there's so much more
to the Internet than that,'' Parr said. ``It's like when the
telephone comes along and all anyone can talk about is
telemarketing. Content should be king.''
</P>
<P>
   If that transformation happens, it will hinge on wireless
technology, according to both Tannenbaum and UT professor Andrew
Whinston, who heads the school's e-commerce research efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Mobile phones with built-in Internet browsers are already
becoming a bridge between the wired world and the wearable Web,
delivering information with a portable immediacy desktop computers
currently lack. As constant connectivity becomes ubiquitous,
Whinston said he expects to see more books, newspapers and
magazines published entirely online, redefining traditional
perceptions of news and information.
</P>
<P>
   It's hardly a new idea _ pundits envisioned the death of
traditional media earlier in the decade when the Web rose to
prominence. But wireless adds a critical dimension to the debate
that Whinston claims changes it from theory into inevitability.
</P>
<P>
   ``The view will be, what happened six hours ago is history,''
Whinston said. ``If you want to know what's happening right this
minute, you want information delivered to a wireless device. If
companies can't respond to that need, they'll lose ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, spending too much time predicting the Internet's future
can be futile.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the online innovations achieved in the past five
years were largely unforeseen _ and unprecedented _ when the decade
began.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years out is too far to predict,'' Tannenbaum said. ``Five
years is too far. Every year we get more advanced, but more
possibilities crop up.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 10 years, we'll probably look back and laugh.''

 &HT;    Take care: Shareware might not be Y2K-ready
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's true that most Macs are Y2K-compliant, but some
may still experience problems with the coming of the new year.
</P>
<P>
   The problem isn't with the Mac per se but with the software that
runs on it. Specifically, all that shareware you've been
downloading through the years.
</P>
<P>
   Think about it. Much of this stuff has been discontinued or not
upgraded for months, if not years. It's this type of unsupported
software that could trip up many a Mac user.
</P>
<P>
   A suggestion: Clean out any shareware program, be it a solitaire
game or battle tanks, that you're not absolutely sure has been
upgraded for Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   You can always download another version after the new year when
programmers will be re-releasing rewritten software.
</P>
<P>
   A bit extreme? Perhaps. But in this case it's better to be safe
than sorry.
</P>
<P>
   Another potential problem is using files originally formatted in
PC applications. These files can't take advantage of Macs' built-in
Y2K savvy. No one knows exactly what these files might do to your
Mac, but it sure won't be pretty.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just PC files that could mess with your Mac's brain.
There are plenty of shareware and custom scripts written for big
programs such as Word, Excel and FileMaker that very well might not
be designed to handle 2000.
</P>
<P>
   If you depend on any such scripts or shareware, be sure to
double-check them to make sure they're Y2K-compliant.
Unfortunately, that's no easy task _ especially if you receive this
stuff from a friend of a friend.
</P>
<P>
   The message here is not to panic but to be alert. Seek out
patches online for your favorite shareware and scripts. If you can
afford to, dump the stuff you can't upgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that the Mac itself can process dates after the
beginning of the New Year. How far ahead they can read future dates
varies, though, depending on what operating system your Mac is
running.
</P>
<P>
   The operating system is the software that comes inside your Mac,
controlling everything from the way the screen looks to how
software runs. The original Mac systems can read dates through Feb.
6, 2040. The newer systems can read dates through 29940.
</P>
<P>
   Apple has been trumpeting the Y2K compliance of its machines
since the Super Bowl, when it ran ads pointing out this fact.
</P>
<P>
   The company has also assembled online a formidable database
about what machines and components it has tested to date. You'll
find this site at www.apple.com
</P>
<P>
   /about/year2000.

 &HT;    Companies' core values ring true
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Time magazine calls it dotcommunism.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Amazon.com's Jeff Bezos and MindSpring's Charles
Brewer, prefer to call it ``core values and beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a set of principles that guide the direction of a company.
Other online companies have similar core values _ or at least they
say they do. It's trendy in the dot-com business to say your
company has core values written down somewhere. At the turn of the
last century, many millionaires of the industrial age had just one
guiding principle: Make as much money as possible, as quickly as
possible. But the online world is a kinder, gentler place, if you
believe everything you read.
</P>
<P>
   Out at Amazon's Coffeyville, Kan., distribution center, Time
reports that huge banners hang from the ceiling with phrases like
``Our vision is the world's most customer-centric company.''
Another banner is devoted to the company's six core values:
Customer obsession, ownership, bias for action, frugality, high
hiring bar and innovation.
</P>
<P>
   WINNING FORMULA
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile in Atlanta, Internet service provider MindSpring has
been winning over subscribers and employees with its 10 core values
and beliefs, or the ``cv&AMP;b's'' as they are known to staffers.
</P>
<P>
   They also decorate the walls and even the business cards of
MindSpring employees. At the last MindSpring shareholders meeting,
each of the company's executives took turns reading the core values
out loud.
</P>
<P>
   EarthLink, the Internet service provider that will merge with
MindSpring early next year, has its own list of values and beliefs.
Even the kids working on that Internet start-up venture in the
garage down the street from your house probably try to work the
phrase ``core values'' into a sentence when describing their Web
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   This idea of putting the customer first, honoring commitments
and thinking of ways to make your customers happy is kind of sweet.
</P>
<P>
   In the boom economy of the '90s, the notion of core values seems
kind of quaint _ like something out of a Frank Capra movie from the
1930s. Imagine Jimmy Stewart as the head of an online business
lecturing his handful of loyal staffers and his director of
marketing (Donna Reed or Maureen O'Hara, perhaps) on the importance
of promptly answering every e-mail and keeping every customer
happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gosh darn it!'' Stewart would have yelled at his
earnest-looking group of Web designers, coders and programmers.
``If we don't put the customer first, we'll never be able to take
this company public! Now everybody go have some more free lattes
and get back to work!''
</P>
<P>
   The thing with the dot-com companies and their core values is
that they mean what they say. Even the most hard-boiled Wall Street
analyst will tell you these companies aren't kidding when they tell
CNBC or Time the customer is always right.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the idea of following the Golden Rule is a throwback to
the days when these companies didn't have a hope or a share of
stock in the world. When Brewer began MindSpring in 1993, he said
he wanted to start the kind of company he'd want to work for and
drew up the original core values that are now part of MindSpring's
legend.
</P>
<P>
   But when you hit the big time, with its initial public
offerings, sky-high stock prices, and offices, call centers and
distribution centers all over the country, it's harder to have
thousands of employees who are all fervent believers in one set of
principles. And cynics will say having a guiding set of principles
is just a gimmick and, at the very worst, a cheap way to motivate
employees into believing their hard work is for the greater good,
not simply to line the pockets of the founder and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com was a crazy scheme Bezos cooked up with just a 30
percent chance of making it big. Brewer had no idea he'd be the
chairman of the nation's second-largest ISP. Maybe they just
decided if they were going to go for broke, they might as well do
it with a little class.

 &HT;    RocketChips blasts speeds to megabits
 &HT;    By Kirk Ladendorf
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ You've got to like the name: RocketChips Inc. is
way cool.
</P>
<P>
   But the name isn't why Moises Robinson wanted to work for the
tiny chip startup based in Minneapolis. He liked the vision and the
high-growth markets the company was attacking, along with the
chance to get in with a promising company before a public stock
offering.
</P>
<P>
   So Robinson, a 31-year-old native of Panama and an engineering
graduate of Texas A&AMP;M University, left a job with Oak Technology in
Austin in 1998 to start the Austin office of RocketChips.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a year and a half later, the Austin design office has
15 employees and is nearing completion of its first chip _ a
communications chip based on a high-speed connection technology,
called FireWire, that joins computers and other products such as
digital camcorders.
</P>
<P>
   RocketChips brags that it designs the hard stuff _
communications chips that employ mixed-signal designs, with both
digital and analog circuits on the same chip.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are doing some of the difficult things'' in communications
chip design, Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Added company Chief Executive Ray Johnson, ``The drug of choice
today is bandwidth, and we are one of the pushers.''
</P>
<P>
   The chip was designed for Faraday Technology Corp. of Taiwan,
which wants to break into the emerging FireWire connectivity
market, but RocketChips can sell the chip _ or part of it _ to
other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Privately held RocketChips guards its financial information
closely. It has raised $15 million in venture capital and it has
received licensing revenues from other electronics companies. Its
first three designs are still several months away from going into
volume production.
</P>
<P>
   FireWire looks like a good market to play in. The high-speed
connectivity technology was invented by Apple Computer Inc. and
became a public standard in 1995. Research firm Cahners In-Stat
Group predicts the market is about to explode, from shipments of
about 10 million units in 1999 to nearly 200 million units
(including computers, video camcorders and printers) in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The current version of FireWire is very quick _ it can move data
at speeds ranging from 100 megabits per second to 400 megabits per
second. And there is an even faster version of the technology is in
the works.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a high-bandwidth application, particularly if you
have audio and video content, then FireWire is a very elegant
solution,'' said Mark Kirstein, vice president of research at
Cahners In-Stat.
</P>
<P>
   FireWire is fast and it is also ``peer-to-peer.'' That means
that a digital video camcorder with a FireWire connection can
communicate directly with a printer with the same connection
without going through a computer.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of startup companies are working on FireWire-related
chips, Kirstein said, but RocketChips is the only one that has
taken on the analog part of the solution.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson's next challenge is to double the size of the Austin
design center in the next year so the company can turn out more
designs. RocketChips also has design centers in Minneapolis and in
Ames, Iowa, where it has a close relationship with Iowa State
University. The design teams are connected by high-speed telephone
lines so engineers can ship complex computer files back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   Mixed-signal design capabilities are going to be crucial for
high-speed communications chips, Robinson said, so his company
already is attracting the interest of other chip companies that
want to partner with it new chip designs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of people rooting for us in the industry,''
Robinson said. ``I think we have something big going on here.''

 &HT;    Yahoo's magazine rings in '00 by picking best of Web
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Given the approaching end of the year and century,
it's time for ``best of'' lists. Yahoo Internet Life features in
its January issue a ``Top of the Net'' list of the 100 best Web
sites for 2000. There are also several stories that look back on
the year online and forward to the coming year, as well as
examining the most popular sites now and for the future. You'll
find few surprises in what's been popular among sites. Topping the
list of Internet sites this past year was, for example, the one
promoting the film ``Star Wars: Episode I.''
</P>
<P>
   ON CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   The holiday season brings the release of computer CD games
ranging from classic to modern. In the classic category is the
latest version of mah-jongg, published by Activision as ``Shanghai:
Second Dynasty.'' This version includes a vast assortment of
mah-jongg games. You can play against the clock or against
opponents. ``Second Dynasty'' is available for both Macs and PCs.
</P>
<P>
   For those with modern tastes, Activision has also released the
latest version of ``Quake,'' called ``Quake III.'' This is a very
violent game, so parents and those who find this genre offensive
beware. What's new is the number of warriors players can choose
from and the graphics. Everything now, of course, is 3-D. ``Quake
III'' is available only for PCs with Windows 95 or higher.
</P>
<P>
   ONLINE
</P>
<P>
   Now for something completely different. If you're sick of all
the celebrity hype, check out a site called Quirked. The site
features pictures of celebrities distorted through Kai's Power Goo.
You'll find, for example, Al Gore twisted into the Joker. Another
favorite is Leonardo DiCaprio converted into a Spock look-alike. Or
how about John Travolta with a head like Jabba the Hut? You get the
idea. You'll find Quirked at www.quirked.com.

 &HT;    News of the century, presented day-by-day
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As we stand here in the dawn of the millennium _ yes,
yes, I know it doesn't start until 2001, but let's go with the
flow, shall we? _ let us pause to look back at where we've been.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because we've been there, and we know, more or less, what
happened while we were there. Heaven knows where we're going; I
certainly don't, and if you do, no one will believe you anyway
unless you can say it on television.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, it's the sort of thing one does at mileposts like this.
</P>
<P>
   And, all foolery aside, history is something that seems to be
escaping us.
</P>
<P>
   Few things recently have appalled me more than the remark of a
young woman to her child at the 8th Air Force Museum in Savannah
while my wife and I were visiting it. Her awareness of what they
were seeing was evidently only dimly illuminated by the signs that
mentioned World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, see, honey,'' she cooed to the child, ``this is all about
World War Eleven.''
</P>
<P>
   We have a CD-ROM from DK Interactive Learning called 20th
Century Day by Day to make things a little clearer.
</P>
<P>
   The disc does live up to its name _ there's something, however
paltry, for every day of the century, so you can go back and find
out what the big news was on any milestone in your personal
history. The day I was born is an excellent example of the fact
that some problems never go away _ there was unrest in Palestine.
</P>
<P>
   The disc may suffer somewhat from overproduction; there are a
bewildering number of ways to get into it. The user is initially
presented with a cheesy ``newsroom'' that actually more closely
resembles a one-man bookie joint. It is littered with stuff that
will turn the cursor into a pointing hand and take you somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of other ways to jump in, however, and just
about any way can lead to fascinating information. Continuing
stories are threaded together so you can leap ahead to discover the
next development.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, if you come across Nov. 26, 1922, you will find
the stunning news of the discovery of King Tutankhamen's tomb.
</P>
<P>
   You can jump to the following day, when some of the discovered
treasures were described, to a brief mention on Jan. 4, 1923, of
the discovery of the king's sarcophagus within the fifth shrine,
thence to a cryptic Jan. 25 note that says ``examination of the
clothes on a mummy shows that Egyptian fashions have not changed in
2,642 years.''
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 25, there were ``gasps of wonderment'' as the gold
sarcophagus was uncovered. A final brief more than a year later
reveals that examination of the mummy itself indicates the king was
no more than 15 years old when he died.
</P>
<P>
   A word search reveals significant flaws in the disc's threading,
which failed to include other entries up through 1925, including
those in March and April 1925 about the illness and subsequent
death of Lord Carnarvon, sponsor of the expedition.
</P>
<P>
   That, however, is nit-picking, and is just another example that
if you are searching for something specific, hunt for it in every
way possible. Never assume that one line of inquiry has provided
all the information available.
</P>
<P>
   The disc has innumerable photos, 90 archival film clips and 70
video clips. For the celebrity conscious, which seems to include
most of today's younger people, there are 100 biographies.

 &HT;    The latest in games
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service AUSTIN, Texas _
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOR THE CONSOLE
</P>
<P>
   Voodoo, cursing and violence, oh my! Yes, Acclaim's Shadow Man
(Playstation $40, Nintendo64 $55 and Dreamcast $50, www.acclaim.
com) has it all. In this game, you play a character who uses voodoo
to travel between our bright and shiny world and a netherworld
world chock-full of moaning souls. In both worlds, the idea is to
kill as many people as possible in order to stop the erection of an
evil tower. This game is absolutely spooky and can almost be deemed
an interactive psychological thriller. While the story borders on
the ridiculous and the dialogue is somewhat smarmy, it's pretty
compelling for a video game and even gave me the creeps a couple of
times.
</P>
<P>
   Nintendo's Donkey Kong 64 ($65, www.nintendo.com) is finally out
and is the perfect accoutrement to your N64. While this game does
require the expansion pack, it's worth it. The big ape is back and
he's brought all his friends on his most graphically rich adventure
to date. In DK64, you battle the formidable K. Rool (and his
Kremlings), who has ape-napped all the Kongs and the banana hoard.
How cruel! You must use the abilities of all five of the Kongs to
defeat your nemesis and win back those yellow, potassium-filled
delights. The play is fast, fun and will provide you plenty of
reasons to love your local primate. Hint: When offered, be sure to
buy the coconut shooter.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a trivia game for the Dreamcast. Acclaim's Chef's Luv
Shack ($50, for the Dreamcast, www.acclaim.com) is based on
everyone's favorite culinary hero from ``South Park,'' Chef. The
game is as short on graphics as the television show, but who cares?
The Chef is there, as are Kenny, Eric and the rest of the gang, and
that's all that matters. In the vein of ``You Don't Know Jack!,''
you get answer questions like: Hebron, Nebraska boasts the world's
biggest what? A) Porch swing B) Rocking chair C) Weight loss clinic
or D) toilet seat (answer: B). You also get to play some pretty
hilarious mini-games for points, including: Bees at a Picnic (a
Space Invaders game played with pesticide and bees) and Eat This (a
pie-eating game).
</P>
<P>
   Get a stew pot. Throw in Demolition Racer, Destruction Derby II,
Twisted Metal and add a dash of Interstate 76, and you get a
wonderful concoction called Activision's Vigilante 8: Second
Offense ($50, www.activision. com). For all of you who remember the
first Vigilante 8: This one's better. For all of you who don't:
This is an auto combat game to end all auto combat games. You
choose from one of 18 cars and eight totally destructible arenas to
fight in. The ultimate goal is to blow up as much stuff and cars as
possible. The more you blow up, the more points you earn. And the
more points you earn, the more you can upgrade your cars. In the
end, this enables you build a jet propulsion car that will take you
anywhere.

<P>
   FOR THE DESKTOP
</P>
<P>
   Here's what to like about Unreal: Tournament. ($50 for PC and
Mac, www.
</P>
<P>
   unrealtournament.com) The beautiful, mesmerizing backgrounds and
environments, the heftier, beefy weapons upgraded since the first
game, great multiplayer options and smooth online gameplay,
gorgeously rendered characters, innovative level design, a
fantastic low-gravity cityscape level that will make you feel like
you're in ``The Matrix.'' So what's not to like about Unreal:
Tournament? If you like first-person shooters, get this game now.
Asheron's Call, Microsoft's new massive multiplayer role-playing
game (for PC, $50 plus $10 monthly after a trial period, www.
turbinegames.com/asherons-call/), trumps the standard set by the
home team, Austin's Origin Systems, whose Ultima Online pioneered
the genre. Asheron's big breakthrough is with the alliance system,
which creates a pyramidal social structureencouraging old hands to
actively assist newbies. Swear allegiance and your new patron will
invariably hand you some fabulous sword or coat of armor _ put it
on and model it immediately _ or just cold cash. What a contrast to
the Hobbesian dog-eat-dog world that makes Ultima so intimidating
to newcomers. Asheron's Call, played first- or third-person,
innovates in other ways, with its portal system, a
made-from-scratch menagerie of monsters and a monthly worldwide
event that pushes the story forward. It's not all good: Drawbacks
include a frustrating array of problems logging on, billing snafus,
the usual lag issues and a world that looks a tad cheesy. The
bottom line is that Asheron's addictive quality and innovative
social system make it a must-play for role-playing fans. Hint: Get
yourself a mule. (www.turbinegames.com/asherons-call/)

   AUSTIN, Texas _ Oh boy! The red, strobing Taxi Wand is back! But
this time, it's been outfitted in silver, plays ``Auld Lang Syne''
and comes with a stylin' silver lanyard with ``01012000'' printed
on it. It also changed its name. This incarnation of the Taxi Wand
is remonikered the Millennium Wand 2000 ($8, www.wandworld.com) and
it is sure to help bring in the New Year, the New Century and the
New Millennium with a bang. Just press the button and the red light
flashes and you hear everyone's favorite end-of-the-year song. It's
like having an instant New Year's party in your hand. I guess the
only question left to ask is if it's Y2K compliant.

The Web site the commercials are promoting is based on this simple
concept: group buying power. When you sign up as a power buyer, you
can bid on items such as DVD players and TVs, then watch as the
prices continue to go down as more people sign on. The downside: If
you want to buy something that's not too popular, it can be awfully
lonely without your group buying friends.

 &HT;    As millennium ends, people mark past and future by technology
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In the year 999, the world waited for the New
Millennium with excitement and fear.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists of the day _ astrologers, monks, witches and prophets
_ watched the skies for portents of disaster. The most jaded of
them wondered whether all the great discoveries were in the past.
</P>
<P>
   If it could be done, they reasoned, it had already been done.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it was easy enough to tick off the truly important
technological discoveries _ and all were far in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenicians had made communications easier, developing a
22-letter alphabet so many years before that the exact date was
already blurred with time; wheeled vehicles for transport were in
use even before that; the idea of the number ``0'' had come out of
India in 876 B.C., making true mathematics possible; and the
Chinese were using a new way to communicate and store data: writing
paper.
</P>
<P>
   Life was already technologically sophisticated.
</P>
<P>
   The first portable digital computer had been invented and in use
for centuries by 999.
</P>
<P>
   It was the abacus, a remarkable calculating device, easy to
carry and with no battery-life problems. The abacus represented
such a sturdy and useful technology that it was still being used in
parts of China in 1982 to take the census.
</P>
<P>
   Along with such wonders of technology, there were dangers, too.
</P>
<P>
   The fearful of 999 worried that man was tampering with the
forces of nature, imposing his ego on powers too complex to be
understood, too dangerous to be harnessed.
</P>
<P>
   Nor were those fears without justification. After all, the
Chinese _ somewhere around 868 A.D. _ invented gunpowder, opening
the door to a technology that took an ordinary substance and seemed
to give it magical powers for destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Take a bit of sulfur, some charcoal and potassium nitrate, mix
well, and you have a grayish black powder that looks as harmless as
a handful of dirt but holds within it the power to move mountains.
</P>
<P>
   The thinkers and philosophers of the day wondered and fidgeted
and questioned whether man was smart enough to be trusted with such
substances.
</P>
<P>
   There was much to fear in 999 and seemingly little left to
invent.
</P>
<P>
   As you read this in the waning days of 1999, not much has
changed.
</P>
<P>
   The miracle technologies of space travel, computers, atomic
energy, the telephone system and the Internet are firmly in the
past. Looking ahead, it seems that all that remains for
technologists is the mundane task of perfecting what already
exists.
</P>
<P>
   There are other similarities with 999. There are those among us
waiting for disaster with the eagerness of auto racing fans
watching for a wreck. Most immediately it is the Y2K computer
glitch that raises these fears. Books have been written and movies
have been made, painting a frightening picture of the devastation
some believe it will bring.
</P>
<P>
   But Y2K aside, there are more fundamental fears. Some wonder _
with credibility _ that man, in the name of science and technology,
has bred the seeds of his own destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Pick your poison, the fearful say.
</P>
<P>
   Will it be atomic energy and one grand blast that closes the
door on civilization?
</P>
<P>
   Or will we all go with a sneeze and a feverish quiver because of
human tampering with viruses and genes?
</P>
<P>
   Those watching the skies for signs in the year 999 would have
understood those fears.
</P>
<P>
   At least part of the reason for our Mr. Magoo vision of
technology _ foggy and shortsighted _ is frailty and ego. Each
person's life span is short, yet history is long. We view the world
as a moon that orbits around our own lives. The things that fall
within our orbit become bright and important, and those outside the
orbit are as dim as distant stars.
</P>
<P>
   That's why, if you ask someone today about the great
technological innovations of history, you'll likely hear about
computers, or the Internet or even something as historically
mundane as computer graphics.
</P>
<P>
   The discoveries of the Pythagorean theorem and multiplication
tables are quite literally ancient history, while the 600-megahertz
microprocessor is a modern miracle.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, when you think beyond a single lifetime and consider
technology, it helps to find some common ground, to define and
agree on some boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   Little or nothing is ``invented'' ... instead it is discovered.
</P>
<P>
   Almost without exception, technology comes from the world and
nature.
</P>
<P>
   Electricity was scorching through the skies in the days when a
burning torch was the latest in innovation. Atomic energy was hard
at work before man had the ability to utter his first words.
</P>
<P>
   It was all there. It was just a matter of finding it.
</P>
<P>
   Even the physical structure of a microprocessor _ the chip that
provides the real calculating engine for the computer _ is no more
than silicon (melt down some sand that has existed since the dawn
of time and there you have it) that has been treated with some
elements (boron, phosphorus or arsenic) that are bountiful in
nature. Adding these elements to the silicon _ called ``doping''
the chip _ alters its electrical properties in a useful way. But
the properties were not created by man. Instead, we learned that
they exist.
</P>
<P>
   It has all been there _ the laws of physics, the rules that
govern how electricity flows, the raw materials _ waiting for man
to get smart enough to find them.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what technology you name _ from atomic power to the
seeming miracle of a light that shines based on an invisible force
traveling miles through copper wire _ it's simply man using a force
that was already there.
</P>
<P>
   The inventor is nature. Man is the discoverer.
</P>
<P>
   But if man is little more than a scavenger, searching the world
for bits and pieces that he can use, he has been a resourceful and
ingenious one.
</P>
<P>
   Each new-found technological discovery leads to the next, like
the pieces of a giant jigsaw puzzle that slowly form a beautiful
picture as they are put together. Signal flags and smoke signals
created the working knowledge of communicating in code, which
opened the door for the telegraph, which taught the lessons of
communicating over a network, which made it possible to build the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The most frightening part of technology may not be its potential
for destruction, but its potential for change.
</P>
<P>
   Just as we get used to the idea of horse-drawn carriages, the
automobile comes along _ and everything you once knew is suddenly
wrong. Once man grasped the idea of sailing ships, the steam engine
made them too slow for useful work.
</P>
<P>
   There's a practical loss _ skills and careers built on one
technology become useless almost overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Each new technology seems to kill off an old one, even
technologies that appeared too powerful and important to die.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for instance, the first truly digital method of
communicating ... the telegraph and Morse code.
</P>
<P>
   It was a network that erased time and distance. Messages that
took days and even weeks or months to deliver by messenger, train
and boat moved almost at the speed of light over the telegraph
lines. One of the marvels of technology was the laying of great
undersea cables that let messages move by telegraph from Europe to
America. Surely it would last forever.
</P>
<P>
   Or so people thought.
</P>
<P>
   But wireless communications and the wired telephone turned the
telegram into a relic, an antique that now seems quaint and
cumbersome.
</P>
<P>
   New technologies force out the old.
</P>
<P>
   And not all the losses are practical. Some of the losses _
perhaps the most important losses _ are deeper and more
fundamental.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most enduring of all man's traits has been
storytelling. In the earliest days, stories, poems and songs were
passed down orally from generation to generation. But as the
printed word became more important, man's memory faded. Few people
memorize stories anymore; family histories are passed down on
videotape and computer disk, not in stories by the fire.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, music stores sold sheet music and many families
spent the evening gathered around the piano, singing together.
While singing and storytelling haven't died, they've more and more
become the work of professionals and less a part of ordinary life.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, there are books, movies, CDs and television. It would
be difficult to argue that the new technologies are bad. It would
be equally impossible to say that what we lost had no value. We
don't sing as a family as much anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Before you judge all this and decide whether you think it's good
or bad, keep in mind that technology doesn't care what you think.
</P>
<P>
   Since technology has such power over our lives, our jobs and
even over the future of the human race, it is tempting to give it a
human face _ to label some technologies as evil, others as good.
</P>
<P>
   No matter which technology you discuss _ the Internet, atomic
energy, missiles and satellites, commercial television or cellular
phones _ you'll have no trouble finding opposing opinions.
</P>
<P>
   Technology doesn't have a soul. Your television set is no more
good or evil than atomic energy. Each technology has the potential
to be anything man assigns to it because technology is no more or
less than a tool.
</P>
<P>
   And anyone who has used a hammer can tell you that a tool can be
used to do good or to bring pain and destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The only firm rule _ when it comes to predicting the future of
technology _ is that the experts are usually wrong. Just a few
decades ago, there were predictions that you'd commute to work in a
car with fold-down wings, that there would be a colony on the moon,
that almost all electricity would come from atomic and wind power.
</P>
<P>
   All these things are technologically possible, but proved
impractical, socially unacceptable or just plain not wanted by the
consumer.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best way to look at the future of technology is to
study the past.
</P>
<P>
   So today, as you look at what other readers have to say about
the most important technologies of the recent past, you may find
common threads that show what the real experts, people like you _
those who use technology every day _ think.

<TEXT>
<P>
   FOR THE CONSOLE
</P>
<P>
   Voodoo, cursing and violence, oh my! Yes, Acclaim's Shadow Man
(Playstation $40, Nintendo64 $55 and Dreamcast $50, www.acclaim.
com) has it all. In this game, you play a character who uses voodoo
to travel between our bright and shiny world and a netherworld
world chock-full of moaning souls. In both worlds, the idea is to
kill as many people as possible in order to stop the erection of an
evil tower. This game is absolutely spooky and can almost be deemed
an interactive psychological thriller. While the story borders on
the ridiculous and the dialogue is somewhat smarmy, it's pretty
compelling for a video game and even gave me the creeps a couple of
times.
</P>
<P>
   Nintendo's Donkey Kong 64 ($65, www.nintendo.com) is finally out
and is the perfect accoutrement to your N64. While this game does
require the expansion pack, it's worth it. The big ape is back and
he's brought all his friends on his most graphically rich adventure
to date. In DK64, you battle the formidable K. Rool (and his
Kremlings), who has ape-napped all the Kongs and the banana hoard.
How cruel! You must use the abilities of all five of the Kongs to
defeat your nemesis and win back those yellow, potassium-filled
delights. The play is fast, fun and will provide you plenty of
reasons to love your local primate. Hint: When offered, be sure to
buy the coconut shooter.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a trivia game for the Dreamcast. Acclaim's Chef's Luv
Shack ($50, for the Dreamcast, www.acclaim.com) is based on
everyone's favorite culinary hero from ``South Park,'' Chef. The
game is as short on graphics as the television show, but who cares?
The Chef is there, as are Kenny, Eric and the rest of the gang, and
that's all that matters. In the vein of ``You Don't Know Jack!,''
you get answer questions like: Hebron, Nebraska boasts the world's
biggest what? A) Porch swing B) Rocking chair C) Weight loss clinic
or D) toilet seat (answer: B). You also get to play some pretty
hilarious mini-games for points, including: Bees at a Picnic (a
Space Invaders game played with pesticide and bees) and Eat This (a
pie-eating game).
</P>
<P>
   Get a stew pot. Throw in Demolition Racer, Destruction Derby II,
Twisted Metal and add a dash of Interstate 76, and you get a
wonderful concoction called Activision's Vigilante 8: Second
Offense ($50, www.activision. com). For all of you who remember the
first Vigilante 8: This one's better. For all of you who don't:
This is an auto combat game to end all auto combat games. You
choose from one of 18 cars and eight totally destructible arenas to
fight in. The ultimate goal is to blow up as much stuff and cars as
possible. The more you blow up, the more points you earn. And the
more points you earn, the more you can upgrade your cars. In the
end, this enables you build a jet propulsion car that will take you

</P>
<P>
   FOR THE DESKTOP
</P>
<P>
   Here's what to like about Unreal: Tournament. ($50 for PC and
Mac, www.
</P>
<P>
   unrealtournament.com) The beautiful, mesmerizing backgrounds and
environments, the heftier, beefy weapons upgraded since the first
game, great multiplayer options and smooth online gameplay,
gorgeously rendered characters, innovative level design, a
fantastic low-gravity cityscape level that will make you feel like
you're in ``The Matrix.'' So what's not to like about Unreal:
Tournament? If you like first-person shooters, get this game now.
Asheron's Call, Microsoft's new massive multiplayer role-playing
game (for PC, $50 plus $10 monthly after a trial period, www.
turbinegames.com/asherons-call/), trumps the standard set by the

 &HT;    Wand-ers never cease
 &HT;    By Gregory Kallenberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Oh boy! The red, strobing Taxi Wand is back! But
this time, it's been outfitted in silver, plays ``Auld Lang Syne''
and comes with a stylin' silver lanyard with ``01012000'' printed
on it. It also changed its name. This incarnation of the Taxi Wand
is remonikered the Millennium Wand 2000 ($8, www.wandworld.com) and
it is sure to help bring in the New Year, the New Century and the
New Millennium with a bang. Just press the button and the red light
flashes and you hear everyone's favorite end-of-the-year song. It's
like having an instant New Year's party in your hand. I guess the
only question left to ask is if it's Y2K compliant.

 &HT;    News of the century, presented day-by-day
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As we stand here in the dawn of the millennium _ yes,
yes, I know it doesn't start until 2001, but let's go with the
flow, shall we? _ let us pause to look back at where we've been.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because we've been there, and we know, more or less, what
happened while we were there. Heaven knows where we're going; I
certainly don't, and if you do, no one will believe you anyway
unless you can say it on television.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, it's the sort of thing one does at mileposts like this.
</P>
<P>
   And, all foolery aside, history is something that seems to be
escaping us.
</P>
<P>
   Few things recently have appalled me more than the remark of a
young woman to her child at the 8th Air Force Museum in Savannah
while my wife and I were visiting it. Her awareness of what they
were seeing was evidently only dimly illuminated by the signs that
mentioned World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, see, honey,'' she cooed to the child, ``this is all about
World War Eleven.''
</P>
<P>
   We have a CD-ROM from DK Interactive Learning called 20th
Century Day by Day to make things a little clearer.
</P>
<P>
   The disc does live up to its name _ there's something, however
paltry, for every day of the century, so you can go back and find
out what the big news was on any milestone in your personal
history. The day I was born is an excellent example of the fact
that some problems never go away _ there was unrest in Palestine.
</P>
<P>
   The disc may suffer somewhat from overproduction; there are a
bewildering number of ways to get into it. The user is initially
presented with a cheesy ``newsroom'' that actually more closely
resembles a one-man bookie joint. It is littered with stuff that
will turn the cursor into a pointing hand and take you somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of other ways to jump in, however, and just
about any way can lead to fascinating information. Continuing
stories are threaded together so you can leap ahead to discover the
next development.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, if you come across Nov. 26, 1922, you will find
the stunning news of the discovery of King Tutankhamen's tomb.
</P>
<P>
   You can jump to the following day, when some of the discovered
treasures were described, to a brief mention on Jan. 4, 1923, of
the discovery of the king's sarcophagus within the fifth shrine,
thence to a cryptic Jan. 25 note that says ``examination of the
clothes on a mummy shows that Egyptian fashions have not changed in
2,642 years.''
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 25, there were ``gasps of wonderment'' as the gold
sarcophagus was uncovered. A final brief more than a year later
reveals that examination of the mummy itself indicates the king was
no more than 15 years old when he died.
</P>
<P>
   A word search reveals significant flaws in the disc's threading,
which failed to include other entries up through 1925, including
those in March and April 1925 about the illness and subsequent
death of Lord Carnarvon, sponsor of the expedition.
</P>
<P>
   That, however, is nit-picking, and is just another example that
if you are searching for something specific, hunt for it in every
way possible. Never assume that one line of inquiry has provided
all the information available.
</P>
<P>
   The disc has innumerable photos, 90 archival film clips and 70
video clips. For the celebrity conscious, which seems to include
most of today's younger people, there are 100 biographies.

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _spun.com _ Waterloo Records might still be the
best place to buy, sell and trade CDs, but if you want to do it
online, spun.com is a good place to start. By entering CDs you want
to unload, you can use the online credit to go shopping for other
new and used CDs. Spun will send you your goods and ship you a
returnable box to complete the exchange. The site assures customers
that used CDs are quality-inspected.
</P>
<P>
   MUST BUY: A used copy of Lucinda Williams' ``Car Wheels on a
Gravel Road'' for $7.99 plus shipping.
</P>
<P>
   mercata.com _ If you've seen mercata.com's TV commercials, you
probably remember them well: couples together and in bed obsess
suggestively about an unspecified object that ``keeps going down.''
The Web site the commercials are promoting is based on this simple
concept: group buying power. When you sign up as a power buyer, you
can bid on items such as DVD players and TVs, then watch as the
prices continue to go down as more people sign on. The downside: If
you want to buy something that's not too popular, it can be awfully
lonely without your group buying friends.
</P>
<P>
   MUST BUY: We don't know _ we're still seeing how far the prices
fall on a new DVD player.

 &HT;    As millennium ends, people mark past and future by technology
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In the year 999, the world waited for the New
Millennium with excitement and fear.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists of the day _ astrologers, monks, witches and prophets
_ watched the skies for portents of disaster. The most jaded of
them wondered whether all the great discoveries were in the past.
</P>
<P>
   If it could be done, they reasoned, it had already been done.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it was easy enough to tick off the truly important
technological discoveries _ and all were far in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenicians had made communications easier, developing a
22-letter alphabet so many years before that the exact date was
already blurred with time; wheeled vehicles for transport were in
use even before that; the idea of the number ``0'' had come out of
India in 876 B.C., making true mathematics possible; and the
Chinese were using a new way to communicate and store data: writing
paper.
</P>
<P>
   Life was already technologically sophisticated.
</P>
<P>
   The first portable digital computer had been invented and in use
for centuries by 999.
</P>
<P>
   It was the abacus, a remarkable calculating device, easy to
carry and with no battery-life problems. The abacus represented
such a sturdy and useful technology that it was still being used in
parts of China in 1982 to take the census.
</P>
<P>
   Along with such wonders of technology, there were dangers, too.
</P>
<P>
   The fearful of 999 worried that man was tampering with the
forces of nature, imposing his ego on powers too complex to be
understood, too dangerous to be harnessed.
</P>
<P>
   Nor were those fears without justification. After all, the
Chinese _ somewhere around 868 A.D. _ invented gunpowder, opening
the door to a technology that took an ordinary substance and seemed
to give it magical powers for destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Take a bit of sulfur, some charcoal and potassium nitrate, mix
well, and you have a grayish black powder that looks as harmless as
a handful of dirt but holds within it the power to move mountains.
</P>
<P>
   The thinkers and philosophers of the day wondered and fidgeted
and questioned whether man was smart enough to be trusted with such
substances.
</P>
<P>
   There was much to fear in 999 and seemingly little left to
invent.
</P>
<P>
   As you read this in the waning days of 1999, not much has
changed.
</P>
<P>
   The miracle technologies of space travel, computers, atomic
energy, the telephone system and the Internet are firmly in the
past. Looking ahead, it seems that all that remains for
technologists is the mundane task of perfecting what already
exists.
</P>
<P>
   There are other similarities with 999. There are those among us
waiting for disaster with the eagerness of auto racing fans
watching for a wreck. Most immediately it is the Y2K computer
glitch that raises these fears. Books have been written and movies
have been made, painting a frightening picture of the devastation
some believe it will bring.
</P>
<P>
   But Y2K aside, there are more fundamental fears. Some wonder _
with credibility _ that man, in the name of science and technology,
has bred the seeds of his own destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Pick your poison, the fearful say.
</P>
<P>
   Will it be atomic energy and one grand blast that closes the
door on civilization?
</P>
<P>
   Or will we all go with a sneeze and a feverish quiver because of
human tampering with viruses and genes?
</P>
<P>
   Those watching the skies for signs in the year 999 would have
understood those fears.
</P>
<P>
   At least part of the reason for our Mr. Magoo vision of
technology _ foggy and shortsighted _ is frailty and ego. Each
person's life span is short, yet history is long. We view the world
as a moon that orbits around our own lives. The things that fall
within our orbit become bright and important, and those outside the
orbit are as dim as distant stars.
</P>
<P>
   That's why, if you ask someone today about the great
technological innovations of history, you'll likely hear about
computers, or the Internet or even something as historically
mundane as computer graphics.
</P>
<P>
   The discoveries of the Pythagorean theorem and multiplication
tables are quite literally ancient history, while the 600-megahertz
microprocessor is a modern miracle.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, when you think beyond a single lifetime and consider
technology, it helps to find some common ground, to define and
agree on some boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   Little or nothing is ``invented'' ... instead it is discovered.
</P>
<P>
   Almost without exception, technology comes from the world and
nature.
</P>
<P>
   Electricity was scorching through the skies in the days when a
burning torch was the latest in innovation. Atomic energy was hard
at work before man had the ability to utter his first words.
</P>
<P>
   It was all there. It was just a matter of finding it.
</P>
<P>
   Even the physical structure of a microprocessor _ the chip that
provides the real calculating engine for the computer _ is no more
than silicon (melt down some sand that has existed since the dawn
of time and there you have it) that has been treated with some
elements (boron, phosphorus or arsenic) that are bountiful in
nature. Adding these elements to the silicon _ called ``doping''
the chip _ alters its electrical properties in a useful way. But
the properties were not created by man. Instead, we learned that
they exist.
</P>
<P>
   It has all been there _ the laws of physics, the rules that
govern how electricity flows, the raw materials _ waiting for man
to get smart enough to find them.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what technology you name _ from atomic power to the
seeming miracle of a light that shines based on an invisible force
traveling miles through copper wire _ it's simply man using a force
that was already there.
</P>
<P>
   The inventor is nature. Man is the discoverer.
</P>
<P>
   But if man is little more than a scavenger, searching the world
for bits and pieces that he can use, he has been a resourceful and
ingenious one.
</P>
<P>
   Each new-found technological discovery leads to the next, like
the pieces of a giant jigsaw puzzle that slowly form a beautiful
picture as they are put together. Signal flags and smoke signals
created the working knowledge of communicating in code, which
opened the door for the telegraph, which taught the lessons of
communicating over a network, which made it possible to build the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The most frightening part of technology may not be its potential
for destruction, but its potential for change.
</P>
<P>
   Just as we get used to the idea of horse-drawn carriages, the
automobile comes along _ and everything you once knew is suddenly
wrong. Once man grasped the idea of sailing ships, the steam engine
made them too slow for useful work.
</P>
<P>
   There's a practical loss _ skills and careers built on one
technology become useless almost overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Each new technology seems to kill off an old one, even
technologies that appeared too powerful and important to die.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for instance, the first truly digital method of
communicating ... the telegraph and Morse code.
</P>
<P>
   It was a network that erased time and distance. Messages that
took days and even weeks or months to deliver by messenger, train
and boat moved almost at the speed of light over the telegraph
lines. One of the marvels of technology was the laying of great
undersea cables that let messages move by telegraph from Europe to
America. Surely it would last forever.
</P>
<P>
   Or so people thought.
</P>
<P>
   But wireless communications and the wired telephone turned the
telegram into a relic, an antique that now seems quaint and
cumbersome.
</P>
<P>
   New technologies force out the old.
</P>
<P>
   And not all the losses are practical. Some of the losses _
perhaps the most important losses _ are deeper and more
fundamental.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most enduring of all man's traits has been
storytelling. In the earliest days, stories, poems and songs were
passed down orally from generation to generation. But as the
printed word became more important, man's memory faded. Few people
memorize stories anymore; family histories are passed down on
videotape and computer disk, not in stories by the fire.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, music stores sold sheet music and many families
spent the evening gathered around the piano, singing together.
While singing and storytelling haven't died, they've more and more
become the work of professionals and less a part of ordinary life.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, there are books, movies, CDs and television. It would
be difficult to argue that the new technologies are bad. It would
be equally impossible to say that what we lost had no value. We
don't sing as a family as much anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Before you judge all this and decide whether you think it's good
or bad, keep in mind that technology doesn't care what you think.
</P>
<P>
   Since technology has such power over our lives, our jobs and
even over the future of the human race, it is tempting to give it a
human face _ to label some technologies as evil, others as good.
</P>
<P>
   No matter which technology you discuss _ the Internet, atomic
energy, missiles and satellites, commercial television or cellular
phones _ you'll have no trouble finding opposing opinions.
</P>
<P>
   Technology doesn't have a soul. Your television set is no more
good or evil than atomic energy. Each technology has the potential
to be anything man assigns to it because technology is no more or
less than a tool.
</P>
<P>
   And anyone who has used a hammer can tell you that a tool can be
used to do good or to bring pain and destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The only firm rule _ when it comes to predicting the future of
technology _ is that the experts are usually wrong. Just a few
decades ago, there were predictions that you'd commute to work in a
car with fold-down wings, that there would be a colony on the moon,
that almost all electricity would come from atomic and wind power.
</P>
<P>
   All these things are technologically possible, but proved
impractical, socially unacceptable or just plain not wanted by the
consumer.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best way to look at the future of technology is to
study the past.
</P>
<P>
   So today, as you look at what other readers have to say about
the most important technologies of the recent past, you may find
common threads that show what the real experts, people like you _
those who use technology every day _ think.

 &HT;    Need some tech support? If you can
 &HT;    get online, sites are filled with advice
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As sure as Christmas, some of you will have trouble
with that new computer you got as a holiday gift.
</P>
<P>
   If it's the only way you have of getting onto the World Wide
Web, you'll have to make do with help from friends or dial the
company's support line by telephone. But if you have another
computer and can get on the Web, there are literally dozens of free
sites that offer computer advice and help.
</P>
<P>
   We'll start with PC Help Desk, a really fine service offered
from the site located at www
</P>
<P>
   .pc-helpdesk.com/.
</P>
<P>
   There are rich databases of information, arranged by category,
on this page, so you may be able to find the answer simply by
clicking your mouse. But there are many other ways of getting help
here, including real-time online chat with other users and by
e-mail. You'll also find Y2K advice, just in case the bug bites you
New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail service probably is the most valuable, since you can
ask a specific question and get the answer by mail.
</P>
<P>
   CyberNet Information Station at www.cyberpc.com/ seems to be
geared toward offering help with Internet and Web questions. But
there also are databases that offer to help with Microsoft Windows.
This site also has a download section where you can find updates
for the programs you use, drivers (the small software programs used
by devices such as printers and modems) and utility programs that
help you make adjustments to Windows.
</P>
<P>
   TipWorld has nothing at all to do with horse racing. It is a
good bet, however, that you'll get help at
www.tipworld.com/0,2724,,0.html for your PC woes. The best feature
of this site is its organization. The PC tips are organized into
logical areas such as operating systems, the Internet, graphics,
computer care and networks.
</P>
<P>
   As is true with the previous site, you'll find a download area
for shareware and freeware programs.
</P>
<P>
   While many other sites offer general computer help, some of the
best advice comes directly from the source: the company that sold
you the computer or software. Almost certainly you'll find the Web
address in the manuals that came with your programs and computer.
Try those sites first.
</P>
<P>
   Also remember that the Microsoft site is massive and _ if your
questions or problems concern Windows or another Microsoft program
_ it's an excellent resource. The site is located at
www.microsoft.com. But since there is so much information stored
here, you'll almost certainly need to use the search feature at the
site.
</P>
<P>
   Intel, which makes the chips that power many PCs, has a site at
www.intel.com. As is true with the Microsoft site, you'll find
helpful information here. If your computer is powered by the AMD
chip _ which competes with Intel chips _ go to the site at
www.amd.com.
</P>
<P>
   Apple Macintosh owners can find help and an excellent source of
information at www.apple
</P>
<P>
   .com.

 &HT;    Taking the Internet out of `the dark ages'
 &HT;    By Heather Cocks
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Above Alan Tannenbaum's desk, overlooking his
high-tech gadgets and powerful computers, hangs an eerily prescient
picture.
</P>
<P>
   The illustration depicts a woman wearing her World Wide Web
browser. A portable computer connected to a headset projects a tiny
computer screen in front of her eye, letting her see and surf
simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   As Tannenbaum talks, the picture seems increasingly like a nod
to his vision of the Internet's evolution. He predicts the Internet
will ascend to a technological level totally free of the clunky
computers and tangle of wires that bound _ and still bind _ this
waning decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still in the dark ages, we really are,'' said
Tannenbaum, senior technical staff member for IBM Corp.'s corporate
Ease-of-Use group in Austin. ``Wireless will be the key. We're
going to see computing shrink and disappear into other devices,
letting us get at the Internet through things we can't even imagine
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   His words echo the pie-in-the-sky idealism of early 1990s
Internet users, who rang in the decade enamored of the then-private
computer network and the vast, mysterious promise it held. Even so,
few expected the Internet to explode like it has.
</P>
<P>
   Global business-to-consumer sales over the Internet surged 179
percent this year, becoming a $31.2 billion industry on pace to top
$380 billion in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   And with 160 million global users and climbing, the Internet has
blossomed from a private playground into a diverse hybrid medium _
part information hotbed, part economic model _ that analysts say
will become increasingly pervasive in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   They might not don cyborg-chic headgear like the woman gracing
Tannenbaum's wall, but many of the 500 million people expected to
connect to the Internet in 2003 will do so on devices less
conventional than today's personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   Computer makers are already trading traditional, fully-loaded
beige boxes for stylish designs that encase very basic,
Internet-centric machines. Austin-based Netpliance Inc. and Pacific
Bell took it a step further this year, unveiling small portable
machines just for e-mailing and limited online shopping. Prototypes
have appeared for Internet-ready refrigerators and cars.
</P>
<P>
   Tannenbaum, who in 25 years at IBM has literally witnessed the
Internet's development, predicts the fashion industry will shrink
Web connections even further. In New York City this past October,
InfoCharm Inc. staged a fashion show where statuesque models
strutted the catwalk wearing Web connections and keyboards sewn
into shirts, pants and jackets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fashion will be a critical part of the success of Internet
devices,'' Tannenbaum said. ``Once people start wearing these tools
built into our belts and watches and shoes, then no one will want
to walk around with just the standard watch or shoe any more. The
computer industry will take that into account.'' Some claim content
will again reign supreme, at the expense of traditional media.
Other pundits espouse Tannenbaum's belief that wireless Web access
will define the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   At work, where a wall of framed patents and awards herald his
IBM career, Tannenbaum is already part of the way there.
</P>
<P>
   A small antenna turns his laptop into a wireless device, which
he totes through the hallways without severing his Internet
connection. A second laptop sits idly on his desk, its sole
function to forward important e-mails to Tannenbaum's pager when he
is away from the office.
</P>
<P>
   One spiral notebook and a thin stack of papers sit nearby, tidy
relics of an age when paper memos provided the most important link
between corporate departments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ordinary correspondence is a thing of the past,'' Tannenbaum
said. ``When we had big documents to print, everyone would worry
about how it looked on paper, but today paper itself is unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not the Internet turns the paperless office into a
worldwide reality, most analysts agree that it will continue to
spur a total shift in the way people view computing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very exciting energy,'' said Barry Parr, an analyst
withresearch company International Data Corp. ``The Internet has
become an honest-to-God mainstream thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different world even from last year, and we realize
it's just at the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   A GLOBAL KISS
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to my page! I kiss you!!'' proclaims the large black
text on the Web site of Mahir, a Turkish man whose goofy,
self-promoting page has became an Internet phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   Mahir's site is representative of a familiar Internet
occurrence: Surfers stumbled on his Web site and e-mailed their
friends. Like wildfire, word of the site swept the globe, spawning
at least 15 parodies and enticing millions _ for no particular
reason other than curiosity _ to e-mail Mahir or check out photos
of him posing by his car, sunbathing, or engrossed in ping-pong.
His site now accepts advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a modern miracle,'' Parr said. ``We've entered this age
where people become Internet celebrities not based on anything but
that they did something mildly amusing.''
</P>
<P>
   In this decade, arguably the most essential societal turning
point was the invention of the Web, an easy-to-use graphic
interface that triggered the Internet's explosion in 1995 and
propelled it into popular consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Mahir's sudden stardom also exemplifies the Internet's
extraordinary use as a forum for meeting and communicating with new
people. Today roughly 10 percent of Internet users have their own
home page, and 25 percent have at least one close friend they've
met online, Parr said.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, PC prices have plummeted, and customers can get
three-figure rebates _ sometimes free PCs _ in exchange for signing
long-term contracts with various Internet service providers. Still,
increasingly cognizant of the Internet's undying consumer appeal,
this year a host of computer companies began making machines geared
toward simplifying network access.
</P>
<P>
   In late November, Dell released its Webpc, a stripped-down
computer optimized for Internet use. That and the similar iPaq from
Compaq Computer Corp., Dell's Houston-based rival, are the latest
entries in a market evolution sparked in 1998 by Apple Computer
Corp.'s plug-and-play iMac.
</P>
<P>
   To Parr, that underscores the degree to which the Internet's
popularity will shape the computer industry. While shopping for the
right machine for his mother, Parr realized hardware is a headache
for most people _ they just want simple devices that access the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are buying computers because they want to get onto the
Net, not because they actually want computers,'' said the analyst.
``My mother doesn't want a 'technology solution,' she just wants to
e-mail and play bridge.''
</P>
<P>
   E-COMMERCE PLAYS BIG ROLE
</P>
<P>
   If you did any holiday shopping online this year, you helped
spur the fastest growing sector of the Internet economy:
e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Since last year, the number of e-commerce companies has doubled
and their revenues swelled 127 percent, according to a study by the
Center for Research in Electronic Commerce at the University of
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   This holiday season alone, e-commerce companies are expected to
take in between $6 billion and $15 billion in revenues _ a
phenomenal amount of money for a sector that barely registered two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Tannenbaum of IBM readily admits to feeding into the frenzy. An
avid collector of antique books _ his passion is Lewis Carroll _ he
traded piles of catalogs and snail-mail missives for online
auctions, chat rooms, libraries and e-mail networks. Through
browsing and buying online, Tannenbaum quickly built his collection
to 2,000 items.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world is a marketplace,'' Tannenbaum said. ``I even have a
Mastercard that's just for Internet shopping.''
</P>
<P>
   Parr said he hopes the new decade quiets the e-commerce buzz,
molding the network back into a true information medium and less of
a shopping tool.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope we stop talking about it, because there's so much more
to the Internet than that,'' Parr said. ``It's like when the
telephone comes along and all anyone can talk about is
telemarketing. Content should be king.''
</P>
<P>
   If that transformation happens, it will hinge on wireless
technology, according to both Tannenbaum and UT professor Andrew
Whinston, who heads the school's e-commerce research efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Mobile phones with built-in Internet browsers are already
becoming a bridge between the wired world and the wearable Web,
delivering information with a portable immediacy desktop computers
currently lack. As constant connectivity becomes ubiquitous,
Whinston said he expects to see more books, newspapers and
magazines published entirely online, redefining traditional
perceptions of news and information.
</P>
<P>
   It's hardly a new idea _ pundits envisioned the death of
traditional media earlier in the decade when the Web rose to
prominence. But wireless adds a critical dimension to the debate
that Whinston claims changes it from theory into inevitability.
</P>
<P>
   ``The view will be, what happened six hours ago is history,''
Whinston said. ``If you want to know what's happening right this
minute, you want information delivered to a wireless device. If
companies can't respond to that need, they'll lose ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, spending too much time predicting the Internet's future
can be futile.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the online innovations achieved in the past five
years were largely unforeseen _ and unprecedented _ when the decade
began.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years out is too far to predict,'' Tannenbaum said. ``Five
years is too far. Every year we get more advanced, but more
possibilities crop up.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 10 years, we'll probably look back and laugh.''

 &HT;    Take care: Shareware might not be Y2K-ready
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's true that most Macs are Y2K-compliant, but some
may still experience problems with the coming ofthe new year.
</P>
<P>
   The problem isn't with the Mac per se but with the software that
runs on it. Specifically, all that shareware you've been
downloading through the years.
</P>
<P>
   Think about it. Much of this stuff has been discontinued or not
upgraded for months, if not years. It's this type of unsupported
software that could trip up many a Mac user.
</P>
<P>
   A suggestion: Clean out any shareware program, be it a solitaire
game or battle tanks, that you're not absolutely sure has been
upgraded for Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   You can always download another version after the new year when
programmers will be re-releasing rewritten software.
</P>
<P>
   A bit extreme? Perhaps. But in this case it's better to be safe
than sorry.
</P>
<P>
   Another potential problem is using files originally formatted in
PC applications. These files can't take advantage of Macs' built-in
Y2K savvy. No one knows exactly what these files might do to your
Mac, but it sure won't be pretty.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just PC files that could mess with your Mac's brain.
There are plenty of shareware and custom scripts written for big
programs such as Word, Excel and FileMaker that very well might not
be designed to handle 2000.
</P>
<P>
   If you depend on any such scripts or shareware, be sure to
double-check them to make sure they're Y2K-compliant.
Unfortunately, that's no easy task _ especially if you receive this
stuff from a friend of a friend.
</P>
<P>
   The message here is not to panic but to be alert. Seek out
patches online for your favorite shareware and scripts. If you can
afford to, dump the stuff you can't upgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that the Mac itself can process dates after the
beginning of the New Year. How far ahead they can read future dates
varies, though, depending on what operating system your Mac is
running.
</P>
<P>
   The operating system is the software that comes inside your Mac,
controlling everything from the way the screen looks to how
software runs. The original Mac systems can read dates through Feb.
6, 2040. The newer systems can read dates through 29940.
</P>
<P>
   Apple has been trumpeting the Y2K compliance of its machines
since the Super Bowl, when it ran ads pointing out this fact.
</P>
<P>
   The company has also assembled online a formidable database
about what machines and components it has tested to date. You'll
find this site at www.apple.com
</P>
<P>
   /about/year2000.

 &HT;    Companies' core values ring true
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Time magazine calls it dotcommunism.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Amazon.com's Jeff Bezos and MindSpring's Charles
Brewer, prefer to call it ``core values and beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a set of principles that guide the direction of a company.
Other online companies have similar core values _ or at least they
say they do. It's trendy in the dot-com business to say your
company has core values written down somewhere. At the turn of the
last century, many millionaires of the industrial age had just one
guiding principle: Make as much money as possible, as quickly as
possible. But the online world is a kinder, gentler place, if you
believe everything you read.
</P>
<P>
   Out at Amazon's Coffeyville, Kan., distribution center, Time
reports that huge banners hang from the ceiling with phrases like
``Our vision is the world's most customer-centric company.''
Another banner is devoted to the company's six core values:
Customer obsession, ownership, bias for action, frugality, high
hiring bar and innovation.
</P>
<P>
   WINNING FORMULA
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile in Atlanta, Internet service provider MindSpring has
been winning over subscribers and employees with its 10 core values
and beliefs, or the ``cv&AMP;b's'' as they are known to staffers.
</P>
<P>
   They also decorate the walls and even the business cards of
MindSpring employees. At the last MindSpring shareholders meeting,
each of the company's executives took turns reading the core values
out loud.
</P>
<P>
   EarthLink, the Internet service provider that will merge with
MindSpring early next year, has its own list of values and beliefs.
Even the kids working on that Internet start-up venture in the
garage down the street from your house probably try to work the
phrase ``core values'' into a sentence when describing their Web
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   This idea of putting the customer first, honoring commitments
and thinking of ways to make your customers happy is kind of sweet.
</P>
<P>
   In the boom economy of the '90s, the notion of core values seems
kind of quaint _ like something out of a Frank Capra movie from the
1930s. Imagine Jimmy Stewart as the head of an online business
lecturing his handful of loyal staffers and his director of
marketing (Donna Reed or Maureen O'Hara, perhaps) on the importance
of promptly answering every e-mail and keeping every customer
happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gosh darn it!'' Stewart would have yelled at his
earnest-looking group of Web designers, coders and programmers.
``If we don't put the customer first, we'll never be able to take
this company public! Now everybody go have some more free lattes
and get back to work!''
</P>
<P>
   The thing with the dot-com companies and their core values is
that they mean what they say. Even the most hard-boiled Wall Street
analyst will tell you these companies aren't kidding when they tell
CNBC or Time the customer is always right.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the idea of following the Golden Rule is a throwback to
the days when these companies didn't have a hope or a share of
stock in the world. When Brewer began MindSpring in 1993, he said
he wanted to start the kind of company he'd want to work for and
drew up the original core values that are now part of MindSpring's
legend.
</P>
<P>
   But when you hit the big time, with its initial public
offerings, sky-high stock prices, and offices, call centers and
distribution centers all over the country, it's harder to have
thousands of employees who are all fervent believers in one set of
principles. And cynics will say having a guiding set of principles
is just a gimmick and, at the very worst, a cheap way to motivate
employees into believing their hard work is for the greater good,
not simply to line the pockets of the founder and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com was a crazy scheme Bezos cooked up with just a 30
percent chance of making it big. Brewer had no idea he'd be the
chairman of the nation's second-largest ISP. Maybe they just
decided if they were going to go for broke, they might as well do
it with a little class.

 &HT;    RocketChips blasts speeds to megabits
 &HT;    By Kirk Ladendorf
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ You've got to like the name: RocketChips Inc. is
way cool.
</P>
<P>
   But the name isn't why Moises Robinson wanted to work for the
tiny chip startup based in Minneapolis. He liked the vision and the
high-growth markets the company was attacking, along with the
chance to get in with a promising company before a public stock
offering.
</P>
<P>
   So Robinson, a 31-year-old native of Panama and an engineering
graduate of Texas A&AMP;M University, left a job with Oak Technology in
Austin in 1998 to start the Austin office of RocketChips.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a year and a half later, the Austin design office has
15 employees and is nearing completion of its first chip _ a
communications chip based on a high-speed connection technology,
called FireWire, that joins computers and other products such as
digital camcorders.
</P>
<P>
   RocketChips brags that it designs the hard stuff _
communications chips that employ mixed-signal designs, with both
digital and analog circuits on the same chip.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are doing some of the difficult things'' in communications
chip design, Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Added company Chief Executive Ray Johnson, ``The drug of choice
today is bandwidth, and we are one of the pushers.''
</P>
<P>
   The chip was designed for Faraday Technology Corp. of Taiwan,
which wants to break into the emerging FireWire connectivity
market, but RocketChips can sell the chip _ or part of it _ to
other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Privately held RocketChips guards its financial information
closely. It has raised $15 million in venture capital and it has
received licensing revenues from other electronics companies. Its
first three designs are still several months away from going into
volume production.
</P>
<P>
   FireWire looks like a good market to play in. The high-speed
connectivity technology was invented by Apple Computer Inc. and
became a public standard in 1995. Research firm Cahners In-Stat
Group predicts the market is about to explode, from shipments of
about 10 million units in 1999 to nearly 200 million units
(including computers, video camcorders and printers) in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The current version of FireWire is very quick _ it can move data
at speeds ranging from 100 megabits per second to 400 megabits per
second. And there is an even faster version of the technology is in
the works.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a high-bandwidth application, particularly if you
have audio and video content, then FireWire is a very elegant
solution,'' said Mark Kirstein, vice president of research at
Cahners In-Stat.
</P>
<P>
   FireWire is fast and it is also ``peer-to-peer.'' That means
that a digital video camcorder with a FireWire connection can
communicate directly with a printer with the same connection
without going through a computer.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of startup companies are working on FireWire-related
chips, Kirstein said, but RocketChips is the only one that has
taken on the analog part of the solution.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson's next challenge is to double the size of the Austin
design center in the next year so the company can turn out more
designs. RocketChips also has design centers in Minneapolis and in
Ames, Iowa, where it has a close relationship with Iowa State
University. The design teams are connected by high-speed telephone
lines so engineers can ship complex computer files back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   Mixed-signal design capabilities are going to be crucial for
high-speed communications chips, Robinson said, so his company
already is attracting the interest of other chip companies that
want to partner with it new chip designs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of people rooting for us in the industry,''
Robinson said. ``I think we have something big going on here.''

 &HT;    Yahoo's magazine rings in '00 by picking best of Web
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Given the approaching end of the year and century,
it's time for ``best of'' lists. Yahoo Internet Life features in
its January issue a ``Top of the Net'' list of the 100 best Web
sites for 2000. There are also several stories that look back on
the year online and forward to the coming year, as well as
examining the most popular sites now and for the future. You'll
find few surprises in what's been popular among sites. Topping the
list of Internet sites this past year was, for example, the one
promoting the film ``Star Wars: Episode I.''
</P>
<P>
   ON CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   The holiday season brings the release of computer CD games
ranging from classic to modern. In the classic category is the
latest version of mah-jongg, published by Activision as ``Shanghai:
Second Dynasty.'' This version includes a vast assortment of
mah-jongg games. You can play against the clock or against
opponents. ``Second Dynasty'' is available for both Macs and PCs.
</P>
<P>
   For those with modern tastes, Activision has also released the
latest version of ``Quake,'' called ``Quake III.'' This is a very
violent game, so parents and those who find this genre offensive
beware. What's new is the number of warriors players can choose
from and the graphics. Everything now, of course, is 3-D. ``Quake
III'' is available only for PCs with Windows 95 or higher.
</P>
<P>
   ONLINE
</P>
<P>
   Now for something completely different. If you're sick of all
the celebrity hype, check out a site called Quirked. The site
features pictures of celebrities distorted through Kai's Power Goo.
You'll find, for example, Al Gore twisted into the Joker. Another
favorite is Leonardo DiCaprio converted into a Spock look-alike. Or
how about John Travolta with a head like Jabba the Hut? You get the
idea. You'll find Quirked at www.quirked.com.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ten kids will win four passes each to the Peach Bowl
FanFest on Thursday and win a Chick-fil-A cow and ``cowlendar.''
All you have to do is answer three questions about the bowl. Call
404-760-0965 and read your answers and give your name and number.
You will be notified by phone on Tuesday if you've won. You'll find
the answers at www.chick-fil-apeachbowl.com. You must be 6 to 14 to
enter. The first 10 correct callers will be chosen. Here are the
questions: 1. When the Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl tickets sold out,
what was the total number of seats filled at the Georgia Dome? 2.
How many years has Atlanta hosted the Peach Bowl? 3. What are the
mascots of this year's Peach Bowl teams?
</P>
<P>
   IT'S MY MILLENNIUM FIRST
</P>
<P>
   Who will see the first sunrise of the new millennium? Several
island nations in the South Pacific, including Fiji and New
Zealand, are claiming that distinction. The world is divided into
24 time zones. The time changes usually by an hour from zone to
zone. At the International Date Line, which runs through the
Pacific Ocean, the date changes. Dawn on Jan. 1 will arrive on New
Zealand 17 hours before it hits Georgia.

 &HT;    Pass the popcorn: '99 movie trends
 &HT;    By Robert Sims
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _
</P>
<P>
   Now selling licenses for Gungan hunting season: Jar Jar Binks _
perceived racial stereotype and subject of numerous Internet death
threats _ symbolized the aggressively infantile nature of ``Star
Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace.'' And this prequel's long
stretches of mundane exposition and overwhelming emphasis on
special effects revealed that George Lucas has lost his touch after
a 22-year sabbatical from directing.
</P>
<P>
   Best-kept secret: Know anyone who spilled the beans after
experiencing ``The Sixth Sense''?
</P>
<P>
   Two reasons for the Academy of Motions Pictures and Sciences to
create a special Best Adolescent acting category: Kimberly J. Brown
in ``Tumbleweeds'' and Haley Joel Osment in ``The Sixth Sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Time to invest $400 in a camcorder: ``The Blair Witch Project,''
a creepy tale shakily shot on video for less than the price of a
new car, raked in $140 million at the box office this past summer.
</P>
<P>
   Been There, Seen That, Enough Already: Hollywood churned out the
unnecessary remakes ``Jakob the Liar,'' ``The Out-of-Towners,''
``The Haunting,'' ``The House on Haunted Hill,'' ``The King and
I,'' ``Anna and the King'' and ``The Thomas Crown Affair.'' And
attempts to bring TV rerun staples ``My Favorite Martian,''
``Inspector Gadget'' and ``Wild, Wild West'' to the silver screen
proved less entertaining than a Ron Popeil infomerical.
</P>
<P>
   Much ado about nothing: The relatives of David Berkowitz's
victims condemned Spike Lee for employing the Son of Sam murders as
a backdrop to ``Summer of Sam,'' but Lee neither trivialized the
killing spree nor painted Berkowitz as anything other than a
callous and unbalanced murderer. Then Catholic protesters declared
blasphemous ``Dogma,'' a comedy starring buddies Ben Affleck and
Matt Damon as exiled angels looking for a way back to Heaven.
``Dogma'' director Kevin Smith certainly dissed organized religion,
especially Catholicism, but the film unfolded as a more
faith-affirming experience than a sermon belted out by any
silver-tongued televangelist.
</P>
<P>
   Parent of the Year: In ``October Sky,'' Chris Cooper urges his
son to follow him down the mine rather than pursue his dream to
become a rocket scientist. In ``American Beauty,'' Cooper resorts
to beating some sense into his wayward son while harboring his own
darks secrets and desires.
</P>
<P>
   Smells too much like teen spirit: Generation Y chose to make
successes of ``Varsity Blues,'' ``She's All That,'' ``Cruel
Intentions,'' ``Never Been Kissed'' and ``American Pie'' while
rejecting the smart and tart-tongued ``Rushmore,'' ``Go'' and
``Election.'' Makes you wonder about our future generation of
politicians and business leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But will they regret it in the morning?: Members of the Academy
for the Arts and Sciences surprised everyone most conspicuously
director Steven Spielberg by handing the Best Picture Oscar to the
delightfully witty ``Shakespeare in Love'' and not Spielberg's
bloody but pragmatic portrait of men in war, ``Saving Private
Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   Eeriest time to pass on the exploding Omega watch: Desmond
Llewelyn, aka Q, died this month in a car crash soon after
introducing 007 to his assistant, played by John Cleese, in ``The
World Is Not Enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Drum roll please: The winner of the Gene Hackman/Michael Caine
Ubiquity Award goes to Julianne Moore for ``Cookie's Fortune,''
``An Ideal Husband,'' ``Magnolia,'' ``The End of the Affair'' and
``Map of the World.''

 &HT;    Will this be on my permanent record?
 &HT;    By Keith Still
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ What lists your grades, might tell whether you've been
naughty or nice and will be around for 100 years? No, it's not some
list Santa is keeping. It's your permanent academic record, and
it's on file right now at your school or school system's office.
</P>
<P>
   Don't panic yet. While state law says that your ``permanent''
record is just that, the files are used mainly for administrative
purposes. They can be passed from school to school as you move.
</P>
<P>
   ``The school administration can look at your records, and if
they see you're not doing well in reading, they'll try to work out
a program to help,'' said Spencer Ragsdale, public information
director for DeKalb County Schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a big flurry of use in the first year or two after
graduation, when colleges need students' records. After that, not
much is done with them.''
</P>
<P>
   So what exactly goes in these records and why do schools keep
them so long? The state requires that your records be retained
permanently for student use and for historical purposes, said Peter
Schinkel, retention schedule program manager at the Georgia
Archives.
</P>
<P>
   Your grades, the classes you took, standardized test scores,
academic achievements and awards, special education documentation,
Social Security number and other personal identifying information
are usually in your permanent record.
</P>
<P>
   However, individual school systems might add other details. Some
systems may keep your immunization records, birth certificate
copies or even your disciplinary history.
</P>
<P>
   Don't fret, though. Most discipline offenses, unless they are
out-of-school suspensions, won't be etched into your permanent
record, says Melanie Stockwell, state Department of Education legal
services director. However, Stockwell noted, it does depend on the
individual school system.
</P>
<P>
   Still worried about what might be lurking on your files? This
isn't an X-File. Your parents or legal guardian, and in some
instances, you, can take a peek _ no sneaking around required.
While school systems by law must keep your records confidential,
your parents have every right to look at your personal file, at
least until you turn 18.
</P>
<P>
   If there's something on your record that you think is incorrect
or unfair, you can dispute it. Individual schools may have
different procedures, Stockwell says. But you're generally
guaranteed a hearing if you disagree with what's in the school's
files.

 &HT;    Rocker says he's not racist
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta Braves pitcher John Rocker says he's sorry for
saying mean things about immigrants and gay people in New York. The
pitcher taunted New York Mets fans during the playoffs this year
and added more negative comments about New Yorkers in an interview
with Sports Illustrated.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker told Sports Illustrated he would retire before ever
playing for a New York team. Then added: ``The biggest thing I
don't like about New York are the foreigners. You can walk an
entire block in Times Square and not hear anybody speaking
English.''
</P>
<P>
   When the article was published, Rocker tried to apologize.
``Even though it might appear otherwise from what I've said, I am
not a racist,'' he said in a statement. ``I should not have said
what I did because it is not what I believe in my heart. ... I
recognize that I have gone way too far in my competitive zeal.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves and Major League Baseball are deciding if they should
punish Rocker for his comments.
</P>
<P>
   Government warns of terrorist acts
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government is asking people to be calm but to keep
their eyes open for anything suspicious during the holidays. The
government is concerned about terrorists hurting Americans overseas
and at home.
</P>
<P>
   Airports and border guards have stepped up security measures.
Based on FBI warnings, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service is
X-raying some mail and packages from Germany for bombs.
</P>
<P>
   The government says to be suspicious of mail that you weren't
expecting or of packages left unattended in public places.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 14, an Algerian was arrested in Washington after
bomb-making materials allegedly were found in his car.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. authorities warn that a suspected Islamic terrorist has
issued calls to action to hurt U.S. citizens.

 &HT;    Consumer Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane Greig
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   Q: Don't laugh _ this is a serious problem for my friends and my
big mouth. I need to know who to contact about a problem with the
background music on ``As the World Turns.'' The music is so loud
you cannot hear the dialogue sometimes. Can you find an address?
The local television station could not help me.
</P>
<P>
   _ Skip Duncan
</P>
<P>
   A: You and your buddies are not the only soap fans who have been
missing key lines uttered in the fictional town of Oakdale due to
ATWT's loud music. Add your voices to the chorus complaining to CBS
and, who knows, they might just listen. Send a letter _ or several
_ to Chris Goutman, Executive Producer, ATWT, CBS Broadcast Center,
524 W. 57th St., New York, NY 10019.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Nine years ago, we purchased a Hallmark motion ornament (the
kind that plugs into a Christmas light socket) of a train going
around and through a tunnel. One of the cars fell off, causing the
train to jam, and we haven't been able to use it since. Does
Hallmark have some place we can send it to be repaired? It's
completely enclosed with no way to open it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Kevin &AMP; Diana Gray
</P>
<P>
   A: No, no repair facility. The Hallmark ornament warranty lasts
only three years. Ornaments still under warranty in need of repair
may be returned to Hallmark Fulfillment Center-001, 3640 Market
St., St. Louis, MO 63110-1218. Hallmark will replace the ornament
or reimburse you and return the broken ornament if you would like.
Hallmark customer service advises customers to insure ornaments
when shipping. Sounds like the best bet is to replace it with a new
one. Contact Ornament Trader Magazine at (800) 441-1551 for
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am trying to get in touch with the grandparents of the boy
in Tennessee in the national news. The boy's mother died and he
spent a month with her body in an apartment. I was hoping our
church could start a college fund for him.
</P>
<P>
   _ Johnny Williamson
</P>
<P>
   A: One has already been started for 9-year-old Travis Butler. To
contribute or to send words of encouragement, write in care of the
Travis Butler Fund, National Bank of Commerce, 910 Madison Ave.,
Memphis, TN 38103.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I was completely frustrated at being forced to use a 900
number for passport renewal information and outraged at the
$1.05-per-minute charge. Who exactly profits from this practice and
how can our State Department justify taking advantage of U.S.
citizens in such a way? _ L.S.
</P>
<P>
   A: The U.S. State Department contracts with an agency to handle
the fee-based calls instead of hiring more people to answer
questions. The National Passport Information Center is paid for
with user fees. The State Department receives no money. By the
mid-1990s, the department was unable to answer phones and issue
passports because workload had increased more than 70 percent.
Customers were put on hold for 15 to 30 minutes (usually not
toll-free) and disconnects were common _ as were unhappy customers.
The 900 system works much better. The information is also available
on the Web at travel.state.gov. Q: My granddaughter would like a
crystal growing kit. Toys ``R'' Us had none. _ M.K.W.A: Neither
does any other retailer I contacted. Order all the ingredients for
$9 (except food coloring) by calling Mrs. Stewart's at Luther, Ford
and Co., (800) 325-7785 or check the Web site at
www.mrsstewart.com. Or make your own with Mrs. Stewart's Bluing.
For complete instructions, send me a stamped self-addressed
envelope or an e-mail request. In addition to the bluing, you will
need a glass or plastic bowl, pieces of coal, tile, porous brick or
sponge, water, table salt, Mercurochrome, vegetable coloring or
ink. When you are finished with the project, toss the container.
</P>
<P>
   Contact Jane Greig, author of ``Thanks for Asking,'' at P.O. Box
670, Austin, TX 78767; (512) 445-3697; e-mail
jgreig(at)statesman.com or fax (512) 445-3968. Due to the number of
inquiries, not all questions can be answered or acknowledged.

 &HT;    Author found drama in the dark side
 &HT;    By Laura Dempsey
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ To read a mystery is to know with general
certainty that the crime _ murder, most likely _ will be solved and
the killer exposed and punished. It's a large part of the reason
for the genre's enduring popularity: In fiction, no one sins with
impunity.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Highsmith knew better. She knew from a tender age that
killers walk among us, that pyromaniacs and kleptomaniacs and
sociopaths of every order live just down the street. She knew that
chance and chance alone kept the world in check, and that one small
rumble could start a landslide from which no one would be safe. To
read Highsmith is to be reminded of this, again and again, in pages
of disarmingly simple prose that mask the deep, disturbing message
of her work: Given half a chance, me-first trumps morality. Every
time.
</P>
<P>
   Highsmith's characters, most notably the enduringly creepy Tom
Ripley, are rightfully paranoid and unconscionably free of guilt.
If, like Ripley, they're murderers, they are afraid only of getting
caught. The deed doesn't haunt them, and no tell-tale heart will
ever force a confession.
</P>
<P>
   Highsmith's first book, ``Strangers on a Train,'' was published
in 1950. Alfred Hitchcock turned the story into a movie a year
later in what would seem to be a meeting of like minds, artists of
the dark side. The film, a necessarily watered-down version of the
novel, featured Robert Walker as Bruno, who proposes a brilliant
tit-for-tat murder scheme with a less-willing Guy, played by Farley
Granger.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 50 years later, another of Highsmith's novels has been
adapted by a classic filmmaker: Anthony Minghella, who won awards
with his screen version of Michael Ondaatje's seemingly unfilmmable
novel, ``The English Patient,'' has taken on ``The Talented Mr.
Ripley,'' Highsmith's 1955 classic. The film will _ and should _
stand alone, as movies must follow a different set of rules
regarding their heroes. Matt Damon's Ripley shows a tender, nearly
sweet nature that works well for the film, but which fans of
Highsmith's books will find highly uncharacteristic. The movie
Ripley is tearful and emotional as he bludgeons his best friend to
death. The book Ripley just gets tired.
</P>
<P>
   Highsmith was born in Texas in 1921. She was raised in New York,
graduated from Barnard College and made a lasting move to Europe in
1963, living in England, Italy and France before settling in
Switzerland in 1981. She died there in 1995 at the age of 74. She
lived with only a cat, preferring animals to humans and deftly
reflecting recurring inquiries about her sexual orientation _ her
second novel, ``The Price of Salt,'' was a happy-ending story of a
lesbian couple, published under the pseudonym Claire Morgan (Naiad
Press reissued the book in 1984, under Highsmith's name but
retitled ``Carol''), and several books, including the Ripley
stories, have a homosexual undercurrent impossible to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   She was reclusive, granting the occasional begrudging interview
as a duty to publishers and fans, who were largely European _
Americans never quite caught on. Graham Greene and Gore Vidal were
ardent admirers, The New York Times wrote glowing reviews, and
Highsmith wrote prodigiously, leaving 21 novels and seven
short-story collections. Five books featured Ripley, with the last,
``Ripley Under Water,'' being published in 1993. There have been
several other movie adaptations, most notably Alain Delon as Ripley
in the French film version of ``The Talented Mr. Ripley,'' titled
``Plein Soleil,'' and a boyish Dennis Hopper in the role in Wim
Wenders' ``The American Friend,'' based on ``Ripley's Game.''
</P>
<P>
   Her books are usually classified as mysteries, but they are
never tales of detection or crime-solving. Usually, it's more a
case of cat-and-mouse, where the sympathy lies with the hunted.
Highsmith was a master of dark psychology, often crediting her
childhood reading of ``The Human Mind'' by Karl Menninger, which
laid out case studies of the famous psychiatrist's patients _
twisted minds of every category. ``Edith's Diary,'' one of her few
books that doesn't feature a brutal murder or two, is a brilliant
depiction of a mind going slowly insane, written with unerring
logic under a canopy of impending doom. ``Those Who Walk Away'' is
the story of two Americans playing deadly hide-and-seek in Europe,
its impetus the suicide (was it really?) of one's daughter _ the
other's wife.
</P>
<P>
   The genius of Highsmith is her ability to make the unthinkable
become reasonable. Even Ripley, who kills and kills and profits
mightily, becomes the man with whom we identify, and it isn't until
the stories are over that we realize what she's done. We root for
the murderer, and it's not necessarily empathy or understanding
that drags us into his corner: It's good storytelling.
</P>
<P>
   Everyman's Library has packaged the first three Ripley books _
``The Talented Mr. Ripley,'' ``Ripley Under Ground'' and ``Ripley's
Game'' _ into one, fat $26 package, and the movie has prompted a
Vintage Crime re-issue of ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' as a $13
paperback. They are deceptively easy reads, but beware: Highsmith's
world is deep and quite dark, and once entered, it's impossible to
ignore life's shadows. Even _ especially _ under a high-noon sun.

 &HT;    Consumer Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane Greig
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   Q: Don't laugh _ this is a serious problem for my friends and my
big mouth. I need to know who to contact about a problem with the
background music on ``As the World Turns.'' The music is so loud
you cannot hear the dialogue sometimes. Can you find an address?
The local television station could not help me.
</P>
<P>
   _ Skip Duncan
</P>
<P>
   A: You and your buddies are not the only soap fans who have been
missing key lines uttered in the fictional town of Oakdale due to
ATWT's loud music. Add your voices to the chorus complaining to CBS
and, who knows, they might just listen. Send a letter _ or several
_ to Chris Goutman, Executive Producer, ATWT, CBS Broadcast Center,
524 W. 57th St., New York, NY 10019.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Nine years ago, we purchased a Hallmark motion ornament (the
kind that plugs into a Christmas light socket) of a train going
around and through a tunnel. One of the cars fell off, causing the
train to jam, and we haven't been able to use it since. Does
Hallmark have some place we can send it to be repaired? It's
completely enclosed with no way to open it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Kevin &AMP; Diana Gray
</P>
<P>
   A: No, no repair facility. The Hallmark ornament warranty lasts
only three years. Ornaments still under warranty in need of repair
may be returned to Hallmark Fulfillment Center-001, 3640 Market
St., St. Louis, MO 63110-1218. Hallmark will replace the ornament
or reimburse you and return the broken ornament if you would like.
Hallmark customer service advises customers to insure ornaments
when shipping. Sounds like the best bet is to replace it with a new
one. Contact Ornament Trader Magazine at (800) 441-1551 for
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am trying to get in touch with the grandparents of the boy
in Tennessee in the national news. The boy's mother died and he
spent a month with her body in an apartment. I was hoping our
church could start a college fund for him.
</P>
<P>
   _ Johnny Williamson
</P>
<P>
   A: One has already been started for 9-year-old Travis Butler. To
contribute or to send words of encouragement, write in care of the
Travis Butler Fund, National Bank of Commerce, 910 Madison Ave.,
Memphis, TN 38103.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I was completely frustrated at being forced to use a 900
number for passport renewal information and outraged at the
$1.05-per-minute charge. Who exactly profits from this practice and
how can our State Department justify taking advantage of U.S.
citizens in such a way? _ L.S.
</P>
<P>
   A: The U.S. State Department contracts with an agency to handle
the fee-based calls instead of hiring more people to answer
questions. The National Passport Information Center is paid for
with user fees. The State Department receives no money. By the
mid-1990s, the department was unable to answer phones and issue
passports because workload had increased more than 70 percent.
Customers were put on hold for 15 to 30 minutes (usually not
toll-free) and disconnects were common _ as were unhappy customers.
The 900 system works much better. The information is also available
on the Web at travel.state.gov. Q: My granddaughter would like a
crystal growing kit. Toys ``R'' Us had none. _ M.K.W.A: Neither
does any other retailer I contacted. Order all the ingredients for
$9 (except food coloring) by calling Mrs. Stewart's at Luther, Ford
and Co., (800) 325-7785 or check the Web site at
www.mrsstewart.com. Or make your own with Mrs. Stewart's Bluing.
For complete instructions, send me a stamped self-addressed
envelope or an e-mail request. In addition to the bluing, you will
need a glass or plastic bowl, pieces of coal, tile, porous brick or
sponge, water, table salt, Mercurochrome, vegetable coloring or
ink. When you are finished with the project, toss the container.
</P>
<P>
   Contact Jane Greig, author of ``Thanks for Asking,'' at P.O. Box
670, Austin, TX 78767; (512) 445-3697; e-mail
jgreig(at)statesman.com or fax (512) 445-3968. Due to the number of
inquiries, not all questions can be answered or acknowledged.

   Arrest at the U.S. Border Points to a Terrorist Ring
</P>
<P>
   When a customs agent began asking questions at a remote ferry
boat border crossing near Seattle, the nervous driver, Ahmed
Ressam, bolted. His car contained timing devices and enough
explosive chemicals to level a building. By the week's end, the
Algerian from Canada's immigrant underground was at the center of a
spreading international investigation of an Islamic
gangster-terrorist ring.

   Violent Siege Ends
</P>
<P>
   Only days after ending a hostage siege at a Louisiana prison,
six hostage-takers _ all of them Cuban inmates awaiting deportation
_ got their wish: a return flight home.
</P>
<P>
   Local prosecutors criticized the deal, saying it would encourage
similar uprisings by other Cubans imprisoned while Cuba decides
whether to accept them. But the Clinton administration insisted
that the unusual agreement with Fidel Castro ended a siege that had
threatened to turn bloody. A seventh Cuban hostage-taker was
detained after a woman inmate taken hostage said she had been
raped.

<P>

<P>
   School Vouchers Found Unconstitutional
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge has ruled that a program in which 3,761
Cleveland schoolchildren receive up to $2,500 in taxpayer money to
attend private schools violates the constitutional separation of
church and state.
</P>
<P>
   The students will be allowed to continue attending classes until
the decision is reconsidered by an appeals court, and the closely
watched case _ which has already been discussed in the presidential
campaign _ is considered likely to be accepted for review by the
Supreme Court.

   Arrest at the U.S. Border Points to a Terrorist Ring
</P>
<P>
   When a customs agent began asking questions at a remote ferry
boat border crossing near Seattle, the nervous driver, Ahmed
Ressam, bolted. His car contained timing devices and enough
explosive chemicals to level a building. By the week's end, the
Algerian from Canada's immigrant underground was at the center of a
spreading international investigation of an Islamic
gangster-terrorist ring.

six hostage-takers _ all of them Cuban inmates awaiting deportation

   Local prosecutors criticized the deal, saying it would encourage
similar uprisings by other Cubans imprisoned while Cuba decides
whether to accept them. But the Clinton administration insisted
that the unusual agreement with Fidel Castro ended a siege that had
threatened to turn bloody. A seventh Cuban hostage-taker was
detained after a woman inmate taken hostage said she had been

TOUCHED BY `ANGELA': EMILY WATSON STIRS `ANGELA'S ASHES' 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.) 
 (She also has information on how to subscribe to StarBeat, a weekly
package of five intriguing features with color art.) 
 (Includes a color slide of Emily Watson in a scene from ``Angela's
Ashes.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Emily Watson smiles _ details at 11!
 &HT;    The British actress has portrayed serious, damaged characters so
often _ most notably in the Danish film ``Breaking the Waves''
(1995), the Irish-troubles drama ``The Boxer'' (1997) and the
classical-music tragedy ``Hilary and Jackie'' (1998) _ that
audiences across the globe believe that dark clouds accompany her
everywhere and that she breaks into tears on an hourly basis.
 &HT;    At the moment, though, striding into a suite room at Manhattan's
Essex House to discuss her latest celluloid sobfest, Alan Parker's
adaptation of Frank McCourt's best-selling childhood memoir
``Angela's Ashes,'' Watson is ... grinning from ear to ear.
 &HT;    And why not? The two-time Oscar nominee loves ``Angela's
Ashes,'' and has flown in from the Budapest set of her next movie
specifically to talk about it.
 &HT;    Set in the grim, sodden slums of Limerick, Ireland, the
just-released drama casts Watson as Angela McCourt, put-upon mother
of Frank (played at different ages by three young actors) and his
assorted siblings, and wife of Malachy (Robert Carlyle), a
well-meaning alcoholic who can't keep a job and eventually abandons
the family.
 &HT;    Much of ``Angela's Ashes'' was shot on location in Ireland, and
Watson acknowledges that she often ``got a bit low'' during the
filming. Angela's silent suffering made it all the easier to
succumb.
 &HT;    ``On the other films I'd done, like `Breaking the Waves' and
`Hilary and Jackie,' there were very heightened emotional
circumstances,'' Watson says. ``They were like actor's workouts.
Angela wasn't like that _ there's not a scene where she goes,
`That's it! I've had enough!' That's not the nature of the story.
 &HT;    ``It was quite strange,'' she says, ``because there wasn't a
scene where I could let it all out and vent.''
 &HT;    Instead, says the actress, casually dressed in slacks, with a
black-leather jacket over a pink sweater, she had to craft the
character through continuity and subtle interpretive touches.
 &HT;    ``Most parts are joining the dots between events,'' she says.
``You're telling a story through the thread of events _ you try to
find your way as the character feels through that.
 &HT;    ``There were obviously very strong events in Angela's life,''
she continues, ``but she's just got a much less expressed emotional
(range). I don't know if she ever really knew how to grieve, or if
she did grieve but wasn't handed any of the tools of modern
psychology to say, `Your life is a disaster _ do this and do that.'
 &HT;    ``Everything is a disaster, in a way,'' the actress says.
``She's married to an alcoholic. She's lost lots of her children.
The family lived in poverty.''
 &HT;    And then, improbably, Watson smiles.
 &HT;    ``I don't know what I'm saying, really,'' she says, laughing
easily at herself.
 &HT;    Much easier to take was the company of the many children she
worked with while making ``Angela's Ashes.'' There were the boys
who played Frank, as well as the babies and other tykes who
portrayed the McCourt children who died as babies and infants.
 &HT;    ``It was, in a sense, a very straightforward process of getting
right in there for this role,'' she says. ``As soon as I was on the
set, there were usually seven children wanting my attention.
 &HT;    ``There was only so much the assistant directors could do,'' she
adds, ``so I had to be in control of the situation. I had to
marshal them and explain things. They were all desperately excited
and didn't really understand what was going on.
 &HT;    ``The wee little ones never really clicked,'' Watson admits.
``They'd suddenly do things in the middle of a take, like start
chatting away and then turn around as if nothing happened.
 &HT;    ``But they were all terribly, terribly sweet,'' she says. ``The
older ones were a bright bunch, really lovely.''
 &HT;    Considering the somber tone of the film and the glut of
Oscar-worthy serious fare now in theaters, industry observers have
wondered if ``Angela's Ashes'' will connect with a broad audience,
especially those who haven't read the original book. But Watson
seems unconcerned, in part because she doesn't see the film as a
downer.
 &HT;    ``In a way, this is the ultimate American dream,'' she says.
``It's about somebody who lives in terrible poverty in a hovel
somewhere in Europe, used to pray to the Statue of Liberty and
winds up breaking free and going to New York. America represents
salvation.
 &HT;    ``I think it's a real uplifting tale, full of hope,'' Watson
says. ``Frank gets away, and he served the community as a school
teacher. Then he simply wrote down his story, and now he's a
millionaire.
 &HT;    ``That's a great story.''
 &HT;    Watson's own story isn't bad, either. Besides ``Angela's
Ashes,'' she's currently onscreen in ``Cradle Will Rock,'' the
based-on-fact Tim Robbins drama in which she plays an aspiring
actress, and will soon be seen in ``Trixie'' and ``The Luzhin
Defense.'' The last-named film, co-starring ``Cradle'' colleague
John Turturro, is what takes her to Budapest.
 &HT;    ``Trixie,'' it should be noted, is a comedy _ which begs a
question: Did Watson sign on simply to prove to herself, or to the
moviegoing public, that she had it in her to be funny?
 &HT;    ``It's a bit of both,'' the actress says. ``There is that fear
of being typecast. You can't keep on doing the same things, because
if you do too much of that it becomes about your technique rather
than about you serving the story.
 &HT;    ``I did want to look around for something different,'' she says.
``I was reading romantic comedies with names attached, to play the
girl. I was going, `Ohhhh ... ' I'm not obvious casting for
those.''
 &HT;    And then along came ``Trixie.''
 &HT;    ``I read this script from Alan Rudolph, which was just
crazy-mad,'' Watson recalls. ``I play this girl who wants to be a
private detective. She just has a loop missing, and speaks in mixed
metaphors all the time.
 &HT;    ``I just fell in love with it, but I didn't know if I could do
it at all,'' adds the actress, who co-stars in ``Trixie'' with Nick
Nolte, Will Patton and Dermot Mulroney. ``It did have a similarity
to the other things I'd done in that she's a very strong character,
very far removed from who I am.''
 &HT;    Who she is and where she comes from, Watson says, not only keep
her grounded but also prevent her from relocating to Los Angeles.
She prefers the familiarity and relative anonymity of London, where
she lives with her husband.
 &HT;    ``For me to live in London and do the work I do is just
essential,'' she says. ``Some people love (Hollywood) and it suits
them very well, but I don't think I'd take to being in that
lifestyle and having that pressure all the time.
 &HT;    ``I've done all right so far,'' she says softly. ``I'm in a very
fortunate situation, just in the way I went sideways into the
industry, via Denmark _ I've never had to go and knock on film
doors. I did as a theater actress when I was younger, but I did
`Breaking the Waves' and scripts started coming my way.
 &HT;    ``It's probably quite unusual,'' Watson admits, ``and I thank my
lucky stars I'm in this position. I think I'd be a lot tougher and
wiser had I done it another way.''

ETHAN HAWKE AND A STRANGE KIND OF LOVE STORY 
</HEADLINE>

entertainment package.)

 (Includes a color slide of Ethan Hawke with Youki Kudoh in a scene
from ``Snow Falling on Cedars.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Ethan Hawke knows about love stories.
 &HT;    Onscreen, he's starred in two defining 1990s young-love stories,
``Reality Bites'' (1994) and ``Before Sunrise'' (1995), as well as
the upcoming `Snow Falling on Cedars,'' which opens Jan. 7
nationwide.
 &HT;    And offscreen ... well, that's an even better love story.
 &HT;    Hawke first met actress Uma Thurman six years ago, at a bank
machine in Manhattan's East Village. He was immediately smitten _
but there were some problems.
 &HT;    For one thing, she was with ``some really scummy-looking guy,''
Hawke recalls. For another, she ignored his attempts to strike up a
conversation.
 &HT;    They wouldn't meet again until 1996, when they were cast
opposite one another in the sci-fi flick ``Gattaca.'' Hawke was
smitten all over again, but it still wasn't easy.
 &HT;    ``She was shockingly intimidating at first,'' the actor admits.
``She's 6 feet tall and very beautiful. She's intelligent. Wouldn't
you be afraid?''
 &HT;    He persevered, however, and today the two are married and the
parents of a beautiful baby girl.
 &HT;    To judge by his appearance as he settles into a suite at
Toronto's Four Seasons hotel to promote ``Snow Falling on Cedars,''
domesticity suits the former slacker poster boy. Dressed in dark
slacks and a fawn-colored corduroy shirt, he's relaxed and quick to
laugh _ befitting an actor whose film is getting Oscar-caliber
buzz.
 &HT;    Hawke says he identified with the story, based on David
Guterson's best-selling novel, about a pre-World War II teen
(Hawke) who falls in love with a Japanese girl (Youki Kudoh). Years
later, after her family has survived wartime internment camps, she
marries a Japanese man _ and, when her husband is accused of
murder, calls on Hawke's character and begs him to help.
 &HT;    ``There was just something about the story that I found
incredibly moving,'' he says. ``I connected with the subtle way the
story is told. I also like the main idea, which is universal _ it's
about the one love who got away.''
 &HT;    He laughs.
 &HT;    ``Now that I'm happily married, I think about the 40 that get
away every minute,'' he jokes. ``I was sitting in the Four Seasons
bar last night and I thought, `God, life is so different now _ I'm
really going to go home. I'm going to put on Spectravision and
watch some John Travolta movie for a bit.'''
 &HT;    Seriously, though, he admits that his new life is daunting.
 &HT;    ``Being a parent is so incredibly humbling,'' he says. ``The
biggest thing about it is that it's a job that doesn't stop.
 &HT;    ``For the first three months,'' he recalls, ``I was so gung-ho.
I was like, `I'm going to be Superdad!' And then finally it was
just a wash. I was so depressed _ I thought, `I'm a loser, a
terrible dad. I don't get any sleep. I don't work anymore.'
 &HT;    ``But now I've reached some middle ground,'' Hawke says. ``I
realize being a dad is the most average, common thing you can do _
and it's the most exciting.''
 &HT;    Life on the baby track isn't that bad for an actor who never
really wanted everything that came with stardom.
 &HT;    ``I hated the idea of being some teen hunk,'' says Hawke, who
was 18 when ``Dead Poets Society'' (1989) made him a star. ``I
couldn't imagine waking up going, `Who loves me? Who? Who?' ... I
never thought about that sex-symbol stuff. I just wanted to act.''
 &HT;    And indeed Hawke avoided the Brat Pack route of many of his
peers, searching for high-quality films that offered acting
challenges. He played Winona Ryder's slacker boyfriend in the
innovative ``Reality Bites'' (1994), and then after ``Before
Sunrise'' (1995) _ in which he and Julie Delpy spent a talkative
night walking the streets of Vienna _ he took several years off,
devoting himself to stage work and writing.
 &HT;    ``I tried to be careful,'' Hawke says. ``There are a lot of
people who had a big hit movie when they were 18. They aren't
acting at 30. You have to be choosy _ you have to do things you
believe in.
 &HT;    ``I mean, I don't want to sit here and huckster a piece of
crap,'' he adds. ``I don't want to be sitting in a coffee shop with
my friends and not be able to look them in the eye because my
latest movie is a piece of garbage.
 &HT;    ``I'm quite comfortable in the self-esteem department _ I don't
need to see my name over the title of some $100 million movie.''
 &HT;    That self-esteem was tested early. Born in Austin, Texas, Hawke
was raised in West Windsor, N.J., as a shy boy who found an outlet
in the theater.
 &HT;    ``My first play was `The Seagull,' with Tyne Daly and Jon
Voight,'' Hawke recalls. ``I still remember the review: `Ethan
Hawke is more concerned with his pimples than his prose.'
 &HT;    ``The other one was, `The most interesting conversation to have
after watching ``The Seagull'' is, who was worse: Ethan Hawke, Tyne
Daly or Jon Voight? They were all so bad.'
 &HT;    ``I felt like, `Hey, this is so unfair.'''
 &HT;    But the lesson came in handy when ``Dead Poets Society'' made
him an overnight star.
 &HT;    ``It's a very weird experience to be 18 and in a movie that's
nominated for Oscars and grossing hundreds of millions of dollars
worldwide,'' he explains. ``There you are, being flown all over the
world to do press. I couldn't help thinking from that moment on,
`Ethan, you are a made man.'
 &HT;    ``I thought, `OK, so it's nominated for best picture. So next
year I'll be nominated. Three years later, I'll win. And 40 years
later I'll be president of the United States.'''
 &HT;    Nowadays, those dreams are far from his mind. At 28, in fact,
the actor is exploring other fields and re-examining everything in
his life.
 &HT;    Do people have midlife crises at 28?
 &HT;    ``It's not a midlife crisis,'' Hawke says. ``But a lot of people
who have been professionally acting for 16 years are like 36 years
old or 38 now _ they tell me they're bored with it. So I feel
sometimes like, `Gosh, what am I going to do to make this fresh for
myself?'
 &HT;    ``But that's a great place to be as a new parent,'' he adds,
``because I'm ready to dedicate some time. Parenthood is so new and
exciting for me.''
 &HT;    So Hawke moonlights. In 1996 he published his first novel, ``The
Hottest State,'' and he continues to serve as artistic director for
the Malaparte Theater Group, of which he is a founding member. And
he deals with the diapers, too.
 &HT;    And, yes, he admits that finding the time isn't easy.
 &HT;    ``It gets harder when you get older,'' he says. ``Suddenly
everyone starts having children, and it's not quite as much fun to
hang out in the basement talking to your acting friends.''
 &HT;    If all else fails, there's always his wife. The two read each
other's scripts and offer advice, solicited or not.
 &HT;    ``We're very opinionated people,'' Hawke says. ``We're also
different, but I think differences are what make us interesting.
 &HT;    ``We both hate people who go around saying, `I wish I were this,
I wish I were that,''' he adds. ``That's what wrong with life. An
oak tree doesn't wish it was a maple or a cedar.''

 (Includes a color slide of William H. Macy with Craig Kvinsland and
Henry Gibson in a scene from ``Magnolia.'') 
 By JEANNE WOLF and SHEP MORGAN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    William H. Macy's face is so familiar on screens big and small
that he can't go anywhere without being ... well, almost
recognized.
 &HT;    ``People think I went to high school or college with them,'' he
says, smiling. ``Then I'll get nailed by someone as that guy from
`Fargo' or `E.R.'''
 &HT;    Macy, who began his career on stage in ``American Buffalo,''
written by his buddy David Mamet, has become one of film's
hardest-working men, following a nonstop work ethic that kept him
on location for most of 1999, making movies as diverse as the
quirky ``Happy, Texas'' and the mainstream spoof ``Mystery Men.''
Even so, it was an off year _ he was in seven 1998 films, and only
five in 1999.
 &HT;    His latest film is ``Magnolia,'' which reunites him with
writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson of ``Boogie Nights'' (1997).
Macy plays Donnie Smith, an aging former television quiz kid whose
brief youthful celebrity has been replaced by a mundane job in an
appliance store.
 &HT;    Macy, whose stock in Hollywood got a major boost after he was
Oscar-nominated as Best Supporting Actor in ``Fargo'' (1996),
didn't hesitate to take a relatively small role in an ensemble cast
that ranges from Tom Cruise and Julianne Moore to Jason Robards and
Philip Seymour Hoffman, directed by a virtual newcomer.
 &HT;    ``Paul Thomas Anderson kept calling me up while he was writing
the script,'' Macy recalls. ``He said, `You're going to be playing
this famous kid who grew up to become anonymous.' That's the way he
is _ Paul tailors almost every role to the actor that he wants to
play it.
 &HT;    ``I'm ready to keep on doing any film he directs, because he's
the real deal,'' the actor says. ``I've got socks older than Paul,
but he has more self-assuredness than somebody twice his age. He's
the kind of director who doesn't look back _ he doesn't hedge his
bets.
 &HT;    ``Once he gets an idea, he goes with it,'' Macy adds. ``It may
fail, but nobody is going to stop him from putting it on the
screen. And nothing will make him compromise _ no producer, no
box-office considerations, no agonizing over whether the audience
will get it.
 &HT;    ``I think he and Mamet are peas in a pod, distinctive voices.''
 &HT;    To get ready for his role as Donnie, a gay man stuck living in
his past, Macy simply took a look around his own world.
 &HT;    ``I marvel at kids in Hollywood who are 20 and get Oscar
nominations and make millions of dollars and are on the cover of
every magazine,'' he says. ``The problem is that, eventually,
they're going to reach 30. If they're still sane, that is a
testament to how strong they are _ fame and celebrity and starpower
are just completely dangerous two-edged swords.
 &HT;    ``My success has come along a lot later,'' the 49-year-old actor
says. ``If you get it when you're young and then have to face
living without it, it can be devastating.''
 &HT;    Macy has somehow found time to make a series of guest
appearances with his wife, Felicity Huffman, on her ABC series
``Sports Night,'' and he and Huffman also starred in TNT's ``A
Slight Case of Murder'' (1999), which he wrote.
 &HT;    ``The past year has been tough,'' he admits with a touch of
weariness. ``It's an unusually long stretch that I don't think will
be repeated. I don't ever want to do it again.''
 &HT;    Besides, Macy says, he's not one of those actors who doesn't
know what to do with himself when he's not on a set.
 &HT;    ``I have a little cabin in the Vermont woods,'' he says. ``I go
there whenever I can and turn bowls _ I have this killer wood shop,
full of all these great tools. Mostly I make bowls from cherry,
maple, birch and silver birch.
 &HT;    ``I don't sell them,'' he adds. ``I give them away _ you won't
find an agent, a director or anyone who's worked with me who
probably doesn't have one.''
 &HT;    It's been more than a quarter-century since the 22-year-old Macy
first caught the public eye in Chicago, playing Bobby in Mamet's
``American Buffalo.'' They're still talking about his incredible
knack for merging into a character, any character.
 &HT;    ``Becoming a character is a big fat trick,'' he says. ``I'd even
call it a cheap trick. Now you see more and more actors buying into
false teeth, dyed hair, glasses, stuff like that to create an
image. It's seductive, and I succumb to it as much as anybody else.
If you dress me up like King Henry, then I'm the king.
 &HT;    ``But the acting part comes from somewhere else,'' he says,
``and that's what makes the best performances a little more
mysterious.
 &HT;    ``You might be doing a love scene with an actress,'' Macy
continues. ``You're supposed to be head over heels in love with
her, but the reality is that you find her annoying. As a person,
you can't stand her.
 &HT;    ``The great actor will combine those emotions _ his real dislike
with the love he's supposed to be feeling in the scene,'' he says.
``The bad actor will try to pretend that he doesn't find her
annoying at all _ but the audiences are so smart that they'll see
that pretending every time.''
 &HT;    As for research and immersing himself in the world of each
character he plays, Macy leaves that to others.
 &HT;    ``I used to do tons of research,'' he says. ``I would even have
a fake wallet with photo IDs of my character. I finally started
asking myself, `Does the audience care about this? Does it make any
difference?' I say no. But I know actors who are hooked on it.
 &HT;    ``Here's the funny part,'' he adds. ``They do all this
preparation _ and they don't know their lines. They can tell what
kind of plants are growing in their imaginary front yard, and they
can't remember their freaking lines.''
 &HT;    It's ironic that Macy has lately been so convincing as two gay
characters _ the sheriff in ``Happy, Texas'' and Donnie in
``Magnolia'' _ because he's nonetheless managed to create a minor
controversy in the gay community with a single misunderstood
comment.
 &HT;    ``I told an interviewer for The Advocate,'' he says with a sigh,
``that I would find it daunting to actually have to play a love
scene with a guy on film.''
 &HT;    He pauses, searching for the right words to explain himself,
then shrugs.
 &HT;    ``I'd say that again,'' he says. ``I would find it daunting _
but I find it daunting to do scenes with women, too. It's just that
men have beards and women don't. The thought of kissing someone
with a beard doesn't appeal to me _ I prefer kissing someone with
breasts.
 &HT;    ``But loves scenes are just icky,'' he concludes. ``It's hard to
stay serious beyond the first couple of takes. You're making out
with someone while the whole crew is watching you. It's weird.''
 &HT;    He stops, still trying to get something out.
 &HT;    ``A lot of my friends are gay,'' he adds after a moment, ``and I
have a pretty short fuse when it comes to gay-bashing _ playing gay
characters has made me realize how insidious it is.
 &HT;    ``But I'd like to think that both characters were, first of all,
real people,'' he says. ``What they did wasn't about their being
gay, it was about trying to do the right thing or trying to find
love or whatever.''

 (Includes a color slide of Lucille Ball in a scene from ``I Love
Lucy.'') 
 c.1999 TV Guide Canada  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a new millennium begins, television looks back on its first
one _ well, all right, its first century. OK, its first
half-century.
</P>
<P>
   But there've still been some memorable moments, as the staff of
TV Guide Canada captures in this salute to the best of 20th-century
television. &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; TOP STARS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   + Lucille Ball.
</P>
<P>
   By her own admission, Ball didn't think funny. She never wrote
her own material or even suggested comic bits. She had impeccable
timing and a flair for physical comedy, but she knew her weaknesses
_ which is why she demanded the best writers, directors and
co-stars.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, though, she worked harder than anyone on
television, before or since, to please her audience. Which is why
Lucy remains the standard against which all others are measured.
</P>
<P>
   + Johnny Carson.
</P>
<P>
   For 30 years, Johnny Carson made everyone's bedroom a little
cozier. His show was comfortably middlebrow. Guests from Zsa Zsa
Gabor to Bette Midler had nothing to fear from him _ he cared only
about keeping them, himself and his viewers amused.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he retired, Carson had won four Emmys and left three
generations happy as they put out the lights.
</P>
<P>
   + Bill Cosby.
</P>
<P>
   The first black comic to achieve mainstream acceptance, Cosby
broke television's color barrier in 1965, co-starring with Robert
Culp in the hip, irreverent ``I Spy.'' Two decades later he
resuscitated NBC with ``Cosby,'' proving that a sitcom about an
upscale black family could capture America's heart. A jazz
connoisseur, gifted educator and devout humanitarian, he remains,
above all, a true gentleman _ and a Cos to believe in.
</P>
<P>
   + Mary Tyler Moore.
</P>
<P>
   Some people are born comics, some are natural straight men.
Precious few can be both.
</P>
<P>
   On ``The Dick Van Dyke Show'' Moore elevated saucy suburban
silliness to sexy new heights, holding her own against a team of
seasoned veterans and serving as the perfect comic foil for the
arrow-straight Van Dyke. Five years later, on ``The Mary Tyler
Moore Show,'' she proved herself equally charming as the calm
center of a comic maelstrom.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, we've known that when Mary's on the scene, love
is all around.
</P>
<P>
   + Carol Burnett.
</P>
<P>
   Television hasn't been the same since ``The Carol Burnett Show''
ended its 11-season run in 1978. A carrot-topped clown in Bob
Mackie sequins, Burnett sang, danced, mugged shamelessly, screamed
out a Tarzan yell _ anything to keep audiences laughing. But, fun
as they were, Burnett's gallery of unforgettable characters had a
real undercurrent of pathos.
</P>
<P>
   Her warm human touch, as much as her undeniable humor, is the
reason we still love Carol Burnett.
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; TOP CHARACTERS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   + Archie Bunker.
</P>
<P>
   As portrayed by Carroll O'Connor, ``All in the Family's'' Archie
was the epitome of blue-collar angst and the definition of social
intolerance _ unabashedly bigoted and unafraid to say so. To him,
blacks were ``spades'' or ``jungle bunnies,'' Puerto Ricans were
``spics'' and his son-in-law was ``a dumb Polack.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor's great gift was the ability to convey Archie's soft
side _ especially when daughter Gloria (Sally Struthers) lost her
baby or wife Edith (Jean Stapleton) was almost raped, but even in
the show's everyday moments.
</P>
<P>
   If there's such a thing as a lovable bigot, it was Archie.
</P>
<P>
   + Lucy Ricardo.
</P>
<P>
   She could be selfish, conniving and even a little cruel. She was
ineptness personified. So why did we love Lucy?
</P>
<P>
   Guts, for one thing _ who else would disguise a 25-pound cheese
as a baby to smuggle it aboard an airplane, or tango with a blouse
full of freshly laid eggs?
</P>
<P>
   We knew each carefully hatched scheme would backfire. We knew
each celebrity encounter would end in disaster. And we always knew
that in the end she'd pick herself up, dust herself off and start
all over again.
</P>
<P>
   + J.R. Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   Described by Time magazine as ``that human oil slick,'' J.R.
(Larry Hagman) was television's all-time greatest bad guy,
power-hungry, unscrupulous, conniving and ruthless. When he was
shot by an unknown assailant at the end of the 1979/80 season, we
couldn't help getting caught up in the mystery: He had so many
enemies that it was impossible to guess who'd actually pulled the
trigger.
</P>
<P>
   + Arthur ``Fonzie'' Fonzarelli.
</P>
<P>
   With apologies to Vinnie Barbarino, the Fonz was the coolest
dude to grace the television screen, clear and simple. He was the
best thing about ``Happy Days,'' and the main reason we tuned in
for 10 years. The producers had envisioned him as a bit player, a
two-dimensional, greasy-haired biker, but Henry Winkler fooled them
_ he made the Fonz someone we all wanted to be.
</P>
<P>
   + Cosmo Kramer.
</P>
<P>
   Television has had its share of wacky sidekicks, but none like
``Seinfeld's'' Kramer. Not so much dancing to the beat of a
different drummer as plugged into another dimension entirely, the
enigmatic Kramer (Michael Richards) defied traditional logic while
creating his own entirely plausible version of it. His cult began
with his trademark door openings, but went on to his
money-saving/making scams, his obsessions with everything from
fried chicken to Merv Griffin and more.
</P>
<P>
   And everyone knows that, if his coffee-table book about coffee
tables had ever really been published, it would have been a
best-seller. &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; TOP MOMENTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   + Neil Armstrong's moon walk.
</P>
<P>
   On July 20, 1969, 600 million television viewers _ almost one
quarter of the world's population _ watched a glowing figure
descend a ladder and step onto sand. The broadcast, made possible
by a live camera set up on the lunar surface, remains a triumph of
television news reporting.
</P>
<P>
   With him aboard Apollo XI were Edwin E. ``Buzz'' Aldrin Jr. and
Michael Collins, but Armstrong stole the show with his comment as
he planted the first footprint on the moon: ``That's one small step
for man, one giant leap for mankind!''
</P>
<P>
   + The Kennedy assassination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Totally unconfirmed,'' Walter Cronkite said on Nov. 22, 1963,
as the first reports of President John F. Kennedy's assassination
came in from Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Thus began four days of pandemonium that pushed television's
news capabilities to the limit. Long before CNN turned newscasting
into a high-tech art, bulky cameras, long-distance phone hookups
and 16-millimeter-film crews had to suffice. Unedited footage was
thrown on the air, yet somehow the networks stayed in control.
</P>
<P>
   When 3-year-old John-John saluted his father's coffin for the
cameras, the ``boob tube'' reached a poetic height.
</P>
<P>
   + The Royal Wedding.
</P>
<P>
   On July 29, 1981, an estimated 750 million people got up as
early as 1:30 a.m. to watch softspoken Lady Diana Spencer become
the Princess of Wales. It was perfect even when it was imperfect _
when a nervous Diana stumbled over Charles' many names, audiences
everywhere laughed in support, then dabbed away a happy tear.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen years later, her funeral would bring an era to a sad
close.
</P>
<P>
   + The end of ``M*A*S*H.''
</P>
<P>
   When ``M*A*S*H'' took its final bow on February 28, 1983, after
11 seasons, it proved to be the last great television blockbuster.
Soon the arrival of multichannel cable would severely splinter
network viewership, and even ``Seinfeld's'' farewell would draw
only a fraction of the audience that tuned in for ``M*A*S*H's''
two-and-a-half-hour-long sendoff.
</P>
<P>
   At episode's end, after numerous celebrations and still
unresolved tensions, viewers watched tearfully as Hawkeye Pierce
(Alan Alda) gazed down at the 4077th for the last time from the
chopper that was taking him home, and saw that, on the ground
below, B.J. Hunnicut (Mike Farrell) had used rocks to spell out the
word ``GOODBYE.''
</P>
<P>
   + The Challenger explosion.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 28, 1986, 73 seconds after liftoff from the Kennedy
Space Center, an explosion ripped the space shuttle Challenger to
pieces and killed the seven-person crew, including teacher Christa
McAuliffe.
</P>
<P>
   Carried live on CNN, it was a new generation's Zapruder film _
sickening and unforgettable. &QL;

TOUCHED BY `ANGELA': EMILY WATSON STIRS `ANGELA'S ASHES' 
</HEADLINE>

entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not

DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.)

 (Includes a color slide of Emily Watson in a scene from ``Angela's
Ashes.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Emily Watson smiles _ details at 11!
 &HT;    The British actress has portrayed serious, damaged characters so
often _ most notably in the Danish film ``Breaking the Waves''
(1995), the Irish-troubles drama ``The Boxer'' (1997) and the
classical-music tragedy ``Hilary and Jackie'' (1998) _ that
audiences across the globe believe that dark clouds accompany her
everywhere and that she breaks into tears on an hourly basis.
 &HT;    At the moment, though, striding into a suite room at Manhattan's
Essex House to discuss her latest celluloid sobfest, Alan Parker's
adaptation of Frank McCourt's best-selling childhood memoir
``Angela's Ashes,'' Watson is ... grinning from ear to ear.
 &HT;    And why not? The two-time Oscar nominee loves ``Angela's
Ashes,'' and has flown in from the Budapest set of her next movie
specifically to talk about it.
 &HT;    Set in the grim, sodden slums of Limerick, Ireland, the
just-released drama casts Watson as Angela McCourt, put-upon mother
of Frank (played at different ages by three young actors) and his
assorted siblings, and wife of Malachy (Robert Carlyle), a
well-meaning alcoholic who can't keep a job and eventually abandons
the family.
 &HT;    Much of ``Angela's Ashes'' was shot on location in Ireland, and
Watson acknowledges that she often ``got a bit low'' during the
filming. Angela's silent suffering made it all the easier to
succumb.
 &HT;    ``On the other films I'd done, like `Breaking the Waves' and
`Hilary and Jackie,' there were very heightened emotional
circumstances,'' Watson says. ``They were like actor's workouts.
Angela wasn't like that _ there's not a scene where she goes,
`That's it! I've had enough!' That's not the nature of the story.
 &HT;    ``It was quite strange,'' she says, ``because there wasn't a
scene where I could let it all out and vent.''
 &HT;    Instead, says the actress, casually dressed in slacks, with a
black-leather jacket over a pink sweater, she had to craft the
character through continuity and subtle interpretive touches.
 &HT;    ``Most parts are joining the dots between events,'' she says.
``You're telling a story through the thread of events _ you try to
find your way as the character feels through that.
 &HT;    ``There were obviously very strong events in Angela's life,''
she continues, ``but she's just got a much less expressed emotional
(range). I don't know if she ever really knew how to grieve, or if
she did grieve but wasn't handed any of the tools of modern
psychology to say, `Your life is a disaster _ do this and do that.'
 &HT;    ``Everything is a disaster, in a way,'' the actress says.
``She's married to an alcoholic. She's lost lots of her children.
The family lived in poverty.''
 &HT;    And then, improbably, Watson smiles.
 &HT;    ``I don't know what I'm saying, really,'' she says, laughing
easily at herself.
 &HT;    Much easier to take was the company of the many children she
worked with while making ``Angela's Ashes.'' There were the boys
who played Frank, as well as the babies and other tykes who
portrayed the McCourt children who died as babies and infants.
 &HT;    ``It was, in a sense, a very straightforward process of getting
right in there for this role,'' she says. ``As soon as I was on the
set, there were usually seven children wanting my attention.
 &HT;    ``There was only so much the assistant directors could do,'' she
adds, ``so I had to be in control of the situation. I had to
marshal them and explain things. They were all desperately excited
and didn't really understand what was going on.
 &HT;    ``The wee little ones never really clicked,'' Watson admits.
``They'd suddenly do things in the middle of a take, like start
chatting away and then turn around as if nothing happened.
 &HT;    ``But they were all terribly, terribly sweet,'' she says. ``The
older ones were a bright bunch, really lovely.''
 &HT;    Considering the somber tone of the film and the glut of
Oscar-worthy serious fare now in theaters, industry observers have
wondered if ``Angela's Ashes'' will connect with a broad audience,
especially those who haven't read the original book. But Watson
seems unconcerned, in part because she doesn't see the film as a
downer.
 &HT;    ``In a way, this is the ultimate American dream,'' she says.
``It's about somebody who lives in terrible poverty in a hovel
somewhere in Europe, used to pray to the Statue of Liberty and
winds up breaking free and going to New York. America represents
salvation.
 &HT;    ``I think it's a real uplifting tale, full of hope,'' Watson
says. ``Frank gets away, and he served the community as a school
teacher. Then he simply wrote down his story, and now he's a
millionaire.
 &HT;    ``That's a great story.''
 &HT;    Watson's own story isn't bad, either. Besides ``Angela's
Ashes,'' she's currently onscreen in ``Cradle Will Rock,'' the
based-on-fact Tim Robbins drama in which she plays an aspiring
actress, and will soon be seen in ``Trixie'' and ``The Luzhin
Defense.'' The last-named film, co-starring ``Cradle'' colleague
John Turturro, is what takes her to Budapest.
 &HT;    ``Trixie,'' it should be noted, is a comedy _ which begs a
question: Did Watson sign on simply to prove to herself, or to the
moviegoing public, that she had it in her to be funny?
 &HT;    ``It's a bit of both,'' the actress says. ``There is that fear
of being typecast. You can't keep on doing the same things, because
if you do too much of that it becomes about your technique rather
than about you serving the story.
 &HT;    ``I did want to look around for something different,'' she says.
``I was reading romantic comedies with names attached, to play the
girl. I was going, `Ohhhh ... ' I'm not obvious casting for
those.''
 &HT;    And then along came ``Trixie.''
 &HT;    ``I read this script from Alan Rudolph, which was just
crazy-mad,'' Watson recalls. ``I play this girl who wants to be a
private detective. She just has a loop missing, and speaks in mixed
metaphors all the time.
 &HT;    ``I just fell in love with it, but I didn't know if I could do
it at all,'' adds the actress, who co-stars in ``Trixie'' with Nick
Nolte, Will Patton and Dermot Mulroney. ``It did have a similarity
to the other things I'd done in that she's a very strong character,
very far removed from who I am.''
 &HT;    Who she is and where she comes from, Watson says, not only keep
her grounded but also prevent her from relocating to Los Angeles.
She prefers the familiarity and relative anonymity of London, where
she lives with her husband.
 &HT;    ``For me to live in London and do the work I do is just
essential,'' she says. ``Some people love (Hollywood) and it suits
them very well, but I don't think I'd take to being in that
lifestyle and having that pressure all the time.
 &HT;    ``I've done all right so far,'' she says softly. ``I'm in a very
fortunate situation, just in the way I went sideways into the
industry, via Denmark _ I've never had to go and knock on film
doors. I did as a theater actress when I was younger, but I did
`Breaking the Waves' and scripts started coming my way.
 &HT;    ``It's probably quite unusual,'' Watson admits, ``and I thank my
lucky stars I'm in this position. I think I'd be a lot tougher and
wiser had I done it another way.''

 (Includes a color slide of Ethan Hawke with Youki Kudoh in a scene
from ``Snow Falling on Cedars.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Ethan Hawke knows about love stories.
 &HT;    Onscreen, he's starred in two defining 1990s young-love stories,
``Reality Bites'' (1994) and ``Before Sunrise'' (1995), as well as
the upcoming `Snow Falling on Cedars,'' which opens Jan. 7
nationwide.
 &HT;    And offscreen ... well, that's an even better love story.
 &HT;    Hawke first met actress Uma Thurman six years ago, at a bank
machine in Manhattan's East Village. He was immediately smitten _
but there were some problems.
 &HT;    For one thing, she was with ``some really scummy-looking guy,''
Hawke recalls. For another, she ignored his attempts to strike up a
conversation.
 &HT;    They wouldn't meet again until 1996, when they were cast
opposite one another in the sci-fi flick ``Gattaca.'' Hawke was
smitten all over again, but it still wasn't easy.
 &HT;    ``She was shockingly intimidating at first,'' the actor admits.
``She's 6 feet tall and very beautiful. She's intelligent. Wouldn't
you be afraid?''
 &HT;    He persevered, however, and today the two are married and the
parents of a beautiful baby girl.
 &HT;    To judge by his appearance as he settles into a suite at
Toronto's Four Seasons hotel to promote ``Snow Falling on Cedars,''
domesticity suits the former slacker poster boy. Dressed in dark
slacks and a fawn-colored corduroy shirt, he's relaxed and quick to
laugh _ befitting an actor whose film is getting Oscar-caliber
buzz.
 &HT;    Hawke says he identified with the story, based on David
Guterson's best-selling novel, about a pre-World War II teen
(Hawke) who falls in love with a Japanese girl (Youki Kudoh). Years
later, after her family has survived wartime internment camps, she
marries a Japanese man _ and, when her husband is accused of
murder, calls on Hawke's character and begs him to help.
 &HT;    ``There was just something about the story that I found
incredibly moving,'' he says. ``I connected with the subtle way the
story is told. I also like the main idea, which is universal _ it's
about the one love who got away.''
 &HT;    He laughs.
 &HT;    ``Now that I'm happily married, I think about the 40 that get
away every minute,'' he jokes. ``I was sitting in the Four Seasons
bar last night and I thought, `God, life is so different now _ I'm
really going to go home. I'm going to put on Spectravision and
watch some John Travolta movie for a bit.'''
 &HT;    Seriously, though, he admits that his new life is daunting.
 &HT;    ``Being a parent is so incredibly humbling,'' he says. ``The
biggest thing about it is that it's a job that doesn't stop.
 &HT;    ``For the first three months,'' he recalls, ``I was so gung-ho.
I was like, `I'm going to be Superdad!' And then finally it was
just a wash. I was so depressed _ I thought, `I'm a loser, a
terrible dad. I don't get any sleep. I don't work anymore.'
 &HT;    ``But now I've reached some middle ground,'' Hawke says. ``I
realize being a dad is the most average, common thing you can do _
and it's the most exciting.''
 &HT;    Life on the baby track isn't that bad for an actor who never
really wanted everything that came with stardom.
 &HT;    ``I hated the idea of being some teen hunk,'' says Hawke, who
was 18 when ``Dead Poets Society'' (1989) made him a star. ``I
couldn't imagine waking up going, `Who loves me? Who? Who?' ... I
never thought about that sex-symbol stuff. I just wanted to act.''
 &HT;    And indeed Hawke avoided the Brat Pack route of many of his
peers, searching for high-quality films that offered acting
challenges. He played Winona Ryder's slacker boyfriend in the
innovative ``Reality Bites'' (1994), and then after ``Before
Sunrise'' (1995) _ in which he and Julie Delpy spent a talkative
night walking the streets of Vienna _ he took several years off,
devoting himself to stage work and writing.
 &HT;    ``I tried to be careful,'' Hawke says. ``There are a lot of
people who had a big hit movie when they were 18. They aren't
acting at 30. You have to be choosy _ you have to do things you
believe in.
 &HT;    ``I mean, I don't want to sit here and huckster a piece of
crap,'' he adds. ``I don't want to be sitting in a coffee shop with
my friends and not be able to look them in the eye because my
latest movie is a piece of garbage.
 &HT;    ``I'm quite comfortable in the self-esteem department _ I don't
need to see my name over the title of some $100 million movie.''
 &HT;    That self-esteem was tested early. Born in Austin, Texas, Hawke
was raised in West Windsor, N.J., as a shy boy who found an outlet
in the theater.
 &HT;    ``My first play was `The Seagull,' with Tyne Daly and Jon
Voight,'' Hawke recalls. ``I still remember the review: `Ethan
Hawke is more concerned with his pimples than his prose.'
 &HT;    ``The other one was, `The most interesting conversation to have
after watching ``The Seagull'' is, who was worse: Ethan Hawke, Tyne
Daly or Jon Voight? They were all so bad.'
 &HT;    ``I felt like, `Hey, this is so unfair.'''
 &HT;    But the lesson came in handy when ``Dead Poets Society'' made
him an overnight star.
 &HT;    ``It's a very weird experience to be 18 and in a movie that's
nominated for Oscars and grossing hundreds of millions of dollars
worldwide,'' he explains. ``There you are, being flown all over the
world to do press. I couldn't help thinking from that moment on,
`Ethan, you are a made man.'
 &HT;    ``I thought, `OK, so it's nominated for best picture. So next
year I'll be nominated. Three years later, I'll win. And 40 years
later I'll be president of the United States.'''
 &HT;    Nowadays, those dreams are far from his mind. At 28, in fact,
the actor is exploring other fields and re-examining everything in
his life.
 &HT;    Do people have midlife crises at 28?
 &HT;    ``It's not a midlife crisis,'' Hawke says. ``But a lot of people
who have been professionally acting for 16 years are like 36 years
old or 38 now _ they tell me they're bored with it. So I feel
sometimes like, `Gosh, what am I going to do to make this fresh for
myself?'
 &HT;    ``But that's a great place to be as a new parent,'' he adds,
``because I'm ready to dedicate some time. Parenthood is so new and
exciting for me.''
 &HT;    So Hawke moonlights. In 1996 he published his first novel, ``The
Hottest State,'' and he continues to serve as artistic director for
the Malaparte Theater Group, of which he is a founding member. And
he deals with the diapers, too.
 &HT;    And, yes, he admits that finding the time isn't easy.
 &HT;    ``It gets harder when you get older,'' he says. ``Suddenly
everyone starts having children, and it's not quite as much fun to
hang out in the basement talking to your acting friends.''
 &HT;    If all else fails, there's always his wife. The two read each
other's scripts and offer advice, solicited or not.
 &HT;    ``We're very opinionated people,'' Hawke says. ``We're also
different, but I think differences are what make us interesting.
 &HT;    ``We both hate people who go around saying, `I wish I were this,
I wish I were that,''' he adds. ``That's what wrong with life. An
oak tree doesn't wish it was a maple or a cedar.''

 (Includes a color slide of William H. Macy with Craig Kvinsland and
Henry Gibson in a scene from ``Magnolia.'') 
 By JEANNE WOLF and SHEP MORGAN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    William H. Macy's face is so familiar on screens big and small
that he can't go anywhere without being ... well, almost
recognized.
 &HT;    ``People think I went to high school or college with them,'' he
says, smiling. ``Then I'll get nailed by someone as that guy from
`Fargo' or `E.R.'''
 &HT;    Macy, who began his career on stage in ``American Buffalo,''
written by his buddy David Mamet, has become one of film's
hardest-working men, following a nonstop work ethic that kept him
on location for most of 1999, making movies as diverse as the
quirky ``Happy, Texas'' and the mainstream spoof ``Mystery Men.''
Even so, it was an off year _ he was in seven 1998 films, and only
five in 1999.
 &HT;    His latest film is ``Magnolia,'' which reunites him with
writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson of ``Boogie Nights'' (1997).
Macy plays Donnie Smith, an aging former television quiz kid whose
brief youthful celebrity has been replaced by a mundane job in an
appliance store.
 &HT;    Macy, whose stock in Hollywood got a major boost after he was
Oscar-nominated as Best Supporting Actor in ``Fargo'' (1996),
didn't hesitate to take a relatively small role in an ensemble cast
that ranges from Tom Cruise and Julianne Moore to Jason Robards and
Philip Seymour Hoffman, directed by a virtual newcomer.
 &HT;    ``Paul Thomas Anderson kept calling me up while he was writing
the script,'' Macy recalls. ``He said, `You're going to be playing
this famous kid who grew up to become anonymous.' That's the way he
is _ Paul tailors almost every role to the actor that he wants to
play it.
 &HT;    ``I'm ready to keep on doing any film he directs, because he's
the real deal,'' the actor says. ``I've got socks older than Paul,
but he has more self-assuredness than somebody twice his age. He's
the kind of director who doesn't look back _ he doesn't hedge his
bets.
 &HT;    ``Once he gets an idea, he goes with it,'' Macy adds. ``It may
fail, but nobody is going to stop him from putting it on the
screen. And nothing will make him compromise _ no producer, no
box-office considerations, no agonizing over whether the audience
will get it.
 &HT;    ``I think he and Mamet are peas in a pod, distinctive voices.''
 &HT;    To get ready for his role as Donnie, a gay man stuck living in
his past, Macy simply took a look around his own world.
 &HT;    ``I marvel at kids in Hollywood who are 20 and get Oscar
nominations and make millions of dollars and are on the cover of
every magazine,'' he says. ``The problem is that, eventually,
they're going to reach 30. If they're still sane, that is a
testament to how strong they are _ fame and celebrity and starpower
are just completely dangerous two-edged swords.
 &HT;    ``My success has come along a lot later,'' the 49-year-old actor
says. ``If you get it when you're young and then have to face
living without it, it can be devastating.''
 &HT;    Macy has somehow found time to make a series of guest
appearances with his wife, Felicity Huffman, on her ABC series
``Sports Night,'' and he and Huffman also starred in TNT's ``A
Slight Case of Murder'' (1999), which he wrote.
 &HT;    ``The past year has been tough,'' he admits with a touch of
weariness. ``It's an unusually long stretch that I don't think will
be repeated. I don't ever want to do it again.''
 &HT;    Besides, Macy says, he's not one of those actors who doesn't
know what to do with himself when he's not on a set.
 &HT;    ``I have a little cabin in the Vermont woods,'' he says. ``I go
there whenever I can and turn bowls _ I have this killer wood shop,
full of all these great tools. Mostly I make bowls from cherry,
maple, birch and silver birch.
 &HT;    ``I don't sell them,'' he adds. ``I give them away _ you won't
find an agent, a director or anyone who's worked with me who
probably doesn't have one.''
 &HT;    It's been more than a quarter-century since the 22-year-old Macy
first caught the public eye in Chicago, playing Bobby in Mamet's
``American Buffalo.'' They're still talking about his incredible
knack for merging into a character, any character.
 &HT;    ``Becoming a character is a big fat trick,'' he says. ``I'd even
call it a cheap trick. Now you see more and more actors buying into
false teeth, dyed hair, glasses, stuff like that to create an
image. It's seductive, and I succumb to it as much as anybody else.
If you dress me up like King Henry, then I'm the king.
 &HT;    ``But the acting part comes from somewhere else,'' he says,
``and that's what makes the best performances a little more
mysterious.
 &HT;    ``You might be doing a love scene with an actress,'' Macy
continues. ``You're supposed to be head over heels in love with
her, but the reality is that you find her annoying. As a person,
you can't stand her.
 &HT;    ``The great actor will combine those emotions _ his real dislike
with the love he's supposed to be feeling in the scene,'' he says.
``The bad actor will try to pretend that he doesn't find her
annoying at all _ but the audiences are so smart that they'll see
that pretending every time.''
 &HT;    As for research and immersing himself in the world of each
character he plays, Macy leaves that to others.
 &HT;    ``I used to do tons of research,'' he says. ``I would even have
a fake wallet with photo IDs of my character. I finally started
asking myself, `Does the audience care about this? Does it make any
difference?' I say no. But I know actors who are hooked on it.
 &HT;    ``Here's the funny part,'' he adds. ``They do all this
preparation _ and they don't know their lines. They can tell what
kind of plants are growing in their imaginary front yard, and they
can't remember their freaking lines.''
 &HT;    It's ironic that Macy has lately been so convincing as two gay
characters _ the sheriff in ``Happy, Texas'' and Donnie in
``Magnolia'' _ because he's nonetheless managed to create a minor
controversy in the gay community with a single misunderstood
comment.
 &HT;    ``I told an interviewer for The Advocate,'' he says with a sigh,
``that I would find it daunting to actually have to play a love
scene with a guy on film.''
 &HT;    He pauses, searching for the right words to explain himself,
then shrugs.
 &HT;    ``I'd say that again,'' he says. ``I would find it daunting _
but I find it daunting to do scenes with women, too. It's just that
men have beards and women don't. The thought of kissing someone
with a beard doesn't appeal to me _ I prefer kissing someone with
breasts.
 &HT;    ``But loves scenes are just icky,'' he concludes. ``It's hard to
stay serious beyond the first couple of takes. You're making out
with someone while the whole crew is watching you. It's weird.''
 &HT;    He stops, still trying to get something out.
 &HT;    ``A lot of my friends are gay,'' he adds after a moment, ``and I
have a pretty short fuse when it comes to gay-bashing _ playing gay
characters has made me realize how insidious it is.
 &HT;    ``But I'd like to think that both characters were, first of all,
real people,'' he says. ``What they did wasn't about their being
gay, it was about trying to do the right thing or trying to find
love or whatever.''

<P>
   Most of all, though, she worked harder than anyone on
television, before or since, to please her audience. Which is why
Lucy remains the standard against which all others are measured.
</P>
<P>
   + Johnny Carson.
</P>
<P>
   For 30 years, Johnny Carson made everyone's bedroom a little
cozier. His show was comfortably middlebrow. Guests from Zsa Zsa
Gabor to Bette Midler had nothing to fear from him _ he cared only
about keeping them, himself and his viewers amused.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he retired, Carson had won four Emmys and left three
generations happy as they put out the lights.
</P>
<P>
   + Bill Cosby.
</P>
<P>
   The first black comic to achieve mainstream acceptance, Cosby
broke television's color barrier in 1965, co-starring with Robert
Culp in the hip, irreverent ``I Spy.'' Two decades later he
resuscitated NBC with ``Cosby,'' proving that a sitcom about an
upscale black family could capture America's heart. A jazz
connoisseur, gifted educator and devout humanitarian, he remains,
above all, a true gentleman _ and a Cos to believe in.
</P>
<P>
   + Mary Tyler Moore.
</P>
<P>
   Some people are born comics, some are natural straight men.
Precious few can be both.
</P>
<P>
   On ``The Dick Van Dyke Show'' Moore elevated saucy suburban
silliness to sexy new heights, holding her own against a team of
seasoned veterans and serving as the perfect comic foil for the
arrow-straight Van Dyke. Five years later, on ``The Mary Tyler
Moore Show,'' she proved herself equally charming as the calm
center of a comic maelstrom.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, we've known that when Mary's on the scene, love
is all around.
</P>
<P>
   + Carol Burnett.
</P>
<P>
   Television hasn't been the same since ``The Carol Burnett Show''
ended its 11-season run in 1978. A carrot-topped clown in Bob
Mackie sequins, Burnett sang, danced, mugged shamelessly, screamed
out a Tarzan yell _ anything to keep audiences laughing. But, fun
as they were, Burnett's gallery of unforgettable characters had a
real undercurrent of pathos.
</P>
<P>
   Her warm human touch, as much as her undeniable humor, is the
reason we still love Carol Burnett.
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; TOP CHARACTERS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   + Archie Bunker.
</P>
<P>
   As portrayed by Carroll O'Connor, ``All in the Family's'' Archie
was the epitome of blue-collar angst and the definition of social
intolerance _ unabashedly bigoted and unafraid to say so. To him,
blacks were ``spades'' or ``jungle bunnies,'' Puerto Ricans were
``spics'' and his son-in-law was ``a dumb Polack.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor's great gift was the ability to convey Archie's soft
side _ especially when daughter Gloria (Sally Struthers) lost her
baby or wife Edith (Jean Stapleton) was almost raped, but even in
the show's everyday moments.
</P>
<P>
   If there's such a thing as a lovable bigot, it was Archie.
</P>
<P>
   + Lucy Ricardo.
</P>
<P>
   She could be selfish, conniving and even a little cruel. She was
ineptness personified. So why did we love Lucy?
</P>
<P>
   Guts, for one thing _ who else would disguise a 25-pound cheese
as a baby to smuggle it aboard an airplane, or tango with a blouse
full of freshly laid eggs?
</P>
<P>
   We knew each carefully hatched scheme would backfire. We knew
each celebrity encounter would end in disaster. And we always knew
that in the end she'd pick herself up, dust herself off and start
all over again.
</P>
<P>
   + J.R. Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   Described by Time magazine as ``that human oil slick,'' J.R.
(Larry Hagman) was television's all-time greatest bad guy,
power-hungry, unscrupulous, conniving and ruthless. When he was
shot by an unknown assailant at the end of the 1979/80 season, we
couldn't help getting caught up in the mystery: He had so many
enemies that it was impossible to guess who'd actually pulled the
trigger.
</P>
<P>
   + Arthur ``Fonzie'' Fonzarelli.
</P>
<P>
   With apologies to Vinnie Barbarino, the Fonz was the coolest
dude to grace the television screen, clear and simple. He was the
best thing about ``Happy Days,'' and the main reason we tuned in
for 10 years. The producers had envisioned him as a bit player, a
two-dimensional, greasy-haired biker, but Henry Winkler fooled them
_ he made the Fonz someone we all wanted to be.
</P>
<P>
   + Cosmo Kramer.
</P>
<P>
   Television has had its share of wacky sidekicks, but none like
``Seinfeld's'' Kramer. Not so much dancing to the beat of a
different drummer as plugged into another dimension entirely, the
enigmatic Kramer (Michael Richards) defied traditional logic while
creating his own entirely plausible version of it. His cult began
with his trademark door openings, but went on to his
money-saving/making scams, his obsessions with everything from
fried chicken to Merv Griffin and more.
</P>
<P>
   And everyone knows that, if his coffee-table book about coffee
tables had ever really been published, it would have been a
best-seller. &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; TOP MOMENTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   + Neil Armstrong's moon walk.
</P>
<P>
   On July 20, 1969, 600 million television viewers _ almost one
quarter of the world's population _ watched a glowing figure
descend a ladder and step onto sand. The broadcast, made possible
by a live camera set up on the lunar surface, remains a triumph of
television news reporting.
</P>
<P>
   With him aboard Apollo XI were Edwin E. ``Buzz'' Aldrin Jr. and
Michael Collins, but Armstrong stole the show with his comment as
he planted the first footprint on the moon: ``That's one small step
for man, one giant leap for mankind!''
</P>
<P>
   + The Kennedy assassination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Totally unconfirmed,'' Walter Cronkite said on Nov. 22, 1963,
as the first reports of President John F. Kennedy's assassination
came in from Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Thus began four days of pandemonium that pushed television's
news capabilities to the limit. Long before CNN turned newscasting
into a high-tech art, bulky cameras, long-distance phone hookups
and 16-millimeter-film crews had to suffice. Unedited footage was
thrown on the air, yet somehow the networks stayed in control.
</P>
<P>
   When 3-year-old John-John saluted his father's coffin for the
cameras, the ``boob tube'' reached a poetic height.
</P>
<P>
   + The Royal Wedding.
</P>
<P>
   On July 29, 1981, an estimated 750 million people got up as
early as 1:30 a.m. to watch softspoken Lady Diana Spencer become
the Princess of Wales. It was perfect even when it was imperfect _
when a nervous Diana stumbled over Charles' many names, audiences
everywhere laughed in support, then dabbed away a happy tear.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen years later, her funeral would bring an era to a sad
close.
</P>
<P>
   + The end of ``M*A*S*H.''
</P>
<P>
   When ``M*A*S*H'' took its final bow on February 28, 1983, after
11 seasons, it proved to be the last great television blockbuster.
Soon the arrival of multichannel cable would severely splinter
network viewership, and even ``Seinfeld's'' farewell would draw
only a fraction of the audience that tuned in for ``M*A*S*H's''
two-and-a-half-hour-long sendoff.
</P>
<P>
   At episode's end, after numerous celebrations and still
unresolved tensions, viewers watched tearfully as Hawkeye Pierce
(Alan Alda) gazed down at the 4077th for the last time from the
chopper that was taking him home, and saw that, on the ground
below, B.J. Hunnicut (Mike Farrell) had used rocks to spell out the
word ``GOODBYE.''
</P>
<P>
   + The Challenger explosion.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 28, 1986, 73 seconds after liftoff from the Kennedy
Space Center, an explosion ripped the space shuttle Challenger to
pieces and killed the seven-person crew, including teacher Christa
McAuliffe.
</P>
<P>
   Carried live on CNN, it was a new generation's Zapruder film _
sickening and unforgettable. &QL;

 c. 1999 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Miranda rights,'' a pundit said years ago, ``mean the police
have to use their wits and not their fists to solve a crime.'' It
was true in 1966 when the U.S. Supreme Court outlined Miranda
rights in the Miranda vs. Arizona decision, and it's true today.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, a February 1999 decision out of the U.S. Fourth
Circuit Court of Appeals (United States vs. Dickerson) jeopardizes
our Miranda rights. The U.S. Supreme Court has accepted the case on
appeal. It will be argued before the high court early in the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Television cop shows have familiarized the general public about
Miranda rights and the warning that officers of the law are
required to give those in custody the police want to interrogate.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and
will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to
speak to an attorney and have an attorney present during
questioning. If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be provided
for you at government expense.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Dickerson case, the appeals court in a 2-1 ruling decided
that it didn't matter whether Charles Thomas Dickerson confessed
before or after he was read his Miranda rights _ the confession is
admissible evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court sent the case back down to the trial judge for
further proceeding. There had been a dispute about the timing of
the Miranda warning and the record wasn't clear on whether the
police had given Dickerson the warning before or after he confessed
to aiding in a bank robbery.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, the appellate court, using a controversial statute
passed by Congress in June 1968, nullified the Miranda warning. The
statute (Title 18, Section 3501 of the U.S. Code) allows the trial
judge to determine whether a confession was voluntary or not.
</P>
<P>
   The Section 3501 statute requires a trial judge to consider the
time span after an arrest that a confession was made, whether the
defendant was advised that he was not required to make such a
statement and whether the defendant was advised of the right to
counsel prior to questioning. The judge, however, can ignore any of
this information in ruling a confession voluntary. In other words,
a trial judge may ignore a defendant's rights protected by the
Miranda warning.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno sent a letter to Congress in
September 1997 in which she stated that the Section 3501 statute is
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Reno isn't the only attorney general to question the
constitutionality of the statute. In the 31 years since it was
passed and signed into law, no federal or state prosecutor has used
the statute to override Miranda.
</P>
<P>
   There are two startling irregularities in the Fourth Circuit
Court of Appeals decision to ignore Miranda.
</P>
<P>
   If the congressional statute is used, the trial judge is the one
who makes the determination as to whether a confession was
voluntary. In the Dickerson case, the trial judge ruled that
Dickerson's confession was not voluntary _ using the same
considerations provided both by the statute and by Miranda. But the
appellate court overruled the trial court. Usually an appeals court
defers to a trial court judge's determination of the facts of a
case.
</P>
<P>
   The second irregularity: Neither the federal prosecutor nor the
defense attorney raised the issue of the Section 3501 statute. It
was raised in an amicus brief, by a University of Utah professor
who wants Miranda overturned. And neither the defense nor the
prosecution had an opportunity to rebut the argument raised in the
amicus brief.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the appeals court decided to use this case and the
Section 3501 statute to overrule a significant constitutional
protection for all criminal defendants _ our Miranda rights.
</P>
<P>
   The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals overstepped its judicial
bounds to strike down Miranda.
</P>
<P>
   Miranda rights flow directly out of the Fifth Amendment's
prohibition: ``No person ... shall be compelled in any criminal
case to be a witness against himself.'' The Miranda warning merely
informs a defendant of his right to remain silent in face of police
interrogation.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court's Miranda vs. Arizona decision calls
Miranda rights ``constitutional standards for protection of the
privilege against self-incrimination.'' The courts have called the
Fifth Amendment's prohibition against compulsory self-incrimination
a ``privilege''; in reality, it is a constitutional right.
</P>
<P>
   The Miranda decision later states: ``to respect the
inviolability of the human personality, our accusatory system of
criminal justice demands that the government seeking to punish an
individual produce the evidence against him by its own independent
labors, rather than by the cruel, simple expedient of compelling it
from his own mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   The high court recognizes that the Fifth Amendment is
``fundamental to our system of constitutional rule.'' It outlined
the Miranda warning to protect the right not to be forced to
incriminate oneself.
</P>
<P>
   In his Pulitzer Prize winning book, ``Origins of the Fifth
Amendment,'' the pre-eminent constitutional scholar Leonard W. Levy
traces the origins of the prohibition against compelled
self-incrimination to 12th century England and the human need for
freedom of belief, speech and conscience. ``It was, in its origins,
unquestionably the invention of those who were guilty of religious
crimes, like heresy, schism, and nonconformity, and, later, of
political crimes like treason, seditious libel, and breach of
parliamentary privilege _ more often than not, the offense was
merely criticism of the government, its policies, or its officers.
... In the broadest sense it was a protection not of the guilty, or
of the innocent, but of freedom of expression, of political
liberty, of the right to worship as one pleased.''
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court has erected constitutional standards to
protect other rights. It created the Lemon three-prong test to
evaluate whether a government action or law violates the
Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. It created the
three-prong Miller test so a court could evaluate whether a book or
movie or other materials are obscene and thereby not protected by
the free speech and free press clauses of the First Amendment.
Those constitutional standards flow out of the high court's
interpretation of the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Those constitutional standards trump any statutory law.
Certainly, the court's ``constitutional standards for protection of
the privilege against self-incrimination'' also remain above
statutory law.
</P>
<P>
   The high court recognized in its Miranda decision that ``an
interrogation environment is created for no purpose other than to
subjugate the individual to the will of the examiner. This
atmosphere carries its own badge of intimidation.'' The Miranda
warning simply gives a defendant the psychological leverage to
stand mute instead of being badgered into a false confession _
unless he or she wishes to confess.
</P>
<P>
   Justice is better served when a confession is voluntary and not
one forced by intimidation or physical abuse.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court should confirm that the Miranda warning
remains the constitutional standard that protects our Fifth
Amendment right against compulsory self-incrimination. The Section
3501 statute is too weak to protect that right.
</P>
<P>
   The self-incrimination clause of the Fifth Amendment is the
bulwark of a free people against abuse of police power. It must be
secure.

 &HT;    24 HOURS OF WORRIES AND CELEBRATIONS
 &HT;    With Y2K-WATCH.
 &HT;    Advance for release Thursday, Dec. 30.
 &HT;    Eds: All times are EST.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you want to celebrate the arrival of the millennium hour by
hour _ or track the effects of the Y2K computer bug _ here's what
to watch for around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   FRIDAY, DEC. 31
</P>
<P>
   5 a.m. (EST) _ The Year 2000 arrives at the international date
line, the imaginary marker running north and south through the
Pacific Ocean west of Hawaii. A celebration will be held at
Millennium Island in the Republic of Kiribati, the first bit of
land north of Antarctica that will see the sun rise in the new
year.
</P>
<P>
   6 a.m. _ Auckland, New Zealand's largest city, becomes the
world's first metropolitan area to welcome 2000. Computer experts
will be watching closely to see whether the Y2K bug triggers
software failures in this industrialized nation. Midnight will be
marked with a synchronized fireworks display, accompanied by fire
dancers and Pacific island drummers.
</P>
<P>
   8 a.m. _ Sydney, Australia, enters 2000 by staging what it calls
the world's biggest fireworks show. The display above the city's
harbor will be linked to the 2000 Olympics, to be hosted by the
city.
</P>
<P>
   9 a.m. _ The United States gets its first taste of 2000 when
Guam, a U.S. territory, rolls over into the new year.
</P>
<P>
   10 a.m. _ As Tokyo moves into 2000, Y2K worries abound. Business
and political leaders insist that critical software has been fixed,
but many computer experts believe Japan got too late of a start to
conquer the problem. Small- and medium-sized businesses are
considered particularly vulnerable to Y2K bugs.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a crowd is expected to form at a downtown square called
Ebisu Garden Place to welcome midnight in front of a huge countdown
clock.
</P>
<P>
   11 a.m. _ Beijing hasn't shown much interest in celebrating
2000. Computer experts also fear it has shown too little interest
in preparing computers for the date rollover. The government's
secretiveness makes it difficult to assess Y2K readiness in
critical sectors, such as banking and aviation. Global
manufacturers are waiting to see whether suppliers in China have
fixed computers well enough to avoid factory shutdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Noon _ The Y2K bug will roll over into several heavily populated
cities, such as Jakarta and Bangkok. The recovering economies in
many Southeast Asian nations could be seriously damaged by computer
breakdowns. Y2K experts say risks are high because so many
manufacturers in this part of the world use pirated software that
could be filled with bugs.
</P>
<P>
   1 p.m. _ Dhaka, the capital of poverty-plagued Bangladesh, is
not heavily computer-dependent, but Y2K experts say its power
generation system is vulnerable to software bugs.
</P>
<P>
   2 p.m. _ Residents of New Delhi, India, plan to stage carnivals
in the hours leading to up to a midnight fireworks display. In
recent months, India appears to have made big strides in preparing
its computers for the date rollover. No big problems are expected.
</P>
<P>
   3 p.m. _ Oil companies will be watching as the new year reaches
the United Arab Emirates. This oil-exporting country appears to be
well prepared to deal with the Y2K problem.
</P>
<P>
   4 p.m. _ When midnight arrives in Moscow, many fear
computer-related failures in vital services, such as heat and light
generation. The State Department is so concerned about Y2K flaws in
the power grid that it authorized the voluntary departure of
employees and family members at the U.S. Embassy, and urged
Americans to avoid traveling to Moscow. Many fear Russia also will
be plagued by transportation and telecommunication disruptions. In
worst-case scenarios, aging nuclear power plants shut down or
become unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   5 p.m. _ Perhaps the scariest moment on the New Year's Eve
clock. This is the hour when midnight comes to Israel, which will
be teeming with religious pilgrims celebrating the 2,000th
anniversary of the birth of Jesus at Bethlehem. The Palestinian
Authority, which controls Bethlehem, is planning a music festival,
but many fear that Christian fanatics may cause violence in the
hopes of triggering the Apocalypse. Arab terrorists also may be
planning attacks.
</P>
<P>
   In this same hour, midnight will be reaching the Pyramids at
Giza on the outskirts of Cairo in Egypt, where large crowds of
tourists might make attractive targets for terrorists. Y2K experts
say Egyptian hospitals and hotels may experience numerous equipment
failures.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, midnight also will come to Eastern Europe, where a
swarm of Y2K bugs could get unleashed. The State Department has
issued travel warnings for Ukraine, Moldova and Belarus because of
the high risk of prolonged disruptions in heat and electricity.
</P>
<P>
   6 p.m. _ Another dicey hour. In Rome, a half-million people are
expected to accept Pope John Paul II's invitation to celebrate the
beginning of the 3rd millennium of Christianity. The gathering may
be seen by terrorists as a juicy target. Also, Italy is widely
regarded as being among the West's worst-prepared countries for
fending off Y2K bugs.
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, the Eiffel Tower will burst into a massive, pulsating
show of light flashes. A fireworks display will follow. Then the
action shifts to the Champs Elysees, where 23 large Ferris wheels
will turn.
</P>
<P>
   7 p.m. _ The aviation world will be paying close attention to
this hour, which marks midnight in Greenwich, England. Because
aviation operates worldwide on Greenwich Mean Time, this could be
the moment when Y2K bugs turn up in air traffic control systems.
</P>
<P>
   Greenwich is the site of a huge Millennium Dome, built to call
attention to the borough's status as home to the prime meridian, or
0 degrees longitude. The Dome will be inaugurated on New Year's Eve
by Queen Elizabeth II. Large screens in the Dome will show the
ringing of the Big Ben chimes in London at midnight.
</P>
<P>
   8 p.m. _ The midnight hour passes over the Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   9 p.m. _ The new year arrives in this hemisphere in Rio de
Janeiro, Brazil. Celebrations will be centered around the city's
Ipanema and Copacabana beaches, with musical events, fireworks
displays and samba. But amid the partying, computer experts will be
worrying; Brazil is widely seen as being at high risk for
Y2K-related problems, especially in private industry, which uses a
lot of pirated software.
</P>
<P>
   10 p.m. _ Chile rolls over into 2000 amid praise for its efforts
to deal with the Y2K problem.
</P>
<P>
   11 p.m. _ Venezuela enters 2000 in poor shape. Because of recent
floods and political turmoil, the country already is in virtual
chaos. To add to that misery, computers are at high risk, say Y2K
experts. Breakdowns may be likely in power grids, telephones,
customs services, air traffic control, ports and the oil industry.
</P>
<P>
   SATURDAY, JAN. 1
</P>
<P>
   Midnight _ New York plans to hold its largest-ever New Year's
Eve party in Times Square. City officials expect as many as 2
million revelers, about four times the norm.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the nation's monuments and the White House will
become stages or backdrops for events that will culminate with a
massive fireworks display at midnight. Unfortunately, some
terrorism experts believe that both New York and Washington could
be targeted for violence.
</P>
<P>
   1 a.m. _ Navy Pier on Lake Michigan and the Chicago River will
become the backdrop for the Windy City's laser and firework
displays.
</P>
<P>
   2 a.m. Denver is keeping a very low profile. For the first time
in 11 years, the city has canceled its family-oriented First Night
celebration and has planned no public events.
</P>
<P>
   3 a.m. _ Las Vegas will rock. Officials estimate a million
people will crowd the Vegas Strip for the party, which includes a
light show on Fremont Street and countdown clocks on several
hotels. Big events for high rollers will be staged indoors.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles and San Francisco, most public events have been
canceled because of lack of interest. But police are worried that
rowdy street parties may break out.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, a midnight fireworks display is planned for Puget
Sound, but recent riots and worries about foreign terrorism are
expected to keep crowds small.
</P>
<P>
   4 a.m. _ The new year will be welcomed into the Anchorage,
Alaska, area with a midnight fireworks display over Alyeska Ski
Resort, following a torchlight parade.
</P>
<P>
   5 a.m. _ Hawaii, the last state to enter 2000, will stage a
smattering of New Year's events, including midnight fireworks
displays and festivals on many islands.

<P>
   If you want to celebrate the arrival of the millennium hour by
hour _ or track the effects of the Y2K computer bug _ here's what
to watch for around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   FRIDAY, DEC. 31
</P>
<P>
   5 a.m. (EST) _ The Year 2000 arrives at the international date
line, the imaginary marker running north and south through the
Pacific Ocean west of Hawaii. A celebration will be held at
Millennium Island in the Republic of Kiribati, the first bit of
land north of Antarctica that will see the sun rise in the new
year.
</P>
<P>
   6 a.m. _ Auckland, New Zealand's largest city, becomes the
world's first metropolitan area to welcome 2000. Computer experts
will be watching closely to see whether the Y2K bug triggers
software failures in this industrialized nation. Midnight will be
marked with a synchronized fireworks display, accompanied by fire
dancers and Pacific island drummers.
</P>
<P>
   8 a.m. _ Sydney, Australia, enters 2000 by staging what it calls
the world's biggest fireworks show. The display above the city's
harbor will be linked to the 2000 Olympics, to be hosted by the
city.
</P>
<P>
   9 a.m. _ The United States gets its first taste of 2000 when
Guam, a U.S. territory, rolls over into the new year.
</P>
<P>
   10 a.m. _ As Tokyo moves into 2000, Y2K worries abound. Business
and political leaders insist that critical software has been fixed,
but many computer experts believe Japan got too late of a start to
conquer the problem. Small- and medium-sized businesses are
considered particularly vulnerable to Y2K bugs.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a crowd is expected to form at a downtown square called
Ebisu Garden Place to welcome midnight in front of a huge countdown
clock.
</P>
<P>
   11 a.m. _ Beijing hasn't shown much interest in celebrating
2000. Computer experts also fear it has shown too little interest
in preparing computers for the date rollover. The government's
secretiveness makes it difficult to assess Y2K readiness in
critical sectors, such as banking and aviation. Global
manufacturers are waiting to see whether suppliers in China have
fixed computers well enough to avoid factory shutdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Noon _ The Y2K bug will roll over into several heavily populated
cities, such as Jakarta and Bangkok. The recovering economies in
many Southeast Asian nations could be seriously damaged by computer
breakdowns. Y2K experts say risks are high because so many
manufacturers in this part of the world use pirated software that
could be filled with bugs.
</P>
<P>
   1 p.m. _ Dhaka, the capital of poverty-plagued Bangladesh, is
not heavily computer-dependent, but Y2K experts say its power
generation system is vulnerable to software bugs.
</P>
<P>
   2 p.m. _ Residents of New Delhi, India, plan to stage carnivals
in the hours leading to up to a midnight fireworks display. In
recent months, India appears to have made big strides in preparing
its computers for the date rollover. No big problems are expected.
</P>
<P>
   3 p.m. _ Oil companies will be watching as the new year reaches
the United Arab Emirates. This oil-exporting country appears to be
well prepared to deal with the Y2K problem.
</P>
<P>
   4 p.m. _ When midnight arrives in Moscow, many fear
computer-related failures in vital services, such as heat and light
generation. The State Department is so concerned about Y2K flaws in
the power grid that it authorized the voluntary departure of
employees and family members at the U.S. Embassy, and urged
Americans to avoid traveling to Moscow. Many fear Russia also will
be plagued by transportation and telecommunication disruptions. In
worst-case scenarios, aging nuclear power plants shut down or
become unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   5 p.m. _ Perhaps the scariest moment on the New Year's Eve
clock. This is the hour when midnight comes to Israel, which will
be teeming with religious pilgrims celebrating the 2,000th
anniversary of the birth of Jesus at Bethlehem. The Palestinian
Authority, which controls Bethlehem, is planning a music festival,
but many fear that Christian fanatics may cause violence in the
hopes of triggering the Apocalypse. Arab terrorists also may be
planning attacks.
</P>
<P>
   In this same hour, midnight will be reaching the Pyramids at
Giza on the outskirts of Cairo in Egypt, where large crowds of
tourists might make attractive targets for terrorists. Y2K experts
say Egyptian hospitals and hotels may experience numerous equipment
failures.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, midnight also will come to Eastern Europe, where a
swarm of Y2K bugs could get unleashed. The State Department has
issued travel warnings for Ukraine, Moldova and Belarus because of
the high risk of prolonged disruptions in heat and electricity.
</P>
<P>
   6 p.m. _ Another dicey hour. In Rome, a half-million people are
expected to accept Pope John Paul II's invitation to celebrate the
beginning of the 3rd millennium of Christianity. The gathering may
be seen by terrorists as a juicy target. Also, Italy is widely
regarded as being among the West's worst-prepared countries for
fending off Y2K bugs.
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, the Eiffel Tower will burst into a massive, pulsating
show of light flashes. A fireworks display will follow. Then the
action shifts to the Champs Elysees, where 23 large Ferris wheels
will turn.
</P>
<P>
   7 p.m. _ The aviation world will be paying close attention to
this hour, which marks midnight in Greenwich, England. Because
aviation operates worldwide on Greenwich Mean Time, this could be
the moment when Y2K bugs turn up in air traffic control systems.
</P>
<P>
   Greenwich is the site of a huge Millennium Dome, built to call
attention to the borough's status as home to the prime meridian, or
0 degrees longitude. The Dome will be inaugurated on New Year's Eve
by Queen Elizabeth II. Large screens in the Dome will show the
ringing of the Big Ben chimes in London at midnight.
</P>
<P>
   8 p.m. _ The midnight hour passes over the Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   9 p.m. _ The new year arrives in this hemisphere in Rio de
Janeiro, Brazil. Celebrations will be centered around the city's
Ipanema and Copacabana beaches, with musical events, fireworks
displays and samba. But amid the partying, computer experts will be
worrying; Brazil is widely seen as being at high risk for
Y2K-related problems, especially in private industry, which uses a
lot of pirated software.
</P>
<P>
   10 p.m. _ Chile rolls over into 2000 amid praise for its efforts
to deal with the Y2K problem.
</P>
<P>
   11 p.m. _ Venezuela enters 2000 in poor shape. Because of recent
floods and political turmoil, the country already is in virtual
chaos. To add to that misery, computers are at high risk, say Y2K
experts. Breakdowns may be likely in power grids, telephones,
customs services, air traffic control, ports and the oil industry.
</P>
<P>
   SATURDAY, JAN. 1
</P>
<P>
   Midnight _ New York plans to hold its largest-ever New Year's
Eve party in Times Square. City officials expect as many as 2
million revelers, about four times the norm.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the nation's monuments and the White House will
become stages or backdrops for events that will culminate with a
massive fireworks display at midnight. Unfortunately, some
terrorism experts believe that both New York and Washington could
be targeted for violence.
</P>
<P>
   1 a.m. _ Navy Pier on Lake Michigan and the Chicago River will
become the backdrop for the Windy City's laser and firework
displays.
</P>
<P>
   2 a.m. Denver is keeping a very low profile. For the first time
in 11 years, the city has canceled its family-oriented First Night
celebration and has planned no public events.
</P>
<P>
   3 a.m. _ Las Vegas will rock. Officials estimate a million
people will crowd the Vegas Strip for the party, which includes a
light show on Fremont Street and countdown clocks on several
hotels. Big events for high rollers will be staged indoors.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles and San Francisco, most public events have been
canceled because of lack of interest. But police are worried that
rowdy street parties may break out.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, a midnight fireworks display is planned for Puget
Sound, but recent riots and worries about foreign terrorism are
expected to keep crowds small.
</P>
<P>
   4 a.m. _ The new year will be welcomed into the Anchorage,
Alaska, area with a midnight fireworks display over Alyeska Ski
Resort, following a torchlight parade.
</P>
<P>
   5 a.m. _ Hawaii, the last state to enter 2000, will stage a
smattering of New Year's events, including midnight fireworks
displays and festivals on many islands.

PHOENIX SUNS' GUGLIOTTA TOOK SUPPLEMENT BEFORE SEIZURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - On the night he suffered a seizure that caused him to
stop breathing, Suns forward Tom Gugliotta ingested a supplement
that has been tied to the collapse of a 16-year-old Peoria, Ariz.,
boy and at least one death, ``The Arizona Republic'' has learned.
</P>
<P>
   The compound, furanone di-hydro, is a legal, over-the-counter
substance marketed as an herbal supplement that is designed to
improve sleep and aid in muscle recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Furanone is one chemical name for gamma butyrolactone. The U.S.
Food and Drug Administration at the beginning of this year asked
companies that manufacture products containing the chemical to
voluntarily recall them.
</P>
<P>
   The supplement is marketed under a variety of brand names and
has been linked to the nearly fatal collapse of the Peoria teen on
Dec. 2.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone conversation with ``The Republic'' on Sunday,
Gugliotta and Dr. Richard Emerson, the Suns' physician, confirmed
that Gugliotta had taken the furanone di-hydro supplement after a
Dec. 17 game in Portland, Ore., before boarding the team's bus.
</P>
<P>
   A short time after getting on the bus, Gugliotta suffered a
seizure. With Gugliotta's permission, Emerson revealed for the
first time Sunday that the 6-foot-10, 30-year-old player stopped
breathing en route to the hospital and in the emergency room there.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said my heart never stopped, but I wasn't breathing,''
Gugliotta added.
</P>
<P>
   Emerson said that the supplement container was found, and that
doctors were able to treat Gugliotta with counteractive drugs,
``which probably saved Tom's life.''
</P>
<P>
   Emerson said the team's medical staff is making no assumptions
that the supplement is the definite cause of the seizure, and
Gugliotta is scheduled to undergo more tests. But Gugliotta's
symptoms are consistent with other reported seizures and collapses
linked to furanone di-hydro products.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Internist) Dr. Craig Phelps, (team nutritionist) Doug Grant
and myself have been doing a lot of research, and while (furanone)
is highly suspect, we can't assume anything,'' Emerson said.
``There is a family history of seizure as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Emerson said the substance is not banned by the NBA, nor does he
believe it will endanger Gugliotta's eligibility for the 2000
Olympics in Sydney, Australia, where he will be a member of the
U.S. Dream Team.
</P>
<P>
   Gugliotta said he wanted to emphasize that he did not get the
supplement from any members of the team's medical, training or
strength staff or from Grant. He said none were aware he was taking
it. And Emerson said no other Phoenix player has used the
supplement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard about it through a friend of mine from high school,''
said Gugliotta, who would not identify the friend and was advised
not to identify the product brand name. ``We were just talking and
I told him I hadn't been sleeping very well.
</P>
<P>
   ``He brought this up. It is supposed to promote terrific sleep
and also help your body recover from extreme activity _ like
playing an NBA basketball game. It sounded pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Emerson said, that often is the case with
unregulated herbal-based supplements that are readily available
over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is being marketed as a safe herbal supplement,'' he said.
``This product is fairly unstable. Even changes in the body's pH,
or even a can of soda can change the chemistry. It can transform to
more unstable products within the body. It's a pretty dangerous
substance.''
</P>
<P>
   Gugliotta said he had no idea when he took the supplement that
it was any more dangerous than other over-the-counter vitamins and
herbal supplements he has taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have any idea something like this could happen,'' he
said. ``I nearly lost my life. You would have to be totally crazy
to take it if you knew beforehand what could happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never worried about going to the store for vitamins over
the counter. I've never heard of anybody getting sick from
something like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Gugliotta said he hopes others, particularly young athletes,
will learn from his mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you read some of the stuff, it sounds like it's a miracle
or something,'' he said. ``After seeing some of the research done
on the medical side, you think the exact opposite. After reading
that, you would want to at least talk to somebody before taking it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping something good can come out of it other than my
recovery. If anybody is even thinking about this stuff, there is no
way the positives _ if there are any _ can outweigh what can
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the brand names the supplement is marketed under are
ReActive, Verve, SomatoPro, Blue Nitro and Regenerize, all of which
are readily available over the Internet. There are restrictions on
its distribution in Texas, California and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has cautioned against the
use of products containing furanone di-hydro. But the FDA regulates
mostly pharmaceuticals and does not approve or disapprove herbal
compounds.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA, however, has documented 55 adverse effects tied to
furanone di-hydro, including a death in Florida and at least 19
individuals who became unconscious or comatose after taking it.
Several of those required intubation to assist breathing, insertion
of a tube into the airway. At least five victims were 18 years old
or younger.
</P>
<P>
   Other reported effects have included seizures, vomiting, severe
headaches, slowed breathing and slowed heart rate.
</P>
<P>
   The 16-year-old Centennial High School student from Peoria
collapsed Dec. 2 during a school gym class after taking Verve _ a
furanone-based product. The student, whose name was withheld by
authorities because he is a minor, lost consciousness and had to be
resuscitated by paramedics.
</P>
<P>
   ``He stopped breathing several times. It was a very scary
situation,'' said Dudley Butts, principal of Centennial High.
</P>
<P>
   ``There should be a lot of outrage that this stuff is on the
market. The FDA hasn't approved it. But it has been approved as an
industrial solvent.''
</P>
<P>
   In the body, furanone di-hydro is rapidly converted into
gamma-hydroxybutyric Acid (GHB), which has been associated at high
levels with several deaths in California since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Gugliotta said he took the recommended dosage of a liquid
furanone product and washed it down with a soft drink before
getting on the bus. It was the second time he had used the product,
and he said there were no adverse effects the first time.
</P>
<P>
   In Portland, he began sweating profusely and his head rolled
back on the bus seat. He was on a cell phone speaking with his
wife, Nikki, when he suffered the seizure.
</P>
<P>
   Teammate Toby Bailey spotted Gugliotta in trouble and alerted
Robin Pound, the club's strength and conditioning coach. Pound sent
Bailey to find the paramedics that are on duty at NBA games, and
Pound tried to keep Gugliotta awake.
</P>
<P>
   The paramedics had not left the arena, nor had Portland's
internist, Dr. Tom Reis. They responded, and Gugliotta was
transported to a hospital just blocks from the Rose Garden arena.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns forward was on a respirator to aid his breathing in the
intensive care unit and was listed in serious condition that night.
He awoke at about 4 a.m. the next day and told ``The Arizona
Republic'' he thought at first he was in his own bed.
</P>
<P>
   Emerson later said that had Gugliotta suffered the seizure while
the team was in flight to Phoenix, he might not have survived it.
There was no equipment aboard the plane to intubate a patient who
could not breathe, and there was no one on the aircraft trained to
perform an intubation.
</P>
<P>
   Promoters of products that contain furanone di-hydro suggest
that the product can stimulate muscle recovery and growth but warn
that it can be dangerous if not taken properly.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to reach manufacturers of the substance on Sunday were
unsuccessful. Promotional material for the various brands of the
supplement are similar and describe a compound that is supposed to
promote a deep sleep. Some furanone products are marketed as sleep
aids. Others also suggest that the products will aid muscle
recovery and growth.
</P>
<P>
   In a deep state of sleep, the promotions say, the body's
pituitary gland is more active in producing human growth hormone
(HGH), which is supposed to aid in muscle recovery and growth.
</P>
<P>
   Heath Brittan, manager of Hi Health World of Nutrition in
Arizona Mills mall in Tempe, Ariz., said the supplement's most
common form, Verve, has made very little impact on the buying
public. Brittan said all the buzz now is about a growth hormone he
calls Zen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had just a handful of people come in to the store the
last six to eight months asking for Verve. We don't stock it for
that reason,'' Brittan said.
</P>
<P>
   Brittan said he had talked to quite a few bodybuilder types at
the gymnasium in which he works out about Verve, the product which
the 16-year-old took and which is a furanone di-hydro product like
the one Gugliotta ingested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those people said that Verve didn't work well for them,''
Brittan said. ``Usually, something that works well hits fast and
spreads like wildfire. But Verve is definitely not one of those
kinds of stimulants.''
</P>
<P>
   Gugliotta said Sunday he finally had gone most of the day
without the recurring headaches he has suffered since the episode.
He hopes to return to the club's lineup soon, when testing is
completed.
</P>
<P>
   Emerson said it is ironic that Gugliotta was caught off guard
because he is one of the most conscientious athletes he has dealt
with when it comes to medications and supplements.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what's bizarre, I guess,'' Gugliotta said. ``I won't
even take Advil painkillers if I can help it because I've heard
they can be bad for your kidneys and liver if you take too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think it was anything more dangerous than a vitamin.
I know it sounds ridiculous now, but that was my mind-set.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Think of Jane Campion movies _ ``Portrait of a Lady,'' ``The
Piano,'' ``An Angel At My Table,'' ``Sweetie'' _ and you think of
dreamlike imagery, resonant symbols and explorations of female
repression and expression that cry out for explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Her latest, ``Holy Smoke,'' has all the ingredients. A willful
young woman (Kate Winslet) travels to India and becomes the devotee
of a guru. Her family fakes a pretext to bring her home to Sydney,
and hires a deprogrammer (Harvey Keitel) to burst the bubble of her
newfound bliss.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of three days in a shack in the Outback, he
breaks her spirit, unnerves her, then seduces her _ only to find
himself in turn broken, deprogrammed and humiliated by her. This
must be the first film in which Harvey Keitel has worn a matching
dress and lipstick.
</P>
<P>
   For a movie about religion, sex, power and obsession, the
surprising thing about ``Holy Smoke'' is that it is both
straightforward and, at least in part, comedic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to make films that are both funny and serious,'' says
Campion over coffee at the Carlyle Hotel in New York. ``That's who
I am as a person.''
</P>
<P>
   She prefers her work to be intuited, rather than explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think,'' she muses. ```Holy Smoke' is meant to be powerful
without the audience understanding where it came from. I like my
films to be gotten in a nonverbal way. The minute you can describe
what you saw, what you felt, the whole thing's over. But I also
think my work is more traditional than people think. I don't really
work with symbols. `The Piano,' I suppose, was somewhat metaphoric.
`Holy Smoke' is what it seems.''
</P>
<P>
   The film began to materialize when Campion and her co-writer
sister, Anna, decided to explore the theme of older men and younger
women _ a Hollywood cliche whose dynamic is rarely explored, or
even questioned. They also wanted to pair a woman of innocence and
conviction with a jaded, alienated man.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put the story in motion to see how it would play out,''
says Campion, in her Down Under lilt that sounds a little like
Brooklyn-meets-London. (She was raised in New Zealand but has lived
most of her life in Australia.) ``We didn't know what would happen.
We just wanted it to be funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, quirky might be a better word to describe Winslet's family
of wackos in the film, which includes plenty of un-p.c. action:
rape, urination, drunk driving, spouses cheating and lying. The
nude scenes between Winslet and Keitel are also a far cry from the
highly aestheticized Hollywood equivalent.
</P>
<P>
   If Campion was taken aback by the decidedly mixed reaction that
greeted her offbeat interpretation of Henry James' ``Portrait of a
Lady'' three years ago, she's ready for anything now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care if anyone likes the film or not, really,'' she
says. ``I've gotten to a place in my life where I care what I
think, and I really like the film. I know some people are going to
hate it. I want them to have room not to like it.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact Campion, whose favorite filmmakers are Luis Bunuel,
Jean-Luc Godard, Stanley Kubrick, Terrence Malick, Neil LaBute and
Quentin Tarantino, professes to love ``flawed'' movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of my favorite films have mistakes in them,'' she says.
``In attempting to stretch the boundaries, they often miss in other
ways. But they're poetic. Look at Bunuel: He's very naughty and
silly. But I find it lovely that a grownup could be so childish,
just for the surreal enjoyment of things. I mean, bugger it! Who
wants to grow up?''
</P>
<P>
   Not her, it seems. Campion has an innocent, girlish air about
her, reflected in her appearance: She has natural, curly blond hair
and wears simple, cozy clothing and no makeup.
</P>
<P>
   When confronted with what appears to be her favorite narrative _
unlikely love that brings with it a surprising spiritual dimension
_ the 45-year-old director just laughs playfully.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think of my movies as romantic fairy tales,'' she says.
``They're about what can happen if you go in there deep enough, and
disaster doesn't strike.''
</P>
<P>
   True to her free-spirited style, she also prefers to work with
small budgets and a big imagination. Besides, she says, money and
competition are still foreign notions to most Australians (Rupert
Murdoch excepted).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very freeing when you figure out that money's not going
to do it for you,'' she says. ``Aussies are natural losers. As long
as you can joke down there, you're all right. If you get too
successful, they'll cut you down.''
</P>
<P>
   The way she sees it, Nicole Kidman thinks the same way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nicole will take whatever project's close to her heart,''
Campion says. ``She thinks more like an independent filmmaker.
She's had a very unconventional career, when you look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kidman, who worked with the director on ``Portrait of a Lady,''
will also be the star of Campion's next project, an adaptation of
Susanna Moore's highly-sexed novel, ``In the Cut,'' which she will
shoot in New York next spring. It's another unlikely love story, in
which a writing professor gets involved with a detective who may be
a murderer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm attracted to narrative _ and mystery,'' Campion says with
a smile. ``I like a good haunting.''
</P>
<P>
   By that, she doesn't mean ``Scream 3,'' but stories and films
that reverberate emotionally and stay with the audience, simmering
in their consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want films to end in a tidy way. I love
mysteriousness. And you can't fake that.''
</P>
<P>
   In her own life, she says she's not mysterious at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very honest,'' she declares, sounding apologetic. ``I
don't pretend with anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Which may explain why she feels that despite her successes _
from motherhood (she has a 5-year-old daughter, Alice) to
conquering indie films (she's still living off the profits from
``The Piano'') to working with major stars (Malkovich, Kidman,
Keitel) _ she is burdened with one weakness: ``I still don't think
I understand how to love,'' she says, alluding to her recent split
from husband Colin Englert, who often worked as her second-unit
director.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are good at it. I'm in awe of them. They don't
overthink the area. They seem to understand how to just be with
people.''

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Think of Jane Campion movies _ ``Portrait of a Lady,'' ``The
Piano,'' ``An Angel At My Table,'' ``Sweetie'' _ and you think of
dreamlike imagery, resonant symbols and explorations of female
repression and expression that cry out for explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Her latest, ``Holy Smoke,'' has all the ingredients. A willful
young woman (Kate Winslet) travels to India and becomes the devotee
of a guru. Her family fakes a pretext to bring her home to Sydney,
and hires a deprogrammer (Harvey Keitel) to burst the bubble of her
newfound bliss.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of three days in a shack in the Outback, he
breaks her spirit, unnerves her, then seduces her _ only to find
himself in turn broken, deprogrammed and humiliated by her. This
must be the first film in which Harvey Keitel has worn a matching
dress and lipstick.
</P>
<P>
   For a movie about religion, sex, power and obsession, the
surprising thing about ``Holy Smoke'' is that it is both
straightforward and, at least in part, comedic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to make films that are both funny and serious,'' says
Campion over coffee at the Carlyle Hotel in New York. ``That's who
I am as a person.''
</P>
<P>
   She prefers her work to be intuited, rather than explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think,'' she muses. ```Holy Smoke' is meant to be powerful
without the audience understanding where it came from. I like my
films to be gotten in a nonverbal way. The minute you can describe
what you saw, what you felt, the whole thing's over. But I also
think my work is more traditional than people think. I don't really
work with symbols. `The Piano,' I suppose, was somewhat metaphoric.
`Holy Smoke' is what it seems.''
</P>
<P>
   The film began to materialize when Campion and her co-writer
sister, Anna, decided to explore the theme of older men and younger
women _ a Hollywood cliche whose dynamic is rarely explored, or
even questioned. They also wanted to pair a woman of innocence and
conviction with a jaded, alienated man.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put the story in motion to see how it would play out,''
says Campion, in her Down Under lilt that sounds a little like
Brooklyn-meets-London. (She was raised in New Zealand but has lived
most of her life in Australia.) ``We didn't know what would happen.
We just wanted it to be funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, quirky might be a better word to describe Winslet's family
of wackos in the film, which includes plenty of un-p.c. action:
rape, urination, drunk driving, spouses cheating and lying. The
nude scenes between Winslet and Keitel are also a far cry from the
highly aestheticized Hollywood equivalent.
</P>
<P>
   If Campion was taken aback by the decidedly mixed reaction that
greeted her offbeat interpretation of Henry James' ``Portrait of a
Lady'' three years ago, she's ready for anything now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care if anyone likes the film or not, really,'' she
says. ``I've gotten to a place in my life where I care what I
think, and I really like the film. I know some people are going to
hate it. I want them to have room not to like it.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact Campion, whose favorite filmmakers are Luis Bunuel,
Jean-Luc Godard, Stanley Kubrick, Terrence Malick, Neil LaBute and
Quentin Tarantino, professes to love ``flawed'' movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of my favorite films have mistakes in them,'' she says.
``In attempting to stretch the boundaries, they often miss in other
ways. But they're poetic. Look at Bunuel: He's very naughty and
silly. But I find it lovely that a grownup could be so childish,
just for the surreal enjoyment of things. I mean, bugger it! Who
wants to grow up?''
</P>
<P>
   Not her, it seems. Campion has an innocent, girlish air about
her, reflected in her appearance: She has natural, curly blond hair
and wears simple, cozy clothing and no makeup.
</P>
<P>
   When confronted with what appears to be her favorite narrative _
unlikely love that brings with it a surprising spiritual dimension
_ the 45-year-old director just laughs playfully.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think of my movies as romantic fairy tales,'' she says.
``They're about what can happen if you go in there deep enough, and
disaster doesn't strike.''
</P>
<P>
   True to her free-spirited style, she also prefers to work with
small budgets and a big imagination. Besides, she says, money and
competition are still foreign notions to most Australians (Rupert
Murdoch excepted).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very freeing when you figure out that money's not going
to do it for you,'' she says. ``Aussies are natural losers. As long
as you can joke down there, you're all right. If you get too
successful, they'll cut you down.''
</P>
<P>
   The way she sees it, Nicole Kidman thinks the same way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nicole will take whatever project's close to her heart,''
Campion says. ``She thinks more like an independent filmmaker.
She's had a very unconventional career, when you look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kidman, who worked with the director on ``Portrait of a Lady,''
will also be the star of Campion's next project, an adaptation of
Susanna Moore's highly-sexed novel, ``In the Cut,'' which she will
shoot in New York next spring. It's another unlikely love story, in
which a writing professor gets involved with a detective who may be
a murderer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm attracted to narrative _ and mystery,'' Campion says with
a smile. ``I like a good haunting.''
</P>
<P>
   By that, she doesn't mean ``Scream 3,'' but stories and films
that reverberate emotionally and stay with the audience, simmering
in their consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want films to end in a tidy way. I love
mysteriousness. And you can't fake that.''
</P>
<P>
   In her own life, she says she's not mysterious at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very honest,'' she declares, sounding apologetic. ``I
don't pretend with anybody.''
</P>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Wear-testing has become more democratic.
</P>
<P>
   Once restricted to top athletes, wear-testing has now spread to
include a vast range of participants. Nike, Adidas, RLX Polo Sport
and Brooks Sports will still provide free apparel and sneakers for
their sponsored athletes to test-drive, but these days, they are
more interested in having everyday athletes assess products.
</P>
<P>
   Their initiatives include:
</P>
<P>
   A testing room at Nike's corporate offices that will replicate
rain and other harsh weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Merchandise by Adidas and FilaGuests is provided to guests at
Women's Quest, fitness retreats held in Colorado and Vermont six
times a year, in return for feedback.
</P>
<P>
   Retail advisory councils set up by RLX Polo Sport and Brooks
Sports so buyers may test out their activewear.
</P>
<P>
   Nike feels it is putting science into what can be a haphazard
process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often wear-testing is an oversimplified subject even though it
is very complex,'' said Jamie Bainbridge, director of Nike's Alpha
apparel. ``A lot of companies give a lot of product to people and
say, `What do you think about it?' If you talk to anyone in
science, they will point out a million reasons why the test went a
certain way. Wear-testing under a controlled environment is a
science.''
</P>
<P>
   Within the next year or two, Nike plans to build an
environmental chamber that duplicates various weather conditions at
its new sports research lab, which opened last month at the
company's headquarters in Beaverton, Ore. Nike will use the
12,200-square-foot facility, an area twice as large as the current
onsite location, for wear-testing.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers' interest in more technical fabrics calls for more
extensive wear-testing and more specific feedback, Bainbridge said.
Given that, companies need to know more than whether a garment is
warm enough or comes in an appealing color, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Nike is teaching its more knowledgeable wear-testers how to rate
a garment's breathability, moisture management and other special
features. Despite having a stable of professional athletes who
endorse its brand, Nike does not get its ``best information'' from
them, since they tend ``to block out extraneous information'' that
everyday athletes might notice, such as ``noisy'' fabrics, she
said. The company is relying more on college students and
recreational athletes for wear-testing.
</P>
<P>
   For spring 2001, Nike aims to wear-test all of its
performance-oriented products instead of the current 60 percent,
Bainbridge said. To accomplish that, it will use more domestic
contractors to develop samples. About 55 percent of Nike apparel
sold in the United States is made overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Adidas is sending its wear-testing to camp.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a sponsorship deal with Women's Quest, Adidas
provides products, asks participants to keep journals to highlight
recommendations and sends key executives to gather firsthand
information. People, they say, tend to be more forthcoming about
product right after using it for hiking, yoga or a trail run.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to hang out with consumers in this type of
environment. For one, they are honest,'' said Kathy Mitchell,
category manager for running for Adidas, during a camp in October
in Winter Park, Colo. ``Our involvement is not just asking them
about the product. We ask them what brands mean to them and what
inspires them to buy something.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of phoning or e-mailing wear-testers, as is the case
with many activewear makers, Adidas executives often pick up
unsolicited feedback during actual activities such as hiking. They
elaborate on topics raised earlier or talk about advertising,
Mitchell said. The camps put Adidas in touch with women who might
not necessarily buy the brand or be familiar with it, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Colleen Cannon, a former world-class triathlete who operates
Women's Quest, and her 15-member staff, which includes several
elite athletes, also test products for Adidas.
</P>
<P>
   On another front, last month the Adidas design and development
team compiled the results of an 18-month research project about
running _ its first major study of a specific sport. Designed to
determine how Adidas merchandise stood up to runners' expectations
and performance needs, the $15,000 project involved 200 people,
said Gretchen Garside, a researcher at the company's human
performance lab. Less than 8 percent of the participants said
appearance mattered when selecting new products, she noted. They
were more concerned about a garment's fit and fabrics.
</P>
<P>
   Running is a top initiative for the company, partly because
148,000 women completed marathons last year _ a 55 percent increase
over 1997, Mitchell said. Adidas plans to do similar research
projects for other sports next year.
</P>
<P>
   Fila also participates in Women's Quest, providing 100 apparel
items for each of the camps. Wear-testers complete questionnaires
about their activewear preferences, said Sally Pfaeffle, business
unit manager for women's. Fila executives attend some camps to talk
to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   On another front, Fila still relies on a handful of female pro
athletes who endorse the brand to evaluate it after practice and
competition.
</P>
<P>
   RLX Polo Sport, a label that has been well received at retail
for its technical features, uses about 1,200 professional and
amateur athletes to wear-test its product. Earlier this year, it
signed a marketing partnership deal with the Aspen Ski School to
outfit its 1,100 instructors.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we say our athletes are designers, that is an accurate
statement. It takes the product to a whole different level,'' said
Jordan Wand, vice president of RLX Polo Sport. ``An item doesn't
make it in the line unless five athletes try the product for a
minimum of three weeks under varying conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Athletes are asked their impressions, even before trying on the
products.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you buy the item?'' and ``What would you be willing to
pay for it?'' are among the preliminary questions, Wand said.
</P>
<P>
   The second phase of wear-testing involves evaluating fit,
comfort level, style and special functional features, as well as
waterproofness, breathability and moisture management. Athletes
record the length of use and weather conditions, durability after
washing and additional apparel worn. Many RLX garments are modified
several times after the initial approval into the line, Wand said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can test fabrics countless times in a lab and put it on
fit models for hours on end. But until you get an athlete to use
it, you won't find out its features,'' Wand said.
</P>
<P>
   RLX recently set up a retail advisory board and will hold
quarterly meetings to discuss product development. Outdoor
adventure, cycling and snowboarding are a few of the subjects to be
discussed. Board members will also wear-test goods. The brand is
considering inviting them to resorts in Telluride, Colo., or Santa
Cruz, Calif., to do just that, Wand said.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks Sports, a Botthel, Wash., company that caters to runners,
now meets with at least one of its five key specialty stores for
wear-testing and evaluating new products on a monthly basis. Unlike
many buyers at major chains, specialty store owners tend to be
passionate about their particular sports and are right in tune with
fashion trends, said Mick Whitaker, vice president of apparel.
Those accounts have carried Brooks for at least 10 years and are
considered directional, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Retailers have a vested interest in helping develop the
product. They are the best source of information and they reach
consumers,'' Whitaker said. ``Too many times, sponsored athletes
have other issues to deal with, like training and race
preparation.''
</P>
<P>
   The company also counts on its own 70 employees for
wear-testing. Seventy percent of them are recreational runners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't focus on world-class athletes because our customer
isn't that. They have different needs,'' Whitaker said. ``Our
customers are out for longer periods of time, and they're running
slower. They don't relate to setting American records.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most companies, Burton remains committed to having its
sponsored athletes get ``heavily'' involved with the brand's
wear-testing and product development, said Olympic snowboarder
Shannon Dunn, a Burton-sponsored athlete.
</P>
<P>
   After wear-testing Burton's 2001 apparel during a catalog shoot
in Chile in October, Dunn and other riders returned to the
company's headquarters in Burlington, Vt., to evaluate the
collection item by item. Burton identifies its rider development
team in the company's retail catalog, which includes photos of
junior riders, less-established young snowboarders who also
wear-test the product.
</P>
<P>
   After helping with the line, Dunn said she likes to check out
what stores purchase. She plans to do just that when making
appearances this winter at athletic specialty stores and sporting
goods stores. In October, while at Paragon Sporting Goods, a
mammoth specialty store here at 867 Broadway, Dunn pointed out her
favorite jacket, a hooded three-color down style from Burton.
</P>
<P>
   She slept in one of those jackets while staying in an unheated
room that looked like ``an old army barracks'' in New Zealand
during a photo shoot last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were staying in Erehwon, which is `nowhere' spelled
backwards. So you can imagine how cold it was,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, Burton prefers to have its riders wearing the apparel
on mountains. After just a few runs, Dunn said she knows whether
the sample will hold up in the snow.
</P>
<P>
   ``If something doesn't feel good while we're moving, it doesn't
make it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most pro athletes, Dunn, who cofounded Prom and Tuesday,
two other snowboard lines, before signing with Burton, enjoys
offering her input.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does create more work, but it's fun. It gives you a sense
of ownership,'' she said. ``I take more pride in something knowing
that I worked on it.''

outfit its 1,100 instructors.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we say our athletes are designers, that is an accurate
statement. It takes the product to a whole different level,'' said
Jordan Wand, vice president of RLX Polo Sport. ``An item doesn't
make it in the line unless five athletes try the product for a
minimum of three weeks under varying conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Athletes are asked their impressions, even before trying on the
products.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you buy the item?'' and ``What would you be willing to
pay for it?'' are among the preliminary questions, Wand said.
</P>
<P>
   The second phase of wear-testing involves evaluating fit,
comfort level, style and special functional features, as well as
waterproofness, breathability and moisture management. Athletes
record the length of use and weather conditions, durability after
washing and additional apparel worn. Many RLX garments are modified
several times after the initial approval into the line, Wand said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can test fabrics countless times in a lab and put it on
fit models for hours on end. But until you get an athlete to use
it, you won't find out its features,'' Wand said.
</P>
<P>
   RLX recently set up a retail advisory board and will hold
quarterly meetings to discuss product development. Outdoor
adventure, cycling and snowboarding are a few of the subjects to be
discussed. Board members will also wear-test goods. The brand is
considering inviting them to resorts in Telluride, Colo., or Santa
Cruz, Calif., to do just that, Wand said.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks Sports, a Botthel, Wash., company that caters to runners,
now meets with at least one of its five key specialty stores for
wear-testing and evaluating new products on a monthly basis. Unlike
many buyers at major chains, specialty store owners tend to be
passionate about their particular sports and are right in tune with
fashion trends, said Mick Whitaker, vice president of apparel.
Those accounts have carried Brooks for at least 10 years and are
considered directional, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Retailers have a vested interest in helping develop the
product. They are the best source of information and they reach
consumers,'' Whitaker said. ``Too many times, sponsored athletes
have other issues to deal with, like training and race
preparation.''
</P>
<P>
   The company also counts on its own 70 employees for
wear-testing. Seventy percent of them are recreational runners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't focus on world-class athletes because our customer
isn't that. They have different needs,'' Whitaker said. ``Our
customers are out for longer periods of time, and they're running
slower. They don't relate to setting American records.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most companies, Burton remains committed to having its
sponsored athletes get ``heavily'' involved with the brand's
wear-testing and product development, said Olympic snowboarder
Shannon Dunn, a Burton-sponsored athlete.
</P>
<P>
   After wear-testing Burton's 2001 apparel during a catalog shoot
in Chile in October, Dunn and other riders returned to the
company's headquarters in Burlington, Vt., to evaluate the
collection item by item. Burton identifies its rider development
team in the company's retail catalog, which includes photos of
junior riders, less-established young snowboarders who also
wear-test the product.
</P>
<P>
   After helping with the line, Dunn said she likes to check out
what stores purchase. She plans to do just that when making
appearances this winter at athletic specialty stores and sporting
goods stores. In October, while at Paragon Sporting Goods, a
mammoth specialty store here at 867 Broadway, Dunn pointed out her
favorite jacket, a hooded three-color down style from Burton.
</P>
<P>
   She slept in one of those jackets while staying in an unheated
room that looked like ``an old army barracks'' in New Zealand
during a photo shoot last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were staying in Erehwon, which is `nowhere' spelled
backwards. So you can imagine how cold it was,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, Burton prefers to have its riders wearing the apparel
on mountains. After just a few runs, Dunn said she knows whether
the sample will hold up in the snow.
</P>
<P>
   ``If something doesn't feel good while we're moving, it doesn't
make it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most pro athletes, Dunn, who cofounded Prom and Tuesday,
two other snowboard lines, before signing with Burton, enjoys
offering her input.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does create more work, but it's fun. It gives you a sense
of ownership,'' she said. ``I take more pride in something knowing
that I worked on it.''

PHOENIX SUNS' GUGLIOTTA TOOK SUPPLEMENT BEFORE SEIZURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - On the night he suffered a seizure that caused him to
stop breathing, Suns forward Tom Gugliotta ingested a supplement
that has been tied to the collapse of a 16-year-old Peoria, Ariz.,
boy and at least one death, ``The Arizona Republic'' has learned.
</P>
<P>
   The compound, furanone di-hydro, is a legal, over-the-counter
substance marketed as an herbal supplement that is designed to
improve sleep and aid in muscle recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Furanone is one chemical name for gamma butyrolactone. The U.S.
Food and Drug Administration at the beginning of this year asked
companies that manufacture products containing the chemical to
voluntarily recall them.
</P>
<P>
   The supplement is marketed under a variety of brand names and
has been linked to the nearly fatal collapse of the Peoria teen on
Dec. 2.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone conversation with ``The Republic'' on Sunday,
Gugliotta and Dr. Richard Emerson, the Suns' physician, confirmed
that Gugliotta had taken the furanone di-hydro supplement after a
Dec. 17 game in Portland, Ore., before boarding the team's bus.
</P>
<P>
   A short time after getting on the bus, Gugliotta suffered a
seizure. With Gugliotta's permission, Emerson revealed for the
first time Sunday that the 6-foot-10, 30-year-old player stopped
breathing en route to the hospital and in the emergency room there.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said my heart never stopped, but I wasn't breathing,''
Gugliotta added.
</P>
<P>
   Emerson said that the supplement container was found, and that
doctors were able to treat Gugliotta with counteractive drugs,
``which probably saved Tom's life.''
</P>
<P>
   Emerson said the team's medical staff is making no assumptions
that the supplement is the definite cause of the seizure, and
Gugliotta is scheduled to undergo more tests. But Gugliotta's
symptoms are consistent with other reported seizures and collapses
linked to furanone di-hydro products.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Internist) Dr. Craig Phelps, (team nutritionist) Doug Grant
and myself have been doing a lot of research, and while (furanone)
is highly suspect, we can't assume anything,'' Emerson said.
``There is a family history of seizure as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Emerson said the substance is not banned by the NBA, nor does he
believe it will endanger Gugliotta's eligibility for the 2000
Olympics in Sydney, Australia, where he will be a member of the
U.S. Dream Team.
</P>
<P>
   Gugliotta said he wanted to emphasize that he did not get the
supplement from any members of the team's medical, training or
strength staff or from Grant. He said none were aware he was taking
it. And Emerson said no other Phoenix player has used the
supplement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard about it through a friend of mine from high school,''
said Gugliotta, who would not identify the friend and was advised
not to identify the product brand name. ``We were just talking and
I told him I hadn't been sleeping very well.
</P>
<P>
   ``He brought this up. It is supposed to promote terrific sleep
and also help your body recover from extreme activity _ like
playing an NBA basketball game. It sounded pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Emerson said, that often is the case with
unregulated herbal-based supplements that are readily available
over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is being marketed as a safe herbal supplement,'' he said.
``This product is fairly unstable. Even changes in the body's pH,
or even a can of soda can change the chemistry. It can transform to
more unstable products within the body. It's a pretty dangerous
substance.''
</P>
<P>
   Gugliotta said he had no idea when he took the supplement that
it was any more dangerous than other over-the-counter vitamins and
herbal supplements he has taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have any idea something like this could happen,'' he
said. ``I nearly lost my life. You would have to be totally crazy
to take it if you knew beforehand what could happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never worried about going to the store for vitamins over
the counter. I've never heard of anybody getting sick from
something like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Gugliotta said he hopes others, particularly young athletes,
will learn from his mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you read some of the stuff, it sounds like it's a miracle
or something,'' he said. ``After seeing some of the research done
on the medical side, you think the exact opposite. After reading
that, you would want to at least talk to somebody before taking it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping something good can come out of it other than my
recovery. If anybody is even thinking about this stuff, there is no
way the positives _ if there are any _ can outweigh what can
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the brand names the supplement is marketed under are
ReActive, Verve, SomatoPro, Blue Nitro and Regenerize, all of which
are readily available over the Internet. There are restrictions on
its distribution in Texas, California and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has cautioned against the
use of products containing furanone di-hydro. But the FDA regulates
mostly pharmaceuticals and does not approve or disapprove herbal
compounds.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA, however, has documented 55 adverse effects tied to
furanone di-hydro, including a death in Florida and at least 19
individuals who became unconscious or comatose after taking it.
Several of those required intubation to assist breathing, insertion
of a tube into the airway. At least five victims were 18 years old
or younger.
</P>
<P>
   Other reported effects have included seizures, vomiting, severe
headaches, slowed breathing and slowed heart rate.
</P>
<P>
   The 16-year-old Centennial High School student from Peoria
collapsed Dec. 2 during a school gym class after taking Verve _ a
furanone-based product. The student, whose name was withheld by
authorities because he is a minor, lost consciousness and had to be
resuscitated by paramedics.
</P>
<P>
   ``He stopped breathing several times. It was a very scary
situation,'' said Dudley Butts, principal of Centennial High.
</P>
<P>
   ``There should be a lot of outrage that this stuff is on the
market. The FDA hasn't approved it. But it has been approved as an
industrial solvent.''
</P>
<P>
   In the body, furanone di-hydro is rapidly converted into
gamma-hydroxybutyric Acid (GHB), which has been associated at high
levels with several deaths in California since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Gugliotta said he took the recommended dosage of a liquid
furanone product and washed it down with a soft drink before
getting on the bus. It was the second time he had used the product,
and he said there were no adverse effects the first time.
</P>
<P>
   In Portland, he began sweating profusely and his head rolled
back on the bus seat. He was on a cell phone speaking with his
wife, Nikki, when he suffered the seizure.
</P>
<P>
   Teammate Toby Bailey spotted Gugliotta in trouble and alerted
Robin Pound, the club's strength and conditioning coach. Pound sent
Bailey to find the paramedics that are on duty at NBA games, and
Pound tried to keep Gugliotta awake.
</P>
<P>
   The paramedics had not left the arena, nor had Portland's
internist, Dr. Tom Reis. They responded, and Gugliotta was
transported to a hospital just blocks from the Rose Garden arena.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns forward was on a respirator to aid his breathing in the
intensive care unit and was listed in serious condition that night.
He awoke at about 4 a.m. the next day and told ``The Arizona
Republic'' he thought at first he was in his own bed.
</P>
<P>
   Emerson later said that had Gugliotta suffered the seizure while
the team was in flight to Phoenix, he might not have survived it.
There was no equipment aboard the plane to intubate a patient who
could not breathe, and there was no one on the aircraft trained to
perform an intubation.
</P>
<P>
   Promoters of products that contain furanone di-hydro suggest
that the product can stimulate muscle recovery and growth but warn
that it can be dangerous if not taken properly.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to reach manufacturers of the substance on Sunday were
unsuccessful. Promotional material for the various brands of the
supplement are similar and describe a compound that is supposed to
promote a deep sleep. Some furanone products are marketed as sleep
aids. Others also suggest that the products will aid muscle
recovery and growth.
</P>
<P>
   In a deep state of sleep, the promotions say, the body's
pituitary gland is more active in producing human growth hormone
(HGH), which is supposed to aid in muscle recovery and growth.
</P>
<P>
   Heath Brittan, manager of Hi Health World of Nutrition in
Arizona Mills mall in Tempe, Ariz., said the supplement's most
common form, Verve, has made very little impact on the buying
public. Brittan said all the buzz now is about a growth hormone he
calls Zen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had just a handful of people come in to the store the
last six to eight months asking for Verve. We don't stock it for
that reason,'' Brittan said.
</P>
<P>
   Brittan said he had talked to quite a few bodybuilder types at
the gymnasium in which he works out about Verve, the product which
the 16-year-old took and which is a furanone di-hydro product like
the one Gugliotta ingested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those people said that Verve didn't work well for them,''
Brittan said. ``Usually, something that works well hits fast and
spreads like wildfire. But Verve is definitely not one of those
kinds of stimulants.''
</P>
<P>
   Gugliotta said Sunday he finally had gone most of the day
without the recurring headaches he has suffered since the episode.
He hopes to return to the club's lineup soon, when testing is
completed.
</P>
<P>
   Emerson said it is ironic that Gugliotta was caught off guard
because he is one of the most conscientious athletes he has dealt
with when it comes to medications and supplements.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what's bizarre, I guess,'' Gugliotta said. ``I won't
even take Advil painkillers if I can help it because I've heard
they can be bad for your kidneys and liver if you take too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think it was anything more dangerous than a vitamin.
I know it sounds ridiculous now, but that was my mind-set.'' &QL;

   &UR; BULLET WITH A NAME ON IT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many robberies and homicides go unsolved because there is no way
to trace a bullet found at the crime scene back to a specific gun
and, ultimately, to the person who fired it. So Todd Lizotte, head
of development at NanoVia, has devised a technology to do just
that.
</P>
<P>
   Lizotte, a handgun enthusiast, spent years working with lasers
to shape machine parts. Then he realized that the same process
could enable a gun to emboss bullet casings with a unique symbol.
</P>
<P>
   As a test, he laser-etched a half-millimeter-wide pattern into
the tip of a gun's firing pin. When the gun is fired, the pin slams
into the casing of a bullet, leaving a tiny stamp.
</P>
<P>
   Such a mark could indicate a gun's serial number, which is
already recorded when someone buys it. Casings left behind at a
crime scene would thus contain a signature of the gun from which
they were shot.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, ballistics experts can match casings with their guns
only if the weapon has been recovered. A serial number, in
contrast, would provide an instant ID.
</P>
<P>
   Lizotte is getting feedback from law-enforcement personnel and
</P>
<P>
   from a committee at the United Nations, which is looking for
ways to track arms from peacekeeping missions that find their way
onto the black market.
</P>
<P>
   Gunmakers, however, are reluctant to embrace an idea that makes
gun ownership less private.
</P>
<P>
   ``No company wants to be the first,'' Lizotte says. ``I plan to
approach politicians about introducing tax breaks to manufacturers
who implement it.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ROBOT WATCH: CLAWBOT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bridge inspectors will be able to abandon their precarious ropes
and scaffolding when they work with ROMA.
</P>
<P>
   This climbing robot, built by Carlos Balaguer, Mohamed
Abderrahim and their fellow engineers at the Carlos III University
of Madrid, nimbly navigates steel I-beams on bridges and sends back
video to a human sitting safely on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ROMA has two arms with pincerlike grippers. The robot can turn
</P>
<P>
   corners by pivoting its whole body on its wrist, or flip one arm
up sideways to grab a column and clamber upward.
</P>
<P>
   A built-in map of the structure, along with laser and camera
sensors, makes sure every step is secure.
</P>
<P>
   Future versions of ROMA will be able to automatically find and
report cracks or corrosion, and stay on the bridge for long periods
of time.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A CHAMPION OF CHIMPS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The line between chimps and humans is looking blurry these days.
First we thought that only humans use tools. Then we learned that
chimps do too.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, primatologists found that chimps, like humans,
have distinctive cultural habits that vary from group to group.
</P>
<P>
   Frans de Waal has spent years studying the complexities of chimp
behavior as director of Yerkes' Living Links Center at Emory
</P>
<P>
   University in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  What's the significance of the discovery of chimp culture?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  There's a long tradition in Western thought that humans are
not shackled by biology, whereas animals are pure instinct
machines. The chimpanzee story is telling us that animals may be a
lot closer to us in this regard than we think.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  So what does separate us from chimps or other animals?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  Chimps don't have language. Humans actively instruct others
about how things should be done. Chimpanzees probably pick up
cultural traditions by observation.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  Can chimpanzees create art?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  There are beautiful examples of art done by chimpanzees in
human care. Chimps also have a rain dance: They react to thunderous
noises of rainfall by swaying around rhythmically, their hair
standing on end. Some people have called this dance a superstition,
in that the animals may think that they can stop the rain.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  Are we doing enough to protect wild chimpanzees?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  The conservation situation is the worst it's been in a long
time. In Borneo there have been big fires; in Uganda there are
rebels who threaten chimp researchers. In Africa the biggest threat
of all is the bush meat trade. People are shooting apes, snaring
them, hacking them to death and eating them.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  Would you want to live in a chimp society?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  I'd prefer to live with humans. I think humans are marvels
of conflict resolution and cooperation. Look at New York City,
which has more than 7 million people living crowded together. I
don't think you could put 7 million chimpanzees in a city and have
anything decent going on.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TITAN'S SECRET SEAS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Are astronomers looking for life in all the wrong places?
</P>
<P>
   Although Mars hogs a lot of headlines, scientists have been
building a case that Saturn's giant moon Titan is covered with
oceans of organic chemicals, evidence of complex chemistry similar
to what occurred on the young Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Titan's atmosphere and dense smog have kept scientists guessing
about what is going on below. Astrophysicist Claire Max of Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory recently used the giant Keck I
telescope in Hawaii to examine Titan in infrared light, which can
pierce the global haze.
</P>
<P>
   She and her colleagues then took a series of high-speed
snapshots to freeze the blurring caused by atmospheric turbulence,
and combined them into a single, sharp image. The new picture shows
Titan seemingly divided into bright continents and dark oceans.
</P>
<P>
   Titan's seas probably consist of methane or ethane mixed with
more complex organic molecules-liquid natural gas combined with
tar, basically.
</P>
<P>
   The Cassini spacecraft, now bound for Saturn, will drop a probe
through Titan's clouds in 2004 for a firsthand look. Meanwhile, Max
plans to use the Keck telescope to make a crude map of Titan's
composition.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a probe, you get lots and lots of data about just one
place,'' Max says. ``We hope to survey the entire surface.

   &UR; ROBOT WATCH: CLAWBOT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bridge inspectors will be able to abandon their precarious ropes
and scaffolding when they work with ROMA.
</P>
<P>
   This climbing robot, built by Carlos Balaguer, Mohamed
Abderrahim and their fellow engineers at the Carlos III University
of Madrid, nimbly navigates steel I-beams on bridges and sends back
video to a human sitting safely on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ROMA has two arms with pincerlike grippers. The robot can turn
</P>
<P>
   corners by pivoting its whole body on its wrist, or flip one arm
up sideways to grab a column and clamber upward.
</P>
<P>
   A built-in map of the structure, along with laser and camera
sensors, makes sure every step is secure.
</P>
<P>
   Future versions of ROMA will be able to automatically find and
report cracks or corrosion, and stay on the bridge for long periods
of time.

<P>
   &UR; A CHAMPION OF CHIMPS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The line between chimps and humans is looking blurry these days.
First we thought that only humans use tools. Then we learned that
chimps do too.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, primatologists found that chimps, like humans,
have distinctive cultural habits that vary from group to group.
</P>
<P>
   Frans de Waal has spent years studying the complexities of chimp
behavior as director of Yerkes' Living Links Center at Emory
</P>
<P>
   University in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  What's the significance of the discovery of chimp culture?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  There's a long tradition in Western thought that humans are
not shackled by biology, whereas animals are pure instinct
machines. The chimpanzee story is telling us that animals may be a
lot closer to us in this regard than we think.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  So what does separate us from chimps or other animals?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  Chimps don't have language. Humans actively instruct others
about how things should be done. Chimpanzees probably pick up
cultural traditions by observation.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  Can chimpanzees create art?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  There are beautiful examples of art done by chimpanzees in
human care. Chimps also have a rain dance: They react to thunderous
noises of rainfall by swaying around rhythmically, their hair
standing on end. Some people have called this dance a superstition,
in that the animals may think that they can stop the rain.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  Are we doing enough to protect wild chimpanzees?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  The conservation situation is the worst it's been in a long
time. In Borneo there have been big fires; in Uganda there are
rebels who threaten chimp researchers. In Africa the biggest threat
of all is the bush meat trade. People are shooting apes, snaring
them, hacking them to death and eating them.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  Would you want to live in a chimp society?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  I'd prefer to live with humans. I think humans are marvels
of conflict resolution and cooperation. Look at New York City,
which has more than 7 million people living crowded together. I
don't think you could put 7 million chimpanzees in a city and have
anything decent going on.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TITAN'S SECRET SEAS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Are astronomers looking for life in all the wrong places?
</P>
<P>
   Although Mars hogs a lot of headlines, scientists have been
building a case that Saturn's giant moon Titan is covered with
oceans of organic chemicals, evidence of complex chemistry similar
to what occurred on the young Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Titan's atmosphere and dense smog have kept scientists guessing
about what is going on below. Astrophysicist Claire Max of Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory recently used the giant Keck I
telescope in Hawaii to examine Titan in infrared light, which can
pierce the global haze.
</P>
<P>
   She and her colleagues then took a series of high-speed
snapshots to freeze the blurring caused by atmospheric turbulence,
and combined them into a single, sharp image. The new picture shows
Titan seemingly divided into bright continents and dark oceans.
</P>
<P>
   Titan's seas probably consist of methane or ethane mixed with
more complex organic molecules-liquid natural gas combined with
tar, basically.
</P>
<P>
   The Cassini spacecraft, now bound for Saturn, will drop a probe
through Titan's clouds in 2004 for a firsthand look. Meanwhile, Max
plans to use the Keck telescope to make a crude map of Titan's
composition.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a probe, you get lots and lots of data about just one
place,'' Max says. ``We hope to survey the entire surface.

<P>
   Not many ships venture into the Drake Passage, 500 miles of
water between the fjords of southern Chile and the tip of the
Antarctic Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing but icy-cold ocean. Here, a ship can expect to
run into waves that are sometimes five stories high. Sailing crews
consider these the most treacherous seas on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   This afternoon, near-hurricane force winds slam growing swells
into the research vessel Nathaniel B. Palmer. Scientists below deck
scurry to lash down computer terminals.
</P>
<P>
   Off the starboard side, hulking waves line up to take a swing at
the ship.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of science justifies the risk of men and women swept
overboard and a $50 million ship lost at sea?
</P>
<P>
   In short, the future of our planet.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate goal of this trip: to gather clues about global
warming. The more immediate goal concerns a regional warming trend
in Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows exactly what this trend means for the rest of the
world, but the western side of the Antarctic Peninsula is warming
up faster than anywhere on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Comparisons of climate records from just a half-century ago show
that temperatures here have risen, on average, 2.5 to 3 degrees
Celsius.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody expected it to happen this fast,'' says glaciologist
Ted Scambos of the University of Colorado at Boulder.
</P>
<P>
   Although most scientists agree that global warming is upon us,
no one yet knows how much of it _ if any _ could be due to a
recurring natural temperature cycle.
</P>
<P>
   The answer lies in the ancient past. To find it, one must look
at what was happening with temperatures thousands of years ago. One
way to do that is to study long-buried, centuries-old marine
sediment.
</P>
<P>
   And so a team of marine sediment experts has set up shop on the
Nathaniel B. Palmer, which is sponsored by the National Science
Foundation's Office of Polar Programs. They hope to sink great
hollow cores deep into the ocean off Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   We have arrived at the mouth of the Muller Ice Shelf, near
Lallemand Fjord.
</P>
<P>
   For those who picture Antarctica as a monotony of whites and
grays, Lallemand Fjord is an awakening. The icebergs crowding the
ship this morning are infused with a paint store panoply of blues _
the bright, blaring blues of mouthwashes and toilet-bowl cleaners.
Everyone is out on deck, looking at the ice.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of them are thinking nice thoughts about it. One of the
detractors is Gene Domack, a sedimentologist from Hamilton College
in Clinton, N.Y. He and graduate student Asa Chong left a series of
ocean sediment traps moored in the water here last year, to be
recovered this morning.
</P>
<P>
   If you are planning to study the advance and retreat of ice
shelves over the millennia, you need to be able to recognize the
unique sediment profile of an ice edge. A more detailed familiarity
with one year's worth of sediment (generally about 7 to 12 inches)
also helps scientists interpret the timetable of the longer cores.
</P>
<P>
   Domack withdraws the sample from trap Number 4. ``Look at those
varves!'' marvels a graduate student, admiring the seasonal layers.
Together, these bands are the fingerprint of a calendar year at the
ice's edge.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later the Natbaniel B. Palmer reaches Paradise
Harbor. Out on deck lie the remains of last night's jumbo Piston
Core: a 10-foot length of pipe, bowed like an elephant's tusk. When
it went over the side of the ship, it was straight. Apparently it
hit a hard spot.
</P>
<P>
   While the crew heads to shore for a brief excursion, Domack
alone remains on board, poring over a sonar map of our next
destination. The map helps him decide precisely where to sink the
core.
</P>
<P>
   Domack points to a light-blue area the size of an almond on one
of last week's maps: ``What we're looking for is small pockets like
this one.'' Such sites lie deeper than most of the area's sea
shelf, putting them out of reach of the dragging bellies of
icebergs, where they remain undisturbed for millennia.
</P>
<P>
   What Domack wants is a clean sample, and to get that, he needs
to pull up sediment that reflects only what's dropped down from the
water column directly overhead. Augmenting the SeaBearn map is a
readout that gives a cross section of the sediment layers below the
seafloor. Domack points to a half-inch band of pronounced striping
on the readout: our target.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, we've reached Gerlache Strait and closed in on
the spot. Tonight is the last chance for Domack and Amy Leventer, a
Colgate University marine geologist, to attempt an 80-foot core
sample. Tomorrow we head back to Chile.
</P>
<P>
   With the pipe segments coupled at last, it's time to slide in
the plastic liner segments. If all goes as planned, these will
emerge crammed with grade-A Antarctic mud.
</P>
<P>
   The first two go in easily. By the eighth section, the combined
weights of the seven liners already in place have three of the men
heaving en masse.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on the far end of the deck, the crew hauls in a
12-foot kasten core. Since the impact of a jumbo Piston Core blasts
apart the top few feet of mud, a smaller core is sent down to bring
up an undisturbed first few feet.
</P>
<P>
   The kasten core is also a dress rehearsal: If it comes up full
of mud, it's all systems go.
</P>
<P>
   The top of the kasten core emerges from the sea with water
streaming from a pair of small holes in its sides: a bad sign. The
group gathers round as the core is opened; a pathetic green lump of
mud drops to the deck.
</P>
<P>
   Leventer looks on, more exhausted than upset. She's been up for
19 of the past 24 hours. ``We don't have time to do another kasten
core,'' she says. ``The weather's getting really bad.''
</P>
<P>
   She signals the deck crew to go ahead with the Jumbo Piston
Core. ``If we lose it, we lose it.''
</P>
<P>
   A crane lifts the pipe from the railing, and the crew pushes it
out far enough to clear the ship. With one pull of a quick release,
the pipe swings down into the sea. Then it's lowered by winch and
cable more than 2,000 feet. About 10 feet from the seafloor, a
trigger core hits bottom and releases the main core, which drops
the remainder of the way by gravity and buries itself in the mud.
</P>
<P>
   For the pullout, the action moves to the Aft Control Winch Room,
a window-lined office above the deck. A video monitor displays the
stress being put on the winch cable _ 13,000 pounds and counting.
</P>
<P>
   A half hour later, the head of the core pops up over the side of
the deck. It's coated in green slime. Smiles appear. The core, says
Domack, is the longest ever recovered from the Antarctic
continental shelf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we'll be able to understand how rapidly these climate
transitions took place,'' says Domack, ``and what processes were
involved in making that environmental change.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Domack is gone, back inside to his data logs which may one
day save this big Earth.

<P>
   &UR; BULLET WITH A NAME ON IT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many robberies and homicides go unsolved because there is no way
to trace a bullet found at the crime scene back to a specific gun
and, ultimately, to the person who fired it. So Todd Lizotte, head
of development at NanoVia, has devised a technology to do just
that.
</P>
<P>
   Lizotte, a handgun enthusiast, spent years working with lasers
to shape machine parts. Then he realized that the same process
could enable a gun to emboss bullet casings with a unique symbol.
</P>
<P>
   As a test, he laser-etched a half-millimeter-wide pattern into
the tip of a gun's firing pin. When the gun is fired, the pin slams
into the casing of a bullet, leaving a tiny stamp.
</P>
<P>
   Such a mark could indicate a gun's serial number, which is
already recorded when someone buys it. Casings left behind at a
crime scene would thus contain a signature of the gun from which
they were shot.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, ballistics experts can match casings with their guns
only if the weapon has been recovered. A serial number, in
contrast, would provide an instant ID.
</P>
<P>
   Lizotte is getting feedback from law-enforcement personnel and
</P>
<P>
   from a committee at the United Nations, which is looking for
ways to track arms from peacekeeping missions that find their way
onto the black market.
</P>
<P>
   Gunmakers, however, are reluctant to embrace an idea that makes
gun ownership less private.
</P>
<P>
   ``No company wants to be the first,'' Lizotte says. ``I plan to
approach politicians about introducing tax breaks to manufacturers
who implement it.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ROBOT WATCH: CLAWBOT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bridge inspectors will be able to abandon their precarious ropes
and scaffolding when they work with ROMA.
</P>
<P>
   This climbing robot, built by Carlos Balaguer, Mohamed
Abderrahim and their fellow engineers at the Carlos III University
of Madrid, nimbly navigates steel I-beams on bridges and sends back
video to a human sitting safely on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ROMA has two arms with pincerlike grippers. The robot can turn
</P>
<P>
   corners by pivoting its whole body on its wrist, or flip one arm
up sideways to grab a column and clamber upward.
</P>
<P>
   A built-in map of the structure, along with laser and camera
sensors, makes sure every step is secure.
</P>
<P>
   Future versions of ROMA will be able to automatically find and
report cracks or corrosion, and stay on the bridge for long periods
of time.

   &UR; A CHAMPION OF CHIMPS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The line between chimps and humans is looking blurry these days.
First we thought that only humans use tools. Then we learned that
chimps do too.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, primatologists found that chimps, like humans,
have distinctivecultural habits that vary from group to group.

   Frans de Waal has spent years studying the complexities of chimp
behavior as director of Yerkes' Living Links Center at Emory
</P>
<P>
   University in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  What's the significance of the discovery of chimp culture?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  There's a long tradition in Western thought that humans are
not shackled by biology, whereas animals are pure instinct
machines. The chimpanzee story is telling us that animals may be a
lot closer to us in this regard than we think.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  So what does separate us from chimps or other animals?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  Chimps don't have language. Humans actively instruct others
about how things should be done. Chimpanzees probably pick up
cultural traditions by observation.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  Can chimpanzees create art?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  There are beautiful examples of art done by chimpanzees in
human care. Chimps also have a rain dance: They react to thunderous
noises of rainfall by swaying around rhythmically, their hair
standing on end. Some people have called this dance a superstition,
in that the animals may think that they can stop the rain.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  Are we doing enough to protect wild chimpanzees?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  The conservation situation is the worst it's been in a long
time. In Borneo there have been big fires; in Uganda there are
rebels who threaten chimp researchers. In Africa the biggest threat
of all is the bush meat trade. People are shooting apes, snaring
them, hacking them to death and eating them.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  Would you want to live in a chimp society?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  I'd prefer to live with humans. I think humans are marvels
of conflict resolution and cooperation. Look at New York City,
which has more than 7 million people living crowded together. I
don't think you could put 7 million chimpanzees in a city and have
anything decent going on.

   Although Mars hogs a lot of headlines, scientists have been
building a case that Saturn's giant moon Titan is covered with
oceans of organic chemicals, evidence of complex chemistry similar
to what occurred on the young Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Titan's atmosphere and dense smog have kept scientists guessing
about what is going on below. Astrophysicist Claire Max of Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory recently used the giant Keck I
telescope in Hawaii to examine Titan in infrared light, which can
pierce the global haze.
</P>
<P>
   She and her colleagues then took a series of high-speed
snapshots to freeze the blurring caused by atmospheric turbulence,
and combined them into a single, sharp image. The new picture shows
Titan seemingly divided into bright continents and dark oceans.
</P>
<P>
   Titan's seas probably consist of methane or ethane mixed with
more complex organic molecules-liquid natural gas combined with
tar, basically.
</P>
<P>
   The Cassini spacecraft, now bound for Saturn, will drop a probe
through Titan's clouds in 2004 for a firsthand look. Meanwhile, Max
plans to use the Keck telescope to make a crude map of Titan's
composition.

   ``With a probe, you get lots and lots of data about just one
place,'' Max says. ``We hope to survey the entire surface.

   &UR; BULLET WITH A NAME ON IT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many robberies and homicides go unsolved because there is no way
to trace a bullet found at the crime scene back to a specific gun
and, ultimately, to the person who fired it. So Todd Lizotte, head
of development at NanoVia, has devised a technology to do just
that.
</P>
<P>
   Lizotte, a handgun enthusiast, spent years working with lasers
to shape machine parts. Then he realized that the same process
could enable a gun to emboss bullet casings with a unique symbol.
</P>
<P>
   As a test, he laser-etched a half-millimeter-wide pattern into
the tip of a gun's firing pin. When the gun is fired, the pin slams
into the casing of a bullet, leaving a tiny stamp.
</P>
<P>
   Such a mark could indicate a gun's serial number, which is
already recorded when someone buys it. Casings left behind at a
crime scene would thus contain a signature of the gun from which
they were shot.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, ballistics experts can match casings with their guns
only if the weapon has been recovered. A serial number, in
contrast, would provide an instant ID.
</P>
<P>
   Lizotte is getting feedback from law-enforcement personnel and
</P>
<P>
   from a committee at the United Nations, which is looking for
ways to track arms from peacekeeping missions that find their way
onto the black market.
</P>
<P>
   Gunmakers, however, are reluctant to embrace an idea that makes
gun ownership less private.
</P>
<P>
   ``No company wants to be the first,'' Lizotte says. ``I plan to
approach politicians about introducing tax breaks to manufacturers
who implement it.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ROBOT WATCH: CLAWBOT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bridge inspectors will be able to abandon their precarious ropes
and scaffolding when they work with ROMA.
</P>
<P>
   This climbing robot, built by Carlos Balaguer, Mohamed
Abderrahim and their fellow engineers at the Carlos III University
of Madrid, nimbly navigates steel I-beams on bridges and sends back
video to a human sitting safely on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ROMA has two arms with pincerlike grippers. The robot can turn
</P>
<P>
   corners by pivoting its whole body on its wrist, or flip one arm
up sideways to grab a column and clamber upward.
</P>
<P>
   A built-in map of the structure, along with laser and camera
sensors, makes sure every step is secure.
</P>
<P>
   Future versions of ROMA will be able to automatically find and
report cracks or corrosion, and stay on the bridge for long periods
of time.

<P>
   Not many ships venture into the Drake Passage, 500 miles of
water between the fjords of southern Chile and the tip of the
Antarctic Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing but icy-cold ocean. Here, a ship can expect to
run into waves that are sometimes five stories high. Sailing crews
consider these the most treacherous seas on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   This afternoon, near-hurricane force winds slam growing swells
into the research vessel Nathaniel B. Palmer. Scientists below deck
scurry to lash down computer terminals.
</P>
<P>
   Off the starboard side, hulking waves line up to take a swing at
the ship.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of science justifies the risk of men and women swept
overboard and a $50 million ship lost at sea?
</P>
<P>
   In short, the future of our planet.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate goal of this trip: to gather clues about global
warming. The more immediate goal concerns a regional warming trend
in Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows exactly what this trend means for the rest of the
world, but the western side of the Antarctic Peninsula is warming
up faster than anywhere on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Comparisons of climate records from just a half-century ago show
that temperatures here have risen, on average, 2.5 to 3 degrees
Celsius.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody expected it to happen this fast,'' says glaciologist
Ted Scambos of the University of Colorado at Boulder.
</P>
<P>
   Although most scientists agree that global warming is upon us,
no one yet knows how much of it _ if any _ could be due to a
recurring natural temperature cycle.
</P>
<P>
   The answer lies in the ancient past. To find it, one must look
at what was happening with temperatures thousands of years ago. One
way to do that is to study long-buried, centuries-old marine
sediment.
</P>
<P>
   And so a team of marine sediment experts has set up shop on the
Nathaniel B. Palmer, which is sponsored by the National Science
Foundation's Office of Polar Programs. They hope to sink great
hollow cores deep into the ocean off Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   We have arrived at the mouth of the Muller Ice Shelf, near
Lallemand Fjord.
</P>
<P>
   For those who picture Antarctica as a monotony of whites and
grays, Lallemand Fjord is an awakening. The icebergs crowding the
ship this morning are infused with a paint store panoply of blues _
the bright, blaring blues of mouthwashes and toilet-bowl cleaners.
Everyone is out on deck, looking at the ice.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of them are thinking nice thoughts about it. One of the
detractors is Gene Domack, a sedimentologist from Hamilton College
in Clinton, N.Y. He and graduate student Asa Chong left a series of
ocean sediment traps moored in the water here last year, to be
recovered this morning.
</P>
<P>
   If you are planning to study the advance and retreat of ice
shelves over the millennia, you need to be able to recognize the
unique sediment profile of an ice edge. A more detailed familiarity
with one year's worth of sediment (generally about 7 to 12 inches)
also helps scientists interpret the timetable of the longer cores.
</P>
<P>
   Domack withdraws the sample from trap Number 4. ``Look at those
varves!'' marvels a graduate student, admiring the seasonal layers.
Together, these bands are the fingerprint of a calendar year at the
ice's edge.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later the Natbaniel B. Palmer reaches Paradise
Harbor. Out on deck lie the remains of last night's jumbo Piston
Core: a 10-foot length of pipe, bowed like an elephant's tusk. When
it went over the side of the ship, it was straight. Apparently it
hit a hard spot.
</P>
<P>
   While the crew heads to shore for a brief excursion, Domack
alone remains on board, poring over a sonar map of our next
destination. The map helps him decide precisely where to sink the
core.
</P>
<P>
   Domack points to a light-blue area the size of an almond on one
of last week's maps: ``What we're looking for is small pockets like
this one.'' Such sites lie deeper than most of the area's sea
shelf, putting them out of reach of the dragging bellies of
icebergs, where they remain undisturbed for millennia.
</P>
<P>
   What Domack wants is a clean sample, and to get that, he needs
to pull up sediment that reflects only what's dropped down from the
water column directly overhead. Augmenting the SeaBearn map is a
readout that gives a cross section of the sediment layers below the
seafloor. Domack points to a half-inch band of pronounced striping
on the readout: our target.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, we've reached Gerlache Strait and closed in on
the spot. Tonight is the last chance for Domack and Amy Leventer, a
Colgate University marine geologist, to attempt an 80-foot core
sample. Tomorrow we head back to Chile.
</P>
<P>
   With the pipe segments coupled at last, it's time to slide in
the plastic liner segments. If all goes as planned, these will
emerge crammed with grade-A Antarctic mud.
</P>
<P>
   The first two go in easily. By the eighth section, the combined
weights of the seven liners already in place have three of the men
heaving en masse.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on the far end of the deck, the crew hauls in a
12-foot kasten core. Since the impact of a jumbo Piston Core blasts
apart the top few feet of mud, a smaller core is sent down to bring
up an undisturbed first few feet.
</P>
<P>
   The kasten core is also a dress rehearsal: If it comes up full
of mud, it's all systems go.
</P>
<P>
   The top of the kasten core emerges from the sea with water
streaming from a pair of small holes in its sides: a bad sign. The
group gathers round as the core is opened; a pathetic green lump of
mud drops to the deck.
</P>
<P>
   Leventer looks on, more exhausted than upset. She's been up for
19 of the past 24 hours. ``We don't have time to do another kasten
core,'' she says. ``The weather's getting really bad.''
</P>
<P>
   She signals the deck crew to go ahead with the Jumbo Piston
Core. ``If we lose it, we lose it.''
</P>
<P>
   A crane lifts the pipe from the railing, and the crew pushes it
out far enough to clear the ship. With one pull of a quick release,
the pipe swings down into the sea. Then it's lowered by winch and
cable more than 2,000 feet. About 10 feet from the seafloor, a
trigger core hits bottom and releases the main core, which drops
the remainder of the way by gravity and buries itself in the mud.
</P>
<P>
   For the pullout, the action moves to the Aft Control Winch Room,
a window-lined office above the deck. A video monitor displays the
stress being put on the winch cable _ 13,000 pounds and counting.
</P>
<P>
   A half hour later, the head of the core pops up over the side of
the deck. It's coated in green slime. Smiles appear. The core, says
Domack, is the longest ever recovered from the Antarctic
continental shelf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we'll be able to understand how rapidly these climate
transitions took place,'' says Domack, ``and what processes were
involved in making that environmental change.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Domack is gone, back inside to his data logs which may one
day save this big Earth.

seafloor. Domack points to a half-inch band of pronounced striping
on the readout: our target.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, we've reached Gerlache Strait and closed in on
the spot. Tonight is the last chance for Domack and Amy Leventer, a
Colgate University marine geologist, to attempt an 80-foot core
sample. Tomorrow we head back to Chile.
</P>
<P>
   With the pipe segments coupled at last, it's time to slide in
the plastic liner segments. If all goes as planned, these will
emerge crammed with grade-A Antarctic mud.
</P>
<P>
   The first two go in easily. By the eighth section, the combined
weights of the seven liners already in place have three of the men
heaving en masse.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on the far end of the deck, the crew hauls in a
12-foot kasten core. Since the impact of a jumbo Piston Core blasts
apart the top few feet of mud, a smaller core is sent down to bring
up an undisturbed first few feet.
</P>
<P>
   The kasten core is also a dress rehearsal: If it comes up full
of mud, it's all systems go.
</P>
<P>
   The top of the kasten core emerges from the sea with water
streaming from a pair of small holes in its sides: a bad sign. The
group gathers round as the core is opened; a pathetic green lump of
mud drops to the deck.
</P>
<P>
   Leventer looks on, more exhausted than upset. She's been up for
19 of the past 24 hours. ``We don't have time to do another kasten
core,'' she says. ``The weather's getting really bad.''
</P>
<P>
   She signals the deck crew to go ahead with the Jumbo Piston
Core. ``If we lose it, we lose it.''
</P>
<P>
   A crane lifts the pipe from the railing, and the crew pushes it
out far enough to clear the ship. With one pull of a quick release,
the pipe swings down into the sea. Then it's lowered by winch and
cable more than 2,000 feet. About 10 feet from the seafloor, a
trigger core hits bottom and releases the main core, which drops
the remainder of the way by gravity and buries itself in the mud.
</P>
<P>
   For the pullout, the action moves to the Aft Control Winch Room,
a window-lined office above the deck. A video monitor displays the
stress being put on the winch cable _ 13,000 pounds and counting.
</P>
<P>
   A half hour later, the head of the core pops up over the side of
the deck. It's coated in green slime. Smiles appear. The core, says
Domack, is the longest ever recovered from the Antarctic
continental shelf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we'll be able to understand how rapidly these climate
transitions took place,'' says Domack, ``and what processes were
involved in making that environmental change.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Domack is gone, back inside to his data logs which may one
day save this big Earth.

   WASHINGTON - Procrastinators, this is your week.
</P>
<P>
   For months, government and Red Cross officials have been urging
Americans to take moderate precautions in case the Y2K computer bug
interrupts essential services after Jan. 1. But those warnings
appear to have stirred relatively few people to action.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with just four days left before the Y2K bug bites, people
still have time ``to take simple, common sense steps to prepare,''
said American Red Cross spokeswoman Leslie Credit. In fact, many of
the items you may need, such as flashlights, warm blankets and
plastic containers for water, ``you probably already have in your
home; it's just a matter to getting things together,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say computer glitches will not cause any major
disruptions to the nation's basic infrastructure, such as the power
grids or telecommunications systems. But some communities may
experience localized problems, and no one is sure where those spot
outages might occur. So the Red Cross is urging each household to
be prepared for at least three days of inconveniences.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the concern is the Y2K software flaw that could
cause some older computers to misunderstand the date rollover from
1999 to 2000. Before the mid-1990s, many computers were programmed
to read only two digits of the year. So it's possible ``00'' will
be misread as 1900, triggering equipment malfunctions.
</P>
<P>
   While the biggest bugs have been eradicated, Americans could see
problems. Timed traffic lights could malfunction and cause traffic
tie-ups, for example. Or, computerized pharmacy records could get
confused, making it difficult to refill prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid problems in early January, authorities recommend taking
these steps now:
</P>
<P>
   _ Rinse out two-liter soda bottles or similar plastic containers
and fill them with clean tap water. Put the cap on tightly and
store out of direct sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make sure you have some ready-to-eat foods on hand in case
stores are closed. Peanut butter, canned tuna, granola bars, canned
hams and fresh fruits are good choices.
</P>
<P>
   _ Check your medications and refill any prescriptions that might
run out during the first week of January.
</P>
<P>
   _ Round up your flashlights and check the batteries.
</P>
<P>
   _ Know where you have your warm blankets, coats, gloves and hats
in case the heat goes out.
</P>
<P>
   But just as important as the ``do'' list is the ``don't'' list,
authorities say. Some actions should not be taken because they may
endanger your family or the greater community. Foolish actions to
avoid include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Buying a gun at the last minute. You don't have time to learn
to use it to safely.
</P>
<P>
   _ Waiting until Friday evening to go to an ATM for cash. You
could become a robbery target.
</P>
<P>
   _ Topping off the tank of every vehicle on Friday. If everyone
does that, shortages will hit gas stations and create a panicky
atmosphere on New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make plans to start calling everyone you know at 12:01 a.m.
Jan. 1. Phone companies say a vast surge in calls at the same time
will jam circuits.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Inside and out, the body is a walking zoo, home to billions of
bacteria and countless viruses.
</P>
<P>
   Most microscopic hitchhikers are harmless creatures, even
helpful. Bacteria help digest food, clot blood, and keep harmful
germs out. But a few disease-causing organisms can cause serious
illness and sometimes death.
</P>
<P>
   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists infectious
disease as the No.3 killer of Americans. By understanding how
disease-causing germs travel through air, water, food, and between
people, one can protect oneself from these unseen enemies.
</P>
<P>
   New research adds commonly-touched objects to the list of germ
hideouts.
</P>
<P>
   University of Arizona environmental microbiologist Charles
Gerba, Ph.D., has made a career out of understanding and
publicizing the chain of transmission of germs. In the latest
project, his researcher team set out across the cityscapes of
Chicago, Tucson and San Francisco to determine the degree to which
bodily fluids are present on commonly-touched objects.
Disease-causing germs in bodily fluids can survive for hours or
days on inanimate objects.
</P>
<P>
   Swabbing some 800 surfaces, researchers measured general
cleanliness and tested for the presence of blood, urine, saliva and
sweat. If any human protein with a potential to transmit germs
could be detected, a site was considered unhygienic.
</P>
<P>
   At malls, grocery stores, banks, vending machines, and copy
centers, 44 percent of all surfaces tested were considered
unhygienic. Twenty-one percent of objects tested carried traces of
bodily fluids.
</P>
<P>
   Shopping malls and banks were the most contaminated, with nearly
half of all surfaces failing the general hygiene test. Bodily
fluids were detected on about 27 percent of surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Banks and copy centers surprised me a lot. These are areas
that don't get a lot of cleaning or disinfecting'' says Dr. Gerba.
``I'm going to bring my own pen into the bank. The pen was one of
the worst. If you think about how many people use that pen.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerba says a person is at risk with every contact: ``If I put my
hand on a surface, I could pick up the cold virus that you left
there. Surfaces are really important to cold transmission. You
literally pick up colds all the time. We're not just talking about
colds and flus. Some of the other illnesses you can get are
diarrhea, infectious hepatitis, fevers, and hand foot and mouth
disease.''
</P>
<P>
   The top contaminated surfaces in the study:
</P>
<P>
   --Public telephones
</P>
<P>
   --Public restroom surfaces
</P>
<P>
   --Counter pens
</P>
<P>
   --Chair armrests
</P>
<P>
   --Elevator buttons
</P>
<P>
   --Escalator handrails
</P>
<P>
   --Shopping cart handles
</P>
<P>
   --Grocery refrigerator handles
</P>
<P>
   Gerba's studies show that cleaning can actually make matters
worse. ``We've done studies that show when you clean a bathroom,
you (can) spread more germs around than you're actually killing,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   In Phase 2 of the study, researchers showed that germs on
objects or on the hands can spread easily from outside to inside
the home. A telephone, a bathroom faucet, and a door handle from
three offices were ``contaminated'' with an invisible product that
glows under black light.
</P>
<P>
   The fluorescent dye, known commercially as ``Glow Germ,'' allows
researchers to trace a simulated germ's chain of transmission, and
educators and trainers in schools, food service, and healthcare to
demonstrate disease transmission.
</P>
<P>
   After 30 minutes of normal office routine, with workers
performing regular duties using shared equipment, the product had
spread to copy machines and copied papers, keyboards and mouses,
typewriters, hands, faces, telephones, hair, ears, desktops,
drinking cups, clothes, computers, door knobs, pens, glasses and a
water fountain.
</P>
<P>
   Selected workers were followed home after touching a doorknob
brushed with Glo Germ. In the case of one woman, prior to leaving
the office the traceable dust was found on her hands, shoulder,
hair clip, back pack, sunglasses, purse and keys. In the course of
driving home the product was transferred to the steering wheel,
gear shift, radio dial, door handle, and seat belt.
</P>
<P>
   Within 20 minutes of arrival at home, Glo Germ was found on the
woman's front door, phone, light switch, and drinking mug.
</P>
<P>
   As disturbing as these studies are, Gerba says the point is not
to make people germ-paranoid, but germ-wise.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're always playing Russian roulette every time you touch a
surface,'' he says, ``If there's a germ there, you may or may not
get ill. You can't avoid touching these surfaces all day so you've
got to wash your hands as frequently as makes sense or use those
alcohol gels. Wash your hands and disinfect surfaces.''
</P>
<P>
   Since people come in contact with countless germs, the real
wonder is that humans aren't sick all the time. The human body has
many ``germ warfare'' strategies including...germs. Harmless
bacteria coat the skin producing substances that prevent harmful
germs from invading. Skin also forms a protective barrier. Germs
usually can't enter the skin unless it's through a cut, or an
opening like the eyes, nose, mouth, or genitals. Even then, the
body's immune system attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The immune system is an intricate network of bone marrow, blood,
the lymph nodes and vessels, tonsils, adenoids, the thymus gland
and mucous. It works best when a person is rested and eats healthy
foods.
</P>
<P>
   When a person's immune system is compromised because of young
age, old age, genetics, other illness, drug use, or even an organ
transplant, a person has more difficulty fighting off invading
germs. That's why someone with an impaired immune system is at
higher risk for germs contracted in the environment.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Arizona germ research project was funded by
the Clorox Company, makers of Clorox bleach.

   MILITIA-Y2K (San Francisco) _ The militiamen called them the
``twin sisters'' _ giant steel tanks in rural Sacramento County
that hold enough liquid propane to immolate every living thing for
five miles if they somehow were to explode. For more than a year, a
loose-knit band of survivalists, illegal firearms traders and
right-wing revolutionaries allegedly plotted to detonate the tanks,
perhaps with the same sort of fertilizer bomb used in the 1995
attack on the federal
</P>
<P>
   building in Oklahoma City. But one of the conspirators turned
out to be a shadowy informant whom the FBI had recruited with money

   WRONG-PREDICTIONS (San Francisco) _ The future isn't what it
used to be. In the 1950s and 1960s, the most upbeat visionaries
imagined 2000 as a chrome-plated Tomorrowland with flying cars,
lunar cities and cancer cures. The most downbeat predicted nuclear
wars, gasoline lines a mile long, and widespread starvation. These
are among many incorrect forecasts about what life would be like at
the end of the century. By KEAY DAVIDSON.
</P>
<P>
   FUTURISTS (San Francisco) _ A few years ago, the Futurist, a
journal published by the 30,000-member World Future Society,

They rejected it. That decision epitomizes the hazards of
forecasting the future over the long and the short term. By KEAY
DAVIDSON.

who would rather surf the Web for a paper than write their own.
John Barrie, a neurobiology Ph.D. candidate at Cal, launched an
online service for professors and instructors suspicious of their
students' work. It's called Plagiarism.org. By MATTHEW YI.
</P>
<P>
   CUSTOMS-TONE (San Francisco) _ As of Oct. 1, a series of new

disproportionate number of women and minorities for scrutiny. By

   ADOPTION (Undated) _ There have been memoirs, remembrances and
how-tos on the subject of adoption. But ``A Ghost at Heart's Edge,
Stories

<P>
   and Poems About Adoption,'' published by North Atlantic Books,
</P>
<P>
   is the first book to look at adoption through the lens of

   MILITIA-Y2K (San Francisco) _ The militiamen called them the
``twin sisters'' _ giant steel tanks in rural Sacramento County
that hold enough liquid propane to immolate every living thing for
five miles if they somehow were to explode. For more than a year, a
loose-knit band of survivalists, illegal firearms traders and
right-wing revolutionaries allegedly plotted to detonate the tanks,
perhaps with the same sort of fertilizer bomb used in the 1995
attack on the federal

   WRONG-PREDICTIONS (San Francisco) _ The future isn't what it

<P>
   Kurt and Betty Reichert love to reminisce about days gone by
when they rivaled Hepburn and Bogart with their globe-trotting
escapades. The Reicherts have spent a lifetime trekking, sailing
and flying to the four corners of the globe.
</P>
<P>
   For Betty, who has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD),
nostalgia serves as a memory exercise. Although still spry at 83,
Kurt says he's also losing his memory: ``I'm to the point where I
have to write little notes to myself not to forget what I was going
to do upstairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Kurt's waning memory worries him enough to get tested.
Researchers at the Mayo Clinic say it's a legitimate concern in
light of research identifying a distinct type of memory loss called
mild cognitive impairment, or MCI.
</P>
<P>
   Alzheimer's specialist Dr. Leo Thal says that people with the
condition have chronic memory problems but, generally speaking, no
other symptoms of Alzheimer's such as impaired perception, language
difficulty, disorientation, or sleeping problems:
</P>
<P>
   ``Their spatial relations are fine, their speech is fine, their
language is fine, their ability to navigate is fine. They're
functioning not perfectly normally, but pretty normally,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   HALTING PROGRESSION
</P>
<P>
   Thal estimates three million Americans have mild cognitive
impairment, and 2.5 to 5 million people have Alzheimer's. One
hundred thousand people die from AD each year. He is anxious to
find drugs that will help curb the progression of MCI to
Alzheimer's as his generation--Baby Boomers--moves on to
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Says Thal: ``We think if you're going to develop Alzheimer's
disease, patients will go through this phase. But it's not
generally recognized because individuals who have this syndrome
generally don't present themselves for medical attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Memory loss hasn't stopped the Reicherts from collecting more
memories in the present, most recently touring Europe, from
Normandy to Vienna. Says Keith, ``We travel, we go to water
aerobics, we go to plays, to concerts, to the zoo. We have lots of
friends, we have house guests. We're having a good time.''
</P>
<P>
   But the effort doesn't come easily, Keith notes, especially for
Betty: ``It's a struggle in self-discipline. Much of her struggle
goes on subtly, inside, in ways that I can only fathom that she
doesn't enunciate.''
</P>
<P>
   With MCI, information in the brain isn't reached slowly; the
information vanishes.
</P>
<P>
   Past Mayo Clinic research shows mild cognitive impairment
frequently leads to Alzheimer's disease. Says Thal, ``After three
years, we anticipate that 45 percent of subjects will develop
Alzheimer's disease, after seven years over 70 percent will.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast only 1 percent of the general population in the same
age group develop AD.
</P>
<P>
   NATIONAL DRUG TRIALS
</P>
<P>
   The National Institute on Aging (NIA), as outlined in the March
15, 1999 issue of the journal Archives of Neurology, is
investigating a drug called Aricept (generic name: donepezil) to
see if it can improve memory in MCI patients. Donepezil is a
cholinesterase inhibitor. Research was half funded by NIA and half
funded by the marketer and manufacturer of Aricept, Eisai Inc. and
Pfizer Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Donepezil increases the amount of the neurotransmitter
acetylcholine, which controls memory and other brain functions, and
reduces anxiety and depression, common in AD patients.
</P>
<P>
   NIA is also trying to determine whether large doses of vitamin E
can delay the onset of Alzheimer's in this risk group. Vitamin E is
thought to neutralize cell-damaging free radicals produced by the
buildup of plaques in the brain, a key characteristic of
Alzheimer's.
</P>
<P>
   Past research found that AD sufferers who added large quantities
of vitamin E to their diets took approximately eight months longer
to progress to a more serious level of the disease. A serious side
effect of taking high levels of vitamin E is internal bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   Other drugs are also being researched, including Vioxx, an
anti-inflammatory, nonsteroidal, COX-2 inhibitor, generically known
as rofecoxib.
</P>
<P>
   From the medical community's standpoint, the goal of early
intervention is to keep people out of nursing homes, saving
billions in healthcare costs.
</P>
<P>
   Says Thal, ``At some point we may change the criteria at which
we diagnose Alzheimer's disease, but we're certainly not ready to
do so at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other goals connected to this research, more personal
ones. Kurt says staying independent and together is his family's
top health priority: ``Betty and I consider ourselves very
fortunate--taking the Alzheimer's as a given--in the way we can
work around it, work with it, and cope with it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's at ``home sweet home''--not at a care facility--where Keith
and Betty feel they can best take their trips down Memory Lane, and
plan for their next voyage.

THE 21ST CENTURY'S CHALLENGE: MAKING GLOBALIZATION HUMANE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM WRIGHT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The central problem of the coming century may have been forecast
in one mid-December headline. The $81 billion Exxon-Mobil merger,
the biggest yet in this dizzying cycle of mega-monopolies, is
eliminating 16,000 jobs to swell its stock profits by about $3.8
billion. That's the story, a microcosm of what's happening
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Across the whole spectrum of global business investments runs a
common theme: mergers, layoffs, downsizings, outsourcings, all in
the name of efficiency. For governments, ``privatization,'' the
sale of national public assets to private multinational
corporations. Scattered U.S. plant closings, opening doors to
incorporate the products of ever-cheaper labor abroad.
</P>
<P>
   All very good for investors. Not so good for the world's working
families.
</P>
<P>
   Globalization is an irreversible fact. Our challenge for the
21st century will be to control it, manage it and humanize it.
There must be some common rules to assure that it serves rather
than exploits ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, I believed that the result of the North American Free
Trade Agreement would be higher living standards for the average
citizen in Canada, the United States and Mexico. Results, after six
years, are disillusioning.
</P>
<P>
   Workers in Mexico are not better off. They're worse off. Wages
in 2,000 ``maquiladora'' plants employing Mexican workers have not
risen. They've fallen. Well-known U.S. corporations, encouraged by
official policy, are paying about one-fifth the U.S. minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   Walk today among the sprawling ``colonias'' along our border
where live hundreds of thousands of full-time employees of U.S.
corporations _ many without electricity, sanitary sewer or running
water. Ask yourself if this is what we had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   There was supposed to be a fair labor component to the treaty. A
NAFTA agency, with headquarters in Dallas, was supposed to monitor
labor agreements to guarantee that wages and working conditions
would be favorably, not unfavorably, affected by the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   It never worked. It wasn't set up to work. It had no teeth, no
enforcement mechanism. It was all talk.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the Dallas agency was just unceremoniously closed. The
charade ended. Nobody seemed to care what happened to the workers.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the downsizing and outsourcing on the part of the
multinationals here at home is a transparent attempt to divest
themselves of their legal and contractual responsibilities to their
own employees. Setting up new dummy corporations, or dealing with
low-wage employers, they can escape responsibility for health and
retirement benefits and not have to meet the wages they've
negotiated with their own unions.
</P>
<P>
   As result, corporations get by for less money, and with less
responsibility. Profits soar. And who gets the short end of the
stick? The workers, of course. Who else?
</P>
<P>
   Cumulative social results of all the mergers, outsourcings and
foreign investments include an ever-increasing number of Americans
not covered by health insurance, lower-paying and less secure jobs,
an increase in the number of working poor, and the new norm of
middle-income husband and wife both having to work to achieve the
buying power that one salary provided formerly.
</P>
<P>
   Who benefits? Certainly not the children.
</P>
<P>
   It was a mounting work-force frustration with all this that
erupted in the streets of Seattle to greet the World Trade
Organization in early December. This is the story behind the
demonstrations. Not the little handful of well-publicized fools who
destroyed property. Not the shallow babbling of the press corps
over a cacophony of offbeat causes.
</P>
<P>
   The persistent, peaceful, mainstream complaint that swelled to a
chorus from 45,000 orderly demonstrators was this: Listen up, WTO.
You've forgotten the common man, and woman. In all your cozy,
sophisticated trade dealings between nations and corporations,
you've lost sight of people. The workers. The ones whose labor
produces these goods.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the convention center, envoys from 135 member nations,
accustomed to dealing in private, seemed stunned, surprised. In
bafflement, they asked: Who are these people? What concern are
terms of trade to them?
</P>
<P>
   What concern, indeed?
</P>
<P>
   Ever so unconsciously, we've strayed from our path. For most of
the 20th century, America was intent on spreading the good things
wider and wider. A people's capitalism. From Theodore Roosevelt to
Lyndon Johnson, that was our mission.
</P>
<P>
   The American dream. Dependable jobs and livable wages. Home
ownership a universal family right. A car in every garage. Secure
retirement. Affordable health care. Higher education, ever more
attainable for all God's children.
</P>
<P>
   What immense progress we made! Our 20th century, opined
President Franklin D. Roosevelt, would be celebrated as the
``Century of the Common Man.'' We were not developing ``wealth for
its own sake,'' said FDR. ``Wealth is the means and people are the
ends.''
</P>
<P>
   What happened? We seem today on the verge of becoming a
corporate state. Worker productivity has risen dramatically, but
wages haven't kept pace. More economic power settles in fewer hands
each year. A few enormous corporations control more wealth than
national governments. And there's less public accountability.
</P>
<P>
   But now there's a belated, almost sudden awakening. People
increasingly realize how far, and how fast, we've drifted. After a
generation of somnambulence, government is rediscovering its
anti-monopoly responsibilities to the public.
</P>
<P>
   And if countries like China are to be our new trading partners,
somebody must make some new rules for the rights of working people
everywhere. To outlaw child labor. And slave labor. And indentured
labor. And exploitative sweatshop wages that bleed away life's
juices from vulnerable people who have no other place to go for a
job. So that they may be customers, too.
</P>
<P>
   Work for the 21st century.

TEOCALTICHE, Mexico: other out.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cesareo Delgadillo, Epifanio's brother, also lives in Fort Worth
and works on conversion vans. He said he is offended when people
accuse Mexicans and other immigrants of being welfare freeloaders
in search of free health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Immigrants built the United States,'' he said. ``If it weren't
for immigrants, the U.S. economy would not be as strong as it is.
When we go there, we buy houses, we pay taxes and we work, often
for very little.''
</P>
<P>
   After Epifanio and Cesareo Delgadillo moved to the south side of
Fort Worth, the exodus from Lo de Carrera continued. Now, several
dozen people from the same ranch live and work there, returning
home only for the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   They help one another find work, act as translators, and pool
resources to rent and buy homes.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Carvajal had been living in Mexico most of this year
because of an illness, but he, too, makes his home in Fort Worth,
where he works for Mike Cancos' carpentry company. Another brother,
Cirilo Carvajal, 19, lives in Fort Worth, and a third, Margarito
Carvajal, 23, lives in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The last remaining brother, Adan Gonzalez Carvajal, lives in
Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and works as an assistant to the famous
Mexican singer Juan Gabriel.
</P>
<P>
   Adan Carvajal's work has allowed him to buy a home for his
family in Fort Worth. And in one room of the ranch house at Lo de
Carrera sits a new computer with the Windows 98 operating system
and a scanner.
</P>
<P>
   ``One can get ahead in the United States more than here,'' Adan
Gonzalez Carvajal said. ``The schools are better and more
opportunities are available. And children learn English, which will
probably be the world language one day.''
</P>
<P>
   The migration has changed Lo de Carrera. Older people, like
Candido Carvajal, still work their land as was done at the turn of
the century.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the houses are empty, their doors locked and their
occupants working in cities like Fort Worth, Los Angeles, Chicago
and Fort Lauderdale. A drive through the ranch's center reveals few
young children.
</P>
<P>
   Still, La Navidad remains a time to return to Mexico to enjoy
the posadas, eat Christmas meals and be with family. In
Teocaltiche, it appears that every fourth car or truck bears Texas
license plates, with a few from California, Illinois, Nevada and
New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Down Ninos Heroes street, past the cathedral, is the Cementerio
de Los Angeles. Hundreds of elaborate monuments to the town's dead
stand inside its gated walls. The placid eyes of La Virgen de
Guadalupe and Jesucristo stare timelessly into space. Everywhere,
bright flowers are a reminder that the dead are not forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Between two monuments lies a mountain of funeral wreaths bearing
messages like ``For Javier'' or ``From the Gonzalez Gonzalez
family.''
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the wreaths, the nine are buried, together in death as
in life. It is a public display of mourning and connects the whole
town to this tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   But a far greater pain takes place in private.
</P>
<P>
   Since the accident, Maria Concepcion Carvajal has been in
seclusion at the home of her sister, Prudencia Gonzalez Jimenez.
The loss of six of her 11 children has cast her into deep despair,
and she is not eating.
</P>
<P>
   Her family fears that she may not survive the tragedy. Her son
Adan wants her to live with him in Fort Lauderdale.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Candido Carvajal, is a man of few words. At age 69,
he still gets up every morning and heads for the fields of Lo de
Carrera. There he stays, day in and day out. His horse has no name,
but they are partners nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   And he seems strangely unlike a man who lost six children and
three grandchildren a week ago. But beneath his stoic exterior, one
senses a deep pain that only he can feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Angels, all of them,'' he said, a distant smile on his brown
wrinkled face. ``Now, they're in Heaven, and we have to keep on
living. I have to be strong for those who remain.''

<P>
   TEOCALTICHE, Mexico _ Inside the warm, bright kitchen, women
chattered as tamales stuffed with meat and sweet fruits steamed in
huge pots. Outside, the men watched sausages and strips of pork
roast, their eyes glowing with the heat of the fire.
</P>
<P>
   The lively din of children peppered the air.
</P>
<P>
   Then the clock struck midnight and the hugs began.
</P>
<P>
   ``Feliz Navidad,'' they told one another, somberly. ``Merry
Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   Christmas came to this central Mexican home this year, but it
brought little joy. One week earlier, nine members of this family
perished on a dark Mexican highway as they headed south for the
holidays from their home in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Six were children, ages 1 to 16. Only one person, Jose Carvajal,
24, survived. The truck driver who collided with the family's
Suburban fled and still eludes police.
</P>
<P>
   Killed in the crash were siblings Javier, 1, and Cecilia
Delgadillo, 4, and their cousin Cindy Delgadillo, 6. Also dead are
six brothers and sisters: Filiberta Carvajal Delgadillo, 29, Javier
and Cecilia's mother; and Maria, 11, Silvano, 13, Eva, 16, Noel,
who turned 22 the day he died, and Sofia Carvajal, 29.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy has scarred many in the three communities that the
Carvajal and Delgadillo families called home: Fort Worth, where
they had lived for several years; the small Mexican town of
Teocaltiche; and the small ranch in central Mexico called Lo de
Carrera, about 260 miles northwest of Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, thousands lined the stone streets of Teocaltiche in
mourning. They packed the Cementerio de Los Angeles, the final
resting place for all nine. At a time typically marked by joyful
family gatherings, relatives in all three communities can only
wonder why life has brought them so much death.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just can't understand how life could do this,'' said
Prudencia Gonzalez Jimenez, an aunt to many of the dead.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Behind the white steel doors at 96 Juan A. Garcia St., the
shuffling of footsteps on the concrete floor signals the start of a
new day.
</P>
<P>
   Floors are swept; breakfast is cooked. The strong smell of
varnish pickles the air as the 30-year-old family business of
making wooden chess sets churns on. A small plastic Christmas tree
sits in one corner of the front sitting room. It appears to be a
typical Mexican home the week before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   But life here changed dramatically a week ago. Normally the
family gathering place for festivities, the home of Prudencia and
Juan Gonzalez Jimenez is a site of mourning. On Wednesday, Elida
Carvajal Delgadillo looked at a Fort Worth Star-Telegram from last
week and saw a picture of her 6-year-old daughter, Cindy, who died
in the wreck.
</P>
<P>
   Her hand flew to her mouth and tears began to flow freely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ay, mi nina,'' she cried softly.
</P>
<P>
   Elida Carvajal Delgadillo and her husband, Epifanio Delgadillo,
had left Fort Worth for Mexico and were eager to be reunited with
their little girl. Now, Elida is the last remaining daughter in the
family.
</P>
<P>
   As the day wore on, brothers, cousins and grandparents filled
the home, whispering and hugging. Some shed tears; others prayed.
</P>
<P>
   A child's squeal came from the bedroom as Elida Delgadillo's
3-year-old son, Erik, tore into a box of brand-new toy cars. He was
once one of four grandchildren in the Carvajal and Delgadillo
families, which are related by marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is the only one.
</P>
<P>
   He can't understand why his sister isn't around to celebrate
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asks me, `Where is she, papa? D''nde est , Cindy?' '' his
father said. ``I bought something for him the other day and he said
I should buy something for Cindy, too. He's too young to
understand.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Christmas was on the horizon when the Carvajal and Delgadillo
families loaded the Suburban in south Fort Worth on Dec. 17. Some
family members had left for Mexico days or weeks earlier, and this
would be the last batch of passengers to make the trip. Six of them
were children who had to stay in school until that Friday.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 15, Jose Carvajal flew to Ciudad Juarez, picked up the
Suburban and drove it to Fort Worth. There, nine others boarded,
gifts in tow, and headed for Mexico about 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   They planned to make the trip in 13 hours, stopping only when
necessary. It started out happily, Jose Carvajal said. Brother Noel
Carvajal had turned 22 that day and, by Saturday morning, all would
be home for the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Because he had driven so much already, Jose Carvajal fell asleep
in the passenger's seat during the trip. He was still asleep at 3
a.m. when he awoke to the sound of steel crashing against steel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was disoriented and I barely remember what happened,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   MORE nn
</P>
<P>
   His eyes lower when he thinks about what happened next. His
brothers and sisters were in pain, as he was, having broken his
left arm. There was chaos inside the van as people tried to move
around, to quell the pain.
</P>
<P>
   The youngest children cried, and 13-year-old Silvano said his
leg hurt. Yards away, the steel mill truck that hit them was turned
on its side, but Jose Carvajal could not read the name or the
license plates.
</P>
<P>
   A third vehicle, also from Fort Worth, was reportedly involved
in the accident, but relatives said the family was released by
police and left the scene.
</P>
<P>
   On the highway, no one passed by for what seemed like forever.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, at least an hour later, Jose Carvajal said, a car
stopped and some people covered the injured with blankets, and then
left to call help. Eventually, ambulances arrived and Jose Carvajal
was whisked off to a hospital nearby, where a doctor set his arm
and gave him painkillers.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't know it then, but the nine others were dead.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Carvajal survived, but the pain of losing six brothers and
sisters, two nieces and a nephew is visible in his eyes, his
hunched frame, his drawn lips. What haunts him most is that some of
the nine _ he doesn't know which _ were still alive for some time
after the accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``If help had arrived more quickly, some of my brothers and
sisters could have survived,'' he said. ``They were alive for a
while after the wreck, but help didn't come in time.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Jose Carvajal was born and raised on Lo de Carrera, the small
ranch named for those who set up a home there more than a century
ago. Today, the rural ranch is a world away from bustling Fort
Worth.
</P>
<P>
   The dusty, bumpy ride from Teocaltiche to Lo de Carrera takes
close to an hour, even though they are only about 10 miles apart.
Along the way, travelers cross from Jalisco state into Zacatecas
state.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Carvajal knows the way with his eyes closed. He lived on
the ranch for his first 20 years and returns frequently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Left at the fork, right at the road paved with stones, and
here we are,'' he said, as the car rounded a curve. Below, laid out
like living carpet, was the ranch. Small brick homes dot its
surface, and steel-blue mountains line the horizon. At the fenced
entrance to the ranch, a sleepy cow chews and stares, a benign
gatekeeper.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's beautiful here,'' Carvajal said. ``Here we work, plant
crops, cultivate the land, and you never go hungry.''
</P>
<P>
   The air is pure. During the day, the sun beats down on old men
working in the fields, their sandals caked with dust.
</P>
<P>
   Burros carry loads of hay, roosters crow and women hang clothes
to dry. The low-wattage lights from inside the many farmhouses are
swallowed by the night.
</P>
<P>
   It is a land of leathery hands and deeply creased faces, where
manual labor is valued and the strength of community upheld. For
the Carvajal and Delgadillo families, most of whom were born and
raised here, Lo de Carrera is without question the place they call
home.
</P>
<P>
   Candido and Maria Concepcion Carvajal, the patriarch and
matriarch, both grew up on the ranch in the 1930s and '40s. They
raised crops, as their families had done before them, and bore 11
children.
</P>
<P>
   On 5 hectares (about 12 acres) of fertile land, they built a
brick home and began their life together raising corn, beans and
squash. Decades later, wearing high-dollar sneakers and an ESPN
ball cap, Jose Carvajal remembers his childhood as a happy,
innocent time.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were growing up, we were extremely poor,'' he said.
``We never had toys, so we played with our shoes, with rocks,
whatever we found.''
</P>
<P>
   When the children got older, they put on work boots or durable
leather sandals and a hat and worked the fields, planting and
harvesting the family crops. When things got dull, there was always
the nearby town of Teocaltiche.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as now, the senses came alive with the scent of roasting
corn, the rumble of trucks coughing out plumes of black smoke, and
the blare of Mexican ranchera music from cheap speakers in store
doorways.
</P>
<P>
   That was life for Jose and his 10 brothers and sisters.
</P>
<P>
   Then, people began leaving to ``el norte.''
</P>
<P>
   Jose Carvajal remembers hearing the stories as a young child.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the United States was the best, and it was my dream
to go there,'' he said. ``People who went there said you could make
a lot of money and live well.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven years ago, his older sister Elida and her husband moved to
the south side of Fort Worth in search of work. They chose Fort
Worth because Epifanio Delgadillo had cousins already living and
working there who could help them get on their feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard, and scary, to go where you don't know
anyone,'' said Epifanio Delgadillo, who works in a pepperoni
factory in Fort Worth. ``When you go, you look for your own kind.
We stick together and help each other out.''
</P>
<P>
   MORE nn
</P>
<P>
   Cesareo Delgadillo, Epifanio's brother, also lives in Fort Worth
and works on conversion vans. He said he is offended when people
accuse Mexicans and other immigrants of being welfare freeloaders
in search of free health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Immigrants built the United States,'' he said. ``If it weren't
for immigrants, the U.S. economy would not be as strong as it is.
When we go there, we buy houses, we pay taxes and we work, often
for very little.''
</P>
<P>
   After Epifanio and Cesareo Delgadillo moved to the south side of
Fort Worth, the exodus from Lo de Carrera continued. Now, several
dozen people from the same ranch live and work there, returning
home only for the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   They help one another find work, act as translators, and pool
resources to rent and buy homes.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Carvajal had been living in Mexico most of this year
because of an illness, but he, too, makes his home in Fort Worth,
where he works for Mike Cancos' carpentry company. Another brother,
Cirilo Carvajal, 19, lives in Fort Worth, and a third, Margarito
Carvajal, 23, lives in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The last remaining brother, Adan Gonzalez Carvajal, lives in
Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and works as an assistant to the famous
Mexican singer Juan Gabriel.
</P>
<P>
   Adan Carvajal's work has allowed him to buy a home for his
family in Fort Worth. And in one room of the ranch house at Lo de
Carrera sits a new computer with the Windows 98 operating system
and a scanner.
</P>
<P>
   ``One can get ahead in the United States more than here,'' Adan
Gonzalez Carvajal said. ``The schools are better and more
opportunities are available. And children learn English, which will
probably be the world language one day.''
</P>
<P>
   The migration has changed Lo de Carrera. Older people, like
Candido Carvajal, still work their land as was done at the turn of
the century.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the houses are empty, their doors locked and their
occupants working in cities like Fort Worth, Los Angeles, Chicago
and Fort Lauderdale. A drive through the ranch's center reveals few
young children.
</P>
<P>
   Still, La Navidad remains a time to return to Mexico to enjoy
the posadas, eat Christmas meals and be with family. In
Teocaltiche, it appears that every fourth car or truck bears Texas
license plates, with a few from California, Illinois, Nevada and
New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Down Ninos Heroes street, past the cathedral, is the Cementerio
de Los Angeles. Hundreds of elaborate monuments to the town's dead
stand inside its gated walls. The placid eyes of La Virgen de
Guadalupe and Jesucristo stare timelessly into space. Everywhere,
bright flowers are a reminder that the dead are not forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Between two monuments lies a mountain of funeral wreaths bearing
messages like ``For Javier'' or ``From the Gonzalez Gonzalez
family.''
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the wreaths, the nine are buried, together in death as
in life. It is a public display of mourning and connects the whole
town to this tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   But a far greater pain takes place in private.
</P>
<P>
   Since the accident, Maria Concepcion Carvajal has been in
seclusion at the home of her sister, Prudencia Gonzalez Jimenez.
The loss of six of her 11 children has cast her into deep despair,
and she is not eating.
</P>
<P>
   Her family fears that she may not survive the tragedy. Her son
Adan wants her to live with him in Fort Lauderdale.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Candido Carvajal, is a man of few words. At age 69,
he still gets up every morning and heads for the fields of Lo de
Carrera. There he stays, day in and day out. His horse has no name,
but they are partners nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   And he seems strangely unlike a man who lost six children and
three grandchildren a week ago. But beneath his stoic exterior, one
senses a deep pain that only he can feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Angels, all of them,'' he said, a distant smile on his brown
wrinkled face. ``Now, they're in Heaven, and we have to keep on
living. I have to be strong for those who remain.''

BOOK BUSINESS IS GOOD, BUT IT'S HARD FOR AUTHORS TO GET NOTICED

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even though Americans are reading more _ book sales are up
nearly 15 percent in the '90s, according to industry surveys _ the
chances of talented, lesser-known writers becoming bestselling
superstars are worse than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a deadly combination of things _ the changing nature of
the publishing industry, the tastes of bookstore patrons, and the
kinds of books and authors the media chooses to publicize, when
they do publicize books at all,'' says Kenneth Kirkland, an
independent publishing-industry analyst based in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's put it this way: In some months, as many as 5,000 books
are published in America. Each month, Oprah Winfrey chooses one
book to feature in her book club. Five thousand-to-one is about the
correct odds for a really gifted writer to break out into the Tom
Clancy-Anne Rice-Stephen King stratosphere of being popular enough
to guarantee huge sales,'' Kirkland says.
</P>
<P>
   New Mexico's Tony Hillerman, whose first mystery novels cracked
bestseller lists in the early 1970s, is more succinct:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad I'm not trying to make a name for myself now,''
Hillerman says. ``It's just about impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   The primary reason, analysts and authors agree, is the business
philosophy of major publishing companies. Most are part of
diversified corporate conglomerates whose mission is to make as
much money as possible for shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a numbers-crunching business now,'' says Texas author
Carlton Stowers, who has won two prestigious Edgar awards for best
true crime writing. ``Take Random House,'' Stowers says. ``Now
they're run by this big German outfit who are huge in the auto
industry. They know how to make money selling cars, so they run
their new book business like a car dealership. The big names get
all the attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Kirkland says that publishers put their muscle behind Stephen
King or Anne Rice because the profits subsidize the other books
being published.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, when publicists contact TV and radio talk-show
hosts and print journalists urging interviews with authors, their
first efforts concentrate on the big names.
</P>
<P>
   But when they tout lesser-known but gifted writers to the media,
the media aren't interested.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is frustrating,'' says Norton publicist Catherine Melnicki.
``Usually to break out an author, it takes major media hits
(coverage), but most of the (media) people we contact just want the
big names. Well, they want ratings or lots of readers, and the big
names bring that. Everyone works by the rules of a
capitalism-driven marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   To save money, many publishers are cutting back on the number of
``midlist'' authors, whose work doesn't make the bestseller lists.
</P>
<P>
   Novelists are in the highest risk category. ``Up until the '60s
and '70s, the book industry was driven by fiction,'' Kirkland says.
``But titles like `In Cold Blood' (by Truman Capote) and `Helter
Skelter' (by Vincent Bugliosi) changed that. It has evolved to a
point where I'd estimate two-thirds of the titles sold each year
are nonfiction. Bookstores, which are now mostly huge chains like
Barnes &AMP; Noble, push those.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado writer Pam Houston's first two books, ``Cowboys Are My
Weakness'' and ``Waltzing the Cat,'' were composed of short
stories. Each received critical kudos but sold modestly. At the
strong suggestion of her publisher, Houston's third collection, ``A
Little More About Me,'' is a series of first-person essays, many of
which appeared in magazines Houston writes for to augment her
income.
</P>
<P>
   ``The publisher tells me this is what I need to do if I want to
become well-known enough for my fiction to sell,'' Houston says.
``I understand and I'll try it. But my fiction means so much more
to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``kind'' of nonfiction most popular with readers also
hampers fine writers in search of recognition.
</P>
<P>
   ``So-called self-help books are classified as nonfiction, and
those are often written by psychologists, professors, professionals
who couldn't or shouldn't write books about anything other than
their area of specialization,'' Kirkland says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do they sell millions of books while much more talented
writers sell in the few thousands? Of course they do,'' Kirkland
says. ``Publishers are marketing books to a society in search of
quick fixes to personal problems.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which leaves most lesser-known writers with one shining
hope: Oprah Winfrey.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could get one of my books on `Oprah,' I would pay my own
way to get there,'' Stowers says.
</P>
<P>
   MORE nn
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, when she endorsed the novel ``The Deep End of the
Ocean'' by then-unknown Jacquelyn Mitchard, Winfrey has selected
one book a month and invited its author to appear on her nationally
syndicated TV show. Bestsellerdom is not guaranteed as a result _
Sheri Reynolds' ``The Rapture of Canaan'' and Ernest J. Gaines' ``A
Lesson Before Dying'' were never bestsellers. Sometimes Winfrey
selects books that have long been in print, such as Toni Morrison's
``Song of Solomon.''
</P>
<P>
   But Winfrey made stars of Mitchard and Wally Lamb (''I Know This
Much Is True''), while helping Anna Quindlen (''Black and Blue: A
Novel,'' Jane Hamilton (''The Book of Ruth''), Maeve Binchy (''Tara
Road'') and Alice Hoffman (''Here on Earth'') move up on the
celebrity author ladder.
</P>
<P>
   Failing Oprah, Kirkland concludes, the best, if near-miraculous,
way for an unknown author to break into bestsellerdom ``is still
word of mouth by people who work in bookstores. Charles Frazier's
``Cold Mountain'' became a bestseller that way, with somebody
suggesting the book, somebody buying it and then recommending it to
friends. Kent Haruf's ``Plainsong,'' too. That kind of thing still
happens. It just doesn't happen much.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Few modern American authors are household names _ industry
analyst Kenneth Kirkland says the modern-day ``famous writer'' list
``probably consists of John Grisham, Tom Clancy, Patricia Cornwell,
Stephen King, Toni Morrison, Anne Rice, Tom Wolfe and maybe John
Updike, with people like Dave Barry, Mary Higgins Clark, Tony
Hillerman and Sandra Brown on the next rung under that.''
</P>
<P>
   Following are four of America's finest, if not best-known,
current writers. One is a publishing veteran, one has just
published her third title, and two are relative rookies.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bryson: The crusty Iowa native is wrongly categorized as a
travel writer. In fact, his on-the-road rants offer both belly
laughs and thoughtful criticisms of modern culture.
</P>
<P>
   Best book: ``A Walk in the Woods'' (Broadway Books, $25), which
chronicles Bryson's disastrous attempt to hike the Appalachian
Trail. An imaginary scene where Bryson is set upon by bears may be
the funniest moment in modern American literature.
</P>
<P>
   In his own words: ``When you write for a living, you want as
wide an audience as possible. It's human instinct to crave success.
But actually, one of the nicest things about not being well-known
is it spares you the downside of celebrity. I would hate to be
recognized when I walk down the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric Garcia: Still in his 20s, Garcia has a college degree in
creative writing and film. While working as a screenwriter in Los
Angeles, Garcia decided to try his hand at a novel. The spectacular
result failed to reach a wide audience, but gained sufficient
critical praise to ensure that his second book will be widely
reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Best book: ``Anonymous Rex: A Detective Story'' (Villard, $23)
stands the hoary mystery genre on its literary ear. Garcia's
protagonist, LA gumshoe Vincent Rubio, is a velociraptor disguised
as a human. The book's sequel, ``Casual Rex,'' should be published
in 2000 or 2001.
</P>
<P>
   In his own words: ``I got the idea while watching a documentary
(about dinosaurs) on television. My hope is to write novels, and to
be able to try different things from other books that are out
there. Certainly I hope for a wide audience; I'm trying to
entertain as many people as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Pam Houston: The Colorado writer divides her time between
crafting short stories and engaging in life-threatening wilderness
adventures, many of which she writes about for outdoor magazines.
Novelist Pat Conroy says he ``loves and adores'' Houston's work.
Mystery writer James Lee Burke considers Houston ``one of the best
I've ever read.''
</P>
<P>
   Best book: While publisher Norton hopes the nonfiction ``A
Little More About Me'' will finally gain Houston the audience she
deserves, ``Cowboys Are My Weakness'' (Washington Square Press, $14
in paperback) is the short-story collection that cemented Houston's
reputation. It is a priceless example of just how compelling short
fiction can be.
</P>
<P>
   In her own words: ``It means so much to me, whenvever I do book
signings, when people come up to me and start talking like they're
friends, because they feel they know me from reading my books. That
kind of connection with readers _ it's what writing is about. I
hope my books become better known, of course, but it's the writing
itself that I care about most _ doing the best I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Karla Kuban: A native of Minnesota who now lives in New Mexico,
Kuban is the product of several distinguished writing programs,
including a stint as a James A. Michener Fellow at the University
of Texas at Austin. After winning several awards for short stories,
Kuban attempted a novel _ and what a novel ``Marchlands'' was.
Critics swooned, but as a first-time author, Kuban received minimal
publicity, and the book failed to ``earn back its advance'' for
publisher Scribner. Kuban is working on her second novel.
</P>
<P>
   Best book: ``Marchlands: A Novel'' (Scribner, $23) is a
coming-of-age story, set on a western sheep ranch, in which Kuban
evokes the best writing of Ivan Doig (character development) and
Larry McMurtry (sense of place).
</P>
<P>
   In her own words: ``A first-time author like me can't expect to
be instantly known, to become a household name right away, if ever.
I am only slightly frustrated that my book didn't achieve higher
sales figures. In the end, I am grateful that it has been
published, thankful to be making a living as a writer.''

<P>
   BOSTON _ After years of work by New England's big utilities,
phone companies, and government agencies to solve the Y2K computer
glitch, it is hard to make a case for major infrastructure
disruptions at midnight Friday.
</P>
<P>
   As the final week of 1999 begins, power providers, including
Boston Edison and New England Electric, say their systems are in
order; banks, including Fleet Boston Corp., say they've got Y2K
covered.
</P>
<P>
   A key water supplier, the Massachusetts Water Resources
Authority, received a mostly healthy audit report earlier this
month on its Y2K readiness. In New Hampshire, a consultant found
the state's main power companies to have a low risk of disruption,
although some smaller water and telephone companies were judged to
have a ``moderate'' risk of problems.
</P>
<P>
   At the national level, ``We have no indications there are
problems that were overlooked or not paid attention to,'' John
Koskinen, President Clinton's top Y2K adviser, said in an interview
late last week.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen and others make fewer promises about what might happen
overseas, but most domestic worries now center on what might occur
as businesses and stock exchanges open Monday, Jan. 3, when
thousands of minor failures could add up to significant
difficulties. That's still progress, considering how much
hand-wringing there was at the start of 1999 that major systems
wouldn't be fixed in time.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Goldberg, a computer consultant who advises a dozen
clients on Y2K matters, said he still expects some problems in the
first few weeks of January but credits ``economic self-interest''
for motivating many companies to speed up their preparations during
the past 12 months. ``Nobody can afford to take the
public-relations hit of a Y2K failure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials can't know for sure what will happen when the clock
strikes midnight, but they have developed plenty of plans to limit
the impact of any problems.
</P>
<P>
   Where available, some of these documents are sobering. The MWRA,
for example, imagines a worst-case scenario in which ``regional
power and/or communications may be lost for up to three consecutive
days and unstable conditions may persist for up to 14 days.''
</P>
<P>
   The MWRA says it could keep operating under such circumstances,
a good thing considering the White House estimates that only 15 to
20 percent of US households have stockpiled supplies.
</P>
<P>
   But planners are paid for their pessimism, and overall, ``things
look good,'' said Jim Sinclair, spokesman for ISO New England Inc.
in Holyoke, the region's bulk electric power-distribution
organization.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the organization's largest member utilities, including
New England Electric and Northeast Utilities, parent of Western
Mass. Electric and Public Service Co. of New Hampshire, said they
had completed upgrades of their most important systems.
</P>
<P>
   These companies declined to release internal audits they have
commissioned of their preparations, prompting criticism. On Dec.
20, ISO New England did release the results of a spot-check of 13
power generation, transmission, and control facilities done by Duke
Engineering &AMP; Services, although the power companies that
participated were allowed to select which of their systems were
checked.
</P>
<P>
   Out of 425 items that were surveyed, utilities were able to
produce documents showing a successful fix in 423 cases. Both
exceptions related to purchase orders, a result the Massachusetts
Department of Telecommunications and Energy says is sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   Another worry was that many large-power consumers would fire up
their own emergency generators over New Year's weekend, creating an
imbalance between the amount of power demanded and the amount
produced.
</P>
<P>
   But after hearing this concern at an industry meeting in August,
major transmission companies surveyed their big customers and know
of only a few that plan to use their own power this weekend. New
England Electric has received commitments from its 3,100 large
commercial and industrial consumers that they will remain ``on the
grid,'' said spokeswoman Karen Berardino. ``Everybody agreed to
cooperate.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinclair, the ISO's spokesman, said the organization's members
typically generate about 10,000 megawatts of power during New
Year's weekend; based on recent surveys the group expects to
produce about 12,000 megawatts this year, mostly to accommodate the
extra office workers many companies expect to have on duty.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those will be employees of Bell Atlantic, the dominant
phone company in 13 Northeastern states. It will have 20,000
employees on duty Friday night, 5,000 more than usual.
</P>
<P>
   For the MWRA, which supplies water and sewer services to about
2.6 million people in Eastern Massachusetts, service disruptions
could lead to public-health concerns. But the agency says it is set
to handle any contingency related to Y2K after spending $4.3
million on software upgrades and extra supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Of that, $600,000 has been spent on new electric generators in
case they are needed to pump water to communities. But the
authority says water systems serving 85 percent of its customers
are driven by gravity and don't require power to operate.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the power companies, the water authority did agree to
share the results of an outside review of its preparations.
</P>
<P>
   The review by the state, released by State Auditor Joseph
DeNucci's office Dec. 8, states that ``it appears that the
authority will be well-positioned to ensure continued provision of
its critical business operations up to, during, and after the year
changeover.''
</P>
<P>
   DeNucci's report raised several concerns about the authority's
contingency plans for continuing operations in case of power
disruptions. In particular, the auditors cited concerns about
whether the MWRA could obtain enough fuel to run all of its back-up
generators for three straight days, since the fuel tanks of some
would need frequent refills.
</P>
<P>
   That could prove confusing amid competing demands for fuel
``between public and private sector entities,'' the auditor's
report states, sounding more like a plan for civil defense.
</P>
<P>
   Greg DeFronzo, who heads the MWRA's Y2K readiness efforts, said
it has since clarified its refueling plans with its vendors.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, the state's public utilities commission this
month released a consultant's report stating that ``the state's
utilites are well-positioned'' to cope with Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   The auditors gave good marks to the state's electric and gas
utilities and to Bell Atlantic, which serves 94 percent of New
Hampshire. They assigned a ``moderate'' risk rating to many smaller
telecommunications and water systems in places such as Hanover.
</P>
<P>
   But the consultants said that overall, most of the water
companies ``have exhibited diligence in performance of their Y2K
programs.''

`2000' MAY SOON BECOME A THING OF THE PAST FOR MARKETERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For now, you can find the number ``2000'' attached to the names
of everything from breath mints to government reports to an escort
service on the World Wide Web _ generally meant to suggest a
product is new and nifty.
</P>
<P>
   But seen in that light, the imminent arrival of Jan. 1, 2000,
represents a marketing catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   Who wants to be associated with the past?
</P>
<P>
   ``Once New Year's Eve comes and goes, anything that says `2000'
on it could seem backward-looking,'' said Richard Schreuer of
Chadwick Martin Bailey, a Boston consulting firm that helps
companies come up with product names.
</P>
<P>
   Enough already, said Patrick Devine, whose Amsterdam, N.Y.,
company recently quit selling its Concept 2000 woodworking tool.
Once, the name seemed innovative, he said, but lately, ``You want
to stick your finger down your throat anytime you hear a
reference'' to 2000.
</P>
<P>
   PC maker Gateway 2000 also has dropped the number from its
corporate name and now goes by Gateway Inc. And Shell Oil Co. has
quit selling its SU2000 gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   A fast-food unit of ConAgra Brands is about to change the name
of its ``2000'' microwaveable popcorn brand to ``Extreme Butter,''
thinking it more up-to-date.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a better way to hit that teenage boy market,''
marketing manager Dan O'Connor said. ``We don't want to seem
passe.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the children's book hero Harry Potter has upgraded from the
``Nimbus Two Thousand'' flying broomstick he once used. In the most
recent volume, young Potter rides a ``Firebolt,'' which, compared
with the older model, boasts ``superbly smooth action.''
</P>
<P>
   2000, some agree, isn't all it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was this nice, round number, a universal symbol that
conjured up a future we could all relate to,'' Schreuer said. After
Jan. 1, ``I don't know what the shorthand for the future is going
to be,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``2000 isn't what's relevant to people anymore,'' said Eric
Keshin, manager of the McCann-Erickson Worldwide ad agency, which
helped Gateway pick its new name.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, 2000 still has its boosters, such as software and
car companies that use it to designate model years. Other backers
include several hair salons in New England, which call themselves
Hair 2000. ``It's futuristic. It shows we're thinking ahead,''
explained John Marnelakis, who owns a Hair 2000 shop in Indian
Orchard.
</P>
<P>
   The name, he said, was partly inspired by a device called the
``Perm 2000,'' which calculated the amount of chemicals needed for
a particular customer's hair type. But many customers have
suggested he find a new commercial identity. ``They're saying I'll
be backdated,'' Marnelakis said.
</P>
<P>
   Once, there was little argument that 2000 stood for progress and
achievement. The number reached an apex in 1989, when it was used
as part of ``Goals 2000,'' an education initiative by the nation's
governors and then-president George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, 2000 seemed to represent ``something bold,''
recalled Jennifer Davis, now an aide to Mayor Thomas M. Menino and
previously a planner for the National Governors Association. ``What
we came out with had to be very high-minded and visible and
visionary. 2000 is all those things, or at least it used to be,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Doubts about ``2000's'' potential first began to emerge in 1975
when producer Roger Corman released ``Death Race 2000,'' an
unfortunate movie involving a fatal sports-car competition. Jeb
Brody, a curator at the American Museum of the Moving Image in New
York, said it was among the first films ``that didn't invoke a
Utopian feel for 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Another early skeptic was Marc Abrahams, editor of the ``Annals
of Improbable Research'' parody magazine in Cambridge. In 1994,
Abrahams began surveying his readers for mentions of 2000 and
estimates he has since received more than 10,000 nominations.
</P>
<P>
   Examples include the Ultra Gel 2000 air freshener, the Apotheke
2000 drugstore in Switzerland, the Dating 2000 service, and the
Snore Stop 2000 nose clip.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Abrahams said he is puzzled by the
popularity of the term but declined to criticize companies
specifically. ``It's minimal work and possibly maximal payback when
you slap it on,'' he said. ``And let's face it, everybody else is
doing it, too!''
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't quite the case in 1987 when American Tool Companies
Inc. of Vernon Hills, Ill., introduced the first of its ``Speedbor
2000'' drill bits. Manager John Sara said the name was picked to
suggest the product's ``futuristic'' innovations, such as a pair of
small spurs on the cutting edge. A previous bit, the Speedbor 88,
was named after an Oldsmobile.
</P>
<P>
   But now 2000's days are numbered, and American Tool plans to
phase in a version known as the ``Speedbor Lock-N-Load'' because it
is easier to change.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping the old name ``might seem seem dated, like calling it
the Speedbor 1776,'' Sara said. ``Nobody thinks about the old days
anymore.''

ALZHEIMER'S WANDERERS STIR CONCERNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALEM, N.H. _ From the warmth of her living room, while the
tangled woods outside her house become inky and icy, Julianna
Morawski is praying to St. Anthony, patron saint of lost objects.
</P>
<P>
   Morawski, who is 66, turned her back for five minutes on the
sixth of October and lost her husband into those woods. Over the
five years since Joseph Morawski began to display symptoms of
Alzheimer's disease, she had learned to play the games that kept
him within the bounds of normal life: hiding his clothes until he
bathed in the morning; coaxing him out of his daughter's leather
skirt; emptying the stones nightly from his pockets. But her
husband, who grew leaner and craftier every year after his
diagnosis, slipped out the door that day while she was hanging
laundry.
</P>
<P>
   Almost three months later, neither his family nor the local
police can bring themselves to stop looking for him, and a small
army of outside investigators have tried to solve the riddle of
Morawski's mind. Three weeks ago, when all the leaves were off the
trees, a helicopter whipped at the air over World End Pond, where,
before he disappeared, neighbors had reported seeing the
72-year-old man standing in the swamp.
</P>
<P>
   Julianna Morowski feels alone, watching night fall outside her
window, but 150 miles to the south, Massachusetts state police
helicopters were hovering over White's Woods, looking for James
Garris, an 80-year-old Alzheimer's patient who walked out of his
Litchfield, Connecticut convalescent home on July 5. Disappearances
like these repeat themselves all over the country, as Alzheimer's
patients slip out of safe enclosures into the dark with their own
mysterious agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-two thousand wandering Alzheimer's patients are now
reported to police annually, estimates Robert Koester, a Virginia
search and rescue researcher who has devoted much of the last
decade to collecting and studying their habits. There is a
particular urgency to his project: If an Alzheimer's patient is
found within 24 hours, they usually return home safe. After that,
their chances of survival fall to 46 percent, and search teams
begin to find them tangled deep in briar patches, or drowned in a
shallow trickle of water, or frozen at a fence line in an open
field.
</P>
<P>
   A small network of experts on Alzheimer's wanderers _ including
several in the Boston area _ are trying to decode the behavior
before it overtakes society's ability to find them. Already,
searches for people with dementia make up 12 percent of search and
rescue operations in the Mid-Atlantic states, according to Koester.
And as average lifespans increase and the baby boomers move toward
old age, the Alzheimer's Association projects that the number of
people with the degenerative brain disease will increase from 4
million today to 14 million in the year 2040. That burden will fall
squarely on the shoulders of local police and fire departments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, it's a time bomb,'' said Nina Silverstein, who has
researched wanderers at UMass-Boston's Gerontology Institute. ``On
the level of society, I really do beleive there's been denial.''
</P>
<P>
   Although wandering behavior is as old as dementia itself, the
disappearances have rarely been addressed as a national phenomenon,
and even advocacy groups are unable to supply mortality statistics.
Silverstein, who is collaborating with Flaherty on an upcoming book
called ``Deadly Mix: Dementia, Wandering, and the Lost Elder,'' has
attempted to compile statistics through searches in local press,
and concluded that ``any number you get will be an underestimate.''
</P>
<P>
   What search and rescue experts have begun to realize over the
last decade, as local agencies begin to compare notes on wandering
Alzheimer's patients, is that they behave very like each other, and
unlike any group of people that searchers know well. They don't
call out for help or respond to shouts; 67 percent of lost
Alzheimer's patients cross right over roads or paths and continue
in a straight line until they can't go any farther, shows Koester's
research, which is based on 100 disappearances so serious that the
Appalachian Search and Rescue Conference was called in.
</P>
<P>
   When they die _ as 22 of Koester's hundred cases did _ it's
usually at the point where they could not go farther. Eighteen
percent of his subjects were found in creek or drainage areas, and
another 29 percent were deeply entangled in briars or bushes.
Searchers sometimes find bodies in spots so dense that bloodhounds
can pass within feet of them without getting a scent, said Gerald
Flaherty, director of the Safe Return program for the Alzheimer's
Association's Massachusetts chapter, who has participated in almost
700 searches over the last eight years. Of those, about 24 were
found dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're very, very frightened, and they're trying to find a
place to hide, and they go into places that are terribly
dangerous,'' said Flaherty.
</P>
<P>
   The gradually gathering statistics portray a journey whose main
goals are primal. Koester's strangest finding was that 15 out of 19
of his subjects moved to the south. He doesn't know why this would
be, but suggests two ``working hypotheses'': it could be because
the wanderers were moving toward the light in the sky; or _ the
``less glamorous'' explanation _ it could be because in the rural
areas where Koester does his work, most of the doors face south,
and wanderers tend to move steadily in one direction.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of information hasn't always penetrated the local
agencies who do most of the searching. Curt Rudge, chief park
ranger with the Massachusetts Department of Environmental
Management, has a particular sense of urgency about training
searchers: He recalls joining a search for a missing Alzheimer's
patient that had dragged on for five days. Using Koester's
research, he directed his energies toward a thick tangle of brush.
He found the body in five hours.
</P>
<P>
   Handled chiefly on a local level, procedures for locating
wandering elderly people with dementia are ``a chink in the armor
of the system,'' he said. ``We don't do this well.''
</P>
<P>
   Silverstein also urged a national emphasis on preventive
strategies like Safe Return, which supplies identification for
elderly wanderers and enters elderly people in a national database,
she said. She also recommended that dementia sufferers be assigned
``walking buddies,'' so they can relieve their restlessness safely.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1996 paper entitled ``He Comes Back Eventually...'',
Silverstein documented the measures that elderly caregivers were
using to prevent their loved ones from escaping from their homes _
posting stop signs on doors, writing notes reminding them not to
leave, removing batteries from cars or disguising doors with
curtains. One man slept at the threshhold of the door, so he could
feel his wife stepping over him when she tried to leave. Others
sent dogs out with their relatives with the mistaken confidence
that ``the dog knows the way home.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the cost remains high, some envision a day when law
enforcement will be able to track Alzheimer's patients
individually. Spurred by a 1997 case of an 83-year-old man who
wandered away from his Strafford home, sheriffs in Vermont's
Windham and Orange Counties have begun supplying Alzheimer's
patients with tiny transmitters which emit a signal that
authorities can pick up from land or air.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the stress of controlling a chronic wanderer is
absorbed into families. Marianne Dickerman Caldwell's 83-year-old
mother disappeared into the woods near Rindge, N.H. in 1991, and it
wasn't until 1994 that hunters came across her remains. For that
time, Caldwell said, she was so fixated on the search for that a
counselor asked her to leave a grief support group because she was
upsetting the other members.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just something dreadful about being unfound and out in
the woods,'' said Caldwell, who wrote a memoir of her mother's
disappearance called ``Gone ... Without a Trace.'' ``Bed is where
people belong. Being outside with the elements _ it was so dark
that night, and it dropped 40 degrees.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are the thoughts that bother Julianna Morawski, who can
still crinkle up her eyes and laugh when she recalls meeting Joseph
for the first time, when she was a kerchiefed 21-year-old, in
Wroslaw. Lately, when she can sleep at all, she has nightmares that
she's lost herself.
</P>
<P>
   She's not the only one who can't stop thinking about it. When he
drives around the streets of Salem, Captain Alan Gould, who headed
up the search, still scans the faces of men over 65 for Morawski's
Slavic cheekbones and white fuzz of hair. He keeps a photograph. He
describes himself as ``haunted.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti _ Somehow he slept. He slept despite a
stomach-turning stench. He slept through the roar of televisions,
radios, and other prisoners yelling across the room. He slept on a
threadbare cot.
</P>
<P>
   It was a passing moment in a prison regarded as Haiti's finest,
inside a 1,200-square-foot cell where 154 prisoners are locked up
23 hours a day. They steal sleep when they can, and if they are
fortunate, like the man with his right arm over his ear and eyes,
they get to use one of the 11 beds.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds miserable, and it is, yet this is better than it was a
few years ago. Before, the prison held 400 men in a single room,
none of whom had hope of freedom without a revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies a hidden truth about Haiti today: The misery is so
profound that it often masks the signs of incremental progress as
the country tries to build a democratic and civil society from
scratch.
</P>
<P>
   Five years after 20,000 US troops invaded the nation in order to
restore a democratically elected government ousted in a military
coup, the task is increasingly being left to the Haitians
themselves. International donors are pulling back because the
crisis has passed and the results of their giving, as measured by
yardsticks used in the developed world, have been so meager.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, the largest single donor, infused more than
$2 billion in assistance to Haiti in the last four years, and it
will put up another $100 million next year. But keeping the funding
at that level in the future could prove difficult, as Republicans
in Congress have increasingly questioned whether US funds are
netting positive change.
</P>
<P>
   Haiti's prisons, long regarded as the worst in the hemisphere,
stand as a telling example of the steps already taken, and the
leaps still needed. The room stuffed with 154 prisoners, for
instance, is one of the few areas in the National Penitentiary that
has not been rebuilt. The rest were constructed with $2.4 million
in foreign funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prisons used to be a place where human beings were put and
kept like animals,'' said Jean-Paul Lupien, a Canadian prison
reform specialist who has led efforts here for the past four years.
``People would die, and no one would know. It's much better now.
It's day and night.''
</P>
<P>
   In late 1994, when the US troops landed, no one even knew how
many prisons there were under Haiti's brutal military regime. No
one had a count of the prisoners themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, authorities have completed the arduous tasks of
exploring the prisons, investigating the prisoners' cases, putting
together a bureaucratic structure, rebuilding cellblocks,
constructing infirmaries, installing pipes for water and plumbing
and wires for electricity, and then training guards. But huge
problems remain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going into jails here is still like going back to a few
centuries ago,'' said Lupien, 56, a former warden at a
medium-security prison in Cowansville, Quebec, 15 miles north of
the Vermont border.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of needed projects have not been touched. Six jails do
not have a single vehicle, so guards transport prisoners to court
on foot. One jail has no roof because the walls can not support
one. Another lockup has no walls: Freedom is a step away outside
the cellblocks.
</P>
<P>
   At the National Penitentiary in downtown Port-au-Prince, which
holds 2,040 prisoners, nearly half the population of Haiti's 19
jails, the drop in international funds is already apparent. For a
year, there has been no money to train guards, and the number of
foreign advisers working on improving the prisons has slipped from
nine to one: Lupien.
</P>
<P>
   For the next three years, he has commitments of just $422,000
toward a proposed $6 million foreign assistance package for
prisons. He fears that they will lose much of what they had gained.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are already starting to considerably slide backward now,''
he said as he walked along the national jail's two-story high
walls. ``It's particularly apparent here.''
</P>
<P>
   With agitation, he pointed out several places where things have
gotten worse, not better. Inmates lounged inside guardhouses.
Prisoners wandered into areas once off-limits. And when Lupien
entered a brand-new, three-story jailhouse that inmates have called
the Titanic, he pointed out that some cellblocks had plenty of
beds, but others did not. Rich prisoners buy mattresses from poor
inmates. The prison system does not have enough money for beds.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest problem for the prisons is outside the walls in
the form of the rest of Haiti's dysfunctional system of justice.
Some 80 percent of all prisoners have yet to be sentenced. Some are
awaiting trials four years after arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Justice Minister Camille Leblanc asked 15 civil
court judges and prosecutors to resolve all pending cases before
the end of the year. No one believed that would happen.
</P>
<P>
   Former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, in a rare interview,
said he believes it should not happen. The reason, he said, was
that the system was already riddled with corruption, and speeding
up the process risked complete collapse. One of the most pervasive
indicators of corruption has been the widespread and suspiciously
quick releases of people arrested on drug trafficking charges, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kind of corruption we have in the system is so ugly, so
rooted in the years of dictatorship,'' Aristide said in his home
office. ``It took years for the Jewish to see the light of
justice'' after the Holocaust, ``and it may take some time for
Haitians to see justice coming from the judicial system. I prefer
to go slower rather than going too fast using illegal means.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Aristide experienced bitter results when he tried to
circumvent the Haitian constitution, which was written in 1986 at
the end of the Duvalier family dictatorship. He attempted to shift
the prisons from police to civilian control, but parliament
overruled Aristide on constitutional grounds. Democracies around
the world are careful not to have police control prisons because of
the obvious conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   For prisoners, the issue of police or civilian control matters
little now. What matters is getting a court date.
</P>
<P>
   In the National Penitentiary's courtyard, one old prisoner sat
by himself. Under prison regulations, Lupien said, he shouldn't
have been there. He was Ernst Bennett, 74, the wealthy one-time
father-in-law to Jean-Claude ``Baby Doc'' Duvalier. Bennett,
attired in pressed slacks and a shirt, said he was arrested for not
paying taxes on buildings seized long ago by the government. He
laughed quietly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've waited 16 months for trial,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether if he was a political prisoner, Bennett said, ``No
comment.'' He looked away and changed the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going to Miami when I am released. I will spend one month
in Miami and then go to France. I don't have any visitors here. I
don't want any. I send somebody out to get my food. That's how I
live.''
</P>
<P>
   He lives on the top floor of the Titanic, a floor reserved for
the prison's wealthiest and most notorious inmates. Three police
officers charged with killing 11 people in May are there. A former
French soldier was in another, sharing it with five other inmates,
including Henri-Robert Laforest, who operated a security company.
He was charged with attempted murder, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am for justice for everybody,'' he said through the bars.
``I am a democrat. The system is not working. They should give
grace to 99 percent of us. Because people are here for nothing.
There's a guy who stole a bike and he's been here for three
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Lupien said the prisons will probably see a new flood of inmates
in coming years because of increases in economic crimes and
drug-related crimes. Haiti is a major transshipment point for drugs
from Colombia on their way to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   He stepped into the cell with 154 prisoners and spoke easily in
French to a few of the inmates. Chenetmu Metellus, 32, stepped
forward and welcomed the visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are one or two too many of us here,'' Metellus said, a
smile spreading across his face. He stood above the man who slept
on the prized cot. He stood above another man who slept on a sheet
on the concrete floor. The sleepers didn't stir.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sleep good, too,'' Metellus said. ``I have one of the beds.
We get into quite a few fights, though, because, you know, there
are a few of us here.''

THE SHOCK OF THE NOVEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GAIL CALDWELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a reader in
possession of time's fortune, must be in want of a novel. And so it
is that we return to that foreign country of the past, where the
nights were always dark and stormy, the dawns rosy-fingered, and
the readers gentle _ where every flight of the imagination began,
in a certain corner of la Mancha, with ``once upon a time.'' Surely
it was the best and worst of times, the season of Light and the
season of Darkness, the spring of hope and the winter of despair _
in short, the period was so far like the present period, when we
wait for the clocks to strike 13 and take us into a new age.
</P>
<P>
   Thus poised at this artificial precipice of Not Really the
Millennium, we contemplate the near-infinite bounty of our literary
history by examining the novel's extended family tree. In a
thousand years, the novel has developed from fireside diversion
into a form of such aesthetic magnitude as to define entire
cultures; in its myriad efforts to secure a particular moment in
art or history, it has on occasion transformed both. And while
happy families may all be alike, the bastards, misfits, grumpy old
aunts, wicked step-siblings, and prodigal sons that make up this
particular genealogy _ from Chaucer to hypertext _ are a far more
fascinating tribe.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is theirs exactly the saddest story I have ever heard.
Instead it is fabulous and tawdry, desultory and checkered, and the
trail it blazes through the centuries has more than its share of
breathtaking vistas. For anyone who worries from time to time that
the novel is dead or even suffering from chronic fatigue, a gaze
into the past thousand years _ however absurd or short-handed that
notion _ offers both vast perspective and enormous consolation. If
we have indeed managed to arrive here all the way from the dark,
preliterate insularity of the Middle Ages and, despite countless
efforts to destroy ourselves, lived to tell the tale, then we may
actually find a way to navigate the future.
</P>
<P>
   One may as well begin with the Battle of Hastings, which in 1066
redefined the lands and laws and language of the earth as we know
it. Much sacking and pillaging from there on out, and for a while
there was rarely the time or climatic conditions for art to
flourish. The novel, of course, was still centuries away from being
born, but its ancestral tale _ the very human notion of one's
imagination encapsulating, then superseding reality _ is at least
as old as material culture itself. (What else is a hieroglyphic or
a cave painting but a really tight plot?) Most roads in the West
lead back to the twin towers of Homer and the Bible, and so it is
with literature _ the novel, recognized in English Lit courses
across the land to have begun in 1605 with Cervantes's ``Don
Quixote,'' has its earlier roots in epic poetry and scripture. But
Chaucer, writing in the 14th century, also knew how to handle the
big scene, and his ``Canterbury Tales,'' a movable feast of
invention to rival ``The Arabian Nights,'' gave us the first
glimmers of modern character development.
</P>
<P>
   Petrarch climbed that seminal mountain just to get the view
roughly around the same time; a recorded act that, along with
Dante's ``The Divine Comedy,'' corresponds to the beginnings of an
inner life in narrative. It's simple enough to draw a timeline
linking the greats of history; more striking in some ways is to
consider what they were up against. The celebrated moments of
literature are scattered through centuries of disease, violence,
and darkness; if a man was fortunate enough to live out his life
span of 30 or 40 years, he did so within the essential realm of
trying to feed himself and his family and avoid the calamities of
plague or of being bludgeoned by his neighbor. The radius of his
entire life was tantamount to our own distance to and from Home
Depot; had he ever seen a book or known what to do with it, chances
are that it was chained to a podium, and a priest had the key.
</P>
<P>
   A man named Johannes Gutenberg changed all this, and then a man
named Martin Luther became the Johnny Appleseed of Gutenberg's
invention. Muslims had established the first known European
papermaking mill in Spain in the late 11th century, and movable
type first appeared in Korea some 50 years ahead of the West. But
when Gutenberg developed a movable-type printing press in Germany
in the 1450s, then used it to print the Bible, those actions were
far more revolutionary than any cyberhead's wildest pipe dream. The
world broke apart in 1452 or thereabouts, and despite countless
religious and political efforts to destroy what Gutenberg had
wrought _ book burnings and translation bannings and published
indexes of forbidden books _ civilization is unimaginable without
those portable pieces of metal font.
</P>
<P>
   Aesthetically and globally, we had great distances ahead. The
first grammar written in one language about another was published
in 1591, around the same time as Shakespeare's ``Henry VI''; now it
was possible to hear genius on the Elizabethan stage and also to
conceive of it in translation. Though the cost of books would
remain steep, even prohibitive, until the advent of circulating
libraries in the 18th century, at least they were no longer a
sovereign domain under holy guard.
</P>
<P>
   An indicator of the value of a commodity is a despot's attempts
to forbid it: ``A circulating library in a town,'' said one
character on the Irish stage in the 1700s, ``is an ever-green tree
of diabolical knowledge!'' The fruits remained diabolical; one of
the worst punishable acts an American slave could commit was
learning to read. But however much the ruling classes (and gender)
struggled to maintain their literary dominion, the cat was long out
of the bag. If you could think, you could learn to read, and if you
could read you could listen to the firebrands who could write. The
history of literacy is a great story of populism's triumph _ when
men and women might not only read their way into fighting for
freedom or getting the vote, but, harder to quantify, blow open the
ceilings of a fixed worldview long enough to envision something
larger.
</P>
<P>
   So this story inevitably becomes a history of consciousness,
when civilization imagined, recorded, and collaborated upon an
aesthetic conspiracy to raise the roofbeams high. Once we emerge
into the light of the 17th and early 18th centuries, culture itself
begins to accelerate: from Shakespeare and Galileo to Rembrandt,
Donne, Milton. The modern English novel slouched toward London, and
all its progenitors were in place: Swift, Pope, Pepys, Johnson,
Defoe. ``Robinson Crusoe'' in 1719; seven years later, ``Gulliver's
Travels.'' In 1740, Samuel Richardson's work as a printer inspired
him to throw aside the manual he was crafting and write ``Pamela'';
with Henry Fielding, he paved the way for the subsequent explosion
in the novel form, culminating with Sterne and then Austen. If the
first modern novels delivered a vastly imagined and populated world
with its own systemic laws and structural integrity, Jane Austen
imploded that self-contained universe _ giving us, in her ``little
bit (two Inches wide) of ivory,'' human nature itself.
</P>
<P>
   The rest, as they say, was up to God and progress, and several
volumes would be required to chart the arc of the novel over the
next two centuries. But as we craft this family portrait of the
greats at the dinner table, leave us not forget the ribald and
slovenly relatives munching on a chicken leg and stealing from the
larder; they also warrant a place at the gathering. With its wanton
lack of morals and religious instruction, the novel in its early
popular form was considered base, sentimental, and even depraved;
reading it could curdle the brain and puncture the spirit, and of
course people flocked in droves to do just that. It would take the
panoramic trinity of Dickens, Melville, and Tolstoi to elevate the
form beyond its critics and naysayers into eternal eminence; on the
other side of the horizon, Flaubert, Eliot, and James were
concerning themselves with, instead of vastness, mere perfection.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the novel's Golden Age, from ``Moby-Dick'' and
``Middlemarch'' and ``The Portrait of a Lady'' on to the rise of
the modernist masters, the wholesale enterprise of experience would
be fought over, reinterpreted, fragmented, improved upon,
transcended. Art would replace God, and the triumph of the self
would replace both; if Einstein helped to shatter the nature of
time and reality in the novel, Freud went on to have a hand in
murdering the omniscient narrator. ``Life is not a series of gig
lamps symmetrically arranged,'' Virginia Woolf wrote famously in
1919, ``but a luminous halo, a semi-transparent envelope
surrounding us from the beginning of consciousness to the end. . .
. Let us record the atoms as they fall upon the mind in the order
in which they fall.'' She could have been describing ``Ulysses,''
``Absalom, Absalom!'' or her own ``To the Lighthouse,'' all of
which appeared, a few years later and from three different
countries, within time's mere gasp of one another.
</P>
<P>
   Until a century ago, it used to be said, a reader could make do
with a library consisting of no more than 500 books _ all of which,
it must be added, had to be the right 500 books, a decree of
election which itself has come under fire in recent years. However
great the temptation to rue the passing of that era, with all its
towering novelistic edifices of strength and splendor, those salad
days (both safe and certain, in retrospect) are irrefutably behind
us.
</P>
<P>
   We are left instead with the particular beauties of the
contemporary novel, as well as the cruelties peculiar to the age _
among them, an infinite cyber-strip-mall where anyone can publish
anything, in a world where meaning itself threatens to lose its
meaning. But as long as human consciousness draws breath, there
will be plenty of souls who long for that essential journey that
the novel has always promised; for this abiding reason, there will
always be a story to be told, and someone whose life work will be
to tell it. And the novel itself, that wily old witness, lurks
patiently in the wings and listens for its cue. So yes, says the
novel, waiting to be born: yes I said yes I will Yes.

ROCK'S UNDERGROUND BREAKS THROUGH AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   How different these year-end stories would be if the rain had
poured at Woodstock '99. A storm missed the Woodstock concert site
by just a few miles during the closing set by the Red Hot Chili
Peppers, thus enabling some rowdies to set fires that would have
been impossible to start had rain dampened the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, we have endless stories about how Woodstock's
peace-and-love era went up in flames, replaced by anger over
expensive bottles of water and food (not everything was
high-priced, though cynics would have you believe that). Promoters
caught blame, and so did the fans and bands smeared by association.
That was particularly true for easily targeted acts like Rage
Against the Machine, prompting Rage guitarist Tom Morello to decry
the ``horrific youth-bashing'' that took place after Woodstock.
Rarely have so many been blamed for the actions of so few.
</P>
<P>
   Rock has been in retreat from the media ever since, but you know
what? Rock had an incredible comeback year _ regaining a sense of
rebellion that many feared was lost, and stealing thunder from the
rappers who thought they held the cutting edge. Sales figures this
year showed a dramatic increase for rock as albums by Rage Against
the Machine, Korn, Limp Bizkit, and others shot to No. 1 in their
first week.
</P>
<P>
   Rock's underground became mainstream _ and shook up the
establishment in the process.
</P>
<P>
   What better example than the ``guerrilla tour'' by Limp Bizkit,
which previewed its new album with a week of unlicensed,
police-baiting shows. This included a late-afternoon sneak concert
on a rooftop in Kenmore Square, where several thousand fans, after
hearing an announcement on WAAF (107.3 FM) just minutes before,
caught Bizkit rocking hard for 20 minutes before Boston police shut
them down. The band had hired a private security team to monitor
the crowd (and the moshers), so the scene wasn't as reckless as the
police might have thought. Score a definite victory for the people
_ and a connection to earlier days, when the Beatles played on a
roof in London and U2 did the same in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Not that all of this year's breakthrough bands were saints. Far
from it. Korn wallowed in angst, Bizkit had a misogynist streak,
and Kid Rock never met a swear word he didn't like. But in their
updating of rock, often with mind-searing guitars and a streetwise
rap element, they made some of the most exciting music of the year.
You might not have been able to dance to it all the time, but its
in-your-face roar and unsettling lyrics reminded listeners of what
rock was always about.
</P>
<P>
   Hard-rocking bands multiplied in this pedal-to-the-metal
millennial year _ Godsmack, Buckcherry, Creed, Sevendust, Staind,
Oleander, System of a Down, Static-X, they just kept coming. And
many of these grew by word of mouth, just as the neohippie trend
developed such stars as the Dave Matthews Band (the only act to
play two nights at Foxboro Stadium this year) and New England's
Phish.
</P>
<P>
   The most meaningful band of the year, by far, was Rage Against
the Machine, which restored a political purpose to the music. They
rapped and raged about economic oppression, racial prejudice, and
Third World abuse _ a stunning troika that was matched only by the
ferocity of the music.
</P>
<P>
   The most meaningful solo artist of the year was Bruce
Springsteen, who proved that loyalty still exists in the crazy
market-driven mess known as today's music. Whether fans will follow
Rage, Korn, and Bizkit in 10 years remains to be seen. But
Springsteen's fans rallied to see him in unprecedented numbers.
Five sold-out shows at the FleetCenter? No problem. And his fifth
show at the Fleet was the best show I heard all year. He went for
broke and got there, while his E Street Band colleagues were right
with him. Brotherhood revived _ and sisterhood, too, considering
how well Springsteen's wife, Patti Scialfa, performed that night.
</P>
<P>
   OK, there was a lot not to like in 1999, too. Corporate mergers
induced a malaise, as many bands were dropped and many labels
folded into others _ such as Salem's feisty Rykodisc, which had to
relocate to New York under the wing of the Palm Pictures label run
by Chris Blackwell.
</P>
<P>
   And what can you say about the spread of watered-down,
hunk-du-jour teeny-bop bands? The two best-selling recording acts
were Britney Spears and the Backstreet Boys, whose albums both
topped 9 million sales. The backlash was best expressed by punk
rockers the Offspring, whose spirited Woodstock show was capped by
the singer clubbing life-size balloon replicas of the Backstreet
Boys as the crowd howled.
</P>
<P>
   It was a year of digital downloading and on-line retail gains, a
year of revivals (the J. Geils Band stood out), a year of sadness
(the tragic death of Morphine's Mark Sandman in Italy), of great
tour packages (Paul Simon with Bob Dylan and Emmylou Harris with
Linda Ronstadt), of Latin stars new and old (Ricky Martin and
Carlos Santana), of posthumous rap albums (another by the Notorious
B.I.G.), of gospel going mainstream (a great FleetCenter show by
the Rev. Kirk Franklin), of classic entertainers returning (Bette
Midler was never funnier), of emerging Boston acts (Godsmack,
Guster, Susan Tedeschi, the Push Stars, Mr. Lif), and of continued
high ticket prices ($300 to see the Stones at the FleetCenter).
</P>
<P>
   But despite merger mania and ample greed from the corporate
offices down to the dressing rooms, there was still enough street
cred to suggest hope for the future.
</P>
<P>
   R.I.P.: Gwen Guthrie, Charles Brown, Dusty Springfield, Lowell
Fulson, Skip Spence, Roger Troutman, Bruce Fairbairn, Augustus
Pablo, Lord Sutch, Dennis Brown, Mark Sandman, Guy Mitchell, Anita
Carter, Roy Wiggins, Bobby Sheehan, Brewer Phillips, Beau Jocque,
Katie Webster, Hoyt Axton, Donald Mills, Lester Bowie, Doug Sahm,
Rick Danko, Hank Snow.

THE LITTLE DVD TRIGGERS A BIG REVOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL BLOWEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This year signaled the beginning of the end for VHS, and the
celebration of the DVD as the home-video force for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   The digital video disc has exploded on the market. The sharp,
clear video and CD quality sound, combined with extra features such
as multilingual tracks and discussions of the films by stars and
directors, has reinvigorated the home-video industry. Unlike many
technical advances that simply gouge the consumer, this little disc
is worth every penny. Business is so big, with retail and Internet
sales, that no one is exactly sure how many DVDs have been sold to
date. Estimates range from a low of 18 million to a high of 44
million. One thing is certain _ the reproduction houses can't keep
up with demand and orders for many ``available'' titles are
backlogged for weeks. Orders for new discs are backed up at least
six months for independents and even the major studios must use
their considerable clout to get their discs released in a timely
manner. Macrovision, the company responsible for encoding discs
with anti-piracy devices, estimates that by the end of 2000 more
than 10 million DVD players will be in service.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest news of the year was the release of the Stanley
Kubrick Collection through a cooperative arrangement among MGM,
Warner Bros., and Columbia. Kubrick is one of the few directors
whose work is immeasurably enhanced by the quality that DVD brings
to motion pictures. The set comprises ``Lolita'' (1962), ``Dr.
Strangelove'' (1964), ``2001: A Space Odyssey'' (1968), ``Barry
Lyndon'' (1975), ``A Clockwork Orange'' (1971), ``The Shining''
(1980), and ``Full Metal Jacket'' (1987). Even though this was the
video release event of the year, it's not perfect. The titles don't
include the ancillary features associated with DVD, and some of the
prints, particularly ``The Shining,'' don't look as if they were
remastered. But that's nitpicking. Seeing ``Barry Lyndon'' again in
a brilliant print illuminates Kubrick's masterful adaptation of the
Thackeray novel in which atmosphere and tone take center stage. The
black-and-white imagery from ``Dr. Strangelove'' is unparalleled
and ``A Clockwork Orange'' is even more frightening today then when
it was first released.
</P>
<P>
   While ``Arlington Road'' may not make a Top 10 movies list, it's
one of the best DVDs because star Jeff Bridges and director Mark
Pellington actually question judgments they made. Instead of
perceiving the commentary track as a way of rewriting history and
self-promotion, they deal with how they could have made a better
film. Their honesty and openness is rare.
</P>
<P>
   There was such a controversy about the final release print of
``Brazil'' that Terry Gilliam considered having his name removed
from the credits. After numerous articles and a book detailing his
war with Universal, the documentary ``The Battle of `Brazil,' ''
included in the three-disc Criterion Collection set, is a
magnificent document for the art vs. commerce debate that is staged
every day in Hollywood. While some might say that Gilliam's film
doesn't deserve this much attention, it does. Ironically, one of
the great themes of his film is interference by a totalitarian
force _ precisely the issue raised by the film's original release
in 1985. The details are so precise that a college film teacher
could wrap an entire course around the ``Brazil'' DVD.
</P>
<P>
   Director Roman Polanski, producer Robert Evans, and screenwriter
Robert Towne contribute useful information about the making of
``Chinatown'' (1974). It's too bad they couldn't persuade star Jack
Nicholson to contribute because that's just what's needed to
complete the story. However, as it is, the remastered print is as
good as it gets.
</P>
<P>
   Laurence Olivier's ``Henry V'' (1943) is breathtaking on DVD.
The remastered Technicolor print does full justice to the
actor-director's spectacular adaptation of Shakespeare's intimate
epic. The Battle of Agincourt sequences vibrate with pageantry and
color while Olivier never loses sight of the play's intimacy.
``Henry V'' makes a great double bill with ``Shakespeare in Love.''
The latter, aside from crisp images, has some useful extras,
including biographical information about Shakespeare and some sharp
insights from Oscar-winning screenwriter Tom Stoppard.
</P>
<P>
   While Frank Capra made better pictures than ``Lost Horizon''
(1937), none of them will be better served on DVD than his
adaptation of James Hilton's classic novel. Film historian Robert
Gitt and critic Charles Champlin make for lively companions on the
DVD's alternate track. Don't confuse this one with the dismal 1973
musical remake.
</P>
<P>
   The three best animation DVDs are ``Pinocchio'' (1937), ``A
Bug's Life'' (1998), and ``Gulliver's Travels'' (1939). While the
Disney ``Pinocchio'' lacks the behind-the-scenes add-ons that would
enhance its educational and entertainment value, there's no
mistaking the brilliant drawings that are enhanced by the DVD
format. It's fascinating to put some of the detailed images on
pause/still, the better to appreciate the artistry of the
animators. ``Gulliver's Travels'' was the best animated film ever
released by Paramount Pictures. Directed by Dave Fleischer, this
adaptation retains the Swiftian tone, which should appeal to fans
of satire, and the sense of drama generated by Gulliver's
adventures. Great for the whole family. Eventually, ``A Bug's
Life'' will be seen in the same classical light as ``Pinocchio''
and ``Gulliver.'' Aside from a great explanation of special
effects, ``A Bug's Life'' also includes ``Geri's Game,'' a short
subject also produced by the folks at Pixar.

WELCOME, AMERICA, TO YOUR POST-BEIGE WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JAIMEE ROSE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
PHOENIX - The real trouble of the year Two Thousand is the tired,
bland-chicken, dusty-beige realization that we're facing The Future
and we've been beaten by our own cartoon.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Because meet George Jetson.
</P>
<P>
   And get over his flying car.
</P>
<P>
   And, while you're at it, get over his thinking computer and his
meals-in-a-pill. Because ``The Jetsons'' is what we wanted, but
``The Simpsons'' is all we've got.
</P>
<P>
   We wanted a world of purple spacestations in the sky with
aerodynamic curves that looked like Mr. Spacely designed them.
</P>
<P>
   We have a world of beige stucco suburbs and Homer Simpson as our
national icon, who is appreciative of the flying saucer shape only
because it looks like a jelly doughnut.
</P>
<P>
   We can't be the futuristic cartoon, so we've decided to look
like it instead.
</P>
<P>
   Our computers don't think, but Apple's iMac computer looks as
though we could confide in it. Our cars don't fly, but we'd expect
to see Astro hanging out the curvaceous windows of the new
Volkswagen Beetle. The blue M&AMP;M isn't a meal in a candy-coated
pill, but in 1995, the little sucker ousted beige from the M&AMP;M bag.
</P>
<P>
   The iMac, new Beetle, the blue M&AMP;M: Welcome to the new
post-beige America. You might want to paint your house.
</P>
<P>
   When the new Beetle hit the streets in 1998, everyone was crazy
for it; there weren't enough of them; and a besotted woman in Ohio
even trailed a Beetle transport truck until it stopped and then
bought one on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   People were willing to pay double. There were fights at the
dealerships. There was even Beetle scalping.
</P>
<P>
   It was a hip, curvy, friendly little number that came in lemon
yellow and even had a bud vase on the dash.
</P>
<P>
   It was old and new at the same time, rooted in the past with all
the security that brought, but its shape announced The Future (in
case we weren't sure). This made us feel comfortable, yet confident
that surely we were evolving as a people.
</P>
<P>
   The professionals, such as Margaret Walch, director of the Color
Association in New York City, agree. (These are the people who
track and dictate fashionable colors, the ones that turned the
world teal green, the folks who tell us we can't have gold because
it's a silver year.)
</P>
<P>
   ``This roundness is a part of the whole fascination with the
'50s and those amoeboid-like shapes. It has to do with that revival
feeling,'' she says. ``But we're also trying to go forward. There's
a lot in the past that we want to take along with us, and the
future's unknown, so we go slowly into it.''
</P>
<P>
   We certainly didn't go slowly into the iMac, which hit the
country just months after the Beetle.
</P>
<P>
   It debuted in the stores at 8 a.m. on a Sunday and sold out by
9. It was cheap and round and came in bright blue, ``Bondi blue,''
named after the waters off Bondi Beach in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Apple formally christened it blueberry. The company wanted us to
think of fruit, and not beige, camel, taupe or off-white. (Now, we
even have it in raspberry, tangerine, grape and lime.)
</P>
<P>
   The iMac instantly was compared with the Beetle by salivating
writers at the ``Washington Post,'' ``Time`` magazine, even
Salon.com. They called it a gumdrop, a gummy bear, the Bondi blue
bubble that replaced the beige box.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fast Company'' just wanted to tickle it under its chin.
</P>
<P>
   The iMac sold more than 2 million models in its first year. Most
of the time, it was the top-selling computer in America.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of hours were spent trying to figure this out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time'' considered postmodernism, that esoteric catchall phrase
for things we know are now!, but don't quite understand.
</P>
<P>
   So ``Time'' asked Steve Jobs, the chief guy at Apple:
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you call it postmodern?''
</P>
<P>
   Nope.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call it post-beige.''
</P>
<P>
   And when Jobs told lead iMac designer Jonathan Ive (he used to
do toilets) what he wanted for the iMac, it was this: He wanted the
computer the Jetsons would use.
</P>
<P>
   Even before that, though, before beige was nixed in computers
and cars, we wanted it out of our candy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, M&AMP;M/Mars decided to have a public poll. Should the tan
M&AMP;M, a part of the ``plain'' mix since 1949, live on?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the least likely color to be popular,'' said Marilyn
Bertille, M&AMP;M talkie.
</P>
<P>
   Four percent of voters said tan should stay. Fifty-four percent
said it would be better in blue.
</P>
<P>
   So that was the end of beige in the bag, and the Empire State
Building in New York City was illuminated in blue for one evening
to honor the occasion. &QL; 
All of this because we're bored with beige.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been beiged to death,'' says Walch, that woman behind
teal. ``It's boring. It's grandma's stocking color. In an era of
complication, it is too simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an era of great specificity, it just doesn't tell you
much.''
</P>
<P>
   This holy post-beige trinity makes us feel connected to the
things we rely on most in a complicated, rush-hour online world:
cars, computers, candy from the vending machine.
</P>
<P>
   Take Sam, a man in Sydney, Australia, who logged onto Apple.com
to confess that his green iMac makes him do something that's maybe
about connecting, or maybe just weird.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll let you in on a secret,'' Sam Icklow wrote. `` Every time
I sit down in front of my lime little wonder, I sit for a second
and reach out and touch it. Yum.''
</P>
<P>
   (That ``yum'' is because the iMac looks like candy, and that's
because designer Jonathan Ive actually inteviewed candymakers to
make sure he got the translucence just right.)
</P>
<P>
   Jill Morton, a Hawaii-based color consultant, says that Sam's
reaction really isn't that far off (or far out).
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to live in a colorful world, but now we live in
offices,'' Morton says. ``iMac colors make you feel like you don't
have to be a technophobe anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   They also make you feel unique, because color says something
about you that beige doesn't. Perhaps we're beginning to tire of
the Gap's khaki country, of Calvin Klein's minimalism, and of
having to choose among taupe, buff, putty, light brown, mocha,
linen and almond (or camel, toast, sand, stone, oatmeal, ecru and
bone).
</P>
<P>
   We're maybe tired of listening to Donna Karan tell about how
everyone in New York wears black, when we just want to be like
California.
</P>
<P>
   Everything colorful starts in California. For that is where Cher
is. Yes, if post-beige were a person, it would be Cher, rooted in
the past but imminently futuristic. If it were a pizza, they'd
serve it, cheeseless, at one of Wolfgang Puck's restaurants (this
is about being different). If it were a film, it would be ``Being
John Malkovich'' (this is also about being postmodern).
</P>
<P>
   If post-beige were on the shelves at Target, it would be Sony's
transparent blue CD player. In fact, so many things on the shelves
right now are, at their heart, post-beige: the Nokia cellular phone
with removable, colorful covers; printers in Bondi blue; scanners
in clear lime green.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone wants things that create an illusion of a desk, a
street, maybe even a world that is friendly, warm and fuzzy,
because what is color if not good cheer?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, along with the Jetsons, we're missing the fuzzy, friendly
days of the Beatles and the Yellow Submarine, the days when we were
in love with Jerry Garcia (who never was neutral).
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we miss the times before Jerry and the Jetsons faded into
the khakis and camouflage of the Vietnam War, when we struggled
with ourselves, against ourselves, fighting a dusty, impenetrable
cloud of dead soldiers and government distrust that descended over
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   (That cloud has only been eclipsed by a new generation that
can't understand, or care, really, how it got there in the first
place.)
</P>
<P>
   So maybe post-beige is really just a fun trend, but maybe it's
actually a call for peace. Maybe the new, colorful America is the
signal of a renaissance, a coming together of a nation that's
celebrating the possibilities of a new century and a new president
and a new color palette.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we'll even catch up to the Jetsons, because what is a zero
if not a fresh start?
</P>
<P>
   And in 2000, we've got three. &QL;

INVESTOR'S EXPECTATIONS ARE TOO HIGH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am 58 with 25 years on my job. I am faced with an option to
retire. I have approximately $300,000 in my company's pension plan,
and another $300,000 in my 401(k). Of the latter, approximately
$50,000 is in Allstate and Sears common stock. I would like to know
where I can put the money at a low risk that will give me at least
a 10 percent to 15 percent return until I am 59 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   R.B., Wiggins, Miss. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I hate to be a grouch, especially at this time of year, but
there is no such thing as a low-risk investment that will deliver
at least 10 percent to 15 percent annual returns.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in normal historical investment climates, people who
aim for just 15 percent returns, disregarding the ``at least,'' are
usually regarded as speculators who are willing to assume high
risks for the prospect of getting to their target.
</P>
<P>
   I don't want to bawl you out too much: My mailbag recently has
been full of letters from people who don't take a historical
perspective of the market and who are counting on handsome
double-digit investment returns for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that we are now in one of the greatest bull markets
of our nation's economic history. The equally inexorable fact is
that eventually this will come to an end, and investors will once
again set their sights on targets in the 8 percent to 10 percent
range, knowing that even those goals will involve shouldering
market risk.
</P>
<P>
   End of lecture.
</P>
<P>
   If you have an 18-month investment time frame, I would advise
that you put the lion's share of your money in conservative
fixed-income holdings, ranging from money market funds and CDs at
the most cautious to GNMA and other US government securities funds
at the most aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   You wouldn't even come close to the level of returns you mention
_ probably a return in the area of 6 percent to 6.5 percent would
be more likely. But it would be fairly low-risk.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My wife and I are both 30 and have saved $31,000 and $7,000
respectively in our 401(k) plans. We also have $10,000 in an IRA
account from my wife's previous job. All of these are invested in
various stock funds with the exception of $6,000 worth of AT&AMP;T
stock. For non-retirement savings, we have $45,000 in Fidelity's
U.S. Government Reserves, which we want to keep for emergencies
that may arise because of rental properties. Our annual earnings
are about $100,000, and we plan to put $10,000 a year into our
401(k) plans until retiring at age 60. Assuming an 8 percent return
on our retirement investments and a 5 percent return on our
non-retirement savings, how much will we have saved at age 60?
Also, we are expecting a baby. If we invested $2,000 a year in a
Roth IRA that was invested in an aggressive mutual fund, what would
be the accumulation in 18 years? Can you recommend an aggressive
fund?
</P>
<P>
   L.M., Shrewsbury, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. If you continue with monthly contributions of $833.33 to your
401(k) plans for 30 years, the accumulation (including the funds in
your IRA) would amount to $1,656,938 after 30 years of growth at an
8 percent average rate of return.
</P>
<P>
   As for your emergency savings, that account would grow to
$194,487 after 30 years with 5 percent growth and no contributions.
Of course, if you continue putting 10 percent of your earnings into
your retirement savings, the contributions would advance each time
you got a raise, and the accumulation would be likely to be much
greater.
</P>
<P>
   Why is this important? Because that grand total of $1,851,425
would have the buying power of a little less than $660,000 in
today's money if inflation averages at 3.5 percent during those 30
years. So it's important that even if you don't save more that you
do maintain savings as a percentage of earnings rather than at a
flat dollar level.
</P>
<P>
   The simple answer to your question about the Roth IRA is that if
you made $2,000 annual contributions to a fund that generated
average returns of 10 percent for 18 years, you would accumulate
$95,377.
</P>
<P>
   Since you juxtapose that question with the happy news that you
are expecting a child, I am thinking that you are considering this
as an investment vehicle for a child's educational savings account.
</P>
<P>
   But when the child is 18 you will be only 48 years old _ 10 1/2
years before you can take distributions from a Roth IRA without
taxes and penalties. So you would be better off keeping such
savings in a taxable account in your own names.
</P>
<P>
   If I were looking for an aggressive investment with an 18-year
time frame, I would pick Fidelity Specialized Health Care fund for
the purpose. If I were being a little less aggressive, because it's
never a good idea to put all of your eggs in one speculative
basket, I'd put half in the health care fund and the rest in a
Standard &AMP; Poor's index fund.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am 65 and plan to work another five years. I take home
about $3,200 a month after various deductions, including
contributions to various pension, savings, and deferred
compensation plans. I have no more wife or dependent kids at home.
At retirement, I would have about $1,100 a month from Social
Security, another $1,100 a month from my current pension account,
and a military pension of $800. I have the opportunity to buy in
some additional retirement years by adding $1,300 a month to my
defined benefit pension account. The effect of this would be to
increase my pension benefit by $1,000 a month at age 70. Are there
other equally safe investments which will return the same or
greater benefit at less cost?
</P>
<P>
   B.C., Santa Anita, Calif. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, let's look at what would happen if you went it on your
own, investing $1,300 a month for five years. If you achieved
average annual returns of 8 percent, you would amass $94,876. The
figure would be lower if you withdrew funds from the account to
deal with the tax liabilities that resulted from it.
</P>
<P>
   But if you paid the taxes from other funds, what would the
$94,876 then bring you? If it were then invested in a fixed-income
account, earning average returns of 6.5 percent, you could withdraw
$1,000 a month for a little less than 11 years before the account
went dry.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, we should examine that assumption of 8 percent returns.
We have been experiencing a bull market of almost unprecedented
scope. It seems likely that it will soon end, so I would be loath
to suggest that an expectation of 8 percent returns over the
relatively short-term period of five years is something that you
should bank on.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, by investing in the pension, you won't have
to worry about markets or taxes, and you will be assured from the
start what the benefit will be. The only question that remains is
whether you will live long enough to take financial advantage of
the benefit you will have earned.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, investing in the improved pension is a bet that you
will live long enough to take out more than $130,000 from this
segment of the pension.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, if you take the route of investing on your own, you
are not only placing the bet that your investments will earn good
returns, but you're betting against yourself _ you're effectively
betting that you will die before depleting the fund, and, unlike
the pension, the balance of the money will go to your estate.
</P>
<P>
   I don't like the idea of a person betting against himself,
especially if the payoff requires his or her early demise, so I am
in favor of investing in the higher pension. I know the actuaries
will say I'm wrong, that on average people retiring at 70 can
expect to live about nine more years. But who cares about averages?
</P>
<P>
   Consider how you'd feel if you went with the independent
investment plan and found yourself at age 81, taking a
$1,000-a-month hit to your income stream, which doubtless would
already have felt the pinch of inflation? The pension is certain,
and that's the path I suggest you take.

<P>
   Of the four leading candidates for president, three have thus
far run basically positive campaigns. Republicans John McCain and
George W. Bush are content to talk mostly about their own views and
vision, as is Democrat Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Not so Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Since Bradley pulled abreast of Vice President Gore in New
England, Gore has transformed his campaign into a gattling gun
aimed at the former New Jersey senator.
</P>
<P>
   A tough campaign isn't necessarily a bad campaign, of course,
provided a candidate's charges are accurate and reasonable. But
after two recent nationally televised Democratic debates, a viewer
has to wonder if Gore is more intent on gamesmanship than on
discussing the issues.
</P>
<P>
   It's Bradley's ambitious health care plan that Gore has targeted
most tenaciously. It's one thing to argue that the billions Bradley
would devote to health care are better spent on other priorities
such as education. But Gore has hardly contented himself with that
argument. Instead, he has cast his rival's plan as arrant folly,
saying, by turns, that it would endanger Medicare, desert Medicaid
recipients, ``shred the social safety net,'' spend the country into
deficit, and send us into recession.
</P>
<P>
   That's less an explanation of difference than a prediction of
disaster. So what do health care specialists think of those
charges? The answers do not bode well for the Gore campaign. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Cost &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One key point of contention between the two camps is whether
Bradley's plan is affordable. He estimates the price tag at $55
billion to $65 billion a year, or as much as $650 billion over 10
years. The Gore campaign, relying on the estimate of former Clinton
administration member Kenneth Thorpe, now a professor of public
health at Emory University, says the plan will cost $1.05 trillion
over a decade. (Gore's plan, Thorpe says, would cost $312 billion
over 10 years.)
</P>
<P>
   Specialists aligned with neither camp say the actual cost will
probably be significantly higher than Bradley's estimate, but
considerably lower than what Gore charges. Professor William Hsiao,
director of the Center for Health Care Financing at the Harvard
School of Public Health, says his own examination of Bradley's plan
leads him to think it will probably cost about $85 billion a year,
or $850 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is a workable plan and a realistic plan,'' says
Hsiao, who served as an actuarial specialist on Medicare in the
Nixon administration and has advised the House Ways and Means
Committee and the Senate Finance Committee on Medicaid and
Medicare. And as for Gore's criticisms?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is all a political game,'' said Hsiao. ``The vice
president does not think there is sufficient political will for a
major initiative in health, but a significant portion of Democratic
voters are in favor of something like this, so he has to undermine
it.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Economic disaster &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of all Gore's claims, perhaps none is as troubling as his charge
that Bradley's plan would spend the nation back into deficit,
occasion an increase in interest rates, and thus drive us into
recession. Is Bradley's plan a Trojan Horse that will end the
economic boom?
</P>
<P>
   Exceedingly unlikely, economists and specialists say.
</P>
<P>
   One well-known federal budget authority, who would speak only on
condition of anonymity to avert being caught in partisan
cross-fire, says the program cost has to be measured against the
total budget and gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say it costs $900 billion over 10 years,'' he says.
``That's $90 billion a year in a budget of $1.8 (trillion) to $2
trillion in a total economy of about $10 trillion. The budget and
the economy could absorb that very easily.''
</P>
<P>
   But make no mistake, Bradley's program is expensive. Certainly
it would take up most, if not all, of the currently projected
surplus for the next 10 years. That's why it is a legitimate
political issue to question whether the country should devote that
much money to health care or to point out that Bradley will have
less for other priorities, be they education or Medicare or tax
cuts, says Roger Porter, a senior economic policy adviser under
Presidents Reagan and Bush and now director of the Kennedy School's
Center for Business and Government.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bradley's program ``would not, however, be likely to have
a major effect on short-term interest rates or to plunge the
economy into recession,'' Porter says.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Reischauer, former director of the Congressional Budget
Office and now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution,
concurs. ``I think it is going to cost more than Bradley has set
aside, but it won't spend us into recession,'' he says.
``Recessions are very rarely caused by excess government
spending.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, should revenues keep showing the healthy growth of the
last few years, ``there will be more than enough money to go around
for competing priorities,'' Reischauer says.
</P>
<P>
   But even if all the new spending came as deficit spending _
which is highly unlikely _ there is no logical link to a recession.
</P>
<P>
   Any increase in interest rates would simply counterbalance the
economic stimulus the new spending added to the economy, says Roger
Brinner, managing director and chief economist at the Parthenon
Group, a Boston-based management consultant and investment firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is really a short-circuited piece of logic to say the
economy would go into recession because interest rates went up,
because they would just be bringing the economy back to the glide
path the Federal Reserve wants for . . . growth in the first
place,'' said Brinner. ``They would be an offset to the stimulus
effect.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Quality &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A new Gore tactic that emerged in the debates is an attempt to
blur the largest issue difference with Bradley by asserting that
he, Gore, also wants universal health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in favor of universal health care,'' the vice president
saidduring the rivals' ``Nightline'' encounter. Or, as he put it
during their ``Meet the Press'' exchange: ``Both Bill and I have
the same goal, to get to universal health insurance.'' That's a
claim that puts the vice president in the odd position of
supporting in principle what he opposes in fact.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Gore might say, the differences between the two men are
real. The Consumers Union, the nonprofit group that publishes
Consumer Reports magazine, has done a detailed analysis of both
Bradley's plan, which centers on sliding-scale federal subsidies to
individuals for health plans, and Gore's smaller proposal, which
calls for expanding the federal Children's Health Insurance
Program, or CHIP, to cover all children and more parents, and to
offer partial tax credits to both small businesses and uninsured
workers to encourage the purchase of health coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The nonpartisan consumer group looked at eight aspects:
commitment to universality of care, progress toward insuring all
children, plans for Medicare prescription drugs, other changes to
improve Medicare, the promotion of consumer-friendly market
measures, equitable tax policy to finance health care, incremental
improvement to the health care system, and realistic cost estimates
and financing plans.
</P>
<P>
   The results? Consumers Union judged Bradley's plan superior in
seven of the eight categories. Gore's health care proposal was
viewed as better only in strengthening Medicare beyond the
prescription drug benefit both candidates have proposed.
</P>
<P>
   Gail Shearer, director of health policy analysis for CU's
Washington office, says Bradley's plan needs some tuning to ensure
that the subsidies it provides can replace Medicaid _ and help
families moving off Medicaid keep coverage _ but says Gore's
charges that Medicaid recipients ``will be left out in the cold''
is unfair. Actually, his plan would probably insure more minorities
than Gore's plan, her analysis found.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some concerns, but Gore overstates those concerns,''
Shearer says. ``When Bradley is talking about giving low-income
people a benefit like what federal employees and members of
Congress have, I don't think it is fair to call that being left out
in the cold.'' Further, Shearer says the very fact that the Clinton
administration put together a plan for universal health care in
1993, in a time of large deficits, undermines Gore's argument that
such a plan is impossible now, in a time of large surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   As for progress toward insuring the uncovered, even the Thorpe
analysis Gore cites to his advantage says Bradley's plan would
cover 3 million more people than Gore's. Meanwhile, a new analysis
by two Harvard and Stanford specialists who advised Bradley on his
plan concludes that it will cover 30 million previously uninsured
people, while Gore's will reach 7 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, that sounds about right,'' says Shearer. ``Bradley's
plan includes deep subsidies, so it will have a major impact.''
</P>
<P>
   And as for Gore's proposal? ``I am glad he is talking about
universality,'' says Shearer, ``but his plan really doesn't go far
toward that goal.''
</P>
<P>
   It's that same sort of continuing gap between rhetoric and
reality that has led to questions about Gore's commitment to an
honest discussion of the issues.
</P>
<P>
   For all the candidates' talk about offering a positive vision, a
``say anything'' campaign which assumes that truth is expendable _
and that people are more easily swayed by exaggeration and
distortion _ reflects a politics-as-usual approach, not a
commitment to enlightened debate.

<P>
   AMHERST, N.H. _ Nobody in this quiet New England town square
could ignore Steve Forbes when he dropped by one recent day. He
bounded off a big, blue bus with ``Stars and Stripes Forever''
blaring, burst into the village market with a media gaggle, and
baffled a couple of customers who weren't expecting a presidential
candidate in the produce aisle.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the one shopper who stopped to make small talk, the
townsfolk migit not have noticed that Forbes's wife, Sabina, was in
tow. She was the unassuming woman waithng outside, the
silver-haired one wearing sensible shoes and a slightly pained
expression that pleaded for permission to reboard the bus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Campaigning isn't tough _ it's really a wonderful thing to
do,'' Sabina Forbes said unconvincingly in her low, gravelly voice.
``Last time, I was scared to come out. You know, I'd only ever been
a mom.''
</P>
<P>
   Wife, mother, homemaker, helpmate: Examine the field of spouses
behind the GOP presidential candidates this season and you won't
find a single career woman like Elizabeth Dole or a Hillary Rodham
Clinton powerhouse. ``Supportive wife'' may sound retro to some,
but Laura Bush, Cindy McCain, Carol Bauer, and Sabina Forbes are
making it a mantra in their husbands' campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes, who could hardly pry the notoriously private
Sabina (pronounced Sa-BYE-na) off their 500-acre New Jersey estate
in 1996, is pitching family values this time and has coaxed his
wife, the mother of five girls, onto the bus. George W. Bush, John
McCain, and Gary Bauer also are drawing their reluctant mates into
the spotlight _ not in the old-fashioned form of silent,
stand-beside-me props, but as spokeswomen for strong families,
partners in healthy marriages, and character witnesses to model
husbands and fathers.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush, 53, a self-described introvert who quit her job as a
librarian when she married, has become a secret weapon in the Texas
governor's campaign. In solo appearances at schools, businesses,
house parties, and women's clubs in early primary states, Mrs. Bush
is quietly affirming her husband's faithfulness (they have been
married 22 years), fathering skills (they have 17-year-old twin
daughters), and discipline and depth (she said he reads in bed,
every night).
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider myself blessed to be George's partner in life,'' a
poised Laura Bush told an adoring group of GOP women in Nashua
recently. ``Marrying him was probably the smartest political move I
ever made.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to the Arizona senator call his wife, Cindy McCain, a
star. Exquisitely turned out and as candid and chatty as her
husband, Mrs. McCain, 45, has managed to overcome her allergy to
Washington politics and to calm her separation anxiety (it helps to
send video e-mails home to her four school-age children, she said),
and now she is a fixture in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In an hourlong interview, Cindy McCain talked about McCain's
alleged violent temper (``I have never seen it. . . . My husband is
a gentleman''); his prisoner-of-war expdrience in North Vietnam
(``This man has truly been tested''); and his reaction to her
three-year addiction to prescription painkillers, which she kept
secret from McCain until 1993, when she was one year into recovery
(``I didn't want to fail him . . . but he was and is my best
support.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never met anybody as unique and inspiring as John is,''
Cindy McCain said. ``People will say, well, she is his wife, she's
supposed to say that. But the truth of it is that particularly when
I was having my problems, I could look to him and the way he could
relate to strife. With my husband, what you see is what you get,
and that is wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer, the former head of the conservative Family Research
Council, turned to his wife earlier this fall to vouch for his
marital fidelity and help end a whispering campaign alleging he was
having an affair with a female staffer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had absolutely no question in my mind as to what the truth
was,'' said Carol Bauer, adding that her husband did the right
thing in addressing the false rumors, though it was hard for her
and their three children to go before the cameras.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are Mr. Family Values, you cannot allow criticism of
your lifestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   Having spouses provide the character sketch makes sense as the
nation, post-Clinton, takes extra care in deciding what kind of man
it wants in the White House. Celebrating traditional family values,
as the wives do, also is an important way for GOP candidates to woo
conservative voters, who are particularly influential in the
presidential primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas D. Rath, a Bush adviser in New Hampshire, sees the
spouses playing a very significant role in the now-hot primary
contest. First, he said, they are the most sought-after surrogates
for the candidates. Second, they are uniquely able to settle,
support, and focus their husbands in the rough-and-tumble of the
race. Third, they are best qualified to create a comfort zone for
voters about the character of the men they will choose among.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spouses, better than anyone else, can assure people they can
wake up the day after the election and be totally comfortable with
the choice they made,'' Rath said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Sabina Forbes and Laura Bush appear in their husband's
television commercials. Cindy McCain narrates one of the senator's
radio ads.
</P>
<P>
   The only wives missing from the GOP action are Elaine Hatch,
Utah Senator Orrin Hatch's wife of 42 years and the mother of six
children, and Jocelyn Marcel Keyes, the wife of talk show host and
former ambassador Alan Keyes, who directs a Catholic soup kitchen
when she isn't home with the couple's three children.
</P>
<P>
   According to Mary Lewis, Alan Keyes's chief of staff, Jocelyn
Keyes is ``extra supportive, but she is also very private.'' Like
her husband, she also is an antiabortion activist.
</P>
<P>
   These would-be first ladies present a stark contrast to Hillary
Rodham Clinton, the lawyer and key policy adviser who won no
popularity contests until the Monica S. Lewinsky scandal showed her
as a stand-by-her-man wife. Indeed, they seem to have more in
common with former first lady Barbara Bush _ the mother-in-law
Laura emulates _ than with Elizabeth Dole, who said in 1996 that if
Republican Bob Dole won the White House, she intended to keep
working at the American Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very disturbed by that sneering comment _ it was
insulting that Mrs. Dole felt the great and powerful job of being a
first lady, or of being a supportive wife, wasn't as valuable as
working at the Red Cross,'' said Danielle Crittenden, author of
``What Our Mothers Didn't Tell Us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And whether you are a Democrat or Republican, you have to be
sick of this Lady Macbeth character we now have in the White House,
and look forward to having a first lady who will be happy in the
traditional role and secure in a good marriage,'' Crittenden added.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the GOP wives are avoiding substantive issues and
say they are giving their candidate-husbands no policy advice.
</P>
<P>
   Sabina Forbes describes her campaign function as ``being there
and listening to Steve.'' Cindy McCain says she is ``not involved
in policymaking or anything like that,'' though she is ``the keeper
of the man'' _ making sure he eats right, gets enough sleep, and
stands up straight. She recently sent him clean shirts by Federal
Express.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give my husband some counsel, but I actually think counsel
or advice from a spouse ends up being nagging, or sounding like
that,'' Laura Bush said. ``So I am very careful about actually
telling George anything. I know I wouldn't want him telling me to
do a lot of things or to be some way. I know he really doesn't want
me to tell him, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura was advised by Barbara Bush never to criticize her
husband's speeches. The one time years ago that she did, Laura
recalled with a hearty laugh, her flustered spouse plowed the car
into the garage wall. But the senior Bushes have credited their
daughter-in-law with domesticating their fun-loving son, and Bush
himself says Laura was the reason he gave up alcohol when he turned
40.

   ``He might think I was the key to his stopping, but I don't
think really I was,'' Mrs. Bush said. ``He was already very
disciplined. I didn't nag him, but I did say of course that he was
drinking too much, or that he ought to quit drinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush, a former second-grade teacher, has been a strong
advocate in Texas for early childhood education and _ like her
mother-in-law _ family literacy. Those interests, she says, would
follow her to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Sabina Forbes says that to the extent she has even thought about
being first lady, her agenda would be children. Cindy McCain, who
brought a Bangladeshi baby home from Mother Teresa's orphanage in
1991 and kept her, said she wants to promote adoption.
</P>
<P>
   But she doesn't think a first lady belongs in the bully pulpit.
``That's not for me,'' said Mrs. McCain, who comes from a wealthy
Phoenix family and has been involved in its charitable foundation.
``I would take my role as kind of the hostess _ that is probably a
light word, but I will use it _ very seriously because it is an
important aspect and large part of the job. If that's traditional,
I am traditional.''
</P>
<P>
   Carol Bauer, 51, who is working as a part-time fund-raiser and
surrogate speaker for her husband, says traditional is good _ so
good that she would use the offices of the White House to promote a
better understanding of women's roles in society and elevate the
status of full-time homemakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The woman who chooses, for a season of her life, to take time
off, be home to advise and counsel her children, be part of the
PTA, the Cub Scouts, the Sunday school, shouldn't be looked down
upon,'' said Mrs. Bauer, who in 1994 was named the conservative
Eagle Forum's Full-time Homemaker of the Year. She once worked for
the Republican National Committee (where she met her husband in
1972) and for then-Representative Margaret Heckler of Massachusetts
but quit her job when her third child was born.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush says she doesn't know exactly what it means to be a
traditional wife, but she ``had the luxury, financially, to stay
home and raise my children after I married.'' The daughter of a
Midland, Texas, homebuilder, Laura Welch went to junior high school
with her future husband but didn't fall in love with him until both
were 31, when friends reintroduced them at a dinner party. They wed
three months later.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were late bloomers,'' said Mrs. Bush, noting she was
attracted to George W. because he was talkative, which she was not.
``Our personalities complemented each other. We're actually very
alike in a lot of ways. And we both wanted the same thing _ we
wanted to get married, and we wanted to have children.''
</P>
<P>
   Like George W. Bush, Steve Forbes has twin daughters, and the
picture of those men changing diapers, doing midnight feedings, and
rocking fussy babies to sleep is still vivid in their wives'
memories. ``Steve has always been a very involved father,'' said
Sabina Forbes, 51, describing how her workaholic husband of 28
years made time for softball, board games, and biking. ``No matter
how tired he was, Steve read bedtime stories to Elizabeth every
night'' when the 12-year-old was on the campaign bus touring Iowa
last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Forbes laments that she isn't home all the time now to fix
her daughters' supper or, since she has no staff, to straighten the
house. Steve and Sabina met at a society party in New York where,
she confirms, Forbes offered her a cigar, which she promptly lit
and smoked (not so unusual, she noted, for a girl raised in
Europe). What attracted her to Forbes? ``His wit. His smile,'' Mrs.
Forbes blushed.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was separated from his first wife and had three children
when he met Cindy Hensley, a special-education teacher, at a party
in Hawaii. Her first impression was he was ``cute.'' His first
impression was she was young. Neither knew the other had lied about
their age that night until they got their marriage license in 1980.
She was actually 24, he was 41.
</P>
<P>
   After McCain was elected to Congress in 1982, he commuted every
week to Washington and his wife stayed in Phoenix to raise their
children, be near her aging parents, and run the home. Two back
surgeries put her on painkillers; she became addicted and fed the
habit by stealing drugs from an international medical-relief group
funded by her family. She concealed it all from her husband, partly
because she was embarrassed, partly because he was embroiled in the
Keating Five investigation and she didn't want to tell him,
``here's another mess.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You make mistakes and you move on,'' said Cindy McCain, who
says her recovery has made her a better person and a more watchful
parent. And she says she has no regrets about choosing a life that
sometimes put her husband's career ahead of her needs. ``I'm happy
where I am with John,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Fowler, a professor of government and director of the
Nelson Rockefeller Center at Dartmouth College, says the GOP
candidates could create a gender gap if they appear to exalt the
privileged, stay-at-home wife. ``To the extent they satisfy the
Christian right view of womanhood, they risk looking out of touch
to women voters, because the majority of them are working.''
</P>
<P>
   But Laura Bush says women understand it's all about being at
peace with your choices. Hers _ schoolteacher, librarian, full-time
wife, and mother _ happen to have been traditional.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one point I fussed at my parents, and said to my dad,
`Gosh, you all just programmed me to be a teacher. You should have
programmed me to be a lawyer,' '' Mrs. Bush recalled. ``My dad
said, `I'll send you to law school _ that would be great!' Then I
had to admit I didn't want to go to law school. I was happy with
what I was.''

   EAST ORLAND, Maine _ The next generation of Atlantic salmon that
will swim in this state's rivers are tucked up in little blue
drawers at the Craig Brook National Fish Hatchery here. In each
one, thousands of pink pearl-size eggs are piled together in a
freshwater bath like some strange casserole.
</P>
<P>
   Once abundant in New England rivers from the Connecticut to the
St. Croix, Atlantic salmon were nearly wiped out in the United
States by scores of dams that block the path to their spawning
grounds. Today, this hatchery at the end of a dirt road incubates
up to 95 percent of the salmon in Maine's salmon streams.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the heroic efforts, however, the decline continues:
fewer than 150 adult salmon returned this year to spawn in eight
key rivers in eastern Maine, among the last rivers in America where
humans never completely drove them out.
</P>
<P>
   But this handful of survivors has stirred not sympathy but
powerful fears among Maine political and business leaders, who
bitterly oppose a Clinton Administration proposal to add the
Atlantic salmon to the endangered species list. They say that the
fish could become another ``spotted owl,'' referring to the
reclusive bird whose protection closed millions of acres of federal
land in the Pacific Northwest to logging.
</P>
<P>
   Maine Governor Angus King has taken personal control of the
opposition, branding the salmon protection plan the biggest
immediate threat to his state's prosperity. Because federal
biologists name everything from the herbicides used on blueberries
to logging along riverbanks as potential threats to the salmon,
King worries that these industries would be vulnerable to
strangling regulations in the name of salmon protection.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, King is concerned about the state's $65 million
aquaculture industry, a promising new business where fish farmers
raise salmon for food in pens near the mouth of several salmon
rivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will kill (the aquaculture) industry dead. D_E_A_D, dead.
That's why I'm so upset about the proposed listing of the Atlantic
salmon,'' said King in an interview. ``We have to be sure that we
are allowed to have economic growth like everyone else,'' adding
that the state should not be seen as ``a park for somebody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists and federal biologists say King's grim
predictions are exaggerated, noting that other animals such as bald
eagles have been declared endangered without hurting Maine's
economy. Moreover, they say the aquaculture industry has helped
create the crisis atmosphere by doing little to prevent the
farm-bred salmon from escaping and breeding with native salmon,
despite months of prodding from federal officials to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Federal biologists say such breeding poses a major threat to the
wild fish by introducing genes that could weaken their offspring's
ability to survive a demanding life cycle that includes a trip to
Greenland and back, followed by an upstream swim to spawning
grounds.
</P>
<P>
   More important, biologists from both the US Fish and Wildlife
Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service say King misses
the significance of this dwindling band of fish, and the federal
government's $11 million expansion of the Craig Brook hatchery to
help them.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are other Atlantic salmon around, from the
fish-farm salmon that wind up on restaurant plates to the
hatchery-raised fish that have been reintroduced to the Connecticut
River, the salmon from these eastern Maine rivers may be the last
in America that reproduce in the wild despite the incredible odds
against them.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Governor King's own senior salmon biologist Ed Baum
argues that the eastern Maine fish should be treated as a
``treasure of national significance'' whose ability to survive has
proven their genes are worth preserving.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real question is whether we want Atlantic salmon in Maine
rivers or not,'' said David Carle of the Conservation Action
Project, one of several groups whose lawsuit against federal
wildlife agencies prompted the Clinton Administration proposal to
declare the salmon endangered.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the angry rhetoric is a difficult question in an age in
which humans increasingly play a decisive role in the fate of
animals, from airlifting wolves to Yellowstone National Park to
raising condors in zoos: At what point are animals no longer really
``wild'' at all but products of human engineering?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is vital in deciding whether to apply the Endangered
Species Act, a law so strict that it stopped a multi-billion dam in
Tennessee in the 1970s to protect an obscure fish called the snail
darter.
</P>
<P>
   Maine officials argue that the hatchery at Craig Brook has
released so many salmon into the rivers over the last century that
they have swamped the tiny wild population. In particular, the
mixing of salmon from various rivers, King asserts, eliminated the
unique genes that evolved as salmon families returned to the same
spawning ground, generation after generation.
</P>
<P>
   The salmon in eastern Maine, said King, ``are the product of
more than 50 years of hatchery stocking from a variety of sources,
including several in Canada, and are therefore no more (genetically
pure) than I am a purebred Scot, with my English, German, and
God-knows-what-else ancestors.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, King argues, the Endangered Species Act doesn't
apply to salmon because the eastern Maine variety are no more
valuable than the tens of thousands that spawn in Canada or even
the millions in aquaculture pens. The animals deserve protection,
King said, but they are far from an endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for me to understand how an animal that numbers in
the millions can possibly be in danger of extinction,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But environmentalist Doug Watts believes the salmon behind his
house, just a mile from King's office, prove the governor wrong. A
few salmon return each year to Bond Brook in Augusta although no
one ever stocked the stream. Since salmon are famously loyal to the
stream where they spend their first two years, Watts believes they
are truly ``wild.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The way the governor has conducted himself comes down to:
`Don't confuse me with the facts,' '' complains Watts, president of
Friends of the Kennebec River Salmon.
</P>
<P>
   Geneticists at the US Geological Survey, called in to take a
closer look at the Maine salmon, believe that remnants of the wild
salmon population similarly survived in eight rivers in eastern
Maine that endured fewer dams and other human insults. They're
still studying the Bond Brook fish.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the federal hatchery has released hundreds of
thousands of young salmon even into these supposedly ``wild''
rivers, including salmon from Canada as well as various Maine
rivers. However, federal biologists believe that the overwhelming
majority of these stocked fish died without reproducing, perhaps
because they lacked the genetic programming to return to the same
river.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe there's a pure 100 percent wild strain out
there. We're not that idealistic, but we do believe there is a wild
gene pool worth saving,'' said Tom King, biologist at the Craig
Brook Hatchery.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Brook continues to extensively stock the eight rivers, but
with an important difference since 1992. Now, the hatchery only
releases salmon into the rivers their parents came from, ending the
old practice of capturing breeding fish from one river, then
releasing their young into another. Today, hatchery workers round
up eggs after they have already been laid by the females in rivers,
using the hatchery as an incubator and nursery to improve their
survival chances.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, federal wildlife officials don't have black and
white rules on how much cross-breeding is too much for the
Endangered Species Act. For instance, panthers in Florida get full
endangered-species protection even though biologists have crossbred
them with Texas lions to increase their numbers. On the other hand,
wolves brought from Canada to Yellowstone National Park are treated
as ``experimental'' animals that can be shot if they threaten
cattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Endangered Species Act does not draw that line'' where
human breeding of animals has so damaged a species' genetic
integrity that it can no longer be protected, said Martin Miller,
deputy chief of the endangered species division at US Fish and
Wildlife. ``It comes down to using the best available science.''
</P>
<P>
   It also comes down to politics. Federal biologists concluded
four years ago that the Maine salmon were so depleted that they
should be declared endangered, but memos show top Clinton
Administration officials backed off under pressure from
then-Senator William Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when the Endangered Species Act was under fire from
the new Republican majority in Congress, the moderate Cohen
threatened to ``rethink his position on the Endangered Species
Act'' if Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt went ahead with the
endangered species listing of salmon, according to a 1995 memo from
Chris Mantzaris of the National Marine Fisheries Service.
</P>
<P>
   To the consternation of the biologists, Babbitt, along with the
late Commerce Secretary Ronald Brown, the Cabinet secretary in
charge of the National Marine Fisheries Service, postponed and
finally withdrew the proposal to protect the salmon, allowing Maine
to come up with its own conservation plan instead.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, the federal biologists saw even more problems
with the salmon, such as new diseases, and more evidence that the
Maine salmon are genetically unique. While praising Maine
conservation efforts _ and admitting that not enough time had
passed for them to pay off _ the biologists said in July that
federal action was needed to save the fish.
</P>
<P>
   The biologists' recommendation set off panic among coastal
industries near the salmon streams. Aquaculture officials face the
most direct threat _ federal biologists have said they should stop
using imported, faster-growing European salmon unless they can
guarantee the fish won't escape _ but a Biological Review Team
report also said water and chemical use of blueberry and cranberry
growers as well as logging practices need to be reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big worry about listing (salmon) is that any group for
just about any reason can file a lawsuit'' to eliminate what they
regard as threats to the salmon, said Clyde MacDonald, executive
director of the Maine Cranberry Growers' Association.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of listing the salmon wish King would listen to Baum,
a longtime biologist at the state Atlantic Salmon Commission, who
believes that King's fears and those in industry are misplaced.
Based on federal handling of other endangered species, Baum
believes the government would simply accelerate state conservation
efforts without damaging industries.
</P>
<P>
   However, given the ambiguity surrounding the salmon's genetic
makeup, the debate may finally come down to values as much as
science. And King is convinced that the cost of protecting a few
particular salmon is too high, especially when the effort could
fail anyway because of dangers the fish face at sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could close all of Washington and Penobscot Counties, send
everyone home and turn out the lights, and still not bring the fish
back,'' said King.

DID THE WISE MEN SEE AN ACTUAL STAR? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ROPEIK  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. What's the star that led the Wise Men to Bethlehem, and
what's the best guess as to when it actually appeared?
</P>
<P>
   B.A., Wellesley &UR; , Mass. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. According to astrophysicist Mark Kidger, author of the
recently published ``The Star of Bethlehem,'' the wise men probably
saw a nova, the birth of a new star, in 5 BC. His theory isn't new.
The exhaustive research behind it is.
</P>
<P>
   Kidger says Chinese records note that in March of 5 BC,
astronomers one night observed a new object in the sky. The called
it a ``Po Hsing,'' a bushy star, to the north of the constellation
Capricorn. The records say the object was seen in the same spot for
two and a half months. It didn't move, as a comet would have. After
a while, it faded from view.
</P>
<P>
   Checking back in time with computer planetarium programs that
have only been developed in the past few years, Kidger found a star
that would have been at that spot in the sky, at that time. Novas
do sometimes look a little bushy when they first appear, and they
do sometimes fade.
</P>
<P>
   He also found that Jupiter and Saturn, two planets that at times
appear as very bright stars, were close together three times in the
night sky in the seven months before March of 5 BC.
</P>
<P>
   Then, one night, the Wise Men, the Magi, who were probably
astrologers, looked up and saw a star that hadn't been there the
night before. They might well have called it a miracle.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would certainly have been quite amazed by it,'' Kidger
says.
</P>
<P>
   But where were they when they saw it? Kidger ran his planetarium
programs and found that the nova would have appeared to the west of
anyone in Persia, now Iran, exactly where some historians think the
Magi were from.
</P>
<P>
   What about the part of the story in which the star moves across
the sky, leading the Wise Men to the manger? Novas don't move
across the sky, at least not in one night. But they do move across
the sky in successive nights, as the earth's orbit gradually
changes the position of every star as the days and nights pass.
Kidger argues that the Magi headed west, the direction of the star,
to Jerusalem. Each night the star moved a bit in that direction,
leading them on.
</P>
<P>
   How could a celestial object observed five years before Christ
be the star that led the Magi to the birth of Jesus? Kidger says
there are many biblical scholars who agree the precise date of
Jesus' birth is open to interpretation. The modern calendar setting
Christ's birth date as time 0 wasn't set until 6 centuries later.
And bible stories of Herod trying to find Jesus date to 4 BC.
</P>
<P>
   Kidger admits that 2000 years later the records are so old,
incomplete, and circumstantial that we may never be able to read
them correctly. But it's a very nice theory. Whether you're looking
for a scientific explanation or you're a practicing Christian who
believes this was a miracle, you can square this theory with your
beliefs.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Since 1990, Americans overall have become less likely to die
from cancer, heart disease, and homicide, but they're more
overweight and more likely to develop diabetes, according to a
once-in-a-decade US health report card.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, black Americans continue to have higher rates
of infant mortality and many other indicators of poor health
compared to the US average. And American Indians, Hispanics, and
Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders still have higher rates of
such diseases as diabetes and tuberculosis than the general
population.
</P>
<P>
   This latest health status tally _ part of a report card called
``Healthy People 2000'' _ shows that 60 percent of the public
health targets set a decade ago to improve America's well-being
will be met next year, but others will fall short.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to take those targets we will fail to meet in 2000 and
put them again before the American people and policymakers'' and
address them in the coming decade, said Deborah Maiese, senior
prevention policy adviser to the US Department of Health and Human
Services, who is involved in establishing the objectives for 2010.
</P>
<P>
   But the most ambitious goal of ``Healthy People 2010'' is the
elimination of racial disparities in preventing and treating
disease. Aside from calling for better data collection and
research, however, there are few specifics in the 2010 draft report
about how the government hopes to achieve this goal. A final
report, which is expected to contain more description, will be
released January 25 by US Secretary of Health and Human Services
Donna Shalala and US Surgeon General David Satcher.
</P>
<P>
   Public health officials attribute the historic racial
disparities in disease rates to poverty, lack of access to care,
and discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials representing black, Asian American, and
Hispanic communities called the goal of eliminating racial gaps a
laudable one, although they said it will take a major public health
commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a great idea,'' said Azzie Young, executive
director of Mattapan Community Health Center, which serves a
population at higher risk of everything from infant mortality to
breast cancer death. ``I think the goal is achievable provided we
have the political will to address the issues. Some of them are
going to be very tough.''
</P>
<P>
   The decennial ``Healthy People'' initiative began two decades
ago to encourage healthy behaviors and track the nation's progress
in public health; the program began under then-US Surgeon General
Julius B. Richmond, a professor emeritus at Harvard Medical School
and the School of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we began to see, and what encouraged me to start to set
goals for a 10-year period, was that we were beginning to see
progress in. . .the chronic disorders that don't have a single
cause like infectious disease, but multiple causes, like heart
disease, stroke, cancer,'' said Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   The death rate from those chronic diseases continued to decline
throughout the 1990s, according to the most recent progress review
for Healthy People 2000. It is a trend that public health officials
attribute to better prevention, earlier detection, and improved
treatment of disease.
</P>
<P>
   In cancer, the overall decrease is largely a result of early
detection, ``particularly for the ones we talk about most _ breast,
prostate, and colorectal cancers,'' said Dr. John Rich, medical
director for the Boston Public Health Commission, which is working
with the American Cancer Society on a ``cancer crusade'' to
emphasize the importance of early detection and treatment to all
city residents.
</P>
<P>
   For lung cancer, a decrease in death rates among men was
attributed to a reduction in smoking, but the rates among women
have stagnated, according to public health officals.
</P>
<P>
   But the latest Healthy People 2000 review shows that the numbers
have been going in the wrong direction over the last decade in
diabetes, obesity, and sedentary lifestyle, which tend to be
related to one another.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the US prevalence of diabetes has increased from
an average of 26 cases for every 1,000 people in 1990 to 31 in
1996, while the year 2000 target was to reduce the number to 25
cases for every 1,000 people. Adult-onset diabetes, also known as
type 2 diabetes, the more prevalent form of the disease, is linked
to obesity.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Marian Parrott, vice president of clinical affairs for the
American Diabetes Association, said these numers show diabetes is a
``public health epidemic.''
</P>
<P>
   The diabetes numbers, which are considered poor across the
board, are worse for minorities than for whites. For instance, the
prevalence among blacks shot up from 36 cases for every 1,000
people in 1990 to 44 in 1996, while for American Indians, it
increased from 67 in 1990 to 73 in 1994, according to the latest
data available. The numbers also went in the wrong direction for
both blacks and whites for such diabetes-related complications as
amputations of toes or feet.
</P>
<P>
   Up until now, US health officials have only aimed to reduce
racial disparities in health _ not eliminate them _ by establishing
one goal for the US average and then another for blacks and, if
there were enough data, for other minorities.
</P>
<P>
   For example, while the overall US goal was to reduce diabetes
prevalence in all Americans to 25 cases for every 1,000 people by
the year 2000, a 3.8 percent reduction from the 1990 figure, the
goal for blacks was to cut it to 32, an 11 percent reduction, and
for American Indians, to 62, a 7.5 percent reduction.
</P>
<P>
   The 2010 goal of eliminating racial disparities calls for
setting one target for everyone, so that in the case of diabetes,
the aim is to get the prevalence for everyone down to less than 25
cases for every 1,000 people, according to the draft Healthy People
2010 report.
</P>
<P>
   But not every minority health official supports the idea of
doing away with separate, more immediately attainable targets.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Namais, director of community health programs for the
North American Indian Center of Boston, said she was skeptical,
considering the failure to meet the Healthy People 2000 targets for
American Indians, who have among the worst statistics of all, in
everything from smoking to alcoholism to diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't even meet those goals,'' said Namais, a St. Regis
Mohawk, whose federally funded community health programs provided
more than 5,800 services to nearly 300 American Indians in the
greater Boston area last year. ``There's no impact in Indian
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Another first for Healthy People 2010 is the acknowledgment that
gays and lesbians have special health concerns, according to
Patricia Dunn, director of public policy for the San
Francisco-based Gay and Lesbian Medical Association, and US health
official Maiese. There are no specifics about goals for this
population in the draft report.
</P>
<P>
   While the once-a-decade process of updating the Healthy People
report card has led to some progress and more ambitious goals for
the nation, Mattapan's Young said that by 2010, ``I hope we're not
having the same conversation. I do hope the conversation has
changed, so that we're talking more about our success stories.''

DEBATE LOOMS OVER STEM CELL FUNDS, RESEARCH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Reopening some of the wrenching moral questions of
the abortion fight, Congress is preparing to debate whether to fund
research that may rely on destroying embryos in order to find cures
for disease.
</P>
<P>
   The debate, which lawmakers are expected to take up early next
year, arises from a breakthrough 13 months ago in isolating human
``stem cells.'' These cells, which appear early in an embryo's
development, can grow to become anything in the body, including
heart, kidney, blood and bone marrow cells that could be
transplanted into people whose own organs are not functioning
properly.
</P>
<P>
   But an embryo is destroyed in the process of harvesting its stem
cells, raising thorny questions about whether it is proper to end
one form of human life to benefit another.
</P>
<P>
   The debate is being prodded by the National Institutes of
Health, which this month laid out guidelines for funding stem cell
research that would use embryos produced by couples during
infertility treatments but not used. The NIH says its plan is
legal, but some lawmakers said it violates a congressional ban on
spending federal money for research that destroys embryos.
</P>
<P>
   House members who support the ban will likely challenge the NIH
early next year. ``Something is going to be done one way or
another, in the courts or in Congress,'' said Representative Jay
Dickey, an Arkansas Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Senate supporters of the stem cell research said Majority Leader
Trent Lott has promised a debate on whether to give the NIH
explicit authority to proceed. The NIH is taking public comments on
its proposal through Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``To what extent can we profit from things that some people
think are morally questionable?'' asked Ronald M. Green, professor
of ethics at Dartmouth College. ``How do we determine where life
begins? I think stem cell research raises some of the most
important moral questions of our time.''
</P>
<P>
   Stem cells develop when embryos are only a few days old and have
only 15 or 20 cells. Some of those cells are destined to form the
heart, others to form bones or blood. But they have not yet
``committed'' to any part of the body, and they have the ability to
become part of almost any organ system.
</P>
<P>
   Using private funds, scientists from the University of Wisconsin
in Madison last year were able to grow embryonic stem cells for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers obtained the cells from embryos that couples had
created during fertility treatments and that were going to be
discarded. Couples routinely make more embryos than they use in
trying to produce a child, leaving thousands of frozen embryos
around the country that the potential parents may use later,
destroy or preserve indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   The number of frozen embryos in the United States is estimated
at 150,000, though no one knows for sure. While more are created
each year, their legal and moral status remains unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Under Roe v. Wade, life in the womb has no legal status that
outweighs a woman's right to end her pregnancy, though in the third
trimester states may protect a fetus by restricting abortion. Now,
the nation must consider whether early human life has value that
outweighs a scientist's research proposal or a patient's desire for
new cures.
</P>
<P>
   Many patient-advocate groups say the potential benefit to
millions of people makes the research essential. But for
Christopher Currie, 37, whose diabetes is damaging his eyesight,
kidneys and nervous system, embryonic stem cell research crosses a
clear moral line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could not carry the burden of adding years to my life at the
cost of causing someone else to perish,'' said Currie, a Catholic
and college philosophy major, who also opposes abortion. ``It
scares me to think I could be faced with the decision'' to accept a
stem cell treatment. ``I would look at my wife and daughter, and it
would rip my guts apart.''
</P>
<P>
   However, opinions on abortion are proving to be only a limited
guide in the stem cell debate. In a little noted development,
opponents of the research have grown to include some people outside
the antiabortion camp. They argue that a woman should have the
right to end her own pregnancy, but also that human embryos have
enough innate value that they should not be used as experimental
material.
</P>
<P>
   That is the position of the United Methodist Church, which has
8.5 million members. ``We are not saying that an embryo is the same
thing as human life, but we are saying that it deserves special
consideration,'' said Jaydee Hanson, of the church's Board of
Church and Society.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists hold the same view. ``To acknowledge the right
of somebody not to be a parent is not the same as saying we can do
anything we want with human embryos,'' said Stuart Newman, a
developmental biologist at New York Medical College in Valhalla,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Newman concedes the stem cell debate could prompt some people to
revise their view of abortion. ``A mother's right not to proceed
with a pregnancy is not so much based on biology as on a social
contract,'' he said. ``But to draw attention to the basic humanity,
the biological humanity, of her pregnancy kind of corrupts the
whole contract and shows it to be something that is purely
practical.''
</P>
<P>
   While the nature of the research forces the NIH to confront
tough ethical questions, the agency's political situation makes the
landscape even trickier.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Congress approved language that barred federal funding
for any ``research in which a human embryo or embryos are
destroyed.'' The law does not prohibit privately funded research,
though some states regulate or bar it.
</P>
<P>
   The NIH, after obtaining a legal opinion early this year from
the Department of Health and Human Services, said that it had the
authority to fund stem cell research, as long as taxpayer money did
not pay for the process of extracting the cells from embryos.
</P>
<P>
   Now, even some supporters of the agency said that reasoning is
strained. If a lab somewhere destroys embryos on behalf of a stem
cell researcher, they said, that researcher cannot claim to have
had no role in the destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Green, the Dartmouth ethicist, said this was similar to the
unresolved question facing scientists today of whether to use
research conducted on Nazi death camp inmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``This touches on one of the most fascinating moral question of
our century: At what point does cooperating with moral wrongdoing
begin?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Raising another question, the new NIH guidelines say that
researchers may use only stem cells taken from embryos created
during infertility treatments. Scientists may not create new human
embryos in order to produce stem cells.
</P>
<P>
   But NIH critics say an embryo either has moral value or it does
not, independent of why it was created.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's not human life, why is it a bad thing to create it?''
asked Maggie Wynne, staff member of the House Prolife Caucus, which
opposes the research. Rather than using rigid logic, she said, the
NIH ``is gauging things on the `yuck factor,' on what the general
public will accept before they get the idea that the NIH is out of
control and starting to play around with human life.''
</P>
<P>
   More questions arise from the fact that scientists are learning
new ways to produce tissues and whole organisms from a single cell.
Canadian scientsts in 1993 reported producing entire mice from stem
cells, and it could be possible to produce a person from a single
human cell. For some people, this feat raises the question of
whether a single cell carries the same moral value as a person,
even though it would need extraordinary care to complete its
growth.
</P>
<P>
   A Worcester, Mass. company, Advanced Cell Technology, has
suggested one way to circumvent some moral questions, only to raise
another. It claims to have fused a human cell and a cow cell,
creating a hybrid that produces human stem cells, but could never
grow to be a person. The company says it later added a jellyfish
gene to the hybrid in a first step toward learning how to guide the
development of stem cells into specialized cells.
</P>
<P>
   However, many people recoiled at the thought of crossing species
lines, and the NIH explicitly barred that type of project from
receiving federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists believe the day will come when society assigns a
different status to an embryo based on its stage of development.
</P>
<P>
   In the first 14 days of life, the embryo has not yet developed a
``primitive streak,'' the precursor to a backbone. Once a backbone
develops, the embryo can no longer split and become twins, and will
grow as a single being.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cells have not decided to become an individual yet,'' said
Michael West, chief executive of Advanced Cell Technology.
``There's no person at this point.'' West suggested that any type
of research be permitted on embryos before 14 days and that
research be barred or regulated after that point.
</P>
<P>
   For Currie, the easiest solution is for Congress to continue its
bar on embryo destruction while funding other promising
possibilities. Neural stem cells taken from adults, for example,
may prove to be more useful in some treatments than those from
embryos.
</P>
<P>
   Stem cells have also been isolated in tissue from aborted
fetuses, which may raise fewer qualms because the research itself
did not cause the human life to end.
</P>
<P>
   But it is unclear whether these stem cells have the same powers
as embryonic stem cells, and scientists want to continue both lines
of research.
</P>
<P>
   Overwhelmingly, families with sick children favor research that
can lead to cures, even if it involves embryonic stem cells.
</P>
<P>
   Said Dr. Evan Snyder, a neurobiologist at Children's Hospital in
Boston: ``I can't tell you how many phone calls I get from families
waiting for cures from this for their children. It would make you
go home and hug your kids 1,000 times.''

DEBATE LOOMS OVER STEM CELL FUNDS, RESEARCH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Reopening some of the wrenching moral questions of
the abortion fight, Congress is preparing to debate whether to fund
research that may rely on destroying embryos in order to find cures
for disease.
</P>
<P>
   The debate, which lawmakers are expected to take up early next
year, arises from a breakthrough 13 months ago in isolating human
``stem cells.'' These cells, which appear early in an embryo's
development, can grow to become anything in the body, including
heart, kidney, blood and bone marrow cells that could be
transplanted into people whose own organs are not functioning
properly.
</P>
<P>
   But an embryo is destroyed in the process of harvesting its stem
cells, raising thorny questions about whether it is proper to end
one form of human life to benefit another.
</P>
<P>
   The debate is being prodded by the National Institutes of
Health, which this month laid out guidelines for funding stem cell
research that would use embryos produced by couples during
infertility treatments but not used. The NIH says its plan is
legal, but some lawmakers said it violates a congressional ban on
spending federal money for research that destroys embryos.
</P>
<P>
   House members who support the ban will likely challenge the NIH
early next year. ``Something is going to be done one way or
another, in the courts or in Congress,'' said Representative Jay
Dickey, an Arkansas Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Senate supporters of the stem cell research said Majority Leader
Trent Lott has promised a debate on whether to give the NIH
explicit authority to proceed. The NIH is taking public comments on
its proposal through Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``To what extent can we profit from things that some people
think are morally questionable?'' asked Ronald M. Green, professor
of ethics at Dartmouth College. ``How do we determine where life
begins? I think stem cell research raises some of the most
important moral questions of our time.''
</P>
<P>
   Stem cells develop when embryos are only a few days old and have
only 15 or 20 cells. Some of those cells are destined to form the
heart, others to form bones or blood. But they have not yet
``committed'' to any part of the body, and they have the ability to
become part of almost any organ system.
</P>
<P>
   Using private funds, scientists from the University of Wisconsin
in Madison last year were able to grow embryonic stem cells for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers obtained the cells from embryos that couples had
created during fertility treatments and that were going to be
discarded. Couples routinely make more embryos than they use in
trying to produce a child, leaving thousands of frozen embryos
around the country that the potential parents may use later,
destroy or preserve indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   The number of frozen embryos in the United States is estimated
at 150,000, though no one knows for sure. While more are created
each year, their legal and moral status remains unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Under Roe v. Wade, life in the womb has no legal status that
outweighs a woman's right to end her pregnancy, though in the third
trimester states may protect a fetus by restricting abortion. Now,
the nation must consider whether early human life has value that
outweighs a scientist's research proposal or a patient's desire for
new cures.
</P>
<P>
   Many patient-advocate groups say the potential benefit to
millions of people makes the research essential. But for
Christopher Currie, 37, whose diabetes is damaging his eyesight,
kidneys and nervous system, embryonic stem cell research crosses a
clear moral line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could not carry the burden of adding years to my life at the
cost of causing someone else to perish,'' said Currie, a Catholic
and college philosophy major, who also opposes abortion. ``It
scares me to think I could be faced with the decision'' to accept a
stem cell treatment. ``I would look at my wife and daughter, and it
would rip my guts apart.''
</P>
<P>
   However, opinions on abortion are proving to be only a limited
guide in the stem cell debate. In a little noted development,
opponents of the research have grown to include some people outside
the antiabortion camp. They argue that a woman should have the
right to end her own pregnancy, but also that human embryos have
enough innate value that they should not be used as experimental
material.
</P>
<P>
   That is the position of the United Methodist Church, which has
8.5 million members. ``We are not saying that an embryo is the same
thing as human life, but we are saying that it deserves special
consideration,'' said Jaydee Hanson, of the church's Board of
Church and Society.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists hold the same view. ``To acknowledge the right
of somebody not to be a parent is not the same as saying we can do
anything we want with human embryos,'' said Stuart Newman, a
developmental biologist at New York Medical College in Valhalla,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Newman concedes the stem cell debate could prompt some people to
revise their view of abortion. ``A mother's right not to proceed
with a pregnancy is not so much based on biology as on a social
contract,'' he said. ``But to draw attention to the basic humanity,
the biological humanity, of her pregnancy kind of corrupts the
whole contract and shows it to be something that is purely
practical.''
</P>
<P>
   While the nature of the research forces the NIH to confront
tough ethical questions, the agency's political situation makes the
landscape even trickier.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Congress approved language that barred federal funding
for any ``research in which a human embryo or embryos are
destroyed.'' The law does not prohibit privately funded research,
though some states regulate or bar it.
</P>
<P>

the Department of Health and Human Services, said that it had the

not pay for the process of extracting the cells from embryos.

THE POOR FAVOR SCHOOL CHOICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To anyone with eyes to see and ears to hear, parents across
America _ especially those in urban neighborhoods with wretched
public schools _ are wild for school choice. In Milwaukee, where
vouchers are making it possible for 8,000 poor students to attend
private or parochial school, 62 percent of city residents support
the program, according to a poll commissioned by the Milwaukee
Journal Sentinel. Among black Milwaukeans, the level of support is
74 percent; among Hispanics, 77 percent. And among Milwaukee
residents with very low incomes, a whopping 81 percent favor
vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee is no fluke. A national poll last year by a leading
black think tank, the Joint Center for Political and Economic
Studies, showed that substantial majorities of blacks in the
Northeast (69 percent) and Midwest (65 percent) support vouchers.
Broken down by age, support was especially pronounced among blacks
most likely to have school-age children: Nearly 59 percent of those
between ages 26 and 50 think vouchers should be widely available.
</P>
<P>
   Parents in Washington, D.C., are ``rampaging toward choice,''
writes Michael Lynch in the January issue of Reason magazine.
Choice in the District of Columbia means privately funded vouchers
from the Washington Scholarship Fund, which gives more than 1,300
students subsidies of up to $1,700 to help pay for private school
tuition. Frequently, as Lynch's sensitive article shows, recipients
of these vouchers willingly endure privation in order to scrape
together the balance needed to cover tuition and expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many such parents,'' he writes, ``are . . . black women
raising kids or grandkids on their own.'' Rose Blassingame, for
example, who is raising four grandchildren in a two-bedroom
apartment, struggles to pay for tuition, books, and school uniforms
at the Catholic schools the kids are attending. ``Covering these
costs means giving up the monthly meal out, a summer amusement park
trip, and visits to the beauty parlor. . . . For Franciscoe'' _ one
of her grandchildren _ ``. . . it meant spending all but $31 of the
$347 he earned at his summer job on the gray slacks, white shirts,
and green blazer that constitute his uniform.''
</P>
<P>
   There are millions of Rose Blassingames out there, and no one
knows it better than businessmen Ted Forstmann and John Walton, two
donors to the Washington Scholarship Fund who last year decided to
take the idea nationwide. They raised $170 million _ $100 million
from their own pockets _ to create the Children's Scholarship Fund,
and invited low-income families to apply for 40,000 scholarships
that would defray part of the cost of private school tuition.
Winners would be required to supplement the scholarship with (on
average) $1,000 a year of their own money.
</P>
<P>
   To their astonishment, nearly 1.25 million applications came
flooding in, representing almost 1 out of every 50 schoolchildren
in America. ``These were not parents seeking a free ride,''
Forstmann marvels. ``Though their average income was less than
$22,000 a year, they were willing, asking, to make significant
financial sacrifices to take advantage of our partial . . .
scholarships. Think of it: 1.25 million applicants asking to pay
$1,000 a year over four years. That's $5 billion that poor families
were willing to spend simply to escape the schools where their
children have been relegated.''
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to Al Gore and Bill Bradley, two Democrats who
daily profess their devotion to the poor and trumpet their keen
empathy for black Americans. During their recent debate on ``Meet
the Press,'' the two candidates were asked by Tim Russert whether,
if elected, they would support vouchers. Do you suppose they jumped
at the chance to back up Rose Blassingame and the armies of
inner-city parents who are desperate to get their kids out of
dangerous and incompetent government schools?
</P>
<P>
   If so, you suppose wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Q: ``As president, would you support . . . vouchers?''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley: ``The answer is, Tim _ no, and I will tell you why. I
have supported vouchers on an experimental basis on a number of
occasions over 18 years. I do not believe that vouchers are the
answer to the problems of public education.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore: ``The reason I oppose vouchers, Tim, is because . . . if
you drain the money away from the public schools for private
vouchers, then that hurts the public schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Russert tried again. ``Why don't those poor minority moms with
their kids, who could not possibly deal with the chaos of public
schools, deserve a break?''
</P>
<P>
   He tried again. ``They have decided the public schools don't
work. . . . Why not give them a couple hundred bucks to offset the
burden of tuition?''
</P>
<P>
   But Gore and Bradley can't answer the question. They have tucked
themselves so deeply into the hip pocket of the politically
powerful teachers unions _ which, like all monopolists, want to
strangle competition _ that the cries of beleaguered parents with
kids in lousy schools have become inaudible to them.
</P>
<P>
   Their callousness is disgraceful. Neither would allow his own
children to rot in a dysfunctional public school, yet they scorn a
reform that would empower poor parents to rescue their children.
What would happen to public education, they wail, if kids are
allowed to opt out? It never occurs to them to wonder what will
happen to the kids if they aren't.

THE COUNTING'S WRONG, BUT THE TIMING'S RIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scully: ``But, Mulder, the millennium doesn't start until
January 2001.''
</P>
<P>
   Mulder: ``Nobody likes a math nerd, Scully.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; --``The X-Files,'' Nov. 28 episode &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For the past few years, longer than Agent Scully, I
have been grinding countless social occasions to a mirthless halt
whenever somebody in the room says the millennium begins on New
Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   On all historical and logical grounds, these people have got it
wrong. The reason is simple: There was no Year Zero. Thus, the
first millennium lasted from Year 1 to 1000, the second from 1001
to 2000, and so the third won't start till 2001.
</P>
<P>
   If mathematics didn't convince, there was history, including
local lore. Consider, I would say, the Twentieth Century Club of
Boston, which held its end-of-the-century bash not on New Year's
Eve 1899 (as we'll be celebrating ours on New Year's Eve 1999), but
rather in the final moments of Dec. 31, 1900.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty-thousand people gathered before the State House. Edward
Everett Hale read the Nineteenth Psalm,'' wrote historian Hillel
Schwartz in ``Century's End.'' As the clock struck midnight, ``the
trumpeters trumpeted, church bells pealed, chimes rang,'' and ``the
assembled thousands sang one of the national anthems.''
</P>
<P>
   And Boston was not eccentric on this point. ``Every major
newspaper and magazine officially welcomed the new century with
their first issue of January 1901,'' writes Stephen Jay Gould, the
Harvard University scientist, in ``Questioning the Millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   All told, it's clear we should not be celebrating the new
millennium this week. And yet, in recent weeks, I've been changing
my mind _ or, rather, expanding my perspective _ to the point where
I am no longer hostile to the popular view. In fact, I even feel
comfortable celebrating.
</P>
<P>
   Why? A better question might be: Why not? For, sweep away the
grand edifice of centurion or millennial time and it becomes clear
that the foundations of time as we know it are mere daydreams.
</P>
<P>
   Most units of time are grounded in nature. A day is defined by
the rotation of the earth. A month is set (more or less) by the
phases of the moon, a year (give or take a few hours) by the
earth's revolution around the sun.
</P>
<P>
   But the decade, the century, and the millennium have no basis in
nature whatever. They do have one thing in common: They are all
based on the number 10. And why is 10 the key number in human
counting? Why is our numeric system a base 10 system? Because we
have 10 fingers.
</P>
<P>
   If we had been born without pinkies (or worse, without thumbs),
we would probably have a base 8 numeric system (that is, the number
we now call 8 would be called 10, our 16 would be called 20, and so
forth). And in this frame of mind, we would not be thinking about
centuries or millennia at all right now. In a base 8 world, the
year that our decimal-driven culture calls 2000 would be known as
3720. The base 8 world's Year 2000 would have taken place back in
1024.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the measure and the very concept of centuries
and millennia are rooted in the chance material of human
experience.
</P>
<P>
   This raises another question: Why should anybody care when a
century or millennium begins or ends? Why should arguments over the
issue excite the passion they often do?
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz, in surveying past century-ends, offers an interesting
angle. He notes that the span of history was first laid out in
terms of centuries in the 13-volume ``Magdeburg Centuries,''
published in the late 1500s _ roughly coinciding with the
propagation of the Gregorian calendar, another new way of viewing
time.
</P>
<P>
   Both of these tools, Schwartz writes, were ``expressions of a
new anxiety over the passage of time,'' set in motion by
``Calvinist and proto-capitalist notions of thrift, economy, and
efficiency.''
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis on objective time, and our impulse to connect it to
the passage of personal time, solidified over the years (quite
apart from the tendency, in apocalyptic circles, to link the end of
centuries to the end of the world). By 1700, people started to
celebrate birthdays _ a product of the increasingly common usage of
calendar-dates in business, reinforced by the spread of household
clocks and pocket watches, which made possible and stiffened the
demands for punctuality.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 18th century, the measurements of time took on their
own character. The German word Zeitgeist _ ``spirit of the time'' _
first appeared around then.
</P>
<P>
   ``Centuries were, so to speak, Doppelgangers,'' Schwartz writes,
``coherent cultural entities in whose person and personality men
and women might recognize themselves.'' Knowing when exactly the
18th century ended and the 19th began became a matter of personal,
even spiritual importance _ a way for people to orient themselves,
and feel grounded, in the world and the universe.
</P>
<P>
   In still another sense, then, time and its divisions _
especially the most arbitrary divisions, decades and centuries _
are thought of and visualized in terms of how they are experienced.
</P>
<P>
   If the turning of a century is a profound occurrence, the
turning of a millennium is a monumental one. It is arguably even an
unprecedented one: In the 10th century, the last time this
happened, the world had no uniform calendar, no sense of centuries,
no agreed-upon New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   And so, at the end of this century and this millennium, what
will trigger the most powerful, the most palpably shuddering
experience of a change taking place in the annals of human events?
Not the transition from 2000 to 2001 (except, maybe, for Stanley
Kubrick fans). Rather, it's some cosmic blowup of the sensation
that comes with the repositioning of all the bits on a digital
clock, the rotation of all the numbers on a car's odometer: the
transformation from 1999 to 2000.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way the century should end, not with a whimper but a
bang.
</P>
<P>
   Party on, Mulder.

LOW ON THE HOG, AND PROUD OF IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CATHERINE FOSTER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I suspect I have a different relationship with oranges than do
most people. My father always placed one in the foot of our
Christmas stockings, as was the old Depression-era custom. Then, an
orange given for Christmas was a rare and wonderful gift _ a burst
of sweetness in a grim diet of oatmeal. My father carried on this
tradition and so our stockings would droop with the weight of this
instructive gift.
</P>
<P>
   There were many such instructive gifts, and sometimes our
shoulders drooped with the weight of them. My father never made a
big deal about it, but I think he wanted us to know the shadow that
lay behind the sunny, affluent '50s. His father had been the
wealthy owner of car dealerships. When sales plummeted in the '30s,
his family lost everything. They joined the migration from
Tennessee to California, where mother, father, and the two boys
lived in a studio apartment on Hollywood Boulevard and had to
accept charity food baskets. It took my grandfather 10 years to
find a permanent job. Six months later, he died of a heart attack
at his desk. So my father worked several jobs to put himself
through college and to support his mother. After graduation, he
took the first job he was offered, and kept it for 37 years.
</P>
<P>
   Despite acquiring the trappings of middle-class success, the
Depression lived on in my father. He did not trust the universe to
cup him in its big, safe palm, but acted as if any minute it might
tip him out again. He closely guarded the family pursestrings.
Once, when I was about 12, I wanted to buy a pair of what I thought
were reasonably priced shoes. I made a good case for them. He flat
out said no, we couldn't afford them. I stormed upstairs and
slammed my door. A little later, he trudged up to my room with a
pair of his own shoes. With tears in his eyes, and looking
embarrassed, he turned them over.
</P>
<P>
   There were holes in the soles.
</P>
<P>
   OK, OK, so it was a bit dramatic. But it worked: Not only was I
shamed out of even wanting those shoes, I threw myself into
planning how I could cut my own _ and everyone else's _ expenses.
The incident showed me that while we lived in a middle-class
neighborhood, we didn't quite inhabit that comfortable space. Some
measure of facade-maintenance was required.
</P>
<P>
   I became self-reliant, learning to sew, buy on sale, stay out of
debt, and always have insurance. That training kept me afloat
through lean years as an actress and then as a fledgling
journalist. At some point, my fortunes turned and I had enough
money. It was then that I realized that I had the Depression in my
DNA.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, when I have a good job and the economy is roaring
along, I am thrifty _ some say miserly. I've always bought used
cars _ and thought it a good thing, too. I got my legs waxed once
and thought, ``Well, that was a waste of $50.'' And not too long
ago, I found two green velvet chairs on the street _ and a matching
rug _ and quickly got them home before my conscience could kick in:
``Oh, please, leave that stuff for a student!''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, I can feel my own grip on my wallet loosen.
Last year, I went to St. Croix, the first time I'd splurged on a
vacation in the Caribbean. When a friend delicately suggested that
perhaps it was time for a new teakettle, I marched right down to
Crate and Barrel and got one. It wasn't cheap, either.
</P>
<P>
   I know that not all boomers are like this. Many of them are
spending their fool heads off on hulking SUVs and houses on
steroids. Sometimes I think we couldn't all have come from the same
generation. I finally concluded that they were probably raised by
the ``other'' kind of Depression-era parents, those who came
through determined to make pots of money and lavish on their
children that which they were denied.
</P>
<P>
   But surely there are some others like me out there, who were
raised by parents so seared by what they had gone through that they
felt the best way to protect their children from future disaster
was to live small and save _ and teach them to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   My father's experience has made me grateful for what I do have.
I don't have to buy day-old bread, like his mother did; I can buy a
fresh croissant at the bakery _ and even wash it down with a $3
cappuccino. I have plenty of shoes and none have holes. And in a
way, I like living low on the hog. It acts as a bracing corrective
to these gaudy times when every advertisement whispers, ``You don't
have enough. Just buy me and you will.'' Ha!
</P>
<P>
   Those who lived through the Depression are passing on every day.
As they go, so will their memories of those hard times, and the
strategies they developed to get by. But those of us who inherited
the Depression will carry it on.
</P>
<P>
   We second-generation tightwads are quiet but recognizable.
That's us you're passing on the road, in our ancient cars whose
six-digit odometer readings make us so proud. We're the ones who
keep too much of our money in savings instead of stocks, secretly
convinced the market is going to crash. Any day now. I like to
think we're thrifty because we're honoring, in the midst of excess,
those who did so much with so little. (More likely, though, it's
because we can't shake off our early programming.)
</P>
<P>
   Call us misers if you must, but we have the gift of being able
to look at an orange and see, not Vitamin C, but lives that were
squeezed to produce the juice we live on today. And that's worth
plenty.

<TEXT>
<P>
   For years, I had difficulty warming up to Thomas McGuane. While
his themes of macho disaffection and alienation in ``Ninety-two in
the Shade'' and ``The Bushwacked Piano'' are appealing, he worked
so hard on his sentences they broke out in the sweats. That was the
Tom McGuane of the Montana movie mafia who hung around with Peter
Fonda and Warren Oates and married actress Elizabeth Ashley and
wrote the original screenplay for ``The Missouri Breaks.'' He
played at being a cowboy. Now, he is one.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Some Horses,'' a brilliantly relaxed collection of nine
essays revolving around the author's dealings with cow ponies, the
mature McGuane exhibits a reportorial sense, allowing his subjects
center stage. And he's done a masterful job of presenting their
stories.
</P>
<P>
   McGuane is a sharp, observant lover of horses. As a writer, he
accomplishes the very difficult task of presenting these gifted
animals in all their glory without ever crossing over into
sentimentality.
</P>
<P>
   ``A horse can already do many of the things we require of it, if
we would just get out of the way and let them do it,'' he writes.
McGuane goes on to quote a friend from Oklahoma who said, ``God
made a perfect world but he would like one chance to redesign the
horse.'' Instead of simply leaving that statement to sit on its
own, McGuane elaborates, ``Certainly, some work could be done with
feet, hooks, suspensory tendons, navicular bones, all of which seem
far too delicate for the speed and weight of the horse. And too
often, the fifty feet of unsupported intestine acquires a simple
loop and kills the horse. If a horse were a Ford, the species would
vanish beneath lawsuits engendered by consumer-protection laws.''
</P>
<P>
   In many of the essays (several of which were previously
published in magazines), McGuane returns to the theme of man's
relationship to the horse, and how that connection implies a
certain philosophy of life earned by long hours in their company
and longer ones in front of a typewriter. Some trainers still
believe in ``breaking'' a horse _ that is, making the animal's life
so miserable that the poor beast eventually surrenders. McGuane
believes that method, aside from being cruel, also destroys the
horse's spirit.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Buster,'' a profile of Buster Welch, McGuane says that he
gave a copy of Eugen Herrigel's ``Zen in the Art of Archery'' to
the horseman. Buster ``concluded that its application to
horsemanship was that if you are thinking about your riding you are
interfering with your horse.''
</P>
<P>
   The domination of man over the horse, as exemplified by most
cowboy movies, is an idea whose time has passed. McGuane, in
writing about trainers and riders, weaves this theme seamlessly
through all the essays. Whether describing a rodeo competition or
the birth of a foal, McGuane never missteps. Through characters
with names such as Windy Spurgeon and places called Sweet Grass
County, Montana _ where McGuane lives with his wife and three
children _ he takes us through a world far from the movies and
publishing where he makes his living.
</P>
<P>
   These essays were not anthologized to make money _ neither the
subject matter nor the form screams best-seller list _ but to
suggest a way of doing things where money and status are not the
measure of a successful life. What matters most to McGuane is not
man's capacity to use intelligence and power to force an animal
into subservience, but the possibility that they can be used to
allow the horse to be a horse. Through a series of compromises and
understandings, horse and rider reach some sort of agreement that
may, given time and patience, evolve into friendship.
</P>
<P>
   An added touch are the black-and-white etchings by an artist
named Buckeye Black, which find the visual equivalent of McGuane's
prose. The angle of vision comes from an artist who has clearly
spent years transforming his impressions of horses into images of
forthright clarity.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't sense a kind of magic watching a horse take two
steps or put his nose under water or switch flies, there's no real
point,'' writes McGuane. If that sentence doesn't move you, don't
bother with this book. There's no real point.

HE COUNTS THE WAYS HE LOVES CRIME FICTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBIN W. WINKS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reviewers are busily compiling lists this time of year: best
books of the year, the decade, even the millennium; books attached
to a list of resolutions or the New Year; and among the
Anglophiles, most likely, sly notices about Boxing Day. This is a
mug's game, and while thinking about playing it, I fell into a a
reverie about why I continue to read crime fiction when so much of
it is, to tell the truth, so bad. Why do I have an old creamery
house full of 8,000 titles which, I allege, are the books that have
most significantly shaped the genre? Why do I care?
</P>
<P>
   Of course there are dozens of plausible answers, and on an
Oxford evening, as the dark settled in (at 4:30 this time of year),
some of them occur to me without much thought. There is, for
example, propinquity: reading books based on where you are, more or
less, right now, or at least on places one knows very well. In the
States I find I don't much enjoy Frances Fyfield: her attitudes are
so very English. But read in England they seem much better, for
they don't so much remind as explain. ``Staring at The Light''
(Viking, $23.95) is vintage Fyfield (if one may use such a term for
only a 10th book). Here we have a beautiful London lawyer, all
strong on the outside, inclined to be weak on the inside, tossing
about among lovers, working to help a man who is not likable, a man
who is threatened by his twin brother, Johnnyboy, who fears nothing
save the dentist's chair. Everyone speaks preciously and an air of
hauteur smothers the proceedings: ``Guy Fawkes favoured gunpowder
because that was what he knew. An artist, after his fashion.'' If
you like that opening, you'll probably like this book.
</P>
<P>
   Clive Egleton writes very British spy thrillers, and ``Dead
Reckoning'' (St. Martin's, $24.95) is quite good of its kind. The
pace is slow, careful, considered; the plot is entirely plausible,
even likely. A woman killed in a clinical psychiatrist's waiting
room in London's Holland Park section turns out to be using the
name of the wife of an SIS agent. This leads to the discovery that
the intelligence agency's personnel files have been accessed by a
hacker. A complex story involving Northern Ireland, the Russians,
and in-house rivalries comfortably covers le Carre territory
without becoming disturbing. One feels one knows these people, they
sit next to one at high table, and they seldom mean precisely what
they say, though by propinquity we may learn how to translate
behavior with more understanding.
</P>
<P>
   Displacement is another reason I, at least, read this stuff. If
three months of rain, very narrow roads, and train seats subtly too
small for the average human body begin to pall, one can visit Texas
for a while, the better to return to all the things about Britain
that truly are wonderful _ the pubs, the cheese courses, the
restaurants (yes, the restaurants). This wet month I was made dry
by Rick Riordan's ``The Last King of Texas'' (Bantam, $23.95,
forthcoming next month in the States), about how Tres Navarre,
private eye with a mouth, who improbably holds a PhD from the
University of California, sits down in the chair of a murdered
professor of English at the University of Texas, and tries to
figure out what is going on. The dead man was a medievalist, the
scene is San Antonio, and while there is many a person here who
doesn't mean what he or she says, they do it differently in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Frederic Bean's ``Murder at the Spirit Cave'' (Bantam, $8.99)
moves a little west and south, to Terrell County, a real-life place
which is one of those counties about the size of Wales and with a
population of maybe 2,000, and brings on the first woman to be
permitted to join the Texas Rangers. A young man's body is found in
a cave, scalped and mutilated, and an old Apache is accused. All of
this sounds quite predictable, and it proves to be so in the way
Fyfield and Egleton were predictable, and it's a comfort, for the
story is well told and, I suspect, were it to be read by a visiting
English scholar at, say, the University of Texas, that scholar
would find the whole mess very American and very irritating.
</P>
<P>
   One reads to be informed, naturally, and perhaps to kick-start a
piece of one's own writing. Stuck in an essay on environmental
history, I tried to rev up the motor with ``Habitat'' by Skye
Kathleen Moody (St. Martin's, $24.95). Here the investigator is
working for the US Fish and Wildlife Service. The scene is an
island off the coast of Washington State and the issue is the
saving of endangered species by cloning the embryos of rare
animals. The writing is a bit didactic but given my interests,
consistently intriguing; only the conclusion lets one down, but by
then I was up and back at my own writing, so I don't care.
</P>
<P>
   And one reads as vicarious experience, one form of which is
forewarning. Anyone who writes, and has ever been stuck in one
place, can take a lesson from ``The Mentor'' by Sebastian Stuart
(Bantam, $22.95). A writer whose first novel has carried him for 25
years is handed by his wife a research assistant about whom neither
of them knows anything like enough. The assistant wants to write,
and does, and the famous writer begins to help her. I have never
believed in having a research assistant and this book confirms
everything I have ever suspected. The story is compelling, sad, and
instructive, and a fine debut, but it has carried me back to
Britain in mind, where I am in body, ready to imitate those old
sidewalk artists who would draw in chalk a fantastic scene and then
write, usually in a circle nearby, ``All My Own Work.'' Always a
good idea, I think.

THE YEAR OF LISTING OBSESSIVELY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Poor 1999. Its biggest event may have been its very demise, the
turn of the you-know-what, the numerical phenomenon that happens
every 100 or 1,000 years or so. Event movies? There were plenty,
most notably `` Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace,'' which
took home $429 million in the states despite its dearth of heart
and soul. Event television? Oh, just about every week, particularly
when a nutty mensch named Regis Philbin was busy popping that
iconic, apocalyptic question: ``Is that your final answer?'' Event
pop music? Indeed. BRITNEY NEW QUEEN OF BUBBLEGUM! LATIN MUSIC
INVADES U.S.! BECK IS BACK! WOODSTOCK OR RAPESTOCK?
</P>
<P>
   But in 1999, an abundance of our cultural lives were spent
counting the days, listing the titles, chronicling the eras. We
were like Dustin Hoffman's autistic savant in ``Rain Man,''
obsessed with the importance of numbers, memory, order. A
psychologist might say we wanted to exert control over time. And
the world of entertainment accompanied us far into our
preoccupation, and I'm not talking about the Backstreet Boys'
massive ``Millennium,'' or that cheezy Ken Olin TV dud, ``Y2K.'' In
recent months, there were more classifications, reevaluations, and
celebrations of the past than seemed possible. In 1999, the Age of
Too Much Information and the Millennium met cute, and suddenly Kurt
Cobain and Andy Warhol and Albert Einstein and Jesus Christ were
everywhere, even on the glossies, with the list-o-maniacal
Entertainment Weekly devoting fat issues to ``The 100 Greatest
Moments'' in movies, TV, pop music, and celebrity. Naturally, TV's
savvy VH1 devised an addictive who's-the-best-ever series called
``The List'' to capitalize on the timely countdown.
</P>
<P>
   But 1999 was a fascinating period in pop culture, even if we've
looked back at it as little as we've read Tina Brown's magazine,
Talk, since its August launch. Will it help to begin the year
retrospective from a numerical point of view? George Clooney left
``ER'' after five seasons, and 36 million viewers watched. Monica
Lewinsky went on ``20/20'' for a one-on-one about the 42d
president, and 70 million watched. Stanley Kubrick's 13th feature,
``Eyes Wide Shut,'' was altered to avoid an NC-17, but took home
only $55.6 million. Fiona Apple released a celebrated second album
with a 90-word title. J. K. Rawling, age 34, enjoyed a massive cult
among Muggles with her Harry Potter books, of which there are 17.4
million in print. Susan Lucci won a Daytime Emmy after 18
nominations and 18 losses. Howard and Alison Stern split after 21
years. Pamela Anderson had 10-year-old implants removed, bringing
her from a 34D to a 34C. Oh, and the ``World'' ended _ ``Another
World,'' that is _ after 35 years.
</P>
<P>
   Of course the year's most interesting events escaped easy logic
and simple math. In 1999, new rules and new polarities seemed to be
emerging in music, movies, and TV, as pop culture continued to
frustrate the arrogant entertainment honchos who like everything
preordained. It was a year that encompassed a different set of
extremes from 1998, with Ricky Martin vs. Limp Bizkit, ``The
Phantom Menace'' vs. ``The Blair Witch Project,'' and ``Who Wants
to Be a Millionaire'' vs. ``The Sopranos.''
</P>
<P>
   At the movies, paint-by-number blockbusters did take their
predictable journeys to the top of the box-office charts. There
were flops _ Will Smith's ``Wild Wild West,'' Harrison Ford's
``Random Hearts'' _ but most of the high-profile projects paid off
big time, from the ``Phantom Menace'' to Julia Roberts's romantic
pair, ``Notting Hill'' and ``Runaway Bride.'' And ``The Thomas
Crown Affair,'' ``The World Is Not Enough,'' and ``Double
Jeopardy'' all performed as hoped.
</P>
<P>
   But still, the movies everyone talked about in 1999, the movies
that captured younger generations, the movies that studios lusted
after, were not made from the traditional Hollywood mold. They were
anything but formulaic, as they embraced the influence of video
games and the Internet, and their popularity seemed to prove our
willingness for more surprise and recklessness in our cineplex
affairs. Their motto could be this line from ``The Matrix'':
``Buckle your seat belt, Dorothy, because Kansas is about to go
bye-bye.'' And their poster boy could be Spike Jonze, the
music-video director whose first feature, ``Being John Malkovich,''
was applauded for its Kafkaesque originality. The enigmatic Jonze
also did an acting turn in ``Three Kings,'' another of the year's
acclaimed, disorienting movies, in which the Gulf War and global TV
culture merge.
</P>
<P>
   Of course the most debated of the newfangled crop of 1999 was
``The Blair Witch Project,'' the under-$100,000 production that
proved the power of simple storytelling and Internet promotion as
it went on to gross $140 million domestically. No high-tech horror
flick, it depended only on grainy hand-held camerawork and pure
dread for its thrill quotient. Despite a complicated plot about
virtual reality and the future, ``The Matrix'' also became a
surprise grosser at the box office, just as the mysterious, slowly
paced ``The Sixth Sense'' managed to draw huge audiences.
</P>
<P>
   You have to note a difference in a year when the most
Oscar-buzzed movie is ``American Beauty,'' a biting look at
suburban angst that features haunting metaphysical flourishes.
Let's just say it's not ``Father of the Bride.'' Meanwhile, a
director who once unfailingly met with critical embrace, Martin
Scorsese, seemed to fall by the wayside this year with his
``Bringing Out the Dead.''
</P>
<P>
   The world of television also underwent some tectonic activity in
1999. Oh sure, there were the usual TV ills _ the newsmagazines as
artificial as Diane Sawyer's smile, the overcoverage of tragedies
like the death of JFK Jr., and David E. Kelley's provocation
fixation, which brought us some hammy romantic kissing between Ally
and Ling on ``Ally McBeal.'' With only a few exceptions, sitcoms
were as brash and dumb as ever, showing no sign of shaking off
their post-``Seinfeld'' malaise. And wrestling continued to conquer
the world with ``WWF Smackdown!,'' the series that has kept the UPN
network afloat. The drone of racy TV was so constant that the
moralists and cranks neglected to put CBS on their redial button in
October when Mark Harmon used the ``S'' word on ``Chicago Hope''
for the first time ever on network TV. The moment passed unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   And once ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' mania and Philbin
fever erupted, the networks became preoccupied with the simplistic,
retro game-show format. The ``Millionaire'' phenomenon brought new
life to ABC in 1999, as it became the first series to outperform
NBC's Must-See Thursday night comedies in over a decade. A knockoff
of a British quiz show, it gave us easy questions, real people, and
Regis without the insipid Kathie Lee Gifford. Naturally, the other
networks cemented plans to imitate ABC shamelessly into the new
century, with Dick Clark set to host CBS's ``Winning Lines'' and
Maury Povich set for NBC's ``Twenty-One.''
</P>
<P>
   But quality TV still managed to rear its head and roar in 1999.
Despite dire predictions about the shrinking attention spans of
viewers, and despite a fall season that appeared to be solely
targeted to young people, the hourlong adult drama took over
prime-time series TV in 1999. The hits included ``Providence,''
``Family Law,'' ``The West Wing,'' ``Once and Again,'' ``Law &AMP;
Order,'' ``The Practice,'' ``Now and Again,'' ``Third Watch,''
``ER,'' and ``Judging Amy,'' a top-15 show that no one expected to
survive. The roster of successful drama was so crowded that, in a
controversial move, ABC decided to bump ``NYPD Blue'' to midseason
to milk the popularity of ``Once and Again,'' which occupied the
Tuesday-night slot. Steven Bochco was not pleased, to say the
least.
</P>
<P>
   The best drama of all was ``The Sopranos,'' which had an
important impact on TV beyond raising the creative bar. As critical
acclaim and word-of-mouth spread, the HBO series brought once
cablephobic viewers into the new world. It also struck fear in the
hearts of the networks, as it won 16 Emmy nominations in their
coveted series-TV categories. The networks long ago ceded the movie
Emmys to cable channels, but the specter of losing the most TV of
TV awards to cable did not go unnoticed. In the future, we may look
back at ``The Sopranos'' as one of the first serious cable
takeovers of series TV.
</P>
<P>
   The wave of young adult TV dramas in 1999 _ ``Roswell,''
``Freaks and Geeks,'' ``Popular,'' and ``Angel,'' to name a few _
failed to change the face of TV, as many critics expected. But teen
tastes played a huge role in pop music 1999, as a quick glance at
the grunge-free MTV would have revealed. There were new kids on the
block, and they were dancing their heads off.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, news from the hormonally charged pop world seemed to
pull in opposite directions. One minute, sex was selling harmless
teeny-bopper fantasies. The pretty Spice Boys (`N Sync, the
Backstreet Boys, 98 Degrees) and their pretty disco-ish
counterparts (Britney Spears and Christina Aguilara) were moving
lots of butt _ and record amounts of product. And sweet-tempered
Ricky Martin became a new sex symbol, as he sold more than 6
million albums and ignited a Latin-music invasion (along with
Jennifer Lopez, Marc Anthony, and Enrique Iglesias). The only
shadow on this candy-coated world was the disturbing rumor that
former Mouseketeer Spears, now 18, had undergone breast enhancement
to boost her career.
</P>
<P>
   But the next minute, sex was selling violence and misogyny, as
macho rap rockers like Limp Bizkit were moving impressionable lads
to be less than friendly to the opposite sex, memorably at
Woodstock '99, which reportedly turned into three days of sexual
harassment, fire, and rape. Amid appearances by Korn and Kid Rock
at the MTV Music Video Awards, a now grown-up Beastie Boy Adam
Horovitz accepted the award for best hip-hop video with a
condemnation of the treatment of women at Woodstock. Didn't folks
know that Spears was referring to the truth _ and not knuckles _
when she sang, ``Hit me baby one more time''? In between these pop
extremes, the year did see the release of plenty of good,
controversy-free music, ranging from Nine Inch Nails' ``The
Fragile'' and Chris Cornell's ``Euphoria Morning'' to Tom Waits's
``Mule Variations.''
</P>
<P>
   Will the same tensions mark the year 2000? Oh, the larger themes
_ money and quality _ are probably eternal, but the faces and
stories will surely change, just as last year's biggies _
``Titanic,'' Madonna's ``Ray of Light,'' the record payday for
``ER'' _ long ago receded into the woodwork. On the eve of the new
decade, the new century, and the new millennium, pop culture moves
at the speed of light. Next Big Things: You can count on 'em.

TV NETWORKS GROW BIGGER PLANS FOR `GROWTH' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As it has entered middle age, television has changed so rapidly
that it bears little resemblance to the medium's infancy, except in
one key respect: the concentration of power in a handful of large
companies.
</P>
<P>
   This was a year when the big TV networks got bigger and dreamed
of being biggest.
</P>
<P>
   To some outside observers, though, the renewed domination of
television by a few powerful corporations felt more like a
nightmare. They worried about diminished choices for consumers,
diminished opportunities for smaller competitors, and an overall
stranglehold on information exercised by major conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, with their audiences shrinking and their revenues
dwindling, the TV networks had been feeling the urge to merge. They
wasted little time moving in that direction once the Federal
Communications Commission changed its rules to allow television
companies to own more than one station in a given market.
</P>
<P>
   That led quickly to the blockbuster media marriage of the year:
a $37 billion merger between Viacom Inc. and CBS Corp. If approved
by the FCC, it would be the largest media deal in history.
</P>
<P>
   The Viacom-CBS merger would create a media juggernaut that could
command a huge share of the money spent on advertising each year.
It would also result in some strange corporate bedfellows by
uniting venerable, gray-haired CBS with such hip, young channels as
MTV and Nickelodeon.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, CBS chief Mel Karmazin and Viacom chairman Sumner
Redstone, the architects of the deal, are hoping for opportunities
for cross-promotion and ``synergy,'' with, for instance, CBS
serving as a television home for films produced by Viacom-owned
Paramount Pictures.
</P>
<P>
   But in weighing the merger, the FCC has to decide whether to
ease its rule against dual ownership of broadcast networks so the
new Viacom-CBS entity can own the UPN network, in which Viacom
holds a 50 percent stake. If the FCC allows it, that would mean
that two of the six broadcast networks _ along with many of their
local affiliates _ would be owned by a single company.
</P>
<P>
   Though not as sweeping as Viacom-CBS, the September deal between
NBC and Paxson Communications Corporation, the owner of the Pax TV
network, also is freighted with implications.
</P>
<P>
   NBC, which is owned by General Electric, agreed to pay $400
million for a 32 percent stake in Paxson, which boasts a lineup of
120 owned or affiliated stations that reach 75 percent of the
nation's TV audience. Under the terms of the deal, NBC can take
operating control of Pax TV in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, NBC is on the verge of having a second national
channel for programs that now air on the Peacock Network. Moreover,
as with the Viacom-CBS deal, NBC's deal with Paxson will greatly
expand its reach and its muscle with advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there were times this year when a company felt like
consolidating rather than expanding. For example, the Walt Disney
Co., owner of ABC, chose to combine its TV production studio, which
had been independent of ABC, with the network's entertainment
division. The ensuing power struggle ended with the resignation of
ABC Entertainment president Jamie Tarses, the first woman to head a
network entertainment division.
</P>
<P>
   But in general, a bigger-is-better ethos prevailed. The
high-profile agreements involving CBS and NBC were just the latest
proof that control over the production and distribution of
television programs now resides in fewer and fewer hands.
</P>
<P>
   Consider: Even before the Pax deal, General Electric owned not
just NBC but also CNBC, MSNBC, the Bravo channel, and American

   As the year drew to a close, talk of another blockbuster deal
bubbled up when News Corp. chief Rupert Murdoch claimed that
General Electric had offered NBC to Time-Warner for $25 billion. GE

   Nonetheless, speculation regarding that or other potential
blockbuster deals is unlikely to abate. This is one business that
is used to changing channels.

A FEW GEMS FROM THE SMALL SCREEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the end of the century, amid all the mediocrity and tin
laughter, TV hiccuped and out came a few truly superior pieces of
entertainment. The sitcom circa 1999 showed only small signs of
life, but the hourlong drama took a few strong strides forward.
Evidence No. 1: ``The Sopranos,'' of course. Those remote-holders
willful enough to leap to cable during prime time were rewarded
with creator David Chase's brilliant family series, the most
unexpected TV success since ``Twin Peaks'' caught on (not that the
two have much in common).
</P>
<P>
   Many of us were skeptical in January when HBO introduced the
series, yet another take on the mob. The subject has been done to
death, after all, and done by masters like Martin Scorsese and
Francis Ford Coppola. But while Chase borrowed from Scorsese, his
``Sopranos'' was like nothing before it. It merged the
dysfunctional-family obsession of the 1990s with made men whose
world had drifted so far from its glory days _ the honor-code era
of ``The Godfather'' _ that their despair was sympathetic. Yes,
they were killers and thieves, but the series gave them so much
dimension you couldn't help but temper your judgment, or at least
compartmentalize it as intensely as they do. An adulterer and a
cold-blooded murderer, Tony Soprano was still a big kid taking the
nurturing from his therapist that he'd never gotten from his
mother.
</P>
<P>
   The cast and their characters were unforgettable, notably Nancy
Marchand as the murderous matriarch and Edie Falco as Tony's fiery
wife, but the show's anchor was James Gandolfini. Quite simply, he
made Tony impossible to hate. Visually, Gandolfini flickers between
a threatening hothead and a puppy dog, with murderously heavy
eyelids one moment and then a Fred Flintstone body and a chunky
smile the next. And emotionally, and morally, he's just as shifty.
Each episode was rich, but the one in which he whacks a mob rat
while escorting daughter Meadow on a college tour captured the
series' ability to push us beyond easy judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Why did I put ``Will &AMP; Grace'' at No. 2? Partly because, as TV
comedy struggles in the wake of ``Seinfeld,'' it's the only newish
sitcom that works _ and I mean works in both senses of the word. It
works hard to make every line, every raised eyebrow, and every
pop-cultural reference count. And it works, in that the show feels
consistently honest, funny, and clever, insomuch as a sitcom can be
any of those. It has created four memorable characters, two of
whom, Sean Hayes's Jack and Megan Mullally's Karen, are already
worthy of TV's supporting-player Hall of Fame. They are unique
creatures who bask in their own fabulousness as much as we do. And
Will and Grace themselves get more interesting, and synchronous, as
the show continues.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly I honor ``Will &AMP; Grace'' for doing exactly what a
sitcom can do at its most powerful and most subversive: Use
laughter to open minds, to upend dated thinking, to turn
overanalyzed issues into jokes. The show is the gayest series ever
to hit the networks, and it's somewhat sophisticated in its
observations about gay life; and yet it is as mainstream as
mainstream gets in this splintered time. It takes both insiders and
outsiders and throws them together for half an hour of TV yuks.
Best of all, it never loses sight of its role as a sitcom, never
turns into a preachy treatise. Maybe that's why, in its second
year, it remains free of anti-gay controversy, leaving Jerry
Falwell and like-minded folks to ponder the troubling triangularity
of TV's Teletubbies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The West Wing'' is gradually turning into the fall season's
best new show. Like ``Sports Night,'' the other series from creator
Aaron Sorkin, it flirts dangerously with sentimentality and easy
liberal thinking as it portrays the workings of the presidential
office. But at its best it also boasts some of the smartest
script-writing this side of ``The Sopranos,'' with wonderfully
tense interoffice confrontations and juicy philosophical
quandaries. The characters are beautifully performed, particularly
John Spencer's chief of staff and Allison Janney's press secretary,
and the camerawork is as sophisticated as that in most movies. If
Sorkin can resist the impulse to manipulate audiences, ``The West
Wing'' could become a keeper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sex and the City,'' another HBO series, had a spectacular
second season. This explicit comedy about single life in Manhattan
is written out of the gritty wisdom and black humor that comes from
experience. Yes, the show's four central women are unable to think
about anything but finding the right man; but along the way they
are learning about love, self-protection, and the power of their
friendship with one another. For many folks, that's the way the
world of urban romance works, like it or not. The resolution of
Carrie's relationship with Mr. Big was witty, subtle, and touching,
as it sampled ``The Way We Were,'' but best of all it revealed a
character who had grown as a result of her pain. As Carrie, Sarah
Jessica Parker was comic and moving, and her three supporting
actresses were equally appealing. You won't find such rich roles
for women on most of network TV.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, I put ``The Practice'' at the top of my list, noting
its addictive storytelling and strong ensemble. But while it
finished its third season in triumph in May, and picked up a few
Emmys including best drama, it has been annoyingly uneven since it
returned in September. Lately, for every tart bit of dialogue,
there have been painfully unbelievable storylines, glaring
character inconsistencies, and frivolous office spats that clash
with the show's tone. The worst offense was when the ongoing George
Vogelman plot, which brought us the haunting and campy image of the
murderer in a nun's outfit, was thrown away with a quickie
resolution that was as thrill-free as a careless B movie. Other
offenses included an inane wedding-dress debate and the decision to
diminish the presence of Camryn Manheim. Still, half a year of
topnotch ``Practice'' is better than a full year of most shows.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its emotional excesses, the post-divorce melodrama
``Once and Again'' is one of the most honest shows on TV. For
proof, just compare Sela Ward's tense scenes with her children to
the Hallmark moments between fellow single TV mother Amy Brenneman
and her daughter on ``Judging Amy.'' Eventually, ``Once and Again''
may need to reach beyond the strains of a second-time-around
relationship, and some humorous moments wouldn't hurt. But for now,
the show is adult angst at its most engaging.
</P>
<P>
   ``Action,'' oh ``Action.'' I grieve this ambitious comedy, which
Fox mishandled by slotting it against NBC's Thursday Must-See
lineup. Ultimately, though, ``Action'' was probably canceled
because it was too venomous for prime-time America. It was a vulgar
half-hour, after all, with hookers, pimps, actors, and producers in
all kinds of compromising positions. But then it was a portrait of
a vulgar world: Hollywood. As the amoral action producer Peter
Dragon, Jay Mohr was perfect _ too perfect, perhaps, since most TV
viewers like a hero with at least one redeeming quality. The
post-``Hill Street Blues'' era has proven our ability to accept
flawed characters, but, apparently, not this flawed. During its
short life, the laugh-track-free ``Action'' didn't talk down to
viewers as it traded in a genre that network TV hasn't fully
explored: satire. Let's hope the series was ahead of its time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freaks and Geeks'' deserves a Top 10 slot for its casting
alone, with its authentic collection of awkward adolescents. But
the magic of this warm high school dramedy, which is set in the
early 1980s, is that it restores bare innocence to the teenage
years at a time when that innocence is obscured by facile hipness
and media savvy (``Dawson's Creek''). ``Freaks and Geeks'' dissects
the classically painful moments among teenagers, from the fear of
competitive sports to the need for a clique. As Lindsay Weir, a
former ``mathlete'' nerd trying to express her individuality with a
clique of freaks, Linda Cardellini is an unassuming star. She makes
courage look as hard as it is worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   My cheap thrill was ``The E! True Hollywood Story,'' which sucks
me in whenever I stumble across it. It veers dangerously into
tabloid-fabrication territory, but ultimately it's just a cheesy
dish that makes A&AMP;E's ``Biography'' look like homework. My classy
thrill was a two-part installment of ``Masterpiece Theatre'' called
``Shooting the Past,'' which paid homage to the magic of
old-fashioned black-and-white photography, as well as the necessity
of eccentricity in the human character. And my honorable mentions
include the witty horror of ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' the
playful ensemble of ``Friends,'' the endless pop countdowns of
``The List,'' and the classy college distress of ``Felicity.''

MOVIES RECENTLY REVIEWED IN THE BOSTON GLOBE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   !!! 1/2 ``All About My Mother'' Pedro Almodovar's genuflection
to the staying power and coping abilities of women. Mischievously
blurring sexual lines, it's loaded with Almodovar's trademark
saturated color and farcical rambunctiousness. A terrific ensemble
_ Cecilia Roth, Marisa Paredes, Penelope Cruz, Antonia San Juan _
keeps the screwball soap opera humming. (R)
</P>
<P>
   !!! 1/2 ``Anne Frank's Diary'' This superb animated version of
the familiar story celebrates the young diarist but doesn't put her
on a pedestal. It will educate young viewers about the Holocaust
and World War II; at the same time, it is a rich, personal story
that will appeal to all ages. The animation style is simple yet
gorgeous, with compositions that are always interesting. (Unrated)
(Betsy Sherman)
</P>
<P>
   !! 1/2 ``Any Given Sunday'' You practically need a face mask to
sit through Oliver Stone's sentimentalization of the macho clashes
built into pro football. It keeps coming at you, keeps hammering
you, and has no business being as entertaining as it is. It's too
long, and plays like a hard-fought win in the mud, but Al Pacino's
coaching throwback and Cameron Diaz's bottom-line-driven owner help
keep things lively. (R)
</P>
<P>
   (FR) !! 1/2 ``The End of the Affair'' Exquisitely crafted but
frustratingly waterlogged. It's based on Graham Greene's
semiautobiographical novel about a sexy affair during World War II:
Ralph Fiennes plays the novelist and Julianne Moore the woman
trapped in a passionless marriage. The story really heats up when
he obsesses over the reason she inexplicably breaks off the
romance, but Neil Jordan's sensitive adaptation and the handsomely
modulated acting never succeed in igniting it. (R)
</P>
<P>
   !!! 1/2 ``42 UP'' Michael Apted began interviewing 14 British
schoolchildren in 1962, when they were 7, and has gone back to
update their stories every seven years. This sixth installment,
benefiting from the cumulative weight of our longstanding
acquaintance with them, deepens our respect for the resilience of
the 11 still on board. Some began as friends. Some became friends.
And now they're our friends, too. (Unrated)
</P>
<P>
   !!! 1/2 ``Cradle Will Rock'' Tim Robbins goes back to the '30s
to evoke a time when art and politics and passion fused as never
before. The story, featuring such period notables as Orson Welles
and Nelson Rockefeller, is red-blooded and committed as it turns
the premiere of an agitprop opera and the destruction of an
anti-capitalist mural into vibrant political cartooning. (R)
</P>
<P>
   !!! ``Galaxy Quest'' This clever, affectionate sendup of ``Star
Trek'' writes in Trekkies, too. Menaced aliens spacejack actors
whose series was canceled, believing they're real intergalactic
heroes. Tim Allen as the Kirk figure, Alan Rickman as a Spock with
a Klingon look, and Sigourney Weaver as a space babe deliver
heads-up performances. The bad guys look like angry lobsters; the
good aliens are sweetly goofy. (PG)
</P>
<P>
   !! 1/2 ``Man on the Moon'' Skilled mimic that he is, Jim Carrey
delivers a superb impersonation of envelope-pushing comic Andy
Kaufman, who before his 1984 death opened the door to comedy's
mainstreaming of alienation. But this biofilm by Milos Forman never
gets beneath the skin in which Kaufman was so uncomfortable: We
never get the inner Kaufman. (R)
</P>
<P>
   !! 1/2 ``Sweet and Lowdown'' Woody Allen's string of riffs on
the theme that living with a genius is not an emotionally rewarding
proposition (a notion that's not exactly new, if you've been
watching his recent movies). Although the concept is big, the film
_ which owes a lot to Fellini's ``La Strada'' _ seems slight. It's
worth watching mainly for the resourcefulness Sean Penn brings to
the central role of a Depression-era jazz guitarist, cocky on the
outside, frightened on the inside, running from intimacy, heartsick
because he knows he'll never match his hero, Django Reinhardt.
(PG-13)
</P>
<P>
   !!! 1/2 ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' Anthony Minghella's slick,
twisty, top-of-the-line crime thriller has seductively sensual
textures and richly faceted performances. Foremost among them is
Matt Damon's, as a scheming social climber with a homosexual crush
on Jude Law's rich contemporary in Italy in the late '50s, when la
vita was dolce. Gwyneth Paltrow's betrayed fiancee, Cate
Blanchett's rich girl craving social entree, and Philip Seymour
Hoffman's moneyed sadist add to the malignant glitter of this dark
entertainment, which knows the anatomy of corruption. (R)

`AMERICAN BEAUTY' OUTSTANDING IN A ROSY YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It must have been a good year for film, a better year than
usual. I can tell because I feel really grumpy about leaving
certain films off the annual list of 10 best. Who invented these
absurd, tyrannical lists anyway? Some years they could stop at five
films. Some years, they should expand to 20. In addition to my Top
10, one can as easily argue for ``Magnolia,'' ``The Straight
Story,'' ``Three Kings,'' ``The Cider House Rules,'' ``All About My
Mother,'' ``The Emperor and the Assassin,'' ``Run Lola Run,''
``Election,'' ``The Winslow Boy,'' ``The War Zone,'' ``Snow Falling
on Cedars,'' ``Autumn Tale,'' ``The King of Masks,'' ``Rosie,''
``My Son the Fanatic,'' ``Tumbleweeds,'' and ``Xiu-Xiu: The
Sent-Down Girl.'' How many is that? 30? Did I mention that I hate
lists?
</P>
<P>
   No matter how long the list, ``American Beauty'' has to head it.
It's classic black humor driven by Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening,
and Sam Mendes in his directing debut. All come from the world of
the stage and enjoyed a long rehearsal period that paid off.
Spacey's platonic essence of midlife crisis, Bening's angry wife
expressing her rage in terrifying orderliness, even the alienated
teen characters _ are brilliant and riveting. Perhaps that's what
is most remarkable. Films about kids usually are about 20 years
behind in their references, and don't really care about kids
anyway. ``American Beauty'' is the most invigorating American film
since ``L. A. Confidential.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Being John Malkovich'' is the most original, not only for its
ability to goof on an imagined meeting place between our consumer
culture and our materialist culture, where you buy your 15 minutes
of fame by getting inside the head of someone famous, in this case
Malkovich. There's almost nothing in it that isn't dazzling,
starting with John Cusack's alienated puppeteer reinventing
``Petruchka,'' Catherine Keener's barbed-wire entrepreneur, Cameron
Diaz's frumped-down do-gooder making neurotic animals even more
neurotic, and Orson Bean giving the film the ``Alice in
Wonderland'' quality it's after by ushering us into the portal that
takes us inside John Malkovich's head and spits us out on the New
Jersey Turnpike.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boys Don't Cry'' has rightly attracted kudos for Hilary
Swank's performance as Brandon Teena, a woman trying to live as a
man in small-town Nebraska and for Chloe Sevigny's portrayal of the
local girl whose dreams are awakened by Teena. But it's got more,
including enough texture to impart a sense of mounting dread at
what you can see coming and Teena can't. ``The Buena Vista Social
Club'' is just the opposite, the year's purest filmic excursion
into joy. It's not just Wim Wenders's and Ry Cooder's ability to
recapture the soaring high spirits in the music-making of Cuban
musicians put on ice for three decades by Castro, then reawakened
as if by magic. It's also a matter of Wenders's camerawork
capturing a Cuba of crumbling grandeur turned hauntingly beautiful
by coral-colored sunsets in a land where cars are held together
with duct tape and baling wire.
</P>
<P>
   ``An Ideal Husband'' sublimely restores to us Oscar Wilde's
glittering language and underappreciated humanism, with sterling
performances by Rupert Everett as an aristocratic idler trying not
to let his goodheartedness get him into trouble and Julianne Moore
as a femme not quite fatale. ``An Ideal Husband'' subtly masks its
editing of Wilde's text.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mansfield Park'' all but flaunts its departures from Jane
Austen's third novel. But if it tweaks the letter, it's true to the
spirit of all Austen's novels. The thing that makes them so modern
is their way of making their Austen surrogates choose between love
and money. Frances O'Connor, filled with quicksilver beauty, is as
deftly intelligent as any of Austen's heroines. Director-adapter
Patricia Rozema makes it ever so clear that its rich family's money
comes from the slave trade. Another piece of inspired casting:
Harold Pinter's understandably gloomy paterfamilias.
</P>
<P>
   Erick Zonca's ``The Dreamlife of Angels'' from France and Luc
and Jean-Paul Dardenne's ``Rosetta'' from Belgium are the two best,
most compassionate, most urgent, most memorable working-girl films.
Or, rather, they would be if the young women at the center of each
could find work. But they can't. How this shapes their lives is
something the performances of Elodie Bouchez and Emilie Dequenne
won't let you forget. Unemployment _ not yet called downsizing _ is
the issue animating Tim Robbins's marvelous ``Cradle Will Rock.''
Rather than stage the entire agitprop opera of that name, which
would have been a mistake because it's too simplistic, Robbins
wraps the entire world of the '30s around it, not always
convincingly, but always pungently, with the same mix of art and
politics and passion that made that decade our most artistically
vibrant one.
</P>
<P>
   Just ahead of it is another documentary, Errol Morris's ``Dr.
Death: The Rise and Fall of Fred A. Leuchter, Jr.'' There's simply
nothing like this riveting study of a nerdy electric-chair,
gas-chamber, and lethal-injection whiz, recruited by neo-Nazis to
bolster their Holocaust-denying. You can all but hear Morris's
investigative acuity and stylistic originality click into place in
this film that reminds you that ``Schindler's List'' did not have
the last word on the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   It also has been a vintage year for animation. ``Toy Story 2''
you know about. It deserves the praise it has drawn, here and
elsewhere. If you missed ``Iron Giant,'' too bad. It was
impressive, but came and went and is now on video. Ditto for
Disney's treetop-surfing ``Tarzan.'' Most impressive of all the
1999 arrivals, however, is the Japanese import, ``Princess
Mononoke.'' If any single work will mainstream Japanese anime, it's
this one. It's got a multitiered story line, a hardly revolutionary
but markedly different drawing style and a way of making nature
part of its world that you won't find in any American counterpart.
It's grander, fuller, deeper, more reverberant than all but a few
feature films.
</P>
<P>
   That brings us to the coveted 10th and last spot, which I have
no hesitation in ceding to Anthony Minghella's slick, twisty take
on Patricia Highsmith's ``The Talented Mr. Ripley.'' The news here
will be Matt Damon playing a gay schemer, but the whole cast _
Gwyneth Paltrow, Jude Law, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Cate Blanchett _
is top-notch. Effortlessly, they conjure up the Europe of the
1950s, when it was a playground for rich Americans and a breeding
ground for those determined to fleece them. This probably is also
the place to say that while I thought ``The Blair Witch Project''
wasn't as terrific a film as its numbers indicated, I love the fact
that it shook up the monoliths because it was so big and they
didn't have a single finger in the pie. I love that. But I can't
stand lists. Did I say that?

THE MIXED-UP, SHOOK-UP YEAR THAT WAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN ANDERMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Creamy thighs and perfect navels set the artistic mood,
assembly-line dance tracks replaced ingenuity and integrity, and
the ensuing shrieks probably damaged the ozone layer. It was the
Year of Teen Pop. Britney, Christina, and Jessica (that's Spears,
Aguilera, and Simpson, for those who have recently returned from
another planet) ruled the charts, in tandem with a clutch of
handsome harmonizing young men _ Backstreet Boys, 'N Sync, 98
Degrees, LFO, and plenty more you won't hear about until they move
20 gazillion units. Summer of '99 will be forever remembered as a
sweltering tribute to the buying power of impressionable youth.
</P>
<P>
   Not that we're complaining. This is, after all, the popular
culture _ emphasis on popular, as the behemoth becomes increasingly
driven by commerce rather than curiosity. Consumer-targeted trends
and analyst-approved product vie with groundbreaking, deeply felt
innovation for our attention. Fortunately, pop culture is
perpetually striving toward equilibrium, and fluffy fads are
invariably balanced by dark, artful investigations _ and 1999 was
no exception.
</P>
<P>
   As if in answer to the music gods' prayers (corporate mergers
have left these once-powerful divinities with a mere shadow of
their former clout), Nine Inch Nails and Rage Against the Machine
released profoundly ambitious, intensely realized CDs, ``The
Fragile'' and ``The Battle of Los Angeles,'' respectively. Red Hot
Chili Peppers put out ``Californication,'' easily the most mature,
gratifying album of their career. Those three alone carried enough
weight to make it the Year of Deep, Right-Headed Rockers.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Martin shook his bon-bon all over the Oscars last spring,
and in short order Carlos Santana racked up the first No. 1 single
of his 30-year career. Cosmic confluence or lucky chance? Anyway
you look at it, it was the Year of Latin Music. Or perhaps more
accurately, it was the year superstars of Latin heritage saturated
the pop mainstream with English-language albums and Santana got
what he deserved. Martin, Marc Anthony, and Enrique Iglesias were
the It boys; Jennifer Lopez (she can't sing, but her album cover
hit all the right notes) and Christina Aguilera (who sings so well
she needn't rely so heavily on her midriff) were both, amazingly,
key figures in two trends: Latin surnames and cheesy disco. Best of
all, the Latin-pop boom paved the way for more worthwhile Latin
artists to be heard: Buena Vista Social Club, Cafe Tacuba, and a
slew of other acts that rode Ricky's twitchy hips to greater
stateside notoriety.
</P>
<P>
   It was a bad year for women in rock, who were for the most part
absent from the radar screen, a.k.a. Billboard charts. So it was
with little fanfare that we happily experienced the Year of the
Female Singer-Songwriter With no Coffeehouse Roots. Jewel, Sarah
McLachlan, and Paula Cole faded into the touchy-feely woodwork as
we basked in the attitudinal glow of Fiona Apple's dazzling
sophomore effort (``When the Pawn . . .''), Macy Gray's quirky,
seductive debut (``On How Life Is''), and Mary J. Blige's hardcore
testimony (``Mary'').
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, even the cultural imperative for balance doesn't explain
the lame and unfortunate existence of Kid Rock, Eminem, Limp
Bizkit, and Insane Clown Posse. It was the Year of Rap-Rock Goons.
They ushered anything resembling humanity out the door, and
embraced misogyny with a brutal fervor. Witness Woodstock '99.
Sorry, you sick dudes, the twisted humor/bad childhood excuse just
doesn't cut it.
</P>
<P>
   Lest we let all this talk of music and culture obscure our view
of what's really happening, it almost goes without saying that it
was the Year of the Internet, Again. Last year, the big news was
indie acts using the Web to promote and distribute their music,
bypassing altogether the demon Goliaths of the music industry: the
labels, the press, radio, and MTV. Now virtual storefronts,
personalized jukeboxes, and state-of-the-art song downloads are as
common as busted jewel boxes. In 1999, the industry launched a mad
scramble to catch up with the cyberworld.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is the hot new promotional tool (Britney Spears was
an on-line phenom before her debut album was released), the hot new
way to sell concert tickets (750,000 of them in less than an hour
for the Backstreet Boys' 11-week tour this fall), and the hot new
listening destination. More and more radio stations are streaming
(that's broadcasting worldwide on line). Labels are rushing to
hammer out legislation that will address on-line sales and MP3
downloading technology. The Internet record label Atomic Pop
created a new business model for industry, and more on-line labels
are on the way.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, two figures from the early '90s Seattle grunge movement
put out delicious pop albums: Chris Cornell, of the late, lamented
band Soundgarden, released ``Euphoria Morning,'' and former Nirvana
drummer Dave Grohl's Foo Fighters got the hell out of Dodge,
relocated to a Virginia suburb, and in the process stumbled onto
the ultimate rock 'n' roll epiphany (which also doubles as a handy
album title): ``There Is Nothing Left to Lose.'' It was the Year
Grunge Went Pop. OK, Everclear has been doing it for years. But
this year's model smells like postgraduate teen spirit. Cornell
threw a bold curve with a beautiful singer-songwriter project, and
Grohl made punk safe for grown-ups _ something of an oxymoron. But
that's another story.

THE NET GETS PAST ITS BABY STEPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's Howdy Doody time on the Internet _ at least when it comes
to online entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   This was, after all, the year that the Internet emerged as the
Next Big Thing in Hollywood, with producers scrambling to invent a
new form of digital entertainment. It was like the days of early
television; there was a kind of giddy excitement about the creative
potential of this new medium, tempered by a fear that it has
already become a great global commercial. As for the programming
itself, most initial Web shows (offered by upstarts like Den.net
and Pseudo.com and major studios like by Warner Bros.) were as
primitive as early television, with frequent technical glitches,
grainy Webcasts, crude story lines, and characters that will some
day seem as inexplicable as Buffalo Bob or Milton Berle.
</P>
<P>
   One thing was clear, in popular culture as well as the fine
arts: Nobody can afford to ignore the Internet anymore. The fine
art market, one of the most elitist of trades, went on line with a
vengeance, with venerable institutions like Sotheby's joining
dozens of start-ups targeting first-time art buyers. Likewise, the
music industry, which had fought the medium, finally accepted the
inevitability of on-line distribution via such technologies as MP3.
</P>
<P>
   But the great Net/entertainment breakthrough of the year
occurred in the independent film industry. We're talking about
``The Blair Witch Project,'' the low-budget horror film that became
a phenomenon on line long before it even opened in theaters. The
quality of the film by two unknown artists didn't matter as much as
the on-line buzz, and its overwhelming success at the box office
added to the mad dash to create on-line programming. Everybody
wanted to create the next ``Blair Witch,'' and big names such as
Sam Donaldson and Drew Carey and Adam Sandler tried on-line
experiments, with limited success (unless you prefer a kittenish
Donaldson to his old bulldog persona).
</P>
<P>
   But the real message of the ``Blair Witch'' success had nothing
to do with existing celebrities: It proved that real-life nobodies
can become virtual superstars through the power of this mass
medium. Just ask Mahir Cagri, the Turkish Lothario who invited the
whole world to his house on his earnest Web site and won
international acclaim. Just ask Zack Exley, the Somerville computer
programmer whose on-line parody of George W. Bush became an issue
in the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   There was still room for individuals to get their message across
on line _ even as the media giants carved out their territory in
cyberspace. A modest fellow named John Breen figured out how to
harness the power of the Internet for a good cause with a simple
initiative called thehungersite.com. At the site, individuals click
on the words ``DONATE FREE FOOD''; sponsors, in turn, donate money
per click to the United Nations World Food Program. The efforts of
this one computer programmer from Indiana had more of a long-term
effect on the public consciousness than the big, splashy
corporate-sponsored NetAid Web site, a United Nations project that
wasn't able to attract a devoted following despite three
star-studded concerts in October.
</P>
<P>
   Individuals also flocked to the Internet during the conflict in
Kosovo, the first ``cyberwar.'' Individuals on all sides became
self-appointed war correspondents, making it possible for ordinary
folks all over the world to track the human tragedy (not to mention
the propaganda) in real time. Communication will never be the same.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the Kosovo crisis proved the Internet's power as the
ultimate mass medium. But let's not get too rosy about it. For all
of its democratic potential, the Net is still driven by commerce,
and it got even more commercial in 1999. Witness one of the biggest
Net events of the year _ the Great Victoria's Secret Affair. After
the lingerie maker aired a 30-second commercial during the Super
Bowl, some 1 million voyeurs ran to their computers to check out
VictoriasSecret.com. The site was overloaded with would-be viewers
eager to check out the fine points of the site, notably the minimal
apparel on model Tyra Banks. This single event showed both the
potential and the limitations of the Internet as a marketing tool
(as well as the everlasting appeal of pixel-perfect models.)
</P>
<P>
   But some folks offered a counterpoint to all the on-line ads and
e-commerce schemes. A nonprofit organization called Web Lab
continued to fashion itself as a sort of PBS of the Internet; this
year, it launched on-line discussion groups about the PBS
documentary ``An American Love Story,'' bringing together strangers
to participate in intimate _ and volatile _ debates about race and
class. And the Boston Cyberarts Festival focused exclusively on
digital art, bringing a dose of purity to the overwhelmingly
commercial medium.
</P>
<P>
   The Cyberarts Festival offered a chance to stand back from the
gee-whiz commercialism and simply ask, ``Why?'' This was, after
all, a year when the line between fact and fiction blurred on line.
Everything was entertainment; everything was for sale. Some Web
sites advertised medical procedures _ live births and liposuction _
as if they were episodes on ``ER.'' Former child star Gary Coleman
tried to resurrect his flagging career by selling off his personal
junk in an on-line ``charity'' auction. One savvy performance
artist satirized this thirst for attention, this desire to bare it
all for a bit of fame, by putting his own demographics up for bid
on eBay; alas, nobody made an offer. Maybe next year.

FINDING THE UNDENIABLE FUN IN FLOTSAM AND JETSAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nineteen ninety-nine: The year of living vacuously?
</P>
<P>
   A case could be made. There was a world of empty cheer and
blustery rage out there. You have Britney, Christina, Jennifer,
Jessica, and Shania _ all those bare midriffs and frothy songs. You
have Backstreet Boys, `N Sync, and Ricky Martin _ good looks and
hip thrusts. Over on the rage-against-anything front, there's Limp
Bizkit and Kid Rock _ flailing away with their sexist blather and
big stupid noise. There was paint-by-numbers aggro-rock with Creed,
filling the generic Pearl Jam slot, and Orgy scoring with a New
Order cover.
</P>
<P>
   Then there were the overemoting divas _ Whitney, Celine, Mariah
_ where melodramatic octave-jumping equals success. Jewel? Pop
poetry at its most banal. Sting is still with us, being mature and
boring. As I write, Rosie O'Donnell's Christmas album is climbing
the charts as Billboard's ``greatest gainer'' (Dec. 18).
</P>
<P>
   If you're a rock fan, it's enough to make you want to crawl
under a rock.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone who has hopes that pop or rock music should have some
semblance of substance _ be it be grit, passion, or innovation _
1999 has been a highly disappointing year. Well, by one yardstick,
at least. That is the most obvious one: Who's Hot and Who's Not as
determined by MTV, radio, People magazine and Entertainment Weekly
covers, TV specials, newspaper features, and sales figures. The
mainstream media have bought into the notion that a hit single (or
two) merits widespread attention, much of it uncritical. The echo
boomers have the disposable income and youth must be served. Now
more than ever.
</P>
<P>
   So: If 1999 was such a cruddy year, why did I (and a whole lot
of other people) have so much fun with music?
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, there is a lot more than the flotsam and jetsam
floating at the top of the charts. When I first started writing
seriously about pop music, in the mid-1970s, the best stuff was
found way outside the mainstream. You had to dig and dig. Over the
years, critical and popular curves have come close together,
intersected and gone their separate ways. It's always in flux, but
1999 was a year of a great divide, at least in these quarters.
Great discs came from Nine Inch Nails, Moby, the Flaming Lips,
Beck, the Lo-Fidelity All-Stars, Blur, David Bowie, the Red Hot
Chili Peppers, the Beta Band, Steve Earle, the Offspring,
Underworld, and Eurythmics, among others.
</P>
<P>
   CDs and tapes are fine, in the car or at home, but they're more
of a solitary pleasure. A lot of the joy and stimulation in 1999
came from the concerts, where you and dozens, hundreds, or
thousands of others are there for, and focused on, the same thing.
It's a form of group bonding, a case of feeling less alone in a
hostile world. When it's working you become part of a club _
whether it's a big one, as at a FleetCenter show by Bruce
Springsteen and the E Street Band, or a small one, as at the
Delgados show at the VFW Post in Cambridge. At a concert, you're
hearing _ you hope anyway _ the best of an artist's body of work,
whether it's one album or more than a dozen albums deep. By buying
a ticket, you're supporting the notion that this artist has
something to say, has ways to move you that may be of the moment
but nevertheless transcend the moment. In the case of veteran
artists, you're saluting their past, embracing their present,
hoping they have a future.
</P>
<P>
   As to concerts in the Boston area, it was tough to whittle the
list down to a top 10. As a fan of clubland _ that is, rock that
works on a more intimate scale _ I'm a little surprised to find my
year-end tally favors shows in larger venues. But my contenders
certainly played all kinds of spaces. Among them: Afghan Whigs at
the Paradise, Blondie at the Orpheum, Trans Am at the Middle East
Downstairs, Bryan Ferry at Berklee Performance Center, the
Residents at Copley Theater, Gomez at the Middle East Downstairs,
Angels of Light (featuring Michael Gira) at the Middle East
Downstairs, Buzzcocks at the Paradise, the Damned at the Paradise,
Brendan Perry at the Paradise, Robbie Williams at the Paradise, the
Del Fuegos reunion at the Middle East Downstairs, the Guiness
Fleadh at Suffolk Downs, featuring Shane MacGowan and the Popes.
</P>
<P>
   As for the list, well, any year Bruce Springsteen and the E
Street Band reunite and play town, it's a pretty safe bet that show
will top it.

   Y2KLIST _ WASHINGTON _ A quick checklist of good and bad ideas
for the final four days of 1999. Bad ideas: Stockpile gasoline; buy
guns; take out a huge pile of cash that could be stolen; make plans
to call everyone you know at 12:01 a.m. Jan. 1. Good ideas: If you
need cash for the long weekend, get it now and not on Friday
evening in the dark at an ATM; fill up several clean containers
with tap water; make sure the batteries in your flashlights are
working; check your prescriptions so you don't run out of important
medications on Jan. 1. (Geewax, Cox News Service). 25.

   MILITARY-MEDICINE _ WASHINGTON - The Pentagon's strapped medical
care program, which received an emergency $600 million
appropriation in the middle of the fiscal year that ended in
September, has been quietly shifting costs from military hospitals
to Tricare contractors, the companies that provide medical care for
active duty and retired personnel and dependents. This means that
after it spent the extra $600 million the military medical system
is between $500 million and $1 billion in arrears and will go broke
if it does not receive an additional shot in the fiscal arm.

new, built yesterday or the day before. In fact we are in our
10,000th year of human habitation, our 486th year of recorded
history, our 154th year of statehood. But much of Florida's history
over the past 1,000 years must be re-created, re-enacted, to be
seen. Outside of St. Augustine, outside of some old towns in North
Florida where the light of elder days still shines on old
brick-faced downtowns and oak-shaded graveyards, our yesterdays
have been scanted for our big tomorrows. Here is a brief, backward
glance, a small photo album of our comings and goings. Much has
come and gone, never to come again. (Browning, Palm Beach Post).

&HT;     CUSTOMS WORLD REVOLVES AROUND DRUGS, BUT ALSO BEANIE BABIES AND

</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ANASTASIA HENDRIX  
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Though U.S. Customs examinations are designed
primarily to catch smugglers of illicit drugs, much of what is
confiscated on a daily basis is far less dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   Most citations issued at San Francisco International Airport are
to passengers with an excess of undeclared items, such as Beanie
Babies or fake designer purses, or carrying exotic foods or
medicinal products.
</P>
<P>
   Meats, meat products and other food are heavily restricted and
regulated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   Confiscated foods are taken to a makeshift lab in a back office
of the Customs area at the airport. Dozens of green peppers were
sliced open and left in large glass jugs of water to see if pests
emerged. Flowers were placed under a warming light to check for
bugs, which could only escape through a funnel into a test tube of
alcohol, which kills them instantly.
</P>
<P>
   USDA officials collect enough fruits and vegetables every day to
fill four or five industrial-size plastic garbage cans _ enough to
leave a lingering and pungent scent in the tiny office. Medfly
larvae are found about twice a week, said John Nelson, an agency
supervisor. The garbage is taken away by a company that first
steam-sterilizes it at 212 degrees Fahrenheit for two hours.
</P>
<P>
   The most eye-catching and unusual examples of what has been
confiscated over the years can be found in a wooden curio cabinet
near the front of the agency's airport office.
</P>
<P>
   The collection includes hundreds of items, mostly meat or
meat-related. A tin of something labeled ``pork floss'' sits next
to the leathery remains of a deer penis and two shriveled,
blackened gallbladders of a small antelope, both imported for Asian
herbal medicinal purposes. A small plastic box of dried animal
blood chips was ``donated'' by a passenger who intended to use them
as an aphrodisiac.
</P>
<P>
   The most common item people get caught with: Cuban cigars.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to bring in a few,'' said Mike Freitas, a U.S.
Customs spokesman in San Francisco. ``It's just a sexy thing to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, a Barbados pet store owner was caught with
55 red-footed tortoises in his pants when he arrived at Miami
International Airport. He apparently intended to sell them for $75
each. He was charged with smuggling and violating a treaty
prohibiting transportation of endangered species, and the tortoises
were given to the U.S. Fish &AMP; Wildlife Service.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a collector caught the attention of Customs
investigators when he brought a Soviet-era Scud missile into a
Ventura County airport. Officials believed it had not been properly
demilitarized.
</P>
<P>
   Even Beanie Babies can be taken away if someone has more than
three of one kind or is bringing them from countries known to
produce counterfeits.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the garbage, everything _ from cocaine to Cohibas _
is transferred to a warehouse in downtown San Francisco and
appraised. Drugs and illegal contraband are often held as evidence
for criminal prosecution in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Items like the cigars are torn apart or destroyed in front of a
witness to ensure that no one else uses them. More mundane objects,
such as shoes and rugs, are sold at auction.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said that confiscation can be upsetting, or even
downright traumatizing, for passengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be a real negative learning experience,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The worst things to take away, Nelson said, are items with great
personal or religious significance.
</P>
<P>
   For example, many veterans who went to Europe in 1994 to
commemorate the 50th anniversary of the D-day invasion brought back
soil from the graves of war buddies or sand from Omaha Beach. Sand
is OK, but soil is not allowed because it can harbor pests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually they let us take it and give it a heat treatment, and
so we don't have to take it away,'' Nelson said. The ``heat
treatment'' is a five-minute cycle in one of the two microwaves in
the office.
</P>
<P>
   Untreated hunting trophies, such as heads of deer, boar or other
animals, must be immediately sent to a taxidermist.

&HT;     WHAT'S PAST IS PROLOGUE FOR GIANT ELKS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

   SAN FRANCISCO _ What happened to the largest recognized tule elk
in California history?
</P>
<P>
   A. After the head was mounted, it fell out of a pick-up truck
bed from a bump on Highway 101, then was run over by a semi-truck.
</P>
<P>
   B. It died of old age last year at Point Reyes National
Seashore, was then recovered and mounted, and is the new featured
exhibit at the state's wildlife museum.
</P>
<P>
   C. It was taken by a hunter three years ago at Grizzly Island
Wildlife Area, and after photographing it, the hunter then took the
meat home and is still eating elk steaks every Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   D. It was mounted and auctioned off for $17,000 at the banquet
for the Elk Foundation, with all the money going to the elk habitat
restoration program. Last summer, the head mount was stolen from
the buyer's home in Los Altos Hills.
</P>
<P>
   The answer to this question is in a yarn that starts in the
Valley of the Giants in Northern California, a place named for its
ability to produce giant elk.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring of 1985, an elk was born, the son of the largest
tule elk recognized in modern times. The parent bull was named
Stud, with antlers that were measured and scored at 392.
</P>
<P>
   When Stud died of old age in 1991 in the Valley of the Giants,
federal wildlife biologist Gary Zahm took the head and had it
mounted, then moved it to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife office in Los
Banos. It is still there on display for visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the progeny of Stud started growing. In three years,
this elk was named Son of Stud because he had the near-identical
antler configuration as his father. In 1994, however, Son of Stud
was not the master bull in the Valley of the Giants. There were two
larger elk, named Monarch and Extra Points. Monarch was 10 years
old, when elk typically have their largest antler racks, and
measured 380, while Extra Point was nearly 10 and measured 375.
</P>
<P>
   Son of Stud, now 8 years old, measured 332.
</P>
<P>
   J.J. McBride of Glen Ellen, a recognized authority on wildlife
in North America, had started tracking and photographing this elk
herd. Then in February 1995, Son of Stud, along with two others, No
Point and Unknown Elk, were relocated by the Department of Fish and
Game to Grizzly Island Wildlife Area near Fairfield in the San
Francisco Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   They were transported for one reason: To freshen up the gene
pool of the herd of 80 elk at Grizzly Island. But instead, these
three transplants turned into loners and refused to mix with the
herd.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1995, Son of Stud swam across Montezuma Slough and took
up residence as a loner on an island in the Lower Delta. A month
later, Son of Stud apparently decided to swim back _ but drowned.
His body was discovered by the Coast Guard in Honker Bay on June
10, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The elk was so big that the Coast Guard proclaimed it a
navigational hazard and after notifying Fish and Game, dispatched a
team that removed its head and sank the carcass.
</P>
<P>
   That head was then transported to the state Department of Fish
and Game regional office in Yountville. McBride was notified.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within a day, I identified it as Son of Stud,'' McBride said.
``I told them, `This is such an outstanding specimen, I'll mount it
for you.' They didn't have any money to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The first thing McBride noticed was that the antlers of Son of
Stud were still covered in velvet, which means they were still
growing. The antlers of an elk will continue to grow into July,
after which the velvet is then stripped off by the elk rubbing the
antlers against young trees and brush.
</P>
<P>
   The mount was completed by December 1995 by taxidermist Bob
White of San Martin. In the meantime, McBride scored the antlers at
403, using what is known as the Roosevelt Method.
</P>
<P>
   That made it the largest tule elk ever known, even bigger than
his father, Stud, by 11 points, even though the antlers were in
velvet and not fully grown.
</P>
<P>
   There was such an uproar over this elk that McBride took the
mount on a tour of North America at sports shows. ``I was never
paid for this and that's not a complaint,'' McBride said. ``I did
it because I love what I do.''
</P>
<P>
   After the tour, the mount was returned to the Fish and Game
regional headquarters, and there it became something of an
attraction for employees of the agency from across the state.
</P>
<P>
   Alongside Son of Stud was a full-mount standing polar bear and a
beautiful shoulder mount of a Rocky Mountain elk.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the bomb.
</P>
<P>
   To help raise money at dinners for the Rocky Mountain Elk
Foundation, the Department of Fish and Game permitted Son of Stud
to be taken to fund-raising banquets and be displayed. In March of
this year, after such a dinner in Ukiah, Son of Stud was being
driven in a pick-up truck to be returned to the Fish and Game
office in Yountville. His crate, however, was not lashed down, and
in addition, there were tremendous winds at the time, estimated at
35 to 40 mph. At one critical moment, the pick-up truck hit a big
bump right when a howling gust ripped across the highway _ and in
that instant, the crate bounced out of the truck and on to the
road.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, an 18-wheeler semi-truck plowed right through it,
and Son of Stud was broken into dozens of pieces.
</P>
<P>
   The pieces were retrieved and taken back to Yountville, and
McBride was notified.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so broken up that it was almost beyond recognition,''
McBride said. ``I was in an utter state of shock.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, after examining the remnants, he discovered the tag that
he had placed on the back of the mount. He held it in his fingers,
turned it over, and saw his signature verifying that this was Son
of Stud.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I had lost a child,'' McBride said. ``I had
video-taped him and tracked this animal for five years. We watched
him grow. We'd sneak on him. We could recognize his unique walk.''
</P>
<P>
   Son of Stud had one offspring, named Reno, who lives in the
Valley of the Giants. Reno has antlers with 12 points one side, 7
on the other, scoring at 350. In addition, Reno has had two
offspring _ now just youngsters, still unnamed that McBride and
others are tracking _ and thus this saga will never end.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Here are tips for caring for furniture and other household items
while in storage:
</P>
<P>
   For wood furniture, choose old blankets over plastic drop cloths
as a cover, because any dust that gets in between plastic and the
wood can rub off the furniture finish.
</P>
<P>
   Stacked, bulging boxes can tip over easily, and partially filled
boxes tend to collapse. To guard against this, fill boxes tightly
with bubble wrap and packing paper to fill empty spaces.
</P>
<P>
   Apply a few drops of machine oil on clean surfaces before
storing bicycles and other metal items, to retard rust.
</P>
<P>
   When packing dishes, all plates, platters and saucers should be
stored on edge. Nest cups and bowls. A layer of packing material
should be placed on the bottom of the box first and one over the
top before closing the box.
</P>
<P>
   Any closet can become more efficient if you install closet
organizers. Some are relatively inexpensive to install, such as
vinyl-coated wire styles. Be sure to measure carefully to see that
they fit. Always check with your landlord before attaching shelving
to walls.

   The New York Times News Service plans the following  &UR; Science
Times &LR;  stories for papers of Tuesday, Dec. 28:
</P>
<P>
   SCI-EGYPTOLOGY (Undated) _ The prodigious explorations of the
last two centuries, beginning with the discovery of the Rosetta
Stone, have only whetted public and professional appetites, making
Egyptology one of the most robust endeavors of archaeologists. New
discoveries have pushed back the beginnings of Egyptian history.
New interpretations of earlier findings have refined thinking about
the lives of pharaohs and their subjects, the origins and richness
of the language and the philosophy of life and death that inspired
the pyramids. Yet mysteries abound, driving further searches among
the ruins. By John Noble Wilford. (2100 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo and map.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-FERMILAB (Batavia, Ill.) _ The Fermi National Accelerator
Laboratory has for three decades played a pivotal role in the quest
to understand the ultimate nature of matter. Fermilab still houses
the most powerful particle accelerator in the world, four miles
around and capable of accelerating protons and antiprotons to
energies of a trillion volts and then smashing them together, but
the laboratory is showing signs of age. The cutting edge of
high-energy physics is moving to Europe, and Fermilab's next decade
could prove to be the laboratory's last hurrah. By Malcolm W.
Browne. (1470 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-AUTISM (Undated) _ Inspired by new findings on how animal
brains develop before and after birth, scientists are developing
provocative new theories to explain autism _ a mysterious brain
abnormality that prevents human infants from developing normal
social and cognitive skills. By Sandra Blakeslee. (1800 words)
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-RESEARCH-SPENDING (Undated) _ American industry is pouring
extraordinary sums of money into research and development in an
effort to nurture strong growth, private and federal officials are
reporting. By William J. Broad. (750 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-HUGHES-INSTITUTE (Undated) _ The Howard Hughes Medical
Institute has emerged only recently from its shadowy role as a tax
shelter to become a major player in biological research. It has
become the chief dispenser of the fortune that Howard Hughes
protected for 23 years and major universities and scientists vie
for its largesse. By Nicholas Wade. (1400 words)
</P>
<P>
   With
</P>
<P>
   SCI-HUGHES-CECH (Undated) _ Mini-profile of Dr. Thomas R. Cech,
a chemist and RNA expert, who is taking over the Hughes Medical
Institute. (800 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-OXYGEN (Undated) _ The many and varied forms of oxygen and
other elements, superhot to supercold and under extreme pressure,
provide ample areas of explorations for students and scientists. An
essay by Malcolm W. Browne. (1150 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WATCH (Undated) _ News and notes on science: Items on a
growth hormone in plants, a new kind of rocket engine and a more
efficient photography process. By Henry Fountain. (700 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-FITNESS-MODELS (Undated) _ Models for fitness and even
aerobics instructors are now coming in larger sizes, reflecting the
diversity of their classes, with men who never will have 30 inch
waists and women will never see a size 2. By Mary Duffy. (1470
words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-SURGICAL-ZIPPER (Undated) _ Some doctors now are using the
surgical zipper in lieu of stitches or staples. It has an adhesive
that attaches to the skin on each side, and then zips. One big
advantage is that it peels off in the shower. By Keith Mulvihill.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-DEMENTIA (Undated) _ The AMA has released ``Dementia: A
Practical Guide for Primary Care Physicians.'' The guide is set up
to help doctors diagnose dementia and plan treatment options for
patients with the diagnosis. It also addresses the treatment of
cognitive problems and behavioral symptoms, issues of family care
giving, safety, elder abuse, community resources and end-of-life
concerns. By Alisha Berger.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ Personal Health column: New
research suggests that the consequences of chronic sleep
deprivation may be far worse than simply diminished mental
sharpness, shortened tempers and a tendency to doze off at every
quiet moment. Rather, sleep scientists at the University of Chicago
found that those who suffer from an accumulated sleep debt may
develop serious health problems, including obesity, diabetes and
high blood pressure. By Jane E. Brody. (1250 words)
</P>
<P>
   SELLING-PREVENTION (Undated) _ In Marseille, France, some
vending machines dispense neither soda nor candy but free sterile
needles for drug users. In Vancouver, British Columbia, a stack of
colorful coupons sits next to the register at a local drugstore,
offering 10 percent off on condoms. Both programs aim to block the
spread of infectious diseases, especially AIDS, by making
preventive tools available to people who might be reluctant to seek
them out in clinics or doctors' offices. And two studies in the
December issue of The American Journal of Public Health suggest
that they are working. By Alisha Berger.
</P>
<P>
   VITAL-SIGNS (Undated) _ News and notes on health and fitness:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Food and Drug Administration has approved a medication in
the form of a nail polish for hard-to-heal fungus infections of
fingernails and toenails. (222 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ Sexual fantasies may be better than aspirin for reducing pain,
a Johns Hopkins University study inspired by The National Enquirer
has found. (333 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ A Veterans Affairs hospital in Lexington, Ky., says it has
found a way to keep its malpractice costs below those of most
similar hospitals: make full disclosure to injured patients, even
in cases when they would not otherwise have learned of the problem.
(275 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ Smoking marijuana significantly increases the risk of head and
neck cancer, according to a new study, which also predicts an
increase in cases as baby boomers age. (225 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ Experts have developed a new system for gauging head injuries.
(300 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-RACE-PAIN (Undated) _ Black patients with broken arms or
legs are less likely to be treated for pain in emergency rooms than
white patients with similar injuries and complaints of pain, a new
study has found. By Gabrielle Glaser.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ Science question answered: What bird flies
the fastest? The winner, wings down, is the peregrine falcon, Falco
peregrinus, which may also be the fastest animal of any kind on
earth. (275 words)

   SCI-EGYPTOLOGY (Undated) _ The prodigious explorations of the
last two centuries, beginning with the discovery of the Rosetta
Stone, have only whetted public and professional appetites, making
Egyptology one of the most robust endeavors of archaeologists. New
discoveries have pushed back the beginnings of Egyptian history.
New interpretations of earlier findings have refined thinking about
the lives of pharaohs and their subjects, the origins and richness
of the language and the philosophy of life and death that inspired
the pyramids. Yet mysteries abound, driving further searches among
the ruins. By John Noble Wilford. (2100 words)

   SCI-FERMILAB (Batavia, Ill.) _ The Fermi National Accelerator
Laboratory has for three decades played a pivotal role in the quest
to understand the ultimate nature of matter. Fermilab still houses
the most powerful particle accelerator in the world, four miles
around and capable of accelerating protons and antiprotons to
energies of a trillion volts and then smashing them together, but
the laboratory is showing signs of age. The cutting edge of
high-energy physics is moving to Europe, and Fermilab's next decade
could prove to be the laboratory's last hurrah. By Malcolm W.
Browne. (1470 words)

   SCI-HUGHES-INSTITUTE (Undated) _ The Howard Hughes Medical

   SCI-SURGICAL-ZIPPER (Undated) _ Some doctors now are using the
surgical zipper in lieu of stitches or staples. It has an adhesive
that attaches to the skin on each side, and then zips. One big
advantage is that it peels off in the shower. By Keith Mulvihill.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-DEMENTIA (Undated) _ The AMA has released ``Dementia: A
Practical Guide for Primary Care Physicians.'' The guide is set up
to help doctors diagnose dementia and plan treatment options for
patients with the diagnosis. It also addresses the treatment of
cognitive problems and behavioral symptoms, issues of family care
giving, safety, elder abuse, community resources and end-of-life
concerns. By Alisha Berger.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ Personal Health column: New
research suggests that the consequences of chronic sleep
deprivation may be far worse than simply diminished mental
sharpness, shortened tempers and a tendency to doze off at every
quiet moment. Rather, sleep scientists at the University of Chicago
found that those who suffer from an accumulated sleep debt may
develop serious health problems, including obesity, diabetes and
high blood pressure. By Jane E. Brody. (1250 words)
</P>
<P>
   SELLING-PREVENTION (Undated) _ In Marseille, France, some
vending machines dispense neither soda nor candy but free sterile
needles for drug users. In Vancouver, British Columbia, a stack of
colorful coupons sits next to the register at a local drugstore,
offering 10 percent off on condoms. Both programs aim to block the
spread of infectious diseases, especially AIDS, by making
preventive tools available to people who might be reluctant to seek
them out in clinics or doctors' offices. And two studies in the
December issue of The American Journal of Public Health suggest
that they are working. By Alisha Berger.

THE POOR FAVOR SCHOOL CHOICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To anyone with eyes to see and ears to hear, parents across
America _ especially those in urban neighborhoods with wretched
public schools _ are wild for school choice. In Milwaukee, where
vouchers are making it possible for 8,000 poor students to attend
private or parochial school, 62 percent of city residents support
the program, according to a poll commissioned by the Milwaukee
Journal Sentinel. Among black Milwaukeans, the level of support is
74 percent; among Hispanics, 77 percent. And among Milwaukee
residents with very low incomes, a whopping 81 percent favor
vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee is no fluke. A national poll last year by a leading
black think tank, the Joint Center for Political and Economic
Studies, showed that substantial majorities of blacks in the
Northeast (69 percent) and Midwest (65 percent) support vouchers.
Broken down by age, support was especially pronounced among blacks
most likely to have school-age children: Nearly 59 percent of those
between ages 26 and 50 think vouchers should be widely available.
</P>
<P>
   Parents in Washington, D.C., are ``rampaging toward choice,''
writes Michael Lynch in the January issue of Reason magazine.
Choice in the District of Columbia means privately funded vouchers
from the Washington Scholarship Fund, which gives more than 1,300
students subsidies of up to $1,700 to help pay for private school
tuition. Frequently, as Lynch's sensitive article shows, recipients
of these vouchers willingly endure privation in order to scrape
together the balance needed to cover tuition and expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many such parents,'' he writes, ``are . . . black women
raising kids or grandkids on their own.'' Rose Blassingame, for
example, who is raising four grandchildren in a two-bedroom
apartment, struggles to pay for tuition, books, and school uniforms
at the Catholic schools the kids are attending. ``Covering these
costs means giving up the monthly meal out, a summer amusement park
trip, and visits to the beauty parlor. . . . For Franciscoe'' _ one
of her grandchildren _ ``. . . it meant spending all but $31 of the
$347 he earned at his summer job on the gray slacks, white shirts,
and green blazer that constitute his uniform.''
</P>
<P>
   There are millions of Rose Blassingames out there, and no one
knows it better than businessmen Ted Forstmann and John Walton, two
donors to the Washington Scholarship Fund who last year decided to
take the idea nationwide. They raised $170 million _ $100 million
from their own pockets _ to create the Children's Scholarship Fund,
and invited low-income families to apply for 40,000 scholarships
that would defray part of the cost of private school tuition.
Winners would be required to supplement the scholarship with (on
average) $1,000 a year of their own money.
</P>
<P>
   To their astonishment, nearly 1.25 million applications came
flooding in, representing almost 1 out of every 50 schoolchildren
in America. ``These were not parents seeking a free ride,''
Forstmann marvels. ``Though their average income was less than
$22,000 a year, they were willing, asking, to make significant
financial sacrifices to take advantage of our partial . . .
scholarships. Think of it: 1.25 million applicants asking to pay
$1,000 a year over four years. That's $5 billion that poor families
were willing to spend simply to escape the schools where their
children have been relegated.''
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to Al Gore and Bill Bradley, two Democrats who
daily profess their devotion to the poor and trumpet their keen
empathy for black Americans. During their recent debate on ``Meet
the Press,'' the two candidates were asked by Tim Russert whether,
if elected, they would support vouchers. Do you suppose they jumped
at the chance to back up Rose Blassingame and the armies of
inner-city parents who are desperate to get their kids out of
dangerous and incompetent government schools?
</P>
<P>
   If so, you suppose wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Q: ``As president, would you support . . . vouchers?''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley: ``The answer is, Tim _ no, and I will tell you why. I
have supported vouchers on an experimental basis on a number of
occasions over 18 years. I do not believe that vouchers are the
answer to the problems of public education.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore: ``The reason I oppose vouchers, Tim, is because . . . if
you drain the money away from the public schools for private
vouchers, then that hurts the public schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Russert tried again. ``Why don't those poor minority moms with
their kids, who could not possibly deal with the chaos of public
schools, deserve a break?''
</P>
<P>
   He tried again. ``They have decided the public schools don't
work. . . . Why not give them a couple hundred bucks to offset the
burden of tuition?''
</P>
<P>
   But Gore and Bradley can't answer the question. They have tucked
themselves so deeply into the hip pocket of the politically
powerful teachers unions _ which, like all monopolists, want to
strangle competition _ that the cries of beleaguered parents with
kids in lousy schools have become inaudible to them.
</P>
<P>
   Their callousness is disgraceful. Neither would allow his own
children to rot in a dysfunctional public school, yet they scorn a
reform that would empower poor parents to rescue their children.
What would happen to public education, they wail, if kids are
allowed to opt out? It never occurs to them to wonder what will
happen to the kids if they aren't.

COINERS COME AND GO, BUT COINAGES LIVE ON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Jan. 2)  
(Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics.) 
(lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What do you call somebody who continually applies his nose to
the grindstone, eschews the distractions of fun and games and
otherwise occupies himself with those moneymaking endeavors that
make Jack a dull boy?
</P>
<P>
   A  &UR; workaholic &LR; , of course. But what did we call that addiction
to work _ that obsessive attachment to long hours and briefcases
voluntarily stuffed with homework _ before Wayne E. Oates, in a
burst of linguistic innovation in 1968, titled an article in a
pastoral magazine, ``On Being a `Workaholic'''?
</P>
<P>
   We had no word for it. The language suffered from a gaping hole.
The French had  &UR; bourreau de travail &LR; , ``work butcher,'' but not
until this Southern Baptist pastor from Louisville, Ky., came up
with his coinage could English speakers succinctly express
themselves. ``I have dubbed this addiction of myself and my fellow
ministers as  &UR; workaholism &LR; ,'' Oates wrote, and later defined his
term as ``the compulsion or the uncontrollable need to work
incessantly.''
</P>
<P>
   He based it, obviously, on  &UR; alcoholic &LR; . In so doing, the coiner
made a new suffix out of  &UR; -oholic &LR; . But the question of spelling
arises: If the suffix is adopted from  &UR; alcoholic &LR; , why did Oates
not spell his word  &UR; workoholic &LR; ? That was the spelling of a
parallel formulation adopted the same year to describe those
bittersweet-toothed souls who cannot do without a chocolate fix:
 &UR; chocoholic &LR; . But  &UR; choco &LR;  lent itself to the  &UR; -oholic &LR; ; why did
Oates prefer the ``a''?
</P>
<P>
   I cannot ask him, because Wayne Oates was one of those who died
in the past year, remembered in history not so much for his 57
books and hundreds of published articles, but for his undisputed
coinage of a necessary word. That's the way it goes in the word
dodge; if you coin a good one, it becomes the lead of your obituary
no matter what else you did.
</P>
<P>
   Same for Herbert Freudenberger, the eminent psychologist who
died last month in New York. Was he noted for his work with people
who lost self-esteem, became bored, discouraged and sloppy? Or for
his free clinics for drug addicts, or for his court-ordered
analysis of the murderous Charles Manson? No. The headline in The
New York Times read ``Herbert Freudenberger, 73, Coiner of
`Burnout,' Is Dead.''
</P>
<P>
   He first used the word as the title of a 1974 book, subtitled
``The High Cost of High Achievement,'' which he wrote with
Geraldine Richelson, defining  &UR; burnout &LR;  as ``the extinction of
motivation or incentive, especially where one's devotion to a cause
or relationship fails to produce the desired results.'' In his
native Germany, from which he fled in 1938, the term is
 &UR; ausgebrannt &LR; , literally  &UR; burned out &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Burnout &LR;  had been a 1940s term for ``the sudden loss of power
in a jet or rocket engine.'' By the '50s, it had been largely
replaced by  &UR; flameout &LR; , giving Freudenberger a chance to give it a
new life with his psychological sense. Though he did not coin the
word itself, as Oates did with  &UR; workaholic &LR; , he gave  &UR; burnout &LR;  the
sense by which it is known today.
</P>
<P>
   Another man known to the word trade died in 1999. (We don't use
euphemisms like ``passed away'' or ``departed this vale of tears'';
when you die in this business, you die.) He never tried to pass
himself off as a serious linguist or lexicographer, but his
wordplay delighted his readers, stimulated interest in the world of
words and sometimes instructed us with a light-verse touch.
</P>
<P>
   The advertising and promotion man Willard Espy is best known for
his almanacs of ``Words at Play,'' compiled and reissued by
Merriam-Webster six months ago. Having fun with words can involve
creative rhymes (``I do not roister with an oyster'') and nonce
coinages (``my family was a  &UR; scribacious &LR;  lot''). As players of
Scrabble and workers of crossword puzzles know, games are a good
way to discover the glories of lexicography.
</P>
<P>
   AGAINST  &UR; MILLENARIAN &LR;
</P>
<P>
   What shall we call a person who has lived in the Second
Millennium?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``Duomillenarian &LR;  has wrong connotations,'' replies Frederic G.
Cassidy, chief editor of the Dictionary of American Regional
English, and ``Greek is better in any case as more classical.'' So
with DARE's classicist, George Goebel, the great lexicographer
turned from Latin to Greek:  &UR; Deutero &LR;  means ``second'' and
 &UR; chiliast &LR;  refers to the biblical ``kingdom of a thousand years.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus,  &UR; deuterochiliast &LR; , ``a person of, or anything
characteristic of, the second millennium.'' Drop this coinage in a
conversation; see if it clanks.
</P>

&HT;     BUBBLY MAY COST MORE, BUT IS STILL AVAILABLE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By BILL CITARA  
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ If you haven't already picked up a bottle of
your favorite bubbly to celebrate the new year, don't be surprised
if you have to do some searching, pull a few more dollars out of
your wallet, settle for your second choice. Or drink beer.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is still plenty available for New Year's Eve
party-goers, many major Champagne and sparkling wine producers are
sold out of one or all of their lines. Many retailers are, too, or
down to their last few cases. To feed the demand for the fizzy
stuff, they are being forced to rely on the wines of lesser-known
houses or pay higher prices for ``name brands'' on the European
``gray market.''
</P>
<P>
   Supplies of some traditionally popular Champagnes, such as Veuve
Clicquot ``Yellow Label'' and Taittinger Brut non-vintage, already
are exhausted at the wineries, according to Harry Bird, the manager
of Beltramo's Wines &AMP; Spirits in Menlo Park, with the only bottles
left being those sitting on retailers' shelves. The same situation
exists with many upscale Champagnes from the well-regarded 1990
vintage, he notes, and what '90s can be found may cost
substantially more than consumers are used to paying.
</P>
<P>
   And it is not just French Champagnes that are out of stock at
the winery level. Such large-volume California producers as Korbel
and Gloria Ferrer haven't a drop of sparkling wine left to release
this year, though Korbel spokeswoman Margie Healy said that spot
checks by the company's sales force indicate plenty of product
remains for sale in stores.
</P>
<P>
   Korbel's 1999 sales are up 30 percent over last year, Healy
said, which translates to 1.6 million cases of 11 varieties of
sparkling wine sold. Sonoma's Gloria Ferrer, the American arm of
mammoth Spanish producer Freixenet, has sold out its annual
production of 80,000 cases, leaving only enough bubbly to pour in
the winery's spacious, airy tasting room.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been pretty crazy,'' said Eva Bertran, the executive vice
president of Gloria Ferrer. ``We've been getting calls every day
from retailers, salespeople and distributors'' trying to purchase
more sparkling wine. ``But it's all gone.''
</P>
<P>
   As crazy as it has been at Gloria Ferrer, '99 has been even
crazier at Freixenet, she noted. The company's enormous Spanish
winemaking facility has been operating 24 hours per day since
April, producing 9 million cases of its popular ``cava'' (sparkling
wine) for world markets. U.S. sales are up 40 percent over last
year, according to Bertran. In California, Freixenet's No. 1
American market, sales are up a stunning 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Sales also are up at Domaine Chandon and Domaine Carneros in the
Napa Valley. Domaine Chandon is bereft of its Cuvee 2000 reserve
wine, but is well-stocked with its best-selling Blanc de Noir and
Brut sparklers. At Domaine Carneros, winemaker and managing
director Eileen Crane said the Taittinger-owned California winery
shipped the last of its 28,000-case production of Brut and La Rave
sparkling wines in October and is down to a relative handful of
cases for the tasting room and large (magnum, three-liter and
six-liter) bottles of its special 1994 millennium cuvee.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone who didn't heed the warning about shortages of bubbly
this year, Beltramo's wine buyer, Howard Padgett, has a few
alternative bubblies up his sleeve. Anticipating sellouts of the
best-known Champagnes, earlier this year he brought in French
sparkling wines (not from the Champagne region) from small, obscure
houses.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, to those for whom price is no object, even some of
the most difficult to acquire Champagnes can be bought for a price.
Five months ago, Beltramo's plunged into the European ``gray
market'' of Champagnes, purchasing lots from buyers in countries
such as Britain and Belgium, who had stocked up on high-end French
bubbly in anticipation of just such last-minute foreign demand.
</P>
<P>
   The higher cost of these wines means that a 1990 Dom Perignon
with a suggested retail price of $125 will sell for about $150,
while the price of a bottle of 1990 Roederer Cristal will fetch
almost $100 more than its typical price of $160.
</P>
<P>
   Prices of other brands also have risen, according to Ed Guelld,
manager of PlumpJack Wines in San Francisco. Suppliers started
boosting prices incrementally months ago, he said, by as much as 10
percent.

GETTING INK OFF A STONE HEARTH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for Ocala; moved 12/9/99)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My son has written in permanent black Magic Marker on my
raised stone hearth. The marks are on the hearth itself as well as
on the edge. I tried Soft Scrub and water, without success. What
will take it off?
</P>
<P>
   DAN SHAPIRO, Needham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. There are several things you can try. Lava soap is quite
harsh but might work; so might mechanic's gel hand soap. Solvents
to try are rubbing alcohol, acetone, dry-cleaning fluid, and
bleach. None of these will harm the stone or brick, but if you try
household bleach, try it in an obscure area to make sure it does
not bleach out the stone or brick. Wear skin and eye protection
when working with bleach.
</P>
<P>
   And, just for kicks, muriatic acid might work, if there is any
lime in the stone or brick. Muriatic acid attacks only lime, and if
the marker is on top of lime, then the acid will go through it and
attack the lime. Wear skin and eye protection when working with
acid. Mix the acid half and half with water, and always pour the
acid into the water.
</P>
<P>
   If hope turns to despair, and nothing works, try sanding off the
black with fine sandpaper.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is the efficacy of central air conditioning in a hot-air
heating system, using the hot-air ducts for the cool air in summer?
And, the efficacy of gutter guards?
</P>
<P>
   CURIOUS, who wants to be cool next summer
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't know of any scientific studies, but I do know that
some a/c systems use the hot-air ducts for cooling, at a
respectable efficiency rate.
</P>
<P>
   Technicians may argue that a/c ducts should be near the ceiling
to be most effective, because cool air falls; ducts near the floor
would produce less cool air because of this factor, the argument
goes.
</P>
<P>
   That is true, but to a slight extent. It is not a matter of how
much air, which is forced under pressure, but how well it is
distributed in each room.
</P>
<P>
   And, anecdotally, the handyman had this done just this autumn:
central air using hot-air ducts for distribution. He will let you
know how well it works some day next summer.
</P>
<P>
   As for the gutter guards, there are so many kinds out there that
I am not convinced that they all work 100 percent in keeping
leaves, and especially evergreen needles, out of the gutter. The
guards that have slots instead of perforations may work better.
And, of course, if you do not have evergreens nearby, any guard
will work in keeping out deciduous leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Does polyurethane varnish have a shelf life, and if so, how
long is it? Or does it just get stale? I used some that was in the
can for four or five years and sealed the outside of a cedar chest
with it. It still smells quite strong and is a bit soft in spots.
</P>
<P>
   SHELDON HOCHMAN, Shrewsbury, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. As long as paint, stain, or varnish is in a liquid form, and
the scum coat over it is intact, the finish can be used. Sometimes
the formula is a little different because of that scum, but I don't
think that is very important.
</P>
<P>
   It may take a while for the varnish to dry and cure completely,
but it will, if you give it enough ventilation each day. Open
windows and put a fan on the floor to hasten the curing.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know if it is a perverse streak in New Englanders, but
we tend to throw away heavy dry goods that have years of life left
in them, but save a quarter-gallon of old, old, old varnish that is
probably worth $4.
</P>
<P>
   Q. My garage door opened by itself one day at 6 a.m. I changed
the code, but, again, it opened twice by itself. A garage door
company changed the manual switch in the garage, and it's been OK
for two weeks. But when we leave the house, we cannot depend on it.
What can we do?
</P>
<P>
   J.J., Arlington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. You can trust the company and what it did, or have the
company change all switches, maybe even the motor. It would not be
that expensive but is worth it for your peace of mind and safety.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I'd like to put insulation on my the attic floor. What about
covering light fixtures that stick up through the ceiling?
</P>
<P>
   JOHN ROUGEAU, North Attleborough, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. It is OK to cover a fixture if most of it is below the
ceiling. If the entire fixture is sticking through the ceiling, and
the bottom is flush with the ceiling, it cannot be covered with
insulation if it is not labeled ``no clearance,'' ``ventilated,''
or ``insulated.'' If the fixtures are not labeled as such, you must
leave 2 inches of space between insulation and fixture, and cannot
cover it, because if covered by insulation the fixture can generate
enough heat to cause a fire.
</P>
<P>
   To correct this (such fixtures do lose a lot of heat), replace
the old fixtures with insulated ones.

&HT;     CUSTOMS SERVICE TRIES TO BOOST ITS PROFILE, REDUCE COMPLAINTS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ANASTASIA HENDRICKS  
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The U.S. Customs Service is using more
traveler-friendly policies to soften its reputation for conducting
overzealous and intrusive searches or targeting a disproportionate
number of women and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were being assaulted in the courts and in the media and in
Congress,'' said Dennis Murphy, a Customs spokesman at the agency's
headquarters in Washington, D.C. ``In discussions with many members
of Congress it was clear that there was a growing mood that if we
didn't do something about ourselves, they would do it for us.''
</P>
<P>
   These changes, which took effect Oct. 1, are long overdue in the
eyes of Customs' critics. Ana Obando of Daly City, Calif., is one
of them.
</P>
<P>
   When Obando, a 51-year-old bank manager and a native of El
Salvador, returned to San Francisco last year after a weeklong stay
at her condominium in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, she expected a quick
reunion with her daughter, who was waiting to take her home.
</P>
<P>
   What she got was a two-hour delay, a prolonged examination of
her suitcase, a search of her most private areas and no explanation
of why.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was humiliating and embarrassing,'' Obando said. ``You are
angry because you want them to stop, but at the same time you're
thinking that if you don't cooperate, you're going to be detained
even longer.''
</P>
<P>
   She said they also searched her boyfriend, a San Mateo County
bus driver, making him remove his shoes, spread his legs and put
his hands on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know drugs are a serious problem ... and I'm glad they are
doing something to try and stop it,'' she said. ``But they could at
least say `I'm sorry' after you are found innocent and explain that
they are just doing their job.''
</P>
<P>
   Other recent news accounts have detailed even more horrific
encounters:
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1998, a woman was forced to remove her tampon and sanitary
pad for an agent at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago to
prove she was not hiding drugs in her body. She is one of 100
African-American women involved in a class-action lawsuit against
the agency.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1997 a woman, seven months pregnant, said she was taken to
a hospital near the Fort Lauderdale airport after returning from
Jamaica. An agent asked a few questions, she said, then handcuffed
her and took her to the hospital, where she was given a laxative so
agents could examine her bowel movements.
</P>
<P>
   She said she was kept there for three days, unable to contact
her family. Her baby was born prematurely 12 days later, and
weighed 3 pounds. She too, has filed a suit.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1994, a 51-year-old widow returning to San Francisco from a
round-the-world trip was also X-rayed, given a powerful laxative
and detained more than 25 hours before Customs officials determined
she was not smuggling drugs. She won a $451,000 judgment against
the agency.
</P>
<P>
   _ A Boston nurse won a similar suit in 1991 when a judge found
that agents had insufficient evidence to suspect she was carrying
contraband before subjecting her to X-rays and a pelvic exam. She
received $215,000.
</P>
<P>
   None of the women mentioned above had illegal property. All are
women are either black or Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   The suits, many of which charge that the searches were race- or
gender-based, led to a congressional hearing during the summer
focused on passenger treatment at some U.S. airports.
</P>
<P>
   Congress requested a formal investigation by the General
Accounting Office, which is still under way, and Rep. John Lewis,
D-Ga., began drafting legislation to give travelers more
protections.
</P>
<P>
   Customs Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, a former New York City
police commissioner, has insisted that racial minorities are not
singled out. He also created an independent five-member panel to
evaluate racial profiling charges and other allegations of
overzealous behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Customs agent Mike Freitas, based in San Francisco, admitted
that some officers ``thought that enforcement meant we had to be a
little overbearing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to break those habits,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules limit the broad authorization agents held to
conduct personal searches, and represent what Kelly described as
``self-imposed restraint.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, a supervisor must approve all pat-down or strip
searches. If someone is delayed more than two hours, agents must
offer to notify by telephone a person the passenger chooses to
contact.
</P>
<P>
   Agents must have ``reasonable suspicion'' to delay passengers
more than four hours and a U.S. attorney must approve detentions of
more than eight hours.
</P>
<P>
   Every Customs agent has attended mandatory cultural diversity
training sessions and a revised 60-page personal search handbook.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers stopped for a ``random'' search are handed blue
sheets of paper explaining ``Why You Were Stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   Easy-to-read signs explaining the agency's purpose and practices
now sit on top of each luggage carousel. Soon monitors will be
installed with the same information in several languages.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A national survey of more than 800 travelers and Customs agents
at six major airports, commissioned by Customs in February, found
that more than one out of seven people whose bags had been examined
had little or no clue that they might be subjected to such a
search.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest surprise for many: Agents have absolute
authority to search anyone and anything they want.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers frequently argue that the Fourth Amendment protects
them from ``unreasonable searches and seizures'' without probable
cause.
</P>
<P>
   Though many are familiar with the phrasing, few are aware the
amendment does not apply when crossing the country's borders, said
Freitas, who is also a Customs passenger services representative in
charge of answering dozens of complaints filed formally _ or, more
often, verbally _ against the agency every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any country would fall apart if they can't stop things at the
border,'' he said.

&HT;     SEPARATING FACTS FROM THE FUTURE

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The future isn't what it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s and 1960s, the most upbeat visionaries imagined
2000 as a chrome-plated Tomorrowland with flying cars, lunar cities
and cancer cures.
</P>
<P>
   The most downbeat predicted nuclear wars, gasoline lines a mile
long, and widespread starvation.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, the flying cars never arrived. Instead, we have
Internet marketing, cell phones and hidden video cameras for
monitoring baby-sitters.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviet missiles never arrived, either. Nor did many other
expected disasters: On the brink of the millennium, democracy is
emerging around the world, nuclear arsenals are shrinking, world
nutrition levels are up, and petroleum prices are so low that Texas
oil kings are sinking their capital into fledgling Internet
companies instead of into the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the nation's generally upbeat mood, a new wave of
technological utopianism is sweeping the nation, a wave akin to the
``flying car''-style forecasts that titillated teen-age readers of
Popular Mechanics in the post-World War II era.
</P>
<P>
   Which makes some older, scholarly futurists grimace.
</P>
<P>
   Now in their 60s and 70s, they see many of today's visionaries
making the same mistakes that futurists made a generation ago, such
as assuming that today's technological trends will continue to grow
and fuel the economy without disappointments, detours or downturns.
</P>
<P>
   The futurist movement itself, never highly unified has further
fragmented in the post-Cold War era as different visionaries have
struck out in their own new, highly idiosyncratic directions.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance at futurist congresses has plunged compared with the
peaks in the 1980s. Futurist attempts to establish a foothold in
academia largely have failed.
</P>
<P>
   Three decades after the heyday of celebrated intellectual
futurists such as Daniel Bell, Herman Kahn and Buckminster Fuller,
``there isn't a widely visible person known as a futurist who is
respected by a substantial portion of the population,'' said Mike
Marien, a veteran futurist.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were on a roll back then, in the 1970s. (We) felt (we) were
part of something,'' said Marien, the editor of Future Survey,
which is published by the best-known futurist group, the World
Future Society of Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   But their sense of importance was shaken by repeated failures in
forecasting technological and social trends, ranging from the
emergence of the Internet to the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Enthralled by the possibility of fabulous new technologies, few
futurists expected the trends that have really shaken society: the
rapid entry of women into the work force, the worldwide revival of
nationalism and religious fundamentalism, the return of mass
epidemics such as the acquired immune deficiency syndrome, and the
emergence of the environmentalist and gay and lesbian movements.
</P>
<P>
   Futurists have not always been wrong. But rare indeed is the
long-term forecast that accurate _ for example, the forecast by
United Nations demographers, around 1960, that the world population
would exceed 6 billion by 2000. That is almost exactly the present
world population.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of futurists who confuse their hopes with
reality,'' acknowledges a veteran futurist scholar, Don Michael of
San Francisco. The futurist movement has suffered from ``a failure
of leadership, a failure to get it together. (There's been) a far
too passive sense of sitting back and hoping something would
happen, instead of making it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Another big change in the futurist movement has been the shift
in what Michael calls the ``locus of utopia.'' A few decades ago
futurists tended to assume that whatever happened in the future,
governments would be substantially responsible for it.
</P>
<P>
   But now, when public confidence in government has fallen, Marien
sees a shift toward ``the privatization of utopia,'' toward
visionary thinking in corporations, for example. This is reflected
by business literature that emphasizes the corporate potential of
new technologies and managerial styles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dream of the 20th century was the construction of mass
utopia. As the century closes, this dream is being left behind,''
Susan Buck-Morss, a government professor at Cornell University,
writes in her book, ``Dreamworld and Catastrophe,'' to be published
in the spring by MIT Press. ``The larger social vision has given
way to private dreams of material happiness and to political
cynicism.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nineteenth-century visionaries such as Karl Marx looked forward
to the transformation of an entire society and the redistribution
of its wealth and power along egalitarian lines. Now, futurist
literature increasingly has a self-centered feel to it.
</P>
<P>
   Consider these projections from a new World Future Society
publication, ``The Opportunity Century _ 50 Paths to Success in the
21st Century'':
</P>
<P>
   _ ``In the future, biochip brain implants could increase
people's memory and information processing power, turning average
humans into geniuses.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Though medically and ethically questionable,
performance-enhancing synthetic hormones could give ordinary people
nearly superhuman powers.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Some researchers believe that the human brain works like a
computer, so we could eventually replace our brains and bodies with
computer chips and artificial parts that never wear out or could be
replaced indefinitely. Another alternative would be to simply
upload your entire brain into a computer and live forever as bits
of data in a custom-made, hardware body.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael said it is not surprising that the future proved so
difficult to foresee. ``There isn't even consensus on what the past
was,'' he said. ``We can't agree on the causes of the Great
Depression or on what happened in Vietnam.''

TIME TO BYTE THE BULLET: TEXAS STAFFERS STANDING READY FOR ANY Y2K
GLITCHES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Prison cells will stay locked.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic lights will change on cue.
</P>
<P>
   Computers will continue to calculate child support payments.
</P>
<P>
   Air pollution detectors will keep right on sniffing.
</P>
<P>
   And, most importantly to some, lotto numbers will be drawn on
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the confident predictions of state government
officials who contend they have inoculated Texas public services
from the Y2K bug. Enough safeguards are in place and enough
doomsday tests have been conducted to assure a smooth arrival for
the New Year, when some outmoded computers might confuse 2000 with
1900 and malfunction, officials promise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state's experts are increasingly confident that Texans
face few or no concerns about computer related glitches,'' said
state Coordinator of Emergency Management Tom Millwee.
</P>
<P>
   But just in case things go haywire while Texans are celebrating,
Millwee and hundreds of other state employees will be on duty _ and
thousands more will be on call New Year's Eve and New Year's Day _
to carry out contingency plans patterned after hurricane response
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of highway troopers, game wardens, liquor control agents
and other public safety officials will be on routine assignment
throughout the New Year's weekend. All have been assured that their
computers, communications gear, radar guns and other
high-technology gadgets will be working.
</P>
<P>
   It's the other guys _ utilities, mainly _ who are worried about
readiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have power, the signals will work,'' said Texas
Department of Transportation deputy director Carol Rawson.
</P>
<P>
   Her agency will be among dozens represented at the Texas
Department of Public Safety emergency command center in north
Austin, where state agencies ranging from the Public Utility
Commission to the Texas Department of Banking will be ready to
field reports of problems and coordinate their responses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like we're watching a hurricane out in the Gulf and we
don't know where it's going to make landfall in Texas. You bring in
all your key players to watch so that we can coordinate with the
local jurisdictions,'' said DPS emergency management spokesman Jo
Schweikhard Moss.
</P>
<P>
   If the services of the Texas National Guard are needed, either
to deal with a Y2K-generated calamity, excessive celebration or
even terrorism, Gov. George W. Bush will be available to deploy
them. Bush will be celebrating with his family at an undisclosed
location in Texas, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   State officials, who have spent up to four years planning for
``The Big Midnight'' and its potentially disruptive aftermath are
confident Bush, like most Texans, won't be inconvenienced come New
Year's Day. State government functions will continue without
interruption and offices will reopen on schedule Jan. 3, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from minor problems and glitches, ``I don't anticipate any
kind of inconvenience to the public,'' said Department of
Information Resources director Carolyn Purcell, who oversees the
state's computer operations.
</P>
<P>
   While the Y2K bug is not a major concern, the public's embrace
of this once-in-a-lifetime New Year's is. State law enforcement
officers and others will be out in force to make sure there is no
mayhem of any kind.
</P>
<P>
   Around the state, some workers on Y2K duty begin round-the-clock
shifts Tuesday. Others will report for duty on New Year's Eve or
New Year's Day. Rules against consumption of alcohol and drugs at
state offices will be enforced as usual, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   None of the state's 200 alcohol control agents will have New
Year's Eve off.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of our agents will be on assignment, as they normally are,
during these holiday hours,'' said Texas Alcoholic Beverage
Commission director Doyne Bailey, whose staff is spread thin trying
to regulate the state's 40,000 licensed drinking establishments.
That's why his agency has conducted numerous preparedness drills on
its computerized systems, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, which keeps about
140,000 criminals behind bars, the readiness checks have been
demanding and successful, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we're such a crucial agency, the Department of
Information Resources has just crawled all over us,'' said prison
spokesman Glen Castlebury. ``They're convinced we're going to work,
but prudence demands that you don't leave public safety to
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Technology that keeps prison cells locked and perimeters
monitored has passed the tests, Castlebury said, adding that the
concerns about Y2K have dovetailed for several years with a
long-term project to modernize older prison units. Even if there
were a security systems failure, the system is designed to lock
doors and gates, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of our embedded chips were on nonessential functions, like
microwaves and coffee machines in the employee break areas,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, ``all of our data services people are going to be on
duty or on standby,'' the prison spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The same is true at the office of Attorney General John Cornyn,
where about 50 workers will be on duty throughout the weekend to
monitor mammoth computers that track 1.2 million child support
cases, 250,000 of which involve payment orders.
</P>
<P>
   Diana Williamson, deputy director for information technology in
the child support division, said ``we have tested and tested and
tested. ... Monday morning (Jan. 3) we expect to be right where we
would have been if it hadn't been Y2K weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, a back-up plan is in place if the mainframe locks up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would allow us to take payments, process those payments and
cut checks,'' she said. ``I'm not the least bit concerned about
losing people's cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if computers don't crash at the stroke of midnight,
Williamson said her crew won't be giving an ``all clear'' sign
until late Sunday, after field offices around the state log on and
test the agency's computer network.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to actually do some normal business on Sunday to
make sure it looks clean,'' Williamson said.
</P>
<P>
   At DPS, law enforcement officials are concerned about others'
computers more than their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we're ready,'' said DPS Col. Dudley Thomas. ``We're
not worried about it from an agency standpoint. We're worried about
those folks who might not be compliant,'' particularly utilities
and transportation providers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The potential is there that those things are not ready because
they've got some embedded systems in them,'' Thomas said. ``There's
no way, really, to test those. That's one of the scary things we
face.''

URBAN SPRAWL IN TEXAS FASTEST IN THE COUNTRY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ People on the fringes of Austin, Houston and
Dallas don't need a national study to tell them what's happening
over their back fences: Suburban homes, apartments and businesses
are sprouting on what used to be farms and ranches faster than
anywhere else in the country, the government reported.
</P>
<P>
   But state officials said the conversion of Texas cropland into
neighborhoods poses no threat to the food supply and does not
signal the demise of farming, even in an era of persistent drought
and record low grain prices.
</P>
<P>
   On the contrary, the demand for land on the fringes of cities
presents rural property owners with financial opportunities that
are sometimes more lucrative than food production, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's forced them off of their land is that someone has
offered them more money than they're willing to turn down,'' said
Charles E. Gilliland, research economist at the Real Estate Center
at Texas A&AMP;M University.
</P>
<P>
   Gilliland, an expert on rural land sales, said there's no doubt
lots of soil in Texas is being sold for nonagricultural use, but
the reported shift hasn't harmed farm production.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're losing a lot of prime agricultural land, it's sure
not having much effect on our agricultural output,'' Gilliland
said. ``A lot of what's disappearing into the developments is not
prime farmlands. It's marginal farmlands.''
</P>
<P>
   About 243,900 acres of Texas farmland, forests and other open
spaces are being built on each year, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture estimated. The agency's National Resource Inventory
said that between 1982 and 1992 the rate of conversion from rural
to urban uses was 139,000 acres a year, but between 1992 and 1997
the rate skyrocketed to 239,000 acres a year.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide about 16 million acres of farmland &UR; ,  &LR; woods and open
fields &UR;  &LR; were built on between 1992 and 1997 at a clip of 3.2
million acres per year _ twice the rate of building between 1982
and 1992, the USDA estimated. Its survey was based on data captured
from 800,000 statistically selected locations.
</P>
<P>
   State officials said they don't compile similar data and view
the USDA report as an extrapolated estimate rather than an
accounting of actual land transactions. And what data there is _
acreage qualifying for an agriculture or timber exemption _
suggests no major loss of farmland. The Texas Comptroller's Office
said that in 1997, there were 143 million acres of exempted land
and in 1998, the amount grew to 144 million acres.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the USDA report rekindled debate over ``urban sprawl.''
Vice President Al Gore said slowing urban encroachment on farmland
is a tenet of his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``These new figures confirm what our communities across America
already know. Too much of our precious open space is being gobbled
up by sprawl,'' Gore said. ``Every time a farmer is squeezed off
the land, a valuable way of life is eroded.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, the majority of Texas remains undeveloped. Texas spans
171 million acres. Of that, 9 million was developed by 1997, up
from 6.3 million in 1982, the USDA said.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for land around cities vary across the state. In the San
Antonio area, the median selling price for ``high quality, urban
fringe'' land was $13,000 per acre, according to a spring 1999
survey by A&AMP;M's real estate researchers. Near Dallas, the same
grade of land cost $3,250 per acre and around Houston, the median
price was $3,750 per acre.
</P>
<P>
   The highest selling prices for land were recorded in far South
Texas, from the Rio Grande Valley to Laredo, where the median price
for high-grade urban fringe land soared to $40,000 per acre, the
center reported.
</P>
<P>
   But some Texas land isn't so pricey. In West Texas' Big Bend
region and the Oil Patch, ``low-quality'' native rangeland sold for
a statewide low of $43 an acre in spring 1999, and at the top of
the Panhandle, nonirrigated cropland went for $150 an acre.
</P>
<P>
   Many rural land owners are able to cling to their land because
they are in strong financial shape, Gilliland said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last go-round in the '80s, a lot of farmers that had a
lot of debt were wiped out. They're gone already,'' Gilliland
explained. ``The ones that were left were probably in better
financial shape. They're not as vulnerable. Of course, a couple
more years of drought and bad prices could change a lot of that.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's not just dirt they might be selling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The water is going to be much more valuable to the urban users
than it is to agriculture in the future,'' Gilliland predicted.
``Farmers and ranchers are probably going to sell out _ sell their
water rights _ and not produce agricultural products because of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Some experts predict Texas will have a ``megalopolis'' in the
next century. A heavily populated area _ with the corners being
Beaumont, San Antonio, Denison and Marshall _ that could rival the
biggest urban areas of the East and West Coasts, Texas' chief
demographer Steve H. Murdock said in a report this year.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, other observers don't see Texas getting completely
paved over anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not worried, because of our incredible land mass,'' said
Texas Agriculture Commissioner Susan Combs. ``Houston and San
Antonio are not going to stretch to Midland. That's not going to
happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the year 2030, we're supposed to have about 33 million
people in the state,'' Combs said, up from the current 20 million.
``No matter how you look at it, they're not going to take up all
that land.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the loss of a quarter-million farming acres a year won't
destroy Texas' ability to feed itself and others, Combs said. Her
comments echoed statements of USDA officials who said the nation's
food supply is healthy and benefits from increased productivity on
its dwindling farmland.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not going to impact our ability to produce food and
fiber. That's not a concern. From an agriculture production
perspective, we're not going to find that we cannot produce food,''
Combs insisted. Before that ever happens, ``we'll get more
efficient,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over how to manage urban growth into rural areas is
already part of the 2000 presidential campaign, said Mark Dotzour,
director of research at the A&AMP;M center.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be one of the most timely topics of the next
decade because of the overwhelming population growth facing us,''
Dotzour said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to be able to provide housing for those
people, and you just can't draw circles around cities and say
`we're not going to allow urban sprawl to happen,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dotzour, who studies urban real estate sales, said the state may
see more urban sprawl like that seen north of Houston, blending
housing and workplaces.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the big cities, the traffic situation's getting difficult.
In downtown areas, the pressure is on to move offices and even some
light industries out to the suburbs, so that you don't have such a
big commute time. The Woodlands is a case in point,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Woodlands is an affluent community of 37,500 people just
north of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a certain point of view, you can say The Woodlands is
urban sprawl because it's outside of the central business district
of Houston,'' Dotzour said. ``But on the other hand, I think that's
where it needs to go in the future.''

GOP'S `SECOND-TIER' CANDIDATES LAG IN POLLS BUT LEAD IN TENACITY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KIM COBB 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They register as single-digit blips in the public opinion polls,
candidates frequently dismissed by the pundits as ``second-tier''
GOP presidential hopefuls.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer, the big-stick fundamentalist; Orrin Hatch, the
senior U.S. senator from Utah; and Alan Keyes, the former
ambassador and fiery orator are tenaciously pursuing Republican
presidential aspirations despite narrow odds.
</P>
<P>
   It could happen, the candidates argue. It's nearly a year away
from the election, and the perceived front-runners could stumble.
</P>
<P>
   But if candidates do not make an impact in the first caucuses
and primaries in coming weeks, their donor bases will shrivel and
they'll soon be out of the game. The modern political axiom is that
presidential candidates are like armies in battle _ they are not
destroyed, as much as their supplies give out.
</P>
<P>
   Yet holding down the bottom of the polls gives a candidate the
freedom to take chances. In the debates of recent weeks, televised
from New Hampshire and Arizona, many observers see the real passion
of the campaign coming from the so-called ``second tier.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
GARY BAUER &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's not easy to find a presidential contender conservative
enough to suit Gary Bauer. A leader in the Christian conservative
movement, Bauer started thinking maybe he was the best man for the
job more than three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew very frustrated watching the (1996) presidential
debates because Bob Dole was not making the case for conservative
values,'' Bauer said recently. ``I ran out of shoes to throw at the
television set during those debates, and I think a lot of other
Reagan-type conservatives did also.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer, 53, worked in the Reagan administration as a domestic
policy adviser before taking the helm of a nascent Christian
conservative think tank a decade ago. The Family Research Council
grew from a $1 million a year operation to a $14 million a year
lobbying force over the 10 years Bauer was in charge.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer made his name as a fundamentalist power broker so
immovable that he sometimes made Ralph Reed, former head of the
Christian Coalition, look like a moderate. The Family Research
Council shares many issues with the Christian Coalition, but
Bauer's group has been more openly critical of Republican leaders
in Congress in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of us were looking for who could fill that vacuum that
Reagan left,'' Bauer said. ``It was during that period (during and
after the 1996 election) that I started getting quite a bit of mail
... suggesting instead of looking for someone else, I should think
about running myself.''
</P>
<P>
   A Republican strategist who has known Bauer for years, but has
requested anonymity, says he's still puzzled by Bauer's decision to
run. Bauer has neither the media audience nor the following behind
ultraconservative candidates such as Pat Robertson in 1988 or, more
recently, Pat Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   And, he adds, the Christian conservative movement is in
disarray, especially when compared to the glory days of Robertson's
``moral majority.''
</P>
<P>
   When Bauer told longtime friend Bill Kristol, a former aide to
Dan Quayle and now editor of the conservative Weekly Standard, that
he wanted to run for president, Kristol said he did not try to
dissuade him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe there's a market for someone like Gary who takes on
these social and moral issues,'' Kristol said, adding, ``Look, his
candidacy was always a longshot.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is a real possibility that Bauer will outpoll Forbes
in the Iowa caucuses, Kristol said. Winning the nomination may be
farfetched, he said, but doing ``respectably'' is not.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do, you're a major figure in the party,`` Kristol said.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer's agenda is one that many mainstream Republican candidates
shy away from after the last two dramatic Republican presidential
losses and the 1998 congressional elections. Bauer is unequivocally
opposed to abortion, wants a constitutional amendment to ban it and
pledges to nominate only anti-abortion justices to the Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   He opposes gay rights and is an ardent supporter of school
prayer and abstinence education. He would begin his term as
president with a major tax cut, he says, and supports a 16 percent
flat tax.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bauer's passion is to end abortion, he also is
identified with ending Most Favored Nation status for China _ a
topic that doesn't really energize the grass roots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it resonates or not, it's an important issue to the
country,'' Bauer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He almost seems to have been downplaying the moral and
Christian agenda by saying he's not a Christian candidate and he
shouldn't be viewed that way,'' the Republican strategist said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Bauer is not running as a Christian conservative, he
says George W. Bush can't get the party's nomination without them.
He plays to the uneasiness some have expressed with Bush's
middle-of-the-road conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of them have decided he's good enough,'' Bauer said.
``It's my job to explain why he is not. But it would be a mistake
to (correlate) his climb in the polls with a decline in that group.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think those (social conservative) voters are the Republican
Party,'' Bauer said. ``I think that's why every candidate says
they're pro-life and pro-family, even if they won't do much about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a long history in this country of issue-oriented
presidential candidates who are almost, by definition, incapable of
being elected. They can, however, move the philosophical center of
their party,'' the Republican strategist said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The danger for those candidates is if you run as a cause or
ideological candidate and you don't do well, your issues suffer
commensurately. That's the danger that I think confronts Bauer.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer says he's not just trying to push his party to the right,
but is in it to win. He confesses that he is sometimes startled to
find himself still in the race after Elizabeth Dole, Lamar
Alexander and Dan Quayle have bowed out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm walking out on a (debate) stage with six podiums, running
for president, and I'm the son of a janitor,'' Bauer said. ``So
this is a great experience.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
ORRIN HATCH &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The day Orrin Hatch announced he was running for president,
George W. Bush stole his thunder by announcing he'd already raised
a record $36 million in campaign funds.
</P>
<P>
   That would be enough to dampen any candidate's enthusiasm, but
Hatch greeted the news with puckish determination. If he could just
get 1 million donors to write checks for just $36 apiece, he said,
he'd be in as good a financial position as Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had the fat cats on board, he reasoned, so he'd mount a
``skinny-cat'' campaign. His small donors helped him raise enough
money to meet the threshold for federal matching funds last month,
which will provide enough money for advertising in the critical
Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary, but little more.
</P>
<P>
   Even in his home state of Utah, people initially greeted his
candidacy for president with puzzlement, said state Republican
Chairman Rob Bishop. ``But I don't see that any more.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people in Utah are proud of having one of their own as
a legitimate presidential prospect,'' Bishop said. His call for $36
donations netted Hatch about $500,000 from Utah alone, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're not convinced he can do it, they're at least
willing to put their money out there to see how far he can go,''
Bishop said. ``When the matching funds hit, that should put him up
around $3 million, and that's a credible start to a campaign.``
</P>
<P>
   Bishop sees some obvious parallels between Hatch's 11th-hour
decision to run for the U.S. Senate in 1976 (defeating a three-term
incumbent) and his relatively late announcement for the presidency
in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most political experts gave him no hope or chance of being
elected,'' Bishop said of the 1976 race. ``In fact, some of the
insiders in the know were really snotty to him _ and he pulled it
off.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, 65, seems to relish the underdog role in a David and
Goliath political confrontation. Take his exchange with Bush in a
recent televised debate in Arizona, in which he suggested the
front-runner consider joining his ticket as a candidate for vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Just think, Ronald Reagan picked your father because he had
foreign policy experience,'' the senator said, referring to former
President Bush. ``Somebody suggested the other day that you should
pick me (as vice president) because I have foreign policy
experience. They got it all wrong. I should be president; you
should have eight years with me and boy, you'd make a heck of a
president after eight years.''
</P>
<P>
   The audience roared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, I'm the only one running in either party who has a
reputation for bringing both sides together in this divided city
called Washington,'' Hatch said. ``I could walk into the White
House and be effective from Day One.''
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the powerful Senate Judiciary Committee, Hatch
says the power to shape the nation's federal court system is ``a
huge motivating factor'' in his decision to run for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the end of eight years (in office) Clinton will have
appointed 50 percent of the judiciary,'' Hatch said. ``The next
president will appoint the other 50 percent, and up to five
justices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to say, I do not want 100 percent of the judiciary to
have been appointed by Clinton and Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch also wants to reduce the tax burden, simplifying the tax
code and saving Social Security and Medicaid. The next president
must strengthen the military, he says, and get the federal
government out of the schools.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch has come under fire recently for one of his own campaign
choices, having used a private jet owned by a pharmaceutical
company for some of his campaign travel. Shering-Plough Corp. of
New Jersey was, at the same time, seeking approval from the Senate
Judiciary Committee to keep its popular allergy drug Claritin from
being cloned by lower-priced generic drug makers.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch postponed the vote after the flap erupted over the use of
the company plane _ a practice the FEC allows as long as the
candidate reimburses the owner the cost of an equivalent
first-class ticket. He has firmly denied that using the drug
company's plane to meet tight campaign schedules represents any
kind of conflict of interest, frequently reminding critics that he
co-authored the 1984 legislation that allows the marketing of
cheaper, generic drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., knows Hatch well from their years
together on the Judiciary Committee and describes Hatch as
passionate about justice and opportunity for the underprivileged,
Specter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He speaks about growing up dirt poor in Pittsburgh, selling
eggs and tending chickens,'' Specter said. ``He's very much a
self-made man.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got into the race a little late, and he got into the race
underfunded,'' Specter said.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch concedes he's frustrated by his poor standings in the
polls. ``Sure, but I'm also realistic,'' he said. ``I didn't file
until July 1. Automatically, the media discounted me. They think
there's no way I can do this. They don't know me.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
ALAN KEYES &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Alan Keyes grips the edge of a lectern and turns on That
Voice, people stop to listen.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes Keyes strikes a chord that resonates, frequently he
strikes a nerve. But he does not choose his message to please an
audience _ he is convinced he is right.
</P>
<P>
   His view of America is that of a people being sucked into a
``howling moral void,`` fed by the disintegration of the family. He
spelled out his apocalyptic vision vividly in a Fourth of July
speech in Iowa:
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's time we admit, the stock market may be going up
and for some, particularly those who aren't being destroyed by
depressed farm prices, the economy may be great,'' Keyes said.
``But I've got news for you. If the great moral heart of America is
being destroyed, if the conscience of America is being undone, then
it won't be long before all the rest tumbles from its pedestal.''
</P>
<P>
   For Keyes, restoring the ``great moral heart of America'' means
government that rejects abortion, euthanasia, and gun control.
Homosexuality is a behavioral choice, he argues, and he opposes
legislating rights for gays &UR; . &LR;  He frowns on sex education courses
that encourage promiscuity, saying they should be abolished from
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes has even endorsed public paddling of parents who abandon
their children.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes left Harvard graduate school as a young man with a fully
developed reputation for outspokenness. He entered the State
Department Foreign Service and began to rise quickly, his brashness
earning him a nickname _ ``the undiplomatic young diplomat.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet before he was 35, he was tapped by President Reagan to be
the highest-ranking black in the State Department _ the assistant
secretary for international organization affairs.
</P>
<P>
   But he resigned in September 1987, citing a racial snub by
Deputy Secretary of State John C. Whitehead, who in turn described
their conflict as a disagreement over a minor administrative issue.
A year later, he was running for the U.S. Senate in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes was selected to run by the state GOP in 1988 after the
winner in the primary stepped down. He lost, not unexpectedly, in
the heavily Democratic state.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes tried again in 1992, this time beating all the other GOP
hopefuls outright in the primary. But after a minor scandal over
his desire to draw an $8,000 monthly campaign salary from his war
chest, he lost.
</P>
<P>
   That was the same election cycle that saw Keyes battling the
Republican National Convention in Houston for podium time. The
convention hierarchy said they couldn't spare time for every
candidate running for the U.S. Senate, and former Maryland
Republican Chairwoman Joyce Lyons Tehres said Keyes immediately
questioned whether the refusal was racially motivated.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did ( finally) let Alan speak,'' Tehres said. ``I was
standing at the back of the hall and I heard that voice. And just
hearing the response of the attendees at that convention, someone
said, who is that? And it was Alan Keyes.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, having established himself as a radio talk show host
and a popular public speaker, Keyes made his first run for
president. His friend Marlo Lewis, staff director for a House
subcommittee, says Keyes decided to run because he truly wants to
be president, and because he thought the GOP needed a ``voice of
conscience'' to defend its commitment to ``the pro-life cause.''
</P>
<P>
   He fared poorly in the primaries, making perhaps his biggest
splash when he tried to force his way into two televised debates
restricted to the GOP front-runners. Four years later, Lewis said,
Keyes still wants to be president, but thinks it will take time to
be successful. ``He knows if you don't start, you never get
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Keyes accuses the news media of ignoring his current campaign
because he is black _ ``a blackout to keep the black out,'' in his
words. However, repeated attempts to schedule an interview with
Keyes for this story were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   A December editorial in the Manchester (N.H.) Union-Leader
agrees that the media are ignoring Keyes, ``but it's not because
he's black. It's because they have already foolishly decided he
will not be a factor, much as the Republican honchos in Washington
have already decided.''
</P>
<P>
   Though scientific public opinion surveys show Keyes has little
support, he brags about winning a number of online polls after
recent televised debates. His Web site has links to a plethora of
online presidential polls and his supporters are instructed to
``make sure Alan Keyes wins every online presidential poll over the
next two years. Please vote only once. ...''
</P>
<P>
   However, the Free Republic Presidential Straw Poll site noted
Dec. 8 that Keyes voters had ``stuffed'' their electronic ballot
box with in excess of 39,000 bogus votes over the previous weekend.
He still won the poll with 41 percent, even after the bogus votes
were eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, whose wife is Keyes' chief of staff, says there was no
organized effort to ``pack'' the Internet polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously those aren't scientific polls,'' Lewis said, ``But
the point is, as (pollster) Dick Morris put it so well, Alan really
does ignite something in people and he touches a chord.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he keeps creaming his counterparts in these debates and
speaking to the heart of what people care about, his candidacy
can't be written off.''

&HT;     ADOPTION: AN ANTHOLOGY OF VOICES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By BERNADETTE FAY  
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO_ There have been memoirs, remembrances and how-tos
on the
</P>
<P>
   subject of adoption. But ``A Ghost at Heart's Edge, Stories
</P>
<P>
   and Poems About Adoption,'' published by North Atlantic Books,
</P>
<P>
   is the first book to look at adoption through the lens of
</P>
<P>
   fiction. The anthology of 52 poems and stories navigates a
</P>
<P>
   landscape that stretches from searing loss to ecstasy, from
</P>
<P>
   naked pain to reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   Co-editors Tina Cervin and Susan Ito have assembled a
</P>
<P>
   remarkable collection of voices from all sides of the adoption
</P>
<P>
   triad, from Charles Baxter, Alison Lurie and Louise Erdrich to
</P>
<P>
   lesser-known writers and poets. Nothing is taken for granted
</P>
<P>
   here. The collection bursts with a tumult of issues that shake
</P>
<P>
   us to our bones. Who are we? How do we find our way? What is
</P>
<P>
   family? Of course, searching for one's place in the world is
</P>
<P>
   nothing new to literature. And that's partly the point of the
</P>
<P>
   book.
</P>
<P>
   ``The themes of family, selfhood, loss, joy are universal
</P>
<P>
   themes,'' says Cervin.
</P>
<P>
   The aim was to present as many perspectives as possible
</P>
<P>
   about adoption, which touches 30 million Americans ? ``To open
</P>
<P>
   the door,'' Cervin says.
</P>
<P>
   It took them seven years to pull it off. Two weeks after
</P>
<P>
   placing requests for submissions in ``Poets &AMP; Writers'' and
</P>
<P>
   ``Associated Writing Programs,'' and two weeks before Cervin's
</P>
<P>
   first son was born, they were swamped with manuscripts. Ito
</P>
<P>
   was herself a new mother, and the two spent the next several
</P>
<P>
   years schlepping shopping bags full of stories and poetry.
</P>
<P>
   There was one fact keeping them focused: Ito, who teaches
</P>
<P>
   writing and is adopted, recently had found her birth mother.
</P>
<P>
   Cervin remembers she kept telling Ito, ``You should do a book
</P>
<P>
   about adoption.'' Ito finally followed her friend's advice, on
one condition: that Cervin, a psychotherapist and poet, do the book
with her.
</P>
<P>
   Ito's life story is itself the stuff of fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Half-Japanese, she was placed as an infant with a Japanese
</P>
<P>
   couple who had spent 10 years waiting for a child.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were constantly, as a family, barraged by (race
</P>
<P>
   questions),'' Ito says. ``At one point, it was in the early
</P>
<P>
   '60s .,.,. they were traveling with me in the South, and
</P>
<P>
   someone actually accused them of kidnapping me.'' Ito tells
</P>
<P>
   the story without bitterness or anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that a lot of people who are adopted can `pass'
</P>
<P>
   as not being adopted,'' Ito says. ``But especially with
</P>
<P>
   transracial adoptions, it's there all the time. I think we
</P>
<P>
   just all swallowed it down and pretended it wasn't there. And
</P>
<P>
   I think that's one reason why, for me, it's such a relief to
</P>
<P>
   have voices that talk about difficult things.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all under the lumpy carpet _ it's all under the
</P>
<P>
   surface of our lives as a family, but nobody talks about it.
</P>
<P>
   So I feel that, in a way, this book is like, not redemption,''
</P>
<P>
   Ito says, searching for the right word, ``but acknowledgement
</P>
<P>
   of all the complexities of (adoption).''
</P>
<P>
   The mission of the anthology, Cervin says, is getting to
</P>
<P>
   the truth of a difficult subject. Part of that truth is pain.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the stories and poems deal with the pain of adoption _
</P>
<P>
   on all sides. Many of the stories peek under the lumpy carpet
</P>
<P>
   to see, as in Isabel Allende's ``The Road North,'' trafficking
</P>
<P>
   in Latin American children; or, in poems by Jackie Kay and Mi
Song Bruining, the brittle realities of transracial adoption and
the burden of being ``chosen,'' which masks the burden of having
been given up.
</P>
<P>
   This prompts two questions: What does fiction offer that
</P>
<P>
   nonfiction doesn't? And, can someone who isn't adopted write
</P>
<P>
   truthfully about the experience?
</P>
<P>
   Ito believes fiction allows people to see more truthfully,
</P>
<P>
   to plumb ideas and emotions with a certain detachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a distance that allows people to go deeper,'' she
</P>
<P>
   says.
</P>
<P>
   Cervin nods, adding, ``It's a distance that brings you
</P>
<P>
   closer.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the validity of writing from personal experience,
</P>
<P>
   Cervin says, ``There's always that argument within the writing
</P>
<P>
   community: Do you have to have personal experience to write
</P>
<P>
   about something? A writer or poet has to have a certain
</P>
<P>
   ability to tap into something if you want to write about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was able to write a poem about being adopted, and I'm
</P>
<P>
   not adopted. But I've known Susan for almost 20 years, and my
</P>
<P>
   mother went on a search for her father, and I've known many
</P>
<P>
   people who were adopted. I feel I tapped into the experience
</P>
<P>
   both of the people I know, but also just the human experience
</P>
<P>
   of identity and search for meaning, and how does this piece of
</P>
<P>
   information fit into my life?''
</P>
<P>
   Good writing, of course, makes every story autobiography,
</P>
<P>
   every word telling, every emotion true. But Ito and Cervin
</P>
<P>
   have been criticized because the author blurbs at the back of
</P>
<P>
   their anthology don't necessarily reveal who has had real
</P>
<P>
   experience with adoption and who hasn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a strength,'' Cervin says. ``Because our goal was
</P>
<P>
   a literary collection. And I think first and foremost people
</P>
<P>
   represented themselves as writers, not as adopted people who
</P>
<P>
   are writers.''
</P>
<P>
   But it does show how familiar words _ family, mother,
</P>
<P>
   Identity _ can be weighted with new meaning.
</P>
<P>
   So what was the hardest part of collecting the 52 entries?
</P>
<P>
   After weeding out the sappy and the sentimental, after the
</P>
<P>
   hand-wringing over the voices that weren't heard from (the
</P>
<P>
   editors wished they had received more stories on transracial
</P>
<P>
   adoptions, and lesbian and gay adoptions), the two had to come
</P>
<P>
   up with a title.
</P>
<P>
   ``We both finally feel really good about the title,'' Ito
</P>
<P>
   says, laughing with something that sounds like relief. ``I
</P>
<P>
   feel it's so perfect because it really reflects every facet of
</P>
<P>
   the triad experience. There's that ghost if you're adopted _
</P>
<P>
   the family you don't know or the people you don't know who
</P>
<P>
   created you. And then if you're the birth parent, the kind of
</P>
<P>
   phantom child who isn't with you anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I also think for the adoptive parents there's the ghost of
the children they might have had or maybe wanted to have that
didn't materialize, because so many adoptive parents have
infertility as their way of getting into adoption.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, they found their title in a submission by Katharyn
Howd Machan:
</P>
<P>
   20 years now
</P>
<P>
   I have lived with others,
</P>
<P>
   your unknown name
</P>
<P>
   like a ghost at heart's edge
</P>
<P>
   And, finally, after seven years, they have their book _
</P>
<P>
   a remarkable chorus of pregnant teens and wary women; fathers
</P>
<P>
   relinquishing fatherhood or gaining relationships; mothers
</P>
<P>
   being sought and would-be mothers seeking; and, of course, the
</P>
<P>
   adopted _ babies, adolescents and adults negotiating the whole
</P>
<P>
   crazy DNA dance and searching for something that looks like
</P>
<P>
   home.

&HT;     WISCONSIN GEARS UP FOR THIRD ROSE BOWL IN SIX YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ About half an hour into Wisconsin's first
</P>
<P>
   football practice at the Coliseum a fight broke out, with two
</P>
<P>
   linemen going at each other with roundhouse punches.
</P>
<P>
   This is a team practicing with a nasty edge, with the air
</P>
<P>
   of the underdog. Don't try telling them that they're actually
</P>
<P>
   favored over Stanford in next Saturday's Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter,'' All-Big 10 defensive end Wendell
</P>
<P>
   Bryant said. ``You still have to play like the underdog. .,.,.
</P>
<P>
   It changes nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Badgers flew from Madison, Wis., late Christmas Day. They
got right to
</P>
<P>
   business Sunday under sunny Southern California skies.
</P>
<P>
   The team was in full pads, with many players dripping in
</P>
<P>
   sweat in a climate more than 50 degrees warmer than back home.
</P>
<P>
   The first team offense was going against the first team
</P>
<P>
   defense in scrimmage conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We banged around pretty good,'' coach Barry Alvarez said
</P>
<P>
   after the practice. ``We tried to get the speed of the
</P>
<P>
   game,'' he added, noting the Badgers were coming back from off
</P>
<P>
   days Friday and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought our guys got back in the swing of things,'' he
</P>
<P>
   said. ``They did better than I expected.''
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez said Wisconsin will practice in full pads, with

</P>
<P>
   This is Wisconsin's second consecutive trip to the Rose

</P>
<P>
   ``Our players and coaches don't pay much attention to who's

</P>
<P>
   ``We've already been beaten by Cincinnati,'' he said,

<P>

<P>
   said, adding he was driven by the chance to win respect for
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin's football program. ``A lot of people overlook us.
</P>
<P>
   People don't consider us a big powerhouse like Penn State or O

</P>
<P>
   The Badgers are 9-2 and come into the Rose Bowl on a seven-

</P>
<P>
   Before the trip here in '94, the Badgers hadn't been to the

<P>
   Rose Bowl in 31 years.
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez remembered the lowly program he took over 10 years
</P>
<P>
   ago. ``It was flat on its back,'' he said, ``one of the worst
</P>
<P>
   in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   He built the program up by going out of state, particularly
</P>
<P>
   to the East Coast, where recruits included this year's Heisman
</P>
<P>
   Trophy winner, Ron Dayne, a native of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could always get big linemen,'' he said of the
</P>
<P>
   homegrown talent in Wisconsin. ``But to get skill players you
</P>
<P>
   have to go elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are 63 players from Wisconsin on the roster
</P>
<P>
   this year and 46 from other states, including five from

INDUSTRY REDISCOVERS BASIC RESEARCH 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times) 
(mk) 
 By WILLIAM J. BROAD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   American industry is pouring extraordinary sums of money into
research and development in an effort to nurture strong growth,
private and federal officials are reporting.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had once feared that American industry in the 1990s,
faced with rising global competition, tightening budgets and
growing demands for quick profitability from investors, was quietly
abandoning the kind of high-risk research that historically has
produced the biggest payoffs and breakthroughs. Worrisome examples
cited by experts are W.R. Grace and Eastman Chemical, which
recently closed the doors on corporate laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   But a new study by the Industrial Research Institute, a
nonprofit group in Washington that represents large companies, says
overall trends turn out to be strongly the opposite _ and federal
officials in interviews echoed the upbeat numbers and analyses.
</P>
<P>
   The report, titled ``Basic Research in Industry,'' is based on
federal data and institute surveys, and concludes, ``Industry is
doing more long-range, high-risk, discovery-type research than ever
before.'' It was released on Dec. 15 by Charles F. Larson,
executive director of the institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was amazed at the growth,'' Larson said in an interview.
``I've been sensing this for some time but was delighted to find
that it was true in terms of the hard numbers. It's a new era.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1994 to 1999, the study said, American industrial research
and development grew to a projected $166 billion from $97.1
billion, a rise of 71 percent, or slightly less if adjusted for
inflation, and in any case more than double the spending of the
federal government, which in 1999 is putting $75 billion into
research and development. Until the 1980s, the government was the
nation's unrivaled research leader as it probed new frontiers with
innovative technology from atom smashers to orbiting telescopes.
</P>
<P>
   By soaring during the past five years, industrial research and
development is rebounding from a flat period in the early 1990s,
when companies cut back on research in an effort to try to raise
efficiencies and cut redundancies. By 1992, Japan was seen as
having equaled or surpassed the United States as the world's top
patron of industrial research and development, giving it a powerful
weapon in the trade wars to produce a new wave of innovative goods
and services.
</P>
<P>
   But America is now indisputably back on top, with Japanese
industry spending some $95 billion last year, far less than the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the industrial money goes into the relatively prosaic
work of development, like engineering, making prototypes and
testing products. A lesser amount goes into applied research, which
focuses on making new products, processes and services for
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   A major surprise of the study, Larson said, is that directed
basic research _ the blue-sky pursuit of products and services that
might lie a decade in the future _ has grown even faster than
overall research and development in the past half decade. It is up
82 percent, to $10.9 billion in 1999 from $6 billion in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The Industrial Research Institute found that the rise came
mainly from companies doing business in the life and information
sciences, including enterprises like Cisco Systems, Compaq
Computer, Lilly &AMP; Co., Lucent Technologies, Merck &AMP; Co., Microsoft,
Monsanto and Sun Microsystems. Microsoft is reportedly investing 17
percent of its sales in research and development, and many
companies are putting in more.
</P>
<P>
   The feverish growth, Larson said, comes in reaction to strong
global competition and is made possible by healthy corporate
profits and cash flows. Other factors, he said, include the spread
of the idea that the economy is increasingly knowledge-driven, and
that raising intellectual capital is a good way to manage the
corporate enterprise for growth in sales, profits and shareholder
value.
</P>
<P>
   He added that many companies, including Intel, Hewlett-Packard,
Lucent, IBM, Texas Instruments and Xerox, have begun ``skunk
works,'' or independent start-ups, to help foster innovation.
</P>
<P>
   John E. Jankowski, a financial analyst at the National Science
Foundation, a federal agency that tracks science spending, said
that the Industrial Research Institute study was right on target.
``Our statistics show strong positive growth,'' he said. ``We've
had a very positive trend in terms of industrial research and
development.''

   ISRAEL-POLITICS (Jerusalem) _ The Shas political party's threats
to bolt and break Prime Minister Ehud Barak's coalition government
have been a leitmotif of the Israeli leader's six months in office.
On Monday the threats were formalized when Shas, an ultra-Orthodox
party that represents Sephardic Jews of Middle Eastern and North
African descent, announced its decision to quit the government. By
withdrawing its 17 members of Parliament, Shas would leave Barak
with a minority government of 51 out of 120 members. Small parties
and Arab parties that are nominally in the opposition would keep
Barak's government from falling. But Shas' departure would throw
the political system into chaos just as it was facing important
budgetary and peacemaking deadlines. By Deborah Sontag.

   Radiologists, cardiologists and pathologists who are conducting
medical tests on the hospital premises use some 20 Enterprise
Express phone stations scattered around the hospital to dictate
test results that will be added to patient records.
</P>
<P>
   The system can handle simultaneous dictation by 112 physicians,
more than 10 percent of the hospital's physician team. And Ms.
Moore called the voice quality superb. ``The transcriptionists tell
me it's as though the dictator was in the room,'' she said.
``That's cut errors and transcriber turnover.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Dictaphone, as it lays plans for a stock offering, is getting an
ever-warmer reception on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they'd talked about going IPO nine months ago, everyone
would have laughed,'' said George Edwards, a portfolio manager at
Prudential Investments whose holdings include Dictaphone's
high-yield bonds. ``But the numbers are stronger, and there are
visible new products.''
</P>
<P>
   The company is still laboring under a heavy debt load from
Stonington's $462 million buyout in 1995. And its revenue was up
only 4 percent in the first nine months of 1999, to $264 million.
But Duerden said that sales were up 12 percent in the third
quarter, compared with a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   And the company cut its losses to $4.6 million during the last
nine months, compared with a loss of $26.9 million for the first
nine months of 1998. Moreover, Dictaphone's nine-month operating
profit _ a number that does not include interest payments _ was
$27.5 million, compared with just $2.2 million for the first nine
months of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Dictaphone's path has been strewn with boulder-size
obstacles. When Duerden took over the company, it had 550 sales
people and 700 service people, few of whom had the expertise to
sell digital products to doctors or police chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   Dictaphone let many of these employees go, figuring that
independent dealers could sell their low-end products. But dealers
have been lukewarm to the products, particularly overseas, and
Dictaphone's office-equipment revenue has declined. And the
sales-force reduction did little to trim Dictaphone's costs, since
the cuts were largely offset by the cadre of programmers and
digitally savvy sales people who were needed for its new products.
</P>
<P>
   Duerden also has made some expensive mistakes. He made a
last-ditch attempt to introduce a voice mail product, but found
that Lucent Technologies and other well-heeled competitors had the
market locked up. And he licensed a product from an Australian
company that was meant to replace court stenographers with
recording and transcription devices. But the system was expensive
and complicated to use, and judges were skeptical. Unable to
finance a marketing blitz to win them over, Dictaphone pulled the
plug last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spread our net too widely,'' Duerden said, ``and we brought
Da Vinci and Freedom to market a year later than we would have
liked.''
</P>
<P>
   The delay has hurt the company, which is playing technological
catch-up with competitors like Lanier Worldwide in the medical
market, and Nice Systems Ltd. of Israel in the call-center world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dictaphone has a shot at a reasonable market share, but they
are too late to ever be leaders,'' said Victor Halpert, an analyst
at Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the contrast to Nice is sobering. Nice's sales
skyrocketed to $120 million this year from just $5 million in 1994,
when it first branched out from military intelligence systems to
systems for recording and tracking call-center communications.
Benny Levin, Nice's chairman, predicts sales will hit $500 million
in five years, as he uses the company's publicly traded stock and
$110 million in cash on hand to acquire other companies. ``We won't
let what happened to Dictaphone happen to us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Duerden readily acknowledges the implied criticism. ``Benny
jumped our technology by three years, forcing us to reconfigure Da
Vinci before we could even introduce it,'' he said. ``You can't
discount these kinds of competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, after a miserable 1998 _ a year in which Dictaphone
consistently lost money _ Dictaphone is finally back on its fiscal
feet. The digital products are easier and cheaper to make than
their tape-based predecessors, which bodes well for Dictaphone's
profit margins. It is using some of its excess manufacturing
capacity to make facsimile machines for Pitney Bowes and to
assemble circuit boards for Monarch Electronics, another former
Pitney Bowes subsidiary. The manufacturing business is bringing in
about $50 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Dictaphone has also revved up overseas sales to call-center
customers, and now counts the London offices of Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter and the Bank of Nova Scotia among its users in Britain and
Canada, and is signing up distributors in the Far East. And it is
talking to Siemens and other computer companies about including
Dictaphone recording and tracking systems in some of their
products.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Stonington, which specializes in leveraged buyouts, financed the
Dictaphone purchase with high-yield bonds, and from the first
Dictaphone was saddled with $40 million annual interest on a $350
million debt. For a company whose sales barely hit that level, it
was an onerous load.
</P>
<P>
   ``We generated $64 million from operations, and immediately had
to funnel $40 million toward interest,'' recalled Joseph
Skrzypczak, a former Pitney Bowes executive who is now Dictaphone's
chief financial officer. ``Take another $12 million or so out for
maintaining computers and other capital investments, and you don't
have a lot left for anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   By last year, Dictaphone's income from operations was down to
$31 million, not enough to service debt, let alone develop products
and upgrade computer systems. Stonington made up the shortfall,
though. And, analysts estimate that Dictaphone's operating income
is back near $60 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're approaching the time when we're ready for the public
markets, and we're happy we own Dictaphone now,'' Fitzgibbons said.
``But there were certainly times we wondered if we hadn't overpaid
for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dictaphone still labors under $345 million in debt, and
Skrzypczak concedes that its interest payments and modernization
expenses leave it little breathing room.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference, though, is that in 1995 all we had was debt
and old products,'' he said. ``This time we've replenished our
product line.''

PERSONAL HEALTH: PAYING THE PRICE FOR CHEATING ON SLEEP 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times) 
(lb) 
 By JANE E. BRODY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is probably no time of year when America's sleep debt is
greater than it is right now. Starting with Thanksgiving week,
holiday preparations and parties, gift shopping and packaging,
family visits and extra hours of work to make up for days off
prompt millions of Americans to cheat on their sleep even more than
usual. Many are used to being tired and think, optimistically, that
they'll catch up with lost sleep after the New Year.
</P>
<P>
   But few do. And new research suggests that the consequences of
chronic sleep deprivation may be far worse than simply diminished
mental sharpness, shortened tempers and a tendency to doze off at
every quiet moment. Rather, sleep scientists at the University of
Chicago found that those who suffer from an accumulated sleep debt
may develop serious health problems, including obesity, diabetes
and high blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   In a study inspired and partly financed by the MacArthur
Foundation, Dr. Katrine Spiegal, Dr. Eve Van Cauter and Rachel
Leproult found that even in young, healthy people, as little as a
weeklong sleep debt of three or four hours a night has adverse
effects on the body's ability to process carbohydrates, manage
stress, maintain a proper balance of hormones and fight off
infections.
</P>
<P>
   Sleep Lost, Never Regained
</P>
<P>
   Most previous studies looked only at short-term sleep
deprivation _ keeping people awake for 24 or 48 hours _ and
explored only the effects on mental performance, alertness and
mood, which do indeed suffer from a lack of sleep.
</P>
<P>
   In the new study, Dr. Van Cauter and her colleagues examined the
physiological effects of sleeping only four hours a night for six
straight nights, a not uncommon practice, especially at this time
of year. As one of millions trying each day to cram 36 hours' worth
of activity into 24, I listened carefully to what Dr. Van Cauter
had to say, and I suggest you do too.
</P>
<P>
   ``With prolonged sleep deprivation, we found effects much more
relevant to health than result from the loss of one or two nights'
sleep,'' Dr. Van Cauter said in an interview. ``We found that an
accumulated sleep debt is potentially as detrimental to health as
poor nutrition or a sedentary lifestyle. It may be as bad as
smoking. People are sleeping less and less and becoming more and
more tired. They may be very careful about exercise, good nutrition
and vitamins, but they're sleeping only five hours a night.''
</P>
<P>
   Previous studies have indicated that the average adult needs
eight to nine hours of sleep a night, but the typical American gets
only seven and many get considerably less, without ever catching
up.
</P>
<P>
   While it is true that individual sleep needs vary _ there are
natural ``short sleepers'' and ``long sleepers'' who fall well
outside the average _ it is also true that many short sleepers push
themselves considerably beyond what is natural, staying up until
midnight doing chores or watching television, and then rising to an
alarm at 4:30 or 5 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   These are the people who fall asleep on commuter trains and
buses, at plays and concerts and, sometimes, behind the wheel. Some
even doze off at business meetings or at the computer.
</P>
<P>
   A Physiological Toll
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Van Cauter and her colleagues found that sleep deprivation
caused ``striking alterations in metabolic and endocrine function''
that mimicked some of the hallmarks of aging.
</P>
<P>
   They conducted a very thorough study of 11 healthy men aged 18
to 27 who spent 16 consecutive nights in a clinical laboratory
where the researchers tightly controlled the amount of time they
spent in bed. After three eight-hour nights, they were restricted
to six consecutive four-hour nights, followed by seven 12-hour
nights. None were allowed to sleep during the day.
</P>
<P>
   Repeated blood and saliva samples enabled the researchers to
gauge the metabolic and hormonal effects of the shortened nights.
Striking deficits occurred in the participants' abilities to
process glucose.
</P>
<P>
   This results in a rise in blood glucose, a condition that
prompts the body to spew out more and more insulin, which
ultimately leads to insulin resistance, the hallmark of adult-onset
diabetes. Excess insulin also promotes the storage of body fat,
thus increasing the risk of obesity and high blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The brain can use glucose for energy without the aid of insulin,
but it too was less effective at processing glucose during the
period of sleep deprivation. This would diminish the functioning of
some areas of the brain and may explain why critical thinking,
memory and mental sharpness are impaired by inadequate sleep.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers also found that blood levels of cortisol, a
measure of stress, were higher in the afternoon and evening in the
sleep-deprived subjects. Such rises in cortisol are typical of the
aging process, and are associated with adverse health effects,
including insulin resistance and memory impairment.
</P>
<P>
   Thyroid hormone levels were also distorted by sleep loss, but
the researchers declined to speculate on the consequences of this
abnormality. They also found evidence of immunological impairment
during the period of shortened nights. The participants were less
responsive to flu vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago team is now conducting further studies of sleep
deprivation in women and older adults. Dr. Van Cauter says she
expects the consequences in older people to be even worse, since
the time spent in deep sleep, the most restful kind, normally
declines drastically with age _ from 100 minutes a night in people
aged 20 to 25 to less than 20 minutes by middle age.
</P>
<P>
   When young people become sleep-deprived, they can make up for
the loss of deep sleep, but older people may not be able to
compensate adequately, she said.
</P>
<P>
   What You Can Do
</P>
<P>
   ``People have to become more reasonable about sleep if they want
to stay healthy,'' Dr. Van Cauter said. She suggests that those who
are cheating on their sleep should ``go to bed one or two hours
earlier'' rather than turn off the morning alarm and arrive late
for work. High school students are among the most sleep-deprived.
``They go to sleep at midnight and get up at 6 a.m. and arrive at
school like zombies,'' Dr. Van Cauter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our society seems to place a moral value on sleeping as little
as possible,'' she noted. ``In Europe, people are less impressed by
short sleepers. Here we're almost embarrassed to say that we are
going to bed early. Saying `I'm tired and I'm going to sleep' is
viewed as being lazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Studies by Dr. David Dinges, sleep researcher at the Institute
of Pennsylvania Hospital and the University of Pennsylvania in
Philadelphia, found that after two weeks of chronic sleep loss,
people may say they have adapted to less sleep and are not sleepy.
But he showed that even those who think they have adapted performed
poorly on tasks that are impaired by fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, there's a disconnect between objective and subjective
sleepiness,'' Dr. Van Cauter said. ``In our study, no one
adapted.''
</P>
<P>
   And in case you think you get more done by sleeping less, a
study of how two adults used the extra time when their sleep was
reduced to five and a half hours a night revealed that they got no
more done: Everything they did took longer.

   When Sleepless Nights Spell Trouble
</P>
<P>
   James Maas, author of ``Power Sleep'' (HarperCollins, 1999),
says an answer of ``true'' to two or more of the following
statements may be signs of a sleep problem.
</P>
<P>
   _ I need an alarm clock in order to wake up at the appropriate
time.
</P>
<P>
   _ It's a struggle for me to get out of bed in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   _ Weekday mornings I hit the snooze button several times to get
more sleep.
</P>
<P>
   _ I feel tired, irritable and stressed out during the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ I have trouble concentrating and remembering.
</P>
<P>
   _ I feel slow with critical thinking, problem-solving and being
creative.
</P>
<P>
   _ I often fall asleep watching television.
</P>
<P>
   _ I often fall asleep after heavy meals or after a low dose of
alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   _ I often fall asleep while relaxing after dinner.
</P>
<P>
   _ I often fall asleep within five minutes of getting into bed.
</P>
<P>
   _ I often feel drowsy while driving.
</P>
<P>
   _ I often sleep extra hours on weekend mornings.
</P>
<P>
   _ I often need a nap to get through the day.
</P>
<P>
   _ I have dark circles around my eyes.

RACIAL BIAS SEEN IN TREATING PATIENTS FOR PAIN 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Black patients with broken arms or legs were less likely to be
given painkillers in an Atlanta emergency room than white patients
with similar injuries and complaints of pain, a new study has
found.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta
examined the charts of 127 black patients and 90 white patients who
were treated by 37 doctors at the hospital, which was not
identified, from 1992 to 1995. They found that 43 percent of black
patients with fractures of the extremities received no pain
medication in the emergency room, while 26 percent of white
patients with similar injuries went untreated for pain. The study
appears in the January issue of The Annals of Emergency Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Because neither doctors nor patients were interviewed, Dr. Knox
H. Todd, an associate professor of emergency medicine at Emory, who
was an author of the study, said the report could offer no
definitive explanation for the disparity.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Lewis R. Goldfrank, the director of emergency services
at Bellevue Hospital Center in Manhattan, said the results spoke
for themselves. ``I think it's racism, flat out,'' he said. ``This
is a critical issue for emergency medicine and medicine in general.
How can we say that we have the best medical care in the world and
at the same time not be able to assure everyone _ with confidence _
that they'll get the same treatment as the next person, regardless
of their skin color? This is a wake-up call to our inability to
understand the needs of diverse groups of people in our society.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar study in Los Angeles, published in The Journal of the
American Medical Association in 1993, found that white patients
with broken bones were 64 percent more likely than Hispanic
patients with similar fractures to receive pain medication in the
emergency room.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more different your cultural background, the more the
disparity in pain treatment is likely to be,'' said Todd, who was
also an author of the JAMA study. Eighty-five percent of all
emergency room doctors in the United States are white, Todd said,
and some might unknowingly empathize with patients of their own
race, and tend to underemphasize the pain of another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although there are cultural differences in pain expression,
these are too often invoked as a cause of differential analgesic
treatment,'' Todd said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Marcus L. Martin, chairman of the emergency department of
the University of Virginia Health System in Charlottesville, Va.,
said that in tolerating and expressing pain, ethnic differences did
exist. But in an editorial accompanying the study, Martin raised
several questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do some patients express pain in a way that is more convincing
that they need medication?'' he asked. ``Do some patients present
in a way that they are viewed as overly dramatic, drug seeking or
for some societal reason not deserving of pain medication? Do
clinicians withhold or deliver inadequate medications on the basis
of personal bias, a subconscious fear of causing addiction, or
practice in a community where it is common for ethnic disparities
in health care to exist?''

NEW GUIDE BY AMA FOCUSES ON DEMENTIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Dementia strikes 4 million Americans every year, according to
the American Medical Association, sapping their memories and their
ability to live independently.
</P>
<P>
   Most commonly a result of Alzheimer's disease, it grows ever
more prevalent as the population grows older: The association says
35 percent to 45 percent of people over 85 have it to at least some
degree.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite its prevalence, dementia can be frustratingly hard
to diagnose. Its symptoms are often confused with those of
depression, delirium, vitamin deficiency or just old age.
</P>
<P>
   Now, to help family doctors and other nonspecialists identify
dementia and help their patients get appropriate treatment, the
medical association has published a booklet, ``Diagnosis,
Management and Treatment of Dementia: A Practical Guide for Primary
Care Physicians.'' Copies, at $5 each or $3 for AMA members, are
available from the association by calling (312) 464-5563.
</P>
<P>
   The 47-page guide includes reference cards to help doctors
perform preliminary diagnoses of suspected dementia. And it
includes information on treatment of cognitive and behavioral
problems, needs of family members, safety, potential for abuse of
people with dementia, community resources and end-of-life concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are different kinds of dementing disorders,'' said Dr.
Rosalie Guttman, a scientist specializing in aging who is an editor
of the guide. ``The symptoms are going to vary. In general, the
most observable signs are memory loss for recent events,
communication problems, word confusion _ the patient uses words
that sound similar but do not quite mean what they want to say. And
because they forget, they repeat questions and say the same things
over and over again.''
</P>
<P>
   Patients and their families need help coping with the insidious
progress of dementia and planning for the future _ making out
wills, for example, and working out power of attorney so patients'
wishes can be respected even after they can no longer voice them.
</P>
<P>
   Guttman noted that forethought could keep patients independent,
minimize the stresses felt by those who care for them, and keep
patients with their families for as long as possible. ``What's
important,'' she said, ``is that families who are confronted with
dementing disorders need all the help and support they can get.''

ZIPPING UP:   A SUBSTITUTE   FOR STITCHES   AND STAPLES 
</HEADLINE>

   When Benjamin Brody awoke from abdominal surgery, he was groggy
and disoriented. As he slid back his surgical gown to take a look
at his new incision, he did not see the usual cross-hatching of
sutures or the minirailroad track of staples. Instead, he saw a
zipper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `Oh, my God, what is this?''' he recalled recently.
``I had never seen anything like it in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitcomb L. Judson, who invented the zipper back in 1893, would
doubtless be surprised to learn that his device had made the leap
to human bodies. Looking like an oversize white gauze bandage, the
surgical zipper is a polyester patch with a polyethylene zipper
running lengthwise down the middle. The underside is coated with a
nontoxic adhesive, like a Band-Aid.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes time to close an incision (the zipper works only
on straight ones), the surgeon peels off the paper strip, exposing
the adhesive, and places one edge on each side of the wound. While
gently pulling up on the tab, the surgeon pulls the zipper shut; as
the zipper comes together, so too do the edges of the skin. The
process takes less than two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Brody, who lives in Brooklyn, says his 6-inch incision has
healed quite well. ``I had surgery on my chest a few years ago and
it was closed with staples, and boy was it painful,'' he said in an
interview. ``With the zipper, I had no pain at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Three hospitals in the United States are using the zipper,
though the manufacturer _ Atrax Medical Group Ltd., based in
Bermuda, which sells it under the brand name Medizip _ says it
plans wider distribution starting next year.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mitchell Roslin, a general surgeon at Maimonides Medical
Center in Brooklyn, who took part in a clinical investigation, says
he has now used it about 70 times, including Brody's operation in
October.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real benefit of these types of products is their
intellectual appeal to the patient,'' Roslin said. ``The patients
really, really love it. Instead of complaining that they are
nauseous or can't eat, they are showing people their zipper
incision. Patients also spend a lot less time agonizing over the
thought of having sutures or staples removed.''
</P>
<P>
   The zipper is generally quicker to apply than sutures or
staples, Roslin says. He adds that it leaves a less disfiguring
scar and can simply be peeled off in the shower after 10 days or
so.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Gregg, 53, a computer systems manager in San Francisco,
recently had quadruple bypass operation in which veins were
harvested from his legs, leaving incisions 12 and 20 inches long.
``I have been sewn, stapled, taped and zippered,'' he said, ``and I
like the zippering method best.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year I had abdominal surgery, and they used tape. It
didn't work very well. I don't think the incision closed properly;
I have a scar that is about three-quarters of an inch wide.''
</P>
<P>
   Rita Altman, a physician assistant who took part in a clinical
trial in San Francisco, says a possible drawback is that the zipper
takes a little practice. ``You might get a surgeon who uses the
zipper and doesn't get it quite right on the first try and
incorrectly assumes that it doesn't work,'' said Ms. Altman, who
now practices in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration says that it recognizes five
methods of closing wounds: suturing, stapling, taping, gluing and
now zippering _ and that others are in the works. ``Over the last
18 months or so, we have seen a variety of wound-closing devices
similar to the zipper, but they use Velcro or lace-close like a
shoe,'' said Jim Dillard of the agency's device-evaluation office.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest innovation in wound closing came last year with
the introduction of a tissue adhesive, Dermabond. This gluing
method is ``revolutionary in managing wounds,'' Dillard said.
</P>
<P>
   The tissue adhesive, 2-octyl cyanoacrylate, is used to repair
low-tension cuts and to close surgical incisions. It reacts with
moisture on the skin surface to form a strong flexible bond. This
method, which is gaining popularity in emergency rooms and plastic
surgery offices, is considered ideal for facial wounds. Children
who typically do not sit well for traditional methods seem to fare
well with gluing, Dillard said.
</P>
<P>
   Methods like gluing and zippering represent a trend toward the
use of sutureless wound closure, said Roslin, of Maimonides. ``I
think that you're going to see more widespread use of surgical
glues and adhesives,'' he said. ``People don't like the idea of
seeing something piercing through the skin; they find it upsetting,
as opposed to, say, a Band-Aid.''

SCIENTISTS BREATHING NEW LIFE INTO GASES LIKE OXYGEN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Italy, Japan)  (The Science Times) 
(DW) 
 By MALCOLM W. BROWNE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When you squeeze things hard enough, or change their
temperatures drastically enough, or both, wondrous changes occur _
seemingly magical transformations that have hooked more than a few
people on the joys of science.
</P>
<P>
   Take oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   We all know that oxygen is a colorless, odorless gas, as
invisible to the eye as it is essential to human respiration. But a
team of physicists at the European Laboratory for Nonlinear
Spectroscopy in Florence, Italy, has reported on a new form of
oxygen called epsilon-phase O4. Wonder of wonders, this stuff _
pure oxygen _ is a blood-red solid!
</P>
<P>
   Exotic substances like epsilon-phase O4 are never easy to make.
In this case, you need two large, gem-quality diamonds with apexes
pointed at each other and nearly touching, and with the space
between them encircled by a metal gasket. This arrangement creates
a tiny sealed chamber in which the pressure rises astronomically
when a vise squeezes the diamonds together.
</P>
<P>
   When a minute puff of oxygen is compressed in this diamond anvil
to a pressure of about 100,000 times that of the atmosphere, red
oxygen materializes. The Italian team believes the material is a
peculiar molecular configuration of oxygen, made of rectangular
units with an oxygen atom at each of the four corners. The ordinary
oxygen in air is a molecule containing two oxygen atoms; another
form, ozone, contains three oxygen atoms.
</P>
<P>
   The higher the pressure goes, the redder it gets _ up to a
point. As the pressure nears 1 million atmospheres, another
astonishing transformation occurs: oxygen becomes a metal; that is,
it becomes capable of conducting electricity.
</P>
<P>
   As if that were not amazing enough, oxygen compressed further
and chilled to near the absolute zero of temperature was shown last
year by a Japanese team to be a superconductor: a substance that
conducts electricity with no resistance.
</P>
<P>
   I remember the thrill as a high school student a half century
ago when I first beheld liquid air pouring into a dish from a kind
of thermos bottle called a Dewar. Ordinary air is invisible, and
this frigid liquid form, tinted a faint blue, seemed like a ghost
materialized from the ether _ a dangerous ghost that boiled
malignantly and swiftly coated its container with thick white
frost.
</P>
<P>
   A rose dipped into this sinister liquid instantly became as
fragile as a Christmas tree ornament, and a rubber ball briefly
immersed in it shattered when dropped.
</P>
<P>
   The founder of modern chemistry, Antoine Laurent Lavoisier, was
fascinated by the notion of liquefied gases, even though he never
saw one _ he died on the guillotine in 1794, before the feat had
been achieved. But according to a recent biography, ``Absolute Zero
and the Conquest of Cold,'' by Tom Schachtman, Lavoisier wrote at
one point, in a prescient surmise, that in very cold regions of the
solar system, ``the water of our rivers and oceans would be changed
into solid mountains. The air, or at least some of its
constituents, would cease to remain an invisible gas and would turn
into the liquid state. A transformation of this kind would thus
produce new liquids of which we as yet have no idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Changes in pressure are important for converting gases into
liquids or solids. One way to make a gas cold enough to liquefy is
to first compress it and then remove the heat created by
compression. After that, when the pressure is quickly released, the
gas instantly cools. Using this and other methods, including the
evaporation and dilution of liquids, physicists have reached
temperatures within one-billionth of a degree above the absolute
zero (which is approximately minus 459.67 degrees on the Fahrenheit
scale).
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all gases, including hydrogen, the lightest and simplest
of all substances, freeze solid well above this temperature. The
sole exception to this rule is helium, which can never freeze solid
at any temperature.
</P>
<P>
   A version of liquid helium that exists at temperatures below
2.17 degrees Celsius above absolute zero does something
astonishing: it becomes a ``superfluid'' that can flow without any
resistance through even the finest hole.
</P>
<P>
   It behaves in strange ways. Superfluid helium contained in a
beaker creeps up the inside of the glass, climbs over the rim,
descends on the outside and drips off the bottom of the container.
It looks like magic.
</P>
<P>
   Liquid helium, moreover, can act as a window into the
microscopic world ruled by the laws of quantum mechanics.
</P>
<P>
   When ordinary liquids are swirled they form a vortex, like that
of water entering a bathtub drain. The more vigorous the swirling,
the more pronounced is the vortex. But superfluid helium is
different.
</P>
<P>
   When it is swirled a little, one vortex forms, but when swirled
a little harder, two vortices abruptly appear, and then three, and
so on. It is a quantum fluid that changes states in sharp quantum
steps rather than in the smooth progression we see in the everyday
world.
</P>
<P>
   Liquid helium is expensive and hard to handle, but dry ice _ the
solid form of carbon dioxide _ is commonly used to ship ice cream,
and can offer some fun. The temperature of a block of dry ice is no
higher than minus 108 degrees Fahrenheit, and when dry ice is
lowered into a beaker of acetone, the acetone is quickly chilled. A
flower dipped into it becomes as brittle as glass, and liquid
mercury becomes a silvery solid hard enough to hammer nails. (But
bear in mind that acetone is a dangerous solvent and mercury is
poisonous.)
</P>
<P>
   People have learned to squeeze things so hard that their
molecular structure changes drastically. In the early 1950s
engineers learned to squeeze graphite hard enough to turn it into
diamond _ mostly in the form of industrial abrasives, but also into
costly gems.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists will probably never attain the kind of pressure that
creates neutron stars, in which atoms are literally crushed to a
matter so dense that just a spoon of it would weigh thousands of
tons, if it could be brought to Earth.
</P>
<P>
   But by firing metal plugs at targets using special gas guns,
scientists have generated brief pulses of enormous pressure _ the
kind of pressure that exists deep in the interior of giant planets
like Jupiter and Saturn. With the help of gas guns, astrophysicists
are deciphering the high-pressure structures of the solar system.
For example, about 90 percent of Jupiter's mass is hydrogen, most
of which is under such enormous pressure that it exists as a liquid
metal. The circulation of this metallic hydrogen is believed to be
the dynamo powering the planet's gigantic magnetic field.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists will never cease pushing the limits of pressure and
temperature they can achieve, because surprises await each advance.
Also, there's nothing so stimulating to the creative juices as
trying to imagine something that no one has ever seen.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Inspired by new findings on the way animal brains develop before
and after birth, scientists are developing provocative new theories
to explain autism, a mysterious brain abnormality that prevents
human infants from developing normal social and cognitive skills.
</P>
<P>
   By studying the anatomy of autistic brains, researchers are
trying to figure out when in development and where in the brain the
complex interaction of genes and environment causes things to go
astray. In the process, they are learning more about the brain
circuitry that gives rise to quintessential human traits like
language, empathy and the awareness that other people have beliefs
and desires different from one's own.
</P>
<P>
   An entire brain circuit has been compromised in autism, said Dr.
David G. Amaral, a neuroscientist at the University of California
at Davis. Researchers have only begun to study how different brain
regions interact dynamically to give rise to such circuits, he
said, which puts autism at the frontier of modern neuroscience.
</P>
<P>
   Autism undermines many aspects of human behavior, including
movement, attention, learning, memory, language, mood and social
interaction. It can be detected in the movements of babies who roll
over, sit up, crawl and walk in oddly uncoordinated ways. At 18
months, an autistic toddler will not point, share attention with
others or follow the expressions of other people. By age 2 or 3,
autistic children display a profound lack of responsiveness to
others. Many do not talk; instead, they may engage in rituals, like
arm flapping, that stimulate their bodies. They dislike change of
any sort.
</P>
<P>
   The symptoms of autism range from mild to severe, making the
true incidence of the disorder difficult to assess, said Dr. Marie
Bristol-Power, who coordinates autism research at the National
Institute of Child Health and Human Development in Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Classical autism in its more severe form, which results in
mental retardation, occurs in about one in every 1,000 births, she
said. When milder forms of autism like Aspberger's syndrome are
included, the incidence is one in 500. The common feature among all
children with autism is a lack of social relatedness.
</P>
<P>
   Some states are reporting what appear to be significant
increases in cases of autism, Dr. Bristol-Power said. But it is not
yet clear if the reports reflect higher incidence of the condition
or better diagnosis and the availability of better treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty years ago, researchers believed that autism was caused by
cold ``refrigerator'' mothers and weak absent fathers. Today they
are zeroing in on genes. In identical twins, if one has autism, the
second will also have it 90 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   At least five or six genes contribute to autism, said Dr.
Bennett Leventhal, director of child and adolescent psychiatry at
the University of Chicago. Studies thus far of autistic siblings
suggest that these genes are on Chromosomes 7, 13 and 15.
</P>
<P>
   What these genes are doing is still anybody's guess. Studies of
developing animal brains have found numerous growth factors and
proteins that guide fetal brain cells into making proper
connections. Other genes make factors that act as master switches,
turning yet other genes on and off at particular points in
development.
</P>
<P>
   Some genes suppress cellular activity while others ramp it up,
setting the correct balance of chemicals involved in transmitting
brain signals. After birth, different genes begin to nurse
connections while others cause cells to die off in a dynamic dance
of growth and pruning.
</P>
<P>
   But the growth and elaboration of the nervous system is a
continuous process and if something goes seriously wrong early on,
all subsequent development may be disturbed. The question is, how
early and where.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Patricia M. Rodier, an embryologist at the University of
Rochester School of Medicine, believes that the brain glitch in
autism occurs between days 20 and 24 of gestation, before a woman
knows she is pregnant. She has evidence that genes involved in
laying down basic body and brain structures, called hox genes, are
mutated in autism.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Margaret L. Bauman, a neurologist at Harvard Medical School,
believes that the defect may occur before the middle of the second
trimester of pregnancy. She bases this theory on her extensive
knowledge of how and when certain circuits are wired. Some cells
can be ``missing'' only if the defect occurs midway in fetal
development, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Eric Courchesne, a neuroscientist at the University of
California at San Diego, said that the problem could just as easily
occur after a baby is born and as the brain continues to develop.
</P>
<P>
   In October, researchers identified the precise genetic defect in
a disorder, Rett's syndrome, that was once commonly misdiagnosed as
autism. Babies are born and develop normally until they are between
about 6 months and 24 months old, when a gene that represses other
genes fails to shut down as it should. As a result, the other genes
do not swing into action and children stop growing, wring their
hands and become mentally retarded. Courchesne and other
researchers believe a similar process may be at work in autism.
</P>
<P>
   Like other brain researchers, scientists who study autism were
startled by recent discoveries that the human brain continues to
make new brain cells _ not just new connections, as was previously
thought _ well into adulthood. In fact, one scientist has evidence
that the number of neurons in the human brain doubles between birth
and 6 years.
</P>
<P>
   If this is true, Courchesne said, the child's brain would be
undergoing a huge amount of construction created by the interplay
of genes and environment. It might be, he said, that disturbances
in this construction give rise to autism.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   This theory is supported, some researchers say, by the fact that
a quarter of autistic children appear normal until age 14-22 months
and then experience the sudden onset of autistic symptoms, said Dr.
Nancy J. Minshew, a psychiatrist at the University of Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   The onset may be caused by a malfunction in one or more genes,
she said. Or it could be set off by something in the environment
interacting with a genetically vulnerable child.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1983, Dr. Bauman and her colleagues have been studying
brain tissue obtained in autopsies from autistic children and
adults. While large areas of the 11 brains they studied look
normal, she said, the brains are generally bigger and heavier than
most. Most important, there are abnormalities in three major
regions that help control social behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Parts of the frontal lobes, which enable decision-making and
planning, are thicker than normal. Cells in the limbic system,
where emotions are processed, are a third smaller than normal and
are found in excessive numbers. The cells are also immature, with
stunted connections. Cells in the cerebellum _ a structure that
helps in making predictions about what will happen next in terms of
movements, thoughts and emotions _ are reduced by 30 percent to 50
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms of autism can be traced to problems in each of these
regions, said Amaral, the neuroscientist at UC-Davis. For example,
neurons in the amygdala respond to faces and the angle of gaze.
Autistic children tend to ignore facial expressions, or at least do
not seem to read them well.
</P>
<P>
   Experiments show that autistic children can use their
cerebellums to shift attention when they are not paying attention
to a particular task. But when they are asked to make a conscious
decision about changing attention, a task that activates their
frontal lobes, they can no longer to do the task, presumably
because a larger circuit is engaged.
</P>
<P>
   Animal studies also shed light on the biology of social behavior
relevant to autism, Amaral said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, monkeys have brain cells that respond to moving
hands and faces but not other moving things. They have cells,
called mirror neurons, that fire when the monkey performs an
action, like gripping a handle bar, but also when the monkey
observes another monkey performing the same action. They have cells
that are activated by sights and sounds generated by others but not
by the same sights and sounds when they are self-generated. Perhaps
the human equivalent of these specialized cells are not functioning
properly in autism.
</P>
<P>
   Experiments conducted on human autistic children suggest that
very specific elements of social behavior are abnormal. For
example, autistic children can use sabotage, but not deception, to
prevent another person from attaining a goal. They can use
communicative gestures, like ``come here,'' to affect another
person's behavior but not expressive gestures, like ``well done,''
to affect another's mental state. They can feel the basic pleasure
in mastering a task but not the pride, said Dr. Chris Frith, a
neuroscientist at University College London in England. An emotion
like pride requires taking into account other people's
expectations, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another set of recent but not yet published experiments shows
that autistic children are bombarded by their own nervous systems,
making them more sensitive to stimuli, not less, said Portia
Iverson, the founder of Cure Autism Now, a parent group based in
Los Angeles, who is an expert on the disorder. ``If you hook a
normal person up to a device that measures arousal and make direct
eye contact,'' she said, ``you'd see maybe four spikes a minute. In
the same setting, the autistic child has a dozen or more spikes per
minute, plus the peaks are extremely high and low, more severe and
erratic. It's like you or I would feel during an earthquake, but
they feel that way all day long,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In normal learning and memory, Ms. Iverson said, people encode
new information about 30 seconds after getting an arousal peak.
``But what if you have six times too many peaks?'' she asked. ``You
might encode enormous amounts of highly irrelevant information,
focusing on details that don't matter to the rest of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Autism researchers agree that it will take many years before the
genetics and neurochemistry of the disorder are understood. In the
meantime, intensive one-on-one therapies that teach children how to
control their movements and interact socially succeed in 30 percent
to 50 percent of treated children, provided they start early,
ideally by age 2 or 3. The goal is to intercept the miswiring of
the autistic brain and, as the brain is developing, help it grow
the connections it needs.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for a great many austistic children, the disorder is not
diagnosed until age 5 or 6, when they start school, Dr.
Bristol-Power said.
</P>
<P>
   Most pediatricians and family doctors still believe that autism
is a relatively rare disorder and are not trained to pick up
symptoms, she said. Any child that is not speaking in short phrases
by age 2 should be evaluated.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Iverson said: ``The fact that children's brains are dynamic
and resilient is our greatest hope. The very essence of a human
being is his or her interaction with the environment. If it's not
done right the first time, we can make it up with restorative and
regenerative therapies for the brain. We may not make kids
completely normal but we can change the course of the illness.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   They come at you from magazine covers and video advertisements
in particular profusion in this season of the New Year's
resolution: the perfect-looking people who promise ``sexy thighs in
six minutes a day'' or ``the body of your dreams.'' It's as easy,
they say, as buying this machine, following that diet or doing
another exercise.
</P>
<P>
   But for anyone alienated by these impossibly hard-bodied role
models, another approach is fast catching on: fitness programs led
by people who need to diet themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Experts in weight control and physical activity say it's about
time. ``The people who need to exercise most are the ones most
reluctant to do so,'' said Dr. Edward McAuley, a professor of
kinesiology at the University of Illinois. ``They are so conscious
of how others perceive them, and they anticipate they will be
judged negatively.''
</P>
<P>
   But by watching others like themselves progress, McAuley said,
people who are overweight or out of shape can gain the confidence
they need to proceed. And by working in groups of three or four, he
added, they share responsibility and support for the well-being of
the others.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best known of these programs is the Chub Club,
started in January by the talk show host Rosie O'Donnell and a
fitness coach, Judy Molnar, who stands 6-foot-1 and weighs 200
pounds. Because these two look no more like supermodels than the
average woman, they are moving many who sat out the fitness
revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``After we did a series of shows about breast cancer last fall,
I got a lot of letters from doctors telling me more people die of
cardiovascular disease than anything else,'' Ms. O'Donnell said in
an interview. ``If you really want to help people, they told me,
you'll try to get them to eat less and move more.''
</P>
<P>
   A veteran of many weight-loss plans, Ms. O'Donnell had no
intention of endorsing any particular diet. Instead, she would urge
her viewers to ``eat less, move more.''
</P>
<P>
   As for a fitness coach, she said, ``I didn't want some Barbie
doll-type saying, `You can do it, you can do it.''' So she hired
Ms. Molnar, who had been a guest on her show.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Judy first came on,'' Ms. O'Donnell said, ``I thought,
`Here's someone who looks like me, looks like our audience.''' Ms.
Molnar's message _ ``If I can get fit, anyone can'' _ resonated
with Ms. O'Donnell and her viewers.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, Ms. Molnar began walking for her health. At the
time, she weighed 300 pounds. ``For the first time in my life,''
she recalled, ``it wasn't about a diet. It wasn't about getting to
a certain body size. It was about my health.''
</P>
<P>
   Gradually her walking routine became a running routine. And
while she was not focused on losing weight, it began to happen,
``one doughnut at a time.'' After a year, she had lost 100 pounds,
and by last October she managed to finish the Hawaii Ironman _ a
2.4-mile swim, a 112-mile bicycle race and a 26-mile run.
</P>
<P>
   When the Chub Club was introduced on Ms. O'Donnell's show in
January, viewers were encouraged to band together with friends to
start their own branches. Clubs sprang up around the country, with
names like the Double Stuffed Oreos, Singing Fatties and Chubby
Charms. Members were urged to train for local five-kilometer
run-walk races, and received monthly newsletters with tips and
motivating messages. Ms. O'Donnell says membership was capped at
300,000 within weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Ann Matteson, a 43-year-old nurse from Coventry, R.I.,
drafted three friends to form the TICU Tootsies. ``The four of us
work the 11 to 7 shift in the trauma intensive-care unit at Rhode
Island Hospital,'' she said. ``Being nurses, we're so focused on
taking really good care of our patients, but we don't take really
good care of ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Matteson, who says she has been overweight her whole life,
has lost more than 20 pounds and says her friends have all lost 15
to 30 pounds. ``It's not a drastic weight loss,'' she said. ``It's
just a little bit at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor does the club demand that members give up their favorite
foods. ``That's unrealistic,'' Ms. Matteson said. But she added
that since she organized her group, ``we do less chocolate and more
angel food cakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kelly Brownell, director of the Yale Center for Eating
Disorders and Weight Control, praises this approach. ``It sounds
like people in the Chub Club are taught to aspire to reasonable
goals, to eat a sensible but balanced diet and to be physically
active in a way they can enjoy and sustain and with some social
support,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he continued, the approach avoids a common
pitfall of diet and exercise programs: unrealistic goals. When you
begin with an unrealistic goal, Brownell explained, falling short
of that goal feels like failure. Instead of congratulating
themselves for the loss of say, 10 pounds, dieters may become
dejected because they have not come closer to an ideal. ``You
become frustrated, resigned and angry,'' he said. ``It sets up
expectations of failure for your next attempt.'' Research has shown
that this mind-set, perversely, leads to weight gain.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Chub Club is not the only program designed by and for the
overweight. A precursor, the New Face of Fitness, was founded eight
years ago by Dee Hakula, then a 350-pound Louisiana housewife who
wanted to spare others the humiliation she went through when she
began going to a gym.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some size 2 instructor was lifting her leg 50 feet in the air
telling me I could do it, when I could barely move,'' she said. It
was a beginners' class, yet she was way out of her league.
</P>
<P>
   Still, determined to be able to keep up with her small children,
Ms. Hakula kept going to the gym. And after dropping 100 pounds,
she became a certified fitness instructor and approached the owner
of her health club about teaching. ``At first he said, `You still
need to lose 100 pounds.' But then he said, `If you get 10 people
together, you can teach a class.'''
</P>
<P>
   She had enough clients for 10 classes, and has since won a
fitness innovation grant from Nike to spread her program.
</P>
<P>
   After the Chub Club was founded in January, its most famous
member said, she had to endure a six-month struggle with her own
philosophy of ``eat less, move more.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I started to feel imprisoned by my own comments,'' Ms.
O'Donnell said. ``I was really stressed and angry that all these
people were watching me and I had committed to doing this 5K.''
</P>
<P>
   The turning point in her own struggle came last June in Central
Park. It was a chilly, rainy Sunday morning, and tens of thousands
of people had come to watch the last in the series of Chub Club
five-kilometer events. Fans grabbed for the star as though her
touch would cure.
</P>
<P>
   One after another, Chub Clubbers approached Ms. O'Donnell to
thank her for changing their lives. ``It was really overwhelming,''
she said. ``Meanwhile, someone asked me if I had gained weight.
When the Chub Club started, I weighed 208. When I got on the scale
in June I weighed 216. I was shocked: It was the most I ever
weighed.'' It is all too easy, she said, to become disassociated
with your body when you are overweight.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people told me I inspired them,'' she said. ``Well, they
inspired me.'' Over the summer Ms. O'Donnell decided she owed it to
herself to get fit. As she put it, ``After a lot of soul searching,
I said, I'm going to take care of myself as if I'm one of my own
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' she said, ``I eat more sensibly. I get on the treadmill
at home five days a week, and I get a lot of physical activity with
the kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Since June, as she recently told her audience, she has lost 28
pounds.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Brownell, of Yale, says Ms. O'Donnell's openness about her
weight and her struggle with it can help other overweight people.
``There is some research that shows having a role model who
struggles with a goal, can, in fact, be even more positive when you
are dealing with setbacks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Barker, a 25-year-old nanny from Nashville, Tenn., who
organized a Chub Club with three friends who are stay-at-home
mothers, agrees. ``Rosie was never secretive about her weight, and
watching her through her quote-unquote `failures' really helped
me,'' she said. ``I used to always lie about how much I weighed,
but now I'm not ashamed to say I weigh 200 pounds, and that makes a
huge difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. O'Donnell says she always hoped her viewers would feel that
way. ``I just wanted people with weight issues to be treated with
dignity,'' she said. As for Ms. O'Donnell, she is now at her
thinnest in three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have more energy, and I feel better,'' she said. ``It's not
that I feel good about my body, it's just that I don't feel as
badly.''

&HT;     BARBARA BUSH'S TRIAL BALLOON 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARIANNE MEANS  
 &HT;     c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Bush family has put popular Barbara Bush, who
carefully cultivated an image of nonpartisan grandmotherhood while
in the White House, on one of her son George W.'s toughest
political cases.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month she launched an effort in a television
interview to banish or at least modify the odious Republican
platform plank that would criminalize all abortions, even those
that doctors believe are necessary to protect the life of the
mother. The 20-year-old official GOP stance that saving a fetus is
more important than protecting the health of a living, breathing
woman is an embarassment to the party and has been a drag on its
recent presidential nominees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in states' rights and I don't think it should be in
a national platform,'' the mother of the GOP presidential
frontrunner said. ``There's nothing a president can do about it
anyway, in all honesty.''
</P>
<P>
   The former first lady was indulging in devious Clinton-speak
there, technically sticking to the truth but in reality
oversimplifying things to distort the facts and create a false
impression.
</P>
<P>
   What sounded at first like a bold digression from Republican
orthodoxy was not really a change of heart but a shift to a kinder,
gentler rhetoric aimed at a similar outcome. She was doing her son
a favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``States rights,'' with its conservative anti-federalism ring,
is consistent with support for overthrowing the Supreme Court
decision granting abortion limited constitutional protection. If
the court reverses itself, the issue would automatically become
fodder for the state legislatures. Before the landmark 1973 Roe v.
Wade ruling, 45 states had laws forbidding or heavily restricting
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   And there are obvious, although indirect, things a president can
do about abortion rights. He gets to pick Supreme Court justices.
If he plops anti-abortion judges onto the present divided court, he
can tip the balance. George W. Bush has refused to specifically
promise to name anti-abortion judges, but he has also said he would
pick those who agree philosophically with him. Since he insists he
is anti-abortion, that in his case amounts to the same thing as a
litmus test on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   As president, he could also veto congressional laws that don't
suit him on abortion issues, as President Clinton has done. He
could use his bully pulpit to influence public opinion. As Bush
himself has said, ``An administration can change the tone in
Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Bush's pragmatic purpose in floating her trial balloon
is clear _ to wage war against a draconian platform plank sure to
give her son headaches in a general election in which he needs to
attract female votes. Despite her public image, she is politically
savvy.
</P>
<P>
   This move represents a political judgment about the temper of
the times, not a weakening of the family's anti-abortion views.
</P>
<P>
   As governor of Texas, George W. signed 18 provisions in bills
designed to reduce abortion and birth control. He supports a
constitutional amendment to bar the procedure except in cases of
rape or incest or to save the life of the mother. ``I'm going to
set a goal that says the unborn ought to be protected in law,'' he
promises.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some short-term legislation that a president can do. A
president can sign a partial-birth abortion ban. I would do so
quickly if one got to my desk,'' he says. Asked which Supreme Court
justice he most respects, Bush named Antonin Scalia, the most
rigidly anti-abortion jurist on the high bench.
</P>
<P>
   Every Republican presidential candidate opposes abortion. It is
considered necessary to win the GOP primaries, which are dominated
by religious fundamentalists and social conservatives. But there is
little public support in the country for returning to the
back-alley days of illegal abortions and sending women and their
doctors to jail. Most voters want abortion to be rare but not
outlawed.
</P>
<P>
   To appeal across party lines, a Republican presidential
candidate opposing abortion cannot thrust his view in the face of
voters who disagree by making it his primary objective (which rules
out Gary Bauer). And nothing would make a candidate appear to be an
extremist as much as advocating that outrageous platform plank.
</P>
<P>
   Getting rid of it would be a good move toward the moderate
middle. Bob Dole, the 1996 nominee, tried to modify the plank's
harsh language but was thwarted by anti-abortion activists. The
hapless Dole simply ignored the whole platform as meaningless. He
lost anyway.
</P>
<P>
   There are some early signs that anti-abortion radicals may be
losing some clout within the GOP. Arizona Sen. John McCain, Bush's
chief rival, has also been searching for ways to downplay his
anti-abortion stance by shifting emphasis elsewhere without
actually changing his tune. And some influential Christian
activists within the party seem more interested in winning the
White House than demanding continuing purity on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   It will still be a struggle for Bush to shake loose from the
vote-losing stranglehold of the pro-plank crowd. But he has sent
out his ``best man'' to make the start, his mother.

FOR AULD LANG SHAME: FIRMS TRY TO EASE PAIN OF WORKING ON BIG
NIGHT 

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ It's bad enough to forfeit a New Year's Eve for your
job, but it's really tough to have to clock in on what has been
billed as the party night of the century.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, many companies are doing what they can to make the
situation more palatable for the employees who have to come in to
work.
</P>
<P>
   Most companies have a festive presentation of food planned. Some
are drawing names for trips and other luxurious prizes or paying
bonuses. And some confident companies that aren't expecting any
problems plan a weekend extravaganza of movies.
</P>
<P>
   A few companies, however, are playing Scrooge and trying to
avoid paying a New Year's Eve premium if employees are regularly
scheduled to work on Fridays. Other employers are suddenly getting
nervous as the minutes count down and quickly assigning more
employees to work the big one.
</P>
<P>
   For the pilots, flight attendants, technology specialists and
others who have to work on New Year's Eve and New Year's Day,
Houston-based Continental Airlines will draw 57 names each day. The
lucky 114 will win $2,000 each, said spokeswoman Catherine Stengel.
</P>
<P>
   Flight attendants and pilots also can bring two buddies with
them if they have to fly on New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   It's a way the airline can say, ``Thank you,'' Stengel said. It
also is something the airline can do because demand for seats is
lower than normal. Continental has cut its New Year's Eve flights
by 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   There is one catch: Buddies and employees have to fly to the
same place. The buddy can't take off to Hawaii while the friend is
on the Midland-Odessa (Texas) route.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to go together,'' Stengel said.
</P>
<P>
   To make the big night easier for its employees in Houston, BMC
Software will host a roast beef dinner followed by a screening of
the movie, aptly named, ``Entrapment,'' with Sean Connery.
</P>
<P>
   Children _ the whole family is invited _ can eat chicken nuggets
and watch kiddie flicks in another screening room.
</P>
<P>
   The software development firm isn't expecting any problems but
will have employees in 25 company locations around the globe, said
Betty Otter-Nickerson, vice president of product management and
development in Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The parties won't be as spectacular in some of the offices like
Singapore, which will have only two employees working, she said.
But they will get a party bag like everyone else, which includes a
top hat, calendar, candy, noisemakers and confetti.
</P>
<P>
   And everyone who is required to work _ Otter-Nickerson expects
several employees to show up to ring in the new year out of
curiosity _ is eligible to win a trip. A lucky U.S. employee will
get to go to Napa Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The company will also draw names for door prizes such as Palm
Pilots, handheld electronic organizers. All employees who work will
receive a bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's another way to make it more fun and exciting,'' said
Otter-Nickerson.
</P>
<P>
   BMC is hoping those inducements will make it easier for its
employees in Australia to pass up lucrative offers to work as
bartenders the night of Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently a big party is planned in Melbourne, said
Otter-Nickerson, and restaurants are paying any warm body who can
pour liquor $5,000 for the night.
</P>
<P>
   St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital in Houston is requiring people who
would normally be on call to be at the hospital in case of a
breakdown in communications or transportation, but they won't have
jobs to do if everything goes smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   So the hospital will try to keep its employees happy with a disc
jockey from 9 p.m. to 1 a.m. in the hospital cafeteria. The
hospital plans a festive spread of hors d'oeuvres and maybe pizza
for the folks who have to burn the midnight oil on New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   Family members are welcome, family-oriented movies will be shown
and there will be board games set up. For the folks anchored to the
hospital floors, plates of cookies and pitchers of cider will be
taken around.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping to make it as festive as possible for people who
would rather be someplace else,'' said Caresse Young,
administrative director for human resources.
</P>
<P>
   Reliant Energy will have about 1,600 people working in Houston
on New Year's Eve. But there aren't any big parties planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have a little more of a festive atmosphere,'' said
spokeswoman Sandy Fruhman. Employees will get a little party bag
when they arrive that includes a lei and a bottle of water. Food
will be available, but no pig roasts or lobster boils.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're expecting them to be bored,'' she said, adding that the
company needed extra people on hand.
</P>
<P>
   Though some companies are inviting employees to bring their
children to work, others are not, presenting a bit of a child-care
problem for many. Many baby sitters were booked months ago, and
some are charging premium rates.
</P>
<P>
   Bright Horizons Family Solutions, a corporate child-care
provider based in Cambridge, Mass., is providing around-the-clock
child care for about a dozen clients nationwide, including Chase
Manhattan Bank, America Online and several hospitals and technology
companies. Bright Horizons has a contract to provide back-up child
care with Chase around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the companies already have on-site child care. But at
those that don't, Bright Horizons will make do, turning conference
rooms and the like into child-care centers.
</P>
<P>
   There will be cribs for infants and cots for the older children
who will, hopefully, nod off after eating ice cream sundaes,
chomping popcorn and munching pizza.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a real slumber party,'' said Ilene Hoffer, director
of public relations for Bright Horizons.

 &HT;    Magazines take last looks at 1999
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The final end-of-the-year issues hit the stands this week with
Time's ($3.95) Person of the Century (Albert Einstein), U.S. News &AMP;
World Report's ($3.95) pictorial reflections on the last 12 months
and US ($3) magazine's top stories of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Person of the Century package, Time offers an
interesting list of the most important people of the millennium,
starting with William the Conqueror in the 11th century. Others,
century by century, include Kurdish adventurer Saladin; Mongol
leader Genghis Khan; medieval artist Giotto; printing press
inventor Johann Gutenberg; Queen Elizabeth I; Isaac Newton; Thomas
Jefferson; and Thomas Edison.
</P>
<P>
   In the world of celebrities, US listed the top 99 stories, from
the deaths of John Kennedy Jr. and Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, to the
Latin music explosion. Most overplayed stories of the year,
according to a poll of US readers, were Monica Lewinsky, the JFK
Jr. plane crash, the Y2K bug and ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The
Phantom Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  History in a nutshell: The January issue of National
Geographic ($3.95) is basically a time capsule of the millennium.
The cover of the magazine is a stylized tilting of National
Geographic's logo imposed on a deep-space image made by the Hubble
Space Telescope, symbolizing humankind racing into an exciting
future. Inside, foldout pages of photographs celebrate the Earth
from mist-wreathed Chinese mountains to the Saudi desert. Articles
touch on subjects from standards of beauty to undersea life.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most compelling essay is ``Rediscovering America,''
in which British-born author Tim Brookes hitchhiked across the
United States in search of his own American dream. Along the way,
Brookes encountered everyone from Elvis impersonators to Ramblin'
Jack Elliott, the singer who inspired Bob Dylan and other folk
musicians.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Spoiled sports: Those who think sports are just games haven't
been keeping up with the times. Utne Reader ($4.99) reports that
the loud noise you hear is not cheering, but the clang of cash
registers drowning out the thrill of victory. Writer Jay Weiner
proposes banning athletic scholarships in favor of financial aid
based on need, public ownership of professional teams and making
ticket prices affordable.
</P>
<P>
   In related articles, Susan Faludi, author of ``Stiffed,'' traces
the demise of the ``true'' sports fan; Maria Guhde Keri criticizes
domineering parents who ruin sports for their kids; and University
of Minnesota researcher Mary Jo Kane argues for more publicity _
and more funding _ for women's sports.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Trimming the fat: Once the worries about Y2K have been put to
rest, Americans' next big concern is how to shed the extra pounds
acquired during the holidays. Before you choose a diet, Women's
Sports &AMP; Fitness ($2.50) suggests you read a new study that reveals
that exercise, not dieting, is the most effective way to lose
weight. An added bonus: Recent studies also show that exercise can
slow and, in some cases, reverse the aging process.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Exercise spinoff: The publishers of Muscle &AMP; Fitness are
launching Muscle &AMP; Fitness Hers ($3) this month for women who want
to spend more time in the gym. ``The number of women in the weight
room has increased by nearly 200 percent over the last 10 years,''
says editorial director Thomas C. Deters, ``so we know women are
thirsty for the kind of information Hers delivers.'' The premiere
issue includes training tips from fitness competitors, nutrition
advice and articles on fashion, cross-training gear and low-fat
recipes.

 &HT;    Internet site of the week: Internet Drug Index
 &HT;    By M.A.J. McKenna
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You know why your doctor prescribed the drug. You know what's on
the list of warnings the pharmacist gave you. But reactions to
drugs can differ by individual. What can you actually expect when
you start taking it?
</P>
<P>
   No one can guarantee how you'll react to a drug, but the
Internet Drug Index (www.rxlist.com) can help. Among the features
of this longstanding site is RxBoard, a set of bulletin boards
where people trade descriptions of their experiences with the 20
drugs most frequently prescribed in the United States, as well as
some alternative medications. Among the entries: arguments over
whether Prozac causes weight gain, testimonials to the new
painkiller Celebrex, and a report of fever and headache after
taking ginkgo biloba.
</P>
<P>
   The site was created as a public service by a pharmacist named
Neil Sandow. Recently it began being hosted by HealthCentral, a
medical-themed Internet portal that, like many medical gateways
these days, includes a link to an online pharmacy. As with all
sites on the Net, exercise caution and judgment.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two centuries ago, an engineer with Napoleon's army in Egypt
snatched intellectual triumph from the jaws of military defeat by
discovering the Rosetta Stone. This marked the start of scientific
Egyptology, a field that, more than ever, is bursting with
discoveries and new ideas about one of the most splendid and
durable civilizations in the ancient world.
</P>
<P>
   Napoleon had landed in the Nile delta the year before, 1798,
with plans to seize Egypt and disrupt the overland link in
Britain's vital trade route to India. ``Soldiers, 40 centuries are
looking down on you,'' Napoleon reminded his troops before leading
them to battle within sight of the pyramids of Giza. His army
prevailed over the Egyptians, but 10 days later the French fleet
was destroyed by Adm. Horatio Nelson, ending Bonaparte's dream of
further conquest.
</P>
<P>
   Of surpassing importance to the scholarship of antiquity,
however, Napoleon brought with him a corps of some 150 scientists,
geographers and linguists from among the best minds of France, an
expression of the Enlightenment in the midst of imperial
adventurism. Over several decades, they described and classified
all they learned from the ruins of ancient Egypt, including the
especially rewarding Rosetta Stone.
</P>
<P>
   Inscriptions on the slab of dark basalt found in the summer of
1799 at the site of ancient Rosetta, near Alexandria, were the key
to deciphering hieroglyphics, the formal and ceremonial language of
the pharaohs. Scholars could then read the writings on the walls of
tombs and temples and on the rolls of moldering papyrus. Opened to
them for the first time was more than 3,000 years of the history
and religion behind the monumental ruins along the Nile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two hundred years later, we can read ancient Egyptian almost
as well as any other foreign language,'' said Dr. James P. Allen, a
curator of Egyptian art and specialist in the culture's language
and religion at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no other branch of archaeology has fascinated the
general public longer and more deeply. Tourists flock to the
massive pyramids outside Cairo and the temple ruins of Thebes up
the Nile. At museums people stand in awe before the graceful form
of Nefertiti and all the mummies carefully prepared long ago for
the afterlife.
</P>
<P>
   Two major new exhibitions of Egyptian art and artifacts, at the
Metropolitan Museum and the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, are
drawing large crowds.
</P>
<P>
   After a thorough cleaning, the Rosetta Stone itself went back on
display last summer at the British Museum. True to the axiom of
warfare that to the victor go the spoils, the jewel of the French
campaign in Egypt ended up in London.
</P>
<P>
   What is even more remarkable, scholars say, the prodigious
explorations of the last two centuries have only whetted public and
professional appetites, making Egyptology one of the most robust
endeavors of archaeologists.
</P>
<P>
   New discoveries have pushed back the beginnings of Egyptian
history. New interpretations of earlier findings have refined
thinking about the lives of pharaohs and their subjects, the
origins and richness of the language and the philosophy of life and
death that inspired the pyramids. Yet mysteries abound, driving
further searches among the ruins.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a growth field,'' said Dr. Emily Teeter, a curator of
Egyptology at the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago.
``Each year there are probably four or five very significant
discoveries. And there's so much material that has been excavated
in the past but has not been studied.''
</P>
<P>
   This year has been especially rich in discoveries:
</P>
<P>
   _ In the desert west of the Nile, between Thebes and Abydos,
archaeologists from Yale found inscriptions that they say are the
earliest known examples of alphabetic writing. Dated to somewhere
between 1900 and 1800 B.C., two or three centuries earlier than
previously recognized examples of uses of an alphabet, the writing
is in a Semitic script with Egyptian influences.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the ruins of a 3,700-year-old town near Abydos, excavators
from the University of Pennsylvania uncovered a mayor's mansion.
Its grandeur suggested that at the time mayors enjoyed significant
affluence and political power, in some cases as much as a reigning
pharaoh, and may also have supervised religious activities.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the silt of Alexandria harbor, French underwater
archaeologists found numerous fallen stone columns, statues,
sphinxes and masonry blocks with hieroglyphic and Greek
inscriptions. Judging by the location, archaeologists said these
could be remains of Cleopatra's palace in the last century B.C. Her
suicide, immortalized by Shakespeare, was a dramatic stroke in
transforming a declining Egypt into a province of the Roman Empire.
</P>
<P>
   _ In another exploration into the Roman period, Egyptian
archaeologists made what they said was one of the most spectacular
discoveries in recent decades. At the Bahariya oasis 230 miles
southwest of Cairo, they found a cemetery of buried tombs extending
over two square miles. In the first four tombs examined, they
counted 105 mummies decorated with elaborate masks and waistcoats
covered in gold. As many as 10,000 mummies may yet be uncovered in
the place archaeologists are calling the Valley of the Golden
Mummies.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, Dr. Kent R. Weeks of the American University of
Cairo continued exploring the dark interior of the huge tomb for
most of the 52 sons of Ramses II, one of the most powerful pharaohs
who reigned in the 13th century B.C. At the time of its discovery
in 1995 in the Valley of the Kings, the tomb was hailed as the
greatest royal find since Howard Carter in 1922 came upon the
treasures of Tutankhamen, the young King Tut.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mark Lehner of the University of Chicago kept digging in the
quarters inhabited by workers who built the pyramids at Giza, which
are the last survivors of the so-called Seven Wonders of the
Ancient World. ``For those who claim spacemen built the pyramids,
we can point to these workers' villages,'' Dr. Teeter said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Barry Kemp of Cambridge University in England excavated more
sections of Amarna, site of the capital of Akhenaten and Nefertiti
in the 14th century B.C., a revolutionary interlude for Egyptian
sculpture and religion.
</P>
<P>
   At Abydos, 250 miles south of Cairo, Dr. Gunter Dreyer, director
of the German Archaeological Institute in Egypt, continued research
that uncovered evidence of Egyptian kings preceding by two or three
centuries the usual date, 3000 B.C., for the start of the early
dynastic period.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago he reported finding hieroglyphic inscriptions on pots
and bone that were made as early as 3200 B.C., possibly 3400.
Although controversial, the inscriptions suggested that writing
first appeared in Egypt, not in Mesopotamia, the valley of the
Tigris and Euphrates rivers in what is now Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scale of individual excavations today is small, compared
to the early expeditions, but the number is larger than ever
before,'' said Dr. Rita Freed, curator of ancient Egyptian and Near
Eastern art at the Museum of Art in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason to excavate now is not so much to find beautiful
museum pieces but to answer questions, and they're different
questions compared to those of early generations,'' she said.
``They are more about the institutions surrounding the temples, and
how the people lived. We know about pharaohs but not a whole lot
about what you might call the man in the street.''
</P>
<P>
   The Metropolitan Museum's current exhibition, ``Egyptian Art in
the Age of the Pyramids,'' covers a period of some 500 years, from
about 2650 B.C. to 2150 B.C., which ranks as one of the world's
most creative epochs.
</P>
<P>
   For reasons still not clearly understood, rulers of the Old
Kingdom, as the period is called, forged a powerful state and
brought people of diverse regions together through a shared
national consciousness. They left a stunning physical legacy in the
pyramids, the enigmatic Sphinx and statues and other works of art
that would define Egyptian culture for centuries to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``Egyptians were probably the first to be aware of the nobility
inherent in the human form and to express it in art,'' Heinrich
Schaefer, a German art historian, wrote in 1919.
</P>
<P>
   Strolling through the gallery at the Metropolitan, Allen came to
an almost life-size statue of Sepa, a man wearing a kilt and
holding a staff. It is one of the earliest known examples of large
Egyptian nonroyal statuary and is evocative of what was happening
in this creative period. ``This is Egypt emerging from a
two-dimensional background, all flat and obscure, into something
that stands out in three dimensions,'' Allen said.
</P>
<P>
   A significant shift in understanding ancient Egypt began about
50 years ago, Allen said, with new interpretations of ancient texts
by Henri Frankfort and John Wilson of the University of Chicago.
Until then, scholars tended to see everything with Western eyes,
often concentrating on what Egypt could tell them about the Bible.
A deeper understanding of the nuances of the texts has given
scholars a more Egyptian view of the culture.
</P>
<P>
   In previous translations, for example, the word ``ka'' was
thought to mean soul or spirit, which has strong Western
theological connotations. Now it is understood, Allen said, to mean
``life force'' or ``life energy,'' the difference between the
living and the dead.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars think these and other interpretive changes are giving
them a truer understanding of the Egyptian concept of the afterlife
and the metaphorical writings about creation and the cosmos, a way
of explaining how everything came from a single source that in some
way resembles the Big Bang.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition at the Boston museum, ``Pharaohs of the Sun:
Akhenaten, Nefertiti, Tutankhamen,'' concentrates on another period
of political change and artistic creativity. In the 14th century
B.C., the pharaoh who became known as Akhenaten assumed the throne
and broke with past ideologies, notably the religion of many gods.
</P>
<P>
   Shrines and other evidence indicate that most of the people in
their homes continued to worship their several gods, but in
official art, the only god depicted was Aten, and in the temples
the liturgy included ``The Great Hymn to Aten.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Akhenaten was the world's first monotheist is still
debated, Dr. Freed said, but it was clear that he tried to change
Egyptian religion to a belief in one god who was an all-powerful
creator. This god was worshipped through the pharaoh and his chief
wife, Nefertiti, who seemed to share her husband's power. The
reforms of Akhenaten's 17-year reign came to an end during the time
of Tutankhamen, and Egypt returned to most of its old ways.
</P>
<P>
   In the exhibition catalog, Dr. Freed observed, referring to the
seat of Akhenaten's reign, ``In many respects, Amarna is still with
us today: in the concept of a single god, man's intimacy with his
deity, naturalistic expression in art, and the ability of a single
individual to dramatically influence the lives of so many.''
</P>
<P>
   The many unanswered questions and the expectations of new
discoveries may drive archaeologists, but why the unending popular
fascination with ancient Egypt, ever since the discovery of the
Rosetta Stone?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is the mummies. ``Most of us got interested in Egypt
at a young age by being taken to museums to see the mummies,'' Dr.
Freed said. ``Young children discover mummies at the time they are
beginning to comprehend death.''
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps it was the civilization's grandeur and gold, its
romance and intrigue, its imperial ambitions and vaulting hubris.
``For a lot of people,'' Allen said, ``the big fascination about
ancient Egypt is the amazement of discovering how some of their
thought processes were so very much like those with which we are
familiar today.''
</P>
<P>
   The grand architecture surely is a factor. Unlike the rival
Sumerians and Assyrians, who had little stone to work with, the
pharaohs commanded the erection of awesome temples and tombs meant
to last the eternity of their anticipated afterlives. The Great
Pyramid of Khufu, which overshadowed Napoleon's troops, rose 482
feet and was the world's tallest structure until the Eiffel Tower,
completed in 1889.
</P>
<P>
   ``We as modern people believe in progress, of things getting
better and more sophisticated as time moves forward,'' Dr. Teeter
said. ``So it's with a sense of awe and curiosity that we think
about why and how people in antiquity built such things so long ago
without the tools we have. We wonder if the Egyptians had some
knowledge lost to us today.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Light snow will spread southeastward from the central Great
Lakes into the northern Ohio Valley and parts of western
Pennsylvania and New York. Most sections will receive 1 to 2 inches
of fluffy snow, but a few narrow bands east of the lakes may get
over 6 inches. The producer of the wintry weather is a strong
disturbance located near Lake Huron. It will force slightly milder,
moist air to be lifted over a gelid air mass covering the
Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Winds will slacken and some sunshine will be noticed east of the
Appalachians from Virginia to Massachusetts. Skies may stay sunny
much of the day in eastern New England. The fronts will pass across
the Northeast on Tuesday night, perhaps bringing flurries and maybe
a coating of snow to some spots between Washington and Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Cooler air will return to the Southeast. Clouds attendant to the
subtropical branch of the jet stream may bring scattered showers to
southern Florida. A large disturbance approaching Baja California
will send clouds into parts of the Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   Despite persistent winds from the northwest, much warmer air
will make steady progress across the Plains. Record warmth is
expected from Nebraska to the Texas panhandle. High pressure
stalled over Idaho will keep low clouds and polluted air trapped
over the valleys of the interior West.
</P>
<P>
   A strengthening offshore flow in northern California should keep
ocean fog out to sea. Except for valley fog, the coastal Northwest
will stay unusually mild and dry. The Southwest will remain warm
and sunny.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Not Good Air
</P>
<P>
   It has never been hotter at Christmas time than it was this year
in Buenos Aires, Argentina. On Saturday, the temperature rose to 90
degrees. By Sunday, readings soared to 104 degrees, establishing a
new record for the month and tying the highest temperature set in
the city. Usually, the mercury reaches the lower 80s in late
December. Sultry air arrived from Brazil at the start of the
weekend. On Sunday, a torrid wind from the west developed which
forced very warm air down the east slopes of the Andes across the
Pampas to the Atlantic Coast. A cold front triggered a cooling
thundershower Monday.

   BERKELEY, Calif. _ The Internet, which is touted by some as an
invaluable learning tool, is also becoming a breeding ground for
cheaters who mine the computer network for term papers.
</P>
<P>
   Now, thanks to a former teaching assistant at the University of
California at Berkeley, there is a new weapon to catch students who
would rather surf the Web for a paper than write their own.
</P>
<P>
   John Barrie, a doctoral candidate in neurobiology UC-Berkeley,
launched an on-line service _ Plagiarism.org _ for professors and
instructors suspicious of their students' work.
</P>
<P>
   Barrie, 31, and his team of computer specialists, mathematicians
and statisticians, have created a new way to catch what he calls
thieves of intellectual property.
</P>
<P>
   This is how Plagiarism.org works:
</P>
<P>
   Teachers ask their students to turn in their work on an Internet
site set up for each of their classes. The papers are
cross-referenced in Barrie's database of more than 100,000 written
works he has gathered from universities across the nation. The
system also checks the Internet, making sure key phrases, sentences
or paragraphs are not simply lifted from another source.
</P>
<P>
   An electronic copy of the paper then is sent to the instructor
with questionable content underlined and highlighted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't make the determination on whether someone has
plagiarized. The instructor has to look at those reports and make
that determination. All we do is bring information to the table,''
Barrie said.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for such a service came up while Barrie was working as
a teaching assistant at Berkeley. He set up a Web page where his
students would post their work for peer review.
</P>
<P>
   The project was a success until he began hearing rumors about
those papers cropping up in other classes under different names.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students were turning each other in. Many of these students
are getting ready to go off to medical schools, and seeing students
cheat'' made some of the other students angry, Barrie said.
</P>
<P>
   While cheating on college campuses is not exactly news to
educators, one student-conduct official at UC-Berkeley sees a
correlation between the increased rate of cheaters and increased
use of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The number of cheaters grew by more than 100 percent since 1994,
about the same time the Internet started taking off, said Shawn
Decker, a UC-Berkeley student-conduct officer.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1994-95 school year, his office had 66 cases of academic
dishonesty, with about one-fourth of those being plagiarism.
</P>
<P>
   By 1997-98, the figure jumped to 140, with about the same
percentage of plagiarism.
</P>
<P>
   With the use of Barrie's Plagiarism.org, Decker believes the
number of students caught would go through the roof.
</P>
<P>
   UC-Berkeley is in final negotiations with Plagiarism.org, and
Decker expects the university to have full service by this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've given universities an answer to the problems of the
Internet,'' Decker said. ``I think any university that wants to
maintain their integrity, they would have to use services like
Plagiarism.org.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 300 schools ranging from high schools to universities
across the United States and abroad have contacted the
Berkeley-based group.
</P>
<P>
   As long as there are cheaters, Barrie figures his business will
take off without a hitch. The charge is $1 per paper for
participating schools.

 &HT;    Y2K CZAR REPORTS NO PANIC AS NEW YEAR LOOMS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - A year ago, many feared this would be a week of
panic as Americans stockpiled groceries and greenbacks in
anticipation of Y2K-related computer crashes.
</P>
<P>
   But with the year 2000 just days away, government officials have
no reports of bank runs, stock market crashes or other kinds of
fearful behavior in the United States or elsewhere, said John
Koskinen, who chairs the President's Council on Year 2000
Conversion.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no indication so far'' that people are panicking, or
that serious computer problems are developing, he said Monday at
the federal Y2K Information Coordination Center, located just
blocks from the White House. While some computer errors have turned
up already in businesses and government agencies, they were ``all
quickly remedied,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The fear has been that vital computerized equipment would break
down because of the so-called ``Y2K bug,'' a software flaw that
could cause some older computers to misunderstand the date rollover
to 2000 at 12:01 a.m. Saturday. Between the 1960s and 1980s, many
computers were programmed to read only the last two digits of the
year. So it's possible ``00'' will be misread as 1900, triggering
computer malfunctions.
</P>
<P>
   For the past two years, business and government officials have
been attacking the most dangerous bugs. Today, the remaining ones
seem to involve printing mistakes, not system breakdowns, Koskinen
said. For example, this past fall in Maine, the state agency that
issues titles sent letters to owners of 2000 model cars and trucks
identifying their vehicles as ``horseless carriages,'' the
designation used for vintage vehicles produced before 1916. The
error was quickly caught and fixed, Koskinen said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the good news so far, Koskinen's office will begin
monitoring Y2K bugs 24 hours a day, starting Thursday and
continuing into early January. The Information Coordination Center,
which cost taxpayers about $50 million to build and operate, will
gather information from U.S. embassies and military bases
worldwide. It also will communicate with state and federal
agencies, emergency-relief organizations and industry trade groups
to pull together data concerning Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen said about 700 reporters and camera operators,
representing about 75 news organizations, have requested
credentials to report from the center. Beginning at noon Friday and
running through Monday evening, regular press briefings will be
held.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen warned that reporters in Washington may become
frustrated because TV stations around the world will be ``reporting
incidents as they happen'' without evaluating whether they are true
or significant.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Information Coordination Center will be taking
its time to check facts from ``multiple sets of sources,'' he said.
``Our goal is accuracy,'' he said, not making deadlines.

 By ALISHA BERGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Marseille, France, some vending machines dispense neither
soda nor candy but free sterile needles for drug users. In
Vancouver, British Columbia, a stack of colorful coupons sits next
to the register at a local drugstore, offering 10 percent off on
condoms.
</P>
<P>
   Both programs aim to block the spread of infectious diseases,
especially AIDS, by making preventive tools available to people who
might be reluctant to seek them out in clinics or doctors' offices.
And two studies in the December issue of The American Journal of
Public Health suggest that they are working.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at INSERM, the French equivalent of the National
Institutes of Health, and Johns Hopkins University looked at where
drug users in Marseille got needles. The local government makes
sterile needles available at drugstores, needle exchanges and
vending machines; in the survey, conducted in 1997, questionnaires
were handed out to 486 people getting needles at all three kinds of
sites, and 343 were completed.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found that people who used the vending machines
tended to be younger drug users who were less likely than others to
be infected with HIV or hepatitis, making them an important group
to catch before becoming infected. Needle exchanges drew in more
experienced users, while pharmacies served older users, but neither
tended to attract the youngest group with the highest risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think younger people are more comfortable with vending
machines,'' said David Vlahov, a professor at Johns Hopkins who was
an author of the study. ``Why? Because they're not being preached
at or to. They don't have to stand in line. There's more anonymity
possible with this type of program. That's typically more
attractive to young adults.''
</P>
<P>
   Vlahov explained that when people started to inject drugs, they
did not know how to do it themselves and tended to rely on others
for supplies. ``As they're developing the experience, the
likelihood of getting a contaminated needle is high,'' he said.
``The vending machines may be helpful in averting that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, the idea is to identify individuals early to get
them not to use drugs. If they're not injecting, then we'd like to
get in there and tell them injection is dangerous. For those who
have started, we want them to stop. Those who won't or can't stop,
well, we want to reduce the risk of transmission of these
infections.''
</P>
<P>
   The study's lead author, Dr. Yolande Obadia, director of the
Regional Center for Disease Control of Southeastern France, said
vending machines seemed to attract a ``hidden part of the
injection-drug-user population'' and added, ``Interviewers were
sometimes surprised to be confronted with yuppie-type customers in
BMW cars.''
</P>
<P>
   The second study, in Vancouver, looked at ways to use marketing
techniques to get people to buy condoms. While health organizations
sometimes distribute condoms, the process can be expensive and
sporadic.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the University of Manitoba used two different
condom coupon strategies. In the first, a widespread distribution
strategy, the researchers distributed coupons offering a 75 percent
discount to people at nightclubs, fitness areas and special events.
In the second, more focused approach, the investigators made
10-percent-off coupons available inside drugstores for use that day
only. Researchers also observed the behavior of customers who
received the coupons while they were in the drugstores.
</P>
<P>
   The use of the 75-percent-off coupons was negligible, but
coupons received inside the stores were redeemed at a rate of
significantly higher than the national average for discount coupons
for health products. The focused distribution was more effective,
researchers said, because buyers had the occasion and limited time
in which to make the purchase.
</P>
<P>
   ``Making safety more available is a viable strategy,'' said Dr.
Darren W. Dahl, the lead author and a professor of marketing in the
Management School at the University of Manitoba. ``Abstinence is
the safest approach, but it's not for everyone. Those who don't
chose that route to safety need other options.''

   FBC-CLEMSON-BOWDEN _ ATLANTA _ Clemson football fans were not
expecting much when Tommy Bowden left Tulane to become their coach.
The team was 3-8 in 1998, and it appeared there wasn't much talent
on hand. But Bowden brought in a wide open offensive attack and led
the Tigers to a 7-4 season. It was the greatest single-season
turnaround in ACC history. He brings his team here this week for a
Peach Bowl game vs. Mississippi State. (Parker, Atlanta

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BATAVIA, Ill. _ Sprawling across 6,800 acres of Illinois
prairie, the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory has for three
decades played a pivotal role in the quest to understand the
ultimate nature of matter.
</P>
<P>
   Fermilab still houses the most powerful particle accelerator in
the world, four miles around and capable of accelerating protons
and antiprotons to energies of a trillion volts and then smashing
them together, but the laboratory is showing signs of age. The
cutting edge of high-energy physics is moving to Europe, and
Fermilab's next decade could prove to be the laboratory's last
hurrah.
</P>
<P>
   Chunks of concrete have fallen from the walls of Fermilab's
15-story administration building into the atrium it encloses, and
pipes have burst, treating workers to unwelcome showers. The High
Rise, as the building is known, was designed for a 20-year
lifetime, but it is now more than 30 years old, and fixing the
structure and its plumbing will take two years and cost $20
million.
</P>
<P>
   The scientific reservation, where Fermilab's naturalists
recreated a pre-Columbian habitat for wild prairie plants and
established a sanctuary for prairie bison and other animals, is now
hedged in by the sprawling suburbs of Chicago. Industrial buildings
and housing developments have sprung up all around the laboratory
site, and Fermilab's new director, Dr. Michael Witherell, had to
act fast to block a highway that would have run through the site.
</P>
<P>
   When Dr. Robert R. Wilson became Fermilab's founding director in
1967, one of his objectives was to create the most beautiful
laboratory he could, and his artistic touches still impress
visitors.
</P>
<P>
   The High Rise itself was modeled after the Beauvais Cathedral in
France, and like the cathedral, its double towers dominated the
surrounding countryside.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson insisted that even the most mundane laboratory
accessories _ large capacitor banks, transformers and power lines _
should be shaped as abstract sculptures and placed to best artistic
effect. Typical of his artistic initiatives is one of the larger
sculptures adorning the site, a three-legged representation of the
concept of broken symmetry, which is a mysterious characteristic of
certain particle transformations. Broken symmetry is thought to
explain why more matter than antimatter was created by the Big
Bang, thereby leaving a surplus of matter sufficient to create the
universe.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson and his successor, Dr. Leon M. Lederman, co-winner of the
1988 Nobel Prize in Physics, realized that top scientists from
Europe and elsewhere needed special intellectual inducements to
work in the rural setting of Fermilab, and these two directors
started a series of art shows, concerts, plays and lectures
intended to attract smart, educated people.
</P>
<P>
   All these attractions are still in place, but far more important
to Fermilab's staff and users is the neck-and-neck scientific race
the laboratory is running against CERN, the European Laboratory for
Particle Physics.
</P>
<P>
   In the 21st century the focus of high-energy particle physics is
expected to shift to Europe's CERN laboratory near Geneva, where a
coalition of nations, including the United States, is building the
Large Hadron Collider, a machine that will seize the title as the
world's most powerful particle accelerator, capable of accelerating
a proton to an energy of seven trillion electronvolts: seven times
the energy imparted by Fermilab's Tevatron.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Large Hadron Collider is completed, however, Fermilab
still has a chance to cop two more great physics prizes: the
detection of a Higgs field, a universal field believed to endow all
particles with mass, and one or more supersymmetric particles,
which are hypothetical entities that might allow physicists to
integrate the force of gravity with the other three forces of
nature.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, Fermilab completed a monster accelerator called the
Tevatron, in which opposing beams of protons and antiprotons are
brought into collision at a combined energy of nearly two trillion
electronvolts.
</P>
<P>
   The most conspicuous achievement of the Tevatron in its 14 years
of operation was the discovery in 1995 of the ``top quark,'' which
filled in the last blank space for six quarks allotted by a table
of fundamental particles known as the Standard Model. (The other
quarks are named ``up,'' ``down,'' ``charm,'' ``strange,'' and
``bottom'' or ``beauty.'' Only the ``up'' and ``down'' quarks,
which are components of protons and neutrons, have occurred in
nature since the Big Bang.)
</P>
<P>
   Using the mighty Tevatron and its two huge detectors, scientists
probed the puzzling nature of the ultraheavy top quark, shed light
on particle symmetry violations and elucidated other mysteries of
physics. The Tevatron failed to detect either the Higgs field (as
well as its associated particle, the Higgs boson) or a
supersymmetric particle (known as sparticle).
</P>
<P>
   The quest for supersymmetric particles has become one of the
main aims of high-energy physics.
</P>
<P>
   Theories of supersymmetry assume that for every known particle
and antiparticle there is a corresponding supersymmetric particle.
If this were to prove true, physicists could take a giant step
toward the long sought ``theory of everything,'' which would
incorporate quantum gravity with the other three forces of nature,
all of which can be expressed in quantum-mechanical terms: the
electromagnetic force and the strong and weak nuclear forces. A
quantum-mechanical version of the theory of gravity has yet to be
devised.
</P>
<P>
   To seek major physics breakthroughs, physicists at Fermilab
could not count on increasing the energy of the Tevatron by a large
amount. Instead, they greatly increased the ``luminosity'' of the
machine _ the numbers of protons and antiprotons packed into
opposing beams. The higher concentration of colliding particles
would make collision events much more frequent, increasing the
chances of detecting events revealing the Higgs field,
supersymmetry or other new phenomena.
</P>
<P>
   To do this, Fermilab has built a new ring-shaped accelerator two
miles in circumference called a ``main injector.'' Built over seven
years at a cost of $260 million, the main injector was recently
completed and is functioning independently of the Tevatron. The
Tevatron itself cost about $259 million.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in the spring of 2001, the main injector will begin
feeding torrents of protons and antiprotons into the giant Tevatron
ring, and great discoveries will quickly ensue, physicists hope.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The laboratory team was so successful in designing and building
the main injector that for no extra cost they added a new storage
ring within the tunnel, a ring for recycling antiprotons.
</P>
<P>
   A key part of this Tevatron's capability was the development of
a factory for making antiprotons by bombarding a nickel target with
protons. (The leader of the antiproton program was Dr. John Peoples
Jr., who succeeded Lederman as Fermilab's director.) A new step
incorporated in the latest Tevatron upgrade will be a system for
conserving antiprotons. Antiprotons are generally wasted after use
in colliding beams; when they are allowed to come into contact with
any ordinary matter, they are instantly annihilated, transformed
into high-energy gamma rays. By saving antiprotons in the new
storage ring for reuse, Fermilab will also save money; the cost of
a single discarded batch of antiprotons has been estimated at
$63,000, and many batches are used in an experimental run.
</P>
<P>
   To improve the prospects for important discoveries still
further, Fermilab's scientific users are completely rebuilding the
two gigantic detectors that serve the accelerator. Each of these
detectors surrounds a spot where proton and antiproton beams are
brought into collision. The two detectors, known as Collider
Detector Fermilab and D-Zero, use a variety of detection systems to
identify and measure the showers of particles and debris created by
collisions, all of them far more sensitive than the systems used to
achieve previous discoveries, including the finding of the top
quark.
</P>
<P>
   The new main injector will also be used to send a beam of
neutrinos through the earth 453 miles to a detector in an iron mine
in Soudan, Minn. Physicists will look for transformations of
neutrinos from one type to another as they speed through the earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``So Fermilab's useful life is far from over,'' Witherell said.
``We just need some cooperation by nature and a little luck.''

active duty and retired personnel and dependents. This means that
after it spent the extra $600 million the military medical system
is between $500 million and $1 billion in arrears and will go broke
if it does not receive an additional shot in the fiscal arm.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The Shas political party, which represents Sephardic
Jews of Middle Eastern and North African descent, announced Monday
that it had decided to quit the coalition government of Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
   But Barak, who seemed unruffled, asked Shas to wait 24 hours and
see what could be resolved. The party, which is his biggest
coalition partner, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   By withdrawing its 17 members of Parliament, the ultra-orthodox
Shas would leave Barak with a minority government of 51 out of 120
members. Other small parties and Arab parties that are nominally in
the opposition would keep Barak's government from falling. But
Shas' departure threatened to throw the political system into chaos
just as it was facing important budgetary and peacemaking
deadlines.
</P>
<P>
   The Shas party has repeatedly threatened to bolt Barak's
coalition government during his six months in office, and it
remained to be seen whether this ultimatum was more ironclad than
previous posturing by the Shas.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to leave the government was made by phoning and
polling each rabbi in the ``council of sages,'' a body led by Rabbi
Ovadia Yosef that guides Shas politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Eli Yishai, the party's 38-year-old leader, said, ``The prime
minister asked us to wait 24 hours. We will respect this. We will
wait 24 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   But Yishai added, ``The rabbis' decision still stands. What will
be in 24 hours, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   As the third-largest political party in Israel, Shas has been an
unstable partner in Barak's broad-based coalition. With its
relatively dovish rabbis, it was enlisted as a potential ally for
the peace effort against vocal opposition from Barak's secular
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   But from the beginning, Shas has conditioned its support on
financing for its indebted religious school system and social
welfare programs.
</P>
<P>
   Shas' announcement came against the backdrop of frenzied
negotiations for next year's budget, which under Israeli law must
be approved by Friday. Yishai said that Shas could not remain in a
government that did not adequately support programs for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Shas wants Barak to bail out its state-subsidized
school system, which is $36 million in debt because of financial
mismanagement and other alleged irregularities. The schools, which
provide hot meals and the longer days that working parents need,
are Shas' bread and butter, attracting adherents to its religious
and political agenda.
</P>
<P>
   As usual when speaking of Shas, Barak adopted a conciliatory
tone in discussing the party's demands. Looking relaxed and
confident, he said he was sure the crisis would fade.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech broadcast to his Labor/One Israel party at the
Parliament on Monday, the prime minister urged Israelis to
recognize the key role of the Shas party and how far it has come in
the last year since its previous leader, Aryeh Deri, was convicted
of corruption and stepped down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The movement of Shas is important to the government of Israel,
to its diplomatic route,'' Barak said. ``It is the third-largest
faction in the Parliament. It is a popular, broad-based movement
that maintains very sober, responsible and balanced positions in
terms of the peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, empathy for Shas did not abound Monday. Yosef Lapid,
the leader of the Shinui Party, which won six votes on the basis of
an anti-religious platform, said he did not take Shas' threats
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is much ado about nothing,'' he said. ``This is another
extortionist trick by Shas that will be concluded in the coming 24
or 48 or 72 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shas does not want to leave the government,'' Lapid continued.
``It wants a fat budget, so it is increasing somewhat the dosage of
its extortion.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Radio reported Monday that Shas leaders met with Ariel
Sharon, the leader of the Likud Party, and received his assurance
that Likud would not rush in to take its place and bolster the
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have made it clear on many occasions, and I will reiterate
that we have no intention of joining this failing government,''
Sharon said later. ``We will not serve as a tool in the hands of
Barak to put pressure on any partner in the coalition.''

FIGHTING FUNGUS WITH NEW NAIL POLISH; PLUS ITEMS ON THE POWER OF
FANTASY; MALPRACTICE; MARIJUANA USE; HEAD INJURIES  
(DW) 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Germany, Ky., Calif . ,, Mich.)   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration has approved a medication in
the form of a nail polish for hard-to-heal fungus infections of
fingernails and toenails.
</P>
<P>
   The prescription polish, Penlac Nail Lacquer, is made by Aventis
Pharma Deutschland and contains an antifungal medicine called
ciclopirox. It can be applied once a day for up to a year.
</P>
<P>
   Nail infections affect 3 percent to 5 percent of Americans,
causing nails to become dry, brittle and discolored, often turning
an opaque white, said Dr. Susan Walker of the FDA. In some cases
the infections can cause pain in walking or grasping objects.
</P>
<P>
   Penlac is the first topical medication approved for the
condition, which has proved difficult to treat locally because the
nails can block a cream or liquid's access to the infection. Most
cases have been treated with oral medications like terbinafine and
itraconazole, but Walker said the side effects of the oral
medicines could be serious, including liver enzyme abnormalities,
gastrointestinal problems and rashes.
</P>
<P>
   ``A topical medicine would not be expected to have the potential
side effects of an oral medication, but oral medications are
considerably more effective,'' Walker said. In various clinical
trials, oral medicines cleared up 90 percent of the infection or
more in 14 percent to 60 percent of patients. Penlac was that
effective for 5 percent to 12 percent of patients.
</P>
<P>
   INQUIRING MINDS FIND OUT THAT FANTASIES OUTPERFORM ASPIRIN
</P>
<P>
   Sexual fantasies may be better than aspirin for reducing pain, a
Johns Hopkins University study has found.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, 40 college students were asked to hold their hands
in ice water for as long as they could. Earlier, they had each been
asked to imagine sexual situations that they rated as maximally
pleasurable or less stirring. One group was asked to envision the
``preferred fantasy'' during the ice immersion; others,
``nonpreferred fantasy'' or an emotionally neutral act like walking
to class.
</P>
<P>
   The students who most liked what they were thinking about were
able to keep their hands submerged for an average of three minutes,
compared with slightly less than a minute for the others. Those in
the preferred fantasy group also scored lower on other pain
measures, said the study's author, Dr. Peter Staats, chief of the
university's pain medicine division. Results were presented at a
conference in October and formally released this month.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1996 study, Staats found that students who were told to
concentrate on words with positive connotations showed greater
endurance for cold than those thinking of negative words. Last
year, he came across an article in The National Enquirer
summarizing that research.
</P>
<P>
   ``Except that every time we used `positive word,' they said
`sex,''' Staats recalled. ``I got a kick out of that, and thought
that would be a very strong positive emotional state that we could
test.''
</P>
<P>
   The results, he added, should remind physicians of ``the power
of suggestion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The effect was certainly more powerful than aspirin and in
some cases more powerful than mild narcotics,'' said Staats, who
specializes in placebo effects.
</P>
<P>
   AN UP-FRONT APPROACH TO MALPRACTICE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Veterans Affairs hospital in Lexington, Ky., says it has found
a way to keep its malpractice costs below those of most similar
hospitals: make full disclosure to injured patients, even when they
would not otherwise have learned of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors generally agree that the angriest people, not the most
injured, sue for malpractice, and there is little that makes
patients or families angrier than learning that a hospital covered
up a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Revealing problems ``diminishes the anger and desire for revenge
that often motivate patients' litigation,'' the hospital's chief of
staff, Dr. Stephen Kraman, wrote in a study published last week in
The Annals of Internal Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The study compared malpractice costs at 36 similar centers
between 1990 and 1996. Payments over that span ranged from less
than $1 million to $12 million. Seven had costs lower than
Lexington's $1.3 million total.
</P>
<P>
   Under the policy, a hospital committee identifies and
investigates potential malpractice cases and notifies patients or
their relatives and offers money if the accident or negligence
resulted in loss of life, earning potential or other functions.
</P>
<P>
   In five of the 88 instances in which malpractice claims were
filed against the hospital during the study period, the patients
probably would not have learned of the problem if the hospital had
not told them, Kraman wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes there is anger and surprise,'' he said. ``In many
cases, they get very emotional that someone cared enough about
them, that they told the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   A DOWNER FOR AGING MARIJUANA USERS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Smoking marijuana significantly increases the risk of head and
neck cancers, according to a new study, which also predicts more
cases as baby boomers age.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, led by Dr. Zuo-Feng Zhang, a professor of
epidemiology at the Jonsson Cancer Center at the University of
California at Los Angeles, found that marijuana was almost as
damaging as tobacco in terms of respiratory tract cancer, despite
the fact that the drug was generally regarded as safer.
</P>
<P>
   The study, published in the journal Cancer Epidemiology,
Biomarkers and Prevention, compared the use of marijuana, tobacco
and alcohol by 173 patients suffering from head or neck cancers to
the habits of a control group of 176 cancer-free patients.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang said that marijuana users faced 2.5 times the risk of
cancer as nonusers. Tobacco increased the risk 3.5 times, he said,
and people who smoked both tobacco and marijuana raised their risk
36 times.
</P>
<P>
   A larger study now under way, is needed to confirm the results,
he said. Meanwhile, he said that people who smoked marijuana in
their youth should have regular examinations for the early warning
signs of throat, tongue or other cancers. ``If you consider the
latency time, about 30 years, we could well have an increase in the
next five or 10 years,'' he said. ``But many of these cancers are
easy to treat if they are caught early.''
</P>
<P>
   GAUGING HOW BADLY A HEAD IS HURT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Getting hit in the head, it turns out, is not a simple thing. As
a result, researchers from the Henry Ford Health Systems in Detroit
have been working with the National Football League, the National
Hockey League and the National Collegiate Athletic Association to
promote a new, more individualized system to determine when a
player who has suffered a concussion can safely return to
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Now, most sports physicians rely on one of a number of grading
systems, which rank symptoms and recommend varying lengths of
symptom-free observation, from 20 minutes to several weeks, before
allowing an athlete to return to play. Dr. Mark R. Lovell, the head
of the Ford division of neuropsychology and an author of an article
on concussions in The Journal of the American Medical Society last
week, said those guidelines had been useful but no longer reflected
the state of medical knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, our understanding of concussion has been modeled
after boxing,'' he said. As a result, the guidelines place the
heaviest weight on loss of consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   But physicians have learned that what Lovell called the
``short-circuiting'' that occurs when brain tissue slams up against
the skull can often make itself known in a more gradual way. ``We
see players who weren't even close to being knocked out who later
develop symptoms that suggest more severe concussions,'' he said,
``and players who are knocked out who afterward have very little in
the way of symptoms.''
</P>
<P>
   The best way to tell if an athlete's mental processes have
returned to normal, he said, is to compare them with data from
preseason tests of memory skills and reaction times.

 &HT;    BUSINESS MAGAZINES: 'Magic' Johnson shows how it's done
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Atlanta Tribune (January), which calls itself
``black Atlanta's ultimate resource for business, careers,
technology and wealth-building,'' unveils its new format with a
profile of professional basketball star Earvin ``Magic'' Johnson's
business enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm motivated to show everybody, especially (corporations that
were) scared to come into our communities, that we are a success,
and that you can earn a return on your investment in the
African-American community,'' Johnson says.
</P>
<P>
   Magic Johnson Enterprises, based in Beverly Hills, Calif.,
invests in and operates a number of businesses, mostly within black
neighborhoods. His Atlanta operations include the 12-screen Magic
Johnson Theaters, a T.G.I. Friday's restaurant and a Starbucks
coffee shop. Other developments are planned, the magazine says.
</P>
<P>
   More buffeting for Buffett's portfolio
</P>
<P>
   Is Warren Buffett losing his magic touch after more than 30
years of unrivaled investment success? Probably not, says Barron's
(Dec. 27), but the billionaire investor's Berkshire Hathaway
portfolio ``may experience its first annual stock-price decline
since 1990.'' Analysts blame the anticipated drop of 22.5 percent
partly on Chief Executive Officer Buffett's distaste for technology
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The Berkshire Hathaway portfolio has been hurt in 1999 by losses
in Coca-Cola, Freddie Mac and Gillette. But American Express is a
big winner, offsetting some of the Coca-Cola losses since the two
stocks together account for more than half the portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Great investment ideas rest on fundamentals
</P>
<P>
   The theme of ``great investment ideas'' for 2000 continues to
dominate the personal finance segment of the business press.
</P>
<P>
   The new century promises ``unimaginable change,'' but Smart
Money (January), The Wall Street Journal's personal investment
magazine, says it's the well-managed companies that will still
attract most investors.
</P>
<P>
   Individual Investor (January) says an influential group of
naysayers challenges the idea that the Federal Reserve will raise
interest rates again in 2000. They argue that rates will fall, and
the 30-year Treasury yield will drop to 4.5 percent (it's almost
6.5 percent now).
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street guru Ed Yardeni tells Mutual Funds (January) that
real estate investment trusts are a bargain for investors looking
for income, especially REITs that specialize in apartment
properties.
</P>
<P>
   Worth mentioning ...
</P>
<P>
   Ten centuries have transformed mankind's wealth, numbers, work,
lifestyles, rights, literacy, communications and understanding of
the world, The Economist (Dec. 31) says in its special millennium
edition.
</P>
<P>
   Success (January), a magazine that targets entrepreneurs,
provides a Dick-and-Jane primer on how to start a business. It's
like hunting for buried treasure, the magazine says. ``You know
there's gold out there, but you need a map to get it.''

 &HT;    UPS is the whole package, says Forbes
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ We may be living in a high-tech era but it still takes
a low-tech truck to deliver something you've ordered over the
Internet, which is why Forbes magazine picked Atlanta-based United
Parcel Service as its ``company of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With 157,000 ground vehicles, 610 aircraft and $11 billion
invested in technology, UPS moves both atoms and bits,'' says
Forbes in announcing its ``platinum list'' of ``America's best big
companies.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Forbes, UPS's role as a shipper of 6 percent of the
nation's gross domestic product makes it ``the missing link in the
burgeoning world of E-commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes notes UPS has invested heavily in technology in the last
decade, including mainframes, PCs, handheld computers, wireless
modems, cellular networks and 4,000 programmers and technicians.
</P>
<P>
   This makes possible the immediate knowledge of every movement of
goods, ``but is also the glue of trust for a new wave of worldwide
commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   ``UPS used to be a trucking company with technology,'' said
Forbes. ``Now it's a technology company with trucks.''
</P>
<P>
   Privately-owned for all but two months of its almost 100-year
existence, UPS went public in November with the biggest public
stock offering in history: $5.47 billion at an opening price of $50
per share.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes notes that UPS shows a 56 percent drop in net income in
the past 12 months, but says this is due mainly to $1.8 billion the
company had to pay to settle a tax assessment charge stemming from
the 1980s.

   ISRAEL-POLITICS (Jerusalem) _ The Shas political party, which
represents Sephardic Jews of Middle Eastern and North African
descent, announced Monday that it had decided to quit the coalition
government of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak. But Barak, who

   YUGOSLAVIA-SOLDIER (Leskovac, Yugoslavia) _ For Vlada, a unit

   CHINA-QIGONG (Beijing) _ A thriving anti-cancer movement based
on breathing exercises and strenuous walking is one of hundreds of
qigong variants operating in China, even as the authorities crack
down on one prominent offshoot, Falun Gong, and step up scrutiny of
the others. The official acceptance of some qigong sects while
others are crushed is part of a long, often tortuous effort by the

him. And his airy campaign slogan of ``practical idealism''
encapsulated just what Gore wanted the world to know about him: He
was pragmatic yet optimistic, visionary even. But his glide to the

DISNEY BREAKS ALL ITS OWN RULES WITH `FANTASIA 2000'
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: With FILM-FANTASIA-Y2K PARTY) 
By VALERIE KUKLENSKI 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Roy E. Disney was speaking long distance from New York, but the
ear-to-ear grin was there in his voice.
</P>
<P>
   He was chatting the morning after the world premiere of his new
movie, ``Fantasia 2000,'' a Carnegie Hall show that had the London
Philharmonia playing the score live, synchronizing the music
precisely to the animated action on screen, be it leaping and
plunging whales, a jack-hammering construction worker or a
yoyo-flinging flamingo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It went sensationally,'' said Disney, the show's executive
producer. ``We were more than delighted. It's a bit of a high-wire
act to run the film and have the orchestra play, but it just went
absolutely as good as it can get.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, ``Fantasia 2000'' is a high-wire act even when it
is screened with a recorded score. It breaks many of the 1980s and
'90s rules of Disney animation: It's being released during the
winter instead of the summer, and just as the holiday school break
is ending; it is geared more toward adults than children; it
doesn't lend itself well to plush toys or McDonald's giveaways; and
it was scored by great classical composers of the recent and
distant past, with nary a number by Elton John. If that weren't
limiting enough, Walt Disney Pictures has chosen ``Fantasia 2000''
for its first foray into the jumbo-screen IMAX format, restricting
its opening to some 70 screens worldwide instead of thousands.
</P>
<P>
   But Roy E. Disney did not resurrect the ``Fantasia'' franchise
to meet some corporate formula for success, nor to placate Disney
investors looking to the chairman for a project that will
immediately boost their slumping shares.
</P>
<P>
   For Roy Disney, ``Fantasia 2000'' has been an eight-year labor
of love, an homage to the pioneering spirit his Uncle Walt and his
father, Roy O. Disney, gave to their company, and a tribute to the
1940 concert film that has always been his favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me it's been very personal,'' said Disney, who turns 70
next month. ``It was an idea that always appealed to me. I remember
my father coming home one day very shortly after the (1940) film
had come out, and he was amused by the idea that Walt wanted to do
next `Flight of the Bumblebee' because he had that great
stereophonic sound system and he wanted to fly the bee around the
room, which I always thought was an interesting, subversive sort of
idea because if you could make the audience look for the bee
instead of looking at the screen it would be kind of interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fantasia'' had been one of Walt's pet projects, born out of
his love for great animation and classical music. It originally had
begun as a short starring Mickey Mouse as ``The Sorcerer's
Apprentice,'' but the film took on a life of its own and wound up
as a two-hour fantasy-rich montage of fairies, winged horses,
dinosaurs and ostriches in ballet slippers. Walt was so pleased
with the movie that, despite its whopping $2.28 million price, he
announced plans to make ``Fantasia'' an annual event, retaining
many of the original pieces with an additional work or two added
for each release. Roy E. Disney explained why that never came to
pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of the affects of (World War II), which was the
next five or six years of all our lives, was that the company was
not so far from bankruptcy by the time it was over. Many of the
good artists had been drafted, and Walt set out to make training
films and propaganda films and so on, and we were spending a lot
more than we were getting back in a lot of ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad sold our house at the end of the war. So we were really
pretty close to the edge, and it wasn't until 1950-51 _ the
`Cinderella' days _ that things started to turn back for the
good.''
</P>
<P>
   But then came Disneyland and TV projects such as ``The Mickey
Mouse Club'' and ``The Wonderful World of Disney,'' and
``Fantasia'' fell by the wayside.
</P>
<P>
   The successful 1991 video release of ``Fantasia'' inspired Roy
to pick up where his uncle left off. He watched the original a few
times, and even read the 1940 reviews, before setting out a plan
for the new work.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I was looking for basically was structure, because you
need to have a beginning, a middle and an end for the thing to make
sense as anything but a collection of shorts.''
</P>
<P>
   The film opens with a vibrant, geometric interpretation of
Beethoven's famous Fifth Symphony, continues with an aerial whale
ballet set to Ottorino Respighi's ``Pines of Rome,'' and moves on
to a narrative about life in 1930s Manhattan inspired by the line
drawings of Al Hirschfeld and set to George Gershwin's ``Rhapsody
in Blue.''
</P>
<P>
   Donald Duck gets his day in Edward Elgar's ``Pomp and
Circumstance'' marches, best-known as theme music for graduation
ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   Francis Glebas, a storyboard artist at Disney, earned his
feature film directing debut after pitching a story idea for it in
Disney's in-house brainstorming forum known as ``the gong show.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had thought of an idea for `Fantasia' of Noah trying to get
the animals on the ark,'' Glebas said. ``I thought it was such a
funny idea. I set it to Rossini's `Barber of Seville' so it was
very energetic and animated.
</P>
<P>
   ``So when they suggested Donald and `Pomp and Circumstance,' I
heard the theme in my head and saw the animals and knew I had great
idea, and they went for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Roy has preserved one piece from the original for ``Fantasia
2000,'' ``The Sorcerer's Apprentice,'' remaining true to his
uncle's intention of keeping a core element and, at the same time,
giving contemporary Disney fans context for all those images of
Mickey in the long red robe and the magician's hat, a popular motif
seen even outside the studio's animation building in Burbank. Some
``Fantasia 2000'' watchers have complained that, although
``Sorcerer'' has been digitally restored, it is very grainy and
somewhat bland in color compared with the new works before and
after it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways I wish it were (less grainy), but on the other
hand, it is what it is, and it's a miracle that it looks that good
in certain ways,'' Disney said. ``I think partly the
preservationist instinct in us kind of makes us not try to overly
clean it as we probably could. I think it has to show its age a
little bit, kind of a respect for the people who made it.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney would not disclose his budget. ``I will tell you that it
came out for what we all think is a very reasonable amount.'' He
said rumored figures are extremely high, but guessed that
``Fantasia 2000'' cost ``quite a lot less'' than the original when
the figures are adjusted for inflation. One economist projected
that the 1940 budget would be worth about $43 million today, which
would make ``Fantasia 2000'' a bargain compared with those recent
summertime features.
</P>
<P>
   It seems the honchos at Walt Disney Pictures, reputed for
mapping out entire marketing strategies for a film before shooting
a frame, are flying by the seat of their pants on ``Fantasia
2000,'' adopting the IMAX concept as almost an afterthought and
uncertain about when it will be released in 35mm and home versions.
It echoes Walt's early practice of do good work and hope it sells,
an approach that sometimes drove his business-minded brother to
distraction.
</P>
<P>
   What would the brothers Disney say about ``Fantasia 2000''?
</P>
<P>
   ``You just would hope they like it,'' said their son and nephew.
``I think they both would be pleased that we've done what we've
done because I think what we've done is good work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walt, I'm sure, would have had ideas to fix something,'' he
added with a chuckle. ``You could not get anything past Walt
without him fixing something. The mystery always was what would he
fix and what would he not bother to fix.'' &QL;

   Still without plans for New Year's Eve? Looking for something
special that doesn't involve travel? Walt Disney Pictures still has
tickets available for the West Coast premiere of ``Fantasia 2000,''
which will be screened in the eye-popping IMAX format accompanied
live by the 120-piece London Philharmonia orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   The black-tie affair at Pasadena Civic Auditorium for 2,000
revelers opens with a gourmet feast created by Joachim Splichal and
Patina Catering. Next comes the screening, then dancing to '70s pop
stars Chicago and swing band Big Bad Voodoo Daddy. At midnight
there will be champagne, pyrotechnics and confetti.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, ``special'' is the opposite of ``cheap.'' Tickets
cost $2,000 each (think of it as $1 a year), or $20,000 for a table
of 10. A portion of that price goes to California Institute of the
Arts, the training ground for many Disney artists. For reservations
and information _ including how to dodge the Tournament of Roses
traffic snarls _ call (818) 238-1095. &QL;

   BOULDER, Colo. _ Why would anyone want to get up at 5:15 every
morning to study microscopic pond organisms? It makes perfect sense
if, like Dr. Thomas R. Cech, one has a thirst for hard scientific
data and does not want to waste a second.
</P>
<P>
   Cech, now about to become president of the Howard Hughes Medical
Institute, decided in high school that biology was too soft a
science and trained as a chemist at the University of California at
Berkeley. Still, he was drawn to DNA, the genetic material, as his
favorite chemical.
</P>
<P>
   After doctoral studies at Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
he veered sharply from the beaten track. He took a job at the
University of Colorado in Boulder. He decided to study not DNA but
the less popular RNA, a chemical relative now known to play many
different roles in living cells. Fed up with mouse husbandry and
the slowness of seeking hard data in soft tissues, he chose an
obscure, pond-dwelling creature, the Tetrahymena as his
experimental organism.
</P>
<P>
   A single-celled protozoan, it belongs to the same kingdom as
plants and animals, a group known as eukaryotes. Because it divides
quickly, Cech said, ``Here was a way to get a bucketful of
eukaryotic cells.''
</P>
<P>
   His choices paid off quickly in a major discovery. Chemical
reactions in a living cell are guided by biological catalysts known
as enzymes. Dogma then held that all enzymes were protein
molecules. Cech noticed a reaction in Tetrahymena that occurred
when no proteins were around, only RNA. After two years, he proved
that RNA itself could be an enzyme. Without DNA, no protein enzymes
can be made; without enzymes no DNA can be made.
</P>
<P>
   His discovery resolved a longstanding conundrum about the origin
of life: whether DNA or the protein enzymes came first. The
solution is that RNA, or something like it, could have come first
because RNA can store information like DNA and can act as an enzyme
as do proteins.
</P>
<P>
   At first Cech's work was ignored. ``No one felt very threatened
by it, because it was happening in Boulder, with this weird
organism, so people thought, `We don't have to deal with it,'''
Cech said. But others reported similar findings, and biologists
familiar with debates about the origin of life saw its
significance. Cech started winning numerous prizes, culminating in
the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Avoiding the distraction of the awards, he continued to study
RNA and became interested in proteins that cap the telomeres, or
ends, of the chromosomes. One protein, called telomerase, has the
vital task of copying the telomeres when the chromosome divides.
But no one had been able to isolate telomerase, which is very rare
in most cells.
</P>
<P>
   Cech pursued telomerase by working with another protozoan,
Euplotes aediculatus, whose genome is divided into millions of
chromosomes. Euplotes keeps enough telomerase around that one of
Cech's students was able to isolate the enzyme, a finding that
enabled the human version and its gene to be found. The telomerase
gene is of particular interest because it enables human cells
cultured in the test tube to transcend aging.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many professors, Cech enjoys teaching, an interest that
commended him to the Hughes trustees because the institute runs a
large education program. Even after winning his Nobel he continued
to give chemistry lectures to Colorado's undergraduates.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent meeting of his lab group, Cech listened to his
graduate and postdoctoral students, saving time by combining it
with a lunch of two oranges and a plain slice of bread. He gently
chided the procrastination of a student who seemed to have
developed most of his data the night before, but afterward took him
aside to praise his progress.
</P>
<P>
   At the Hughes Institute's finely appointed new building in
Bethesda, Md., Cech will oversee a large program of aid to foreign
scientists, as well as the Hughes fellowship and education
programs. Institute officials declined to state Cech's salary but
said the job now pays $630,000 a year, with $129,000 in benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Even Howard Hughes, in Cech's view, must have thirsted after
knowledge in his own way. ``Some people say the institute was just
a tax write-off,'' Cech said, ``but to have that tax write-off
rather than funding the arts was because he had a real interest in
medical science.''

   LESKOVAC, Yugoslavia _ For Vlada, a unit commander for the
Yugoslav Army during the Kosovo war, the months since have been a
wretched period of guilt, poverty, doubt and repression, stemming
from his participation in anti-government demonstrations in this
conservative, wary town.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks he is slightly mad; he thinks everyone else in
Leskovac is, too, ground down by Yugoslavia's long isolation, its
wrecked economy, the war and the long reign of the seemingly
immovable Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, whom he reviles.
</P>
<P>
   Vlada still dreams of what he saw in Kosovo, of the long lines
of expelled Albanians, of the dying and the dead, but less often.
Now his dreams are of anxiety and loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have big problems with myself,'' he said, smoking a cheap
Drina cigarette in his small house. ``I'm nervous from morning
until night, and I want to have a fight or an argument with someone
all the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no money here, no cash, no cooking oil, no sugar, no
fresh milk. We look like Romania at the end of the '80s. No one
smiles on the street. Everyone looks sad, and people are dressed
badly. The best job belongs to the guy who fixes shoes. It's
miserable. No one has problems of $1,000 or $2,000, but of 20
cents, $2 or $20. We've become a cheap people, separated from one
another, without morality or scruples or fellow feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   He described a friend who said he could find him cooking oil.
``So I gave him 100 dinars for eight bottles of oil,'' he said,
mentioning an amount equal to about $5.50. ``And two weeks later,
there is nothing. And he will never come, and our friendship falls
apart over 100 dinars. Because he couldn't ask me for a loan _ no
one can afford to give loans any more.''
</P>
<P>
   In early July, after Yugoslav troops and police officers were
forced to withdraw from Kosovo by 78 days of NATO airstrikes, Vlada
took part in the anti-government demonstrations here in Leskovac,
his home in deep southern Serbia and a traditional stronghold of
Milosevic's Socialist Party.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrations, led by army reservists seeking delayed
combat pay, shook the government. But the Belgrade-based democratic
opposition did not capitalize on the spontaneous unrest, and the
demonstrations here, too, have since dwindled away.
</P>
<P>
   But those who took part in them, like Vlada, have been marked
for special attention by the party and the government. (Vlada, who
feels exposed enough in Leskovac, asked that his last name not be
used.)
</P>
<P>
   As the demonstrations collapsed and Milosevic himself came to
visit the town in October, Vlada has been harassed in a pattern
that demonstrates the skill of this authoritarian government and
the deep hold the Socialists _ the former Communists _ still have
on the structures of power.
</P>
<P>
   ``The repression here is not physical but psychological,'' he
said. ``It's as if every activist of the ruling structure has been
ordered in the next 24 hours to frighten two people who are against
the regime.''
</P>
<P>
   Local members of the Socialist Party sought out every person who
had been in the demonstrations here, which were filmed by the
police, and also sought out their friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police go to my friends,'' Vlada said, ``and ask: `Why
him? Why did he do it? Why does he need this?' ''
</P>
<P>
   An artisan who makes leather goods, Vlada has little money and
wants to continue his education in economics to finish a degree. He
made an application that was denied, he said, ``and I got back the
answer, `We can't help because he was in the demonstrations.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The message was delivered to his cousin by two members of the
Socialist Party, who questioned the cousin about Vlada. The content
of the message, Vlada said, was: ``Well, they can help me, but
they're very disappointed in me. And they expected the cousin to
pass on the message and talk to me, which of course he did.''
</P>
<P>
   All this watching, a long tradition from the authoritarian
party, is more effective than prison and cheaper, Vlada said,
especially in small towns, when everyone knows everyone else. ``If
they arrested people, they'd need more jails and have to feed them
at least once a day,'' he said sardonically.
</P>
<P>
   The reason he met a reporter in his home, he said, was that last
summer, after meeting in a cafe, he was asked questions about the
encounter by people he knew.
</P>
<P>
   ``They asked: `Who were those people? What did you talk about?'
'' he said. ``It didn't matter that no one approached us at the
time. The party has a wonderful infrastructure here. It's like a
kind of secret service that works in cells and circles.''
</P>
<P>
   When Milosevic came to Leskovac on Oct. 11, the town was full of
police and security guards, and all those who worked for state
companies were told to attend the rally or risk losing their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there were 20,000 people there, there were 5,000 security
men, all of them edgy,'' Vlada said. ``It was easier to lose your
life that day as a Serb in Leskovac than as a Serb today in Kosovo.
The world thinks every Serb is guilty for everything, but for the
last six years, Milosevic can't walk freely through the streets.
Every third person would kill him in cold blood, and the rest
wouldn't care. Eighty percent of people wait for him to die; it's
the only way we can get out of this magic vicious circle.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Leskovac is a center for Yugoslavia's Third Army, which controls
southern Serbia and, before the war, Kosovo. When its main
commanders, Nebojsa Pavkovic and Vladimir Lazarevic, come here to
local headquarters, which is in a public park, the whole town is
blocked, with military policemen in bulletproof vests standing
guard, rifles fixed with bayonets.
</P>
<P>
   ``They protect these beloved generals from the people who love
them,'' Vlada said acidly. The park itself has been closed to
normal civilians for months now. ``So in the center of this town
you have armed military police, and it's another shame.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is the poverty and hopelessness of his life and that of
his friends, their lack of perspective in a deepening winter, that
depresses Vlada the most.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Leskovac, even those who work are making the equivalent
of only 30 to 50 German marks a month, or $16 to $27. With no fresh
milk, a liter package of preserved milk costs a mark a day. ``To
get your kids milk now takes your whole salary,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To have your appendix out, he said, you need to give 100 marks
to the surgeon _ two months' salary _ and bring your own food to
the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is horrible now,'' he said. ``Everyone has their own
fear, that someone will arrest you or kill you, and your death will
mean nothing to anyone around you. People are afraid the
electricity will be cut off in the winter because they owe money
for it, or it will be cut off because of shortages, like today, for
four hours. Everyone is afraid something in the house will break,
because there is no money to fix it, let alone replace it.
</P>
<P>
   ``And people become crueler and less thoughtful to one another.
I think I'm a cultured person, and now I start screaming about
prices in the shops. It doesn't matter that the salesman isn't
responsible. When I buy toothpaste, I need 20 minutes to compare
the sizes and the prices, and in the end I buy something, but it
shocks me, and I come home nervous. And I put the toothpaste on the
table, and I tell my wife how much it costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Even those who work for the government are in trouble. One man
spent two months working hard to rebuild a bombed railway bridge at
Grdelica, where NATO rockets hit a passenger train. For 60 days of
work, the man received 500 dinars, or $27.
</P>
<P>
   But when the politicians came to reopen the bridge, in a blaze
of publicity, they decorated the manager of the company for his
services to the nation and provided a lavish spread of meat and
drink.
</P>
<P>
   The workers protested and said they would prefer the cash. But
the manager said: ``Don't worry, no one will ever pay for this food
and drink. Maybe someone else will get a medal.''
</P>
<P>
   Vlada insists that he did not knowingly kill anyone in Kosovo,
though he saw terrible and disturbing events, with ``ethnic
cleansing,'' killings and mental and moral breakdowns. ``I'm
satisfied with the way I acted, and if called to fight to defend
the country I would go again,'' Vlada said. ``But I hate the whole
world for giving me this opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   The war was unnecessary, he said. It was ``made by empires and
pride.'' And now, he said, the mess in Kosovo lets Milosevic defend
the war and accuse the opposition of being traitors for dealing
with the leaders of the same countries that bombed Serbia. ``The
visit of the opposition leaders to Washington and to Madeleine
Albright was covered here as if they were going to ask for a new
bombing campaign, and a lot of people believe this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Zoran Djindjic, the leader of the Democratic Party, who is
contemplating resigning for his failure to oust Milosevic, is
treated like the government's main enemy. ``People who hate
Milosevic buy this propaganda,'' Vlada said. ``They would be happy
if Milosevic dies, but first they want to kill Djindjic.''
</P>
<P>
   Vlada says Kosovo sometimes bursts through into his dreams. He
and his men spent 60 days without clean water or electricity,
sleeping on the floor of abandoned Albanian houses in the hills
between Gnjilane and Kacanik, fighting the Kosovo Liberation Army
and hiding from NATO bombs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lately, I dream of the house we were in last,'' he said. ``A
few days ago I had a real nightmare. There is the house, and the
owner of the house changes. Sometimes it's a Serb, sometimes it's
an Albanian.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of people standing around, and I know that the
dead have come back to live in their houses,'' he said, his voice
suddenly cracking, ``and I don't want them to think badly about
me.''
</P>
<P>
   He stopped to compose himself, lighting another Drina. ``But my
problems now are sugar and cooking oil and toothpaste,'' he said.
``This town is a twilight zone, like your worst dreams, when you're
dreaming and sweating. When you have something and you lose it in a
dream, and it recedes farther and farther away, and you can't catch
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's our life today. We'll probably live worse than this,
and this is horrible. We never think it can get worse, but it
does.''

A SCIENCE QUESTION ANSWERED: THE FASTEST BIRD 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times) 
(ms) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. What bird flies the fastest?
</P>
<P>
   A. The winner, wings down, is the peregrine falcon, Falco
peregrinus, which may also be the fastest animal of any kind on
earth. Estimates of its top speed when diving start around 200
miles per hour, and some authorities put it considerably higher,
perhaps 275 mph. Its top horizontal speed is 60 mph or more.
</P>
<P>
   The high speeds are essential to the normal feeding habits of
the peregrine falcon, which overtakes and kills other birds or bats
in mid-air. The bird cruises for hours, then plunges in a move
known as a stoop.
</P>
<P>
   The prey is often killed by violent impact with the peregrine's
snatching talons.
</P>
<P>
   The peregrine falcon is 15 to 21 inches long, and its wingspan
is about 36 to 44 inches.
</P>
<P>
   The population of peregrine falcons has made a well-publicized
recovery since the pesticide DDT was banned in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   The residue of the poison in the peregrines' prey built up in
the fatty tissue in the parents, and the female falcons laid eggs
that were deficient in calcium and too weak to withstand the
incubation of 32 days or longer under a mother who weights about
three pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Readers are invited to submit questions by mail to Question,
Science Times, The New York Times, 229 West 43rd Street, New York,

&HT;     RECOVERING ALCOHOLICS BRACE FOR NEW YEAR'S PARTIES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 &HT;     By JUDY HOLLAND   
 &HT;     c.1999 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As partygoers make plans for the New Year's Eve
bash of the century, recovering alcoholics are bracing to keep
sober amidst the hoopla celebrating the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   New York Yankees outfielder Darryl Strawberry, one of baseball's
most feared hitters and known for his public struggles with drug
and alcohol abuse, said Monday that he intends to ring in the New
Year with his family in a Baptist church in Tampa, Fla., near his
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even entertain the thought of going to a party,'' said
Strawberry. ``I used to think that's the greatest feeling in life.
You wear the hats, you blow the horns and you drink until you can't
feel anymore. But, it turns out, that's an escape from what life
really is.''
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry says he has been sober for nine months after twice
falling off the wagon. Avoiding the millennium revelry is the best
way to avoid a relapse, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing there for me,'' said Strawberry, spokesman for
the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence, a nonprofit
private educational group. ``To me it's a false thing anyway _ a
big charade. I should have been dead from all the drinking I have
done. I am better off sober.''
</P>
<P>
   For an estimated 1.5 million recovering alcoholics nationwide,
this New Year's Eve will be especially tough because there has been
so much hoopla surrounding the rollover into the new century and
the new millennium, said Stacia Murphy, president of the New
York-based group.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the anticipation of Y2K that has heightened anxiety and
made people more prone to drink,'' Murphy said. ``It's the
uncertainty of it all. There probably will be more celebration than
we've ever seen. People just get caught up in the hype of it all.
If you have a drinking problem or are in recovery, it's really
important to stay away.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said the holidays are always tough for people trying to
avoid drinking because Americans have a habit of popping corks to
mark special occasions. ``We use alcohol in this country for
celebration,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   However, some experts say staying home isn't always the key to
staying sober, because some people may feel left out and depressed
and may take a nip in private.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Dukes, a 43-year-old owner of an advertising business in
Knoxville, Tenn., says he plans to go out and celebrate by
attending a liquor-free New Year's Eve scavenger hunt where the
only refreshments will be coffee and desert.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Year's Eve is the mother of cocktail parties,'' said
Dukes, who boasts he has been sober since 1996. ``I don't choose to
be around that atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   Another recovering alcoholic, a 40-year-old Rochester, N.Y.,
secretary who gives only her first name as Ceil, says she plans to
usher in 2000 at home serving rootbeer floats to her family,
including her 87-year-old grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be there with my computer and make sure it doesn't blow
up,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Lyle Prouse, a retired airline pilot from Conyers, Ga., who is
celebrating his 10th year of sobriety, says he has learned to avoid
parties during the holidays and has no New Year's Eve plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the champagne that makes the occasion, it's the event
that makes the occasion,'' Prouse said. ``For me the booze is
toxic. I might just as well pick up a glass of Drano and drink
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Paparella, 52, a Yuba, City, Calif., electrician, says
the partying mania that always accompanies New Year's Eve is
overrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Been there, done that and there's nothing special about the
year 2000,'' Paparella said.

 &HT;    Clemson coach brings Bowden style to Peach
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ag &QR;  ile, adj. _ 1. quick and easy of movement; deft
and active. 2. keen and lively.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no better word sums up the coaching personality of the
Bowden family. In his first season at Clemson's head coach, Tommy
Bowden has had to wring virtually every usage out of that term to
fashion a 6-5 Peach Bowl team. The 1999 Tigers not only survived
but modestly prospered through one of the most difficult schedules
in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Three of Clemson's losses were to the only three undefeated
regular season teams in Division I-A football _ to Florida State
and Marshall by field goals and to Virginia Tech after pulling
within three points in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers were the only team in the country to play all three,
but their approach to each game did not vary by opponent. Along the
way, they set school records for passing offense with an
eye-popping offensive attack, employed an opportunistic defense and
unveiled some typical Bowden trickery to draw national notice.
</P>
<P>
   After inheriting a demoralized 3-8 squad from the fired Tommy
West, Bowden saw some possibilities for a quick turnaround. He was
welcomed by six returning upperclassmen starting on defense; an
experienced quarterback and receiving corps; and a squad that in
general was itching to break out of mediocrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know how to win. They just needed some tweaking, some
fine-tuning,'' Bowden said. ``Really, it hasn't taken a whole lot
(from coaches). They knew how to win games before we got here, and
they're going to continue to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   But something definitely was amiss. West, a linebackers coach
under Danny Ford, was well-liked personally, but the program wasn't
making any progress. West took Clemson to the Peach Bowl three
times and the Gator Bowl once in his five seasons, but the Tigers
never were able to join Virginia, North Carolina and Virginia Tech
in pursuing Florida State's dominance in the Atlantic Coast
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``After last year, we knew we should have been winning more,''
fifth-year senior quarterback Brandon Streeter said. ``We knew we
had to work harder and dedicate ourselves more. But the coaches
came in with a lot of confidence, and in turn, it gave us a lot of
confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Streeter thrived in the new offense and established a school
single-game record with 343 yards passing against Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The silvery-haired, 45-year-old Bowden was brother Terry's
offensive coordinator at Auburn before getting the controls of a
program for the first time at Tulane in 1997. He was one of the
hottest coaching properties in the country after guiding the Green
Wave to an 11-0 season in 1998. Although reportedly offered more
than Clemson's $700,000 annual package to stay in New Orleans, the
competitive lure of coaching in a major conference was too strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were very good to me there; it was hard to leave,'' said
Bowden, a 22-year coaching vagabond whose longest stint was the six
years he spent at Auburn.
</P>
<P>
   He hired four members of his Tulane staff, including offensive
coordinator Rich Rodriguez, who installed a no-huddle offense that
used as many as four or five receivers. While Streeter was the
drop-back starter, Woodrow Dantzler was the option man; Dantzler
filled in admirably when Streeter was on the shelf twice with
injuries. At the same time, Clemson didn't abandon its cherished
ground game. Travis Zachery led the team with 826 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Clemson threw for a school record 2,417 passing yards and
trailed only Florida State and Georgia Tech in ACC total offensive
statistics. Doubling their 1998 win total also made the Tigers the
sixth-most-improved team in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know if we had the talent to do all that, but I
thought it was the system that would give us the best chance to
have some success,'' Bowden said.
</P>
<P>
   In order to accommodate such flexibility, Bowden ordered his
offensive linemen to slim down. No current starter weighs more than
270 pounds, the weight of their lightest Mississippi State
counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been most pleased with how the players have continued to
make progress since the spring,'' Bowden said. ``They understood
there was a sense of urgency. Their attitude has been very good all
along.''
</P>
<P>
   After dropping a 13-10 game to Marshall in the season-opener,
Clemson rebounded with a 33-14 win over Virginia. A Thursday night
trip to Virginia Tech had the Hokies on the ropes for longer than
they probably expected. Trailing 14-3 in the fourth quarter,
Clemson faked going for three points and instead had placekicker
Tony Lazzara toss a short pass for a touchdown. Although the Tigers
fell 31-11, it cemented the growing faith players had in their new
coach and those he brought with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized they were winners everywhere they've been,'' said
All-American linebacker Keith Adams. ``They have helped put us in
position to win games.''
</P>
<P>
   When top-ranked Florida State arrived at Death Valley in October
with Bobby Bowden seeking career victory 300, his son wasn't about
to roll over easily. It took the strong, true leg of Sebastian
Janikowski and a last-minute field-goal miss by Clemson for the
Seminoles to escape with a 17-14 win.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, Tommy Bowden looks at Thursday's Peach Bowl date
as the first step toward the eventual goal of participating in the
Bowl Championship Series. Clemson fans haven't known such exalted
status since the Ford era, before there was such a thing as the
BCS. But Bowden is just a little bit too agile with his words to
offer a prediction for when that time may come.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, no, you're not going to get me on that one,'' he said.
``The Peach Bowl is a great bowl game, but I can't afford to come
back three or four times. Then there'll be a new guy.''

 &HT;    Gregory key to Tech's success
 &HT;    By J.C. Clemons
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ Of course, Joe Hamilton is the reason the
Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets are ranked No. 17 and playing a New
Year's Day bowl game for the second year in a row.
</P>
<P>
   And yes, Hamilton, the consensus All-American quarterback and
Heisman Trophy runner-up is the main cog in the nation's leading
offense that cranked out 509 yards and 40.7 points a game.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, a strong case can be made that Tech (8-3) probably would
not be playing Miami in the Gator Bowl on Saturday were it not for
Sean Gregory, who began the season on the third team but spent the
campaign as the Jackets' featured back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just prepared at the time I needed to be prepared,''
said Gregory, who gained 837 yards despite starting six games. ``I
wasn't surprised by how well I did; I was just happy.''
</P>
<P>
   So was Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the highlight reels that focus mainly on Hamilton
connecting with speedy receivers Kelly Campbell, Dez White and
Kerry Watkins, the offense designed by Ralph Friedgen places a
premium on making foes concentrate on stopping the run.
</P>
<P>
   Once teams commit to eight or nine players close to the line of
scrimmage, the field opens for Hamilton &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   But first, the Jackets had to establish the run, and they did.
Tech finished the season ranked 17th nationally in passing (283.4
ypg) and 13th in rushing (225.6).
</P>
<P>
   With Hamilton's play-calling, that balanced attack was able to
keep opponents on their heels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hamilton has an uncanny knack of getting them into the right
play,'' Duke coach Carl Franks said. ``You don't know what to
expect from them.''
</P>
<P>
   After tailback Joe Burns fractured his leg against Florida State
in the second game, Gregory began sharing duties with Phillip
Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   In his first outing, Gregory rushed for 150 yards and two
touchdowns against Central Florida. Three games later, Rogers was
lost for the season after undergoing emergency surgery to relieve
internal bleeding surrounding a deep thigh bruise.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the job was all Gregory's, and the 6-0, 211-pound
sophomore from Homewood, Ill., would go on to crack the century
mark four more times.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing Sean does, he runs extremely hard,'' Tech
running backs coach Bill O'Brien said. ``He understands that, to be
a great running back, you have to break tackles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always knew he could do some great things.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yellow Jackets also had big things in mind for themselves.
But visions of another top 10 finish _ and a legitimate shot at a
Bowl Championship Series berth _ went up in smoke with late-season
losses to Virginia and Wake Forest.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory said ending the season with victories over rival Georgia
and the resurgent Hurricanes would make for a more pleasant winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We reached some of our goals _ especially beating Georgia for
the second year in a row,'' Gregory said. ``All things considered,
with a lot of injuries and a young defense, it has been a good
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Miami is on the rise, and they're hungry,'' he said.
``Winning a game like that would be great for us.''

LAWN-CARE GENE  
 ENGINE'S MIXED RESULTS  
 QUICKER PICTURES

   Lawn-Care Gene
</P>
<P>
   It's a suburban homeowner's fantasy: a lawn that grows to a
certain height and no higher, and never needs mowing. That dream
may become a reality someday, with the recent discovery of a gene
that appears to control the production of an important growth
hormone in plants.
</P>
<P>
   The gene, known as BAS-1 and isolated from Arabidopsis, a weed
that is a member of the mustard family, works to break down the
hormone, a steroid called brassinolide. The discovery was made by
scientists at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in
California and colleagues in Japan and was reported in a recent
issue of The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   The hormone is found throughout the plant, but the researchers
discovered that the gene acts selectively to break it down in
different kinds of tissues, with the effect most noticeable in the
stems. Tinkering with the gene may make it possible to stop growth
completely in the stems, say, while allowing normal growth in
leaves and flowers. So a homeowner may someday be able to choose a
lawn like a carpet: from fine to plush to shag.
</P>
<P>
   Now if scientists could just figure out how to get it in
something other than basic green.
</P>
<P>
   Engine's Mixed Results
</P>
<P>
   A new kind of rocket engine for the next generation of reusable
space vehicles has been tested at full power for the first time.
The 18-second test of what is known as a linear aerospike engine
was carried out on Dec. 18 at a NASA center in Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the engine performed well, though some erosion,
in the form of pinholes, was noticed on an inside wall of a thrust
chamber, a structure that replaces the bell-shaped nozzles of
conventional rocket engines.
</P>
<P>
   The aerospike engine is being developed to power the X-33, a
half-scale unmanned prototype of a rocket that would take off and
land like the space shuttle but would be completely reusable (the
shuttle's huge external fuel tank, among other components, is
expended in each flight).
</P>
<P>
   NASA officials said that the erosion found after the test was
within the range expected for an engine under development and would
not slow the testing process. That's a good thing, as the X-33, a
cooperative project involving NASA, Lockheed Martin Corp.'s Skunk
Works division and other contractors, is at least a year behind
schedule and above its $1.2 billion budget.
</P>
<P>
   The engine, which is being developed by the Rocketdyne division
of Boeing Corp., has been plagued by development bugs, including a
major problem in bonding metallic parts of the thrust chambers. And
an effort to test-fire a small version of the engine was abandoned
after three years (and $27 million) because of persistent fuel
leaks.
</P>
<P>
   Quicker Pictures
</P>
<P>
   In the basic photographic process, film coated with an emulsion
of crystals containing silver ions is exposed to light. The photons
of light make electrons move within the crystal lattice, and
``holes'' are created where the electrons were.
</P>
<P>
   The free electrons then convert some of the ions to silver
atoms, eventually creating the plain silver metal that makes up the
dark spots on the negative. Pretty simple, but pretty inefficient.
Much of the time, the work of the photon is for naught: The
electron and its ``hole'' quickly recombine.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, it takes about 10 to 30 photons to convert enough
silver ions to atoms within a crystal so that it will become silver
metal during developing. Now French scientists have found a more
efficient method: doping the emulsion with formate ions. These ions
act as scavengers in the exposure process, quickly absorbing holes
before they can recombine with an electron.
</P>
<P>
   So just a couple of photons, instead of 10 to 30, are sufficient
to produce a silver particle. The development, reported in Nature,
may lead to films that create clearer low-light images and work at
much faster speeds.

   _ German director  &UR; Wim Wenders &LR;  told the Sydney Morning Herald
that although his movies are popular in English-speaking countries,
even fans have a hard time saying his name. ``The first time I
heard my name pronounced correctly was at a Yankee game in New

There was a message through the loudspeakers, `This is a message

look _ including breaking off a branch, taking it outside and
setting it on fire _ and demanded that the tree be dismantled
``under his watchful eye.''
</P>
<P>
   After the deed was done, he left, saying he had a long list of
neighborhood businesses with trees that needed inspecting; but when
he got outside, he couldn't get his car started. Whereupon the
newspaper staff refused to let him use the phone to call for help.
</P>
<P>
   And so it came to pass that at 11:30 a.m., ``the fire department
vehicle was towed,'' says the Reporter.

</P>
<P>
   Also, F3, a new grocery store in Manhattan, sells nothing but
products ``for dieters without willpower.'' In addition to the
groceries, an on-site nutritionist ``will scold you if you dare to
mix your carbs and proteins.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, ``model-actress, Earth-worshipper and real-life witch''
 &UR; Jacqueline Collen &LR; , who (to provide a full resume) was once married
to a member of Def Leppard, is out with the Medieval Bath &AMP; Body
Collection, a bath line special because it was designed by a witch.
She says the products have ``no spells attached.''
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, this historic note: At a recent auction of
 &UR; Marilyn Monroe &LR; 's belongings at Christie's, designer  &UR; Tommy &LR;

GEORGE W. LETS THE GOOD TIMES ROLL

 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   Those continentals know how to have a good time, and  &UR; George &LR; 
 &UR; W. Bush &LR;  isn't gonna stop them.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican presidential contender told the conservative
National Review that if elected, he will reverse  &UR; Bill &LR;  and
 &UR; Hillary Clinton &LR; 's dictum and allow guests to smoke in the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would not bother me,'' he said, when asked about European
guests who had been told they couldn't smoke in the Clinton White
House. ``I mean, if a guest of mine came and wanted to smoke? No,
that wouldn't bother me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, guests come in and smoke at the governor's mansion.
They say, `Can I have a smoke?' Sure.''
</P>
<P>

   &UR; FLASH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _ Oakland Mayor  &UR; Jerry Brown &LR; , interviewed by  &UR; Vicki Liviakis &LR; 
for ``Evening Magazine,'' walked along the water at Jack London
Square and waxed poetic, comparing his city to Hong Kong. ``We're
not nirvana yet,'' said the mayor, ``but we're getting there.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Maybe  &UR; Celine Dion &LR;  knows:  &UR; Bud Johns &LR;  is pondering why the
Australian lamb at Trader Joe's is labeled ``Product of Canada.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Having a nice holiday break? A German psychologist cited in
Discover magazine found that three weeks of mental inactivity can
cause IQ to drop by as much as 20 points.
</P>
<P>
   _ Reading in Personals last week about the Barbie doll- &UR; Joan of &LR; 
 &UR; Arc &LR;  incident behind the Echo Ridge school,  &UR; Liz Stevens &LR;  suggests
it was a holiday Barbie Q.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Catherine Zeta-Jones &LR;  flew to England unexpectedly to be with
her family for Christmas, and the British tabloids are atwitter
about her possible breakup with  &UR; Michael Douglas. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _ German director  &UR; Wim Wenders &LR;  told the Sydney Morning Herald
that although his movies are popular in English-speaking countries,
even fans have a hard time saying his name. ``The first time I
heard my name pronounced correctly was at a Yankee game in New
York, when all of a sudden I felt someone was talking to me. ...
There was a message through the loudspeakers, `This is a message
for all the stadium vendors,' and I jumped up and said, `Hey,
that's me!' ''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NOEL, NOEL &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Allen White  &LR; forwards the Bay Area Reporter tale of a fire
inspector who came to the paper's premises at 10 a.m. on the
morning of December 21, gave the office Christmas tree a careful
look _ including breaking off a branch, taking it outside and
setting it on fire _ and demanded that the tree be dismantled
``under his watchful eye.''
</P>
<P>
   After the deed was done, he left, saying he had a long list of
neighborhood businesses with trees that needed inspecting; but when
he got outside, he couldn't get his car started. Whereupon the
newspaper staff refused to let him use the phone to call for help.
</P>
<P>
   And so it came to pass that at 11:30 a.m., ``the fire department
vehicle was towed,'' says the Reporter.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HOW TO LOOK GREAT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Fashion and beauty notes from the latest issue of W:
</P>
<P>
   ``Feng shui master and jewelry designer''  &UR; Carol Meltzer  &LR; is out
with sports chi-om bracelets, beaded wrist wear to improve one's
game. She told the magazine that her husband's golf game had
improved very much since wearing one.
</P>
<P>
   Also, F3, a new grocery store in Manhattan, sells nothing but
products ``for dieters without willpower.'' In addition to the
groceries, an on-site nutritionist ``will scold you if you dare to
mix your carbs and proteins.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, ``model-actress, Earth-worshipper and real-life witch''
 &UR; Jacqueline Collen &LR; , who (to provide a full resume) was once married
to a member of Def Leppard, is out with the Medieval Bath &AMP; Body
Collection, a bath line special because it was designed by a witch.
She says the products have ``no spells attached.''
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, this historic note: At a recent auction of
 &UR; Marilyn Monroe &LR; 's belongings at Christie's, designer  &UR; Tommy &LR; 
 &UR; Hilfiger &LR;  paid $37,000 for three pairs of jeans the star wore in
``River of No Return.'' The jeans were bought at J.C. Penney in
1953 for $2.29 a pair.
</P>
<P>
   P.S. InStyle editor  &UR; Hal Rubenstein  &LR; told Paper magazine of his
hopes for 2000: ``A way to moisturize your own back.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHO SAID WHAT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the pockets in back look weird and wrong _ I don't care.
Maybe they don't make your butt look so great, but somehow the way
they are placed is redefining what a pocket on a jean means.''
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &LR; Caroline Parent, creative director for Levi Strauss in
Brussels, about Levi's new Red jeans, which Metropolis magazine
says ``could be mistaken for, say, a street vendor in a former
Soviet-bloc village's sorry attempt to re-create the American
classic. ... The post-modern version of the master denim company.''

ERA OF INNOVATION IS SEEN FOR MAJOR PATRON OF BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., Colo., Mass.)  (See also SCI-HUGHES-CECH which has moved with NYT10, a photo of
Cech) 
(The Science Times) (DW) 
 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Thomas R. Cech is about to acquire a whole clutch of new
friends. On Jan. 1, the 51-year-old chemist from the University of
Colorado in Boulder will become the president of the Howard Hughes
Medical Institute and chief dispenser of the fortune that Howard
Hughes protected for 23 years, using the institute as a shelter
from taxational erosion.
</P>
<P>
   The institute's affairs are keenly followed by university
biologists because it has become a famously generous patron of
academic biomedical research. The winners of a Hughes award can
count on $500,000 to $2 million a year in support of their
research. The Hughes largesse is distributed to 71 universities
around the country, freeing some 309 favored scientists from the
chore of writing voluminous grant requests to the National
Institutes of Health, the chief federal patron of biomedical
research.
</P>
<P>
   Cech (pronounced like check), chosen by a board of trustees that
includes two former chieftains of the Hughes empire, Frank W. Gay
and William R. Lummis, as well as former Secretary of State James
Baker III, is reserved about his plans, saying he supports the bulk
of present policies and that ``the board hasn't hired me to clean
house.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, conversations with Cech and the biologist he has chosen
as his deputy, Dr. Gerald Rubin of the University of California,
Berkeley, suggest they intend to propel both the institute and its
investigators into taking greater risks.
</P>
<P>
   The Howard Hughes Medical Institute in Bethesda, Md., has
emerged only recently from its shadowy role as a tax shelter to
become a major player in biological research. During Hughes'
lifetime, it served to shield the income of its main asset, the
Hughes Aircraft Co., giving only token amounts to medical research.
The institute's first head was Dr. Verne Mason, a physician who
tried to wean Hughes off the morphine to which he became addicted
after burns and injuries suffered in a 1946 plane crash.
</P>
<P>
   The eccentricities Hughes developed are well known: he harbored
a miscellany of hatreds, for the Internal Revenue Service,
Communists, nuclear tests, germs, doctors and relatives. He spent
most of the day naked, watching the same movies over and over.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes was addicted to codeine and gripped by so morbid a fear
of microbes that he instructed his aides, in one memorandum, to
handle his hearing device ``using a minimum of 15 Kleenexes. . . .
If necessary to use both hands, then 15 Kleenexes for each hand,''
James R. Phelan and Lewis Chester say in ``The Money,'' a 1997 book
about the disposition of Hughes' wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes died in 1976, leaving no will. It took nearly a decade of
litigation and the rejection of many concocted testaments before
the institute was declared his chief beneficiary. It is a
``monument to Hughes himself,'' Phelan and Chester write, ``a
bizarre one perhaps for a man who variously humiliated his own
medical advisers by ignoring them or turning them into drug
suppliers, who pursued his bizarre health rituals to a point that
devastated and laid waste his own body, and who viewed medical
research as a useful cover for fiddling his tax. But it is,
nonetheless, a monument built to last.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, the institute sold the Hughes Aircraft Co. to General
Motors for $5.2 billion, and for the first time gained control of
its own money and started to support medical research seriously. In
1987, its first president in its born-again mode was forced to
resign after his wife was found to have established a large
unauthorized account at a furniture store.
</P>
<P>
   The institute is now ending its first period of calmer
governance. Under the presidency of Dr. Purnell W. Choppin, its
endowment has grown to $12 billion, giving it $465 million to spend
this fiscal year on biomedical research. Although that is only 5
percent of the National Institutes of Health's grant-giving budget,
the Hughes institute's influence is greater than it may seem
because it supports many of the country's leading researchers.
</P>
<P>
   At first sight, the net effect of the Hughes institute's taking
over support for many top NIH researchers has merely been that the
institutes have been able to finance a bottom tier of researchers
who would not otherwise have made the cut. But the Hughes money
seems to have had a powerful effect on many recipients, freeing
them to take on chancier projects than they would have dared under
the NIH.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the Hughes largesse has enabled academic biologists to use
more expensive research methods. ``NIH loses interest in funding
people when they get to $500,000 a year; that's a bit of a glass
ceiling,'' Cech said. Hughes-supported researchers can pay without
blanching at the high costs of maintaining germ-free mouse colonies
or buying Affymetrix chips for analyzing gene expression.
</P>
<P>
   The Hughes institute's new team, Cech and Rubin, are
Hughes-financed researchers. Cech discovered that RNA, a chemical
relative of DNA, can act as a biological catalyst, a finding
pertinent to the origin of life. Rubin, a leading expert on the
laboratory fruitfly, recently helped oversee the decoding of its
entire DNA, or genome. Following a new fashion among scientific
administrators, both intend to work part-time in their labs.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Cech nor Rubin has the medical qualifications that might
be expected for directors of a medical institute. Will it matter
that neither is an M.D.?
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have an impact without having those two little letters
after our names,'' Cech said. Other university biologists are
pleased with their appointment. ``The choice of Cech and Rubin was
brilliant and is applauded by the academic community,'' said Dr.
Arnold J. Levine, president of Rockefeller University.
</P>
<P>
   The two scientists are considering capping the number of the
researchers Hughes will support at perhaps 350, and using any extra
money that becomes available as the endowment grows to finance
special initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   One initiative undertaken by Choppin and his scientific
director, Dr. W. Maxwell Cowan, was to finance high resolution
X-ray crystallography, an especially expensive technique that has
proved invaluable for visualizing the fine structure of important
biological molecules.
</P>
<P>
   Although the NIH has various ways of encouraging new fields of
research, it is often slow to move, whereas the Hughes institute
can act quickly and go in any direction its leaders favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree we should be cognizant about how we can be more
risk-taking than we are,'' Cech said. ``If you have never fallen
down learning to ski, you aren't trying hard enough.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   He cited bioinformatics and functional genomics as two emerging
fields in which the institute might make special investments.
(Bioinformatics is the use of computer programs to analyze the
information in an organism's genome, such as which segments of DNA
specify genes; functional genomics means figuring out what the
genes in a genome do).
</P>
<P>
   Saying he was describing his personal views rather than
established Hughes institute policy, Rubin suggested that the
competition for Hughes research fellowships should be broadened
beyond the present system of university nominations, in which
``politics may not lead to the best candidates being put forward.''

   Cech said he had already arranged with Choppin to make Hughes
fellowships transferrable. Until now, Hughes-supported researchers
and universities trying to recruit them have been frustrated by the
so-called ``golden handcuffs'' _ the rule that scientists cannot
take Hughes awards with them.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if that might not lead in a few years to a high
concentration of Hughes researchers at Harvard and Stanford, Cech
said he hoped to preserve the geographic distribution of the
fellowships.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are great things happening in the middle part of the
country, I hope even including Boulder,'' he said. If an imbalance
develops, he added, ``We could have a competition where we say only
places without a Hughes investigatorship could nominate people.''
</P>
<P>
   Having enjoyed an overdue period of normality under Choppin and
Cowan, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute may be taking corners
faster under its new drivers.

`STRAVINSKY _ A CREATIVE SPRING': SO TOUCHY, AND ALWAYS RECASTING
HIMSELF 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(lb) 
 By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shortly before his death in 1929 the impresario Sergei Diaghilev
made an astute observation about Igor Stravinsky, the composer with
whom he had crossed swords regularly about artistic and financial
matters over the previous two decades, yet whose early career was
inextricably bound to Diaghilev's Ballets Russes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is constantly on the move,'' Diaghilev told a friend,
``seeking out at every step how to deny the very thing that he has
been in his previous works.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the impression that Stravinsky himself fostered, but it
was not only his musical past that he sought to deny. A leitmotif
in Stephen Walsh's ``Stravinsky _ A Creative Spring: Russia and
France 1882-1934,'' the first installment of a two-volume
biography, is that as hard as Stravinsky worked on his music, he
worked equally hard to compose and recompose his public persona.
</P>
<P>
   This recomposition, moreover, tended not to be benign. Crucial
aspects of his training and early life, for example, were later
declared to have been meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, although he was a devoted student of Rimsky-Korsakov and
insinuated himself into that composer's family life, he eventually
declared his teacher's works worthless and his influence
negligible. Friends and close collaborators, similarly, were
routinely repositioned as talentless obstructors of his work.
</P>
<P>
   He even repudiated his own artistic ideas, though they were
copiously documented in interviews and correspondence whenever he
had a philosophical change of heart.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that he had spoken passionately about the evocation
of primitive ritual in ``The Rite of Spring'' when the work was
new; once he hit on the absolutist notion that music should be
``objective'' rather than descriptive, and that his music was meant
to express nothing but itself, he insisted that his vividly
pictorial early ballets were pure music, nothing more or less.
</P>
<P>
   As Walsh's book amply demonstrates, Stravinsky's persistent
self-redefinition was an odd and hopeless preoccupation for someone
who had lived his life in the public eye since before he turned 30.
</P>
<P>
   It was inevitable that the contradictions inherent in his
continual recasting would call attention to themselves; indeed,
Stravinsky's recasting of his past, whether through a faulty memory
or outright falsification, has long been evident to readers of his
1934 autobiography and the several volumes of conversations that
Robert Craft, Stravinsky's longtime assistant, published in the
1950s and '60s.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, only since the fall of the Soviet Union has it been
possible to paint a full picture of Stravinsky's early life, thanks
to a trove of documents, memoirs, correspondence and studies not
previously accessible to Western biographers. They throw a harsh
light on Stravinsky's efforts to recreate his past; in particular,
they blow away the dust that Stravinsky kicked over the traces of
his borrowings from Russian folk materials.
</P>
<P>
   The first author to make full use of these materials in an
examination of Stravinsky's musical and personal roots was Richard
Taruskin, whose comprehensive and well-argued ``Stravinsky and the
Russian Traditions'' was published three years ago. But although
there is ample biography in Taruskin's two-volume work, its primary
focus is the music, and at that, its 1,758 pages take the reader
only as far as ``Mavra,'' the opera Stravinsky completed in 1922.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh, a critic and musicologist who teaches at Cardiff
University in Wales, leans heavily on Taruskin's work, and
sometimes takes issue with it (though not as regularly as he
challenges Craft's writings on Stravinsky). But his book is written
for a less specialized audience. There are no musical examples, and
what musical discussion there is mostly avoids technical terms.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the book is by no means unscholarly. There are 132 pages of
footnotes, most of them source references. No quotations and few
assertions pass without one, although quite a few expand upon (or
even update) the findings in Walsh's text.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh is at his most engaging in the early chapters, in which he
provides enough detail about Stravinsky's surroundings _ social
customs as well as mundane details of life _ to give the reader the
flavor of late-19th-century St. Petersburg and the various country
estates where the Stravinsky family spent its summers.
</P>
<P>
   He fills out the family picture expansively as well, although a
genealogical chart would have been helpful to readers less
conversant with Russian names and diminutives.
</P>
<P>
   Often he seems out to take Stravinsky down a peg, although one
can't help feeling that Stravinsky brought this on himself. The
evidence, after all, shows that Stravinsky's sour reminiscences
were often both incorrect and unfair, and Walsh sometimes seems
intent on rescuing the composer's victims. Writing about the degree
to which Stravinsky's parents encouraged his musical activities, he
describes Stravinsky's claim that his parents did not recognize his
talent as ``a calumny against their memory.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh lightens up as Stravinsky's career takes off, although he
never allows the composer to redefine himself or his attitudes
without quoting his earlier (or later) positions.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the second part of the book becomes bogged down with
chronological details. Stravinsky is shown working on a new piece,
revising an old one (to extend its practical use and, therefore,
its earning potential), touring as a conductor or pianist,
squabbling with publishers, collaborators or Diaghilev, or pulling
strings on behalf of his sons, Theodore (a visual artist) and
Soulima (a pianist).
</P>
<P>
   A handful of tantalizing projects that Stravinsky considered but
did not undertake are mentioned _ ``David'' with Jean Cocteau;
incidental music for Shakespeare's ``Antony and Cleopatra,'' as
adapted by Andre Gide; ``Liturgie,'' a sacred work for Diaghilev;
and even a flamenco setting of ``The Barber of Seville.'' But the
nitty-gritty of the creative process is touched on only lightly.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The human side of the story is shown at a distance as well,
particularly after Stravinsky reaches 30. Early correspondence
conveys the tenderness of his relationship with Yekaterina Nosenko,
his first wife (and also his first cousin). But soon that side of
the story becomes merely a catalog of her illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Little of substance is said, for example, about how the frail
and increasingly religious Yekaterina dealt with her husband's open
romance with Vera Sudeykina during the last 20 years of their
marriage. Walsh only guesses that it must have been difficult for
both women.
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, he ascribes Stravinsky's own religious
fixations to feelings of guilt about the peculiarities of his
marital arrangements. That rings hollow: Here is a man who thinks
nothing of writing collaborators out of contracts, jettisoning
friends who are no longer useful and treating colleagues with an
unfeeling abrasiveness and lack of generosity.
</P>
<P>
   He is quoted making dozens of vehement anti-Semitic remarks,
some of them about musicians who had done much on his behalf, and
his response to the rise of Nazism was to write an obsequious
letter to his German agent averring that there were no Jews in his
family tree.
</P>
<P>
   He does not emerge from these pages as a man susceptible to
twinges of conscience. The Stravinsky that Walsh paints was too
self-absorbed and opportunistic for that, supremely creative though
he may have been.

HOSPITALS (Phoenix) - Phoenix area hospitals are swamped - with the
flu. Scottsdale Healthcare Osborn set a record Sunday - seeing 182
patients, the majority of which had the flu. Some hospitals advise
people with flu symptoms to come on in, while others advise
patients to see their family doctors first. One reason is patients
feel so horrible with this strain of the flu they think they could
die and wonder, `What if this isn't the flu?` says one hospital

CURTIS MAYFIELD, 57; CONSCIENCE OF SOUL MUSIC DEAD AT 57 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Drops reference to Steppenwolf as a performer of ``Pusherman,'' in
3rd graf; a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Curtis Mayfield, a ghetto-born poet who became soul music's
social conscience and stayed a spiritual force even after he was
paralyzed in a stage accident in 1990, died Sunday in an Atlanta
hospital. He was 57.
</P>
<P>
   No reason was given for his death. He had been weak for months
and was unable to attend his induction into the Rock and Roll Hall
of Fame in New York in March. Rapper Puff Daddy inducted him at
that event, praising his ``sense of the holy and the sting of the
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Mayfield, a mainstay of the Chicago vocal group the
Impressions before turning solo, wrote some of R &AMP; B's most famous
songs. Among them are ``People Get Ready'' (which also became the
``Amazing Grace'' of the pop world, sung by everyone from Rod
Stewart to Bob Marley), ``Gypsy Woman,'' and his '70s soundtrack
hits, ``Superfly'' and ``Freddie's Dead,'' which have been sampled
by countless hip-hop artists from Puff Daddy to Ice-T. Mr. Mayfield
also wrote ``Pusherman,'' about the dead-end world of drug
hustling.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Mayfield was a prime musical voice of the civil rights
movement, starting with 1964's ``Keep On Pushing,'' a Top Ten hit
on both R &AMP; B and pop radio stations. His other socially conscious
songs during that era included ``We're a Winner,'' ``This is My
Country,'' and ``Choice of Colors.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Mayfield was a silky-smooth singer whose falsetto was
immediately identifiable on the radio for many years. He reached
his commercial peak in 1972 with the ``Superfly'' soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1942, Mr. Mayfield grew up in Chicago's infamous
Cabrini-Green projects, where he shared one room with his mother
and five siblings. One younger brother was retarded and Mr.
Mayfield took special care of him until the boy died of an enlarged
heart at age 18.
</P>
<P>
   Trained in church singing, Mr. Mayfield took that gospel-infused
sound into the Impressions, where he shared vocal duties with Jerry
Butler. The Impressions had a falling-out which prompted Mr.
Mayfield to turn solo, but they reunited for a memorable 1983 tour
that came to the Berklee Performance Center. The show started an
hour late because Mr. Mayfield had a bad cold and lay sick in his
hotel, but he rallied and gave a mesmerizing performance.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Mayfield was also a poet of the heart, writing such tenderly
beautiful love songs as ``Woman's Got Soul'' and ``I'm So Proud.''
Everything he did showed consummate style and a poet's touch.
</P>
<P>
   The positive thinking that lay at his core was never more
evident than after the freak accident that left him paralyzed in
1990 _ when a lighting truss fell on him during a thunderstorm at a
free Brooklyn concert. He never indulged in self-pity _ and he even
made another album in 1996, ``New World Order,'' recorded while
lying on his back.
</P>
<P>
   The album featured the songs ``Back to Living Again'' and ``Oh
So Beautiful,'' with the verse, ``Never forget the life we live is
oh so beautiful.'' Nominated for two Grammys, it didn't win, but
Eric Clapton, who won three Grammys that year, interrupted his
acceptance speech to say that Mr. Mayfield's album was his personal
favorite of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all human beings, so we can get angry or bitter or mad,
but for me it doesn't last too long,'' Mr. Mayfield told the Globe
when the album came out. ``I'd rather be humble and cry tears of
joy than to take on the stress and burdens of being dogged out and
negative.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Mayfield leaves his wife, Altheida, along with ten children,
two sisters, a brother, and seven grandchildren. Funeral
arrangements have not been announced.

IN PANAMA CANAL DISPLAY, ENGINEERS GET THE GLORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By RENWICK McLEAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As interest in the Panama Canal began to focus this
year on its impending transfer out of United States hands and the
geopolitics involved, scholars at the Smithsonian Institution began
to lament that something important was being overlooked. Lost in
the hoopla was an appreciation of the canal as an engineering feat.
</P>
<P>
   What former President Jimmy Carter handed over to Panamanian
President Mireya Moscoso on Dec. 14 with the simple words ``It's
yours''is the subject of ``Making the Dirt Fly,'' an exhibition at
the National Museum of American History here. Though the 50.7-mile
canal was heralded a century ago as a symbol of progress and a boon
to promoting commerce and uniting nations, the aim of this
exhibition is to show the canal as a marvel of scientific and
engineering achievement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the debate right now has focused on the political
issues, and we wanted to put that in context,'' said William E.
Worthington Jr., the curator of the exhibition, which opened this
fall and runs through Jan. 5, 2001. ``The canal is the masterpiece
of engineering work, and we thought it should be explained.''
</P>
<P>
   The political overtones of the transfer have not been ignored. A
much smaller exhibition, ``Panama's Canal: Dawn of a New Era,''
explains the details of the transfer and the debate about its
significance. But it was placed on another floor and assigned a
different curator to keep it separate from the larger exhibition in
the minds of visitors, Worthington said.
</P>
<P>
   Construction of the Panama Canal was begun in 1881 by a private
French company, which struggled with the project for more than two
decades before selling it to the U.S. government. The work lasted
more than 30 years, took an estimated 20,000 lives and cost more
than $600 million. Building a waterway that connected the Atlantic
and Pacific Oceans posed an array of problems, from
disease-carrying mosquitoes to stubborn rock, from construction
accidents to hot and humid weather.
</P>
<P>
   The curators faced the challenge of showing all this in one
room. ``The Panama Canal was built in an area of about 500 square
miles,'' Worthington said. ``We had 800 square feet.''
</P>
<P>
   To get around space limitations, the curators turned to pointed
descriptions. The exhibition's brochure, for example, explains that
``the total soil excavated from the canal would build a pyramid
4,200 feet high,'' about triple the height of the Empire State
Building. The exhibition can be seen on the Internet at:
www.sil.si.edu/Exhibitions/Make-the-Dirt-Fly
</P>
<P>
   It was organized by the Smithsonian Institution Libraries, a
lesser-known arm of the Smithsonian that serves the research needs
of its curators and the public. Each year the libraries choose a
topic for their modest display area in a corner of the National
Museum of American History. The exhibitions allow the libraries to
present their work to the public, said Nancy L. Matthews, their
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the items in the Panama Canal display are from the
libraries' collections. These include sketches, photographs, books
and manuscripts from well before the first shovel split the earth
to August 1914, when the canal opened.
</P>
<P>
   One conspicuous exception is at the entrance, where visitors are
greeted by a 70-ton dipper from one of the steam shovels that
worked on the canal. The dipper came from Bucyrus International
Inc., the company that provided 77 of the 102 steam shovels used to
dig the canal. Bucyrus is the principal supporter of the
exhibition, which is financed entirely by private donations.
</P>
<P>
   The dipper has been left worn and dirty to illustrate the rigors
of its work in Panama, said Linda J. Edmondson, a spokeswoman for
Bucyrus. Smithsonian curators tried for a similar effect when they
designed the rest of the exhibition. The patterns and colors of the
floor, for instance, are intended to evoke the feeling of being in
the jungle and working in the mud.
</P>
<P>
   Although the working conditions might have been muddy and
miserable in Panama, the living conditions were considered
comfortable, at least from 1904 on during the American period of
construction. Workers enjoyed plenty of food, good schools for
their children and housing with electricity, a rarity at the time
back home in the United States. To the engineers running the
project, life on the job and at home formed part of the same
fabric. ``A healthy and happy work force would ensure that the job
was done on time,'' Worthington explained.
</P>
<P>
   Besides raising worker morale, leaders of the American effort
proved adept at controlling malaria and yellow fever, which had
wiped out French laborers. A section of the exhibition titled
``Waging War on Mosquitoes'' describes how the Americans, armed
with recent medical research showing that mosquitoes transmitted
the diseases, avoided the fate that forced the French to abandon
the project.
</P>
<P>
   When John F. Stevens became chief engineer of the American
effort in 1905 he ordered a halt to all construction until the
mosquitoes were controlled. Workers searched out mosquito breeding
grounds and sprayed them with a thin layer of oil, suffocating the
insects' larvae. They covered windows and doorways with nets and
cut down field after field of tall grasses. After 18 months of
determined effort, the diseases were under control, and
construction resumed.
</P>
<P>
   If a tiny insect had not been contained, Ms. Matthews said,
perhaps one of the nation's largest engineering feats might never
have been accomplished.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Every once in a while that waitress serving you
coffee really does become a star. That's what is happening to Amy
Spanger, whose theater-district resume includes more than one stint
at McHale's at Eighth Avenue and 46th Street.
</P>
<P>
   These days Ms. Spanger, 28, is working one block south of
McHale's and just west of Eighth, at the Martin Beck Theater, where
she has received critical and audience acclaim for her performance
as Lois Lane, the freewheeling and easy-living cabaret singer
turned thespian in the hit Broadway revival of the 1948 Cole
Porter-Sam and Bella Spewack musical, ``Kiss Me, Kate.''
</P>
<P>
   Ben Brantley in The New York Times hailed Ms. Spanger as a
``fresh young star in the making'' who gets three of the evening's
best songs (``Why Can't You Behave?,'' ``Tom, Dick or Harry'' and
``Always True to You'') and ``lands each of them with a sharp-edged
sensuality that turns her gold-digging archetype into something
newly minted.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in her publicist's office, Ms. Spanger, a native of
Newbury, Mass., remembered the morning after opening night in
mid-November when, after seven years on the theater scene in New
York doing what so many others do in their attempt to make it in
show business, she achieved her overnight success.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family was in town, and we all had breakfast together,''
she said. ``I hadn't seen the papers. I woke up really late. My
boyfriend came over. My brother was there, and my parents. We all
read the reviews together. Everyone was just so happy. They said,
`You finally got your break.' I got so many phone calls. My
dressing room was filled with flowers. It was a dream. It still is.
I feel like Cinderella.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Kiss Me, Kate'' stars Brian Stokes Mitchell and Marin Mazzie
as Fred Graham and Lilli Vanessi, divorced actors who get together
again to try out a new musical in Baltimore based on Shakespeare's
``Taming of the Shrew.'' The director is Michael Blakemore and the
choreographer Kathleen Marshall. ``They took a chance on me,'' Ms.
Spanger said. ``I hadn't done a lot of work in New York. And I'm so
grateful.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Spanger's dream began in Newbury, a small town north of
Boston, where she grew up the middle child of three. ``I don't have
the accent,'' she said. ``I lost it. My parents have it, though.''
Her father, Stephen Sr., is the head of guidance at a high school;
her mother, Nancy, is the director of sales for a cosmetics
company.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Spanger always performed in school plays, among them a
musical ``Christmas Carol'' in the sixth grade, playing a female
Scrooge. She started training as a dancer at 16 _ ``kind of late,''
she said _ and after high school attended the University of
Massachusetts as a theater major. ``But I dropped out after a
year,'' she said. ``I didn't like being in the classroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Where she wanted to be was New York, to follow a classic route
from small town to success in the big city. So, seven years ago, at
age 21, she found a roommate and moved to 108th Street and
Broadway. ``I knew one person in New York,'' she said. ``I met her
at a party and moved in with her. My parents put the furniture from
my bedroom at home into the back of a truck and took me to
Manhattan. I started waiting tables, going to auditions, taking
dance and acting classes, studying voice. And within two and a half
months I got my first stage job.''
</P>
<P>
   That first gig was as Cassie in a regional-theater production of
``A Chorus Line.'' Next came dinner theater in Westchester, then a
bus-and-truck tour of ``A Chorus Line,'' then a small role as a
cockney newsboy in a production of ``Jekyll and Hyde.'' Then she
was hired as an understudy on Broadway _ for the role of Betty
Schaefer, the pretty young screenwriter who makes Norma Desmond
jealous in ``Sunset Boulevard.'' ``I went on a couple of times,''
Ms. Spanger said. ``It was my first Broadway show.''
</P>
<P>
   She did a workshop in Toronto on an early version of ``Fosse.''
Then she auditioned for the first national tour of ``Rent.'' ``When
I got back from Toronto, I didn't have a job,'' she said. ``So I
started waiting tables again at McHale's,'' a mecca for Broadway
stagehands. ``I worked at McHale's on and off for about a year.
It's an easy place to work. Burgers and beers.''
</P>
<P>
   This time the waiting on tables was short term. ``The first day
back I got `Rent.' So I left.'' After ``Rent'' came ``Chicago,'' a
small role on Broadway, understudying Roxie Hart and Velma, and
eventually playing Roxie in the national tour for three months.
``And then I got `Kiss Me, Kate.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Spanger auditioned for ``Kiss Me, Kate'' more than once,
beginning about a year ago. ``I had what I thought was a great
audition, and they brought me back four or five months later,'' she
said. ``I remember seeing Sharon Lawrence at the audition and
thinking that she's going to get it. And she did. But then her TV
series was picked up, so they had me come in and audition again.
And I went back and nailed it.'' (The series for Ms. Lawrence,
known on television as the wife of Detective Andy Sipowicz on
``NYPD Blue,'' was ``Ladies' Man'' on CBS.)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Spanger said she loved the character of Lois, the second
banana to Lilli, and she doubles as Bianca in the ``Kiss Me, Kate''
version of ``Shrew'' and uses time-honored ways to get ahead but is
always true to her men, in her fashion. ``I had a great time
researching her,'' she said. ``I watched a bunch of Judy Holliday
films to get the feeling for that kind of edgy ingenue, someone
lacking in craft but who gets away with a lot nonetheless. She uses
her sexuality to her advantage, but it's a survival mechanism. She
sleeps with guys to get ahead, and she doesn't see anything wrong
with it. It's just how she's approached life.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing 5 feet 5 inches, Ms. Spanger has blue eyes and blond
hair with streaks of black. Her fingernails are painted an orangey
red with pink and gold flecks. ``This is my Lois color,'' she said.
``It's very garish.'' Onstage as Lois, her hair is red, a wig
created, she said, ``because they wanted to have a very distinct
contrast between Marin's blond hair and me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My initial idea, from seeing all the classic ditzes, was that
Lois should be platinum blond, maybe short and kinky hair,'' she
said. ``But the second I put on the wig and costumes I felt, there
she is. It made total sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Spanger said she adored the wit and sophistication of the
Porter lyrics and how perfectly they defined Lois' character, but
she wants to be clear: Lois and she are not alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a similarity between us in that she's more street
smart than book smart,'' she said. ``And at times I can be a bit of
a ditz, and I can be a total goof. But I think I'm a pretty equal
combination of goofball and very serious person. And I also think I
have an ability to laugh at myself, which is important in this
business because it can get to be such a grind, with people
constantly telling you no. It's important to be able to laugh at
them and laugh at yourself.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Spanger, who still lives on the Upper West Side, has classic
goals: television and movies and more theater. ``I'd love to play
Charity in `Sweet Charity' and Sally Bowles in `Cabaret,''' she
said. ``And I've always pictured myself having a television variety
show like Tracey Ullman's, doing all those different characters.''
</P>
<P>
   She would like to marry and eventually be a mother. Her
boyfriend of three years is an actor. ``It's like a roller coaster,
us both being in this business,'' she said. ``But we're both
becoming more established, so it gets a little bit easier. There's
more money, and we're both working in the city now.'' (She won't
mention his name, she said, because ``we want to keep our
identities separate.'')
</P>
<P>
   Is he a candidate for husband? ``I think so,'' she said. ``Yeah.
He's a great guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the future holds, personally or professionally, it's
clear that Ms. Spanger, unlike Lois, won't settle for any Tom, Dick
or Harry _ Tom, Harry or Dick.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ In another day of furious street fighting in Grozny,
Chechnya's capital, Russian forces made halting progress. But they
also stepped up attacks on guerrilla strongholds in Chechnya's
mountainous southern region where many of the rebel fighters have
fled.
</P>
<P>
   The federal assault on Grozny has been taking place in piecemeal
fashion, as Russian troops probe the city's outer neighborhoods,
dodging land mines and trading artillery fire with guerrillas holed
up in trenches and basements.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of civilians remain trapped in the city,
without heat or electricity and in fear for their lives, after
federal authorities said their safe exit could no longer be
guaranteed as the long-awaited assault of Grozny got underway last
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   No large tank units have yet gone into the city, federal
military spokesmen said Monday. But reporters inside the city said
street battles are taking place, with clashes between federal
forces and a special Chechen squad, known as the Wolves, reported
in a southwestern neighborhood of the city.
</P>
<P>
   The Chechen president, Aslan Maskhadov, vowed Monday that his
rebel fighters would defend the bombed out ruins of Grozny to the
last man.
</P>
<P>
   Bislan Guntemirov, a former mayor of Grozny who has joined the
federal forces, said Monday that his Chechen militiamen had taken
control of the northwestern district of Staropromyslovskya, and
would now move on to the city center.
</P>
<P>
   But a Russian news agency said sources close to Gantemirov, a
convicted embezzler released from federal prison in the early days
of the war, were less optimistic after clashes with rebel fighters.
Such furious resistance came as surprise for the volunteers,
Interfax quoted the Chechen militiamen as saying.
</P>
<P>
   A report on NTV, a privately owned Russian television network,
said the battle would soon move to Garibaldi Street, where the
Chechen rebels have set up a fortified line of defense, cordoning
off the city center.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian military said Monday that only four federal
soldiers, three Russians and one Chechen, had been killed inside
Grozny, while Chechen rebel leaders said hundreds of Russian
soldiers had been killed. Neither account could be verified, given
the sketchy reporting available from the war zone.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Except for war, there is nothing here, said one Russian officer,
quoted Monday night on NTV, which showed pictures of federal forces
camped out in trenches seized from the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Western governments have been harshly critical of Russia's
conduct of the war, which the U.S. deputy secretary of state,
Strobe Talbott, said last week violated international norms.
</P>
<P>
   After a meeting Monday with President Boris Yeltsin, the Russian
foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, said the West's disagreement with
Russia's Chechnya policy should not be overdramatized.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our main task for 2000 is not to allow increased influence of
those forces which seek to isolate Russia, using Chechnya as a
pretext,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a New Year's greeting to President Clinton, Yeltsin agreed
that Russia's relations with the United States had not been easy
during the last year, and noted that it had required no small
effort to keep cooperation between the two countries on track.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Russian Ministry of Defense said Monday that 465 federal
troops have been killed in fighting in the Caucasus region, which
began last August when Russia launched an attack on Chechen
guerrilla fighters who had invaded the neighboring region of
Dagestan. By October, the war, which Moscow continues to call an
antiterrorist operation, had spread to Chechnya, where federal
forces moved quickly to occupy the region's northern half.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as Russian commanders press ahead for a decisive victory in
a war that has had broad public support, federal forces have kept
up an intense offensive against rebel strongholds in the southern
mountain region, with heavy fighting reported in the areas around
Karachoi and Vedeno.
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Zhuk, a spokesman for the Russian Defense Ministry, said
Monday that the battle for Grozny was not as significant as the
offensive in southern Chechnya. ``Grozny will soon be mopped up,
but it is not the matter of primary concern for us,'' Zhuk told The
Associated Press. He said that the most important thing for the
federal troops is the southern region, since the majority of the
rebels went there.
</P>
<P>
   According to news reports, Russian war planes were dropping
aerosol, or incendiary bombs, which release clouds of inflammable
gases and cause large explosions, as they tried to flush out the
rebel fighters from caves and bunkers in the southern mountains.
</P>
<P>
   NTV reported Monday night that the offensive had destroyed most
of the rebels' arms depots, and that the guerrillas themselves were
being driven deeper into the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   After a meeting in the Kremlin Monday with President Boris
Yeltsin, the Russian prime minister, Vladimir Putin, whose
popularity has soared because of Russia's success, so far, in the
war, said that the military offensive was going according to plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are doing what we promised we would do,'' said Putin.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In an interview published Monday in a Moscow newspaper, Evening
Moscow, Maskhadov said that Russia would never be able to claim
victory in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say the federal forces will take Grozny, he said.
``Let's say the Russian forces will also manage to take the
mountain border. What is next?''
</P>
<P>
   Reminding the Russian generals of their defeat in the 1994-1996
Chechen war, he said the federal forces could be bosses in Chechnya
only in those places where their forces were concentrated, and
nowhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Even Gudermes, Chechnya's second largest city, where Russian
forces moved in without a fight, cannot be considered to be under
Russian control, Maskhadov said. ``We left Gudermes ourselves,'' he
said. ``It had to be done. Have no doubt: if necessary we will
enter this city again.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Grozny, Maskhadov said the fight there would go to the
bitter end. ``You can imagine the mood among the majority of
fighting Chechens,'' he said. ``They are ready to fight as long as
needed and in any conditions.''

<P>
   PARIS _ Flights to the Ivory Coast resumed Monday after the
first coup in the country's 39 years of independence, and commuters
went to work more or less as usual, residents there said.
</P>
<P>
   The shoot-on-sight curfew was lifted and businesses operated
normally, but banks were forbidden to transfer money abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Raising hopes that democracy might be restored, the leader of
the military junta that ousted President Henri Konan Bedie gathered
the country's political parties Monday and invited them to nominate
members of his cabinet by next week. Military men will control the
military, the police and foreign affairs, he said, but some
civilians are wanted, and the cabinet will draft a new constitution
and pursue ``a real democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, the leader of the coup, Gen. Robert Guei, issued a
subtle warning: ``I don't find it useful to dissolve political
parties,'' The Associated Press quoted him as saying. ``But on the
other hand, let me say that we are counting on you to avoid
troubles.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he was giving signals that he might be
following the liberal model set recently by military men in Nigeria
and Niger: an illegal overthrow of an unpopular and authoritarian
civilian government, followed by democratic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Bedie was flown to Togo on Sunday on a French military aircraft,
and the French government said he would be welcome here. But Monday
he was reported to have gone on to Nigeria and to be meeting with
President Olusegun Obasanjo. Details of their talks were not
released, but Nigeria is the dominant military and economic power
in the Economic Community of West African States, of which the
Ivory Coast is a member, and Bedie may have been feeling out his
chances of being restored to office.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria already denounced the coup, which arose after a looting
spree by unhappy soldiers last Thursday. General Guei's coup was
announced on Friday while the government was negotiating with
soldiers. By Saturday, when even the national police force, which
Bedie had pampered and filled with members of his Baoule ethnic
group, declined to fight the army for him, it became clear that his
rule was finished.
</P>
<P>
   How spontaneous the mutiny was remains in question, because Gen.
Guei's junta is full of supporters of Alassane Ouattara, a former
prime minister who had hoped to run against Bedie for the
presidency next year but was being excluded on the ground that he
was not really a citizen of Ivory Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Other citizens of Ivory Coast do not seem to miss Bedie much. No
demonstrations demanding his restoration were reported and
patrolling soldiers whose commanders had ousted him were treated in
friendly fashion by civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Bedie won a power struggle in 1993 after the death of Felix
Houphouet-Boigny, who ruled Ivory Coast since its independence in
1960. But Bedie's entourage was thought to have enriched itself
from aid funds at a time when the country was suffering from low
prices for cocoa, cotton, coffee and other exports. Big donors like
the International Monetary Fund and the European Union began
suspending payments this year.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment and crime rose, and Bedie blamed the need to repay
donors for budget problems.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more important, he had become increasingly authoritarian
and had promoted a nationalist doctrine _ Ivorite, or
``Ivory-ness'' _ that denounced some people as non-Ivorians based
on the birthplaces of their parents or grandparents. The effect was
to make southerners the only real Ivorians while calling northern
Muslims like Ouattara foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a little like `Mein Kampf,''' said Juliette Amantchi,
an Ivorian on vacation in France.
</P>
<P>
   French leaders portrayed Bedie as the first important casualty
of France's new policy of nonintervention in its former African
colonies. Long after England, Portugal and Belgium had given up
doing so, France had been willing to use troops _ the Foreign
Legion _ to thwart coups and tribal fighting, and to instruct its
central bank to bolster currencies.
</P>
<P>
   Because it was relatively stable and prosperous, Ivory Coast,
along with Senegal and Gabon, was viewed as a cornerstone of French
policy toward its former colonies. But even though Bedie enjoyed
support in the entourage of President Jacques Chirac, there was a
worry that his policies could split the country and set off a civil
war. In the end, he was offered the minimum: protection from mobs,
a dignified getaway and an offer of asylum in France.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no longer any question of interfering in internal
political debates, no longer any question of maintaining this or
that leader against the popular will,'' said Charles Josselin,
France's minister of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   This could be interpreted, he added, as ``a signal'' to African
leaders ``who don't respect democratic rights.''
</P>
<P>
   But even in its new hands-off posture, France almost
inadvertently meddled in the coup. There are 550 French marines on
a base near the airport in Abidjan, the economic capital; Bedie
took refuge with them and they flew him out.
</P>
<P>
   Suggestions that another 350 French soldiers from Gabon and
Senegal might enter the Ivory Coast to ``help evacuate French
nationals'' infuriated General Guei. If their real plans were to
interfere with self-rule in Ivory Coast, he said, there could be a
bloodbath. He refused them entry.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The play ``Epic Proportions'' was greeted with mostly
negative reviews three months ago and attracted only modest
audiences, but its closing on Dec. 19 brought a historic moment to
New York theater: for the first time, at least in memory, no
recently written comedy or drama is running on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   The moment won't officially end until mid-January. ``Wrong
Mountain,'' a new play by David Hirson, started previews Monday
night and is to open on Jan. 13, joining a robust Broadway field
dominated by megamusicals. And a couple of other new works are
planned for next year. But it is testimony nonetheless to a steady
erosion in the tradition of the straight play on Broadway. In the
1998-1999 season, 10 new plays opened on Broadway, compared with 22
in 1978-1979 and a high of 30 in 1979-1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anybody cared, they would call it a crisis,'' said
playwright Arthur Miller. ``I think people do care, but they feel
helpless.''
</P>
<P>
   One could see this as an embarrassing moment for Broadway, given
that it may be a stretch to fill the usual category of four
nominees for the Tony Awards in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, some say the decline of new plays _
particularly by Americans _ on Broadway is offset by the vitality
in recent years of Off-Broadway, where this season's hits include
``Dinner With Friends'' and ``Fuddy Meers.'' Every year for the
last five, Off-Broadway has produced the Pulitzer Prize winning
play: ``Wit'' (1999); ``How I Learned to Drive'' (1998); the
musical ``Rent'' (1996), which moved to Broadway; ``The Young Man
From Atlanta'' (1995); and ``Three Tall Women'' (1994). There was
no prize for drama given for 1997.
</P>
<P>
   According to this theory of shifting focus, the nexis of New
York theater has shifted permanently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Times Square is turning into something else _ a
mass-entertainment district _ and that includes the kind of theater
Broadway has now,'' said Ada Louise Huxtable, an architecture
critic and historian. ``I don't think that's all bad, as long as
you don't lose what matters.'' What matters, she said, is that new
work is still percolating elsewhere in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Among the staples in the Theater District now are solo shows
like ``Dame Edna''; splashy musicals like ``The Lion King''; dance
shows like ``Fosse''; revivals like ``The Price,'' ``Kiss Me,
Kate'' and ``Chicago''; and those long-running phenomena ``Cats,''
``Les Miserables,'' ``Miss Saigon'' and ``The Phantom of the
Opera.''
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically perhaps, this season's play vacuum comes when
business on Broadway is booming; ticket sales are brisk, and
theaters are booked. What's more, just last year there was a
healthy crop of straight plays on Broadway. But those were either
new plays written by foreigners (``Closer,'' ``The Weir'') imported
after successes in London and Dublin or revivals like ``Death of a
Salesman'' and ``The Iceman Cometh,'' featuring Hollywood stars.
</P>
<P>
   With plays now costing $1 million to $2 million to produce on
Broadway, and mass audiences normally less attracted to them than
to musicals, many Broadway producers are steering clear of new
plays. Musicals are more expensive to put on ($5 million to $12
million, especially now that corporations like Disney have upped
the ante), but they are more of a reliable draw.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little harder every year,'' said Todd Haimes, artistic
director of the nonprofit Roundabout Theater Co., which produced
``The Rainmaker,'' with Woody Harrelson, on Broadway this season.
``It's hard to see right now what's going to turn that around. It's
so expensive to produce these plays, and it's so difficult to
recoup.''
</P>
<P>
   As for why audiences might be staying away from straight plays
on Broadway, theater professionals offer several reasons: a ticket
price of $80 for the best seats; the decline in school programs
that introduce students to the dramatic arts; the more hip appeal
of unconventional theater downtown, and the allure of competition
like television, films and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Given this environment, one might ask why Dodger Theatricals has
chosen to raise $1.5 million to bring ``Wrong Mountain,'' a new
straight play with no stars and no out-of-town tryout, to Broadway.
``Beyond high-mindedness and good-deed doing and scoring spiritual
points, I suppose there is some kind of testicular bravado,'' said
Michael David, the president of the company, which has produced
shows like ``Footloose'' and ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   David said he was bucking the trend because he believed that the
play, a satire about the theater world, would find an audience.
Nevertheless, the venture is unusual for his company. Dodger has
done more shows on Broadway than anyone else in the last 10 years,
he said, but only one drama (``Hamlet,'' featuring Ralph Fiennes).
``I do think it becomes ever more daunting,'' David said.
``Broadway has become so dangerous, so unwelcome, that one has to
second-guess.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to ``Wrong Mountain,'' the other new plays to open
later this season are ``Taller Than a Dwarf,'' a comedy by Elaine
May featuring film stars Parker Posey and Matthew Broderick, and
``Copenhagen,'' by British playwright Michael Frayn. Producer
Emanuel Azenberg said he planned to present ``The Enigma
Variations,'' a new play by Eric-Emmanuel Schmitt, on Broadway this
spring starring Donald Sutherland, although he has yet to announce
it.
</P>
<P>
   The other plays expected are revivals of Tom Stoppard's ``The
Real Thing'' and Sam Shepard's ``True West.''
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   With a bit of stretching one could argue that other works could
qualify as new plays. These include Julie Taymor's new version of
her 1996 production of Carlo Gozzi's ``Green Bird'' and Arthur
Miller's ``Ride Down Mount Morgan,'' to open this season, and Noel
Coward's ``Waiting in the Wings,'' which opened this month. The
latter two have never been produced in New York, though both were
written years ago (Miller's in 1991 and Coward's in 1960).
</P>
<P>
   New musicals are better represented on Broadway. ``James Joyce's
`The Dead''' recently moved to the Belasco Theater from
Off-Broadway. ``Marie Christine'' is now at the Vivian Beaumont
Theater at Lincoln Center, which is large enough for its
productions to be eligible for Tony Awards and is therefore
considered a ``Broadway house.'' ``The Wild Party'' is to open this
spring. The dance shows ``Contact'' and ``Swing'' also qualify as
new musicals.
</P>
<P>
   The last season raised hopes that nonmusicals were poised for a
rebirth. It was often hard to get a ticket to plays like ``Death of
a Salesman,'' ``The Iceman Cometh'' and ``The Blue Room.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The audience came,'' said Azenberg, who produced ``Iceman.''
``They came in droves.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``Iceman'' featured Kevin Spacey (and the production made a
healthy profit with a steep top ticket price of $100). Similarly
``Salesman'' offered Brian Dennehy and ``Blue Room,'' Nicole
Kidman. And most stars agree to grace productions only for limited
engagements.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, whose plays have seen a steady stream of Broadway
revivals, suggested that leaning on Hollywood does not bode well
for Broadway. ``Being a theater that relies completely on star
draws is, generally speaking, not in a healthy condition,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Azenberg said he was nervous about bringing ``Enigma'' to
Broadway this spring. ``We're terrified, absolutely terrified,
because I have no guideposts anymore,'' he said. ``We don't know
that there is an audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years ago, Azenberg said, he had six plays on Broadway,
including Athol Fugard's ``Master Harold ... and the Boys'' and Tom
Stoppard's ``Real Thing.'' ``Now,'' he said, ``I'm struggling to
get one on.''
</P>
<P>
   Haimes suggested that there might not in fact be an audience,
that wordy, often cerebral plays can no longer compete with flashy
alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mass audience that's needed to make a commercial
production successful is used to not having to think as much
because of television and because of education problems
nationally,'' he said. ``Their idea of going to the theater is
having an experience, seeing musicals and plays like `Stomp' and
`Thwak.' Plays that require more work have trouble attracting a
mass audience.'' (``Stomp'' and ``Thwak,'' like the long-running
``Blue Man Group,'' are more performance pieces than narrative
works.)
</P>
<P>
   Some theater professionals suggest that tastes for such fare
have begun to dictate content. If people are flocking to see
``Beauty and the Beast'' and ``Jekyll and Hyde,'' the thinking
goes, why not try to replicate such remunerative offerings?
</P>
<P>
   ``Producers are producing plays they think have a better chance
of breaking even,'' Haimes said. ``That is affecting the product
that is ending up in their theaters.''
</P>
<P>
   One could argue that Broadway's current offerings are a
throwback to the days of vaudeville. And several Broadway producers
have talked about plans for summoning that era with a Broadway Hall
of Fame at the Lyceum Theater that would feature videotaped
segments of current Broadway shows as something of a tasting menu
for tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Some argue that ticket prices may be keeping people away,
especially young, unseasoned theatergoers. And several producers
have made an effort to set aside tickets at lower prices to attract
this population. Azenberg said 150 seats at $20 each were set aside
for performances of ``Iceman.''
</P>
<P>
   Others argue that money is not the main obstacle, since the
economy is so strong, and people are spending the same amount or
more on other diversions.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile at theaters downtown and west of Eighth Avenue, where
ticket prices are considerably lower, new theaters are being
created to accommodate the demand for stages.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plays have migrated to a different place,'' said George A.
Wachtel, president of Audience Research and Analysis, a marketing
group that specializes in the arts.
</P>
<P>
   And new audiences have followed them. Whereas Off-Broadway once
connoted experimental, offbeat work, it is attracting more people
from uptown and out of town. In 1997 non-New Yorkers amounted to 25
percent of the Off-Broadway audience, up from 7 percent in 1981,
Wachtel said. That figure is now close to what Broadway's
out-of-town audience amounted to in 1980: 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Off-Broadway is starting to approach where Broadway was 20
years ago,'' Wachtel said. ``And the line between the two is
diminishing.''
</P>
<P>
   Others say it is difficult to attract top talent to
lower-paying, lower-profile Off-Broadway productions: directors and
designers as well as actors.
</P>
<P>
   Some theater professionals expressed concern that even Broadway
had suffered from a long-term brain drain to movies and television.
``It completely depresses me because I think these forces are
driving artists out of the theater,'' Haimes said. ``There is no
doubt that some of these people would have been the next Arthur
Miller, would have been the next Tennessee Williams, and we'll
never know that.''
</P>
<P>
   Some producers seem to be looking for ways to develop new
audiences through school programs. And occasionally talk bubbles up
about possible new ways to finance the Broadway theater, though no
workable plan has emerged.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Broadway veterans remain disheartened. ``Time was when
New York theater was the one the British looked to for
inspiration,'' Miller said. ``Now Broadway theater is suddenly the
place where plays go to die. And it's too bad.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Most mornings in a large park in western Beijing, near
the stone marker labeled Oasis of Life, hundreds of cancer patients
practice rituals as they try to harness the invisible forces of
qigong to fight their disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``HAAA! HAAA!'' shout those with lung cancer, trying to expel
``bad'' elements from their lungs as they take a stylized walk.
Other patients, alone or in pairs, simply stride in the same
deliberate way for four hours at a time, their arms shifting to and
fro in a prescribed fashion.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen newcomers circle around Yu Dayuan, a cancer survivor and
a disciple of the Guo Lin school of anti-cancer qigong, named for
the late master who developed it in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the novices have already endured surgery or chemotherapy
and been told that their cases are hopeless. They have come to
learn how to mobilize the invisible forces of qi that are said to
reside inside the body and in the environment. They learn the
trademark meditative walk, and they hear Yu's uplifting speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry,'' he says. ``Even if you didn't have cancer you'd
die some day. There are benefits to being a cancer patient: your
family will take good care of you and give you nutritious food.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But the negative side,'' he adds, ``is that you have to go
through surgery, and you may die.''
</P>
<P>
   This thriving anti-cancer movement, replete with the
testimonials of miraculously cured patients, is one of hundreds of
variants of qigong (pronounced chee-goong) that continue operating
in China, even as the authorities pursue their harsh crackdown on
one prominent offshoot, Falun Gong, and step up their scrutiny of
the others.
</P>
<P>
   The official acceptance of some qigong sects while others are
crushed is part of a two-decade, often tortuous effort by the
government to distinguish supposedly scientific, beneficial qigong
from practices that are labeled superstitious and then curbed.
</P>
<P>
   Officially branded as a superstitious ``evil cult,'' Falun Gong
was banned in July. Sunday, four leaders were given stiff prison
sentences for, among other charges, allegedly telling ill followers
that they could dispense with conventional medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Since the campaign to eradicate Falun Gong began, attendance in
the anti-cancer group here in Yuyuantan Park has dropped off
sharply, Yu lamented, because people fear attracting the attention
of the police.
</P>
<P>
   But the group has patrons high in scientific circles, avoids
making broad spiritual claims and has not held anything like the
illegal demonstrations that got Falun Gong into trouble, and Yu
continues to proselytize without trouble.
</P>
<P>
   While the concept of qi forces, or vital energy, is ancient and
pervasive in China, the term qigong was first widely used in the
1950s, and the movement blossomed only as political controls
relaxed in the 1980s and 90s.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, it presented the communist authorities with
a conundrum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Officials wanted to promote what they considered to be a truly
Chinese science,'' said Nancy Chen, a medical anthropologist at the
University of California at Santa Cruz who has studied qigong
groups. ``They wanted to retain the best qualities of qigong, and
they believe that it really does have healing properties.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they wanted to control was the simultaneous possibility
of widespread social movements.''
</P>
<P>
   The strident campaign against Falun Gong, which began only after
members staged a huge illegal demonstration in Beijing last April,
is the latest and most publicized of several crackdowns on sects of
qigong, Ms. Chen said. The banned groups all had messianic leaders
who, like the founder of Falun Gong, were accused of fostering
cults and gained large followings, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The distinctions between supposedly valid and bogus forms of
qigong are inherently blurry, because every sect has masters
claiming what by Western standards are supernatural powers. But
ongoing groups like the anti-cancer club in the park are especially
careful now to limit their claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ours is a scientific path, not a superstitious one,'' Yu said
in a conversation in the park, rattling off figures for the
thousands of his students over the years who reputedly survived
their cancers. He made a point of saying that patients are urged to
combine Western and traditional Chinese treatments with their
qigong.
</P>
<P>
   While many doctors here who are trained in Western medicine
scoff at the medical claims, the qigong movement has had
influential supporters, and some senior political leaders over the
years have consulted qigong masters.
</P>
<P>
   The country's most famous scientist, Qian Xuesen, who returned
from the United States in the early 1950s to help develop China's
nuclear bombs and missiles, has long been a proponent of qigong,
writing in the 1980s, for example, ``Truly top-class qigong masters
really do have some physical paranormal powers.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently President Jiang Zemin made a public visit to Qian, now
88 and bed-ridden, to elicit his endorsement of the crackdown on
Falun Gong as a fake.
</P>
<P>
   A key patron of the Guo Lin anti-cancer sect is Feng Lida, a
politically well connected, Soviet-trained medical doctor who is
deputy director of the General Navy Hospital in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Feng, 74, explained that at first she had been
skeptical, but in the late 1970s, when she saw what she felt were
amazing recoveries of patients with cancer and infectious diseases,
she became intrigued by qigong.
</P>
<P>
   Feng invited some prominent qigong masters to conduct
experiments in which they used their hands to direct qi forces at
test tubes of bacteria. They were actually able to raise and lower
the bacterial levels at will, she said, pulling out chart-laden
publications as evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Then the masters tried to alter the growth of cancer cells, she
said, and although the effects were weaker and took more time, they
too were detectable.
</P>
<P>
   ``These experiments told us that it is really science,'' Feng
said in her Beijing office, next to photographs of her shaking
hands with President Jiang, the legislative leader Li Peng and the
late Deng Xiaoping. ``Qigong is a Chinese treasure,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Feng hopes to spread qigong, along with good nutrition and
attention to crucial details like sleeping with one's head pointed
to the north, in alignment with magnetic fields, as a low-cost way
to meet the country's health-care needs.
</P>
<P>
   Around the Oasis of Life marker in Yuyuantan Park, the mood is
surprisingly cheerful as cancer patients who have completed their
long walks chat and exchange tips. It is clear that if nothing
else, the qigong club acts as a kind of support group for the
seriously ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to create a joyous atmosphere,'' Yu said. ``We call
this building group resistance. If a patient becomes desperate, no
medicine can cure him.''
</P>
<P>
   Yu went on to explain elaborate theories about how the walking
exercises and meditation free the flows of qi energy and blood
through the body, strengthening disease defenses. He described the
10 different shouts that are prescribed for various forms of
cancer, which function, he said, ``as a kind of exchange with the
outside world.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Among the regulars are several long-time survivors and total
believers in the power of qi.
</P>
<P>
   He Kaifeng, a spry 65-year-old who worked as an engineer, said
cancer in her lungs and abdomen was diagnosed 18 years ago. She had
chemotherapy, she said, but then developed an intestinal problem
and had to be fed intravenously for four months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctors gave up on me,'' she said. So she started
practicing Guo Lin qigong, learning from the founding master
herself, in Purple Bamboo Park nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, I was so weak that I often had to lie down on the
bench as I exercised,'' she said, recalling the four hours of
walking each morning. ``I never dreamed that I would survive very
long.'' Now, Ms. He said, she helps teach qigong to others as she
continues modified exercise herself.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-one-year-old Zhou Hangyu was only in his second week of
practice the other morning. A building designer with a construction
company, he was told earlier this year that he has lung cancer. He
had surgery in July, he said, and chemotherapy and radiation, but
the cancer has spread ominously into his liver.
</P>
<P>
   Zhou said he heard about the group in the park from a fellow
patient in his hospital ward, and decided to give it a try.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still just learning how to do it, and I haven't felt any
beneficial effect yet,'' he said. ``But the group spirit provides
good support. They are all really determined to resist cancer.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With four days until the year 2000, government officials,
company managers and computer experts are waiting anxiously to see
if the public will remain calm.
</P>
<P>
   It is not that everyone is sure the computers and the machinery
in which they are often embedded will perform flawlessly as they
roll past midnight and encounter year 2000 dates _ far from it.
Repair work has lagged in many countries and some domestic sectors,
like small businesses. And even the most stringent programs will
inevitably have some overlooked flaws.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the prevailing view is that the technical glitches are
likely to have limited economic and social impact. Bigger
disruptions could come, the experts say, from unwarranted
stockpiling, withdrawals of large sums from banks, or other sudden
efforts by millions of people to insulate themselves from possible
technical failures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest remaining variable is public attitude,'' said
Harris Miller, president of the Information Technology Association
of America. (For the moment that attitude is more confident than
ever: The Associated Press' latest poll found that 92 percent of
Americans expect minor problems at worst.) ``One incident can
change it quickly,'' he added, ``but if we stay on this track, the
whole thing could end up as a major victory for common sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Such thinking is disputed by year 2000 readiness advocates who
contend that it is reckless for individuals not to prepare for
major disruptions just as the government and major companies have
done. But whatever happens, there is wide agreement with John
Koskinen, chairman of the President's Council on Year 2000
Conversion, that Y2K, as the computer problem is known, has become
``the greatest management challenge of the past 50 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Had nothing been done, the world's financial systems would
already be sagging from errors in software that relies on future
dates _ like programs tracking debt payments _ with an almost
certain collapse early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturing, food distribution, power and phone networks and
most other basic services would have begun slowing within weeks if
not minutes after midnight Dec. 31. Computer users not hit directly
would nonetheless have been quickly crippled by breakdowns among
suppliers or key customers, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent such a fate, tens of millions of people have been
involved in preparations ranging from fixing computer code to
developing contingency plans to deal with any remaining glitches.
More than $250 billion has been spent in the effort, mostly in the
last three years, according to several estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The year 2000 problem came as no surprise to programmers. It
stems from a decades-old space-saving tactic of using just two
digits to represent the year. Many programmers recognized that 00
would be ambiguous _ some computers would interpret it as 1900 and
others not recognize it as a valid date _ but they mistakenly
assumed that the two-digit programming practice would die out long
before the new century and the software using it would be retired.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until the late 1990s that most senior managers
finally recognized how deep the problem ran. Now, even computer
novices realize that year 2000 flaws can crash their systems or
pump vast amounts of faulty data into files, billings or other
documents before they are recognized.
</P>
<P>
   It has turned out that faulty computers in machinery like phone
switches, industrial robots and video recorders are rarer and
usually more trivial than many experts originally feared. In fact,
officials in the airline and electric industries said recently that
their repairs turned up no embedded computers that could have
caused major failures.
</P>
<P>
   Still, because there are billions of embedded processors, even a
small percentage of date-sensitive units adds up to millions of
devices that could cause trouble if incorrectly handled. Chrysler
has identified 6,000 robots, controllers and other electronic
devices in 50 plants that it will reset on Jan. 3 before it
restarts its production lines. No one knows how many have been
overlooked or inadequately tested.
</P>
<P>
   For all the work that has been done, tough challenges are still
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   While some embedded flaws will remain invisible until machines
are turned off or on for the first time in the year 2000, which
could be months from now, the worst of that threat will be over
quickly in January.
</P>
<P>
   Most managers are more worried about office systems and
software. The information technology that runs the world's offices,
banks and government agencies could continue to have problems for
months as different programs, like payrolls or tax accounting
packages, deal with year 2000 dates for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Major computer users may have hundreds of millions of lines of
code in their software, and research shows that even the programs
that have ostensibly been fixed and tested still have flaws, some
serious. Managers in the United States are confident that they have
found enough of the major problems to be able to fix new ones that
come to light before they do much damage.
</P>
<P>
   One hopeful sign is that flaws have, so far, been showing up at
slightly lower rates than analysts had projected. For example,
Gartner Group, a technology consulting firm in Stamford, Conn.,
expected year 2000 problems to create 75 percent more breakdowns
than normal this month but its latest projections suggest that the
increase will be 65 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But Gartner is sticking by projections that programmers will be
twice as burdened as usual, thanks to year 2000 flaws, for the
first two months of next year.
</P>

   ``The issue will be, you've got a boat, you've got a hole in it,
how fast can you bail?'' said James Woodward, the Dallas-based head
of North American Year 2000 services for Cap Gemini, Europe's
largest computer services company.
</P>
<P>
   As Dec. 31 approaches, concerns about computer viruses and
intruders are also on the rise. Managers fear that the vast amount
of work on systems may have left them more open to security
breaches. In addition, publicity about year 2000 ``acts as a draw
for those who want to make a statement,'' said Richard Landes,
director of the Center for Millennial Studies at Boston University.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of computer users are erecting defenses like
those of the Regional Medical Center in Orangeburg, S.C., which is
shutting off computer access from its system to the Internet on
Dec. 31; executives in its command center that want to track
information on the World Wide Web will use a separate personal
computer installed for the rollover.
</P>
<P>
   Security threats aside, many companies are preparing to execute
elaborate precautions affecting employees, suppliers and customers.
Many large chemical plants and oil pipelines are shutting down for
the transition. Major freight railroads and Amtrak are suspending
service on New Year's Eve to go through one last round of equipment
and signal checks after midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most of all, government and company officials will be
struggling to separate fact from rumor, and a vast number of public
and private information networks are being pieced together for the
occasion. A recent test of the government's Y2K Information
Coordination Center included telecommunications links to
counterparts in 80 countries and 50 states and numerous emergency
management officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to be asking what is happening with everything
all over the world,'' Koskinen said. ``Our major requirement is to
put out accurate information, but we have to be timely, too. There
has never been anything like this in all of history.''
</P>
<P>
   Reliable information is crucial for contingency planners,
because the computers and human actors they have been worrying most
about are those beyond their control.
</P>
<P>
   International businesses say information is particularly hard to
come by overseas. All assessments describe Russia as the largest
nation far behind in preparations. China, by virtue of its size and
heavy reliance on pirated software, is seen as a higher than
average risk. Japan started late but seems to have largely caught
up, at least among its larger companies.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria is one of several African countries considered
especially risky; the national year 2000 group was given $1 million
of the $200 million it said it needed. But oil companies have said
they expect exports as usual from there, and from the Persian Gulf
and Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, many of the countries least prepared for the computer
problem are those most accustomed to coping with disruptions. Only
a handful of nations with major year 2000 problems are likely to
suffer substantial economic consequences, according to projections
by International Data Corp., a consulting firm based in Framingham,
Mass. Even then, IDC says, worldwide losses will be less than $24
billion.
</P>
<P>
   No one thinks Americans will stay relaxed if major disruptions
unexpectedly develop. Indeed, for most of this year, many of the
biggest debates have swirled around how to encourage some
preparations without inciting unusual behavior or panic.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have been warning homeowners against storing
gasoline or taking large amounts of money out of the bank. Gartner
Group predicts lines and possible spot shortages of gasoline in the
last two days of this month, as Americans top off the tanks in
their cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to get hairy for a couple of days,'' said Lou
Marcoccio, year 2000 research director at Gartner Group.
</P>
<P>
   The actual arrival of the year 2000 might seem like a letdown,
experts say. But most experts agree that it will take several quiet
weeks to be confident that the first global technology challenge
has been met successfully.
</P>
<P>
   Even if it all unfolds as smoothly as the optimists project, a
potentially titanic legal battle over who pays is shaping up.
Xerox, Nike and Unisys are among the eight companies that have
already sued for reimbursement from their insurers for spending
hundreds of millions of dollars on year 2000 repairs.
</P>
<P>
   They cite language in business contracts dating from the 19th
century, when insurers would pay ship owners for money spent trying
to prevent a ship from sinking. The insurers argue they owe
nothing, because year 2000 losses were completely foreseeable, and
Congress acted last summer to limit their exposure.

IN PANAMA CANAL DISPLAY, ENGINEERS GET THE GLORY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As interest in the Panama Canal began to focus this
year on its impending transfer out of United States hands and the
geopolitics involved, scholars at the Smithsonian Institution began
to lament that something important was being overlooked. Lost in
the hoopla was an appreciation of the canal as an engineering feat.
</P>
<P>
   What former President Jimmy Carter handed over to Panamanian
President Mireya Moscoso on Dec. 14 with the simple words ``It's
yours''is the subject of ``Make the Dirt Fly,'' an exhibition at
the National Museum of American History here. Though the 50.7-mile
canal was heralded a century ago as a symbol of progress and a boon
to promoting commerce and uniting nations, the aim of this
exhibition is to show the canal as a marvel of scientific and
engineering achievement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the debate right now has focused on the political
issues, and we wanted to put that in context,'' said William E.
Worthington Jr., the curator of the exhibition, which opened this
fall and runs through Jan. 5, 2001. ``The canal is the masterpiece
of engineering work, and we thought it should be explained.''
</P>
<P>
   The political overtones of the transfer have not been ignored. A
much smaller exhibition, ``Panama's Canal: Dawn of a New Era,''
explains the details of the transfer and the debate about its
significance. But it was placed on another floor and assigned a
different curator to keep it separate from the larger exhibition in
the minds of visitors, Worthington said.
</P>
<P>
   Construction of the Panama Canal was begun in 1881 by a private
French company, which struggled with the project for more than two
decades before selling it to the U.S. government. The work lasted
more than 30 years, took an estimated 20,000 lives and cost more
than $600 million. Building a waterway that connected the Atlantic
and Pacific Oceans posed an array of problems, from
disease-carrying mosquitoes to stubborn rock, from construction
accidents to hot and humid weather.
</P>
<P>
   The curators faced the challenge of showing all this in one
room. ``The Panama Canal was built in an area of about 500 square
miles,'' Worthington said. ``We had 800 square feet.''
</P>
<P>
   To get around space limitations, the curators turned to pointed
descriptions. The exhibition's brochure, for example, explains that
``the total soil excavated from the canal would build a pyramid
4,200 feet high,'' about triple the height of the Empire State
Building. The exhibition can be seen on the Internet at:
www.sil.si.edu/Exhibitions/Make-the-Dirt-Fly
</P>
<P>
   It was organized by the Smithsonian Institution Libraries, a
lesser-known arm of the Smithsonian that serves the research needs
of its curators and the public. Each year the libraries choose a
topic for their modest display area in a corner of the National
Museum of American History. The exhibitions allow the libraries to
present their work to the public, said Nancy L. Matthews, their
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the items in the Panama Canal display are from the
libraries' collections. These include sketches, photographs, books
and manuscripts from well before the first shovel split the earth
to August 1914, when the canal opened.
</P>
<P>
   One conspicuous exception is at the entrance, where visitors are
greeted by a 70-ton dipper from one of the steam shovels that
worked on the canal. The dipper came from Bucyrus International
Inc., the company that provided 77 of the 102 steam shovels used to
dig the canal. Bucyrus is the principal supporter of the
exhibition, which is financed entirely by private donations.
</P>
<P>
   The dipper has been left worn and dirty to illustrate the rigors
of its work in Panama, said Linda J. Edmondson, a spokeswoman for
Bucyrus. Smithsonian curators tried for a similar effect when they
designed the rest of the exhibition. The patterns and colors of the
floor, for instance, are intended to evoke the feeling of being in
the jungle and working in the mud.
</P>
<P>
   Although the working conditions might have been muddy and
miserable in Panama, the living conditions were considered
comfortable, at least from 1904 on during the American period of
construction. Workers enjoyed plenty of food, good schools for
their children and housing with electricity, a rarity at the time
back home in the United States. To the engineers running the
project, life on the job and at home formed part of the same
fabric. ``A healthy and happy work force would ensure that the job
was done on time,'' Worthington explained.
</P>
<P>
   Besides raising worker morale, leaders of the American effort
proved adept at controlling malaria and yellow fever, which had
wiped out French laborers. A section of the exhibition titled
``Waging War on Mosquitoes'' describes how the Americans, armed
with recent medical research showing that mosquitoes transmitted
the diseases, avoided the fate that forced the French to abandon
the project.
</P>
<P>
   When John F. Stevens became chief engineer of the American
effort in 1905 he ordered a halt to all construction until the
mosquitoes were controlled. Workers searched out mosquito breeding
grounds and sprayed them with a thin layer of oil, suffocating the
insects' larvae. They covered windows and doorways with nets and
cut down field after field of tall grasses. After 18 months of
determined effort, the diseases were under control, and
construction resumed.
</P>
<P>
   If a tiny insect had not been contained, Ms. Matthews said,
perhaps one of the nation's largest engineering feats might never
have been accomplished.

PRESIDENT OF PERU WILL RUN FOR A THIRD TERM 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina _ President Alberto Fujimori of Peru
announced his candidacy for an unprecedented third term Monday,
arguing that his country needed him to guarantee an end to
terrorism and to complete the country's economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori's announcement capped four years of legal and political
maneuvering to overcome a constitutional prohibition against three
consecutive presidential terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not want to return to the past,'' he said in an address
to the nation. ``That is the reason for my candidacy. Another
option may have been preferable but there are no alternatives.''
</P>
<P>
   The son of Japanese immigrants, Fujimori, 61, shocked the
political establishment by winning election in 1990 and was easily
re-elected five years later. During his decade of rule, he has
brought the country's traditional hyperinflation under control,
greatly reduced the cocaine trade and negotiated a settlement to a
border conflict with neighboring Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
   His enduring popularity, however, comes from the retreat of two
guerrilla groups that once controlled wide swaths of territory but
now can do little more than launch small, isolated attacks. During
his speech on Monday, Fujimori pledged to ``extinguish every
vestige of terrorism from the country'' during his next term.
</P>
<P>
   But Fujimori's often autocratic methods _ including replacing
the Congress and the Supreme Court by decree in 1992, and taking a
television station away from a critic of his government _ have
attracted widespread criticism among human rights groups. Most
recently, critics have accused him of manipulating and even
replacing judges and election officials who opposed his re-election
bid.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution established in 1993 prohibits a third
presidential term. But three years later, supporters of Fujimori
who control the Congress pushed through a law that excluded him
from the prohibition since his first term began before the document
was written. Over the last two years, the Congress dismissed three
senior judges who opposed the law and then blocked a popular
referendum intended to block his re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Polls this year have shown that as many as two-thirds of the
voters do not favor a third presidential term. But Fujimori's
popularity has steadily increased through the year as the economy
recovered. He now appears to have a good chance of winning a
first-round victory in April.
</P>
<P>
   A poll published earlier this month showed Fujimori would win 46
percent of the vote. Running far behind in second place with 17
percent was Luis Castaneda Lossio, former director of the Peruvian
Social Security Institute and a former key aide to Fujimori. In
third place was Alberto Andrade, the mayor of Lima, with 13
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, which had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.5
percent, showed that Fujimori would easily defeat either opponent
if the splintered opposition were to unite.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After suffering a recession in 1998, the Peruvian economy is
expected to grow by about 2.5 percent this year based on increased
manufacturing, improved fishing conditions and higher metal prices.
Fujimori's standing in the polls has also been helped by the arrest
of several important Shining Path terrorist leaders, which
underscored the president's record of having pacified the country.
</P>
<P>
   And in an effort to soften his image, Fujimori freed 12 people
from prison over the weekend who had been prosecuted in
anti-terrorism courts that did not allow their lawyers to
cross-examine witnesses, but who were later found innocent by a
government investigative panel.

While a reporter for The Times, Selwyn Raab reported extensively on
the Carter-Artis case and discovered evidence that led to the
overturning of convictions in the first trial. 
 By SELWYN RAAB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a soft spring night in 1966, at a time when many American
cities were torn by racial tension, two black men stormed into a
Paterson, N.J., tavern and unleashed a barrage of gunfire that
killed the bartender and two patrons, all white. Soon after,
Hurricane Carter, a contender for the middleweight boxing
championship, was convicted of the crime and imprisoned for 19
years in a case that was eventually overturned in a landmark
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle of Carter, whose first name is Rubin, for
exoneration is the subject of ``The Hurricane,'' a film directed by
Norman Jewison, with Denzel Washington portraying the boxer whose
compelling real-life story touches on thorny issues of race, civil
rights and celebrity involvement in criminal trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hurricane,'' which opens Wednesday, is being billed as
``the triumphant true story of an innocent man's 20-year fight for
justice.'' But the discrepancy between the ``true story'' and what
is seen on screen raises questions about how Hollywood presents
actual events and the liberties taken with the truth.
</P>
<P>
   The film bases its authenticity on ``Lazarus and the
Hurricane,'' by Sam Chaiton and Terry Swinton, published in 1991
(Viking), and on Carter's autobiography, ``The 16th Round,''
published in 1974 (Viking). The film, written by Armyan Bernstein
and Dan Gordon, depicts Carter's turbulent life as a rebellious
youth, a ferocious boxer and a tormented prisoner.
</P>
<P>
   But it presents a false vision of the legal battles and personal
struggles that led to his freedom and creates spurious heroes in
fictionalized episodes that attribute his vindication to members of
a Canadian commune who unearth long-suppressed evidence.
</P>
<P>
   While glorifying the Canadians, the film plays down the heroic
efforts of the lawyers whose strategy finally won the day for
Carter. Virtually obliterated in the film version is the vital role
played by John Artis, Carter's co-defendant, who was also wrongly
convicted and imprisoned for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Two films in this decade, ``JFK,'' Oliver Stone's conspiracy
version of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, and
``The Insider,'' an account of the perils of a tobacco-industry
whistle-blower, directed by Michael Mann, have also provoked
debates over skewed history torn from headlines.
</P>
<P>
   Of course filmmakers have always taken dramatic license,
simplifying history and conflating characters and events for
narrative purposes. They defend their interpretations by
emphasizing that their films are not documentaries but vivid
adaptations of complex stories that retain the essence if not the
literal truth of important events that would otherwise be unknown
to the huge audiences that movies attract.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever its intentions, ``The Hurricane'' falls into the
category of history contorted for dramatic effect.
</P>
<P>
   A major fabrication is the creation of a racist Javert-type
detective who hounds Carter from the age of 11 until he finally
ensnares him in the triple homicide. The film brands the phantom
detective as primarily responsible for framing Carter.
</P>
<P>
   The actual story is more harrowing because it exposes an
underlying frailty in a criminal-justice system that convicted
Carter, not once but twice. The convictions were obtained not by a
lone, malevolent investigator but by a network of detectives,
prosecutors and judges who countenanced the suppression and
tainting of evidence and the injection of racial bias into the
courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   The film also sterilizes Carter's history before his arrest for
murder. He is characterized as a nearly model citizen who overcame
persecution as a juvenile and remade himself as a boxer and civil
rights advocate. What is omitted is that Carter served four years
in prison as an adult for three muggings, crimes that later
tarnished him as potentially violent and damaged his cause in the
murder case.
</P>
<P>
   While the film would have audiences believe that Carter was a
teetotaler, he never denied taking part in an occasional pub crawl
and, although married, having a romantic fling. One of those night
owl excursions enmeshed him in the murders, a fact obscured in the
movie.
</P>
<P>
   The forgotten man of the film is Artis, the other defendant,
whose life was almost destroyed. Seen only briefly, Artis is
portrayed as a clueless youth. The only recognition given to him is
a brief prison encounter when Denzel suddenly addresses him as ``my
hero.''
</P>
<P>
   In reality Artis defiantly rejected an offer to avoid a long
prison sentence by falsely incriminating Carter. Many defense
supporters were also drawn to the case because of their faith in
Artis, who had an unblemished reputation and no police record.

CURTIS MAYFIELD, 57; CONSCIENCE OF SOUL MUSIC DEAD AT 57 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Drops reference to Steppenwolf as a performer of ``Pusherman,'' in
3rd graf; a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Curtis Mayfield, a ghetto-born poet who became soul music's
social conscience and stayed a spiritual force even after he was
paralyzed in a stage accident in 1990, died Sunday in an Atlanta
hospital. He was 57.
</P>
<P>
   No reason was given for his death. He had been weak for months
and was unable to attend his induction into the Rock and Roll Hall
of Fame in New York in March. Rapper Puff Daddy inducted him at
that event, praising his ``sense of the holy and the sting of the
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Mayfield, a mainstay of the Chicago vocal group the
Impressions before turning solo, wrote some of R &AMP; B's most famous
songs. Among them are ``People Get Ready'' (which also became the
``Amazing Grace'' of the pop world, sung by everyone from Rod
Stewart to Bob Marley), ``Gypsy Woman,'' and his '70s soundtrack
hits, ``Superfly'' and ``Freddie's Dead,'' which have been sampled
by countless hip-hop artists from Puff Daddy to Ice-T. Mr. Mayfield
also wrote ``Pusherman,'' about the dead-end world of drug
hustling.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Mayfield was a prime musical voice of the civil rights
movement, starting with 1964's ``Keep On Pushing,'' a Top Ten hit
on both R &AMP; B and pop radio stations. His other socially conscious
songs during that era included ``We're a Winner,'' ``This is My
Country,'' and ``Choice of Colors.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Mayfield was a silky-smooth singer whose falsetto was
immediately identifiable on the radio for many years. He reached
his commercial peak in 1972 with the ``Superfly'' soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1942, Mr. Mayfield grew up in Chicago's infamous
Cabrini-Green projects, where he shared one room with his mother
and five siblings. One younger brother was retarded and Mr.
Mayfield took special care of him until the boy died of an enlarged
heart at age 18.
</P>
<P>
   Trained in church singing, Mr. Mayfield took that gospel-infused
sound into the Impressions, where he shared vocal duties with Jerry
Butler. The Impressions had a falling-out which prompted Mr.
Mayfield to turn solo, but they reunited for a memorable 1983 tour
that came to the Berklee Performance Center. The show started an
hour late because Mr. Mayfield had a bad cold and lay sick in his
hotel, but he rallied and gave a mesmerizing performance.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Mayfield was also a poet of the heart, writing such tenderly
beautiful love songs as ``Woman's Got Soul'' and ``I'm So Proud.''
Everything he did showed consummate style and a poet's touch.
</P>
<P>
   The positive thinking that lay at his core was never more
evident than after the freak accident that left him paralyzed in
1990 _ when a lighting truss fell on him during a thunderstorm at a
free Brooklyn concert. He never indulged in self-pity _ and he even
made another album in 1996, ``New World Order,'' recorded while
lying on his back.
</P>
<P>
   The album featured the songs ``Back to Living Again'' and ``Oh
So Beautiful,'' with the verse, ``Never forget the life we live is
oh so beautiful.'' Nominated for two Grammys, it didn't win, but
Eric Clapton, who won three Grammys that year, interrupted his
acceptance speech to say that Mr. Mayfield's album was his personal
favorite of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all human beings, so we can get angry or bitter or mad,
but for me it doesn't last too long,'' Mr. Mayfield told the Globe
when the album came out. ``I'd rather be humble and cry tears of
joy than to take on the stress and burdens of being dogged out and
negative.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Mayfield leaves his wife, Altheida, along with ten children,
two sisters, a brother, and seven grandchildren. Funeral
arrangements have not been announced.

UNDATED: police record.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The true nightmare for both men began after the early-morning
shotgun and pistol-fire slayings of two men and a woman in the
Lafayette Grill, a Paterson bar. The murders occurred only hours
after a black tavern owner had been fatally shot by a white man in
Paterson, and the police immediately theorized that racial
retaliation was the motive for the Lafayette Grill attack.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the murders Carter, then 29, and Artis, 21, were
picked up in Carter's white Dodge, which the police said resembled
the getaway car. The movie, however, disregards vital elements the
police used against Carter: the finding of a shotgun and a bullet
in the Dodge and the murder of the black tavern owner.
</P>
<P>
   Except for being black, neither Carter nor Artis resembled the
original descriptions of the killers, and they were released after
passing lie detector tests.
</P>
<P>
   Three months later, however, the two men were indicted based on
statements by two petty criminals, Alfred P. Bello and Arthur D.
Bradley, two white men who admitted that they had been committing a
burglary near the Lafayette Grill and said that they had seen
Carter and Artis emerge with guns in their hands.
</P>
<P>
   At a trial in 1967 the prosecution offered no motive for the
murders. Bello and Bradley were the only witnesses who identified
Carter and Artis, and their testimony was decisive in the
convictions and the imposition of life sentences.
</P>
<P>
   All appeals failed. By 1973 the penniless Carter's prospects for
a new trial seemed doomed. Nevertheless, Carter, a charismatic
figure inside prison as well as outside, enlisted help from Fred W.
Hogan, an investigator for the New Jersey public defender's office,
and Richard Solomon, a freelance writer. On his own time Hogan
searched for evidence while Solomon rekindled interest by
establishing a minuscule defense committee and by soliciting
journalists to write about Carter's plight. In 1973 and 1974 Hogan
and this reporter tracked down Bello and Bradley, and both men
separately recanted their identifications of Carter and Artis. They
asserted that Lt. Vincent DeSimone, the lead detective in the case,
and other investigators, some of whom made racist slurs, had
pressured them into incriminating Carter and Artis. The lies were
in exchange for lenient sentences in their own crimes and the lure
of a $10,000 reward.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times published front-page articles about the
recantations and about other questionable evidence used by the
prosecution. Overnight Carter became an international cause
celebre, with civil rights leaders, politicians, writers, and
entertainment figures joining his defense committee. Bob Dylan
supported Carter in his song ``Hurricane'' (which is used in the
new movie).
</P>
<P>
   Based on the recantations and the concealment of promises to the
prosecution's main witnesses, the New Jersey Supreme Court
overturned the guilty verdicts. But in 1976 at a second trial
prosecutors resuscitated an old theory, charging that Carter and
Artis had exacted racial revenge for the earlier murder of the
black tavern owner.
</P>
<P>
   Bello, in a surprise twist, resurfaced to recant his
recantation, testifying as the only prosecution witness who placed
Carter and Artis at the murder scene.
</P>
<P>
   After nine months of freedom Carter and Artis were found guilty,
cast back into prison and deserted by most of the celebrities and
civil rights figures. Still, the principal defense lawyers, Myron
Beldock, Lewis Steel and Leon Friedman of New York City, who worked
for a decade without payment, persisted in unearthing evidence that
the prosecution had concealed at the second trial.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous appeals over nine years in New Jersey courts failed.
But when the issues were heard for the first time in federal court,
a judge in 1985 overturned the convictions on constitutional
grounds, saying the prosecution had ``fatally infected the trial''
by resorting, without proof, to the racial revenge theory and had
withheld evidence that disproved the identifications made by Bello,
the star prosecution witness.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988 the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the appeal, and after 22
years all accusations against Carter and Artis were dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   In the film the two trials are confusingly compressed into a
brief courtroom sentencing scene with Carter protesting that he had
been convicted by an all-white jury. (In reality the first jury was
all white; the second included two elderly blacks.)
</P>
<P>
   Many pivotal scenes revolve around Carter's relationship with
members of a secretive Canadian commune, especially a young black
man, Lesra Martin, who befriended him in the later years of his
imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   In the film the young Martin and the commune revive a supposedly
despairing Carter's faith in himself and in his quest for freedom.
They are depicted as demon sleuths who uncover vital evidence
including a secret diary kept by an investigator, a forged police
document and incontestable proof that Carter's car was not the
get-away vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   These incidents are fairy tales. All essential evidence
concerning constitutional violations, manipulated witnesses and
prosecutorial misconduct was found by defense lawyers. The film
concocts suspenseful encounters _ unmentioned in the Canadians' own
book, ``Lazarus and the Hurricane,'' nor reported elsewhere _ in
which commune members are menaced by the reincarnated Javert and
narrowly escape death.
</P>
<P>
   Carter's lawyers do credit the Canadians with extensive
paralegal work that spared them hundreds of hours of research and
expenses. In an authorized biography, ``Hurricane,'' by James S.
Hirsch, to be published next in January by Houghton Mifflin, Carter
says he instantly bonded with Martin and was indebted to the
Canadians for spending $400,000 _ mainly on living expenses for
themselves and him _ before and after his release.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, in an interview, said he had little control over the
screenplay. He added that he had not objected to the description of
the Canadians' role because of his gratitude for their moral and
financial support.
</P>
<P>
   Missing from the film are the recantations by Bello and Bradley,
the critical disclosures that reopened a dead case and figured
prominently in Carter's ultimate exoneration. Nor is there an
indication of the support Carter received from relatives and
friends long before the affluent Canadians arrived. While Carter's
affection for Martin is the keystone of the movie, viewers have
little sense of the son and a daughter with whom he has had a
distant relationship even out of prison. There is only the merest
suggestion of the loyalty of his first wife.
</P>
<P>
   The film closes with a courtroom scene signifying the judicial
defeat of evil, attributed to the indomitable Canadians. It fades
out with a stirring (but invented) speech by Carter about injustice
and his embracing of Martin, and Lisa Peters, the leader of the
Canadians.
</P>
<P>
   A feel-good screen afterword notes that Carter lives in Canada
and runs an organization that seeks to correct judicial wrongs, and
that Martin has become a lawyer in Canada. Left unsaid is both
men's eventual disenchantment with the commune and its treatment of
them.
</P>
<P>
   After his release Carter married Ms. Peters. But he soon ended
all relations with her and other commune members, asserting in his
biography that they patronized him as a ``trophy horse'' whose main
purpose was to raise money for the group. He further complains that
the commune tried to control his life, with members escorting him
everywhere and censoring his words.
</P>
<P>
   As for Martin, he was expelled. His crime: dating a woman
without the commune's permission.

&HT;     MILITIA PLANNED NEW YEAR'S ATTACK ON PROPANE TANKS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By LANCE WILLIAMS  
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The militiamen called them the ``twin sisters,''
giant steel tanks in rural Sacramento County that hold enough
liquid propane to immolate every living thing for five miles if
they were to explode.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year, a loose-knit band of survivalists, illegal
firearms traders and right-wing revolutionaries allegedly plotted
to detonate the tanks.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the conspirators turned out to be a shadowy informant
whom the FBI had recruited with money and the hope of leniency on a
weapons charge.
</P>
<P>
   And in the end, a series of FBI raids allegedly thwarted a San
Joaquin County militia's plan for a fiery holocaust near the
Sacramento suburb of Elk Grove.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 3, agents arrested Kevin Patterson, 42, of Camino, an
alleged bomb-maker and methamphetamine ``cook'' with ties to
paramilitary groups in other states, and Charles Dennis Kiles, 49,
of Placerville, a suspected militia commander who had been
convicted on an illegal firearms charge. They also seized a trove
of bomb-making chemicals and weapons parts from Patterson's house,
court records show.
</P>
<P>
   Both were part of a self-styled militia that hoped the new year
would bring the breakdown of vital public services throughout the
nation, according to a court affidavit filed by the FBI and the
U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
</P>
<P>
   They planned to lead an armed overthrow of the U.S. government
in the chaos and civil unrest they believed would follow potential
computer failures linked to the date change, said FBI agent Michael
LeMieux and ATF agent R. Graham Barlowe.
</P>
<P>
   The two men have been indicted on federal firearms charges. At
least three other people who discussed the abortive attack on the
propane tanks, including the informant, have not been charged with
any crime, records in U.S. District Court in Sacramento show.
</P>
<P>
   The agents' affidavit reports connections between Patterson and
such right-wing groups as the Montana Freemen, who faced down
hundreds of FBI agents in an armed siege near Billings in 1996; and
the Republic of Texas, which confronted the Texas Rangers in a 1997
standoff.
</P>
<P>
   The document indicates that in years since the bombing of the
Oklahoma City federal building in 1995, the militia movement's
stridently anti-government ideology has become infused with
apocalyptic predictions about the collapse of American society with
the arrival of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The affidavit also gives a glimpse into the workings of a
federal anti-terrorist task force that for more than five years has
been investigating militias for weapons and bomb-making violations.
</P>
<P>
   The informant told the authorities that one key player in the
militia unit was Kiles, described as the gun-toting former
commander of the Sacramento County militia, a paramilitary group
that after the Oklahoma City bombing.
</P>
<P>
   According to the affidavit, Kiles had been on probation since
pleading guilty to felony possession of an assault rifle in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The informant said Kiles was a longtime friend of Patterson's,
who had spent more than three years with rightist groups in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   According to the affidavit, a police officer who had infiltrated
Texas militia units identified Patterson as a methamphetamine
``cook'' and bomb-maker for the Texas Constitutional Militia and
then for the Republic of Texas, a separatist group known for its
standoff against the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, members of the group were arrested in connection
with an alleged plot to assassinate President Clinton and Attorney
General Janet Reno with cactus needles dipped in either the AIDS
virus or anthrax poison, according to news reports.
</P>
<P>
   By the informant's account, the militiamen had been mulling an
attack on Elk Grove's Suburban Propane storage facility since about
June 1998, court files show.
</P>
<P>
   He said the idea might have been hatched while Patterson and
Donald K. Rudolph, 42, reputed leader of the San Joaquin Militia,
were in Billings, Mont., to scout the Yellowstone County Jail as
part of an ultimately abandoned plan to help the Montana Freemen
escape, the affidavit says. Rudolph, a heavy equipment operator for
the California Department of Transportation, was later arrested and
imprisoned for possession of a machine gun, according to court
records.
</P>
<P>
   After his return from Montana, the informant said, Patterson
added other prospective targets: the California Aqueduct and what
he called the ``movie theater,'' giant television transmission
towers in Walnut Grove, east of Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, the affidavit says, the informant kept agents
apprised of Patterson's plans.
</P>
<P>
   According to the affidavit, members of another right-wing fringe
group called the Nevada Freedom Coalition helped Patterson get a
mail-order shipment of four pounds of red phosphorus, a chemical
that can be used to make both methamphetamine and explosives.

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In September, in a wiretapped phone call with an alleged Nevada
survivalist named Curk Cave, Patterson was overhead in an extended
discussion of ``cooking the turkey at the wrong temperature.''
</P>
<P>
   The agents thought the men were talking in code and that
Patterson had been heating fertilizer in an oven to remake it into
explosives, a method also used by the terrorists who blew up the
World Trade Center in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, to the informant, and to two undercover FBI men who
befriended him at gun shows, and in wiretapped phone calls to
friends, Patterson increasingly shared his notions about the year
2000 computer glitch.
</P>
<P>
   According to the affidavit, Patterson had stockpiled a four-
month supply of food and water to tide him over during the
disruptions he was certain would follow the dawn of the new
century.
</P>
<P>
   He planned to ``go camping'' in late December and stay in the
woods until mid-January, he said. Some of his friends were building
bunkers on remote desert property, burying sea-going shipping
containers, electrifying them with a generator and stockpiling guns
and ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson assumed that the government would be forced to ration
food and gasoline because of breakdowns in the distribution net and
that mass arrests would result.
</P>
<P>
   In phone calls, he and Cave, his survivalist pal, swapped Y2K
gossip: the Air National Guard was supposedly being trained to
``corral, handle and transport detainees,'' as Cave put it, while
the Army would go door to door confiscating personal firearms.
</P>
<P>
   In other conversations they talked about ``Waco, Pat Buchanan
and a blood supply problem in Canada,'' the FBI noted; at one
point, Patterson said he avoided using supermarket discount cards
because he feared having his name entered in a ``satanic
database.''
</P>
<P>
   In June, FBI agents began surveillance of Patterson, tailing him
as he drove a rental car from Placerville to San Francisco and back
through the San Joaquin Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson seemed to know he was being followed. He made sudden
U-turns and route changes, and at one point stopped and confronted
a motorist he seemingly suspected of tailing him.
</P>
<P>
   After that, agents got a warrant to use a mobile tracking
device. In July, they tracked his rental car on a 500-mile, 24-hour
trip to Fallon, Nev., where Ronald Franklin Brown, 58, a member of
the Nevada Freedom Coalition, lived in a bunker-like compound
littered with military hardware. Brown has not been charged with
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The agents were not always able to learn where he was going, but
often Patterson seemed bent on buying illegal firearms or
industrial equipment that might help him make a bomb, the affidavit
said.
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   In August, agents inspected Suburban Propane's sprawling Elk
Grove storage yard and made a sobering discovery: security was
``minimal at best'' around the two big tanks, which contained more
than 24 million gallons of pressurized liquefied propane.
</P>
<P>
   The agents saw that it would be easy for the militiamen to enter
the unfenced yard and overpower or slip by security guards.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns increased after the FBI commissioned a ``threat
assessment'' study by scientists at the Lawrence Livermore
Laboratory. They concluded that a ``small explosive device'' could
set off a vast fire at the propane yard.
</P>
<P>
   An explosion near either of the twin sisters likely would cause
a ``sympathetic reaction'' that would blow up the other tower,
along with all the propane-laden trucks and rail cars parked
nearby, the scientists concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The results would be catastrophic: a firestorm that would arc as
far as 8 miles across farmlands and suburban subdivisions, killing
50 percent of all living things 5 miles from ground zero.
</P>
<P>
   After the visit, the place was fenced, and security was beefed
up.

CELTICS ON A NO-PLAYOFF STREAK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ As bad as pro basketball has been in Boston
the last six seasons, no one ever guessed that you would be able to
say the following about the Celtics: They own the longest current
streak of non-playoff seasons (four and counting) in the Atlantic
Division.
</P>
<P>
   The Wizards/Bullets were swept away by the Bulls in 1997, but
they were there. John Calipari's Nets made a brief appearance at
the postseason party before also being swept away by the Michael
Jordan Company in 1998. The Magic, Heat, and 76ers made the
playoffs last season. But the Celtics haven't come close to the
playoffs since they last left them _ 1995 _ in the final year of
the Boston Garden's existence.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, only one team in the entire Eastern Conference, the
Raptors, has a playoff absence similar to Boston's. But if Vince
Carter, the Raptors' creative leaper, continues to find loopholes
in the laws of gravity, Toronto's playoff path will be opened this
season.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is annoying to the Celtics. It's like a kid who has
never been to Disney World listening to everyone else talk about
their visit. It may be overrated but _ so what? _ it still would be
nice to say you have been. The Celtics desperately want to make the
playoffs. You can sense that from talking with Rick Pitino, Antoine
Walker, or Paul Pierce. But The Streak will reach five seasons if
the team can't rid itself of a recurring problem.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, the Celtics play as though they are afraid to leave
the house. They have a video specialist and shot specialist on
staff. They might want to consider hiring a hypnotist who can find
out the root of their road phobia. At the FleetCenter, they are one
of the most competitive teams in basketball. On the road? You could
gather the bunch you play with at the local Y, put them against the
Celtics, and _ we're not saying you'd win _ you'd have to like your
chances in the last two minutes. The Celtics are so unstable away
from home that you almost root for them to go through road rage so
they can snap out of it.
</P>
<P>
   Celtics at home: 10-5.
</P>
<P>
   Celtics away from home: 1-10 (including 10 losses in a row).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame, because we're actually pretty good this year,''
Walker said. ``If I knew what the problem was, I'd tell you. It
seems like guys get hot against us. Unknown guys play against us on
the road and have career nights.''
</P>
<P>
   As Walker said, he would tell if he knew. So it's not surprising
that he revealed only part of the problem. When the Celtics lost to
the Clippers Sunday, the Unknown Theory was valid. Only hard-core
NBA fans outside of Greater Los Angeles know about the talents of
Tyrone Nesby. And not many people would look at 260-pound Maurice
Taylor and conclude that he is most comfortable away from the
basket, taking jump shots. Taylor impressed the Staples Center
crowd a few times by dribbling behind his back and between his
legs, as if Sacramento Kings point guard Jason Williams had jumped
into his body and was secretly controlling his movements.
</P>
<P>
   But anonymous players aren't the only problem for Boston. ``If
we make our free throws in Philadelphia, we win that game,'' Pitino
said. If they don't have a phantom call go against them in Chicago;
if they don't blow a 14-point lead in Atlanta; if they make a big
play or two in New York . . .
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics know they can afford to be mediocre on the road.
They can even get away with being far below average. What they
cannot be is what they have been, and that is embarrassing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to win the next two games,'' Walker said. ``We have
to. If we win these next two games, we'll be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   He was reminded that the next two games are against the Kings
Tuesday night at Arco Arena and against the Nuggets Thursday at
Pepsi Arena. Both teams are tough to beat when they are at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care,'' Walker said. ``We need these.''
</P>
<P>
   The games seem to be more urgent when you glance at the
standings. The Bulls are clearly the worst team in the East and in
all of basketball, so the Celtics won't descend to that level. But
the teams ahead of the Bulls, New Jersey and Washington, have 10
wins; the Celtics have 11. So if the Celtics can't win the next two
games, they might find themselves at the bottom of the Atlantic or
very close to it when they return to Boston on New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   But that's going too far ahead. First, the Celtics play the
Kings. As we all know, Sacramento is not close to North Station.
So, what to do about this away-from-home stage fright?
</P>
<P>
   ``Get enough rest at night?'' Danny Fortson said with a shrug.
</P>
<P>
   If that's what is bothering this team, the Celtics should win
this game by 20 points. Let's just say that the lights usually
don't stay on late in Sacramento. Anyway, Fortson has a point. It's
better to rest now when there are games to play. That's better than
the involuntary rest that comes in the spring when you are sent
home for not making the playoffs.

NASDAQ SETS A RECORD, DESPITE SELL-OFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Nasdaq stock exchange topped out at its highest level ever
Monday, despite a sharp post-Christmas sell-off in Internet
commerce stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index, loaded with Internet-related stocks,
closed at 3,975.38, up 5.94. The index has now set seven
consecutive closing records. Monday, though, it was down for most
of the day, as Internet retailers took a beating.
</P>
<P>
   The slump may have been kicked off by BancBoston Robertson
Stephens &AMP; Co. analyst Lauren Cooks Levitan's decision to cut her
rating on eToys, one of the best-known on-line retailers, from
``buy'' to ``long-term attractive,'' based on concerns customers
might be dissatisfied with eToys's service.
</P>
<P>
   Another possible factor was a report from PC Data Inc., a
Reston, Va., market research firm. It said that on-line sales the
week before Christmas reached just $884 million, compared to over
$1.2 billion the week before.
</P>
<P>
   Investors may have used both these reports as an excuse to cash
in some of their e-commerce shares. For example, eToys fell 5 to 25
15/16. Amazon.com, the biggest Web-based store, fell 8 7/8 to 81
1/8; the popular Web auction service eBay dropped 8 5/16 to 134.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, analysts still think Web retailers turned in a
strong performance. ``I think it was a phenomenal e-commerce
holiday season,'' said Jill Frankle of Gomez Advisors in Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   Her optimism is shared by Carrie Johnson, an e-commerce watcher
at Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass. Forrester, she said, is
standing by its prediction of $8 billion in retail Internet sales
in the last quarter of 1999, with $4 billion in Christmas sales.
She also estimated that 7 million more people will have shopped on
line this holiday season than in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   While individual retailers have yet to release sales figures,
there are some positive signs. Yahoo Inc. said sales on its
shopping site were five times higher than during the 1998 holiday
season. As a result, Yahoo helped counter the decline of other
Nasdaq e-commerce issues. Yahoo shares soared 12 3/8 to 415.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 14.68 to 11,391.08, after
rising as much as 69 points earlier in the day.

 &HT;    Falcons win gives Reeves a reason to smile
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Dan Reeves was several minutes early to his Monday
news conference, the first sign something was different. Reeves
usually is on time or, after a couple miserable losses when tape
review dragged on, a little late.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons had engaged in a number of unusual things a day
earlier, when they beat the Cardinals 37-14.
</P>
<P>
   The victory led to an obvious question for the coach of 4-11
team. If your team could play so well once, why not more often?
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to keep it in perspective,'' Reeves said. ``We were
playing a team that was really banged up and beat up.'' The
Cardinals (6-9) were so beat up that in the second half, linebacker
Patrick Sapp, a quarterback at Clemson, played defensive end.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Falcons deserve credit for playing well.
They ran the ball a season-high 163 rushing yards, held Arizona to
77 rushing yards, and won the turnover battle 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday was the first game all season the Falcons did not give up
at least one run of 14 or more yards. Arizona's best was an
8-yarder.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly, the victory stemmed from the timing of when the
Falcons were able to ``catch'' an opponent, Reeves said. The
Falcons also had three key offensive players return from injury:
Chris Chancler completed 14 of 23 passes for 230 yards and a
touchdown, Byron Hanspart ran 26 times for a career-high 102 yards
and Tim Dwight caught three passes for 52 yards. Last season, the
Falcons went 14-2 against a weak schedule. This season, their
opponents are a combined 114-96, and have included playoff teams
St. Louis (13-2) twice, Jacksonville (13-2), Tennessee (12-3),
Tampa Bay (10-5) and Minnesota (9-6).
</P>
<P>
   But for a minus-three turnover deficit, they might have beaten
the Vikings instead of losing 17-14. In two other games, the
Falcons didn't trail Tampa Bay until there were 58 seconds left in
what became a 19-10 loss, and they battled Tennessee to a 20-17
deficit after three quarters despite six turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   However, they also lost games they should have won, 19-13 in
overtime to 8-7 Baltimore and 13-9 at 6-9 Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   In the past five games, the offense has turned in four of its
five most productive performances, with totals of 343, 361, 338 and
Sunday's 393 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The exception was the loss at San Francisco, where they had a
season-low 105 yards against a poor 49ers team. The Falcons finish
the season against San Francisco on Monday night in the Dome with
third place in the NFC West at stake.
</P>
<P>
   The last game of the season, thankfully, will be in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without question, offensively it was the best game that we
have had this year,'' Reeves said. ``I think this is the first time
all year that we have met all of our goals offensively.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ On its face, it is no great shakes that Russia's
sixth-biggest oil company, Sibneft, unveiled a spiffy new
green-and-blue logo in April. What makes it a symbolic symbol
indeed is the logo's two flavors: traditional Cyrillic, for
Russians _ and English, for most everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   For an industry that has exemplified this nation's
hand-on-the-throat style of business, there may be no better
metaphor. Russia's oil tycoons largely founded their empires
through dark-of-night political deals and squeezing out
competitors, and until lately they have run their companies pretty
much the same way.
</P>
<P>
   But now, if the barons themselves are to be believed, the era of
wildcatter capitalism is over. The new mantra of Russian oil
companies is the same one invoked in the worsted-wool realm of
Western business: corporate strategies, transparent finances,
independent directors, professional managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia is following the world trend,'' Sibneft's
Fordham-educated president, Yevgeny Schvidler, said in a recent
interview. ``Sometimes, it is in front of the trend.''
</P>
<P>
   There remains but one hitch: Just as with spiffy new logos, not
everyone is ready to believe that the transformations are much more
than symbolic.
</P>
<P>
   Sibneft is in some ways a test case of whether the industry can
reinvent itself _ or whether it really wants to. From their
European-style headquarters on the very toniest stretch of
downtown's Moscow River bank, executives say they are remaking the
company in the image of global business _ and, to an extent,
experts agree.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the company has issued Russia's first
corporate governance charter, a document that sets out rules for
treating all shareholders fairly, and agreed to give outsiders two
seats on its board. And in the spring it began selling its shares
on secondary international markets in the form of American drawing
rights. The company is gunning for full listing on foreign
exchanges in the years ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Sibneft is one of a handful of Russian companies whose books are
audited according to ``generally accepted accounting practices,''
meaning that results are reported using the same rules that apply
to foreign companies. And unlike other big Russian petroleum
companies, it pledges to make public the identities of its major
shareholders, probably next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia's most progressive oil company,'' Sibneft boasts in an
advertisement that ran recently in one local newspaper. And
analysts say that could be true.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, they caution, is that the competition is not
especially stiff. Russian oil companies, Sibneft included, are
saddled with such murky and occasionally devious pasts that
international business rules are still a novelty for many. And even
well-run companies are enmeshed in Russia's treacherous politics,
where a single misstep can have serious consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has its share of well-run companies: Lukoil, the biggest,
is also making strides toward more open operations, and
Surgutneftegaz, No. 3, is seen as downright conservative. But
Western investors know from bitter experience not to take them at
face value.
</P>
<P>
   The country's second-biggest oil company, Yukos, used stock
issues to move much of itself offshore earlier this year in an
attempt to skirt creditors and minority shareholders, including the
American financier Kenneth Dart.
</P>
<P>
   BP-Amoco sank $571 million into Russia's No. 5 oil company,
Sidanko, in 1997, only to discover that its books concealed massive
debts. The company went bankrupt, and a politically attuned Russian
oil company, Tyumen, has since picked off some of Sidanko's most
valuable assets in what skeptics charge is a rigged bankruptcy
court. Last week, though, it agreed to return a prized Siberian oil
field to BP-Amoco's control.
</P>
<P>
   The industry is legendary for its schemes to launder oil money,
mislabeling products and manipulating sales prices to move profits
into offshore banks and away from shareholders and government
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Such behavior may not be excusable, analysts say, but it is
explained easily enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to remember that this is an industry where the
primary interest, at least until a couple of years ago, was to get
the cash and run,'' Vittorio Juncker, a petroleum analyst for the
World Bank in London, said in a recent interview. ``Oil was one of
the best ways in which you could accumulate financial reserves
outside Russia. A lot of private fortunes have been built on
that.''
</P>
<P>
   It is precisely that sort of reputation that Sibneft officials
say they are leaving behind. And for good reason: Increasingly,
being a traditional Russian oil company can be dangerous to one's
corporate health.
</P>
<P>
   Sibneft is only about four years old, but already its past is
not pretty. Like a number of leading oil companies, Sibneft sprang
from a now-notorious program called ``loans for shares,'' in which
the Kremlin handed out stakes in major industries _ almost always
to insider friends _ as collateral for loans it never repaid.
</P>
<P>
   In Sibneft's case, a company tied to Boris Berezovsky, the
tycoon and political lightning rod who was Boris Yeltsin's
re-election campaign financier, won the rights to 51 percent of the
stock in 1995. In return for a $100 million loan, he got control of
a company then valued at roughly $600 million, including Russia's
best oil refinery and proven petroleum reserves larger than those
of Texaco.
</P>
<P>
   Several insider deals, a lawsuit and a hotly disputed auction
later, a single group _ unidentified, so far _ controls some 90
percent of the company. Both Sibneft and Berezovsky now insist that
he has no financial interest in the company, which seems to be
dominated by an equally wealthy Berezovsky associate and friend of
Yeltsin, Roman Abramovich.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholder or not, Berezovsky seems lashed to the company in
the eyes of his enemies. As prime minister last February, the most
prominent of those enemies, Yevgeny Primakov, engineered a
nine-hour police raid on Sibneft's headquarters, seizing
surveillance equipment to bolster charges that Berezovsky spied on
political figures. Berezovsky denies the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin fired Primakov last summer, and he is now seen as a
major contender in next June's presidential elections. That could
bode ill: Primakov's allies in the Otechestvo party have talked of
revoking the supposedly rigged loans-for-shares deals, with Sibneft
dead in their sights.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic problem of the controlling shareholders is that
they're very sensitive to the political environment,'' said Ivan
Mazalov, an oil-industry analyst at Troika Dialog, a Moscow
brokerage firm. ``They have lots of powerful friends. And they have
quite a few enemies who, should they come to power, would certainly
make efforts to settle scores.''
</P>
<P>
   Sibneft's president, Schvindler, says he is well aware of the
hazards of hitching a company's fortunes to politicians, and has
erected a corporate barrier between politics and business that is
``higher than a Chinese wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Sibneft nevertheless continues to benefit from government favors
like its inclusion in a food-for-oil exchange with Iraq. News
reports suggest that it could receive more favored treatment in a
looming selloff of government oil assets, an apparent pre-election
move by the Kremlin to shore up corporate political backing.
</P>
<P>
   Sibneft also supplies petroleum from its Omsk refinery to an
oil-trading company run in part by Yeltsin's son-in-law, Leonid
Dyachenko. Schvindler says the relationship began well before
Sibneft took over the Omsk refinery and, in any case, that the
dealings are at arm's length.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Sibneft has moved with growing speed to convince
foreigners of its legitimacy since Schvindler took over the top job
in 1998. And ``at some point you have to allow a company a chance
to become a good corporate citizen,'' said Eric Wigertz, an analyst
in the Moscow office of Brunswick Warburg. ``Sibneft is taking some
good steps, at least on paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, the company settled a venomous dispute this
spring with Dart, perhaps the industry's most vociferous critic, by
giving him representation on Sibneft's board in exchange for
agreement to roll an oil-extraction subsidiary _ and Dart's shares
in it _ into the larger company.
</P>
<P>
   Schvindler also has plans to halt a financial slide that some
credit to a lack of oil-savvy management during the early and
mid-'90s. Oil production in Sibneft's fields has fallen almost
every year this decade, and will remain low in 1999. Investment has
sunk to half its 1996 level in the wake of last year's economic
crash.
</P>
<P>
   But the company will also pay down nearly three-fourths of its
debt by the end of this year, analysts say, and it has teamed up
with the international oil-services company Schlumberger to tease
more oil from aging wells.
</P>
<P>
   Sibneft has also announced plans for a network of more than
1,000 retail gas stations _ still a novelty in Russia, where most
stations are literally mom-and-pop operations. Most will be in
Siberia, where the company has a natural monopoly. Experts say that
owning the stations will allow Sibneft to maintain cash flow and
profits even when oil prices fall.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But Sibneft, they add, still has to settle two important
matters. One is that its major partner in petroleum exports is a
Gibraltar company, Runicom, which is not only owned by Sibneft
management, but which itself owns 10 percent of Sibneft.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Sibneft open to the charge that it has funneled
profits to managers by selling its oil to Runicom at a discount;
such internal transactions are not public. Schvindler says the
company does not manipulate oil prices now, if it ever did, and
adds that the general figures in its latest audit back up that
claim.
</P>
<P>
   The second is Sibneft's still-secret ownership, which some
critics say could be disclosed in short order if the company were
genuinely committed to openness. Schvindler says it is not that
easy. In Russia, the wealthy are marked people, by criminals and
government alike, and pulling back the veil on ownership is a long
and complex process.
</P>
<P>
   Some suspect that process began early this month, when more than
40 percent of Sibneft shares were shifted from a company believed
to be controlled by Berezovsky to a Russian bank. Others say the
shift was a defensive move to prevent Primakov from linking
Berezovsky to Sibneft in the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   This is how business is conducted in Russia, at least for the
moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're moving in the right direction,'' James Henderson,
director of research at Renaissance Capital, a Moscow investment
bank, said of Sibneft's managers. ``But an investment community
which has become very, very cynical about Russia _ and with good
reason _ will be very skeptical about whether they're really
playing by the rules or just putting up a facade.''

 &HT;    Century at 100: Florida town celebrates its biggest birthday
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CENTURY, Fla. _ They'll ring in the new year here with miniature
pony rides, a pie eating contest, ugliest man competition,
fireworks and horseshoes.
</P>
<P>
   Why not welcome the coming millennium, organizers figure, in a
place named for the last turn of the century?
</P>
<P>
   No one's quite seen anything like it in this former lumber town
of 2,500 people, which has been in an economic coma since the mill
shut down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt it would be more well received this year given the
name of the town,'' said Century accountant Ann Brooks, who helped
organize the celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Billboards promote the event all along U.S. 29.
</P>
<P>
   When Michigan businessman Russell Alger needed to expand his
timber empire in 1900, he purchased 250,000 acres of forest here in
northwest Florida that included a black community then called
Teaspoon. A train station took the name of the community.
</P>
<P>
   In 1901, Alger _ a former Michigan governor and secretary of war
under President McKinley until he resigned after being criticized
for lack of military preparation prior to the Spanish-American War
_ rejected a push to rename the remote Florida station for himself.
But he agreed to a later suggestion, brought on by the calendar:
Century.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the town's Historical Society today brag they haven't
been able to find another town in the nation named Century.
</P>
<P>
   Remnants of the old Alger-Sullivan Lumber Co. are scattered
throughout Century's historic district, where Spanish moss cascades
down the branches of towering oak trees.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few generations ago, moonshiners and honky-tonks pervaded
the dense woods and flatlands along the Escambia River.
</P>
<P>
   In pockets of town, poverty lingers. Crack cocaine dealing has
replaced bootlegging. Despite an economic boom throughout the
South, Century's unemployment rate soars near 20 percent. Many
residents are on welfare.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the lumber company left town, they left behind a whole
lot of people who depended on them for everything,'' said Century
Mayor Benny Barnes. ``When they left, they took a whole lot of the
leaders with them.''
</P>
<P>
   There's been some resurgence. A state prison built about 10
years ago has provided jobs. A nearby industrial park has attracted
medical companies. In the 1970s, the Florida town of South Flomaton
annexed the community of Century, then changed the name of the
whole entity to Century.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Piggly Wiggly is the only grocery store in town.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just not lots here,'' said Daniel Moore, Piggly Wiggly
manager. ``So you have to go other places if you want to get a job
and you're going to be a professional.''
</P>
<P>
   Chicken crackled as the mayor dropped freshly floured pieces in
a black kettle of boiling oil fired by a propane burner set up
behind the police station. As he does every year, Barnes cooked for
the annual City Hall Christmas party.
</P>
<P>
   In one way, Century is more advanced than a lot of places.
Rather than fret over whether the town's 7-year-old computers would
survive Y2K problems on New Year's Day, Century spent $20,000 on
new ones. A generator is hooked up to City Hall to keep them
running.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people think the lights might go off,'' Barnes said.
``There might be some things happen we haven't thought about.''
</P>
<P>
   There will even be a generator hooked up to the lights at the
city park _ named for Century native and Arizona Diamondbacks
manager Buck Showalter _ when the town's millennium celebration
begins Dec. 31. A crowd of 7,000 is expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people that would not be happy here,'' said resident
Margaret Collier, 73. ``We are not a sophisticated town. But if you
want good, hearty people, then they're here.''
</P>

CENSUS BUREAU TRIES TO EASE PRIVACY FEARS AS 2000 COUNT
APPROACHES 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By CARL HULSE   
 NYT Regional Newspapers   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Census Bureau was embarrassed. After all, it
hopes to induce all U.S. residents to take part in the upcoming
head count, even those here under sketchy circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Without a second thought, the federal office-leasing agency
located the new Tucson, Ariz., census headquarters in a building
recently vacated by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the
bane of illegal aliens. Such a coincidence was hardly reassuring to
Hispanic immigrants already nervous that the census data could be
used against them.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a 24-hour flap,'' said a rueful Kenneth Prewitt, the
census director who, upon learning of the snafu, immediately
directed the General Services Administration to find an alternative
site.
</P>
<P>
   Such quick action cannot resolve all confidentiality concerns
that could hold down the response rate to the 2000 Census, a
massive undertaking set to launch April 1.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers, privacy experts and others fear that anxiety about
releasing personal data to a government agency _ heightened in this
information age _ could cause some people to refuse to return their
census forms.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is absolutely a concern, there is no question about it,''
said Rep. Dan Miller, R-Fla., who chairs the House Subcommittee on
the Census.
</P>
<P>
   Evan Hendricks, editor of a Washington newsletter on privacy
issues, agrees growing public nervousness over the security of
personal financial and medical records could harm the capability of
the Census Bureau to take a full tally.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is definitely a rising tide of dissatisfaction when
people are asked for personal information,'' he said. ``The Census
Bureau is really going to feel that this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt concedes that today's information-sensitive culture
presents a hurdle for his agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``This country is on a collision course between its desire for
information as we move into the next century and its deep
commitment to privacy and confidentiality,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Prewitt and others say the Census Bureau has serious
safeguards in place to protect its information as well as ample
evidence of their effectiveness. The main challenge facing the
bureau is to spread the word about what it views as its exceptional
standards of confidentiality.

<P>
   Some of the history of census privacy has already passed into
lore, such as the agency's refusal to hand over local census data
to the Secret Service when President Truman was considering
Washington neighborhoods to live in during White House renovations.
Census data is protected by law, and anyone who releases it can be
imprisoned for up to five years. No other federal agency has the
authority to inspect personal census files.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a very, very strong record,'' said the census
director. ``No reporter, however enterprising, will be able to find
a single person in the United States who says, `I filled out the
census form and the following happened to me because the
information got shared.' It didn't happen. Not to a single
person.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of an extensive outreach program to encourage full
participation in the census, the bureau for the first time is
launching a paid advertising campaign, spending $167 million on
print, television and billboard advertising, even T-shirts and
bumper stickers.
</P>
<P>
   The message, which will be almost inescapable in the coming
months, is that failing to respond to the census can harm one's
community by reducing government aid distributed on the basis of
population and that any information provided is guaranteed to
remain confidential.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign will be nationwide but is heavily targeting
minority communities that can be difficult to reach in the
decennial operation. The Census Bureau estimates the typical
African-American media consumer will see a census message 122 times
between now and the end of the census period this spring and the
typical Hispanic 105 times.
</P>
<P>
   Census officials are also working with community groups such as
the Catholic Church to involve them in convincing their members of
the importance of the census.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the bureau still anticipates a response rate to its
initial mail campaign of just 61 percent, a projection the General
Accounting Office recently judged optimistic given the downward
trend in recent censuses. The rate has steadily dropped from 78
percent in 1970 _ the first year of the mail-out, mail-back survey
_ to 70 percent in 1980 and 65 percent in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``This declining trend is due, in part, to various demographic,
attitudinal and other factors, such as concerns over privacy and
mistrust of government,'' said the report from the GAO, the
watchdog for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt said the agency's extensive research shows that 7-8
percent of the public is predisposed to not participate in the
census, citing privacy as among their reasons. The proportion runs
higher in some minority communities where residents fear real
repercussions _ such as deportation _ from cooperating.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get these pockets of the population who are concerned
because the stakes are much higher,'' Prewitt said.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who noted he was sworn to secrecy when he visited a
Census Bureau office outside Washington, said it is not only recent
immigrants who might resist the enumeration because of privacy
worries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wealthy people have the concern as much as the people on the
mountaintop in Montana or the illegal immigrants in Texas and
Florida,'' he said. ``The gated community on Longboat Key might be
just as difficult to count as the migrant camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt said he believes steps the agency is taking should limit
the role privacy fears will play in depressing participation. He
believes extensive follow-up to the mailing will result in a nearly
full count.
</P>
<P>
   And, despite GAO warnings that the bureau might not be ready for
the millennial count now only three months away, Prewitt is upbeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are feeling very good about where we are,'' he said.
``Everything we want to have in place for today, is in place.''

   Y2K-PUBLIC (Undated) _ With four days until the year 2000,
government officials, company managers and computer experts are
waiting anxiously to see if the public will remain calm. Not
everyone is sure that the computers and the machinery in which they
are often embedded will perform flawlessly as they roll past
midnight and encounter Year 2000. But the prevailing view is that
the technical glitches are likely to have limited economic and
social impact. Bigger disruptions could come, the experts say, from
unwarranted stockpiling and large withdrawals from banks. By

Russia's sixth-biggest oil company, Sibneft, unveiled a spiffy new

indeed is the logo's two flavors: traditional Cyrillic, for
Russians, and English, for almost everyone else. For an industry
that has exemplified this nation's hand-on-the-throat style of
business, there may be no better metaphor. By Michael Wines.

   BISHKEK, Kyrgyzstan _ In a studio above the art school where she
teaches, Begaim Tenizbaeva turns out brightly colored and unusually
shaped ceramics. Her table sets are not only highly original in
their conception and execution, they also refer directly to her
Kyrgyz heritage.
</P>
<P>
   A sugar bowl is not, as it first seems, simply made in an odd
shape. Its shape is modeled on that of a yurt, the domed felt tent
in which Kyrgyz nomads have lived since time immemorial.
</P>
<P>
   The teapot that accompanies this bowl is made in the shape of
the traditional vats in which Kyrgyz villagers cook their food. It
also refers to the shape of the calpac, the tall felt hat worn by
many Kyrgyz men, which in turn reflects the profile of the towering
mountains that cover most of this country.
</P>
<P>
   Vases in Ms. Tenizbaeva's studios bear narrow strips of painted
figures. They are adapted from some of the thousands of ancient
petroglyphs that have been found on rocks in eastern Kyrgyzstan.
</P>
<P>
   The applied arts are vibrantly alive here, and not surprisingly
many of their leading practitioners are strongly influenced by
their native land. They are working to combine Western ideas of
abstraction with their Central Asian heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in my blood,'' Ms. Tenizbaeva said. ``No matter how much
I want to move toward art that is purely modern, the Kyrgyz
influence comes out in my work. It's not just shapes, but also
ideas and concepts that come out of the legends I heard from my
grandparents when I was a child.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tenizbaeva, 45, is one of several dozen artists here who are
taking a new approach not only to ceramics, but also to clothing,
jewelry and various forms of installation. Their work, while
modern, seeks to embody Kyrgyz tradition.
</P>
<P>
   This movement emerged in the late 1970s and thrived for about a
decade. It was set back by the social upheaval that followed the
collapse of the Soviet Union but has strongly re-established itself
in the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't call it an artistic current, because the art scene
in Kyrgyzstan is too small to have currents,'' said Valery Ruppel,
an artist known for his felt constructions. ``But we do feel our
roots very strongly. It's something that maintains our identity,
even while we follow a very contemporary sensibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruppel is one of the most successful of Kyrgyzstan's artists,
and the felt that he favors is the most traditional of Kyrgyz
materials. His works are largely abstract, but many seem to include
the shapes of the rivers and mountains that define this country's
rugged geography.
</P>
<P>
   The rectangular constructions that he has been making for the
last few years hang in the homes of several foreigners here in
Bishkek, and others are in European collections. But just as this
work is becoming recognized, he has moved away from them and begun
making free-standing installations.
</P>
<P>
   His ability to change directions like this reflects one
advantage that artists have in post-Soviet countries. Their local
market is limited, and much of the little that they earn comes from
foreigners, but life is relatively inexpensive, so artists can
survive by selling only modest numbers of works.
</P>
<P>
   When Kyrgyzstan became independent in 1991, Bishkek was
transformed from a remote provincial outpost in the Soviet
hinterland to a national capital. Foreign entrepreneurs, diplomats
and aid workers began moving here, and they provided a market for
Western-influenced work that still puzzles some Kyrgyz.
</P>
<P>
   To cater to this market, and also to the growing numbers of
Kyrgyz who are becoming interested in what applied artists are
creating here, a shop called Tamur opened a few months ago on one
of Bishkek's main streets.
</P>
<P>
   A steady flow of patrons, some from Kyrgyzstan and others from
abroad, passed through the shop on a recent morning. One bought a
striking pair of earrings made from silver and native gems. Another
settled on a chic felt vest with a traditional pattern discreetly
woven into the hem.
</P>
<P>
   Other items on display included ceramic and metal plates, all
with unusual designs; a lampshade decorated with motifs inspired by
the country's famous symbolic petroglyphs; evocative pendants in
the shape of yurts; and a 4-foot-tall clock made from sculptured
iron.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put on workshops here where masters show young people how
they work,'' said Aynura Ashirakhmanova, one of the shop's
managers. ``We also have fashion shows, and you can see that our
designers are making pieces that are really high fashion, although
they do have Kyrgyz themes. Every piece in here has a spiritual
memory.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Kyrgyz are nominally Muslim, but many feel closer to
pre-Islamic beliefs that stress spiritualism and the mystic power
of mountains, animals and natural forces. Shamanism is still
common. More than a few people in rural areas wear talismans around
their necks and keep ancient symbols, like one made from 40 sheep
femurs, in their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you go into a yurt, you get a special feeling,'' said
Shamil Dayarbekov, a renowned jeweler who also makes constructions
and sculptures from metal, leather, or any other object that speaks
to his Kyrgyz soul. ``It's complex, but there's no excess.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that spirit is what animates the applied arts here,''
Dayarbekov said. ``Fine art only came to Kyrgyzstan at the
beginning of this century, but we always had a rich tradition of
folk arts and crafts. What we're doing today is using modern
approaches to art in a way that reflects our own artistic and
spiritual heritage.''

VIOLENT STORM KILLS DOZENS IN EUROPE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Blocking off most of an intersection in one of this
city's most expensive neighborhoods, David Chezeaud stretched a
plastic tape from a light pole to the entrance of La Muete subway
stop.
</P>
<P>
   But no one objected. Scattered in the street were the remains of
two chimney stacks that had crumbled under the pressure of the 95
mph winds that accompanied Sunday's storm, including three boulders
that had fallen six stories to the pavement without shattering.
</P>
<P>
   Already workers had begun putting up scaffolding to prop what
was left of the chimneys belonging to a turn-of-the-century
apartment house. But Chezeaud, a contractor hired by the city to
help clean up, said it could be days before the sidewalk was
pronounced safe for passage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I was born, I've never seen anything like that storm,''
said Chezeaud. ``All over Paris there are problems like this.''
</P>
<P>
   The swath of Europe hit by Sunday's fierce storm tried to pick
itself up Monday. But the damage caused by the freak gales _ which
in some areas reached 110 mph _ was clearly formidable. In Paris
the roofers union estimated that there had been nearly $80 million
of damage to roofs and chimneys alone.
</P>
<P>
   France was hit hardest, with hundreds injured and at least 44
people dead, most from collapsing roofs and falling trees. But at
least another 40 people were killed in weather-related incidents in
southern Germany and Switzerland, Britain, Belgium, Spain and
Italy.
</P>
<P>
   In some parts of western Europe, main highways remained closed
because of fallen trees, which lay like pick-up sticks across
traffic lanes. Train service continued to be disrupted and airports
reported long delays. By evening some 900,000 homes in France were
still lacking electricity. And bracing for another storm, Air
France canceled its flights to most of the country's southwest
airports.
</P>
<P>
   But during the day, the clean-up began. Along the streets of
Paris, towing companies started collecting the cars that had been
so damaged by falling debris that they could not be moved on their
own. Work crews recaptured garbage cans swept into odd nooks, and
outside the stately National Assembly the shattered remains of a
small glass guard booth _ usually home to a half-frozen gendarme _
was carefully swept into a neat pile and carted away.
</P>
<P>
   The list of historic sites that had suffered some damage in the
storm grew.
</P>
<P>
   Officials reported that some stained-glass windows were broken
in the newly restored Notre Dame Cathedral and in the small gothic
Sainte-Chapelle, and that the roofs of both the National Library
and the Pantheon were damaged.
</P>
<P>
   Also the home of Balzac _ now a museum _ in the 16th
arrondissement was badly damaged when a falling tree smashed
through its roof. The National Fund for Historic Sites and
Monuments estimated that it would take upward of $75 million to
repair cultural monuments.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking off his vacation in Egypt, Prime Minister Lionel Jospin
returned to France, stopping at Versailles to assess the damage
there: 10,000 trees were uprooted in the royal park, windows were
shattered and officials were worried that water might leak through
parts of the roof. Even Jospin's official residence, Hotel
Matignon, was battered by the storm, suffering damage to the roof.
Huge sections of the fencing around the garden also fell down.
</P>
<P>
   As experts surveyed the damage, Versailles stayed closed to the
public, as did many other public sites, frustrating tourists.
Outside the Sainte Chapelle, Claudia Springfeld, 17, a German who
was visiting Paris with her boyfriend for three days, had to settle
for his description of the stained glass, which they could not get
in to see. ``It is not quite the same thing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials also reported that about 70,000 of the 300,000 trees
in the Boulogne and Vincennes forests had been toppled or badly
damaged. Another 3,000 trees elsewhere in Paris were uprooted.
</P>
<P>
   Francoise de Panafieu, Paris' deputy mayor in charge of parks
and gardens, called the storm an ``ecological disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It will take us years to get back to where we were,'' she
said. ``Just cleaning up the woods will take us three years. It
will take decades for real restoration.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Intercity trains gradually restarted Monday, some looking more
like rush-hour subway cars because passengers who had spent the
night waiting for service crammed aboard even if there were no
seats available. Still, complaining was rampant. Many passengers
said they had been given little information while they waited.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers in large cities such as Lille and Lyon spent the
night in emergency lodgings in sports halls or youth hostels, where
Red Cross volunteers gave them breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Despite improvements, service was still not available between
Paris and parts of Switzerland at the end of the day. Train
officials promised to do better Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In many villages, the sound of buzz saws clearing through fallen
branches dominated the day. But the job remained enormous and many
roadways still needed to be cleared. While meteorologists had
predicted Sunday's storm, they had not anticipated such strong
winds. In many areas the winds were the strongest ever recorded.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's never been anything like this,'' said Transport
Minister Jean-Claude Gayssot. ``Obviously, because it was unique
and exceptional, we were far less prepared than if it were
something that had happened before.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Britain, where eight people died, warned that
hundreds of homes were still at risk from severe flooding over the
next two days. Some 270 rivers across southern Britain remained on
flood alert, and more bad weather is expected.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, where the storm killed at least 15 people, some
highways and many smaller roads _ especially in the Stuttgart area
_ were still blocked by trees. Train service was widely disrupted.
</P>
<P>
   The tornadolike winds also ravaged property throughout
Switzerland, where 11 people died, including two in a ski gondola
brought down in the Alps.
</P>
<P>
   ``We forget from time to time that nature has its own rules,''
said the president of Switzerland, Ruth Dreifuss.

 &HT;    A (quick) history of Florida
 &HT;    (EDS: PHOTOS AVAILABLE. This story exists of cutlines for

<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Florida, the ``Land of Flowers,'' seems
nakedly new, built yesterday or the day before. In fact we are in
our 10,000th year of human habitation, our 486th year of recorded
history, our 154th year of statehood.
</P>
<P>
   St. Augustine, America's oldest city, was founded in 1565, one
year after Michelangelo died, one year after William Shakespeare
was born. The oldest fossil, a tiny trilobite known as Colpocoryphe
exsul, was found in a test oil well shaft in Madison County and may
be 225 million years old.
</P>
<P>
   But so many of us are newcomers that we live in an amnesiac daze
when it comes to days gone by. In South and Central Florida
particularly, ``Before Disney,'' or ``Before I-95'' betokens vast,
almost Egyptian antiquity.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time we have no time for old time's sake.
</P>
<P>
   We like to bulldoze reality and put up fantasies. Disney is only
the largest. Silver Springs' glass-bottomed boats have been peering
into crystal depths for over a century. Opa-Locka was conceived as
a Moorish fantasy town in the 1920s by aviator Glenn Curtis. Sea
World is safely ashore, near Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   In fact much of Florida's history over the past 1,000 years must
be re-created, re-enacted, to be seen. Outside of St. Augustine,
outside of some old towns in North Florida where the light of elder
days still shines on old brick-faced downtowns and oak-shaded
graveyards, our yesterdays have been scanted for our big tomorrows.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a brief, backward glance, a small record of our comings
and goings. Much has come and gone, never to come again.
</P>
<P>
   Dreams of empire
</P>
<P>
   Discoverer of Florida on Easter Sunday, March 27, 1513 _ he
named the place Pascua de Florida, ``Easter of Flowers'' _ Juan
Ponce de Leon had accompanied Christopher Columbus on his second
voyage. A hard-bitten warrior who had earlier conquered Puerto
Rico, he led two expeditions to the state, both bloody failures,
and was forced to return to Cuba where he died of wounds suffered
in an Indian attack near Charlotte Harbor in 1521. Here, Robert
Hall of the Historic Florida Militia wears clothing and armor
similar to that carried by the Spaniards _ though chain mail
couldn't protect them from flint-tipped arrows. Ponce failed to
find the fabled Fountain of Youth, but his expedition was the first
to experience the powerful Gulf Stream, an ocean current running
north off the Florida coast.
</P>
<P>
   Bow and curtsy
</P>
<P>
   Public education in Florida was practically nonexistent before
1870 and schools were segregated until the 1960s. Children learned
to read from McGuffey's Readers and as late as the turn of the
century were taught to recite the alphabet forward and _ useless
skill! _ backward.
</P>
<P>
   At the Little Red Schoolhouse in Palm Beach, Janice Owens
re-creates an 1890s schoolhouse scene for the children of
Wellington's Panther Run Elementary School, teaching boys how to
bow, girls how to curtsy. Lunch might be a big wedge of cornbread,
washed down with cool water from the pump _ no Big Macs, no
Mountain Dew. At recess the girls might skip rope, while the boys
play ``Steal the Bacon.''
</P>
<P>
   Discipline was a ruler whapped across the palm of the hand.
Metal detectors and in-school sheriff's deputies lay 90 years in
the future.
</P>
<P>
   Conch solo
</P>
<P>
   Wynne Tatman of St. Augustine sounds a faraway trumpet note on a
conch shell, as Timucuan Indians did thousands of years ago, before
successive waves of Spanish, English and American settlers pushed
them into extinction. When Ponce de Leon sailed the Florida
coastline in 1513 there were an estimated 350,000 Native Americans
living here, and impressive mounds still exist at Crystal River and
Estero on the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Stubbornest, most resistant, are the Seminoles _ relative
latecomers to Florida, pushed south by white settlers from Georgia.
Today they sell cigarettes and gambling chips to us, we who once
despoiled them of their land and kidnapped their chief, Osceola,
under a flag of truce. They have never signed a peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Muscular Christianity
</P>
<P>
   Cross and sword seem one and the same as sandal-shod National
Park Ranger Chuck Dale strides through the streets of St. Augustine
in a swirl of black robes, during a recent re-enactment of English
privateer Sir Francis Drake's raid on the Spanish settlement. The
nearby Mission of Nombre de Dios is the oldest Catholic shrine in
the U.S., dating to 1577.
</P>

   Florida seemed well worth praying for, and fighting over. On
Sept. 20, 1565, the Spanish legate, Pedro Menendez de Aviles, fell
on Fort Caroline, overlooking the St. Johns River in modern
Jacksonville, and slaughtered a small colony of Protestant French
Huguenots.

as Gracia Real de Santa Teresa de Mose, by runaway slaves who
helped the Spanish and the Yamassee Indians fight the British.

   Fort Mose lasted until 1763, when Spain surrendered Florida to

Union forces, including two black regiments, the famed 54th
Massachusetts and the Eighth New York, met and were defeated here
by Confederates in a sunny pinewoods. Black wounded were clubbed to
death with pine knots by enraged Southern soldiers and white
survivors were shipped north to the newly built prison at
Andersonville, where many perished miserably. In 1995 Olustee was
grievously looted by nocturnal treasure-seekers with metal

   Across rolling hills north of Tallahassee grows a hidden forest
known as the Wade Tract, on 200 acres of private property _ a tiny
remnant of the estimated 60 million acres of ancient longleaf pines
that once flourished in the Southeastern U.S.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these trees are up to 500 years old, more than twice as
old as the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In winter the shade is faint, cast by millions of airy needles
far aloft, so that the sunlight searches out the whole landscape.
On early winter afternoons, everything can be brilliantly yet
gently illumined, from the topmost age-whorled boughs of pines
centuries old, to the tasseled ephemeral grasses and broom-sedges
of last month. In late summer and early autumn, blazing star asters
and goldenrod plumes twinkle in the wiregrass, lighting up a living
landscape from long, long ago.

   Guarding the northernmost point in Spain's New World empire, the
venerable 1672 Castillo de San Marcos' gaunt, gray coquina walls,
33 feet thick at the base, glower defiantly over the passage
between St. Augustine and Anastasia Island.
</P>
<P>
   The fort withstood two sieges, holding out for 50 days in 1702
and for 27 days in 1740. It has never fallen to an enemy in battle.
Its masonry, made of billions of ancient mollusk-shells, absorbed
cannonballs like big sponges. Fragile periwinkles proved stronger
than gunpowder and iron. Seminole chief Osceola was briefly held
prisoner here.
</P>
<P>
   Considered the best example of 17th-century Spanish military
architecture in the New World, the Castillo underwent a $4.3
million restoration in 1998. Its beautiful, mirrory moat, a
picturesque addition from the Roosevelt era, was, alas, drained
forever. The water was sapping and splitting the fort's
foundations.

   Rush hour traffic oozes like molasses along Interstate 95 at

had to be registered, there were only 296 vehicles. Today there are
more than 12 million, not counting seasonal tourist-mobiles,
puttering down 113,777 miles of highway, and 11,057 bridges, more
bridges than any other state.

   Cars have been named after places in Florida: The Chevrolet
Biscayne and Delray, the Studebaker Daytona. Cars have been used to
create artificial offshore reefs in the Gulf of Mexico. Florida
novelist Harry Crews wrote a book in 1972 about a man who ate a car
for a stunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``He felt the metal on his lips. He felt his tongue take it,
hold it. The taste of metal flooded his throat, his stomach. He
felt the taste run, touch his blood, and he almost swooned in the
pleasure of it ... `` Crews wrote.

   Cape Canaveral is where Florida interfaces with infinity, where
man leaped off earth and landed at last on the moon in 1969. Alan

left earth, or life, behind here in epics of exploration and
daring.

   Today at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor complex, the Firing

1968 Apollo 8 moon mission, during which astronaut Frank Borman and
his crewmates first orbited the moon on Christmas night.
</P>
<P>
   Florida's official state gem is the moonstone, a semi-precious
gem that is found nowhere in the peninsula, but which we have mined
in symbolic dreams. Armstrong tracked his last footprints in
Florida, before making his first on the moon. If there is the least
particle of earth-dust on the moon, it is almost certainly
Floridian.

   The Spanish introduced cattle, horses, dogs and pigs to Florida
in the 1500s, where they have flourished ever since (especially the
pigs: Feral hogs number half a million in the state and the runway
at Cape Canaveral has to be cleared of them before the space
shuttle can land there). Here at the 15,000-acre Adams Ranch in St.
Lucie County, cowboys Billy Adams (left) and Frank Lewis round up
Braford cattle (a cross between Brahmans and Herefords), as ranch
hands have done here since 1937.
</P>
<P>
   In 1948 there were 1.5 million cattle in Florida, and only 2.1
million people. Fuller Warren won the governorship promising to
keep cattle off the state highways. Today there are 1.9 million
cattle but nearly 15 million people. Disney World stands in large
part on a former ranch owned by Kissimmee cattleman Irlo Bronson.

   A Calusa Indian courtier pays homage to his king in this
life-sized tableau depicting royal protocol ca. 1000 AD, which is
being prepared at the Museum of Florida History in Gainesville. The
Calusa, a tribe of approximately 20,000 hunter-gatherers and
mound-builders, were the third-most numerous tribe in Florida,
after the Timucuans and Apalachees, by the early 16th century when
the first Spanish arrived. Aerial photographs have revealed
arrow-straight walls from a probable Calusa settlement near Fort
Center, north of Lake Okeechobee in Glades County. Wooden carvings
were found preserved in the mud of a nearby pond.
</P>
<P>
   Today the Calusa are all gone, but the name survives in the
Miami telephone directory under listings including Calusa Cleaners,
Calusa Adult Care, Calusa Hairstylists, Calusa Realty and Calusa
Crossings.
</P>
<P>
   The Calusa came up with Miami's name: They called the great Lake
Okeechobee ``Mayaimi,'' or ``Big Water.''

   Nicole Marino plays The Little Mermaid at Weeki Wachee, one of
Florida's 320 springs. The ``Spring of Live Mermaids'' tourist
attraction was the brainchild of ex-Navy frogman Newton Perry, who
trained young women to stay underwater for extended periods, taking
sips of air from rubber hoses while they swam and performed
graceful ballets before spectators in a submerged, glassed-in
theater. The first mermaid show was in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   Springs were Florida's first tourist attraction _ witness the
mythical Fountain of Youth, sought by the Spanish conquistadors. In
our own day the Creature from the Black Lagoon was filmed at
Wakulla Springs (along with several Tarzan movies) and The
Incredible Mister Limpet was made here at Weeki Wachee. The first
big theme park, Cypress Gardens, opened in Winter Haven in 1936.
Disney World bubbled up in the middle of Florida in 1971.

   Grapefruit tumble along a conveyor belt at Sunbrite Citrus Inc.
in Fort Pierce, bright symbols of Florida's citrus industry, which
produced 202 million boxes of oranges, 52 million boxes of
grapefruit and 10 million boxes of tangerines, tangelos and other
specialty fruit in 1996. Citrus originated in Asia, was brought to
the Mediterranean and introduced in Florida by the Spanish near St.
Augustine in 1570.
</P>
<P>
   Three hundred years later, retired Confederate Gen. Robert E.
Lee toured North Florida and was shown an exotic fruit near
Palatka. It was called grapefruit, because it grew in grape-like
clusters. Lee sampled it gingerly and praised it politely.
</P>
<P>
   Today Florida is the leading producer of grapefruit in the
world, and our orange crop is second only to Brazil's. Citrus
groves occupy nearly a million acres in Florida, and 30 of the
state's 67 counties.
</P>

   A small spray of unfrozen orange blossoms, sent by Miami matron
Julia Tuttle to railroad baron Henry Flagler after a disastrous

`WHY DON'T THE KIDS HAVE A VOICE?' :  SEEING CHILDREN SUFFER IN A
WELFARE MAZE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (Eds.: Production notes appear at end of review. Time and channel
are for New York area. Check local listings.) 
(DW) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tuesday night John Stossel, ABC's scourge of liberalism and all
its works, comes forward as a champion of children caught up in the
tangles of the social welfare establishment. In pursuit of the
question ``Why Don't the Kids Have a Voice?'' Stossel provides case
histories of children who are being deprived of wholesome homes by
benighted bureaucratic regulations, particularly one that favors
their biological parents, however unworthy.
</P>
<P>
   He begins with 11-year-old Timmy who was living happily with his
stepfather after the death of his mother when his biological father
appeared suddenly with a demand for the child. ``This is family,''
says Timmy as he is removed from his accustomed home. ``It's where
my mom wanted me to live, and this is where I want to live.'' But a
judge ordered him to go to his father.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Gill, a juvenile court judge, who calls himself a child
advocate is fighting to change the rules. He says: ``There is a
biological bias out there. The person who donates an egg and the
sperm owns the soul of the child. That's the way it works out. It's
ownership.''
</P>
<P>
   Stossel finds that foster parents are not the answer either.
It's hard to weigh the evidence here because of secrecy regulations
that are ostensibly aimed at protecting children but that critics
say really serve to protect social workers from scrutiny. As one of
Tuesday night's child advocates puts it, ``What goes on is
negligence, and the bureaucracies operate to protect their own
butts.'' He charges that 20 percent of foster parents do a
``downright rotten'' job of it.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to adoptive parents, the program is more
charitable. Here, as Stossel sees it, the problem is with
regulations that make adoption difficult for parents who are eager
to take on even children with handicaps.
</P>
<P>
   Stossel's interview with Harvey Kawasaki, who is in charge of
adoptions for Los Angeles County, where children routinely spend
years in foster care, will do nothing to improve the image of the
bureaucracy. ``Your critics say you're incompetent,'' Stossel
notifies him. The adoption chief, who seems to have very few
successful adoptions to his credit, says he enjoyed the interview.
</P>
<P>
   At the very end of this hour Stossel gets into the touchy
subject of race, which might have made for a rewarding report if he
had applied himself. Despite a law that prohibits consideration of
race in adoptions, he finds that social workers are still averse to
giving black children to white couples.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, as in much of the program, Stossel doesn't do
much digging into the whys and wherefores, and settles mainly for
the moving anecdote.

   Y2K-PUBLIC (Undated) _ With four days until the year 2000,
government officials, company managers and computer experts are
waiting anxiously to see if the public will remain calm. Not
everyone is sure that the computers and the machinery in which they
are often embedded will perform flawlessly as they roll past
midnight and encounter Year 2000. But the prevailing view is that
the technical glitches are likely to have limited economic and
social impact. Bigger disruptions could come, the experts say, from
unwarranted stockpiling and large withdrawals from banks. By

SEAT TO BUY BUFFETTI FOR $718 MILLION IN MOVE FOR ELECTRONIC SALES
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Seat Pagine Gialle SpA, the Italian publisher of yellow
pages that has expanded into online businesses, reached an
agreement Monday to buy Buffetti SpA, which operates a chain of
office supply stores, for 708.4 million euros ($718 million) in
cash and stock.
</P>
<P>
   Seat's move, if successful, would create a big European company
in the growing market for electronic sales, focusing not only on
individual retail purchasers but also on professionals, like
doctors and lawyers, and small and midsize companies, which abound
in Italy. It would be the latest step in the accelerating spread of
electronic commerce, as companies pick partners to gain products,
expertise and capital.
</P>
<P>
   Tiscali SpA, an Italian company that, like Seat, helped to
pioneer free Internet access in Continental Europe, said last week
it was spending $101 million to acquire control of two French
telecommunications companies: Nets SA, which operates a glass fiber
cable linking London and Paris, and A Telecom SA, a provider of
local phone service with potential Internet applications.
</P>
<P>
   Lorenzo Pellicioli, the chief executive of Seat, said Buffetti,
which has also been expanding online, ``complements Seat in
developing the Internet for professionals and small and midsize
companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Seat, based in Turin, in northern Italy, acquired Virgilio, one
of Italy's leading Internet search engines, earlier this year. Its
acquisition of Buffetti would be the next step in a strategy that
it expects would lead to online operations accounting for at least
10 percent of revenue by 2002. Through Virgilio, Seat now offers
links to companies selling products online and search tools for
phone numbers. Seat expects its online businesses to account for 40
billion lire ($20.9 million) this year, compared with 27 billion
lire ($14 million) in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Buffetti, based in Rome, has been pushing out of its traditional
over-the-counter sales and into online selling and has diversified
the products it offers. Buffetti sells books and software online,
and announced plans earlier this month to join an undisclosed
partner in the financial services industry to sell insurance and
banking products through its network of about 1,200 stores in
Italy. The alliance with Seat will enable Buffetti to sell products
online and give Seat access to Buffetti's ability to deliver
products without using the unreliable Italian postal system.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Seat rose 0.517 euro Monday, or 18 percent, to 3.43
euros. Buffetti rose 3.64 euros, or 26 percent, to 17.51 euros.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, shares in Internet companies have surged on the
Milan stock exchange as investors in Europe and abroad poured money
into companies operating in telecommunications and related
technology. Swept by this fever, shares of Seat rose more than 75
percent over the last month.
</P>
<P>
   In trading before Christmas, Seat was worth about 22 trillion
lire, or $11.5 billion, roughly 80 times its profits. Yet analysts
said its price could continue to rise. In a report earlier this
month, Lehman Brothers Securities raised its price target for Seat
to 3.05 euros, or $3.08, from 1.82 euros, and maintained an
outperform rating for the stock.
</P>
<P>
   Based on share prices on Thursday, the last trading day before
the bid was officially made, each package of 500 Buffetti shares,
the minimum amount the Milan stock exchange buys and sells, would
bring about 44 euros, or $44.57, in cash, and 2,735 shares in Seat.
That represents a premium of almost 16 percent to Buffetti's
closing share price.
</P>
<P>
   Though Internet use in Italy lags behind that in many other
European countries because of the low number of households with
computers and sparse familiarity with English, the Web's dominant
language, experts expect it to surge in coming months as the sale
and leasing of computers grows and Internet content in Italian
increases.
</P>
<P>
   Seat was advised by Salomon Smith Barney, while Buffetti was
advised by ING Barings.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As a teen-ager, Morshed Alam dodged enemy soldiers to
deliver food to Bangladeshi independence fighters. And as a student
at Dhaka University in the mid-1970s, he endured police beatings to
organize pro-democracy demonstrations against the newly formed
nation's military regime.
</P>
<P>
   So it is hardly surprising that Alam dove headlong into American
politics soon after immigrating to Queens 15 years ago. In 1996, he
became the first Bangladeshi on a community school board in New
York City. In 1998, he challenged an entrenched Republican state
senator. And when the county's Democratic organization opposed his
candidacy, he built his own insurgent political club.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politics is the same everywhere in the world,'' said Alam, who
lost the 1998 state Senate race but plans to run again next year.
``Nobody wants to give up their power. But times are changing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ambitious and impatient, sour on local Democrats but
enthusiastic about democracy, Alam is a prime example of a new
breed of immigrant politicians from Asia, the West Indies and Latin
America, who are beginning to take their places at the city's table
of power, just as Italian and East European Jewish immigrants did
90 years ago.
</P>

   Some, like Alam, are rebelling against established politicians.
Others are rebuilding dying political clubs. Still others are
entering politics the old-fashioned way by running for ground-floor
offices, like spots on school boards, competing in races that often
draw yawns from native-born politicians.
</P>
<P>
   They are scoring small but significant successes. Dominicans
control the Democratic clubs of Washington Heights. Asian-Americans
hold five elected judicial positions and 15 seats on nine different
school boards. And eight people of West Indian descent now serve on
the City Council or in the state Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   But new immigrants have yet to reach the higher rungs of the
city's political ladder. No Asian-Americans, West Indians or Latin
Americans in New York City are Democratic county leaders, members
of Congress or strong contenders for citywide office. Oddly enough,
the thing they are celebrated for, their extraordinary diversity,
has weakened their political strength.
</P>
<P>
   Today's immigrants come from more countries and speak more
languages than the last great wave of European immigrants. They are
more economically varied, with highly educated and skilled people
among their ranks. And more than their predecessors, they are
eschewing homogenous enclaves, scattering to neighborhoods across
the city.
</P>
<P>
   Fractured and dispersed, they have proved more difficult to
unite into political movements. In New York, no group approaches
the influence of Cuban immigrants in Miami, Mexican immigrants in
San Antonio or Asian-Americans in San Francisco, whose political
power has been amplified by their more concentrated numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There hasn't been a citywide candidate who can gel the
immigrants, partly because it is such a diverse community,'' said
John Mollenkopf, a professor of history at the City University of
New York.
</P>
<P>
   But the city's political landscape is changing in ways that
could catapult more immigrant politicians into office. In 2001,
term limits will force 36 of the 51 City Council members from
office. Presented with that historic opportunity, political
analysts predict, large numbers of immigrants will register voters
and build organizations, trying to rouse communities many veteran
politicians once felt safe to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   And the immigrants will be there for the rousing, a virtual tide
of new citizens eligible to vote and seek office. Since 1996,
record numbers of immigrants have applied for citizenship, spurred
by Congress' decision to end welfare benefits for certain
noncitizens and by the advent of dual citizenship in countries like
the Dominican Republic and Colombia, which send large numbers of
immigrants to America.
</P>
<P>
   Alam, a cheerful, rail-thin man of 42 who works as an
environmental chemist for the city, is hoping to ride that wave to
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he challenged state Senator Frank Padavan, a 13-term
Republican who had made an issue of the cost of social services for
immigrants. When the Queens Democratic Party refused to support
Alam, he recruited immigrant acquaintances into his own
organization, the New American Democratic Club. With a shoestring
budget and little campaign experience, they knocked on doors,
distributed literature and helped him win 41 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   A recent meeting of the club showed it to be as kaleidoscopic as
the city itself. Among the 35 people eating chicken tikka and
basmati rice at Alam's house in Jamaica were school board members
from Korea and Taiwan; an Indian dentist and Pakistani college
professor; Roman Catholics from Colombia and Muslims from Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Their accents were as varied as their faces. They wore business
suits, saris and flowing white robes. They came from countries that
are traditionally hostile to one another. But they could clearly
agree on one thing: it was time to have a voice, perhaps many
voices, in American politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to show them we belong,'' Elizabeth Aivars, a
Venezuelan immigrant, told the group. ``This is a political
organization. We're not embarrassed to say that. We are here to get
people elected.''

   On a November morning in 1914, hundreds of Jewish immigrants
gathered along East Broadway in the chill before dawn, singing,
dancing and hoping to catch a glimpse of their hero: Meyer London,
a Socialist Party leader who had just been elected to Congress from
the Lower East Side.
</P>
<P>
   To those immigrants, the election of London was a watershed. He
was one of them, a new American who had come from Russia as a
teen-ager, the son of a print shop owner, a lawyer for garment
workers. His election seemed to validate all their yearnings for
political influence and economic security.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, the city's Italian immigrant community elected
its first member of Congress, Fiorello H. La Guardia. (Actually, La
Guardia could claim heritage in both immigrant groups; his father
was Italian, his mother, Jewish. And in 1933, he was able to build
a coalition of Italian, Jewish, progressive, Republican and union
supporters to become mayor, the city's first Italian-American to do
so.)
</P>
<P>
   To political analysts today, there is an important lesson to be
gleaned from London's and La Guardia's first elections: they came
roughly three decades after the first waves of East European Jews
started arriving in New York City. And by that timetable, the
Asian, Latin American and West Indian immigrants who began flowing
into New York in the mid-1960s should not be that far behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the Russian Jewish time clock, 1999 is equivalent to
1915,'' said Philip Kasinitz, a Hunter College sociologist.
</P>
<P>
   The Italians and Jews became politicized at different rates.
Italians, like many Hispanic immigrants today, were relatively slow
to naturalize, in part because many did not intend to make America
their permanent home. Jews become citizens faster, in large part
because they had no intention of returning to Europe. They also
brought with them urban traditions of socialist politics and labor
organizing that caught on with immigrants in New York City's
working-class streets and sweatshops.
</P>
<P>
   And while the Democratic Party was slow to recruit these Jewish
and Italian immigrants, it eventually embraced them, and they it.
By the 1950s, the old Democratic machine was dominated by Italians,
particularly its last true boss, Carmine G. DeSapio. And Jews
became important forces not only in the mainstream organization,
but also in the reform clubs that produced Mayor Edward Koch.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, when strict immigration quotas were lifted, new
waves of immigrants from Asia, Latin America and the West Indies
began pouring into the city. And the very diversity of these
immigrants has become a major hurdle not confronted by the Jews and
Italians before them.
</P>
<P>
   In 1933, when Fiorello La Guardia was elected mayor, Italians
and Jews together represented about a third of New York's
population. Today, Dominicans, the city's largest immigrant group,
represent roughly 6 percent of the population; West Indians as a
group are about 8 percent. Chinese, the largest Asian group, are
less than 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Unifying them will be a politician's nightmare. In Jackson
Heights, Queens, for example, disagreements between Dominican and
Colombian leaders helped an incumbent assemblyman, Ivan C.
Lafayette, win re-election last year, though the district has a
Latino majority.
</P>
<P>
   The new immigrants face another challenge: the Democratic Party
has been on a steady downward trend. Reform politicians have
weakened the party's control over patronage, a fundamental
recruiting tool. The modern welfare state has made the clubs'
rudimentary social services seem redundant. Paid consultants have
taken over the work of running campaigns, reducing the need for
immigrant volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't even fix a parking ticket,'' said James McManus,
whose great-uncle founded the McManus Midtown Democratic
Association on West 44th Street more than 90 years ago. ``It's no
wonder people don't come around anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But for all the obstacles, the new immigrants have had their
triumphs. Just this decade, the Dominicans have come to dominate
politics in Washington Heights, one of the most concentrated
immigrant enclaves in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Dominicans virtually control the three local Democratic clubs
and the local school board. They have elected one of their own,
Guillermo Linares, to the City Council, and another, Adriano
Espaillat, to the State Assembly. And when Representative Charles
B. Rangel retires, many local party officials predict, the area is
very likely to elect the first Dominican to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   And in the Bronx, the last of the city's true political
machines, the county Democratic Committee, which is dominated by
Puerto Ricans, is trying to build citywide immigrant support behind
Borough President Fernando Ferrer, who is considering running for
mayor in 2001. He is a long shot, but his efforts may lay the
foundations for an immigrant candidate to seek citywide office in
the future. And perhaps, like La Guardia, that first successful
citywide candidate will have roots in more than one immigrant
group.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a group of people who are hungry, who are ready for
ownership of a city that has not always been kind to them,'' said
Assemblyman Roberto Ramirez, the county chairman.

<P>
   Who, many historians ask, will be first among the new immigrants
to represent a large group of people?
</P>
<P>
   One of the strongest candidates would seem to be a hard-charging
woman from the island of Jamaica: City Councilwoman Una Clarke of
Brooklyn, who is aggressively raising money and courting support
for a potential challenge to U.S. Rep. Major R. Owens, a nine-term
Democrat, next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are pushing me to run,'' she says of her fellow West
Indians, pretending she hasn't tried to stoke such talk. ``Their
plot is to push me so far that I cannot turn back.''
</P>
<P>
   In her drive for recognition, Mrs. Clarke, 64, clearly reflects
the desires of many of the city's 600,000 West Indians _
particularly in Flatbush and Crown Heights _ to see their growing
population translated into political power beyond the City Council
or Legislature. But by taking on Owens, who is African-American, a
Clarke campaign for Congress could also place her into conflict
with central Brooklyn's other major voter bloc.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, politicians from the West Indies _ including Rep.
Shirley Chisholm, an immigrant from Barbados who represented the
11th Congressional District in the 1970s _ generally viewed
themselves as African-American leaders first and Caribbeans second.
But for Mrs. Clarke, being from the West Indies seems to come
first.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Mrs. Clarke, who must leave the council in 2001 under
term limits, has built her career on issues related to the West
Indies.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In the council, her signal achievement was to legalize the
unlicensed vans that are owned mainly by immigrants from the West
Indies. Her office promotes the honors bestowed on her by
governments in the Caribbean and groups in her immigrant community.
And recently, she led a delegation of officials to Washington to
lobby for trade rules that would benefit West Indian banana
growers.
</P>
<P>
   She also aggressively courts immigrant voters, filling her
weekends with visits to West Indian festivals and interviews on
local radio shows. A service in Harlem commemorating the day of
Bahamian independence was typical. Midway through the event, the
nation's consul general, Dr. Doswell Coakley, spotted Mrs. Clarke
in the second row _ an easy task, given her bright red pillbox hat
_ and gave her a plug.
</P>
<P>
   ``Una Clarke is term-limited and moving on to other things,''
Dr. Coakley told the crowd as Mrs. Clarke covered her face with
red-gloved hands in mock horror. ``She tells me she is Caribbean
first, and that we keep her in the fore of our thoughts. We
shall.''

<P>
   Mrs. Clarke and her husband came to the United States in 1959 as
students, had two children and decided to stay. Politics seemed to
come naturally. She first got involved in PTAs, then helped form an
insurgent Democratic club that included Owens. Later she became
head of a community group called the Caribbean Action Lobby.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1991, after the city created a majority-West Indian
Council district in central Brooklyn, she defied the county's
black-dominated Democratic organization, which supported an
American-born black candidate, and won the seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never saw bias until I ran in 1991,'' Mrs. Clarke said
recently. ``When I entered office, the street talk was, `Why do
these West Indians feel they have to be in politics?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Now, her daughter, Yvette, 34, is considering running for her
council seat. More than the mother, the daughter moves seamlessly
between two worlds, understanding Jamaican lingo but speaking
unaccented English, listening to calypso as well as hip-hop. Mrs.
Clarke regards Yvette proudly, but also with a touch of envy.

   The gathering of the North Flushing Civic Association was much
like the dozens of civic association meetings held every month in
Queens. A group of 60 middle-class homeowners, upset about a
proposed Salvation Army church on 32nd Avenue, fired testy
questions about increased traffic and ruined vistas at church
officials.
</P>
<P>
   But there was something different about this event: the man
running it. He was John Liu, a 32-year-old immigrant from Taiwan,
the association's president and one of just four Asian-Americans in
the room that night. It is often that way for Liu, who is trying to
become the first Asian-American on the City Council.
</P>
<P>
   While immigrant candidates in heavily concentrated immigrant
communities like Washington Heights or Flatbush can afford to focus
on their fellow countrymen, Asian-Americans in Queens cannot. Not
only are Asian-Americans a minority in most Queens communities,
many do not vote. Even in Flushing, where Asian-Americans are
nearly half the population, they represent less than 20 percent of
the registered Democrats. The rest either are not citizens or have
registered as independents or Republicans, making them ineligible
for the Democratic primaries that usually determine elections in
New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Don Nakanishi, director of the Asian-American Studies Center at
the University of California at Los Angles, says that while
Asian-Americans are quick to naturalize, they are also slow to
register to vote. The reasons he gives include a strong emphasis on
work over other activities, a fear of politics bred from living in
authoritarian Asian societies and a lack of recruitment by American
political parties.
</P>
<P>
   Liu, an actuary, learned those lessons the hard way. In 1997, he
was one of two Asian-American Democrats who challenged City
Councilwoman Julia Harrison, a Democrat who had sharply criticized
Asian-American business owners in Flushing on a variety of issues,
including not posting signs in English. The two split the
Asian-American vote, making it easier for Mrs. Harrison to win
re-election with just 48 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   With Mrs. Harrison required to step down in 2001, Liu is working
much harder to gain support among non-Asians _ not an easy task
when many longtime residents bristle at the rapid growth of
Flushing's Asian-American population.
</P>
<P>
   So he fills his evenings and weekends with political events
where he can meet the borough's Democratic leaders and voters. In
addition to his civic association, he sits on the boards of the
Queens Symphony and a handful of Democratic clubs, including one
linked to the most powerful official in his council district,
Assemblyman Brian McLaughlin, whose support he hopes to win.
</P>
<P>
   Liu arrived in Flushing at the age of 5 when his father, a bank
executive, was transferred to New York. Then, the family was among
the neighborhood's only Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to speak Chinese,'' he recalled in his
unaccented English. ``I wanted to be white.''
</P>
<P>
   But at the State University of New York in Binghamton, he became
active in the campus Asian-American organization. Angry that the
group was receiving far less financing than other organizations, he
and friends campaigned to pack the student assembly with
Asian-Americans. They won, and the Asian Student Union got a
$10,000 budget increase.

   Five years ago, he and his wife, a nuclear engineer, bought an
80-year-old Colonial-style home just a few blocks from where he
grew up. Sometimes he recalls the racial slurs of his childhood as
he walks door to door, trying to drum up campaign support.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say to me: `I'm Italian. You are going to know what I
need?' '' he said. ``I say: `You need regular garbage pickup. You
need the schools to be good. And you know what? That's what I want,
too.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The McManus Midtown Democratic Association on West 44th Street
has the musty, other-era feel of someone's well-kept attic.
Outside, a red-haired man sells J.F.K. buttons. By the door hangs
an oversized drawing of George Washington Plunkitt, the salty
Hell's Kitchen district leader whose blunt advocacy of ``honest
graft'' was Tammany Hall's turn-of-the-century motto. Old men sit
watching television.
</P>
<P>
   But on a recent evening, there was a distinctly new New York
feel to the club's clientele. A family of Mexicans sat on folding
chairs inside the door, awaiting help with a housing matter. A few
paces away, a club member filled out immigration forms for a
Colombian woman. And in the back, a Brazilian man leafed through a
sheaf of job openings at city agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Manzano, the club president, looked on happily. ``I did
my homework,'' he said, referring to the job listings he had
compiled.
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, Manzano, 33, who builds and manages Web pages for
a living, is something of a political throwback, the last of a
dying breed. But in another, he may be the model for something new:
immigrants trying to revive the city's political clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Manzano, who immigrated from Colombia in 1985, joined the club
11 years ago as a student at Queens College, simply because he
wanted to learn about American-style politics. He was the club's
second Hispanic member. But over the next few years, he recruited
other immigrants, largely by providing basic services: citizenship
classes, free legal services and assistance in navigating city
bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   It was not quite like the old days, when clubs could put a
supporter's nephew on the city payroll or get a friendly judge to
go easy on a particular case. But the club's Hispanic membership
grew steadily to 600, about half of its total.
</P>
<P>
   ``The needs of immigrants today are no different than in the
past,'' Manzano said. ``We just can't help them like we used to.''
</P>
<P>
   This Latinization drew grumbles from some of the older Irish and
Italian stalwarts. But the effort had the blessing of McManus, who
had installed Manzano as president and helped elect him a district
leader. To him, Manzano represents not just the future of his club,
but of New York City politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody gave the Irish and Italians anything,'' McManus said.
``We took it. We elected mayors, and then made them hire our
people. So I've been waiting for someone like Carlos to come along
and do the same thing for poor and working-class Hispanics.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, Manzano, whose ever-crisp attire and
dignified bearing seem as old-fashioned as his politics, ran last
February for City Council in a heavily white district that extends
from West 74th Street along the Hudson River into Greenwich
Village. Derided as ``the machine candidate'' by his opponents, he
finished second in a field of four.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he has received feelers from other Hispanic leaders
about running as the pan-Hispanic candidate for the Council from
Jackson Heights, Queens. He is leaning against the idea.
</P>
<P>
   More appealing to him is spending nights at the club. As he
prepared to close down at 10:30 on a recent evening, a frail
looking, elderly woman walked in and asked for a private meeting.
Her red hair was tucked under a blue cap and she was toting a
heavily stuffed white Value Drug bag.
</P>
<P>
   As they emerged from their talk a few minutes later, the woman
began to toddle off, then stopped and gave Manzano a kiss on the
cheek.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will take care of that, right?'' she asked. ``Cause if you
don't, who will?''

NASDAQ REACHES ANOTHER HIGH AFTER PROFIT-TAKINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Nasdaq composite index sustained a
much-anticipated round of profit-taking on Monday, but later rose
to its eighth consecutive record high, pulled up by big jumps in
Internet favorites like Qualcomm, JDS Uniphase and Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq index, which has risen more than 45 percent since
October, started the day on a strong note as it raced through 4,000
for the second consecutive trading session.
</P>
<P>
   But the gains stalled shortly thereafter, and then the index
began to lose ground. At one point, the Nasdaq was down as much as
67 points.
</P>
<P>
   But buyers reappeared during the afternoon, and by the close the
index had gained 5.94 points, or 0.15 percent, to 3,975.38.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority opinion has been that high-tech and Internet
stocks would go up until Jan. 3, when people would take profits,''
said Al Goldman, chief market analyst at A.G. Edwards Inc. in St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever the majority thinks almost never happens, because we
had profit taking today, and probably will again on Tuesday.''
</P>
<P>
   With the end of the year approaching, time is running out for
those wishing to take profits in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people had to do some selling, they did it this morning,''
said Robert E. Turner, chairman and chief investment officer of
Turner Investment Partners in Berwyn, Pa. ``It was a disappointment
when the Nasdaq pierced 4,000 and then couldn't hold that level.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as the Nadsaq was rallying, the Dow Jones industrial
average, up for most of the day, fell victim to selling, in part
because of weakness in Philip Morris.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco giant slumped after an unfavorable ruling from a
Florida court that could force the tobacco industry to pay lump-sum
damages in a class action suit. Philip Morris and other tobacco
companies had been seeking to resolve the claims on an individual
basis.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 14.68 points, or
0.13 percent, to 11,391.08. And the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock
index also inched lower, dropping 1.24 points, or 0.14 percent, to
1457.10. But the Russell 2,000 index of small company stocks rose
2.03 points, or 0.42 percent, to 484.46.
</P>
<P>
   Monday was the first trading session since Thursday. Analysts
have been expecting liquidity to drain out of the market as the end
of the year approaches, and trading activity was a bit more subdued
than the huge amounts of stock that have been exchanged each day
during December.
</P>
<P>
   Still, volume was fairly impressive: On the New York Stock
Exchange some 717 million shares changed hands. Volume on the
Nasdaq stock market was 1.15 billion shares, the ``slowest'' day
since Nov. 26, the day after Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said it was likely to remain fairly busy for the balance
of the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will still be a lot of jockeying in positions, and there
are huge tax strategies going on,'' said Michael Clark, head of
U.S. stock trading at Credit Suisse First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see it getting real quiet between now and year-end,''
Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   Qualcomm, a component of both the Nasdaq and the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500, was one of the day's best performers. The stock, which
is scheduled to split 4 for 1 on New Year's Eve, rose 45 15/16, to
513 7/16. Including Monday's gain, the stock is up more than 1,800
percent so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   JDS Uniphase, a manufacturer of fiber optic components and
modules, was another big winner. The stock jumped 37 3/16, to 335
1/4.
</P>
<P>
   And Yahoo, which was down early in the day, rallied later and
closed at 415, up 12 3/8.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a good day for Internet retailers, which slumped on
concerns that difficulties filling holiday orders will not sit well
with consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com fell 8 7/8, to 81 1/8. EToys fell 5, to 25 15/16. And
eBay slumped 8 5/16, to 134.
</P>
<P>
   Among Dow stocks, Philip Morris dropped 1 7/16, to 22, after the
Florida court ruling. Hewlett-Packard shed 4 1/8, to 108 1/2. And
Exxon-Mobil dropped 2 9/16, to 81 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   On the positive side of the ledger, General Electric gained 2,
to 159 1/2. And Johnson &AMP; Johnson rose 2 3/16, to 97 3/4.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone-related stocks did not do well. AT&AMP;T, which last
Thursday asked the Federal Communications Commission to review Bell
Atlantic's offering of long-distance service in New York, was off
2, to 50 5/8. Bell Atlantic dropped 3 7/16, to 60 1/2. And SBC
Communications dropped 1 7/8, to 48 15/16.

   WASHINGTON _ In the final seconds of the century, the Washington
Monument will turn into a giant sparkler, with most of the 555-foot
obelisk ablaze with pyrotechnic diamonds at the stroke of midnight.
``And please don't call them fireworks!'' one of the show's
organizers said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   More about definitions in a moment. Not everyone has been
enthusiastic about lighting up the monument. Rep. Ralph Regula,
R-Ohio, wrote President Clinton last week of his ``grave concerns''
that it might be damaged physically and desecrated spiritually.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Washington Monument is one of the most important symbols
of the nation's capital, a monument to the father of our country,
and a symbol of our patriotism and democracy,'' Regula wrote,
urging the president to change the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   As chairman of the House Appropriations Committee's subcommittee
on the Interior, Regula has some influence. He also has history on
his side. While many rallies and protests have been held at the
monument in its 114-history, nothing has been hung from the
monument itself. Federal law prohibits it.
</P>
<P>
   But this Dec. 31 is not just any New Year's Eve, and the Clinton
administration wanted a celebration worthy of a new millennium. So
the word went forth from the White House to the Interior Department
and the National Park Service: Let there be light.
</P>
<P>
   By a wonderful coincidence, the monument has been surrounded by
scaffolding for many months for the landmark's first major
renovation and cleaning since the 1930s. So the pyrotechnics will
not have to be draped on the obelisk itself but can hang from the
scaffolding's outer edges, more than nine feet from the stone.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Park Service was worried not only about precedent but
about powder burns. ``There was concern about putting fireworks up
there,'' Dave Barna, the Park Service's chief spokesman, said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not fireworks,'' M. Philip Butler of Fireworks by
Grucci said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The light show at the monument will come from special
pyrotechnic effects, said Butler, the company's chief
pyrotechnician. ``When it's lit, it doesn't fire; it drips,'' he
said. He said the distinction is crucial: With true ``fireworks''
explosive projectiles are fired out of tubes, but with the special
effects to be used at the monument there is minimal burnt-powder
residue.
</P>
<P>
   The Interior Department has written Regula in an attempt to ease
his concerns, a department spokesman said Monday. A spokeswoman for
the congressman said she had not talked to him over the holidays
and so did not know his reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Butler said the technique to be used at the Washington Monument
has been employed at Lincoln Center in New York and on the roof of
the Smithsonian Institution in Washington without harm.

COMMENTARY: A NEW NEW YEAR AGENDA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ohio) (Eds: Bold-faced type should be set in italics.) (DW) 
 By GAIL COLLINS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This week it's hard to avoid thinking about the
future, particularly if you work half a block from Times Square,
soon to be the scene of the very biggest and best New Year's
celebration that our local holiday planners and anti-terrorism
squads can provide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect most people aren't going to be paying much attention
to politics during Christmas and before the millennium,'' said
George W. Bush earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   This was probably more of a prayer than a prediction. I have
been loath to make any sweeping judgments about how the average
voter views Bush's campaign performance thus far, since living in
Manhattan provides approximately as much insight on the attitudes
of typical Republicans as living in Pyongyang. However, I spent the
last week doing research in Ohio, employing the deeply scientific
method of interviewing every Republican who happened to walk into
my parents' living room, along with a very nice manicurist at the
local mall. I can now say with total confidence that an
overwhelming majority of Republican Party members in this country
are worried that Bush is, if not genuinely dim, at least a little
too shallow to be president.
</P>
<P>
   But we are talking today about the future:
</P>
<P>
   Campaign themes that deserve to be retired in the next
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Listening to the people. &LR;  Call me old-fashioned, but I always
hoped that a candidate for high office would have done the
listening before he or she decided to run.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Setting standards. &LR;  In the better and wiser world of the 21st
century, elected officials will not get credit for demanding higher
fourth-grade reading achievement until the fourth graders actually
learn to read.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Using the bully pulpit. &LR;  This venerable term, coined by
Theodore Roosevelt to describe a president's power of moral
leadership, is currently employed mainly by candidates who want to
get credit for things they don't intend to pay for; e.g.,
``Education is a state responsibility, but I intend to use the
bully pulpit to encourage smaller class size.''
</P>
<P>
   While we are at it, let's bar all Republican candidates who
espouse strict limitations on the federal government's role in
domestic policy from saying Theodore Roosevelt is their favorite
president.
</P>
<P>
   Brand-new political phenomena we would like to see nipped in the
bud.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Corn Man. &LR;  The following is a genuine press release from
the Al Gore campaign: ``Today Iowans for Gore released the
statements of Corn Man, the 6-foot-tall piece of corn who's
stalking Bill Bradley ... who is expected to continue his
reluctance to talk ag issues by avoiding tonight's agricultural
debate at Iowa State University.''
</P>
<P>
   We should also make it illegal for any candidate whose opponent
shows up for three debates a month to complain about said
candidate's  &UR; failure to come to debates. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Blowing kisses to one's spouse &LR;  at the start of a public
appearance. This is a Gore tactic, but repeated exposures to George
W. Bush suggest we might also make it illegal for a candidate to
begin every single speech by saying that getting married to Laura
was the best decision of his whole life.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The voters' hunger for authenticity. &LR;  This is the media's work,
a desperate attempt on our part to explain why voters who otherwise
appear to be in their right minds say they could support either
John McCain or Bill Bradley, two candidates who have absolutely
nothing in common except campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible that people are now so obsessed with campaign
finance reform that they no longer care what the next president
thinks about abortion, gun control, health care, Social Security or
what to do with that little boy from Cuba as long as he bans
soft-money contributions. Or they might indeed yearn solely for a
leader who is in touch with his inner self. But I suspect they've
decided to ignore any election until the year it's scheduled to
occur.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, they have no idea yet what McCain or Bradley think
about anything. When they say they like them both, it may simply be
their way of telling us that they have picked up enough information
about Al Gore and George W. Bush to know that they would rather not
go there.
</P>
<P>
   Personal New Year's resolutions for the next millennium:
</P>
<P>
   Stop writing about the 2000 presidential campaign in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Stop making sweeping conclusions after interviewing a Cincinnati
manicurist.

N.H. PLANNING TO MAKE SOME HIKERS FOOT THE BILL FOR RESCUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN BARRY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After 30 years venturing into vicious cold, over icy rock, to
save the lives of hikers, it occurred to Joe Lentini for the first
time last year that they might not be worth the effort.
</P>
<P>
   During the years he spent in New Hampshire's White Mountains,
Lentini had noticed a gradual increase in the number of hikers who
set out unprepared. But, like other rescue workers, he says cell
phones have given hikers an ugly arrogance.
</P>
<P>
   Once, in white-out conditions, he urged a hiker to turn around
and head back and the man almost hit him. Lentini, director of
Eastern Mountain Sports' climbing school, took two months off to
think about quitting.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``I had a good friend of mine killed in a rescue and I'm
risking my life,'' he said. ``Now part of the time I was risking my
life for people who just were ignorant.''
</P>
<P>
   Later this week New Hampshire's Fish and Game Department will
announce new regulations that will establish what White Mountain
volunteers have felt in their gut for years: that a significant
minority of hikers are so careless they don't deserve to be rescued
for free.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the Manchester (N.H.) Union-Leader, Fish
and Game Col. Ron Alie said hikers deemed reckless will be billed
for rescue missions, whose costs can mount quickly. A rescue last
year of a Canadian man who ran out of food near Mount Eisenhower
cost Fish and Game $3,000, not counting the $1,400-an-hour bill for
the National Guard helicopter used to find him, Alie said.
</P>
<P>
   Alie would not comment further on the plan Monday. The
department will release more details at a news conference on
reducing the overall number of rescue missions.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement could stake out radical territory for New
Hampshire in a debate that has been heating up nationwide for 10
years. On one side are purists like Tim Kovacs of the
Colorado-based Mountain Rescue Association, who says it's the job
of rescue workers to save lives, not judge people in distress. On
the other side is a growing sense that Americans have stopped
taking the wilderness seriously. And anger is mounting among the
volunteer searchers who work in treacherous conditions for nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them are really bloody foolish people that are
ill-prepared and inappropriately dressed and not emotionally ready
or experienced, carrying a damn cell phone, and I think they
wouldn't have been there without a cell phone,'' said Bill Aughton,
a 40-year veteran of White Mountain search operations and the
director of the N.H. Outdoor Council. ``When someone calls and
says, `Hey, I'm stuck on the side of Mount Washington,' and they're
not prepared to do anything except call for help, I personally
would rather leave them to die.''
</P>
<P>
   Rescuers have grown more angry since cell phones have given
hikers the ability to call for help from anywhere. Already this
fall at least three groups of hikers have called for help and been
rescued in the White Mountains. But rescue workers also tell of a
proliferating number of unjustified rescue missions. Kovacs, of the
Mountain Rescue Association, recalled a distress call two years ago
from a man who had run out of cigarettes. And New Hampshire rescue
workers were angered two weeks ago when two New Jersey men got
caught at night on Mount Washington in blizzard conditions, Aughton
said.
</P>
<P>
   When rescue workers told them they would not send searchers up
the mountain until morning, the men called their wives in New
Jersey and ``said the police won't get us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, New Hampshire has had a law allowing the state to levy
fines for reckless endangerment, but veteran rescuers can only
recall one hiker who was fined _ a hiker who was found on Mount
Moriah, ``lying in the snow with an empty liter and a half of
vodka,'' Lentini said. The hiker was fined $500.
</P>
<P>
   Debates over rescue costs erupt regularly after major search
operations, which rely on massive contributions of time and
equipment by volunteers. In many western states, where rescue
operations can bankrupt whole counties, sheriffs and the forest
service have the right to charge for the cost, said John Moss, a
Colorado attorney who specializes in outdoor recreation law. But
even where laws allow local officials to charge the subject of a
search, they are rarely enforced, Moss said.
</P>
<P>
   And although Moss himself left search and rescue because he was
so tired of ``seeing stupid people do stupid things,'' he said he
opposes the threat of charges, which could prevent a hiker from
calling rescue workers in a crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic tenet of search and rescue is that you save the
life. The theory is, if the person has to make a decision to call,
he won't call,'' he said. ``You'd much rather do 10 stupid rescues
than miss one.''

COMMENTARY: MILITARY BASES MAKE ANOTHER MODEL FOR SCHOOLS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ANTHONY LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Schools on military bases, run by the Department of
Defense, have a better record than most public schools in this
country. Student test scores are high. Black and Hispanic children
far outperform those elsewhere. Children from poorer families do
almost as well as the better-off.
</P>
<P>
   I learned about the base schools in an article by Daniel Golden
in The Wall Street Journal last week. It was an eye-opening piece,
reporting remarkable facts about a little-known institution and
leaving us with important questions about what makes those schools
work and how our society can learn from their success.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has 71 schools for children of service members at
bases in this country, and 153 overseas. In the last six years,
pupils have taken 13 National Assessment of Educational Progress
tests; in 12 their results were above the national mean. More than
80 percent of the graduates go on to college, compared with the
national figure of 67 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 34,000 students in the domestic base schools, more than
half qualify for free or reduced-price lunches because of low
family income. They did almost as well as other students in
demonstrating writing proficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Forty percent of the domestic students are black or Hispanic. On
writing proficiency, 26 percent of the black children scored at or
above passing level compared with 7 percent nationally; 32 percent
of the Hispanics did, compared with 10 percent nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Golden's story quoted Roy Truby, executive director of the board
that administers the National Assessment tests, on those results:
``This debunks the notion that demography is destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   How is it done? The article mentioned a number of distinctive
factors.
</P>
<P>
   One is money. The domestic schools spend $7,279 per pupil, 23
percent more than public schools do on average. Among other things,
the money goes for art and music classes _ which have been trimmed
in many public schools as marginal extras but which I think are a
vital part of the learning atmosphere. Some goes for technology:
more computers for the students.
</P>
<P>
   Parent involvement is a second factor. The military gives
parents of children in base schools an hour off a week or a
half-day a month to volunteer in the schools, and many do.
</P>
<P>
   A third is discipline. If a student misbehaves and moderate
measures do not work, a parent will be called in for a conference.
If he or she does not show up, the school may get in touch with his
or her commanding officer. Enough said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the practices that help account for the good showing of
the base schools could readily be duplicated in ordinary public
schools. If a community is able to spend more on its schools _ and,
crucially, has the political will to do so _ students may benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Other elements are peculiar to the military. We would not want a
school principal to telephone a private employer of a parent who
has not come in for a conference about a misbehaving child.
</P>
<P>
   Underneath the particular reasons for the performance of the
base schools there are, surely, larger social factors. For one,
military families may have modest housing, but they are not likely
to live in the desperate ghettos that exist in our inner cities. To
put it mildly, it is harder for a child to learn when she lives
amid decay and danger.
</P>
<P>
   The gap between high and low incomes is less stark among
military personnel, and less distorting, than in our civilian
society today. The difference between rich and poor school
districts is a major problem for public schools in many states.
There are one-parent families in the military, but probably not so
many as in civilian America.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, I think there is a deeper sense of community among
military families. The free market and the race to get ahead have
given us, along with their economic benefits, an atomized society.
We do not care for each other as we believe, perhaps romantically,
Americans once did.
</P>
<P>
   We do not want to be militarized as a nation. But we have to
recognize that the military is one of our most successful
institutions: profoundly effective in achieving racial integration
in the services and now, we find, in educating its children. We
should be able to learn from its successes.

ONCE CONSIDERED UNSTOPPABLE, GORE SEEKS TO STAVE OFF BRADLEY
CHALLENGE
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was all so simple for Al Gore back in the days
when he expected an effortless coast to the Democratic presidential
nomination. He had the money, the endorsements and a careerist
staff comfortable in the corridors of power.
</P>
<P>
   Potential rivals concluded it would be foolish to challenge him.
And his airy campaign slogan of ``practical idealism'' encapsulated
just what Gore wanted the world to know about him: he was pragmatic
yet optimistic, visionary even.
</P>
<P>
   But his glide to the nomination hit a brick wall _ in the person
of Bill Bradley _ and the common assumptions about Gore's
once-inevitable candidacy have shattered. It is hard now to think
of a candidate who has undergone more transformations in a shorter
period than Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Now Gore faces perhaps the most critical weeks of his political
career, a hectic two-and-a-half-month campaign sprint through Iowa,
New Hampshire, New York, California and the Deep South that will
most likely determine whether his frantic self-makeover and the
doubts he has tried to raise about Bradley have worked, or whether
he will be denied what he once viewed as his rightful
``promotion.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore strategists believe that the vice president, who already
has a lock on hundreds of the so-called superdelegates to the
Democratic National Convention and is ahead in the national polls,
can win the nomination under several scenarios. But they say
Bradley can win under only one _ by winning the Iowa caucuses on
Jan. 24 and the New Hampshire primary a week later. Without those
states, especially New Hampshire, whose voters tend to favor
insurgents, Bradley would be hard pressed to convince the rest of
the country that he is a winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they do not stop us there, we will not be stopped,'' said a
top Gore strategist. ``They understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore is leading Bradley in Iowa polls by 20 percentage points
and claims a strong organization there. But with Bradley pouring
everything into Iowa next month, including more than $800,000 for
television and radio commercials and a full schedule of daily
appearances, the Gore campaign says it will need to match him
dollar for dollar to make sure the lead does not slip away.
</P>
<P>
   Gore advisers do not yet know how much time Gore will spend in
Iowa because he also needs to campaign in New Hampshire, where the
most recent poll showed him behind Bradley by 12 points. Their hope
is that if Bradley fails in Iowa the loss may prompt some
supporters to cross party lines and vote for Sen. John McCain, a
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Darrell West, a political scientist at Brown University, said
the stakes were higher for Bradley than for Gore in New Hampshire.
``Bradley really does have to win it because New England should be
a very good place for him,'' West said. ``It has a tradition of
independence, and the Northeast is the most liberal region in
national politics.''
</P>
<P>
   But this is unusual, and in most states, Gore is leading Bradley
by healthy margins.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the early months of the 2000 presidential campaign have
been rife with frustration for Gore and his aides. Even though he
moved his campaign out of Washington and into Nashville, pared the
staff and the salaries of those who remained and shed the
cumbersome entourage that once followed him on campaign trips, Gore
still seems to be trying to shake the image of a stiff Washington
insider.
</P>
<P>
   Even more galling to the Gore staff is that the man he is
campaigning against spent 18 years in the Senate, is bankrolled by
Wall Street and has still managed to cast himself as the
nonestablishment, noncalculating nonpolitician.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Hart, a pollster not affiliated with any campaign, said
his most recent surveys showed that 38 percent of voters nationally
have a positive view of Gore while 35 percent have a negative view.
By contrast, he said, Bradley had a positive rating of 42 percent
and a negative rating of 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore has a lot of work to do to warm up the electorate,''
Hart said. ``He is perceived as a politician, who comes across more
with a rotelike performance than a human performance, and while
that may have changed over the last month and a half, I'm not sure
the electorate has seen that.''
</P>
<P>
   These numbers, combined with the simultaneous Bradley surge and
Gore's disappointing poll results in a hypothetical race against
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, sent Gore into a tumult of
reinvention at the end of September and spawned a painfully public
makeover. The competition jolted him out of his blue suit, out of
his predictable stump speech and out of the arms of Bill Clinton.
The remodeling was so extensive that it raised questions of his
essential self and whether he was a ``beta'' male who could morph
into an ``alpha'' male.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the continual recalibrating and focus on the
performance aspects of politics began to overshadow what his
supporters saw as his strongest assets: his experience and command
of the issues.
</P>
<P>
   That point seemed to be at the heart of the heated exchange
between Gore and Bradley in their Dec. 19 debate on the NBC news
program, ``Meet the Press.'' Hoping to unmask Bradley as a
conventional politician who could not survive without high-priced
television ads and a hefty bankroll to pay for them, Gore proposed
that both he and Bradley drop all 30-second commercials and instead
hold twice-a-week debates.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley spurned the offer, as some in the Gore camp expected he
would, and ridiculed it as a gimmick. ``The point is, Al,'' he said
derisively, ``and I don't know if you get this, but a political
campaign is not just a performance for people, which is what this
is, but it is, rather, a dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   For Gore, the offer was about more than performance, or even
saving money on commercials. He wanted to show himself as the true
``reformer'' and paint Bradley as beholden to the status quo.
Despite the negative press reviews of the calculated theatrics,
Gore advisers said they were pleased with the gesture because the
public did not like 30-second commercials, even if it got most of
its information from them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are sick of these old advertisements and the
old approach to campaigning,'' Gore said a few days after the
debate. He dismissed campaign commercials as ``filled with fuzzy
images and little, short slogans'' and cast Bradley as cautious and
timid, precisely the words often used to describe Gore.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Gans, director of the nonpartisan Committee for the Study
of the American Electorate, said that the Gore campaign was
determined to portray Bradley as just another politician. ``What
Gore was trying to establish in that debate was that Bradley
couldn't run above it all,'' Gans said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not Gore succeeded, many analysts say that his
aggressive approach has thrown Bradley off his game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore has stemmed the bloodletting,'' West said. ``He's been a
better candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has also sought to draw Bradley into an argument over
policy details _ and away from the former basketball star's big
themes and compelling personal story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bradley was saying to people, `Here's who I am,''' Hart said.
``People aren't going to pick a president on the basis of that. At
this point, I don't know that Bradley has the message that
overrides the constituency groups that Gore has put together. Gore
has the backbone of the Democratic Party _ women, labor,
minorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore helped solidify that base, at least in the primary
campaign, with his sharp attacks on Bradley's proposals. In
particular, he has warned relentlessly that Bradley's health care
proposal would ``shred the social safety net,'' because it would
eliminate Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore's relentless attacks on Bradley have so far failed
to turn the tide in New Hampshire, Gore still has plenty of cause
for optimism. After New Hampshire, attention turns to the March 7
primaries in New York, Ohio, California and a dozen other states.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley could receive a tremendous lift by winning in New York,
perhaps his best state after New Hampshire, but polls in California
show the vice president strongly ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, if Gore, who is from Tennessee, does well on March 7,
the calendar will turn in his favor as the voting heads South.
Tennessee, Texas, Florida and other Southern states vote on March
14, followed by several states in the industrial Midwest, which
leans toward Gore.
</P>
<P>
   And beyond that, Gore has the underlying advantage of official
party support and the endorsement of organized labor and the
teachers' unions. He has already locked up endorsements from more
than 520 of the 799 superdelegates to the convention. These are the
governors, senators, members of Congress and other party worthies
who are automatically delegates. Bradley has endorsements from
about 20 superdelegates.
</P>
<P>
   The first to claim 2,169 delegates wins the nomination; without
a single vote yet cast, Gore is nearly a quarter of the way there.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Carrick, a Democratic strategist based in California and
not affiliated with either campaign, put it this way: ``Bradley
almost has to get a nuclear blast out of Iowa and New Hampshire to
carry him out of March 7 and March 14.''
</P>
<P>
   After Iowa and New Hampshire, he said, ``you begin to play to
the vice president's strength, which is broad support across many
demographic groups. Even in New York the numbers are moving for
Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   But other challenges remain. In voter surveys, Gore ranks poorly
in the category of leadership. On money, he has two problems. He is
vulnerable to charges he was overzealousness in fund-raising at a
Buddhist temple in 1996, and vulnerable to concerns that he might
not have enough to campaign effectively against Bush through the
spring and summer.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, if Gore wins the nomination, he may be in the
position of convincing moderate swing voters that he is not as
liberal as he may have seemed in his primary fight with Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bradley has forced Gore to the left on a wide range of issues,
from education to health care to gay rights,'' West said. On
education, he has promised to increase federal spending to $115
billion over 10 years. He is now framing his health-care plan as
one that would lead to universal coverage, as Bradley proposes, and
he has followed Bradley in his public support for allowing gays in
the military.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps no challenge is stickier than the question of what
to do about Clinton. Gore seems caught in a revolving door of
walking out on his mentor and then walking back in. Clinton is a
strong force in mobilizing black voters for Gore. But he is also a
drag on Gore with other voters, especially the independents and
Republicans whom Gore would need in a general election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore's biggest problem is that he represents the equivalent
of a Clinton third term,'' said Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the
Bush campaign. ``And no one is of a mind to give Bill Clinton a
third term.''

BP AMOCO WITHDRAWING FROM NATURAL GAS FIELDS IN UKRAINE
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By TOM WARNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIEV, Ukraine _ BP Amoco has decided not to develop a series of
natural gas fields in Ukraine, dealing a blow to the country's
hopes of decreasing its dependence on Russian gas.
</P>
<P>
   But the decision opens the way for other companies to explore a
vast region in central and eastern Ukraine with potentially huge
deposits. An official of BP Amoco, the British-American oil and gas
giant, confirmed earlier this month that the company had informed
the Ukrainian government of its decision.
</P>
<P>
   But even if a number of investors were to express interest, they
would be unlikely to match the speed of development or the highly
advanced drilling technology that BP Amoco could have brought to
bear.
</P>
<P>
   BP's decision startled some people in the industry. ``I'm
surprised to hear they're pulling out,'' said Konstantin Skorik, a
gas industry specialist at the World Bank's office in Kiev. ``The
last time I talked to them, they said there was plenty of gas and
they were just waiting on legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Bown, the head of BP Amoco's representative office in Kiev,
said his company's research did not confirm that there was enough
gas in central and eastern Ukraine to be profitably exploited. A
company statement said the region's potential did not equal
opportunities in Trinidad and Tobago, Egypt, Indonesia and in the
Caspian Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Bown said that in many respects, prospects for businesses in
Ukraine had been improving. A few months ago, the former Soviet
republic adopted a law on production-sharing that BP Amoco had been
promoting for years, and Ukraine is now forming what is expected to
be a more investor-friendly government. ``All these positive
changes going on only add to our sense of disappointment,'' Bown
said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that when British Petroleum began the study in 1996, it
had huge reserves of oil but its gas reserves were thin. Since
then, BP has merged with Amoco and has been trying to acquire ARCO,
increasing its gas supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bown declined to put any figures on the scale of the
untapped reserves in central and eastern Ukraine, a government
official said he and others had been told that BP Amoco could reach
production of 50 billion cubic meters a year by 2007.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe that any other company or companies will get
more than 30 or 35 billion cubic meters a year out of those
fields,'' said Mykola Yevdoshchuk, deputy chief of Ukraine's State
Geology Committee. ``BP really has the best technology for deep
drilling and for drilling in difficult terrain.''
</P>
<P>
   Ukraine now imports between 56 billion and 60 billion cubic
meters a year from Russia, and the republic's habit of getting
behind in its payments is a constant source of friction between
them. The Ukrainian president, Leonid Kuchma, warned last week that
disputes over gas payments were building toward a broader
``economic war.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   BP Amoco's withdrawal from Ukraine could nonetheless be a
windfall for many smaller gas-production companies, which stand to
benefit from the company's extensive research. Even while walking
away from the project, BP said it believed that deposits in the
area could prove lucrative for companies interested in
smaller-scale investments. When purchasing geological data from the
State Geology Committee, BP obligated itself either to invest in
the region or to produce a report outlining potential finds,
according to Western standards. The report is expected to be issued
by February.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Cormick, president of Epic Energy, a Canadian company
involved in a handful of small oil-production projects in Crimea,
said, ``We see this as basically a generous gift from BP to the
smaller companies like ourselves that are already here and
working.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies like Epic also hope the report will help clarify just
how much gas remains underground in central and eastern Ukraine.
The basin around the Dnieper and Donets rivers was the Soviet
Union's primary source of gas until the 1970s. It has produced
almost 1,700 billion cubic meters of natural gas since the first
drilling in 1936 and around 60 billion cubic meters a year at its
peak in the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, however, the Ukrainian gas became harder to exploit,
and new Siberian fields proved so rich that the Soviets practically
halted investment in Ukraine. Gas production in the Dnieper-Donets
basin has since fallen to 14 billion cubic meters a year.
</P>
<P>
   BP Amoco has concluded that the amount of recoverable gas in the
area at this point has fallen below its minimum standard for
investment, which others close to the project said was about 300
billion cubic meters, Bown said.
</P>
<P>
   But Yevdoshchuk's State Geology Committee believes there are
some 3,200 billion cubic meters left in the basin, about a third of
which is recoverable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think BP will be back after the Dnieper-Donets basin proves
itself,'' Yevdoshchuk said. ``I'm just afraid they will be too
late.''
</P>
<P>
   Significant economic change in Ukraine would have been required
for BP to make a profit on the project. BP would have demanded cash
payment for its share of the gas produced, but Ukraine's government
has so far been unable to collect enough taxes to pay public
institutions' gas bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you merely got everybody to pay for the gas they receive,
suddenly you would have conservation, and exploration would pick up
dramatically,'' Cormick said. ``Ukraine's economy would be on the
road to recovery in a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Bown, however, said BP Amoco's decision not to invest was based
purely on its gas explorations and had nothing to do with the
investment climate in Ukraine, which he sees as improving. The
decision also had nothing to do with BP Amoco's recent difficulties
with its investment in Russia's Sidanko oil company, he added. BP
announced last week that it had reached agreement with Tyumen Oil,
a Russian company, in connection with the dispute. The agreement
restores BP's control over a Siberian oil field.
</P>
<P>
   Bown stressed that BP Amoco was not reducing its presence in
Ukraine and would continue to expand as a retailer of gasoline and
distributor of specialty fuels, chemicals and lubricants.

SKI BUSINESS IN NEW ENGLAND RELYING ON SNOW MAKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MEG VAILLANCOURT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most New Englanders will be only dreaming of a white new year
this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the dearth of natural snow, sustained cold
temperatures are still allowing many New England ski resorts to
generate greenbacks by making artificial snow.
</P>
<P>
   Monday marked the the longest stretch without measurable snow at
Logan International Airport since the National Weather Service
began keeping records 108 years ago. There have been 287 days
without any white stuff in Boston, surpassing last year's record of
274 days.
</P>
<P>
   For ski areas, like retailers, the Christmas season can make or
break a year. So while Mother Nature hasn't brought snow, many ski
operators have taken advantage of the bitter cold by running their
snow guns around the clock.
</P>
<P>
   At Wachusett Mountain, located outside of Worcester, Mass.,
manmade snow now covers more than 75 percent of the mountain. The
Princeton resort's operators recently signed an agreement allowing
them to purchase excess water from the City of Fitchburg, which
quadrupuled Wachusett's snow-making capacity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in great shape,'' general manager David Crowley said
Monday. ``We've got the weather and the water to make snow, and
we're doing it 24 hours a day. And from an operator's standpoint,
the manmade stuff is actually better because it's more durable and
will last through thaws.''
</P>
<P>
   In a bid to encourage skiers, some operators even ``guaranteed''
a white Christmas by offering vouchers and future price reductions
if most of their trails weren't open for skiing over the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   As workers continued blanketing the slopes with manmade snow
ealier this week, skiers at the six New England resorts operated by
the American Skiing Co., for example, were being offered a $500
voucher toward lodging packages at the company's two western ski
resorts.
</P>
<P>
   The guarantee, limited to skiers who had reserved lodging
packages, kicked in if at least 70 percent of the terrain wasn't
open for skiing. Company officials, however, stressed they expected
to reach the mark at all six resorts, which include Sunday River
and Sugarloaf in Maine; Killington, Sugarbush and Mount Snow in
Vermont; and Attitash Bear Peak in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology has really improved so much that you can't
really notice the difference between manmade and natural snow,''
said Chip Seamans, managing director of Sunday River in Newry
Maine. ``The toughest part is convincing people there's still great
skiing up here.''
</P>
<P>
   But while officials at Killington boast their Vermont resort has
``the best snow-making equipment on the planet,'' smaller ski
operators without large capital budgets are clearly struggling.
</P>
<P>
   At the Blue Hills ski area, justoutside of Boston in Canton,
limited snow-making operations began Sunday night. Monday only
about 35 skiers were on the slopes, though snowmaking will continue
this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lose 25 percent or more of business if we aren't fully
operational this vacation week,'' said Blue Hills operator Stanley
Beers. ``And if you lose it, you never make it up. It's been this
way for the past three years. It's very, very tough.'' Traditional
New England resorts like the Woodstock Inn in Woodstock, Vt. and
The Balsams in Dixville Notch, N.H. saw no decline in business
because both resorts offer numerous other amenties for guests, many
repeat customers. Located deep in the North Woods and high in the
White Mountains, the Balsams even had enough natural snow to offer
cross-country skiing, as well as manmade snow on alpine trails.
</P>
<P>
   However, farther north in Pittsburg, N.H. businesses were hit
hard by the lack of snow. Here in the sparsely populated area along
the Canadian border, it's snowmobilers who are the winter cash
crop. And no matter how cold it gets, no one can afford to
manufacture the miles and miles of snow snowmobilers need.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we really need is a good storm,'' said Jim Kenny,
president of the North County Chamber of Commerce and owner of the
Northern Comfort Motel in nearby Colebrook. ``Usually that's not
hard to find. We got a couple of feet in November, but we lost it
all with the warm weather.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know any snow dances,'' Kenny added. ``But if I did, I
think I'd be doing them.''

U.N. SEEKS TO ENACT MEASURE TO CUT OFF FUNDS FOR TERRORISTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ In the waning days of this fall's General
Assembly session, a majority of nations, united by concerns about
terrorism, voted to establish an international agreement to stop
the flow of money to terrorist organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, the International Convention for the Suppression
of the Financing of Terrorism, is intended to encourage nations to
monitor closely the collection or deposit of funds by foreign
organizations that may be using the money to buy arms or to support
in other ways terrorists in another country.
</P>
<P>
   The convention asks governments to freeze such funds and to deny
groups or individuals the right to gain access to the money by
contending that any criminal acts committed are justifiable on
political, racial, ethnic or religious grounds. It asks governments
to extradite people found guilty of carrying out financial services
for terrorist groups.
</P>
<P>
   Under its provisions, the agreement will not go into effect
until at least 22 nations have signed and ratified it. That process
will begin in January.
</P>
<P>
   While many nations, large and small, welcomed the growing
international determination to cut off sources of income for
terrorist groups, the convention may be of most immediate help to
Sri Lanka, where a violent Tamil separatist movement against an
ethnic Sinhalese government has been sustained almost entirely by
money raised in ethnic Tamil communities in Canada, the United
States, India and Southeast Asia, diplomats and Sri Lankan
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The separatist group, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, has
over two decades eliminated all its more moderate Tamil rivals,
usually by killing them. It is suspected in the assassinations or
attempted assassinations of several prominent Sri Lankan
politicians, including government ministers. Most recently, the Sri
Lankan government blamed the Tigers for two bomb attacks on Dec.
18, one of which injured President Chandrika Kumaratunga just
before the vote in which she was re-elected to a second term.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has placed the Tamil Tigers on its list of
terrorist organizations, helping Sri Lanka in its efforts to draw
attention to the group's activities abroad. Sri Lanka, supported by
American and Canadian officials and ethnic Tamil community leaders
in other countries, says, for example, that the Tigers collect
money through intimidation from Tamils in Southeast Asia, and,
posing as victims of ethnic repression, use charitable front
organizations to raise money.
</P>
<P>
   With millions of dollars at their disposal, the Tigers buy arms
and pay to transport them to the north and east coasts of Sri
Lanka, where fierce fighting has gone on since the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The Tamil Tigers once had bases in the Indian state of Tamil
Nadu, across a narrow strait from Sri Lanka, where they received
training and help from Indian intelligence agencies and sympathetic
state officials. Those links have been cut by the Indian
government.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Rajiv Gandhi, a former Indian prime minister who sent
troops to Sri Lanka in 1987 to disarm the Tigers and other groups,
was assassinated in an attack that investigators said was planned
by the Tigers. He was killed at an election rally in Tamil Nadu by
a suicide bomber, who was identified as a member of the Tigers, in
an attack similar to the Dec. 18 assassination attempt on the Sri
Lankan president.

 S.F. Banks Set National Trends  &HT;     By Sam Zuckerman

<TEXT>
 &QL; 
At the dawn of the 20th century, the young city of San Francisco
was firmly established as the financial capital of the West, its
wealth amassed from Sierra gold, Nevada silver and the growing
agricultural outpouring of California's sun-washed valleys.
<P>
   One hundred years later, the city by the Bay is more than ever a
center of finance. But the sources of riches and the magnets for
capital include things undreamed of in 1900: computers, the
Internet, biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   In the past century, banks and brokerages have come and gone,
and proud names have risen and been erased. But San Francisco has
remained a wellspring of financial energy _ a place where new and
sometimes revolutionary ideas have taken root.
</P>
<P>
   Take branch banking, credit cards, discount stock brokerage and
online investing, which are now routine parts of the financial
lives of hundreds of millions of people around the world. San
Francisco entrepreneurs played major roles in spreading these
innovations. If not invented here, they first became marketplace
successes in the hands of banks and securities firms based in this
region.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Bay Area is the world headquarters for venture
capital, with the most important venture firms based here. More
public stock offerings are hatched here than any place in the
United States outside of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Schwab Corp., San Francisco born and bred, now stands as
one of the world's premiere financial firms, having conquered the
discount brokerage industry. Schwab and E-Trade Group, based in
Menlo Park, are No.1 and No.2 in the fast-growing online investing
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The region's financial influence has grown even as it has lost
many of its most powerful financial firms. San Francisco's biggest
banks _ most notably Bank of America _ have been taken over by
outsiders. Almost all of its homegrown investment banks have been
snapped up by far-off banks and brokerages.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Bay Area remains the world's most important nexus of
money and technology. The world's fastest-growing industries are
centered here. San Francisco and Silicon Valley are where the &LR; 
places &LR;  financial firms flock to manage stock offerings for  &LR; or
dole out merger advice to companies that are building the digital
infrastructure of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bay Area is the epicenter. It's where the information
economy gets financed,'' said Sandy Robertson, founder and former
chairman of Robertson Stephens, one of the San Francisco investment
banks that tied its fortunes to the technology industry, now owned
by Fleet Boston Financial Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Every top-tier U.S. investment bank today does a large portion
of its business from offices in San Francisco or Silicon Valley.
Wall Street powerhouse Credit Suisse First Boston may be based in
New York, but Frank Quattrone, the firm's superstar technology
dealmaker, plots strategy for IPOs from his office in Palo Alto.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Money for the Masses
</P>
<P>
   Like high finance, personal finance has changed dramatically for
Bay Area residents since 1900.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the century, banks catered mostly to the
propertied and privileged, those who owned businesses or farmland.
Ordinary people borrowed from family, friends, pawnshops or the
neighborhood moneylender.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virtually all banks that existed 100 years ago were
institutions founded by merchants and farmers for the purpose of
extending credit,'' said Andy Anderson, a historian employed by
Wells Fargo Bank.
</P>
<P>
   In 1900, Bank of California, which had risen to prominence
financing Nevada silver miners, was San Francisco's largest bank.
Wells Fargo was principally an express company that also did
banking through some 3,500 shipping offices throughout the West.
</P>
<P>
   Four years into the new century, Amadeo Peter Giannini, a
34-year-old son of Italian immigrant parents, opened a new bank in
San Francisco on the site of a former saloon. He dedicated his
enterprise to the then-unheard-of business of making loans to
ordinary shopkeepers and working people, often in amounts of $100
or less.
</P>
<P>
   Giannini's vision for his Bank of Italy was dismissed as
``pushcart marketing'' by other bankers. But the bank earned the
loyalty of customers and small shareholders, especially when it was
the first to extend credit _ from an improvised wooden counter on
the waterfront _ after the city's disastrous earthquake and fire in
1906.
</P>
<P>
   A few years later, when California liberalized banking laws,
Giannini bought a bank in his hometown of San Jose, establishing
Bank of Italy's first branch office. At the time, most banks
operated out of single offices.
</P>
<P>
   Giannini was the first to envision a far-flung chain of
branches. Despite obstacles thrown in his path by state and federal
regulators, Bank of Italy began buying banks throughout the state.
By 1927, Giannini had 276 branches in 199 California cities. Three
years later, he adopted the name Bank of America for his
institution.
</P>
<P>
   Giannini set his sights on expanding nationwide and moving into
insurance and securities. Federal regulators thwarted his plans,
but riding California's phenomenal growth after World War II, BofA
emerged as the world's largest bank.
</P>
<P>
   Wells Fargo, meanwhile, went in the opposite direction. When it
merged with Nevada National Bank in 1905, it split off its express
operations and began doing business out of a single San Francisco
office. It didn't venture into branch banking again until the
1950s.
</P>
<P>
   In 1958, BofA launched BankAmericard, the first successful bank
credit card. It wasn't the first bank charge card that extended
credit to holders. A New York bank had pioneered the idea seven
years before. But BofA promoted its card more aggressively and was
the first bank to build a critical mass of users and merchants.
</P>
<P>
   Soon it began franchising the card to other banks. In 1970, an
association of banks issuing the card was formed, an organization
whose name was later changed to Visa. Today Visa, headquartered
about 20 miles south of San Francisco in Foster City, is the
dominant credit card and one of the most powerful brand names in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Financial Prominence
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco started the century as a remote outpost of the
securities industry. By the end of the century, it had become one
of the industry's capitals, setting trends for corporate finance
and retail brokerage.
</P>
<P>
   The city's stock and bond exchange opened its doors in 1882,
trading the securities of local mining companies, municipal transit
concerns and utilities. In the 1920s, it established a ticker tape
link to the New York Stock Exchange, allowing local trading of the
Big Board's listed shares. Still, San Francisco's bourse was a
second-tier regional exchange, doing less business in a year than
the New York exchange did in a day.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's old-line brokerages _ such as Schwabacher and
Sutro _ managed the money of the local well-to-do. One exception,
Dean Witter, built a national business, ranking as one of the
nation's largest brokerages when it was bought by Chicago retail
giant Sears, Roebuck in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1960s, the winds of change were blowing over the San
Francisco securities industry. Down the Peninsula, in a region that
had not yet earned the moniker Silicon Valley, corporations such as
Hewlett-Packard and National Semiconductor were building businesses
based on information technology. The new industry needed capital to
expand.
</P>
<P>
   Regional brokerages ``were making no attempt to understand the
technology world,'' recalled William Hambrecht, who opened his
investment bank, Hambrecht &AMP; Quist, in 1968 to fill the vacuum.
``The New York firms couldn't respond, so we did.``
</P>
<P>
   Within months, another firm opened with the same idea, an
investment bank later known as Robertson Stephens. An offshoot of
the firm became Montgomery Securities.
</P>
<P>
   The three firms and several others helped finance the Bay Area's
technology industry. Their clout grew as the computer,
semiconductor and software industries mushroomed.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, New York investment banks invaded the region in
force, and the Bay Area became the nation's second-most-important
center for raising capital.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the decade, H&AMP;Q, Robertson Stephens and Montgomery
had all been taken over by commercial banks based on the East
Coast. New firms emerged _ in some cases founded by the same
entrepreneurs who built the investment banks of the 1960s and
1970s, such as W.R. Hambrecht &AMP; Co., _ to raise capital by selling
IPO and private placement shares over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   During the last quarter of the century, Bay Area firms also
revolutionized the retail investment industry.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1975, the New York Stock Exchange ended fixed commissions
on stock sales. At the time, it often cost hundreds of dollars to
buy shares. Across the country, a handful of brokers recognized an
opportunity to slash commissions for clients who made their own
investment decisions. But it was an unknown San Francisco firm
started the year before, Charles Schwab &AMP; Co., which vaulted to the
top of the discount brokerage industry.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Schwab, a 38-year-old Sacramento native who had attended
Stanford University on a golf scholarship before entering the
securities business, turned discount brokerage into a crusade. He
traveled the country preaching his new gospel to anyone who would
listen.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional brokers didn't act in the interest of clients, he
argued. They encouraged customers to trade as often as possible in
order to earn commissions. It's better for investors to make their
own decisions and pay lower rates, Schwab insisted.
</P>
<P>
   The company started building branches around the country and
using Schwab's sincere, bespectacled image in its advertisements.
By 1983, when BofA bought the firm, it was the nation's largest
discount broker. Four years later, Schwab bought the company back
and took it public.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Schwab has ridden an investment boom to become the
securities firm with the highest stock market value in the nation.
Just two years ago, the firm remade itself by cutting commissions
for trading on the Internet. Today, more than 2 out of every 3
Schwab customer trades are carried out online, and the firm
dominates the electronic brokerage industry.
</P>
<P>
   The Bay Area is also home to the No.2 online brokerage, Menlo
Park's E-Trade, whose goal is nothing less than to become a global
provider of the entire gamut of financial services, from mortgages
and credit cards to IPOs.
</P>
<P>
   Once home to the world's largest bank, San Francisco's status as
a center of traditional banking has slipped in an era of
megamergers.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese banks bought Bank of California and Los Angeles' Union
Bank in the 1980s. In 1996, the two banks combined to form Union
Bank of California, based in San Francisco. Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi owns about two-thirds of the bank's stock.
</P>
<P>
   After years of reckless lending around the world, BofA came
perilously close to failing in the early 1980s. When First
Interstate of Los Angeles made an unsuccessful hostile bid for the
bank in 1986, some predicted the Southern California metropolis
would eclipse San Francisco as a banking power.
</P>
<P>
   BofA recovered and ended up buying First Interstate's crosstown
rival, Security Pacific, in 1992. And four years later, First
Interstate was acquired by Wells Fargo, which had emerged as one of
the industry's best-regarded and toughest competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase catapulted Wells Fargo from California to a
presence throughout the West. But its overly aggressive plan for
combining the two banks caused service breakdowns and customer
defections.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, a weakened Wells Fargo was bought by Minneapolis's
Norwest Corp., which moved its headquarters to San Francisco and
kept the acquired bank's name. The new Wells Fargo is the nation's
seventh-largest bank and the largest bank based in the West.
</P>
<P>
   BofA itself was swept away in banking's merger wave, gobbled up
by North Carolina's NationsBank in 1998. NationsBank chief
executive Hugh McColl cast aside his pledge to make the combination
a merger of equals, fired BofA's former chief executive, David
Coulter, and reduced San Francisco to a regional headquarters of
his bank, which kept the BofA name.
</P>
<P>
   The Bay Area had once been the headquarters for dozens of
savings and loans, institutions created to finance home ownership.
Ill-planned expansion created a financial crisis in the industry
during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Some local thrifts failed,
while many others were swallowed up by stronger rivals.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the century, only a handful of local S&AMP;Ls remain.
Two rank among the industry's giants: San Francisco's CalFed Bank
is No.2 and Oakland's World Savings is No.3 among the nation's
thrifts.
</P>
<P>
   In the space of a century, Bay Area finance has gone from an era
of green eyeshades and rolltop desks to ATMs and online stock
trading. But, despite wrenching changes, when the subject is money,
San Francisco and its environs still rank as the most powerful
place in the West.

SO YOU HAVEN'T BOUGHT YOUR CHAMPAGNE YET ...
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: With CHAMPAGNE-OPENING-IT and CHAMPAGNE-TOASTS) 
By NATALIE HAUGHTON 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's down to the wire _ and you still haven't
purchased champagne or sparkling wine to ring in the year 2000.
You're not alone. According to a survey by Domaine Ste. Michelle,
85 percent of people plan to buy their sparkling wine just days
before the millennium, notes Kari Leitch, the Washington-based
winery's communications manager.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not too late, say local wine merchants. Granted, you
may not be able to get a special champagne bottle you've settled on
_ such as the $225 Dom Perignon Champagne Keepsake package that
includes a sterling silver cork holder _ but there are plenty of
excellent options in a variety of price categories ranging from
inexpensive to expensive.
</P>
<P>
   The champagne shortage hyped earlier in the year hasn't
materialized. Despite the higher-than-usual demand this year, most
wine shops still have good supplies. ``To date, we haven't run out
of champagne, and we don't expect to,'' says David Breitstein,
owner of Duke of Bourbon in Canoga Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been buying champagne throughout this past year,
but since Nov. 1 sales have skyrocketed. It's been a major boom to
the entire champagne industry, with a dramatic increase in sales _
at least 10 times greater than in a normal year.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales at his wine shop are up 30 percent to 40 percent this
holiday season, says Breitstein, who thinks they been driven by the
high interest in champagne for millennium celebrations as well as
gifts. ``We anticipate being busier between now and New Year's Eve
than ever in the shop's 33-year history.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sales of champagne are going absolutely crazy _ and there is
plenty of nonvintage available,'' says Dennis Overstreet,
proprietor of the Wine Merchant in Beverly Hills. However if
consumers want to indulge in something expensive and premium, some
champagnes such as Cristal, Dom Perignon, Le Grande Dame and the
Perrier-Jouet flower bottle will be in short supply, he adds.
</P>
<P>
   Overstreet advises buyers to seek the best value for the money.
For instance, if you plan to spend a good chunk of money, look for
a 1990 vintage champagne, as it is the best in recent years. ``Just
behind 1990 in overall quality are 1989 (rich and ripe in style)
and 1988 (more classic and balanced),'' notes a recent issue of the
Wine Spectator. If you are paying $100-plus for a 1992 Don
Perignon, or $200-plus for a 1993 Cristal, those are not
outstanding vintages of those champagnes, cautions Overstreet.
</P>
<P>
   Sales at the Wine Merchant have also increased more than 30
percent this holiday season _ and last year was a good year, notes
Overstreet, who says it appears that consumers are waiting until
the last minute to buy.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the year, people thought they were going to be
traveling or going out, but now people are staying at home _ and
some are having small parties _ and they're now buying champagne.
</P>
<P>
   Although there's a sales frenzy and tremendous demand,
Overstreet has not increased his champagne prices _ and to date he
hasn't seen price gouging.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular champagnes with Duke of Bourbon consumers have
been Veuve Clicquot Brut non-vintage ($37.50), Schramsberg ($24.99
to $65), Iron Horse ($19.99 to $45) and Taittinger (from $37 to
$200 a bottle), says Breitstein. At the high end, it appears that
Louis Roederer Cristal Champagne ($180) is the reigning king, he
adds.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are buying one great bottle since they are staying
home, says Ray Wolkoff, manager of the Flask Liquor Inc. in Studio
City.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line, says Paul Smith, owner of the Woodland Hills Wine
Co.: ``If you can't find your favorite champagne, there will be
other substitutes (at all levels) that are just as good but may not
be as well-recognized by the general public.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to buying champagne, figure a bottle will serve
three people (8 ounces or two glasses each). However, if you are
drinking throughout the evening and will be eating plenty, you may
want to buy enough for a bottle per person so you don't run out.
</P>
<P>
   Be sure to chill champagne well prior to opening. Figure about
six hours in the refrigerator. For quicker chilling _ in half an
hour _ place the bottle in a bucket filled with half ice and half
water.
</P>
<P>
   Some wine connoisseurs prefer serving the champagne in flutes
(to preserve the bubbles), while others use white wine glasses.
</P>
<P>
   Be aware that ``there is no American champagne. Real champagne
is made only in the Champagne region of France,'' note Dorothy J.
Gaiter and John Brecher, Wall Street Journal wine columnists.
However, ``many of the best American 'champagnes' have much in
common with the real thing and are made in much the same way as
champagne.''
</P>
<P>
   Here is the bubbly that the wine merchants and experts we
queried recommended for New Year's Eve celebrations. Prices are for
a 750- milliliter bottle and may vary from store to store. When
buying, keep in mind that the super-premium champagnes from
different producers have their own distinctive styles, ranging from
light and even fruity to heavy and serious. &QL;

   Now that you have a terrific bottle of champagne to ring in the
millennium, what's the most expedient way to open it without
exploding it and spraying it everywhere or blinding someone with
the cork?
</P>
<P>
   Make sure the wine is well chilled (at least four to six hours
in the refrigerator) before attempting to open it. It should be 40
to 45 degrees F.
</P>
<P>
   Point the cork end of the bottle away from you. Remove the foil
wrapper.
</P>
<P>
   Cover the top of the bottle with a heavy towel or cloth.
</P>
<P>
   Untwist the wire cage but do not remove it (some experts remove
the wire cage). Keep a thumb on top of the bottle to prevent an
unexpected pop of the cork.
</P>
<P>
   Holding the bottle at a 45 degree angle, gently twist the cork
(with its wire cage) in one direction (holding the cork down with
steady pressure) and the bottle in the opposite direction. GENTLY
ease the cork from the bottle with a delicate pop or hissing sound,
not a loud bang. The more momentum you have when the cork pops, the
more effervescence and champagne you lose.

 _ SF CHRON  
 Discount Brokerages, Online Trading Helped Change Investing  &HT;     By Arthur M. Louis 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
The rapidly growing importance of individual investors has been one
of the most remarkable developments in the U.S. financial markets
during the 20th century.
<P>
   For most of the century, individuals were kept ``at the end of a
long food chain that started with institutional investors,'' such
as insurance companies, banks and pension funds, observes Dan
Leemon, executive vice president for business strategy with Charles
Schwab Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Institutions controlled the bulk of the money, they traded
heavily, and they got loving attention from brokers and other
financial-service providers.
</P>
<P>
   But today, after nearly two decades of relentless buying, more
than half of all U.S. households own stocks either directly or
through mutual funds. Those holdings are worth roughly $10
trillion.
</P>
<P>
   The individual investor, Leemon says, ``has assumed his or her
role alongside the institutional investor.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that individual investors are throwing so much weight around
in the market, they, too, are being ardently courted by purveyors
of financial services.
</P>
<P>
   The staggering growth of the mutual-fund industry _ which caters
almost exclusively to individuals _ is a sign of that.
</P>
<P>
   Other signs include the proliferation of discount brokers, the
rapid development of online trading and investment research, the
extension of after-hours trading to individuals as well as
institutions and the greater availability of initial public
offerings to individuals.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the century, individual stock ownership was
confined primarily to a small coterie of wealthy people _ business
proprietors, their families, associates and friends. The rest of
the population needed whatever money it could muster just to make
ends meet.
</P>
<P>
   Individuals entered the stock market in great numbers for the
first time during the widespread economic prosperity that began in
the mid-1920s. The value of stocks owned by individuals swelled to
$5 billion in 1929 from less than $2 billion at the start of the
decade.
</P>
<P>
   It was a wild time in the market _ not unlike the present.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were buying tips, investing on momentum _ if something
goes up, buy it _ and often on margin,'' says W. Roger Servison,
executive vice president and managing director of Fidelity
Investments. ``It was highly speculative.''
</P>
<P>
   The October 1929 stock-market crash and the Depression that
followed blew most individual investors out of the market.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't return in a big way until three decades later,
during the waning years of the Eisenhower administration, when the
nation began another period of sustained prosperity and stock
prices again shot up.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, individuals fled yet again during the deep, grinding bear
market of 1973-74.
</P>
<P>
   The flow of individuals into stocks and mutual funds has
accelerated greatly since the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   That's partly because the market became wildly attractive during
that period, with the Dow Jones industrial average rocketing
fourteenfold from its 1982 bear-market low of less than 800 to more
than 11,000 in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   The other big reason _ as many readers of this article  &LR; know too
well _ is that the great corporate cost-cutting movement of recent
decades has revolutionized pensions, forcing workers to fend more
for themselves if they hope to properly fund their retirements.
</P>
<P>
   The old-style, standard, defined-benefit pension plans _ which
guaranteed workers a comfortable annual income once they retired,
no matter what _ are on their way out. Corporations consider it too
risky and expensive to continue providing such guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   In their place have sprung up an assortment of
defined-contribution plans _ most notably, 401(k)s and individual
retirement accounts _ whose benefits can vary widely, depending on
how successfully the contributions are invested.
</P>
<P>
   Most workers still are entitled to a modest, defined-benefit
pension in the form of Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   But economists and policymakers have expressed doubt that the
Social Security system will be solvent by the time today's younger
generation retires. That uncertainty has given individuals still
more incentive to invest in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the money flowing into 401(k) plans gets channeled into
stock mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   Just 30 years ago, the mutual-fund industry was a genteel
backwater of the investment world. There were only about 300 funds,
with total assets of around $50 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the biggest mutual fund alone _ Fidelity Magellan _
boasts assets of more than twice that amount, and the industry as a
whole is swarming with 7,000 funds holding some $3 trillion in
investor assets.
</P>
<P>
   Mutual funds now own about 20 percent of all publicly traded
U.S. stocks. That's up from less than 15 percent five years ago,
according to Chris Wioszczyna, a spokesman for the Investment
Company Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Individual investors also can claim considerable credit for the
huge reductions in brokerage commissions.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the century, commissions were noncompetitive. The
industry's self-regulatory bodies decreed that any given trade must
cost exactly the same regardless of who you were or which broker
you used.
</P>
<P>
   After commissions were deregulated in the mid-1970s,
institutional investors _ thanks to their heavy trading volume _
got big discounts from their brokers. They typically paid
commissions of 6 or 7 cents per share, while many individuals had
to pay upward of $1 per share.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the discount brokers, led by such pioneers as Schwab,
which got its start in San Francisco a quarter-century ago. They
had the foresight to coddle individual investors when there weren't
all that many of them.
</P>
<P>
   The early wave of discounts cut commission costs by 50 to 80
percent. The latest wave _ made possible by online trading, which
is far less labor-intensive than other forms of brokerage _ has cut
commissions to the point where they are negligible.
</P>
<P>
   Now you can buy or sell as many as 5,000 shares of stock for a
flat commission as low as $5 to $10 per trade _ as little as 0.1
cent per share.
</P>
<P>
   That has encouraged individuals to trade more heavily than they
did in the past _ behavior that undoubtedly endears them to their
brokers, though not necessarily to their heirs.
</P>
<P>
   Some market historians wonder how long the new Era of the
Individual Investor can last. They keep harking back to those other
periods when individuals had a fling with stocks, only to flee in
panic when the market faltered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typically, at some point, these cycles end,'' Fidelity's
Servison warns. ``We seem to be getting near the peak of enthusiasm
for stocks. When companies with no revenues go up eight- or tenfold
in a single day, you've got to say that there's an awful lot of
optimism that may not be fully warranted.''
</P>
<P>
   Other experts feel that individual investors will show more
staying power than they have in the past.
</P>
<P>
   James Spellman, a spokesman for the Securities Industry
Association, says individual participation in the stock market
clearly is becoming deeply entrenched.
</P>
<P>
   He notes that the national fixation on stocks has been filtering
down to kids who aren't old enough to buy securities on their own.
The SIA sponsors a stock-market education program in schools, and
700,000 kids are participating this year _ up from 415,000 in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Bernstein, chief quantitative strategist with Merrill
Lynch, thinks individual investors will hang in there if the market
turns sour, if only for one compelling reason: ``Individual
participation is going to continue unless someone does away with
defined-contribution plans.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Steinberg, chief executive of Individual Investor
Group, which publishes several financial magazines, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we talk again in another 100 years, there will have been a
lot of bumps in the meantime,'' he observes. ``But the basic trends
of greater individual participation will continue.''

RAISE YOUR GLASS ... AND SAY SOMETHING PROFOUND
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: With CHAMPAGNE and CHAMPAGNE-OPENING-IT) 
By NATALIE HAUGHTON 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the millennium celebration just a few days away, soon it'll
be time to raise our glasses and drink a toast to 2000. Despite the
hype surrounding the arrival of 2000, a recent poll shows that 79
percent of Americans plan to celebrate at home. And nearly half of
all Americans plan to ring in the millennium with a champagne
toast, according to a survey by Korbel Champagne Cellars.
</P>
<P>
   But before you lift your glass, here are a few pointers on
proper etiquette and toasting, if there is any such thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the underlying requirement is to make it (the toast)
considerate and respectful of the people you are with,'' says Peter
Post, the great grandson of Emily Post and co-author with his
sister-in-law Peggy Post of the recently released, ``The Etiquette
Advantage in Business'' (HarperCollins; $35).
</P>
<P>
   A business function calls for one type of toast, whereas at a
gathering of family or friends something else might be appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing wrong with toasting without liquor. You don't
have to feel obligated to have alcohol if you don't want to,''
stresses Post. Toasting or raising a glass filled with water,
sparkling water, ginger ale (which looks similar to champagne),
cola or whatever else you like is perfectly acceptable and part of
the fun.
</P>
<P>
   A toast doesn't need to be long. ``It can be 30 seconds or a
minute if there's something you want to say. You are trying to get
the sentiment of the moment across,'' says Post.
</P>
<P>
   ``The toast should be positive, serious and to the point _ no
inside jokes,'' advises Gary Heck, president and chairman, Korbel
Champagne Cellars, in Guerneville, adding that the person
delivering it should practice, stand up tall and hold the glass out
in front of him/her.
</P>
<P>
   Kari Leitch, communications manager at Domaine Ste. Michelle
winery in Paterson, Wash., believes the toast should be succinct
and speak to the heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saying something heartfelt is always appropriate and the
briefer the better,'' say Dorothy J. Gaiter and John Brecher,
co-authors of ``The Wall Sreet Journal Guide to Wine,'' (Broadway
Books; $25), who write a weekly wine tastings column in the
Journal's Weekend edition.
</P>
<P>
   At toasting time, Post suggests everyone else lift their glass
to eye, face or chin level _ and after the toast everyone should
touch glasses with the person on the right and left and those in
the immediate proximity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toasting was a real ceremony in years past,'' says Post. In
these casual times usually the person giving the toast stands while
others remain seated. In more formal circumstances, however, every
one in attendance stands. It all depends on the gathering, the
occasion and the people involved, notes Post.
</P>
<P>
   So what does Post propose as a general toast for 2000?
Possibilities might include:
</P>
<P>
   ``Happy Millennium''; ``Let's raise our glasses to the future'';
or ``This moment is an opportunity for us to separate the past from
the future. We can gather that which is best about our past and use
it as a spring board to begin anew. Happy Millenium or Happy New
Year!''
</P>
<P>
   Many people are going to thank guests for being there and say
Happy New Year, believes Post.
</P>
<P>
   Brecher proposes the following toast: ``May the next year be a
great vintage for you _ or for everybody.'' Gaiter's suggestion is
``May you always have something wonderful in your glass.''
</P>
<P>
   Or you can just wish and hope for good health and happiness in
the year ahead, advises the twosome. A year is plenty to toast they
say _ not a whole millennium. ``Everything we do is wine related,''
note the duo, adding that it's hard to think in terms of looking
ahead even more than one year.
</P>
<P>
   To help toasters-to-be honor this momentous occasion, Korbel
Champagne Cellars searched for a year for the ideal toast in its
Ultimate Millennium Toast Contest. From the almost 1,000 entries
received from consumers throughout the country, they selected the
following grand-prize winning toast written by David Akers of New
Hampshire, which earned him a trip for two to New York's Time
Square for Friday's millennium celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``His entry represents the sentiments Korbel believes are
integral elements of the best celebrations _ strong traditions,
reverence for the past and hope for the future,'' says Korbel's
Heck, who urges everybody to celebrate responsibility. ``David's
toast is the perfect salute to the Millenium.''
</P>
<P>
   Raise your glass high! 2000 bubbles, one for each year. Round
like the world, promising good cheer. A tribute to mankind for all
we've achieved. To the courage and sacrifice of those who believed.
Goodbye to a millennium, hello to a new. Here's to the pleasure of
beginning with you!
</P>
<P>
   Domaine Ste. Michelle also offers the following millennium
toasts gathered from responses in a recent consumer survey.
</P>
<P>
   Here's to a fresh start, full of possibilities, twists and
turns, and good luck with continued love, health and happiness.
</P>
<P>
   A new millennium _ a new beginning. To 2000!
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday is past, tomorrow future, today is a gift, that's why
it's called the present.
</P>
<P>
   And here's a toast Benjamin Franklin once gave: ``Be at war with
your voices, at peace with your neighbors, and let every New Year
find you a better man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making the millennium into something because we choose
to,'' continues Post, who is spending New Year's Eve at home with a
few friends from his Vermont office. ``We like, as a society, to
mark moments in time _ birthdays, wedding anniversaries,
graduations, and I think for good or bad, we have identified the
millennium as a moment to reflect and to look forward _ and so
people are making something of it. The millennium is an opportunity
_ and a time to separate the past from the future.'' &QL;

   PEMBROKE PINES, Fla. _ Mental health care advocates long viewed
South Florida State Psychiatric Hospital here as a dumping ground,
a place where patients were treated poorly, languished for years
and died mysteriously.
</P>
<P>
   South Florida State, only a few years ago threatened with
closing as the way to solve its problems, is now at the heart of an
experiment. Experts say it is the first state mental hospital in
the nation to be turned over completely to a private company that
hopes to operate it at a profit.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 legislators in Florida, which was involved in a long
court battle to improve conditions at the hospital, voted to
contract out its operation. The winning bidder was a subsidiary of
Wackenhut Corrections Corp., one of the companies that started the
boom in private-enterprise prisons a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Many local advocates for the mentally ill were initially
horrified that a prison company was taking over a mental hospital,
but they now say that conditions here have improved. For example,
patients, rather than staying indefinitely, are put into treatment
programs intended to get them out.
</P>
<P>
   Wackenhut Corrections officials say they are making money but
refuse to say how much. The company is paid $32 million a year to
operate the hospital, its budget when it was run by the Florida
Department of Children and Families. The company's profit will come
from cost savings.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking over the hospital in November 1998, the Wackenhut
subsidiary, Atlantic Shores Healthcare, has reduced full-time
positions to 500 from 720, and it plans to cut 80 more jobs, to pay
for a new building.
</P>
<P>
   George Zoley, the chief executive of Wackenhut Corrections, said
further staff reductions would not affect care because the new
building would centralize the hospital's operation, making it
easier to manage.
</P>
<P>
   Some mental health experts say they fear that Wackenhut is
spending more at South Florida State now than it will in the future
because its track record there will help it market itself to other
states.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they are going to use this as a poster facility to win
contracts in other states, they ought to be operating it in the
black,'' said Patty Cooper, a program director in Florida with the
Advocacy Center, a federally funded group that works on behalf on
the mentally disabled.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of states have contracted with private
companies to operate mental health services, including community
clinics, substance abuse programs and homes for troubled youth.
With billions of dollars involved, companies large and small have
jumped into the arena, promising to operate programs more
efficiently and effectively than public agencies.
</P>
<P>
   While some mental health experts say privatization has led to
improved services in some states, programs elsewhere have collapsed
amid accusations that companies shortchanged patients or even
abused them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a vast social experiment at this point whether private
companies can serve as effective intermediaries to coordinate
health care,'' said Steven Findlay, research director at the
National Institute for Health Care Management, a nonprofit group in
Washington. ``And mental health care is a lot more pragmatic than
health care in general''
</P>
<P>
   Amid this transition, the 260 state psychiatric hospitals
nationwide have largely resisted such change.
</P>
<P>
   The number of such hospitals has been sharply cut. Because of
moves over the past decade to deinstitutionalize the mentally ill,
the number of patients has dropped just as sharply, to 59,000 in
1996 from about 560,000 in 1955, according to the Center for Mental
Health Services, a federal agency.
</P>
<P>
   The hospitals now serve the most seriously ill patients, and
federal statistics suggest that states spend about half their
mental health care budgets to operate them.
</P>
<P>
   Some states have moved to close psychiatric hospitals and send
patients to facilities owned by private companies that get patients
with private insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining public mental hospitals like South Florida State,
which is west of Fort Lauderdale, are often remnants of a different
era. South Florida State, which was opened in the late 1950s, is on
a campus dotted with low-slung cottages, ficuses and palms. Once
home to 1,500 patients, it now houses up to 350.
</P>
<P>
   At South Florida State, the vast majority of patients are
involuntarily committed by judges who determine that they are a
danger to themselves or others. Others are committed after being
found not guilty of a crime by reason of insanity.
</P>
<P>
   While states sought out private companies to build prisons
because they wanted more jail space, there are ample psychiatric
hospital beds. Wackenhut's chief executive, Zoley, said there might
be another powerful incentive to privatize the hospitals: Many
states face court orders or Justice Department actions to improve
care at them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are approaching other states, and other states are
interested,'' Zoley said.
</P>
<P>
   As with prisons, Zoley said, he believes that a company can
improve conditions and run a mental hospital more efficiently than
a state agency because it can, among other things, contract for
services quickly and cheaply.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly a decade, South Florida State was at the center of a
legal battle. In 1989, mental health care advocates sued the state
after finding conditions at the hospital like a lack of toilets and
patients wandering around naked, said Alice K. Nelson, a lawyer
with Southern Legal Counsel, a public interest law firm in
Gainesville.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the state and advocates entered into a consent decree
under which Florida pledged to improve living conditions. But the
advocates, displeased with the pace of change, continued to fight
in court over patient issues.
</P>
<P>
   As the battle played out, Florida officials considered closing
the hospital. Then in 1997, the Florida Legislature voted to
privatize it, and the legislation was passed and signed by the
governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an opportunity to do something different,'' said State
Rep. Debby Sanderson, a Fort Lauderdale Republican who was one of
the privatization bill's sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Several companies including Magellan Health Services, which
administers mental health programs for several states nationwide,
expressed interest. In the end Atlantic Shores Healthcare, which
was formed around the time of the Florida bill, was the only
bidder.
</P>
<P>
   The company's experience was limited. Wackenhut Corrections
provides psychiatric services to inmates in prisons it runs, and
Atlantic Shores Healthcare bought a small private psychiatric
hospital in 1997 in Fort Lauderdale as it prepared to bid on the
Florida contract.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials quickly found, however, that running a large
state mental hospital involved far bigger challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Under the state's operation, for example, patients at South
Florida State could smoke when they wanted, buy snacks when they
pleased or roam the hospital grounds if they desired. Atlantic
Shores Healthcare officials proposed banning smoking and restricted
access to vending machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right away, they came in and brought in changes that affected
everyone, and the patients didn't have a say in it,'' said Robert
Bowyer, who was treated at the hospital for manic depression.
</P>
<P>
   Those changes stirred fears among some advocates for the
mentally ill that the company was transferring its prison industry
roots to a mental health setting. Officials soon backed off some
changes, like the proposed ban on smoking. Vending machines were
kept in place, but color-coded to alert patients with diabetes, for
example, to snacks that are laden with sugar.

   Still, most area advocates say the company has moved to improve
conditions at the hospital. Anita Godfrey, president of the Mental
Health Association of Broward County, said patients were receiving
better treatment. And this year the hospital was accredited by the
Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organization, a
national group that surveys hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Under the five-year contract, the state approves all admissions
and discharges and monitors the company's compliance with its
contract.
</P>
<P>
   Another subsidiary of Wackenhut Corrections is building a
psychiatric hospital here that is being financed by public bonds.
In order to pay the annual $3 million debt on those bonds, 80 more
staff positions at South Florida State will soon be cut.
</P>
<P>
   Even supporters of the company's efforts say it is too early to
tell whether the company will succeed. Though Atlantic Shores
Healthcare has set a goal of minimizing patient stays,
community-based mental health programs here, like elsewhere in the
country, often lack the resources to take those set for discharge.
</P>
<P>
   Findlay, the health care expert, said that he believed it would
take at least three years to amass the data to determine success
here. His concern, he said, is that Florida officials, now that
they have shed a problem, may simply forget to keep track of how
the hospital evolves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can only hope that the state watches it carefully,''
Findlay said.

MARKET PLACE: PRISON REALTY ANNOUNCES A RESTRUCTURING 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: The first name of Prison Realty's chief executive, Doctor R.
Crants, is correct.) 
(lb) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It sounded like a good idea at the time _ and possibly it was.
</P>
<P>
   But a 1997 decision by Corrections Corp. of America, the United
States' leading private builder and operator of prisons, to spin
off its real-estate operations and, in effect, become a real-estate
investment trust, has come to an ignominious end.
</P>
<P>
   Prison Realty Trust, the once high-flying offshoot, announced a
restructuring plan Monday under which it would raise up to $350
million in badly needed financing and, not incidentally, convert
back to an ordinary tax-paying company.
</P>
<P>
   The earlier transition to a REIT turned the popular growth stock
into a dividend play for investors. REITS pay out 95 percent of
their earnings to investors to avoid taxes, and their steady stream
of cash appeals to those looking for income.
</P>
<P>
   But Prison Realty was problematic for a host of reasons,
including a complex structure and its close relationship with
Corrections Corp. Last month, Standard &AMP; Poor's put some of Prison
Realty's debt on special watch with ``developing implications.''
And the stock has tumbled 75 percent this year, to close Monday at
$5.25 a share, far from its $21 offering price in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
   With new management, a more transparent structure and a cash
infusion from a savvy and reputable investment group, the
reconstituted Corrections Corp. will have considerable potential,
according to Wall Street analysts, though they are waiting for a
conference call with management next week before making outright
recommendations. Among their questions is how diluted the stake of
existing shareholders will be because of the new investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We view it as net net a positive,'' said Brian Shepler, vice
president of equity research for SunTrust Equitable Securities in
Nashville, Tenn., the company's home town.
</P>
<P>
   Another analyst, James R. Macdonald, research vice president for
First Analysis Corp. in Chicago, said, ``I'm still holding my
neutral rating, but I'm considering looking more favorably on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although private companies can build and operate prisons more
efficiently than governments, they usually are at a disadvantage
when financing them. Governments can issue debt at low cost because
interest on their securities is not subject to tax and because
investors see little investment risk, given the implicit guarantee
of governments to make good on their debts.
</P>
<P>
   When REITS became investment darlings two years ago, Corrections
Corp. saw an opportunity to raise money inexpensively. The IPO of
Prison Realty Trust was greeted with enthusiasm, the proceeds were
leveraged and the money was used to finance more growth in a
business known for very high barriers to entry (as well as to
customers seeking an exit).
</P>
<P>
   Before long, though, the situation turned sour. The market
turned hostile to REITS, and some prisons that Prison Realty built
had long delays in receiving inmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was bad financial engineering combined with a bad market
combined with operating problems,'' Macdonald said, citing in
particular a long-completed prison in California City, Calif., that
got its first prisoners only this month.
</P>
<P>
   Management lost much credibility with investors, analysts said,
after making a convoluted proposal last year to remerge the two
entities. Analysts found the plan not only difficult to fathom but
filled with conflict, because executives were on both sides of the
transaction. Lease terms between the two companies had already
aroused complaint.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what started the stock sliding,'' said Gary Boston, a
PaineWebber analyst who said Monday that it was too early to tell
whether the restructuring would be appealing. He wondered whether,
among other things, the return on the preferred stock to be offered
would be paid in cash or in stock.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, Doctor R. Crants, the chairman and chief
executive of Prison Realty, is to resign. Thomas W. Beasley, the
former chairman and one of three founders of Corrections Corp. in
1983, becomes interim chairman immediately and will add the title
of interim chief executive when the deal closes.
</P>
<P>
   One thing was immediately clear: Holders of Prison Realty
shares, which fell 50 cents more on Monday to $5.25, will not get a
year-end dividend amounting to what Christopher P. Haley, senior
real estate analyst for First Union Securities in Richmond, Va.,
had estimated at $1.50 to $2 a share.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it would give up its privileged status as a
REIT for this tax year, perhaps figuring that taxes would be
minimal because of restructuring charges. The company said no
dividends would be paid on its stock pending shareholder approval
of the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate for existing shareholders but a positive
development'' in reviving the company's fortunes, Haley said of
Monday's announcement. With the company potentially earning 40
cents a share next year and 80 to 90 cents in 2001, Haley called
Corrections Corp. ``an intriguing investment _ but not right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The fresh capital is coming from a group led by an affiliate of
Fortress Investment Group and affiliates of Blackstone Group and
Bank of America. They plan to buy $315 million in preferred shares
at closing and will commit to buying an additional $35 million
worth.
</P>
<P>
   Existing shareholders are to get rights to co-invest up to $75
million with the institutional investors and to get preferred stock
and warrants with identical terms except for certain voting rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a highly focused, decisive action,'' asserted Joseph
Russell, chairman of a special board committee created in August to
find a strategic investor and review Prison Realty's financial
options and organizational structure. ``We are returning this
company to the corporate structure under which it achieved its
greatest growth and success.''

U.S. SET TO MONITOR YEAR 2000 GLITCHES FROM CENTRAL BUNKER 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MARC LACEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It does not resemble a bunker. Its computers have
suffered the same routine glitches that computers do in every other
office suite. But as the millennium approaches, two floors of a
nondescript building near the White House have been transformed
into command central for the federal government's response to Year
2000-related emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   The Information Coordination Center, as it is officially known,
will open for business on Tuesday morning. It will begin 24-hour
operations on Thursday. By the time midnight arrives on Dec. 31, as
many as 200 government bureaucrats will be in place on the 8th and
10th floors of 1800 G St., along with scores of journalists,
industry representatives and others.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes according to plan, details of a sudden power failure
in Bangladesh would flash across the computer screen of John A.
Koskinen, who is President Clinton's Year 2000 coordinator, as
would news of a run on automated teller machines in Bangor, Maine.
Cots are available in the center for naps. Coffee will be brewing
at noon and night. Koskinen will provide media briefings from the
center, and he will talk with Vice President Al Gore, who has been
designated the White House contact, on a secure line.
</P>
<P>
   Is there a button Koskinen can push to start the ATM's working
in Maine? No, the command center's goal is not to fix Year 2000
problems, but to gather information about such glitches and help
coordinate the government's response.
</P>
<P>
   From the outside, the 12-story building is run of the mill for
downtown Washington. Owned by private investors, it houses the
Veterans Affairs Department on three floors and the World Bank on
another three. Until recently, the headquarters of the Secret
Service was there.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned about security, government officials refuse to
describe exactly what devices the command center contains. But a
tour on Monday revealed a vast expanse of computers, walls of glass
creating a futuristic command center look, and large TV monitors
and world maps.
</P>
<P>
   In case the lights go out, the building has two generators in
the basement and a third one that had been installed for the Secret
Service. The building is also equipped with a system to keep
computers running if the power is interrupted, said Robert E. Carl,
the building manager.
</P>
<P>
   Creating the center cost about $30 million, officials said.
Operating it until June, the date officials expect to wrap up their
work, will bring the total cost to about $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   But the expense is necessary, Koskinen said. Although government
command centers exist in the White House, the Pentagon and numerous
other departments and agencies, none were appropriate for this
unique situation, Koskinen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no other place in the government that was geared up
to handle this volume of information,'' said Koskinen, who
considers the Year 2000 conversion the greatest information
processing exercise since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   A typical hurricane only concerns a handful of states, Koskinen
explained. Even the bombing campaign in Kosovo was centered on a
specific region, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the date rollover could cause problems anywhere in
the world. The command center will receive reports, filtered
through the Federal Emergency Management Agency, from similar
command centers set up in every state. The center will also gather
data from Year 2000 coordinators in 180 countries worldwide.
Embassies and military bases will also forward updates, as will
private industries.
</P>
<P>
   A test of the computer system at the command center that was
staged about a month ago disclosed some glitches. But the computers
passed a follow-up test earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   After a New Year's Eve trip to New York City to reassure the
public that airplanes are up and running, Koskinen plans to spend
most of his waking hours, and perhaps some of his sleeping ones, at
the center. Despite the expense and work of putting it all
together, Koskinen said he would be pleased if it did not turn into
a beehive of activity.
</P>
<P>
   A boring command center, he said, would suit him just fine.

SO WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL ABOUT DOOMSDAY? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By D. PARVAZ  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The big Y2K, the year 2,000, the beginning of the end, the
apocalypse, Armageddon, the violent end to the Big Bang start.
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe, maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, we seem more obsessed with The End than usual _
witness the glut of end-of-the-world movies and a doomsdayesque
preoccupation with all things Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   Who can say why?
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe Rodney Stark, a sociology professor at the
University of Washington who's an expert in apocalyptic studies.
</P>
<P>
   Stark says this cultural interest in disaster theories springs
from two factors.
</P>
<P>
   To start with, Stark says, our society is safe _ perhaps too
safe.
</P>
<P>
   Without much risk or threat around, people may see danger in
even the most inconsequential event.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're moving very rapidly towards a no-risk world,'' he says.
``I think that's the real end-of-the-line sort of problem we're
having as a culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Stark is old school. He says he knows kids who have ``never been
punched in the mouth, never gone to a funeral, never seen a body
and don't expect ever to have to take any risks.''
</P>
<P>
   This does not impress him as an indicator for a safe, healthy
society. Indeed, Stark thinks it has turned us into whimpering
sissies.
</P>
<P>
   ``To coin a phrase, I think we're turning into chicken----s,''
he says, leaning in to make his point.
</P>
<P>
   He says when he was a kid, no one could get people interested in
the idea that in the next 10,000 years things were going to end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hell, they were trying to deal with next week,'' Stark says.
``And they all figured the world would end sometime.''
</P>
<P>
   He says that created incentive to lead a decent life. A good
life was ``the vaccine for the end of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Stark also says he doesn't think many people are concerned about
the end of the world as the new millennium approaches.
</P>
<P>
   But that's only if you don't count all those folks influenced by
what he calls ``pseudo-science'' _ the people who believe the sun
is going to explode or implode in our lifetime, that the hole in
the ozone layer will expand so much that we'll all die of skin
cancer, or that Earth will explode in some intergalactic collision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not talking about the Bible,'' he says. ``We are talking
about people who are very strong of faith, but they're not of
religion. They believe that stuff, uncritically, and with an
extraordinary close-mindedness.''
</P>
<P>
   Stark says that no scientific evidence seems to sway these
believers in doom from natural causes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's silly, but it sure has been a good living for some
people,'' he says with a shrug.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can guess what one of the next hustles is gonna be,'' he
says, perhaps echoing a couple of recent disaster movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're gonna scare the hell out of us over meteors. And so we
have to build some big rocket to go blow these damn things up.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, I'd invest in rocket companies. I mean it.''

SPRINT BARRED FROM MANAGING ITS BRAZILIAN SUBSIDIARY 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ In a decision that may shake up Brazil's
long-distance industry, Sprint Corp. was barred from managing its
Brazilian subsidiary after its partner in the company, National
Grid PLC of Britain, persuaded a court that delicate corporate
information might be disclosed to MCI Worldcom.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, which effectively removes Sprint from participation
in day-to-day decisions at Intelig, a start-up concern formed
together with National Grid and France Telecom SA, came after MCI
Worldcom announced plans earlier this year to acquire Sprint. MCI
Worldcom already operates Brazil's dominant long-distance carrier,
called Embratel.
</P>
<P>
   ``If National Grid were to hope to compete in any way, it was
crucial for them to get Sprint out of the venture,'' said Carlos
Eduardo Siqueira, a telecommunications analyst with Banco BBA
Creditanstalt. ``Now that this is under way, the next step is to
find a new partner that will help in selling Intelig to the
Brazilian consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   The jostling among partners in Intelig comes at a crucial time
for the company, which plans to begin operations next month.
National Grid, which owns 50 percent of Intelig, with Sprint and
France Telecom holding 25 percent stakes, is one of several
companies hoping to grab market share amid the gradual deregulation
of telecommunications in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Yet while National Grid's plans seemed fine last year, when it
acquired a license to provide long-distance service, they were
thrown into doubt with the MCI Worldcom deal for Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   Government regulators in Brazil had expressed concern about the
merger because the subsidiaries operated by the two companies are
the only competitors in providing a breadth of long-distance
services to individuals and companies. But regulators have not
moved to force Sprint to divest itself of its holdings, apparently
awaiting for U.S. regulators to complete their review of the
merger.
</P>
<P>
   National Grid and France Telecom, however, could not wait. ``The
situation would be chaotic otherwise, with trust among the partners
at stake,'' said Marcio Simoes, an editor of RNT, a Brazilian
telecommunications magazine.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Sprint declined to comment on the ruling, which
was handed down by a Rio de Janeiro court on Monday, citing a
company policy against speaking on pending litigation.
</P>
<P>
   In the Brazilian legal system, a ruling affecting business
matters can often be upheld or overturned several times during a
lengthy appeals process before high courts in Brasilia make a final
decision.

LEONARD H. GOLDENSON, FORCE BEHIND ABC, DIES AT 94  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Mass., Pa.)   By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leonard H. Goldenson, the self-contained man who bought the
American Broadcasting Co. in 1953 and made it an incubator of
television innovations while he pushed it from also-ran status to
parity with its more senior rivals, died at his home in Sarasota,
Fla. Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Along with William S. Paley of the Columbia Broadcasting System
and David Sarnoff of the National Broadcasting Co., Goldenson was
one of a trio of post-War entrepreneurs who made the dominant three
broadcast networks into pillars around which the television
industry constructed itself in the 1950s and 1960s. Goldenson, the
least known of the trio, was the last survivor of the three when he
died at 94.
</P>
<P>
   As head of the network he bought for $24.5 million in 1953,
Goldenson gambled on ideas that others in the industry rejected. He
gave crucial financial backing to both the original Disneyland
theme park in 1954 and, a quarter-century later, to the ESPN cable
sports network _ both investments that paid off handsomely for the
company.
</P>
<P>
   Before engineering ABC's merger with Capital Cities in 1985,
Goldenson fought off a takeover effort by Howard Hughes and Harold
Geneen. Over the years, he also helped convince Hollywood studios
that television could be an ally, he gathered executive talent like
Roone Arledge, Michael Eisner and Barry Diller, and presided over
the creation of television staples like ``Monday Night Football,''
the miniseries and the late-night news program ``Nightline.''
</P>
<P>
   He remained the least-known of the network chiefs, a modest man
whose training was in the law and whose talent was not in
programming or technological wizardry, but in the unglamorous art
of stitching diffuse enterprises together, expanding them and
making them work. When he engineered the merger of ABC and Capital
Cities in 1985, the network was valued at $3.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Roone Arledge, the chairman of ABC News, said during an
interview Monday that for most of its two decades, ABC ``was a very
modest operation up against two giants. I didn't think Leonard ever
quite got the credit he deserved, because ABC was so far behind.
You looked at Bill Paley and Sarnoff and they were both giants,
deservedly so. It took a long time for people to put Leonard in
that same category.''
</P>
<P>
   Rupert Murdoch, the chief executive of News Corp., who would
eventually found the Fox network and play the same underdog game
that Goldenson mastered, contributed a commentary to Goldenson's
own 1991 autobiography, ``Beating the Odds.'' He wrote that ABC's
chief as ``in many ways a role model.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Goldenson was born in 1905 in Scottdale, Pa., a rural
town outside Pittsburgh. A high school athlete who enrolled in
Harvard University at the age of 16, according to a biography
provided by ABC, he graduated from Harvard Law School. Working
during the summer for a securities broker in Pittsburgh, he built
up significant investments that he liquidated a month before the
market crashed in October 1929, giving him the cash he needed to
finish law school.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1930s, he was hired to reorganize the New England
theaters of the bankrupt Paramount Picture, and rose to run all
1,800 Paramount theaters by 1938. In 1951, when the Federal
government brought antitrust pressure on the company and its movie
production unit split from the theater unit, Goldenson became
president of United Paramount Theaters.
</P>
<P>
   His background as a theater owner who needed the pictures
Hollywood produced gave him a unique perspective on television when
he bought the ABC network, a deal approved by the federal
government in 1953, The network had five owned-and-operated
stations and eight affiliates and reached 35 percent of the
households in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Shows like ``Hollywood Screen Test,'' ``Treasury Men in Action''
and ``Dick Tracy,'' the fare of his first couple of years with the
network, gave way, within the decade, to shows like ``The
Untouchables,'' ``Leave it to Beaver'' and ``77 Sunset Strip,''
largely because Goldenson persuaded Hollywood studios that filming
material for the small screen could supplement, not detract from,
their theater business.
</P>
<P>
   In later years, Goldenson blessed unorthodox concepts like
``Movie of the Week,'' ``Monday Night Football'' and the first
television miniseries, Alex Haley's ``Roots.''
</P>
<P>
   As the author Ken Auletta, who wrote ``Three Blind Mice,'' about
the takeover of the three major broadcast networks in 1985 and
1986, said in an interview, ``Guys in third place are perennially
willing to take risks. They're the guys who throw the hail mary
pass on the third down. He saw himself as the challenger not only
because ABC was in third place, with the weakest group of stations
and the weakest ratings in prime time and the weakest news.'' But
also because of his understated personality. ``He couldn't compete
on the same stage as Paley and Sarnoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``All those things combined to make him bolder,'' Auletta said
Monday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The ABC newsman Ted Koppel, describing the network's lowly
status and the musical-chairs programming that resulted, recalled a
1960s joke of the comedian Milton Berle: ``The way to end the
Vietnam war is to book it on ABC. It would be canceled in 13
weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   But Koppel, the newsman whose ``Nightline'' broadcast was born
in 1979 on Goldenson's watch, also noted, ``You make a mistake if
you focus too much on the individual programming. Leonard was a man
who gave his executives the leeway to be as good as they possibly
could be.''
</P>
<P>
   The father of three daughters, the oldest of whom died of
cerebral palsy, Goldenson also became the founder of United
Cerebral Palsy. He and his wife, Isabelle, gave $60 million to
Harvard Medical School in 1994 for research on neurological
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   His wife and two daughters, Loreen Arbus and Maxine Goldenson,
both of whom became television producers, survive him, as does one
grandson.
</P>
<P>
   For all his power, Goldenson seldom stood on ceremony; Arledge
remembers seeing him at a party in about 1960, surrounded by
advertisers and clad in blue jeans.
</P>
<P>
   Koppel said, ``I don't think he ever drove a late model car,''
and added, ``Leonard would fly tourist. Leonard was the guy who
rode in the back of the bus. The other executives would fly first
class _ until they found out Leonard was flying tourist.''

<P>
   Errol Morris has a deserved reputation for reinventing the
documentary form into something more self-consciously artistic. But
his basic schtick _ disorienting stock changes, repetitive staged
shots set to mesmerizing music, a predilection for oddball subjects
_ is getting rather tedious.
</P>
<P>
   Combine that with an individual who, to put it mildly, did not
need to have a movie made about him, and you've got the strange
case of ``Mr. Death: The Rise and Fall of Fred A. Leuchter, Jr.'' A
character worthy, perhaps, of a TV newsmagazine segment (Leuchter
was, in fact, profiled on ``PrimeTime Live'' and was originally
considered by Morris for his last compilation of eccentric
obsessives, ``Fast, Cheap and Out of Control''), Leuchter is an
execution wonk who made a big mistake. And when your purpose in
life is building better killing machines, the mistake threshold is
a pretty severe one.
</P>
<P>
   A rodentlike little man who wears big glasses and ugly ties,
Leuchter spends the first part of the movie speaking
matter-of-factly about developing ``non-torturing'' execution
devices in a serious Boston accent. The son of a prison worker, he
had been fascinated by the penal killing field since childhood, and
although he never studied engineering, his singular devotion to
building better deathtraps won him contracts with a number of state
prison systems.
</P>
<P>
   But while his desire to facilitate humane executions appears
sincere enough, his under-educated but overweening ego proved
Leuchter's downfall. Sought out by a Canadian neo-Nazi on trial for
disseminating hate literature, ``expert'' Leuchter flew to
Auschwitz (on his honeymoon, no less) to illegally collect samples
from the gas chamber ruins. A bad chemical analysis resulted in
false evidence that made up the infamous ``Leuchter Report,'' which
Holocaust deniers have tried to exploit ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Morris gives us endless, artsy footage of Leuchter (or someone
like him) chiseling away at the Auschwitz walls (or something like
them). The intended effect, I guess, is to show us the misguided
effort that went into the despicable report, but it rather
inadvertently also gives the impression that Leuchter was a
conscientious, hard-working researcher. Ditto the more interesting
but highly questionable footage of Leuchter defending his work; his
efforts genuinely seem to spring from stubbornness rather than
prejudice, but his clueless self-justifications make him look like
a victim as often as a fool.
</P>
<P>
   Morris apparently feels that Leuchter represents the archetypal,
banality-of-evil potential that supposedly resides within us all.
But the fact is that this fellow was deeply peculiar from the
start, the product of one warped system of state-sanctioned murder
who, however subconsciously, wound up trying to excuse an
infinitely more heinous one. It's a cautionary story, all right,
but who exactly might want to follow in Mr. Death's uniquely
crooked footsteps? &QL;

HABITAT IN DETROIT SEEKS TO FORECLOSE ON DELINQUENT HOME
RECIPIENTS 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Mich., Ga.)  (jw) 
 By ROBYN MEREDITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Habitat for Humanity, the organization that gathers
volunteers to hammer together houses for poor families, is
preparing to foreclose on as many as 14 of the 70 families it has
housed here.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of these folks are seriously delinquent _ any bank would
have had these people on the street months and months ago,'' said
Robert Arcand, executive director of Habitat for Humanity Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Habitat is known less as a lender than as a home builder. The
nonprofit organization buys wood, bricks and other supplies, then
organizes volunteers who join a family in constructing a modest
house. Habitat then gives the family a loan without interest for up
to 30 years to pay for the building materials and uses the monthly
payments to build more houses in the area.
</P>
<P>
   The Detroit Habitat office has sent legal notices to the 14
families, beginning foreclosure proceedings against them, Arcand
said. The foreclosures were first reported Monday in The Detroit
News.
</P>
<P>
   In Detroit, a fifth of the 70 Habitat homeowners are behind in
their payments, and one never paid at all, said Kenneth Bensen,
president of the board of Michigan Habitat for Humanity.
</P>
<P>
   Habitat builds about 300 houses a year statewide, but last year
built just nine in Detroit, the nation's poorest big city. ``We're
building more in Grand Rapids and Kalamazoo,'' Bensen said.
</P>
<P>
   But Arcand, who wants the money so the organization can build
more houses in Detroit, said the 14 families were not the only ones
to blame.
</P>
<P>
   For two years after the last executive director quit, Habitat's
Detroit office was run by a secretary and a bookkeeper with some
help from volunteers. When people fell behind on their loans, or
simply failed to make monthly payments, not much happened. Word
spread, and more Habitat families took advantage of free housing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We erred too frequently on the side of compassion and
sensitivity in the past, and we've got to take steps to rectify
it,'' said Arcand, who joined in January and has been trying to
rebuild the Detroit office. ``We had to put the brakes on.''
</P>
<P>
   Going easy on the recipients hurts them in the long run, said
Bensen, a former member of Habitat's Detroit board.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some responsibility that rests on both sides,'' he
said. ``Part of it is that our board did not go and ask for the
money and allowed them to get too far in the hole.''
</P>
<P>
   The large number of foreclosure cases here is unusual for
Habitat for Humanity, said Dennis Bender, a spokesman for Habitat
for Humanity International, based in Americus, Ga. Nationwide,
Habitat forecloses on just 1 percent of the loans it makes, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very unusual to have something like this,'' Bender said.
``It is our desire to provide homes, not to remove people from ones
they have been living in.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, the Detroit action is justified. ``It is unfair
to people who are waiting for future homes to not have the
repayment cycle,'' Bender said.
</P>
<P>
   Habitat typically builds 1,100-square-foot, three-bedroom
houses, with an average market value in Michigan of $65,000, Bensen
said. The families, after helping build their homes, pay mortgages
that cover construction costs _ about $42,500. Monthly payments are
roughly $400, and cover both the mortgage and taxes, Bensen said.
</P>
<P>
   To qualify for a Habitat house in Detroit, the family's income
must be less than 80 percent of the city's median household income.
In Detroit, families could earn up to $14,994 a year to qualify for
a home.
</P>
<P>
   Having built just 70 houses in the past 13 years, the Detroit
branch of Habitat is planning to build 50 next year, and, with
enough donations, work its way up to 150 homes a year three years
from now, Arcand said.

`THE HURRICANE' NOT BOXED IN BY PREDICTABLE PLOT

<P>
   Even though it telegraphs its punches at almost every turn,
``The Hurricane'' manages to score a cinematic victory (albeit, one
short of a knockout) with the one-two punch of its sensational
story and the outstanding acting of Denzel Washington. In bringing
the saga of boxer Rubin ``Hurricane'' Carter to the big screen,
director Norman Jewison has fashioned an old-fashioned civil rights
story invery much the same activist spirit as a couple of his other
movies: ``In the Heat of the Night'' and ``A Soldier's Story.''
</P>
<P>
   Like its predecessors, ``The Hurricane'' is a solidly crafted
effort that waves its crusading flag a bit too often for its own
good. The film often feels like a collection of bits and pieces
from other films _ prison movies, courtroom sagas and dramas of the
downtrodden _ but the force of Washington's performance largely
renders such quibbling irrelevant. This movie works, and if its
plot mechanics are a tad predictable, it certainly doesn't make the
audience's teary-eyed response any less meaningful.
</P>
<P>
   Carter's plight was a cause celebre in the 1970s; Bob Dylan
wrote a song about him and made it the centerpiece of a tour. A
middleweight boxer with enough talent to win the title, Carter was
arrested (along with a companion) and convicted of murdering three
people in a 1966 shooting. The evidence was entirely
circumstantial, and the damning testimony came from sources whose
credibility was open to question.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Carter was found guilty by an all-white jury,
largely (according to the film) because of a vendetta waged by a
racist New Jersey police detective (Dan Hedeya) who had nursed a
grudge against Carter for many years. While in prison, Carter
determined that he would live solely in his mind and spirit. In a
crucial act that ultimately helped determine his fate, Carter wrote
his autobiography, hoping that someone would take notice of the
injustice of his condition.
</P>
<P>
   Someone _ a most unlikely someone _ did. Years after it was
written, an African-American youth named Lesra (Vicellous Reon
Shannon) bought Carter's book for a quarter at a library sale. It
was the first book Lesra had ever bought, and he devoured it,
relating to Carter's struggle to achieve his dreams and maintain
his dignity. Brought up by poor, illiterate parents, Lesra was
living in Canada with three white activists (John Hannah, Deborah
Kara Unger and Liev Schreiber) who he ultimately convinces to take
up Carter's cause.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between Carter and Lesra, beginning with
letters and advancing to prison visits, forms the emotional thrust
of the story, and, indeed, is one of the movie's strong suits. The
three Canadians (a distillation of nine actual people who worked on
Carter's case) never quite become distinct characters, though,
existing mostly to move the story along.
</P>
<P>
   But the story, which is fairly faithfully told, is an engrossing
one, even when it is sometimes forced to focus on minutiae to
explain the specifics of Carter's legal maneuverings. Washington's
forceful performance is one of the year's best, delivering a
complex portrait of a man who is both heroic and human.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is completely convincing in every aspect of the role,
including the film's boxing scenes. If he does not earn at least an
Oscar nomination, it will be an injustice, although a minor one
compared to the injuries suffered by the man he so movingly
portrays in ``The Hurricane.'' &QL;

PEACE CORPS TAKES STEPS ON YEAR 2000

   WASHINGTON _ The Peace Corps has urged some volunteers to return
home for the holidays and is moving others to safer locations,
among a series of precautionary measures for the New Year,
officials of the organization said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The exact impact of the New Year holiday on more than 7,000
volunteers in 78 countries around the world is uncertain, but Peace
Corps directors in each country are working with volunteers, local
governments and host-country staff members to minimize potential
disruptions and ensure personal safety.
</P>
<P>
   In some countries, officials have warned, serious computer
problems associated with the rollover to the year 2000 could cut
off food supplies, electricity, transportation and telephone
services. The Peace Corps has encouraged volunteers in these areas
to spend vacation time in the United States, said Dana Topousis, an
organization spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers in Belize, Madagascar, Moldova, Mozambique, Slovakia,
Zambia and Zimbabwe are expected to leave their sites; others in
Jamaica, Nepal and Papua New Guinea may also relocate.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Topousis said the Peace Corps had also been monitoring those
countries for which the State Department had issued travel alerts.
The department released what it called a ``worldwide terrorism
warning'' advising Americans to stay away from ``large gatherings
and celebrations'' throughout the world, and also warned against
travel to specific regions, like the Khyber Pass between Pakistan
and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Peace Corps directors in each country drew up plans for
volunteers in the field, Ms. Topousis said. In some cases,
volunteers will remain at their sites. Volunteers in large
countries, like Russia, will congregate in small groups at larger
regional centers. In smaller countries, volunteers and Peace Corps
staff members will gather in capital cities.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers have received a checklist for the country where they
are serving, with an emergency action plan. And in a few countries
with severe weather concerns, volunteers will receive emergency
kits, with sleeping bags, flashlights, batteries, extra clothing,
additional medical supplies and food items.
</P>
<P>
   Most Peace Corps headquarters are equipped with generators in
case of the loss of electricity, but in some countries in Eastern
Europe, West Africa and South America, satellite telephones have
also been provided.
</P>
<P>
   Roslyn Docktor, the year 2000 director for the Peace Corps, said
the organization had begun preparations in the spring of 1997,
sending surveys to country directors to learn about their concerns.
Peace Corps officials at headquarters in each country, for example,
considered whether rural or urban locations were at greater risk.
The most important issue, Ms. Docktor said, is that organization
officials are able to contact volunteers at all times.
</P>
<P>
   ``The directors must be as informed as they can be about risks
in their countries,'' Ms. Docktor said.
</P>
<P>
   She said extensive work that the organization had done through
the years in countries with developmental problems afforded the
organization a unique advantage for handling challenges that the
new year might pose. The Peace Corps, she added, has set up an
operations center to answer questions from families and friends of
volunteers.

HOW THE WORLD ENDS IS A MATTER OF FAITH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By D. PARVAZ  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   You probably want to know when and how the world's going to end,
right?
</P>
<P>
   As you must suspect, there is no definitive answer.
</P>
<P>
   For some, the details of The End depend on religious faith and
the calendar, but there are plenty of faiths and calendars to
choose from.
</P>
<P>
   What follows are general interpretations of the end of the world
_ at least as we know it _ in the classical texts of the world's
major faiths. To further complicate things, not all people
belonging to these faiths interpret the texts in the same way.
</P>
<P>
   The Second Coming,
</P>
<P>
   disasters and
</P>
<P>
   general chaos
</P>
<P>
   Most monotheistic or single-God religions _ the major ones being
Christianity, Islam and Judaism _ have a linear theory of time.
</P>
<P>
   There's a beginning and an end, and the end usually ain't
pretty.
</P>
<P>
   More often than not, it involves a battle between divine and
demonic principles, says Martin Jaffee, chair of the Comparative
Religion Program at the University of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   These religions have other similarities, including redemption
for the pious. Jaffee says there are usually long stretches of time
during which the devout work for their redemption. That, he says,
is the reward of the righteous.
</P>
<P>
   Also, these religions tend to have a sense of Judgment Day _ a
nasty, doomsday end followed by God's judgment of all people and
then a heaven/hell scenario.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all,'' Jaffee says, ``part of the thrill of redemption
is seeing your persecutors punished.''
</P>
<P>
   Christianity _ Millions of Christians worldwide look to the
start of the new millennium as a spiritually significant day. Some
interpretations of the Bible hold it as the day when the prophecies
in the Book of Revelation begin to come true.
</P>
<P>
   For other Christians, the day may signify the start of the
events leading to the Second Coming.
</P>
<P>
   Interpretations of Biblical predictions vary greatly among
scholars and churches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many scholars believe that many of the events have already
taken place _ like the 1879 destruction of Jerusalem, which was
predicted in the scriptures,'' says Pastor Fred Kropp of the City
Church, a non-denominational Christian church in Kirkland.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the signs of the Last Day in the Book of Revelation
include:
</P>
<P>
   _Harsh weather changes.
</P>
<P>
   _False messiahs appearing around the world.
</P>
<P>
   _Global persecution of Christians.
</P>
<P>
   _The mark of the beast (Satan) appears in world commerce. Some
believers have held that bar codes, ATM cards and credit cards are
all part of Satan's scheme to force his mark on people.
</P>
<P>
   _Drought and famine.
</P>
<P>
   _The Antichrist returns as the false messiah. Adolf Hitler,
Mikhail Gorbachev and Sadam Hussein all have been labeled as
Antichrist figures.
</P>
<P>
   _A great war _ possibly World War III _ breaks out.
</P>
<P>
   Kropp explains that the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse bring
with them a seven-year period of chaos and destruction otherwise
known as the tribulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, every major catastrophe will take place,'' says
Kropp, who rattles off a list of disasters that includes war,
disease, famine, drought, earthquakes and the implosion of the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the question of when the Rapture will happen. The
Rapture _ not referred to in the Bible by that term _ is when
Christ takes Christian souls to heaven without them dying. These
people will just disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Some hold that the rapture will happen before the tribulation,
some think during, others think after.
</P>
<P>
   As as for when these things will happen, Kropp says the Bible is
pretty clear _ only God knows when the end of the world will come.
</P>
<P>
   Judaism _ Judaism has the least harsh version of how things will
end. In fact, you can't really qualify it as an end, because
according to the scriptures, things continue on. One way of living
ends, another begins.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi David Fine of the Jewish Education Council locally says
Jews believe that at a certain point in time, the Messianic Age
will come. This may or may not correlate with the end of the Jewish
calendar, due in about 2,240 years.
</P>
<P>
   Some Jews see the age as an actual period during which a messiah
_ a political figure rather than a savior of souls _ will restore
the Davidian Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   How do we know when the Messianic Age has arrived? ``When the
hearts of parents will be turned towards their children and when
the hearts of children will turn towards the parents,'' says Fine,
quoting Judaic scriptures.
</P>
<P>
   The signs of the impending Messianic age are fairly general _ no
demons, no fire, no brimstone. ``The Jewish idea of the Messianic
Age is the age of peace. It's not an apocalypse,'' Fine says.
</P>
<P>
   The Jewish notion of the end of this world also includes an
afterlife, but it's unique in that it entails bringing the dead
back to this world.
</P>
<P>
   There is no final Judgment Day in the Jewish faith, Fine says.
Instead, Jews believe that they are being judged every day.
</P>
<P>
   As for heaven and hell, well, that's not so clear either.
``That's one of the mysteries. What happens after we die? We don't
know,'' Fine says.
</P>
<P>
   Islam: Unlike some other religions, Muslims believe that what is
in their holy book, the Koran, is not up for interpretation. ``We
don't have that luxury,'' says Abdul-Latif of the Islamic
Information Center of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   As for when the world will end, Abdul-Latif quotes the Koran,
``The knowledge of the hour is with Allah alone.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Mohammed reveals the signs of ``the hour'' _ or the end
of the world _ to the angel Gabriel as follows (in no particular
order):
</P>
<P>
   _The False Christ will appear in the form of a Jew named
Abdulah. He will have one bulging blind eye, will be heavy-set and
will perform acts that non-Muslims will view as miracles _
resurrect the dead, grow crops from barren lands, etc.
</P>
<P>
   _The beast (Satan) will appear.
</P>
<P>
   _Shi'ite Muslims believe that the 12th imam (prophet), Mahdi,
will return just before Issah (Jesus) and lead Muslims in prayer.
</P>
<P>
   _Jesus will appear in Syria wearing a saffron yellow robe. He
will follow the Koran and the words of the Mohammed. ``He will
marry, have children and die like a real human being,'' Abdul-Latif
says.
</P>
<P>
   _Gog and Magog _ a massive, ruthless tribe _ will finally scale
the wall built to fence them in. They will swarm the earth,
pillaging and looting
</P>
<P>
   _The sun will set, then rise from the west; a fire will start in
the Middle East that will force people to move and gather in one
place. There will be a great deal of killing and general moral
decline.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there will be The Big War between the Jews and Muslims,
who will be joined by the Christian army. Then Allah will send a
wind and sweep up all the souls of true Muslims and take them to
heaven.
</P>
<P>
   ``We firmly believe that whoever among the people heard about
Allah and Mohammed and didn't believe in them will die as a
disbeliever, will burn in hell,'' Abdul-Latif says. But before
that, the souls remaining on Earth will be consumed by powerful
earthquakes, mayhem and what the Koran refers to as ``the snorting
of war steeds.''
</P>
<P>
   Cycles of rebirth
</P>
<P>
   The two major world religions with cyclical concept of time _
Hinduism and Buddhism _ stand as total opposites in every way to
the single-God religions in their views on the apocalypse.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, the end is never really the end _ it is the end of
a cycle and the start of another. Therefore, there is no afterlife,
heaven or hell.
</P>
<P>
   Hinduism: Hindu apocalyptic theory involves the trinity of
Brahma, the creator; Vishnu, the preserver; and Shiva, the
destroyer.
</P>
<P>
   Most Hindus believe in reincarnation, so time is cyclical, with
each cycle slightly shorter and darker that the last. The final
major cycle, known as the Kali Yuga will be 432,000 years long, all
the cycles put together will last 4,320,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Kali Yuga already has begun _ it started in 3012 B.C., so it
doesn't look like Hindus are expecting the end of the world anytime
soon.
</P>
<P>
   The events leading up to the end may start in 2003, when
Krishna's incarnation comes to enforce the reign of righteousness.
</P>
<P>
   When the end comes, you can expect Vishnu's final incarnation
descending from the open sky. All evil is destroyed, purity
restored and things begin anew when a lotus grows out of Vishnu's
navel and from it, Brahma appears to start the cycle of creation
once again.
</P>
<P>
   Buddhism: The Buddhist theory of time is also cyclical. The path
of events follows the Kalachakra, or wheel of time.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Jendy Shih, a Buddhist nun for 20 years and a teacher at
the American Evergreen Buddhist Association in Kirkland, says the
end of this cycle will come approximately 5,760,000,000 years after
the Buddha completed his teachings, which was about 2,500 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk about how the world comes to exist, how it
deteriorates and dissolves. Then the end will come and then the
beginning,'' Shih says. The deterioration has little to do with
disasters and more with spiritual deterioration.
</P>
<P>
   However, contrary to the single-God religions mentioned earlier,
Buddhist theory holds that as time goes on, the deterioration
eventually bottoms out and things get better, with Earth eventually
resembling paradise. There will be no shortage of food and people
will be leading angst-free lives.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem odd that the Buddha should appear to start the cycle
over just as things are going so well, but Shih says Buddhists have
faith in the Buddha's wisdom.

PEACE CORPS TAKES STEPS ON YEAR 2000

   WASHINGTON _ The Peace Corps has urged some volunteers to return
home for the holidays and is moving others to safer locations,
among a series of precautionary measures for the New Year,
officials of the organization said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The exact impact of the New Year holiday on more than 7,000
volunteers in 78 countries around the world is uncertain, but Peace
Corps directors in each country are working with volunteers, local
governments and host-country staff members to minimize potential
disruptions and ensure personal safety.
</P>
<P>
   In some countries, officials have warned, serious computer
problems associated with the rollover to the year 2000 could cut
off food supplies, electricity, transportation and telephone
services. The Peace Corps has encouraged volunteers in these areas
to spend vacation time in the United States, said Dana Topousis, an
organization spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers in Belize, Madagascar, Moldova, Mozambique, Slovakia,
Zambia and Zimbabwe are expected to leave their sites; others in
Jamaica, Nepal and Papua New Guinea may also relocate.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Topousis said the Peace Corps had also been monitoring those
countries for which the State Department had issued travel alerts.
The department released what it called a ``worldwide terrorism
warning'' advising Americans to stay away from ``large gatherings
and celebrations'' throughout the world, and also warned against
travel to specific regions, like the Khyber Pass between Pakistan
and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Peace Corps directors in each country drew up plans for
volunteers in the field, Ms. Topousis said. In some cases,
volunteers will remain at their sites. Volunteers in large
countries, like Russia, will congregate in small groups at larger
regional centers. In smaller countries, volunteers and Peace Corps
staff members will gather in capital cities.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers have received a checklist for the country where they
are serving, with an emergency action plan. And in a few countries
with severe weather concerns, volunteers will receive emergency
kits, with sleeping bags, flashlights, batteries, extra clothing,
additional medical supplies and food items.
</P>
<P>
   Most Peace Corps headquarters are equipped with generators in
case of the loss of electricity, but in some countries in Eastern
Europe, West Africa and South America, satellite telephones have
also been provided.
</P>
<P>
   Roslyn Docktor, the year 2000 director for the Peace Corps, said
the organization had begun preparations in the spring of 1997,
sending surveys to country directors to learn about their concerns.
Peace Corps officials at headquarters in each country, for example,
considered whether rural or urban locations were at greater risk.
The most important issue, Ms. Docktor said, is that organization
officials are able to contact volunteers at all times.
</P>
<P>
   ``The directors must be as informed as they can be about risks
in their countries,'' Ms. Docktor said.
</P>
<P>
   She said extensive work that the organization had done through
the years in countries with developmental problems afforded the
organization a unique advantage for handling challenges that the
new year might pose. The Peace Corps, she added, has set up an
operations center to answer questions from families and friends of
volunteers.

SOME DOOMSDAY FALSE ALARMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This new millennium thing isn't the first time some people
thought the world was going to end. History is littered with failed
prophecies and false alarms.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a short list from the past 1,000 years:
</P>
<P>
   999: Christians aware of the calendar count that began with the
birth of Jesus believe the Second Coming will occur at the end of
the first millennium.
</P>
<P>
   1891: In 1835, Mormon leader Joseph Smith predicted the Coming
of the Lord 56 years later.
</P>
<P>
   March 21, 1843, to March 21, 1844: Led by William Miller, the
Millerites, a sect of more than 50,000 based mostly in
Massachusetts and New York, abandon their material possessions and
take to the hills, where they wait for the world to end.
</P>
<P>
   1844: Again the Millerites wait for Armageddon. Miller sets the
date as Oct. 22. The apocalpytic no-show is dubbed ``The Great
Disappointment.''
</P>
<P>
   1914: Jehovah's Witnesses (an offshoot of the Seventh-Day
Adventists, who are an offshoot of the Millerites) await the Second
Coming. They believe Christ returned in 1884 but chose to remain
invisible.
</P>
<P>
   April 22, 1959: In Texas, the Branch Davidians believe they will
be killed and resurrected.
</P>
<P>
   1975: Word of the impending apocalypse spreads through the
Jehovah's Witness membership, though the church never confirms the
prediction.
</P>
<P>
   1984: The Jehovah's Witnesses suffer another unfulfilled
prophecy of doom.
</P>
<P>
   Oct. 2, 1985: The Jesus of Burien (a k a William E. Peterson)
claims Armageddon came on this day and he is already well into his
reign as Christ returned.
</P>
<P>
   April 19, 1993: The Branch Davidians, now led by David Koresh,
think the world will end this year. The cult's standoff with
government agents ends in a fiery tragedy, resulting in 80 deaths.
</P>
<P>
   March 26, 1997: The Heaven's Gate cult carries out a mass
suicide. The 39 members believe that hidden in the tail of comet
Hale-Bopp is some sort of self-aware life form coming to prepare us
for what they call a ``galactic evolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Oct. 23, 1997: Archbishop Ussher, a 17th-century archbishop of
Armagh in Ireland, calculated that God created the world on Oct.
23, 4004 B.C., and that the end of the world would come on this
date 6,000 years later.
</P>
<P>
   March 31, 1998: A Taiwanese UFO cult, Chen Tao, anticipates
God's return _ in human form _ in Garland, Texas. The leader,
Hon-Ming Chen, claims the Lord's return will set off a series of
events leading to the world's end in August 1999.
</P>
<P>
   September 1999: Nostradamus' prophecies include a meteor hitting
the Earth sometime this month, _ according to those who translated
his predictions to our current calendar _ setting off a chain of
disasters (earthquakes, hurricanes, famine, etc.) leading to the
end of the world.
</P>
<P>
   September 1999: Shoko Asahara, leader of the Japanese Aum
Shinrikyo cult, predicts the world's end this month.

`THIRD MIRACLE' A GRITTY EXAMINATION OF FAITH
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: EMBARGOED until Wednesday, Dec. 29. Fact box below) 
Our rating: 3 stars 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   An absorbing film about faith and fallibility, ``The Third
Miracle'' takes an honest look at supernatural occurrences, a
subject that Hollywood typically regards with either sarcasm or
pea-soup-style fantasy horror.
</P>
<P>
   Here, in a gritty style that won't remind anybody of Frank
Capra, director Agnieszka Holland (``Europa, Europa'') investigates
miracles without a trace of condescension, which makes this movie a
pretty divine occurrence in this time of ``Stigmata''-style
filmmaking.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Harris stars as Father Frank Shore, known in Catholic circles
as ``the miracle killer.'' Frank works as a postulator, a
church-appointed investigator who examines miracles and saints in
much the same way a police detective looks into a crime scene. When
we first meet Frank, he is living in one of the seedier sections of
Chicago, having disappeared from church circles for eight months.
Frank is wrestling with doubts, both with his job (his last
investigation ``destroyed the faith of an entire community'') and
his God.
</P>
<P>
   Frank reluctantly agrees to study a series of mystical phenomena
said to be occurring around a deceased immigrant woman who was a
member of an inner-city Chicago parish. Healings are claimed to
have happened in her name and a statue of Mary outside the church
is said to cry tears of blood when it rains. For Father Frank, this
is just another false alarm needing to be debunked. He doesn't even
bother to open the thick file the bishop gives him.
</P>
<P>
   But a funny thing happens to Frank. As he further opens his
heart to doubt and questions, his capacity to believe begins to
soar. This process is aided interestingly enough by his
relationship with the immigrant woman's daughter, Roxanna (Anne
Heche), a fiery non-believer still hurt by her mother's decision to
abandon her when she turned 16 in order to more fully serve the
church. Roxanna's earthiness captivates Frank and causes him to
doubt his calling even more. But she also forces him to think
through his beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Third Miracle'' takes its title from the Vatican's
requirement that a candidate for sainthood be recognized for three
miracles. (That standard has been reduced to two since the film's
source material, Richard Vetere's novel, was written.) The film
poses more questions than answers, and leaves the validity of its
quite literal supernatural occurrences open to various
interpretations.
</P>
<P>
   But the movie's message about faith is clear, showing that it's
a personal journey, one that often resists intellectualization.
Father Frank's search for a third miracle comes up empty in one
sense. But in another, and perhaps more important way, his journey
becomes a heavenly pilgrimage, reawakening his capacity for wonder
and reestablishing his connection with God.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, always outstanding when given a good script, makes for
one of the more compelling men of the cloth in recent memory,
fleshing out a priest who is strong, smart and _ get this _
sensual. Frank drinks, shouts and struggles with God and with his
vow of chastity. Heche makes a fine enchantress as Roxanna, a
complex woman who understands Frank in ways that go deeper than
they initially understand.
</P>
<P>
   The performances and thought-provoking story make ``The Third
Miracle'' a richly rewarding film, both for its intelligence and
its willingness to discuss matters of faith. Seeing, in this case,
will make you a believer. &QL;

SOME DIZZYING SCENARIOS AMONG NFL PLAYOFF HOPEFULS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This morning some coaches around the National Football League
woke up from their two hours of sleep, gulped their cafe latte and
broke out the calculators. If it's late December, it must be time
for playoff possibilities. Oh, those dizzying and annoying
postseason scenarios.
</P>
<P>
   The quality of the play in the NFL has taken several steps back,
mostly because of expansion diluting the talent pool. The league
has average teams falling apart at the finish line instead of
fighting valiantly for a postseason spot.
</P>
<P>
   In the National Football Conference, four 7-8 teams are
scrambling for the playoffs. This isn't parity so much as it is
survival of the least fit. Which team from that second tier of
playoff hopefuls _ Dallas, the New York Giants, Carolina and Green
Bay _ deserves to get in? None have earned a playoff paycheck. But
some say that isn't the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get in people are going to say we don't deserve it,''
Giants safety Percy Ellsworth said. ``But look around the league.
There are a lot of mediocre teams. Does Dallas deserve to get in
over us? They lost to New Orleans. Does Green Bay? No, they're not
that good. Does Carolina? Does Detroit? A lot of teams are
struggling. That's just the way the NFL is now.''
</P>
<P>
   Even good teams are having problems. Jacksonville was beaten
badly by Tennessee on Sunday, 41-14, meaning the Jaguars have lost
to the Titans twice this season. Washington won the NFC East, but
was unimpressive against a bad San Francisco team on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   What does this all mean?
</P>
<P>
   It means pass the coffee and call the math professor.
</P>
<P>
   AFC EAST
</P>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS: The Colts have clinched the division and a
first-round bye. They can clinch home-field advantage throughout
the playoffs with either a victory at Buffalo, a Jacksonville loss
or a tie against Cincinnati, or by beating the Jaguars in net
points in conference games. They can also clinch home-field
advantage with a Jacksonville loss and a Tennessee loss at
Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars will probably hold on, barely, and get home-field
advantage, but the sprained knee of quarterback Mark Brunell is
making the team nervous. He will miss this week's game. The Colts
are still the best team in the conference.
</P>
<P>
   BUFFALO: The Bills can clinch a playoff berth with either a
victory or tie in their home game against the Colts, or if Miami
lost to the Jets Monday night, a Seattle loss or tie to the Jets or
a Kansas City loss or tie to Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   The Bills are playing fairly well, especially the defense. They
could be dangerous in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   MIAMI: The Dolphins could get in with either two victories or a
victory against the Jets (Monday night) and either a Buffalo
victory or a Chiefs loss or tie or a Seattle loss or tie. There are
other scenarios, but Miami has a tough road.
</P>
<P>
   AFC CENTRAL
</P>
<P>
   The most interesting aspect of Jacksonville and Tennessee making
the playoffs is that both will probably meet in a later round. The
Titans have beaten Jacksonville twice. How will that affect the
Jaguars' psyche?
</P>
<P>
   AFC WEST
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE: The Seahawks can clinch the division with either a
victory or a Kansas City loss or tie. They can get into the
playoffs with a tie and two Miami losses. Seattle is fragile. If
they do get in, and that's probable, the Seahawks won't go far.
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY: The Chiefs can still make the postseason, even win
the division, but they need a lot of help for both.
</P>
<P>
   NFC EAST
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON: The Redskins won probably the weakest division in
the NFL. Offensively, they're solid. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DALLAS: If the Cowboys beat the Giants, they are in. But last
Friday's loss to the Saints was one of the most embarrassing for
the organization this decade.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: At first glance it seems they have a decent chance to
get in. But that is not so. One part of the Giants' equation is
that they need Arizona to beat Green Bay, but the Cardinals are
terrible in cold weather, and the game is at Lambeau Field. New
York has only a 30 percent chance of making it.
</P>
<P>
   NFC CENTRAL
</P>
<P>
   TAMPA BAY: In and dangerous because of a great defense, but with
a rookie quarterback in Shaun King, it will be difficult to win the
conference championship.
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA: Coach Denny Green has done some smart coaching, such
as calling for the Randy Moss pass play to Cris Carter for a
touchdown against the Giants. They're in and are the team no one
wants to play. Green has coached the Vikings to seven playoff
appearances in his eight years as head coach.
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT: The Lions backed into the postseason after three
straight losses. They are destined to lose in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   GREEN BAY: Still alive, but the Packers are no threat if they
get in.
</P>
<P>
   NFC WEST
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS: The Rams have home-field advantage throughout the
playoffs, and will be almost impossible to beat because they are
remarkably fast and all of their playoff games will be on the fast
artificial turf.
</P>
<P>
   CAROLINA: A long shot to make the playoffs.

A LOOK AT THE TOP 10 MOMENTS OF THE CENTURY IN TELEVISION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   1939: In April, regularly scheduled network TV is born when NBC
airs President Franklin D. Roosevelt's speech at the opening of the
New York World's Fair. With few people able to afford a TV set, the
event is hardly a ratings blockbuster.
</P>
<P>
   1947: NBC's first broadcast of baseball's World Series draws a
large audience and overnight turns the sport into ``America's
pastime.'' Even more significantly, it starts a run on TV sets,
which until then were never expected to supplant radio. Today, the
average American family owns three TV sets.
</P>
<P>
   1960: The televised presidential debate between Richard Nixon
and John F. Kennedy illustrates the power of image. Viewers watch
as a sweaty Nixon looks pale and inexperienced next to the calm,
good-looking Kennedy. Candidates begin to respect TV's power.
</P>
<P>
   1963: John F. Kennedy's assassination is massively covered by
network television, becoming the first major breaking TV news
tragedy. Blanket coverage is now a staple of television news, and
with so many channels and so little news, the events deemed worthy
of such coverage are of much less significance than the murder of a
president.
</P>
<P>
   1968: Dressed in flak jackets and military helmets, Walter
Cronkite and other TV journalists file nightly dispatches from the
front lines of the Vietnam War, bringing home the horror while
helping shift public sentiment against America's involvement.
</P>
<P>
   1970: Phil Donahue debuts with a daytime show on which everyday
people discuss everyday topics, and the talk show genre is born.
The success of ``Donahue'' makes room for Oprah Winfrey, who takes
her Chicago-based talk show national. Later, however, the genre is
severely exploited, morphing into ``trash'' TV talk shows with
hosts like Geraldo Rivera, whose chair-throwing exhibitions
precedes an even sleazier profit-monger named Jerry Springer, a
former Cincinnati mayor.
</P>
<P>
   1970s: ``M-A-S-H,'' ``Maude,'' ``All in the Family'' and
``Sanford &AMP; Son'' usher in a new kind of situation comedy built
around red-flag issues such as interfaith marriage, abortion and
war. These open the door for variety shows such as ``Saturday Night
Live'' to delve into political satire. Comedy would diminish in the
late '70s and early '80s, only to be revived by ``The Cosby Show''
in 1984. Now the cycle has dipped again, with sitcoms attracting
fewer viewers than ever.
</P>
<P>
   1980: On Nov. 21, more than 80 million viewers tune in to see
who shot ruthless character J.R. Ewing in the prime-time soap
``Dallas.'' Producers have been trying to duplicate such dramatic
suspense since then, with cliffhangers and special episodes of
drama on sitcoms. But with today's fragmented audience, the
top-rated program on TV, ``ER,'' tops out at 35 million viewers.
</P>
<P>
   1980s: Cable slowly but successfully becomes an alternative to
network television. But it also eliminates the universal language
of TV. Now everyone's speaking a different tongue: kids, blacks,
Hispanics, computer geeks, Martha Stewart wannabes.
</P>
<P>
   1997: Billions of viewers around the world watch Princess
Diana's funeral. It helps Elton John's eulogy song top ``White
Christmas'' as the all-time bestseller and, more significantly,
illustrates how the medium few believed in at first is now a
trusted, ubiquitous presence.

MEET MONICA LEWINSKY, DIET PLAN SPOKESWOMAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (Advertising Column) 
(sw) 
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ First it was a White House internship. Then a job
with Revlon that never materialized. Earlier this year, she started
a pocketbook-making business. Now, Monica Lewinsky, the woman known
for her relationship with President Clinton, is marching down yet
another professional path: as a television pitchwoman for a diet
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Sunday, Ms. Lewinsky's very familiar face and form will
appear in commercials for Jenny Craig Inc., the diet company, as
part of a $7.2 million advertising campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The commercials, which are also her first national television
forays since a March interview with Barbara Walters, will air that
day during the Brian Boitano Holiday Skating Spectacular on NBC,
and will be shown subsequently during daytime talk shows like
``Oprah'' and ``The Rosie O'Donnell Show.'' The campaign, which
includes cable television and Internet ads, will run at least
through March.
</P>
<P>
   In taking this step, Ms. Lewinsky appears to be following the
example of Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, who sought a kind
of public redemption and financial redress through a similar
arrangement with Weight Watchers, another diet program.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after her divorce from Prince Andrew, the duchess signed
a lucrative deal with Weight Watchers International, then a unit of
the H.J. Heinz Co., to appear on television and in print ads for
the program. Heinz has since sold the Weight Watchers instruction
business to a unit of Artal Luxembourg S.A., although it continues
to make and sell Weight Watchers food products.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether Ms. Lewinsky will give the program a
hoped-for lift or drag it down because of the negative publicity
that her presidential dalliance generated. For many Americans, the
episode marked a low point in professional and personal conduct for
everyone involved.
</P>
<P>
   In a rough cut of the Jenny Craig commercials, Ms. Lewinsky _
whose weight worries, among other things, were chronicled in
Kenneth W. Starr's report to Congress _ appears relatively
contained and confident, although there is still that breathy
teen-ager quality to her voice and manner.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a bright pink blouse as she perches on a chair in a
flower-bedecked setting that looks like it might be a bedroom, she
declares, ``I've tried every diet in the world,'' ending with a
giggle. ``I mean, if it was stand on your head, I've tried it. If
it was eat only grapefruit, I've tried it. Magic diet pills, I've
tried it.''
</P>
<P>
   She says, however, the Jenny Craig program has helped her. She
claims she has lost 31 pounds so far, and the Monica speaking does
look far more svelte than she does in the ``before'' pictures
included in the spots. Those show her watering plants in a garden,
dressed in what appears to be a truncated muumuu over slacks, and
standing at an ironing board, snipping an article of clothing with
scissors _ perhaps to let out a seam.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky was chosen as the spokeswoman for Jenny Craig
because she tried the program and it worked for her, said Linell
Killus, vice president for marketing at the publicly traded diet
company. ``She's an example of a client success story, and
obviously she's highly recognizable,'' Ms. Killus said.
</P>
<P>
   She refused to say either how much Ms. Lewinsky weighs or how
much weight she is trying to lose, citing client confidentiality
policies. ``She's someone who truly wants to change her life in a
positive way, and that's what Jenny Craig is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what was Ms. Lewinsky's appeal to Jenny Craig's target
audience, mostly women aged 25 to 54, Ms. Killus said: ``She
represents a busy active woman of today with a hectic lifestyle.
And she has had weight issues and weight struggles for a long time.
That represents a lot of women in America.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jenny Craig program emphasizes personal ``consulting,'' in
which dieters receive advice about not only what they eat, but also
how they conduct themselves in other aspects of their lives. ``It's
about creating a healthy relationship with food, creating an active
lifestyle and creating a balanced life,'' Ms. Killus said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a journey. It's not a beginning and an end. You have to
change your life and the way you lead your life in order to become
an independent weight manager.''
</P>
<P>
   The ads featuring Ms. Lewinsky promote a ``Low Carb Option,''
which the voiceover describes as ``balanced and hassle-free,''
pretty much the opposite of Ms. Lewinsky, as her own testimony
underscores, in the final days of her relationship with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Reports that Ms. Lewinsky would be paid $1 million if she lost
60 pounds could not be confirmed on Monday. Ms. Killus said she was
not aware of any such arrangement and declined to say how much Ms.
Lewinsky was being paid for her appearances
</P>
<P>
   In the commercials, Ms. Lewinsky is shown laughing as flashbulbs
go off in the background, suggesting paparazzi. ``One of the
amazing things about Jenny Craig for me is that I haven't felt
deprived on this program at all,'' she says. ``I think Jenny Craig
is a great program for someone who not only wants to lose weight
but who's looking to change their life.'' Later, she adds, ``I feel
fantastic.''
</P>
<P>
   Working with her was a good experience, said David Suissa, the
chairman and executive creative director at Suissa Miller, the Los
Angeles agency that created the ads and others over the last six
years for Jenny Craig, including a spot starring Jerry Mathers, the
star of ``Leave it to Beaver.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She's friendly,'' Suissa said. ``I think she has experience in
front of the camera.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no question about that. Ms. Lewinsky gave hours of
videotaped testimony to Kenneth W. Starr, the special prosecutor
whose investigation of her relationship with Clinton consumed the
country and the Congress for large chunks of this year and last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The release of Starr's report detailed the relationship, which
began with Ms. Lewinsky flashing a glimpse of her thong underwear
to the commander in chief during the government shutdown in 1995.
It continued for 18 months with clandestine encounters in the
vicinity of the Oval Office before the president broke it off.
</P>
<P>
   Suissa said he was under no constraints as to what he could and
could not use about Ms. Lewinsky's past in the commercials. ``We
wouldn't have done it, anyway,'' he said. ``It's too expected, to
trade on her notoriety. She's a fun, interesting person in real
life. We didn't want to get too gloomy, you know.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDELLIN, Colombia _ Some days it is hard to tell just how
profoundly this country's brutal, deepening civil conflict has
affected the University of Antioquia here. Outside the library, at
the school's main plaza, students relax in the sun, study for final
exams, play soccer or flirt with each other, just like their
counterparts anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a campus increasingly under siege by armed groups of
both the right and left. The main administration building has been
dynamited by leftist guerrillas; a respected professor, a student
leader and a popular cafeteria worker have been shot to death on
university grounds for political reasons; and a right-wing
paramilitary group has begun to operate openly and circulate a
``death list'' of future targets.
</P>
<P>
   A result is ``a state of panic and consternation'' at Antioquia,
Colombia's oldest public university, said Luis Fernando Jaramillo
Salazar, the institution's senior vice president. Things have
gotten so bad that administrators met recently with both left-wing
guerrilla leaders and the chief of the country's main right-wing
death squad to plead with them to curb their attacks and respect
the university's neutrality as a place of learning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went not to negotiate, but to express to them the notion
that a university is not a battlefield, but rather a place where
ideas compete,'' Jaramillo, a physicist, said in an interview in
his office, rebuilt after the bombing last February. ``That is
something that should be so obvious as not to have to be said, but
they insist on bringing the war here.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the university's more than 20,000 students, most of whom
come from families of limited means and shy away from politics, the
situation has bred a kind of fatalism. ``We have learned to accept
the abnormal as normal,'' said Patricia Molina, 24, a foreign
languages major, as she and three classmates took a study break at
the plaza.
</P>
<P>
   Monica Garcia, 24, a pharmacy student, said with a resigned
shrug, ``It is painful that the circumstances are what they are,
but this university is like a small city, a version of the nation
in miniature, and so you see here what you see everywhere else in
Colombia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sorry people have been killed,'' she said, ``but how can
we not be affected, how can we expect the war not to penetrate our
university?''
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the political violence has also underlined the
university's general vulnerability and its inability to fend off
other kinds of attacks. Taking their cue from the warring forces of
the right and left, criminal gangs have also invaded the campus in
the last year, robbing the university financial office and the
professors' cooperative.
</P>
<P>
   Although the death squads have claimed responsibility for the
killing last August of Gustavo Marulanda, a philosophy major and
member of the Student Council they say was a guerrilla sympathizer,
it is still not clear who shot Hernan Henao to death in his office
in May. Henao, an anthropologist, was director of the Institute of
Regional Studies and had been supervising research into the
displacement of peasants by both sets of armed groups.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Antioquia (pronounced auntie-OH-key-yah) has
lived through periods of violence in the past, most notably in the
mid-1980s, when nearly a dozen professors were killed by armed
groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the worrying difference now is that these killings have
occurred on campus, and the sanctity of the university as a center
of inquiry is no longer respected,'' Jaramillo said.
</P>
<P>
   After Marulanda was killed, the university was closed for
several days, and statements by administrators led students to fear
it would remain shut indefinitely. Instead, a plebiscite was held
in which students, teachers and other employees, as well as the
community at large, were asked whether they favored ``a University
of Antioquia that is open, functioning, pluralist and without
violence.''
</P>
<P>
   About half of those affiliated with the university and some
70,000 people from outside the university voted. The outcome,
overwhelmingly endorsing the concept of the university as ``a space
for freedom,'' seemed to invigorate the university and underline
its importance to this city of 2 million, notorious outside
Colombia for its drug cartels.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is easy to say it was just something symbolic, that it was
nothing but a publicity stunt,'' Sergio Urquijo, 19, a
communications major, said of the vote. ``But when we saw the
results, we no longer felt so isolated, and it gave us the
confidence to continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the killings, combined with the threat of new
assassinations, continue to dampen campus life. Several professors
have left the country or gone into hiding, and the Student Council
has simply vanished from sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The atmosphere of fear and insecurity has driven them away,''
said the Rev. Alvaro Velez Vazquez, the college chaplain. ``Some
student leaders have left because they are frightened, and others
have left because they were threatened, but whatever the reason,
they haven't met in a long time, or if they are still meeting at
all, it is done very discreetly and clandestinely.''
</P>
<P>
   Professors who are still teaching say the chilling effect of the
violence has also entered their classrooms. It is no longer
possible, several said, to view their students with anything but
wariness and mistrust, and office hours have become an ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try not to be too visible and to tread carefully in what
you say in class,'' said the chairman of one department, speaking
on condition of anonymity out of concern for his safety. ``You
never know how your words, even some casual comment, are going to
be interpreted and turned against you, so there are certain themes
that you no longer broach in class.''
</P>
<P>
   In an unsigned essay in the university's literary magazine, a
writer compared the current situation to finding ``strange
presences that little by little take over one's own house.''
</P>
<P>
   First the guerrillas and now the ``hateful arrival of the
ultra-right groups,'' the article lamented, have transformed the
university into a ``soulless'' and ``devastated'' place.
</P>
<P>
   ``We begin to look at each other with suspicion, to calibrate
our words so as not to draw fire, because the blacklists began to
circulate right away,'' the writer added. To see one's name on one
of those lists ``means to become mute, to suspend research so as
not to step on mines, to distrust even the dogs that wander the
hallways with a certain fanaticism in their glance.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even with all of that, Juan Jose Hoyos, a communications
professor who edits the magazine, sees grounds for optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still open, conducting research and teaching and
attending our classes,'' he said. ``After everything that this
university has been through in the past year, that in itself is a
tremendous victory.''

   CLINTON TO SEEK NEW RULES FOR PHARMACIES ON INTERNET
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said that President Clinton would propose
legislation setting new federal standards for online drugstores.
Under the proposal, such pharmacies would need to be certified by
the Food and Drug Administration. It would also increase the
agency's investigative powers and increase the penalties for online
sales of drugs without prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals are intended to make it easier for the government
to stop online sales of unapproved or counterfeit drugs and
products promoted with false claims.
</P>
<P>
   BOND YIELDS FALL IN THIN TRADING
</P>
<P>
   As shoppers returned to stores and malls looking for
post-Christmas bargains, a faint echo of that trend was heard in
the Treasury market as scattered bargain-hunting lifted prices off
27-month lows. The yield on the 30-year Treasury fell to 6.46
percent from Thursday's 6.49 percent. But analysts said the modest
upward move occurred on such light trading that it held little
significance.
</P>
<P>
   PRISON REALTY TRUST TO RECONVERT
</P>
<P>
   A 1997 decision by Corrections Corp. of America, the United
States' leading private builder and operator of prisons, to spin
off its real-estate operations and, in effect, become a real estate
investment trust, has come to an end. Prison Realty Trust, the once
high-flying offshoot, announced a plan under which it will raise up
to $350 million in badly needed financing and, not incidentally,
convert back to a tax-paying company.
</P>
<P>
   BID MADE FOR OFFICE-SUPPLY CHAIN
</P>
<P>
   Seat Pagine Gialle, the Italian publisher of yellow pages that
has expanded into online businesses, has offered to buy Buffetti,
which operates a chain of office-supply stores, for $718 million in
cash and stock. The acquisition would create a big European company
in the growing market for electronic sales.
</P>
<P>
   SPRINT BARRED FROM MANAGING UNIT
</P>
<P>
   In a decision that may shake up Brazil's long-distance industry,
Sprint was barred from managing its Brazilian subsidiary after its
partner in the company, National Grid of Britain, persuaded a court
that delicate corporate information could be disclosed to MCI
Worldcom, which plans to acquire Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   BUFFETT DONATES STOCK TO CHARITY
</P>
<P>
   Warren Buffett, the billionaire investor, and his wife, Susan,
have donated 2,500 shares of Berkshire Hathaway stock worth about
$134 million to four charities. A spokeswoman at Berkshire Hathaway
declined to identify the charities. The company's class A common
stock fell $600, to $53,400. The charities have agreed not to sell
more than 10 shares during any one-week period.
</P>
<P>
   MERRILL ORDERED TO PAY $225,000
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch has been ordered to pay more than $225,000 in
fines and restitution to investors for failing to supervise some
agents at its Baltimore office, the Maryland attorney general's
office said.
</P>
<P>
   CHIQUITA SEEN IN A POSSIBLE SALE
</P>
<P>
   Chiquita Brands International may consider an auction to put
some or all of its assets up for sale, according to a filing with
the Securities and Exchange Commission made by a shareholder,
Consolidated Fruit. The company said it learned of the possibility
of an auction during discussions with American Financial Group, the
parent of Chiquita.
</P>
<P>
   ALLIANCE MEDICAL FACES FDA ACTION
</P>
<P>
   Alliance Medical of Phoenix, which contracts with hospitals to
clean and reprocess medical devices, has been threatened by the
Food and Drug Administration with regulatory action if the company
fails to correct problems in its Florida decontamination operation,
government officials said.
</P>
<P>
   DOW JONES TO SELL MAGAZINE UNIT
</P>
<P>
   Dow Jones, which publishes The Wall Street Journal, said that it
would sell the unit that produces Investment Advisor, Asset
Management and Property magazines and the newsletter Realty Stock
Review to Wicks Business Information. Terms were not disclosed.

CLINTON TO SEEK CRACKDOWN ON INTERNET PHARMACIES
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Clinton administration officials said Monday that
they would ask Congress to regulate the growing sale of
prescription drugs over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said President Clinton would ask for
legislation requiring online pharmacies to get approval from the
Food and Drug Administration. In addition, they said, he will ask
Congress to beef up the agency's investigative powers and increase
the penalties for online sales of prescription drugs to people
without prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals are also intended to make it easier for the
government to stop online sales of unapproved drugs, counterfeit
drugs and products promoted with fraudulent claims.
</P>
<P>
   There is no federal certification program for online pharmacies
and, operating in cyberspace, many of them do not get the state
licenses that are required of traditional drug stores. Policing
these stores and their sales of prescription drugs has been
difficult, federal officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jane Henney, the commissioner of food and drugs, said
Clinton's proposal would create civil penalties of up to $500,000
for selling a prescription drug to a person who did not have a
valid prescription or for operating without federal certification.
Federal officials say they now have difficulty prosecuting online
pharmacies and fines are usually limited to $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   As part of his budget request next month, White House officials
said, Clinton will seek $10 million to hire 100 people and upgrade
computer technology to investigate Web sites suspected of illegally
dispensing prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Monday night, Dr. Henney said the proposal
called for screening out disreputable online pharmacies and made
getting inappropriate drugs more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``The object of the whole proposal is to to make sure there's a
strong safety net for patients,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jeffrey Shuren, a medical officer at the FDA, said the
agency was already investigating more than 200 Web sites suspected
of selling unapproved drugs or selling approved medications without
valid prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   Under Clinton's proposal, the FDA would be given power to issue
administrative subpoenas compelling online pharmacies to provide
records for federal investigators. The administration said it would
protect patients' privacy, but did not give details.
</P>
<P>
   William Hubbard, a senior associate commissioner at the agency,
said: ``Online pharmacies come and go daily. Some are fly-by-night
operations. Some are located overseas.''
</P>
<P>
   In a document describing its plan to regulate online pharmacies,
the White House says sites will have to demonstrate that are
licensed by a state before they can be certified. The new federal
rules would, in effect, piggyback on state regulations on the
practice of medicine and pharmacy and would not replace them, the
document added. The White House document says that Internet
pharmacies now often ``bypass traditional safeguards against the
use of unsafe or inappropriate drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   If, for example, an online pharmacy based in Florida sold
prescription drugs to consumers in New York, the pharmacy would
have to comply with licensing requirements in both states, federal
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton plans to announce his proposals this week. A
White House official said: ``Internet pharmacies are not all bad.
Sometimes you can get access to quality prescription drugs at lower
prices in a more convenient way over the Internet. The president's
proposals are intended to target the bad apples who purvey fraud on
the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   To order drugs from an online pharmacy, a customer uses a
computer to visit the company's Web site. Many sites offer
information about drugs and diseases. Reputable companies insist on
getting a prescription from the patient or the doctor.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study by doctors at the University of Pennsylvania said
that it was alarmingly easy for consumers to get prescription drugs
without seeing a physician or a pharmacist.
</P>
<P>
   States have traditionally regulated the prescribing and
dispensing of drugs, the study said. But several states have found
it difficult to locate and prosecute online violators because the
prescriber, seller and buyer may be in different states.
</P>
<P>
   Several state attorneys general have filed lawsuits against Web
site owners, alleging violations of state laws _ for example,
providing drugs without a local pharmacy license or mailing drugs
to minors. In some cases, drugs are sent from online pharmacies
overseas, so it is difficult for federal and state authorities to
take action against them.
</P>
<P>
   The Pennsylvania study found 86 Web sites that sold Viagra
without requiring a doctor's visit or a prescription. Twenty-two of
the sites appeared to be based outside the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Matthew E. Naythons, vice president of one of the best-known
online pharmacies, PlanetRx.com, based in South San Francisco,
questioned the need for more regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are licensed to dispense drugs in all 50 states,'' he said.
``There are sufficient rules and regulations at the state level to
govern the practice of online pharmacy. Legitimate pharmacies
conform to those state regulations. To layer on another level of
regulation, at the federal level, would seem to be unnecessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Contrasting his company with some of its competitors, Naythons
said: ``At PlanetRx, we dispense medication. We don't prescribe it.
We are like your neighborhood pharmacy, but we have 35 million to
40 million branch offices through desktop computers. We want to
speak to your physician in every case, to verify your prescription,
unless we get it through the mail.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, other companies are not always so scrupulous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some online pharmacies _ rogue sites _ prescribe and
dispense,'' Naythons said. ``You can log on, complete a brief
questionnaire online and get Viagra or other drugs without seeing a
doctor in person.''

EDITORIAL: RUSSIA'S LOSING WAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Dec. 28:
</P>
<P>
   It is ironic and tragic that Russia, which endured so much
bloodshed this century, should end 1999 with a spasm of violence in
Chechnya. Moscow seems intent on leveling the Chechen capital of
Grozny, risking tens of thousands of innocent lives and threatening
to damage its relations with Muslim nations, Europe and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The military campaign daily reduces more of Grozny to rubble.
Some 50,000 civilians remain trapped in the city's bombed-out
ruins, with Russian authorities declaring they can no longer flee
to safety. Power and heat have been cut off, leaving residents
exposed to the harsh Caucasian winter. Meanwhile Grozny's rebel
defenders are putting up unexpectedly strong resistance, using land
mines and artillery to slow the advance of Russian troops and
militia fighters from the outlying suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian attack is a methodical effort to expunge the
humiliations of the 1994-96 Chechen war. Separatist rebels in that
conflict fought unprepared Russian troops to a standstill and made
Grozny a battered symbol of their resistance. This time Russian
forces are larger and better prepared, having digested the lessons
of that earlier campaign. Russian military successes thus far have
boosted Prime Minister Vladimir Putin's popularity, making him the
leading candidate to succeed Boris Yeltsin in presidential
elections next June. But whatever short-range military and
political gains this campaign may yield, the enduring costs are
likely to be high.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the toll inflicted on Chechen civilians, Moscow's actions
call into question its willingness to abide by the standards of
behavior now prevailing in most of Europe outside the Balkans. The
war has already deformed Russian democracy by driving many
reformers into an unnatural embrace of military nationalism and
strengthening the political influence of army and intelligence
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Moscow will belatedly heed calls of American and
European leaders, suspend its assault and negotiate a compromise
peace agreement. Unfortunately, given the war's popularity among
Russian leaders and voters, there seems little chance that will
happen before Grozny is destroyed and Russia is diminished.  &QL;

HARVARD LAW MULLS CUTTING NUMBER OF STUDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ABEL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Harvard Law School has many pluses to offer prospective
students _ a lofty reputation among lawyers and judges, a good bet
students will be lucratively employed by graduation, and an
education that prepares most students to pass the bar exam.
</P>
<P>
   But the three-year paper chase at Harvard has one critical con:
Students have to compete more for a professor's attention than they
do at nearly all of the nation's other top law schools.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after years of student and faculty criticism, Harvard is
poised to address the issue as early as next month.
</P>
<P>
   A recent memo written by a professor and circulated among her
colleagues has raised the idea of cutting the size of incoming
classes from an average of about 600 new students to as few as 450
students. Other professors have promoted the idea of boosting the
number of tenure-track professors beyond the current 79.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Law School is tied for the second-worst
student-professor ratio among the 50 law schools ranked this year
by US News &AMP; World Report. According to the magazine's survey,
Harvard had 20 students for every professor in 1998, compared with
9 to 1 at Yale, 13 to 1 at Stanford, and 15 to 1 at Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know that the Harvard student-faculty ratio is higher
than our peer institutions,'' said Elizabeth Warren, a law school
professor who heads a faculty committee looking into increasing
student contact with professors, as well as addressing other
student gripes such as a need for more financial aid, new housing,
and better athletic facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a big institution. But size alone is no excuse to have a
student-faculty ratio out of balance,'' Warren said. ``If we have
fewer students, there are fewer demands on the faculty.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren, however, has avoided staking out a position before
professors debate the issue in January. But she and others said
Dean Robert Clark considers lowering the ratio a top priority.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard's review comes in the wake of a comprehensive study of
student satisfaction at the law school. In September the McKinsey &AMP;
Co. consulting firm of New York polled students and found they
resent everything from big, impersonal classes to aloof,
hard-to-find professors.
</P>
<P>
   The typical size of a first-year class is 138 students, compared
with 60 at Stanford University Law School. While the
student-faculty ratio has improved in the past decade _ the ratio
is down from 26 to 1 in 1986 to about 18 to 1 in 1999, according to
a letter Clark sent students in September _ many still view it as a
major problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Harvard could change just one thing, I recommend that
(class size) be it,'' one student was quoted as saying in the
McKinsey report.
</P>
<P>
   But some professors at Harvard think too much is being made of
the student-faculty disparity. For one thing, such statistics often
exclude visiting professors from other universities and the many
guest lecturers who teach at the law school but are not considered
faculty.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can get too mechanical about this student-faculty ratio
business,'' said Todd Rakoff, a law professor and a former
associate dean at the law school.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the classes our students like best, they're
often big classes taught by good teachers. . . . It is not my view
that the school with the smaller student-faculty ratio is
necessarily giving the better education.''
</P>
<P>
   Rakoff said he and others favor increasing the faculty instead
of lopping off the number of students, and he predicted that's what
will likely happen.
</P>
<P>
   But some professors believe the faculty has already grown too
big, and they fear the larger it gets, the less the professors will
get to know one another and collaborate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes the place more like a factory,'' said one professor,
who asked not to be named. ``We're already a very big faculty. You
don't want to see professors more removed from other faculty
members.''
</P>
<P>
   In the dean's letter, he promised action.
</P>
<P>
   While he told students they will soon benefit from a lower
student-faculty ratio, he said they already enjoy Harvard Law
School's largest faculty ever. In addition to the full-time
professors, he said, there are 113 other teachers who lecture at
Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be meaningful and consistent, of course, one has to make
many adjustments, such as converting part-time faculty to full-time
equivalents and adjusting for faculty on leave,'' Clark wrote.

STUDY: SILICON VALLEY NO LONGER HOT SPOT FOR TECH JOBS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE BUTTERFIELD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Move over, Silicon Valley. California's high-tech world is about
to be eclipsed by the likes of Louisiana and Arkansas as national
hot spots for new technology hiring.
</P>
<P>
   And Southern states like Florida and Georgia _ not Massachusetts
and New England _ are expected to run a close second in the demand
for newly created technology jobs through the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   So says a new study by Computerworld, a Framingham, Mass.
information services company that has surveyed more than 1,900
major companies.
</P>
<P>
   The study found the hottest market for technology jobs is
expected to be in Southern states and in the central Southwest. New
England is pegged to be third. California _ despite its spot as the
nation's technology center _ is a distant sixth.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the change: Companies across the nation are
rushing into the Internet age, and many of them have a lot of
catching up to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corporate America's reliance on technology continues to spark
tremendous demand for highly skilled'' workers, Maryfran Johnson,
editor in chief of Computerworld, said in releasing the study
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that much of this demand for 2000 and beyond is in
areas outside the traditional technology regions shows just how
(technology) dependent our nation has become.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said nearly all companies _ not just high-tech firms _
have suddenly found themselves in need of developing and
integrating new technology to keep up with the Internet economy.
</P>
<P>
   She said the survey reflected the fact that many companies not
in high-technology areas have realized they have the greatest need
for highly skilled information technology employees.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, she said, the companies expect to do the most hiring
in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   With a shortage of qualified workers, particularly in Internet
technology, Johnson said many employers expect the bidding for
skilled workers to be fierce between regions, with many companies
gearing up for massive training programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, it's an indication that you don't have to live in the
(traditional) technology areas anymore to work in the technology
industry,'' Johnson added.
</P>
<P>
   She said the survey's findings may also be an indication that _
given the portability of technology _ both workers and companies
feel freer to move where they prefer.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Computerworld survey, the hottest technology
jobs in the year 2000 will be in computer applications, networking,
Internet development, and e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The top employers looking for technically savvy workers include
government, financial institutions, real estate firms, software
developers, and communication and transportation companies.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Computerworld said the study was conducted in
October and November among major companies representing a broad
cross section of industries and employing more than 475,000
computer professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel very comfortable these trends are accurate,'' said
David Weldon, a senior editor directly involved in the study.
``Technology is just dominating whatever a company does today.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti _ In sports and in life, Robert Duval has
always fancied the left wing. As a soccer player, he thrived at the
position, helping to lead Loyola University in Montreal to a
college championship. But when he returned to his native Haiti
after graduating in 1976, his opposition to the dictatorship of
Jean-Claude Duvalier earned him a brutal 17-month prison term in
solitary confinement.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, after 20 years of political activism during which he
encountered dictators, military governments and coups, Duval
wondered what he had accomplished. Despite presidential elections
and talk of democracy, he was beginning to see his nation slip into
a political stalemate that would cripple it for the next few years.
While his nation was undergoing this political crisis, he too was
experiencing a crisis, a more personal, midlife kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every person in this country has to find a way to express
himself and make sense of his life,'' Duval said. ``Many quit and
say there is no hope. That is the response of the middle class and
the upper class. That is not my way. Where do we go from here?''
</P>
<P>
   Back to the soccer field.
</P>
<P>
   On a 15-acre lot where the only things that glistened were
thousands of shards of broken glass, Duval, who is 46, founded
Athletics of Haiti, a sports organization that takes youngsters
from the slums of Cite Soleil and gives them training, food and
tutoring.
</P>
<P>
   Relying on a Candide-like optimism and contacts among the elite
with whom he grew up, Duval has turned a patch of dirt on the
outskirts of an industrial area into a rare sight here in Haiti's
capital: a wide-open green space with lockers, showers and
equipment usually unavailable even to the nation's biggest athletic
clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Just as rare is that Duval is running a social laboratory,
fielding teams composed of rough-and-tumble ghetto children, who
grew up kicking around plastic bottles, and middle-class youths,
whose parents see soccer as the ticket to a college scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   Duval sees soccer as more than a diversion. In a nation where
class and color have long separated people, he wants to use sport
as a way to bring people together and move them forward.
Traditional politics, however earnest or well meaning, had its
limits, he decided. But soccer, a Haitian passion if not a
world-class pursuit, gives him a chance to see results among the
215 youngsters who come to the center each day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not really about sports,'' he said. ``There are some kids
you find here with a lot of talent, whether it be intellectual,
poetry, music or sports. Sports will expose them to a higher level
of life. I wanted to prove that you can do something positive with
Haitian kids. I am sick and tired of hearing people dump on Haiti
and say it has no hope.''
</P>
<P>
   As a former member of the Violette team, one of Haiti's most
popular soccer teams, Duval had already learned a life lesson or
two from his playing days. During the most turbulent periods of
political unrest in Haiti in the mid-to late 1980s, acquaintances
who remembered him from the sport would sometimes warn him about
impending attacks by supporters of the dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had not had that kind of past, I would be dead because of
my politics,'' Duval said. ``Sometimes I was protected by gunmen
who were supposed to shoot me. He would know me from the team and
say, `Don't go there because I'm supposed to kill you there.' That
showed me how much soccer means to the Haitian people.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval, the son of an auto-parts industrialist, spent years at
the forefront of a political struggle as an outspoken advocate for
human rights. But he grew introspective in the mid-1990s, slowly
pulling away from politics and beginning to look for ways to spend
more time with his teen-age son, Guy Robert.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted my son to have a different experience,'' said Duval,
who is divorced. ``I didn't want him to be raised behind walls, not
like the bourgeoisie.''
</P>
<P>
   One day, while searching for a place where his son could play
soccer, Duval stumbled across a dirty field filled with dozens of
children from the nearby slums of Cite Soleil. The land had been
unused since angry mobs sacked the few houses that stood there in
the vengeful months after the Duvalier regime collapsed in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was what I was looking for,'' he said. ``I came here and
took a group of kids and told them I wanted to do a team with them.
I had tryouts and a thousand kids came out. I had to choose 100.
Can you imagine? I didn't know what I was getting into. I was just
trying to do something for my son.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Duval was doting on a huge extended family, imparting
lessons about the importance of school and sports. He reached an
agreement with the owners of the land, who allowed him to use it
for free. He began to call up old friends _ some of the very elites
he had scorned in previous years _ asking them for donations to
help provide food, equipment and money for books and school
tuition.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the three soccer fields are clean, thanks to a grounds
crew that spent weeks hunched over the dirt plucking out shards of
glass. A wall protecting the children from running onto an adjacent
road encloses part of the field. A clubhouse with lockers and
showers has gone up.
</P>
<P>
   A running track made from packed sand has begun to emerge in one
corner, which Duval plans to cover with rubber scraps from his
father's tire retreading factory. Several basketball courts have
been built, using backboards made from pallets and castoff steel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a recycling operation down here,'' he said.

 PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti: here,'' he said  
<TEXT>
<P>
   But given the social lines that have long divided Haiti, the
task is sometimes frustrating. People in the ghetto sometimes
suspect that Duval, with his privileged background, has an ulterior
motive, using sport to help build his own political base.
</P>
<P>
   He often has to remind the parents from Cite Soleil that they
must encourage their children to study, using school and discipline
as the passport to sports. He is not there simply to provide free
shoes and meals and let the children run free.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not a man who treats people differently because of their
color,'' said Jeanel Dolvilas, who is 21 and has been playing at
the field for several years. ``He really wants to help people.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval has encountered resistance from the middle class, which
sometimes cringes when he suggests that they send their children to
play with youngsters from Cite Soleil.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell them they should come and give it a try,'' he said.
``If you're serious about your kid playing soccer in the future and
getting a scholarship, this is the place to do it. This is where
the talent is.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention where the controversy is. Duval said he had
encountered resistance from the managers of other teams, who he
said resent his efforts. In some tournaments, he said, his teams
have been disqualified on technicalities, while other teams go
unpunished for more serious violations. For the second year in a
row, one of his teams was eliminated, unfairly, he said, from
moving up into a division that is better equipped and organized.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take the money and do things with it,'' he said. ``A lot of
guys who run teams take the money and live off it. I'm opposed to
that sector.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval knows he may sound naive. He takes no money for running
the club, even though he works at it full-time. He also knows he
could lose it all tomorrow if the landowners demand their property
or if he fails to come up with enough financing and donations. He
knows, too, that some people are willing to look out for him. Mario
Elie, the San Antonio Spurs player who is of Haitian descent,
visited a few months ago to lend support.
</P>
<P>
   Others also have, but in more streetwise ways. One evening, a
gold-toothed man from the slums came by to warn Duval about rumors
that someone was going to disrupt a meeting with parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there are any problems, this is what I have to help you,''
the man said, lifting his shirt to reveal a revolver tucked into
his waistband.
</P>
<P>
   Duval shrugged it off. Nothing unusual happened at the meeting,
where he spoke to 200 parents and children about the work he was
doing at the center.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who say Haiti has nothing,'' he said. ``I
believe we have some serious Haitians who can do their own
development themselves. We can help ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The parents stayed long after it had grown dark. Duval lingered
for a while, chatting with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``What keeps me going?'' he said. ``Every day I come here and
see the wall is still here, the house is not broken into and the
guys are still working. Every day that goes by is a victory for
me.''

SUSPECT ARRESTED IN SLAYING OF OFFICER 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe

<P>
   The man accused of killing a Holyoke, Mass. police officer was
arrested in Scranton, Pa., Monday, ending a five-day manhunt in
more than a dozen states and bringing comfort to mourners as they
prepared for John A. DiNapoli's funeral Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest was announced at DiNapoli's wake Monday afternoon,
and hundreds of the officer's friends, family, and colleagues
applauded.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means there is a closure to John DiNapoli's death,''
Holyoke Police Chief Marc Cournoyer said at a news conference. ``It
doesn't lessen our pain, but at least we're relieved he's in
custody and no one else got hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Scranton police arrested Eddie Morales, 27, of Holyoke, as he
left his car in a strip mall parking lot about 4:45 p.m., Scranton
Detective Robert Brenzel said. Morales surrendered without
incident.
</P>
<P>
   Morales allegedly shot DiNapoli, 52, five times while the
off-duty patrol officer was chasing him in an unmarked car last
Wednesday. DiNapoli was responding to a call to break up a fight
and died from wounds in the abdomen, shoulder, arm, and heart.
Police say Morales has an extensive record of drug arrests and was
connected to a local gang.
</P>
<P>
   Morales was quickly identified by witnesses as DiNapoli's
assailant, police said. The dragnet expanded across the Northeast
and included federal and state investigators. Police said Morales
also broke into a Holyoke woman's home.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts State Police contacted Scranton authorities about
2 p.m. Monday with ``a pretty good idea'' where Morales was,
Brenzel said. Cournoyer refused to specify what leads brought the
search to Scranton.
</P>
<P>
   Local police staked out the residence where Morales was staying
and followed him when he left. They seized him when he stopped his
car in a parking lot, Brenzel said. About 20 officers participated
in the arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no fight at all,'' Brenzel said. ``I think he was
just overwhelmed by the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Relations between police and Hispanics in Holyoke are strained.
Latinos make up half of the city's population of 45,000. Some in
the community have accused law enforcement officials of
insensitivity. Some activists had feared that Morales might not
live if he resisted arrest.
</P>
<P>
   When in court Tuesday, authorities will request Morales be
returned to Massachusetts to face murder charges, Hampden District
Attorney William Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   Morales's capture ends an exhaustive search that strained
grieving members of the Holyoke police force, as well as DiNapoli's
friends and family.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been going 24 hours a day since this started, and I
thank God we were able to put everybody's mind at ease,'' Cournoyer
said. ``This man's capture has certainly relieved the community of
Holyoke and made . . . the entire Western Massachusetts community
sleep a little better this evening.''
</P>
<P>
   The news of the arrest brought a moment of excitement for the
relatives and colleagues attending the officer's wake. ``A lot of
tears, a lot of hugging,'' police chaplain Bill Hamilton said.
</P>
<P>
   Holyoke officials and police unions had offered a $50,000 reward
for information leading to an arrest and conviction. Cournoyer said
he thought the reward helped secure Morales's capture, but refused
to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   DiNapoli was a 21-year veteran whose duties included classroom
visits dressed as McGruff the Crime Dog. He had patrolled the
streets until he was asked to perform administrative duties about
six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Holyoke mayor-elect Michael Sullivan said last week that he
would order that police cruisers and stationery be emblazoned with
the letters ``wwjdd,'' a take-off on the popular ``What would Jesus
do?'' slogan _ ``What would John DiNapoli have done?''
</P>
<P>
   Divorced, DiNapoli had a grown son and daughter who live in the
Holyoke area. His 30-year-old son, Andy, had been interested in
becoming a police officer.
</P>
<P>
   At the funeral mass at Immaculate Conception Church in Holyoke,
several thousand are expected to attend, including about 4,000
police officers from 60 departments around New England and beyond,
according to State Police Captain Robert Bird.

TWO SIDES CLASH OVER BAIL FOR ATOM SCIENTIST 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. _ Federal prosecutors on Monday provided a
judge with new, highly detailed evidence against a nuclear
scientist in their effort to have him kept in jail as he awaits
trial on charges of misusing weapons secrets.
</P>
<P>
   But in its cross-examination of a top government computer
expert, the scientist's lawyers relentlessly attacked the
prosecution's complex, highly circumstantial case, suggesting that
whatever had been done by the defendant, Wen Ho Lee, he had never
acted with criminal intent.
</P>
<P>
   The government presented evidence that as a nuclear engineer at
the Los Alamos National Laboratory, Lee had methodically and
repeatedly violated a series of procedures meant to protect data
concerning the design, construction and testing of atomic weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The defense, however, tried to show that Lee had done nothing to
disguise any of his steps and that in most instances the
incriminating evidence had been left unhidden for as long as six
years. Lee has maintained in the past that he downloaded the secret
data to unsecure computers to protect it in case of computer
breakdowns.
</P>
<P>
   In March, after some four years in which he was a focus of
federal investigations into the possibility that China had stolen
American nuclear secrets, the Taiwan-born Lee, a naturalized
citizen of the United States, was dismissed from his Los Alamos job
for security violations.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago he was indicted on charges that he had violated
numerous security procedures in downloading some of the country's
most closely kept nuclear secrets onto unsecured computers and
copying them onto computer tapes, some of which have since
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   While the indictment accused him of acting ``with intent to
secure an advantage to a foreign nation,'' it did not identify that
nation, and he was not charged with espionage. Still, the
government argued that his fleeing would endanger national
security, and on Dec. 13 a federal magistrate granted the
prosecution's motion that he be denied bail. The hearing on Monday,
before Judge James Parker, concerned the defense's appeal of that
decision.
</P>
<P>
   One government witness was Richard Krajcik, a leader of the Los
Alamos laboratory's X division, which designs nuclear weapons and
was Lee's employer.
</P>
<P>
   Krajcik testified that there was no reason Lee's job would have
required him to create all the files of classified information that
he downloaded from secure computers. The witness also said that
taken together, those files dealt with ``the crown jewel'' of the
American nuclear arsenal, providing what was effectively a
blueprint for designing advanced nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But testimony that can sound extremely damning under prosecution
questioning often seems far less so once the defense gets its
chance, and Lee's lawyers have not yet had the opportunity to
cross-examine Krajcik.
</P>
<P>
   An earlier witness Monday was the government computer expert
Cheryl Lee Wampler, who said that the computer system onto which
Lee placed top-secret files could be reached by outsiders using the
Internet. In fact, Ms. Wampler said, shortly after Lee had
improperly downloaded some secret files to his unsecured computer
system, someone logged on to that system from the University of
California at Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wampler acknowledged, though, that whoever those users were,
there was no evidence that they had gained access to the secret
files themselves. And one of Lee's lawyers, Mark Holscher, jumped
up and told the judge that the FBI had confirmed that those users
were in fact Lee's children, who studied at UCLA. To that, a
government prosecutor, Paula Burnett, replied that it was ``one
optional theory.''
</P>
<P>
   The questioning of Ms. Wampler had the ring of a Cold War
thriller at times, with discussions of X divisions, Z passwords and
Q clearances.
</P>
<P>
   The witness made clear that the government had pieced together
Lee's actions by comparing a ledger that he kept by hand with
various computer records at the laboratory. She said Lee had pulled
together a trove of nuclear data and created 19 files, which he
moved to the unsecure computers in 1993 and 1994 through a
laborious process.
</P>
<P>
   For as long as six years, most of those files were on an open
computer, where they appeared in various logs of computer activity
but were not discovered by security experts until Lee had come
under suspicion and his secure work computers were examined.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's lawyers showed that he had not even changed the top-secret
names of the files. As a result, any knowledgeable person seeing
them would have known immediately what they were.
</P>
<P>
   In the cross-examination of Ms. Wampler, the defense also tried
to show that Lee had taken the steps he did because they were the
only means available to create backups of the files.
</P>
<P>
   Through prosecution and defense questioning alike, the
60-year-old Lee, wearing a dark blue suit, appeared comfortable.
Frequently he smiled and waved to his supporters in the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing adjourned Monday evening and is to resume on
Tuesday.

<TEXT>
<P>
   After surviving rumors of his firing for more than a month, P.J.
Carlesimo was dismissed as head coach of the Golden State Warriors
Monday, a little over two years after being involved in one of the
ugliest incidents in National Basketball Association history.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came an hour and a half before the team's game
with the San Antonio Spurs in Oakland, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Garry St. Jean, the club's general manager, led the Warriors
onto the court shortly after agreeing to a multiyear contract to
coach the team as well.
</P>
<P>
   Carlesimo, who was in his third season as Warriors coach, had
two and a half years left on a five-year, $15 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   During a Warriors practice on Dec. 1, 1997, one of Carlesimo's
players, Latrell Sprewell, choked the coach in a fit of rage. He
said Carlesimo's abrasive coaching style had led to the attack.
After serving a 68-game suspension, Sprewell was traded to the New
York Knicks before last season.
</P>
<P>
   While Carlesimo's verbally aggressive tactics often put him at
odds with his players _ and was a major factor in his being
dismissed by the Portland Trail Blazers in 1977 after three winning
seasons _ it was his record that cost him in Golden State as much
as anything. In their first season in the newly refurbished Arena
in Oakland, the Warriors were 6-21 under Carlesimo.
</P>
<P>
   Carlesimo, who took over the Warriors in June 1997, shortly
after leaving Portland, had a 46-123 record with Golden State. A
successful collegiate coach at Seton Hall before joining the NBA,
Carlesimo, who is 50 years old, has an NBA record of 183-222.
</P>
<P>
   Carlesimo's firing will further the perception that he came out
the loser in his violent confrontation with Sprewell. While
Carlesimo is out of a job, Sprewell recently signed a five-year,
$61.8 million contract extension with the defending Eastern
Conference champions and is a crowd favorite at Madison Square
Garden.
</P>
<P>
   The two appeared on the same court for the first time since the
choking incident when the Knicks visited the Warriors on Nov. 20.
Though Carlesimo hinted that he would have liked to shake
Sprewell's hand and put the ugly occurrence behind them, Sprewell
showed no such inclination and in fact reacted so viciously to
Golden State's fans that he was fined $10,000 for his actions.
</P>
<P>
   In another meeting, at the Garden on Dec. 7, Sprewell again kept
his distance from Carlesimo.
</P>
<P>
   It was around the time of the clubs' first meeting that rumors
of Carlesimo's removal began circulating around the league. The
Warriors were 2-7 at the time and went on to lose their next nine
games.
</P>
<P>
   However, a surprising string of four victories in six games
midway through December, including a victory over the Sacramento
Kings, extended Carlesimo's tenure. But three straight losses, one
of them to the lowly Los Angeles Clippers, finally did him in.
</P>
<P>
   The 57-year-old St. Jean, who was an assistant coach with the
Warriors under Don Nelson from 1988-92, became the team's general
manager before the 1997-98 season. He served as Sacramento's head
coach from 1992 to 1997 and accumulated a 159-236 record before
being replaced by Eddie Jordan, now an assistant with the Nets, 67
games into the 1996-97 season. &QL;

<P>
   No one photograph or, for that matter, style could sum up the
century of fashion that rose on the pinched bosoms of Edwardian
ladies and ended, for all practical purposes, one night in December
with rap stars exiting the Metropolitan Museum of Art in a flourish
of diamonds and couture silk. It would be impossible, if not
outrageous, to ignore the influence of Chanel and Saint Laurent,
the glamour of Hollywood, the contagion of youth or the spirit of
absolute freedom that drove designers as different as Paul Poiret
and Ralph Lauren to invent their own worlds.
</P>
<P>
   But let's. Let's for a moment skip past the crowded faces, the
reflective blather, and look at the century as if through a
photographer's lens. It may be surprising what a single image
reveals not only of its time and place, but also about the force
that has shaped fashion since some unsung Edwardian hellion let her
corset fly _ the roaring, squealing, yahooing train of modernism.
</P>
<P>
   The photographer is George Hoyningen-Huene (pronounced
hoy-nee-HAN hoo-NAY), and the picture is ``Swimwear by Izod,''
taken in 1930 for Vogue. It shows a couple sitting, apparently, on
a diving platform overlooking a hazy sea. They could be in Greece,
and indeed Huene (as he is always known), like his contemporaries
in Paris in the 1920s and '30s _ the poet Jean Cocteau, the
dressmaker Alix Gres _ enjoyed posing his subjects against cold
Greek marble. In this instance, the giveaway is the man's radiant
musculature, a foretaste of Bruce Weber's beefcake. The tank-topped
fellow, by the way, was Huene's friend Horst Bohrmann, who later
became the photographer Horst P. Horst.
</P>
<P>
   A Russian aristocrat by birth as well as temperament, Huene had
convictions about almost everything, which left little room for
argument. ``It was not conceit but the certainty of my creative
ability,'' he said, that led him to adopt the attitude that ``Vogue
was to be honored by my presence.'' Fortunately for the magazine's
indulgent editor in chief, Edna Woolman Chase, such highhandedness
was mitigated by Huene's technical wizardry and his fondness for
simplicity and surprise.
</P>
<P>
   He was a master of light and illusion _ ``the master of us
all,'' said Richard Avedon _ and his ingenuity went beyond artful
displays of society models in Vionnet evening pajamas. In the late
'40s, while working in Hollywood for the director George Cukor (and
hanging out with Garbo), Huene devised an elevated reflecting pool
around the hillside home of his friend Oreste Pucciani, the French
literary scholar who became the companion of the designer Rudi
Gernreich. Apparently, Huene thought the terror of the vertiginous
view could be alleviated a bit by endlessly reflected sky.
</P>
<P>
   What's interesting about ``Swimwear by Izod'' is what you don't
see: the cheap thrills of Surrealism. Despite Huene's friendship
with Salvador Dali and other Surrealists, his work remained largely
free of such contrivances as teacups made of fur or mutton-chop
hats, a favorite of Elsa Schiaparelli.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 25 years earlier, in 1906, Poiret had shown the first
straight-line silhouette, without underpinnings, and although
Poiret became better known for designing Oriental pantaloons and
for fancy-dress balls, where he sat on a throne at least once,
Huene must have recognized the future in that earlier, unencumbered
style. He always tried to imbue his photographs with the same
relaxed air of freedom, even putting his models in such real props
as cars, so that they would represent, as he said, ``the modern
woman in the true light of the period.''
</P>
<P>
   If Huene identified with any dressmaker, it was Coco Chanel, who
wasn't exaggerating when she said, ``I was the first to live the
life of this century.'' Her deceptively simple innovations _ the
little black dress, the cardigan jacket, the jersey pullover, the
quilted bag and costume jewelry _ subscribed to the notion that if
a woman felt good, she would be free to concentrate on things other
than what she was wearing.
</P>
<P>
   So Chanel anticipated the demands on working women and designed
a modern uniform. Though it has gone through endless mutations, as
the slouchy Armani jacket, the utilitarian Gap T-shirt, the no-fuss
Prada nylon bag, it adheres to Chanel's original ideals of comfort
and function.
</P>
<P>
   Another overt influence in Huene's work was the impoverished
style of the esoteric painter and set designer Pavel Tchelitchev,
who was, the curator William A. Ewing wrote, ``the first to see in
commonplace clothes such as workman's outfits and army surplus gear
the stuff of genuine novelty.'' In other words, said Cecil Beaton,
another whose work was affected, ``Tchelitchev's idiom was
antifashion.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there's nothing obviously ragtag in ``Swimwear by
Izod,'' the fact that Huene sought to evoke an everyday moment, an
athletic-looking couple dressed for the beach, suggests that at
least he knew which way the fashion wind was blowing. A decade
later, Louise Dahl-Wolfe was photographing Claire McCardell's spare
bathing suits and tunics, which were unlined, made of simple
fabrics like gingham and looked best on athletic bodies.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1960s, realism would be the norm, as Twiggy and Penelope
Tree leaped in their miniskirts and Yves Saint Laurent mixed the
harder edge of the street (pea jackets and motorcycle leather) with
the knowing cool of a mannish pantsuit, a style that remains a
symbol of self-assured chic precisely because it hasn't changed.
It's no wonder, to look at Ralph Lauren's 1980s advertising image
of a clean-cut family leaning against its ski poles, why his
essentially anti-fashion ``Boola Boola'' gear provoked scorn while
making him rich. It's the apotheosis of Heune's modern glamour.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in the postmodern era, fashion has hiccuped from one
big look to the next as designers have revived punks and mods, even
the corseted jewel-box figurines of Dior's New Look. But invariably
it comes back to resembling something that combines Chanel's idea
of function with new forms of louch excitement (in a nutshell,
Gucci's hippie chic).
</P>
<P>
   Beaton once said that fashion, like certain popular songs, has
an uncanny ability to call up emotions. As he put it: ``Perhaps it
is precisely because of their fleeting qualities that they seem to
incorporate, in their expression, a peculiar poignancy and almost
tragic awareness of the unique moment in time that will never come
again.'' That is the unique power and beauty of Huene's image. It
conjures up not just a feeling, but also a sense of the
photographer's far-sighted judgment.
</P>
<P>
   But fashion, as Huene knew, is an infinitely tricky business.
For all its realism, there is nothing particularly real about
``Swimwear by Izod.'' The diving board the couple is sitting on is,
in fact, a stack of boxes. The hazy sea? That too is pure illusion.
Huene simply took his subjects up to the roof of the Vogue studio
in Paris and aimed his lights. The horizon line is actually the top
of the building's parapet, and on the other side, down below, is
the Champs-Elysees. Life marches on.

SAN ANTONIO _ In September, the idea of playing a bowl game in a
domed stadium in a tourist city _ the only bowl taking place that
night, mind you _ would have suited Penn State and Texas A&AMP;M just
fine.
<TEXT>
<P>
   That scenario would have brought to mind playing for the
national championship at the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans. Instead,
the Aggies and Nittany Lions face the harsh reality of playing for
far less tonight in the Alamo Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   In Penn State's case, the wounded Nittany Lions (9-3) are
playing only for pride. They were undefeated and ranked No. 2 in
the country in early November before losing to Minnesota, Michigan
and Michigan State to end the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse is all Penn State has heard about for nearly two
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a good team, but it's easy to forget what happened
before those three (losses),'' said Penn State linebacker LaVar
Arrington. ``We need to make a statement with our last game.
Everybody remembers what you do at the end of the season, so we
want to go out as winners.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You match our roster against any other team in the country,
and I think we have more talent than anybody,'' said Penn State
wide receiver Chafie Fields. ``But we lost. We didn't make plays
when we had to, and the other teams did. Talent doesn't always win
games. It's as simple as that. It's time to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies (8-3) had their national title hopes punctured one
month earlier than Penn State. On the first weekend in October, the
Aggies, ranked No. 5 in the nation at the time, were stunned by
Texas Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Lopsided losses to Oklahoma and Nebraska and the dismissal of
tailback Dante Hall for disciplinary reasons followed, but the
Aggies finished the season with wins over Missouri and Texas. The
Alamo Bowl provides a chance to end the season on an upswing and
improve on a 2-6 record in bowls since R.C. Slocum took over as
head coach in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played a lot of the top, traditional programs in our bowls,
and we've come close nearly every time,'' said Slocum. ``A win in
this game against a team like Penn State would close our season in
the right way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were the No. 5 team, and we had just as high aspirations as
they did,'' said Aggies running back Ja'Mar Toombs. ``When you lose
like we did to Texas Tech, the mood of your whole season goes down.
Once you lose, you have to step back and realize what you have to
do to get back in there and win games.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nittany Lions were unable to regroup after a last-minute
24-23 home loss to Minnesota the first week in November. With three
straight losses, Penn State is on the brink of a four-game losing
streak for the first time in the Joe Paterno era, which began in
1966.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's scary,'' said Arrington, who won the Butkus Award as
the nation's top linebacker this season. ``Everybody talks about
tradition at Penn State, and we don't want to go down as the team
that was the first to lose four straight games. We can't go out
there and lose four straight. We've got to fight to avoid that.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can't get excited about playing in this game, you'd see
us get one of the worst tail-kickings in Penn State history. Texas
A&AMP;M is playing what's going to be a home game, and they're going to
try to embarrass us.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Aggies will have what amounts to a home game
tonight. The Alamodome has been sold out for weeks, and a record
crowd of more than 65,000 is expected. Most will wear maroon, as
Penn State returned about 2,400 tickets and traveled only about
6,500 fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of our fans are obviously disappointed,'' said Paterno,
who has a 19-9-1 bowl record. ``I think they're shellshocked. There
were such high expectations; they were all making plans to go to
New Orleans. That was one of the reasons (for the lack of
interest).''
</P>
<P>
   Paterno also has said those national championship expectations
might have been unrealistic, considering the quality and depth of
opponents in the Big Ten. It sounds like a spin, but Paterno might
be right about teams in tough conferences like the Big Ten and Big
12 having a built-in impediment to winning a national title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was talking to some of the coaches in the conference, and
this league's gotten so tough that maybe the BCS (Bowl Championship
Series) is not a viable option for us because of the difficulty of
the schedule,'' said Paterno. `` It would be unfair to expect every
year to be a national championship (year) in a conference as tough
as this one. You've got to be realistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Realism will take center stage tonight in the Alamodome, where
Penn State and the Aggies will finish a season that will be
remembered mainly for what might have been.

   NEW YORK _ Sean ``Puffy'' Combs' arrest for criminal possession
of a weapon following a shooting incident at Club NY early Monday
morning was not his first brush with the law.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Combs, the rap producer and performer, was arrested on
charges of beating a record executive, Steven Stoute, who suffered
a broken arm, a broken jaw and cuts to his head.
</P>
<P>
   Stoute, an executive at Interscope Records, said at the time
that Combs and two bodyguards had pummeled him with their fists, a
telephone, a Champagne bottle and a chair.
</P>
<P>
   Combs, a 30-year-old multimillionaire with his own record label,
Bad Boy Entertainment, faced up to seven years in prison if
convicted of felony assault.
</P>
<P>
   But after Combs publicly apologized, Stoute asked the Manhattan
district attorney to drop the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Combs was sentenced to a mandatory day of ``anger management''
classes.
</P>
<P>
   The rift between Stoute and Combs apparently occurred after
Combs appeared in a scene for a video by the rapper Nas, according
to an article in Billboard magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Combs had second thoughts and asked Stoute to cut the scene,
which featured him on a crucifix, but the video was shown on MTV
unedited, the article said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Combs was found guilty of criminal mischief for
threatening a New York Post photographer with a gun. He paid a
$1,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Last January, Combs and the rapper Dwight ``Heavy D'' Myers were
found to bear half of the responsibility for the deaths of nine
students crushed in a stampede during a party that they sponsored
at City College in December 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Louis C. Benza of the state court of claims in Albany said
the other half of the blame should be shouldered by the college.
</P>
<P>
   The families of the dead concertgoers have sought to negotiate
settlements with the rappers.

RAP PERFORMER FROM QUEENS FACES CHARGE ON MARIJUANA

   NEW YORK _ Victor Santiago, a fast-rising rap performer from
Queens who performs under the name Noreaga, was arrested Sunday
night on narcotics charges after undercover officers spotted him
and three other men sharing a marijuana cigarette in his car, the
police said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Santiago, 22, was charged with criminal possession of marijuana,
a misdemeanor. He was released from custody by Judge Robert Raciti
of Queens Criminal Court. The charges against Santiago will be
dropped if he is not arrested again in the next six months, said
Mary de Bourbon, a spokeswoman for the Queens district attorney's
office. The other men who were arrested were also released.
</P>
<P>
   Santiago and his friends were parked at 111th Street and 55th
Avenue in Corona at 6:10 p.m. on Sunday when a group of Queens
narcotics officers noticed the men passing what appeared to be a
marijuana cigarette, said Officer Joseph Cavitolo, a police
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Santiago served a three-year term as a teen-ager for attempted
murder. While in prison, he met Kiam Holley, another young man from
Queens, and they formed a wildly successful rap duo that, in 1997,
produced ``The War Report,'' an album that became an underground
hit. Last year, Santiago released a solo album, ``N.O.R.E.,'' which
sold more than 125,000 copies in its first week. Earlier this year,
he released another recording, ``Melvin Flynt _ Da Hustler.''
</P>
<P>
   Reginald Dennis, former music editor of The Source, a rap
magazine, said that Santiago's music tried to capture the gritty
essence of the streets with simple, rhyming lyrics about topics
like drug dealing and violence. The message has resonated with
countless fans in New York, Dennis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``His lyrics rhyme, the words rhyme, but at such a rudimentary
level that it's appealing to his fans,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, Santiago has said that he wants to be versatile,
writing and singing about the streets he cannot leave behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it here, and part of the reason why our music comes
across as real is because it is real,'' he said earlier this year
in The Los Angeles Times. ``We lived through the experiences you'll
hear.''

<P>
   After surviving rumors of his firing for more than a month, P.J.
Carlesimo was dismissed as head coach of the Golden State Warriors
Monday, a little over two years after being involved in one of the
ugliest incidents in National Basketball Association history.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came an hour and a half before the team's game
with the San Antonio Spurs in Oakland, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Garry St. Jean, the club's general manager, led the Warriors
onto the court shortly after agreeing to a multiyear contract to
coach the team as well.
</P>
<P>
   Carlesimo, who was in his third season as Warriors coach, had
two and a half years left on a five-year, $15 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   During a Warriors practice on Dec. 1, 1997, one of Carlesimo's
players, Latrell Sprewell, choked the coach in a fit of rage. He
said Carlesimo's abrasive coaching style had led to the attack.
After serving a 68-game suspension, Sprewell was traded to the New
York Knicks before last season.
</P>
<P>
   While Carlesimo's verbally aggressive tactics often put him at
odds with his players _ and was a major factor in his being
dismissed by the Portland Trail Blazers in 1977 after three winning
seasons _ it was his record that cost him in Golden State as much
as anything. In their first season in the newly refurbished Arena
in Oakland, the Warriors were 6-21 under Carlesimo.
</P>
<P>
   Carlesimo, who took over the Warriors in June 1997, shortly
after leaving Portland, had a 46-123 record with Golden State. A
successful collegiate coach at Seton Hall before joining the NBA,
Carlesimo, who is 50 years old, has an NBA record of 183-222.
</P>
<P>
   Carlesimo's firing will further the perception that he came out
the loser in his violent confrontation with Sprewell. While
Carlesimo is out of a job, Sprewell recently signed a five-year,
$61.8 million contract extension with the defending Eastern
Conference champions and is a crowd favorite at Madison Square
Garden.
</P>
<P>
   The two appeared on the same court for the first time since the
choking incident when the Knicks visited the Warriors on Nov. 20.
Though Carlesimo hinted that he would have liked to shake
Sprewell's hand and put the ugly occurrence behind them, Sprewell
showed no such inclination and in fact reacted so viciously to
Golden State's fans that he was fined $10,000 for his actions.
</P>
<P>
   In another meeting, at the Garden on Dec. 7, Sprewell again kept
his distance from Carlesimo.
</P>
<P>
   It was around the time of the clubs' first meeting that rumors
of Carlesimo's removal began circulating around the league. The
Warriors were 2-7 at the time and went on to lose their next nine
games.
</P>
<P>
   However, a surprising string of four victories in six games
midway through December, including a victory over the Sacramento
Kings, extended Carlesimo's tenure. But three straight losses, one
of them to the lowly Los Angeles Clippers, finally did him in.
</P>
<P>
   The 57-year-old St. Jean, who was an assistant coach with the
Warriors under Don Nelson from 1988-92, became the team's general
manager before the 1997-98 season. He served as Sacramento's head
coach from 1992 to 1997 and accumulated a 159-236 record before
being replaced by Eddie Jordan, now an assistant with the Nets, 67
games into the 1996-97 season. &QL;

SCHOOL BOARD TO DISCUSS CREW'S EXIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The best candidate to replace Schools Chancellor Rudy
Crew would be a good administrator and manager, not necessarily
someone with experience as an educator, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's words are likely to reverberate through Board of
Education headquarters in Brooklyn, where the seven-member board
will meet Tuesday to consider whether to try to buy out Crew's
contract, which expires in June, and to consider options in finding
an interim and permanent replacement.
</P>
<P>
   The names of several potential successors, including those of
school officials in Chicago, Dallas and San Diego, have surfaced
since the board voted on Thursday not to renew Crew's contract.
</P>
<P>
   If Giuliani were to get his wish, a successful candidate would
be ``a very, very skilled administrator, very skilled manager, the
kind of person that could run a very, very complex business or
multinational corporation,'' as he said at a press conference
Monday. ``That could be an educator, but I would not limit myself
to that. I would consider people outside the field of education who
have the skill to run very, very complex organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time Giuliani has expressed such
sentiments. Four years ago, too, during the search that led to the
hiring of Crew, the mayor said he was interested in a business
leader as schools chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   But such a person, lacking formal credentials as a school
administrator, would have to get a waiver from Richard P. Mills,
the commissioner of the state Education Department, to be appointed
_ a potential problem if the choice is viewed as a highly political
one.
</P>
<P>
   Among those mentioned in as a potential candidate is Herman
Badillo, a mayoral adviser and chairman of the City University of
New York. But a person who has been involved in high-level
discussions about possible chancellor candidates said there was no
chance of Badillo being offered the job, in part because of his
previously voiced interest in running for mayor. Badillo was on
vacation Monday and was unavailable for comment, a spokesman for
CUNY said.
</P>
<P>
   Ninfa Segarra, one of Giuliani's appointees to the school board,
said last week that while there had always been candidates with
good credentials who were willing to come to New York, it was
perhaps more important now that Crew's replacement ``should be from
the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Crew was on vacation in Washington state on Monday and could not
be reached for comment. He is scheduled to return to New York early
next month. Meanwhile, two education officials close to Crew said
that school districts in several cities, including Oakland and San
Francisco, had expressed interest in hiring him.

SHUTTLE LANDS SAFELY AFTER COMPLETING HUBBLE MISSION

<P>
   Skirting high winds, the Discovery astronauts swept to a landing
Monday at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida, bringing their
Christmas mission to repair the Hubble Space Telescope to a close.
</P>
<P>
   With commander Curt Brown and pilot Scott Kelly at the controls,
Discovery touched down at 7:01 p.m. EST. High winds that forced the
shuttle to wave off an earlier landing opportunity abated
sufficiently to allow Discovery to touch down in Cape Canaveral.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome back to Earth after a fantastic flight,'' mission
control's Scott Altman said in greeting the astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the best Christmas we could because we gave the Hubble
Space Telescope back to the astronomers in tiptop shape,'' Brown
said.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes before its landing, Discovery sped high over Central
Texas, moving west to east and leaving an orange-tinged trail
visible from Houston in its wake. The glowing trail was created by
the frictional heat of the shuttle as it sliced through the Earth's
atmosphere at an altitude of just over 150,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   With their safe return, Discovery astronauts Brown, Kelly, Steve
Smith, Mike Foale, John Grunsfeld, Jean Francois Clervoy of France
and Claude Nicollier of Switzerland became the final space
travelers of the 1900s.
</P>
<P>
   Though only the third shuttle flight of 1999, Discovery's
successful mission to restore the Hubble's recently disabled
pointing control system allowed NASA to bring a difficult year to a
successful end.
</P>
<P>
   The astronauts were to undergo routine medical exams, meet with
close family members and rest in Florida overnight before returning
to their Houston-area homes. Clervoy and Nicollier are assigned to
NASA's astronaut core.
</P>
<P>
   NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston planned a brief public
welcoming ceremony for the Discovery crew at about 6 p.m. EST
Tuesday at Ellington Field.
</P>
<P>
   With three of the longest spacewalks in spaceflight history, the
Discovery astronauts restored the Hubble's recently disabled
pointing control system with the installation of six new gyroscopes
and other upgrades.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers plan to resume celestial observations in about two
weeks. Those activities came to an abrupt halt in mid-November as
the telescope experienced the loss of its fourth gyro in two years.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-day flight that covered more than 3 million miles
proved pivotal for the space agency, which struggled this year to
overcome setbacks in its shuttle, international space station and
unmanned Mars exploration programs.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery lifted off Dec. 19, after a record nine delays that
spanned two months. It was the third mission in a year NASA had
envisioned flying seven or eight times, most with new hardware for
the U.S.-led international space station.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Discovery's long, often deliberate launch campaign
turned into a demonstration of what shuttle program manager Ron
Dittemore characterized as a new resolve by NASA to fly more
safely.
</P>
<P>
   In late July, the shuttle Columbia experienced an electrical
short moments after lift off, jeopardizing the mission. The short
was traced to chaffed insulation in the dozens of miles of
electrical wiring threaded through Columbia's fuselage.
</P>
<P>
   The space agency's response to the close call was to suspend
future shuttle launchings until it could inspect and repair the
wiring on Discovery, Endeavour, Atlantis and Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Though Discovery cleared the wiring gauntlet first, shuttle
managers combed through the ship, calling for additional launching
delays as they encountered other potential safety problems with a
rocket engine, a leaky hydraulic system, external electronic
cabling, a fuel line and welds throughout the propulsion system.
</P>
<P>
   ``This tells everybody that we will not launch until we're ready
and satisfied we're safe to fly,'' Dittmore said Monday night. ``We
will continue to be deliberate.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't mean we won't be aggressive in our scheduling. We
will continue to make improvements. We will continue to find
efficiencies. But we will absolutely be safe above all things.''
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle program faced other more familiar setbacks this year
as well.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's financial difficulties continued to delay its launching
of the international space station's initial crew compartment, or
service module. Intended to house the new station's first resident
astronauts and cosmonauts, the service module is a pacing element
for the shuttle-launched American components that are to follow.
</P>
<P>
   The financial difficulties were further exacerbated by two
failures of Russia's Proton, the unmanned rocket that is to deliver
the service module into orbit. The Russians are nearing the end of
their investigation into the failures as well as the preparation of
a recovery plan.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the service module's launching has slipped into the
spring of 2000, more than two years late, at the earliest, pulling
the shuttle's station assembly flights along with it.
</P>
<P>
   The space agency's biggest disappointment of 1999 had nothing to
do with human spaceflight.
</P>
<P>
   But the loss of two robotic probes, the Mars Polar Lander in
December and the Mars Climate Orbiter in September, disrupted
NASA's ambitious exploration plans for the Red Planet well into the
next decade.
</P>
<P>
   The $372 million investment in the two missions went awry on
both occasions as the probes were completing their transits from
Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The space agency plans to begin revamping its Mars strategy in
the new year.

3 HURT IN CLUB SHOOTINGS; PUFFY COMBS FACES GUN POSSESSION
CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
 (jw) 
 By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sean (Puffy) Combs, the multimillionaire rap
entrepreneur, whose career and lavish East Hampton parties have
been fodder for the gossip columns, was arrested on gun possession
charges with the actress and singer Jennifer Lopez after shots were
fired at a midtown dance club early Monday, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Three people were wounded by gunfire at 2:55 a.m. at Club NY,
which sent panic-stricken clubgoers into the frigid air outside the
nightspot half a block west of Times Square, police and witnesses
said. Police described the victims as bystanders and said that none
of them suffered life-threatening injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Ms. Lopez nor Combs was charged in connection with the
shootings, and Ms. Lopez was later released.
</P>
<P>
   A rap performer, Jamal Barrows, 19, who was in Combs' group, was
charged with three counts of attempted murder and criminal
possession of a weapon, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators later said they were looking into witness accounts
that Barrows fired because he believed that someone had said
something disrespectful to Combs. Prosecutors also said that Combs
drew a gun in the fracas, but, through a spokesman, Combs denied
that he was involved.
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Howard Safir said Combs and Ms. Lopez, who
both fled after the shooting in a 1999 Lincoln Navigator, had been
arrested along with Combs' bodyguard and his driver on gun
possession charges, because a stolen pistol was found in the
vehicle. The Manhattan District Attorney's office later decided to
release Ms. Lopez, saying they had evaluated the evidence and had
declined to prosecute. The gun found in the vehicle was not the
same one used in the shootings in the club, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials said Ms. Lopez, who has appeared in
nearly a dozen films and has been romantically linked to Combs, was
released because she was unaware that the gun was in the car and
because she cooperated with the police.
</P>
<P>
   Combs, 30, who grew up in Harlem, rose from an intern at a small
rap record label to become one of the hip-hop world's leading
impresarios. His successful recording career led to his greater
success as a producer and promoter; he founded his own label, Bad
Boy Records, which he later sold to Arista Records for $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   His entrepreneurial skills have catapulted him from the
street-styled world of rap music to parties with the likes of
Donald Trump and Martha Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   But even as he became renowned as a rap mogul, Combs has also
had brushes with the law, most notably a case this year in which he
was accused of severely beating a record executive.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Klores, a spokesman for Combs, said he was not involved in
the shooting at Club NY and that his client was just trying to get
Ms. Lopez out of harm's way. ``Sean Combs and Jennifer Lopez had
nothing to do with the shooting,'' Klores said. ``We're confident
that the investigation will prove these to be the actual facts.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lopez, 29, was released about 4 p.m. from the Midtown South
precinct station house as fans gathered outside to try to catch a
glimpse of her. She did not speak with reporters, but her lawyer,
Larry Ruggiero, said, ``They established she did nothing wrong.
Jennifer had nothing to do with the gun or the shooting. She's
relieved and glad the truth came out.''
</P>
<P>
   Also arrested were Combs' bodyguard, Anthony Jones, 34, and
Combs' driver, Wardel Fenderson, 41. Police charged Combs, Jones
and Fenderson with criminal possession of a weapon and criminal
possession of stolen property, because the 9 mm Smith &AMP; Wesson
Model 915 pistol found in the Navigator was reported stolen in
August in the small Georgia town of Powder Springs, authorities
said. Jones was also charged with marijuana possession, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the club, investigators recovered four shell casings, two
from a 9 mm pistol and two from a .40-caliber gun, police said. The
9 mm casings were believed to have come from the weapon that police
said Barrows was carrying when he was arrested. It was not clear
who fired the .40-caliber bullets, and no .40-caliber pistol has
been recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Funk, the club's general manager, said Combs and Ms. Lopez
arrived with an entourage of about 30 people sometime after
midnight and spent most of the time in a VIP section that is set
off from the rest of the club by velvet ropes. ``Well wishers came
by, they partied together,'' Funk said.
</P>
<P>
   Funk said club patrons were searched and screened with a metal
detector, but neither he nor the club's owner, Michael Bergos,
could say how the guns got inside the nightspot. Neither man would
discuss the details of the shooting, citing the police
investigation, but both praised Combs and said his behavior had
been exemplary. ``Puff Daddy has been here many times before, he's
always a gentleman, he's never had any problems,'' Funk said.
``He's always a welcome guest here.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Combs and the other three men were scheduled to be arraigned
Monday night in Manhattan Criminal Court. The criminal complaint
filed against Combs by the Manhattan District Attorney's office
said that an unidentified woman who witnessed the shooting
``observed Combs in an argument with another group of individuals
inside the club, whereupon one of the other individuals threw a
stack of money at Combs.''
</P>
<P>
   The complaint charges that Combs and Barrow then ``each pulled
out semiautomatic pistols.''
</P>
<P>
   Police identified the victims of the shooting as Natanya Ruben,
29 and Julius Jones, 27, both of Brooklyn, and Robert Thompson, of
Danbury, Conn. Ms. Ruben, who was shot in the face, and Jones, who
was shot in the shoulder, were both in stable condition Monday
night at St. Vincent's Hospital, said Mark Ackerman, a hospital
spokesman. Thompson refused medical attention, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said that after the shooting inside the club, Combs and
Ms. Lopez ran out and jumped into the car driven by Fenderson. The
Navigator sped down West 43rd Street toward Eighth Avenue and
swerved around a marked police car, its dome lights flashing, that
officers had parked in the middle of the street to close off the
block.
</P>
<P>
   The Navigator sped north on Eighth Avenue, the authorities said,
running 11 red lights before it was pulled over on the northeast
corner of West 54th Street and Eighth Avenue. Combs, Jones,
Fenderson and Ms. Lopez all climbed out of the car and the police
found the gun under the front passenger seat, where Jones had been
riding, authorities said.

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israel's third-largest political party Monday
formalized six months of threats to bolt Prime Minister Ehud
Barak's coalition by announcing its decision to quit the
government.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement shook the country, because the party's
departure would throw the governing coalition into chaos just as it
moved into a critical period, facing key budgetary and peacemaking
deadlines.
</P>
<P>
   Threats by the party, Shas, an ultra-Orthodox group that
represents Sephardic Jews of Middle Eastern and North African
descent, have been a leitmotif of Barak's first six months in
office. As such, many Israelis, including Barak, were skeptical
that the decision was any more ironclad than previous posturing by
the party.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, who seemed unruffled, asked Shas Monday to wait 24 hours
and see what could be resolved, and the party agreed.
</P>
<P>
   The party said it could not remain in a government that did not
adequately support programs for the poor. More specifically, Shas
wants Barak to bail out its government-subsidized school system,
which is $36 million in debt.
</P>
<P>
   The schools, which provide hot meals and the long hours that
working parents need, are Shas' bread and butter, attracting
adherents to its religious and political agenda.
</P>
<P>
   By withdrawing its 17 members of Parliament, Shas would leave
Barak with a minority government of 51 out of 120 members. Small
parties and Arab parties that are nominally in the opposition can
be expected to keep Barak's government from falling.
</P>
<P>
   But it would be a destabilizing event at a sensitive moment, as
Barak heads into intensified peace negotiations with the
Palestinians and Syria. If those negotiations lead to a peace
treaty, Shas' support would be critical in an ensuing national
referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Shas' decision was made on the basis of a telephone poll of each
rabbi in the ``council of sages'' that guides its politicians, led
by the chief sage, Rabbi Ovadia Yosef.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made a clear and unequivocal announcement,'' said Eli
Yishai, 38, the party's current leader. ``We don't play with
announcements. The prime minister asked us to wait 24 hours. We
will respect this. We will wait 24 hours. The rabbis' decisions
still stands. What will be in 24 hours, I don't know. At any rate,
we have to go back to the rabbis.''
</P>
<P>
   Shas has been an unstable partner in Barak's broad-based
coalition. With its relatively dovish rabbis, it was enlisted as a
potential ally for the peace effort, against vocal opposition from
Barak's secular supporters.
</P>
<P>
   But from the beginning, in true Israeli marketplace style, Shas
has conditioned its support on financing for its indebted religious
school system and social welfare programs.
</P>
<P>
   Shas' announcement came against the backdrop of frenzied
negotiations for next year's budget, which Israeli law requires to
be approved by Friday, although an extension is permissible. As
usual, when speaking of Shas, Barak adopted a conciliatory tone and
said he was sure that the crisis would fade.
</P>
<P>
   In a broadcast speech to his Labor/One Israel Party at
parliament Monday, he urged Israelis to recognize the key role of
Shas and how far it had come in the last year, since its leader,
Aryeh Deri, was convicted of corruption and stepped down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The movement of Shas is important to the government of
Israeli, to its diplomatic route,'' Barak said. ``It is the
third-largest faction in the Parliament. It is a popular,
broad-based movement that maintains very sober, responsible and
balanced positions in terms of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I say this because we often hear voices that lose their
patience _ look honestly at the road traveled by Shas in the last
year, and at the road we have traveled together contrary to all
predictions.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, empathy for Shas did not abound Monday. Yosef
Lapid, leader of the Shinui Party, which won six votes on the basis
of an anti-religious platform, said he did not consider Shas'
threats to be serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is much ado about nothing,'' he said. ``This is another
extortionist trick by Shas that will be concluded in the coming 24
or 48 or 72 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Barak surprised many of the secular dovish Israelis who voted
for him when he reached out to Shas to form a coalition. He decided
that he could count on the party for support in the peace effort,
while accepting that frictions between religious and secular
Israelis would persist.
</P>
<P>
   On the peace front, Shas has been flexing its muscles since
Israeli-Syrian negotiations resumed in Washington this month.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's intention to seek peace with Syria was no secret to
Shas; it was in the government's guidelines when Shas made the
decision to join.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Rabbi Yitzhak Kadouri, an elderly cabbalist rabbi with a
big following, proclaimed himself opposed to a withdrawal from the
Golan Heights, and on Sunday flew to a Golan kibbutz. There, he was
carried aloft in a chair, a knitted prayer shawl draped over his
tarboosh hat, as he blessed the kibbutzniks in Hebrew mumbles that
required Hebrew subtitles on the Israeli evening news.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   If Shas is treated like a ``stepson,'' said Yishai, the party
leader, it cannot ``take responsibility for the diplomatic
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Yosef has not yet ruled on the future of the Golan. He is
considered unlikely to urge his followers to vote down a peace
agreement if the alternative is the likelihood of violence. But
since his voice carries so much power, President Ezer Weizman
visited him in his home on Sunday night to lobby him to support the
peace initiative with Syria.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, Shas was believed to have been pushed to the
edge by a maneuver by Finance Minister Avraham Shohat. To get the
budget bill through the Finance Committee without Shas' votes,
Shohat struck deals with two other religious parties _ the National
Religious Party, a coalition partner, and United Torah Judaism, an
opposition party _ agreeing to meet their budgetary demands of some
$40 million.
</P>
<P>
   While showing Shas that it is not indispensable, the end run
also bruised its feelings. Experts on Shas say Yosef thinks the
party has suffered a series of humiliations under Barak _ from
accepting Deri's resignation under protest to giving up the
Interior Ministry and dismissing its school superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Radio said early Monday that Shas leaders met with Ariel
Sharon, leader of the opposition Likud Party, and received his
assurance that Likud would not rush in to take its place and
bolster the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have made it clear on many occasions, and I will reiterate
that we have no intention of joining this failing government,''
Sharon said later. ``We will not serve as a tool in the hands of
Mr. Barak to put pressure on any partner in the coalition.''

EXIT INTERVIEW SHOULD BE HANDLED WITH GRACE
</HEADLINE>

in the ``f'' financial news file. Send your questions to P.O. Box

By KEN LLOYD  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: I will be giving two weeks' notice to leave after the first
of the year. The problem is that our manager insists on exit
interviews, and I have heard from others that the session is
stressful and filled with harsh questions and insulting comments. I
don't know if I should just sit there, fight back, or try to avoid
the interview altogether. E.S.
</P>
<P>
   A: In the words of Jerry Seinfeld, your manager sounds like a
``bad breaker upper.'' Exit interviews are not supposed to be a
time to grind an employee down with brutal questioning, nor a time
to put an employee down with derogatory comments.
</P>
<P>
   It makes far more sense for management to use these interviews
as an opportunity to learn about the employees' perceptions of the
company and the reasons for wanting to leave. These interviews can
provide management with an excellent opportunity to gather valuable
data that can lead to reduced turnover.
</P>
<P>
   Although you have the option of avoiding the exit interview
altogether, it is possible that much of the talk that you have
heard about these interviews is exaggerated. And if you enter this
interview expecting the worst, you are actually increasing the
likelihood of a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   You should go to the session, listen to what your manager has to
say, and then use a calm and businesslike approach to provide some
specific feedback on the company and on this session if warranted.
Let your final act with the company be a class act.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The owner of the small company where I work is wonderful, but
we have all noticed that he is more forgetful, short-fused and
argumentative in the afternoons. We know that he has a drink or two
at lunch, and we think this is part of it, but none of us want to
tell him. How should we handle this? B.T.
</P>
<P>
   A: It is entirely possible that the happy hour at lunch can lead
to the nasty hours shortly thereafter. At the same time, the change
in the owner's behavior can be due to a number of other
physiological factors.
</P>
<P>
   If the owner is truly ``wonderful,'' then you should have an
open, honest and communicative working relationship with him. If
you and some of your associates are particularly close to him, you
may be doing him a huge favor by meeting with him to talk about
what you have observed.
</P>
<P>
   It is very important to set the right stage for this type of
meeting. Obviously, it should be in the morning, and on a
relatively quiet day at work. The discussion should be private,
confidential, and free of interruptions.
</P>
<P>
   You are not meeting with him to criticize or complain. Your
messages should be that you have noticed some behaviors that do not
seem like him, you are concerned about his health, and you want to
know if there is anything you can do to help. Give him examples of
the specific behaviors, and then let him talk.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, you have done all you can do. The question then
becomes whether he will do likewise.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Several months ago, one of my associates' desk drawers was
jammed. No one could open it, but I have a small set of tools in my
office. I went over, unscrewed part of the drawer, and got it open.
The problem is that since then, I have become the informal office
handyman. This is a major interruption, but it is hard to say no.
What can I do? T.K.
</P>
<P>
   A: Do you have any idea how hard it is to find a good handyman?!
All right, it's true, your associates are taking advantage of you
and your handy skills.
</P>
<P>
   You solved one small problem with a screwdriver, and by doing so
created a huge problem for yourself. Once the word of your skills
got out, it was just a matter of time before you jumped to the top
of everyone's speed dial.
</P>
<P>
   There are a couple of ways to deal with this. While it may be
tempting to trash a few jobs so that the word gets out that you
have lost your touch, that could have other repercussions. A better
approach is for you to be honest with the people who use you as a
tool. Let them know that you are too busy, and suggest that they
call building maintenance or whomever else the company suggests in
such situations.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, if you enjoy tinkering and the recognition and
accomplishment that go with it, you should pick and choose the jobs
you like and do them when the time is right for you. After all, if
you spend too much time unjamming drawers, you will find yourself
in a far bigger jam.

EDITORIAL: THE DEFINING STYLES OF CAPITALISM 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Dec. 27:
</P>
<P>
   Malt liquors and boots were among America's 10 largest
industries at the beginning of the 20th century. A third of
Americans worked in agriculture. Fifty years later, cars, aircraft
and chemical manufacturing dominated the economy and only about 4
percent of Americans worked in agriculture. The United States
started the century on an economic par with Great Britain. By the
middle of the century, living standards were 50 percent higher in
the United States than in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at the end of the century, Americans, mostly employed in
white-collar jobs, account for only 4 percent of the world's
population but for more than 20 percent of its output. The American
brand of capitalism _ democratic, lightly regulated and full of
opportunities for individuals to fail as well as succeed _is widely
seen as a model for others to emulate. As the end of the century
draws near, there is no longer any doubt that the state-dominated
economies that competed with capitalism for much of the modern era
have failed. Less clear than many Americans might imagine, however,
is which model of capitalism _American, European or Japanese _ is
likely to prove most dominant in the decades ahead.
</P>
<P>
   America's economic success began before this century. The
country had abundant natural resources from the start, and in the
19th century, immigration and huge investments in railroads helped
create a continent-expanding economy. Entrepreneurs developed the
``American system'' of interchangeable parts, first in firearms, to
cut down the costs of producing complex products. In the 20th
century came the assembly line, churning out cars that workers
could afford. Long before Europe, the United States provided free
high school education, laying the foundation for a knowledge-based
economy. From the 1920s on, economic growth was tied to
science-based technologies, and in the 50 years after 1910 output
per hour more than tripled.
</P>
<P>
   A mostly hands-off, decentralized system rewarded personal
skills, entrepreneurial investment and innovation. The flexibility
of largely unfettered labor markets also helped the economy triple
in size in the 30 years following World War II. More people working
with more machines account for some of the growth. But most of the
spectacular gains arose from something more profound: educated
people working with smarter machines. By 1975, productivity _
output per worker _ was twice as high in the United States as in
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The economy has been so hot in the past few years that there is
a natural temptation to declare that America's freewheeling
``cowboy'' capitalism has triumphed permanently over European or
Japanese versions. But economic historians, taking the longer view,
consider such a conclusion premature. Each of the models has its
own strengths and each has stumbled at times in recent decades.
</P>
<P>
   The American economy, for instance, stalled in the 1970s after
the oil price shocks. For nearly two decades unemployment rates
remained high and wages of all but the highest-paid workers
stagnated. Inequality soared. Americans looked abroad for answers.
Europe's system of generous social insurance and regulated labor
markets produced comparable living standards and more equal income
distribution. But then unemployment took hold. In the 1980s
attention turned to the success of Japan's system of corporate
cartels and lifetime employment. But by the 1990s Japan had entered
a decade-long slumber.
</P>
<P>
   Attention returned to America's hurly-burly economy, which has
achieved the lowest unemployment in the industrialized world in
part by throwing millions of people out of work each year only to
hire them back (in different jobs) along with millions more. The
United States prospered in part because of the accelerating pace of
globalization and technological change. Rapid change puts a premium
on flexibility, America's greatest economic asset. Europe's more
stable system of long-term employment may return to favor in more
tranquil times.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for all these ups and downs, economists and historians
see more similarities than differences among successful economies
in Japan, Europe and the United States. All are vibrant, literate,
science-oriented democracies with a base of private property. They
rely on relatively open markets, trade and mature legal systems for
resolving conflicts. None of the governments are hands-off. All of
them, including the United States, tightly regulate financial
markets. The current dominance of the American model rests, in
historic terms, on a fleeting experience. Only in the last few
years of the current recovery has the economy created both large
employment gains and wage increases.
</P>
<P>
   But for scholars reflecting on the economic history of the
century, there can be no doubt on one central point. Measured by
the feature that best defines economic prosperity _ productivity
growth _ the market economies of the United States, Western Europe
and Japan far outpaced state-run, autocratic, anti-trade regimes
throughout Latin America and Africa.

BRUINS READY TO MAX OUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With one week to prepare for Pac-10 play, UCLA has
two issues to address. The Bruins must improve their half-court
offense _ an ongoing and well-documented deficiency _ and they must
learn to generate maximum effort against less-talented opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're so talented, but the only thing is that we take teams
for granted,'' freshman forward Jason Kapono said. ``It's the
so-called weaker teams from the so-called weaker conferences, like
Colorado State. If we're playing Stanford and Arizona, we know we
have to bring it.''
</P>
<P>
   In that respect, tonight's opponent, Pepperdine, has created its
own predicament.
</P>
<P>
   The Waves have played well under first-year coach Jan van Breda
Kolff. But in beating Colorado State (by 10) and Detroit Mercy (by
22), the Waves inadvertently grabbed UCLA's attention. After all,
the Bruins lost to Colorado State last week, and they lost to
Detroit Mercy in the NCAA Tournament nine months ago. Given the
comparative scores, there seems little chance of them snoozing
through Pepperdine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Detroit _ we've definitely talked about that,'' Bruins coach
Steve Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   The Waves also played well against Auburn (11-point loss) and
Kansas (15-point loss).
</P>
<P>
   ``Pepperdine has played well, but it's more about ourselves,''
Lavin said. ``When we play for 40 minutes, we're pretty good. But
when we play for 20 minutes, anybody can beat us.''
</P>
<P>
   Making progress? Point guard Earl Watson's totals from the Pearl
Harbor Classic _ 19 assists, 10 turnovers, 53.5 percent shooting,
several clutch baskets _ drew high praise from Lavin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he had a breakthrough three days, across the board,''
Lavin said. ``He showed poise and composure. When teams made runs
at us, he didn't panic.''
</P>
<P>
   Will Watson show the same poise when Arizona and Stanford turn
up the pressure?
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a Rook: Freshman Brandon Brooks, the water polo
goalie who joined the basketball team recently to bolster a
depleted frontline, looked good in his first practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's impressed me as much as any walk-on, who's a freshman, in
my nine years,'' Lavin said. ``He has a good feel for the game. He
works hard. He sets screens. He's very competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks, a Honolulu native, has been placed on a basketball
scholarship, per NCAA rules. He grabbed one rebound against Maine
in the Pearl Harbor Classic _ his only appearance thus far _ and
he's fifth in the frontcourt rotation, behind Jerome Moiso, Dan
Gadzuric, Matt Barnes and Sean Farnham.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes made 8 of 15 shots in Hawaii in his first games back from
fall-quarter academic suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Rush update: Suspended forward JaRon Rush did not return to
campus with his teammates on Dec. 26. Instead, he's at home in
Kansas City working with his legal counsel. Rush is due back when
school starts next week, perhaps earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In a related development, Rush's brother, Kareem, a Missouri
freshman, was suspended for 13 games by the NCAA for taking a few
hundred dollars from former AAU coach Myron Piggie. That's not good
news for Rush, whose financial relationship with Piggie was deeper
than Kareem's, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri will appeal. &QL;

INDUSTRY REDISCOVERS BASIC RESEARCH 
</HEADLINE>
  (SUBS to change $75 billion to $70 billion in 6th graf and 82
percent to 79 percent in 10th graf.) 
(mk) 
 By WILLIAM J. BROAD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   American industry is pouring extraordinary sums of money into
research and development in an effort to nurture strong growth,
private and federal officials are reporting.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had once feared that American industry in the 1990s,
faced with rising global competition, tightening budgets and
growing demands for quick profitability from investors, was quietly
abandoning the kind of high-risk research that historically has
produced the biggest payoffs and breakthroughs. Worrisome examples
cited by experts are W.R. Grace and Eastman Chemical, which
recently closed the doors on corporate laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   But a new study by the Industrial Research Institute, a
nonprofit group in Washington that represents large companies, says
overall trends turn out to be strongly the opposite _ and federal
officials in interviews echoed the upbeat numbers and analyses.
</P>
<P>
   The report, titled ``Basic Research in Industry,'' is based on
federal data and institute surveys, and concludes, ``Industry is
doing more long-range, high-risk, discovery-type research than ever
before.'' It was released on Dec. 15 by Charles F. Larson,
executive director of the institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was amazed at the growth,'' Larson said in an interview.
``I've been sensing this for some time but was delighted to find
that it was true in terms of the hard numbers. It's a new era.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1994 to 1999, the study said, American industrial research
and development grew to a projected $166 billion from $97.1
billion, a rise of 71 percent, or slightly less if adjusted for
inflation, and in any case more than double the spending of the
federal government, which in 1999 is putting about $70 billion into
research and development. Until the 1980s, the government was the
nation's unrivaled research leader as it probed new frontiers with
innovative technology from atom smashers to orbiting telescopes.
</P>
<P>
   By soaring during the past five years, industrial research and
development is rebounding from a flat period in the early 1990s,
when companies cut back on research in an effort to try to raise
efficiencies and cut redundancies. By 1992, Japan was seen as
having equaled or surpassed the United States as the world's top
patron of industrial research and development, giving it a powerful
weapon in the trade wars to produce a new wave of innovative goods
and services.
</P>
<P>
   But America is now indisputably back on top, with Japanese
industry spending some $95 billion last year, far less than the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the industrial money goes into the relatively prosaic
work of development, like engineering, making prototypes and
testing products. A lesser amount goes into applied research, which
focuses on making new products, processes and services for
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   A major surprise of the study, Larson said, is that directed
basic research _ the blue-sky pursuit of products and services that
might lie a decade in the future _ has grown even faster than
overall research and development in the past half decade. It is up
79 percent, to $10.9 billion in 1999 from $6.1 billion in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The Industrial Research Institute found that the rise came
mainly from companies doing business in the life and information
sciences, including enterprises like Cisco Systems, Compaq
Computer, Lilly &AMP; Co., Lucent Technologies, Merck &AMP; Co., Microsoft,
Monsanto and Sun Microsystems. Microsoft is reportedly investing 17
percent of its sales in research and development, and many
companies are putting in more.
</P>
<P>
   The feverish growth, Larson said, comes in reaction to strong
global competition and is made possible by healthy corporate
profits and cash flows. Other factors, he said, include the spread
of the idea that the economy is increasingly knowledge-driven, and
that raising intellectual capital is a good way to manage the
corporate enterprise for growth in sales, profits and shareholder
value.
</P>
<P>
   He added that many companies, including Intel, Hewlett-Packard,
Lucent, IBM, Texas Instruments and Xerox, have begun ``skunk
works,'' or independent start-ups, to help foster innovation.
</P>
<P>
   John E. Jankowski, a financial analyst at the National Science
Foundation, a federal agency that tracks science spending, said
that the Industrial Research Institute study was right on target.
``Our statistics show strong positive growth,'' he said. ``We've
had a very positive trend in terms of industrial research and
development.''

SPORTS COLUMN: GIANTS LACK PLAYOFF-TYPE PERFORMERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Giants fans are a peculiar mix of
contradictions. They have confidence born of deep tradition and the
equally deep insecurity of never being able to recapture that
glorious past. Unlike Jets fans who look for misery in every silver
lining, Giant fans look at two-game winning streaks as a return to
the empire the Giants once knew.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants destroyed the Jets and upset the Bills. In the Jets
game, Coach Jim Fassel turned the play-calling over to Sean Payton,
and before we knew it the airways were proclaiming Payton as the
new offensive guru. After the victory over Buffalo, fans became so
enamored of Kerry Collins, saying he had finally found a home, and
they predicted a victory over the Rams. Last week some experts who
should have known better predicted a Giant victory over Minnesota.
The Giants were routed in each game.
</P>
<P>
   So, at 11 a.m. Monday, Fassel walked briskly to a podium to face
a polite but withering series of questions about the 34-17 loss to
Minnesota and the lost opportunity of securing a place in the
playoffs. Why hadn't the Giants taken advantage of Robert Tate, the
Vikings' wide receiver turned defensive back? Why did they settle
for a field goal when they needed 6 points at the end of the third
quarter?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very disappointed with the way we played,'' Fassel said.
``I'll be honest with you, I thought we were ready to come play
this game. I thought our players focused in on all the right things
that we did during the week. Obviously we didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   You'd think from the nature of the questions that the Giants
were the team of the century that had lost to the lowly Cincinnati
Bengals. What Fassel should have said was: ``Look, Minnesota is
better than we are, 17 points better. They are an explosive,
veteran team with money players. We're just the Giants and we'll be
just the Giants until we get some explosive players.''
</P>
<P>
   No one fears the Giants; no one spends extra time preparing for
a Giant weapon. Against Buffalo, the Giants had to stop Doug Flutie
and Bruce Smith. Against St. Louis, they had to contain Kurt Warner
at quarterback, Marshall Faulk in the backfield and the Rams'
speedy wide receivers. While preparing for Minnesota, they had to
devise ways to stop Randy Moss, watch Cris Carter, key on Robert
Smith and hope that Jeff George would have an off day.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday against Dallas, the Giants have to prepare for Troy
Aikman, Emmitt Smith and Deion Sanders. Opponents talk about what
the Giants like to do, not which Giants they have to stop. The
Giants always bear the burden of having to stop somebody.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' locker room door opened at 11:30 Monday morning. A
group of players huddled and talked about playoff possibilities.
One said that if Green Bay won, the Giants would have to beat
Dallas by 70 points to win the tie breaker. Everyone laughed.
Someone from the Giants' public-relations staff came around and
gave the players a two-page playoff scenario. If Green Bay wins,
the Giants are out. If Green Bay loses and the Giants beat Dallas,
the Giants are in.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel threw down the gauntlet to his players to play at a
championship level. Problem is, none of the current Giants knows
what that means; no one has played on a Giants championship team.
Phillippi Sparks, in his eighth season, came to the Giants in 1992,
a year after the Giants' last Super Bowl appearance. Jessie
Armstead and Michael Strahan came in 1993. Jason Sehorn came in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' front office has to find a way to get dynamic
players who can provide answers to the challenges that a team like
Minnesota posed on Sunday: Moss throws a perfect option pass to
Carter; Moe Williams returns a kickoff 85 yards; Smith breaks a
70-yard touchdown run. The Giants' offense could only manage a
field goal and a plodding time-consuming touchdown drive in the
second half.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways the option pass from Moss to Carter underlines not
just the game but the disparity in big-play talent between the
Giants and elite teams like the Vikings. ``It took a great throw;
Moss made a great throw,'' Fassel said. ``That's what I'm talking
about. They made a great throw. It wasn't like we blew it or just
didn't know it was coming; we knew it was coming.''
</P>
<P>
   The shortsighted Giants fan will wonder if the team will make
the playoffs. The farsighted fan sits and wonders whether the
Giants will get championship players on the field. Will they ever
rebuild the Big Blue Empire?
</P>
<P>
   On afternoons like last Sunday, the empire seems several
marshlands away. &QL;

 By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Harold L. Fisher, a lawyer who played a prominent
role in Democratic politics in New York for several decades and
also served as a chairman of New York state's Metropolitan
Transportation Authority, died Sunday at his home in Fort
Lauderdale, Fla. He was 89.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher, sometimes called ``Mr. Brooklyn,'' was appointed to the
board of the authority, when it was created by Gov. Nelson
Rockefeller in 1968. He became vice chairman in 1975, acting
chairman in January 1977 and chairman in April 1977, serving in
that post through 1979.
</P>
<P>
   As head of the authority, Fisher may be best known for
negotiating two labor agreements without a strike or a fare
increase during the fiscal crisis of the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher was also a crucial behind-the-scenes adviser in New York
City's fiscal crisis, thanks to friendships he formed years earlier
with Gov. Hugh Carey, Mayor Abraham Beame and Democratic Party
leaders like Carmine DeSapio and Meade Esposito, as well as
Republicans like Assemblyman Perry Duryea.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was indispensable,'' said Edward Koch, who was mayor during
the late '70s. ``Without him we wouldn't have actually been able to
do all these things we did, namely prevent strikes. People
respected him.''
</P>
<P>
   Although his political career overshadowed his law practice,
Fisher was known for his legal skills, too, particularly his
knowledge of the state's election laws. He once ordered a car
driven into the freight elevator at the Board of Elections
building, taken to the Board of Election's floor and clocked in _
all because the filing petitions for party candidates were locked
in the trunk, the lock would not open and the filing deadline was
minutes away.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher also made a name for himself in commercial law. Once,
acting as the lawyer for creditors of sugar companies and an
airline expropriated by the Cuban government after the communist
revolution, he seized the airplane that brought Fidel Castro to New
York for his first U.N. session. Only after the U.S. State
Department intervened was the plane released.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what his secret for success was, Fisher said in an
interview with The New York Times in 1978: ``I don't have a great
ego, but I'm smart. I know the personalities around town. I don't
lie. I keep my word and I keep my mouth shut.''
</P>
<P>
   Harold Leonard Fisher was born on the Lower East Side of
Manhattan on Dec. 10, 1910. He attended New York University for a
year before entering St. John's University College of Law, where he
graduated in 1932. After a law firm clerkship, he opened a law
practice in 1935 in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, he served on a local draft board. After the
war, he traveled to Europe on behalf of Jewish refugee
organizations to resettle Jewish orphans. He was also active in
raising funds and supplies for the Irgun, the militant underground
organization fighting for Israeli independence.
</P>
<P>
   In 1948, Fisher returned to the United States and moved his
office to Brooklyn, where he was to practice law for more than 40
years. In 1992, he returned his practice, now known as Fisher,
Fisher &AMP; Berger, to Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   In 1959, he became assistant counsel to the minority leader of
the New York state Assembly, Anthony Travia. Fisher then helped
Travia become Assembly speaker after the 1964 elections. For the
next five years, Fisher served as counsel to the speaker, helping
to shape the revision of New York's divorce law and other
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher also served from 1971 to 1976 on the board of Centro, the
mass transit authority for the Syracuse area, and as chairman of
the American Public Transit Association. He was chairman of
Convention Center Development Corp., which built the Jacob K.
Javits Convention Center in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, President Carter asked him to join the U.S. delegation,
invited by President Anwar Sadat of Egypt, to witness the transfer
of control of Mount Sinai under the Camp David Accords.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher's wife, Betty Kahn, to whom he was married for almost 63
years, died in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by five children, Leonard of Danville, Calif.;
Alice Fisher Rubin of New York, Stephanie Cooper Harrison of
Asheville, N.C., Andrew and Kenneth, both of New York; 11
grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.

WOODROW BORAH, AN EXPERT ON SPANISH CONQUEST OF MEXICO, DIES AT
86  
(DW)

<P>
   Woodrow Borah, a former professor of Latin American history at
the University of California at Berkeley who documented the
decimation of Mexico's native population resulting from the Spanish
conquest, died on Dec. 10 at Kaiser Hospital in Oakland, Calif. He
was 86 and lived in Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Working with a colleague, Sherburne F. Cook, Borah began by
studying the impact of the Spanish conquest and colonialization on
the native populations in Mexico and elsewhere in Mesoamerica.
</P>
<P>
   There were no surviving written records of population size
before the Spanish arrived in 1520, but Borah and his colleague
made reliable estimates based on records of food production and
other indicators.
</P>
<P>
   They discovered that between the early 16th century and the
middle of the 17th century, native population in Mesoamerica fell
from about 10 million to 2 million.
</P>
<P>
   They identified the chief causes as the Spaniards' imposition of
rapid-paced labor and the epidemics of diseases transmitted by
Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   Born on Dec. 23, 1912, in Utica, Miss., Borah graduated from
high school in Los Angeles and attended the University of
California at Berkeley, where he earned his bachelor's, master's
and doctoral degrees.
</P>
<P>
   He taught briefly at Princeton University before joining the
U.S.State Department as an analyst in the Office of Strategic
Services during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   He joined Berkeley's history department in 1948 and retired in
1980.
</P>
<P>
   Borah is survived by his wife, Terry; a son, Jonathan, of
Oakland, and a daughter, Ruth Borah of Voorschoten, the
Netherlands.

ATLANTIC CITY, DIES

 (ATTN: N.J., Pa., Md.)  
 JOSEPH L. McGAHN, A LEADER IN BRINGING GAMBLING INDUSTRY To By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joseph Leo McGahn, a New Jersey obstetrician who, as a
Democratic state senator, paved the way for Atlantic City's
gambling industry in the 1970s, died Friday at Meadowview Nursing
Home in Northfield, N.J. A longtime resident of Absecon, N.J., he
was 82.
</P>
<P>
   McGahn represented Atlantic City and its environs in Trenton for
two terms from 1972 to 1978. He was chairman of the Committee on
Agriculture, Energy and the Environment.
</P>
<P>
   He was the principal architect of the legislation that opened
the gates for the casino industry, with its aim of economic revival
for Atlantic City. He also pressed for state supervision of that
industry with what was then described as the toughest casino
regulations in the world.
</P>
<P>
   McGahn was an Absecon councilman and mayor before announcing his
candidacy for the Senate, in a county in which registered
Republicans heavily outnumbered Democrats. He defeated the
incumbent, Sen. Frank S. (Hap) Farley, the dean of the upper
chamber and Republican boss of South Jersey, in 1971. He ran
without the blessings of the Democratic establishment, as he did
when he won re-election in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   He lost the Democratic primary in 1977, ran as an independent
and lost to Steven P. Perskie, a Democratic assemblyman with whom
he had worked closely to put the casino legislation before the
voters in a referendum. In 1981 he tried again, this time running
as a Republican, and lost again to Perskie.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph McGahn was born in Atlantic City, graduated summa cum
laude from St. Mary's College in Emmitsburg, Md., in 1939 and
received his medical degree at the University of Pittsburgh in
1943. He served as a general surgeon in the Army Medical Corps in
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   He practiced general medicine and surgery in Atlantic City until
1951, when he began to specialize in obstetrics and gynecology. He
was an emergency-room physician at the Atlantic City Medical Center
until 1984, after which he became medical director at Resorts
International, retiring in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   McGahn's wife, Joanne, died two years ago. He is survived by two
sons, Joseph P. and Michael, both of Egg Harbor, N.J.; two
brothers, Donald of Brigantine, N.J., and Patrick of Margate, N.J.;
and two grandsons.

KANSAS CITY BOARD OF TRADE ENHANCES SOME TRADING CONTRACTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By VICTORIA SIZEMORE LONG  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The Kansas City Board of Trade has taken
several steps to enhance some of its trading contracts.
</P>
<P>
   On the exchange's Isdex Internet stock-index contract, the
exchange has added the companies Scient and Intraware and removed
CDNow and Axent Technologies}.
</P>
<P>
   Isdex, the Internet Stock Index created by internet.com Corp.,
contains 50 stocks of publicly traded U.S. companies that derive
revenue primarily from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Isdex is reviewed on a regular basis to add or delete stocks
that best represent Internet diversity for investors.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the exchange has approved plans to simplify its
offerings on its Value Line stock index.
</P>
<P>
   Pending approval by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission,
the Kansas City Board of Trade will eliminate its Value Line stock
index futures contract with a value of $250 times the futures
price. The exchange also will drop the word ``Mini'' from its Mini
Value Line futures and options contract with a value of $100 times
the futures price.
</P>
<P>
   This will leave the exchange trading one futures and options
contract called the Value Line, with the same $100 multiplier that
has previously been referred to as the ``Mini.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This change will simplify the exchange's offering in the Value
Line, while maintaining the product that customers have gravitated
toward,'' said Michael Braude, president of the exchange.
``Smaller-sized stock index contracts truly are the wave of the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   The changes are expected to take effect March 20, the first
business day following the March 2000 futures contract expiration.

DEVILS END A LOSING PATTERN WITH VICTORY OVER SABRES 
</HEADLINE>

 By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ For 10 days at least, the New Jersey
Devils will not have to deal with the question of why they can't
seem to win on the second night of back-to-back games.
</P>
<P>
   They put an end to that streak of futility Monday night with a
4-1 triumph over the Buffalo Sabres before a crowd of 16,248 at
Continental Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils had dropped the second of two games on consecutive
nights eight straight times this season. On Sunday, they played the
Rangers to a 3-3 tie, so Monday night they faced the situation
again. The Devils don't have another such scenario until they meet
the Sabres again on Jan. 6 in Buffalo, a night after they play in
Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Petr Sykora, John Madden and Patrik Elias scored the goals for
the Devils, against Martin Biron, with Sykora getting two goals.
Biron was replaced at the start of the third period by Dwayne
Roloson, who was removed for an extra skater before Sykora got an
empty-net goal with 5.8 seconds to play.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres (15-16-5) fired 20 shots at Martin Brodeur of the
Devils (20-12-4), whose only lapse was a goal he allowed to Geoff
Sanderson early in the third period, after the Devils had built a
3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils were leading by three goals after two periods. Two of
the goals came after Sabres turnovers at their blue line.
</P>
<P>
   Sykora scored the game's first goal, with 6:54 left in the
opening period. He stole the puck from Cory Sarich and went in
alone on Biron, beating him over the glove with a backhander. It
was Sykora's ninth goal, but only his first in the last 12 games.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest play in the first two periods came 12:17 into the
second. With the Sabres on a power play, Madden swiped the puck at
the Buffalo blue line and skated in alone on Biron, beating him
with a rising shot.
</P>
<P>
   It Madden's seventh of the season and his league-leading third
short-handed goal. He was left out of the lineup a day earlier in
the tie against the Rangers, and he worked hard to impress Coach
Robbie Ftorek, who used him to kill penalties Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres' intensity fell noticeably after Madden's goal and
the Devils scored their third goal just over five minutes later
when Elias' shot from the slot got past Biron. It was his seventh
goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres failed on all five man advantages they had in the
first two periods, underscoring why their power play is last in the
league.

3 HURT IN CLUB SHOOTINGS; PUFFY COMBS FACES GUN POSSESSION
CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This article is part of TIMES EXPRESS. It is a condensed
version of a story that will appear in tomorrow's New York Times.)

 By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sean (Puffy) Combs, the multimillionaire rap
entrepreneur, whose career and East Hampton parties have been
fodder for the gossip columns, was arrested on gun possession
charges with actress and singer Jennifer Lopez after shots were
fired at a Midtown dance club early Monday, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Three people were wounded by gunfire at 2:55 a.m. at Club NY,
half a block west of Times Square, police said. Police described
the victims as bystanders and said that none suffered
life-threatening injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Ms. Lopez nor Combs was charged in connection with the
shootings; Ms. Lopez was later released.
</P>
<P>
   A rap performer, Jamal Barrows, 19, who was in Combs' group, was
charged with three counts of attempted murder and criminal
possession of a weapon, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors also said that Combs drew a gun in the fracas, but,
through a spokesman, Combs denied that he was involved. An
arraignment was scheduled for late Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Howard Safir said Combs, 30, and Ms. Lopez,
29, who both fled after the shooting, were arrested along with
Combs' bodyguard and his driver on gun possession charges, because
a stolen pistol was found in the vehicle. The Manhattan District
Attorney's office later decided to release Ms. Lopez, saying they
had evaluated the evidence and had declined to prosecute. The gun
found in the vehicle was not the same one used in the shootings in
the club, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Ms. Lopez, who has been romantically linked to
Combs, was released because she was unaware that the gun was in the
car and because she cooperated with the police.
</P>
<P>
   Also arrested were Combs' bodyguard, Anthony Jones, 34, and
Combs' driver, Wardel Fenderson, 41. Police charged Combs, Jones
and Fenderson with criminal possession of a weapon and criminal
possession of stolen property, because the 9-millimeter Smith &AMP;
Wesson Model 915 pistol found in the Navigator was reported stolen
in Georgia, authorities said. Jones was also charged with marijuana
possession, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Funk, the club's general manager, said Combs and Ms. Lopez
arrived with an entourage of about 30 after midnight and spent most
of the time in a VIP section set off from the rest of the club by
velvet ropes.
</P>
<P>
   Funk said club patrons were searched and screened with a metal
detector, but he could not say how the guns got inside.

WHAT TO WEAR TO STAY HOME NEW YEAR'S EVE; PLUS THE APPOINTMENT OF A
FASHION CRITIC

 By GINIA BELLAFANTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a recent Time/CNN poll indicated, 72 percent of Americans
have no plans to do anything special on this New Year's Eve of all
New Years' Eves, despite the hoopla that has surrounded this coming
Friday night for the latter part of the decade. But for many, doing
something unextraordinary doesn't translate into wearing something
ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who think one should get dressed up,'' said
Elle's fashion director, Marin Hopper. ``On the other hand, you
think to yourself, `Who makes the best pajamas?'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hopper, who, like most other people, plans to hole up with
family and close friends for the holiday, said she was thinking
about vintage '60s Jean Muir, or maybe sleepwear from Kate Spade.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ms. Hopper remains a part of that rare faction of the
shopping public for whom the name Jean Muir means something, her
problem _ what to wear to do not much _ is apparently gripping
many. Salespeople in and out of New York say they have received
many requests from customers in the last few weeks for advice on
outfitting themselves for sitting in their living rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Nanette DiFalco, the director of personal shopping at Saks Fifth
Avenue, said that people have come to her proclaiming: ``I've
decided to stay at home. I want to look special.''
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, women are choosing to achieve that specialness
with more or less the same look. ``In the last month and a half,
people have gone hostessy,'' said Kathleen Kruer in San Diego, who
bears the imposing title high-fashion wardrobe coordinator for
Nordstrom.
</P>
<P>
   That is to say that Ms. Kruer's clients (they number more than a
few, given that she is Nordstrom's highest grossing sales
representative nationwide) are opting for full-length, A-line
skirts _ ``hostess skirts'' as they are known _ to hold
get-togethers at home or to attend them at someone else's.
</P>
<P>
   The skirts are generally made from some variation of silk. Ms.
Kruer, who said she had not had a single request for a beaded gown
for this New Year's Eve, has sold hostess skirts by Donna Karan,
Vera Wang and Valentino, among others. Workshop, a fashionable
boutique in San Francisco, has done well with hostess skirts in
tulle from the Italian label Oneday. Banana Republic is offering
them in crinkled, pastel silk versions. Because so many people are
spending New Year's Eve with their families, it is common for women
choosing hostess skirts to buy tiny replicas for their young
daughters, said Ms. Kruer.
</P>
<P>
   David Ingram, a personal shopper at Barneys New York, has also
been dressing women who plan to do nothing particularly spectacular
this Dec. 31. The hostess skirt, paired with the requisite sweater
set, ``is unequivocally what people are wearing,'' he said.
High-profile clients _ ``the ones who aren't interfacing with the
food,'' Ingram explained _ are electing to wear traditional
mobility-inhibiting taffeta versions. Others _ presumably those
forced to lean over and spoon out the caviar themselves _ are
favoring satin crepe.
</P>
<P>
   There is something decidedly future-averse about the popularity
of the hostess skirt, an artifact belonging more to the world of a
Rick Moody story than to the world of the Palm V. The skirt is an
outgrowth of the postwar suburban boom, when regular Americans
increasingly entertained at home, said the fashion historian
Valerie Steele. The idea behind the skirt, she explained, is that
the hostess could be dressed up but still comfortable. In the
1960s, even Barbie had hostess clothes. (Pairing full-length skirts
with twin sets was first popular in World War II, said another
historian, Caroline Rennolds Milbank: Mainbocher incorporated
sweaters into evening looks, as oil rations left people heat
deprived.)
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the popularity of the hostess skirt shouldn't be all
that surprising at a century's end that is also seeing a TV game
show renaissance. ``There's been an enormous flee backward,'' the
trend forecaster Faith Popcorn said of the unsettling millennial
moment. ``Maybe we think that if we dress naively, nothing bad will
happen to us.''
</P>
<P>
   A FASHION CRITIC IS APPOINTED
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Horyn, a fashion reporter for The New York Times, has been
appointed fashion critic. Ms. Horyn, 42, joined The Times in
January from Vanity Fair, where she was a contributing editor. From
1990 to 1994 she was the fashion reporter for The Washington Post.
She began her career covering fashion for The Detroit News in 1986.

ANTHONY IMPERIALE, POLARIZING FORCE IN NEW JERSEY, DIES AT 88  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID M. HALBFINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Anthony Imperiale, a race-baiting civic leader
and politician from Newark who became a national symbol of the
backlash against urban unrest by wielding a baseball bat to defend
his white neighborhood during the 1967 riots, died Sunday at Saint
Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston of complications related to
kidney failure. He was 68.
</P>
<P>
   A former Marine who served in the Korean War, Imperiale first
surfaced in Newark politics in the early 1960s as an opponent of
busing to achieve school desegregation. Then, in July 1967, when
Newark burned, gunfire erupted from apartment windows and 26 people
were killed, Imperiale began preaching armed white self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   He formed the North Ward First Aid Squad, ostensibly to escort
residents of the predominantly Italian North Ward through racially
troubled areas. But the group's nighttime street patrols drew
charges of vigilantism. Imperiale's defiance, even demagoguery,
only made things worse, his critics said. At one point, he warned
that ``when the Black Panther comes, the white hunter will be
waiting.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic governor then, Richard J. Hughes, called
Imperiale's followers ``brownshirts,'' and the patrols were
discontinued in 1969. By then, however, Imperiale had capitalized
on his notoriety, winning election to an at-large City Council
seat.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, when the Essex County Republican organization refused
to give him its endorsement to run for the State Assembly,
Imperiale ran as an independent and won, an unheard-of
accomplishment. Former Gov. Thomas P. Kean, then the Assembly
speaker, recalled Imperiale planting his seat squarely in the aisle
between the two sides of the chamber and refusing to move out of
the way.
</P>
<P>
   Kean remembered Imperiale for his sense of humor, and his
forcefulness, but also as a ``polarizing force.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time there was trouble he was there, and the trouble often
got worse because he was there,'' Kean said. ``In the period after
the riots, there were people on the left and right who tried to
make a name by making the situation worse, and by being extremists,
and he was one of those people in that period. He was not as bad as
his enemies said he was, but he wasn't as good as friends said he
was.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, Imperiale won election as an independent to the State
Senate. he was defeated in 1977, but was elected again in 1979,
this time as a Republican. But the peak of his political career
came in 1974, when he lost a close race against Newark Mayor
Kenneth A. Gibson, receiving 43.7 percent of the votes cast.
</P>
<P>
   Imperiale's chief black opponent was not Gibson, however, but
the poet Amiri Baraka, with whom he clashed over a seemingly
endless series of issues. The battle that drew the most attention
was a proposal that Baraka backed to build a low-income housing
project, called the Kawaida Towers, in the North Ward.
</P>
<P>
   Steven N. Adubato Sr., a powerful Democrat in the North Ward who
was Imperiale's principal opponent in the Italian-American
community, recalled Imperiale chaining himself to a fence for days
to block the project, which eventually failed. ``Every day, he and
Baraka would put on a show for the cameras,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Imperiale was a fixture at Newark's Columbus Day
parades; his outrageous costumes produced thousands of belly
laughs. One year he dressed up as a gladiator and shared a float
with a live lion. Another year, he rode in a tank.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, Imperiale became embroiled in a new controversy, when
he admitted running a Republican ballot-security program in Newark
that Democrats claimed existed solely to suppress the black vote.
Imperiale denied that his armband-wearing guards tried to
intimidate black voters. Nonetheless, his efforts on behalf of Kean
were seen as crucial in Kean's winning the governor's race by 850
votes.
</P>
<P>
   The same year, Imperiale was elected again to the Assembly, this
time as a Republican, and served one term.
</P>
<P>
   After that, although he gained praise for founding a volunteer
ambulance corps, his political career fizzled. He was a delegate to
the Republican National Convention in 1984, but lost Republican
primaries for U.S. representative in 1988, for Essex County sheriff
in 1991 and for County freeholder in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Imperiale, who is survived by his wife, Louise, five sons, two
daughters and 13 grandchildren, led a home life that seemed as
rocky as his political career at times.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984 his son Anthony Jr. was sentenced to nine years in
prison for shooting and wounding a 17-year-old who was making noise
outside his bedroom window. In January 1997, his son Michael was
shot and wounded by an off-duty police officer after the two were
involved in a collision.
</P>
<P>
   Though many called Imperiale a racist, he was said to have
mellowed in recent years, more so after he was hospitalized in 1995
for kidney failure.
</P>
<P>
   Adubato, who called himself one of Imperiale's longtime
political ``enemies,'' observed that as an ambulance volunteer,
``he never was concerned about what color the person was, black or
white. If he could help, he would help.''
</P>
<P>
   Adubato told how he learned something of Imperiale's generosity,
as well as his sense of humor, about 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother-in-law had an attack, she was an older woman, and I
called Tony's ambulance squad,'' Adubato said. ``A short time after
I called, she died.
</P>
<P>
   ``So a few minutes later I hear the door, and there's Tony
Imperiale, with all this equipment. He was a big, heavyset guy. And
he runs up the stairs, and he's in the next room, taking all this
oxygen and equipment out. And I said, `Tony, it's OK'
</P>
<P>
   ``But he said, `That's not for her. It's for me.'''

EDITORIAL: PROGRESS ON MEDICAL ERRORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Dec. 28:
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Veterans Affairs recently reported that
veterans' hospitals around the country committed about 3,000
medical errors leading to about 700 deaths between June 1997 and
December 1998. These frightening statistics reflect what can go
wrong in the veterans' health system. But they also reflect what is
being done right.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans' hospitals are not the only ones plagued by mistakes.
The Institute of Medicine reported last month that medical mistakes
kill more hospital patients than car accidents, AIDS or breast
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The report goaded politicians to promise corrective action, and
last week eight executives of major companies disclosed the
formation of an organization _ the Leapfrog Group _ designed in
part to steer employees to hospitals that make the fewest mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   The veterans' hospitals had already begun putting error-catching
systems in place before the institute's report was released. When
Dr. Kenneth Kizer took over as undersecretary of veterans affairs
in 1994, he found an unorganized health system lacking modern
quality control or standards. The system had a reputation for
bloated costs and sometimes substandard care.
</P>
<P>
   Kizer brought hospitals, outpatient clinics and nursing homes
together into integrated networks. He paid the networks a fixed
amount of money for each veteran the network treated independent of
the diagnosis, giving them a powerful incentive to spend money
wisely. The doctors were paid salaries, eliminating any economic
reason to undertreat or overtreat patients. Kizer closed hospitals
and eliminated administrators.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Veterans Health Administration has made a more serious
commitment to improving health safety than any other large system
in the country,'' said Dr. Donald Berwick of the Institute for
Healthcare Improvement, a nonprofit research center in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond structural reforms, Kizer initiated a policy that
requires employees of the veterans' health system to report medical
errors. This policy produced the data on thousands of mistakes and
hundreds of deaths over 19 months. There is no evidence that the
veterans' hospitals are treating patients less safely than other
institutions are, Berwick said. He argues that private hospitals
would look just as bad if they reported medical errors as
accurately.
</P>
<P>
   The first step in overcoming errors is to report them
accurately. The data from the veterans' hospitals, as grim as they
are, reflect the fact that the system is moving in the right
direction.

DOUBLE-CHECK YOUR HOME PC FOR Y2K PROBLEMS THIS WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID HAYES  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) About 45 percent of computer owners would rather clean
the bathroom than get their PCs ready for the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   And 13 percent would rather shop for a burial plot.
</P>
<P>
   Well, that poll /{was/} done on behalf of a company that sells
equipment to back up a computer's hard drive in case of problems.
But that obvious conflict aside, it does underscore an issue that
many of us have been ignoring.
</P>
<P>
   With Y2K just days away, about 26 million of us haven't done
anything to get our home computers ready for Y2K, according to a
survey done for Iomega Corp. by Roper Starch.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, don't panic.
</P>
<P>
   Your computer won't do the Mission Impossible thing and
self-destruct five seconds after midnight New Year's Eve. In fact,
it might not show any symptoms at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you're doing a lot of financial stuff, it's just not
that big an issue,'' said Dale Vossen, owner of KCPC Inc., a Lenexa
computer store. ``For the people who turn the machine on once a
week for e-mail, it's a non-issue. I certainly wouldn't go out and
spend money on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Second, don't automatically assume that it's a Y2K problem if
your computer crashes or you can't get through to your online
service on the first try. Millions of people have problems logging
into America Online each week. And home PCs crash as often as
bumper cars at a carnival.
</P>
<P>
   Y2K personal computer issues generally can be placed in three
categories _ hardware, software and data. Computer viruses, not
related but expected to be even more of a problem this week than
usual, are another issue.
</P>
<P>
   When considering how to deal with your PC and Y2K, start with
its BIOS, short for Basic Input//Output System.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the BIOS uses a computer's ``real time
clock,'' a small circuit on your computer's motherboard, to set the
time and date. The battery-powered clock//calendar keeps track of
the time even when the computer is off. The clock, according to
IBM's specifications, keeps track of the year with only two digits.
</P>
<P>
   A computer's operating system and most software applications use
the BIOS to set the time and date each time a computer is turned
on, when a file is opened, or when a new file is started. The BIOS,
if Y2K-compatible, converts the two-digit year to four digits.
</P>
<P>
   In general, most IBM-compatible computers manufactured after
June 1997 should not need a BIOS Y2K repair.
</P>
<P>
   Others may need a fix. And there are several ways to find out.
</P>
<P>
   Checking with the manufacturer is probably the easiest way.
Armed with your computer's model and serial numbers, go to the
manufacturer's Web site _ often found simply by typing in {www.},
the name of the manufacturer and adding {.com} at the end _ and
look for the company's Y2K page.
</P>
<P>
   Gateway, for instance, lists models known to be Y2K-compliant at
{www.gateway.com//about//y2k//models.shtml}.
</P>
<P>
   Vossen also recommends checking by simply changing the
computer's date. To do so, go to a DOS prompt, type ``date'' and
move the computer ahead in time. Then open programs and see if you
have any problems.
</P>
<P>
   There also are tests _ either available for free download or for
sale at computer stores _ that will test the BIOS for you. Some
also offer BIOS repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Most manufacturers recommend the YMark2000 test, available for
free download at {www.nstl.com}. YMark2000 only looks for problems,
it doesn't repair them.
</P>
<P>
   There also could be Y2K problems with your computer's operating
system, which keeps track of your computer's software and gives
instructions to its hardware.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are a half-dozen popular operating systems, the
most commonly used are Microsoft's Windows 95 and Windows 98. Both
have minor Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
   Fixes are available at {www.microsoft.com//y2k}.
</P>
<P>
   The Apple Macintosh operating system doesn't have any Y2K
problems. All sorts of application software _ financial programs
like Quicken or Money, database programs like Excel and e-mail
programs like Outlook Express _ can have problems.
</P>
<P>
   However, the programs most susceptible... MORE

NEW YORK STATE CRISIS OFFICIALS WILL WORK IN A REAL EMERGENCY
BUNKER

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ When New York City's crisis managers convene to
track any chaos attending the arrival of the Year 2000, they will
ride express elevators from the paneled lobby of 7 World Trade
Center to the 23rd floor of the black glass tower. Officials
outside the central control room of the city's emergency operations
center will have striking views of New York Harbor and Lower
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   When New York State's emergency management team convenes on the
same day here, the officials will clank down cement stairs, pass
under a foot-thick steel hatch and go to work deep in an artificial
hill on the outskirts of town. Views? Forget about it.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's $13 million emergency operations
center may have gained the nickname ``bunker'' when it opened last
February, but the state's real bunker belongs to Gov. George E.
Pataki. The state's command post for emergencies sits in a
40-year-old two-level bomb shelter built during the prime Cold War
years as the post-nuclear seat of state government.
</P>
<P>
   The shelter was designed to house 400 people for two weeks. It
has three generators, its own water supply, air filters and only
two entrances: the hatch on top and a 200-foot tunnel out one side.
</P>
<P>
   The ranks of bunks, two operating rooms and commissary are long
gone, with the lower of two subterranean floors now housing
temporary offices of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
There, claims are still being processed from recent natural
disasters ranging from Tropical Storm Floyd back to the midwinter
flash floods of January 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In the last four years, the state's Emergency Management Office,
spending about $1 million, has given a technological makeover to
the upper floor of the bunker, adding banks of computers,
telephones and radios and wall-size flat-screen displays for
computer-generated maps of weather, roads, hospital locations and
other information.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been able to take a facility with one purpose and move
it into the new millennium,'' said Edward F. Jacoby Jr., the
director of the state emergency agency, who will supervise 150
people working around the clock to field and respond to emergency
calls through the first days of the new year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ready for just about anything,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The old role of bomb shelter faded in the late 1980s, along with
the Soviet threat, Jacoby said as he gave a tour of the buried
building. Since then, he said, it has increasingly taken on the
role of command post for monitoring ``any risk, any hazard, any
time, any place.''
</P>
<P>
   And the state has seen all manner of crisis recently, with 12
federal disaster declarations in the last five years, he said.
``They've been just about anything you can imagine,'' he said, from
blizzards to tropical storms to forest fires.
</P>
<P>
   The building is still being refitted. One week before New Year's
Eve, a technician was hard at work behind a bank of new servers,
each covered with pulsing green lights. Nearby, the central control
room was nearly empty, with ranks of computer screens displaying
nothing but the agency logo. In a few days, they would spring to
life, displaying status reports or incoming messages on any
incidents from Buffalo to Montauk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the challenge is this state is so huge,'' Jacoby said.
Each county is expected to be in constant touch throughout the New
Year's weekend, he said.
</P>
<P>
   On New Year's Eve, the small kitchen near the central operations
room will be taken over by the caterers who supply food to the
State Police Academy next door.
</P>
<P>
   The menu for the New Year's dinner has been set, said Dennis J.
Michalski, a spokesman for the emergency agency: sirloin beef tips
Burgundy over noodles or baked cod with seafood topping.
</P>
<P>
   The menu is about the only thing about New Year's Eve that is
certain, Jacoby said. For the rest, he said, ``We'll just have to
wait and see, and be prepared.''

   (undated) ...like Outlook Express _ can have problems.
</P>
<P>
   However, the programs most susceptible to Y2K problems are
spreadsheet and database programs. Some misinterpret two-digit
dates _ 01, for instance _ as 1901.
</P>
<P>
   Because there are thousands of software programs on the market,
there is no single, simple test that will tell you whether each can
handle the rollover. The best way to determine that is to visit the
technical support Web sites for all of the software you use
regularly.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Microsoft Office 2000 suite, which was released early
this year, has minor Y2K flaws. In fact, on Sunday Microsoft said a
patch for the Excel 2000 spreadsheet program still is ``pending.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless you keep your financial records on the computer, do heavy
online stock trading or online banking, ``it's not really a
problem,'' Vossen said.
</P>
<P>
   However, if you do use your computer for any of those functions,
check out your software this week.
</P>
<P>
   Last on the Y2K computer checklist are your personal files.
Personal data includes anything you've created on your computer _
documents, e-mail, financial records, photos, computer game records
and numbers typed into spreadsheets.
</P>
<P>
   This becomes critical for files that are used for calculations
or bill paying. It's best to use programs that accept four-digit
years in all important files, and to change existing two-digit
years to four digits when you can.
</P>
<P>
   If you have online access, top places to look for more
information include {www.microsoft.com//y2k};
{www.zdnet.com//zdhelp//filters//y2k}; {www.cnet.com}; and
{www.iomega.com}.
</P>
<P>
   However, the biggest problem facing home computer users may come
from outside the home.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say dozens of computer viruses could be released ``into
the wild'' in the next week. Many of the viruses are expected to
mimic Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
   Protecting yourself from a Y2K virus is simple. If you don't
have anti-virus software on your computer, buy or download a trial
version now. If you do have anti-virus software, make sure you
download the latest ``virus definitions'' from the manufacturer _
and look for new updates almost daily for the next 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Although it makes sense to be wary of viruses, don't believe
everything you hear.
</P>
<P>
   One popular game passed on by e-mail this season _ elfbowl.exe _
was rumored to contain a virus that would activate on Christmas
Day. An e-mail that circulated stating that the elf bowling game
had a virus was a hoax, according to the Symantec AntiVirus
Research Center.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Word that the task of ushering in the next millennium
has been bestowed on Dr. Mary Ann Hopkins is filtering slowly
through the wards where she works at Bellevue Hospital Center and
NYU Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   One patient, Celesti C. Fechter, for example, heard it from her
anesthesiologist. Ms. Fechter was being wheeled into surgery when
he explained that the hands wielding the scalpel would be the very
hands entrusted with pushing the button to drop the New Year's ball
on Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins was picked, he explained, because she volunteers her
skills in various war zones to Doctors Without Borders, the
international relief group that won the Nobel Peace Prize this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I thought the anesthesiologist was joking,'' Ms.
Fechter said. ``But then I was kind of pleased. I figured if she
can perform surgery in the conditions of most Third World
countries, she can do it in New York in a hospital with no bullets
flying.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, conjecture about whether bullets or explosives will be
flying crops up frequently when patients or other medical workers
hear about her assignment. ``Are they keeping you in a secure
place?'' a technician asked.
</P>
<P>
   Given where she's been, Hopkins, 36, takes a rather calm
approach to the remote possibility of any violence. She quoted
advice from her boss: ``If anybody needs first aid, you'll be
there.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, being in the thick of things, more or less, got Hopkins
to Times Square. (Doctors Without Borders was selected for the
button-pushing role by the Times Square Business Improvement
District, the celebration's main organizer.)
</P>
<P>
   As a classics major at Harvard, Hopkins spent the three summers
before her graduation in 1985 volunteering in India and Somalia for
a relief group, Families for Children. In India, she and her sister
helped to manage an orphanage housing 500 children.
</P>
<P>
   One day, the job of taking a 13-year-old girl with typhoid to
the hospital fell to her. The child died and she had to take the
body back to the orphanage on her lap in a bicycle rickshaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know now that she must have been in septic shock, that her
veins had collapsed,'' Hopkins said. ``But at the time I knew
nothing except that there was no blood in her when they cut into a
vein, and she looked very white.''
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins is descended from three generations of surgeons _ her
grandfather spent his residency at Bellevue _ but it was that death
in India that pushed her to enter Harvard Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medicine had always been in my background, but when you have a
child die like that ...'' she said, her voice trailing off. ``That
was traumatic. I haven't thought about that for a while. I tend to
block traumatic things from my head, or I would probably never go
back.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from medical school in 1992, she was a resident
in general surgery at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, and
she worked at Staten Island University Hospital before switching to
Bellevue and NYU this fall.
</P>
<P>
   For surgeons, Doctors Without Borders bends its usual
requirement that medical volunteers commit to a minimum of six
months for their initial relief trip. But still, getting the time
is always a process of negotiation. Hopkins said one reason she
moved to Bellevue was its commitment to public health worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   She believes the main difference between her work in American
hospitals and her stints overseas, aside from day-to-day issues
like not ordering a lot of X-rays and lab tests, is that her
expertise has a far larger impact. ``If I was not here, someone
could replace me tomorrow,'' she said of her work in New York. In
contrast, during her time in Sri Lanka in 1996, she was the only
surgeon in a region of 500,000 people, while two months ago in
Burundi she taught a doctor how to perform basic surgery like an
emergency Caesarean section.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the great rewards of this work is to leave someone who
can take care of patients if there isn't a surgeon there,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   A main reason she was picked from the 30 or so Doctors Without
Borders volunteers in New York City is that the organization wants
to draw attention to the conflicts in India and Somalia, where she
worked. The Times Square appearance involves showing up at 6:30
a.m. Friday so she can be available for things like television
interviews. (She bought some new lipstick _ ``Thank God I'm a
surgeon, I can wear pajamas all day long'' _ and she hopes that by
then someone will have briefed her on a few pertinent details _
like what precisely she will do.)
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins said she started laughing when she was first asked to
perform the task, and her biggest problem so far has been
convincing people that it is true.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can think of the least likely thing that you would ever
be asked to do, this would rank up there,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After her sudden anointment, she and her husband, Dr. Pietro
Mazzoni, a neurologist, postponed a surprise visit to his family on
the West Coast. He will be with her on the square, along with her
parents. He has been kidding her that she is likely to change the
course of the next millennium, not to mention confusing the
millions of people watching, by hitting the button too early or too
late.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is convinced that I will be late and the next 1,000
years will be a few seconds behind,'' she said, laughing.

SPORTS LOSING ITS COMIC RELIEF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's the final minute of the third period for the
Wayne Gretzky of cartoons. The Michael Jordan of comic strips has
his right wrist cocked, ready to apply one last penstroke to a
singular career.
</P>
<P>
   Another man who made an indelible mark on athletics is leaving
us.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday Charles Schulz signs off on ``Peanuts.'' If you can't
see what a loss to the sports world that will be, then you didn't
grow up as I did, digesting Schulz's comic strip as part of a
healthy, hearty breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   I tell people I've been devouring the sports pages first thing
in the morning since being weaned from Dr. Seuss and Dick and Jane.
Like the roundness of Charlie Brown's head, this is a slight
exaggeration, for effect. The truth is, I long have turned to
sports only after reading ``Peanuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, many days it's hard to see where ``Peanuts'' ends and
the sports section begins. That has been by design. For Schulz, who
recently was diagnosed with colon cancer, sports has been equal
parts perspiration and inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   Before he became the father of Charlie Brown and Snoopy, Schulz,
77, was an enthusiastic athlete. Like Gretzky in his youth, Schulz
used to practice his slapshot by swatting tennis balls at his
grandmother while she tended the goal with a broom.
</P>
<P>
   He earned money for comic books, his one great indulgence as a
youth, by caddying at Highland Park Golf Course in his hometown of
St. Paul, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   And, contrary to popular belief, Schulz's first true love wasn't
a certain red-haired girl, it was the sport of every red-blooded
American boy. We're talking baseball, Willie, Mickey and `The
Duke'.
</P>
<P>
   In the sandlots of St. Paul, Schulz once pitched a no-hitter in
a summer-league baseball game. In more typical Charlie Brown
fashion, Schulz also was on the losing end of a 40-0 score.
</P>
<P>
   Once a pitcher, always a pitcher: As he settled into the middle
innings of the biggest game of all, sports became the mound from
which Schulz delivered precise lessons about life's fastballs and
curves.
</P>
<P>
   There was the time Charlie Brown told Lucy Van Pelt he had
dreamed of playing in baseball's big leagues all his life ``but I
know I'll never make it.'' To which she replied he ought to set
more immediate goals and offered this gem of an example: ``See if
you can walk out to the mound without falling down.''
</P>
<P>
   A fine (and funny) lesson in perspective, that.
</P>
<P>
   For every winner there must be a loser. It's one of life's
harshest axioms. Schulz tackled the point tactfully time and again,
using Charlie Brown as his carrier.
</P>
<P>
   Lucy's younger brother Linus once described to Charlie Brown how
a football team came back from a 6-0 deficit in the final seconds
to win, prompting the team's fans to spill onto the field and start
dancing and hugging and laughing. Charlie Brown was silent until
Linus finished his story. Then he wondered aloud, ``How did the
other team feel?''
</P>
<P>
   Another time Lucy told Charlie Brown, ``You think you'd be happy
if you won a ball game, don't you? Well, you wouldn't. If you won
one game, you'd want to win another and then another. Soon you'd
want to win every ball game you played.''
</P>
<P>
   It's true; winning can be addictive. Just ask the Clippers, who,
unlike good ol' Charlie Brown, are finally getting a taste of
success.
</P>
<P>
   The reason Charlie Brown has been a luckless loser since well
before Donald Sterling gave L.A. bad basketball is simple.
``Winning is great,'' Schulz is fond of saying, ``but it's not
funny.''
</P>
<P>
   But of course. You can't laugh if you don't recognize the
punchline.
</P>
<P>
   The simple fact is, most of us are on far more intimate terms
with failure than success. That's why we can feel Charlie Brown's
embarrassment when he is bounced from a spelling bee after spelling
maze M-a-y-s.
</P>
<P>
   We know exactly what Charlie Brown means when he observes,
``Distances on a baseball diamond are deceiving. When you walk from
the bench to the plate it's about 30 feet. When you walk from the
plate to the bench (after striking out) it's four miles.''
</P>
<P>
   We easily catch Lucy's drift when she tells Charlie Brown, ``you
are three putts on the 18th green, you are a seven-ten split in the
10th frame... a love set... you are a missed free throw, a shanked
nine-iron and a called third strike.''
</P>
<P>
   Wholly human, that's what Schulz's characters are.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenges to be faced in sports work marvelously as a
caricature of the challenges we face in the more serious aspects of
our lives,'' Schulz has said. ``When Charlie Brown has tried to
analyze his own difficulties in life, he has always been able to
express them best in sports terms.''
</P>
<P>
   With a few strokes of his pen, Schulz turned basic human
vulnerabilities into a rare art form. He paved the way for Ziggy
and Cathy and, yes, Eric Cartman (for which he is forgiven).
</P>
<P>
   Schulz was ahead of his time in other ways. A trustee of the
Women's Sports Foundation, he was a champion of female athletes
long before Mia Hamm and Company made it fashionable.
</P>
<P>
   One of the characters in ``Peanuts'' is Peppermint Patty, who is
nearly as old as Michelle Akers and every bit as feisty.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA had yet to embrace women's collegiate athletics when
Peppermint Patty, an aspiring Olympic figure skater (as were two of
Schulz's daughters), waged her war against the boys at the local
rink. They tried to kick her off the ice so they could play hockey,
but Peppermint Patty stubbornly held her ground. At length the
conflict was resolved when the boys asked her to be a center on
their team.
</P>
<P>
   Another day found her railing at a sports broadcast that ended
without any mention of female athletes. ``What about women in
sports?'' she screamed at the television. ``Did you tell us what
Conni Place has been doing? And how about... Evelyn Ashford and Ann
Meyers and Judy Sladky and Sarah Doctor?''
</P>
<P>
   It takes a true sports fan to know of Sladky, a five-time U.S.
champion in ice dancing. It was an unabashed sports nut who, when
asked to list his three heroes named Dwight Eisenhower, Billie Jean
King and Sam Snead.
</P>
<P>
   When I was 13, I sent Schulz a booklet of my Peanuts drawings.
He sent me back a handwritten note, ``You draw very well for your
age.'' On that day he joined Abraham Lincoln, Donna deVarona and my
parents on my heroes list.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd dearly love to have won the U.S. Amateur or the World
Series,'' Schulz once said, ``but what I've done, I think, is much
better.''
</P>
<P>
   He'll get no arguments here. &QL;

KINGS TO ADD CORKUM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In an attempt to regroup from five consecutive
losses, the Kings will sign unrestricted free-agent center Bob
Corkum today before leaving for Wednesday's game in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Corkum, the former Mighty Duck who played the past three seasons
with the Phoenix Coyotes, needs to pass a physical this morning to
complete the one-year deal that includes a club option for the
2000-01 season.
</P>
<P>
   Corkum, who scored 23 goals for Anaheim in 1993-94, had just
nine last season. But he is considered a valuable two-way player
who is excellent on faceoffs. He was seeking $1.5 million this
season on the free-agent market but had no takers. He is believed
to be getting about a third of that figure in his deal with the
Kings.
</P>
<P>
   Despite injuries to top players all season, the Kings are
surprisingly solid at center. Jozef Stumpel has returned after
missing five weeks after abdominal surgery. Bryan Smolinski is
among the league's leading scorers and Ian Laperriere has added a
few goals to his enforcer role on the Kings third line.
</P>
<P>
   Corkum, who turned 32 on Dec. 18, will not play Wednesday
against Colorado or Thursday at home against Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings have a roster spot open after sending left winger Bill
Huard to minor-league Lowell, Mass., on Tuesday. Huard, brought in
to add grit to the Kings front line, played just one game and did
not score. But Corkum still needs to show the Kings how close he is
to being ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't played all season and we need to get him in here to
evaluate his level of conditioning,'' coach Andy Murray said. ``We
like his all-around ability and his ability to play against the top
skating centers in the league. He doesn't fill a specific need, but
he adds great depth to our club.''
</P>
<P>
   Better effort: Defenseman Jere Karalahti, who scored his first
NHL point in Sunday's 3-2 overtime loss to Phoenix, is expected to
remain with the club now that Aki Berg will miss the next two games
with a rib injury.
</P>
<P>
   Karalahti, shaky in his first NHL game Dec. 11 at Montreal, was
more composed Sunday and played 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very nervous for my first game,'' he said. ``This was my
first home game, but it didn't seem so bad. I got into the flow of
the game right away and felt a lot more relaxed.''
</P>
<P>
   Karalahti was teased by his teammates for his first point. He
was credited with the second assist on the first-period goal by
Laperriere even though replays showed he never touched the puck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those things happen,'' said Karalahti, who was sent down after
the Montreal game and later caught the flu. ``After everything I'll
take it. There will be more.''
</P>
<P>
   Injury update: Goaltender Jamie Storr, sidelined 10 days ago
with a concussion, is still at least a week away from returning.
Marcel Cousineau is backing up starter Stephane Fiset.

RESEARCHERS USING TECHNOLOGY TO ZAP DANGEROUS BACTERIA OFF FOODS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALAN BAVLEY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, Mo. _ There's new hope for meat lovers who'd like to
bite into a juicy, rare hamburger without worrying that they're
swallowing a deadly dose of E. coli bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have found a way to take technology _ developed by
the military to knock enemy missiles out of the sky _ and use it to
zap dangerous bacteria on meat and other foods.
</P>
<P>
   These germ-killing devices, called electron beam accelerators,
have become the focus of intensive research by engineers and food
scientists at the University of Missouri-Columbia, Iowa State
University and other places.
</P>
<P>
   One manufacturer of e-beam accelerators already is building
plants in Iowa and Hawaii to irradiate hamburger, chicken and
tropical fruit. Big producers of beef and poultry, including IBP
Inc. and Tyson Foods Inc., are planning to give e-beams a tryout.
</P>
<P>
   And as word of the capabilities of electron beams spreads, food
processors are lining up to have test batches of their products
irradiated, as well.
</P>
<P>
   University of Missouri researchers have been approached by
suppliers of soft drinks, produce, fruit juices, baked goods and
even pet foods. All are interested in using the university's
electron beam accelerator.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hot market, everybody's anxious to get into it,'' said
Thomas Clevenger, a civil engineer involved in e-beam research at
MU. ``For every food industry, there're applications for this.''
</P>
<P>
   Fueling that interest is the growing public concern about food
poisoning. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
estimates that Americans suffer about 76 million cases of
food-borne illness each year. About 325,000 people are hospitalized
and 5,000 die.
</P>
<P>
   Although some advocates for safer foods question the
wholesomeness of irradiated food, e-beam researchers insist the
food is safe.
</P>
<P>
   Electron beam accelerators already are used extensively to
disinfect medical instruments and supplies, such as catheters.
Applied to food, researchers say, e-beams promise to virtually
eliminate salmonella, E. coli, campylobacter, listeria and other
germs that cause disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``It guarantees that meat is safe when it leaves the factory,''
Clevenger said.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers, however, still would have to handle and prepare
irradiated foods as they would other products. Some bacteria may
not be destroyed by irradiation, and bacteria from other foods
could still contaminate irradiated foods.
</P>
<P>
   Technology to irradiate foods has been around for decades. Until
e-beams became available, radioactive isotopes were used to supply
the radiation. But the cost and logistical problems involved in
building safe nuclear facilities and the public's distrust of
anything involving radioactivity have slowed the technology's
development.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture published regulations this
month to govern irradiation of hamburger, steaks, pork chops and
other raw meat. Irradiation has been approved for disinfecting a
number of other foods, including poultry, spices, fruit and
vegetables, but its use has been limited.
</P>
<P>
   E-beam proponents acknowledge that consumers may be skeptical
about eating irradiated food, but they hope public opinion would
favor the technology because it relies on electricity rather than
radioactivity.
</P>
<P>
   They prefer to call e-beam treatments ``cold pasteurization''
rather than irradiation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process we're talking about is non-nuclear....You can turn
it off with the flip of a switch,'' said Randy Curry, a University
of Missouri electrical engineer.
</P>
<P>
   Curry used to work on electron beam technology as part of the
Strategic Defense Initiative, the Reagan administration's plan to
protect the United States from missile attacks.
</P>
<P>
   After budget cuts shut down Curry's research, he and other
engineers began looking for new applications for their expertise.
</P>
<P>
   An electron beam accelerator uses a cathode to produce a stream
of electrons. High voltage is applied to accelerate the electrons,
creating a pencil-thin, high-energy e-beam.
</P>
<P>
   When the beam strikes food, it damages or destroys the DNA of
bacteria so they die or become unable to reproduce.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kill... MORE
</P>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, Mo. _ ...become unable to reproduce.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kill is instantaneous,'' Clevenger said.
</P>
<P>
   The electron beam accelerator at the University of Missouri is
formidable _ about 6 feet of coiled wire, metal pipes and rubber
hose mounted to a metal frame on a laboratory floor.
</P>
<P>
   Accelerators, such as this one, can cost as much as $5 million
and require an additional $5 million in shielding. Researchers are
working with manufacturers to develop smaller, less-expensive
accelerators.
</P>
<P>
   Clevenger believes that eventually, the price could be reduced
to $1 million for an accelerator and shielding. And the
accelerators would be small enough to add to the conveyor belts of
food-processing plants.
</P>
<P>
   The MU researchers also are looking at modifying accelerators to
produce X-rays that could penetrate foods more deeply than e-beams.
</P>
<P>
   E-beams have many potential applications, said MU food scientist
Nan Unklesbay.
</P>
<P>
   They could prevent mold from growing on baked goods, she said.
They could pasteurize fruit juices without changing their taste, as
conventional pasteurization does. They could even be used to make
raw seafood less risky.
</P>
<P>
   All these uses would require government approval, but Unklesbay
didn't see anything blocking the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as the technology is proven with one food, I think it
could happen very quickly,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some consumer advocates, however, don't share Unklesbay's
enthusiasm for e-beams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a false solution to a very real problem,'' said Ronnie
Cummins, national director of the Organic Consumers Association,
based in Little Marais, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   Cummins said researchers have found that irradiation of any kind
robs foods of substantial amounts of vitamins. It also causes
chemical reactions in foods that create cancer-causing substances,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (the food industry) will have a grave problem
convincing the public that it is safe,'' Cummins said.
</P>
<P>
   Meat processors are turning to irradiation rather than employing
better sanitation to keep contaminants off meat, Cummins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's coming up now because they've reached a crisis. They know
they have to do something, but they're doing the wrong thing. It's
not going to fly.''
</P>
<P>
   Those concerns, however, aren't generally shared by medical
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Scientific evidence is strong that irradiated foods are safe and
nutritious, said Carol Tucker Foreman, a distinguished fellow with
the Consumer Federation of America, a coalition of consumer groups.
</P>
<P>
   But Foreman, too, said irradiation should not become a
substitute for good sanitation.
</P>
<P>
   She anticipated that irradiated food would be marketed first to
hospitals and nursing homes, and to people with weakened immune
systems, such as AIDS patients. Next might be fast-food
restaurants, she said.
</P>
<P>
   E-beam irradiation would raise the price of hamburger or chicken
by about 5 cents per pound, said Ralph Williams, spokesman for
Titan Corp., a San Diego-based manufacturer of electron beam
accelerators.
</P>
<P>
   Titan has built an e-beam plant in Sioux City, Iowa. Beginning
in February, several large producers of chicken and ground beef
will use the facility's SureBeam to irradiate frozen meat for test
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   The USDA is requiring that irradiated products be labeled with
the international symbol for irradiation, called a radura, and
carry a statement that they have been treated.
</P>
<P>
   Unklesbay and other e-beam proponents had hoped the USDA would
have had a campaign to educate consumers about the benefits of
irradiation. But that's not in the agency's plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to appear to be endorsing it,'' said Carol
Blake, USDA spokeswoman. ``All we're saying is, it's permitted. It
certainly doesn't replace the sanitation standards companies have
in place.''

 Lawmakers promise to work for tougher laws against drunken
driving  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATT CAMPBELL and JOE LAMBE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Democratic leaders of the Missouri Senate on
Monday said that in the coming legislative session they would work
with the House and governor to pass tougher laws against drunken
driving.
</P>
<P>
   Bills to tighten the state's laws on drunken driving have
faltered in recent years, but a push by the Democratic leadership
may make the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making it one of our priorities,'' said Sen. Ronnie
DePasco of Kansas City, who as majority floor leader moves bills
once they come out of committee.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Jackson County Prosecutor Bob Beaird said Monday that
he plans to start a special court in the coming year to force
repeat drunken drivers into extended treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Several members of the Kansas City legislative delegation called
for tougher laws following The Kansas City Star's examination of
drunken driving in the city and state.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper found that Kansas City leads Missouri in
alcohol-related accidents, leads the state in the number of repeat
drunken drivers and leads the state in the most repeat offenders
with 10 or more convictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was certainly appalled that we're the drunk driving capital
of Missouri,'' said Democratic Rep. Bill Skaggs of Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper also reported that Missouri ranks above the
national average in the percentage of traffic fatalities involving
alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   DePasco said House and Senate Democratic leaders met recently
with Gov. Mel Carnahan to draft a strategy for the next legislative
session, which starts Jan. 5. Tougher drunken-driving legislation
was on the Democrats' agenda, he said.
</P>
<P>
   DePasco predicted 2000 will be the year Missouri approves
lowering the definition of intoxication from 0.1 percent
blood-alcohol content to .08 percent. Seventeen states, including
Kansas, receive millions of dollars in federal highway incentives
because they already have the lower level.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bound to pass,'' DePasco said. ``It's about time. It
comes up every year.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have majorities in the House and the Senate, which
gives the party control of committees and the power to move bills
quickly, to limit amendments and schedule votes on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Sen. Morris Westfall of Halfway, Mo., has fought for
.08 and already has introduced another bill. The measure passed the
House in the 1999 session but failed in the Senate. Westfall has
been critical of the leadership for not backing .08.
</P>
<P>
   The beverage industry has opposed lowering the definition for
intoxication, arguing it would unfairly focus on social drinkers.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the .08 issue, Missouri stands to lose about $25
million in federal highway construction money if it does not adopt
a stricter law against open alcohol containers in vehicles and
tougher laws against repeat drunken drivers.
</P>
<P>
   If the measures fail, Missouri would still get the money, but it
could not be used for much-needed highway construction. Congress
has mandated that the money be used on safety programs.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Sen. Ed Quick of Liberty, president pro tem of the
Senate, said Monday he thinks a measure to forbid open alcohol
containers in the passenger area of vehicles has a good chance of
passing next year.
</P>
<P>
   But Quick was more cautious about measures against repeat
offenders, which include impoundment of vehicles and mandatory
minimum penalties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure tougher penalties are the answer,'' he said. ``We
need to enforce the laws we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Rep. Henry Rizzo of Kansas City, however, said the
state cannot afford to risk losing federal dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to do whatever it takes to keep the
highway money because our highway department is in total disarray
right now,'' Rizzo said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Carnahan has said the governor will support the
.08 issue, tougher rules against repeat drunken drivers and open
container restrictions. House Speaker Steve Gaw has said he
supports Carnahan on those issues.
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri Department of Public Safety and Mothers Against
Drunk Driving also support .08 legislation, the open-container law
and tougher penalties for repeat offenders. MADD plans an
aggressive strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend to be on the offensive this year,'' said Paula
Kanyo, president of the Missouri chapter of MADD. ``This is the
year we say, `Why haven't you done something?' ''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the other measures, DePasco said he would like to
see tougher penalties linked to higher blood-alcohol levels because
evidence suggests drivers with a blood alcohol content of .13 or
higher cause more accidents and deaths. That position is supported
by spirits distillers and by MADD.
</P>
<P>
   DePasco also would like to see more cooperation between state
and local officials to keep better track of convicted alcohol
offenders to discourage them from relapsing.
</P>
<P>
   The special court that Beaird has in mind would be modeled after
existing drug courts, in which a judge supervises drug offenders
regularly for a year and directs them into treatment, counseling or
short jail terms.
</P>
<P>
   Beaird said the Jackson County program would send drunken
drivers with three or more convictions to 120 days in prison and
then to the special court. Drivers who fail to complete the year of
treatment could go back to prison for four more years.
</P>
<P>
   The program would be similar to one now operating in Buchanan
County, Mo., and at about a dozen courts nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Beaird said Jackson County would also put some repeat offenders
on a drug called naltrexone to kill the desire for alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Beaird said he may seek some funding assistance for his new
court from the state. Such a request could come before the House
appropriations committee for education and public safety, which is
led by Democratic Rep. Scott Lakin of Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Lakin, who last year sponsored a bill to register beer-keg
rentals as a deterrent to underage drinking, said Monday he
supports a comprehensive package against alcohol offenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to make sure we do something that is not just cosmetic
but something that is really good public policy,'' Lakin said.

HELD 12 HOURS ON LICENSE VIOLATION, KNICKS' WALLACE SAYS POLICE
DEMEANED HIM 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After being arrested in Manhattan early Monday for
driving with a suspended license and spending 12 hours in jail, New
York Knicks forward John Wallace described the police treatment of
him as demeaning and believed he was picked on because of his race
and celebrity as an athlete.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace said he was handcuffed and placed in a van after the
police stopped him at a routine checkpoint on West 43rd Street
around 2 a.m. Wallace said the police told him his license had been
suspended since Dec. 9, and that when he tried to explain how their
information was in error, he was ignored.
</P>
<P>
   On the way to a midtown precinct house, Wallace, who is black,
said one of the officers used a racial slur in describing people
standing outside of a club. Wallace said that when he was being
processed at the police station, one of the officers was bragging
about the number of celebrities he had arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see it in their faces, they were happy they got one,''
said Wallace, who was released after paying a $175 fine for driving
without a license.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a half hour after Wallace was stopped at the
checkpoint near Times Square, three people were wounded at a nearby
dance spot, Club New York. When asked where he was going when
stopped by the police, Wallace said, ``That's personal.''
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke with reporters on a conference call Monday
afternoon, Wallace remained upset at the situation and resented
being held in jail for 12 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is I spent a night in jail, they put me in cuffs and
it was demeaning to myself,'' Wallace said. ``They said I'd be let
go at 8 a.m. They knew I had practice. Finally, I was let go at 3
p.m.''
</P>
<P>
   The police said it was not uncommon for someone to spend the
night in jail while the paperwork is being processed through the
system. And Lt. Stephen Biegel, a police department spokesman, said
Wallace's car was not singled out and that officers stopped
everyone that passed through the safety checkpoint early Monday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wallace was asked to produce a license, and he didn't have one
on him so he gave them a passport for identification,'' Biegel
said. Wallace's name was run through a computer that is linked to
the state's Department of Motor Vehicles and his license came up
suspended for failure to answer a summons. Wallace said he never
received a summons and had taken a defensive-driving course Dec. 21
to erase 4 points of the 11 that were on his license for traffic
violations.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace said he was denied the opportunity to make a phone call
when he was arrested. But one police official said Wallace had a
friend with him who had a cell phone. The police allowed the friend
to contact Wallace's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Although Wallace was vocal in his anger toward the police
department, Biegel said they had not received a complaint from
Wallace about the way his situation was handled.
</P>

CLINTON TO SEEK CRACKDOWN ON INTERNET PHARMACIES
</HEADLINE>
 
(Subs for new final graf giving FDA Website address)  (jw) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Clinton administration officials said Monday that
they would ask Congress to regulate the growing sale of
prescription drugs over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said President Clinton would ask for
legislation requiring online pharmacies to get approval from the
Food and Drug Administration. In addition, they said, he will ask
Congress to beef up the agency's investigative powers and increase
the penalties for online sales of prescription drugs to people
without prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals are also intended to make it easier for the
government to stop online sales of unapproved drugs, counterfeit
drugs and products promoted with fraudulent claims.
</P>
<P>
   There is no federal certification program for online pharmacies
and, operating in cyberspace, many of them do not get the state
licenses that are required of traditional drug stores. Policing
these stores and their sales of prescription drugs has been
difficult, federal officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jane Henney, the commissioner of food and drugs, said
Clinton's proposal would create civil penalties of up to $500,000
for selling a prescription drug to a person who did not have a
valid prescription or for operating without federal certification.
Federal officials say they now have difficulty prosecuting online
pharmacies and fines are usually limited to $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   As part of his budget request next month, White House officials
said, Clinton will seek $10 million to hire 100 people and upgrade
computer technology to investigate Web sites suspected of illegally
dispensing prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Monday night, Dr. Henney said the proposal
called for screening out disreputable online pharmacies and made
getting inappropriate drugs more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``The object of the whole proposal is to to make sure there's a
strong safety net for patients,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jeffrey Shuren, a medical officer at the FDA, said the
agency was already investigating more than 200 Web sites suspected
of selling unapproved drugs or selling approved medications without
valid prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   Under Clinton's proposal, the FDA would be given power to issue
administrative subpoenas compelling online pharmacies to provide
records for federal investigators. The administration said it would
protect patients' privacy, but did not give details.
</P>
<P>
   William Hubbard, a senior associate commissioner at the agency,
said: ``Online pharmacies come and go daily. Some are fly-by-night
operations. Some are located overseas.''
</P>
<P>
   In a document describing its plan to regulate online pharmacies,
the White House says sites will have to demonstrate that are
licensed by a state before they can be certified. The new federal
rules would, in effect, piggyback on state regulations on the
practice of medicine and pharmacy and would not replace them, the
document added. The White House document says that Internet
pharmacies now often ``bypass traditional safeguards against the
use of unsafe or inappropriate drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   If, for example, an online pharmacy based in Florida sold
prescription drugs to consumers in New York, the pharmacy would
have to comply with licensing requirements in both states, federal
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton plans to announce his proposals this week. A
White House official said: ``Internet pharmacies are not all bad.
Sometimes you can get access to quality prescription drugs at lower
prices in a more convenient way over the Internet. The president's
proposals are intended to target the bad apples who purvey fraud on
the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   To order drugs from an online pharmacy, a customer uses a
computer to visit the company's Web site. Many sites offer
information about drugs and diseases. Reputable companies insist on
getting a prescription from the patient or the doctor.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study by doctors at the University of Pennsylvania said
that it was alarmingly easy for consumers to get prescription drugs
without seeing a physician or a pharmacist.
</P>
<P>
   States have traditionally regulated the prescribing and
dispensing of drugs, the study said. But several states have found
it difficult to locate and prosecute online violators because the
prescriber, seller and buyer may be in different states.
</P>
<P>
   Several state attorneys general have filed lawsuits against Web
site owners, alleging violations of state laws _ for example,
providing drugs without a local pharmacy license or mailing drugs
to minors. In some cases, drugs are sent from online pharmacies
overseas, so it is difficult for federal and state authorities to
take action against them.
</P>
<P>
   The Pennsylvania study found 86 Web sites that sold Viagra
without requiring a doctor's visit or a prescription. Twenty-two of
the sites appeared to be based outside the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Matthew E. Naythons, vice president of one of the best-known
online pharmacies, PlanetRx.com, based in South San Francisco,
questioned the need for more regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are licensed to dispense drugs in all 50 states,'' he said.
``There are sufficient rules and regulations at the state level to
govern the practice of online pharmacy. Legitimate pharmacies
conform to those state regulations. To layer on another level of
regulation, at the federal level, would seem to be unnecessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Contrasting his company with some of its competitors, Naythons
said: ``At PlanetRx, we dispense medication. We don't prescribe it.
We are like your neighborhood pharmacy, but we have 35 million to
40 million branch offices through desktop computers. We want to
speak to your physician in every case, to verify your prescription,
unless we get it through the mail.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, other companies are not always so scrupulous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some online pharmacies _ rogue sites _ prescribe and
dispense,'' Naythons said. ``You can log on, complete a brief
questionnaire online and get Viagra or other drugs without seeing a
doctor in person.''
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration established a Web site last
week to give consumers information about buying drugs and medical
products online. The address is www.fda.gov.

ISLANDERS' LUONGO BLANKS BRUINS TO EARN HIS FIRST SHUTOUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JENNY KELLNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ It was a month ago that Roberto Luongo stepped
off the Islanders' flight in Boston, not knowing when he would make
his first start in goal. And it was not until Luongo had eaten
breakfast when Coach Butch Goring told the 20-year-old rookie, who
had been called up six days earlier to replace the injured backup
Wade Flaherty, that he would make his National Hockey League debut
against the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   Since that day, Nov. 28, Luongo has gone from being a highly
regarded prospect to his current status as the Islanders' premier
goaltender in the aftermath of Felix Potvin's trade to Vancouver
and Flaherty's season-ending shoulder injury.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, before a crowd of 9,644, Luongo stopped 34 shots
as the Islanders defeated the Bruins, 3-0, to win consecutive games
for the first time this season. The Islanders (9-19-5) are 3-1-1
over their last five.
</P>
<P>
   Mats Lindgren scored the first goal for the Islanders 38 seconds
into the second period. After Mariusz Czerkawski made a steal at
midice, he spun 360 degrees before putting the puck onto Lindgren's
stick to set up the goal for a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders went up by 2-0 at 11 minutes 55 seconds of the
second period when Bill Muckalt, one of three players acquired in
the Dec. 19 trade for Potvin, picked up the rebound of Gino
Odjick's shot from the left side of the net and put it past Robbie
Tallas for his fifth goal of the season and first as an Islander.
</P>
<P>
   Niklas Andersson scored his third goal of the season at 15:28 of
the third period, unassisted, to put the game out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   As he had been in his debut, Luongo was steady and sometimes
spectacular. He was also lucky, when Darren Van Impe's hard shot
late in the second period went over his glove and clanked off the
right post.
</P>
<P>
   In his debut, Luongo had stopped 43 shots, a franchise record
for saves by a rookie in his first start, in the Islanders' 2-1
victory. He also had become only the fourth goaltender in the 90s
to stop 40 or more shots in his debut.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very special,'' said Luongo, who is 3-4-1 since being
called up from the Lowell Lock Monsters of the American Hockey
League. ``I'll remember it the rest of my life. But I try not to
dwell on the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Luongo, who was the highest-drafted goalie in league history
when the Islanders picked him fourth over all in 1997, launched his
career as the team began a prolonged skid. After the victory in
Boston, the Islanders went nine games without a victory before
defeating the Devils, 5-3, with Luongo stopping 46 shots Dec. 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's mentally a lot better than I first anticipated,'' Goring
said. ``Roberto has impressed us in a lot of ways, but he still
needs to work on a few areas. But he's shown that he's going to be
a big part of this franchise's future. You have to remember we have
Kevin Weekes as well. He has some very good skills as he showed
against the Rangers, where he was excellent. We're not going to let
Roberto go the whole way this season. Both guys are going to get
their playing time and they'll develop.''

   Here is Anne Stephenson's New &AMP; Notable book-review column:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
``PILGRIM'' &QL; 
By Timothy Findley (HarperCollins, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This fascinating novel should bring a whole new audience to its
Canadian author. Findley's story begins in 1912, two days after the
sinking of the Titanic, when a man named Pilgrim hangs himself from
a tree in the garden of his London house. A doctor pronounces him
dead, but a few hours later his heart begins to beat again. It is
Pilgrim's dilemma and curse: He cannot die. He refuses to speak
after this latest of several suicide attempts, so his dear friend,
the enigmatic Lady Sybil Quartermaine, takes him to a psychiatric
hospital in Zurich in the hopes that he might be inspired once
again to embrace life. At the hospital, he comes into the care of
psychologist Carl Jung, who discovers in Pilgrim's journals the
secret of his private agony. Pilgrim has been alive forever. He has
seen feast and famine, the Italian Renaissance, all of the wars
ever fought. He has known Leonardo da Vinci (who is portrayed in
Pilgrim's journals as a tormented brute whose ``Mona Lisa'' has an
ugly secret behind it), Saint Teresa of Avila, Auguste Rodin, Oscar
Wilde and other luminous characters. He is weary of the human
condition, and he wants to die. It's up to Jung to decide: Is
Pilgrim delusional, or do his journals recount what really
happened? Findley mixes fact with fiction, presenting it with such
sure-footedness that we read it as true believers. Pilgrim's story
is not the only one here. There's the complex relationship between
Jung and his wife, Emma; the competitive interplay between doctors
at the hospital; the touching loyalty of Pilgrim's valet, Forster;
and the fate of Lady Quartermaine (the only episode that takes a
wacky turn in this otherwise elegantly imaginative novel). Findley,
a former actor, writes with intelligence and an instinct for
entertainment. His book is a dazzling start to the new year. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``THE COLLECTIBLE GI JOE'' &QL; 
By Derryl DePriest (Running Press, $19.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not being well-versed in Joe's history, New &AMP; Notable was
shocked to see photos of him in the early 1970s, when he had
``Life-Like Hair and Beard'' (as the toy company called it) and
looked vaguely like a Chia Pet. No matter. We were in our
anti-military phase then, and even though the hairy figures were
meant to be conciliatory _ they wore dog tags that looked
suspiciously like peace medallions _ no one was buying GI Joes.
Today, Joe is a nostalgic icon for lots of former little boys. They
will love this book, and so will their own kids. Some lucky guy
sure had fun staging the photos, dressing the Joes in their
camouflage ensembles, posing them around their pup tents, arranging
their weapons, connecting their parachutes and squeezing them into
their little scuba suits. There's even a picture of the rare
Bulletman, a failed attempt to inject a superhero element into GI
Joe, and of another failure (today, she's worth a mint), the 1967
GI Action Girl Nurse, who looks lost amid all this implied
testosterone. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``THE MODEL WIFE'' &QL; 
By Arthur Ollman (Bulfinch, $65) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ollman looks at marriages that also have been photographic
collaborations, with wives serving as ongoing subjects for their
husbands' cameras. You've seen some of these photographs before _
Edward Weston's images of his young wife, Charis; Alfred
Stieglitz's of the angular Georgia O'Keeffe; or Harry Callahan's
innovative shots of his willing Eleanor. But consider the work of
Seiichi Furuya, which shows Christine Gossler as a happy young
woman when they married in 1978, then follows her as she descends
into mental illness. In 1985, she jumped from the top of their
nine-story apartment building. Furuya had come up to look for her,
and he made a photograph of her body on the ground below. That
image, which is almost unbearable to see, is here in miniature,
part of a contact sheet that also includes shots taken before her
death and later from the ground, as her body is covered with a
blanket and guarded by a police officer. Contrast these with Baron
Adolph de Meyer's glamorous portraits of his wife, Olga (he was a
homosexual and their marriage was thought to be chaste _ Olga was,
Ollman writes, his ``passport to credibility and social
acceptability'') or with Nicholas Nixon's intimate, affectionate
photos of Bebe, his wife of 27 years. In the end, this book is as
much about marriage as it is about photography. The images, Ollman
says, ``represent some of the deepest, most passionate
announcements the photographic lexicon allows.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This work is about personal exposure. This is where the camera
shoots in both directions.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
``O.K. YOU MUGS'' &QL; 
Edited by Luc Sante and Melissa Holbrook Pierson (Pantheon, $24) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This odd little anthology sheds some light on what is, if you
think about it, an odd little group. The subject is character
actors, those people who have appeared in film after film until the
familiarity of their faces becomes part of their effect as actors.
Among them: Warren Oates, Timothy Carey, Dana Andrews, J.T. Walsh,
Dan Duryea, Thelma Ritter, Nick Adams, Wallace Beery, William
Bendix, Ralph Bellamy and Leo G. Carroll. They are, Sante and
Pierson say, ``the screen's ordinary Joes, those who therefore
render themselves extraordinary.'' Why, then, have they included a
rogue essay on Elizabeth Taylor, hardly an ``ordinary Joe''? She is
one of those actors, Sante and Pierson say, ``who, with a talent
for reversal, manage to render themselves ordinary by their
insistent wanderings through the realm of the personal.'' We'll
take their word for it. Contributors include Greil Marcus, Mark
Rudman, Chris Offutt and John Updike, who tells of his love for
Doris Day in his much-anthologized 1983 essay, ``Suzie Creamcheese
Speaks.'' &QL;

 (RESENDING THIS ROUNDUP OF BIG BOOKS) 
 
 By ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.1999 Special for The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was
the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch
of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of
Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it
was the winter of despair . . .''
</P>
<P>
   ``THE SIXTIES'' &QL; 
Richard Avedon &QL; 
(Random House/Kodak, $75) &UR;
</P>
<P>
   It's my pleasure to tell you that Richard Avedon's new book,
``The Sixties,'' begins not with a photographic image but with the
opening paragraph of ``A Tale of Two Cities, words written 140
years ago but so remarkably suited to the edgy chaos of the 1960s
that you'll wonder whether Charles Dickens shared some funny
cigarettes with Abbie Hoffman in another life.
</P>
<P>
   Avedon and his collaborator, Doon Arbus, have put together a
book that shows the decade in all its abrasive and contradictory
glory. Notice the juxtaposition of Rose Kennedy and Janis Joplin
(at opposite ends of the book, each wearing her version of finery
and an eerie frown), Truman Capote displaying his belly button and
Andy Warhol his scars, the stiff stare of Henry Kissinger and the
serene gaze of Cesar Chavez. There's the requisite nudity _ female
breasts are outnumbered, for once, by male genitalia _ and every so
often a splash of color that reminds us that psychedelic was a
household word. It will make you squirm, and it will make you laugh
_ a '60s effect indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other big books you might spend your money on this
Christmas season:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
``ILLUSTRATED LETTERS: ARTISTS AND WRITERS CORRESPOND'' &QL; 
Edited by Roselyne de Ayala and Jean-Pierre Gueno (Abrams, $60). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here is the art of the handwritten letter taken to grand
heights. The editors have gathered more than 60 letters written by
European artists and authors of the 19th and 20th centuries. Some
are just notes with doodles in the margins. Others are illustrated
with exquisite sketches and watercolor scenes. Among the generous
correspondents: Honore de Balzac, Victor Hugo, Guy de Maupassant,
Arthur Rimbaud, Auguste Rodin, Edouard Manet, Vincent van Gogh,
Paul Gaugin, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Pablo Picasso, Max Jacob
and Antoine de Saint-Exupery. With a foreword by Francine Prose. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``FAY'' &QL; 
William Wegman (Hyperion, $26.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you've grown tired of Wegman's ubiquitous Weimaraners, this
book might pull you back into the fold. The text that accompanies
Wegman's photos of his beloved Fay Ray and her offspring, Battina
(who stayed on after Fay's other puppies went off to new homes),
reminds us that these were DOGS, that in addition to their work
with Wegman _ Fay, especially, knew how to hold a pose _ they
chased balls, hurled themselves into swimming pools, played in the
mud, mated, gave birth and changed their owner's life in ways not
just professional. If there's a dog lover on your Christmas list,
look here. &QL; 
 &QL; 
WOMEN &QL; 
Annie Leibovitz, with an essay by Susan Sontag (Random House,
$75). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Portraits of women, celebrated and obscure. It begins with a
photograph of Leibovitz's mother, then moves on to farmers, maids,
astronauts, soldiers, battered wives, Supreme Court judges,
showgirls and bull riders. More familiar faces are those of
Elizabeth Taylor, architect Maya Lin, writers Eudora Welty and
Jamaica Kincaid, Yoko Ono, Susan Sarandon, Joni Mitchell, Serena
and Venus Williams, Hillary Clinton and Madeleine Albright. It's
worth the price of admission just to see the kind gaze of the late
Osceola McCarty, who worked for 75 years as a Mississippi
washerwoman, then donated $150,000 that she'd saved over her
lifetime to establish a college scholarship for African-American
students in need. &QL; 
 &QL; 
THE ART OF THE MARKET &QL; 
Bob Tamarkin and Les Krantz (ST&AMP;C, $35). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An illustrated history of American business as seen through its
stock certificates. The paper certificates that were proof of
ownership before the days of electronic trading are becoming
financial artifacts with a value of their own. From a terrier named
Prince, who appeared on certificates issued by Farmers Deposit
National Bank in Pittsburgh in the early 1900s (Prince's owner was
the bank president), to the nude woman on certificates for Playboy
Enterprises, Tamarkin and Krantz show how whimsical a marriage of
art and commerce can be. &QL; 
``AND THE CROWD GOES WILD'' &QL; 
Joe Garner (Sourcebooks, $49.95). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The big draw is not the book, which is nothing extraordinary,
but two CDs that offer broadcasts of some of the most memorable
moments in sports. Included are Lou Gehrig saying goodbye to
baseball; Bill Mazeroski's home run in the 1960 World Series; the
Green Bay Packers' win over Dallas in December 1967; Bob Beamon's
long jump in the 1968 Olympics; Secretariat's triumph in the Triple
Crown; the Borg-McEnroe match at Wimbledon in 1980; Tiger Woods'
triumph at the 1997 Masters; Michael Jordan's sixth NBA
championship; and the U.S. women's win in soccer's 1999 World Cup.
With a foreword by Hank Aaron, an afterword by Wayne Gretzky, and
narration by Bob Costas. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``SNAKE'' &QL; 
Chris Mattison (DK, $29.95). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Big, bold pictures of creatures you don't want to find under
your Christmas tree. There are more than 60 individual species from
all over the world in Mattison's ``gallery,'' with information
about environment, anatomy, reproduction, and hunting and feeding.
A starter for would-be herpetologists. &QL; 
``NORMAN ROCKWELL: PICTURES FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE''  &QL; 
(Abrams, $35). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you love the paintings of Norman Rockwell, you can come out
of the closet now. Critics and art historians who previously looked
down their noses at Rockwell are now celebrating his influence on
the American psyche. This book, published in conjunction with the
traveling exhibition of the same name, includes 80 of Rockwell's
paintings, as well as essays not only by curators and historians
but by Robert Coles and Rockwell's son, Peter. The paintings are
anecdotal and as familiar as your own memories. The essays at times
seem like a collective  &UR; mea culpa offered to a man long regarded as
a mere illustrator, and to the people who have admired him for
decades. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``AFRICAN CEREMONIES'' &QL; 
Carol Beckwith and Angela Fisher &UR; Abrams, $150) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This slip-cased, two-volume set weighs 16 pounds, covers 26
countries and contains descriptions and photographs of more than 40
ceremonies, some of which will make you flinch just to think about
them. Spectacularly illustrated, it's the cornerstone of the
authors' effort to document vanishing tribal customs in Africa. &QL; 
``NEW YORK: AN ILLUSTRATED HISTORY'' &QL; 
Ric Burns and James Sanders &UR; (Knopf, $60). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a good deal of strolling on the thin edge of
nothingness. A splattering of fiery particles cascades down from
the torches that the steel workers use for cutting 10-ton girders
in half and for lighting their cigarettes.'' That's how the ``New
York Times'' described the spectacular bravado of the men who built
the Empire State Building in 1930, one of the best stories in this
elegant companion volume to the public television documentary
written and directed by Burns. &QL; 
``EARLY DYLAN'' &QL; 
Photographs by Barry Feinstein, Daniel Kramer and Jim Marshall
(Bulfinch, $35). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It could break your heart, he looks so young and happy. So do
Joan Baez and Mary Travers and even Johnny Cash. They stay that way
within the confines of this slim book, unlike the aging Dylan we
see in Richard Avedon's ``The Sixties.'' This collection of
photographs is a slice of '60s life that skirts the flamboyance and
focuses on a handful of people, their friendships and their music.
With a short foreword by Arlo Guthrie. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``YACHTING'S GOLDEN AGE'' &QL; 
Ed Holm (Knopf, $65) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here are more than 100 glass-plate images documenting yachting's
glory days, from 1880 to 1905. You don't have to know much about
sailing to see that these boats were extraordinary, each a
one-of-a-kind, handcrafted vessel with a unique personality. When
seen from across an expanse of water, they looked, Holm writes,
like ``a flight of giant migrating butterflies,'' their sails
swollen all out of proportion to the tiny crafts below. These
images were made by a handful of pioneering maritime photographers,
who used techniques developed in the years after the Civil War.

VALLEY FLU-MERGENCY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By HEATHER ROMERO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A nasty strain of the flu has invaded the Metro Phoenix area,
flooding emergency rooms and forcing many hospitals to send
patients elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just got bombed,'' said Deb Howard, Desert Samaritan
Medical Center's assistant emergency department director.
</P>
<P>
   The Mesa hospital, as well as several others across the Metro
Phoenix area, set records Sunday for numbers treated in the
emergency room. The flu-stricken crowds forced at least six Valley
hospitals to close their emergency rooms Sunday and Monday and
reroute incoming patients to other hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like it's pretty bad this year,'' Lora Dosh,
Thunderbird Samaritan Medical Center assistant emergency room
director, said Monday afternoon. She noted that the hospital was
diverting patients again, after doing so for nearly three hours
during the morning.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital also ran out of space, which caused a backup in the
emergency room with patients who were admitted and waiting for
rooms, Dosh said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times they're sitting in the ER for 12 to 24 hours,''
she said. ``We're having to learn how to be floor nurses as well as
ER nurses.''
</P>
<P>
   Hospital officials urged people to visit their family doctors
first and use emergency rooms as a last resort.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency room visitors can expect to wait an average of two
hours, although a four-hour wait was not unheard of Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people can be frustrated with a wait, but they don't know
that through the ambulance entrance two or three people could have
come in with a heart attack or internal injuries,'' said Kay
Sperduti, Scottsdale Healthcare spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Outside that Scottsdale emergency room Monday, Dale Duckworth,
57, waited for his name to be called.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been through so many boxes of Kleenex,'' the Scottsdale
man said. ``It's not fun stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   But he was unperturbed by the wait, saying the alternative was
to lie in bed miserable.
</P>
<P>
   At Desert Samaritan in Mesa, Penny Bylina rocked her 7-month-old
son in a pediatric emergency room. Baby Jordan had red, puffy eyes,
fever and a nasty cough, and snuggled close to his mother, seeking
relief from his first case of the flu.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctors are full and we couldn't get him in until
tomorrow,'' said Bylina, 34, of Apache Junction, explaining why she
brought him to the emergency room. ``He's been like this since
Christmas Eve.''
</P>
<P>
   Desert Samaritan treated a record 319 people Sunday in its
emergency room. It normally handles about 230 a day. Scottsdale
Healthcare Osborn also set a record Sunday, treating 182 patients,
compared with its average of 110 to 120 a day.
</P>
<P>
   Sperduti said the flu strain seems particularly nasty this year
and has worsened patients' suffering.
</P>
<P>
   ``They feel so horrible,'' she said. ``They feel like they're
going to die and think: What if this isn't the flu?''
</P>
<P>
   So they flock to the emergency room.
</P>
<P>
   Because influenza is caused by viruses that infect the
respiratory tract, antibiotics are not an effective treatment. The
treatments prescribed most are ones that ease the symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mark Rudinsky, an epidemiologist at Good Samaritan Regional
Medical Center, said most influenza cases he's seen so far are of
the Type A strain.
</P>
<P>
   Influenza viruses are divided into three types, A, B and C,
according to the Web site of the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in Atlanta. Types A and B cause upper respiratory
symptoms and are responsible for the outbreaks that occur almost
every winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``About every nine or 10 years a brand new strain develops that
might not be in the vaccine. That does not seem to be the case so
far this year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's the good news.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news: He predicts it will get worse before it gets
better.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really the beginning of this year's cases,'' he said.
``We'll probably see it for at least another month or two.''
</P>
<P>
   And emergency room workers, often battling their own cases of
the flu, also fear what's ahead: Y2K. But it's not the computer
glitches or power failures they fear. It's the people hazards.
</P>
<P>
   New Year's Eve traditionally brings people injured in drunken
driving accidents and gunshot victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Added on to the flu, it's going to be really busy,''
Thunderbird Samaritan's Lora Dosh said. &QL;

EXIT INTERVIEW SHOULD BE HANDLED WITH GRACE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Ken Lloyd _ a specialist in organizational behavior _ is a
columnist for the Los Angeles Daily News. His column moves Mondays

260057, Encino, Calif. 91426 or by electronic mail to

By KEN LLOYD  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: I will be giving two weeks' notice to leave after the first
of the year. The problem is that our manager insists on exit
interviews, and I have heard from others that the session is
stressful and filled with harsh questions and insulting comments. I
don't know if I should just sit there, fight back, or try to avoid
the interview altogether. E.S.
</P>
<P>
   A: In the words of Jerry Seinfeld, your manager sounds like a
``bad breaker upper.'' Exit interviews are not supposed to be a
time to grind an employee down with brutal questioning, nor a time
to put an employee down with derogatory comments.
</P>
<P>
   It makes far more sense for management to use these interviews
as an opportunity to learn about the employees' perceptions of the
company and the reasons for wanting to leave. These interviews can
provide management with an excellent opportunity to gather valuable
data that can lead to reduced turnover.
</P>
<P>
   Although you have the option of avoiding the exit interview
altogether, it is possible that much of the talk that you have
heard about these interviews is exaggerated. And if you enter this
interview expecting the worst, you are actually increasing the
likelihood of a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   You should go to the session, listen to what your manager has to
say, and then use a calm and businesslike approach to provide some
specific feedback on the company and on this session if warranted.
Let your final act with the company be a class act.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The owner of the small company where I work is wonderful, but
we have all noticed that he is more forgetful, short-fused and
argumentative in the afternoons. We know that he has a drink or two
at lunch, and we think this is part of it, but none of us want to
tell him. How should we handle this? B.T.
</P>
<P>
   A: It is entirely possible that the happy hour at lunch can lead
to the nasty hours shortly thereafter. At the same time, the change
in the owner's behavior can be due to a number of other
physiological factors.
</P>
<P>
   If the owner is truly ``wonderful,'' then you should have an
open, honest and communicative working relationship with him. If
you and some of your associates are particularly close to him, you
may be doing him a huge favor by meeting with him to talk about
what you have observed.
</P>
<P>
   It is very important to set the right stage for this type of
meeting. Obviously, it should be in the morning, and on a
relatively quiet day at work. The discussion should be private,
confidential, and free of interruptions.
</P>
<P>
   You are not meeting with him to criticize or complain. Your
messages should be that you have noticed some behaviors that do not
seem like him, you are concerned about his health, and you want to
know if there is anything you can do to help. Give him examples of
the specific behaviors, and then let him talk.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, you have done all you can do. The question then
becomes whether he will do likewise.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Several months ago, one of my associates' desk drawers was
jammed. No one could open it, but I have a small set of tools in my
office. I went over, unscrewed part of the drawer, and got it open.
The problem is that since then, I have become the informal office
handyman. This is a major interruption, but it is hard to say no.
What can I do? T.K.
</P>
<P>
   A: Do you have any idea how hard it is to find a good handyman?!
All right, it's true, your associates are taking advantage of you
and your handy skills.
</P>
<P>
   You solved one small problem with a screwdriver, and by doing so
created a huge problem for yourself. Once the word of your skills
got out, it was just a matter of time before you jumped to the top
of everyone's speed dial.
</P>
<P>
   There are a couple of ways to deal with this. While it may be
tempting to trash a few jobs so that the word gets out that you
have lost your touch, that could have other repercussions. A better
approach is for you to be honest with the people who use you as a
tool. Let them know that you are too busy, and suggest that they
call building maintenance or whomever else the company suggests in
such situations.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, if you enjoy tinkering and the recognition and
accomplishment that go with it, you should pick and choose the jobs
you like and do them when the time is right for you. After all, if
you spend too much time unjamming drawers, you will find yourself
in a far bigger jam.

MANN CHAIN AGREES TO SALE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Jason Takenouchi 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- WestStar Cinemas Inc., the bankrupt owner of the
Mann Theatres chain, has agreed to sell its theater holdings for
more than $91 million to WF Cinema Holdings LP, a limited
partnership affiliated with Time Warner Entertainment Co. and
Viacom Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The sale will be completed by Jan. 31 unless another bidder tops
WF Cinema's offer. If a competing bid is received before Jan. 4 the
deadline set by U.S. District Court Judge Joseph J. Farnan Jr.
WestStar's holdings will be auctioned off on Jan. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Encino-based WestStar operates 53 Mann theater complexes in
Colorado and California, including the landmark Mann's Chinese
Theatrein Hollywood. Other area locations include the Plant 16 in
Van Nuys, the six-screen Agoura Mann, the Village 8 in Westlake
Village, the eight-screen Janss Marketplace in Thousand Oaks, the
seven-screen Mann in Valencia and the 10-screen Exchange in
Glendale.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Skislock, an entertainment analyst with Irvine-based
Laguna Research Partners, said several theater companies may be
interested in purchasing the 351-screen Mann chain despite ongoing
concerns over its aging inventory of theaters. One potential
suitor, Pacific Theaters of Los Angeles, said earlier this year
that it had offered to buy Mann.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a very aggressive, very rapid consolidation going
on,'' Skislock said.
</P>
<P>
   Owning the Mann chain could also benefit studios such as Warner
Bros. a unit of Time Warner as they struggle with a
rapidly-consolidating theater industry that is seeking a bigger
share of box office revenues, Skislock said.
</P>
<P>
   WestStar purchased the Mann chain in 1997 from a partnership
that included Warner Bros. and Paramount Studios. Since the
purchase, WestStar has lagged behind its competitors in the
construction of larger megaplexes that now dominate the theater
market. Its only Southern California megaplex is the Plant 16 in
Van Nuys.
</P>
<P>
   The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in
September amid speculation that some underperforming theaters could
close. WestStar officials declined to comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposed deal with WF Cinema, WestStar would receive
$46 million up front and another $45 million by Oct. 15, according
to court documents. WF Cinema also would have to take on several
financial obligations, including any sales taxes paid in connection
with the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Viacom and Warner Bros. are listed as the guarantors of the
arrangement, and WF Cinema's mailing address is in care of Warner
Bros. in Burbank.
</P>
<P>
   WF Cinema's $91 million offer is far below the replacement cost
of Mann's 351 movie screens, according to Skislock, the
entertainment analyst. Excluding land costs, construction of new
movie theaters currently runs about $500,000 per screen, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The relatively low purchase price for Mann reflects the
continuing competitive troubles for older theaters including many
Mann theaters as larger, more spacious multiplexes open up across
the country, Skislock said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customers are showing a tendency to gravitate toward the newer
theaters,'' he said. ``It's a risky business buying existing
theaters.''
</P>
<P>
   Any competing buyer will have to bid at least $95 million for
the Mann chain, including $50 million up front, according to the
judge's ruling.

HERBALS' DANGERS IGNORED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KELLY PEARCE  
 and RANDY CORDOVA  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The word is getting around about furanone di-hydro and other
herbal supplements, but coaches and health officials fear it's the
wrong one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids only hear what they want to hear,'' said Ken Jackmann, a
registered nurse at Maricopa Medical Center who has been
weight-training for eight years.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not going to hear that Tom Gugliotta had a seizure
after taking this. They're going to hear that he took it, and that
makes it OK.''
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration has documented one death and
more than 50 adverse effects tied to furanone di-hydro, which
Phoenix Suns forward Gugliotta acknowledged ingesting before
suffering a seizure Dec. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, a 16-year-old Peoria boy collapsed during a
gym class at Centennial High School after taking Verve, one of
several brand names containing furanone di-hydro, which claims to
enhance sleep and help muscles rebuild.
</P>
<P>
   Herbal supplements, which aren't regulated by the FDA, are
available over the Internet and in some health stores, and they're
advertised in magazines. There's also plenty of word-of-mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Americans spend about $4 billion a year on herbal supplements
such as saw palmetto, ginseng and others that promise to do
everything from ease depression, shrink swollen prostates and fight
colds.
</P>
<P>
   A 1997 survey by ``Prevention'' magazine reported that 60
million adults use herbs to treat illnesses. Forty-one percent of
Americans learn about herbal remedies through friends and family,
the No. 1 source of information.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been some members who have asked about it,'' said
Patrick Holloway, a fitness director at the Central Park Square
Athletic Club. ``But it's really nothing to be toyed with. The
danger of it isn't really stressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Although they may be well-intentioned, many who use the compound
don't understand what they're getting into, said Richard Thomas,
director of the Samaritan Regional Poison Center. Sometimes,
appropriate dosages are unclear and different bodies can react
differently to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're looking for any way you can to get an edge,'' Thomas
said. ``Just look at Mark McGwire.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Major League Baseball's home-run star acknowledged
using androstenedione, a testosterone-producing pill that's legal
in baseball but banned in other sports.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the recent publicity over furanone di-hydro results in
the supplement being pulled from the market, these things tend to
be cyclical, Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the poison center received 75 calls from people who had
taken gamma hydroxzybutyric acid, which in various forms has been
sold as a muscle builder and aphrodisiac.
</P>
<P>
   It has been outlawed, Thomas said, but the trend seems to be
that once a substance is made illegal, another one like it takes
its place in the legal world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think it's unfortunate that we still have the mentality
that if it's over the counter and a natural product that it's got
to be safe,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   George Toro, herb department manager at Gentle Strength
Cooperative in Tempe, says herb shoppers must be savvy shoppers.
Scrutinize the labels, he advises.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because something is a natural herb doesn't mean it's
safe,'' he said, adding that his store doesn't stock Verve or other
supplements he calls extreme.
</P>
<P>
   At Advanced Health &AMP; Wellness Center in north Phoenix, customers
are encouraged to undergo an assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to teach you so you can walk out of here and start to
take control of your health,'' said Vimal Patel, a pharmacist and
clinical nutritionist. ``There is no magic pill.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the center is across the street from Paradise Valley
High School, students stroll in and ask about herbal supplements.
He discourages them, because teenage bodies produce an abundance of
hormones.
</P>
<P>
   At Horizon High School in Scottsdale, football coach Doug
Shaffer, who also works with players in the weight room, hasn't yet
heard of herbal supplements among his charges.
</P>
<P>
   However, last year, half his team was taking creatine, similar
to the substance McGwire took. This year, it has fallen out of
favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes in cycles,'' Shaffer said. ``I don't push these
things. It's scary. There's not enough background on them, like
what it does to your body in the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   A sampling of coaches and players across the Metro Phoenix area
revealed that many had heard about herbal supplements, but few
thought they were being used at their schools. However, some of the
youngsters have tried other things.
</P>
<P>
   Marcos de Niza High School senior Eddie Carrillo says he took
creatine for six months before football season this fall and saw
results, not problems. But he has steered clear of herbal
supplements because he doesn't know enough about them.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're an athlete, you want to do better and get
bigger,'' the 18-year-old said. ``If you really want to take that
stuff (herbal supplements), make sure you know all about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Quint Swanberg, a gridder and wrestler at Horizon, has dabbled
in creatine as well as St. John's wort, to give him a mental boost.
</P>
<P>
   However, ``I think you should rely on your own performance,
genetics and all that,'' the 18-year-old senior said.
</P>
<P>
   At Mountain Ridge High School in Phoenix, football coach Jim
Ewan asks his students to tell him if they are using any
supplements so he can monitor their intake. However, if they see
the pitfalls of the products, including what happened to Gugliotta,
they might pause.
</P>
<P>
   ``The negative side can help to educate kids that these are
hazardous,'' Ewan said.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Farrell, football coach at St. Mary's High School in central
Phoenix, has a simple philosophy about ``the edge.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're looking for something beyond hard work, you're going
in the wrong direction,'' he said. &QL;
