<HEADLINE> Romania: National Development Plan for Years 2000-2002 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The Romanian Government
Thursday issued a decision regarding the elaboration of the
National Development Plan for years 2000-2002.
</P>
<P>
The plan is to ensure a harmonious economic and social
development of all the regions of the country and also to bring
Romania closer to the medium level of economic and social cohesion
reached by the European Union countries.
</P>
<P>
In order to fulfil that purpose the National Development Plan
includes the planning of the use of resources from the state
budget, from the local budgets and from foreign repayable and
unrepayable financial assistance which will be destined for the
strengthening of economic and social cohesion.
</P>
<P>
The Development Plan is part of the National Program for
Romanian's Accession to the EU and its elaboration is coordinated
by the National Agency for Regional Development.
</P>
<P>
The finalization of the document can lead to the granting to
Romania of additional non-reimbursable funds by the EU starting
the year 2000. About 500 million Euros are planned to be allotted
next year. This year the EU allotted Romania 117 million Euros.

<HEADLINE> China Refuses to Rule Out Use of Force Against Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 19 (Xinhua) -- China's consistent policy on
the Taiwan question is peaceful reunification on the basis of "one
country, two systems", but it refuses to rule out the use of
force, Chinese Ambassador to the United States Li Zhaoxing said at
a press conference here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We refuse to rule out the use of force. We keep that option
open not to target at the people in Taiwan, but to stop possible
Taiwan independence and foreign invasion or intervention against
the island," Li Zhaoxing said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government and people have both the determination
and capability to maintain China's sovereignty, unity and
territorial integrity, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Lee Teng-hui, the so-called "President" of Taiwan, could avoid
total condemnation only if he abandons his "state-to-state"
fallacy and returns to the "one China" principle, he added.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the recent remarks by some American politicians
that the U.S. would protect Taiwan militarily should China use
force on Taiwan, the ambassador said that Chinese people love
peace and long for peace, but they will not be cowed by threats
and blackmails from anyone.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan is part of China. It is not Florida, Hawaii or Guam.
The Taiwan issue is China's internal affair which brooks no
foreign interference," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said China has noted the U.S. government has committed to
follow the "one China" policy, abide by the three joint
communiques, and not to support Taiwan independence, "two Chinas"
or "one China, one Taiwan" and Taiwan's membership in the U.N. and
other international organizations where statehood is required.
</P>
<P>
"Only Lee Teng-hui wants a military flare-up between China and
U.S.," he said, "he wants Americans to do things for him at their
expense."
</P>
<P>
"What is in there for the vital U.S. interests? I hope people
with vision in this country can understand this and judge wisely."
</P>
<P>
The ambassador accused Lee Teng-hui of "racking his brains" to
undermine China-U.S. relations and to damage the basis for
cross-Straits dialog in an attempt to seek Taiwan independence.
</P>
<P>
"Lee Teng-hui's motive for putting forth the 'state-to-state'
doctrine is crystal clear. The crux of the matter is that he is
after Taiwan independence, denying the "one China" principle and
separating Taiwan from China," Li Zhaoxing said.
</P>
<P>
"Facts show that Lee Teng-hui is the biggest obstacle to the
cross-Straits dialog and China's peaceful reunification. He is the
biggest trouble-maker for China-U.S. relations. And for the time
being, he is also the biggest destabilizing factor in the
Asia-pacific region," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the question of Taiwan's entry into World Trade
Organization(WTO), the ambassador said as a separate customs
territory of China, Taiwan can join the WTO only after China has
become its member.

<HEADLINE> COMESA Members Urged to Back Insurance Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Member states of the Common
Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) have been urged to
support the insurance market to operationalize the ideals and
objectives of their regional cooperation strategies.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 8th annual general assembly of the Preferential
Trade Area (PTA) Re-Insurance company (ZEP-RE), Acting Secretary
General for COMESA Sindiso Ngwenya said the regional insurance
company has contributed a lot to COMESA's objective of creating
Free Trade Area by October next year.
</P>
<P>
He said the COMESA ZEP-RE has its origin in 1985 when PTA
Insurance and Re-insurance experts met for the first time to work
out the architecture for what is now known as the COMESA Yellow
Card Scheme or the Third Party Motor Vehicle Liability Insurance
Scheme.
</P>
<P>
At that meeting it was decided that after launching the Yellow
Card Scheme, the insurance companies constituting the Council of
Bureaux on the Yellow Card would explore the feasibility of
establishing an insurance pool to provide a re-insurance cover for
the Yellow Card Scheme.
</P>
<P>
ZEP-RE has since registered significant increase in its total
premium income from 4 million U.S. dollars in 1993 which was the
first year of operation to an estimated 13 million dollars in
1999, with the company's share-holders growing from 6 to 21.
</P>
<P>
With its number of signatory countries reaching 17 and a
business covering 19 African countries, ZEP-RE has now become an
important market player in the region and Africa, Ngwenya said.
</P>
<P>
It has also strengthened the capacity and solvency of insurance
industry in the region and enhanced the competitiveness of
domestic insurance companies with foreign insurers, he added.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, ZEP-RE is part of the illustrious COMESA
institutions that has ensured that regional economic cooperation
and integration ultimately benefits economic operators and civil
society.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of liberalizing the transport market will
begin in October this year with the abolition of bilateral or
transport services agreements for up to two flights between two
city pairs in member states, Ngwenya told the meeting.
</P>
<P>
This will result in improved inter-connectivity and
minimization of multiple layovers by passengers travelling within
COMESA. On October 31, 2000, the internal air transport market for
COMESA will come into place, he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the same assembly, Zambian Minister of Finance and
Economic Development Katele Kalumba urged ZEP-RE to be current in
paying out dividends to share-holders if it has to continue
attracting new investors.
</P>
<P>
He said all member states that are share-holders of the company
might expect a healthy return on their investment.
</P>
<P>
Kalumba also challenged member states and share-holders to
continue supporting the regional insurance company to ensure its
success.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Tragic Scene in Izmit Street </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADAPAZARI, TURKEY, August 19 (Xinhua) -- A walk along Izmit
Street bore heartbreaking testimony to the havoc caused by the
devastating earthquake which struck western Turkey early Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Izmit Street has been pinpointed as the hardest-hit area in
Adapazari province in northwestern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
All the buildings lining up on both sides of the previously
bustling street were devastated in the quake.
</P>
<P>
At one end of the 400-500-meter-long street, a five-story
building was uprooted and fell flat to the ground, lying on its
side-wall and with floors erect as if the pages of an open book
standing upright.
</P>
<P>
At another site, several layers of floors piled on top of one
another like shale, apparently as a result of crushed walls.
</P>
<P>
A roof perched ridiculously intact on meters thick debris,
giving the illusion that the building had been devoured by the
earth, leaving only the roof above ground.
</P>
<P>
If these did not provide full evidence for the worst shock,
sites of complete destruction were plentiful.
</P>
<P>
A team of German rescue experts told Xinhua that they have been
working on the street since early Wednesday morning. They were
hunting for signs of survivors with the aid of sniffer dogs
trained to trace the smell of living people.
</P>
<P>
They had already helped rescue seven injured people and
recover 30 bodies. However, due to hot weather and lingering
time, chances for locating more survivors were turning thin.
</P>
<P>
Foreign rescue teams from Sweden and Azerbaijan were also
working on the street.
</P>
<P>
As for those quake survivors, life had to go on. Not much more
tears and wailings were detected, except for a sobbing woman in
her sixties who said her husband was still buried under a pile of
debris beside her.
</P>
<P>
Some people were scrambling through the tangled concrete and
steel or even risked their lives entering the teetering houses,
most of which are compressed and sloping, in search for their last
properties.
</P>
<P>
Outside Izmit Street, long lines of quake victims were queuing
up for tents, food and drinking water.
</P>
<P>
A woman at her thirties said she had been standing in the line
since midnight waiting for a tent. She, like many other victims,
have had to sleep in the open field in the last two days for lack
of makeshift shelters.
</P>
<P>
"We can get enough bread, milk and drinking water, but tents
are really in urgent need," she said with misty eyes, too
exhausted to cry out.
</P>
<P>
The instant impact of the shock seemed to be petering out, but
it will undoubtedly take much longer and harder time for the
people to come to terms with the aftermath of the disaster.

<HEADLINE> E. Africa Set to Control Hyacinth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 18 (Xinhua) -- East African Cooperation
(EAC) member states Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda Thursday approved
an action plan for the control of water hyacinth and other weeds.
</P>
<P>
Among issues in the plan is convening of a donors meeting to
raise about 33.5 million U.S. dollars. So far, 4.3 million U.S.
dollars have been raised for this purpose, according to a report
from north Tanzania's Arusha, where the EAC Secretariat is based.
</P>
<P>
Lake Victoria is severely affected by water hyacinth, which
covered an estimated area of 12,000 hectares. Significant amounts
are also found in other water bodies such as Lake Kyoga in Uganda,
Lake Naivasha in Kenya and Sigi and Pangani rivers in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The widespread distribution and rapid proliferation of the
water hyacinth in the past decade has produced a negative impact
on socio- economic development and environment in the east African
countries.
</P>
<P>
An east African ministerial meeting in Arusha this week has
mandated the EAC Secretariat to work in a coordinate manner with
some donor agencies and countries already assisting in the
hyacinth control measures.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the east African countries said the regional
strategy is intended to supplement efforts of Lake Victoria
Environmental Management Project (LVEMP) that uses biological
control and physical methods.
</P>
<P>
The plan will also identify different types of nutrients and
other environmental factors that promote water hyacinth
proliferation. In addition, the project will search for sources of
nutrients as well as sites in the catchments area with high
potential for weed infestation.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also stressed that there is need to strengthen
water hyacinth monitoring and research, and to form partnerships
and build capacity to timely and effectively handle future weed
problems.
</P>
<P>
The joint plan will also gain support from Rwanda, Egypt and
Sudan, countries that are on the banks of River Nile, whose water
flow from Lake Victoria.

<HEADLINE> 6 Tanzanian Gangsters Netted for Murdering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian police have
seized six suspects for shooting a television cameraman in the
central city of Dodoma.
</P>
<P>
The murdered person, identified as Mohamed Abdala Sambo, was
killed when a group of gangsters raided a house last week in the
ninth street, Mji Mpya area in the city, Dodoma Regional Police
Commander Rashid Hemed said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here, Hemed said that the
gangsters broke into the house of a businessman named Orio Adolf
and stole 3.5 million shillings (about 4,375 U.S. dollars). But
Adolf managed to escape as he was in another room when the crime
took place.
</P>
<P>
Sambo, who was then visiting the house to see his girl friend,
tried to ambush the gangsters but was shot on the abdomen, the
police commander said, adding that the gun used has not been
recovered.
</P>
<P>
Hemed said Sambo died later although he was rushed to a
hospital and had an operation the next day.
</P>
<P>
The commander said the police are also hunting for a habitual
bandit who has been released recently from a prison.
</P>
<P>
He announced that 191 criminals have been apprehended in Dodoma
during the past 10 days.

<HEADLINE> Post-Ballot Commission to Be Formed in East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 19 (Xinhua) -- East Timorese leaders
have agreed to form a Consultative Commission following a ballot
on the territory's future, U.N. spokesman Manoel de Almeida e
Silva said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The commission, to be inaugurated on August 31, the day after
the vote, will be responsible for fostering reconciliation and
cooperation until the result of the vote is implemented, according
to a statement by the U.N. Mission in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord reached in Jakarta on August 11, the
commission will be made up of 25 members, with 10 of them to be
nominated by each side of the pro-integration and pro-independence
movements and the rest of five by the U.N. secretary-general after
discussions with Indonesia, Portugal and the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The vote set for August 30 will determine whether the majority
of 800,000 East Timorese would choose special autonomy within
Indonesia or independence. Some 450,000 voters have been
registered.
</P>
<P>
East Timor had been a Portuguese colony until 1975 when
Indonesia occupied it following a civil rift there. In 1976
Indonesia annexed it and since then the United Nations has seen it
as a non-self-governing territory.
</P>
<P>
The vote for its status was agreed by Indonesia, Portugal and
the United Nations on May 5, when the parties decided that the
U.N. organize and conduct the ballot.

LONDON, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Europe's major markets slid in
tandem with American markets Thursday after a record U.S. trade
deficit of 24bn U.S. dollars sent Wall Street down in early trade.
</P>
<P>
The UK blue chip FTSE 100 closed down 1.35 percent at 6,118,
having recouped some of its losses after falling as low as 6,104.2
shortly after the release of the U.S. trade figures.
</P>
<P>
The index came under pressure from oil, telecom and banking
stocks. Oil giants Shell and BP Amoco gave up 2.65 percent and
2.58 percent, respectively, while BT retreated 2.11 percent.
</P>
<P>
British Energy took the worst hit of the session, losing 6.31
percent to 498 pence as the market corrected erratic trades that
drove up the stock Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, the Xetra DAX index closed 43.62 points lower at
5,186.85. Trade was too thin to resist the downward pull from Wall
Street.

It is expected the Dax could slip further in coming sessions as

<HEADLINE> Ugandan President Back Home From Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni returned home Thursday from Mozambique where he, together
with his Rwandan counterpart Pasteur Bizimungu, had been invited
to attend the 19th summit of the Southern African Development
Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
During his presence at the SADC summit Wednesday afternoon, the
Ugandan president briefed his audience about the recent armed
clashes between Ugandan and Rwandan troops in Kisangani, the third
largest city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
</P>
<P>
The SADC summit and the Organization of African Unity welcomed
the cease- fire agreement reached by Museveni and Rwandan Vice
President Paul Kagame in western Uganda Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
However, it is widely believed that the clashes have further
complicated the peace process of the Congo and might prolong the
year-old conflict in the third largest African country.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Rwanda are not members of the 14-member political
and economic bloc. The presence at the summit of the two
countries' presidents indicated their willingness to resolve the
Congo issue, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Uganda sent troops into eastern Congo soon after the civil war
broke out in August 1998 in the country to allegedly ensure the
safety of its borders there. Congolese President Laurent Kabila
accused Kampala of backing the rebels there, a charge often denied
by the Ugandan government.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Minister Explains Corruption in Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's Minister of Disaster
Preparedness and Refugees Tom Butime has said that the rampant
corruption in the police force is due to the rotten nature of the
Ugandan public and poor remuneration of the force.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when appearing before the Judicial
Commission of Inquiry here Thursday, Radio Uganda reported in its
evening news bulletin.
</P>
<P>
Tom Butime, also former Minister of Internal Affairs, told the
commission, which is probing corruption in the police, that the
problem of corruption is aggravated by the insufficient funds the
force gets from the government.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that there is insider trading in the police, which
he blamed on the lack of a strong law to stop it.
</P>
<P>
During the same session, the Commandant of Kibuli Police
Training School Frederick Yiga expressed the need for more
attention from the government in terms of payment and teaching
facilities to the school.
</P>
<P>
The increasingly rampant corruption in the police force
prompted the government to form a special commission in charge of
investigation into the area. Criminal Investigations Department
Director Chris Bakiza has been interdicted for corruption charges.

<HEADLINE> German Series Killer Caught After Months of Hunt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN August 19 (Xinhua)-After months of nationwide manhunt,
German police officers arrested their most-wanted criminal, Dieter
Zurwehme, in the eastern town of Greifswald on Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
The 57-year-old prison trustee had been filed by the police as
a most dangerous series killer and was called "murderer of
Remagen". He was alleged to have murdered four "with extreme
brutality" since he had been at large last December.
</P>
<P>
Two policemen caught Zurwehme in the street of Greifswald
minutes after a motorist had recognized him from a newspaper photo
and informed the authorities, a police spokesman said. Photos of
Zurwehme and his victims had dominated German newspapers'
headlines almost entire summer.
</P>
<P>
Arrested with a gas pistol, Zurwehme did not fight back against
the policemen. The murderer was quoted as saying " I am the man
whom you are seeking" when he saw the officers.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of police staff had been deployed in the nationwide
manhunt for Zurwehme since this March, when corpses of his victims
were found in the town of Remagen beside Rhine River. However,
they could not find any trace even with the most advanced
technologies; in addition, they shot an innocent man death earlier
this summer because the 62-yeared man looked like Zurwehme.
</P>
<P>
The murder will be sentenced in the city of Koblenz, and most
possibly he will serve a life imprisonment, the police said.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Court Upholds Jail Sentence on Former </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's Appeals Court on Thursday
upheld a 10-year jail sentence on the former head of a state-run
company for misusing his position to amass personal wealth.
</P>
<P>
The court also fined the businessman, Abdel-Wahab el-Habbak,
24.67 million U.S. dollars and 5.323 million Egyptian pounds (1.67
million dollars), the country's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
El-Habbak, 63, who was Director of the Electronics Holding
Company, was arrested in 1996. He was also a former member of the
Egyptian People's Assembly (Parliament) and a member of the
Egyptian delegation that attended the signing of the 1979 peace
treaty with Israel.
</P>
<P>
El-Habbak was tried two years ago after he was said to have
used the influence of his position to amass personal wealth.
Police have estimated that el-Habbak has some 50 million dollars
abroad.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, el-Habbak was sentenced to 10 years in prison and
fined 26.7 million dollars, but he appealed the case.
</P>
<P>
The appeals court on Thursday also fined el-Habbak's wife Leila
Attia, sons Ihab and Ashraf and daughter Siham 4.672 million
dollars and 5.585 million pounds (1.64 million dollars), the news
agency said.
</P>
<P>
The government has frozen el-Habbak's bank accounts and placed
his villas and three cars in escrow. He and his family also were
barred from traveling abroad.
</P>
<P>
Following the first trial, prosecutors said they would ask
unnamed European countries to return at least 30 million dollars
of el-Habbak's money in accordance with an international agreement
on combating money laundering.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Workers Strike for Higher Pay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of workers on the Owen
Falls extension project 80 kms east of the capital city here are
striking for better working conditions and transport allowance.
</P>
<P>
The workers threatened to blow up the new dam with explosives
and destroy the project vehicles and equipment, Radio Uganda
quoted police sources as saying Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The strike, which had a violent start, sucked in both casual
and permanent workers of contractors Impregilo Sterling, prompting
over 100 policemen and military police to ward off the angry
workers from destroying the new dam.
</P>
<P>
The strikers told reporters that the management of the
contractors is very arrogant and shows no care for their welfare,
adding that they would not resume work unless they are promised to
have higher pay and better treatment.
</P>
<P>
Muyanja Mbabali, Impregilo Sterling representative, however,
said that the strike was caused by 20 workers who had been
retrenched.
</P>
<P>
The new project would provide 200 megawatts of power to Uganda.
Lack of power has led to frequent load shedding in peak hours and
slowed down the industrialization of the African country.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Alcoa, Reynolds Metals Agree to Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Alcoa, the world's largest
aluminum maker, won its hostile bid for Reynolds Metals Inc.,
reaching an agreement to acquire the company for 4.4 billion U.S.
dollars in stock, the companies announced on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh-based Alcoa beat out Chicago-based investment group
Michigan Avenue Partners in the bidding for Richmond,
Virginia-based Reynolds, also an aluminum producer, according to
the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
The Reynolds board on Sunday had rejected a 65-dollar-a-share
cash-and-stock bid from Alcoa. Alcoa then began taking a
65-dollar-a-share all-cash offer to shareholders while pursuing
the talks that led to the merger agreement. That offer was valued
at 4.2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The merger values Reynolds at almost 71 dollars a share, based
on Wednesday's closing price of Alcoa. That represents a premium
of 3.9 percent on Reynolds' closing price Wednesday and is 9
percent more than last week's offer by Alcoa.
</P>
<P>
The merger would create a company with annual sales of 20.5
billion dollars, more than 120,000 employees and operations in
more than 300 locations in 36 countries. It would be called Alcoa
but would retain the venerable Reynolds brand name for products
such as Reynolds Wrap.
</P>
<P>
The merger of the two industry giants could face a tough
antitrust review, but Alcoa and Reynolds said they hope the
takeover will be completed by year's end. Reynolds' shareholders
also must approve the deal.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the combined company would control more than
one-sixth of the world's aluminum production.
</P>
<P>
Alcoa, with about 103,000 employees, had 15.3 billion dollars
in revenue last year. With operations in 31 countries, it is the
world's largest producer of alumina, the principal ingredient in
aluminum. Alcoa products are used in automobiles, airplanes,
construction, beverage cans and a variety of packaging goods.
</P>
<P>
Reynolds, with about 18,000 employees, had 5.9 billion dollars
in revenue last year and operations in 24 countries. It is best
known for Reynolds Wrap aluminum foil but it also sells consumer
products such as plastic wrap and wax paper. It also sells
aluminum for construction, car parts and other packaging products.

<HEADLINE> 3 Hezbollah Guerrillas Killed in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's leading anti-Israeli
guerrilla group Hezbollah Thursday said that its three members
were killed in a clash with Israeli troops in south Lebanon
two days ago.
</P>
<P>
The three members were killed when they exchanged fire with an
Israeli patrol in Wadi Sluqi in the central sector of the Israeli
occupied border zone in south Lebanon on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Two Israeli soldiers were also killed and nine others wounded
in the fiercest fighting in south Lebanon since February this
year.
</P>
<P>
The violence raised to 19 the number of Lebanese guerrillas,
mostly from Hezbollah, killed in south Lebanon since the start of
this year and 13 on the Israeli side.
</P>
<P>
The clash came a day after Hezbollah's senior military officer
Ali Deeb was killed by two roadside bombs near Sidon, Lebanon's
southern port city.
</P>
<P>
The group accused Israel of being behind the assassination,
and vowed to take revenge.
</P>
<P>
But, Israel denied the charge, saying a rival group to
Hezbollah was behind the attack.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south
Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north
from Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon' resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been fighting to oust Israeli occupation forces
and its proxy SLA out of the country.

<HEADLINE> U.N. "One China" Policy Reaffirmed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Louise Frechette, Deputy
Secretary-General of the United Nations reaffirmed on Thursday
that the U.N. will continue to uphold "One China" policy.
</P>
<P>
She made the statement when meeting ambassador Qin Huasun,
Chinese Permanent Representative to the U.N..
</P>
<P>
Frechette said she will circulate as soon as possible as a
General Assembly document Qin's letter to U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on China's principled stand on the Taiwan issue. Annan
is currently on vacation.
</P>
<P>
The letter expressed China's strong condemnation against the
proposal by Nicaragua and a small number of other countries's to
put the so-called "Taiwan's participation in the U.N." before the
General Assembly, describing it as an attempt to create "Two
Chinas" in the world body.
</P>
<P>
Such an act has seriously contravened the purposes and
principles of the U.N. Charter, severely encroached upon China's
sovereignty and territorial integrity and grossly interfered in
China's internal affairs, the letter said.
</P>
<P>
It said there is only one China in the world and Taiwan has
been an inseparable part of China since ancient times.
</P>
<P>
The founding of the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 1949
ended the history of the government of the Republic of China and
the Government of the PRC has been the sole legal government
representing the whole of China ever since, the letter said.
</P>
<P>
More than 160 countries have diplomatic relations with China,
all acknowledging that the Government of the PRC is the sole legal
government representing the whole of China and that Taiwan is part
of China.
</P>
<P>
The letter said there is no such issue as Taiwan's so-called
"representation at the U.N." because the Resolution 2758 adopted
by the 26th session of the U.N. General Assembly in 1971 solved
the issue of China's representation at the U.N. in a just, through
and comprehensive manner.
</P>
<P>
The letter saw the issue of Taiwan fundamentally different from
those of Germany and Korea as it is a leftover of China's civil
war, while the German and Korean issues were results of a series
of international agreements reached during and after World War II.
</P>
<P>
"There is nobody in the world who cares more about the future
and interests of the 22 million Taiwan compatriots than the
Chinese Government and People," the letter said, declaring that
the issue is purely an internal matter of China and an issue for
the Chinese themselves to resolve.
</P>
<P>
To solve the question of Taiwan and realize reunification of
the motherland, the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping came up with
the creative concept of "peaceful reunification and one country,
two systems" which remains a fundamental state policy, th letter
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
It said the concept and and President Jiang Zemin's eight-point
proposal for developing cross-Straits relations and promoting
peaceful reunification of the motherland have taken into account
the paramount interests of national development and the long-term
interest of the entire Chinese population.
</P>
<P>
The letter hoped that the above-mentioned small number of
countries will join the vast majority of U.N. member states in
their unanimous position on the issue of Taiwan.

BUCHAREST, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Romania acknowledges the
Russian Federation's territorial integrity and condemns the
proclamation by armed rebel groups of the so-called independent
Islamic State of Daghestan, a press release of Romania's Foreign
Ministry stressed here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Romania anxiously follows the violence escalation in Daghestan,

legitimate authorities will restore order, soonest possible.
</P>
<P>
The militants commanded by Chechen warlord Shamil Basayev

<HEADLINE> Security Council Hails Progress in Tajik Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Thursday voiced its welcome to "significant progress" in the peace
process in Tajikistan, saying that the 15-nation body will
"intensify its efforts aimed at the institution of a broad
dialogue among the various political forces in the country."
</P>
<P>
A presidential statement, adopted at the Council's meeting on
the situation in Tajikistan, said, "The Security Council welcomes
significant progress in the implementation of the General
Agreement on the Establishment of Peace and National Accord in
Tajikistan."
</P>
<P>
The progress was "achieved to a great extent due to the renewed
efforts of the President of the Republic of Tajikistan and the
leadership of the Commission on National Reconciliation (CNR),"
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Council "particularly welcomes the official declaration by
the United Tajik Opposition (UTO) of the disbandment of its armed
units and the decision by the Supreme Court of Tajikistan lifting
the bans and restrictions on activities by the political parties
and movements of the UTO as important steps contributing to the
democratic development of Tajik society," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Council reiterates its commitment to the CNR to intensify
its efforts aimed at the institution of a broad dialogue among the
various political forces in the country in the interests of the
restoration and strengthening of civil accord in Tajikistan," said
the presidential statement.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council encourages the parties to undertake
further concerted measures to ensure the full and sequential
implementation, in a balanced manner, of the General Agreement,"
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
In his written report to the Security Council, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan Monday said that "significant
progress" has been made in implementing a 1997 peace agreement in
Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
The Tajik Government and the UTO have agreed on proposed
constitutional amendments, on parliament's decision to hold a
referendum on those amendments, and on the opposition's August 3
announcement that it had disbanded its armed forces, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 peace accord, also known as the General Agreement,
ended a five-year civil war between the former Soviet republic's
secular government and fighters of the UTO -- an alliance of
mostly Islamic groups operating from bases in neighboring
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Though Tajikistan has ended its civil war, armed bands still
carried out periodic attacks. Tajikistan's neighbors, including
Uzbekistan, have often expressed concern about unrest spilling
into their territory, reports said.

LUANDA, August 19 (xinhua) -- The just-ended summit of the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) has achieved
"positive" results, Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos said
here Thursday.
</P>

One of these is that the summit suggests to establish a more
efficient form of coordination among the leadership of SADC
members and the organization's subsidiary organs responsible for
security and defense of the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Organization of Defense and Security of SADC
member countries could pay more attention to the situation in the
countries facing internal conflicts, such as Angola and the
Democratic Republic of the Congo.
</P>
<P>
The assistance of the organ could contribute to the

<HEADLINE> Iran Urges U.S. Not to Interfere in Internal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Foreign Ministry on
Thursday rejected U.S. comments on its arrest of Iranian Jews,
and called on Washington not to interfere in Iran's internal
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi called the U.S. comments
"based on prejudgments" and "least information."
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin on Wednesday urged
Iranian authorities to release 13 Iranian Jews arrested on
espionage charges amid reports that their trial was imminent.
</P>
<P>
"The statements which are based on prejudgments and the least
information do not correspond with the international norms and
rules," Asefi said.
</P>
<P>
It is as if Iran asks the U.S. to release, before trial, all
those who are arrested in the U.S. on charges of espionage
charges, he added.
</P>
<P>
Iran confirmed on June 9 that 13 Iranian Jews had been
arrested for spying for Israel, which Israel later denied.
</P>
<P>
There is a small Jewish community in this Muslim-dominated
country. Asefi said those who are accused of espionage,
regardless of their faith, will enjoy full justice like any other
defendant in Iran and in this case there would be no
religion-based discrimination.
</P>
<P>
He assured that the judiciary will perform its legal duties in
this respect with full independence.

<HEADLINE> mee081918hke - Barak Wants U.S. to Move Embassy to Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak stressed on Thursday that he would like the United States
to move its embassy to Jerusalem immediately after the current
freeze by a presidential decree expires.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with members of a pro-Israel lobbyist
group in Jerusalem, Barak said that he believes the American
congress should formulate a unified position on the peace
process and Israel's reinforcement.
</P>
<P>
Barak made the remarks after one of his ministers denied
a report on Wednesday that Barak had asked the U.S.
congressmen to stop pressuring President Bill Clinton to move
the U.S. embassy before the completion of Israeli-Palestinian
permanent talks.
</P>
<P>
The report also said Barak had noted that moving the embassy at
the current stage would incite Palestinian violence.
</P>
<P>
Interim leader of the right-wing Likud party Ariel Sharon has
charged that the report showed Barak is willing to partition
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Israel seized the Arab East Jerusalem from Jordanian control
in the 1967 Middle East war and later annexed it, claiming
the whole city as its "undivided and eternal capital."
</P>
<P>
The international community, however, does not recognize
Israel's claim over Jerusalem. Most countries locate their
embassies in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
In October 1995, the U.S. Congress approved a bill
requiring the U.S. embassy to be moved to Jerusalem by May
31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration has since resisted the pressure by
using waivers the bill granted the president to postpone the
move on grounds of national security.
</P>
<P>
The fate of Jerusalem, together with other sensitive issues
like a possible Palestinian state, is supposed to be discussed in
the final-status talks according to signed Israeli-Palestinian
peace accords.
</P>
<P>
Barak has expressed hope that Israel and the Palestinians
would work out a framework of the final-status talks by
February 2000. The talks, however, have yet to begin.
</P>
<P>
Although considered moderate on the Israeli-Arab peace process,
Barak sticks to hard lines on the issue of Jerusalem as
previous Israeli governments did, insisting that Jerusalem
should remain the "capital of Israel" under a permanent peace
treaty with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of an
independent Palestinian state.

"Having recruited our young people, they train them in

<P>
KHARTOUM, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The western media has been
staging hostile campaigns against Sudan in an "attempt to prepare
the ground for a potential aggression against Sudan," said
Sudanese Minister of Culture and Information Ghazi Salah el-Din.
</P>
<P>
The warning was made Thursday on the eve of the first
anniversary of the U.S. missile attack on the Shefaa
pharmaceutical plant in Khartoum that falls on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The minister described the aggression as a violation of Sudan's
sovereignty as well as international laws and norms.
</P>
<P>
The United States claimed that the plant is owned by the
alleged Saudi terrorist Osama bin Laden and that the factory
produces chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
El-Din renewed Sudan's complaint to the U.N. Security Council
and urged the council to dispatch a fact-finding committee to
probe the U.S. allegations on the factory.
</P>
<P>
He called on the international community to back Sudan in

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Signs Protocol to Protect Cultural Heritage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus Thursday signed the
Second Protocol to the 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection
of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' Ambassador to Holland Alexandros Zenon signed the
document.
</P>
<P>
An article on the protection of cultural heritage in northern
Cyprus was included in the Protocol thanks to efforts by the
Cyprus side, said an announcement.
</P>
<P>
Under Article 9 of the Protocol, a country which occupies part
of or the whole of another country is obliged to prohibit or
prevent every illegal export or transfer of cultural heritage.
</P>
<P>
It should also prohibit and prevent archaeological excavations
unless they are necessary to protect the cultural heritage and
must avert any change in the use of the cultural heritage.
</P>
<P>
The Second Protocol, adopted in Hague on March 26 this year,
also includes articles that attribute legal obligations in cases
where the Convention is violated.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that more than 500 churches in northern
Cyprus, some of them hundreds of years old, have been destroyed,
desecrated or turned into ware-houses, coffee-shops or even
stables.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus authorities have also expressed deep concern over
the fate of archaeological sites in northern Cyprus which are not
being looked after or are left unprotected.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Withdrawal Should be After Syria: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Information Minister
Anwar Khalil said on Thursday that Israel should withdraw its
troops from Syrian Golan Heights first and then from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Khalil made the remark during an interview with the country's
Nida al Watani newspaper which was also carried by the state-run
National News Agency.
</P>
<P>
"If Ehud Barak (Israeli Prime Minister) understands this
logic, there will be no problem. Otherwise, many obstacles will
appear to block the road," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that there is only one fate and one negotiating
choice for both Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He warned Israel against attempting to separate Lebanese track
from the Syrian one in the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and its strong neighbor Syria have kept a special
relationship since Syria sent 30,000 troops to Lebanon in 1976
to help end the country's 15-year-old civil war.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have been insisting that their negotiations
with Israel be conducted simultaneously while the Jewish state
has been trying to conclude a peace deal with Lebanon first.
</P>
<P>
Israel has occupied part of Lebanon since 1978 and set up a
self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in 1985 with the
claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese guerrillas'
cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
It also captured Syrian Golan Heights during the 1967 Middle
East war.
</P>
<P>
Khalil urged Israel to apply all international laws concerning
Syria, Lebanon and Palestine, including the United Nations
Resolution 425 which calls for an unconditional Israeli withdrawal
from south Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Russia Proposes Sharper Cut Under START III </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Russia has proposed in its arms
control talks with the United States that the two sides cut their
nuclear warheads to 1,500 or less each, a slash sharper than
Washington suggested under START III, the Interfax news agency
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
During the Russian-U.S. expert consultations in Moscow on
August 17-19, the U.S. side insisted on 2,000-2,500 warheads as
the aim of the third stage of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty,
or START III, Interfax reported, quoting diplomatic sources.
</P>
<P>
The Russian side believes that the more radical cuts "are
sufficient for the continuation of mutual stable deterrence."
</P>
<P>
Russia and the United States have already signed two START
treaties under which the two sides' nuclear warheads would each be
cut to 3,000 to 3,500. While U.S. Congress approved the START II
in 1996, the Russian State Duma, or lower house of parliament, has
yet to ratify the accord.
</P>
<P>
Russia would also raise the question of sea launched cruise
missiles in future START talks. "Russia favors a ban on such
missiles as they are extremely de-stabilizing both in the nuclear
and non-nuclear senses," the Russian sources said, describing it
as an idea that Washington has not agreed yet.

<HEADLINE> British Government Trying to Solve Dover Refugee Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 19 (Xinhua) -- British government promised on
Thursday to reduce the number of asylum-seekers in the region
around the Channel port town of Dover by the middle of next week
after a week of growing tension in the coastal resorts.
</P>
<P>
Home Office minister Lord Bassam said the pressure on areas
like Dover would be relieved by dispersing asylum-seekers to other
parts of the country, a BBC report said.
</P>
<P>
The minister made that comment after holding talks with members
of local council.
</P>
<P>
Around 5,000 refugees are estimated to be living in Dover, a
town of 41,000 people, where fighting broke out over the weekend
between local people and asylum seekers.
</P>
<P>
But the government has also indicated that the problem posed by
the refugees, who local authorities say are mainly Kurds, Afghans
and Kosovo Albanians, is unlikely to be solved before next April
when a new and controversial immigration bill aimed at speeding up
the asylum process is due to become law.

<HEADLINE> Annan Calls for End to Attacks on Civilians in Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 19 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Thursday voiced his strong condemnation of the recent
killings of innocent civilians in Burundi, calling upon the
Government and rebel forces to "put an end to all attacks" on
civilians in the African country.
</P>
<P>
A statement, issued here by his spokesman, said, "The
Secretary-General was particularly shocked by attacks that
occurred in Kanyosha and Ruziba, located in the province of
Bujumbura rural, respectively on 10 and 12 August 1999, and which
resulted in the killing of innocent civilians by both rebel forces
and Government forces."
</P>
<P>
"He strongly condemns such acts," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General calls upon the Government and the rebel
forces to put an end to all attacks on the civilian population and
urges all parties involved to abide by international humanitarian
law and human principles," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General reiterates his support for the peace
process in its internal and external dimensions and calls all
parties to cooperate with the Facilitator to ensure progress
towards the conclusion of the peace agreement," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that villagers on the southern outskirts of the
capital, Bujumbura, accused the Tutsi-dominated army of killing
147 Hutu civilians in revenge for a Hutu rebel attack, but the
army blamed rebels for the killings.
</P>
<P>
More than 150,000 people have been killed in Burundi's civil
war, which started in October 1993.

<P>
LONDON, August 19 (Xinhua) -- British Airways is hitting by a
baby boom among its stewardesses as 600 of them are expected to
give birth around the turn of the millennium, the Reuters reported
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Many of the stewardesses have been transferred to check-in
desks at London's Heathrow airport.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted an airline spokeswoman as saying on Thursday
that the jobs of the pregnant women would be filled temporarily by
recalling crews on secondment or by hiring people on part-time
contracts.
</P>
<P>
"Our head office and airport terminals are beginning to look
like maternity clinics with so many pregnant stewardesses now
working behind the desks," the spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
"We pride ourselves on looking after our flying mums -- even
when we are faced with an epidemic," she added.
</P>
<P>
The medical profession in Britain is bracing for a significant
increase in births early in 2000 as parents attempt to produce
"millennium babies."

<HEADLINE> Security Council Hails Plan for Liaison Office in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Thursday extended a welcome to an initiative by Secretary-General
Kofi Annan to set up a new office for promoting peace process in
the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
In a statement read to the press, the president of the
15-nation Security Council, Martin Andjaba of Namibia, said,
"Security Council members welcomed the intention of the
Secretary-General to initiate practical agreements for the
earliest establishment of the new office" in Angola.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council also welcomes "the conclusion with the
Government of Angola of a status-of-mission agreement," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
Six months after withdrawing its peacekeepers from Angola,
Annan said last Friday in a letter to the Security Council that
the United Nations plans to open a liaison office in the country
to explore ways to restore peace.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan Government has agreed to allow the new U.N. office,
which will establish links with security and civilian authorities.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council voted to shut down the U.N. peacekeeping
operations in Angola in February after full-scale war resumed in
December between the government forces and the rebel National
Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
Annan said the new office, which will be staffed by 30
professionals and support personnel, was being established "with a
view to exploring effective measures for restoring peace."
</P>
<P>
U.N. humanitarian operations have continued to operate in the
southwest African nation since the peacekeepers' departure. The
United Nations spent 10 years and millions of U.S. dollars trying
to bring peace to Angola, where civil war broke out soon after its
independence from Portugal.

<HEADLINE> Arab FM Meeting Rescheduled for September 12-13 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 19 (Xinhua) -- A meeting of Arab foreign
ministers to be chaired by Iraq has been rescheduled for September
12-13, the Arab League secretary general said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Esmat Abdel-Meguid told reporters that the 112th session of the
Arab Foreign Ministers Council has been postponed because the
original date of September 4-5 clashed with an extraordinary
summit of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in Tripoli,
Libya. Nine Arab League states are also OAU members.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Saudi Foreign Minister Saud al-Faisal had said he
could only attend the meeting on September 12-13. Al-Faisal
requested the postponement on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait, which Iraq invaded in 1990 and occupied for seven
months, said on Thursday it will attend the meeting to be held in
Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait does not oppose the meeting whether Iraq will take part
in or not, said Saqr al-Buaijan, an official at the Kuwaiti
Embassy in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait is ready to support any efforts in seeking restoration
of Arab solidarity and formation of a united Arab stand,
al-Buaijan said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said Kuwait has not decided who will head its
delegation, suggesting Foreign Minister Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber
Al-Sabah might not attend.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time since the invasion that Iraq chairs a
meeting of Arab foreign ministers, who meet twice a year at the
Cairo-based Arab League headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Each of the Arab League's 22 members holds the chairmanship on
a rotation basis. Iraq's turn was expected to strike apprehension
among Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. They have previously blocked Arab
League proposals to support Iraq in its campaign for the lifting
of the sweeping trade sanctions imposed by the U.N. Security
Council after the invasion.

TEHRAN, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Two people have been killed and
three others injured in Iran's northwestern province of East
Azarbaijan in floods caused by torrential downpour Wednesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
According to the official Islamic Republic News Agency
Thursday, the two killed were a girl and a baby in Varzaqan and
Charloo districts of the city of Sarab, about 100 kilometers east

</P>
<P>
Reports from the floods-stricken area indicated that 50
residential unites were engulfed by the floods.
</P>
<P>
Managing director of provincial Red Crescent society,
Mashaallah Pourtoloie, said that there is no immediate report on
the damage caused by the floods and rescue teams continue their
efforts.
</P>
<P>
Initial reports said the floods also damaged the water network

<HEADLINE> U.N. Acts to Protect Minorities in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The leaders of the United
Nations operation and the international peacekeeping force, known
as KFOR, have condemned the continuing acts of intimidation and
murder of minorities in Kosovo and said they were taking extensive
measures to protect those communities, U.N. officials said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement issued in the capital of Kosovo province,
Pristina, the U.N. special representative for Kosovo, Bernard
Kouchner, and KFOR commander Lt. General Mike Jackson said that
the primary aim of the international presence was to provide a
secure environment for all Kosovars, regardless of ethnic origin.
</P>
<P>
"We are continually reviewing the security situation and
improving our response," they said in the joint statement.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Interim Administrative Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK)
continued to deploy international civilian police as part of its
effort to restore civil order and normalcy.
</P>
<P>
Some 700 U.N. civilian officers are already in Kosovo, with
nearly 200 conducting patrols in the capital.
</P>
<P>
The NATO-led KFOR have been blamed for its failure in keeping
law and order since its entry into the Yugoslav province in June
after a U.N. resolution, adopted on June 10, authorized the troops
to move into Kosovo for peacekeeping mission.
</P>
<P>
Many non-Albanian residents in Kosovo have been looted, and
even murdered after the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) staged
a comeback in the Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
At present, the international community is very much concerned
that a lot of non-Albanian residents were persecuted and the slow
pace in disarming KLA soldiers, as stipulated by the U.N.
resolution.

<HEADLINE> Police Make Arrests Following N.Irish Parade Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Northern Irish police on Thursday
arrested several people for questioning about clashes during a
street protest by Catholics in the province's capital Belfast last
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Gerard Rice, a leader of a Catholic residents group and two
other members of the group -- the Lower Ormeau Concerned Community
-- were among those detained, the BBC radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The arrests followed disturbances on the Lower Ormeau Road last
Saturday when nationalists attempted to block the route of a
parade by a Protestant marching organization, the Apprentice Boys.
</P>
<P>
A number of Catholic demonstrators and police were injured when
officers in riot gear moved in to end the sit-down protest.
</P>
<P>
Rice, who was publicly critical of the police tactics, was
arrested during Thursday morning and taken to a police station in
Belfast.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) said its
officers had arrested a number of people in operations in the
south, west and north Belfast.
</P>
<P>
"The operation is part of ongoing investigations into the
violence which preceded Saturday's Apprentice Boys parade on the
Ormeau Road," an RUC spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The Parades Commission had given permission for the parade by
the Apprentice Boys -- a fervently pro-British organisation that
holds annual marches to commemorate 300-year-old victories over
pro-Irish Catholics.
</P>
<P>
A peace process is under way in the province after ceasefires
by outlawed Catholic republican and Protestant loyalist guerrillas
who have warred for 30 years about Britain's right to rule.
</P>
<P>
But an accord -- the "Good Friday" agreement -- has run into
difficulties, with proposals stalled for new political
institutions and sectarian tension spilling over into sporadic
violence.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Teenagers' Use of Drugs Dropped in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Illicit use by American
teenagers dropped sharply last year, with less than one in 10
youths are using cocaine, marijuana or other illegal drugs,
according to a U.S. federal survey published Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse showed that 9.9
percent of youths between 12 to 17 reported that they used illegal
drugs in 1998, compared with 11.4 percent in the same age category
the year before.
</P>
<P>
"In the battle against illicit drugs, we've turned the corner,"
said Health and Human Services Secretary Donna E. Shalala.
</P>
<P>
Though teenagers' use of drugs was on decline, the report,
which surveyed 25,500 Americans 12 and older, found no substantial
change in overall drug use across age groups.
</P>
<P>
The survey estimated that 13.6 million Americans, or 6.2
percent of the population 12 or older, were drug users last year.
This did not represent a significant decline from the estimated
13.8 million drug users in 1997.
</P>
<P>
According to the annual survey, drug use among teenagers
between 12 to 17 hit a peak of 16.3 percent in 1979, and declined
during the 1980s to reach a low point of 5.3 percent in 1992.
Since then, the estimated current drug use by teenagers has risen
every year except in 1996 and 1998.

NEW DELHI, August 19 (Xinhua) -- United States President Bill
Clinton has written to Indian caretaker Prime Minister Atal Behari
Vajpayee focusing on the need to strengthen Indo-U.S. relations

</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the External Affairs Ministry told the press

between the two leaders.
</P>
<P>
He said that a reply would be sent shortly by the Indian

bilateral relations would be raised to a "qualitatively new
level."
</P>
<P>
New Delhi, the spokesman said, looked forward to establishing
"closer understanding" with Washington on nuclear and other
issues.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that in the course of this correspondence as well as
during the broader dialogue that India had with the U.S., both
sides had clarified their medium-term policies and their approach
to issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
These included bilateral relations, Clinton's proposed visit to
the South Asian country and the removal of the hurdles in the way
of a more dynamic economic relationship, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"Our discussions have also addressed questions related to the
global nuclear architecture," he added.
</P>
<P>
Following India's publication of a so-called nuclear doctrine
on Tuesday, Washington criticized India's steps to develop a
nuclear deterrence, calling it a step in the wrong direction.

ATHENS, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Heatwave began to hit Greece once
again Thursday with temperatures soaring to 39 degrees Celsius in
most parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
The temperatures would reach 40 degrees Celsius over the next
few days, according to the National Weather Service (NWS).
</P>
<P>
The rise in temperatures is reportedly due to warm fronts
moving northwards from North Africa, and is expected to last until
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
This is the hottest August in Greece in 20 years and the third
heatwave sweeping Greece this year. The first heatwave and the
second one took place in July and in mid August respectively with
the temperatures rising to more than 42 degrees Celsius.
</P>
<P>
In 1987, more than 900 people died in a heatwave when
temperatures jumped above 42 degrees Celsius for more than a week.
</P>
<P>
Municipal services, the Health Ministry and ambulance service

<HEADLINE> Russia to Upgrade Strategic Forces if U.S. Forms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Russia said Thursday it would
upgrade its strategic nuclear forces and take other military and
political steps if the United States goes ahead with its planned
deployment of a national anti-missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
If the U.S. deploys a national anti-missile defense system,
Russia "will be forced to raise the effectiveness of its strategic
nuclear armed forces and carry out several other military and
political steps to guarantee its national security under new
strategic conditions," said Grigory Berdennikov, head of the
Russian Foreign Ministry's Security and Disarmament Department.
</P>
<P>
The statement came after arms control talks here between Russia
and the United States that ended without any major breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
Berdennikov warned that a violation of the 1972 ABM Treaty
might prompt other countries to take asymmetrical steps to resist
an American missile defense system, the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The official, who who headed the Russian delegation in the
recent consultations on ABM and START-3 in Moscow, said he feared
"the arms race may spread into space" because of the U.S. move.
</P>
<P>
Berdennikov said that during the past few years the U.S. has
been taking practical steps not just to unfold a limited missile
defense system, but to develop "a multi-purpose global system of
resisting all types of ballistic, aerodynamic and space targets."
</P>
<P>
He quoted Russian experts as saying that Washington "is
planning to deploy a national anti-missile system relying on space
reconnaissance, in particular targeting weapons."
</P>
<P>
Berdennikov reiterated Moscow's opposition to a revision of the
ABM treaty.
</P>
<P>
Russia sees "no reasons, or practical needs, or possibilities
for changing any key aspects and restrictions of the ABM Treaty."
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. plans to create a national anti-missile system
"might lead to a paralysis and relegation of all disarmament
processes, including the key regimes of non- proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction."
</P>
<P>
"A U.S. anti-missile system, which would simultaneously leave
Russia's deterrence potential intact and be consistent with the
ABM Treaty restrictions, is hard to imagine," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Objective consequences of the deployment of any U.S. national
anti-missile system would entail upsetting the current strategic
balance, a certain degree of depreciation of Russia's strategic
potential and a U.S. unilateral military advantage," he said.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed U.S. claims that it needs the new system to ward
off any new threats from other countries.
</P>
<P>
"U.S. apprehensions concerning changes in the strategic
situation stand no ground when compared to the changes, which a
derailed ABM Treaty might trigger," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the ABM treaty's "viability and effectiveness" as
it has averted a strategic potential mis-balance for many years."
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, we are prepared to consider any suggestions, which
would increase its viability. We intend to discuss the ABM Treaty
in this context," he said.

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Loyalist Militias "Not Ready to Disarm" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 19 (Xinhua) -- One of Northern Ireland's largest
Pro-British loyalist guerrilla groups said Thursday they were not
ready to begin to hand in arms.
</P>
<P>
The Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) told the BBC that it had
carried out a three-week review of its policy toward
decommissioning.
</P>
<P>
It said in a statement that it saw disarmament as an honorable
objective but that the right conditions did not yet exist.
</P>
<P>
But, challenging their republican Irish Republican Army (IRA)
extremist foes to create conditions for all-round disarmament, the
Protestant militias said scrapping weaponry was "an honorable
objective."
</P>
<P>
The statement was issued ahead of a major review of the
struggling Good Friday peace accord due next month.
</P>
<P>
Britain is trying to decide whether the IRA's two-year-old
ceasefire remains in force following recent violent incidents.
</P>
<P>
The UVF criticized the IRA for failing to do what they have --
establish links with an independent commission that aims to bring
about the decommissioning, or handing in of arms.
</P>
<P>
The peace process was thrown into turmoil in July when the
Ulster Unionist Party said it would not set up a coalition
government involving the IRA's Sinn Fein political arm until the
IRA handed in weapons from its 30-year war against British rule.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Prepares for Battle at WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 19 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is preparing
to do battle to win a better deal for developing countries at the
next round of World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations, South
African Trade and Industry Minister Alec Erwin said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations are scheduled for December in Seattle, United
States.
</P>
<P>
"South Africa has some very firm views on what should be done
in this next negotiating round," Erwin was quoted by South African
Press Association as telling the National Assembly's trade and
industry committee in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
The proposals, to be discussed at a conference with business
and labor next week, will be submitted to a meeting of WTO
countries' ambassadors in Geneva next month. The ambassadors will
try and agree on a document to be referred to the Seattle meeting.
</P>
<P>
Erwin said it had yet to be agreed exactly what the negotiating
round would cover.
</P>
<P>
"What is agreed is that agriculture negotiations must start --
that was already agreed in Singapore in 1996. There is also
agreement that the final negotiations around trade in services
should be completed.
</P>
<P>
"There is a question mark over what should be negotiated with
(regard to) trade-related intellectual property rights and
trade-related investment measures."
</P>
<P>
Erwin said the European Union (EU) wanted to deal
comprehensively with industrial goods, while the U.S. wanted to
negotiate certain sectoral agreements, such as electronic
commerce.
</P>
<P>
South Africa had agreed it was necessary to start certain
negotiations around industrial products.
</P>
<P>
"Particularly, we argue that we must attack what we are calling
the grandfather industries in the north... the steel industry in
the north, the agricultural industries in the north, all
industries which are not competitive any more.
</P>
<P>
"We say that the structural adjustment must begin in the north,
not the south."
</P>
<P>
Erwin said South Africa also favored negotiations on
agricultural goods, "to try and knock down the protectionist and
subsidy position of the European Union and to some extent the
U.S., and certainly the position of Japan and Korea".
</P>
<P>
"We also believe it is necessary to review the subsidies
agreement -- which deals with what role the state can and cannot
play -- and we are saying that the United States and Europe are
now abusing that subsidies agreement."
</P>
<P>
On South Africa's bilateral trade negotiations, Erwin said
formal dialog with the Mercosur grouping had begun and the
prospect of negotiating an agreement was being considered.
</P>
<P>
Mercosur, the free trade area between Brazil, Argentina,
Paraguay and Uruguay, which has Chile as an associate, is one of
South Africa's major trading partners.
</P>
<P>
Trade negotiations were also under way with the United States,
but this was not related to tariffs or free trade.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to start with recognition of standards and other
trade facilitation aspects, also to deal with dumping (and)
countervailing actions.
</P>
<P>
"We are looking to facilitate trade rather than enter into a
process of the lowering of tariffs."
</P>
<P>
Erwin said he was confident the free trade agreement South
Africa had concluded with the EU would be implemented next year.
</P>
<P>
"About a week-and-a-half ago, the EU council formally agreed to
the agreement that we negotiated. This means that the agreement
can be implemented on January 1, 2000."
</P>
<P>
The other major agreement under negotiation was a free trade
agreement within the 14-nation Southern African Development
Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
In some respects this agreement was even more complicated than
that negotiated with the EU, because there were many trade
agreements in southern Africa which overlapped.
</P>
<P>
"We are fairly confident we can complete this negotiation. The
trade ministers met in Maputo on Monday and we will meet again on
September 3.
</P>
<P>
"If the negotiating team has not made enough progress, we will
then have a fully-fledged negotiating round led by the ministers
in November."
</P>
<P>
Erwin said that, generally speaking, South Africa felt the
tariff reduction offers from other SADC countries had been too
cautious.
</P>
<P>
He said South Africa was beginning a new round of tariff
reforms.
</P>
<P>
A tariff reform program which began in 1995 had been completed.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to begin taking decisions on this at the
beginning of 2000," he said.

<HEADLINE> One out Two Nigerian in Poverty: UNDP Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Two reports by the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) published Thursday in Nigeria's capital
Abuja draws worrisome pictures of increasing poverty in the
oil-rich west Africa country where one out of two people is below
poverty line.
</P>
<P>
The poverty statistics in the reports are alarming, commented
Nigeria's President Olusegun Obasanjo at the launching party of
the two reports -- the Nigeria Human Development Report 1998 and
Human Development Report 1999.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, Nigeria is now among the 25 poorest
nations in the world, but 12 years ago it was among the 48
richest.
</P>
<P>
The drafting of the two reports, mainly by the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP), was reportedly collaborated by Prof.
Adebayo Adedeji, a renown Nigerian economist and former Executive
Secretary of the Addis Ababa-based Economic Commission for Africa.
</P>
<P>
The reports, launched in the presence of senior government
officials, foreign diplomats and UNDP associate administrator
Zephirin Diabre, 41.6 percent of Nigeria's more than 100 million
population remains in extreme poverty.
</P>
<P>
The alarming poverty rate is largely due to lack of education
and basic
</P>
<P>
 public services including potable water.
There are only 49 percent of the population have access to safe
water and health services, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The 101-page 1998 report said average life expectancy in the
country is 52 years old, eight years lower than the minimum target
of the World Health Organization.
</P>
<P>
The reports suggest that Nigeria should convey a clear message
to the international community, through its concrete actions and
policy, a message that a new Nigeria is dedicated to the
actualization of holistic sustainable human development embracing
justice, equity, public accountability, human freedom and human
rights.
</P>
<P>
To reverse the worrisome trend, Obasanjo said at the party
that his administration would launch people-based programs with
support from development partners like the UNDP.
</P>
<P>
He also urged greater collaboration among regional groupings
such as the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and
the Southern African Development Community (SADC) in the areas of
poverty and weathering of the negative globalization implications.
</P>
<P>
Diabre in his remarks, pledged the UNDP's readiness to
strengthen its cooperation with Nigeria to encourage sustainable
development.

<HEADLINE> Bank of New York Launches Money for Russia Mobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Billions of dollars have been
channeled through the Bank of New York in the last year in what is
believed to be a major money laundering operation by Russia mafia,
The New York Times reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
From October through March, some 4.2 billion U.S. dollars in
more than 10,000 transactions passed through one account, the
newspaper quoted investigators as saying.
</P>
<P>
The investigators estimate that as much as 10 billion U.S.
dollars may have flowed through the bank in that account and
related ones since early last year.
</P>
<P>
"Investigators say the transactions seem to add up to one of
the largest money laundering operations ever uncovered in the
United States, with vast sums of money moving in and out of the
bank in a day," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Natasha Gurfinkel Kagalovsky and Lucy Edwards, two senior
officers in the Bank of New York, have been suspended because of
their suspected roles in the operation.
</P>
<P>
They have been suspended pending completion of the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
"What we have here is the penetration of a major U.S.
organization by Russian organized crime," an American government
official was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The outflow of money out of Russia has accelerated since the
collapse of the Russian financial system last year in a crisis.

<HEADLINE> Registration in Ghana Varsity Takes off Under Tight Guard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Registration of freshmen at the
University of Ghana in Accra Thursday took off under tight police
guard as the National Union of Ghana Students continues protest
against new "astronomical" university fees, Ghana News Agency
(GNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
About 200 Policemen have been deployed to assist the
university security guards to ensure the smooth running of the
exercise, with two riot-control trucks ready at strategic
positions on the campus.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of freshmen queued to pay their fees, which amounted
to 300,000 cedis (about 120 U.S. dollars), the monthly salary of a
fairly senior public officer, up from 50,000 cedis (20 U.S.
dollars) of last year.
</P>
<P>
The government has announced a three-billion-cedi (about 1.1
million dollars) bursary for needy students but was rejected.
</P>
<P>
The Students Representative Council (SRC) of the University of
Ghana, Legon, has threatened to take legal action against the
Ghana Police Service and the Ministry of the Interior for
"brutality" meted out to students during last Friday's
demonstration against the new fees.
</P>
<P>
 Nii Narku Dowuona, President of the SRC, told Ghana News
Agency that during the demonstration, many of their colleagues
were brutalized by people who claimed they were policemen
although they did not have identification numbers.
</P>
<P>
The Police Administration Wednesday defended the action of
policemen during the demonstration by saying that although the
demonstration started peacefully, at a point where the police
insisted on confining the demonstrators to agreed routes, it
became clear that some elements among them were bent on violence
and confrontation.
</P>
<P>
"They manifested this when they started burning tyres on the
asphalt road constructed from the tax-payers' money," he said.
</P>
<P>
Dowuona said the SRC has no intention of disrupting the
on-going registration process, "but when we report on campus, we
shall see whether the academic calendar will be interrupted or
not."
</P>
<P>
 However, T. Tabi, Senior Assistant Registrar of the
University of Ghana, described the students' threat as "a bluff",
saying that if they refuse to pay the new fees, they
automatically forfeit their status as students of the university.

<HEADLINE> Bush Denies Illegal Drug Use In Past 25 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Republican presidential
front-runner George W. Bush said Thursday he has not used illegal
drugs in the past 25 years.
</P>
<P>
The Texas governor said he could pass White House anti-drug
standards set by President Bill Clinton and his father, former
President George Bush.
</P>
<P>
Bush made the remarks under mounting pressure. He Wednesday
refused to answer to the persistent but unproven rumor that he
used illegal drugs when he was young, but he abandoned his
strategy to dodge the questions Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Not only could I pass the background check and the standards
applied to today's White House, but I could have passed the
background check and the standards applied on the most stringent
conditions when my dad was the president of the United States" he
said at a press conference in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
A day earlier, Bush told The Dallas Morning News that he had
not used drugs in the past seven years, the time frame used in
normal background checks of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
</P>
<P>
Bush admitted that he made some mistakes over two decades ago
but he learned from those mistakes.
</P>
<P>
"Should I become the president, my pledge to the American
people is that I will uphold the honor and dignity of the office
to which I have been elected," he said at Thursday's news conference.
</P>
<P>
Bush has admitted to some heavy drinking when he was younger,
but he has declined to say if he ever used illegal drugs,
describing questions about the issue as part of a political game
which he refuses to play.
</P>
<P>
The drug issue is expected to come up again and again during
the presidential campaign. The United States will hold
presidential election in November 2000.
</P>
<P>
When Clinton was Arkansas governor seeking the presidency, he
also dodged questions about drug use. Clinton later admitted that
he smoked marijuana, but didn't inhale.

<HEADLINE> Highest Quarterly Shipment Registered in Asian PC Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The Asia-Pacific PC market
continued along the path of recovery in the second quarter,
reaching the highest quarterly shipment total ever.
</P>
<P>
According to a report released Thursday by U.S. market analysis
firm International Data Corporation (IDC), total PC shipments for
the region, excluding Japan, amounted to 3.5 million units, up 34
percent over the same period a year ago and 18 percent over the
first quarter.
</P>
<P>
In terms of end-user revenue, IDC said, the second quarter
market was worth 4.8 billion U.S. dollars, up 33 percent from a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
"The region's economic recovery is clearly the most significant
factor," said IDC in explaining the regional market growth. "But
low PC penetration, price erosion, the consumer market, and now
the nearly-free PC trend are factors setting the stage for the
surge to continue."
</P>
<P>
Every country in the region generated positive annual shipment
growth in the second quarter, with increases ranging from roughly
11 percent in Malaysia to more than a five-fold increase in
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
China remained the region's largest market in the second
quarter, accounting for more than one-third of total PC demand in
Asia-Pacific excluding Japan. However, IDC said, annual growth in
China was roughly half the regional average as PC shipment in the
country increased just 17.6 percent. Despite strong consumer
market expansion, PC growth in China's commercial sector was
sluggish in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
Growth in South Korea was particularly healthy during the
quarter as strengthening economic conditions enabled the market to
produce nearly 78 percent annual shipment growth, IDC said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Army to Skip Final Test of Missile Interceptor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Defense Department
announced Thursday that it will skip a planned third test of an
anti-missile missile.
</P>
<P>
The decision gives the Army a tentative go-ahead to move into
the next phase of development of the Theater High Altitude Area
Defense (THAAD) system that is the centerpiece of the Pentagon's
effort to provide missile protection abroad for U.S. and allied
troops and their staging areas.
</P>
<P>
The main reason for moving ahead with THAAD after two successes
instead of three is to force the missile contractor, Lockheed
Martin, to focus on the missile interceptor that will actually be
fielded, rather than the prototype used thus far, said Peter
Franklin, deputy director of the Ballistic Missile Defense
Organization.
</P>
<P>
Franklin said the two successful tests this summer have
"proven" that the missile works. Critics, however, said after the
second successful test in August that the THAAD system should be
tested against faster, more capable missiles than the Hera rockets
used in testing at White Sands Missile Range.
</P>
<P>
He said a final decision will be made next year on beginning
the next phase of the project, in which Lockheed Martin will
translate the design work done thus far into a missile that will
enter initial low-rate production. The Pentagon is scheduled to
begin fielding the THAAD system in 2007.
</P>
<P>
Franklin did not say whether skipping the final flight test
will enable it to be fielded earlier than that.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Department has spent about 4 billion U.S. dollars
on THAAD so far. Skipping the final flight test will save 15
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Pentagon said it would require Lockheed Martin
to validate its design by scoring three successful intercepts. The
missile had failed in its first six attempts to shoot down a mock
warhead, but it recorded its first success on June 10 this year,
followed by another August 2.

Gold Council report made public Thursday.
</P>
<P>
But the really staggering figure is the 32 percent increase in
investment demand for gold, so much for those who insist that
since it cannot earn interest or a return, but is inert, gold is
not an investment.
</P>
<P>
Overall demand set records in Asia, the U.S., the Gulf states
and Mexico. People either mine gold or have always bought gold
because they know its value to them, a BBC report said.
</P>
<P>
In East Asia, a return to sunny growth and fast performing
stock markets have chased away the economic winter of the past two
years and given people a little of the ability to indulge
themselves again.
</P>
<P>
The gold price has remained remarkably resilient to big central
bank sales and threats of sales, pinned between 255 and 260 U.S.
dollars an ounce.
</P>
<P>
The gold industry has engineered an impressive rearguard
defense in the wake of official plans to sell gold holdings.
</P>
<P>
Pressure grows daily on the British government to change its
mind about gold sales, and the U.S. Congress is barracked by its
own and other gold miners, warning of the dire consequences for
jobs, national income, investment, if the gold price is depressed
much more.
</P>
<P>
Most of the IMF gold is accounted for at the prevailing
official rate when gold was officially demonetized in 1972, that
is 42 U.S. dollars an ounce.
</P>
<P>
One U.S. senator has even suggested that the U.S. take back the
gold it gave to the IMF and revalue it. That could have an
interesting effect on the U.S. reserve picture, but might send a
rather inward-looking signal to the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
Even senior IMF officials talk of alternatives to gold sales to
raise cash for developing countries. But analysts believe the gold
price could go down some way yet, BBC said.

KUALA LUMPUR, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will extend
financial aid to Turkey which was hit by a strong earthquake,
Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
The exact amount of the aid was being finalized, he told
reporters in the southern state of Johor, Bernama news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
It would be better to send over the money than food as the cost
of transporting it would be three to four times the value of the
food itself, he said, adding that with the money they could buy
the food which they preferred.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia was also considering other forms of aid for
Turkey.

DHAKA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-nine Bangladeshi police
officers, "disqualified" in tests carried out in Kosovo,
Yugoslavia, returned home early Friday.
</P>
<P>
The officers, "disqualified" in tests carried out in Pristina,

KATHMANDU, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Nepal should maintain
excellent relations with both of its giant neighbors -- China and
India -- on the basis of mutual respect for each other's
aspiration and understanding, Nepali Prime Minister Krishna Prasad
Bhattarai said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar here on Nepal's foreign policy, Bhattarai
said the observation made by the late king Prithivinarayan Shah
after the unification of Nepal that Nepal is "a yam between two
stones" is still relevant today.
</P>
<P>
A further strengthening of Nepal's distinct national identity
and pursuit of socio-economic progress in a democratic framework
are the country's cardinal goals into the next century, and
cooperation and mutual understanding with other countries are
essential to achieve these goals, said Bhattarai.
</P>
<P>
He said the world of the 21st century should be able to fully
utilize the wisdom and vision of the east, adding that the
co-existence of the east and west should be the highlight of the
new millennium for durable peace and overall prosperity of
mankind.

<HEADLINE> Onex Poised to Merge Canadian Carriers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- A double airline takeover is
being planned with a series of talks already underway between
Toronto-based Onex Corp. and the troubled Canadian Airlines
International, media reports here said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Investor Gerry Schwartz of Onex is considering a bid to buy and
merge Canadian Airlines International and Air Canada, which will
meet each other next week to discuss restructuring the airline
industry in Canada, the Globe and Mail newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The merger plan was also on the agenda of a three-day caucus
meeting of the ruling Liberal Party this week. Liberal MPs told
Transport Minister David Collenette that the government must
ensure that any deal not result in higher prices or reduced
services.
</P>
<P>
The Liberal government is said to brace for a single national
airline, so long as regional carriers and charter airlines could
provide additional competition.
</P>
<P>
While Canadian Airlines' debt is hovering close to one billion
Canadian dollars (about 669 million U.S. dollars), Air Canada
spokeswoman Pricille LeBlanc said her company does not see an
urgent need to merge.
</P>
<P>
"Our company's financial viability is not in any way threatened,
" she was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
But she agreed that Air Canada wants better access to lucrative
Asian routes, particularly those to Hong Kong and Tokyo, which are
under control of Canadian Airlines International.

BELGRADE, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Ambassador to the

In a note to Yoshio Utsumithe, secretary general of the UN

<HEADLINE> Russia-U.S. ABM/START Talks Get Nowhere </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 20 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking Russian military
official said Friday that talks with the United States on Anti-
Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty and the third stage of the
Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START III) have got nowhere.
</P>
<P>
"There are no results," said Leonid Ivashov, head of the
Russian Defense Ministry's International Military Cooperation
Department, referring to consultations in Moscow from August 17 to
19.
</P>
<P>
He said both sides merely stated their approaches during the
talks.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. approach to deployment of the regional anti-ballistic
missile defense systems is apparently "in the spirit of the
American policy," the Itar-Tass news agency quoted Ivashov as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"First the decision is made, the financing of the work is done,
companies get research and development orders. All this is done in
violation of the agreements on the ABM treaty of 1972," Ivashov
said. "Then Russia is put before an accomplished fact: now let's
come to agreement."
</P>
<P>
He reiterated Moscow's objection to revising the ABM treaty,
warning that violation of the treaty would undermine the whole
process of nuclear deterrence.
</P>
<P>
Ivashov also criticized Washington for tying the future of the
START III treaty to modification of the ABM treaty.
</P>
<P>
According to the Interfax news agency, Russia has proposed that
the two sides cut their nuclear warheads to 1,500 or less each, a
slash sharper than Washington suggested under START III.
</P>
<P>
During August 17-19 talks, the U.S. side insisted on 2,000-2,
500 warheads as the aim of START III, Interfax reported, quoting
diplomatic sources.
</P>
<P>
Moscow and Washington have already signed two START treaties
under which the two sides' nuclear warheads would each be cut to 3,
000 to 3,500. While U.S. Congress approved the START II in 1996,
the Russian State Duma, or lower house of parliament, has yet to
ratify the accord.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Toronto-Dominion Bank, one of
Canada's financial giants, has become the country's first to make
more than one billion Canadian dollars within one quarter.
</P>
<P>
Canadian media said Friday that TD Bank collected 1.47 billion
Canadian dollars (about 984 million U.S. dollars) in profit over
the three months ended July 31.
</P>
<P>
The gain beat a previous quarterly profit record of 533 million
Canadian dollars (about 357 million dollars) set by Bank of Nova
Scotia in 1997.
</P>
<P>
TD Bank's big profit is largely due to money it pocketed by
spinning off its global discount brokerage empire, the media said.

WASHINGTON, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. Texas Governor George W. Bush, struggling to contain
the first crisis of his front-running presidential campaign, said
Thursday that he has not used illegal drugs at any time during the
past 25 years.
</P>
<P>
-- The immense scale of the human toll from a devastating
earthquake in Turkey became more apparent Thursday, as the
official number of dead nearly doubled to exceed 7,000 and the
government told the United Nations that tens of thousands of
people may still lie beneath collapsed slabs of concrete.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The Bank of New York, in an effort to expand a lucrative and
growing business in eastern Europe, aggressively pursued relations
with many of Russia's largest banks, a strategy that may have
contributed to the embarrassing questions about money laundering
that the bank now faces.
</P>
<P>
-- France vented long-simmering uneasiness over the continuing
U.S.-led bombing raids on Iraq, setting the stage for what
diplomats expect to be a confrontation with the United States at
the United Nations General Assembly next month.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. trade deficit rose to a record 24.62 billion U.S.
dollars in June. The deficit in goods and services jumped by 3.45
billion U.S. dollars from May's figure.
</P>
<P>
-- The world's largest bank would be formed by three of Japan's
biggest banks, which are planning to merge into a holding company.

ATHENS, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Two more Greek Air Force C-130
transport planes carrying 15 tons of humanitarian aid and some
flame retarding agents left Friday for Istanbul, Turkey, to help
earthquake relief efforts there.

<HEADLINE> One Million Somalis May Face Food Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Over one million people in
southern Somalia may face food shortage as another dismal harvest
is expected due to prolonged dry period, the U.N. World Food
Program (WFP) said in a release obtained here Friday.
</P>
<P>
A recent assessment of the Gu crop, Somalia's most important
cereal harvest which constitutes 75 to 80 percent of the country's
annual production, confirmed that this year's harvest will only
just exceed that of 1998, the lowest production in five years,
said the release.
</P>
<P>
The assessment was jointly carried out by WFP, the Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO), and WFP's partners, the Food
Security Assessment Unit and the Famine Early Warning System.
</P>
<P>
"People's household stocks of grain are nearly exhausted after
 consecutive crop failures," said Burk Oberle, WFP's country
director for Somalia based in Nairobi, adding "many poor people
will find it very hard to fend off hunger in the months to come."
</P>
<P>
Only 128,880 tons of sorghum and maize will be harvested this
year, as compared with 101,760 tons in 1998, which was especially
low because of El Nino floods, the release said.
</P>
<P>
Oberle said: "We are heading for a humanitarian tragedy in
southern Somalia unless we get resources to help these people
during the coming weeks and months ahead."
</P>
<P>
The looming drought and food emergency have prompted the
Somalia Aid Coordination Body and the U.N. Office for the
Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs to launch a donor alert for
17.5 million U.S. dollars in early July.
</P>
<P>
Contributions are urgently required to provide food aid and
health assistance as well as seeds for the next crop, Oberle
said, adding that so far, only a fraction of the funding required
has been firmly pledged.

CAIRO, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
ALGIERS -- A power-generating station will be built by Italian
company Insaldo in the Al-Hamah district of Algiers, capital of
Algeria, at a capacity of 210 megawatts.
</P>
<P>
The project will cost 277 million U.S. dollars to be covered by
Arab investors, the Arabic daily Al-Hayat reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development will
undertake 100 million dollars of the total investment, the Islamic
Development Bank 20 million dollars and the Saudi Development Fund
22 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Abu-Dhabi Development Fund (ADF) of the United Arab
Emirates agreed last Tuesday to cover 20 million dollars of the
cost.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The United Bank of Egypt (UBE) was awarded a contract
on the purchase of 93 percent of the shares of the Arab-African
Bank of Egypt (AABE).
</P>
<P>
The deal amounts in value to some 356 million Egyptian pounds (
103.19 million U.S. dollars), local daily Al-Ahram reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The UBE won the deal as it offered the highest prices of 53
pounds (15.36 dollars) per share, after a fierce competition with
French, Kuwaiti and Bahraini banks.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Stoichkov to Recover in Bankya Spa after Electric Shock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- 1994 European Player of the Year
and top scorer of the 1994 FIFA World Cup Hristo Stoichkov told
the press Friday of an August 12 domestic accident where he
sustained an electric shock and had to spend several days at the
Academy of Military Medicine (AMM).
</P>
<P>
Stoichkov was showing his former Barcelona teammate Alesanco
and Bulgarian footballer Peter Mihtarski around his summer house.
</P>
<P>
"I reached out to open a door and found two bare cables. One
touched me," he said. At first Stoickhov got frightened but he
felt okay and went home unperturbed. Then at 10.30 in the evening
he felt cold and started sweating. He knew something was wrong.
</P>
<P>
Stoichkov believes he is alive thanks to his cheap watch whose
metal leash he said took most of the electric shock. The other
important thing was that he wore shoes with rubber soles.
</P>
<P>
Associate Professor Nikolai Ivanov of the AMM Intensive Care
Ward said Stoichkov has the healthy body of an athlete and was
also a very good patient. He had a cold to which the electric
shock was added. He said the medical team was fortunate to handle
the effects of both relatively quickly.
</P>
<P>
Stoichkov is now going to a military recuperation home in the
Bankya spa near Sofia where he will stay until his complete
recovery. Dr. Ivanov said the footballer would not be there long
but would not say when exactly he would be checked out.
</P>
<P>
"Hristo touched a 200-volt cable with his left hand that is
only 40cm from the heart but the current did not pass through his
whole body because he wore rubber-sole shoes. It was God's work...
," said Dr. Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
Asked about his future career, Stoichkov said with a smile, "
The Bulgarian papers today write I am lost for football. Then
they send me to Litex and Spain. The only thing I care about now
is my health. I do not worry about football.
</P>
<P>
"I haven't terminated my contract with the Japanese Kishawa
Raysol. We have only agreed with the team management that I would
not play in the first phase. My contract is effective and I must
go back to Japan."

<HEADLINE> China's Mainland the Biggest Contributor to HK Tourism Receipts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 20 (Xinhua) -- China's mainland remained the
biggest contributor to Hong Kong's tourism receipts in the first
half of 1999, the Hong Kong Tourist Association (HKTA) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Of the total tourism receipts, those from the Chinese
mainlanders accounted for 28.6 percent, up 2.1 percent from the
same period last year, and Taiwan took the second place with 19.6
percent, followed by countries and regions in Asia, according to
figures released by HKTA.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong tourism receipts for the first half of 1999 totaled
25.2 billion HK dollars (3.23 billion U.S. dollars), similar to
the same period last year, despite a strong growth in visitor
arrivals.
</P>
<P>
The visitor arrivals in the first half of this year totaled
five million, up 10 percent from the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
HKTA Deputy Executive Director Douglas Gautier attributed the
stagnant visitor spending to the effect of depreciation of
currencies in the major source markets and lower price in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
Shopping stood the biggest expenditure category, accounting for
more than 50 percent of the total, followed by hotel bills at 24.7
percent.
</P>
<P>
Overall average spending per capita for January-June 1999 was 4,
817 HK dollars (617 U.S. dollars), down 11.7 percent, with total
daily spending averaging 1,460 HK dollars (187 U.S. dollars), down
8.5 percent.

scientific exchanges, especially among the younger generation of
scientists, will benefit both countries and the stability and
prosperity of the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>

China Opposes Including Taiwan in TMD
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government and people firmly oppose any attempt by
any country to include Taiwan in the Theater Missile Defense (TMD),
Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said here today.
</P>
<P>
The remark came when Zhu was commenting on Lee Teng-hui's
recent statement at a meeting of the Kuomintang that efforts to
develop the TMD are needed in view of the current situation.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that recently Lee made his "two states" remarks, which
were met with strong opposition by the Chinese people and
criticized by the world opinion. Zhu also said that Lee and the
Taiwan authorities have no intention of mending their ways, but
talk about joining the TMD, further exposing their vicious
intentions to resist reunification and separate the motherland by
attempting to strengthen the military.
</P>
<P>
Lee and the Taiwan authorities need to be aware of the fact
that separatist activities and pushing for Taiwan independence
will go nowhere and are doomed to failure, Zhu stressed.
</P>
<P>

American citizen Daja Mizu Meston and Australian citizen John
Gabriel Lafitte, and he said they had conducted illegal covering
and photographing in closed areas where clearly marked
restrictions signs were posted.
</P>
<P>
The two foreigners were involved in activities inconsistent
with their status in China and violated Chinese law, the spokesman
said, adding that a Chinese public security department conducted
investigations about them according to law.

<P>
SEVILLE, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Former Olympic and world
champion Heike Drechsler of Germany pulled out of the world
championships because of a calf muscle injury on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Dreschler, 34, had undergone a test on the injured muscle and
found it was impossible to compete in the world championships,
which will start late on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We realized it did not make any sense to compete under such
circumstances," said Alain Blondell, Drechsler's coach and partner.
</P>
<P>
The veteran star won the first women's world long jump gold
medal in the 1993 world championships in Helsinki, Finland, in
1983. She was also the gold medalist in the 1992 Olympic Games
and runner-up in the 1998 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Her withdrawal is sure to boost American Marion Jones' chance
to win four gold medals -- 100 meters, 200m, long jump and 1600m
relay. The German defeated Jones in the World Cup last year to
snap the American's 37-match winning streak.

<HEADLINE> Horse Race Upgraded from Noble Privilege to Mass Entertainment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Forty years ago, both Gesang Namje
and horses were the instrument for the serf owners to seek
pleasure.
</P>
<P>
After forty years Gesang has become the master of his own
destiny and he can ride his own horse to win glory and respect for
himself.
</P>
<P>
Gesang, 60, attends the sixth national ethnic games as the
oldest racer and he was excited about the chance to compete in
such sports gala which has drawn 31 ethnic minorities from across
the country.
</P>
<P>
"We used to be the 'live stock who can speak'. We have no
personal freedom. Even if we could join in the horse racing, we
are no more than a laughing stock for the serf owners," said the
Tibetan who used to raise and train horse for the serf owners as a
teenager.
</P>
<P>
"They drank wine each day while we shed tears." said the man
who could not erase the past suffering from his memory.
</P>
<P>
"In the past such quality horses were only available to the
noble. When they felt uneasy on horseback, they would let out
their anger by whipping relentlessly the serf who trained horses,"
said Gesang Namje
</P>
<P>
But it has been a different story, said Gesang.
</P>
<P>
"In the past if our performance failed to satisfy the serf
owners, we would surely be whipped. But now if our performance are
good, we will win applause from spectators. If we fail to do a
good job, we will get the comfort of others instead of whipping
punishment.
</P>
<P>
"We came here not only to produce great performance, but also
to demonstrate the encouraging image of the Tibet Autonomous
Region and show the spirits and morale of the former serfs who
have now become the masters of our own destiny."
</P>
<P>
It was the same case with the other serfs who have won their
freedom since 1959 when the Democratic Reform was launched,
abolishing the system of exploitation and separating religion from
government.
</P>
<P>
On the stands where the serf owners used to watch his serf race,
a similar scene to the bullfighting in ancient Rome, ordinary
Tibetans make it a place to enjoy themselves.
</P>
<P>
Chosung, who was also slaved by serf owners as a young man,
became emotional when he saw the horse race has become the mass
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
"Now we former serfs spend only 20 yuan RMB (2.5 dollars) to
watch the race from the stand, which had been a privilege to the
nobles. If I were younger, I would take part in the competition,
because it has become the concern of our ordinary people," he said.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Team to Hold Talks With Taliban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 20 (Xinhua) -- A Pakistani negotiating team
will visit the Afghan city of Kandahar, headquarters of the
Taliban militia Saturday for talks with Taliban leaders, official
sources here said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani delegation, shuttling between the Taliban and the
opposition alliance on a mission to seek a peaceful settlement of
the Afghan crisis, is to hold talks with Taliban's supreme leader
Mulla Mohammad Omar, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The same Pakistani team has met with a four-member delegation
of the anti-Taliban alliance this week in Dushanbe, capital of
Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani side will brief the Taliban leaders about its
talks with the opposition alliance in Dushanbe and will also
discuss with them ways to find a negotiated settlement of the
long-running crisis, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
The sources also said that the Pakistani team is likely to
proceed again to Tajikistan for the second round of talks with the
opposition alliance.
</P>
<P>
The sources dismissed as baseless reports that the Afghan
opposition declined to meet with the Pakistani delegation in
Dushanbe.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani team held wide-ranging talks with a high-level
delegation of the Afghan opposition and discussed a couple of
proposals aimed at ending the Afghan crisis, they said.
</P>
<P>
This was the first face-to-face contact between Pakistan and
the anti-Taliban alliance in almost three years. The sources
described the talks between them as "positive."
</P>
<P>
The Afghan opposition led by former defense minister Ahmed Shah
Masood has accused Pakistan of backing the Taliban, a charge
denied by the Pakistani government.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Task Force to Assess NATO Bombing Impact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 20 (Xinhua) -- A United Nations task
force is preparing to assess the environmental impact of the
recent U.S.-led NATO bombing of Yugoslavia on the Danube River,
U.N. officials said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The task force jointly organized by U.N. Environment Program
(UNEP) and the Human Settlements (Habitat) Balkans Task Force
will leave from Budapest on Monday and travel down the Danube
River for a week to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Last month, a previous Balkans Task Force mission assessed
environmental damage at selected industrial sites in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Habitat segment of the Balkans Task Force is still in
Pristina, the provincial capital of Kosovo in the Serbian
Republic, where the task force members are looking into urban
management, rehabilitation, housing, property laws and other
issues related to human settlements, the U.N. officials said.
</P>
<P>
Starting March 24, NATO staged 79-day air strikes on
Yugoslavia, dealing a severe damage to many civilian infrastructure,
including those on the Danube River section in Yugoslavia. The air
strikes created serious pollution problems in the Balkans and
even Europe as a whole, not to mention the humanitarian crisis the
military alliance brought about in the region, observers here said.
</P>
<P>
The Danube River, running some 2,780 kilometers in length, is
Europe's second largest river. Rising in the Black Forest, it
flows east through Germany, Austria, and Hungry, where it receives
the Drava, the Sava and the Tisa. It cuts between the Carpathians
and the Balkan mountains, runs along the Romanian-Bulgarian
border, then curves up into Romania and flows into the Black Sea
in a huge, three-armed delta.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Cuba flashed its deadly form to
beat South Korea 3-0 in the opener of the Manila leg of the World
Women's Volleyball Grand Prix on Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
The scores were 25-21, 25-19, 25-22.
</P>
<P>
The 1996 Atlanta Olympics gold medalists Cubans rallied several
times to win the first set. The South Koreans, led by Park Mee-
Kyung and Chang Yoon-Hee, played aggressively in the second and
third set but Cuba defended well to win the match.
</P>
<P>
Cuba's Yumilka Ruiz Luaces scored her 10 points, nine from
attacks while Taismary Aguero, Ana Valle Fernandez and team
captain Bell Mckenzie contributed nine points each.
</P>
<P>
It was a sweet revenge for the hard-fighting Cubans who lost to
the South Koreans, 20-25, 16-25, 25-15, 25-20, 13-15 in their
preliminary encounter in Genting, Malaysia last week.
</P>
<P>
Cuban head coach Antonio Perdomo said his team worked very hard.
He promised that his players will perform better in next two games.
</P>
<P>
Perdomo also observed that the South Koreans did not receive
well compared to their previous match.
</P>
<P>
South Korean coach Kim Cheol-Yong said his team lost because
they made a lot of mistakes while the Cuban attackers played very
well. He added that they would do their best to improve their game.
</P>
<P>
The four teams are actually going for crucial points that will
get them entry into the crossover semifinals where a 370,000-
dollar pot topped by a 200,000-dollar champion's prize is on offer.
</P>
<P>
Competing in the other group in Chinese Taipei are Russia,
Japan, China and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The GP finals will be staged in Yunnan province, China on
August 28-29.

<P>
BEIJING, August 20 (Xinhua) -- China's police have detained an
American and an Australian who were allegedly involved in illegal
covering and photographing in northwest China's Qinghai Province,
Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said here today.
</P>
<P>
In responding to a reporter, Zhu confirmed the detention of
American citizen Daja Mizu Meston and Australian citizen John
Gabriel Lafitte, and he said they had conducted illegal covering
and photographing in closed areas where clearly marked
restrictions signs were posted.
</P>
<P>
The two foreigners were involved in activities inconsistent
with their status in China and violated Chinese law, the spokesman
said, adding that a Chinese public security department conducted
investigations about them according to law.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese security department kept watch on their residences
on August 18, and began to investigate their activities according
to law, and the two have candidly confessed their illegal
activities, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Meston, who was severely injured when he jumped from a building
attempting to escape that afternoon, is out of danger after
emergency treatment, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
He said Meston and Lafitte were reportedly detained for
studying poverty-relief projects in the province. However, they
were neither entrusted by the World Bank nor invited by relevant
Chinese department to do so, he noted.

<P>
MACAO, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Out of the 16 elected members of
the current Macao Legislative Assembly, 15 have requested
continued membership with the First Legislative Council of the
future Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
The application for membership with the SAR legislature began
on August 9 and concluded on Friday at the Macao office of the
Secretariat of the Preparatory Committee for the Macao SAR.
</P>
<P>
"The application process went on very smoothly over the past
days," Tina Ting Yee Ho, vice-secretary-general of the secretariat,

</P>
<P>
On August 28 and 29, the 10th Plenary Session of the
Preparatory Committee will decide whether the applicants can
become law-makers of the SAR, she said.
</P>
<P>
The Macao Legislative Assembly comprises 23 members, including
eight directly elected by individual voters, eight indirectly
chosen by social bodies representing different social quarters.
The remaining seven were appointed by the governor of Macao.
</P>
<P>

principle of national sovereignty and smooth transition.
</P>
<P>
According to the method, the first SAR legislature will have
the same number of elected legislators, and another seven will be
appointed by the first chief executive of the SAR.
</P>
<P>
The elected members of the current legislature, provided they
uphold the Macao Basic Law, pledge allegiance to the Macao SAR and
meet the requirements set forth in the Basic Law, can become
members of the First Legislative Council of the SAR.
</P>
<P>
The term of office of members of the First Legislative Council
of the Macao SAR shall last until October 15, 2001.

<HEADLINE> Japan's War Orphans Unveil Monument to Foster Chinese Parents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, August 20 (Xinhua) -- More than 100 former Japanese
war orphans today attended the unveiling ceremony for a monument
to their Chinese foster parents in Shenyang, capital of northeast
China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
The Gratitude to Chinese Adoptive Parents Monument was built
with donations from 1,348 former Japanese World War II orphans.
</P>
<P>
It was erected within Shenyang's Memorial Hall of September 18,
the day when the Japanese army invaded China in 1931.
</P>
<P>
The 2.8-meter-high bronze monument features a Chinese peasant
couple holding a small Japanese orphan.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of Chinese adoptive parents and several
volunteers also were present at today's ceremony.
</P>
<P>
When Japan surrendered in 1945, its military and civilians
pulled out of China in a life-or-death exodus, leaving many babies
and children behind. The deserted Japanese were later taken in by
local Chinese parents.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that over 2,500 such Japanese children
eventually returned to Japan with the help of the Chinese and
Japanese governments.
</P>
<P>
There are about 200 of these former Japanese orphans still
living with their adoptive Chinese parents.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Dozens of leading Chinese
scientists and business executives gathered here Friday to offer
advice for the takeoff of Hong Kong's biotechnology industry.
</P>
<P>
"Innovation comes from sharing ideas from all over the world,"
said Dr. Kenneth Fong, president and founder of CLONTECH
Laboratories, Inc., who delivered a special report about how to
translate technology into commercial products.
</P>
<P>
Fong revealed the secrets of his success in the United States
at the Friday's Workshop of Development of Biotechnology Industry:
from Research to Commercial Products, which was held in the
Chinese University of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"It is the spirit of competitiveness," Fong said, adding that
Silicon Valley is always competing in technology while Hong Kong
in high buildings.
</P>
<P>
Changing the attitude of local people toward the development of
biotech industry and educating people in the technology is at the
moment of primary importance as Hong Kong is working towards the
promotion of innovation and development of high value-added
biotech industry, said Dr. Joseph K. K. Li, director of Program in
Molecular Biology of Utah State University.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese scientists all over the world are confident on the
future of Hong Kong biotech industry with local government's
promotion," Li said.
</P>
<P>
Yung-Chi Cheng, professor of the Pharmacology Department of the
Medicine School of Yale University, stressed the important role of
Chinese medicine in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
Cheng said that the development of Chinese medicine needs
global efforts of Chinese scientists since we will face in future
the problems of a mixed medicine rather than the traditional or
modern Chinese medicine.
</P>
<P>
Some 100 leading entrepreneurs in biotech industry shared their
successful experience and provided opportunities for local
scientists, industrialists to gain a comprehensive look of how
biological knowledge can be commercialized.

Cabinda, the richest province of Angola, has been deteriorating in
the latest months, a local newspaper reported here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The daily Jornal De Angola quoted Jose Amaro Tati, governor of
the Cabinda Province, as saying that the serious situation is due
to its "isolated" geographic position.
</P>
<P>
The "obstacle" has caused "a negative social contour" of the
province, made it fall into a situation of "economic island," and
so, aggravated the life of the local residents, the governor said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the geographic position has also elevated the
customs cost, which cast shadow over the life of local residents.
</P>
<P>
"The cost of life is going up everyday. All those goods
reaching here are much more expensive due to the cost of
transportation," he added.
</P>
<P>
The elevation of the cost of life is also due to the
newly-adopted system of floating exchange rate announced by the
Angolan government in late May, which devaluated by a large margin
its currency readjusted kwanza.
</P>
<P>
Cabinda, about 50 kilometers north to the Angola's north border
with the Democratic Republic of the Congo, produces half of the
petroleum of the country which is the second largest oil producer
in Africa, just after Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Abundant oil resources made the province the richest area of
the country. But most necessities of life in the province are
imported.

<HEADLINE> Books on Tortoise Shell Inscription Published </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Three books collecting the
fruits of research into ancient Chinese characters inscribed on
tortoise shells were published today, according to an
international symposium which opened here marking the centennial
of the discovery of the mysterious ancient characters.
</P>
<P>
The three works were presented to the symposium by scholars
from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
One of the books reviews studies on the ancient characters over
the past 100 years, and points out areas for future research.
</P>
<P>
Another presents all 13,766 pieces of tortoise shell
inscriptions found so far, two-thirds of which have been made
public for the first time, and amends some former work in this
field.
</P>
<P>
The inscriptions, dating to the Shang Dynasty (16th-11th
century BC), are considered to represent the foundation of the
Chinese language. Wang Yirong, a Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) scholar,
discovered the first 3,000-year-old shell with character
inscriptions in a Chinese pharmacy in 1899.

<HEADLINE> Forum in Memory of Late Chinese Revolutionary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 20 (Xinhua) -- A forum was held here today to
mark the 100th anniversary of the birth of Fang Zhimin, a great
proletarian revolutionary and militarist, and a leader of the
farmers' movement in the early years of the Communist Party of
China-led struggle against the Kuomintang regime.
</P>
<P>
Vice-President Hu Jintao addressed the forum and spoke highly
of Fang, urging everyone to follow the good traditions of
communist forerunners in realizing the great renaissance of the
Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Hu, also a member of the Standing Committee of
the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau, recalled Fang's
revolutionary life devoted to the happiness of the people and the
cause of communism.
</P>
<P>
Fang made creative contributions to the revolution under the
leadership of the CPC led by Mao Zedong, Hu said, noting that Fang
was a glorious example of seeking truth from facts.
</P>
<P>
According to Hu, the late Red Army leader was captured by
Kuomintang troops in 1935, when the CPC-led struggle was at low
tide. Fang never bowed to the enemy during his days of
imprisonment, and was later executed by the Kuomintang regime.
</P>
<P>
The vice president urged officials at all levels to learn from
Fang and build correct values in order to fight against every kind
of corrupt thinking.

<HEADLINE> Lee Teng-hui Imposes His Opinion on Public, Newspaper (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Taiwan's Lee Teng-hui cannot
expect to be saved by making use of "public opinion" in his scheme
to separate the motherland, the Liberation Army Daily warns in a
commentary to be published tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
"Public opinion" is the most misleading and provocative "card"
propping up Lee Teng-hui's "two states" statement, the commentary
points out.
</P>
<P>
Lee took advantage of the fact that some people in Taiwan have
not fully recognized the nature of his separatist remarks, as he
misled them by claiming that "the sovereignty of Taiwan belongs to
the Taiwan people."
</P>
<P>
The commentary says that Lee is a politician adept at playing
on public opinion. When his "two states" remark was strongly
condemned by people on both sides of the Straits, he asked his
subordinate to issue an explanation, asserting that Lee's "special
state-to-state relation" phrase "fully reflects the public opinion
of the Taiwan people."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Lee had also employed the words "public opinion" a
number of times to whitewash his separatist scheme. He even went
so far as to deceive via "public opinion polls."
</P>
<P>
Public opinion refer to the general views and wishes of the
people. By taking advantage of his special status, Lee has always
pretended that his own opinion is the public's opinion.
</P>
<P>
"Can he represent all the Chinese people, including the Taiwan
compatriots?" the commentary asks, and gives a resolutely negative
answer.
</P>
<P>
It says that seeking peace, security and development
constitutes the greatest wishes of the Taiwan people. Without a
stable and peaceful situation across the Straits and healthy cross-
Straits relations, there will be no social stability and economic
growth for Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Lee's remarks have led to strained cross-Straits relations and
chaos in the island's society and economic life. It goes against
the wishes of the Taiwan people and severely damages their
interests.
</P>
<P>
"Lee has no right to represent the public opinion of the Taiwan
people. On the contrary, he has totally betrayed the interests of
the Taiwan compatriots," the commentary stresses.

<HEADLINE> Lee Teng-hui Imposes His Opinion on Public, Newspaper (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Chinese nation is a large family, which includes people on
both sides of the Taiwan Straits. The "public opinion" of this big
family should reflect the opinions and wishes of the entire
Chinese nation, not just those confined to a small region, the
commentary says.
</P>
<P>
The issue of Taiwan is a by-product of China's civil war, and
the separation of the people on the mainland and Taiwan is a
historic anomaly. However, this can never alter the fact that the
people in Taiwan are part of the Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
Lee has deliberately put the two on opposite sides, with the
sinister hope of blurring the concept of one China and seeking
excuses for his "public opinion" card, the commentary says.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the public opinion representing the whole Chinese
nation if for realizing reunification through peaceful talks and
bringing an early end to the current separation, it notes.
</P>
<P>
By advocating the split of the Chinese nation and opposing
reunification, Lee's "two states" statement runs against the
public opinion of the whole nation. "It represents neither the
entire Chinese nation, nor compatriots in Taiwan, but only a small
number of die-hard separatists on the island," the article
stresses.
</P>
<P>
All the Chinese people, including people in Taiwan, yearn for a
peaceful and stable living environment. Lee's statement has
brought panic to the island and put the recently more relaxed
cross-Straits relationship into a new crisis.
</P>
<P>
In the past, Lee's deception fooled some people in Taiwan, but
when they realize his "two states" remark will spell disaster for
Taiwan, his elaborate scheme of separating the motherland will
vanish like soap bubbles.
</P>
<P>
"This has already been proved true by the fact that Lee's
remarks have been widely censured by the Taiwan media, and
declared not representative of the 22 million people in Taiwan by
over 100 professors there," the commentary notes.
</P>
<P>
Lee can't be saved by resorting to false public opinion. His "
public opinion" card actually contradicts the opinion of the
general public. For the Chinese people, the prevailing public
opinion is for national unity and reunification, it says.
</P>
<P>
"When the people of Taiwan come to realize that Lee's 'two
states' remark will bring them only calamity and disaster rather
than peace and prosperity, Lee will become a loner, cast away by
the entire Chinese nation," the article concludes.

<HEADLINE> China Building Large Crude Oil Ships For Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 20 (Xinhua) -- China's largest shipbuilding
contract ever was signed here in the Great Hall of the People
this afternoon by the China Shipbuilding Industry Corp.'s Dalian
New Shipyard.
</P>
<P>
The shipyard will build five 300,000-ton large crude oil
carriers for the Iranian National Petroleum Corporation. The ships
are 330 meters long and 58 meters wide and can hold 259,000 tons
of crude oil.
</P>
<P>
This is the first major order for China's shipbuilders after
the Asian financial crisis hit. It beat out five rivals in Japan
and the Republic of Korea, according to Huang Pingtao, the
corporation's general manager. Being able to build such a large
ship is an important indication of a country's industrial ability,
he says.
</P>
<P>
Since 1966, when the first of these large vessels was built,
435 have been built, mostly by shipyards in Japan and the ROK.
China established its first 300,000-ton shipyard in January, 1995,
the start of its competition with foreign counterparts.
</P>
<P>
China is the world's third largest shipbuilder, after Japan
and the ROK. Its shipbuilding capacity has increased since the
reforms and opening-up began in the late 1970s. By the end of 1998,
China had had orders for 2.36 million tons of new ships, putting
it in fifth place in the world.

<HEADLINE> Opera "Carmen" to Be Staged in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong is to stage the
passionate and romantic opera "Carmen" at the Hong Kong Cultural
Center Grand Theater from 25 September to 2 October.
</P>
<P>
The opera is one of the programs to celebrate the 10th
anniversary of the Hong Kong Cultural Center. Produced and
directed by Lo King-man, the masterpiece will be performed in four
acts, mingling love with hatred, mixing romance with tragedy.
</P>
<P>
"Carmen" is the work by French music genius Georges Bizet. The
opera was completed in the summer of 1874 and it remains one of
the most popular operas ever written. Based on Merimee's novel
Carmen, Bizet's opera was dramatized with great imagination by the
two librettists Meilhac and Halevy. The plot was enriched with
action and Carmen emerged as one of the most fascinating
characters while Jose's moral disintegration was most movingly
portrayed.
</P>
<P>
It is a story about military man Jose falling in love with an
enticing but fickle girl Carmen from a cigarette factory. The
tragedy begins when Carmen participates actively in smuggling
contraband goods while Jose joins her and deserts his services.
However, the gypsy girl quickly leaves him for the bullfighter,
Escamillo. The love story ends with death when Jose finally stabs
his lover outside the bullring.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra and the Hong Kong Opera
Society Chorus will join the cast of international vocalists to
perform in Opera "Carmen". The role of Carmen will be taken up by
two mezzo-sopranos, Sara Fulgoni and Patricia Fernandez.
</P>
<P>
Two renowned tenors, Peter Riberi and Warren Mok will play the
role of Don Jose.

<HEADLINE> China Wants To Provide More Competent And Innovative People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 20 (Xinhua) -- China is planning a new system
of higher education to produce more competent people with
innovative ideas, according to Zhong Binglin, the director of the
Ministry of Education's higher education department.
</P>
<P>
Zhong made the remark on the last day of a symposium on
advancing the country through science and education in Beijing
today, where he said that China will try to provide more
opportunities and to create a better environment for a "quality-
oriented" education by increasing school administration reforms
and funds for education.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government will involve various parts of society in
professional education and get funds from various parts of society
to augment the national budget, he said. China will increase the
proportion of education in the national budget by one percent a
year over the next three to five years and provide higher
education opportunities for 15 percent of its people by the year
2010 instead of the present 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Since 1995, the Ministry of Education and its predecessor, the
State Education Commission, have experimented with "quality-
oriented" education at 52 colleges, Zhong said, to improve the
ethics, culture, and professional training of students as well as
their physical and mental health.
</P>
<P>
The new higher education system will also improve the
connection between education and research. Colleges and
universities will be encouraged to establish enterprises or to set
up training centers in enterprises and enterprises will be
encouraged to establish research and development centers in
colleges to produce more competent people with innovative minds.

about joining the TMD, further exposing their vicious intentions
to resist reunification and split the motherland by attempting to
strengthen the military.
</P>
<P>
Lee and the Taiwan authorities need to be aware of the fact
that separatist activities and pushing for Taiwan independence
will go nowhere and are doomed to failure, Zhu stressed.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEVILLE, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Maurice Greene and Marion Jones,
the world's fastest man and woman, could win a total of seven gold
medals in the world athletics championships, which will open its
competition here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The American sprinters will take the limelight when they start
their defending campaigns in the 100 meters.
</P>
<P>
Jones, who remains unbeaten in the track since 1997, is bidding
to become the first athlete, man or woman, to win four gold medals
in the championships. She's will compete in the 100m, 200m, long
jump and 1600m relays.
</P>
<P>
"I will be disappointed if I come back with anything less than
four," Jones said.
</P>
<P>
Greene, who shattered the world's 100m record with an eye-
popping 9.79 seconds, will run in 100m, 200m and 400m relay. He
could become the first man to complete a 100-200 double in the
worlds, and the first in any major championships since Carl Lewis
in the 1984 Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
"I'm just eager to get on the track and run, " Greene said. "
They say the track is very fast. I just want to see how fast."
</P>
<P>
Jones is a sure shot at the 100m and 200m, but she will face
fierce challenge in long jump, mainly from Germany's long jump
legend Heike Drechsler, the former Olympic and world champion.

SEVILLE, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Olympic double gold medalist
Michael Johnson, bidding for a fourth consecutive 400 meters world
title, is still troubled by hip and leg injuries that could prove
fatal to the super star.
</P>
<P>
A hip problem leaves Johnson's legs like a tyre out of
alignment on an automobile, is therapist Dale Smith said.
</P>
<P>
"If Michael becomes a little rotated or out of alignment up in
his low back or pelvis, he creates stress across his legs in a way
they are really not designed to take stress," Smith said in a
press conference.
</P>
<P>
The injuries prevented Johnson from taking on fellow American
and world 100 meters world record holder Maurice Greene in a high-
profile showdown in the U.S. championships in June. He also pulled

<TEXT>
<P>
SEVILLE, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Cuban long jump star Ivan Pedros
said here on Friday that he hopes to win a third gold medal in the
world championships.
</P>
<P>
Pedroso, the long jump champion in the 1993 and 1995 world
championships, said he also fixes his eyes on the nine meter
barrier in the nine-day sports gala to be open late Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban had boasted before the two previous championships
that he could become the first human in the world to break the
nine-meter barrier.
</P>
<P>
"Nine meters? That's my overwhelming objective before anything
else," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I want to be the first person to go that far. This year I have
had to take a lot of care, and I have competed very sparingly,
because I have been carrying an injury. "
</P>
<P>
The current world mark of 8.95 meters to the American was set
by American Mike Powell in the 1991 world championships in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
"In my last competition I was suffering from a slight strain
and I hope that is not going to hinder me in Seville," he said. "I
have recovered well and maybe my moment has arrived."
</P>
<P>
Pedros, despite the injury, is still ranked first in the world
can has a season-best 8.60 meters in Padua, Italy, on June 26.

<P>
What needs to be pointed out, Zhu said, is that including
Taiwan in the TMD in any way by any country is a violation of
Chinese sovereignty and a serious threat to China's national
security and something that will certainly encourage the
independence of Taiwan and put a barrier in the way of China's
peaceful reunification and affect the peace and stability of the
Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the Chinese government has repeatedly
stated China's principled stand on the TMD issue to the U.S.
government and it demands that the U.S. uphold its commitment to
the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques and clearly understand the
seriousness and danger of Lee's "two states" remarks and halt arms
sales to Taiwan, and, especially, commit itself not to providing
TMD and relevant technology and equipment so as not to destroy the
peace and stability in the Taiwan straits and the region and not
to damage Sino-U.S. relations, he said.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Vows to Change Charter Despite Protest Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada vowed at a Manila gathering Friday afternoon to continue
his charter change efforts despite a massive protest rally staged
simultaneously in the capital city.
</P>
<P>
"We need to adjust our constitution with global realities, for
the present constitution that we have was framed in a different
time, where the economy of nations was based on protectionism and
where competition was not as intense as today," President Estrada
said at a gathering in the Rizal Park.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of Filipinos attended the rally to celebrate
the 15th anniversary of Catholic preacher Mariano Velarde's El
Shaddai religious group.
</P>
<P>
Under the present Philippine constitution, foreign investors
can not own land, and can not own up to 40 percent of Philippine
industry.
</P>
<P>
"The issue here is not the extension of the term limits of the
president or of any other elected official, but the reform of the
constitution and the economic system that we now have. This is
also not about a shift to a parliamentary form of government,"
said the president.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Estrada also denied any plan to extend his own
six-year term in office by changing the charter.
</P>
<P>
Estrada appealed for a sober and mature discussion of the
relevant issues in the proposed constitutional amendments, which,
he said, would help open up the country to overseas capital to
allow the economy to modernize.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, despite torrential rains in Manila, about 75,000
Filipinos gathered in the city's Makati Business Center Friday
afternoon to protest the government's proposal of amending the
1987 constitution.
</P>
<P>
Those attending the protest rally, led by former president
Corazon Aquino and top Roman Catholic church prelate cardinal
Jaime Sin, included Aquino's followers, Catholics and others from
different social sectors.
</P>
<P>
Both rally organizers addressed the crowd, blasting the
proposed charter change outlined by President Estrada which was
claimed to attract investment by allowing foreigners to own land
and have greater ownership in Philippine industries.
</P>
<P>
Aquino said: "The issue is not whether to remove the provisions
of the constitution. The issue is whether these are all we stand
to lose or, we may well ask, will cherished rights and liberties
be lost as well?"
</P>
<P>
Cardinal Sin blasted the Estrada government for "corruption"
and warned it will bring the country to economic ruin.
</P>
<P>
"Constitutional constraints are not the cause of our economic
problems," the church leader said, wearing a yellow raincoat to
protect him from the heavy rain.
</P>
<P>
The protest rally is the largest one since Estrada came to
office in July 1998.
</P>
<P>
Threats from the rebels to bomb the rally in Manila have
prompted police and military officials to put their troops on
alert in the capital city.
</P>
<P>
According to local press reports, 150,000 people rallied in
several cities in the country Friday afternoon in protest against
the proposed charter change.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Travel and tourism executives
and officials from the 10 members of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) will be meeting in Bangkok early next year
for the ASEAN Tourism Forum, Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT)
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The forum, to be the first great travel show of the 21st
century in the region, will mark the first time that people from
the tourism industries of all the Southeast Asian countries get
together since Cambodia was accepted as the 10th member of ASEAN
in April this year.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN tourism industry strives to promote the region as a
single destination through numerous promotion and marketing
campaigns designed to build the "brand-image."
</P>
<P>
More than 1,500 sellers of ASEAN tourism products will meet
with buyers from all over the world at the travel trade
exhibition, which will be accompanied by the meetings of the ASEAN
tourism ministers as well as the annual conference of the ASEAN
Tourism Association.
</P>
<P>
The forum is also intended to create conditions for more
tourism growth within the ASEAN region by setting the theme of the
forum as "Towards Seamless Intro-ASEAN Travel."
</P>
<P>
"Thailand's accessibility, modern infrastructure and
world-famous hospitality will assist ASEAN's efforts to showcase
the best of the region's tourism potential in a century when
significant changes in the industry are certain to make
international and intra-regional travel easier than ever before,"
TAT, the state-run agency, said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
Tourism agencies of ASEAN members have recognized that there
are major linkages between tourism and transport, convertibility
of currencies and regional trade liberalization, which will give
greater impetus to the entire concept of promoting intro-ASEAN
travel, the release said.

ISLAMABAD, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations is
"worried" over the involvement of students under age in the
current Afghan fighting, U.N. officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a news briefing here at the U.N. Information Center,
UNICEF representative for Afghanistan Louis-Georges Arsenault said
that "a very large number of students between the age of 15 and 35
are involved in fighting in Afghanistan."
</P>
<P>
But he sidestepped questions about the exact number of young
children involved in Afghan fighting, saying only that between
2,000 to 2,500 Afghan and Pakistani students have recently gone to
Afghanistan from religious schools in the North-West Frontier
Province of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"The progress has been going on for sometime and we are worried
it is increasing," Arsenault said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan expressed
"deep concern" over reports of the involvement in the conflict of
students, some as young as 14.

<P>
JERUSALEM, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Motorola Company, world
communications giant, has threatened to transfer an Israel-based
research and development facility outside the country if a
proposed reform to increase the interest rates on capital-aid
assistance receives government approval.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post quoted Hanan Achsaf, president of Motorola
company in Israel, as saying Friday that the proposed reform would
mean that a significant portion of Motorola's imports to and
exports from Israel would be shifted to other countries.
</P>
<P>
Motorola currently conducts 50 million U.S. dollars worth of
research and development in Israel, 12 million dollars of which is
provided by Israeli Industry and Trade Ministry's Chief
Scientist's Office.
</P>
<P>
One of the reforms that will be proposed by Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and the Finance Ministry to the cabinet Sunday is to
restructure the government's research and development funding,
whereby recipients of government grants would have to increase
the payments they return at a higher interest rate on profitable
investments.
</P>
<P>
A senior Treasury official emphasized that this will not
diminish the sum that the government invests in the field of
research and development, some 1.6 billion shekels (about 400
million dollars) annually.
</P>
<P>
But the Chief Scientist's Office, which is responsible for
the vast majority of government research and development funding,
is opposed to the proposal.
</P>
<P>
"Israel's relative advantage is in its research and development
capabilities," said an official from the Chief Scientist's
Office. Any decrease in the government's assistance will make it
much less attractive for foreign companies to stay here," she
said.

<HEADLINE> SADC Senior Official Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOPUTO, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Kaire Mbuende, executive
secretary of the Southern African Development Community (SADC),
has resigned for alleged mal-function, the Mozambican newspaper
Noticias reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano, also
newly-elected chairman of the SADC, said the executive secretary
had proposed to be replaced sometime, but Chissano did not give
further details about it.
</P>
<P>
However, the SADC chairman admitted that Mbuende had an uneasy
 relationship with "some elements" of the Council of Ministers.
</P>
<P>
Measures would be taken to reform the regional organization and
improve the performance of the SADC Secretariat, Chissano
stressed.
</P>
<P>
It was not known who would take the place of Mbuende. But
reportedly, both Angola and Zimbabwe have an eye on the post.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Savana, a Mozambican weekly newspaper,said Friday
that Mbuende was not favored at his home in Namibia.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that Mbuende had a close relationship with an
unidentified former Namibian ambassador to Britain, who set up a
new political party recently.
</P>
<P>
The party stands up to challenge the South West African
People's Organization (SWAPO), the Namibian ruling party led by
Namibian President Sam Nujoma, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma, who is now SADC deputy chairman, said early in 1997
that he was in favor of renovating the mandate of Mbuende, the
weekly said.
</P>
<P>
it was the time for Nujoma to deliver his political promise,
the paper added.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Protests to U.N. over U.S.-British Raids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has protested to
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan and Security Council over the
recent U.S.-British raids of a solar eclipse-observing camp and
grain warehouses.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf said in his
two letters sent to Annan and the council that U.S. and British
warplanes carried out savage aggression on Iraq recently, the
Iraqi News Agency reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The aggression targetted Monastery of Marmetti, north of
Mosul, where the camp for observing the solar eclipse was set,"
al-Sahhaf wrote in the letter.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and British warplanes also targetted grain warehouses in
the southern province of Muthana, added al-Sahhaf.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf affirmed that the area which was recently hit by the
aggression is well known to be void of any military target and
there are only food warehouses there.
</P>
<P>
He said the criminal acts carried out by two permanent member
states in the Security Council against Iraq's civil facilities are
totally contradicting the U.N. Charter and the international law.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf demanded that Annan and the council condemn this
savage aggression and intervene to stop such criminal acts, which
he said have become a firm policy to those two states to achieve
political objectives.
</P>
<P>
Iraq held all states involved in the raids, including Saudi
Arabia, Kuwait and Turkey from which the U.S. and British
warplanes took off, responsible for such aggressive acts and the
damage inflicted on Iraqi facilities, said the foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
He affirmed Iraq's legal right to ask for compensation for the
material and moral damage Iraq has sustained in the hostile acts.

KUALA LUMPUR, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's Selangor State
government will explore the possibility of investing in Peru's
agriculture sector, especially in oil palm cultivation, State
Chief Minister Abu Hassan Omar said Friday.
</P>
<P>
As Peru has the same climatic conditions as that of Malaysia,
there is a good potential for the local plantation sector to
venture into the area in that country, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I see it as a very good potential sector for investment and
will ask the Selangor Agriculture Development Corporation to look
into it," he was quoted by the Bernama news agency as saying at a
media conference after meeting Peruvian Ambassador Javier Gonzales
Terrones in Shah Alam, some 25 kilometers west from here.
</P>
<P>
Abu Hassan said that from his discussions with the ambassador,
he came to know that there was a good market for palm oil products

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Second Bridge to Link Singapore to Take off Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 20 (Xinhua) -- A consortium of three
Malaysian firms is expected to start next year the construction of
the proposed second bridge replacing the Johor Causeway between
Malaysia and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The proposed 1.5 kilometer-long bridge will enable ships and
boats to use freely the Johore Straits which is now obstructed by
the 1.2 kilometer-long Johor Causeway built in 1923.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the bridge at a cost 1.5 billion ringgit
(about 395 million U.S. dollars), which is yet to receive the
greenlight from the Singapore government, will initially involve
ground works including road building on the Malaysian side,
Malaysia's Transwater Corporation's group executive director Kong
Keng Ling said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The bridge development project, including the building of the
Customs, Immigration and Quarantine Complex, is expected to be
carried out over a period of three years, he said at a press
conference in Petaling Jaya near here.
</P>
<P>
To a question on whether Singapore is agreeable to the project,
he said negotiations were ongoing on a government to government
basis and a preliminary reference on the project has been sent to
the Singapore government.
</P>
<P>
Transwater, whose subsidiary Detik Nagasari has a 20 percent
stake in the consortium, is confident that the project will go on
as scheduled, he said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's Johor state government was reported to have
identified 280-320 hectares of land in Tanjung Puteri adjacent to
the Johor Causeway to be reclaimed for the project.
</P>
<P>
The first bridge linking Malaysia and Singapore was opened to
traffic last year.

<P>
BEIJING, August 20 (Xinhua) -- China United Telecommunications
(China Unicom) and Hebei United Telecommunication Engineering Co.
Ltd recently agreed to stop cooperation on the Hebei GSM network
project.
</P>
<P>
China Unicom, set up in 1994, is China's second largest
telecommunications firm. Hebei United Telecommunications
Engineering Co. Ltd was formed by NTTi company and Itochu
corporation of Japan and Hebei United Telecommunications Equipment
Co. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
The "China-China-Foreign" method that was used by China Unicom
over the past four years as a channel to raise a billion U.S.
dollars worth of foreign funds, did not, according to the Chinese
government, comply with Chinese laws and regulations and needed to
be corrected.
</P>
<P>
Yang Xianzu, the chairman of the board of directors of China
Unicom, says that the end of the Hebei project is an example of
how to resolve other Unicom finance projects and is merely meant
to correct an irregular financing arrangement and does not mean
the termination of cooperation between China Unicom and foreign
investors and could create a basis for cooperation in future.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Wants to Establish Indigenous IT Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 20 (Xinhua) -- A Senior Malaysian official
urged Friday the local information technology (IT) companies to
establish indigenous creative IT industry that can generate
products and services for local and foreign markets.
</P>
<P>
Speaking here at the launch of the MCSB Systems Regional Help
Desk, an IT service provider, Malaysian Energy, Communications and
Multimedia Minister Leo Moggie said the establishment of such
industry is crucial in spurring the success of the Multimedia
Super Corridor (MSC).
</P>
<P>
MSC is a hi-tech zone stretching southwards from Kuala Lumpur
to Sepang where new Kuala Lumpur International airport is located.
</P>
<P>
There are many Malaysian IT companies in the zone with great
talents, ideas and creativity, looking to position themselves
globally and the government wants to encourage these companies to
be bold and spread their wings by leveraging the opportunities in
the digital economy, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Leo Moggie said there is vibrancy and a positive scope for
rapid expansion of the IT industry in the country as the economy
picks up due to the efforts that have been put in place to revive
the economy.
</P>
<P>
"Among the factors expected to boost IT spending in the country
are preparations to address the Y2K problem and the rise of the
Internet commerce market which is expected to exceed 5 billion
ringgit (1.315 billion U.S. dollars) in the year 2003," the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said he was encouraged with the response by
Malaysian talents towards the creation of technopreneurs in the
country especially those who have successfully developed their own
niche in the IT and multimedia market.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysians should also look towards mastering existing
technologies through development of specific leading-edge IT-based
solutions that support the growing diversity of the industry.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, currently there are 1,500 to 2,000
IT companies in Malaysia.

<HEADLINE> Obasanjo Advocates Reform of UN, World Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 20 (Xinhua) -- President Olusegun Obasanjo
Thursday advocated a restructuring of the United Nations and
world financial bodies to make them more representative of the
world's population, reported the Guardian, a leading Nigerian
newspaper Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the public presentation of the UN's Human
Development Report on Nigeria in Abuja Thursday, he said: "Global
institutions must demonstrate a sense of responsibility towards
people's notion of equity and social justice."
</P>
<P>
According to him: "The United Nations, World Bank,
International Monetary Fund and World Trade Organization must be
restructured to make them more responsive to and more
representative of the people," adding that,
</P>
<P>
"There is an urgent need for the democratization of global
decision- making institutions."
</P>
<P>
He said the world's wealthy minority and powerful multinational
 corporations had a responsibility to "demonstrate a new
responsiveness to the needs of the people" of the planet. This is
more so when we realize that the three richest individuals in the
world have total assets that is more than the gross national
product of all the least developed countries with a total
population of 600 million people.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, while receiving a 10-man UNDP delegation in the State
House, President Obasanjo canvassed for its assistance to reduce
the country's poverty cycle. He said Nigerians were expecting to
reap the dividend of democracy through improved facilities such
as water supply, sufficient food,
</P>
<P>
better health services and shelter.
</P>
<P>
President Obasanjo said his administration's first task has
been to ensure political stability and harmony in the country as
a basis for the implementation of its development programs.
</P>
<P>
He added that his administration would take definite steps to
raise the standard of living of citizens and assured the UNDP
technical team expected in the country next month of Nigeria's
full co-operation.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, he said, wanted the UNDP technical team to assist in
the areas of rural water supply, rural electrification, primary
education and basic health care. These projects, the president
said, would positively affect more Nigerians than projects
concentrated in the cities where more facilities already abound.
</P>
<P>
The leader of the UNDP mission, Dr. Zephirim Diabre, associate
 administrator of UNDP, said the world body was glad to return to
Nigeria on a full time basis to assist the government.
</P>
<P>
UNDP, he said, was already discussing with donor countries
about funding development projects in the country.
</P>
<P>
Nigerians became poorer in 1998 and the country fell four
places to rank 146th on the 174-country UN human development
index, the UN Human Development Report said.
</P>
<P>
"Poverty in Nigeria is on the increase despite the country's
position" as a major oil exporter, it said, adding: "Nigeria
fared badly on the ranking of countries based on their human
development. It dipped further down from its ranking of 142nd in
last year's report to place 146th out of 174 countries.
</P>
<P>
"And of 90 developing countries, Nigeria is placed 63rd on the
human poverty index, with Barbados coming first and Sierra Leone
last."
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, the report said, is a "rich country with a poor
population - the poorest and most deprived in OPEC."

<HEADLINE> Iraq to Send Oil to Quake-Battered Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi government has decided to
transfer oil to quake-hit Turkey and send a medical team to help
treat the injured.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting chaired by President Saddam Hussein on
Thursday evening, the cabinet expressed deep sorrow for its
northern neighbor Turkey which was hit by an earthquake on Tuesday
that killed over 7,000 people and injured nearly 30,000 others.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet said that Iraq was prepared to pump oil to Turkey
to a greater value than aid provided by the U.S. in disaster
relief, the Iraqi News Agency INA reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to pump oil through the Iraqi-Turkish pipeline
at greater value than the assistance presented by the U.S. to
Turkey on the earthquake incident," a statement issued by the
cabinet said.
</P>
<P>
"We are also ready to send a medical team with various
specializations to contribute to salvaging and treating
casualties," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral relations between Iraq and Turkey have remained
cold since the 1991 Gulf War in which Turkey sided with the
U.S.-led allied forces. The Gulf war was sparked by Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has long urged Turkey to stop allowing U.S. and British
warplanes to use its territories to patrol the no-fly zone in
northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The northern no-fly zone was imposed on Iraq by the U.S.-led
western allies following the Gulf War with a claimed aim of
protecting the Iraqi Kurds there against possible attacks by Iraqi
government troops.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has also demanded an end to Turkish troops' frequent
incursion into northern Iraq to chase Turkish Kurdish Workers'
Party rebels, who have been fighting a guerrilla for an
independent state in southeastern Turkey.

<HEADLINE> 8,000 Killed in Earthquake in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISTANBUL, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Some 8,000 people have been
found dead so far since Tuesday's killer earthquake shook
northwestern Turkey, Turkish television reported Friday noon.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's NTV, a popular private news channel covering the
quake around the clock, said mid-Friday that 7,850 bodies had
already been recovered from crushed buildings razed to the
ground in the powerful quake.
</P>
<P>
Over 30,000 people had been reported as injured, NTV said,
adding that nearly 10,000 people were still on the missing
list.
</P>
<P>
In Istanbul, the largest metropolis of Turkey, 984 people
have been confirmed dead and over 9,000 were injured, NTV
said.
</P>
<P>
Counts of casualties vary with different sources. Ismail Baris,
mayor of Golcuk, one of the hardest hit area, estimated as many
as 10,000 were still trapped under debris in his navy town alone,
according to Friday's Turkish Daily News.
</P>
<P>
As rescue and medical teams from Turkey and foreign countries
began reaching suburbs of cities or rural areas, which were
previously -- some are still -- cut off from communication with
outside, the numbers of death toll, injuries as well as missing
seemed certain to grow.
</P>
<P>
Turkish government sources said they feared the toll would
exceed 14,000 as hopes of finding more survivors from under the
mountains of rubble was fading by the hours now that three days had
passed since the disastrous tremors devastated highly-populated
northwestern Turkey at 3:02 a.m. (0002 GMT) Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Rescue workers also said most of those trapped in the wreckage
may have perished due to lack of water in the hot weather.

<HEADLINE> Military Leader Underlines Overall Combat Effectiveness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Fu Quanyou, chief of the general
staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) and a member
of the Central Military Commission, has viewed military exercises
in the Lanzhou War Zone in northwestern China recently, a military
source said today.
</P>
<P>
He was reported as saying that the Chinese military forces need
to understand both the importance and urgency of military training
and to use it as a major way to ensure their readiness.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the three generations of Chinese Party leaders
have always paid close attention to developing the country's
combat forces and to the training of all branches of the armed
services.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin has issued instructions on improving the
training of all branches of the armed services to further increase
the military's overall ability to maneuver and old ways of
thinking need to be changed and the system of command and
combating methods made more flexible and combat strength improved,
Fu said.
</P>
<P>
To achieve those goals, Fu said, the Chinese military forces
need to improve their military theory, provide new standards for
training, and make full use of their existing facilities and funds.

The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak expressed hope on Thursday
that U.S. President Bill Clinton's objections to moving the U.S.
embassy to Jerusalem will not last beyond February 15, 2000,
when Israel will know whether it has an outline for a final
deal on the disposition of the territories with the
Palestinians. Barak said that in the event a declaration of
principles with the Palestinians on a final-status deal is not

to move the embassy.

<P>
Haaretz:

Smyrek, a 28-year-old German citizen, to 10 years in prison,

against Israel, conspiring to transmit information to an ememy

the militant group Hizbollah.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv

<HEADLINE> Somali Bandits Gunned Down in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Three armed Somali bandits had
been shot dead by the Kenyan security forces in Lamu District,
Coast Province in eastern Kenya, the East African Standard
newspaper said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Somali bandits were chased and gunned down on the spot
Thursday after they robbed the house of a prominent businessman in
the district, according to the security officers.
</P>
<P>
Lamu District Commissioner Wilson Wanyanga said during the
incident, the bandits got away with foodstuffs, kitchenware,
clothings and some money.
</P>
<P>
The police officers recovered two assault rifles, 105 rounds of
 ammunition, four radio cassettes and other stolen goods.
</P>
<P>
Wanyanga noted that the slain gangsters were notorious bandits
who had been terrorizing several parts of the district, saying
they were known for attacking and hijacking vehicles and their
death would bring a decrease in bandit incidents.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner said security officers would undertake similar
 operations to eradicate thuggery and improve the security of
residents in the district.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the public to volunteer information on suspected
bandits in the area so that immediate action could be taken by the
police.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Shoring Up Chinese Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 20 (Xinhua)-- Bond sales have played a
significant role in China's economy and more bond issues are in
the pipeline to prime the economic pump, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
China issued 100 billion yuan (about 12 billion U.S. dollars)
worth of bonds last year to offset the effects of the Asian
financial meltdown and expand domestic market demand. The money
raised went to water conservation, forestry, transport,
telecommunications, infrastructure, rural power grid, grain
storage, and housing projects.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that the money contributed 1.5 percentage points
to the gross domestic product (GDP) and was still helping in the
first half of the year. The bonds also proved crucial in this year
's anti-flood efforts.
</P>
<P>
The State Development Planning Commission (SDPC) says that by
the end of June, 6,200 km. of dams and levees along major rivers
and lakes had been repaired and dredging of rivers in dangerous
spots completed.
</P>
<P>
Bond issues have been important in helping build and improve
power grids in 2,300 counties. Out of 180 billion yuan (about 21.7
billion dollars) spent, 20 percent came from money raided in bond
issues.
</P>
<P>
Tang Baifei, who is in charge of grain regulations at the SDPC,
says that 17.9 billion yuan (about 2.1 billion dollars) from bond
issues has been earmarked for granaries and by the end of August,
construction work on 340 will be completed, in time for harvests.
</P>
<P>
Wu Jinglian, a senior economist, says that China's bond issues
account for less than ten percent of the GDP. He expects no
financial risks in issuing so many bonds for another year or two.

<HEADLINE> HK Exhibition to Unveil Mystery Kingdom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 20 (Xinhua) -- From October onwards, the Hong
Kong Museum of Art will stage a large-scale exhibition featuring
the historical relics and exquisite artifacts of a virtually
unknown ancient Chinese state -- Zhongshan.
</P>
<P>
Zhongshan, previously known as "the mystery kingdom", was a
powerful state established by an ethnic minority, the Xianyu
people of north China, in the Warring States period (475 - 221 BC).
It bordered the other three powerful states of Zhao, Yan and Qi
and struggled for many years to hold its own kingdom among the
major contending states of China's central plains.
</P>
<P>
Spanning for about 360 years from the establishment of the
state to its demise, Zhongshan occupied a position to be reckoned
with in the Warring States period. However, due to a paucity of
references in historical texts, information on the state of
Zhongshan had in the past been limited to fragments of data. It
was not until the 1970s when archaeological excavations unearthed
large numbers of burial objects from several Zhongshan royal tombs
that the mystery surrounding the state was unveiled.
</P>
<P>
These valuable relics will be on loan from the Hebei Provincial
Museum to the Hong Kong Museum of Art and shown in an exhibition
entitled "Warring States Treasures -- Cultural Relics from the
State of Zhongshan, Hebei Province" from October 1, 1999 to
January 9, 2000.
</P>
<P>
"The Zhongshan tombs, located at Sanji village, Pingshan county,
Hebei province, yielded large numbers of precious relics rich in
regional characteristics. Unique in form, sumptuous in decoration
and meticulous in workmanship, the relics are of a class seldom
encountered in Warring States period tombs," said Gerard Tsang,
the chief curator of the museum.
</P>
<P>
"The 102 exhibits selected are the most representative of the
finds. They include a majority of bronzes and numbers of jade,
stone and ceramics, constituting the very best of the Zhongshan
holdings in the Hebei Provincial Museum," Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
"Of particular importance are the two exquisite bronze vases
with long inscriptions, which provide information on the lineage
of Zhongshan rulers and fill gaps in the historical record," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Other highlights will be two vases of wine over 2000 years old,
a complete set of nine bronze ritual tripods and 14 bronze bells,
a bronze lamp with 15 oil trays, jade figurines and pendants, and
a stone chessboard. These exhibits will reveal the superb
craftsmanship of a northern nomadic culture as well as daily life
and customs of the Warring States period.
</P>
<P>
Tsang said the exhibits were of high artistic merit and
historical value that would attract universal attention to the
scantily recorded state.
</P>
<P>
Jointly presented by the Provisional Urban Council, the Art
Exhibitions China and the Cultural Bureau of Hebei Province, the
exhibition is a major event to celebrate the new millennium and
also a Spotlight Hong Kong Event supported by the Hong Kong
Tourist Association.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Britain Intentionally Kill Civilians in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, August 20 (Xinhua) -- A newspaper published in the
United Arab Emirates (UAE) Friday accused the U.S. and Britain of
intentionally killing civilians in Iraq through air raids over the
"no-fly zones."
</P>
<P>
American and British pilots always claim to have "mistaken"
babies, women and old men for legitimate targets such as
missiles, batteries and mortar tanks, which acturally have great
difference, said the local paper Sharjah-based Al Khaleej.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that innocent civilians are always victimized in the
continuous air raids showed that the pilots have been programed to
strike human targets than military ones," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the great advancement of modern warfare technology,
notably the laser guided bombs that are expected to strike
exactly their assigned targets, thousands of Iraqi civilians
continue to be killed and maimed by the American-British air
strikes over and beyond the "no-fly zones."
</P>
<P>
"Despite the various excuses by Washington, which is trying to
shove the blame on to the Iraqi regime, nobody believes that the
22 innocent Iraqi civilians who lost their lives on Wednesday as a
result of the raid were victims of a mistake," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The 22 victims included 12 members of an Iraqi family, reports
said.
</P>
<P>
The death toll from U.S.-British air raids on Iraq has
surpassed the one that could be yielded by the weapons of mass
destruction that Washington is trying to stop Iraq, or rather,
Arabs in general, from possessing, the paper added.
</P>
<P>
The alarming rise in the death rate of Iraqi children "is a
natural result to expect from legalizing the violation of the
sovereign rights of a country and its people," the paper added.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and British warplanes have regularly struck the no-fly
zones in northern and southern Iraq, which were imposed by the
U.S.-led western allies after the 1991 Gulf war with a claimed aim
of protecting the kurds in the north and Shiite Muslims in the
south from "Baghdad's suppression."

<HEADLINE> Namibia Unhappy With U.S. Comments on Caprivi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 20 (Xinhua) -- A row has erupted between
Namibia and the United States after the U.S. embassy to the
country expressed concern over heavy- handed security in Caprivi,
Namibia, but did not condemn the secessionist attacks.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's Business Day daily reported Friday that the U.S.
embassy has urged Namibian government forces to desist from these
abuses and to respect the civil rights guaranteed to all citizens
under the Namibian constitution.
</P>
<P>
Namibia responded angrily, telling the U.S. that it was
interfering in the country's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Namibia also called on the U.S. to use established diplomatic
channels to raise its concerns with government.
</P>
<P>
The Namibian Foreign Ministry said it objects to foreign
diplomats whose governments did not condemn the terrorist attacks
but made public statements criticizing the actions of the security
forces.
</P>
<P>
It said "the government of Namibia is irrevocably committed to
the rule of law, protection of human rights and above all the
territorial integrity and unity of our country.
</P>
<P>
"While we have nothing to hide, we resent unprofessional
behavior by some diplomatic missions which have the effect of
giving moral encouragement and comfort to the terrorists," the
ministry added.
</P>
<P>
A group of secessionist rebels attacked Katima Mulilo, the
major town in remote Caprivi Strip, at the beginning of the month.
At least 13 people were killed in skirmishes.

<HEADLINE> Filipinos Stage Protest Against Charter Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Some 20,000 to 30,000 Filipinos
gathered in Makati, Manila Friday afternoon to protest the
Philippine government's proposal of amending the 1987
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Those attending the protest rally, led by former president
Corazon Aquino and top Roman Catholic church prelate cardinal
Jaime Sin, included Aquino's followers, Catholics and others from
different social sectors.
</P>
<P>
Both rally organizers addressed the crowd, blasting the
proposed charter change outlined by President Joseph Estrada which
was claimed to attract investment by allowing foreigners to own
land and have greater ownership in Philippine industries.
</P>
<P>
Aquino said, "The issue is not whether to remove the provisions
of the constitution. The issue is whether these are all we stand
to lose or, we may well ask, will cherished rights and liberties
be lost as well?"
</P>
<P>
Cardinal Sin blasted the Estrada government for "corruption"
and warned it will bring the country to economic ruin.
</P>
<P>
"Constitutional constraints are not the cause of our economic
problems," the church leader said, wearing a yellow raincoat to
protect him from the heavy rain.
</P>
<P>
The church organized the rally to attack Estrada's plans to
change the constitution, which the president said is a barrier to
foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Estrada insists that the amendments would help open up the
country to overseas capital to allow the economy to modernize.
</P>
<P>
Under the present Constitution, foreign investors can not own
land, and can not own up to 40 percent of Philippine industry.
</P>
<P>
The president said this may hamper the country's progress as
the country lacks funds to bankroll its programs in key sectors
such as telecommunications, transport and power.
</P>
<P>
Estrada stressed that all he wants to do is to open up the
nation's economy, which is lagging behind its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
He denied any plans to extend his own six-year term in office
by changing the charter.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said there could be 40,000 to 50,000 people
attending the rally, but the number of protesters turned out to be
smaller due to the heavy rain.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, tens of thousands of Filipinos are also gathering in
the city's Rizal Park to celebrate the 15th anniversary of
Catholic preacher Mariano Velarde's El Shaddai religious group.
</P>
<P>
Reports said groups opposing the charter change held
simultaneous protest rallies in at least nine major cities.
</P>
<P>
Threats from the rebels of the New People's Army to bomb the
rally have prompted police and military officials to put their
troops on alert around Manila.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government has given heads of school and private
offices directions to suspend classes and work in Manila on
Friday.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Housing Reform Plan For State Institutions (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 20 (Xinhua) -- A detailed housing reform plan
for Chinese Central Government departments and institutions in
Beijing was released here today, mainly for commercializing
housing and stopping the use of housing as a form of welfare.
</P>
<P>
Central Government departments and institutions are expected to
stop the allocation of housing built since the end of 1998 as a
form of welfare, said Liu Zhifeng, Vice Minister of Construction.
</P>
<P>
He said new apartments and older publicly-owned housing will in
principle be sold to employees instead of being rented to them.
</P>
<P>
Employees will have to purchase their own housing by using
subsidies, public housing funds, or loans. People living in
poverty can still qualify for government housing rental.
</P>
<P>
People without housing or living in sub-standard housing can
apply for housing subsidies based on length of work prior to the
establishment of the public accumulative housing fund system. (

Reduced-rent housing is mainly from older publicly-owned

for it and publish the prices at regular intervals. Tenants whose
earnings are above the government minimum will have to move out of
reduced-rent housing.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said this morning that this China trip, his fifth,
has been fruitful and that a common understanding on Sino-
Malaysian ties and other issues was reached.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir told a press conference at the end of his three-day
visit this morning that they discussed cooperation in all fields
in his meetings with Chinese leaders and that both countries are
willing to promote cooperation and exchanges.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin and Premier Zhu Rongji had separate
meetings with Mahathir and some cooperative agreements were also
signed.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that the Asian economy is recovering and that the
economy of Southeast Asia and East Asia will recover but not as
fast as in the past and the recovery in the short term will not
make things as good as they used to be. It is going to be a long
time before the Asian economies are fully recovered, he said.
</P>
<P>
People have to be more circumspect about globalization and the
free flow of capital across borders, he said, pointing out that
these new ideas provide a lot of opportunities for speculators to
take advantage of weak economies.
</P>
<P>
On human rights, he said that abuses can be found everywhere,
not only in Asia, and that people who have a tendency to look at
others should look at themselves first.

<HEADLINE> Dead Sea Quake Predicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 20 (Xinhua) -- A possible powerful quake in
10 to 20 years in the northern part of the Dead Sea will damage
about 20 percent of the buildings in Jerusalem, an earthquake
researcher has said.
</P>
<P>
A new study by Ron Avni, a researcher of earthquakes in
Israel's Ben-Gurion University said that he had studied the
earthquake that rocked the Dead Sea in 1927, in which 300 people
were killed, predicting that the next quake in the region will
occur within 10 to 20 years, the local daily Haaretz reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem, which is the holy city for Christianity, Islam and
Judaism, is just some 25 kilometers west to the Dead Sea.
</P>
<P>
"According to past experience, an earthquake above 6 on the
Richter scale occurs in the Dead Sea region once every 100
years," Avni says. "The last one was in 1927, the one before that
in 1837 and before that in 1759."
</P>
<P>
He predicts that the next earthquake around the Dead Sea will
be "at least 6.2 on the Richter scale."
</P>
<P>
A simulation conducted during the study showed that the targets
of major damage in Jerusalem would be old, poorly constructed
buildings from the beginning of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
About 50 percent of the poorly constructed buildings would
sustain heavy damage, with 5 percent of them likely to collapse
entirely.
</P>
<P>
About 11 percent of newer buildings of low or intermediate
quality would also suffer, as would 6 percent of new buildings of
high quality.

<TEXT>
<P>
It says the cult was "a malignant tumor on the society and a
scourge of the nation" and the struggle against it is crucial to
the future of the country and the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
The first effect was when the founder of Falun Gong, Li Hongzhi,
got practitioners to gather illegally and create disturbances, it
jeopardized social order. By building a well-organized network
nationwide, Li and the key members of the cult used innocent
people as tools for their illegal political activities.
</P>
<P>
The article cites facts and figures and accuses Falun Gong of
controlling practitioners through various tactics and destroying
both their physical and mental health.
</P>
<P>
In trying to create confusions among the people and to deify
Falun Gong, Li spread many malicious fallacies such as the "
doomsday" falsehood about the earth blowing up and about the
disability of science and technology and the government in solving
problems of the mankind. Li said only his cult could save the
mankind from catastrophes.
</P>
<P>
Although Li had no real understanding of science, he used many
scientific terms to sell his fallacies to hoodwink ordinary people.
These pseudoscientific ideas prevented practitioners from
understanding science and opposed the government policy of
invigorating the nation through science and education, the article
says.

He appropriated Buddhist terms but Falun Gong had nothing to do
with Buddhism or any other kind of religion. Li violated the
freedom in religious belief in China by keeping all practitioners
from having any other religious belief.
</P>
<P>
Even more seriously, Falun Gong's tentacles reached into the
Communist Party and the government organs and turned some
officials into cult members in order to obtain state secrets, the
article says.
</P>
<P>
One important reason Falun Gong spread so rapidly across the
country was that it took advantage of the influence of some
officials and Party members who became Li's followers, it says,
concluding that this malignant tumor and scourge must be removed.

<HEADLINE> Hope Dims for Restarting Israeli-Syrian Talks: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Sources close to the Syrian
and U.S. governments expressed skepticism that the Syrian-Israeli
talks can start anew during the coming visit by U.S. Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright to the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Hope for a quick resumption of the talks between the two sides
are dimming as Albright is preparing her trip to the region, which
starts on September 1, the local Jerusalem Post reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report also quoted U.S. officials and other American
sources as saying that Albright's trip will instead focus on
narrowing differences between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The tentative schedule for the trip, which originally was
designed to include more extensive discussions, now reflects lack
of focus on Damascus, the report stressed.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks between Syrian and Israel have been stalled
since early 1996.
</P>
<P>
Given the chilly signals from Syrian President Hafez Assad in a
letter to U.S. President Bill Clinton last week, Albright is
planning to spend only one day in Damascus on September 4.
</P>
<P>
There is also no preparatory visit by Albright's aides to
Damascus, or by Syrian officials to Washington, to pave the way
for a successful visit, the report noted.
</P>
<P>
Unlike her predecessor, Warren Christopher, who made 26 trips
to Syria in search for a breakthrough, Albright has made only
one perfunctory visit during her two-and-a-half-year tenure.
</P>
<P>
"All signs are that the Albright visit will not be
serious. The U.S. is not focusing on this issue sufficiently, "
the report quoted one source close to the Syrian government as
saying.
</P>
<P>
An American source familiar with Clinton administration
thinking said that there is no expectation for a resumption of
talks on the Syrian track during Albright's visit.
</P>
<P>
The hopes of Syrian-Israeli talks resumption, which surfaced
after Assad praised Barak as genuinely seeking peace in an
interview, dimmed following an exchange of letters between Clinton
and the Syrian leader.
</P>
<P>
According to a source close to the Syrian government, Assad
was hoping that a Clinton letter written just after Barak visit
Washington would include U.S. support for full withdrawal from the
Golan Heights Israel seized from Syria in the 1967 Middle East
war. But Clinton was non-committal, the source added.
</P>
<P>
Assad replied to Clinton that he can not resume peace talks
unless Israel accepts in advance the idea of withdrawal to the
June 4, 1967 lines.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Strives for Newly Industrialized Country </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Kenya set its ambitious goal of
achieving newly industrialized country status by the year 2020 and
eradicating poverty by 2025.
</P>
<P>
Permanent Secretary Mohammed Isahakia made the remarks Thursday
at the opening of the annual projects review symposium held here
by the Kenya Industrial Research Development Institute.
</P>
<P>
The government-run Kenya Times newspaper Friday quoted Isahakia
as saying his ministry had taken necessary steps to ensure that
Kenya is well prepared to make contributions towards the
attainment of their development goals.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the institute has already taken up the challenge
by setting the industrialization pace as a strategy to achieve
rapid economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The permanent secretary called on the institute to play a
leading role in research and development of the appropriate
indigenous industrial technologies and the management of transfer
and acquisition of foreign technologies.
</P>
<P>
Isahakia also cited that the institute has developed instant
sorghum- based weaning food, sweet potato and cassava products and
related processing technologies, exotic leather processing and
many other technologies suitable for adaptation by medium- and
small-scale enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The realization of the objectives, he said, would require
positive contributions from the public, particularly those
involved directly in industry and related supporting agencies.
</P>
<P>
The government is striving for raising the living standards of
Kenyans through increased industrial production and the subsequent
creation of more job opportunities, the permanent secretary added.

<HEADLINE> Three Japanese Banks Announces Large-Scale Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Japan's two major commercial banks,
Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank (DKB) and Fuji Bank, and a long-term credit
bank, the Industrial Bank of Japan (IBJ), announced Friday they
will enter into a large-Scale alliance next fall.
</P>
<P>
The presidents of the three banks announced at a joint press
conference that they will establish a joint holding company as
part of their plan to create a full-scale business alliance.
</P>
<P>
The alliance will create the world's largest banking group with
assets of some 141 trillion yen (about 1.27 trillion dollars),
topping those of Deutsche Bank of Germany, the largest bank in the
world currently, with assets of 735.2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The combined assets of the three banks are also worth more than
double the 69 trillion yen (620 billion dollars) of Japan's
current No. 1 commercial bank, the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi.
</P>
<P>
The three banks will jointly set up a holding company on an
equal footing by the fall of 2000. Under the company, the first to
be created by major Japanese commercial banks, the three banks
will operate on their own initially.
</P>
<P>
By the spring of 2002, the three banks' retail and investment
banking, securities and other services would be integrated and
regrouped into separate entities that will be controlled by the
holding company.
</P>
<P>
DKB President Katsuyuki Sugita will be its president while IBJ
President Masao Nishimura and Fuji Bank President Yoshiro Yamamoto
will become co-chairmen of the holding company.
</P>
<P>
With its establishment, the three banks are expected to shave
some 6,000 jobs to reduce the combined work forces to around 29,
000 and cut 150 branches to some 620.
</P>
<P>
They expect the alliance to help enhance their credit ratings,
improve efficiency by consolidating overlapping business
operations and make themselves more competitive to survive the
rapidly changing business environment.
</P>
<P>
The tripartite alliance would follow the creation of a joint
trust banking unit this spring by DKB and Fuji Bank as well as a
series of business tie-ups among financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
The DKB, the product of a 1971 merger of two commercial banks,
had assets of 52.5 trillion yen (472.8 billion dollars) at the end
of March with some 16,000 employees and 381 outlets worldwide,
including 360 in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Fuji Bank is the core bank of the Fuyo business group with
assets of 46.4 trillion yen (417.9 billion dollars), some 14,000
employees and 340 outlets worldwide, including 318 in Japan.
</P>
<P>
The IBJ had assets of 42.1 trillion yen (379.2 billion dollars)
and 4,700 employees.

<HEADLINE>   Shuttlecock Kickers Plays like Maradona </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By sportswriter Liu Guang
</P>
<P>
LHASA, August 20 (Xinhua)-- The shuttlecock bounds on her face
as if it were tied to a spring. It shoots up and falls on the
tiptoe precisely as if it were gravitated by magnet.
</P>
<P>
The skill is so perfect that former Argentina football star
Diego Maradona came into your mind.
</P>
<P>
Maradona could let the ball bounce on his forehead as many
times as he liked, but she can play the shuttlecock on any parts
of her face as long as she raises her head.
</P>
<P>
Maradona could make the ball jump on his lap and alternate the
ball between his two knees as long as possible, but she can not
only bounce the shuttlecock on and between her laps, but also can
alternate the gadget between her face, laps, feet from time to
time.
</P>
<P>
It was an exhibition event at the sixth national ethnic games
here which invited a shower of applause over and over again.
</P>
<P>
But the fantasy of the shuttlecock kicking is not only limited
to the solo performance. It can be played between two or three
performers as it places more emphasis upon the teamwork.
</P>
<P>
Maradona would pop his eyes if he were on the scene as the
shuttlecock bounds up and down, fro and back between three women
performers from Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Chen Jing, an employee with a Beijing-based computer company,
called the shots as she, together with her other two partners,
played it so proficiently as if they were using hands instead of
legs.
</P>
<P>
"It needs great skill. We just want to make our legs as deft as
our hands," said Chen, who has begun to kick shuttlecock as a
child.
</P>
<P>
"It is a blend of skill and artistry. Every action is expected
to provide the spectators with sense of beauty," added Chen.
</P>
<P>
Chen, together with the other three men shuttlecock kickers,
represented China at the invitation of the International Folklore
Exchange Association to perform in Japan in 1993 and they made a
great success which is out of her expectation.
</P>
<P>
"We performed ten times at as many cities and our performances
were very popular over there. When we performed at Tokyo, the NHK
television of Japan has spared a few minutes to televise it live."
</P>
<P>
But it is not the same case at home, said Chen as she talked
about the Chinese traditional ethnic event which has dated back to
1800 years ago.
</P>
<P>
"Since it needs great skill, it demands painstaking efforts to
learn it. But nowadays children are more willing to take something
which is easy to learn and easy to make name such as piano."
</P>
<P>
Chen showed her concern about if the tradition can be inherited
from generation to generation.
</P>
<P>
"It is popular chiefly among the old Beijing natives, and it is
safe to say that we three are the youngest one among the
shuttlecock fans," she pointed to her partners Li Shiying and
Zhang Ling.
</P>
<P>
"Though Zhang is 18 years old, I have been 27 and Li 39. It is
really a problem."

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Bonded Zone Reports Big Export Increase This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The Waigaoqiao Bonded Zone in
Shanghai's Pudong New Area reported total exports worth 935
million U.S. dollars in the first seven months of this year, a
year-on-year increase of 105 percent.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate is the highest among bonded zones across the
country, said a local customs official today.
</P>
<P>
The 10-sq.km. zone was established in 1990. Currently 3,700
enterprises are operating in a 6.4-sq.km. developed area, with 3,
500 engaging in external trade. Meanwhile, 62 of the world's top
500 multinationals, mainly from the United States and Japan, have
offices in Waigaoqiao.
</P>
<P>
The zone saw its gross domestic product (GDP) grow 20.2 percent
to 6.12 billion yuan last year, and this year it targets at a GDP
growth rate of 15 percent, more than doubling the national target
of seven percent.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, the rapid growth in imports and
exports has given a strong push to the port business at Waigaoqiao.
Between January and July, the Waigaoqiao port handled more than 2.
9 million tons of cargo, a 50-percent rise over the same period
last year.

<P>
NAIROBI, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Kenyans travelling to Germany
will be required to have a visa from August 28, the German

The major newspaper Daily Nation Friday quoted the embassy as

A spokesman for the embassy said that one-month stay visa will
cost 1600 shillings (about 22 U.S. dollars) and 2400 shillings
(around 32 dollars) for a maximum of three months.
</P>
<P>
More than three months' stay will require an application for a
resident' s permit, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The embassy did not specify reasons for such a change and there

<HEADLINE> Vajpayee Says No Change in India's Nuclear Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Indian caretaker Prime
Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee said on Friday that his country was
ready to hold consultations with all countries, including
Pakistan, on nuclear weapon issues and there was no change in its
nuclear policy.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference in Chandigarh, 238 kilometers
north of here, Vajpayee said the draft nuclear doctrine only
clarified the issue of control and command in relation to the use
of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
"It is a draft for consultation," he said, adding that except
for defining control and command, there was nothing new in the
draft released last Tuesday by the National Security Advisory
Board.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee asserted that India stood by its stand of non-first
use of nuclear weapons as well as non-use of nuclear weapons
against countries not having them.
</P>
<P>
"We want all nuclear weapons in the world to be destroyed," he
declared, saying if there was such a decision at the world level,
India would follow suit.
</P>
<P>
The India leader said that New Delhi is for a world without
nuclear weapons, but while framing its policies it has to look at
the situation in totality.
</P>
<P>
The nuclear doctrine has invited a sharp criticism in the world
community with the United States attacking it against the security
interests of India itself, South Asia, the United States and the
world as a whole, and the G-8 (Group of Eight) countries deciding
to defer funding by international financial institutions of
India's non-basic human needs.
</P>
<P>
Indian External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh Thursday
rejected U.S. concerns of a possible Indo-Pakistan nuclear
conflict but said he was willing to discuss the draft with
Washington next month.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee Friday described as "hypothetical" the question
whether there could be a change in India's nuclear policy.
</P>
<P>
He asked the world to study the document fully, saying "we have
not said anything new" in the draft.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Considering to Raise Gasoline Price Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese government is
considering to further raise the gasoline price in two weeks in
view of rising international oil prices.
</P>
<P>
"The current levels of international oil prices require another
increase in domestic gasoline prices," Oil Minister Suleiman
Traboulsi said.
</P>
<P>
He said the increase this time may amount to 300 Lebanese
pounds (about 0.2 U.S. dollars) per 20 liters of gasoline, the An
Nahar newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The government imposed a 400 pounds (about 0.27 dollars) hike
on gasoline prices last Thursday, in addition to tacking 1,000
pounds (about 0.67 dollars) to each 10 kilograms of butane.
</P>
<P>
"If the increase was not imposed, the government would lose 13
billion pounds (about 8.67 million dollars) a week" in revenue,
the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The government funds accrued from a 2,000 pounds (about 1.33
dollars) surtax on oil prices in April have already been eaten up
by increasing international prices.
</P>
<P>
"I am looking into the matter and its prospective impact on
consumers and the Treasury. I will reach as soon as possible a
decision that takes into consideration the interests of both
parties," said Traboulsi.
</P>
<P>
The 400 pounds increase has been decried by the country's
employees and employers, who said they could not afford the extra
charges as in an economic recession.

<HEADLINE> China Remembers Discovery Of Earliest Forms Of Its Language </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANYANG, August 20 (Xinhua) -- China celebrated the 100th
anniversary of the discovery of some tortoise shells and animal
bones on which the earliest forms of Chinese characters were
inscribed some 3,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The discovery proved foreign scholars who believed that Chinese
civilization only dates back to the 7th and 8th century B.C. wrong,
according to Li Tieying, the president of the Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
In 1899, Wang Yirong, a scholar noticed some strange inscribed
characters on a "dragon" bone that was used for traditional
medicine. This discovery eventually led to excavation of a site at
Anyang in Henan Province, where archeologists discovered the
remains of the capital of the Shang Dynasty (16th-11th century B.C.
) and a great number of tortoise shells and animal bones inscribed
with early forms of the Chinese language.
</P>
<P>
That 1928 excavation was the beginning of Chinese archeology,
Li explained. China has unearthed 150,000 inscribed bones and
shells and identified some 1,000 characters. These mysterious
pictograms have attracted researchers from all over the world.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the characters reflect China's 5,000 years of
history. The city of Anyang will hold a series of celebrations
before the end of the year.

<HEADLINE> Tibet is More Than Beautiful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By sportswriter Liu Guang
</P>
<P>
LHASA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The Tibet Autonomous Region boasts
about picturesque landscape, but it is more than beautiful.
</P>
<P>
The foreign journalists, who came here to cover the sixth
national ethnic games, have been impressed by the grandiosity of
the mountains and the magnificence of the temples, but they are
rather moved by the hospitality of the Tibetan people and the
changes to the capital city which housed mostly the Tibetans.
</P>
<P>
Martin, the cameraman with the Hong Kong-based Television of
Spain Asia Pacific (TSAP), came down with the altitude sickness
although he visits the city for the second time, but he still feel
very happy here.
</P>
<P>
"They are very friendly. I have been to many countries such as
Malaysia, Cambodia, Thailand and so on, I think the Tibetans are
the most friendly."
</P>
<P>
"They are always smiling, that makes you have no worry about
problems."
</P>
<P>
The young man said that he had been to the Tibetan household
when he toured the city, and has a long memory of what Tibetan
food he eat.
</P>
<P>
"I have been to some ordinary families and they were very nice.
There is a kind of food, which is shaped like a ball. You put some
butter and flavor into it before rubbing it in hands then you put
it into mouth," said Martin.
</P>
<P>
"It is called Zanba," he remembered its Chinese terms clearly.
"It is not tasty, but it helps digestion."
</P>
<P>
He also found the changes happening to the Tibet Autonomous
Region (TAG) which is celebrating the 40th anniversary of
Democratic Reform.
</P>
<P>
"It looks they are spending a lot on the streets and building."
</P>
<P>
Great changes have taken place to TAG since 1959 when the
Democratic Reform was initiated, abolishing the system of
exploitation and separating religion from government.
</P>
<P>
Lots of fund were contributed from the inland provinces with
Jiangsu Avenue, the best street of the city, was built on donation
from Jiangsu province, Southeast of China.
</P>
<P>
Rosa Maria Calaf, the bureau chief of the TSAP came here for
the first time but she thought the TAG was better than she has
imagined.
</P>
<P>
"We accepted the invitation of the organising committee for we
think the life here is colorful," said Rosa, who also suffered a
little altitude illness. "We are happy here."
</P>
<P>
Not only the reporters but also the foreign visitors are
enjoying themselves here as they were impressed deeply by the
opening ceremony of the ethnic games which featured a large
variety of folk dances and songs.
</P>
<P>
"It is really wonderful for its diversity of folklore. The
color, design, hairstyle and so on, all are very fantastic," said
Larry R, an American ex-prosfessor who have toured a total of 56
countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
Adriana Williams, together with her other six fellows, has come
to the Tibet Plateau for the second time and they heaped their
praises on the ceremony and the TAG.
</P>
<P>
"We came here both for sightseeing and having a look at the
national ethnic games," said Williams who came from California of
the United States. "The performances are really wonderful,
fantastic."
</P>
<P>
"The livelihood here is getting better and better. In the West
we have often been told all is bad here, but after we came here,
it is not really that way, it is not all bad."

on the DRC, made the revelation when arriving in Entebbe airport
from Kisangani Thursday evening, the Monitor daily reported
Friday.

battles in the rebel held city.

He said the exact death toll is still unknown, adding that the
official figure would only come after the soldiers of either side

<HEADLINE> Olympic Champion Fu Absent from FINA Grand Prix Finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 20 (Xinhua) -- China has named an eight-member
squad for the FINA Grand Prix Diving Finals to be held in Mexico
next month without the glittering triple Olympic champion Fu
Mingxia.
</P>
<P>
"Fu was originally listed for the event. However, she prefers
to skip the GP finals as she is now in very good form and we
respect her decision," said Zhou Jihong, director of the national
team.
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old Fu, retired after 1996 Olympics with three gold
medals, has made her return to the international competition
successfully this year at the World University Games in Palma,
Spain, by sweeping both titles in the 10-meter platform and 3-
meter springboard.
</P>
<P>
"We appreciate those who encourage Fu to compete in the GP
finals," said Yu Fen, Fu's coach.
</P>
<P>
"As we know, the most qualified divers for the finals should be
on the top of the overall standing through the previous 14 legs.
Fu had fewer participation and accumulating fewer points than
other Chinese top divers, so we decide to give up the GP finals,"
Yu further explained.
</P>
<P>
The diminutive Fu said she felt exhausted since she has
returned to the front stage in March and competed in events.
</P>
<P>
Following is the Chinese squad for the FINA Grand Prix Finals
in Mexico:
</P>
<P>
Men's 3-meter springboard -- Xiong Ni, Yu Zhuocheng;
</P>
<P>
Men's 10m platform -- Tian Liang, Huang Qiang;
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Considering to Raise Gasoline Price Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese government is
considering to further raise the gasoline price in two weeks in
view of rising international oil prices.
</P>
<P>
"The current levels of international oil prices require another
increase in domestic gasoline prices," Oil Minister Suleiman
Traboulsi said.
</P>
<P>
He said the increase this time may amount to 300 Lebanese
pounds (about 0.2 U.S. dollars) per 20 liters of gasoline, the An
Nahar newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The government imposed a 400 pounds (about 0.27 dollars) hike
on gasoline prices last Thursday, in addition to tacking 1,000
pounds (about 0.67 dollars) to each 10 kilograms of butane.
</P>
<P>
"If the increase was not imposed, the government would lose 13
billion pounds (about 8.67 million dollars) a week" in revenue,
the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The government funds accrued from a 2,000 pounds (about 1.33
dollars) surtax on oil prices in April have already been eaten up
by increasing international prices.
</P>
<P>
"I am looking into the matter and its prospective impact on
consumers and the Treasury. I will reach as soon as possible a
decision that takes into consideration the interests of both
parties," said Traboulsi.
</P>
<P>
The 400 pounds increase has been decried by the country's
employees and employers, who said they could not afford the extra
charges as in an economic recession.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Cabinet Okays Environment Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Zambian cabinet has approved the
drafting of a new amendment Bill to the Environmental Protection
and Pollution Control Act so as to grant more powers to the
Environmental Council of Zambia (ECZ).
</P>
<P>
Opening a two-day Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)
implementation review workshop in Lusaka on Thursday, Environment
minister William Harrington said the ECZ had remained powerless
for too long.
</P>
<P>
Zambian newspaper The Post on Friday quoted the minister as
saying:" although ECZ plays a good role in environment management
it is simply a toothless bull dog."
</P>
<P>
He said the new amendment once passed would ensure that more
policing powers were given to the government body.
</P>
<P>
He said currently ECZ had no power to close down industries or
businesses or impose fines on all failing to comply with
environmental regulations.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Legal Affairs had since been instructed to
start drafting the Bill that will come up in Parliament before the
end of the year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Harrington expressed concern at the concept of
development that entails maximization of profits with little
regard for environmental considerations.
</P>
<P>
"This commission led to the deterioration of the environment
with unforeseen high post development costs," Harrington said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government remained committed to the policy of
sustainable development which took into account environmental
concerns without compromising the needs of future generations.
</P>
<P>
The workshop which drew participants from all sectors of the
economy would try to amend the environmental protection control
regulations of 1997 where necessary.

<HEADLINE> Filipinos Gathering for Anti-Charter-Change Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Tens of thousands of Filipinos
are gathering in Manila Friday afternoon to protest President
Joseph Estrada's bid to make the Philippine constitution more
foreign investor-friendly.
</P>
<P>
The protest, organized by former president Corazon Aquino and
top Roman Catholic Church prelate Cardinal Jaime Sin, is being
staged in the Makati business center in Manila.
</P>
<P>
According to organizers, some 40,000 to 50,000 people from
different social sectors are expected to participate in the
anti-charter-change protest rally, the biggest one during the 14
months of the Estrada government.
</P>
<P>
Former president Corazon Aquino and Catholic Church leaders
said that amending the constitution, even just to allow more
foreign investment as President Estrada plans, would open the door
to more sinister amendments.
</P>
<P>
They said that they are also targeting what they see as the
return of cronyism and corruption since President Estrada took
office in July last year.
</P>
<P>
But President Estrada said that all he wants to do is open up
the nation's economy, which is lagging behind its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
He denied any plan to extend his six-year term in office by
changing the charter.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, tens of thousands of Filipinos are also gathering in
the city's Rizal Park to celebrate the 15th anniversary of
Catholic preacher Mariano Velarde's El Shaddai religious group.

<HEADLINE> UAE Sends Relief for Quake Victims in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates
(UAE) has sent its first plane-load of aid materials for earthquake
victims in Turkey early Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
"The plane left Abu Dhabi International Airport in the early
hours of this morning, carrying 40 tons of tents, blankets and

quake-affected areas and it will fly in a few days," the Khaleej
Times daily said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Further aid from the UAE may also include a team of doctors and
medical supplies.
</P>
<P>
Besides sending aid to Turkey, the UAE has taken measures to
help its nationals back home from the the country that is
experiencing quake aftermath.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Rafter Wins, Rios Knocked out at RCA Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Australia's Patrick Rafter
won his third-round match today at the RCA Championships in
Indianapolis, the United States.
</P>
<P>
Battling an ailing right shoulder, Rafter managed to get past
Canada's Daniel Nestor 7-6 (7-5), 6-2 today to lock up a berth in
the quarterfinals of the $745,000 hardcourt event.
</P>
<P>
With the U.S. Open getting under way in two weeks, the two-time
defending champion in New York says his shoulder is not getting
any better.
</P>
<P>
"It's worse," Rafter said. "If it gets any worse than this
tomorrow, then I won't be playing. It's just not worth it."
</P>
<P>
Rafter aggravated the injury during his loss to American Peter
Sampras in the final of the ATP Championship on Sunday. After
debating whether to play this tuneup event, he needed a third-set
tiebreaker to win his second-round match on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Despite the pain, Rafter says nothing will stop him form
playing in New York.
</P>
<P>
"If it's worse than this, I'll be playing the U.S. Open," he
said. "That's too big a priority for me."
</P>
<P>
Sixth seed Marcelo Rios of Chile put on an awful display as he
fell meekly to Frenchman Sebastien Grosjean 6-4, 6-2. Rios
committed 45 unforced errors and nine double faults.
</P>
<P>
Grosjean will take on third seed Gustavo Kuerten of Brazil in
Friday's quarterfinals. Kuerten got past Sweden's Magnus Norman 6-
4, 7-5.
</P>
<P>
Carlos Moya of Spain and Nicolas Lapentti of Ecuador set up a
quarterfinal meeting with straight-set wins. Moya, seeded fourth,
dumped No. 14 Cedric Pioline of France 6-4, 6-2, while Lapentti,
the 11th seed, beat unseeded Arnaud Di Pasquale of France 6-4, 7-6
(7-5).
</P>
<P>
Three-time champion Sampras will put his 23-match winning
streak on the line tonight against qualifier Max Mirnyi of Belarus.

<HEADLINE> 23 Pro-Israeli Militiamen Convicted in Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-three former members of
the pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army (SLA) have been given jail
terms for collaborating with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese Military Tribunal sentenced Thursday two
defendants to two years in prison, one to 18 months, 12 to one
year and eight to six months, contradicting indictments that
requested at least a seven-year sentence for all defendants, the
Daily Star reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The court referred the case of another defendant to a special
court for juvenile delinquents because he is under 18 years
old. The court acquitted four others because they are over 60
years old.
</P>
<P>
The accused said they joined the militia because they were
under pressure from the SLA or they could not find other jobs.
</P>
<P>
But they denied supplying Israel with information about the
positions of the Lebanese army or anti-Israeli guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The defendants are among the 220 SLA militiamen who turned
themselves in to the authorities after their militia pulled out of
Jezzine in June.
</P>
<P>
Jezzine, a predominantly Christian town outside the Israeli
occupied border zone in south Lebanon, had been controlled by the
SLA for 17 years.
</P>
<P>
The 2,500-strong SLA was trained and financed by Israel to
help it patrol its buffer zone which the Jewish state set up in
1985 with a claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
The officials and dignitaries of Jezzine, where most defectors
come from, think the sentences are harsh. They called on the
government to work in tandem with the Parliament to draft a
general amnesty law that could end the prosecution of the SLA
defectors.

<P>
KATHMANDU, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Indian Foreign Minister
Jaswant Singh will pay a four-day goodwill visit to Nepal on
September 8-11, The Kathmandu Post Friday quoted Foreign Minister
Ram Sharan Mahat as saying.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters Thursday at the Tribhuvan International
Airport after a three-day visit to India, Mahat said discussions
during Singh's visit next month will focus on the outstanding
bilateral issues between Nepal and India.
</P>
<P>
The formal handover of the BP Koirala Health Science Institute,
a project completed with India's assistance, will be the highlight
of Singh's visit, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mahat said during his visit to New Delhi, he had a "quick
review" of the bilateral relations between the two countries in
all his meetings with Indian leaders.
</P>
<P>
Mahat had met with Indian President K.R. Narayanan, Prime
Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh and
opposition leader Sonia Gandhi.
</P>
<P>
Asked if outstanding bilateral issues like the Kalapani issue,
the Bhutanese refugee issue and the 1950 Treaty also featured in
the discussions with Indian leaders, Mahat said, "The visit was
not aimed at obtaining results on bilateral issues. SAARC (South
Asia Association for Regional Cooperation) was the major agenda.
Indian leaders understand our concerns and have all the goodwill
towards Nepal."
</P>
<P>
Asked if the recent tension between India and Pakistan would
have an impact on the Kathmandu SAARC Summit in November, Mahat
said, "SAARC rules out bilateral issues which are controversial.
Such situations have occurred in the past but SAARC got over it."

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai Thursday summoned the state-owned Krung Thai Bank's (KTB)
chairman and asked him to solve any problems with the finance
minister and the governor of the central bank.
</P>
<P>
Chuan was quoted by Channel 9, the state television, as telling
KTB Chairman Mechai Viravaidhya that he could continue to work on.
</P>
<P>
"We don't want the bank to face a problem and there might be
people who want to use it as a political tool," the prime minister
said.
</P>
<P>
This was followed by the leak of a confidential internal audit
report of KTB on August 10 revealing that the bank was saddled
with about 84 percent of non-performing loans (NPL) and would need
provisions of 364 billion baht (9.8 billion U.S. dollars) to 394
billion baht (10.6 billion dollars) to cover the potential losses.
</P>
<P>
However, the bank said its NPL level stood at 59.3 percent as
of the end of June, no higher than the other Thai banks.
</P>
<P>
The KTB problem, directed against Sirin Nimmanahaeminda, the
former KTB president and younger brother of Finance Minister
Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda, has been used as a tool by the opposition
parties to attack the government.

<HEADLINE> China's "Viagra" Case Brought to Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Two parties involved in an
extensively reported argument concerning a Chinese medicine named
after US-made "Viagra" met in a court room of the Beijing No. 1
Intermediate People's Court yesterday, the Beijing-based China
Daily reports today.
</P>
<P>
The case stems from an accusation from the plaintiff,
Shenyang Feilong Health Products Company, that the State Drug
Administration (SDA) "has infringed upon the rights of property,
management and reputation of the enterprise."
</P>
<P>
The situation originated when the company attempted to
register a medicine for treating impotence under the name of Weige
(meaning "Strong Brother"), which is the common Chinese
translation of the Viagra sex pill produced by Pfizer of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
The SDA issued two circulars last spring, claiming that it
did not approve the import nor production of Viagra, and that all
products bearing the name "Weige" were phony. In particular, the
SDA referred to "Weige Kaitai" produced by the Shenyang company.
</P>
<P>
The plaintiff said that the SDA's decision has already cost
the company from Northeast China's Liaoning Province nearly 130
million yuan (or 15.6 million US dollars). And the SDA insisted
that what is described on the drug's instructions -- including the
components, functions and dosages -- are different from those
approved by the local drug administrative department.
</P>
<P>
The defendants asserts that this has misled the consumers,
leaving the impression that "Weige Kaitai" is the therapeutical
medicine instead of a supplementary health product.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Four of the world's women
volleyball superpowers to begin their round-robin tournament
Friday evening in the World Grand Prix Women's Volleyball
Championship at the PhilSports Arena in Manila.
</P>
<P>
Defending champions Brazil and three other elite teams, Cuba,
Italy and South Korea will compete each other before an expected
banner crowd from Friday to Sunday.
</P>
<P>
For Brazil, it's another venue to keep its amazing streak going
after winning the Macau stop via a sweep. For Cuba, its a chance
for redemption after losing all the three games in the Malaysia
leg.
</P>
<P>
Amid a local fervor never seen before, global superpowers
Brazil and Cuba will launch their campaigns against South Korea
and Italy, Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
All eyes will be on the red-hot Brazilians who will tackle the
unpredictable Italians in the main game at 7:30 p.m. as the samba-
loving lasses try to further stretch what has been a winning
season.
</P>
<P>
The Cubans, revenge will be their main motive when they tackle
Asian power South Korea in the opening match at 5:30 p.m. of the
three-day tourney.
</P>
<P>
Brazil has won the Grand Prix three times and is confident of
making it four. But it is wary of Cuba, a title contender, and
also Italy and South Korea which have risen in the world ranking.
</P>
<P>
"This is a tough tournament, there are no easy games. Our goal
is to get the top four and to do this we have to win more matches,
" said Brazil's coach Bernardo Resende.

the top four teams which will play in the finals in China next
week where a pot of 200,000 dollars is on the line.
</P>
<P>
The other four are Russia, Japan, the Netherlands and China
which will play in Chinese Tapei also this weekend.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Officials Allegedly Involved in Bank Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian banking authorities
have steadfastly refused to meet demands made by the House of
Representatives during a heated debate Thursday to disclose the
names of government leaders allegedly involved in the Bank Bali
scandal.
</P>
<P>
A document containing the transcript of confessions made by
former Bank Bali President Rudy Ramli on the involvement of
cabinet ministers, senior government officials and business
tycoons in the scandal was circulated among legislators Thursday.
</P>
<P>
National newspapers said Friday that the names included
President B.J. Habibie's younger brother Suyatim 'Timmy' Habibie,
Supreme Advisory Council head A.A. Baramuli, State Enterprises
Minister Tanri Abeng, Bank Indonesia Governor Sjahril Sabirin,
Finance Minister Bambang Subianto, Indonesian Bank Restructuring
Agency (IBRA) Deputy Chairman Pande Lubis, politically
well-connected businessman Djoko Chandra and Deputy Treasurer of
the ruling Golkar Party Setya Novanto.
</P>
<P>
In the heated hearing Thursday, the House members focused
questions on the possible involvement of powerful people in the
scandal. Legislators, including those from the Golkar, tried to
pressure the senior finance and monetary officials under a barrage
of inquisitive questions from the start of the session at 10:00
a.m. local time.
</P>
<P>
But until the hearing ended at 22:00 p.m. local time, the House
could not elicit any names from the officials.
</P>
<P>
Bambang declined to ascertain whether there was a criminal act
in the Bank Bali case and identify the powerful figures implicated
in the 546-billion-rupiah (78 million U.S. dollars) scandal,
arguing that the investigation process was not yet completed.
</P>
<P>
"We expect to complete the audit process in two weeks time.
After that we'll hand over the results to the National Police and
the attorney general," Bambang said.
</P>
<P>
Bambang, Bank Indonesia Governor Sabirin, IBRA Chairman Glenn
S. Yusuf and other senior monetary officials, who appeared nervous
during the session, were grilled in the hearing.
</P>
<P>
When cornered by legislators who sought confirmation of the
alleged meetings and conversations contained in the document,
Bambang and Sabirin meandered in their explanations, and minced
words in a desperate bid to get off the hook.
</P>
<P>
Contrary to his previous statements, Bambang admitted having
had meetings with some of the suspects in the case.
</P>
<P>
"I have had many guests, but I don't remember the dates I met
with them," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Bank Bali case, first revealed to the media late last
month, centered on Bank Bali's transfer in early June of some 546
billion rupiah (78 million dollars) to PT Era Giat Prima (EGP) as
a commission for the firm's "service" in assisting the bank to
recoup some 904 billion rupiah (129 million dollars) in interbank
claims on the closed Bank Dagang Nasional Indonesia (BDNI).
</P>
<P>
EGP is a company owned by businessmen Djoko Chandra and Setya
Novanto. Most of the commission allegedly landed in the hands of
Habibie's close associates in charge of leading the team to secure
his election in the November presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Bambang flatly denied the allegations, pointing out that the
reimbursement of Bank Bali's interbank claims was made in
accordance with existing regulations.
</P>
<P>
But he acknowledged that the transaction between Bank Bali and
EGP was questionable, insisting that Bank Bali should not have
used the service of EGP because interbank claims were guaranteed
through the government blanket guarantee program.
</P>
<P>
A House member hinted that the House might exercise its right
to conduct its own investigations because it does not trust the
government's probe or the audit to be made by independent
accounting firm Pricewaterhouse Coopers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, election winner the Indonesian Democratic Party of
Struggle (PDI-P) said it has collected hard evidence showing the
direct involvement of 16 people in the scam: four
ministerial-level executive, three high-ranking officials, two
political party functionaries, five business tycoons, one
confidante of the president and one brother of the head of state.
</P>
<P>
The party urged the National Police and the Attorney General's
Office to set up an independent investigation team to thoroughly
deal with the case in a transparent manner.
</P>
<P>
Separately, Bank Bali confirmed Thursday that the whole sum of
546 billion rupiah (78 million dollars) had been transferred into
an escrow account at the bank under the joint control of Bank
Indonesia and Bank Bali.

<P>
MONTEVIDEO, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Brazil and the Community of
Andean Nations (CAN) have begun to implement an economic
complementation agreement, the Latin American Integration
Association (ALADI) announced on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which was signed by Brazil and the four CAN

</P>
<P>
The agreement established tariff preferences and included a

<HEADLINE> Cuba to Produce New Kinds of Sugar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Cuba will produce five new types
of sugar as part of a diversification program implemented by the
Sugar Industry Ministry from the next harvest.
</P>
<P>
Industry sources said Friday that the first plant to produce
amorphous sugar, different from refined sugar because its grain is
smaller and solves more rapidly, is being built in Havana
outskirts with Brazilian technology and a capacity of 20,000 tons
per harvest.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that one of the advantages of this kind of sugar,
as compared with other kinds, is that 30 percent of steam and 40
percent of electricity will be saved during its production.
</P>
<P>
This variety will be joined by luster or glaze sugar (powdered),
golden crystal (of bigger grain), liquid saccharose (used in the
soft drink industry) and caramel colored (especially used in cola
drinks).
</P>
<P>
Cuba's sugar industry, seriously affected by the economic
crisis at the beginning of the decade, is undergoing a process of
recovery following the latest harvest.
</P>
<P>
A total of 3.78 million tons of sugar were manufactured during
the crop, almost 600,000 tons more than the previous one.

<HEADLINE> Groups to Attend Protest Rally Move to Makati, Manila </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Protest groups are starting
Friday morning to move toward Makati city in Manila to join the
anti-Charter-change rally led by former president Crazon Aquino
and Manila Archbishop Jaime Sin.
</P>
<P>
The Filipino channel SNN said about 40,000 to 50,000 people
will participate in the Aquino-Sin rally set for Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The tropical storm that had intensified since Thursday night
shed moderate rainfall in the capital city. But reports quoted
Aquino as saying Thursday that the rally would push through "rain
or shine."
</P>
<P>
The protest rally was said to be organized to pressure the
government to drop its Charter change agenda, which, initial
reports said, involve political changes as well as economic
reforms.
</P>
<P>
Those opposing amendment to the 1987 Constitution said they
want the government to hear more about their opposition to the
Charter change move.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada has made up his mind to
"correct" some provisions of the 12-year-old Constitution, saying
that it was framed at a time when the current global changes could
not be seen.
</P>
<P>
Late last month, the president said he wanted to utilize the
proposed Charter change to help his administration eradicate the
poverty that has haunted the nation for a long time.

HAVANA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Cuban President Fidel Castro said
Thursday that a U.S. military intervention in Colombia would be
repelled and inspire patriotism in that nation as well as in the
entire South America.

<P>
"Those plans have not found support in Latin America," Castro
said at the closing of an international forum on neo-liberalism in
Havana attended by 500 young people from the five continents.
</P>
<P>
Castro said it would be "a colossal mistake" for the United
States to send troops to Colombia, "where a real resistance would
be met."
</P>

The U.S. government has repeatedly refuted press reports that
Washington plans to send U.S. troops to combat the guerrilla and

<HEADLINE> Argentine, Chilean Presidents Inaugurate Gas Pipeline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Argentine President Carlos
Menem and his visiting Chilean counterpart Eduardo Frei on
Thursday inaugurated a gas pipeline that transports gas from
Argentina to Chile.
</P>
<P>
Both presidents praised the integration achieved between their
countries when addressing the ceremony held in the Argentine
province of Jujuy, an intermediate point in the pipeline works.
</P>
<P>
Menem said the joint project has totally erased the two-decade-
old mistrust between Argentina and Chile, while Frei stressed the
peace now existing between them, which "shows the political will
of looking to the future and leaving the past behind."
</P>
<P>
The 941-kilometer gas pipeline cost 250 million U.S. dollars
and has a capacity to carry 8.5 million cubic meters of gas per
day.
</P>
<P>
It starts from Cornejo in the Argentine province of Salta and
ends at the northern Chilean port city of Mejillones.
</P>
<P>
Both countries regard the project as important to their
economies. Argentina will use the gas for developing mining and
other industries in the pipeline area, while Chile will use the
gas in thermal power plants to generate electricity. Chile has
also plans to extend the pipeline to other cities in the north.
</P>
<P>
Following the inaugural ceremony in Jujuy, Presidents Menem and
Frei will go to Mejillones, where a similar celebration is to be
held.
</P>
<P>
They will later travel to the Chilean capital city of Santiago
to sign a series of agreements, which Frei said will "help further
build peace between the two countries."
</P>
<P>
Menem is scheduled to return to Buenos Aires on Friday.

JAKARTA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Forest fires in Indonesia's
South Sumatera were increasing after subsiding in the past several
days, Minister of Forestry and Plantations Muslimin Nasution said.
</P>
<P>
"Only six fires were found five days ago but the number
increased yesterday (Wednesday)," he said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Antara News Agency Friday quoted him as saying that the
fires had flared following land clearing by local people by
burning.
</P>
<P>
To deal with the matter, he said his office had already set up
a team of forest fire fighters.
</P>
<P>
The government would set aside 118 billion rupiah (17 million
U.S. dollars) from the state budget for forest fire fighting in
the regions.
</P>
<P>
Forest fires are currently burning in parts of Sumatera and
Kalimantan. The haze produced by the fires has affected the air
conditions in neighboring countries Malaysia and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, blazes on Kalimantan and Sumatera burnt out of
control, and a huge smoke cloud paralyzed the region. The 1997
fires destroyed about 5 million hectares of forest in the country
with an economic loss of about 4 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Economy Down 9.9 Percent in Second Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The Venezuelan economy shrank 9.
9 percent in the second quarter this year because of a reduction
in government spending by almost 10 percent and a confused budget
policy, Chief of the Economy Advisory Office in Congress Gustavo
Garcia said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The legislator said that the gross domestic product (GDP)
reduction caused the loss of 100,000 jobs, raising unemployment by
15.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The economic deceleration meant a 9.95 percent fall of the non-
oil GDP, while the oil sector saw a bigger drop.
</P>
<P>
However, the budget deficit could amount to zero by the end of
the year, or very far below the expected figures, estimated
originally between three and four percent of the GDP, said Garcia.
</P>
<P>
He ascribed the smaller budget deficit to the rising oil prices
after they dived to the bottom by the end of February, but the
economic recession remains.
</P>
<P>
Garcia also noted that a drain of capitals of five billion U.S.
dollars occurred in the second quarter of the year.

<HEADLINE> Officials Urge Sports Council to Focus on Multisport Events </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian sports officials
urged the National Sports Council (KONI) to pay more attention to
sports development in multisport events of track and field,
swimming, shooting and gymnastics, which offer a large amount of
gold medals.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Indonesian Shooting and Hunting Association and
the Indonesian Basketball Association Sutiyoso said that KONI must
evaluate athletes' performances in these sports after the recently
concluded Southeast Asian (SEA) Games in Brunei Darussalam.
</P>
<P>
"We must see if the organization has the right man in the right
place. KONI must also review the sports organizations' development
system, which might need an improvement," Sutiyoso was quoted by
The Jakarta Post Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We don't have to use our coaches all the time. If our coaches'
skills don't meet world class standards, why can't we hire from
other countries?" he said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia finished third in the SEA Games by taking home 44
golds, 43 silvers and 58 bronzes, the lowest haul since first
participating in 1977.
</P>
<P>
During the Games, track and field offered 41 gold medals, and
swimming offered 37 and shooting 12. Gymnastics was not featured
at the biennial event.
</P>
<P>
Separately, Ministry of Education and Culture's Director
General of Extracurricular Activities and Sports Sri Sudono
Sumarto said that some student training centers had produced young
talent for track and field competition.
</P>
<P>
"They managed to dominate the national junior championships in
July. Unfortunately, we don't have such a training center for
swimming because most swimmers come from the 'haves' who usually
decline to live at the training center," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about KONI's ambition to bid for hosting the 2006
Asian Games, Sutiyoso, who is also the governor for Jakarta, said
he was not notified officially yet by KONI.
</P>

"I knew the plan as a sports organization chairman, but not as
a governor. If they are really serious about the bid, I will fight

<HEADLINE> Untreated Thyroid Disease During Pregnancy Can Affect Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 19 (Xinhua) -- An untreated thyroid disease
during pregnancy may negatively impact a child's psychological
development, according to data published in the August 19 issue of
New England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
The negative impact includes a significantly lower Intelligence
quotient (I.Q.) score and a decrease in motor skills, attention
span, language and reading abilities.
</P>
<P>
Results of the study, conducted by the Foundation for Blood
Research, a U.S. nonprofit medical research and education
institute, show that women with an untreated thyroid deficiency
during pregnancy are nearly four times likely to have children
with lower I.Q. scores.
</P>
<P>
Approximately one out of every 50 women has hypothyroidism (
underactive thyroid) during pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
In the study, 19 percent of the children -- born to mothers
whose thyroid deficiency was undetected -- scored 85 or less on
the I.Q. testing, as compared with only five percent of those born
to mothers without thyroid disease during pregnancy. Scores of 85
or below typically signal that a child will have difficulty in
school.
</P>
<P>
On average, the I.Q. scores of the children whose mothers were
untreated for thyroid deficiencies during pregnancy were seven
points lower than those of the children in the control group. A
score of 107 was found to be average among the children in the
control group.
</P>
<P>
To conduct the study, blood samples were stored from more than
25,000 women who received routine prenatal care in New England,
the United States, between 1987 and 1990. During their pregnancies,
all known cases of thyroid disease were treated.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 and 1997, all of the stored blood samples were tested
for thyroid deficiency, and 62 mothers with thyroid disease were
identified. Of the 62 women with hypothyroidism, 48 were not known
to be thyroid deficient during their pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
In order to establish a comparison, a control group of 124
children was selected from others in the study population whose
thyroid function was normal during pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
According to the Foundation for Blood Research, an estimated 13
million Americans have a thyroid problem, but more than half
remain undiagnosed. Thyroid disease, if untreated, can lead to an
increased risk for heart disease, worsening osteoporosis and
infertility.
</P>
<P>
Many women do not realize that thyroid function is important. "
Early detection and treatment of hypothyroidism is emerging as an
important health issue of both the woman and her unborn child,"
the medical institute said.
