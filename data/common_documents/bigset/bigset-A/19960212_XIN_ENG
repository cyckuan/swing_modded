ANKARA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- France-based EMA has begun
preliminary studies to construct a 300-million-dollar trade center
in the central Anatolian city of Kayseri, the semi-official
Anatolia News Agency reported today.

saying that the project would be financed by the World Bank and
European Union funds. She said a wide range of items would be
offered at the trade center.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese FM Confirms Progress in Syrian-Israeli Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister
Farez Boueiz confirmed here today progress has been achieved by
Syria and Israel in their last two rounds of peace talks, adding
that differences still remain in some details.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Milhem Karam, president of the Lebanese
Journalists Association, Boueiz said that "it is right that this
progress is less than what has been expected, but it is a progress
and no matter what the speed is, it (the progress) is a basical
thing."
</P>
<P>
As a result of two successive shuttle peace-making missions by
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher in the region in last
December and January, Syria and Israel held two rounds of
negotiations at the Wye Plantation conference center in Maryland,
the United States, and will hold a new round of talks on February
26 there.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz said, "The press statement does not always necessarily
embody the right measurement for what is happening inside the
negotiating hall," according to the state-run National News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese minister said the resumption of talks between
Syria and Israel should follow the "basical progress" achieved on
the Syrian-Israeli track.
</P>
<P>
However, Boueiz said, "this does not mean that Lebanon should
wait for a peace agreement between Syria and Israel."
</P>
<P>
For Lebanon, he noted, an understanding on the security
arrangements and Israel's withdrawal from south Lebanon are the
decisive elements for peace with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Then, the Lebanese foreign minister stressed, "the Lebanese
track will be ready for the launch."
</P>
<P>
On a possible impact of early Israeli elections on the peace
process, Boueiz pointed out that "the Americans will interfere to
weaken the possibility of freezing the negotiations by waiting for
the elections."
</P>
<P>
He said Washington will do that through "the affirmation on the
necessity of the continuity" of the peace negotiations.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 12 (Xinhua)-- The Zambian government today
began airlifting relief food to Chama District of Eastern
Province, where is impassable in the current rainy season.
</P>
<P>
Two helicopters of the Zambia air force have delivered 500
bags of maize (90 kg per bag) to the district today, Zambia
Television reported this evening.
</P>
<P>
More helicopters will join the fleet to transport about 3,000
bags of maize to the district in next few days, the report said.
</P>
<P>
A local official was quoted by the television as saying that
the district was hit by severe starvation before the airlifting
due to crop failure caused by last year's drought.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Vice-President Godfrey Miyanda announced that the
government would mobilize helicopters to deliver relief food to
remote areas where are impassable. enditem

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Foreign Ministry's Statement On Sudan's Call To Terrorists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Foreign
Ministry today said that Sudan need not issue a call to the
suspects involved in the assassination attempt against Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak to report to police authorities because
its security organs know where they are.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement issued this evening, the ministry said
"Sudan's objectives have never been to cooperate with the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) or the United Nations
Security Council."
</P>
<P>
The ministry pointed out: "Since Sudan knows full well where
the three (suspects) are being sheltered and its security organs
know where they are being kept, the call issued by its attorney
general is the latest confirmation that sudan is not about to
comply with the request of the security council.+
</P>
<P>
The ministry said the international community would view this
latest Sudanese move as a continuation of Sudanese prevarication
in an attempt to evade the demand of the security council.

<HEADLINE> Sulphur Dioxide Emissions Down Much in Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Sulphur dioxide (SO2) emissions
have been considerably reduced in Europe since 1980, but the level
of other pollutants including nitrogen oxides (NOx) remains high,
said a United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN/ECE)
report on Europe's air pollution.
</P>
<P>
Due to joint anti-pollution measures taken since 1979, "Europe
is now moving out of the so-called sulphur era," an official of
the ECE told a press conference here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The ECE report said that sulphur dioxide emissions in the ECE
region, which also include the former Soviet republics and North
America, dropped on average from 82 million tons in 1980 to 61
million tons in 1993.
</P>
<P>
This is translated into a 48 percent decline in transboundary
fluxes of SO2 within a decade, far surpassing the 30 percent
reduction between 1985 and 1993 as targeted in a protocol signed
by 21 ECE countries.
</P>
<P>
However, situation varied in countries. The ECE official told
the press conference that best records were reported in Austria,
Sweden, Finland, Liechtenstein and Norway, with an around 80
percent reduction, while the worst were in Greece, Croatia,
Portugal, Iceland and the ex-Yugoslavia, which almost doubled the
sulphur emissions over the period.
</P>
<P>
With about 20 million tons of emissions each year, the United
States is the largest SO2 polluter in the ECE region, followed by
the western part of Russia with annual emissions of 3.8 million
tons and Germany with 3.7 million tons.
</P>
<P>
While the European Union announces a total decline of nearly
two thirds of SO2 pollution between 1980 and 2000, U.S. SO2
pollution will remain the highest in the ECE region with about 14
million tons annually.
</P>
<P>
Despite the achievement in reducing sulphur emissions, the ECE
official said that there remain major air pollution problems in
the ECE region including the excessive emission of nitrogen
compounds from traffic, agriculture and industry.

<HEADLINE> Kenya, World Bank Launches AIDS Control Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Kenya and the World Bank
today jointly launched a multi-million dollar project for the
control and prevention of sexually transmitted infection (STI)
and the killer disease of AIDS in the east African state.
</P>
<P>
Launching the project in Nairobi today, the Kenyan Minister
for Health Joshua Angatia said the government contributed 4.5
U.S. million dollars to the project, while the World Bank
provided 40.5 million U.S. dollars of financial aid.
</P>
<P>
Angatia called on international aid institutions and donors
countries to make further donations to the AIDS-ridden country,
saying effective AIDS prevention in the country required an
estimated 14 million U.S. dollars each year.
</P>
<P>
He gave credit to the Kenyan National Aids and STI Program
in their efforts to control and prevent the spread of the
diseases, but emphasised a change of unhealthy habits to check
their spread.
</P>
<P>
The minister also urged various NGOs related to control and
prevention of AIDs to continue supplementing the government
efforts in reducing the AIDS cases in the country.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Ready to Receive Planes Carrying Foodstuff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Iraq said it is ready to
receive all planes carrying foodstuff and medicine which are in
urgent need in the country under more than five years of U.N.
embargo.
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper Al-Jumhuriya today quoted Iraqi Undersecretary
of Ministry of Transport and Communications Ibrahim Ali as saying
that Iraq is ready to extend all facilities for the landing and
taking off of the planes carrying foodstuff and medicine to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He added that the ministry would offer all services to
unloading the planes and transfer of the goods to their stores
directly.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Iraq announced that its port in the south
has also prepared for receiving foreign ships carrying foodstuff
which are to be anchored in the port.
</P>
<P>
The official Iraqi News Agency reported today that the ongoing
talks between Iraq and U.N. on oil-for-food deal is positive and
likely to reach fruitful results as is the hope of the Iraqi
government.
</P>
<P>
Since its announcement of entering dialogue with the U.N. on
oil-for-food last month, Iraq has made some preparations for the
export of a limited quantity of oil under U.N. Resolution 986 in
exchange of food and medicine desperately needed by Iraqis
suffering from U.N. sanctions imposed on the country for its 1990
invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Prior to its decision of having talks with U.N., Iraq had
categorically rejected U.N. Resolution 986 which allows the sale
of 2 million U.S. dollars of oil over six months for humanitarian
purposes, claiming the resolution violated its sovereignty.

<HEADLINE> Israel Angry over Egyptian Press Reports on POWs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 12 (Xinhua) -- In what is perceived as
another evidence of "cold peace" between Egypt and Israel,
Egypt's Ambassador Mohammed Bassiouny was summoned to the Foreign
Ministry here today to hear complaints about Egypt's press
reports on ill-treatment of Egypt's prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Eli Dayan expressed his
unhappiness about the fact that the Egyptian authorities failed to
control over the sharp anti-Israel stories that had been appearing
in the Egyptian media.
</P>
<P>
He was apparently referring to reports written by Dr. Said
Lavandi in the popular daily Al-Ahram that Egyptian prisoners of
war held in POW camps in Israel were murdered and their body parts
sold.
</P>
<P>
According to Lavandi, a Jewish merchant in Paris told him that
he had within his body a kidney that had been transplanted from
the body of an Egyptian POW.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that the merchant described the camps as "a market
for human body parts."
</P>
<P>
Dayan also noted that Israel had not been invited to an
international book fair in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Ambassador Bassiouny told reporters that the reports
in question will be investigated and he hoped that the relations
between the two countries will not be impaired by the incident.

BEIRUT, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Information Minister
Farid Mkari today described the signing of an agreement between
Lebanon's National News Agency and China's Xinhua News Agency a
good beginning for cooperation in the field of information.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement on exchange of news reports signed here

</P>
<P>
Mkari expressed hope that fruitful cooperations between Lebanon
and China will be extended to other official and private public
media institutions.
</P>
<P>
He said the exchange of reports is not only for telling each
other of what is happening in their own country at present, but
also for the two peoples to know each other more and more.
</P>
<P>
"The cooperation between the two news agencies today, and the
cooperation between various information institutions of the two
countries in the future will help in reaching this aim," he said.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Denies Foreign Intervention in Defense Pact with Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Government spokesman Yiannakis
Cassoulides said today that "we have not had nay recent
interference from anybody concerning a joint defense pact" between
Cyprus and Greece.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman spoke in response to Sunday's statement in Athens
by Greek Defense Minister Gerasimos Arsenis that there have been
outside pressure to abandon the defense dogma, agreed on by the
two governments in 1993.
</P>
<P>
"Our position is clear. The pact serves as a deterrent should a
Turkish offensive be launched by the Turkish occupation troops,"
Cassoulides told his daily press briefing.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the view that Arsenis was probably referring to
various concerns aired by the West on different occasions in the
past.
</P>
<P>
Cassoulides stressed the pact would continue "without
interruption" and in certain cases its implementation will be
speeded up.
</P>
<P>
"The sole goal of the defense pact is to provide Cyprus with
land, sea and air cover from Greece only in the event of a Turkish
offensive," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman believed Greece would come to the aid of Cyprus
in case an attack is launched but, he said the difference now is
that the pact would provide the necessary infrastructure to
render any such assistance effective.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has still maintained around 30,000 troops in northern
part of the island since its invasion in 1974.
</P>
<P>
Athens has warned Ankara that a new Turkish offensive against
Cyprus would mean war between Greece and Turkey, two NATO
allies.

However, Israel has so far only agreed on the building of the
runway of the airport after Sunday's negotiations, said Shaath.
</P>
<P>
Further negotiations will be held on Wednesday to discuss the
building of terminals and other security arrangements for the
airport, he added.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, a Palestinian official accused Israel of trying to
impose security control over the airport, saying that Israeli
soldiers "have tried to prevent work in construction of the
airport" for past 10 days.
</P>
<P>
Before starting the negotiations Sunday, Fayez Zeidan, head
of the Palestinian Civil Aviation Authority, said that Israel's
move was "a flagrant violation" of Oslo accords between Israel
and the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> No Shortage of Sugar in Pakistan: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 12 (Xinhua) -- There was no shortage of
sugar in Pakistan and the government had taken measures to check
smuggling and hoarding, a senior official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference, Nawab Yusuf Talpur, the
Pakistani Minister for Food and Agriculture, said that the price
hike of sugar in the open markets was caused by smuggling and
hoarding.
</P>
<P>
The special arrangements had been made to ensure replenishment
of the sugar stocks in utility stores, Talpur said.
</P>
<P>
"The stores are getting supplies twice a day," he added.
</P>
<P>
The government also reconsidered the sugarcane support price,
giving more incentives to the growers and introduction of new
varieties.
</P>
<P>
He said that negotiations with the State Bank of Pakistan were
going on to give credit line to the sugar mill owners.
</P>
<P>
The new season of sugarcane crushing had started earlier than
the schedule this year, he said, adding that fresh stocks started
arriving from the mid January.
</P>
<P>
Recently, some Pakistani newspapers said that Pakistan came
across a sugar crisis.

<HEADLINE> Hekmatyar Calls For Grand Coalition to Oust Rabbani </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Former Afghan Prime Minister
and chief of Hezb-i-Islami Gulbuddin Hekmatyar today called upon
Afghan opposition leaders to forge a grand coalition to pressure
President Burhanuddin Rabbani to step down or else take military
action against him.
</P>
<P>
"If he (Rabbani) remains stick to power than there is no option
but to take joint military action against him," a Hezb-i-Islami
spokesman quoted Hekmatyar as telling the leaders of the Afghan
Supreme Coordination Council and other opposition leaders.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the (Opposition) leaders agree to Hekmatyar's
proposals," Hezb spokesman Ghairat Baheer said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The top brass of the Supreme Coordination Council which
comprises Hekmatyar's Hezb-i-Islami, the National Islamic movement
of General Abdul Rashid Dostum, the National liberation front of
former President Sibghatullah Mojadeddi and Hezb-i-Wahdat faction
led by Karim Khalili have been meeting here for the last three
days in a row to forge grand alliance against the Rabbani regime.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the two other parties, the National Islamic
movement of Pir Syed Ahmad Gillani and the Afghan Islamic
Revolutionary Movement headed by Nabi Muhammadi also joined the
high level meeting of Afghan groups opposing the Rabbani regime.
</P>
<P>
A two-man team of the powerful Taliban Islamic student militia
also arrived here today as the efforts for formation of a grand
opposition alliance get intensified, some Afghan sources said on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
Molvi Eshan ullah and Molvi Muhammad Ghous of Taliban are
expected to meet Hekmatyar Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Hekmatyar has been asking Pakistan to host the summit meeting
of Afghan leaders to settle the lingering crisis in their country.
</P>
<P>
Hekmatyar met Pakistan Interior Minister Nasirullah Babar here
today while General Rashid Dostum called on President Farooq
Leghari.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme coordination council continued their deliberations
on Monday evening in a bid to devise a mutually acceptable
solution to the Afghan crisis.

<HEADLINE> Monthly Inflation Rate Up In Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's monthly inflation
rate reached 4.1 percent in January, registering an increase of
0.5 percent over that of last December.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics released by the Central Statistical
Office said this was because of the hike of consumer prices,
mainly the prices of maize flour, Zambians' main staple, which
went up by some 10 percent during the month.
</P>
<P>
The yearly inflation rate -- from February last year to
January this year -- stood at 44 percent, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Zambian government set the target of annual
inflation rate for this year at 10 percent, according to the 1996
budget.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank said it was ready to reduce inflation rate to
10 percent on condition that fiscal discipline was observed to
minimize the budget deficit.

LONDON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Tourists in London's busiest
shopping districts appeared undeterred at the weekend by the bomb
attack in the Docklands financial district of east London Friday.
</P>
<P>
Local press reported today that on Saturday, shoppers thronged

More than 22 million tourists came to the UK last year. About

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Over 5,000 villagers in Zaka
District in Zimbabwe's central province of Masvingo are on the
verge of starvation because of drought and the unavailability of
maize from the government, the Zimbabwe National News Agency
reported today.
</P>
<P>
"The only food assistance we got was a single delivery of
grain under the Grain Loan Scheme in early January. We are a
forgotten community,'' a villeger in the district was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"We have had unprecedented deaths all of last year and I will
not be surprised if many of them were hunger-induced," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zaka's Benzi area is well known for starvation because
scant rainfall, poor soils and rugged terrain made farming a
difficult task.

<HEADLINE> Indian Minister Regards Rupee Devaluation as Natural  Correction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Indian Finance Minister
Manmohan Singh today urged domestic industry to get used to the
fluctuations in the Indian rupee against the other major foreign
currencies as the country starts moving rapidly towards an
integrated global system.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters after inaugurating an international
conference on India's economic reforms, Singh stressed that the
devaluation of the Indian currency was only a natural correction
as the US dollar had appreciated against other major currencies as
well.
</P>
<P>
He said India's exporters would now benefit from the
dollar-rupee parity of the levels of 1993-94 when the Indian rupee
had dipped to the same level as the present.
</P>
<P>
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had prevented the rupee from
fluctuating along the international levels for two years, he said,
adding that this had led to a volatility in the foreign exchange
market system in the country.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister's remarks assumed significance when the
Indian industrialists, especially exporters, are resentful against
the RBI's recent moves to check the sharp slide of the Indian
rupee.

<HEADLINE> S. African Mining Industry Welcomes Mandela's Call For Restructuring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 12 (Xinhua)-- South Africa's Chamber of
Mines today welcomed President Nelson Mandela's call to
restructure the mining industry, but warned that the process
could not succeed without the full commitment and cooperation of
the government.
</P>
<P>
The chamber was reacting to a call by Mandela during his
opening of parliament speech on Friday to restructure the mining
industry.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released here, Chamber President Du Plessis
said: "The South African mining industry is fully supportive of
President Mandela's positive speech and his calls for a 'new
patriotism' and renewed efforts to build prosperity for all."
</P>
<P>
Du Plessis said the mining industry was already advanced in
extensive restructuring efforts, and Mandela's call in this
regard was therefore welcomed. The government, however, had a
pivotal role to play in assisting and enabling the industry to
propel the process toward conclusion.
</P>
<P>
He also reiterated that the mining industry fully recognised
its responsibility in terms of international competition and did
not look to the government for protection.
</P>
<P>
He added that a meaningful and durable process of
restructuring the mining industry in South Africa could only
succeed with the complete commitment and active support of all
the three parties involved -- the government, labour and
management. enditem

<HEADLINE> Indian PM to Meet Ruling State Party Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister P.V.
Narasimha Rao, who is also president of the ruling Congress Party
(Congress-I), will meet with state party leaders here tomorrow to
discuss the strategy for the general elections, the Press Trust of
India said today.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, originally scheduled for February 8, would be the
first exercise after the recent revelation of the hawala scandal
in which ten top politicians, including three cabinet ministers,
were accused of taking bribes from illegal foreign exchange
dealers.
</P>
<P>
The three ministers, all from the Congress-I, resigned from the
cabinet on January 17 for their involvement in the hawala case.
</P>
<P>
Since then, some senior Congress leaders have been demanding
convening of the Congress Working Committee (CWC), the supreme
decision-making body of Congress-I, to discuss the impact of the
hawala case on the party and how to face the general elections
which may be held in April.
</P>
<P>
While the meeting of the CWC is considered long overdue by
partymen, Congress-I President Rao appears to have dropped the
idea of convening such a meeting in the immediate future by
calling tomorrow's meeting of all state party leaders.
</P>
<P>
The state leaders of the party are expected to use the
opportunity to discuss problems of the state party units and steps
to gear up the party machinery for the elections.

</P>
<P>
The official news agency APP quoted authoritative sources as
saying that the charges that Saleem was trying to procure nuclear
material were baseless because locally recruited staff members of
"our missions abroad like Mr. Saleem only perform mundane and
routine duties."

The sources said "in any case Pakistan's nuclear program was a
peaceful one."
</P>
<P>
The Home Ministry of Britain said Mohammad Saleem had been
ordered deported on the grounds his presence in Britain was "not
conducive to the public good."

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Manufacturing Production Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's manufacturing
production last year reached its lowest level in a decade and has
become a major problem in the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
A senior economist of the Confederation of Zimbabwe
Industries, Farai Zizhou, said today that this is because of high
tariffs on raw materials, punitive interest rates and the lack of
export incentives.
</P>
<P>
''Our latest survey shows if the key fundamentals are put
right, there is a willingness on the part of manufacturers to
increase investment in plants, machinery and buildings,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said high duty on raw materials had severely affected the
competitiveness of locally produced goods and also contributed to
the low output in the manufacturing sector, which accounts for
about 25 percent of the gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
He said it was worrying that production of the metals group, a
major sub-sector of the manufacturing sector accounting for 30
percent of total volume output, was only 88 percent of that in
1980 up to October last year.
</P>
<P>
''That is a total disaster and there is a number of problems
which combine to produce this very negative picture. These range
from over-reliance on a limited domestic market where one cannot
allow for economies of scale to high tax on inputs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Zimbabwean manufacturers should intensify
their export marketing efforts, and also produce products which
meet international quality and environmental standards. enditem

<HEADLINE> India's Ruling Party Identifies Poll Themes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 12 (Xinhua) -- India's ruling Congress has
identified the four key issues of stability, communal harmony,
unity and development as its planks for the forthcoming general
elections, the National Herald said today.
</P>
<P>
The party's election manifesto, the draft of which has already
been prepared by its Manifesto Committee under the chairmanship of
Foreign Affairs Minister Pranab Mukherjee, will focus on these
four major issues.
</P>
<P>
These positive themes, according to All India Congress
Committee Joint Secretary Major Ved Prakash, will appeal more to
the people than such "negative" issues as corruption,
criminalization of politics and inflation which are likely to be
the campaign points of the other parties, particularly the
Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), the Janata Dal and left parties.
</P>
<P>
Though these negative issues will no doubt play on the psyche
of the people to some extent, they will not have the thrust the
opposition parties expect them to have, Prakash said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that these parties, particularly the BJP, are in
no position to fight the elections on the issues like corruption
in the fallout of the hawala case, in which ten top politicians,
including BJP President L.K. Advani, were accused of taking bribes
from hawala dealers.
</P>
<P>
He added that the hawala issue has been a major setback to the
BJP whose clean image has suffered immensely as a result of the
hawala developments.
</P>
<P>
The Congress, on the other hand, has been able to maintain a
clean image despite these developments because of the overall
projection of the party, Prakash went on.
</P>
<P>
The joint secretary foresaw a comfortable victory for his party
in the general elections possibly to be held in April.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John
Major told the parliament this afternoon that his government still
believed that elections to an convention or assembly in Northern
Ireland were the best way forward to a full settlement of the
conflict in the troubled province.
</P>
<P>
He said that his election notion had been widely misunderstood,
and there was no suggestions for a legislative and administrative
assembly.
</P>
<P>
Major explained that the proposed elections would be "a door to
full negotiations" and were "the most promising opening
available".
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that until there was a genuine end to violence,
there would be no ministerial contact with Sinn Fein, political
wing of the IRA.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that his government will not be deterred by
terrorism and that "no stone will go unturned in the search for
peace" in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that the peace process had received a serious
setback, but "it is not over".
</P>
<P>
He condemned the IRA's bombing last Friday and stressed that
public's safety would remain his government's first priority.
</P>
<P>
The Opposition Labour leader Tony Blair supported the prime
minister's position and asked the IRA to give up violence.
</P>
<P>
Downing Street announced this morning that the prime minister
will make a television address to the nation around 2100 hours
expounding his strategy for Northern Ireland after the IRA's bomb
blast.

HARARE, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Transport and Energy Minister

should make full use of renewable energy resources as they are
key to rural development.
</P>
<P>
Moyo told the participants to a five-day sub-regional workshop

''These renewable energy resources also offer a practically
accessible, affordable and sustainable solution to looming
desertification in our region,'' said Moyo.
</P>

He said if provided for, the technologies of these renewable
energy resources would give rural people equal opportunities to
engage in income generating activities as well as help curb the
rural to urban migration and reduce crime frequencies.

<P>
TOKYO, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Japan has abandoned efforts to
recover an experimental plane which was launched today by a
domestically developed rocket but lost after it sank into the
Pacific on reentry into the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
The rocket, the first of the J-1 series, carried into space the
Hypersonic Flight Experimental (HYFLEX) craft, designed to collect
data to be used for Japan's fledgling space shuttle program, Kyodo
News Service reported.
</P>
<P>
The J-1 rocket reached an altitude of 110 kilometers three
minutes and 40 seconds after the lift-off from the National Space
Development Agency of Japan Space Center on Tanegashima Island in
Southwestern Japan. It released HYFLEX 18 seconds later, which
reentered the atmosphere and splashed down in the sea off
Chichijima Island, about 1,000 kilometers south of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
The one-ton vehicle sank into the sea after a 3-meter-long
nylon rope linking the plane with a floating tube was cut off,
Kyodo said.
</P>
<P>
Two crucial data -- the plane's temperature when it reentered
the atmosphere and the extent of damage done to the craft during
its flight -- were lost, Kyodo said.
</P>
<P>
The launch was originally scheduled for February 1, but had
been postponed four times due to technical troubles and
unfavorable weather conditions.

<HEADLINE> Russian Folk Dance Troupe Performs in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Starting with a folk dance
called "The Summer", the renowned Moiseyev Dance Troupe from
Russia celebrated the 42nd anniversary of its first visit to China.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Standing Committee Member of
the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central
Committee Hu Jintao watched the performance along with some 3,000
other people in the audience.
</P>
<P>
"Russia is a nation with great tradition of culture and art,
and I'm very happy to have the chance to watch your performance,"
Jiang said when meeting with the leader of the troupe and Russian
Ambassador to China Igor Rogachev prior to the performance.
</P>
<P>
In 1954 the troupe, led by its founder Moiseyev, toured China
for more than two months, presenting their folk dance technique to
audiences totalling more than 200,000 people, including then state
leaders Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai.
</P>
<P>
Even today, many people still hold fresh memories of their
visit, and experts in China's choreography circles believe that
the influence Moiseyev and his troupe left on Chinese folk dance
art was significant.
</P>
<P>
Formed in 1937, the troupe has traveled to more than 50
countries around the world over the past 40 years. Its purpose, as
Moiseyev put it once, was "to raise the skill of the performance
of folk dances to the highest artistic level and to improve
traditional dances in such a way as to influence the creation of
new national dances".
</P>
<P>
This evening's program included not only folk dances of
different nationalities of the former Soviet Union but also
Chinese folk dances such as "The Red Silk".

<P>
DHAKA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Begum
Khaleda Zia tonight urged the people to give befitting reply to
the anti-election activities through their peaceful and massive
attendance at the polling centers in the February 15 parliamentary
polls.
</P>
<P>
In her address to the nation over radio and television, the
prime minister, who is also the chairperson of the ruling
Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), said that "casting votes is a
sacred duty of all of us" and the people should exercise their
rights of franchise duty in the coming polls."
</P>
<P>
Khaleda asked all to keep patience and remain peaceful in the
face of all sorts of anti-election provocations. Such an
atmosphere could be created to ensure the participation of all
political parties in future elections only if the democratic
process could be maintained through the coming polls, she added.
</P>
<P>
Reiterating the pledges envisaged in the party's earlier
announced election manifesto, the BNP chief expressed the hope
that as in the past, the people would again elect the BNP nominees
by casting their votes in favor of the "sheaf of paddy," the
party's election symbol.
</P>
<P>
Although the BNP and its government have got ready for the
coming elections, all opposition parties including the country's
other three major parties -- the Awami (People's) League, the
Jatiya (National) Party and the Jamaat-e-Islami -- have been
determined to resist the BNP-held "one-party farcical elections".

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Farmers Urged to Use Urea Tablets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian farmers have been
urged to use more urea fertilizer tablets to replace prilled, or
granular, urea fertilizer, according to a report by an economic
consultancy group, the Econit Advisory Group, received here today.
</P>
<P>
Urea tablets are said to help increase rice production by 13
percent or 0.7 tons per hectare. So the government has popularized
the use of urea tablets since 1992 by choosing 15 regencies for
the government's project.
</P>
<P>
However, Farmers, especially those planting rice, have been
reluctant to use the newly-introduced urea fertilizer tablets
since the urea tablets are about 13 percent more costly than
prilled urea.
</P>
<P>
Since using urea tablets would have a positive impact on
agriculture, the government was urged to take more persuasive,
farmer-friendly means of propagating the technique, such as
intensive guidance and training as well as subsidizing loans to
farmers.

<HEADLINE> Commentary: Obstacles to Direct Cross-Straits Exchanges Must Be Removed (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As early as in 1979 the mainland of the motherland appealed to
the Taiwan authorities to take the common interests of the whole
Chinese nation into consideration and achieve direct exchanges of
mail, trade, air and shipping services as soon as possible. At the
same time, relevant departments have been making efforts to
achieve this goal.
</P>
<P>
At present, the mainland has made all preparations for these
direct exchanges, and has reaffirmed time and again that the
mainland is ready to conduct pragmatic talks on this issue at any
time.
</P>
<P>
But the Taiwan authorities have made no active response to the
mainland's good intentions and actions. On the contrary, it has
demanded prerequisite conditions repeatedly and obstructed normal
exchanges as well as economic and trade co-operation across the
Taiwan Straits by every means.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that the intention of the Taiwan authorities
is to make the direct exchanges bargaining chips. On one hand,
they want to postpone the reunification process until changes take
place on the mainland so as to achieve their sinister purpose of
splitting the motherland. On the other hand, they vainly hope to
internationalize the matter of the straits, and turn the present
artificial division and separate rule of parts of China into
recognised facts.
</P>
<P>
People may have noticed that some Taiwan leaders have recently
made remarks showing that they are willing to improve economic and
trade links across the straits and gradually achieve the three
methods of direct exchanges. People hope that their remarks are
not simply tricks to give a false impression that the tension
across the straits has been eased, but are sincere wishes which
can be translated into action.
</P>
<P>
We must observe the Taiwan authorities' actions as well as
listen to their words.
</P>
<P>
Any verbiage not reflecting their true intentions and any
actions that contradict their words will be condemned and spurned
by all the Chinese people, including the compatriots in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that the cross-straits relationship has
plunged to a low ebb, the economic and trade co-operation across
the straits continues to develop. This indicates that exchanges
and co-operation between the two sides of the straits can never be
obstructed by the splittists.
</P>
<P>
The three types of direct exchanges will undoubtedly boost the
economies on both sides of the straits. The Chinese people's joint
economic development will be beneficial to both the invigoration
of the Chinese nation and the peace and development of the world
as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The tortuous and fluctuating relationship between the two sides
of the straits, and the abnormalities in their exchanges and
co-operation have greatly hurt the interests of the compatriots
and the economy on both sides. Such a situation can no longer be
tolerated.
</P>
<P>
If the Taiwan authorities take the people of Taiwan's happiness
into better consideration and truly wish to develop the
relationship between the two sides, they should make a wise choice
and give an active response to Jiang Zemin's suggestions and
proposals, and take practical steps to hold meaningful talks with
the mainland on achieving the three types of direct exchanges.

<P>
PHNOM PENH, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia will reduce tax on
domestic goods and increase duties for imported goods, a local
newspaper quoted Hol Lim, undersecretary of state for the ministry
of industry, as saying today.
</P>
<P>
The undersecretary said that the ministry is preparing a draft
law to promote domestic goods to undercut demand for smuggled
goods.
</P>
<P>
The law, to be submitted to the council of ministers next
month, will strengthen the cracking-down on illegal imports, which
accounted for 30 percent of goods sold in Cambodia, said Hol

<HEADLINE> Iran Protests Turkey for Allowing Anti-Government Demonstration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Iran today lodged a strong
protest against Turkey for allowing Iran's anti-government group
to stage a demonstration.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that Turkish
Ambassador Mithat Balkan was summoned to Iran's Foreign Ministry
and asked to convey Iran's protest to his government.
</P>
<P>
Alaeddin Boroujerdi, deputy foreign minister for Asia-Pacific
Affairs, asked the Turkish diplomat to give explanations in
event, the report said.
</P>
<P>
On the 17th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution in Iran on
Sunday, a group of the People's Mojahedin of Iran (PMOI) staged a
demonstration against Iran after receiving a permission from the
Turkish government.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time the Turkish government has permitted
the group stage anti-Islamic demonstrations in the country, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration has angered the Tehran government because it
had early received an assurance from its neighbor of Turkey to
keep away any militant threat from opposition groups to the
Islamic Republic.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian government is getting worried about the American
support to these anti-government groups in Turkey as the White
House has approved the 20 million dollar covert-operation to
destabilize the Islamic regime.
</P>
<P>
There are about 1 million Iranian nationals residing in Turkey
now. Some of them are carrying out anti-government activities.

<HEADLINE> Lee Teng-hui's Political Clamors Refuted (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lee attempted to break the "old framework" of "One China" and
to separate the nation by creating "Two Chinas" or "One China, One
Taiwan", the article says.
</P>
<P>
Lee claimed that he "has never talked about 'One China'", "At
the current stage, there is the 'Republic of China' in Taiwan and
the 'People's Republic of China' in the mainland, we should try
all we can to forget the word 'One China'", the article says.
</P>
<P>
He even said that he would lead the 21 million Taiwanese to
leave the motherland and build the "Taiwan State", the article
notes.
</P>
<P>
Obviously, Lee's "Big Taiwan" is the "Taiwan State" with a
status equal to the mainland and with independent sovereignty
internationally, the article points out.
</P>
<P>
In Lee's political clamors, he mentions the "Central
Plains". Everybody knows that the central plains refers to the
central part of the motherland, and is a synonym for China, the
article points out.
</P>
<P>
In fact, to Lee, there is no such thing as the central
plains. He has never hoped that there will be a reunited
China. But, in view of the situations both in Taiwan and outside
the island, he cannot talk about the "Independence of Taiwan"
openly.
</P>
<P>
This is the reason for his having come up with the word "New
Central Plains", the article points out, a phase centering on the
word "New".
</P>
<P>
That is, the article points out, there should be a "New Chinese
Culture" that is different from that of the mainland economically,
politically, and culturally, one that can be defined as the
"Taiwanese Culture".
</P>
<P>
And there should be "New Taiwanese" who differ from the Chinese
of the mainland, if one continues this reasoning, the article says.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, what Lee intended to say with his "New" theory is
that there is gap between Taiwan and the mainland and the
reunification of China can not be achieved, and that the only way
is to seek "Taiwan independence", the article says.
</P>
<P>
In this way, Lee has avoided the blame for dividing China and
shifted the blame to the mainland, the article says.
</P>
<P>
"New Plains" is another trick being played by Lee to deceive
the people and win "presidential" votes, it goes on to say.
</P>
<P>
No matter what phrases Lee comes up with: "The Republic of
China in Taiwan", "Life Community", "Sovereignty Belongs to the
People", or "Build Big Taiwan and New Central Plains", the article
notes, he can never escape the bounds of the framework of "Two
Chinas" or "One China, One Taiwan".
</P>
<P>
In this way, Lee has become mired ever deeper in his attempt to
separate China and the Chinese nation, and "He is lifting a rock
only to have it fall on his own feet, and regarding the lives of
the Taiwanese people as a trifling matter," the article says.
</P>
<P>
And in this way he is running counter to the wishes of the 1.2
billion Chinese people, including the people of Taiwan, and he
will, in the end, be spurned by the people.

<HEADLINE> Bank of England Prepares for Single European Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of England is
preparing technically for the introduction of a single European
currency among widespread doubts that it will be launched on
schedule.
</P>
<P>
In the bank's quarterly bulletin, due to be published on
Wednesday, the bank says that it has held meetings with different
interest groups, including building societies, the Confederation
of British Industry, the British Retail Consortium and a wide
range of market associations.
</P>
<P>
It has asked where it would be of help to specify more
precisely its operations and to identify other areas where it
might help to coordinate actions in the payment and settlement
area and in markets.
</P>
<P>
John Townend, a deputy director of the bank, said: "The Bank
has also stressed the importance of considering these questions
both in the context of the UK as a participant in the single
currency and in the context of the single currency beginning to
circulate but the UK exercising its right not to opt in."
</P>
<P>
The bank says it is talking with the UK banking community and
other economic sectors as well as working with the European
Monetary Institute, the embryonic European Central Bank, and other
national central banks on the transition to a single currency
Europe.
</P>
<P>
However, an opinion poll conducted last December showed that
most British voters opposed the idea of a single currency,
scheduled to be launched on January 1, 1999, and wanted a
referendum on whether Britain should join.

<HEADLINE> Rescue Work Stalled at Hokkaido Tunnel Disaster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Rescue workers failed today in
their second attempt to blast away a huge rock that knifed through
a highway tunnel on the northern island of Hokkaido on Saturday,
trapping 20 people in a commuter bus and a car.
</P>
<P>
Some 250 kilograms of dynamite set on and around the giant
boulder were detonated in the afternoon, but the blast failed to
topple the slab into the sea as planned, according to news reports
from Sapporo, capital of the prefecture.
</P>
<P>
The explosion just managed to clip off the bottom edge of the
50,000-ton slab of bedrock as in the first such attempt on Sunday,
which rescue workers tried in an effort to blow the huge slab of
rock into the sea nearby.
</P>
<P>
The explosion only caused the lower part of the rock to crumble
and the slab, which is about 60 meters high and 40 meters wide,
merely slipped further down from its upright position on top of
the crushed tunnel.

<HEADLINE> Commentary: Obstacles to Direct Cross-Straits Exchanges Must Be Removed (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese government officials
said here today that the mainland is ready for direct exchanges of
mail, trade and shipping services between the two sides of the
Taiwan Straits, and called on the Taiwan authorities to remove
artificial obstacles.
</P>
<P>
The officials, in charge of the mainland's postals and
telecommunications, aviation, transportation and trade departments
pointed out that direct and convenient exchanges between the two
sides will be of great significance in promoting mutual contacts,
understanding and exchange between compatriots across the straits.
</P>
<P>
One year ago Chinese President and General Secretary of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee Jiang Zemin
stressed that such direct exchanges are objective demands of the
economic development and growing contacts in other fields, and
they reflect the interests of the compatriots on both sides of the
straits.
</P>
<P>
"Practical steps should be taken to quicken the achievement of
direct exchanges," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
At present, when the ties between the two sides are at a low
ebb, Jiang's positive proposal bears an even more realistic
significance and deserves a response from the Taiwan authorities.
</P>
<P>
For certain historical and current reasons, together with
provocation by some persons with sinister motives, there are
people in Taiwan who still have doubts and misgivings about the
mainland. Understanding and trust can only be formed on the basis
of safeguarding the overall and long-term interests of the Chinese
nation through direct exchanges.
</P>
<P>
However, the Taiwan authorities headed by Lee Teng-hui are
exploiting these people's doubts and misgivings to cobble together
a "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan" policy. In addition, Lee
is attempting to lead the people of Taiwan along the erroneous
road of splitting the motherland. Even worse, he has invented
obstacles to hamper direct exchanges, neglecting the appeals of
the Taiwan compatriots, especially those in industrial and
commercial circles.
</P>
<P>
Peaceful reunification of the motherland is a historical trend
which can not be deflected. Direct exchanges are major channels
for accomplishing the goal, and the misdeeds of the Taiwan
authorities are doomed to be unpopular.
</P>
<P>
Indirect mail, trade and shipping services have led to
inconvenience and extra economic burdens for people on both sides
of the straits.
</P>
<P>
Postal and telecommunications services between the two sides
have to be routed through Hong Kong or other places. This costs
the people on both sides more than 20 million US dollars extra a
year.
</P>
<P>
Indirect trade and investment also raise costs, while related
disputes can not be settled effectively. As a result, they affect
the expansion of economic and trade ties between the two sides.

<HEADLINE> 1 Bidder Left for Pakistan Bank Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Faysal Bank of Bahrain, one
of the two pre-qualified bidders for the United Bank Limited (UBL)
of Pakistan, is unlikely to take part in the final bidding.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's Privatization Commission (PC) sources told local
press today that Faysal bank verbally conveyed to the PC that it
may not participate in the bidding to be held here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Lone pre-qualified bidder, Saudi Basharahill Group will thus
make an offer at the bidding.
</P>
<P>
Faysal Bank and Basharahill Group were pre-qualified from eight
international and national companies who showed interest in buying
26 percent shares and the management of Pakistan's second largest
commercial bank.
</P>
<P>
PC sources said that 26 percent shares of UBL offered for sale
would be privatized if only reasonable price was received.
</P>
<P>
The sources categorically stated that the bank would not be
disposed of at throw-away price.
</P>
<P>
If reasonable bid was received by the lone pre-qualified party
and approved by the government, 25 percent shares would be offered
for sale within a year in the second phase of its privatization.
</P>
<P>
The sources said in case of unreasonable bid price offered by
the lone pre-qualified party for the bank, whole exercise would be
restarted for the privatization of the UBL.
</P>
<P>
The bidding date of UBL was postponed several time this year
because Faysal Bank put certain strings for participation in the
bidding including guarantees and commitment by the government for
financial support to the bank.
</P>
<P>
The demands were rejected by the PC.
</P>
<P>
Bad debt of the bank seems to be one of the main hurdle
impeding the privatization of the UBL.

<HEADLINE> Islamic Militiamen Detain General Aidid's Deputy President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Abdurahman Gabow Mohamud,
Deputy President of the self-declared government of Somali war
faction leader Mohamed Farah Aidid, has been taken away by Sharia
militiamen supporting North Mogadishu faction leader Ali Mahdi
Mohamed, after his residence was raided last night.
</P>
<P>
More than five armed wagons and at least 90 heavily gunmen
were involved in the last night attack which lasted for more than
40 minutes, a witness said.
</P>
<P>
It is obvious that Sharia militiamen loyal to the Islamic
court were fully involved in the attack in which Gabow Mohamud
was taken away.
</P>
<P>
A member from the Sharia implementation council, Mohamed
Abukar Dhorre, said the council will issue what he called a joint
statement over the detention by both religious and political
leaders in North Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
During the attack, one of the body guards of Gabow Mohamud was
killed while the attacked sustained no injury, according to an
eyewitness. Gabow Mohamud's men had resisted to the heavy attack
by the Sharia men, but they were conquered after they ran out of
ammunition.
</P>
<P>
Another key politician opposing Ali Mahdi Mohamed and
appointed by General Aidid as the governor of Mogadishu, Hassan
Abdulle Goley, has been heavily guarded by militiamen of his
subclam against a possible attack by the court militiamen.
</P>
<P>
The detention attempts of these politicians shook the
political arena of North Mogadishu. The court militiamen were
patrolling the main streets checking for unauthorized weapons.
The court has banned the movement of all kinds of weapons in
North Mogadishu and imposed night curfew to secure the fragile
peaceful atmosphere of North Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
this is the first time the Islamic court of north Mogadistu
interfers the political differences among Mogadishu's opposing
leaders.

<HEADLINE> Lee Teng-hui's Political Clamors Refuted (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 12 (Xinhua) -- An article today by Long Quan
criticizes Lee Teng-hui for a plot to deceive the world and
for continuing down the path of "Taiwan independence".
</P>
<P>
It says Lee advocated "managing big Taiwan and building new
central plains" as a political clamor in his book titled "Managing
big Taiwan" published in early 1995.
</P>
<P>
Since that time, on almost every occasion, Lee advocated "big
Taiwan" and the "new central plains," the article says, and some
of the media in Taiwan have given what he advocated a lot of
exposure.
</P>
<P>
The article points out that the focus of "managing big Taiwan
and building new central plains" was to tout the so-called
"economic wonder" and "political achievements" in Taiwan since Lee
rose to power, and to put forth such fallacies on "Taiwan
independence" as "life community" and "the Republic of China is in
Taiwan".
</P>
<P>
But, as for its contents, in the advocacy of "managing big
Taiwan and building new central plains" there is nothing new. It's
only that this time, Lee has adopted a different approach, his
so-called "big" and "new."
</P>
<P>
Lee said, "'Big Taiwan' does not mean that Taiwan is big in
land area or population, but that it enjoys infinite vitality."
This so-called "infinite vitality" is characterized by Lee as
Taiwan's "economic advantage" and "political advantage."
</P>
<P>
According to the article, Lee attempted to create the "Taiwan
State" by using Taiwan's "economic strength" and political
"driving force" to boast about Taiwan's bigness.
</P>
<P>
It seems to Lee that Taiwan has the strength to become an
independent state, the article says, noting that he is attempting
to use the so-called "big" to create a "new situation" and "new
epoch" in Taiwan and to "challenge the impossible."

notes.
</P>
<P>
VCDs have become a major carrier of pirated foreign feature
movies in recent years. Some of them have been officially
published by state publishing houses, but their authorizations
were fake, according to the SCA.
</P>
<P>
The SCA has been asking publishing houses to register
contracts, and it will help them verify the reliability of the
authorizations. But some publishers still ignore the order.
</P>
<P>
China has set up copyright identification relations with some
countries and regions, including the United States and Hong Kong,
which have many times helped find the true copyright owners
abroad.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Army to Buy Airline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The Army Welfare Trust (AWT)
of the Pakistan Army and the Bahria Foundation (BF) of the Navy
have shown their interest in Shaheen Air International (SAI), the
second largest national airline in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to a handout issued today by the Shaheen Foundation,
a subsidiary of the Pakistan Air Force, the AWT and BF have
entered into serious negotiations with the Shaheen Foundation on
the acquisition of equity shares of SAI.
</P>
<P>
On January 22, the Shaheen Foundation acquired the controlling
interest of SAI.
</P>
<P>
Partial acquisition of SAI by the other two foundations of the
defense services would give it a big boost to its credibility and
sales.
</P>
<P>
This latest development will not only enable SAI to utilize the
military circle for its clientele but also have the force of the
three most creditable foundations behind its back.
</P>
<P>
Shaheen Air International is presently plying on a number of
domestic routes.
</P>
<P>
With the new share holders coming in, it would start looking to
expand its business and capture some international routes.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan International Airline is the largest airline and the
national carrier in the country.

<HEADLINE> Securities Trading Active in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Securities trading here
surged by 30.35 percent to 47.049 billion yuan-worth in January,
reversing a two-month decrease trend, according to statistics
released by the Shanghai Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
Flotation of the first batch of paperless treasury bonds in
1996 forced down the index on the Shanghai stock market, which hit
its lowest point since 1995 and closed at 537.35, 17.94 points off
the last trading day in 1995, though the turnover rose slightly to
10.405 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Listing of new shares stirred the stock market early last month
before it was consolidated in late January.
</P>
<P>
The debut of the Shuanghu Coating Materials Co. Ltd in central
China's Hubei Province on January 15 created a record of buy
offers, widening the gap between the first and second stock
markets.
</P>
<P>
The Xinghua Co. Ltd, also in Hubei, and the Ningbo Shanshan
Co. Ltd in east China's Zhejiang Province -- two other
newly-listed shares -- saw their prices drop, and Shanshan even
broke its initial public offering price.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by the bullish markets in Hong Kong and other
countries and regions, Shanghai's market of B-shares, targeted at
overseas investors, rebounded, expanding its turnover by about 60
percent to 368 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The treasury bonds market was bullish too, pushing transactions
to 24.653 billion yuan-worth, accounting for 50 percent of the
total on the securities market. On the bond cash market, which has
attracted many investors, turnover jumped to 6.341 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Of the first batch of paperless treasury bonds, 11.2 billion
yuan-worth were issued on the Shanghai Stock Exchange,
consolidating Shanghai's position as a bond trading center.
</P>
<P>
Re-purchase of treasury bonds, which hit a record at the end of
1995, experienced a U-turn, with transactions totalling 18.312
billion yuan-worth.
</P>
<P>
The 12 funds showed strong performances, gaining much ground at
the end of January, with turnover increasing by 115 percent to
5.952 billion yuan-worth.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 12 (Xinhua) --Senior Chinese Communist Party
leader Hu Jintao said here today that better Party building is the
key to completion of this year's reform and construction tasks.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a gathering to greet the forthcoming Spring
Festival attended by 2,000 senior retired cadres and officials, Hu
said efforts should be made to promote the new, great work of
building the Communist Party of China (CPC) ideologically,
politically, organizationally and in the aspect of work style.
</P>
<P>
Hu, a member of the Standing Committee of CPC Political Bureau,
said priority should be given to ideological work and the
improvement of the quality of leading officials and further
consolidation of the whole functions of the leading group.
</P>
<P>
He said the Party's grass root organizations will be
consolidated with Party units in the rural areas and State-owned
enterprises as priority, and give rein to the role of grassroots
organizations as a fighting force.
</P>
<P>
More efforts should be made to combat corruption in the light
of the requirements of the central authorities, Hu pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He described old comrades as precious wealth of the Party and
the country, and called on the Party organizations and governments
at all levels to do a good job in carrying out the Party's
policies concerning old comrades.

<HEADLINE> OECD Public Aid for Developing Countries Decreases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The public aid which the world's
developing countries received from the 25 member nations of the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)
actually decreased in 1994, according to an OECD report.
</P>
<P>
The OECD, headquartered in Paris, said in the report published
Monday that developing countries got a total of 164 billion
U.S. dollars in 1994 from OECD members, a 20 percent increase over
1993.
</P>
<P>
However, the report pointed out that given factors such as
inflation rate and exchange rate, the OECD public aid of 59
billion dollars for developing countries virtually failed to
increase in 1994. The OECD gave 56 billion dollars for public aid
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The average proportion of public aid to GNPs (gross national
product) of the OECD member countries was 0.3 percent, much lower
than the U.N.-requested 0.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Of the OECD member countries, only Norway, Denmark, Sweden and
the Netherlands reached the U.N. standard in 1994. The United
States had the lowest percentage point of 0.15.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the amount of aid, Japan was in the first place
with 13 billion dollars, followed by the United States with 10
billion dollars and France with 8.4 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, about 35 percent of the OECD aid went
to its biggest recipient, Africa, while Asia got less than 30
percent in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Insurer Underwrites Satellite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai-based Pacific
Insurance (PIC) Co. Ltd will insure the launch and orbital
movements of the Apstar-1A telecommunications satellite, owned by
a Hong Kong company.
</P>
<P>
The PIC will also provide third-party liability coverage for
the satellite, according to two policies the PIC sold to the Hong
Kong APT Satellite Company here today.
</P>
<P>
The coverages stipulated in the two policies are valued at 130
million US dollars and 100 million Pound Sterlings, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Apstar-1A is the third telecommunications satellite PIC has
insured for the Hong Kong company. The first two were the Apstar-1
and Apstar-2 satellites.
</P>
<P>
The Apstar-1A satellite is expected to be launched next month
from the Xichang Satellite Launching Center in southwest China's
Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
"The PIC quickly settled the 160 million US dollars-worth claim
for the explosion of the Apstar-2 shortly after takeoff on January
26, 1995," said Lin Zhongjie, the PIC's general manager.
</P>
<P>
"Our high-quality service has won praise from both at home and
abroad, and we have improved our satellite insurance technology to
win the bidding for underwriting the Apstar-1A," said Lin.
</P>
<P>
The Apstar-1A will carry 24 C-band channels, most of which have
been leased, said a senior official with the APT Satellite
Company, which has plans to launch Apstar-2R, one of the largest
satellites in the world, to cover the whole of Asia and most parts
of Europe and Africa, early next year.
</P>
<P>
The PIC is the only Chinese insurer which has made inroads into
the international satellite market. It has underwritten the
launches of six satellites since 1992.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Japan successfully launched a
rocket carrying an experimental plane into space this morning, but
the plane plunged into the Pacific Ocean and lost because its
floats failed.
</P>
<P>
The 4.4 meter long plane detached from the rocket and splashed
into the sea some 1,000 kilometers south of Tokyo 20 minutes after
the launch as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
However, the floats designed to keep the one-ton plane afloat
until it could be recovered failed and the craft sank before it
could be retrieved.
</P>
<P>
"The launch was successful and the plane sent us the necessary
data," an official of the National Space development Agency of
Japan said.
</P>
<P>
"It looks like it will be almost impossible to retrieve the
plane," said a spokesman for the National Space Development Agency
of Japan at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
The Hypersonic Flight Experiment plane, totally made on
Japanese technology, is designed to collect data to be used for
Japan's fledgling space shuttle program.
</P>
<P>
Two important data were lost in the failure -- the plane's
temperature when it re-entered the atmosphere and the extent of
damage to the plane during its flight.
</P>
<P>
The launch, originally scheduled for February 1, has been
delayed several times due to technical problems and unfavorable
weather conditions.

HONG KONG, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The male teacher thought to
be missing in Saturday's killer hill fire was believed to have
been dead.
</P>
<P>
Legal medical experts confirmed that the charred male body is
of an adult based on an appraisal of its teeth structure. The
body, badly burned beyond recognition, was earlier declared to be
a 13-year-old schoolboy, who was found alive Sunday afternoon in
continued blanket search in the mountain.
</P>
<P>
The discovery of the boy incurred confusion on identities of
the male body. A primary conclusion from the legal medical check
believed that it might be the 32-year-old teacher, who was not
much taller than the boy.
</P>
<P>
A check and measurement on bone are being taken so as to
identify the age and height of the dead, but no final conclusion
has been drawn, sources from the police said.
</P>
<P>
The blaze broke out Saturday in a country park, engulfing 54
students and teachers on a weekend outgoing and killing
four. Seven students are still in critical condition at hospital,
including the schoolboy found alive Sunday. He has received an
operation on the brain.

<HEADLINE> Islet Dispute Clouds South Korea-Japan Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The simmering South Korea-Japan
dispute over an islet has cast a dark cloud over the relationship
between the two neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
The islet of Tokto, called Takeshima in Japanese, is an outcrop
of rock in the Sea of Japan about midway between South Korea and
Japan.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean government proclaimed sovereignty over Tokto
in 1952 and dispatched six policemen in 1956 to the island as
guards. Japanese coast guard ships routinely appear near the islet
to show Japan's ownership of it.
</P>
<P>
The recent quarrel came when the two countries are preparing to
declare an exclusive 200-mile (320-km) economic zone around it.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda said on February 9
that Takeshima is part of Japanese territory and that construction
of any docking facilities on the island will be an infringement on
Japan's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Two days earlier, South Korea announced that it will build a
wharf on the islet.
</P>
<P>
In view of Tokyo's position, South Korea has issued a number of
strongly-worded statements and taken several steps in connection
with the Tokto issue.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, President Kim Young-sam dismissed Japan's claim as
"intolerable" and instructed his administration to deal with the
issue in a resolute manner.
</P>
<P>
Kim also ordered the cancellation of a courtesy call by a
Japanese coalition ruling party delegation on the presidential
office which was slated for today.
</P>
<P>
Presidential Spokesman Yoon Yeo-joon said, "Rather than
repenting its atrocities during the colonial rule and act of
aggression, Japan has repeatedly made absurd remarks, beautifying
its past crime whenever there was a chance."
</P>
<P>
"Japan once again has stirred the anger of the entire Korean
people by making an outrageous claim to Tokto, which rightfully
belongs to Korea historically and under the international law,"
Yoon said.
</P>
<P>
"We, the Korean people, will never condone such a reckless
claim, and from now on, will sternly deal with any problems
arising from it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that it is a rare practice for the South
Korean presidential office to make such a statement regarding a
sensitive diplomatic issue.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Foreign Ministry Spokesman Suh Dae-won had said that
Japan's claim is "unacceptable" as Seoul has effectively exercised
its sovereign rule over the island.
</P>
<P>
In the past few days, South Korean political parties and civil
organizations have also issued statements, urging the government
to deal sternly with the issue and rebuffing Japan's claim to the
islet.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean Defense Ministry decided today to conduct a
joint navy-air exercise near the island, which will involve
destroyers, fast patrol boats, anti-submarine reconnaissance
aircraft and jet fighters.
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, Japan lodged a protest on February 9, demanding South
Korea give up its plan to build marine facilities on the disputed
island.
</P>
<P>
Japan also cancelled the coalition ruling party's visit to
South Korea, which was scheduled for Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believed that the territorial dispute could worsen the
already sensitive relations between the two countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- President Fidel Ramos today
called on all countries to "strike a synergistic balance between
the three development factors of population, resources and
environment."
</P>
<P>
Ramos made the remarks in his keynote address before the 12th
Asian parliamentarians meeting on population and development which
started here today.
</P>
<P>
The president said the widening gap between food supplies and
population growth is an ominous daily threat to millions around
the world.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized the need to curb high population growth,
especially in Asia, in a bid to concentrate resources for
improvement of people's life.
</P>
<P>
"Quite clearly, we cannot long afford the effects of this steep
population growth rate and the highly vulnerable condition of our
natural resources and environment," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to him, for the first time the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) recognizes food, human resource development and
population as key issues to sustained economic growth.
</P>
<P>
He said that his government considers population management as
an important factor towards achieving food security and
development.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting was organized by the Asian Population and
Development Association and the Philippine Legislators' Committee
on Population and Development Foundation, in cooperation with the

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Jakarta Beset with Floods  (by Zhao Xinkao, Liu Ruiping) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Floods that inundated Jakarta
over the weekend continue rising, posing a threat to parts of the
city as heavy rains started pouring again this evening.
</P>
<P>
Weather forecast of continued monsoon rain in the coming days
has shattered some people's hope of returning to normal life after
they experienced one of the worst floods in two decades.
</P>
<P>
At least six people died in severe flooding which swept through
Jakarta since last Friday following heavy monsoon rain.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people fled their homes, some to hotels or
relatives, others to rooftops. Residents waded in waist-deep water
as floods struck many parts of Jakarta last weekend.
</P>
<P>
Almost no part of the city inhabited by nearly 10 million
people was spared, with at least five of the 13 rivers in the city
overflowing.
</P>
<P>
Some hospitals had to cancel scheduled operations because water
inundated some wards, including the operating rooms.
</P>
<P>
Many train services were canceled because tracks were
inundated. Thousands of people arriving at the airport were
stranded as there were only a handful of buses and taxis to take
them to town.
</P>
<P>
TVRI, the state-run TV station, also went off the air Saturday
morning because the basement of its main office was flooded.
</P>
<P>
Around 100,000 telephone lines were out of service. People
whose homes were flooded said their isolation was made complete by
blackouts and telephone service outage.
</P>
<P>
The City Public Order Agency sent out dozens of rubber boats to
the worst affected areas to help with the evacuation of residents
but they were barely sufficient.
</P>
<P>
The Meteorology and Geophysics Agency, which warned of heavy
rains for Jakarta a few weeks ago, said rainfall reached 231
millimeters to 99mm in most parts of Jakarta which are
exceptionally high for February.
</P>
<P>
This is the second major flood disaster to hit Jakarta in just
over a Month. On January 7, ten people were killed and thousands
were left homeless when the Ciliwung river, one of the 13 rivers
in the city, overflowed.
</P>
<P>
As people were trying to cope with the new round of flooding,
the authorities were warning that the floods could get worse,
based on the readings of water levels in the upstream regions of
rivers in Depok and Bogor areas.
</P>
<P>
According to the Public Security Bureau Office, the high tide
in the Jakarta Bay meant that the flooding would recede slowly.
</P>
<P>
The floods which twice crippled the capital city of Indonesia
seriously in one month time have aroused the grave concern of the
authorities. No stranger to floods, the Jakarta residents have
urged the government to take some effective measures, such as
dredging ditches and repairing river banks.

integrity and its people, stated Saliu Bello, Administrator of

harassment of Nigerians by the gendarmes, but that the situation
had remained unchanged.

policing of its border areas to ward off any incursions or
aggression on Nigerian territory.

<HEADLINE> Children's Library Welcomed in Ningxia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, February 12 (Xinhua) -- A children's library in
northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region has begun to
attract thousands of young readers.
</P>
<P>
With the idea of helping children from poor families in
backward areas of the region, the library was set up last December
in Guyuan County and has provided services for 32,000 young
readers so far.
</P>
<P>
Many children will wait in line every day to borrow books from
the library, an event that was seldom seen in recent years.
</P>
<P>
"I used to spend 200 yuan on books and magazines for my child
each year. Now, the 15-yuan library card allows him access to all
the books in the library," explained a local parent.
</P>
<P>
The library has a total of 13,000 books, shelved at 13 branch
libraries located at 12 primary schools across the county. The
branch libraries then exchange their collections every two months.
</P>
<P>
Some 17 such libraries have been set up nationwide since
1987. They are sponsored by the Children's Foundation of the
United Nations and the Song Qingling Children's Foundation of
China.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Being Realistic About Firecrackers This Spring Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Certain steps will be taken
by the Shanghai municipal government in China's largest city to
control the sale or use of fireworks during the Spring Festival
(February 19-24).
</P>
<P>
Chinese traditionally set off firecrackers to celebrate the
festival, spreading smoke and paper residue all over the urban
environment and frequently resulting in fires and injuries.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government has been trying to limit the use of
firecrackers in recent years, and the number of fires caused by
firecrackers last year experienced a 50 percent decrease from the
year before, thanks to measures adopted by the municipal
government.
</P>
<P>
People are allowed to set off fireworks from 6:00 p.m. to 8.00
a.m. from February 18 to 23, only in designated areas.
</P>
<P>
The total volume of fireworks purchased this year is less than
last year and some of the more dangerous items are now prohibited,
and fewer than 1,000 shops are allowed to sell them.
</P>
<P>
Firecrackers have been prohibited in some of China's large
cities, such as Beijing, Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Nanjing, and Harbin.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Prices of retail goods in
China are expected to rise by 9.5 percent in 1996, the State
Information Center estimated.
</P>
<P>
The center, which is affiliated with the State Planning
Commission, said the major inflation pressure will come in the
latter half of the year with the price index expected to go up
from around eight percent to some 11.3 percent in the latter half.
</P>
<P>
Although China successfully put a check on sky-rocketing
prices, inflation is still serious this year, the center said.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, China's retail prices rose by 19.8 percent in the
first three months of the year, but the increase fell to 17.2
percent in the second quarter and 9.2 percent in the last.
</P>
<P>
According to the center, China's price increases differ from
east to west, with the central and western parts of the country
seeing higher increases, while the east suffered less from price
rises. Remote parts in the west of China were hit the hardest.

<HEADLINE> China to Straighten Out Building Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 12 (Xinhua) -- China is set to enforce laws
and provide better supervision nationwide to standardize
construction markets and improve building quality.
</P>
<P>
Vice-minister of Construction Ye Rutang today told a conference
on building quality supervision that project applications, bids,
project acceptance, and evaluation and use of funds will be
studied.
</P>
<P>
According to Ye, some construction units were involved in
unfair competition or practices such as accepting bribes and
extorting kickbacks in the application and bidding process, which
led to chaos in the building markets and declining quality.
</P>
<P>
The official added that, based on complaints, most of the
quality problems occurred in commercial housing sold by
real-estate developers, especially during relocation or renovation
of older urban areas.
</P>
<P>
The senior official has called for local areas to strictly
apply the Decision on Improving Building Quality and the Rules of
Engineering Quality Administration, issued respectively by the
State Council and the Ministry of Construction in their efforts to
rectify the problem.
</P>
<P>
Local governments should also work hard to supervise the
building sector and strive to develop a competitive but orderly
system.
</P>
<P>
The vice-minister called for the setting up of a permit system
for the qualified construction companies. Those who violate the
rules will be denied land use and operation permits, he said.
</P>
<P>
he noted that to improve building quality, relevant departments
in charge of construction will speed up the pace of drafting laws
and rules on building administration, quality supervision and
inspection, arbitration, and handling of accidents and disputes
related to construction problems.
</P>
<P>
The vice-minister said that the Construction Law and Policies
Governing the Building Industry are expected to be put into effect
this year to provide a legal framework for the standardization of
building and improvement of building quality.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Authority Steps Up Effort to Raise Food Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian Food
Industry Association (PFIA), set up by the Palestinian Authority
(PA) in April last year, has made great efforts to encourage
investment and facilitate food companies with appropriate
legislation to build the national economy.
</P>
<P>
The PFIA represents 42 of the largest food companies in the
West Bank and Gaza. There are seven members on the Board of
Directors who are selected from among company directors in the
food industry such as Sinokrot Co., Al-Juneidi, Salwa, the
Islamic meat factory and others.
</P>
<P>
The group recently announced several steps they believe need
to be implemented to fulfill the short and long-term objectives
of Palestinian food industries.
</P>
<P>
The steps are designed to increase the reliance on quality
control throughout Palestinian industry, encourage investment in
the grain production and packaging, penetrate new export markets,
train employees within the food industry, and support Palestinian
industry to meet the ISO9000's needs.
</P>
<P>
The ISO9000 is the International Standards Organization's
directive for a high standard of food quality throughout the
world. An award is given on a company basis after the food they
produced are proved to be of a high quality. Israel has 200
companies that have received the ISO9000 grade, Egypt has seven
and Jordan has two.
</P>
<P>
Investment in the food industry as a whole is calculated to be
250 million to 300 million dollars. The food industry has a labor
force of around 5,000, and an annual turnover of 500 million
dollars, 20 million of which is made in exports to Arab
countries, the European Union and the U.S..
</P>
<P>
The largest export market, according to one of the directors,
is the U.S., followed by Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
The PFLA is planning to launch a regular newsletter that
will specialize in food technology as well as carrying out
studies and workshops conducive to the food industry.

<HEADLINE> UAE Imports from US Up 15 Percent in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates
(UAE) imported some 15 percent more goods from the United States
in 1995 than in the previous year, local newspaper Emirate News
reported today.
</P>
<P>
U.S. exports to the UAE, its second largest trading partner in
the Gulf, was recorded at 2 billion U.S. dollars and a further
rise in exports is expected in the coming years as American
companies push through their products and services to meet the
demand arising from UAE's maltifarious development projects in key
infrastructural and industrial areas.
</P>
<P>
The two-way trade in 1995 reached 2.5 billion dollars, while
U.S exports long accounted for 2 billion dollars and imports from
the UAE was around 600 million dollars, the paper quoted Madga
Siekert, Press and Information Officer (USIS), as saying.
</P>
<P>
1995 is the highest in terms of U.S. exports to the UAE over
the past four years.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia continued to hold its position as the largest
trading partner in the Gulf with 5.5 billion dollars worth of
U.S. exports registered between January and November 1995,
compared with 5.46 billion dollars for the same period of 1993.
</P>
<P>
Total Saudi imports in 1994 was 6 billion dollars, while total
figures for 1995 were not available.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait remains at the third place with 1.3 billion dollars
worth of US exports in 1995, as against 1.06 billion dollars in
1994.
</P>
<P>
Other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries also have trade
relations with the U.S.. But Bahrain's import from the U.S.
dropped from 402 million dollars in 1994 to 212 million dollars in
1995.
</P>
<P>
Oman imports from the U.S. in 1995 stood at 204 million
dollars, as against 200 million dollars in 1994; Qatar imported
192 million dollars U.S. goods in 1995, as against 144 million
dollars in 1994.
</P>
<P>
With the value of 19.83 billion dollars, the Middle East and
the Gulf countries in total accounted for 3.7 percent of
U.S. total exports worldwide in 1995. In 1994, the share was 4
percent, totalling 19.15 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea to Stage War Game Near Tokto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 12 (Xinhua) -- South Korea will conduct a joint
navy-air exercise near Tokto Island in the East Sea (Sea of Japan)
despite the sharpening Seoul-Tokyo territorial dispute over the
islet.
</P>
<P>
Defense Ministry Spokesman Yoon Chang-ro announced here today
that the drill, a quarterly event of the ministry, will be
conducted within the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
However, the ministry has yet to finalize the time-frame for
the exercise although it is considering launching it as early as
February 14, Yoon noted.
</P>
<P>
Participating in the war game will be destroyers, fast patrol
boats, anti-submarine reconnaissance aircraft and jet fighters.
</P>
<P>
The mock warfare will begin with the deployment of warships and
end with fighters attacking imaginary targets in the area,
according to Yoon.
</P>
<P>
The ministry is said to have become more watchful of the islet
since a diplomatic row was triggered by Japan's claim to it.
</P>
<P>
On February 9, Japanese Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda said in
Tokyo that Tokto Island -- called Takeshima in Japanese -- is part
of Japanese territory.
</P>
<P>
Ikeda's remarks followed a South Korean announcement that it
plans to build a wharf on the islet, a 0.186-square-kilometer
outcrop in the sea about midway between South Korea and Japan.
</P>
<P>
In protest, South Korean Foreign Ministry Spokesman Suh Dae-won
said in a statement that Japan's claim is "unacceptable" as Seoul
has effectively exercised its sovereign rule over the island.
</P>
<P>
"The construction of the wharf is the legitimate exercise of
our sovereignty," Suh said.
</P>
<P>
South Korean President Kim Young-sam also dismissed Japan's
claim to Tokto as "intolerable" and instructed his cabinet to deal
with the issue in a resolute manner.
</P>
<P>
President Kim ordered the cancellation of a courtesy call by a
Japanese coalition ruling party delegation on the presidential
office which was slated for today. In response, Japan cancelled
the delegation's visit to South Korea altogether, which was to
begin on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Inland Fisheries In Sri Lanka To Be Revamped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government
has decided to revamp the country's inland fisheries industry,
official sources said today.
</P>
<P>
Initially it is proposed to rehabilitate the premier inland
fisheries stations in the North Western Province.
</P>
<P>
Steps will be taken to provide infrastructure facilities for
the large scale breeding of tilapia, Chinese carp and the popular
Indian species mirigal, cutla and rohu.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that Sri Lanka has great potential for the
inland fisheries industry and there are numerous tanks and
reservoirs with an estimated area of 120,000 hectares.
</P>
<P>
The potential had been proved when some years back fingerling
breeding surpassed the figure of 10 million annually and inland
fish production was about 25,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately the industry has been neglected in recent years

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Industrial outputs in the
dynamic Southeast Asia and East Asia grew nearly 10 percent last
year amid declines in all other parts of the world, a UN report
was quoted as saying by the Thai News Agency today.
</P>
<P>
According to the report of the UN Industrial Development
Organization (UNIDO), the industrial outputs of the two regions
grew 9.5 percent in 1995 thanks to trade liberalization policy.
</P>
<P>
Reforms in the manufacturing structure in the regions also
boosted the outputs through increasing exports, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The achievement occurred amid production slowdown in all other
regions, which was caused by downward economic expansion in
industrial countries, it said.
</P>
<P>
UNIDO said that the circumstance dragged the growth rate of the
industrial outputs worldwide to 3.2 percent last year down from
4.4 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The developed economies registered a growth rate of merely 2.5
percent in 1995, compared with 4.2 percent in 1994, said the
report.

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 12 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein returned home
today following a two-day fence-mending visit to Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Hussein, who did not see Saudi king Fahd, held talks with Saudi
Crown Prince Abdullah and other senior officials on bilateral
relations between the two countries apart from regional and
international issues of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters upon his return, the King voiced full
satisfaction at the visit, which, he said, proved to be an
opportunity to visit Saudis.
</P>
<P>
He said Amman's ties with Riyadh have become stronger than
before after "causes of cool relations" completely disappeared.
</P>
<P>
The king underlined that both sides are determined to
safeguard bilateral relations both at present and in the future,
preventing any party from harming them as happened in the past.
</P>
<P>
Hussein said Jordanian-Saudi talks were conducted in a frank
atmosphere, noting that the two sides agreed to keep in touch in
order not to repeat what had happened.
</P>
<P>
He added that the two countries are keen to play their role
towards the Arab nation and their countries as well.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that what happened in the past became history
and that now a new promising beginning is in the process.
</P>
<P>
Amman and Riyadh fell out five years ago, when the
traditionally pro-Western Jordan refused to join a U.S.-led
coalition force which drove Iraq out of Kuwait in February
1991.

Samy Vellu said here today that three cement brands from China
have met the quality standard set by Malaysia.

<HEADLINE> Polgar Beats Xie in Game Eight of World Championship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAEN, Spain, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Hungarian Zsuzsa Polgar
beat defending champion Xie Jun of China in the eighth game of the
World Women's Chess Championship here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The win gave the 27-year-old Polgar the overall lead of 5.5
points against 2.5 for Xie.
</P>
<P>
"Xie's loss put her into a very difficult position to defend
her crown," said Ye Jiangchuan, Xie's coach.
</P>
<P>
Xie, 26, took an all-out attack from the beginning with the
whites, mobilizing her rooks, bishops, queen and pawns.
</P>
<P>
But she failed to find a way through Polgar's excellent defence
and had to give up a rook in her 24th move of the game, which took
more than five and a half hours.
</P>
<P>
Ye said the 30th move in which Xie withdrew a bishop spoiled
the chance to seek a draw.
</P>
<P>
Each win scores one point and a draw 0.5 point. While
title-holder Xie needs only eight points to keep her crown,
challenger Polgar has to score 8.5 points to wrest the title.
</P>
<P>
Xie dethroned Maya Chiburdanidze of Georgia to take the world
title in 1991 and beat another Georgian Nana Ioseliani to retain
her crown in 1993.

LUSAKA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- A group of South African
businessmen are ready to pump about 10 million U.S. dollars into
the Kaimbwe salt project in Zambia's North-Western province.
</P>
<P>
Head of the project Kirk Reitman said in the northern city of
Ndola the three months' feasibility studies undertaken last year
were a success and that the investors are ready to start work
soon.
</P>
<P>
"We want to see if we can start the project as soon as
possible because we suspect that the (Zambian) government will
take a bit of time to approve this important venture," said the
Cape Town-based South African businessman.
</P>
<P>
Discussions with an international finance leasing company were
about to be concluded, in which the group is seeking more than
500,000 dollars to set up a processing factory at the site, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Zambia's salt reserves are being tapped by the local people on
a small-scale basis and if fully developed, it will save the
country a lot of foreign exchange.

According to the study, Arab food imports have totaled around
190 billion dollars since 1980. The Abu Dhabi-based Arab Monetary
Fund (AMF) said the Arab wheat shortage would jump to 19.2 million
tons in 2000 from 8.8 million in 1992, while that of cereal would
rise to some 26.1 million tons from 19 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Experts attributed the increasing Arab food imports to a rapid
population growth and higher food prices.
</P>
<P>
No concrete values of Arab food imports were
available. However, a report provided by the AL's Economic
Department said Arab food deficit was estimated at 1.7 billion
dollars in 1995 compared to 1.09 billion dollars in 1994.

<HEADLINE> West Wants Kenyan Opposition To Unite: Wamalwa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The opposition "National
Alliance" was formed under pressure from the West, Chairman of
opposition FORD-Kenya party Kijana Wamalwa disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Wamalwa told reporters at Kakamega Town in western Kenya
Sunday that opposition leaders found it hard to neglect the
pressure from Western groups interested in Kenyan politics.
</P>
<P>
The "National Alliance", composed of FORD-Kenya, FORD-Asili
and the Democratic Party, was formed last month, aiming at
choosing one opposition presidential candidate together during
the 1977 general elections to compete with the ruling KANU.
</P>
<P>
Wamalwa said pressure from members of diplomatic corps and
religious groups at home plus the fear of repetition of the 1992
opposition defeat forced them into setting up the opposition
alliance.
</P>
<P>
Internationally, Wamalwa said, "I found it hard when I visited
Washington to convince our friends there that it is healthy
democracy to have many political parties. They emphasised that we
should come together to form one strong political organ that can
remove KANU from power."

<HEADLINE> King Hussein Ends Visit to Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 12 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan
left Mecca this morning for home after ending his fence-mending
visit to Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
The official Saudi Press Agency reported that the Jordanian
monarch met late Sunday with Crown Prince Abdullah, but giving no
details on the talks.
</P>
<P>
State television said King Hussein and the Crown Prince, who is
acting ruler while King Fahd is recovering from illness, held an
initial round of talks to discuss bilateral ties and the situation
in the region.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein, accompanied by his Prime Minister Abdul Karim
Kabariti, also made a mini-pilgrimage to Islam's holiest sites in
Mecca, near Jeddah in western Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
But Saudi officials said the Hashemite king did not meet his
Saudi counterpart, King Fahd, who was also in Mecca, spending the
last 10 days of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Information Minister Marwan Muasher had earlier said
that King Hussein would meet the ailing King Fahd, who suffered a
blood clot on the brain in November, according to diplomats.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Sunday, Saudi sources also ruled out a similar
meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, who was also in
Mecca for a pilgrimage and to meet senior Saudi officials.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, shunned by many of its Arab neighbors because of its
pro-Iraqi stance after President Saddam Hussein's August 1990
invasion of Kuwait, is hoping King Hussein's visit will finally
normalize relations.
</P>
<P>
On January 1, King Fahd put Abdullah, his half-brother and
designated heir, in charge of the government for an unspecified
period, saying he needed to rest.
</P>
<P>
Hussein had been scheduled to visit Fahd in December, but that
meeting was postponed after the Saudi king fell ill in November.

annual business of more than 50,000 containers, and a 50 percent
discount to international transfer containers.
</P>
<P>
The port authority also announced that it will start upgrading
its facilities in preparation for the fifth generation of
container ships in June this year.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the port's eight berths handled 700,000 containers,

</P>
<P>
Vice-mayor Ye Disheng says that the port plans to handle
800,000 containers in 1996, and that by the end of the century,
annual flow of containers is expected to hit 1.4 million.

<P>
BEIJING, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Divorced women now have a
place to open their hearts, and more importantly, to rebuild their
lives, according to today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
Over a cup of tea, women confide their sorrows and secrets to
sisters with similar experiences at the "Women's Tea House", a
non-profit women's center in Beijing. Generally, the women leave
brimming with renewed optimism.
</P>
<P>
"I no longer feel depressed," says Zhou Li, a divorced woman
who volunteered to work at the tea house. "Divorced women should
not only carry on but live a better life than before. We must
create a new image of ourselves before we can change others'
attitudes towards us."
</P>
<P>
The founder and host of the tea house is Shi Jianping, a
42-year-old woman who divorced and remarried. She said there were
various women's clubs but none catered for middle-aged, divorced
working women, who often need more understanding, love and help.
</P>
<P>
Although divorce has become more and more common, it still
often carries a stigma.
</P>
<P>
With the reputation of the tea house spreading rapidly by word
of mouth, Shi plans to develop the tea house to provide free
counselling and legal consultation and also hold a series of
lectures to teach women practical skills such as tailoring and
hair-dressing.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Adopts More Security Measures in Colombo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government has
adopted more security measures in Colombo following the January 31
bomb blast that killed 84 people and injured 1,200, official
sources said today.
</P>
<P>
Under the measures, all heavy vehicles, such as trucks,
containers and bulldozers, will not be allowed to enter commercial
and residential areas in the city during the daytime.
</P>
<P>
Traffic, including containers and trucks to and from the
Colombo Harbor, will be diverted through the main container drive

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Becoming International Financial Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 12 (Xinhua)-- China's largest metropolis is
closer to making its dream of building itself into an
international financial center come true, observers here say.
</P>
<P>
The city's financial industry has developed rapidly in market
structure, technical means, reforms, and opening up to the outside
world.
</P>
<P>
A regional commercial bank, the Pudong Development Bank, has
been set up in this biggest industrial city in China, and the
Pacific Insurance Company has broken the monopoly of the People's
Insurance Company of China (PICC) in Shanghai and established its
own footing.
</P>
<P>
The influx of foreign banks and securities firms has
contributed to the diversification of the city's financial market
formerly monopolized by state-owned banks. Shanghai now has a
comprehensive financial network with the central bank at the core,
state-owned commercial banks as a principal part, and other
commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, Shanghai had 14 Chinese banks, five Chinese
insurance companies, 18 Chinese non-banking financial
institutions, and 316 security institutions with legal person
status from outside the city. Total financial operations came to
2,700, double 1990's figure.
</P>
<P>
The 38 financial institutions from 14 countries and regions and
the 116 representative offices of foreign banking institutions
from 19 countries have become a powerful force here.
</P>
<P>
At present, financial business amounts to 9.032 billion US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has also made a breakthrough in computerizing the
financial sector, with 80 percent of the banking offices having
been computerized, and 400,000 credit cards and 1.41 million
deposit cards have been issued so far. Each day, some 800,000 yuan
is withdrawn through the ATM system.
</P>
<P>
The securities market in Shanghai has become a major source of
capital flow, and the insurance market earned 4.4 billion yuan in
1995.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Voter Turnout, Test to Bangladesh's Ruling and Opposition Parties  (by Jiang Xianming) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The turnout of voters in
Bangladesh's parliamentary elections scheduled for February 15
will be seen as a test to both the ruling Bangladesh Nationalist
Party (BNP) and the opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
A reasonable turnout Thursday will mean a victory for the BNP
which is ready for the polls while the absence of large numbers of
voters will be seen as a victory for the opposition.
</P>
<P>
Demanding for resignation of Prime Minister Khaleda Zia and
holding of the national election under a neutral caretaker
government, the mainstream opposition parties -- the Awami
(people's) League, the Jatiya (national) Party and the
Jamaat-e-Islami -- have from the very beginning boycotted the
polls process.
</P>
<P>
In an election without the opposition parties, one cannot
expect a good voter turnout even in a peaceful situation. The
situation is made complex as the opposition parties are determined
to stop at any cost what they call "the one-party election farce".
</P>
<P>
Their recent activities have demonstrated that they mean what
they say. Rival university students have traded gunshots and
turned campuses into battlefields since the end of last month.
Clashes between the gun and bomb-armed agitation activists and the
police and BNP supporters have occurred frequently and are
spreading across the country, taking the toll of a growing number
of people and damaging hundreds of motor vehicles and houses.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the opposition has announced to impose a "mass
curfew" during the polling day by enforcing an 48-hour nationwide
strike.
</P>
<P>
In spite of the opposition boycott, the ruling BNP and its
government do not feel isolated. There has been a feeling in the
camp that no matter what happens Thursday, violence or no
violence, a mere enduring of the polling day will be enough to
sustain its rule for another term of five years.
</P>
<P>
It happened under former president Hussain Muhammad Ershad who
staged the 1988 election shutting the opposition parties out.
Though the poll was hardly credible, Ershad survived for nearly
three more years until late 1990 when he was ousted by a popular
movement.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here are of the view that the opposition's attempt to
stop the polls through violence can be foiled because the military
and other law-enforcing agencies have been ordered to deploy
around various polling stations to intercept any violence
approaching these places.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, by merely announcing the results of the
polls after "acting in play", the BNP can avoid any face-to-face
confrontation with the opposition, the analysts said.
</P>
<P>
But even if the BNP could go through the polls to sustain its
rule, the turnout is still important because it is a reflection of
the real aspiration of the people. The ruling party needs to have
the polling results recognized by the international community and
the countrymen.
</P>
<P>
It was disclosed that Western donors have acquiesced in the
BNP-held elections and the two sides have reached an understanding
over a "two-election theory -- one election for another election"
to resolve the country's nearly two-year-old political crisis.
</P>
<P>
The new formula advises the opposition not to observe strike on
the polling day to allow the people to exercise their right of
franchise without any fear of coercion, violence or intimidation.
If the voters response falls short of the government's
expectations, it would help the opposition urge the government to
hold the next election soon through necessary amendment to the
Constitution in line with the opposition's demand.
</P>
<P>
Since the coming elections can not resolve the prolonged
political impasse, the "two-election theory" has widely been
described as a constructive solution. For this reason, the BNP
pays serious attention to the turnout of voters to show its actual
strength and prestige in view of future bargaining with the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
Apparently, no matter what happens on February 15, the turnout
of voters is a true test to the two sides.

TOKYO, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Japan today successfully
launched a rocket that sent a one-ton experimental plane into
outerspace.
</P>
<P>
The J1 rocket carrying the Hypersonic Flight Experiment plane
blasted off from the Tanegashim Space Center on the southwestern
tip of Japan's main island of Honshu.

<P>
The 4.4-meter-long plane, co-developed by NASDA and the
National Aerospace Laboratory, plunged into the sea northeast of
Chichijima Island in the Pacific Ocean about 1,000 Kilometers
south of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
The data received from the plane was crucial for the
development of Japan's space shuttle program, according to NASDA

<HEADLINE> Nepal Unlikely to Achieve Literacy Target on Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Nepal is unlikely to meet
the government-set target of achieving a literacy rate of 60
percent by 1997, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The government officials, speaking at a national workshop here
on Sunday, said the country was lagging far behind the target of a
60 percent literacy rate for the eighth five-year plan period
ending 1997.
</P>
<P>
The failure to achieve the target was attributed to the lack of
relevant government policies and sufficient literacy programs.
</P>
<P>
Opening the workshop, Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba called
on non-governmental organizations in Nepal to play a crucial role
in raising social awareness and providing education programs.
</P>
<P>
According to Education Minister Govinda Raj Joshi, Nepal's
literacy rate has stagnated at around 40 percent in recent years
and the government has decided to raise the literacy target to 67
percent by 2000.
</P>
<P>
The three-day workshop was designed to collect suggestions on
how to achieve the government's target.

<HEADLINE> ZANU (PF) Blamed for Mismanaging Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's opposition United
Parties leader Abel Muzorewa launched his presidential campaign
here on Sunday with a blistering attack on the ruling ZANU (PF)
for "plunging the country into financial crisis."
</P>
<P>
Muzorewa, who is one of two candidates from the opposition
parties for the March presidential elections, told a crowd of
about 700 supporters that the government of President Robert
Mugabe had mismanaged the economy, resulting in a spiral in the
price of basic commodities, massive retrenchments and the closure
of many companies.
</P>
<P>
"The ZANU (PF) campaign is based on cheap politicking and
evoking war memories as well as events from the past while the
economy is left to rot," charged Muzorewa.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's economy had sunk to its lowest ebb because of
rampant corruption and mismanagement, he claimed.
</P>
<P>
Muzorewa said if voted into power he would rid the country of
corruption, reduce taxes, woo back investors and would
reintroduce value added tax.
</P>
<P>
His party would also reduce the budget deficit, trim the size
of the cabinet and scrap the posts of provincial governors and
deputy ministers, he added.

<HEADLINE> Changes in Rural Companies Making a More Potent Economic Mixture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 12 (Xinhua) -- China's rural industries,
which began to appear in the mid-1980s and then began to play an
increasingly important role in the national economy, are now
seeing a drastic shift in its development mode.
</P>
<P>
After a decade of rapid growth, greater attention is now being
paid to improving quality instead of merely expanding scale.
</P>
<P>
According to figures recently released by the Ministry of
Agriculture, the number of township-run businesses went down by
246,000, or 1.28 percent, in 1995. But, goals set by the state
went up by roughly 25 percent, and both annual industrial output
value and export value of these firms account for one-third of the
nation's total.
</P>
<P>
Although they declined in number, their strength has increased
in other ways. By the end of 1995, the number of rural firms with
output value of more than 100 million yuan annually has risen to
4,000.
</P>
<P>
Business turnover of rural enterprises registered a 28 percent
rise last year, reaching five trillion yuan, and annual profits
totalled 309.6 billion yuan, 20.37 percent above the previous
year. They turned 128 billion yuan over to the state in taxes last
year.
</P>
<P>
With the increasing amount of attention paid to quality, the
number of name-brand products have been increasing yearly. Fifteen
of the 21 state-award-winning brands of shirts were the products
of rural businesses.
</P>
<P>
Another trend, in the aftermath of economic reform measures,
some rural firms have become conglomerates, and the agriculture
ministry, last November, gave the title of "National Enterprise"
to 329 rural enterprises, which had 200 billion yuan in annual
sales each. Thirty rural businesses have been listed as the top
500 enterprises in China.
</P>
<P>
One Chinese economist has said that the formation of enterprise
groups is important for making full use of whatever talents the
rural industries have, by improving management, accelerating
progress in science and technology and their competitiveness both
on the domestic and international markets.
</P>
<P>
The development of an export-oriented economy is also a very
important factor in improving the quality of rural firms, says a
government offical in charge of rural development. Of the 80,000
export-oriented rural enterprises, 396 have been granted a license
to import and export their products directly to other countries
and regions. The value of goods for export increased at an annual
rate of 40 percent during the past five years.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and
Trade predicts that by the year 2000 the value of goods for export
by rural firms will rise to 1.2 trillion yuan, half the national
total.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government is encouraging rural firms to take part
in bidding for overseas projects and to increase economic and
trade cooperation with foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that rural enterprises across the country have
set up 1,000 businesses abroad, with a combined investment worth
three billion U.S. dollars.

Sunday fled to Thailand's western province of Tak to escape
fighting inside Myanmar, according to the Thai Border Patrol
Police (BPP).
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper Bangkok Post today quoted BPP sources as
saying that the Myanmar refugees -- mostly women and children --
fled because they feared getting caught in crossfire between
warring Karen National Union (KNU) rebels and the Democratic Karen
Buddhist Army (DKBA).
</P>
<P>
BPP sources were quoted as saying that about 200 KNU rebels
attacked a DKBA's camp on Saturday and the fighting continued
until Sunday. Thai security forces posted along the border in the
Song Yang district of Tak province have been put on red alert.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Gem, Jewelry Exports Exceed 1995 Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's earnings from
exports of diamonds, gems and jewelry last year are estimated to
be 53 billion baht (2.1 billion US dollars), exceeding the target
of 51.05 billion baht (two billion US dollars), the Bangkok Post
said today.
</P>
<P>
The final figure for 1995, now being computed by the Thai
Business Economics Department, is expected to be released later
this month, said the report.
</P>
<P>
According to the department, total export earnings in the
sector between January and November last year amounted to 49.48
billion baht (1.97 billion US dollars), up 8.7 percent from that
of the same period of 1994.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted the department as saying that if this trend
continued in December, the export earnings could have reached 53.5
(2.14 billion US dollars) for the whole of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The improved performance is likely to press the Commerce
Ministry to revise upwards the target of 53 billion baht (2.1
billion US dollars) for the sector this year.

BANGKOK, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's ethylene production
capacity is the top among Southeast Asian countries and will
remain high for the rest of this decade, according to the Bangkok
Post today.
</P>
<P>
The country's ethylene production capacity now stands at about
700,000 tons a year, Pailin Chuchottaworn, managing director of
Bangkok Polylene Co., was quoted as saying by the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The capacity will increase by 300,000 tons next year when a new
Thai petrochemical plant comes on line. It will further increase
by 600,000 tons a year in 1998 when another plant of Rayong
Olefins Co. goes into operation, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's income from petrochemical products between January
and November last year totaled 65 billion baht (2.6 billion US
dollars), more than double that of the same period of 1994, Pailin
said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, increased domestic production allowed Thailand to
export 100,000 tons of polyethylene and 120,000 tons of
polypropylene chips for the first time.

<P>
BANGKOK, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The number of street children
in Bangkok is on the rise, with many of them turning to
prostitution to make a living, according to an official of a
children's foundation here today.
</P>
<P>
The number of street children has risen to more than 20,000
from 13,000 in just a few years, said Tongpoon Buasri, coordinator
of the Foundation for Better Life for Children.
</P>
<P>
She said the children had left their broken homes to seek jobs
in Bangkok and their jobs range from selling garlands and
newspapers, cleaning car windows to prostitution.
</P>
<P>
She said those becoming prostitutes often do not care about
getting AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Noting that there is no regular government fund for children,
the official urged the government to give more financial aid and
more attention to the problem.
</P>
<P>
All the charity organizations in Thailand had to share only 25
million baht (one million US dollars) in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
When contributions from the government dried up,
non-governmental organizations have to seek money from abroad,
which has become increasingly difficult.

YANGON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar leader Senior General
Than Shwe today urged all the national races to cherish the
current favorable situation in the country and safeguard the unity
of the whole nation.
</P>
<P>
In a message at the ceremony marking the 49th anniversary of
the Myanmar Union Day, Senior General Than Shwe, chairman of the
Myanmar State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), also
called for efforts to boost other sectors of the economy as well
as agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The SLORC government has invested more than 2.59 billion kyats
(432 million US dollars) since last March and is speeding up work
for economic and social progress of the national races, said the
Myanmar leader.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Myanmar National Convention now in session
has drawn up constitutional principles to guarantee the political,
economic and social rights of the national races.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Though unchallenged in the
Democratic caucuses, U.S. President Bill Clinton wound up a
two-day Iowa trip with an appeal for a more civil political
discourse.
</P>
<P>
"We should not use elections to divide," wire services quoted
Clinton as saying at a Drake University rally. "We should use
elections to move the country forward."
</P>
<P>
The president, who came to Iowa with a newly signed farm-loan
bill, had brunch with victims of the 1993 Midwestern floods on
Sunday to remind voters that his administration helped "Iowa put
itself back together" after that disaster.
</P>
<P>
Crowds gathered at presidential rallies in Iowa City, Mason
City and Des Moines.
</P>
<P>
The president's Republican rivals, meanwhile, drew hundreds of
people in a number of Iowa cities over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
For the most part, Clinton stuck to the rhetorical road map set
out in his State of Union address delivered to the Congress on
January 23, challenging Americans to demand better protection of
the environment, better anti-crime efforts, campaign finance
reform, preservation of U.S. world leadership, enhanced family
values and economic progress.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question, Clinton said he felt his campaigning
was a necessary part of an important process, not an attempt to
influence Republican voters.
</P>
<P>
Asked by reporters which of the nine Republican contenders he
would prefer to see nominated, he said: "I want the Republicans to
select their nominee. That's their job, not mine. One of the
things that I have found out about this is that no one knows who
can beat someone else...no one knows."

XI'AN, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Foreign-funded enterprises in
northwest China's Shaanxi Province will enjoy priority in power
supply from next month.
</P>
<P>
This announcement was made by Cheng Andong, governor of the
province, at a meeting attended by managers of provincial
foreign-funded enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Sharp increase of power consumption and backward generating
facilities have meant that provincial power shortages have been
growing, averaging six to eight million kw every day, and even as
high as 10 to 12 million kw at peak times.
</P>
<P>
In order to guarantee that local large, profitable and
foreign-exchange-earning enterprises can stay operational, the
province has worked out measures to ensure a steady supply of
electricity.
</P>
<P>
Of the province's nearly 2,000 foreign-funded enterprises,
those that went operational last year already have generated four
billion yuan in output value.
</P>
<P>
The province's 930,000 kw generating units are expected to go
into operation this year. By the turn of the century, installed
capacity of the province is expected to surpass 10 million
kw.

WUHAN, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The Dongfeng Automobile Company,
in this capital of central China's Hubei Province, plans to
produce 10,000 light-duty trucks this year.
</P>
<P>
As one of the country's three major auto manufacturers, the
company expects to increase annual light-duty truck production
capacity to 150,000 by the turn of this century.
</P>
<P>
The supply of medium-sized trucks in China has by now almost
caught up with demand, but the supply of light-duty trucks still

Even though the company has an annual production capacity of
200,000 medium-sized trucks, it will still need a great effort to
restructure its product mix to speed up the development of
light-duty trucks.
</P>
<P>
Among the province's total of 570 auto manufacturers, assembly
plants and parts factories, 53 have been chosen by the provincial
government and the company to provide a complete line of
production services to promote the province's production of
light-duty trucks.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Beijing will try to approve
1,000 foreign-funded projects and use 1.2 billion US dollars in
overseas investment this year, "China Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
Lu Yucheng, vice-mayor in charge of the city's foreign trade,
emphasised that in 1996 the capital will make great efforts to
attract overseas investment and expand foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Beijing approved 1,552 foreign-funded enterprises
and used 1.4 billion of direct foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
This year, Beijing will give priority to using overseas funds
for infrastructure development, industrial restructuring, housing
construction and renovation, high-tech industries, agriculture and
service industries.
</P>
<P>
Lu added that Beijing is particularly keen to develop high-tech
industries such as electronic information, biological engineering
and pharmaceuticals; technology-intensive industries like
auto-making and electronics; and basic industries such as
metallurgy, chemicals and building materials.
</P>
<P>
China has entered a period of adjustment in using foreign
investment, which means a good investment climate will replace
preferential policies as the attraction for foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
He said the municipal government will try to ensure foreign
funds flow into the above key sectors. It will rectify restrictive
practices which adversely effect foreign-funded firms and further
improve education and medical conditions for the dependents of
overseas investors in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
A total of 72 new joint ventures, co-operative and
foreign-funded enterprises were set up in Beijing in January this
year, involving contracted foreign investment of 180 million US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The largest investment is 27.9 million in a wool textile
plant. And 75 percent of the 72 firms are in the manufacturing
sector, mainly electronics, machinery, chemicals, textiles and
foodstuffs.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 12 (Xinhua) -- About 150,000 workers in key
enterprises in the coal industry will be let go or transferred to
other sectors this year so as to improve the industry's efficiency.
</P>
<P>
An excessive number of employees and low efficiency have long
plagued the industry, according to a working conference held by
the Ministry of Coal Industry recently.
</P>
<P>
The industry's productive efficiency improved much during the
Eighth Five-Year Plan (1991-1995), by reducing the number of
employees and constructing high-yield and efficient mines.
</P>
<P>
During that time, 500,000 workers in key enterprises were
retired or transferred to other sectors and 53 mines were in line
with international standards in terms of production and efficiency.
</P>
<P>
The ministry vows to cut employment costs by a large margin and
to build another 15 mines this year.

<HEADLINE> Keating Is Still Underdog In Election -- Opinion Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister
Paul Keating was still behind Opposition leader John Howard in the
run for the March 2 federal election.
</P>
<P>
Keating scored a narrow win in the television debate with
Howard last night, winning the support of 51 percent of the
audience, while Howard was endorsed by 49 percent of the crowd
watching the debate at the Channel Nine studio.
</P>
<P>
But the response of audience outside the studio was less
favorable to Keating. A News poll published today showed that 50
percent people surveyed immediately after the debate believed
Howard outperformed Keating in the debate. Only 36 percent thought
that Keating did better.
</P>
<P>
In another public opinion poll released today, voters in all
states gave a poor rating of Keating as the preferred Prime
Minister, marking the first universal turnaround of public
attitude toward Keating since last October.
</P>
<P>
Some 47 percent of the people surveyed regarded Howard as a
better choice over Keating, while 42 percent (down one percent)
preferred Keating as the Prime Minister.
</P>
<P>
Though the survey was taken before Keating announced the Labor
Party's funding plan of its election commitments and the TV debate
yesterday, it showed that Labor was still far behind the
Opposition.
</P>
<P>
In last night's debate, Keating revealed some of the soft
points in his election policies and allowed Howard to score
comfortably on them.
</P>
<P>
One of Howard's arguments that received the most positive
response from the audience during the night was his attack on the
Labor Government's employment policy.
</P>
<P>
The youth unemployment rate was still as high as 30 percent
after 13 years of Labor rule, but Keating had not put forward
efficient policies to address the problem, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The only way you can seriously reduced youth unemployment is
to get small business going again because only small business has
the capacity to create jobs," Howard told Keating in the debate.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Labor candidates at the grassroots level indicated
that Labor's election policies failed to get expected response
from the voters.
</P>
<P>
The AGB McNair poll showed that Labor's health policy,
announced last week and promising up to 500 Australian dollars
(375 US dollars) of extra medical subsidies for families with
children, seemed to have failed to impress the majority of voters.
</P>
<P>
Two-thirds of the voters surveyed said that the health policy
would make no difference to how they vote.
</P>
<P>
Poor response to Labor's policies was most evident in New South
Wales, the state with the largest number of seats in the
Parliament, and Victoria, where Labor is expected to win extra
seats to offset possible losses in other states.
</P>
<P>
The opposition has launched a massive assault on the "tired"
13-year-old Labor government. One of its campaign slogans is
"enough is enough," implying that the voters are fed up with
Labor's policies and want a change.
</P>
<P>
Since last weekend, the Labor Party has changed its election
strategies and took initiatives to hit the weak points of the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
Keating challenged Howard to release the opposition's costing
details of its election commitments. Keating scored strong support
from the debate audience by saying that the opposition had failed
to reveal clear policies.
</P>
<P>
But last night's debate is far from a decisive battle.
</P>
<P>
The AGB McNair poll showed that no matter whom they would vote
for, voters became more convinced that the opposition would win
the election. Fifty-two percent of voters believed the opposition
would win, while only 34 percent said Labor would.

<HEADLINE> Polls: Dole Leads Republican Presidential Runners  in Iowa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 11 (Xinhua) - U.S. Senate Majority Leader
Bob Dole has become the most favored Republican Presidential
runner to open his third bid for the White House with a victory in
the Iowa caucuses, the opening battle of the U.S. 1996
presidential campaign, according to the latest local polls.
</P>
<P>
The two polls showed that Dole won the support of 28 percent of
those likely to vote on Monday night in the state's 2,142 party
meetings, at least 12 percentage points ahead of his nearest
rival.
</P>
<P>
Multimillionaire Steve Forbes has good performance in the past
few weeks in some states including Iowa due to his wide-spread
campaign advertizings and has widely believed to be the main
threat to 72-year-old Dole.
</P>
<P>
But the situation seems to be changing with the last-minute
private polling by the campaigns suggesting a late surge by
conservative commentator Pat Buchanan. Buchanan, who won 13 of the
21 delegates for the GOP's National Convention in the Louisiana
caucuses last week, has been campaigning on moral values and
"America first" economic protectionism.
</P>
<P>
Buchanan appeared locked in a tight race with publisher Steve
Forbes for second place, with former Tennessee Governor Lamar
Alexander just behind.
</P>
<P>
In the past, a second place finish in Iowa has given candidates
media attention going into the next big test, the New Hampshire
primary due to be held on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
As Republicans dashed around Iowa and flooded the airwaves with
attack commercials, Democratic President Bill Clinton dropped in
for a two-day visit to ask Democrat supporters to show up and vote
for him in the November elections.
</P>
<P>
Iowa sends only 25 of the 1,990 delegates to the Republican
National Convention scheduled to be held in San Diego in mid
August, where a candidate will be selected to battle Clinton in
the November elections. But the state has an importance beyond its
size because it is the first event of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
About 130,000 to 150,000 Republicans are expected to vote
at the party's caucuses in Iowa.

<HEADLINE> Holbrooke Believes Problems in Bosnia to be Solved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Assistant Secretary of
State Richard Holbrooke arrived here later today from Sarajevo to
discuss the Bosnian peace process with the Yugoslav leaders.
</P>
<P>
Before ending his brief visit to Sarajevo, Holbrooke said he
believed the problems in the full implementation of the Bosnia
peace accord would be resolved.
</P>
<P>
The tension between Republika Srpska and the Muslim government
in Sarajevo over the arrest of Serb officers would ease, the U.S.
official was quoted by Tanjug news agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Serb Gen. Djordje Djukic, Col. Aleksa Krsmanovic and their
associates were arrested by Muslim police on January 30 on their
way for talks with the NATO-led peace implementation Force IFOR.
</P>
<P>
The Serb authorities have accused the Muslim government of
violating the peace agreement as the arrested Serb officers are
not on the list of war criminals indicted by the Hague
international tribunal. They have also suspended all contacts with
the Muslim-Croat federation.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke flew into Sarajevo early today in an attempt to
defuse the crisis erupted both by the arrests and by the disputes
between Muslims and Croats over the township Mostar.
</P>
<P>
Demonstrations were held in the divided city of Mostar last
week by Bosnian Croats who oppose a proposal put forward by EU
administrator in Mostar Hans Koschnick on the future arrangement
of the city.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke is expected to go back to Sarajevo on Monday, from
where he will go to Zagreb, Croatia, to continue his Balkan visit.

<HEADLINE> London Police Warn of More IRA Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 11 (Xinhua) -- London police said Sunday they
were extremely concerned that the IRA, which exploded a huge bomb
in London Friday, may intend further attacks.
</P>
<P>
Assistant Commissioner of Specialist Operations at Scotland
Yard David Veness said another attack could come at any time,
anywhere in mainland Britain.
</P>
<P>
He appealed for "particular vigilance" from the public and
asked them to report any suspicious activity to the police
immediately.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the likely targets would be high-profile
locations.
</P>
<P>
Two people were killed and more than 100 people including three
police officers were injured when the bomb exploded under a
railway bridge in the Docklands financial district of east London
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Before its 17-month-long ceasefire declared in 1994, the IRA
had frequently targeted London in its campaign to drive Britain
from Northern Ireland.

<HEADLINE> IMF Proposes New Data Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) said today it has undertaken to establish standards to
guide countries in providing the public with a regular and timely
flow of data.
</P>
<P>
In April 1995, the Interim Committee of the Board of Governors
--the IMF's decision-making body--requested the IMF's Executive
Board to develop these standards.
</P>
<P>
A framework for the standards was proposed in a report to the
Interim Committee in October 1995.
</P>
<P>
The proposed standards has two tiers. A general standards aims
to provide guidance to all member countries in providing data to
the public. A so-called More Demanding Standards aims to provide
guidance to countries participating in international financial
markets or aspiring to do so.
</P>
<P>
The cornerstone of the proposed standards is an electronic
bulletin board (EBB). It would identify publicly the member
countries that have signed up for more demanding standards, and it
would provide important information about country practices.
</P>
<P>
IMF is looking into ways to encourage electronic dissemination.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Parties Urged to Comply with Dayton Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, February 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. assistant secretary of
state Richard Holbrooke today called on the parties in Bosnia to
fully implement the Dayton peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
"we are here to insist on full compliance with Dayton, no
exceptions, no changes," said Holbrooke, as he arrived in Sarajevo
to meet with Bosnian leaders.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke was sent by U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher to defuse crises arising from the detention of Serb
officers by the Bosnian government and the Croats' refusal of
arbitration on Mostar by EU administrator.
</P>
<P>
"We consider this as the first serious challenge to the Dayton
agreement," Holbrooke said, "All three parties are still saying
they will comply but they are arguing over what compliance means.
We are here to help them straighten it out."
</P>
<P>
After meeting Bosnian President Alja Izetbegovic, Holbrooke
said that "we absolutely reafirmed full compliance with Dayton. We
furthermore reaffirmed America's support for Mayor (Hans)
kschnick's proposals in regard to Mostar."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. mediator said that the talks in Sarajevo were very
useful and he would meet Bosnian leaders again after a overnight
visit to Belgrade.

<HEADLINE> Majority Vote For Poll To Go Ahead On February 26 In Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Freetown, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Majority of Sierra Leone's
National Consultative Conference voted this evening for
presidential elections to be held on February 26.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-six of the 74 delegates gave the answer "yes" to holding
the elections as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leone's new military government, led by Brigadier
Julius Maada Bio who ousted former Head of State Captain
Valentine Strasser, has not yet commented on the results.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 14 delegates including those of the rebel
Revolutionary United Front (RUF), said they wanted peace before
elections.
</P>
<P>
"We stand for sustainable peace. We do not seek, in our own
national interest, election before peace," said a RUF statement
sent to the meeting. It did not say what it will do if the poll
go ahead as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
The representative of the military government to the meeting
said "security cannot be guaranteed during the elections as
additional personnel would have to be recruited not to disrupt
the ranks of soldiers at the warfront".
</P>
<P>
Three other groups, including the police, the National
People's Party and a local town council abstained.
</P>
<P>
Among the groups for the elections were the National Unity
Party, which observers say had strong links with the government,
the Sierra Leone Women Development Movement, which was set up by
the military government, and the Sierra Leone Association of
Journalists.
</P>
<P>
The delegates at the conference were drawn from various groups
including students, doctors, traders and political parties.
</P>
<P>
Shirley Gbujama, chairman of the conference, said at the end
of the meeting that "the people have spoken for democracy".
</P>
<P>
Officials of the National Electoral Commission, said they were
"delighted over the outcome as it confirms their earlier
statement that the overall majority of Sierra Leoneans wanted the
elections to go ahead".
</P>
<P>
"We shall now continue with our plans for the elections," said
one official.

<HEADLINE> Mandela's Intention To Invite Gaddafi Receives Wild Reaction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 12 (Xinhua)-- South African President
Nelson Mandela's intention to invite Libyan leader Muammar
Gaddafi to pay a state visit has caused a wild reaction from the
main political parties in the country.
</P>
<P>
Mandela's intention to invite Gaddafi was supported
by the African National Congress (ANC).
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here today, the ANC said the possible
visit by Gaddafi is another milestone in the normalisation of
foreign relations between South Africa and the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
The current democratisation process in the country was the
result of support by the international community, including
Libya, to the people of South Africa during the liberation
struggle, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The ANC stressed that Gaddafi's possible visit should not only
focus on expressing its gratitude for their unflinching support,
but should also lay a firm base for an exchange program in
technological, cultural, scientific and other fields between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
However, the Natioal Party, the Conservative Party and the
Democratic Party expressed their concern over the possible visit
of Gaddafi, saying the invitation was not in South
Africa's interest and could also deal the reconstruction and
development program a serious blow.
</P>
<P>
During a visit to the quarry where he worked as a prisoner on
Robben Island yesterday, Mandela announced that he was
considering inviting Gaddafi to visit the country in defiance of
any pressure from the west.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said during the apartheid years Libya had provided
unwavering support to his liberation movement.
</P>
<P>
"It is through their (Libya and many other countries) support
that we are empowered today," said the president, adding "we will
never renounce our friends". enditem
