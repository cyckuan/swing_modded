<P>
   HALLANDALE, Fla. _ To American fans, Europe's most flamboyant
jockey might forever have been known for the strange ride he gave
Swain in the 1998 Breeders' Cup Classic at Churchill Downs.
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday at Gulfstream Park, Frankie Dettori gave us
something better to remember him by.
</P>
<P>
   Dettori gave Daylami a flawless ride as they rallied from
seventh to a 2{-length victory over Royal Anthem in the $2 million
Breeders' Cup Turf. Afterward, the 28-year-old Italian performed
his famous flying dismount and then took off on his critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just hoping God would give me a clear path,'' he said,
``because I knew the press was waiting for me to (bleep) up
again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, I made a mistake,'' he said of letting Swain drift out in
the final strides of the '98 Classic, seeming to cost the
Arab-owned horse the one-length margin of defeat as he finished
third to Awesome Again and Silver Charm. ``But don't judge me on
one ride.''
</P>
<P>
   Daylami was Dettori's second Breeders' Cup winner. He rode
Barathea in the 1994 Mile at Churchill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me a long time to get over Swain,'' he said. ``Revenge
is a plate you eat cold, and mine is freezing, believe me.''
</P>
<P>
   Tough luck: Although Artax equaled Mr. Prospector's track record
and broke Elmhurst's Breeders' Cup with his 1:07.89 Sprint victory,
runner-up Kona Gold might have been better.
</P>
<P>
   He dropped an uncharacteristic four lengths off the pace and
rallied at the rail _ on a day when that style wasn't working _ to
lose by a half-length.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Kona Gold) slipped a little bit behind when the gates
opened,'' said jockey Alex Solis, who finished second for the sixth
time without winning in the Breeders' Cup. ``I wish the race had
been 25 yards longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Bucking the trend: The Thoroughbred Corp.'s Anees, in the
Juvenile, was the only winner all day to come from off the pace. He
was 14th and last early in the 1 1/16-mile race before contract
jockey Gary Stevens weaved through and around traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was concerned all day long (about the apparent track
bias),'' trainer Alex Hassinger said after the son of 1990 Kentucky
Derby and Breeders' Cup Classic winner Unbridled scored his first
stakes victory. ``We changed the track bias.''
</P>
<P>
   Hassinger, nephew of Breeders' Cup inventor John Gaines, won the
1992 Juvenile Fillies at Gulfstream with Eliza.
</P>
<P>
   Canani exacta: Julio Canani not only trains Mile winner Silic _
who was coming off a pretty win in the Oak Tree Mile _ but he
trained runner-up Tuzla until an ownership change sent the mare to
Bob Baffert in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a fresh horse,'' Canani said after his first Breeders'
Cup win. ``It feels great.''
</P>
<P>
   Send Cash: The $520,000 Juvenile Fillies winner's purse comes at
a good time for Cash Run owner Satish Sanan, the India-born
software magnate whose IMRglobal Inc. stock has dived recently.
</P>
<P>
   Sanan admits cash-flow problems and plans to auction off some
weanlings and broodmares next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stock market, you and I don't control it,'' Sanan said.
</P>
<P>
   Along for the ride: Jorge Chavez earned his first Breeders' Cup
victory in 20 tries by hanging on as Beautiful Pleasure set a :22
4/5-:46 2/5-1:09 4/5 pace in the Distaff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew we were going fast,'' said the 37-year-old Peruvian.
``But there was nothing I could do.''
</P>
<P>
   Banshee Breeze, written off by workout clockers, became the
threat in the stretch as favorite Silverbulletday faded at the
rail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just needed to show her my stick and she kept going,''
Chavez said of Beautiful Pleasure, who clinched the
fillies-and-mares championship with her third straight Grade I win.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking Frankelly: Bobby Frankel blamed jockey Kent Desormeaux
for Keeper Hill's fourth-place finish in the Distaff. Keeper Hill
was closer to the pace than usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bad (bleeping) ride,'' the trainer said.
</P>
<P>
   Like a Phoenix: Soaring Softly's victory in the inaugural Filly
and Mare Turf put a new high in trainer Jim Toner's year of highs
and lows. Toner lost three horses in a Belmont Park barn fire in
June.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Soaring Softly) meant a lot to us this year,'' said Toner,
59, after his first Breeders' Cup victory. ``There was so much
adversity, but we always had her to look forward to.''
</P>
<P>
   Golden Gate bought: Frank Stronach announced he has added Golden
Gate Fields, in the San Francisco Bay Area, to holdings that
already included Santa Anita, Gulfstream Park, Remington Park in
Oklahoma and Thistledown in Ohio. He said he has ``expressed
interest'' in Monmouth Park in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The long-rumored Golden Gate Fields purchase from Ladbroke cost
$87 million.
</P>
<P>
   The auto-components magnate and racehorse owner indicated his
tracks won't contribute to the National Thoroughbred Racing
Association until the sport's putative governing body defines a
``clearer mandate.'' The NTRA contracts of 74 NTRA-member tracks
run to April 1.
</P>
<P>
   Also: Fans around the world bet $99.8 million into the
Gulfstream Park pools Saturday, a Breeders' Cup record, beating
last year's. . . . A Lady From Dixie, who would have been a Distaff
long shot, was the only Breeders' Cup scratch. D. Wayne Lukas said
he didn't want to aggravate a tendon problem. . . . Playboy
publisher Hugh Hefner _ with five blondes _ sat near the press box
to watch a colt with his name run 13th in the Juvenile. One of
Hefner's dates stood up during the Filly and Mare Turf and caused
several reporters to miss the race. . . . Nice touch: The Breeders'
Cup jockeys were introduced to the crowd and lined up in the
winner's circle before the first race. . . . ID, please: Frank
Stronach said he was late for a morning press conference because a
Gulfstream Park parking attendant wouldn't let him in. ``It's nice
to know we don't play favorites,'' the track chairman said.

Eyeing a climb in rankings, Kansas State wards off Colorado 20-14
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By DANNY ROBBINS &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
MANHATTAN, Kan. _ With just more than six minutes remaining
Saturday at KSU Stadium, the public address announcer informed the
50,000-plus Wildcats loyalists watching Kansas State play Colorado
that Minnesota had completed its upset of previously unbeaten Penn
State, news that turned Harley Davidson Day into a Night at the
Roxbury.
</P>
<P>
   The Cat people had ample reason to cheer, their undefeated and
sixth-ranked heroes seemingly well on their way to beating
Colorado. But some of those present, particularly those wearing
K-State uniforms, became a little queasy, a feeling that
intensified when Colorado scored on a long pass a moment later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about being in the Dome last year, playing A&AMP;M, and
said, `Please, God, don't let it happen again,''' said K-State
defensive end Monty Beisel.
</P>
<P>
   In a performance remniscent of last year's Big 12 title game,
where the then-unbeaten Wildcats lost a 15-point lead to the Aggies
in St. Louis' Trans World Dome after hearing that UCLA's
unblemished record had been ruined by Miami, K-State let a big lead
slip away against Colorado in the fourth quarter but was able to
hang on for a 20-14 victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats had a 20-0 cushion before the Buffaloes scored on
passes of 64 and 70 yards from Mike Moschetti to Javon Green in the
final 6:21.
</P>
<P>
   Asked later if the Wildcats had recorded an ``ugly'' win,
K-State coach Bill Snyder was not in a mood to argue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was pretty ugly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The K-State offense was beyond ugly at times, producing just 197
yards and 10 first downs. Snyder replaced starting quarterback
Jonathan Beasley with backup Adam Helm one series into the second
half and then went back to Beasley with the game in the balance in
the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the Wildcats' defensive effort was about as
good as it gets. K-State obliterated the Colorado running game,
allowing the Buffs to net only 10 yards, and harassed Moschetti,
sacking him five times and recording three interceptions. Before
Moschetti and Green hooked up on their first scoring play, the
Buffs had recorded only five first downs and had crossed midfield
just two times.
</P>
<P>
   ``We (the K-State defense) played a great game,'' said
linebacker Mark Simoneau, who finished with nine unassisted
tackles, including two sacks. ``Unfortunately, we gave up those two
long plays. That kind of spoils an exceptional game.''
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the Wildcats are 9-0 and due to rise in the
rankings as a result of Penn State's loss, a backdrop that will
increase the stakes when K-State faces Nebraska in Lincoln this
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hadn't really been tested this season when we had a lead,''
said Beisel, whose sack helped stop Colorado's final drive. ``Going
into Nebraska week, we needed something like this.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss drops Colorado to 5-4 and 4-2, although the Buffs
should get their sixth _ and bowl-qualifying _ win at Baylor this
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't run the ball, things cannot happen,'' CU coach
Gary Barnett said. ``The lack of a running game has hurt us all
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the way the K-State defense was swarming, the Wildcats'
20-0 lead looked pretty stout when the PA announcer informed the
purple horde of Minnesota's 24-23 upset of Penn State. But then,
just seconds after the announcement, Moschetti hit Green on a post
route for 64 yards and a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The next K-State series went nowhere and consumed less than two
minutes, giving Colorado the ball at its 30. One play later,
Moschetti connected with Green on a short sideline route, and the
junior receiver shook loose for the 70-yard play that made it
20-14.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had two shots at him that I saw,'' Snyder said. ``It was
really an eight-yard gain. We just missed tackles.''
</P>
<P>
   With Beasley back at quarterback but no more effective than he
had been earlier, K-State again failed to produce a clock-consuming
drive and had to punt.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado got the ball at its 38 with 1:59 remaining. On first
down, Moschetti was sacked by Beisel for a three-yard loss.
Moschetti then threw incomplete three times, allowing K-State to
regain possession with 30 seconds showing.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats would live to play another day as an unbeaten,
although it certainly hadn't been easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know next week we'll have to play a whole lot better,''
Beasley said.

Sanford and run a winning combination for Houston
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JERRY WIZIG &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
With day having turned into night, University of Houston safety
Kenny Hill knew the last play of the game might be coming his way.
And, with Hill's stop of Tulane receiver Kerwin Jones, the Cougars
survived for a 36-31 victory over the Green Wave on Saturday at
Robertson Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Ketric Sanford rushed for 212 yards and two touchdowns while
setting Houston's all-time rushing record. Teammate Mike Green
added 118 rushing yards and another TD. But Hill's 75-yard
interception return for a fourth-quarter touchdown finally proved
to be the difference.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of a wild, sometimes puzzling 3 hours, 33 minutes, UH
had seen Tulane's run-and-shoot-type passing game amass 27
offense-generated first downs and 531 yards on 97 plays against a
Cougar defense ranked 10th nationally. That production came despite
starting quarterback Patrick Ramsey missing most of the fourth
quarter for Tulane with an injured shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsey returned for the final pass from the UH 45, and Hill
dropped Jones at the 27 on fourth down with five seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a long way to go and were out of timeouts, so the
main thing was not to let anyone get behind us and then just make a
sure tackle,'' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   Sanford and Green powered the Cougars (5-4, 2-3 in Conference
USA) to a 27-10 lead early in the third quarter, but the offense
then produced just three first downs and 152 yards in the second
half. Tulane dropped to 3-6, 1-4 but not without a fight to the
finish.
</P>
<P>
   While increasing his career rushing total to 3,424 yards with
former record-holder Chuck Weatherspoon watching from the stands,
Sanford also staged the most productive UH rushing performance
since Jermaine Williams ran for 215 yards against SMU in 1995.
Weatherspoon's career total was 3,247 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get the (rushing) record with all the great running backs
that have been through here really means a lot, as much as anything
I've ever done,'' Sanford said. ``It will take some time for it to
set in. The people don't see the work the offensive line did to
make it possible, and Mike is a big bruiser who comes in there and
makes a lot of guys hesitate to try and hit him.''
</P>
<P>
   UH coach Kim Helton was proud of Sanford, whose 26 career
touchdowns rushing leave him one shy of Weatherspoon's school
record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone could carry the banner of being the
all-time leading rusher with more prestige,'' Helton said. ``He's
everything you want in a student, in a player and in a person.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanford's 63-yard run on the first play after halftime set up
Jason McKinley's 13-yard scoring pass to Brandon Middleton, giving
UH a 17-point lead at the 12:41 mark of the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But Ramsey's 20-yard scoring strike to Jones enabled Tulane to
rally back following punter Casey Roussel's 28-yard pass to Jones
on a fake punt.
</P>
<P>
   A rare fumble by Sanford, his first in 385 carries, receptions
or kick returns over 19 games, then led to an 18-yard touchdown
pass to Adrian Burnette by Ramsey, who completed 26 of 55 for 360
yards on the day. The Wave's second TD in 47 seconds made it a
27-24 ballgame.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Roussel ran down a snap over his head deep in
Tulane's end, turned and kicked the ball through the end zone.
Officials signaled a safety for Houston, then ruled an illegal kick
and awarded UH possession at the 14. The Cougars failed to
capitalize, but, on Tulane's ensuing play, Hill returned a fumble
16 yards for an apparent touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of UH penalties (among 13 for 128 yards in the game)
nullified Hill's TD and the Cougars settled for a 43-yard Mike
Clark field goal and a 30-24 lead with 9:50 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Hill then ended Tulane's next possession with his 75-yard
interception runback, aided by a pair of blocks by Sam Hairston.
But Derrick Joseph, a redshirt freshman who backs up Ramsey,
directed a 70-yard scoring drive, running the final five yards with
2:34 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   More than three hours earlier, the first of Mike James' two
interceptions preceded Sanford's 22-yard burst for the game's
opening score. Green powered for 39 and Sanford gained 29 before
Sanford's three-yard TD run.
</P>
<P>
   Green's eight-yard run made it 20-10 at halftime after Seth
Marler's 48-yard field goal and Ramsey's 12-yard pass to Jones
accounted for Tulane's scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Tulane, playing the Cougars without an injured JaJuan Dawson,
the nation's No. 3 receiver, and starting tailback Toney Converse,
had been outscored 101-14 by Memphis and East Carolina in its
previous two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can lose by one or you can lose by 50, but a loss is still
a loss no matter how good you play,'' Tulane coach Chris Scelfo
said. ``The previous six quarters we were in a funk, but scoring 31
points and moving the ball the way we did against the 10th-ranked
defense in the country is something to point to.''

Timely defense gets Tech past Iowa St.
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By TERRY BLOUNT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
LUBBOCK _ Darren Davis had the football in his hands 874 times over
a span of more than two years without committing a fumble. The Iowa
State tailback was one step away from giving his team the lead over
Texas Tech in the fourth quarter when his amazing streak came to an
end.
</P>
<P>
   Tech linebacker Tim Duffie forced the fumble at the one, and
cornerback Antwan Alexander recovered it in the end zone, ending
the threat and helping the Red Raiders earn a 28-16 victory over
the Cyclones Saturday at Jones Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``That play was huge,'' said Texas Tech coach Spike Dykes.
``Davis just doesn't fumble, so you really have to give our guys
credit. I think we played about as solid a football game as you can
play. A lot of people had given up on this team and sold them out,
but our kids are very resilient.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory by Tech (5-4, 4-2 Big 12) set up a showdown vs.
Texas for the Big 12 South lead next weekend at Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa State (4-5, 1-5) trailed 21-16 Saturday when Davis fumbled
for only the second time in his career. His previous fumble came
against Texas A&AMP;M on Oct. 11, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the play was over, but I guess it was my time to let
it go,'' said Davis, the Big 12's leading rusher with 1,260 yards.
``That hurt really bad, but I have to keep my head up and bounce
back from it. I was just trying to reach for the goal line, and it
came out.''
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of the game still was in doubt until the crowd of
41,691 watched Tech tailback Shaud Williams break free on a 47-yard
touchdown run with 6:47 to play. Williams took a sprint-draw
handoff and headed toward the sideline. It appeared he would be
stopped at the ISU 25, but he cut back across the field and raced
to the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   The man who made the key block on the cut back was Tech
quarterback Rob Peters, who took out two ISU defenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's about the only block I've had,'' said Peters, a Katy
High product. ``I think those guys were falling down, and I just
got in front of them. I was hustling down field, because I know if
you get in front of Shaud, he can make things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Before thwarting Davis in the fourth quarter, the Tech defense
came up with a big goal-line stand in the second. the Raiders led
14-6 when the Cyclones had two chances inside the Tech one.
Surprisingly, Iowa State did not give the ball to Davis on either
play. Quarterback Sage Rosenfels kept it on third down, and
Rosenfels attempted a rollout pass on fourth down that was
deflected by Tech safety Kevin Curtis.
</P>
<P>
   The goal-line stand seemed to inspire the Tech offense, which
marched 99 yards on seven plays to take a 21-6 lead on a 26-yard
pass from Peters to Darrell Jones with 4:14 to go in the first
half.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa State trailed 21-9 at the half, but a seven-yard run by
Davis capped an 83-yard drive in the third quarter to make it
21-16. Davis, who finished with 98 yards on 26 carries, was one
foot away from scoring again when the law of averages caught up
with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our motto is to make the other team put the ball on the
ground,'' said Tech defensive end Taurus Rucker. ``We noticed that
Davis does a lot of spinning, so we felt we could get the ball out
of there. It couldn't have happened at a better time.''

Fresno State displaces Owls in WAC driver's seat 47-18
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By NEAL FARMER &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
FRESNO, Calif. _ There were a lot of words spoken softly in the
Rice locker room on Saturday. The Owls let a key conference road
game get out of hand early and never caught up. And the postseason
ramifications were not lost on the sullen squad in the post-mortem.
</P>
<P>
   Fresno State scored 20 first-quarter points, then cruised to a
47-18 win over the Owls before 39,097 at Bulldog Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs (7-3) took the lead in the Western Athletic
Conference chase away from the Owls, upping their record in the
conference to 4-1. Running back Derrick Ward rushed for 148 yards,
and quarterback Billy Volek threw three touchdown passes in a
12-for-15 day.
</P>
<P>
   The Owls (5-5, 4-2) continued an unfortunate trend of the three
previous years by losing a key conference game on the road late in
the season. Depth-sapping injuries played a factor this time, as
did as poor tackling and the Bulldogs' controlling the line of
scrimmage on both sides of the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Fresno outgained Rice 478 yards to 222. And in a rare occurrence
for the Owls, Rice threw for 123 yards while running for just 99 on
46 carries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm real upset,'' said Rice quarterback Chad Richardson, whose
17 carries netted 11 yards, 62 below his rushing average. ``I just
don't really know what happened. I'll have to look at the film. It
just hurts right now. It's been a dream of mine my whole life to
get to a bowl. We were this close again for four years in a row,
and it's hard to take. I am speechless.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice will have to defeat Texas-El Paso on Saturday at Rice
Stadium to have its sixth win and be bowl-qualified. The Owls also
will have to have someone else beat Fresno to give them a chance at
a tie for the WAC championship.
</P>
<P>
   Rice safety Jason Hebert said he ached after the defeat but that
all is not lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any loss is going to hurt, no matter who it is,'' Hebert said.
``Considering the circumstances, this is a big blow to us. As bad
as it hurts, we have to put it behind us. We need to focus on
getting a winning record.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fresno defense delivered a message to start the game. Rice
started from its 18 after the kickoff and had to punt after three
rushing plays netted minus-three yards.
</P>
<P>
   Fresno took over on its 47 and scored eight plays later when
Volek scored on a one-yard plunge.
</P>
<P>
   Rice then started on its 11-yard line and again had to punt
after three plays netted nine yards. Fresno started its second
possession at its 44 and scored nine plays later on a 20-yard pass
from Volek to running back Paris Gaines for a 14-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The pattern continued. Rice started its third drive at its 20
but had to punt on fourth-and-16 from the 14. Fresno then was
pretty much able to knock out the Owls on its next possession _
which lasted only one play and was as embarrassing as anything the
Rice defense has suffered all year.
</P>
<P>
   On first down from the Rice 49, Volek handed off to wingback
Rodney Wright _ who had gone in motion behind the quarterback and
had taken a similar handoff for a 21-yard gain around end on
Fresno's initial play of the game. This time, however, Wright
stopped in the backfield and lofted a wobbly pass high into the
air. Bulldogs receiver Saleem Mahdi outjumped two Rice defenders to
pull down the ball around the 20, broke a tackle and then scooted
in for a score. The run for PAT failed, but Fresno had a 20-0 lead
and every bit of momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was big, a very big play in the game,'' Hebert said.
``It's plays like that that will kill you. You don't want them to
happen, but you just look past it.''
</P>
<P>
   It typified a poor performance by the Rice defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just didn't tackle well,'' said Owls coach Ken Hatfield.
``That's the most disappointing thing. We didn't get off blocks.
They are big and strong, and that was probably the best running
game they have had all year. We were worn out, and it just seemed
to take its toll on us after 10 weeks. We just couldn't get off
blocks. Our kids were worn out. It looked like they were running in
mud.''
</P>
<P>
   Derek Crabtree kicked a 27-yard field to get Rice within 27-10
with 2:14 remaining in the second quarter. Fresno then fumbled the
ensuing kickoff at its 18 but managed to recover the ball to keep
the Owls from getting anything more before halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Fresno scored on its first possession of the second half, and
the game was over for all intents and purposes.
</P>
<P>
   In trying to keep their chins up, Rice's players remembered they
still have a chance to do next week what hasn't been done since the
1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``To win next week means that our seniors will have winning
seasons in three of their four years,'' Hatfield said, ``and that
hasn't happened in many years (since the Owls had three winning
seasons between 1960-63). So we have a lot to play for.''

Texas A&AMP;M's offense shoots blanks
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By NEIL HOHLFELD &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
LINCOLN, Neb. _ This time, there was no Texas Tech mystique or
Oklahoma spread offense.
</P>
<P>
   This time, it was plain and simple. Texas A&AMP;M was given a good,
old-fashioned rump-kicking by Nebraska. The Cornhuskers pushed the
Aggies around all game long Saturday and ultimately shoved them
into also-ran status in the Big 12 South with a 37-0 victory before
77,705 at Memorial Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies were shut out for the first time in 143 games, since
losing to LSU 27-0 in 1988. Nebraska outgained Texas A&AMP;M 430-118
and turned a 6-0 halftime lead into a rout by piling up 288 yards
and 31 points in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played horrible offense,'' Texas A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum
said. ``We were very inept. We couldn't run the ball, and when we
tried to throw, we couldn't protect (quarterback Randy McCown) long
enough to get the ball off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very disappointed. I have a lot of respect for their
defense, but at the same time we should have been able to perform
better offensively than this.''
</P>
<P>
   With the loss by the Aggies and wins by Texas, Texas Tech and
Oklahoma on Saturday, the Aggies (6-3, 3-3 in the Big 12) were
eliminated from contention for the Big 12 South title, which they
had won the two previous seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies have lost all three of their Big 12 road games this
season, the last two against Oklahoma and Nebraska coming by a
combined score of 88-6.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you don't put any points on the board against any
team, it hurts your pride,'' offensive guard Chris Valletta said.
``We had a lot of three (downs) and outs. There was too much
pressure on Randy, so he couldn't get the ball out to the
receivers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies had a total of two _ count 'em, two _ yards rushing
on 38 carries. Ja'Mar Toombs had 46 yards to lead the Aggies, but
Nebraska sacked McCown eight times for a loss of 64 yards to count
against the rushing total. Nebraska quarterback Eric Crouch had 137
yards rushing and tailback Dan Alexander 135.
</P>
<P>
   McCown, under heavy pressure all day, was 11-of-30 for 116 yards
and was intercepted four times, twice by safety Mike Brown. Five
Texas A&AMP;M turnovers led to 20 Nebraska points.
</P>
<P>
   ``All they did all day was blitz every down,'' McCown said.
``Their secondary is pretty good, but the guys up front forced me
to rush a lot of throws. They had the running lanes clogged up and
made it hard to throw the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   As bad as the blowout was, it could have been worse. The
Cornhuskers twice fumbled the ball inside the Texas A&AMP;M 10-yard
line and kicker Josh Brown missed a 21-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to slap myself when we were fumbling and blowing some
scoring opportunities in the first half,'' Nebraska coach Frank
Solich said. ``Many times, those will come back to haunt you.''
</P>
<P>
   On Nebraska's first play from scrimmage, wingback Bobby Newcombe
fumbled and Texas A&AMP;M linebacker Harold Robertson recovered at the
Nebraska 11-yard line. Three plays later, kicker Terence Kitchens'
28-yard field-goal try was blocked by Kyle Vanden Bosch.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was huge, confidence-wise,'' said Nebraska nose tackle
Steve Warren. ``We gave them the ball in our back yard, and they
were unable to score. I think it was the biggest play of the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cornhuskers moved smartly down the field, gaining 76 yards
on 15 plays and using up six minutes. But Josh Brown's kick from 21
yards hit the left upright, and the game remained scoreless.
</P>
<P>
   In the second quarter, the Aggies had a chance to take the lead
again. After passes from McCown to Chris Cole and Leroy Hodge
helped move the ball to the Nebraska 14, Kitchens tried a field
goal from 31 yards. Kitchens, who hit a 62-yard field goal earlier
this season, had a kick blocked for the seventh time in the last
seven games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, I was thinking about trying to get the ball up,''
Kitchens said. ``In the past, I'd just go out and kick it. I
thought I got the first one up OK. The second one, I'll have to
watch a tape because I'm not sure.''
</P>
<P>
   After the second block, Slocum instructed punter Shane Lechler
and backup kicker Timm Gergeni to kick into the net on the
sideline. However, the Aggies didn't need a kicker the rest of the
game. They didn't score a touchdown, so no extra-point kick was
needed, and they didn't attempt another field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something we've worked on in practice, but the trajectory
was too low again,'' Slocum said. ``I thought we it worked out, but
we didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   After a fumble by Toombs at the A&AMP;M 11, the Cornhuskers finally
got on the board on Josh Brown's 20-yard field goal with 5:29 left
in the second quarter. With just more than one minute left in the
half, McCown's third-and-eight pass from his own three-yard line
was picked off by Mike Brown at the Aggies' 38. He returned to the
18, and Josh Brown kicked a 31-yard field goal to make it 6-0 at
the half.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies were equally horrible in the second half. They had
seven drives in the second half; five ended with a punt and two
with an interception. Texas A&AMP;M's deepest penetration after
halftime was the Nebraska 36.
</P>
<P>
   The Cornhuskers, meanwhile, scored touchdowns on four of their
drives and put the game away by putting up 17 points in the third
quarter to go ahead 23-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made adjustments in the second half, and we came at them
harder and harder,'' Crouch said. ``I think they just wore down as
the game went on.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the game, the Aggies were thoroughly beaten down.
With games left against Missouri and Texas, they will need at least
one win to be a lock for a bowl game. They have six wins and are
bowl-eligible, but a 6-5 team might be on the outside of the bowl
picture.
</P>
<P>
   And that, for a team with designs on a national championship
earlier this season, is a shocking development.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can play better than this, I know we can,'' Toombs said.
``But we can't just get it done in practice and then not do it in
the game.''

Lukas' Breeders' Cup dominance continues
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By ALAN TRUEX &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
HALLANDALE, Fla. _ Saturday's Breeders' Cup was supposed to be Bob
Baffert's show. Or a James Bond thriller. But it was neither.
Instead, it was the Ol' Reliable, D. Wayne Lukas, upstaging and
upsetting everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert, the modish, hip, laid-back Californian, had eight
entrants going for the $13 million in purses at Gulfstream Park. He
had the best 3-year-old filly, Silverbulletday, and the best
2-year-old, Chilukki, and he had the favorite in the Sprint,
Forestry.
</P>
<P>
   All three lost.
</P>
<P>
   And there was Bond, ready to anoint the mighty Behrens as Horse
of the Year. He was favored to win the $4 million Classic.
</P>
<P>
   But Lukas knocked off Chilukki with a 32-1 shot, Cash Run, and
he shot down Behrens with the recycled Cat Thief, who went off at
19-1 for the 1\-mile race.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas, who has won a record 15 Breeders' Cup races, couldn't
resist chortling, ``I guess this Horse of the Year race is turned
upside-down.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Breeders' Cup, which was supposed to resolve the
issue, only created more questions.
</P>
<P>
   The assumption was that if Behrens lost, the mantle would pass
to Silverbulletday, who had won eight of 10 races this year and
$1.71 million in purses, compared with $1.74 million for Behrens.
</P>
<P>
   But Silverbulletday ran like she had lead in her saddlebags. She
finished seventh in the Distaff _ and bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we just tried to get too much out of her,'' Baffert
said. ``I was hoping we could get one more race.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no excuse for Behrens, the 2-1 favorite who never had
finished worse than second in eight starts this year. Bond had
trained him judiciously, passing up chances for fat purses to make
sure he was fresh and fit for this race. But like Silverbulletday,
he ran seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way it goes some days,'' said Bond. ``What can you
do?''
</P>
<P>
   You could do like Lukas and just keep trying new techniques to
bring a horse to his potential.
</P>
<P>
   Cat Thief had been dismissed by most observers as a 3-year-old
colt who could pick up, at most, some place or show money in Grade
I competition. He had won only once in 11 starts this year.
</P>
<P>
   His owner, 82-year-old William T. Young, noted, ``Everyone said
we ran the horse too much and he couldn't run a mile and a
quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukas, 64, said, ``I changed up on this horse a lot. I tried
everything I know to get him to relax. I felt the last three weeks
I finally got the number on this one. You just can't emphasize
enough the experience factor in training horses. You make a lot of
mistakes and you learn from them.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his changes was to apply the latest breathing aid, a
nasal strip. Lukas used it on all his horses Saturday. In fact, 28
percent of the Breeders' Cup horses had nasal strips, and 40
percent of the winners had them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't seen any research on it,'' Lukas said. ``We don't
know if it's good, bad or indifferent. But I figured it couldn't
hurt, so stick them on.''
</P>
<P>
   It may have made a difference in the case of Cat Thief, who had
a tendency to run out of wind after 1[ miles.
</P>
<P>
   In Saturday's Classic, Cat Thief did his usual quick burst to
the front of the pack, but this time he lasted the distance. He
took the lead from the fading Old Trieste at the mile and stretched
out to a 1\-length victory over the steady-running Budroyale.
</P>
<P>
   Cat Thief's jockey, Pat Day, said, ``I don't know what Wayne did
differently to prepare him, but he was much more relaxed today than
he was when I've ridden him before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cat Thief was the perfect gentleman, the picture of composure.
He got some pressure at the half-mile pole, but then he accelerated
for three or four jumps and then just sort of coasted around the
turn. I was concerned that he was using himself too early, but he
was pulling away at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Although his $2 million purse for the Classic makes Cat Thief
the No. 1 North American equine earner of the year, at just under
$3 million, his inconsistency rules out Horse of the Year
consideration.
</P>
<P>
   So who, then?
</P>
<P>
   It was thought that if Behrens and Silverbulletday faltered
Saturday, the next candidates were Lemon Drop Kid, General
Challenge and River Keen. But they finished sixth, 10th and 11th in
the Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Chilukki, owned by Houstonians Bob and Janice McNair, could have
laid claim to the most coveted of racing awards. But her second
place in the Juvenile Fillies won't do it.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas is touting his Kentucky Derby/Preakness Stakes winner,
Charismatic. But voters are reluctant to support a horse who
retired before the year was half-over.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps some consideration will go to Artax, who equaled a track
record with his 1:07.89 for six furlongs in Saturday's Breeders'
Cup Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   Artax recently broke track records set by Dr. Fager and Groovy,
and he's best known for taking a punch from a drunken, disturbed
fan during a race on Preakness Day.
</P>
<P>
   Is that enough to make him Horse of the Year? Well, who's left?

Texas beats Oklahoma St. to the draw
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JEROME SOLOMON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
STILLWATER, Okla. _ When you draw something up, it should look
good.
</P>
<P>
   When you dream about how it will work, it should look even
better.
</P>
<P>
   When Greg Davis' draw (play) met Hodges Mitchell's dream on the
first play from scrimmage in Saturday's Texas-Oklahoma State game,
the result was perfection. And perfection indeed looked good.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell took a handoff from Major Applewhite, exploded off the
left side, spun Cowboys safety Adam Edwards like a top at midfield
and raced 80 yards for a touchdown to give Texas the lead after
just 18 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The run was part of a 20-carry, 149-yard effort by Mitchell, who
scored two other touchdowns to lead Texas to a 34-21 win over
Oklahoma State before 44,025 at Lewis Field.
</P>
<P>
   With the win and Texas A&AMP;M's loss to Nebraska, Texas (8-2, 5-1
Big 12) can clinch the Big 12 South title by beating Texas Tech on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud that this team could focus and not think about Tech
and what that could mean for us,'' Applewhite said. ``We were able
to be focused and play well against a dangerous team, right from
the start.''
</P>
<P>
   It began with Davis, the Longhorns' offensive coordinator, and
his quite unusual call of a draw play to open the game. Typically,
draw plays are set up during a game by a team's passing.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said the Longhorns' penchant for throwing and Oklahoma
State's similar love for blitzing made the play a good call even as
an opener. When Mitchell was told Friday what play would be run to
start the game, he dreamed about it going the distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about that all day that's the power of the mind,''
said Mitchell, who became the eighth Texas back to rush for more
than 1,000 yards in a season. ``It (rushing for 1,000 yards) was a
goal of mine at the beginning of the season, but really I didn't
think I would have that many opportunities. I thought I would have
more yards receiving than rushing.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell does have 29 receptions for 304 yards, making him the
only back in Texas history to post 300 yards receiving and 1,000
yards rushing in the same season. The player many thought could not
replace Ricky Williams has done something Williams never did.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma State pulled even at 7 early in the second quarter on a
seven-yard touchdown run by quarterback Tony Lindsay, but the
Longhorns took the lead for good on Mitchell's 17-yard run just
before the half.
</P>
<P>
   The three-play, 44-yard drive was set up by Aaron Humphrey's
second fumble recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Applewhite hit freshman tight end Bo Scaife and wideout Montrell
Flowers for a gains of 20 and seven yards before Mitchell followed
fullback Ricky Brown and guard Cory Quye around the right side for
the score.
</P>
<P>
   While Mitchell had a good day, OSU could muster no ground game.
Texas' defense controlled the line of scrimmage, giving up just 84
yards rushing on 41 attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Tailback Nathan Simmons managed just 21 yards on nine carries
before leaving with a banged up knee. Jamaal Fobbs had a little
more success, with 57 yards on 10 attempts, but 25 came on one
play.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns had 13 tackles for losses, seven sacks and forced
five fumbles, recovering two. Greg Brown had an interception return
for a touchdown in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's score came on Oklahoma State's first possession after
the half. Humphrey got a piece of a Lindsay pass and Brown stepped
in, bobbled the ball a little but snatched it out of the air and
raced 31 yards for a touchdown to give Texas a 21-7 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking, `Man, I better catch this, or the guys will
kill me,''' Brown said. ``I don't think I would have ever lived
that down. It's been a long time since the Texas defense scored
(1995) and it's good to get us into the end zone.''
</P>
<P>
   In the third quarter, Applewhite (23-of-44, 242 yards) started
finding the mark, completing five straight passes in an eight-play,
65-yard drive, but again Mitchell did the honors and Edwards was
the highlight-film victim.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Mitchell met Edwards in the hole, but spun off him,
leaving him on the ground to put Texas ahead 28-7.
</P>
<P>
   ``That might have been his best run,'' Davis said. ``He read the
hole, broke a tackle, spun away and went in standing up. He is
playing with great confidence. He's just playing extremely well.
He's allowed us to be more patient.''

Kansas overcomes Baylor's fast start
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By W.H. STICKNEY JR. &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
LAWRENCE, Kan. _ After one quarter, the few Baylor fans who made
the trek to Memorial Stadium at the University of Kansas finally
had something to feel good about.
</P>
<P>
   The Bears had matched the first-down total (seven) they achieved
in four quarters of last week's 48-7 loss at Kansas State. They had
bettered their yardage total from that dismal defeat and were
motoring toward the lead, their first in 12 quarters.
</P>
<P>
   By the start of the fourth quarter Saturday, those fans again
were forlorn as the Bears' defense, so strong against the run the
previous two weeks, was destroyed by David Winbush and the
Jayhawks. Baylor surrendered 38 unanswered points in losing 45-10
in a game that pointed up the disarray of the green and gold under
first-year coach Kevin Steele.
</P>
<P>
   Winbush carried 14 times for 111 yards and three touchdowns and
Mitch Bowles had nine carries for 86 and two scores as the Jayhawks
(4-6, 2-4 Big 12) ran for 378 yards, a season high for a Baylor
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been the tale of the season,'' Steele said of the Bears
(0-6, 1-8). ``Holes in the dike. You plug one up and another one
springs out over here. You plug that one up, another one springs
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the state of a rebuilding process in the first year.
And some of them are more severe than others. We inherit what we
have, and that's where we are.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's more important is how we're going to fix it and how
we're going to get there. But the pain of getting there at this
point in time is pretty tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Goodwrench would look over this machine, throw up his hands
and walk away. The Bears put on a textbook display of how not to
play _ on offense, but particularly on defense.
</P>
<P>
   Missed tackles and a lackluster effort characterized all but a
few minutes of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Several halftime adjustments resulted in the Bears giving up
just 76 yards while holding the Jayhawks scoreless in the third
period, but overall Kansas piled up 466 yards to 251 for Baylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of times and opportunities to be out there and
make plays, and we didn't make plays,'' said defensive coordinator
Brick Haley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very disappointed in how we played. The missed tackles
were big for us, and also just letting those guys (Jayhawks) knock
us off the football. I'm very disappointed in that. I know we can
play better than that. I know we're a better defense than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Two mistakes _ a fumble after a pass reception by Larry O'Steen
and a poor decision by safety Samir Al-Amin to run an interception
out of the end zone _ didn't help the Bears when they were still
alive late in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you get penalties and turnovers, it gets you off
track,'' said Steele. ``And that one certainly didn't help any. It
was a midfield turnover, which are the worst kind.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bears got perhaps their best performance of the season in
the first half from quarterback Jermaine Alfred in going on top
10-7. With Alfred throwing for 85 yards and twice converting on
third-and-long, the Bears had 130 total yards and seven first downs
in the opening period.
</P>
<P>
   But the rest of the afternoon belonged to Winbush and the
Jayhawks.

OKLAHOMA HAMMERS MISSOURI AS TIGERS' OFFENSE GOES IN TANK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORMAN, Okla. _ The Oklahoma Sooners brought Missouri into Owen
Field yesterday and conducted a three-hour course in football
futility. All the Tigers passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most embarrassing loss I've encountered in my
whole life,'' said Missouri coach Larry Smith after the Sooners
(5-3, 3-2 Big 12) rolled over the Tigers, 37-0, before a crowd of
74,966. ``Our offense absolutely stunk today. It was the most
pathetic thing I've ever seen in my life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defense fought their butts off. Other than that, I have no
comment.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Tigers (4-5, 1-5), it was a remarkably miserable day.
Everything they attempted _ passing, running, kicking, defending,
or launching desperate fourth-down thrusts, produced a dreadful
result.
</P>
<P>
   In notable contrast, the Sooners' only problem was field-goal
attempts _ they hit one of five. Beyond that, everything worked so
well that in the fourth quarter, Jarrail Jackson returned a punt 70
yards for a touchdown while OU had only 10 players on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, maybe that's a secret weapon for the future,'' said
Jackson, who had 146 yards on six punt returns. ``You think?''
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth quarter, Oklahoma quarterback Josh Heupel (24 of
43, 260 yards, two TDs) was sitting on the bench, thus missing a
shot at his seventh 300-yard game, settling for the Big 12 record
for touchdown passes (25).
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pleased with the way we played today,'' OU coach Bob
Stoops said. ``There were a few things we didn't do, but overall we
played well. The entire starting unit on defense got a game ball
for pitching a shutout, because it's hard to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't something magical, like we had a new defense today.
We just executed.''
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, they overwhelmed the Tigers, who saw a 10-0 deficit
quickly become a rout in the second half and were stopped on
fourth-and-1 four times _ the last with 1:43 remaining at the OU 15
with several Sooners reserves on the field.
</P>
<P>
   Seth Littrell scored the first of his three touchdowns on a
5-yard reception from Heupel in the first quarter for the Sooners'
only first-half touchdown, and Tim Duncan added a field goal _ OU's
only success _ for a 10-point lead in a game still much in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Matters changed abruptly in the second half when Jackson's
42-yard punt return to the 19 set up an eight-yard scoring run by
Littrell. On the second play after the kickoff, linebacker Roger
Steffen picked off a Jim Dougherty pass, returning it 20 yards to
the 11. Heupel then connected with Damien Mackey for a 24-0 lead
with 10:31 remaining in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   It stayed that way until Jackson's punt return made it 30-0
early in the fourth, and Littrell added the final Oklahoma score on
a 26-yard run, capping a 65-yard drive.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, the desperate Tigers turned to freshman
quarterback Justin Gage, who threw three incomplete passes before
Dougherty returned. Gage had been tabbed for a redshirt year.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma had better luck in that regard, as freshman Quenton
Griffin, giving up his redshirt year because of injuries to two
other OU backs, ran 14 times for 69 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little nervous, but I wanted to play,'' he said.
``Coach Stoops came and told me they needed me to help the team,
and that was fine with me.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory moved Oklahoma a game closer to a possible bowl bid
for the first time since 1994, but Stoops would not discuss that
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've still got games to play, a long way to go,'' he said.
``We played well today and really had a great effort, but it
doesn't mean a thing if we can't come back and do it again next
week. We know what we can do when we play well, but we need to be
consistent at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, the consistency was more than enough for the Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a good team, better than we are,'' said Smith. ``But
not 37 points better.''

WILLIAMS, TECH STAY IN SOUTH TITLE HUNT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUBBOCK, Texas _ The South Plains is known for its wide-open
spaces. And after two weeks with little running room elsewhere,
Texas Tech's Shaud Williams again found home on the range.
</P>
<P>
   After being penned for two games, Williams broke loose for 148
yards on 21 carries and scored two touchdowns _ including a
game-clinching 47-yard scoring run _ to lead the Red Raiders to a
28-16 victory over Iowa State.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nice to see some daylight again,'' said Williams, held
to 49 yards on 29 carries in two road games after a 230-yard
performance against Colorado in Jones Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been bottled up these last couple of weeks, but I stayed
patient and I knew things would work out.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory kept Tech (5-4, 4-2) in the thick of the Big 12
South Division race and rejuvenates the Raiders as they prepare to
play division-leading Texas on Saturday in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we've got a chance to go to Texas and play for the Big 12
South championship,'' said Red Raiders linebacker Tim Duffie, who
caused a rare fumble by Cyclones running back Darren Davis that set
up Williams' long scoring run. ``Just like we wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech's defense twice had goal-line stands. The Red Raiders held
on downs at the 1 in the second quarter and scooped up only the
second fumble of Davis' career in the end zone in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Both times the Red Raiders' offense responded.
</P>
<P>
   After safety Kevin Curtis swatted away a fourth-down pass in the
end zone on fourth-and-goal from the 1, Tech drove 99 yards to
score when quarterback Rob Peters connected with split end Darrell
Jones for a 26-yard TD pass and a 21-6 halftime lead. The Red
Raiders drove 80 yards in the fourth quarter after Curtis and
Duffie knocked the ball loose from Davis' grasp at the 1 , and
cornerback Antwan Alexander recovered in the end zone for a
touchback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tech did a great job of capitalizing on our mistakes,'' Iowa
State coach Dan McCarney said. ``We can't get stopped at the 1 two
times and expect to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cyclones also set the stage for two other Tech touchdowns
with mistakes in the kicking game.
</P>
<P>
   Tech overcame an early 6-0 defecit when linebacker Kyle Shipley
recovered a muffed punt by ISU return man J.J. Moses at the ISU 9.
Williams scored on a toss sweep on the next play.
</P>
<P>
   On the next series, Cyclones punter Carl Gomez bobbled the deep
snap and Tech took over at the ISU 23. Peters snuck over from the 1
on third-and-goal for a 14-6 lead with 1:15 left in the opening
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa State drove 83 yards, ending in Davis' 7-yard scoring run
midway of the third quarter and was threatening to take the lead
after linebacker Ab Turner intercepted Peters' tipped pass at the
Tech 31. The Cyclones drove to the 7 five minutes into the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   After Duffie stopped him for a 2-yard loss on first down, Davis
got back to the 4 on the next play. He then ran into heavy traffic
on third down and Duffie's hit caused his first fumble in 707
carries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought \Rthe play was over\S,'' Davis said. ``But I guess
it was my time to let it go. That hurt really bad ... I was trying
to reach for the goal line and \Rthe ball\S came out.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech had just moved to its second first down after the fumble
recovery on a 17-yard pass from Peters to flanker Dee Jackson on
third-and-four when Peters handed off to Williams on a sprint draw.
</P>
<P>
   Williams cut outside at the line of scrimmage and hip-faked ISU
cornerback Ryan Sloth off his feet. Williams cut up the left
sideline, ran back to the middle of the field at the ISU 25 and
left the trailing Cyclones behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I made the move on that cornerback, I was off to the
races,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Dykes followed the play from a sideline vantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Well, he's gonna get down to about the 25.' Then I
saw that right turn take place and I said, `My gosh, here we go.'
And there he went.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams carried with him Tech's off-again, on-again hopes for a
berth in the conference title game.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't realize it, but we still have a chance to win the
Big 12 South,'' Dykes said. ``I know our kids in the locker room
believe it. We look forward to going down to Austin. It should be a
fun game and a real head-knocker.''

FILL-IN SHAW IMPRESSES AS HE GETS COMFORTABLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND _ He is supposed to be this little fill-in, this
temporary replacement to help stop the unexpected bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   When Kobe Bryant broke his right hand in the exhibition opener,
the Los Angeles Lakers signed the well-traveled Brian Shaw. Now
Shaw is struggling to make a case for a full-time gig.
</P>
<P>
   With Bryant not expected back until the end of the month, the
6-foot-6 Shaw is earning a good look from Lakers coach Phil
Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   In the home opener at the Staples Center on Wednesday, Shaw
looked like a veteran beginning to feel comfortable in his new
surroundings. He scored 10 points and had four assists in 20
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brian has a knack of doing things on the move with the
basketball,'' Jackson said. ``He's kind of a driver, penetrator.
He's able to shoot his shot with surprising accuracy at times _
he's streaky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we anticipated going into a big-guard format at
certain times, particularly against a team like (Portland). At some
point he has to be valuable as a lead (point) guard. At this point
he's not quite comfortable enough to do that. But for a guy who's
only been here two weeks, he's doing a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw has spent most of his 10 years in the NBA at the point.
Last season he was picked up by Portland but spent the season on
the injured list. He is all for getting more opportunity at the
point, now the domain of Derek Fisher and Tyronn Lue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having played point guard most of my career, it's almost
easier playing the bigger guards,'' he said. ``The point guard has
the ball all the time and it's usually some little quick guy. If he
makes a move and gets by you on the floor, you're kind of exposed,
but with a bigger guard I feel like I have the advantage because
I'm used to playing shorter, quicker guards.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing, though, is guaranteed for Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see how it goes,'' Jackson said. ``It's an interesting
match for our team.''
</P>
<P>
   About that idle threat: Jackson has managed to keep Dennis
Rodman's name alive as the Lakers have struggled to match up in the
West at power forward, but Rodman and wife Carmen Electra's arrest
in Florida this week for fighting cannot have helped a cause few
others around the Lakers are excited about. Said Jackson: ``He said
it was just one of those things. What things are those? I've never
had one of those things.''
</P>
<P>
   Also: The Blazers tried to rest center Arvydas Sabonis by
starting Rasheed Wallace at center Friday against the Bulls, but
Wallace strained his left groin and sat out Saturday's game....
Jackson said the Lakers would try to run their offense through
ex-Bull Scottie Pippen, well versed in the triangle, instead of
going around him. In the first half, Pippen had 17 points, four
rebounds, two steals and one assist in 20 minutes.

J.R.'S HAPPY HOMECOMING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE IRVINE  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ J.R. Redmond got the opportunity to play football
on Saturday. Redmond, in fact, got to play a lot of football.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Snyder - Redmond's coach at Arizona State - made sure of
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing you have to understand about J.R.,'' Snyder said
after his team extended USC's misery with a 26-16 Pac-10 victory at
the Coliseum, ``is he's probably most natural (and) most
comfortable when he's playing football.''
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, Snyder employed the 6-foot, 220-pound Redmond
as a tailback on 56 plays, a free safety on 29 snaps and as a
special-teams performer 12 times. And when he was through with the
marathon effort, the Carson High graduate, who looked awfully spry
for a player who had just took part in 97 plays, had 148 yards on
34 carries, with touchdown runs of 1, 3 and 14 yards, three catches
for 11 yards, seven punt returns for 39 yards, four tackles and a
wonderful homecoming.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have one of the best football players in the United States
and when he's playing, we're that much better,'' Snyder said.
``That's the most, I think, I've had a player play for me.''
</P>
<P>
   His effort drew plenty of notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Redmond most definitely gets my respect,'' USC linebacker
Markus Steele said.
</P>
<P>
   Then Steele has a lot of company. It's safe to say most of the
53,382 who showed up for USC's homecoming left with a similar
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was supposed to be USC's homecoming,'' Redmond said as he
gazed into the quickly emptying stands searching for family and
friends, ``but it turned into J.R.'s homecoming.''
</P>
<P>
   That sounded pretty good to Arizona State quarterback Ryan
Kealy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he wants it to be his own homecoming then, damn, let it be
his own homecoming,'' Kealy said. ``Because he's the man.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming back home to Southern California particularly to the
Coliseum - has generally brought good results for Redmond. On that
same field a year ago, Redmond had an ASU-best 350 yards on 46
touches in a 35-24 loss to USC.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it is,'' Snyder said. ``But I do know that
he's played, probably, the two best games I've seen him play here
at the Coliseum.''
</P>
<P>
   This trip home, though, was more than just another opportunity
for Redmond to help his team win a football game.
</P>
<P>
   As strange as it sounds, he needed this game as much if not more
than his team needed him. He needed the chance for a post game hug
with his parents - Joseph Redmond and Carolyn Hux than the Sun
Devils needed his 198 total yards and tireless effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just something special about playing in front of
family and friends,'' Redmond said.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a tough couple of weeks for Redmond. He was suspended
by the NCAA and missed last week's 20-17 loss to Oregon for
accepting benefits from an unapproved source. That's a pretty
straightforward way of explaining a situation that is far from that
simple.
</P>
<P>
   The unapproved source is a former part-time employee of the Sun
Devils athletic department, who became Redmond's wife in late
August. At this point, all most of us know about the bizarre tale
comes from Redmond's point of view. The identity of the woman has
not been made public by the university.
</P>
<P>
   There were plenty of the people sitting behind the Arizona State
bench on Saturday who had heard the he-said version of the couple's
relationship and late-summer trip to Las Vegas for a quickie
marriage to avoid the NCAA violations of accepting financial favors
from the woman.
</P>
<P>
   ````I heard a lot of comments (Saturday) that I don't care to
repeat,'' Redmond said. ``I expected that. It was just angry fans
being angry fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Redmond, who filed for divorce last week, declined discussing
the situation any further, saying simply, ``I've learned quite a
bit the past few weeks and want to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder said: ``He's had to deal with things at his age that I
certainly never did and will never have to,'' Snyder said.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, Redmond, who turned 22 on Sept. 28, could have solved
some problems with an off-season decision. He would have been a
high first-round draft choice if he would have chosen to flee Tempe
after his junior season. But, his loyalty to Snyder won out over
becoming financially stable for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Ankle and shoulder injuries have slowed him down in his final
season as a Sun Devil, but Redmond still entered Saturday with 959
all-purpose yards and nine touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does so much more than run the ball,'' Kealy said. ``He
lifts the team on his shoulders and carries us.''

EISNER HELPS PROMOTE GRADUATIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Jesse Hiestand  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Michael Eisner, chairman and chief executive of
The Walt Disney Co., stepped to the concrete porch of a small green
house near Los Angeles to personally deliver a contract to
Victoriano Lopez and his 11-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   At stake was a pact that could set the boy on a path to a bright
future, one grounded not in instant stardom or movie glory, but the
promise of a good education and a better shot at college.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez and his son Victoriano Jr. a sixth-grader at San Fernando
Middle School about 20 northwest of downtown Los Angeles, gladly
signed the contract, adding their names to the dozens who joined a
scholarship and study program called Project GRAD, for Graduation
Really Achieves Dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good opportunity for the kids to have a closer
relationship with their teachers,'' the boy's father said.
</P>
<P>
   Eisner and nearly 900 volunteers _ students, teachers, parents
and community leaders _ fanned out into the neighborhood around San
Fernando High School Saturday for a Walk For Success, the project's
first foray into Los Angeles after finding success in other states.
</P>
<P>
   In small teams, the volunteers set out to pitch the program at
the doorsteps of some 3,400 sixth- and ninth-graders in the school
cluster, which has low rates of graduation and college attendance.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to raise the rate at which San Fernando High School
students attend four-year colleges, from just 14 percent now to
perhaps 50 percent or more.
</P>
<P>
   As an incentive, all ninth-graders are guaranteed a scholarship
of up to $6,000 and possibly more if they meet the program's
requirements, which are laid out in a one-page contract signed by
both the student and their parent.
</P>
<P>
   By signing it, the students vow to graduate with at least a 2.5
overall grade-point average, complete all of the University of
California eligibility requirements, take the SAT and other exams
and participate in various Project GRAD programs, among other
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ``It offers a chance for all students to turn their dreams into
reality,'' Eisner said at a morning pep rally for the volunteers.
``All of us _ educators, parents and the whole community _ have the
responsibility to provide them with the proper environment and
support to become learners.''
</P>
<P>
   Eisner backed up that sentiment with a $1 million grant through
his charitable foundation. That boosted the project's scholarship
pool to more than $6 million, most of which came from federal
grants.
</P>
<P>
   Given their age, the sixth-graders are not offered a college
scholarship. Instead they sign contracts that encourage them to
work hard in school, while their parents promise to get more
involved in their children's education by reading to them and going
to parent-teacher conferences.
</P>
<P>
   Project GRAD was founded in Houston, Texas, in 1993 by Jim
Ketelsen, retired chief executive of Tenneco Inc. The program has
since been expanded to schools in Atlanta, Ga., Nashville, Tenn.,
and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Eisner in the walk were state Sen. Richard Alarcon,
D-Van Nuys; Assemblyman Tony Cardenas, D-Panorama City; and Los
Angeles City Councilman Alex Padilla.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a false promise _ it is a guarantee that the first
$6,000 and possibly $12,000 or more will belong to you if you put
your best foot forward and say, I will live my dreams,'' Cardenas
told the volunteers, most of whom are seniors and were thus not
eligible for the scholarships but offered their time anyway.

</P>
<P>
   As an incentive, all ninth-graders are guaranteed a scholarship
of up to $6,000 and possibly more if they meet the program's
requirements, which are laid out in a one-page contract signed by
both the student and their parent.
</P>
<P>
   By signing it, the students vow to graduate with at least a 2.5
overall grade-point average, complete all of the University of
California eligibility requirements, take the SAT and other exams
and participate in various Project GRAD programs, among other
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ``It offers a chance for all students to turn their dreams into
reality,'' Eisner said at a morning pep rally for the volunteers.
``All of us _ educators, parents and the whole community _ have the
responsibility to provide them with the proper environment and
support to become learners.''
</P>
<P>
   Eisner backed up that sentiment with a $1 million grant through
his charitable foundation. That boosted the project's scholarship
pool to more than $6 million, most of which came from federal
grants.
</P>
<P>
   Given their age, the sixth-graders are not offered a college
scholarship. Instead they sign contracts that encourage them to
work hard in school, while their parents promise to get more
involved in their children's education by reading to them and going
to parent-teacher conferences.
</P>
<P>
   Project GRAD was founded in Houston, Texas, in 1993 by Jim
Ketelsen, retired chief executive of Tenneco Inc. The program has
since been expanded to schools in Atlanta, Ga., Nashville, Tenn.,
and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Eisner in the walk were state Sen. Richard Alarcon,
D-Van Nuys; Assemblyman Tony Cardenas, D-Panorama City; and Los
Angeles City Councilman Alex Padilla.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a false promise _ it is a guarantee that the first
$6,000 and possibly $12,000 or more will belong to you if you put
your best foot forward and say, I will live my dreams,'' Cardenas
told the volunteers, most of whom are seniors and were thus not
eligible for the scholarships but offered their time anyway.

USC'S NIGHTMARE CONTINUES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC's bowl hopes, an absurd idea in retrospect,
officially vanished Saturday, but that doesn't mean there isn't one
goal remaining in this increasingly grotesque season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we're fighting not to be the worst team in the Pac-10,''
freshman wide receiver Kareem Kelly said. ``I never thought that
coming into this program.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither did anyone else, but after USC lost its fifth
consecutive game of the season, a 26-16 setback to Arizona State
before 53,382 at the Coliseum, it's hard to imagine the Trojans
winning another game.
</P>
<P>
   How does 3-9 grab you?
</P>
<P>
   That's a real possibility, because USC is not only losing, it is
confused. Nobody seems to know what is going on. Not the players.
Not the coaches. Nowhere was this more evident than USC's
quarterback crisis _ uh, controversy _ as neither starter John Fox
nor Mike Van Raaphorst could generate any offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what we'll do at quarterback,'' USC coach Paul
Hackett said afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, making his first start in two years, was asked if he knew
he would be relieved early in the third quarter and never return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think as a player I'm supposed to know,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Across the way, Kelly was more surprised _ or forthcoming _ than
Fox that the fifth-year senior received such an early hook.
</P>
<P>
   ``That shocked me a lot,'' Kelly said. ``I don't know what
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   After five losses, the Trojans (3-6, 1-5) do know one thing:
Things can get a lot uglier. For the first time all season, USC
appeared as if it were resigned to losing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like the more we lose, the worse we play,'' wide
receiver R. Jay Soward said. ``We give up a touchdown and it's
like, ``Oh, we lost the game. Can we get this over with?'''
</P>
<P>
   It's not a radical idea, considering the offense put in its
usual 10-point effort.
</P>
<P>
   Some Trojans wondered why they didn't score more points.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, who caught nine passes for 170 yards last week, had only
two balls thrown in his direction in the first half, and finished
with 51 yards receiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some games have a lot of plays designed for me and the next
week I'm not a factor. I'm like a decoy,'' Kelly said. ``The plays
weren't really designed to me. It's not really my place to question
the coaches.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what fans are for, especially when the Trojans' offense
consisted of a first-quarter scoring drive and defensive tackle
Ennis Davis' 30-yard interception for a touchdown. The offense also
managed to set up an Arizona State touchdown, as Fox was
intercepted by Kenny Williams in the second quarter, who returned
it to the USC 1-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   But the defense doesn't exactly deserve to be let off the hook.
It never figured out how to cover tight end Todd Heap (seven
receptions, 100 yards). Heap made one of the game's biggest plays,
when he caught a 37-yard pass over free safety David Gibson on a
fourth-and-1 situation that put the Sun Devils at the USC 3 and put
Arizona State ahead 19-7.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just had coverage problems and tried to work something out
after the half with the tight end, but they came up with something
new,'' linebacker Markus Steele said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Sun Devils tailback J.R. Redmond was having his way
with USC again, rushing for 148 yards and three touchdowns. That
was actually an improvement. Last year, he rushed for 214 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett was left discussing the quarterback position, which
seems weaker today than at any time this season.
</P>
<P>
   `` The feeling was that (Van Raaphorst) could give us a
change-up, but that wasn't what we needed either,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Was there ever a chance Fox would come back in?
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about it a couple times, but the feeling was we were
going back and forth and Mike had a little bit of a feel,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line: It just added up to a sour homecoming for the
Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're supposed to be out partying on homecoming,'' Soward
said. ``Instead we're going home moping and soaking our sores away
in the bathtub.''
</P>
<P>
   Got your tickets for the Louisiana Tech game the day after
Thanksgiving?

SHAQ EJECTED AS LAKERS LOSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND _ It seems in this new adventure of a Lakers season,
the learning will not be left just to the players, although there
were plenty of lessons for them Saturday night in their 97-82 loss
to the Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   The big showdown between the West Conference teams who would be
king briefly turned heated in the fourth quarter when Lakers center
Shaquille O'Neal was ejected for his second technical in less than
a minute.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, O'Neal left without comment but Lakers coach Phil
Jackson blasted the officials, which will no doubt draw the
attention today of NBA headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal was getting hammered by rotating Blazers, a pattern
unfortunately familiar to O'Neal but apparently new to Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' 7-1, 330-pound center picked up his second technical
after he was bumped hard by Portland's Jermaine O'Neal. Shaquille
O'Neal then shoved the ball into the Jermaine's chest.
</P>
<P>
   The O'Neals went face-to-face and exchanged some macho looks and
expressions, but no blows were thrown, probably much to the
betterment of Jermaine O'Neal's health plan, since he weighs some
80 pounds less.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really disappointed in the refereeing tonight,'' Jackson
said. ``I thought they were awful. To let Shaq be attacked like
that, and then make him the villan for that situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, these guys are jumping on his back and basically
flagrantly fouling him and then he simply puts the ball in the
guy's chest after he beats him across the face, and they call him
for a tech on it and run him out of the game. The game was a
seven-point game at that time, and he was basically the force
behind our game, and to eliminate him took the game out of hand.
That was unfortunate for us.''
</P>
<P>
   When Shaquille O'Neal went with the team to the bench on the
ensuing timeout he was still hot, barking heatedly at assistant
coach Jim Cleamons when questioned about throwing the ball at
Jermaine. Ron Harper wrapped his arms around O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers were up 77-70 when O'Neal was ejected. Then Portland
center Arvydas Sabonis suddenly re-entered the game and scored 11
consecutive points for the Blazers. The Lakers were answering with
only a John Salley inside hoop, and Portland was on the way to an
easy win.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson may have been upset with the officials, but also
disappointed that O'Neal had lost his cool, and possibly cost them
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I let him know after the game how unhappy I was with the fact
that he did not contain himself in the game,'' Jackson said.
``That's his responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the responsibility of the referees to contain the
ballgame and to make this a legitimate thing. I mean, what did
Portland do, send four guys out there to foul out of the ballgame?
</P>
<P>
   ``I just saw the way they were throwing bodies at him just to
make sure that he wouldn't score a basket. Anybody else who got hit
like that, it would be a flagrant foul. I mean, it's pretty obvious
they're not playing the ball. All they're trying to do is knock him
down. So he has a right to have a retaliation through his game, the
way they're playing against him. That still doesn't give him a
legitimate excuse to walk out of the ballgame by giving a flagrant
foul. That's what it was about.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers got 19 points (17 in the first half), eight rebounds
and five assists from Scottie Pippen. Sabonis finished with 17
points, as did Damon Stoudamire, who constantly posted up Tyronn
Lue.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal left with 21 points and 10 rebounds, but not much help.
Glen Rice cooled off with 14 points and Lue added 12 off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lakers hit only 50 percent of their free throws (17 of
34) and were outrebounded (40-39) despite the Blazers playing
without their two respected power forwards.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Grant is on the injured list with a sore knee and Rasheed
Wallace was a late scratch with a strained groin.

KINGS LOSE STUMPEL, GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The wheels continued to come off the Kings joyride
Saturday when they lost top center Jozef Stumpel for three months
because of surgery to repair a hernia.
</P>
<P>
   The news came just hours before the Kings much-anticipated game
with the Philadelphia Flyers, a matchup of two of the NHL's hottest
team that was played in front of a capacity crowd of 18,118 at
Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   But without Stumpel and Luc Robitaille, who learned Friday he is
out at least three weeks with a broken left foot, the Kings'
unbeaten streak ended at six games with a 5-3 loss.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Flyers' ninth win in 11 games, but it never was much
of a game after the Kings tied it at two late in the first period.
They just didn't have the firepower to match up with the Flyers.
Robitaille was the Kings leading goal scorer with 10, and Stumpel
the club's top assist man with 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly is a great loss, but it will be a test of what we
are trying to do here,'' general manager Dave Taylor said. ``We
went through this last year and didn't do well. We feel we are
better prepared this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, the Kings lost goalies Stephane Fiset and Jamie
Storr during the fourth game of the season and won just two of the
next 16 games.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Kings were 9-3-3 before Robitaille and Stumpel
went down and were tied with San Jose for the most points (21) in
the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously you don't want to have this type of injury,
especially when the team is on a roll,'' Stumpel said. ``It's kind
of bad, but I believe the team is going to continue to play well. I
hope the injury does not interrupt what we are doing as a team.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of having Robitaille and Stumpel on the first line and
the power play, the Kings were forced to play rookies Jason Blake
and Marko Tuomainen with their top unit.
</P>
<P>
   Their energy in practice won them the jobs and Tuomainen scored
a power-play goal in the first period against the Flyers that tied
the game at two. But it was clearly not enough. The Kings were
outshot 14-2 and 26-9 during two spans in the first two periods.
</P>
<P>
   They picked it up in the third when Ziggy Palffy, the only
remaining member of the first line, scored midway through. But it
was not enough against Philadelphia, which got goals from five
different players and none of them captain Eric Lindros.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Johnson, the Kings third-line left-winger scored first
with goal at the 3:46 of the first period. But the Kings quickly
trailed on goals by Miakel Andersson and Mark Recchi less than
three minutes apart.
</P>
<P>
   Tuomainen, playing for the first time in six games after taking
a stick in the eye, tied the game at 2-2 with a power-play goal on
a cross-ice pass from Palffy with 1:50 left in the period. But by
the time Palffy got his goal, the Flyers scored three more goals
and staked goalie John Vanbiesbrouck to a 5-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Like Robitaille, Stumpel underwent an MRI on Thursday when the
team returned from its three-game Midwest road trip. He said he
isn't sure when he first suffered a hernia. But he struggled with
the injury last season when he was limited to 13 goals and 64
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started to feel it in my groin and it has been going to my
stomach lately,'' Stumpel said. ``I have had problems with my back
and my hip flexor since last season started. It felt good during
the summer, but once I started skating, it started to hurt again.
It's early in the season and I should be back to finish what we
started.''

HACKETT'S QB STRATEGY IS ODD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Forgive us if we're beginning to sound as
repetitious as the USC marching band.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans' troupe can strike up ``Conquest'' until the
trombonists are blue in the face and it doesn't matter. The
football team lost for the fifth consecutive week Saturday and
looked so disorganized in doing so _ its offense sabotaging a
victory over Arizona State every which way _ the background ditty
for this 1999 season is fast becoming Inquest.
</P>
<P>
   The detailed inquiry this time centered on the USC coaching
staff's collective decision to give both its healthy quarterbacks
substantial playing time in the 26-16 loss that assured the Trojans
(3-6, 1-5) of no better than a .500 season.
</P>
<P>
   Second-year coach Paul Hackett started John Fox over Mike Van
Raaphorst at the suggestion of offensive coordinator Hue Jackson,
then played Van Raaphorst all but one series in the second half
while Fox stood on the sidelines with his helmet on, the better we
think to hide the steam that had to be coming out of his ears.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was Hackett's end-of-the-world strategy, borrowed from
Noah: When staring at a washout of epic proportions, pair
quarterbacks off.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett rationalized his decision to pull Fox after the first
series of the third quarter in favor of the quarterback whose
effectiveness he had spent most of the previous two weeks
questioning.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you play a new quarterback, sometimes the fine-tuning
isn't there,'' Hackett said. ``We made the change to Mike because
the feeling was Mike had a little bit of a feel. We thought he'd
give us a change-up.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Trojans were the ones thrown off-balance. Fox and
Van Raaphorst collectively connected on 56 percent of their passes
for zero touchdowns, averaged nine yards a completion and were
intercepted thrice.
</P>
<P>
   Since even before starting quarterback and designated savior
Carson Palmer was sidelined with a broken collarbone, Hackett has
managed to do the very thing the other Pac-10 coaches spent all
summer worrying would be impossible: He has stopped the Trojans'
speedy receiving corps in their vapor tracks.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans now find themselves in an untenable position. They
have three games remaining and two demoralized quarterbacks, a 3-2
count that's not conducive to advancing the offense.
</P>
<P>
   If Hackett were smart, he'd listen to senior receiver R. Jay
Soward, who made perfect sense to us when he said, ``At this point
I think we need to focus on one guy and go with him. If he throws
10 interceptions, so what?''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, what do the Trojans have to lose, besides three more
games?
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't as if either quarterback was completely inept. Fox
completed a pretty 56-yard pass to senior Windrell Hayes and three
plays later lofted a catchable ball to Soward in the end zone that
Soward lost when he languidly one-handed the pass.
</P>
<P>
   Van Raaphorst completed a third-down pass to Kareem Kelly in the
third quarter and in the fourth quarter hooked up with Hayes on an
18-yard pass.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's not that either quarterback is incapable of finding
his rhythm; maybe neither is getting enough time to locate it.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, two weeks removed from linebacking duty, marched the
Trojans 10 plays for a touchdown the second time USC had the ball
for the game's opening score. That was as good as it would get for
Trojan fans in the second-smallest Homecoming crowd of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   On USC's first drive of the second quarter, Fox threw an
interception from inside his own 20 that Sun Devils cornerback
Kenny Williams ran to the USC 1 to set up the first of three scores
by senior J.R. Redmond. The very next series, Fox moved the chains
39 yards before ceding the hot seat to David Newbury, who missed a
47-yard field goal that would have cut ASU's lead to three.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Fox trotted out of the pocket at the first sign his
No. 1 receiver was covered. Instead of scrambling to find any open
man downfield, he did a lot of scrambling for daylight. His
teammates couldn't blame him for feeling uncomfortable under the
Sun Devils' scorching blitz, considering Fox was the blitzer
instead of the blitzee a scant three weeks earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a couple of weeks ago he was a linebacker,'' senior
tailback Chad Morton said of Fox. ``It might be hard to make that
adjustment.''
</P>
<P>
   While Fox was busy compiling the second-highest rushing numbers
on the team, Kelly was running free in the Sun Devils' secondary
and getting very frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, who had nine catches and one score the previous week
against California, had no catches in a first half that saw
second-string tailback Malaefou MacKenzie snag three passes.
</P>
<P>
   The fabulous freshman on this day was nothing more than a decoy.
``I guess my role this game wasn't to get too many passes,'' Kelly
said.
</P>
<P>
   It says here it's Hackett's role to pick one quarterback and
stick with him.
</P>
<P>
   It's the only chance the Trojans have of ending the season on a
high note. &QL;

 RUNNING RAMPANT IN NEAR-URBAN WILDERNESS-LADN 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Troy Anderson  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Los Angeles) -- Opening the evidence freezer for the state
Department of Fish and Game in a city about 45 miles north of Los
Angeles, Warden Steve Ulrich pointed with disgust to the frozen
remains of wild animals, all killed by poachers.
</P>
<P>
   They included a wild pig confiscated recently from two poachers
from Glendale just northwest of downtown Los Angeles, a deer that a
hunter from nearby North Hollywood shot illegally, and a package of
feathers from a wild turkey killed out of season.
</P>
<P>
   In the nation's second-largest metropolitan area, poaching has
fast become a major problem, with 12 of every 100 poaching
violations statewide occurring in Los Angeles County last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poaching is going on more than people realize here,'' Ulrich
said. ``I'd estimate we don't hear about 99 percent of the poaching
happening. There are so few of us, we'd be lucky to catch 1 percent
of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent poaching cases include a man wardens call ``Trash Can
Joe'' who wardens said was caught trying to poach black bear in the
forest above Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   There also was the case of two Glendale residents accused of
shooting a wild pig in Monterey County, and archers who stalk deer
at the reservoirs and a cemetery in Los Angeles' San Fernando
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, wardens issued 1,818 poaching violations countywide
last year, mostly for fishing violations, but the figure includes
57 hunting cases. These range from the illegal use of lights to
stun deer to the illegal sale of bear organs, an Asian delicacy
thought to cure arthritis, gastric disturbances and a range of
ailments.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the proximity of millions of people, an incredible
variety of wildlife thrives in the hills and mountains around Los
Angeles in numbers far surpassing mountainous areas elsewhere in
the state, according to Lt. Warden Terry Hodges, who has written
three books on the adventures of California game wardens.
</P>
<P>
   ``These same city wardens deal with more outlaw hunters and
fisherman than most wardens elsewhere,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Driving much of this near-urban poaching is the market for
animal parts like bear gall bladders, wild meats and abalone that
sell for thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commercialization of wildlife is a serious problem,''
Ulrich said. ``That is the biggest problem with poaching in the
city.''
</P>
<P>
   Poaching in California is a $100-million-a-year business, an
extremely lucrative enterprise, wardens said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's big business,'' said Fish and Game Warden Capt. Jerry
Spansail, who supervises inland wardens in Los Angeles and Orange
counties. ``In some places it's more lucrative than narcotics.''
</P>
<P>
   Even among wardens, the man they call ``Trash Can Joe'' is a
legend. The licensed hunting guide earned his nickname after he was
arrested for shooting an arrow into a bear rooting around in a
trash dumpster a few years ago, wardens said.
</P>
<P>
   But that man, John Joseph Clay, referred to himself as ``Black
Robinhood,'' Ulrich said. While serving a search warrant at his
home after the trash can incident, wardens discovered a stack of
business cards, which read: ``Black Robinhood Guide Service _
Trophy Bear and Deer Hunts,'' Hodges said.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 19, 1998, following a tip, Ulrich and Warden Mike Conely
discovered Clay's bait pile of doughnuts and rotten meat in the
Angeles National Forest above Los Angeles, Hodges said.
</P>
<P>
   On the platform 18 feet up a tree, he had an ice chest with
beer, a charcoal barbecue, food and ``glow sticks,'' chemical light
generating devices, Hodges said.
</P>
<P>
   The wardens hid in the brush and watched as Clay returned with a
bow and arrow and began to add to his bait pile, hanging a glow
stick above it.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Conely came out of the brush and ordered Clay to come
down. He did so but not before placing a blanket over the barbecue,
starting a fire in the tree as a diversion, Hodges said.
</P>
<P>
   Conely climbed up and doused the fire with ice water and beer.
He discovered a loaded .38 caliber revolver.
</P>
<P>
   Clay pleaded guilty to misdemeanor counts of unlawful hunting
and possession of a concealed weapon, said Deputy District Attorney
Maureen O'Brien. He was sentenced to 30 days in jail, fined $4,050,
ordered to pay $2,000 restitution and told not to hunt and
advertise himself as a hunting guide for three years, O'Brien said.
</P>
<P>
   If they can't find the animal they want in the hills around Los
Angeles, they will travel.
</P>
<P>
   Glendale residents Artak Oktanian and Vagan Abgaryan were
arrested on suspicion of shooting a wild pig on a private ranch in
Monterey County and returning to Glendale with the animal in the
back of their Jeep, Ulrich said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was still alive, just barely,'' Ulrich said. ``That pig
suffered for four hours. They were going to eat it.''
</P>
<P>
   They are accused of hunter trespass and unlawful possession of a
wild pig, Monterey County Warden Jim Solis said, adding the case
has not gone to court yet.
</P>
<P>
   Solis estimates he arrests about 50 Glendale and North Hollywood
residents a year in Monterey County who hunt the pigs without
licenses, on private lands or with spotlights.
</P>
<P>
   ``There does seem to be an inordinate amount of people from
Glendale and North Hollywood,'' he said, explaining that wild pig
apparently is a popular dish. ``I've heard they are pretty fond of
the pigs.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, Ulrich and other wardens have investigated
deer poaching in the hills above Sylmar, spearfishing and net
fishing in Big Tujunga Creek and Castaic Lake and the sale of bear
gall bladders in the San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   By far, deer poaching is the most prevalent.
</P>
<P>
   Hunters were caught recently at the Encino Reservoir with rifles
and another time workers found blinds used by bow hunters,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Wardens now have a new weapon in the fight against poachers:
``Robo-Deer,'' the robotic decoy wardens use in sting operations to
catch poachers.
</P>
<P>
   The decoy features a turning head and twitching tail, which from
a distance looks like the real thing. Hunters use lights at night
to stun the deer, a practice called spotlighting or jack-lighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have quite a few deer poachers around here,'' Ulrich said.
``We put the decoys up and usually every night someone will shoot
one. I'd say about one in 25 cars will shoot at them.''
</P>
<P>
   WHO TO CALL
</P>
<P>
   Wardens ask anyone with information about poachers to call (888)
DFG-CALTIP.

SHAQ EJECTED, JACKSON ANGRY AS LAKERS LOSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND _ It seems in this new adventure of a Lakers season,
the learning will not be left just to the players, although there
were plenty of lessons for them Saturday night in their 97-82 loss
to the Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   The big showdown between the Western Conference teams who would
be NBA king briefly turned heated in the fourth quarter when Lakers
center Shaquille O'Neal was ejected for his second technical in
less than a minute.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, O'Neal left without comment, but Lakers coach Phil
Jackson blasted the officials, which will no doubt draw the
attention today of NBA headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal was getting hammered by rotating Blazers, a pattern
unfortunately well familiar to O'Neal but apparently a news item to
Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' 7-foot-1, 330-pound center picked up his second
technical after he was hit hard by Portland's Jermaine O'Neal.
Shaquille O'Neal then shoved the ball into the Jermaine's chest.
</P>
<P>
   The O'Neals went face-to-face and exchanged some macho looks and
expressions, but no blows were thrown, probably much to the
betterment of Jermaine O'Neal's health plan, what with him weighing
some 80 pounds less. The first technical on Shaq was for throwing
an elbow at Jermaine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really disappointed in the refereeing tonight,'' Jackson
said. ``I thought they were awful. They let Shaq be attacked like
that, and then make him the villain for that situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, these guys are jumping on his back and basically
flagrantly fouling him and then he simply puts the ball in the
guy's chest after he beats him across the face, and they call him
for a tech on it and run him out of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   When Shaquille O'Neal went with the team to the bench on the
ensuing timeout he was still upset and barked heatedly at assistant
coach Jim Cleamons when questioned about throwing the ball at
Jermaine. Ron Harper wrapped his arms around O'Neal to try and cool
him down.
</P>
<P>
   What a day for learning. Jackson may have to learn how teams
pound on O'Neal, Cleamons when the right time to instruct him, and
O'Neal to keep his poise.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers were up 77-70 when O'Neal was ejected. Then Portland
center Arvydas Sabonis suddenly re-entered the game and scored 11
consecutive points for the Blazers. The Lakers were answering with
only an outmatched John Salley inside hoop, and Portland was on the
way to an easy win.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Shaq left the game, it seemed the right time to feature
(Sabonis) in the offense,'' said Blazers coach Mike Dunleavy.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was upset with the officials, but the Lakers were also
disappointed O'Neal had lost his cool and possibly cost them a
victory in what had otherwise been a struggle of a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I let him know after the game how unhappy I was with the fact
that he did not contain himself in the game,'' Jackson said.
``That's his responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the responsibility of the referees to contain the
ballgame and to make this a legitimate thing. I mean, what did
Portland to, send four guys out there to foul out of the ballgame?
</P>
<P>
   ``I just saw the way they were throwing bodies at him just to
make sure that he wouldn't score a basket. Anybody else who got hit
like that, it would be a flagrant foul. It's pretty obvious they're
not playing the ball. All they're trying to do is knock him down.
So he has a right to have a retaliation through his game, the way
they're playing against him. That still doesn't give him a
legitimate excuse to walk out of the ballgame by giving a flagrant
foul.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal left with a game-high 21 points and 10 rebounds, but no
one else picked up the slack. Glen Rice cooled of with 14 points,
and Tyronn Lue added 12 off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   But despite playing without either of their two formidable power
forwards _ Brian Grant is on the injured list with a sore knee and
Rasheed Wallace was a late scratch with a strained groin _ the
Blazers had too much balance for the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Scottie Pippen led them with 19 points, but Damon Stoudamire and
Sabonis each added 17, and Bonzi Wells an unexpected 12 off the
bench (all in the first half).
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers shot just 50 percent from the line (17 of 34).
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have played a lot better, without question,'' said
Lakers forward A.C. Green. ``We have to play better on the road. We
have to keep our poise and do the little things. We're a better
team.''

CELTICS KNOCKED OFF PACE

<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ New building, business as usual. Do you get the
feeling that these teams could meet in a shirts-and-skins game in a
driveway in Des Moines and the result would still be the same?
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics' unblemished record is history, but their futility
with the Indiana Pacers remains, well and aggravating.
Saturday &UR;  &LR; night, in the opening event at spectacular Conseco
Fieldhouse, the Pacers weathered a late Celtics blitz to take a
115-108 victory. For those of you still able to keep count at home,
the Pacers have now won 10 straight from Boston, including all
eight under Larry Bird's stoic stewardship.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana got a big game from Reggie Miller (29) and then held off
the Celtics with timely contributions from everyone from Al
Harrington to Austin Croshere. The Pacers also were killers from
international waters, knocking down 10 3-pointers, eight in the
first half. Miller ended up with four.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the dagger in our heart,'' coach Rick Pitino said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't defend the three. We dug ourselves a big hole (down
15 at the break) and we did come back,'' said Kenny Anderson, who
had 20 points for the 3-1 Celtics. ``If we just had been able to
keep it at six or eight . . .''
</P>
<P>
   But they didn't until it was too late. The Celtics left knowing
they shot 52.5 percent, held their own on the boards (39-38), and
still couldn't find a way to beat this team. Antoine Walker led
Boston with 21 points, but he needed 23 shots and had only one
assist. The Celtics' ball movement, crisp and efficient in their
first two games, has been less so in the last two.
</P>
<P>
   But, as the numbers above show, offense was not the problem. The
inability to stop the trey in the first and the inability to make
the key defensive stop down the stretch was critical. The Celtics
got to within 5 in the last four minutes, but that was as close as
Indy would allow. A 3-point play by Rik Smits and a Miller leaner
kept the Pacers afloat, their streak against Boston intact.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if it was still special beating his old team, Bird said,
``I'd say a little bit. Actually, I'd rather beat them than anyone
in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   The overall conditions going into the game were anything but
promising for the Celtics. They were playing their fourth game in
five days _ including the night before, while Indiana was off _ and
the Pacers were opening Conseco amid great fanfare. They brought in
most of the top 50 Indiana hoop legends of all time, including
Oscar Robertson, Walt Bellamy, and John Wooden.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that,'' said Eric Williams, ``and we still almost made
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But they didn't. Again. You have to go back to the 1994-95
season to excavate the last Celtics' win here. And when the
volcanic Miller (7 of 11) erupted for 15 in the first, including
three treys, it looked like it was going to be another Pacer
cakewalk.
</P>
<P>
   ``With these new rules,'' Pitino said, ``Reggie Miller is one of
the more lethal players in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like a kid again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Indy lead was 8 after one and 15 at the break, as Bird got
great contributions from last season's MIA's Croshere (11) and
Harrington (12.) But the Celtics came back in the third, got to
within 3, and hung around in the fourth as Anderson scored 14 in
the final quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics had one glittering chance down the stretch. A Walker
trey (he had three) cut the deficit to 103-98 with 3:46 to play.
Bird called a timeout and Mark Jackson came out of the break to
knock down the Pacers' 10th and final 3-pointer. After two Anderson
free throws _ there were 21 freebies in the fourth _ the previously
comatose Smits (13 points in the first two games) followed up a
Jalen Rose miss with his 3-point play. Smits finished with 13
points, 7 rebounds, and 2 blocks.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson answered with another trey, making it 109-103, and then
Dale Davis bricked two free throws with 1:28 left. There was still
hope. But Paul Pierce (19 points, 5 turnovers) lost the ball in
traffic and killer Miller connected on the leaner, assuring that
the 18,345 in attendance would go home happy.

PIECES IN PLACE FOR BRUINS

<P>
   BOSTON _ The longer they go, the easier it gets. A jumbled
collection of shattered pieces only a couple of weeks ago, the
repair-on-the-run Bruins rattled off their sixth straight win
Saturday &UR;  &LR; night, a 4-2 rubout of the expansionist Atlanta
Thrashers, backed by their nouveau riche netminder, Byron Dafoe.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Belanger, Darren Van Impe, and Dave Andreychuk (two) all
scored for the Bruins, who hadn't won six straight since
February/March 1994. The current streak is their longest in the
post-Garden era. Four-plus years out of the beloved barn, they have
cracked the combination to the Vault (without the aid of Geraldo
Rivera).
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of 16,883 came to Causeway to see the Bruins win for the
fourth straight time on home ice. They now have gone seven straight
without a loss (6-0-1), the victory nudging them over .500 (6-5-4)
for the first time this season.
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe, playing for the first time since inking his three-year,
$9.45 million deal, had a relatively easy time of it. He stopped 13
of 14 shots in the first two periods _ very light work _ and
carried a two-goal lead into the third period. He finished with 21
stops.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was important for me to have that type of game,'' said
Dafoe, who had Rob Tallas watching from the bench as his trusty
backup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a solid game, a building ground for me, and I needed
that, because I know the next game will come very soon and it will
be a lot tougher.''
</P>
<P>
   The long-armed sharpshooting Andreychuk potted goals 10 and 11,
the second coming with 1:05 to play, only 13 seconds after Andrew
Brunette pulled the Thrashers to within 3-2 on a power-play strike.
At this pace, the 36-year-old Andreychuk easily could crack 50
goals, which would make him the first Bruin to do so since Cam
Neely.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some guys (goal scoring) is a little bit of a God-given
thing,'' said Andreychuk. ``But you have to work hard, too. For me,
I'd say some of it's God-given, and getting in the right spot. When
you're in the right spot, the puck just seems to come to you, even
if you aren't having a great game.''
</P>
<P>
   Belanger scored the only goal in the first period, providing the
Bruins with a 1-0 lead with only 4:24 ticked off the clock. The
hard-working winger tipped the puck away from Mike Stapleton behind
the Atlanta net, reached out front from behind the goal line, and
stuffed his first goal of the season inside the right post.
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe made a couple of nice stops in the period, the first
coming only 15 seconds into the action when hard-shooting Petr
Buzek hammered a slapper from the top of the left circle. Dafoe
steered it to the opposite wing. With 10:20 gone, and the Thrashers
shorthanded, rookie sensation Patrik Stefan broke in on right wing
and snapped off a wrister that Dafoe knocked away with a clever toe
save.
</P>
<P>
   The 28-year-old netminder was showing no signs of rust.
</P>
<P>
   The Thrashers came back with an early goal in the second to tie
it, 1-1, but the Bruins struck twice in the final two minutes to
carry a 3-1 lead into the third.
</P>
<P>
   With 1:20 gone, only moments after their power play expired, the
Thrashers tied it when Per Svartvadet collected a Johan Garpenlov
feed and flipped an 8-foot wrister under the crossbar. Dafoe didn't
have much of a chance to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins were working with a power play of their own at 1:47
when Van Impe struck for his second goal in as many games, again
unloading one of his steaming slappers. The puck came to Van Impe
high in the slot after an Anson Carter (two assists) feed into the
middle slid off Steve Heinze's stick. Van Impe, working the right
point, quickly closed into the middle and hammered in the 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The crusher for the expansionists came with 36 seconds left in
the period when the Goliath-like Andreychuk muscled out from behind
the left post and slid a wraparound shot through Damian Rhodes's
legs. In control behind the net, he first motioned as if he would
come out front from behind the right post, reversed field, and
powered out from behind the left post, carrying Atlanta defenseman
Chris Tamer on his back.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you could teach that,'' said Bruins head coach Pat Burns,
``you'd have a lot of 500-goal scorers in the NHL. Some guys have
it. Some don't. He knows the right time to hit it.''

DAFOE STILL SMOKING BETWEEN THE PIPES 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Bruins are complete again. Goalie Byron Dafoe was
back between the pipes Saturday &UR;  &LR; night and made 21 saves in a 4-2
victory over the Atlanta Thrashers that swelled the B's autumnal
winning streak to six games.
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe hadn't stopped many shots since May 18, when the Bruins
skated into a long, hot summer after a 3-2 playoff loss at
Buffalo's Marine Midland Arena. During his protracted holdout, he
skated at the Icenter in Salem, N.H., where former Bruin defenseman
Grant Ledyard and assorted plumbers, salesmen, and rink rats took
aim just to help him keep his reflexes sharp .
</P>
<P>
   If we can believe TV commercials, Nolan Ryan can stay sharp by
throwing fastballs to Mrs. Ryan, but there is no way to simulate
NHL action. We can't expect pregnant Kim Dafoe to blast 100 mile
per hour one-timers from the point. Being an NHL goalie is sort of
like being an NFL running back or a heavyweight boxer: You can keep
yourself in shape, but you never know if you're game-ready until
you perform against championship-caliber competition.
</P>
<P>
   At 7:08 Saturday &UR;  &LR; night, Dafoe was back on the New Garden ice
for the first time in almost six months. Seconds into the game, his
first save came on a hard slap shot by Thrasher defenseman Petr
Buzek.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was good,'' Dafoe said after the win. ``It was good to
have that right at the start instead of standing around for five
minutes waiting for the first shot.''
</P>
<P>
   He had six saves in the first 11 minutes, including a nifty toe
save on a Patrik Stefan shorthanded wrist shot. In the second, he
allowed a game-tying doorstep goal to Per Svartvadet, then snatched
a point-blank Yannick Tremblay shot with his glove. The Thrashers
didn't score again until the final 1:18, when Andrew Brunette
flicked home a rebound while the visitors were playing with two
extra skaters.
</P>
<P>
   It was a nice return for the holdout goalie.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played very well,'' said coach Pat Burns. ``We expected
that from him. He's a fierce competitor. From the start of the
game, he was alert and ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe said, ``My teammates played extremely well defensively in
front of me. I felt better as the game went on. I'm definitely not
100 percent and the last three minutes kind of got to me, but I was
feeling confident and reading plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruins fans were predictably forgiving of their 28-year-old
netminder and showered him with applause when he was announced as a
starter (several came armed with supportive signage). Perhaps
because of Hardball Harry Sinden's chilly reputation as the Mr.
Potter of professional sports, B's customers align themselves with
young millionaire athletes. Dafoe ``settled'' for three years at
$9.45 million (sans over $400,000 in lost holdout wages) and
somehow became a martyr. In the end, the talented goalie was the
good guy because he dumped his agent and came back for the love of
the game (and lifetime security). He wanted to play hockey more
than he wanted to prove a point to Sinden or the Players
Association. Fans like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was special,'' Dafoe said when asked about the fan
reaction. ``These are knowledgeable fans. They know what's going
on. I think that's the only time I got louder applause than Ray
Bourque.''
</P>
<P>
   He admitted, ``It was tough watching the games on television. I
stayed up late and watched all the games when they were on that
trip. I felt helpless. It's one thing to watch games when you can't
play because you are injured. This wasn't the same. It was
frustrating because I've played with almost all these guys
before.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of things have happened since Dafoe's last appearance with
the Bruins. He rejected his chance at salary arbitration _ a
dubious decision. Then there was the usual sabre-rattling between
camps with Hardball Harry firing off the usual salvos about saving
the sport, and Dafoe's agent trying to teach Harry a lesson.
Bourque made some calls on Dafoe's behalf, and in the end Harry and
Byron hammered out a deal in a single afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Management loves this type of agentless negotiation. The late
Walter Brown used to make these deals with his Celtics. Tommy
Heinsohn remembers bumping into Uncle Walter in the old Boston
Garden men's room, then standing side-by-side with the owner, in
front of a trough, talking contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time we zipped up, we'd have a deal,'' recalled
Heinsohn.
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe's deal took more time and sapped much emotion from the
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last two months have been tough on me and my family,'' he
said. ``Now it's nice to put the Dafoe Contract Story behind.
Hockey is what I like talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't think he was risking injury by returning to the ice
just eight days after signing his contract. He stayed in condition
throughout his work stoppage, never going more than five days
without skating.
</P>
<P>
   And how did he fare against those 30-year-old plumbers,
salesmen, and rink rats?
</P>
<P>
   ``They got a few by me,'' Dafoe said, smiling. ``Hey, you shoot
1,000 pucks, they're going to get a couple past you.''
</P>
<P>
   They got a couple more past him Saturday &UR;  &LR; night. But it wasn't
enough to beat Byron Dafoe. It wasn't enough to beat the hottest
team in town.

 &HT;    PEACE TALKS TO PROCEED DESPITE PIPE BOMBING IN ISRAEL
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM Peace talks set for today (Monday) remain on schedule
despite the explosion Sunday of three pipe bombs in an Israeli
coastal city. The bombing injured few but is a reminder of the
opposition to any peaceful compromise between Israelis and
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The trio of bombs exploded simultaneously on a busy street
corner in the city of Netanya injuring 27 people. Most were only
slightly hurt and no one suffered serious harm. A fourth pipe bomb
which did not explode was found nearby during a police search.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing came a day after the military wing of Hamas, a
Palestinian group seeking the elimination of Israel, threatened to
unleash a new wave of terror. Israeli police said they suspected
terrorists rather than common criminals for Sunday's bombing. Two
Palestinian suspects were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing appeared to follow a pattern set over several years
in which extremist groups have used terror to try to upset Israelis
and derail upcoming peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   Some Israelis protested against the peace process at the scene
of the bombing and a few members of parties opposing the government
called for a postponement in the talks. However, while bombings did
often stall talks under former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
the current government Sunday pledged to forge ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Current Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who heard of the bombings
during his weekly cabinet meeting said, ``We cannot have any
illusions. There will be those who try to stop the process but they
will not succeed.'' He vowed to ``crush terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   He also called on Palestinian leaders to help him keep terrorism
from threatening the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Mitigating the political damage caused by the bombing were
recent Israeli reports of improvements in Palestinian security
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should never allow the extremists to veto the peace
process,'' Avraham Burg, speaker of the Israeli parliament, told
Israel radio.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's stay-the-course response was reminiscent of the approach
used by his mentor, slain Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who
attempted to pursue peace while fighting terror.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, Barak, Palestinian President Yasser Arafat and
President Bill Clinton met in Oslo, Norway to mark the fourth
anniversary of Rabin's death. They resolved to keep the
six-year-old peace process going.
</P>
<P>
   Today's(Monday) meeting is meant to lead to a general
``framework'' for peace by February. That, in turn, is supposed to
lead to a final resolution of all disputes by mid-September.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, Israel is ceding control to the Palestinians of
land in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank that Israel captured in
the 1967 war. Most of the Gaza Strip has been turned over and about
a third of the West Bank is in total or partial Palestinian
control.
</P>
<P>
   But, the new round of talks deals with the toughest issues.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians want Israel to share Jerusalem, the eastern portion
of which Israel captured in 1967. Israeli leaders vow never to
share the city they consider their capital. Most governments,
including the United States, do not recognize the city as the
capital and consider the city's status up for negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians also want more than 3 million refugees to be
allowed to return to lands in Israel or the West Bank that they
lost in the wars in 1948 or 1967. While that demand poses huge
practical problems for Israelis now living on their lands, some
type of compensation package could be proposed.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the Palestinians want Israel to dismantle Jewish housing
developments settlements established on the conquered West Bank
land.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Israel is seeking guarantees that the Palestinians
will not form an army or make alliances with countries hostile to
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's meeting was expected to focus on organizational and
scheduling issues for the talks.

   MICROSOFT-STOCK (Undated) _ Microsoft has long been, in the
words of one analyst, ``an institutional investor's dream.'' Since
the company went public in March 1986, its market capitalization
has soared to $470 billion, making it the most highly valued
company in the world. But given the severity of Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson's findings of fact on Friday, some analysts and

   MICROSOFT-CONSUMERS (Undated) _ In its 18-month antitrust battle
against Microsoft, the government introduced mountains of e-mail,
documents and testimony from business partners and competitors to
show that the company had a monopoly in computer operating systems
and that it had illegally leveraged that position to muscle its way
into new markets. But proving that the software giant's tactics had
resulted in harm to consumers often seemed the hardest and most
elusive part of the case. Many software users see one of the
government's key complaints -- Microsoft's inclusion of a Web
browser with its Windows operating system -- as a boon. By Amy

   ECOM-CLICKDATA (Undated) _ The E-Commerce Column: On the
Internet, where information is king, some of the most valuable
information is data about user or customer behavior. Of this, one
of the most closely followed measurements is so-called ``click
data,'' which focuses on who has clicked on an advertising banner
or some other particular link. Web site publishers, advertising
agencies and companies who buy those ads have relied heavily on
that data to build their businesses, and until now they have been
generous about sharing it freely with each other. Now one of the
Internet's biggest advertisers is raising the question of whether
that data belongs to anyone but the advertisers, and the resulting
debate could shape the future of the advertiser-publisher

   Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule book reviews:
</P>
<P>
   ``MY GARDEN (BOOK)''  &QL; 
By Jamaica Kincaid (FSG, $23) &QL; 
Jamaica Kincaid has written books full of her difficult feelings
for her mother and her brother, but boy, does she love her garden.
She is agitated and vexed when she's in it, but she's happy:
``Nothing works just the way I thought it would, nothing looks just
the way I had imagined it, and when sometimes it does look like
what I had imagined (and this, thank God, is rare) I am startled
that my imagination is so ordinary.'' This book is dense with
growing things, overrun with blooms, fertile with every plant
you've ever heard of and then some. Fellow gardening author Michael
Pollan says Kincaid's voice is that of ``an exquisitely attentive
gardener thinking out loud.'' We'd note that ``exquisitely
attentive'' is a kind way of saying ``obsessed,'' but then it's all
New &AMP; Notable can do to water the tomatoes. Kincaid celebrates seed
and plant catalogs, discusses the link between gardeners and
conquerors, and notes that ``everyone I have ever met who has a
garden has something growing in it from seeds that were gathered in
Monet's garden.'' That means she cultivates exotic friends, too. &QL; 
``THE BOOK BORROWER'' &QL; 
By Alice Mattison (Morrow, $24) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This odd and meandering novel begins with the meeting of two
young mothers at a park in 1975. Deborah Laidlaw is there with her
daughters, Toby Ruben with her baby son, and in the course of their
conversation Toby borrows a book that Deborah has been carrying
around but has not found time to read. Two things begin in this
scene: a lifelong friendship between Toby and Deborah, and our
interest in the fate of that borrowed book, ``Trolley Girl,'' the
story of a tragedy that occurred during a strike among trolley
workers in 1921. For much of her novel, Mattison alternates the
interplay between Toby, Deborah and their families with sections
narrated by the author of ``Trolley Girl.'' We're not sure why she
does this but we're grateful for it, because ``Trolley Girl''
proceeds with a sense of purpose and anticipation. The ground is
not so firm under Toby and Deborah, whose friendship unfolds in
rambling conversations and unseen resolutions. One chapter ends
with a terrible conflict between the two friends when Toby almost
gets Deborah fired from her teaching job. To our surprise, the next
chapter begins years later, with their friendship obviously
restored, although Mattison does not say how. This is exasperating,
but ``The Book Borrower'' is not without saving graces. One is Toby
Ruben, an authentic character who slips into mean-spiritedness when
she feels threatened. Another is Mattison's portrayal of the give
and take between friends, between men and women, between parents
and children _ that messy navigation of emotional ties. In the end,
her novel is less notable for its story than for these small
moments that ring true. &QL; 
``IF THIS HOUSE COULD TALK'' &QL; 
By Elizabeth Smith Brownstein (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $35) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I have found that it is the visible, the tangible, that goes a
long way in softening prejudices,'' Booker T. Washington wrote in
``Up From Slavery.'' ``The actual sight of a first-class house that
a Negro has built is 10 times more potent than pages of discussion
about a house that he ought to build, or perhaps could build.'' And
so, against the wishes of some of his benefactors, Washington built
``The Oaks,'' a red brick house with parlor, library, dining room,
kitchen, family and guest bedrooms, den, breakfast room, five
bathrooms and a veranda on three acres of land overlooking the
campus of Alabama's Tuskegee Institute. Among the other buildings
included in this look at historic homes and the people who lived in
them are the stunning ``symphony in wood'' built in 1908 (for a
mere $55,000) for Proctor &AMP; Gamble heir David Gamble in Pasadena,
Calif.; the New Hampshire farm of poet Robert Frost; Lorenzo
Hubbell's house and trading post in Ganado; the Massachusetts
homestead of Rebecca Nurse, who was hanged during the Salem witch
trials; the Bronx, N.Y., cottage of Edgar Allan Poe; and Frank
Lloyd Wright's Storer House and Auldbrass Plantation. Our favorite
is illustrator Edward Gorey's Cape Cod cottage, where books are
piled precariously high on every horizontal surface in sight. This
engaging blend of history, architecture and interior design
contains what its author calls ``stories of great passion, courage
and brilliance . . . and enough cruelty, greed and ignorance to go
around.'' &QL; 
``THE COST OF LIVING'' &QL; 
By Arundhati Roy (Modern Library, $11.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Roy follows her Booker Prize-winning first novel, ``The God of
Small Things,'' with two essays, one on dam projects that have
scarred her native India and the other on India's detonation last
year of a nuclear bomb. The first, called ``The Greater Common
Good,'' is more demanding reading, but both benefit from Roy's very
personal and appealingly abrasive style. In the second essay, ``The
End of Imagination,'' she touches on the success of her novel.
``The more I thought about it,'' she writes, ``the clearer it
became to me that if fame was going to be my permanent condition it
would kill me. Club me to death with its good manners and hygiene.
I'll admit that I've enjoyed my own five minutes of it immensely
but primarilyBECAUSE (editor: ITAL) it was just five minutes.
Because I knew (or thought I knew) that I could go home when I was
bored and giggle about it. Grow old and irresponsible. Eat mangoes
in the moonlight. Maybe write a couple of failed books _
worstsellers _ to see what it felt like.'' Instead, she has written
this, a thought-provoking challenge from a citizen of India and of
the world. &QL;

A 100 YEARS LATER, CAN FREUD BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH LaFAVE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (THIS ARTICLE ALSO MOVED IN ``L'' and ``K'' CATEGORIES)
 &UR; One hundred years ago this month, Sigmund Freud began an enterprise
that would turn us all inside out.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Interpretation of Dreams,'' published in November 1899,
the 43-year-old Viennese doctor theorized that dreams present us
with repressed desires. All dreams are wish fulfillment, Freud
claimed, and it is possible to read our dreams and to know things
felt long ago in childhood that were driven into the unconscious
under the weight of social norms and parental expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Using free association, dream interpretation and long-term
interaction with an analyst, neurotic behavior could be understood
as the result of repressed memories of childhood trauma.
Consciousness could dispel those unconscious urges that rule us
from below.
</P>
<P>
   Freud wrote many other books over the next four decades,
developing his theory of psychoanalysis into a comprehensive view
of human experience. By knowing the dark sources of its everyday
behavior, he averred, humanity could be made healthier.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not everyone has agreed.
</P>
<P>
   After untold millions of hours have been spent by thousands upon
hundreds of thousands of patients on couches talking about potty
training and relationships with their moms, it seems scarcely
possible to assert in 1999 that humans are generally happier than
they were in 1899.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Freud's theory is not so life-altering as originally
thought.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's not even tenable.
</P>
<P>
   The ancient Greeks, in the myth of Orpheus and the Underworld,
seem to have anticipated Freud and found his theory wanting.
</P>
<P>
   According to the myth, the great musician Orpheus loved the
nymph Eurydice with a passion that transcended all. When, on their
wedding day, she died of a snake bite, Orpheus would not let death
part them. Orpheus strode into the Underworld and requested of
Pluto, its King, to let Eurydice leave with him when he returned to
the sunshine. Pluto granted Orpheus' request on one condition:
Orpheus must not look back at Eurydice as they left, but keep his
gaze directed at the road ahead, the path out of the Underworld.
</P>
<P>
   Orpheus began the journey back with Eurydice following. But as
he neared the exit from the kingdom of shades, he could not resist
a glance back at his beloved. Instantly, he realized his mistake,
as Eurydice slipped back helplessly into the darkness. Orpheus
emerged into the light alone, and for the rest of his days roamed
the land, heartbroken, singing his tragic songs.
</P>
<P>
   In the myth, the Underworld _ the Greeks' symbol for the
unconscious _ could not be successfully breached by Orpheus/Reason
without losing the object of its quest. The contents of the
unconscious could not be pulled out into the sunshine and
comprehended in conscious, rational terms.
</P>
<P>
   But Freud asserted that they could, and he has convinced most of
the rest of us that he was right. His theories, once radical, are
now everyday. His observation of the stages of infant development
today seem obvious to any observant parent: the oral stage,
dominated by feeding; the anal stage, with attention shifted to
endless diaper changes; and the genital stage, signalling the first
hints of sexual awareness. After the mindless destruction of World
War I seemed to deny the life force itself, Freud put forth the
idea, in ``Beyond the Pleasure Principle,'' that humans struggle
daily with two opposing forces: Eros, the life force, and Thanatos,
the death force. Whenever we talk about someone having a death
wish, Freud is there.
</P>
<P>
   He's also there when we say something sexual where a sexual
reference was not intended _ we call it a ``Freudian slip.''
</P>
<P>
   And he's there whenever his grossest generalization, the Oedipus
complex, is taken seriously. Generalizing from the results of his
own self-analysis, in which he found himself attracted to his own
mother in childhood, Freud asserted it to be true of all children,
male and female alike (which has recently found him favor in
lesbian circles). The actual story of Oedipus in Greek mythology
probably points to something far less sexually specific: that a man
is likely to follow the pattern set out for him in youth, to
attempt to duplicate the home he was raised in and to replace (to
``kill'') his father. But the myth is now so wrapped up with Freud
that it is hard to disentangle it.
</P>
<P>
   Freud's reputation crested sometime midcentury and has since
been under sustained attack. Where once Freud was a hero of popular
culture _ the 1962 Hollywood howler ``Freud'' cast Montgomery Clift
as the bearded cigar-smoker and featured the oracular tones of
director-narrator John Huston comparing Freud to Christ _ he is now
passe, a name with little resonance.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1970s, the scholarly world, too, has tended more to
Freud-bashing than to Freud hagiography. In ``The Memory Wars:
Freud's Legacy in Dispute (New York Review, 1995),'' author and
former Freudian Frederick Crews dismissed Freud as ``the discoverer
of vague general truths about human deviousness.'' E. Fuller
Torrey, in ``Freudian Fraud (Harper Collins, 1992),'' made a case
that there is no scientific basis whatsoever for Freud's theories.
</P>
<P>
   Long before either book was published, no less a figure than
Ludwig Wittgenstein, one of the century's greatest philosophers,
pointed out perhaps the single greatest flaw in Freudian theory. If
Freud had indeed discovered dark things in the unconscious, how
could he possibly prove they were things of meaning? A cause is not
a meaning. Event A may cause Behavior B without imbuing B with a
particular meaning.
</P>
<P>
   A child may learn to repress sexual urges that do not correspond
to parental expectations, but, well . . . so what? Nothing
scientific can be drawn from such an observation. An additional
element is needed, Wittgenstein observed, to give the event and its
repression meaning: the very unscientific one of mythology.
(Wittgenstein's observations about Freud, scattered throughout his
career in essays and lectures, are gathered in ``Wittgenstein Reads
Freud: The Myth of the Unconscious,'' by Jacques Bouveresse,
translated by Carol Cosman (Princeton University Press, 1995.)
</P>
<P>
   So, Freud's power depends, not on any factual, scientific
observation about humanity, but on the skills he had as a writer
and self-promoter to convince us that looking at life his way _ at
every neurosis as a repressed desire, at every dream as wish
fulfillment, etc. _ is the right way to look at it.
</P>
<P>
   Psychoanalysis is a myth without hard scientific basis.
Paradoxically, it's a myth that loses potency when stripped of its
supposed factual basis, becoming then just one possibility among
many others. Freud himself was adamant that his theories be
considered ``correct.'' In ``The Ego and the Id (1923)'' he wrote:
``The fact that in the technique of psychoanalysis a means has been
found by which the opposing force (repression) can be removed and
the ideas in question made conscious renders the theory
IRREFUTABLE.(ITAL)''
</P>
<P>
   The claim to irrefutability was part of Freud's myth.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Orpheus and Eurydice was a myth about the
exploration of the unconscious. Its moral was that knowing the dark
side of ourselves is not possible except in the symbols of art _
Orpheus' music.
</P>
<P>
   The myth of Freud was a modern version of same in which knowing
our unconscious selves in rational terms is not only possible, but
factually verifiable according to the theories of psychoanalysis.
</P>
<P>
   But what if the old myth, and not the new one, more accurately
represents the human condition? Not all myths are equal. Some got
there first because they state a truth that lies at the center of
our existence.
</P>
<P>
   If the story of Orpheus is truer than the story of Freud, then
our conscious and unconscious selves are not meant to communicate
in the way Freud wanted them to. In psychoanalysis, the language of
the conscious self dominates the unconscious; the unconscious is
invaded. The Orpheus myth would lead us rather to leave the
unconscious alone on its own terms, and content our conscious
selves with meditating on the symbols of art and spirituality that
are the universal language of the unconscious.
</P>
<P>
   In very general terms, this is what Carl Jung did. The Swiss
student of Freud trumped his teacher's belief in the unconscious by
giving the unconscious its due, developing a whole new branch of
psychology that diverged from Freud by dwelling not on repressed
sexual urges but on the meaning of symbols from the unconscious. He
let the unconscious speak in its own language.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of plumbing the darkness inside ourselves, sexual or
otherwise, may have begun to pale. The latest trend in therapy is
philosophical therapy, which is an exact denial of psychological
therapy.
</P>
<P>
   According to philosophical therapists, our duties as people are
to develop conscious discernment and leave what cannot be discerned
to dreams, art and religion. In a time when Freudian theories have
decayed to the point that respect is given to every smirking sexual
reference on daytime television talk shows, it's a refreshing
concept. &QL;

   The claim to irrefutability was part of Freud's myth.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Orpheus and Eurydice was a myth about the
exploration of the unconscious. Its moral was that knowing the dark
side of ourselves is not possible except in the symbols of art _
Orpheus' music.
</P>
<P>
   The myth of Freud was a modern version of same in which knowing
our unconscious selves in rational terms is not only possible, but
factually verifiable according to the theories of psychoanalysis.
</P>
<P>
   But what if the old myth, and not the new one, more accurately
represents the human condition? Not all myths are equal. Some got
there first because they state a truth that lies at the center of
our existence.
</P>
<P>
   If the story of Orpheus is truer than the story of Freud, then
our conscious and unconscious selves are not meant to communicate
in the way Freud wanted them to. In psychoanalysis, the language of
the conscious self dominates the unconscious; the unconscious is
invaded. The Orpheus myth would lead us rather to leave the
unconscious alone on its own terms, and content our conscious
selves with meditating on the symbols of art and spirituality that
are the universal language of the unconscious.
</P>
<P>
   In very general terms, this is what Carl Jung did. The Swiss
student of Freud trumped his teacher's belief in the unconscious by
giving the unconscious its due, developing a whole new branch of
psychology that diverged from Freud by dwelling not on repressed
sexual urges but on the meaning of symbols from the unconscious. He
let the unconscious speak in its own language.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of plumbing the darkness inside ourselves, sexual or
otherwise, may have begun to pale. The latest trend in therapy is
philosophical therapy, which is an exact denial of psychological
therapy.
</P>
<P>
   According to philosophical therapists, our duties as people are
to develop conscious discernment and leave what cannot be discerned
to dreams, art and religion. In a time when Freudian theories have
decayed to the point that respect is given to every smirking sexual
reference on daytime television talk shows, it's a refreshing
concept. &QL;

A 100 YEARS LATER, CAN FREUD BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH LaFAVE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (THIS ARTICLE ALSO MOVED IN ``A'' and ``K'' CATEGORIES)
 &UR; One hundred years ago this month, Sigmund Freud began an enterprise
that would turn us all inside out.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Interpretation of Dreams,'' published in November 1899,
the 43-year-old Viennese doctor theorized that dreams present us
with repressed desires. All dreams are wish fulfillment, Freud
claimed, and it is possible to read our dreams and to know things
felt long ago in childhood that were driven into the unconscious
under the weight of social norms and parental expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Using free association, dream interpretation and long-term
interaction with an analyst, neurotic behavior could be understood
as the result of repressed memories of childhood trauma.
Consciousness could dispel those unconscious urges that rule us
from below.
</P>
<P>
   Freud wrote many other books over the next four decades,
developing his theory of psychoanalysis into a comprehensive view
of human experience. By knowing the dark sources of its everyday
behavior, he averred, humanity could be made healthier.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not everyone has agreed.
</P>
<P>
   After untold millions of hours have been spent by thousands upon
hundreds of thousands of patients on couches talking about potty
training and relationships with their moms, it seems scarcely
possible to assert in 1999 that humans are generally happier than
they were in 1899.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Freud's theory is not so life-altering as originally
thought.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's not even tenable.
</P>
<P>
   The ancient Greeks, in the myth of Orpheus and the Underworld,
seem to have anticipated Freud and found his theory wanting.
</P>
<P>
   According to the myth, the great musician Orpheus loved the
nymph Eurydice with a passion that transcended all. When, on their
wedding day, she died of a snake bite, Orpheus would not let death
part them. Orpheus strode into the Underworld and requested of
Pluto, its King, to let Eurydice leave with him when he returned to
the sunshine. Pluto granted Orpheus' request on one condition:
Orpheus must not look back at Eurydice as they left, but keep his
gaze directed at the road ahead, the path out of the Underworld.
</P>
<P>
   Orpheus began the journey back with Eurydice following. But as
he neared the exit from the kingdom of shades, he could not resist
a glance back at his beloved. Instantly, he realized his mistake,
as Eurydice slipped back helplessly into the darkness. Orpheus
emerged into the light alone, and for the rest of his days roamed
the land, heartbroken, singing his tragic songs.
</P>
<P>
   In the myth, the Underworld _ the Greeks' symbol for the
unconscious _ could not be successfully breached by Orpheus/Reason
without losing the object of its quest. The contents of the
unconscious could not be pulled out into the sunshine and
comprehended in conscious, rational terms.
</P>
<P>
   But Freud asserted that they could, and he has convinced most of
the rest of us that he was right. His theories, once radical, are
now everyday. His observation of the stages of infant development
today seem obvious to any observant parent: the oral stage,
dominated by feeding; the anal stage, with attention shifted to
endless diaper changes; and the genital stage, signalling the first
hints of sexual awareness. After the mindless destruction of World
War I seemed to deny the life force itself, Freud put forth the
idea, in ``Beyond the Pleasure Principle,'' that humans struggle
daily with two opposing forces: Eros, the life force, and Thanatos,
the death force. Whenever we talk about someone having a death
wish, Freud is there.
</P>
<P>
   He's also there when we say something sexual where a sexual
reference was not intended _ we call it a ``Freudian slip.''
</P>
<P>
   And he's there whenever his grossest generalization, the Oedipus
complex, is taken seriously. Generalizing from the results of his
own self-analysis, in which he found himself attracted to his own
mother in childhood, Freud asserted it to be true of all children,
male and female alike (which has recently found him favor in
lesbian circles). The actual story of Oedipus in Greek mythology
probably points to something far less sexually specific: that a man
is likely to follow the pattern set out for him in youth, to
attempt to duplicate the home he was raised in and to replace (to
``kill'') his father. But the myth is now so wrapped up with Freud
that it is hard to disentangle it.
</P>
<P>
   Freud's reputation crested sometime midcentury and has since
been under sustained attack. Where once Freud was a hero of popular
culture _ the 1962 Hollywood howler ``Freud'' cast Montgomery Clift
as the bearded cigar-smoker and featured the oracular tones of
director-narrator John Huston comparing Freud to Christ _ he is now
passe, a name with little resonance.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1970s, the scholarly world, too, has tended more to
Freud-bashing than to Freud hagiography. In ``The Memory Wars:
Freud's Legacy in Dispute (New York Review, 1995),'' author and
former Freudian Frederick Crews dismissed Freud as ``the discoverer
of vague general truths about human deviousness.'' E. Fuller
Torrey, in ``Freudian Fraud (Harper Collins, 1992),'' made a case
that there is no scientific basis whatsoever for Freud's theories.
</P>
<P>
   Long before either book was published, no less a figure than
Ludwig Wittgenstein, one of the century's greatest philosophers,
pointed out perhaps the single greatest flaw in Freudian theory. If
Freud had indeed discovered dark things in the unconscious, how
could he possibly prove they were things of meaning? A cause is not
a meaning. Event A may cause Behavior B without imbuing B with a
particular meaning.
</P>
<P>
   A child may learn to repress sexual urges that do not correspond
to parental expectations, but, well . . . so what? Nothing
scientific can be drawn from such an observation. An additional
element is needed, Wittgenstein observed, to give the event and its
repression meaning: the very unscientific one of mythology.
(Wittgenstein's observations about Freud, scattered throughout his
career in essays and lectures, are gathered in ``Wittgenstein Reads
Freud: The Myth of the Unconscious,'' by Jacques Bouveresse,
translated by Carol Cosman (Princeton University Press, 1995.)
</P>
<P>
   So, Freud's power depends, not on any factual, scientific
observation about humanity, but on the skills he had as a writer
and self-promoter to convince us that looking at life his way _ at
every neurosis as a repressed desire, at every dream as wish
fulfillment, etc. _ is the right way to look at it.
</P>
<P>
   Psychoanalysis is a myth without hard scientific basis.
Paradoxically, it's a myth that loses potency when stripped of its
supposed factual basis, becoming then just one possibility among
many others. Freud himself was adamant that his theories be
considered ``correct.'' In ``The Ego and the Id (1923)'' he wrote:
``The fact that in the technique of psychoanalysis a means has been
found by which the opposing force (repression) can be removed and
the ideas in question made conscious renders the theory
IRREFUTABLE.(ITAL)''
</P>
<P>
   The claim to irrefutability was part of Freud's myth.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Orpheus and Eurydice was a myth about the
exploration of the unconscious. Its moral was that knowing the dark
side of ourselves is not possible except in the symbols of art _
Orpheus' music.
</P>
<P>

   THE THROWAWAY CELL PHONE  (mk) 
 By TERESA RIORDAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   We may live in a disposable society, but is the world ready for
throwaway cell phones? Randice-Lisa Altschul thinks so.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Altschul, a full-time inventor in Cliffside Park, N.J., has
patented a technology that she says can be used to manufacture
cellular phones so inexpensively that they could be sold for a
fixed amount of air time _ as long-distance calling cards are _ and
then tossed in the garbage once their minutes have been used up.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Altschul, with the help of consulting engineers, essentially
took a flexible circuit, which forms the innards of many cell
phones today, and elongated it.
</P>
<P>
   This, she says, enables the flex circuit to be folded back upon
itself, much like a large ribbon, thereby eliminating the need for
most of the plastic housing found in other cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   ``The circuit itself becomes the body of the unit,'' Ms.
Altschul said. ``And it becomes its own built-in tamper-proof
system because as soon as you cut it open, you break the circuits
and the phone goes dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, she contends, her technology can be used to greatly
reduce the costs of manufacturing any electronic device that uses a
flexible circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Patent 5,965,848 was granted in October to Ms. Altschul and Lee
Volte, a former senior vice president for research and development
at the toy maker, Tyco.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Altschul, 39, hit her first invention home run when she was
25. She had created a cops-vs.-cocaine-dealers game that took place
on a map of Miami, and she persuaded the executive producer of the
``Miami Vice'' television series to let her call it the Miami Vice
Game. Since then, Ms. Altschul has invented numerous other games,
most notably Barbie's 30th Birthday Game.
</P>
<P>
   She has also recently patented other children's gear. Applause
Inc. is selling her patented stuffed animals, which feature
pocketlike arms into which children can insert their arms. These
enable the child to wave the stuffed animal's arms or to make it
seem as if the animal is capable of giving hugs.
</P>
<P>
   And Ms. Altschul is looking to license her ``interactive
cereal'' _ cereal sculpted into monster shapes that crumple into
soggy heaps when doused with milk.
</P>
<P>
   So how did a toy-and-game inventor come to think up a new
cellular phone technology?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was driving in my car, and I kept losing my cell signal, and
I wanted to throw my phone out the window. And _ bingo _ I came up
with the idea,'' Ms. Altschul said. She immediately called her
patent lawyer to see whether anyone else had patented such an idea.
No one had.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greatest asset I have over everyone else in that business
is my toy mentality,'' she said. ``An engineer's mentality is to
make something last, to make it durable. A toy's life span is about
an hour, then the kid throws it away. You get it, you play with it
and _ boom _ it's gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Ms. Altschul says her phone, which wouldn't require any
entangling contracts or billing agreements, would appeal primarily
to children, to harried mothers and to travelers who don't want to
have to worry about keeping track of yet another expensive
electronic device.
</P>
<P>
   She estimates that a phone with 60 minutes of air time could be
produced for about $14 and would retail for about $20 _ perhaps not
through normal retail channels, but, rather, as a marketing
gimmick. To lure more lunch customers, for example, a restaurant
like McDonald's might sell, at cost, a phone imprinted with the
golden arches logo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the ultimate in-your-face advertising,'' Ms. Altschul
said.
</P>
<P>
   For that kind of money, though, don't expect any frills. The
phone, powered by a six-volt battery, works for outgoing calls
only, and it doesn't have a liquid crystal display.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Altschul said the same technology could be used for a host
of electronic devices, from hand-held electronic games to
programmable fast-food debit cards.
</P>
<P>
   One of these might be a card sold for use with state lotteries
or given away by casinos as promotional freebies. ``It's basically
a slot machine in your pocket,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She also says her cellular phone could double as a credit card
when it has a magnetic strip built into it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The customer could swipe the phone instead of a credit card
and upon approval of his purchase receive instant gratification in
the form of more free air time,'' Ms. Altschul said. ``The more he
uses his cell phone as a credit card, the more air time he will
get.''
</P>
<P>
   This would, of course, require an arrangement between retailers,
cellular service providers and a credit card company. It would
require a longer-lasting power source than the 60-minute battery
Ms. Altschul envisions with the purely disposable cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Altschul says she comes up with as many as 20 to 30 new
ideas a week, but for the moment she is focusing most of her
efforts on the phone and its various manifestations.
</P>
<P>
   So far she has sunk more than $1 million of her own money into
the project. ``I'm talking to investors,'' she said. ``I'm at the
point where I need the guys with deeper pockets. Everything I own
is on the line for this project.''
</P>
<P>
   Patents may be viewed on the Web at www.uspto.gov or may be
ordered through the mail, by patent number, for $3 from the Patent
and Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.

   He's also there when we say something sexual where a sexual
reference was not intended _ we call it a ``Freudian slip.''
</P>
<P>
   And he's there whenever his grossest generalization, the Oedipus
complex, is taken seriously. Generalizing from the results of his
own self-analysis, in which he found himself attracted to his own
mother in childhood, Freud asserted it to be true of all children,
male and female alike (which has recently found him favor in
lesbian circles). The actual story of Oedipus in Greek mythology
probably points to something far less sexually specific: that a man
is likely to follow the pattern set out for him in youth, to
attempt to duplicate the home he was raised in and to replace (to
``kill'') his father. But the myth is now so wrapped up with Freud
that it is hard to disentangle it.
</P>
<P>
   Freud's reputation crested sometime midcentury and has since
been under sustained attack. Where once Freud was a hero of popular
culture _ the 1962 Hollywood howler ``Freud'' cast Montgomery Clift
as the bearded cigar-smoker and featured the oracular tones of
director-narrator John Huston comparing Freud to Christ _ he is now
passe, a name with little resonance.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1970s, the scholarly world, too, has tended more to
Freud-bashing than to Freud hagiography. In ``The Memory Wars:
Freud's Legacy in Dispute (New York Review, 1995),'' author and
former Freudian Frederick Crews dismissed Freud as ``the discoverer
of vague general truths about human deviousness.'' E. Fuller
Torrey, in ``Freudian Fraud (Harper Collins, 1992),'' made a case
that there is no scientific basis whatsoever for Freud's theories.
</P>
<P>
   Long before either book was published, no less a figure than
Ludwig Wittgenstein, one of the century's greatest philosophers,
pointed out perhaps the single greatest flaw in Freudian theory. If
Freud had indeed discovered dark things in the unconscious, how
could he possibly prove they were things of meaning? A cause is not
a meaning. Event A may cause Behavior B without imbuing B with a
particular meaning.
</P>
<P>
   A child may learn to repress sexual urges that do not correspond
to parental expectations, but, well . . . so what? Nothing
scientific can be drawn from such an observation. An additional
element is needed, Wittgenstein observed, to give the event and its
repression meaning: the very unscientific one of mythology.
(Wittgenstein's observations about Freud, scattered throughout his
career in essays and lectures, are gathered in ``Wittgenstein Reads
Freud: The Myth of the Unconscious,'' by Jacques Bouveresse,
translated by Carol Cosman (Princeton University Press, 1995.)
</P>
<P>
   So, Freud's power depends, not on any factual, scientific
observation about humanity, but on the skills he had as a writer
and self-promoter to convince us that looking at life his way _ at
every neurosis as a repressed desire, at every dream as wish
fulfillment, etc. _ is the right way to look at it.
</P>
<P>
   Psychoanalysis is a myth without hard scientific basis.
Paradoxically, it's a myth that loses potency when stripped of its
supposed factual basis, becoming then just one possibility among
many others. Freud himself was adamant that his theories be
considered ``correct.'' In ``The Ego and the Id (1923)'' he wrote:
``The fact that in the technique of psychoanalysis a means has been
found by which the opposing force (repression) can be removed and
the ideas in question made conscious renders the theory
IRREFUTABLE.(ITAL)''
</P>
<P>
   The claim to irrefutability was part of Freud's myth.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Orpheus and Eurydice was a myth about the
exploration of the unconscious. Its moral was that knowing the dark
side of ourselves is not possible except in the symbols of art _
Orpheus' music.
</P>
<P>
   The myth of Freud was a modern version of same in which knowing
our unconscious selves in rational terms is not only possible, but
factually verifiable according to the theories of psychoanalysis.
</P>
<P>
   But what if the old myth, and not the new one, more accurately
represents the human condition? Not all myths are equal. Some got
there first because they state a truth that lies at the center of
our existence.
</P>
<P>
   If the story of Orpheus is truer than the story of Freud, then
our conscious and unconscious selves are not meant to communicate
in the way Freud wanted them to. In psychoanalysis, the language of
the conscious self dominates the unconscious; the unconscious is
invaded. The Orpheus myth would lead us rather to leave the
unconscious alone on its own terms, and content our conscious
selves with meditating on the symbols of art and spirituality that
are the universal language of the unconscious.
</P>
<P>
   In very general terms, this is what Carl Jung did. The Swiss
student of Freud trumped his teacher's belief in the unconscious by
giving the unconscious its due, developing a whole new branch of
psychology that diverged from Freud by dwelling not on repressed
sexual urges but on the meaning of symbols from the unconscious. He
let the unconscious speak in its own language.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of plumbing the darkness inside ourselves, sexual or
otherwise, may have begun to pale. The latest trend in therapy is
philosophical therapy, which is an exact denial of psychological
therapy.
</P>
<P>
   According to philosophical therapists, our duties as people are
to develop conscious discernment and leave what cannot be discerned
to dreams, art and religion. In a time when Freudian theories have
decayed to the point that respect is given to every smirking sexual
reference on daytime television talk shows, it's a refreshing
concept. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   The three phrases flash in rapid succession on United
Illuminating &UR;  &LR; Co.'s Web site: No stamps. No checks. No fees.
</P>
<P>
   Since July, the words have alerted the southern Connecticut
utility's customers that they can now get and pay their electric
bills with a click of the mouse. Slowly, but steadily, the
customers are doing just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been slow, maybe, but I'm certain that it will take
off,'' said Edward Drew, the United Illuminating executive who runs
the Internet billing project.
</P>
<P>
   By rights, that prospect should terrify the folks at Pitney
Bowes Inc. After all, United Illuminating is one of Pitney's
biggest customers, and every electronic bill the utility clocks is
a bill not sent through a Pitney postage meter, or processed
through Pitney's customized bulk mailing systems.
</P>
<P>
   So does that make Pitney _ universally thought of as a
print-on-paper player _ a dinosaur?
</P>
<P>
   Not quite. It was Pitney that helped United Illuminating design
the electronic billing program. Pitney runs its bill-paying Web
site and is aggressively looking to teach other big customers the
ways of e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   As Michael Critelli, Pitney's chairman, sees it, Pitney's
business is messages, however they are relayed. And he figures
Pitney, which is based in Stamford, Conn., can make good money
providing the waterwings for companies that are learning to swim in
Internet waters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet can deliver data much faster than the old ways,
and we want to help customers use it as a tool,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pitney is not billing itself as an Internet specialist per se.
But in recent years copiers, fax machines, postage meters, envelope
stuffers _ in effect, all the hardware that Pitney sells _ have
moved from stand-alone machines to digital devices that are plugged
into computer networks. Pitney already has a cadre of software
writers who specialize in moving documents around in a digital
environment. So, for Pitney, Internet applications represent a
difference of degree, not kind.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Pitney is making ample use of Internet-savvy partners.
Working with Tumbleweed Communications, Pitney has introduced
iSend, a service that uses encryption, passwords and tracking
features to guarantee the privacy and delivery of e-mail. ISend was
originally aimed at law firms and other small businesses that
traffic in sensitive documents. But Pitney has now teamed with SAP,
the huge software company, to market an industrial-strength version
that would enable corporations to track hundreds of secure files as
they move on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Pitney is ready to roll out ClickStamp, which will
let customers buy postage from the Web. Two start-up companies,
Stamps.com Inc. and E-Stamp Corp., under Postal Service
authorization, already have set up similar sites that are beginning
to attract small-business customers.
</P>
<P>
   But Pitney is suing both for royalties, claiming that each uses
patented Pitney technology. And some financial analysts say that
Pitney, with an established brand name and a big budget to tout it,
has a better-than-average chance of catching up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd guess they could grab 35 percent of the market before
long,'' said B. Alexander Henderson, an analyst at Prudential
Securities Research.
</P>
<P>
   And Pitney has plunged modem-first into the so-called e-tailing
market, as a supplier to companies thatsell goods on the Web. For
example, Pitney is pushing a version of iSend to Internet merchants
as a way to confirm orders and generate bills. And it has developed
software to help e-tailers plot out the best way to deliver
products to their customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to think of shipping as a service you offered
warehouses, but these days a shipper is anyone who realizes there's
stuff in the garage that they can auction online,'' said William
Shannon, vice president of product planning for Pitney's
small-business division.
</P>
<P>
   So far, investors seem skeptical that Pitney can pull off its
metamorphosis into an Internet player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pitney is pushing a lot of hype on their Internet
capabilities, but when you crunch the numbers they are not getting
a lot of revenues,'' said James Lundy, a research director at
Gartner Group, a research firm in Stamford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 19, when Pitney released third-quarter results, its
shares plunged $4.4375, to $50.25 _ well off a price above $70 as
recently as July. Pitney's earnings were well ahead of the same
period last year, but analysts say that shareholders were
disappointed that revenues had increased by just 8 percent. Pitney
shares closed at $44.875 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Although Pitney executives say they expect Internet-related
products to eventually yield 30 percent of revenues, e-commerce
still remains a tiny part of Pitney's sales. The bulk of revenues
continue to come from postage meter rentals, financing, bulk
mailing systems and services like running mail rooms and handling
direct marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say investors have been wary of Pitney's shares because
of concerns that the Internet will make inroads into basic mailing
products. But Pitney's Wall Street fans _ and there are many _ say
such worries are unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Street psychology may be negative, but their fundamentals
are outstanding,'' said Jonathan Rosenzweig, an analyst with
Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   And the electronic markets that Pitney is chasing are potential
blockbusters. While older meters required a trip to the post office
to buy refill postage, modern meters can be reloaded by telephone.
In both cases, the Post Office, not Pitney, sells the postage. But
Pitney charges higher rentals for newer digital meters, which it
says are more convenient to use. And the company will offer, for a
fee, to buy the postage for customers and reload the meters
remotely.
</P>
<P>
   International Data Corp., a research firm in Framingham, Mass.,
expects the online market to account for $1.5 billion of postage
sales in three years. On the billing front, Forrester Research
Inc., a firm in Cambridge, Mass., predicts that electronic billing
will account for 13 percent of all consumer bills in five years.
</P>
<P>
   But the pursuit of those markets has Pitney navigating
uncharted, and fiercely competitive, waters. No one yet knows, for
example, whether businesses will prefer to download postage
directly from the Web _ the method used by Stamps.com _ or whether
they will prefer using a lock-box device, as the E-Stamp system
requires. The lock box hooks onto a customer's computers and stores
downloaded postage, which the customer can print out without
connecting to the Internet each time.
</P>
<P>
   Pitney, operating under the names ClickStamp Online and
ClickStamp Plus, is offering both methods. That means it can hedge
its bets until the market chooses one approach over the other, but
it also means Pitney must spread its marketing and research dollars
pretty thin.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As for electronic billing, Pitney runs the risk that the market
will veer away from being biller-centric _ companies billing all of
their customers electronically _ to a payer-centric model in which
customers pay all of their bills at a single Web site. While Pitney
has pursued the biller-centric business, bill consolidators like
Transpoint, CheckFree and Spectrum are now offering payer-centric
services to consumers. Even some early electronic billers suspect
that the one-stop-shopping approach may be the model that makes it.
``We may want to look at that option in the future,'' said Drew of
United Illuminating.
</P>
<P>
   Pitney is keeping its options open here, too. It is talking to
bill consolidators about alliances, and to banks about
payer-centric Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to run Web sites that handle billing for all of a
bank's customers,'' said Karl Schumacher, general manager of the
Pitney division that handles high-speed mailings for huge
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest question mark of all is whether Pitney can
successfully woo the small businesses that make up the fastest
growing market for Internet services. Because small businesses
typically have had no need for postage meters or mail room
management, few have dealt with Pitney in the past.
</P>
<P>
   To court them, in September Pitney came out with PitneyWorks, a
compendium of products that includes Personal Post, a digital
postage meter and scale aimed at low-volume users; various
Web-related shipping and direct marketing software programs and
services, and a line of credit for postage. Pitney is also counting
on ClickStamp to generate small business traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 8 million small businesses out there using stamps,
and until now we had no way to get to them,'' said Marc Breslawsky,
Pitney's president. ``If we can get those customers into our store,
we can sell them profitable items like iSend now, and upgrade them
to digital meters as they grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Those upgraded products may not all be Internet related. Unlike
the Internet start-ups it now competes with, Pitney has a stable of
conventional products that yield a steady cash flow to support its
Internet forays. Indeed, although its stock may be slumping, its
sales and earnings have been solid. Its 1998 revenues of $4.22
billion were 8 percent higher than 1997's $3.92 billion, while its
net income of $576.4 million was up 10 percent from the prior
year's $526 million.
</P>
<P>
   Pitney postage meters still dominate the U.S. market, despite
solid competition from digitally savvy companies like Neopost and
Francotyp-Postalia AG of Germany. And analysts expect Pitney to
garner 30 percent of the international postage meter market by
2004, up from just about 14 percent now.
</P>
<P>
   Companies numerous and huge, including US West, Cigna and
General Motors, are using Pitney's equipment to address, stuff,
stamp and mail bills and customized literature. Many others have
hired Pitney to run their mailing operations. In either model, the
client provides Pitney with demographic information about
customers, and Pitney sees to it that, say, a young family's bill
comes with an insert touting products for children, while a retired
widow's bill might include data on care for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet has certainly not lessened the importance of
personalized content inside an envelope, or of customized printing
on the outside,'' Critelli said.
</P>
<P>
   Even with paper mailings, computer networks are playing a role.
Pitney now sells systems that help companies glean custom-tailored
mailing lists from e-commerce Web sites, and use them for direct
marketing _ or, in the case of smaller businesses, hire Pitney to
handle the mailing for them. It has database products that
doublecheck the accuracy of addresses and their listed occupants
against post office records, so as to guarantee error-free mailing
lists. And, it is testing a system at General Motors Acceptance
Corp.'s mailroom in Detroit whereby Pitney will scan some of the
nonpersonal incoming mail into a computer, and deliver it to
employees electronically.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paper isn't going away, and only Pitney has the
bricks-and-mortar products to offer a hybrid approach,'' said
Lundy, the Gartner analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Pitney has even figured out a novel way to get the float on a
customer's money. Pitney st up a chartered bank in Utah in 1998.
Then last June, Pitney's Financial Services division started
offering free postage, representing about a 2 percent discount on
postage costs, to customers who put a lump sum into a reserve
account at the Utah bank. Pitney draws from the reserve to pay the
customer's postage bills to the Post Office as they are accrued.
</P>
<P>
   That, in essence, gives Pitney access to funds at well below its
usual 6 percent cost of capital. ``We've effectively coupled
financial services with postage transactions, which means we're
borrowing less expensively,'' said Matthew Kissner, president of
Pitney's small business and financial solutions unit.
</P>
<P>
   Pitney will offer the discount to ClickStamp users as well, a
move that analysts say may help pull small businesses to Pitney's
site _ and in turn, help the company trade them up to more
lucrative products.
</P>
<P>
   It is that kind of cascading effect that keeps many analysts in
Pitney's corner. ``They are in prime position to transition small-
and home-office people from stamps to metering to full mail
services,'' said Henderson, who has kept a strong ``buy''
recommendation on Pitney stock for three years. ``They're using the
Internet as a trojan horse to pull in other services.''

NEW TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENT FUND SAYS IT HAS RAISED $600 MILLION
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Calif., Mass., N.J., Conn.)   (jw) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Redpoint Ventures, a technology-focused venture
capital firm created in August through the combination of Brentwood
Venture Capital and Institutional Venture Partners, plans to
announce on Monday that it has raised $600 million in its first
fund _ an amount thought to be the largest effort for a first-time
technology fund.
</P>
<P>
   Redpoint, based in Menlo Park, Calif., plans to specialize in
Internet businesses, including companies devoted to broadband, or
high speed, telecommunications technology for Internet use.
</P>
<P>
   Redpoint has already made commitments to several investments,
including a $15 million stake in Reflect.com, a Web-based,
customized beauty business started by Procter &AMP; Gamble, which
contributed $35 million. Tim Haley and Geoff Yang, Redpoint
managing directors, are on the board of Reflect.com.
</P>
<P>
   Internet companies that received venture funding from Redpoint's
predecessors include Excite, Ask Jeeves, Tivo, Xylan, Stamps.com
and WebTV.
</P>
<P>
   According to the research firm Venture Economics, the $600
million commitment to Redpoint makes it the largest first fund
raised by a technology-focused venture capital firm. While in part
this reflects investors' interest in new Internet companies, it is
also attributable to the fact that Redpoint is the combination of
two well-known firms rather than an entirely new entity. Brentwood
was founded in 1972 in Southern California, while Institutional
Venture Partners was founded in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole premise of this is we're not starting a new fund;
we're building on the platform that IVP and Brentwood had put in
place,'' said Tom Dial, a Redpoint managing director. ``In no case
would we have been able to raise a fund this large without the
history of the two funds and the partners.''
</P>
<P>
   In their August announcement, Institutional Venture Partners and
Brentwood said they would combine their efforts in Redpoint, as
well as a second firm, Palladium, which would be devoted to
biotechnology and other investments related to health care.
</P>
<P>
   With the explosion of the Internet, many diversified venture
capital funds have found it difficult to reconcile the torrid pace
and potentially huge returns of Web startups with the longer time
frames and often smaller returns on new drug companies. Some funds
have virtually abandoned life sciences investments, but Sam
Collela, Institutional Venture Partners' founder, has insisted that
venture capital will have a continuing role in health care. He will
be a managing director of Palladium, while playing a smaller role
at Redpoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a diversified fund, there's just less synergy
around the table when the partners get together to talk about these
deals,'' Dial said. ``There's a real advantage to having six or
seven partners around the table, all of whom are really
knowledgeable about the Internet. It just lifts the dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   Redpoint's institutional investors are all previous investors in
Brentwood Venture Capital and Institutional Venture Partners,
including ARCO, the Carnegie Corp. of New York, Duke Foundation,
Ford Foundation, Harvard University, the Howard Hughes Medical
Institute, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, the Mutual Life Insurance Company of
New York, Princeton University, Rockefeller Foundation, Stanford
University, Pfizer Inc. and Yale University.

REPUBLICANS PLAN TO OFFER ONLINE ACCESS FOR LOYALISTS
</HEADLINE>
 
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (nk)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an effort to raise money, embrace supporters and bypass the
news media, the Republican National Committee plans to begin
offering subscriptions in January to a ``family friendly'' Internet
service that will deliver the party's messages directly to
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Party officials say they plan to market Internet access to
registered Republicans, political donors and subscribers of
political publications _ a target audience of as many as 8 million
people. The program is to be announced Tuesday in Washington. Big
contributors will qualify for free subscriptions to the service,
while other supporters will pay the standard Internet access fee of
$19.95 a month.
</P>
<P>
   The party will receive a small portion of those monthly
subscription fees as donations. Party leaders will not say how much
they will take, but they say the greatest benefits of the plan will
be political. Unlike Web sites, which require some degree of active
effort before they are viewed, the Internet service allows the
party to send specific messages to supporters whenever they connect
to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Al Gore double-speaks on his record on the nuclear test
ban treaty, we'll get our response in their hands the same minute
as it reaches a state party chairman,'' said Larry Purpuro, deputy
chief of staff for the Republican committee and director of what is
called the e.GOP program.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Democrats are considering proposals from several
Internet companies to offer a dial-up service, Joe Andrew, national
chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said such a service
would be ``a very minor part'' of the party's online strategy. The
Democrats, Andrew said, are more interested in building
``communities of interest'' online using tools like Web sites and
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew said the strategy of offering Internet service was
``irrelevant but for the dollars'' and illustrated the Republicans'
approach to politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need money, and they win by raising money,'' he said.
``We need people who believe in our issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Subscribers to the Republicans' Internet service, in addition to
instant access to the party's stance on current events, will
receive an e-mail address, GOPnet.com, that identifies their
political affiliation. They will also get to see where, as donors,
their money goes. Subscribers will receive previews of the party's
television advertisements and political mailings, and the chance to
participate in members-only political discussions online.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican service will be family friendly, Purpuro said,
because pornographic Internet material will be filtered.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of a party-sponsored Internet service resolves a
troublesome issue for political parties in the Internet era. Party
officials have been concerned that their role as purveyors of
political information would be threatened in a world in which
everyone can be a publisher.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good example of a 19th-century institution trying to
adapt to a new battleground,'' said Bruce Bimber, director of the
Center for Information Technology and Society at the University of
California at Santa Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the Internet service corresponds with the Republican
Party's tradition of treating membership like a club, said Michael
Cornfield, a research professor at George Washington University who
studies online politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a bid for parties to gain a part in people's lives the
way they did before the decline of the machines,'' Professor
Cornfield said.
</P>
<P>
   The major parties are joining more and more groups that are
establishing Internet services for their members. Banks, sports
teams and even the rock star David Bowie have set up ``affinity
services'' for their customers and fans. The AFL-CIO recently
introduced an Internet service for its members.
</P>
<P>
   The downside for groups that offer these services is that
consumers might blame the groups for technical problems, not the
Internet companies that run the machinery. The Republicans'
service, for example, will be run by Big Planet, a national
Internet service provider.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll have people saying, `I was using the Republicans'
service, and it wasn't any good,''' said Zia Daniell Wigder, an
analyst for Jupiter Communications, an Internet research firm.
``The customers don't know who to blame.''
</P>
<P>
   Political parties also face legal issues in providing Internet
service. Federal election laws impose limits on parties' roles in
promoting candidates. For example, a party can present information
about polls and newspaper editorials, but if party officials
explicitly direct the public to vote for or against a candidate,
the act counts as a campaign contribution.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet complicates the legal issues further. The Federal
Election Commission is currently dissecting a number of
Internet-related questions, including whether a link from one Web
site to a campaign site can count as a contribution. If such
practices do qualify as contributions, then the act of promoting a
candidate on the Internet service can be counted against how much
cash the party could give to a campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Also, under campaign finance bills currently moving through
Congress, raising money through subscriptions to an Internet
service could be banned altogether. Such funds qualify as ``soft
money,'' which would be prohibited under at least one bill awaiting
action.
</P>
<P>
   ``If something like that happens, we'll have to go back to the
drawing board,'' said Thomas J. Josefiak, chief counsel for the
Republican National Committee. ``If the law changes, we have to
change everything.''

ONLINE COMMERCE COMPANIES CONTINUE TO SQUANDER PUBLIC'S TRUST
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DENISE CARUSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If dot-com companies are really trying to inspire consumer
confidence as they embark upon what could well be their
make-or-break holiday season, they must be taking oxymoron pills.
Under the hot light of recent scrutiny, their increasingly
questionable business practices are becoming public, casting long
overdue doubt on the credibility of much of the commercial
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the Internet allows people and companies to
misrepresent themselves with impunity is well known to online
veterans, who after years of sending and receiving April Fool's
gags and imitation news releases look askance at everything they
get online unless they can verify its source.
</P>
<P>
   But the juggernaut that is now the consumer Internet has foisted
an avalanche of half-truths, lies-by-omission and outright fraud on
a new, more naive online population. Unsophisticated Net users
rarely question who or what is operating behind their computer
screens and, thus, are far easier to snooker.
</P>
<P>
   Their complacency is not completely unwarranted. The Internet,
particularly the Web, looks a lot like a computer version of print
or broadcast media. But it is neither. As a rule, it has not
adopted the kinds of standards and practices that are assumed in
traditional media, where advertisements and paid announcements are
labeled and conflicts of interest are, at least in theory,
disclosed as a matter of course.
</P>
<P>
   These disclosures are what provide readers, listeners and
viewers of traditional media the context to judge what they read,
hear or see. But it is not incumbent upon today's commercial
Internet, either by tradition or law, to provide such context.
</P>
<P>
   The online credibility issue first made international news in
early 1999, when Amazon.com was called to task for accepting money
from publishers for its purportedly independent book reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, more examples of online half-truths and lies have
come to light. Most recently, The New York Times and USA Today both
reported that a ``fashion photographer'' was starting an e-commerce
auction Web site, selling fashion models' eggs to would-be parents.
He is also, apparently, an established merchant in soft-core
pornography, a fact that came to light after the global publicity
the stories had generated.
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, DrKoop.com, the Web site of the former surgeon
general, Dr. C. Everett Koop, was publicly embarrassed for taking
commissions on products and services sold through the site without
disclosing such financial arrangements. Changes were made on the
site in response to the criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Less visible but just as pernicious are the growing number of
``comparison shopping'' sites for products on the Internet, sites
that do not disclose the methods by which their listings are
derived. Although some of these sites are supported solely by
advertising revenues, many listings are based on which companies
paid to be listed with them.
</P>
<P>
   Equally rankling are the portals and search engines that deliver
Web addresses, ostensibly in response to a consumer's query but in
reality based on paid key words. Advertisers buy key words from
portals to make it to the top of the search-results list _ the
functional equivalent of companies that name themselves
``AAAAAAAcme'' for telephone directories _ but portals rarely tell
their users of the practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have to assume that there is an advertising influence
on almost all the content they see online,'' wrote the online
newsletter eMarketer in March 1999, shortly after the Amazon story
broke. ``For instance, here is what comes up on a search for
`digital camera' on Lycos: A (paid) banner for digital cameras; a
(paid) link to an online bookstore offering books on cameras; the
(unpaid) search result links.''
</P>
<P>
   This is business as usual to people who know how the industry
works, but not to consumers, as seen in the Federal Trade
Commission's struggle to investigate hundreds of claims of
fraudulent practices and sites on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the FTC held a workshop to educate online companies
about disclosure regulations and, in particular, to inform them
that existing consumer protection laws did in fact apply on the
Internet and to explain how the laws would be enforced.
</P>
<P>
   Some Internet companies are doing a good job of disclosure and,
in fact, are using it as a selling point for their services. For
example, the online bill paying service Paymybills.com, makes
virtually all information about its service, its company, its
policies, partners and business practices available within two
clicks of its home page.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the business of consumer trust,'' says John Tedesco,
the chief executive of Paymybills.com. ``We consider the language
on our site to be a legal contract with our customers. If it ever
leaked out that we didn't abide by our policies, it would destroy
our business. So we clearly disclose, and we hold by them.''
</P>
<P>
   Contrast this with Amazon.com, which promised after its
paid-reviews debacle to make the company's policy more visible.
Amazon has buried its disclosure at the very bottom of its lengthy
``Site Guide'' page, beneath a link called ``Co-Op Disclosure'' _
not exactly a descriptive title, or the first place a consumer
might look for such information.
</P>
<P>
   Credibility of online information is a growing concern both
within and outside the industry. Several organizations _ including
the Internet Content Coalition, the Online Privacy Alliance and the
Pew Charitable Trusts (in which this writer participated) _ have
addressed credibility by producing advertising and privacy
guidelines and projects focused on disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, Ziff-Davis founded an industry group called the
Council for Internet Commerce (www.commercestandard.com) to try to
improve the customer experience online by implementing standards
for disclosure of business practices.
</P>
<P>
   James Hake, founder and chairman of the project, said that the
level of agreement between the 200 companies that voted on the
first draft of the standard was ``so high that I need to go back
and make sure they really meant it.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I'm afraid they might have been answering from the
point of view of what the consumer wants to hear, instead of what
they were actually willing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   But if today's practices continue for much longer _ or, as
eMarketer put it, if the question as to what's fact and what's for
sale is not made clear to consumers _ the use of the Net as a
commercial medium could drop precipitously as consumers realize
they are being gamed.
</P>
<P>
   If dot-coms think it is too much trouble to implement disclosure
practices, they will soon discover it is a lot more trouble to win
back consumer trust once it is lost.

FORGET JINGLES, VIEWERS CLAMOR FOR CATCHY TUNES IN COMMERCIALS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Mich., Ill., Mass.)   (jw) 
 By PATRICIA WINTERS LAURO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The advertising industry may be playing your song _ in
commercials, that is.
</P>
<P>
   These days it seems you cannot turn on the television or radio
without hearing a popular tune in commercials. And recording
artists who once might have spurned ads as a sellout seem happy to
license songs they originally released on records or CDs _ for a
price, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Just this year more than 130 ad campaigns used songs originally
released as records or CDs but now licensed temporarily for use in
advertising, according to Source Maythenyi, an advertising
information service based in Boca Raton, Fla. Some examples include
the Beatles' ``Come Together'' for Nortel Networks; the Who's ``Who
are You'' for Gateway computers; and Dean Martin's ``That's Amore''
for Dodge Neon.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsi-Cola, Motorola and Apple Computer each used a Rolling
Stones hit in the last year or so. And the electronica artist
Fatboy Slim hit the mother lode in advertising this year: Kodak,
MasterCard, Nike and Coca-Cola each used one of his songs for a
commercial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's huge, and it really runs the gamut: opera, jazz, rock 'n'
roll and a lot from unknown groups that play alternative music _
everyone's looking for the next new band,'' said Pamela Maythenyi,
president of the Source.
</P>
<P>
   Madison Avenue has always borrowed popular songs, called
licensed music, for commercials, but the vast majority of ad
campaigns relied on original music made especially for advertising.
In the last decade, however, licensing songs for commercials has
become more prevalent and the pace has picked up considerably in
the last two to three years, said Ms. Maythenyi and others.
</P>
<P>
   One difference lately is that many songs being used are not
mass-market hits. Indeed, much of it might not even ring a bell
with the general public _ and that is one big reason it is getting
used. The latest idea on Madison Avenue is to discover innovative
new music that reaches with a particular audience, usually young
people.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the use of all the kinds of music is the need to get
noticed in today's fast-paced, multichannel media environment. A
recognizable tune might be just enough to stop a remote
control-happy TV viewer from zapping a commercial. Hit songs are
the equivalent of brand names that the public recognizes and makes
an emotional connection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big music is one of the ways to stand out and instantly have
an audience for whatever it is you have to say,'' said Chris Wall,
an executive creative director at Ogilvy &AMP; Mather Worldwide, part
of the WPP Group, who said he used licensed music sparingly. ``It's
like celebrities, there's common ground. Plus, music is very
important to anyone who grew up after the 1950s.''
</P>
<P>
   Music borrowed from the pop culture also creates an immediate
image for a product. Music speaks a language that is both universal
to a group and unique to each listener.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like ads in general are less product-focused and have
become much more about selling a lifestyle or an attitude,''
explained Ben Davis, a music producer at Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi in New
York, part of Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi PLC. ``And a big part of lifestyle
or attitude depends on what music you listen to. So licensed music
has become a good way to convey that.''
</P>
<P>
   The move to less widely known music reflects the rise of niche
brands, niche media and niche marketing. An advertiser doesn't need
an expensive mass hit when a more obscure, semi-pop song might be
the track that reaches its niche youth market.
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen of America introduced the New Beetle last year with
an entire campaign of songs by bands that were virtually unknown to
the mass audience. Created by Arnold Advertising in Boston, a unit
of Arnold Communications, the campaign featured songs from bands
like the Orb, Spiritualized and Fluke, all designed to resonate
with people 18 to 34. Volkswagen has received hundreds of requests
about the music, so much that the company's Web site, www.vw.com,
now prominently lists the names of the songs and the bands for each
of its commercials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to be too commercial or predictable,'' said Liz
Vanzura, director of marketing for Volkswagen of America in Auburn
Hills, Mich. ``We pride ourselves on being different: You're not
going to see us use the latest Madonna CD. We're looking for the
more obscure.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Fatboy Slim's success in advertising is said to have
actually predated his current big success in the music community.
Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi licensed Fatboy Slim's ``Rockafeller Skank'' for
a spot earlier this year for Kodak Max film because of his niche
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was music that our target market would recognize, but it
wasn't something you were going to find at the top of the charts,''
said Eric Korte, music director at Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi in New York.
``In some ways that makes it more interesting to the teens. It's
just the fact that you're buying into the equity of a piece of
music that teens are going to think is cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Ad agencies increasingly want to use music that sounds pure and
does not sound like advertising. The old American jingle _ once a
mainstay of advertising _ is largely reviled by the public as
``everything that's wrong, dishonest and insincere'' about
advertising, Wall said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For Volkswagen, using new music has also given the company the
added cachet of being something of a patron of emerging new music.
And the recording artists, for the most part, were delighted to be
in a Volkswagen commercial more for the exposure than for the
money, said Lance Jensen, executive vice president-creative
director on Volkswagen at Arnold Advertising. The agency is now
even courted by artists who send tapes hoping to be in an upcoming
commercial.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are completely interested and don't view it as a sellout.
They view it as working in a medium of their time, and our time
right now is a commercial time, a video is a commercial, only it's
for the band,'' Jensen said. ``A lot of this music is such an
amazing opportunity for these songs to be heard.''
</P>
<P>
   How much have times changed? A few years ago, Volkswagen set a
commercial to an old somewhat obscure 1980s song called ``Da, Da,
Da'' about two guys in a car who pick up a smelly old sofa chair.
The band Trio re-released the CD after the commercial, and featured
a sticker that said: ``as heard in the commercial,'' Jensen said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not all artists like the idea of licensing music for
commercials. REM did not care for the remake of its song ``I Am
Superman'' in a spot for Lotus, Wall said. Ogilvy &AMP; Mather, which
made the commercial, bought the rights to the song from the
original group that recorded it in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some new bands and writers see it as a new avenue and
acceptable avenue to get music out to a lot of people,'' said Todd
Brabek, executive vice president of the American Society of
Composers, Authors and Publishers. ``Others feel totally contrary
to that and are very averse to their music being used in a
marketing context to sell product.''
</P>
<P>
   Licensing songs for use in commercials is a big source of
revenue for music publishers and for estates of deceased artists,
said Irv Lichtman, deputy editor of Billboard Magazine. Among the
tunes heard in recent years by late artists include Louis
Armstrong's ``What A Wonderful World'' and Nat King Cole's
``L-O-V-E.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With diminishing income from traditional sources, the estates
are facing reality and of course, ad dollars can be significant,''
Lichtman said.
</P>
<P>
   The fee to use a hit song in a commercial starts at about
$150,000, according to Korte. To use the actual recording might
cost another $150,000, he added. The fees usually cover use for one
year and are renegotiated for long-running campaigns, Lichtman
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's way more expensive to license a hit song, maybe 10 times
more than it costs to make original music,'' Korte said. ``And it's
much more than that when you're talking about something like
Beetles' songs.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the trend right now, original music in advertising
certainly isn't dead. Volkswagen is distributing its own CD of a
much-requested song called ``Jung at Heart,'' by Master Cylinder,
that it commissioned as an original work for a new Jetta
commercial. And Ford Motor Co. commissioned the original song,
``Just Wave Hello,'' for its new millennium advertising featuring
the young Welsh soprano Charlotte Church. The song will be released
to the public this month as the first track on Ms. Church's
upcoming CD..
</P>
<P>
   But it's the rare advertising sound that gets released as its
own soundtrack. And in the end, that may be why the advertising
community likes prerecorded hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every client with a jingle would only pray that it would
become a CD,'' Ms. Maythenyi said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The ESPN Inc. sports empire exists seemingly to
propagate wildly. It has spawned six domestic cable television
networks and 20 more networks worldwide, a magazine, an Internet
service, books, videos, games, a radio network, music, pagers and
pay-per-view programming.
</P>
<P>
   After two decades of feeding sports fans mass quantities of
highlights, scores and events, the company, based in Bristol,
Conn., decided the time had come to feed them full of food and
beer.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the first ESPN Zone opened in Baltimore, followed last
July by the second, in Chicago. Baltimore's Zone got nationwide
attention as the site for ``Monday Night Football's'' pregame and
half-time shows, where stage-struck fans chewed behind the host
Chris Berman.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-September, the biggest, loudest, glitziest ESPN Zone
bowed in Manhattan on Broadway at 42nd, near the Disney Store and
the New Amsterdam Theater, two other Manhattan outposts of the Walt
Disney Co &UR; . &LR; , and two blocks south of a third, the new studio for
``Good Morning America.''
</P>
<P>
   Creating the ESPN Zone is not a surprise strategy. An
ESPN-themed line of restaurants was on the to-do list of Michael
Eisner, the Disney chairman, when the Mouse Kingdom acquired ESPN's
parent, Capital Cities/ABC, in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, Eisner vowed to extend ESPN into semi-fine
dining. ``It was a great synergistic brand extension opportunity,''
said Art Levitt, the president of Disney Regional Entertainment,
which designs and runs the ESPN Zones. ``We wouldn't have gotten
into this business without ESPN. It's a world-renowned name and a
natural for this kind of business. Then we had to turn a
one-dimensional TV product into a three-dimensional entertainment
complex.''
</P>
<P>
   Sports bars are usually small to midsize establishments with
satellite dishes bringing in games to one or two dozen TV sets _
not four-floor monoliths like the Times Square ESPN Zone. Usually,
they are intimate, crowded, memorabilia-packed places with regulars
rooting for their home teams and razzing the few cheering
out-of-town rivals.
</P>
<P>
   There are stand-alone restaurants like the Sporting Club in
TriBeCa or Mickey Mantle's on Central Park South, which trades on
the late Yankee's name, good food and baseball artwork.
</P>
<P>
   There are chains like Hooter's, best known for fried food and
cleavage. And there is the Official All-Star Cafe chain, which has
an outlet on 45th Street and Broadway that pays massive tribute to
the athletes Shaquille O'Neal, Andre Agassi, Joe Montana, Tiger
Woods and Monica Seles who made small investments in the chain. But
its future is uncertain because of the Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing
of its parent, Planet Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started, All-Star was very successful,'' Levitt said.
``Even if it had stayed successful, we would have gone forward,
because our brand is so differentiated from anyone else's.''
</P>
<P>
   Jill Krutick, a media and entertainment analyst for Salomon
Smith Barney, said, ``Obviously everything depends on their
execution, but ESPN's existing branding gives them a leg up on the
competition. The restaurants give ESPN a lot of potential for
cross-promotion and licensing opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   She said Disney estimated the average cost of building a Zone at
$15 million to $20 million, but the New York City outlet cost
considerably more. ESPN Zones in Atlanta and Washington are now
being built.
</P>
<P>
   The Disney Imagineers who designed the ESPN Zone were chasing a
concept that is reliant on the ubiquitous ESPN name and one that it
hopes will shield it from the shakeout in theme restaurants that
killed the Motown Cafe, Comedy Nation, Television City and the
Fashion Cafe in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   For Disney, the ESPN Zone is a huge, self-referential fun house
with generally good food _ Levitt said food must be the reason for
return business, especially among non-fans _ and an unparalleled
viewing experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never want the fan to be far from the game,'' Levitt said.
``No matter where you are, you have to be connected.''
</P>
<P>
   And it never lets you forget you're on ESPN turf.
</P>
<P>
   At every turn there is the belief that devoted fans possess a
not-so secret desire to frolic in ESPN's headquarters, choose
highlights for ``SportsCenter,'' swap athlete nicknames with Berman
and concoct hip neologisms with Stuart (``Boo-Yah!'') Scott, a
``SportsCenter'' anchor.
</P>
<P>
   The ESPN Zone is no mere song of itself; it is a 15-hour-a-day
medley, where patrons dine amid replicas of its studio sets, eat on
place mats with printed scores pulled off the ESPN.com Web site,
and watch games on 220 TV sets _ including those mounted
strategically in rest rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Three aspects of the Zone distinguish it.
</P>
<P>
   First, there is no memorabilia _ a potentially risky ploy
because autographed artifacts and game-used bats, balls and jerseys
and sticks provide a comfort zone for fans. Instead, artists were
commissioned to create sports oeuvres connected to the cities the
Zones are in. The Manhattan restaurant features the stained-glass
portrait of Jackie Robinson, Joe Namath in the guise of the
Prometheus statue in Rockefeller Center and a portrait of the
former Knick, Walt Frazier, in the style of Thomas Gainsborough's
``The Blue Boy,'' and a computer generated photographic portrait of
Babe Ruth made out of 2,000 Yankee baseball cards.
</P>
<P>
   Second, there is the second-floor viewing room: a huge wall with
a dozen 36-inch monitors and two giant screens contemplated with a
benumbed focus by occupants in 11 leather recliners with speakers
imbedded in the headrests. The denizens of the loungers and those
of upper tiers of tables and banquettes can choose the games they
want to hear by remote control.
</P>
<P>
   But beware: the act of eating from a retractable tray connected
to the custom-made recliner while distractedly trying to choose
from 14 sports events to watch can land the that melted cheese in
your lap.
</P>
<P>
   And gaining entry to these special perches at peak times, like
Sunday afternoons for professional football, requires reservations
and $20 for 1 p.m., 4 p.m. and 8 p.m. games.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the fourth floor, 10,000-foot arena with
interactive games that simulate downhill biking, bass fishing,
horse-racing, parachute jumping, and Indy car racing, and cost
$1.50 to $6.50 to play.
</P>
<P>
   There are tamer games like the stand-in-one-spot Pop-A-Shot
basketball game for fans reluctant to work up a sweat from a
vigorous interactive workout. In all its intensive planning, the
ESPN Zone forgot one crucial element to sports bar cum arena: the
showers.

agencies and companies who buy those ads have relied heavily on
that data to build their businesses, and until now they have been
generous about sharing it freely with each other. Now one of the
Internet's biggest advertisers is raising the question of whether
that data belongs to anyone but the advertisers, and the resulting
debate could shape the future of the advertiser-publisher
relationship. By Bob Tedeschi.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The relatively tranquil weather pattern that has persisted
across much of the country will remain for the next few days as an
area of high pressure aloft stays entrenched across the central and
eastern parts of the nation. Farther west, a series of storms will
move through the Northwest, bringing periods of unsettled weather
to the western states.
</P>
<P>
   The Northeast will have another cool day Monday, as brisk winds
from the northwest continue to usher cool air into the region. In
addition, there will be some scattered clouds across interior parts
of New England and the Middle Atlantic States as weak disturbances
move quickly across the region. Locations along the northern
Atlantic seaboard will have more sunshine than clouds.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south, high pressure just offshore of the Southeast will
promote sunny skies and warm afternoon readings. A jet-stream
disturbance will bring some cumulus clouds to parts of Louisiana.
Meanwhile, increasing winds from the west and southwest over the
northern Plains and central Mississippi Valley will combine with
abundant sunshine to bring record high temperatures into the area.
</P>
<P>
   Showers and mountain snow showers are likely in the
intermountain West in the wake of a cold front. Some of the cool
air will even reach into the Southwest, keeping readings below
seasonal levels. The Northwest will stay cloudy with showers and
periods of snow in the Bitterroots. It will turn rather rainy and
breezy along the Northwest coast, as another Pacific storm
approaches the region.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Warmth in the West
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Boise, Idaho, and Rawlins, Wyo., had their warmest
days ever in November. In recent weeks, numerous air masses have
penetrated the interior West from the Pacific Ocean. These doses of
Pacific air are typically cool and moist when coming off the ocean.
As this air ascends the western ranges, it loses some of its
moisture in the form of clouds and precipitation. Upon descending
the east slopes, this drier air becomes warmer than when it started
its trek across the mountains. A surge of chilly air from the north
will end this warmth across the northern mountains on Monday.

 THE THROWAWAY CELL PHONE  (ART ADV: Photo is being sent to NYT

 By TERESA RIORDAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   We may live in a disposable society, but is the world ready for
throwaway cell phones? Randice-Lisa Altschul thinks so.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Altschul, a full-time inventor in Cliffside Park, N.J., has
patented a technology that she says can be used to manufacture
cellular phones so inexpensively that they could be sold for a
fixed amount of air time _ as long-distance calling cards are _ and
then tossed in the garbage once their minutes have been used up.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Altschul, with the help of consulting engineers, essentially
took a flexible circuit, which forms the innards of many cell
phones today, and elongated it.
</P>
<P>
   This, she says, enables the flex circuit to be folded back upon
itself, much like a large ribbon, thereby eliminating the need for
most of the plastic housing found in other cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   ``The circuit itself becomes the body of the unit,'' Ms.
Altschul said. ``And it becomes its own built-in tamper-proof
system because as soon as you cut it open, you break the circuits
and the phone goes dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, she contends, her technology can be used to greatly
reduce the costs of manufacturing any electronic device that uses a
flexible circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Patent 5,965,848 was granted in October to Ms. Altschul and Lee
Volte, a former senior vice president for research and development
at the toy maker, Tyco.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Altschul, 39, hit her first invention home run when she was
25. She had created a cops-vs.-cocaine-dealers game that took place
on a map of Miami, and she persuaded the executive producer of the
``Miami Vice'' television series to let her call it the Miami Vice
Game. Since then, Ms. Altschul has invented numerous other games,
most notably Barbie's 30th Birthday Game.
</P>
<P>
   She has also recently patented other children's gear. Applause
Inc. is selling her patented stuffed animals, which feature
pocketlike arms into which children can insert their arms. These
enable the child to wave the stuffed animal's arms or to make it
seem as if the animal is capable of giving hugs.
</P>
<P>
   And Ms. Altschul is looking to license her ``interactive
cereal'' _ cereal sculpted into monster shapes that crumple into
soggy heaps when doused with milk.
</P>
<P>
   So how did a toy-and-game inventor come to think up a new
cellular phone technology?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was driving in my car, and I kept losing my cell signal, and
I wanted to throw my phone out the window. And _ bingo _ I came up
with the idea,'' Ms. Altschul said. She immediately called her
patent lawyer to see whether anyone else had patented such an idea.
No one had.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greatest asset I have over everyone else in that business
is my toy mentality,'' she said. ``An engineer's mentality is to
make something last, to make it durable. A toy's life span is about
an hour, then the kid throws it away. You get it, you play with it
and _ boom _ it's gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Ms. Altschul says her phone, which wouldn't require any
entangling contracts or billing agreements, would appeal primarily
to children, to harried mothers and to travelers who don't want to
have to worry about keeping track of yet another expensive
electronic device.
</P>
<P>
   She estimates that a phone with 60 minutes of air time could be
produced for about $14 and would retail for about $20 _ perhaps not
through normal retail channels, but, rather, as a marketing
gimmick. To lure more lunch customers, for example, a restaurant
like McDonald's might sell, at cost, a phone imprinted with the
golden arches logo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the ultimate in-your-face advertising,'' Ms. Altschul
said.
</P>
<P>
   For that kind of money, though, don't expect any frills. The
phone, powered by a six-volt battery, works for outgoing calls
only, and it doesn't have a liquid crystal display.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Altschul said the same technology could be used for a host
of electronic devices, from hand-held electronic games to
programmable fast-food debit cards.
</P>
<P>
   One of these might be a card sold for use with state lotteries
or given away by casinos as promotional freebies. ``It's basically
a slot machine in your pocket,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She also says her cellular phone could double as a credit card
when it has a magnetic strip built into it.

   ``The customer could swipe the phone instead of a credit card
and upon approval of his purchase receive instant gratification in
the form of more free air time,'' Ms. Altschul said. ``The more he
uses his cell phone as a credit card, the more air time he will
get.''
</P>
<P>
   This would, of course, require an arrangement between retailers,
cellular service providers and a credit card company. It would
require a longer-lasting power source than the 60-minute battery
Ms. Altschul envisions with the purely disposable cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Altschul says she comes up with as many as 20 to 30 new
ideas a week, but for the moment she is focusing most of her
efforts on the phone and its various manifestations.
</P>
<P>
   So far she has sunk more than $1 million of her own money into
the project. ``I'm talking to investors,'' she said. ``I'm at the
point where I need the guys with deeper pockets. Everything I own
is on the line for this project.''

A BIOGRAPHER IN SEARCH OF A NEW PUBLISHER  
 DUBIOUS CALL AT SMART MONEY  
 ADDRESSING THE PUNDIT PLAGUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If the literary agent Richard Curtis has his way,
there will be one more chapter written in the hand-wringing saga of
St. Martin's Press and its canceled biography of Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the abrupt recall by St. Martin's last month of
``Fortunate Son: George W. Bush and the Making of an American
President,'' Curtis is trolling for another company that would be
willing to publish the title, which was abandoned after reports
that the author, J.H. Hatfield, was a federal parolee who had been
imprisoned for plotting to kill his boss in a car bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are several publishers that are interested in this,''
Curtis said, noting, with understatement, that the talks are
``delicate and complicated because the previous experience was
delicate and complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   After St. Martin's recalled the biography, the rights to publish
the book reverted to the author, which left his agent free to
search for a new taker.
</P>
<P>
   So why bother, given his author's severely damaged reputation?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, has the book been discredited?'' said Curtis. ``I'm
asking a question with a question. And so my answer is that I want
to focus on the veracity of the book.''
</P>
<P>
   Curtis said he was not sure whether a new publisher would
include the book's disputed afterword. ``All I can say for the
moment is that all these things are up for discussion,'' he said.
``When I actually have a deal, and I know what is going to be in
the book, I promise to tell.''
</P>
<P>
   The author, Hatfield, has retreated to his home in Arkansas
without addressing whether his resume includes criminal
convictions. And he has refused to respond to messages left for him
seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis said the report of a criminal record was a sensitive
topic that he had not discussed with Hatfield, whom he said had
contracts to write four books for other publishers, none of which
he would identify.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Jim is ready to discuss his background, I will,'' said
Curtis. He added: ``It's the one area of conversation that I've
refrained from bringing up. It's kind of like, don't ask, don't
tell.''

   Advertising Cover Tests Standards of Magazine Industry
</P>
<P>
   Why would Smart Money, the financial magazine published jointly
by Hearst Magazines and Dow Jones, feature a photograph of the
actor Jerry Orbach on the cover, smiling benignly as he steps out
of a taxi?
</P>
<P>
   Because it is not an actual cover of Smart Money. Instead, it is
an advertisement for TD Waterhouse Investor Services. Inside the
back ``cover'' is an application to open an account.
</P>
<P>
   Although the TD Waterhouse cover was literally a cover wrap, an
extra cover that enclosed the real cover of the magazine's November
issue, it was not easy to distinguish the two. The title ``Smart
Money'' on the cover wrap appeared exactly as it regularly does on
the actual cover, and the tag line that appears on every issue _
``The Wall Street Journal Magazine of Personal Business'' _ was in
its usual spot.
</P>
<P>
   About a third of Smart Money subscribers _ 200,000 of them _
received magazines with the TD Waterhouse cover wrap. It caught the
eye of Marlene Kahan, executive director of the American Society of
Magazine Editors, who called the publishing director of the
magazine, Christopher Ambiase, to complain.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kahan said the cover wrap tested the limits of the society's
guidelines, which for advertising pages and special advertising
sections, read: ``Any page of advertising that contains text or
design elements that have an editorial appearance must be clearly
and conspicuously identified with the words `advertising' or
`advertisement' horizontally at or near the center or the top of
the page in type at least equal in size and weight to the
publication's normal editorial body type face.'' No such disclaimer
appeared on Smart Money's TD Waterhouse cover wrap.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really goes back to the pressures that all magazines are
facing,'' Ms. Kahan said. ``Everyone tries to be creative and
value-added, but when you sell out on your cover _ even on a cover
wrap that looks like a cover _ it's a bad thing. It erodes
credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Magazines, facing an increasingly crowded marketplace, are more
frequently bending to advertisers' demands for more versatile and
conspicuously placed advertising. Earlier this year, the society
stripped This Old House, published by Time Warner's Time Publishing
Ventures Inc., of its nominations for two National Magazine Awards
because an editorial insert featured an advertiser's logo.
</P>
<P>
   Ambiase said the wrap was produced in error.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a test of something that advertisers are really asking
for these days,'' he said. ``The final product should not have
appeared that way.'' Ambiase said that somewhere in the last stage
of production the disclaimer was omitted. He said that, as a result
of the foul-up, he and Smart Money's editor in chief and president,
Steven Swartz, had instituted a policy barring publication of such
advertising cover wraps.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were trying to test the waters and address the needs of the
advertiser,'' he said. ``However, this was a mistake.''

   Cutting Back on Pundits
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to partly curtail the ever growing crop of pundits
that with each passing year seems to proliferate on cable news
channels like kudzu, MSNBC has signed a deal with National Journal
Group for the coming election year.
</P>
<P>
   National Journal Group publications _ like the political Web
site Hotline, Congress Daily and Congress Daily AM, Greenwire, even
The Almanac of American Politics, along with The National Journal
itself _ will supply MSNBC with statistics and data during the
upcoming political campaign. They will also offer their reporters
as commentators.
</P>
<P>
   Erik Sorenson, MSNBC's general manager, says there is a surplus
of self-styled oracles on cable news and he is tired of it. ``It is
an industry overrun by opinion, to a fault,'' he said. ``One of the
things we want to try to correct in the game of cable news is that
as we swing into the coming political season we want to provide a
lot more fact-based information. And Hotline and National Journal
can do that for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh no! Does this mean the end of Ann Coulter?
</P>
<P>
   ``This does not mean that there won't be a pundit on the air
from time to time on MSNBC during the campaign,'' Sorenson said.
``But we are hoping to have a lot more objective analysis from
people in the field and inside the Beltway.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal have existing
agreements with MSNBC under which they supply reporters to the
network for interviews and commentary.
</P>
<P>
   John Fox Sullivan, publisher of The National Journal and The
Atlantic Monthly, said MSNBC ``is turning to us as a supplier of
news, data and information.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As Bloomberg is to the financial business and economic world,
we're trying to be to the political, government and policy
worlds,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kelly, editor of The National Journal and The Atlantic
Monthly, has been a frequent guest on MSNBC, as have the National
Journal legal columnist Stuart Taylor and the magazine's political
columnist, Charles Cook.
</P>
<P>
   But wait a second. Aren't those guys, um, pundits?
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan said that of the 125 National Journal reporters and
editors, very few could be called pundits.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not really an effort on their part to get Stuart
Taylor on more often,'' he said. ``We're giving them reporters who
are nonideological experts on specific things _ what's going on in
Congress _ or segments off of Hotline. They are not in the pundit
business of saying, `This is what ought to happen.'''

ANALYSTS DIFFER ON FUTURE FOR MICROSOFT STOCK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif. , Texas.) (rk) 
 By   SARA ROBINSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Microsoft has long been, in the words of one analyst, ``an
institutional investor's dream.'' Since the company went public in
March 1986, its stock-market capitalization has soared to $470
billion, making it the most highly valued company in the world.
</P>
<P>
   But given the severity of Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's
findings of fact on Friday, analysts and investors say that the
future of Microsoft's stock suddenly seems clouded by uncertainty
about the company's legal problems.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, there are mixed views on how lasting or short-lived the
impact of its legal vulnerabilities will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly the stock is going to take some heat, especially on
Monday,'' said Richard Sherlund, a Goldman, Sachs analyst, who
suggested that Microsoft's share price could drop by $5 or more
from its Friday closing price of $91.5625 in regular-session Nasdaq
trading. After hours, Microsoft fell more than $4, to $87, but such
trading is volatile and sometimes not a good indicator of where a
stock will open in the next regular session.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be an overhanging cloud,'' Sherlund continued. ``But
I think investors will have a thick skin after an initial negative
reaction. These findings are only a first step, and any legal
ruling by the judge could well be overturned on appeal. After
considering the matter, I think most investors will realize that.''
</P>
<P>
   David Readerman, an equity researcher at Thomas Weisel Partners
in San Francisco, said, ``I think the stock is going to be under
pressure for some period of time. I think the stock will trade more
in line with legal procedures than the underlying fundamentals of
the company. I'm still maintaining a buy recommendation of the
stock, but I think the gravity of what's at stake here will
override underlying fundamentals.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts and money managers pointed to Microsoft's many
positives: The company has consistently posted strong earnings and
has substantial deferred revenue, and even after a long string of
strategic acquisitions, it has a huge war chest in the form of cash
reserves, which could be used for further acquisitions or to buy
back its own stock.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, since Microsoft is likely to appeal any negative
verdict, it could be years before the rulings have any impact on
the company.
</P>
<P>
   But Henry T.C. Hu, a University of Texas professor who
specializes in law and finance, said that Microsoft might have a
strong incentive to settle with the Justice Department, given the
severity of the findings. ``The opinion is so pro-government that
it's not clear to me that Microsoft would be unwilling to settle
even with unfavorable terms,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another incentive for Microsoft to settle would be to avoid a
verdict declaring the company a monopoly. Since proving that a
company is a monopoly is often the biggest hurdle in civil
antitrust suits, such a verdict could lead to a barrage of suits by
companies that would otherwise consider litigation too expensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing that would scare Microsoft investors is if they
got buried in a lot of civil litigation,'' said Roger McNamee, a
general partner in Integral Capital Partners, a family of
partnerships that invest in expansion-stage private and
growth-stage public companies.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Gordon, president of the John Hancock Global Technology
Fund, which counts Microsoft among it's top 10 holdings, said that
while the finding of fact would be a blow to technology stocks in
the short term, in the long term they would continue to go up. But
he added that Microsoft might no longer outperform the market,
until there is a decision or settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft will continue to edge up, but will not perform as
well as technology stocks in general because of the uncertainty,''
he predicted.
</P>
<P>
   And uncertainty may be the key question for institutional
investors. Since any eventual remedies dictated by the courts could
have a broad impact on Microsoft's business, such investors may shy
away from taking a large position in Microsoft shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where there's uncertainty,'' Readerman said, ``there's
volatility in the stock, and where there's uncertainty, there is
generally an unwillingness for investors to make large capital
commitments. Watch the trading volume. This will be the voting
machine that tells you which way Microsoft is going to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Hu said that this ruling, together with the statement by
Microsoft's president, Steven Ballmer, in September that the stock
was overvalued, indicate that now is not the time to hold Microsoft
stock. ``For long-term investments I would not buy Microsoft,'' Hu
said. ``I have no good way of quantifying how bad it could be. It
makes it a crapshoot.''
</P>
<P>
   But McNamee, whose company has no position in Microsoft stock at
this time, disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``A large number of institutional investors are hoping the stock
will break down on Monday because they want to buy it,'' he said.
``The opinion of the Department of Justice is important, but I'm
not sure how influential it is on Wall Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the uncertainty over the court's final disposition of
the case, a couple of the most extreme antitrust precedents,
involving the forced breakup of companies, suggest that over the
long term those who held stock in such divested companies tended to
do well. The results have varied, but as far back as the breakup of
Standard Oil in 1911 and as recently as the breakup of American
Telephone &AMP; Telegraph Corp. into AT&AMP;T and the Baby Bells in the
mid-1980s, the investors have profited handsomely.

 By RICHARD FORD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometime in the middle of June I sat down to a ritual that, as
much as any other, has typified my writing life: At the end of a
very lengthy period during which I did basically nothing whatsoever
of any good to man nor beast, I got back to work. That is, I
started writing again.
</P>
<P>
   I don't mean to make this event seem momentous. There was no
drum roll. The soundtrack was not the theme from ``Rocky.'' There
 &UR; was  &LR; no soundtrack, just the quiet, scarcely noticeable shiftings
in a man's daily protocols from one set of digital, inward habits
to another.
</P>
<P>
   No more solitary morning TV, no more taking my breakfast out, no
more reflexive telephone communiques; instead, just the usual soup
of things that continually wash through my brain suddenly beginning
to need sorting out for use in a story. It was a bit like Army
recruits who instantly become soldiers just by standing in a line
wearing their street clothes. And as with the recruits, my
re-enlistment to writing was accompanied by an unwelcome feeling of
purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Stopping and then starting up again is of course what all
writers do. It's what any of us does: Finish this, pause, turn to
that. Over time this repetition is one of those markers that cause
us to say we are this, not that: EMS attendant, lawyer, car thief,
cellist: novelist.
</P>
<P>
   More than for most of my writer colleagues, this ritual _ cease
in order to resume _ has always seemed to me to be an aesthetic,
possibly even a moral postulate. Many of my acquaintances, however,
simply can't wait to get on with writing, as if nature also abhors
a motionless pencil.
</P>
<P>
   One friend (until I barked at him) regularly called me at about
cocktail hour simply to say, ``Did you write today?'' Others seem
to eye the horizon line anxiously from the deep interior of
whatever they're doing at the moment, trying, I suppose, to catch a
flickering glimpse of what they might plunge into next. To them the
stop preceding the start, the  &UR; interval,  &LR; is at best a needless
blink in a life devoted to constant gazing. At worst, it provokes a
worry, even a fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not writing,'' a close friend in Montana told me recently.
``It's so depressing. I just wander around the house without
knowing what to do. The world seems so drab.''
</P>
<P>
   I advised: ``Try turning on the TV. That always works for me. I
forget all about writing the second `Sports Center' comes on.''
</P>
<P>
   And I mean it. In these 30 years I have made a strict point to
take lavish periods away from writing, so much time that my writing
life sometimes seems to involve not writing more than writing, a
fact I warmly approve of.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, over this time I've only written seven books, and
about these seven there has yet arisen no unanimous critical
huzzah. And undoubtedly some smarty-pants will argue that if I'd
only written more, been more obsessed, driven myself harder, ground
my molars lower and paused less, I'd be a better writer than I am.
</P>
<P>
   But I never imagined I was in this business to break the
writers' land speed record, or to put up big numbers (except, I've
hoped, big numbers of readers). In any case, if I had written more
and stopped less, not only would I have driven myself completely
crazy, but almost certainly I would have proved even less good at
writing stories than I am. Anyway, it's my business what I do.
There are finally some things about ourselves that we know best.
</P>
<P>
   Most writers write too much. Some writers write way too much,
gauged by the quality of their accumulated oeuvre. I've never
thought of myself as a man  &UR; driven  &LR; to write. I simply choose to do
it, often when I can't be persuaded to do anything else; or when a
dank feeling of uselessness comes over me, and I'm at a loss and
have some time on my hands, such as when the World Series is over.
</P>
<P>
   I would argue that only in this state of galvanic repose am I
prepared to address the big subjects great literature requires: the
affinities between bliss and bale, etc. Call it my version of
inspiration, although it's entirely possible that my reliance on
this protocol still causes even me to write too much. It's hard to
write just enough.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, many writers write for reasons other than a desire to
produce great literature for others' benefit. They write for
therapy. They write (queasily) to ``express'' themselves. They
write to give organization to, or to escape from, their long, long
days. They write for money, or because they  &UR; are  &LR; obsessive. They
write as a shout for help, or as an act of familial revenge. La,
la, la. There are a lot of reasons to write a lot. Sometimes it
works out OK.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe my seemingly lax attitude comes from having had
working-class parents who slaved so that I could have a better life
than they did _ wouldn't have to work as hard _ and my life is just
a tribute to their success. But whatever the reason _ piddling
around doing something else, like driving from New Jersey to
Memphis and then to Maine just to buy a used car, which I did last
month _ life comes well before writing to me; whereas writing, at
least doing an awful lot of it, feels too much like hard work. I
know my mother and father would give me their full support in this.
</P>
<P>
   Not, I hasten to say, that writing is ever all  &UR; that  &LR; hard.
Beware of writers who tell you how hard they work. (Beware of
anybody who tries to tell you that.) Writing is indeed often dark
and lonely, but no one really has to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, writing can be complicated, exhausting, isolating,
abstracting, boring, dulling, briefly exhilarating; it can be made
to be grueling and demoralizing. And occasionally it can produce
rewards. But it's never as hard as, say, piloting an L-1011 into
O'Hare on a snowy night in January, or doing brain surgery when you
have to stand up for 10 hours straight, and once you start you
can't just stop. If you're a writer, you  &UR; can  &LR; stop anywhere, any
time, and no one will care or ever know. Plus, the results might be
better if you do.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For me the benefits of taking time off between big writing
projects _ novels, let's say _ seem both manifest and manifold. For
one thing, you get to put lived life first. V.S. Pritchett once
wrote that a writer is a person observing life from across a
frontier. Art after all (even writing) is always subordinate to
life, always following it along. And life _ that multifarious,
multidimensional, collisional freight train of thoughts and
sensations you experience away from your desk, when you walk down
56th Street or drive to Memphis _ can be quite bracing (if you can
just stand it) as well as useful for filling up the ``well of
unconscious cerebration'' that Henry James thought contributed to
the writer's ability actually to  &UR; connect  &LR; bliss and bale.
</P>
<P>
   Time frittered away can also just seem like a nice reward for
the grueling work you finished. Sometimes it's the only reward you
get.
</P>
<P>
   Most writers' work habits date from the days when they were
beginners, and at some base level one's habits always involve a
system of naive appraisal. You proceed in ways that let you figure
out if what you're doing is acceptable to yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Stopping and starting during any one day's writing invites you
to judge what you just wrote. And enjoying a long interval between
weighty endeavors invites such useful reassessments as: Do I have
anything important left to add to the store of available reality?
(Kurt Vonnegut decided he didn't.) Do I still wish to do this kind
of work? Was the last thing I wrote really worth a hill of beans?
Is there not something better I could be doing to make a
significant mark on civilization's slate? Does anybody read what I
write?
</P>
<P>
   I mean, aren't such inquiries always interesting as well as
being merely fearsome? Isn't there a measure of coldly cleansing
exhilaration involved in appraising one's personal imperatives as
though they were moral matters? Isn't that, as much as anything,
why we became writers in the first place?
</P>
<P>
   My view of the writers I admire is not that they are sturdy
professionals equipped with a specific set of skills and how-tos,
clear steps for career advancement and a saving ethical code; but
rather that they are gamblers who practice a sort of fervidly
demanding amateurism, whereby one completed, headlong endeavor
doesn't teach the next one very much. And in the case of writing
novels, one endeavor consumes almost entirely its own resources and
generally leaves its author emptied, dazed and bewildered with a
ringing in his ears.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore a good spendthrift interval lasting a couple of
seasons if not more, or at least until you can no longer stand to
read the headlines of the newspaper, much less the articles that
follow, can help to freshen the self, to reconfigure the new, while
decommissioning worn-out preoccupations, habits, old stylistic tics
_ in essence help to ``forget'' everything in order that you
``invent'' something better. And by doing all this, we pay
reverence to art's sacred incentive _ that the whole self, the
complete will, be engaged.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, what  &UR; seems  &LR; hard about writing may not be what you
think. For me what are testing are the requirements of writing that
make a sustained and repeated acquaintance with the world an
absolute necessity; that is, that I be convinced that nothing in
the world outside the book is as interesting as what I'm doing
inside the book that day. What's most demanding is to believe in my
own contrivances and to think that unknown others with time on
their hands will also be persuaded. To do that, it helps a lot to
know what bright allures lie just outside your room and beyond the
pale of your illusion.

<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ In his 45 years as an agent and manager, stretching
from the era of Catskill comedy to ``Saturday Night Live,'' Bernie
Brillstein has never been accused of mincing words.
</P>
<P>
   His newly published autobiography will do nothing to challenge
his image. The book, in its second printing, is titled ``Where Did
I Go Right?'' It is subtitled ``You're No One in Hollywood Unless
Someone Wants You Dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Included are vintage Brillstein observations on Michael Ovitz
(``He should have spent less time acting like a gangster and more
time watching gangster films''), Garry Shandling (``gives me the
creeps''), the highly respected mogul Steven J. Ross (``Steve Ross
had lied to me'') and his former client Richard Dreyfuss (``Now
when I see Richard it's like seeing an old girlfriend _ I bear no
grudge, I say hello, but inside I wonder `How did I ever sleep with
her?''').
</P>
<P>
   Brillstein, 68, first as a talent agent and now as a manager,
helped oversee the careers of John Belushi, Gilda Radner, Jim
Henson, Dan Aykroyd, Lorne Michaels, Martin Short and numerous
others.
</P>
<P>
   One of the charms of the book, published by Little, Brown &AMP; Co.
and written with David Rensin, is that it is almost as frank about
Brillstein's personal life as it is about several men (alive and
dead) whom he loathes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really not a gossip book, a tales-out-of-school book,
and I'm not going to tell bad stories about people I loved like Jim
Henson or friends like Lorne Michaels,'' insisted Brillstein. ``But
then there are some people ...''
</P>
<P>
   Brillstein, who looks and sounds like a raucous Santa Claus, is,
in many ways, a throwback to a show-business world that no longer
exists. In contrast to today's managers and talent agents, who
attended business school and law school, and who work out each
morning, keep slim, wear Prada and are often as cold as ice,
Brillstein is, by his own admission, a bit out of control.
</P>
<P>
   He has been married four times and has five children. He was
trained in the 1950s at the Copacabana and Toots Shor schools of
show business with their focus on drinking, gambling and carousing.
</P>
<P>
   Shrewdly, he glided from representing Borscht Belt comedians _
his icons were stars like Shecky Greene and Buddy Hackett _ to the
wave of hip comics from troupes like Second City and the
Groundlings.
</P>
<P>
   As he walked around his big Wilshire Boulevard office recently,
his eyes welled with tears as he spoke about two of the newer crop,
Ms. Radner and Belushi.
</P>
<P>
   There were no tears about others he has worked with. ``The
betrayals could have killed me, but they didn't,'' said Brillstein,
whose partner, Brad Grey, now runs the Brillstein-Grey
Entertainment agency, perhaps the top management company in town.
``I've survived. I must be tougher than I think. Or I believed in
myself more. Or I was luckier. Take any of the three.''
</P>
<P>
   Brillstein said he wrote the book after Roddy McDowall, the
actor and photographer, said innocently to him at a dinner party
four years ago, ``Tell me about what you do.''
</P>
<P>
   For two hours Brillstein told the silent McDowall about growing
up at the El Dorado in New York, where his family lived with a
wealthy uncle, the comedian Jack Pearl, who lampooned the Baron
Munchausen character on radio.
</P>
<P>
   He told McDowall about being taken to Broadway clubs by his
uncle and then, after the Army, getting an entry-level job in the
mail room of the William Morris agency in 1956. (``I took Elvis to
his first stage show _ it was Saturday night and nobody else wanted
to work.'')
</P>
<P>
   Brillstein later became a talent manager, was hired by the
then-unknown Henson, creator of the Muppets, to represent him, and
began handling many of the comedians on ``Saturday Night Live.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1986 he had moved into the executive ranks in a top job at
Lorimar Film Entertainment (which was later absorbed by Warner
Communications). Two years later he helped create Brillstein-Grey,
whose clients now include Adam Sandler, Brad Pitt, Nicolas Cage and
Short.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago Brillstein sold his shares of the company to
Grey, partly because he felt it was time to yield to the younger
man, partly to settle the financial end of a divorce. Brillstein
said that ``the reality of no longer being king hit me all at once,
and my world came crashing down.''
</P>
<P>
   But Brillstein and Grey, who is 27 years younger, remain like
father and son, and the older manager retains a big office, a
lucrative employment contract and a role as consultant to the
management company.
</P>
<P>
   Brillstein recalled that McDowall, after listening to the
unexpurgated version of the manager's life, told him, ``Bernie, it
would be a shame if you don't write a book and talk about those
five decades of show business.'' Brillstein replied, ``OK, I'm
going to do it.'' (McDowall, who died of cancer last year, was to
have taken photos for the book.)
</P>
<P>
   If there is any criticism heard in Hollywood of the book _ and
its author _ it is that Brillstein may have skewed history a bit in
terms of his accomplishments, especially in the details of the
creation of ``Saturday Night Live.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Brillstein's track record for the one time he ran a
movie company was not especially noteworthy and quashed his
prospects of joining the longstanding ranks of Hollywood royalty,
the handful of people who have the power to green-light a film.
</P>
<P>
   Characteristically, Brillstein candidly summarized his less than
two years at Lorimar in the late 1980s. ``I put about 20 films in
development at Lorimar and ended up making six lousy movies, two
good movies and one great movie,'' he wrote. The great movie, he
said, was ``Dangerous Liaisons,'' directed by Stephen Frears, which
won three Academy Awards. (Brillstein credits one of the film's
stars, Glenn Close, with creating the final scene.)
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the most emotional portions of the book are
Brillstein's comments on the death of Belushi in 1982 from an
overdose of heroin and cocaine. Another client, Chris Farley, died
in December 1997 from an overdose of cocaine and morphine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris was destined to die at 33 like John did,'' Brillstein
said. ``They couldn't control their vices. They thought they were
indestructible. And they were excessive people _ excessive eaters,
excessive drinkers, excessive. They were so similar. Belushi kept
saying, `I have the heart of a high school senior.' And I said:
`John, you're nearly getting uninsurable in the movies. Let's talk
about professional help.'''
</P>
<P>
   Brillstein said he objected to the Bob Woodward book ``Wired,''
which, using diaries, accountants' records, phone bills,
interviews, and travel and medical documents, showed how Hollywood
executives and friends turned a blind eye to Belushi's drug
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Brillstein said the comedian's life had spun out of control and
it was impossible to help him. ``No one was feeding him drugs,''
Brillstein said. ``But people wanted him to work, because he made
them money. So obviously they were turning their backs when it was
convenient. But John would have done the same thing anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   On a professional level, Brillstein said the fact that Ms.
Radner never turned into a movie star was especially disappointing.
``She was really a television being, but her movie career was not
great, and that was a real disappointment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brillstein said that he still missed Ms. Radner. ``There's a
hole, an emptiness,'' he added. ``Everyone thinks, with clients
like these, that you're sitting there counting the money. Well,
Gilda never made a lot of money. She did fine, but she never made a
lot. And you loved her. She'd stay at the Beverly Hills Hotel and
walk across the street in her bathrobe to my house on Crescent
Drive to do her laundry. We gave her a party and she was the first
one there and the last one to leave. She was great. She was
Gilda.''
</P>
<P>
   At the opposite end of the spectrum, Brillstein was one of the
few executives (with David Geffen) to publicly attack Ovitz, the
talent manager and former agent. The book continues the drumbeat,
calling Ovitz a scorpion. (In the mid-1980s the business
relationship between both men was lucrative.)
</P>
<P>
   Among other issues, Brillstein said that, as a manager, he had
placed numerous top comedy clients with Ovitz and his former
agency, Creative Artists. But Ovitz never returned the favor. ``He
was good at the give-and-take only as long as you gave and he
took,'' Brillstein wrote.
</P>
<P>
   After some disagreements, Brillstein wrote that Ovitz threatened
him by saying ``I'll kill you,'' and went so far as to publicly
humiliate his daughter, Leigh Brillstein, a former agent at
Creative Artists. Ms. Brillstein quit to join International
Creative Management. ``I'll never forgive him,'' Brillstein said.
``Ovitz involved my daughter in our fight. I'll never forgive
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz said over the phone that he had not read the book and
would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   Brillstein is only a bit less caustic toward others, including
Dreyfuss. Brillstein said that at a low point in Dreyfuss' career
he helped revive it with a series of comedies at the Walt Disney
studios. Then Dreyfuss fired him. As recounted in the book, the
actor said: ``I get these scripts myself now. I really don't need a
manager anymore. It's a lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Brillstein wrote: ``Of all the people who have left me, Dreyfuss
surprised me the most. I'd just really been there for him. I
thought we were friends.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Dreyfuss said the actor was unavailable for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Brillstein's biography, like him, is ribald and funny. He
recalled that in his early days as an agent at William Morris, a
fellow agent came to see him to say that Molly Picon was leaving
the Broadway musical ``Milk and Honey,'' and that they should come
up with a replacement. The only other Yiddish-speaking actress
Brillstein said he knew was Jenny Goldstein.
</P>
<P>
   The show's producers said they would give her $500 a week.
Brillstein responded that Ms. Goldstein was a star and deserved
$750 a week. The producers agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we called Jenny Goldstein with the great news and
discovered she'd been dead for four years,'' he said. ``Now that's
classic agenting. We got a dead person a $250-a-week raise. I knew
I was in the right business.''

   ``MY GARDEN (BOOK)''  &QL; 
By Jamaica Kincaid (FSG, $23) &QL; 
Jamaica Kincaid has written books full of her difficult feelings
for her mother and her brother, but boy, does she love her garden.
She is agitated and vexed when she's in it, but she's happy:
``Nothing works just the way I thought it would, nothing looks just
the way I had imagined it, and when sometimes it does look like
what I had imagined (and this, thank God, is rare) I am startled
that my imagination is so ordinary.'' This book is dense with
growing things, overrun with blooms, fertile with every plant
you've ever heard of and then some. Fellow gardening author Michael
Pollan says Kincaid's voice is that of ``an exquisitely attentive
gardener thinking out loud.'' We'd note that ``exquisitely
attentive'' is a kind way of saying ``obsessed,'' but then it's all
New &AMP; Notable can do to water the tomatoes. Kincaid celebrates seed
and plant catalogs, discusses the link between gardeners and
conquerors, and notes that ``everyone I have ever met who has a
garden has something growing in it from seeds that were gathered in
Monet's garden.'' That means she cultivates exotic friends, too. &QL; 
``THE BOOK BORROWER'' &QL; 
By Alice Mattison (Morrow, $24) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This odd and meandering novel begins with the meeting of two
young mothers at a park in 1975. Deborah Laidlaw is there with her
daughters, Toby Ruben with her baby son, and in the course of their
conversation Toby borrows a book that Deborah has been carrying
around but has not found time to read. Two things begin in this
scene: a lifelong friendship between Toby and Deborah, and our
interest in the fate of that borrowed book, ``Trolley Girl,'' the
story of a tragedy that occurred during a strike among trolley
workers in 1921. For much of her novel, Mattison alternates the
interplay between Toby, Deborah and their families with sections
narrated by the author of ``Trolley Girl.'' We're not sure why she
does this but we're grateful for it, because ``Trolley Girl''
proceeds with a sense of purpose and anticipation. The ground is
not so firm under Toby and Deborah, whose friendship unfolds in
rambling conversations and unseen resolutions. One chapter ends
with a terrible conflict between the two friends when Toby almost
gets Deborah fired from her teaching job. To our surprise, the next
chapter begins years later, with their friendship obviously
restored, although Mattison does not say how. This is exasperating,
but ``The Book Borrower'' is not without saving graces. One is Toby
Ruben, an authentic character who slips into mean-spiritedness when
she feels threatened. Another is Mattison's portrayal of the give
and take between friends, between men and women, between parents
and children _ that messy navigation of emotional ties. In the end,
her novel is less notable for its story than for these small
moments that ring true. &QL; 
``IF THIS HOUSE COULD TALK'' &QL; 
By Elizabeth Smith Brownstein (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $35) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I have found that it is the visible, the tangible, that goes a
long way in softening prejudices,'' Booker T. Washington wrote in
``Up From Slavery.'' ``The actual sight of a first-class house that
a Negro has built is 10 times more potent than pages of discussion
about a house that he ought to build, or perhaps could build.'' And
so, against the wishes of some of his benefactors, Washington built
``The Oaks,'' a red brick house with parlor, library, dining room,
kitchen, family and guest bedrooms, den, breakfast room, five
bathrooms and a veranda on three acres of land overlooking the
campus of Alabama's Tuskegee Institute. Among the other buildings
included in this look at historic homes and the people who lived in
them are the stunning ``symphony in wood'' built in 1908 (for a
mere $55,000) for Proctor &AMP; Gamble heir David Gamble in Pasadena,
Calif.; the New Hampshire farm of poet Robert Frost; Lorenzo
Hubbell's house and trading post in Ganado; the Massachusetts
homestead of Rebecca Nurse, who was hanged during the Salem witch
trials; the Bronx, N.Y., cottage of Edgar Allan Poe; and Frank
Lloyd Wright's Storer House and Auldbrass Plantation. Our favorite
is illustrator Edward Gorey's Cape Cod cottage, where books are
piled precariously high on every horizontal surface in sight. This
engaging blend of history, architecture and interior design
contains what its author calls ``stories of great passion, courage
and brilliance . . . and enough cruelty, greed and ignorance to go
around.'' &QL; 
``THE COST OF LIVING'' &QL; 
By Arundhati Roy (Modern Library, $11.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Roy follows her Booker Prize-winning first novel, ``The God of
Small Things,'' with two essays, one on dam projects that have
scarred her native India and the other on India's detonation last
year of a nuclear bomb. The first, called ``The Greater Common
Good,'' is more demanding reading, but both benefit from Roy's very
personal and appealingly abrasive style. In the second essay, ``The
End of Imagination,'' she touches on the success of her novel.
``The more I thought about it,'' she writes, ``the clearer it
became to me that if fame was going to be my permanent condition it
would kill me. Club me to death with its good manners and hygiene.
I'll admit that I've enjoyed my own five minutes of it immensely
but primarilyBECAUSE (editor: ITAL) it was just five minutes.
Because I knew (or thought I knew) that I could go home when I was
bored and giggle about it. Grow old and irresponsible. Eat mangoes
in the moonlight. Maybe write a couple of failed books _
worstsellers _ to see what it felt like.'' Instead, she has written
this, a thought-provoking challenge from a citizen of India and of
the world. &QL;

POPE MAKES CASE FOR CHRISTIAN CONVERSIONS
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ Summoning all his moral authority, Pope John
Paul II tried Sunday to persuade leaders of other religions here
that interfaith understanding should lead them to recognize the
Roman Catholic Church's right to evangelize.
</P>
<P>
   ``Religious freedom constitutes the very heart of human
rights,'' the pope, on a three-day visit to India, said at a
gathering that included Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs and Jews and
representatives of several other faiths. ``Its inviolability is
such that individuals must be recognized as having the right even
to change their religion, if their conscience so demands.''
</P>
<P>
   But that is an argument that many religious leaders in India
accept only with difficulty. Christian conversions are at the heart
of a political and religious dispute that has made the pope's visit
a tense one. Christian proselytizing is a fuel for Muslim
fundamentalists, but it is also a source of uneasiness between the
pope and some of his more moderate and like-minded religious peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conversions are a fundamental right,'' Samdhong Rinpoche, a
Buddhist monk who is the speaker of the Tibetan Parliament in
exile, said after leaving the podium he shared with the pope. ``But
what we fear is that between indoctrination and anybody's
inner-consciousness to choose his religion _ there is a clean line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any kind of action to encourage, or to persuade or to motivate
in favor of any particular religion, that is a form of conversion
that we as Buddhists cannot recommend,'' the monk said.
</P>
<P>
   All the religious leaders who met with the leader of the Roman
Catholic Church in a lecture room in the Palace of Science here
praised the pope's efforts to promote mutual respect and joint
responsibility for addressing social ills. Shri Ezekiel Isaac
Malekar, a New Delhi rabbi, draped a Jewish prayer shawl around the
pope.
</P>
<P>
   To fervent applause, Shankaracharya Madhavananda Saraswati, a
moderate Hindu leader who has criticized fundamentalist protests
over the visit, clasped the pope's hand and held it high in the
air, like tennis partners celebrating a Wimbledon doubles victory.
Afterward, however, the Hindu leader expressed private misgivings
about Christian evangelization.
</P>
<P>
   He said later that Hindus could not really ever be diverted from
their original faith: ``Religion comes from the heart. Something
may change outwardly, but what is inside remains with the human
being forever. That does not change.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope, 79, who came to India to close a synod of Asian
bishops, has declared the evangelization of Asia, where Catholics
remain a tiny minority, to be one of the church's top priorities
for the next millennium. He said it was a ``mystery'' why Christ is
largely unknown on the continent and added, ``The peoples of Asia
need Jesus Christ and his Gospel.''
</P>
<P>
   In India, however, Hindu fundamentalists accuse Christian
missionaries, who are most active in poor rural and tribal areas,
of preying on the most susceptible _ buying their souls with
education, medical aid and economic assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-Christian attacks by Hindu fundamentalists, often
encouraged by political extremists, have escalated over two years,
with more than 150 recorded incidents of church lootings, beatings,
rapes and killings. In Orissa, the state that was recently
devastated by a cyclone, a missionary and his two young children
were killed last January.
</P>
<P>
   The pope came to India with two agendas: He preached ardently
for religious tolerance for all faiths, but also instructed his own
to convert new followers. To even the mildest leaders of other
religions, the two messages do not easily blend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Religious people are more busy with increasing the number of
their followers rather than paying attention to the challenges that
beset religion,'' said Acharya Mahapragya, head of the Jains, a
group of Hindus who revere all forms of life and veil their speech
to prevent their breath from destroying living microorganisms.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking through a lavender-colored surgical mask, he was the
only leader, besides the pope, to address the issue of conversions
publicly.
</P>
<P>
   In the current climate, some Indian Catholics say, their
simplest acts of charity are misunderstood. ``We help people with
scholarships and medical aid,'' said Batholomew Abraham, 40, a
businessman who traveled almost 1,500 miles by train to see the
pope.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were really bribing converts, after 2,000 years we
wouldn't still only be 2 percent of the population.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The pope wants church leaders to adapt their pastoral style to
suit the culture and customs of their native lands, and he showed
the way Sunday by presiding over a colorful sitar Mass for 40,000
worshippers in Nehru Stadium. The Mass coincided with the most
important Hindu celebration of the year, Diwali, the festival of
light, which was noisily celebrated all over New Delhi with
fireworks. At the Mass, under a huge abstract poster of Mother
Theresa of Calcutta, women in brown and gold saris danced before
the altar while a choir of sitar-players performed Indian-style
hymns.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing disturbances during the pope's visit, the government
tightened security throughout the city, bringing in 3,500 armed
paratroopers to assist the city's 55,000 police officers. Protests
near papal venues were banned, and would-be demonstrators swiftly
arrested. But there were odd lapses. Before the pope arrived, his
bulletproof popemobile was parked, unguarded, at an entrance to the
stadium, as people streamed past.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul, who has Parkinson's disease and other ailments,
looked weak and physically spent on much of the trip. Usually, the
Vatican is tight-lipped about the pope's condition. But a pamphlet
about his visit prepared by the archdiocese of New Delhi described
with unusual candor some of the precautions taken to accommodate
the pope's ``poor health.''
</P>
<P>
   The guidebook proudly described the ``elevator platform'' built
behind the altar ``as he is unable to walk well or climb too many
steps.'' It described the chemical toilet installed for his use
during the 3-hour Mass, as well as special papal thrones to enable
him ``to restrict the trembling of his arm.'' It also explained
that the seat was specially designed to allow the pope to rise
without assistance.

WEB AUDIO NETWORK PLANS NEW DELIVERY SYSTEM TODAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Wash.) (ms) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RealNetworks Inc., the multimedia Internet company, plans Monday
to announce a new network delivery service and a new version of its
media player, called RealPlayer 7.
</P>
<P>
   The new service will include a daily program listing called Take
5, which will inform Internet surfers about multimedia offerings
around the Internet. It will also include a message service to
alert users of the company's RealPlayer software of late-breaking
multimedia events during the day.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Glaser, founder and chief executive of RealNetworks, said
the company had already distributed 85 million copies of its
RealPlayer software for PCs, which is used for playing multimedia
programming transmitted over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   RealNetworks executives said that besides the daily Take 5, the
new network service would include a more comprehensive roundup of
multimedia programming on the Web to be called the Real.com Guide,
which would serve as a reference and search directory for Internet
audio and video programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've integrated a network of services,'' Glaser said.
</P>
<P>
   The company will have more than 100 broadcast and Internet media
partners for the service, he said, and the guide will list
multimedia programming from networks such as ABC, BBC, CBS, Fox and
NBC, as well as Internet-only media companies.
</P>
<P>
   The new RealNetworks service is certain to intensify the Seattle
company's competition with Microsoft, which has recently begun to
work more closely with the recording industry to attempt to set
technical standards for managing digital rights. Microsoft has also
cut deals with Creative Labs and Cirrus Logic to build support for
its audio standard into portable music players.
</P>
<P>
   Another question that RealNetworks must now face is that it is
moving toward competing directly America Online, Yahoo and
Broadcast.com. This shift could push some of the largest Internet
portal companies away from the RealPlayer standard.
</P>
<P>
   RealNetworks is also trying to address user-privacy concerns
expressed last week after new reports that the company's
RealJukebox software, which can record and play compact disks as
well as download digital music from the Internet, continually
reports personal information about its users to RealNetworks.
</P>
<P>
   After that disclosure, the company released a software patch on
its Web site to prevent the RealJukebox program from relaying
personal information about users to the company or to any third
party. Executives said they would begin a review of the company's
privacy practices.

WHEN NEWSPAPERS SEEK REVENUE WITH NOVEL `EXPERIMENTS'
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN.: Minn., Calif., Texas, Ariz.)   (jw) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Jane E. Kirtley moved into her new home in Minneapolis in
September, she found on her doorstep a free weekly supplement to
The Minneapolis Star Tribune. Called The Buyer's Edge, it contained
consumer-friendly articles about things like buying a car online
and ads for things like car dealerships.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kirtley, the new Silha professor of Media, Ethics and Law at
the University of Minnesota's School of Journalism, was curious
about the supplement's origins. As a consumer, she found it useful.
As a longtime student of the news business, she wondered who was
doing the writing _ reporters or ad copywriters?
</P>
<P>
   According to John Schueler, Star-Tribune publisher, the
editorial material in ``The Buyer's Edge'' is completely
independent. That is, it is written and edited by journalists. All
the revenue goes to The Star-Tribune, which is owned by the
McClatchy Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say it's bad,'' Ms. Kirtley said.``I just moved here,
and I don't know where to get a snowblower.''
</P>
<P>
   But she hesitated as she spoke. Her ambivalence reflects the
suspicions papers can encounter as they create new products, make
alliances with other institutions in their communities or look for
new revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper publishers have long tried experiments to increase
revenue, just as they have long made financial investments in their
communities. But the pressures are greater these days. The
financial underpinnings of the newspaper business are shifting, and
its audience is slowly dwindling.
</P>
<P>
   But every experiment entails a risk. Readers may suspect that
the new sections they are reading are written for advertisers, not
for them.
</P>
<P>
   The embarrassment suffered by The Los Angeles Times underscores
the risk. Its newsroom erupted when employees heard that as part of
the newspaper's sponsorship of the new Staples sports center, the
local arena would share the profits from a recent Sunday magazine
issue devoted to it.
</P>
<P>
   Though the rebellion at Times Mirror's flagship newspaper may
make publishers more careful, newspapers are not going to stop the
experiments.
</P>
<P>
   Such efforts have gone on for years. In 1995, The Boston Globe
produced a special section as a guide to the newly opened Fleet
Center arena. As in Los Angeles, the articles were written and
edited solely by the news staff; as in Los Angeles, part of the
revenue from the ads went to the subject of the coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We treated them as a sales agent and paid them a commission
for ads that they sold,'' said Richard Gulla, a spokesman for The
Globe, which has been owned by The New York Times Co. since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, the Globe's arrangement was not part of a deal to
help sponsor the arena. ``The only thing I can say to you is that
it happened. It happened five years ago,'' he said. ``Will it
happen today? No.''
</P>
<P>
   While it is highly unusual for newspapers to share their own
revenue with subjects of news coverage, they and their parent
companies often have financial arrangements with other local
businesses or civic institutions that they cover. Some arrangements
involve forms of financial partnership. Sometimes, newspapers'
parents make investments in local sports teams or arenas _ the A.H.
Belo Corp., owner of The Dallas Morning News, is paying $24 million
for 12.4 percent of the Dallas Mavericks and 6.2 percent of a new
sports arena partly financed by taxpayers. Phoenix Newspapers, the
parent of The Arizona Republic and a unit of Central Newspapers
Inc., has invested $7 million in the Arizona Diamondbacks of Major
League Baseball's National League.
</P>
<P>
   The most common revenue-generating project is the advertising
supplement, a pullout product produced entirely by the advertising
department, with no journalistic input. The sections, labeled as
advertising, appear regularly in many papers.
</P>
<P>
   John Oppedahl, publisher of The Arizona Republic, is proud of
his newspaper's ``vigorous sports marketing effort,'' producing
advertorial sections to send the messages local sports teams want
to send.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, he said, a special section that the paper's ad
department prepared for the Phoenix Coyotes, a National Hockey
League franchise, was used by the team to advocate its position on
a local ballot measure.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers like The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal
have begun to publish periodic special sections. These sections,
with themes including personal investing, automobiles and health,
draw niche advertising but the editorial content is controlled by
the newspapers' journalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a new entrepreneurial spirit afoot,'' said Jay Smith,
president of the newspapers unit of Cox Enterprises. ``And it is
essential. It is very tough, in an increasingly competitive world,
where you have got lots of folks fighting for ad dollars that would
otherwise easily have come our way.''
</P>
<P>
   He ticked off the usual suspects: local television, radio, cable
channels, direct mail. ``And somewhere out there is the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The vast array of World Wide Web sites may indeed be a growing
threat to newspapers' ad revenues. But the Internet may also hold
its own traps as newspapers move to the Web. For example, with
little or no disclosure, links to advertiser sites could be given
favorable placement.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Rosenstiel, director of the Project for Excellence in
Journalism, said he felt lines would blur further between
independent information prepared by journalists and information
bought and paid for by commercial interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in the credibility business, not in the advertising
business,'' Rosenstiel said. But ``the blending of news and
commercial, unlabeled, is becoming common on the Web. The great
question about the next Internet era of journalism,'' he said, ``is
not whether Matt Drudge will have a thousand citizen reporters but
whether the Internet is going to become a giant infomercial.''

SCOTTISH BANK AND SANTANDER ARE REPORTEDLY IN TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The Royal Bank of Scotland is negotiating with the
Spanish bank Banco Santander Central Hispano about possibly making
a joint bid for National Westminster Bank, executives close to the
talks said Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Bank, which has said it is monitoring the Bank of
Scotland's $34 billion hostile bid for Natwest, has not yet decided
whether it will make a bid, executives stressed.
</P>
<P>
   If the Royal Bank does pursue Natwest with Banco Santander, the
two banks would bid about $42 billion, hoping to trump the Bank of
Scotland's bid, according to executives briefed on the plan. Banco
Santander, which already owns a 10 percent stake in the Royal Bank
of Scotland, would take about a 30 percent stake in Natwest if the
banks move forward with an offer, the executives said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Royal Bank of Scotland declined to comment.
A spokesman for Banco Santander could not be reached for comment
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Banco Santander Central Hispano, which was formed earlier this
year by the merger between Banco Santander and Banco Central
Hispano, would most likely add cash to a possible Royal Bank of
Scotland bid in an effort to offer Natwest shareholders a special
dividend, the executives said.
</P>
<P>
   The talks were reported Sunday in The Sunday Telegraph in
London.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Britain's Takeover Panel ruled that the Royal Bank
of Scotland had to disclose its position in regard to making a bid
for Natwest by Dec. 3.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of Scotland had filed a complaint with the panel, which
acts as an arbitrator of sorts, asking it to make the Royal Bank of
Scotland reveal whether it planned to bid for Natwest after
speculation about an offer by the bank was reported.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, who have desperately awaited another suitor for
Natwest to emerge, have been disappointed. But analysts note that
Natwest is still trading at a premium over the original Bank of
Scotland bid, leading to speculation that a white knight may still
arrive or that the Bank of Scotland will sweeten its offer.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts, though, seemed to think chances were slim that
the Royal Bank of Scotland would make a bid, considering the amount
of time it has had to examine the Bank of Scotland's offer and to
make its own bid. &QL;

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Three makeshift pipe bombs exploded in the Israeli
coastal town of Netanya on Sunday, wounding 14 people, on the day
before the planned start of Israeli-Palestinian negotiations on a
permanent peace.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but Israeli and
Palestinian officials said they believed the attack was carried out
by Islamic militants bent on derailing peace efforts. The officials
asserted that the efforts would continue unabated.
</P>
<P>
   ``This attack is aimed at sabotaging the peace process,
especially now that we are close to beginning final status talks,''
the Palestinian Authority said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The office of Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel said talks
with the Palestinians would proceed as planned on Monday in the
West Bank town of Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
   ``This government is determined not to yield to any kind of
terror,'' Barak said. Vowing to ``smash terrorism,'' he added that
his government ``expects the Palestinian Authority to act
effectively to prevent terrorists from harming the chances of
progress in the peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   The bombs went off at 10:30 a.m. near a bank on Herzl Street,
the main shopping thoroughfare in downtown Netanya. Witnesses said
they heard three loud blasts followed by a burst of flame and thick
smoke as some people were thrown into the air and others fell
wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials said that the three makeshift bombs, packed
with explosives and nails, had been placed in a shopping cart left
near a garbage bin. A fourth pipe bomb that failed to explode was
later dismantled.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital officials reported that 14 people were treated for
wounds. Most were lightly wounded, they said, adding that four were
in fair condition. Another 15 people were treated for shock, Israel
Radio said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was waiting at a crosswalk when suddenly I heard a series of
explosions,'' David Ratzon, who was wounded, said in a radio
interview. ``I was thrown to the middle of the street, lost my way
and ran to the other side. I stood on the sidewalk, full of nails,
my shirt on fire. People laid me on the sidewalk and put the fire
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians in the area were rounded up for questioning, but
later released.
</P>
<P>
   As a police bomb squad and forensic experts combed the blast
site, about 30 protesters gathered nearby. They shouted
``Revenge,'' ``Death to Arabs!'' and ``Barak Go Home.'' Some held
up pictures of the hawkish former prime minister, Benjamin
Netanyahu, whom Barak defeated in elections last May.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing came a day after a leaflet signed by the armed wing
of the militant Islamic group Hamas threatened renewed attacks on
Israelis. However the Israeli police chief, Yehuda Vilk, said that
the makeshift bomb explosions Sunday were not typical of Hamas,
whose suicide bombers have killed scores of Israelis in far bigger
blasts.
</P>
<P>
   Sheik Ahmad Yassin, the spiritual leader of Hamas, sidestepped
questions on whether his group had a role in Sunday's bombing,
saying only that the latest violence was part of a cycle of
bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli-Palestinian talks on a permanent agreement are
expected to begin in earnest on Monday with the declared aim of
reaching a framework accord by February, and a final agreement by
September.
</P>
<P>
   A likely early stumbling block will be the future of Jewish
settlements in the West Bank and Gaza.

   ``Expansion of settlements will be the first point on the agenda
of the final status talks, and without a halt to settlement
activities there will be no progress,'' said Yasser Abed Rabbo, the
chief Palestinian negotiator.
</P>
<P>
   Although Barak has permitted new construction at existing
settlements, he reached an agreement with the settlers' leadership
last month to remove 11 illegal outposts set up, mostly in the past
year, in the West Bank hills.
</P>
<P>
   Under a deadline set by Barak to vacate the remaining outposts
by Wednesday or to face eviction by soldiers, settlers have begun
moving out. At one outpost, however, the settlers are expected
simply to move to a new, authorized trailer site on a hill closer
to an existing settlement. At another, a trailer will be left
behind, pending future approval of building plans by the
government.
</P>
<P>
   The army is preparing for possible resistance at Havat Maon, an
outpost south of Hebron, where scores of militants have gathered to
block any attempt to evacuate the site.

 &HT;    A CYBER-CHALLENGED PRESIDENT TO MAKE 'CHAT ROOM' DEBUT
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS and BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON Information Age politics will cross another frontier
Monday when Bill Clinton enters a virtual chat room on the Internet
for an online presidential town hall meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The inaugural presidential webcast doesn't call for Clinton to
tap away at a computer keyboard as questions pop up on his personal
monitor. While the White House may be all wired up, the first Baby
Boomer chief executive still isn't.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Clinton will mount an auditorium stage at a local
university, along with some other New Democrats, as well as
cyberspace billionaire Marc Andreesson, who at age 23 created the
Netscape Navigator browser.
</P>
<P>
   A lucky handful among the 15,000 Web users who successfully log
on for the 90-minute session, from 7 to 8:30 p.m. EST, at
www.townhallmeeting.excite.com will be able to pose their e-mailed
questions to Clinton. He will then answer them via newly developed
</P>
<P>
   streaming video technology.
</P>
<P>
   Up to another 35,000 users will be able watch passively before
the chat room fills up. Participants in both groups whose computers
lack the needed video or audio software can read a continually
updated transcript.
</P>
<P>
   The unique event is being sponsored by the Democratic Leadership
Council, the ``Third Way'' political group that Clinton helped
found while governor of Arkansas, and Excite at Home, an online
service provider that specializes in fast links to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're prepared to take some tough questions,'' said Elizabeth
Newman, a White House spokesperson.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton has been known to praise the virtues of computer
literacy, White House officials confirm that he has yet to practice
what he preaches by sifting through e-mail messages or surfing the
net in his spare time.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all, this is the president, and he doesn't have a lot of
free time,'' an official said. ``But he understands the uses of the
technology and is certainly interested in its educational and
commercial value.''
</P>
<P>
   A personal computer has yet to find its way into the Oval
Office. Clinton, however, owns a laptop and has been given some
rudimentary lessons on how to run it by Al Gore, the techno-geek
vice president. Still, whenever speech drafts are required, ghost
writers have proven more handy than word processors. Clinton then
edits the printouts by hand.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1997, Clinton joined in an Oval Office demonstration of
computer wizardry for a Saturday morning radio address that
promoted the use of the Internet. But he had Gore at his side for
the whole show and, after a photo op, the gear was quickly whisked
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I become curious, I can always go down to the vice
president's office, because he's a bigger expert than I am, based
on things he pulls up for me on the Internet,'' the president once
told a group of curious fifth-graders at a question-and-answer
session in Clarksburg, W.Va.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, when Chelsea went off to Stanford University,
Clinton suggested that he would finally learn how to use e-mail so
he could stay in touch with her. But he hasn't, finding it easier
to use the phone.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Clinton spent much of election night peering over
the shoulder of John Podesta at his chief of staff's computer
screen as Podesta, to Clinton's apparent amazement, extracted
voting results from Internet sites before political newscasters
could put them on the air.
</P>
<P>
   The White House also maintains its own highly popular Web site
(www.whitehouse.gov), complete with links to the rest of the
government and an invitation to the public to e-mail their comments
to Clinton to Gore. But any responses go back by ``snail mail.''
</P>
<P>
   As the web site explains: ``Shortly after you send this message,
you will receive an electronic acknowledgment of receipt from the
White House. There will be no further electronic response. If
appropriate, a reply will be sent to you via U.S. mail.''

CLINTON PUSHES PAY FOR FAMILY LEAVES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Texas, Conn., Utah, La., Vt.. N.C.)  (jw) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A bitter struggle has erupted over a plan by
President Clinton to allow states to pay unemployment benefits to
workers who take time off to care for newborn infants.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said the change in policy, subsidizing
unpaid leave for new parents, could help millions of people
struggling to balance the demands of work and family.
</P>
<P>
   But employers and many state officials said Clinton was
exceeding his legal authority, circumventing Congress and reversing
six decades of government policy, which has held that people can
get jobless benefits only if they are actively seeking work.
</P>
<P>
   Just two years ago, the Labor Department told states they could
not use the federal unemployment insurance trust fund to pay for
maternity and paternity leave. Now, the administration is preparing
new regulations that would allow the states to do so if they
choose.
</P>
<P>
   Employers said the president's policy would take money meant for
jobless workers and give it to people who had jobs but chose to
leave them temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   Government data suggest that more than 650,000 people a year
take parental leave under a 1993 law, the Family and Medical Leave
Act. But the potential demand is much greater. The Labor Department
says that 1.9 million working women have children less than a year
old.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Cleary, vice president of the National Association of
Manufacturers, said of the president's plan: ``This is the nuttiest
idea we've seen in a long time. The administration is looking for a
pile of cash to fulfill a political promise, and they found it in
the unemployment trust fund. But that's an insurance fund, not a
slush fund. It's for unemployed people. Workers on family leave are
employed, not unemployed. We'll see bad times again some day, and
when we go back to the trust fund, it'll be bust.''
</P>
<P>
   Legislators in several states, including Vermont and
Massachusetts, have introduced bills to provide unemployment
insurance to workers taking family leave. But officials who run the
state programs are generally cool to the idea, fearing that it
would change the focus of unemployment insurance and harm the trust
fund.
</P>
<P>
   James Finch, the unemployment insurance director in Utah, said:
``President Clinton's plan represents a very substantial change in
the bedrock core principles of the unemployment insurance program
as it has been operated for 60 years. The foundation of the program
is that benefits are paid to people who are unemployed through no
fault of their own and who are actively seeking full-time work.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1993 law, people who work for a company with 50 or
more employees are generally entitled to 12 weeks of unpaid leave
to care for newborn children or sick relatives or to tend to
medical problems of their own. Workers who take leave are legally
entitled to return to their jobs or to equivalent positions with
equivalent pay.
</P>
<P>
   Jobless benefits vary from state to state, but average $200 a
week. Under the current system, state officials said, the cost of
any additional benefit payments would be passed on to employers
because they pay the taxes that finance the unemployment insurance
program.
</P>
<P>
   State officials estimate that paid leave for new parents could
increase their unemployment insurance costs by 15 percent to 20
percent, depending on how many people seek benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of paid family leave said the cost would be much
lower. Moreover, they said, paid leave would benefit the national
economy by reducing absenteeism and the need for new parents to go
on welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Republicans in Congress said the president should not
make such a momentous change in policy by unilateral action. And
they have sent letters to the White House urging him to reconsider.
</P>
<P>
   In one such letter, Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, the chairman of
the Ways and Means Committee, and Rep. Nancy Johnson, R-Conn., told
the president, ``Your decision allowing states to use unemployment
compensation to provide paid family leave pits out-of-work
Americans against their neighbors who have jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton signaled his intention to rewrite federal policy in May,
in a commencement address at Grambling State University in
Louisiana, but he gave no details. Now the administration is
preparing to announce the details, many of which have become known
to experts in the field as the Labor Department writes new rules
for the unemployment insurance program.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the rules, White House officials said, Clinton
will present himself as the champion of a popular political cause,
helping hard-pressed families while Congress sits on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is relying on an expansive view of executive authority.
A legal analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service
raises questions about that authority. Under federal law, it says,
money withdrawn from the trust fund must be used ``solely in the
payment of unemployment compensation.'' Conceivably, it says,
states could define ``unemployment compensation'' to include family
leave, but that would conflict with the ``legislative history and
historical interpretation'' of the program.
</P>
<P>
   Business groups said they would challenge the new policy in
court if the president formally adopted it.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The federal unemployment insurance program was created in 1935
as part of the Social Security Act. Under longstanding
interpretations of the law, people are eligible for jobless
benefits only if they are involuntarily unemployed, able to work
and available for work.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department's Web site describes who is eligible: ``You
must be available for work. This means that you are ready to start
a job immediately. It also means you have transportation and do not
have to remain at home to care for children.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of paid family leave like Maurice Emsellem, a lawyer
at the National Employment Law Project, said states could make
exceptions to this requirement. Within the framework of federal
law, those supporters said, states have wide latitude in setting
eligibility standards, benefit levels and tax rates. Moreover, they
said, since the New Deal, states have been allowed and even
encouraged to experiment with unemployment compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., an author of the 1993 family
leave law, said it had been a boon to millions of new parents,
allowing them to bond with their children before returning to work.
But Dodd said that many people who needed family leave did not take
it because they could not afford to go without a paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   Low-wage workers who take unpaid leave often ``wind up on public
assistance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Labor unions and women's groups, led by the National Partnership
for Women and Families, are lobbying state legislators to provide
some type of income, subsidies or tax breaks for workers who take
family leave. The new federal policy clears the way for such state
action.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hobbie of the Interstate Conference of Employment
Security Agencies, a national organization of state labor
officials, said: ``In general, our members have been opposed to the
president's proposal, not because they oppose the concept of paid
family leave, but because they believe it's inappropriate to use
the unemployment insurance system for that purpose. State officials
would argue that workers on family leave ought to be able to get
benefits under some other government program or from employers.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Douse, the unemployment insurance director for Vermont,
said that paying jobless benefits to new parents ``would lead to an
automatic increase in employer taxes'' because benefit payments in
the state would probably increase by 20 percent, or $9 million a
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be sure,'' Douse said, ``we have a strong trust fund right
now, but the whole purpose of the trust fund is that you raise
money in good times so it will be available in bad economic
times.''
</P>
<P>
   Employers said the president's proposal could deplete the trust
fund. But Emsellem, from the National Employment Law Project, said
that with the jobless rate at a 29-year low, many states had
healthy surpluses in their trust fund accounts and could afford to
expand unemployment insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Businesses criticize the president's proposal as a raid on the
trust fund, even as they lobby successfully for cuts in state
unemployment insurance taxes,'' Emsellem said. ``That's
hypocritical.''
</P>
<P>
   George Wentworth, director of program policy at the Connecticut
Labor Department, said Clinton's proposal represented ``a fairly
dramatic departure from the traditional uses of unemployment trust
fund dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   James Dillon, executive deputy commissioner of the New York
state Labor Department, said, ``We have some doubts about the U.S.
Department of Labor's authority to issue regulations'' allowing use
of the trust fund to pay for family leave.
</P>
<P>
   But Thomas Whitaker, deputy chairman of the North Carolina
Employment Security Commission, said he liked Clinton's initiative
because it allowed states to decide for themselves whether to pay
unemployment compensation to workers taking parental leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``If states don't want to do it, they don't have to,'' Whitaker
said. ``I hope the Labor Department takes that approach on other
issues.''  &QL;

   DURHAM, N.C. _ In 30 years of touring, the folk singer Ray Wylie
Hubbard had seen far more professional-looking spaces than the one
he performed at last Wednesday evening. The backstage area was a
small bedroom, where guitars rested against the wall next to a
vacuum cleaner. And what passed for a stage was simply a beige shag
carpet with two folding chairs set up on it.
</P>
<P>
   This was clearly no ordinary club: It was the home of Chris
Elliott and Carolyn Maynard. And for two hours that night, 80 music
fans, most of them strangers who had bought $10 tickets to the
sold-out performance, camped out in the couple's living room and
ate their food.
</P>
<P>
   House concerts, as these events are known, have recently
blossomed into a full-fledged national movement. From Seattle to
Waco, Texas, to Queens, N.Y., more than 300 homeowners have become
part-time concert promoters, turning their homes into mild-mannered
clubs for a night, and scores of performers are discovering that
they can make good livings simply by touring these private
residences.
</P>
<P>
   In a time when live performance outlets in many towns and cities
are drying up because of hostility from police and community
boards, house concerts are becoming the most exciting and vital
alternative performance circuit around, with some shows selling out
in just an hour or two. And they're luring an audience that
professional concert promoters have given up on: music fans in
their 30s and 40s, many of whom shun the impersonal, smoky,
uncomfortable late-night club environment and prefer the familial
intimacy of a living room concert.

   ``Part of the reason for the boom of house concerts right now is
people are so hungry for community but lacking in ways they can get
together with other people in an intimate or friendly way that
isn't commercialized,'' said Dave Nachmanoff, a singer-songwriter
from Southern California who began performing house concerts a year
and a half ago after finding out about them on the Internet.
``That's why when people go to their first house concert, they're
amazed that people can do something like this. I've done a lot of
shows where by the end of the night I've known every person in the
audience at least by their first name.''
</P>
<P>
   The hosts of these concerts are generally just ordinary people
who like music. By day, Elliott, 44, works in the technical support
division of a computer company and Ms. Maynard, 43, is a
schoolteacher. But once a month they become music promoters,
plastering the city with posters advertising public concerts in
their living room by relatively well-known singer-songwriters like
Hubbard, writer of the honky-tonk shout-along ``Up Against the
Wall, Redneck Mother.''
</P>
<P>
   And Elliott and Ms. Maynard are not alone in Durham. Steve and
Celeste Gardner hold a concert series in their home nearby. Last
month, in an effort to give the performances more legitimacy, the
Gardners even turned their house into a nonprofit corporation,
complete with a board of directors and an advisory committee.
</P>
<P>
   For the musicians, who range from up-and-comers who can't get a
club date to some of folk's most acclaimed songwriters, the pay at
house concerts is generally better than at clubs. Since most home
owners already have jobs and are happy just to have these
performers in their living rooms, they usually give them the whole
take. In addition, the audience is generally more attentive, more
enthusiastic, more affluent and more willing to buy CDs after the
show.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a dark side: House concerts stand on shaky legal
grounds. Rob Bookman, the counsel for the New York Nightlife
Association, said that in most communities, private residences are
in areas zoned as residential, and when someone charges people to
enter his home he is running a business. In addition, Bookman said,
``there are strict standards of safety for places with live
entertainment, and most residences don't meet those standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of those who act as hosts for house concerts remain unaware
of local ordinances _ ``I just put on my blinders,'' Gardner said _
and promoters and artists say that so far they haven't heard of
anyone having any problems with police, lawsuits or even
complaining neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our community, I wouldn't think anything like that would
come up,'' said Glen Duckett, a computer programmer who runs a
house concert series called ``Flowers in the Desert'' in Brenham,
Texas, an hour outside Houston. ``The fire marshal has been in my
home for a concert. I look at it this way: We're not any different
than a Tupperware party. Someone is coming in to present wares and
make money, and someone holding the party gets a few free dishes.
In my case, I always get a free CD.''
</P>
<P>
   Though house concerts seem like a throwback to a time before the
rise of the nightclub and concert hall in antebellum America, their
return is largely a result of technology: the Internet, which has
made it possible for those who run house concerts to promote the
shows at no cost, keep in contact with one another and hunt down
possible performers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have about 90 places around the country that hold house
concerts listed on our Web site, and we believe that it's very
possible that there are three or four times that many going on
around the nation,'' said Duckett, who runs the Web site
www.houseconcerts.com.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there may be even more house concerts than Duckett
imagines, thanks to a new twist on the idea developed by Kimberli
Ransom, a 30-year-old singer-songwriter known by fellow musicians
as the queen of house concerts. Instead of performing in the
established circuit of living rooms, Ms. Ransom schedules her own
tours by talking fans _ and their friends and relatives _ who have
never organized a house concert into letting her play.
</P>
<P>
   During each tour, Ms. Ransom asks fans to indicate on her
mailing list whether they are interested in being host for one of
her emotionally charged folk-rock concerts. Then, before her next
tour, she calls those who expressed interest, explains how a house
concert works and sends them a packet of information. Through this
technique she has performed 150 house concerts in the last year and
a half. She has even picked up a sponsor, Jim Beam, which fronted
her $2,200 for tour expenses, and has written a book on the
phenomenon, ``House Concerts: A Guide for Musicians and Hosts.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   This ``word-of-mouth tour,'' as she calls it, germinated when
she decided to release records on her own instead of through a
small music label. ``I wanted to go national,'' she said, ``and I
was willing to do what I had to: Give up my house and my day job
and live on the road. So I thought, How would it be possible to do
this without a record label? And the answer was obvious: my fans.
So I'm playing in the homes of my fans. And not just that: their
friends. They'll see on my itinerary that I'm going through
somewhere and send my CD to a friend or relative who lives there.
And 99 percent of the people who host me want to do it again. I now
have a schedule that takes me through July.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides being able to build a more loyal and far-flung fan base
than through club shows, house concert musicians like Ms. Ransom
also have the bonus of being pampered by their hosts, who often
feed them home-cooked meals and put them up comfortably for the
night. As a general rule, house concert presenters are much more
grateful hosts than club owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife and I just pinch ourselves that these people are in
our living room sometimes,'' said Tim Blixt, a park superintendent
who presents concerts in his log cabin in Wayne, N.J., by
singer-songwriters like Cliff Eberhardt, Cheryl Wheeler and Jimmy
LaFave. ``I'm convinced that the people we present in our living
room are the most talented people making music today.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   One could probably trace house concerts back to any point in
history. In early America, one of the cradles of music was the
home: There were soirees at antebellum plantations, dances at
country cabins with local fiddlers. Before he found national fame
as a blues musician, Muddy Waters became a local celebrity by
turning his cabin in the Mississippi Delta into a raucous juke
joint for music and moonshine at night.
</P>
<P>
   The modern house concert, however, emerged as a trend only a few
years ago. Such shows had existed for decades in sporadic fashion,
but only recently _ thanks in part to the success of slightly older
house-concert series like Rouse House in Austin, Texas, and Urban
Campfires in San Antonio _ have there been enough shows to
constitute an actual circuit and scene. Small towns, rural areas
and suburbs with no clubs for acoustic music now regularly bring in
touring performers.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Most house performances follow the same format: The concerts are
promoted through the Internet, fliers, word of mouth and sometimes
local newspapers or college radio stations, all of which include
the phone number but not the address of the home. Tickets run from
$5 to $25, and the show begins between 7 and 8 in the evening. The
crowd could be anywhere from 10 to 100 people.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, the show is preceded by a potluck dinner, a
catered meal or, in the case of one series in an 18th-century
farmhouse in Connecticut, carriage rides and stew. Living rooms are
preferred to yards and porches because they are more intimate and
the acoustics are better. Smoking is generally forbidden, and the
availability of alcohol varies. The concert begins with an
introduction by the host, and then the performer plays two
45-minute sets, with a break for snacking, socializing and CD
selling in between. The only expenses for the host are optional
ones _ renting folding chairs, buying refreshments, copying fliers
and so on.

<P>
   Some houses are much nicer than others, and some hosts take
their house concerts much more seriously than others, like Jimmy
Riddle, a 39-year-old psychiatrist in Columbia, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   The night after his house concert in Durham, Hubbard drove to
Columbia to perform at Riddle's beautiful turn-of-the-century home.
As Riddle prepared for the show by removing his 17th-century vases
from their pedestals and sitting in each of the 41 chairs he had
arranged to make sure the leg room was ample and the sightline was
good, his mother, Nell, stood in the kitchen cooking sausages,
making sandwiches and heating apple cider.
</P>
<P>
   ``These cups are too small,'' she said, shaking her head.
``That's what happens when you send Jimmy out to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   With his baby pictures still on display on the coffee table,
Riddle began greeting his guests, collecting $12.50 from each. One
of them was Garry Cockerill, a 42-year-old dry-cleaning supply
salesman who read about the concert in a newspaper and drove 45
minutes from Sumter, blasting Ray Wylie Hubbard CDs out of his
convertible the whole way. It was Cockerill's first house concert.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe my ears when he said it was going to be in
his house,'' he said. ``I kept laughing, `You're telling me that
you're going to have Ray Wylie Hubbard in your living room?'''
</P>
<P>
   But by the time he left the mesmerizing and often humorous
two-hour show, Cockerill had been converted. ``That was something
else,'' he said, clutching a newly bought, freshly autographed CD
by Hubbard. ``I'll definitely be back for the next one.''

UNRESOLVED RACIAL MURDERS ARE BEING RE-EXAMINED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala., La., Miss., Texas)  (lb) 
 By EMILY YELLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. _ A federal grand jury has been hearing
evidence for more than a year in a 1963 racist bombing that killed
four black girls in a downtown Birmingham church.
</P>
<P>
   In Louisiana, the wife of one of the first black deputy sheriffs
in a small parish met last month with a prosecutor who recently
began re-examining the 1965 killing of her husband in an ambush.
</P>
<P>
   And in Mississippi, a white man pleaded guilty this summer, and
three others are to go on trial this week, in the 1970 killing of a
black sharecropper who was beaten and found dead in a rural river.
</P>
<P>
   Across the South, these and other unresolved, racially motivated
killings of blacks from the civil rights era are under new
scrutiny. This fresh round of investigations into the long-ago
killings, many of which had been ignored by authorities for years,
was inspired by the well-publicized conviction in 1994 of an aging
white defendant in the 1963 assassination of the Mississippi civil
rights leader Medgar Evers.
</P>
<P>
   For years, black community leaders and relatives of victims had
complained about the lack of action in both the higher-profile and
the lesser-known of these cases. But recently their urgings have
been taken more seriously, experts and historians say, because the
South's political, social and legal climate has changed
significantly since the era of the killings.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks have steadily gained political power and have pushed for
these cases to be heard before today's racially diverse juries. At
the same time, more witnesses, perhaps with less fear of
retaliation and with heavy consciences they want to unburden, are
coming forward.
</P>
<P>
   And a new breed of prosecutors and investigators, feeling an
urgency as many witnesses and defendants in the cases grow old, is
realizing the important role that resolving these cases can play in
the South's efforts to move beyond its past of racial hate and
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the South, we now have a black constituency that has
political clout, and a white constituency that is not against these
hatemongers being brought to justice,'' said David Sansing,
professor emeritus of history at the University of Mississippi.
``And the black constituency, emboldened by new-found political
power, is saying, `Justice delayed is justice denied, so let's quit
denying this justice.' Surprisingly, they are being met with
sympathy from district attorneys.''
</P>
<P>
   At least seven of these long-dormant cases are currently being
re-examined in the South. A few are before grand juries or are
being prosecuted. But some have only just begun to be
reinvestigated and have had little national attention.
</P>
<P>
   The officials pursuing these cases are mostly Southern and
mostly white. Most are in their mid-40s to early 50s. A few have
childhood memories of the crimes and of the violent reaction of the
Ku Klux Klan to school integration and black voter registration.
But they all share some sense that the decades-old cases are still
a stumbling block to the South's progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``These prosecutors,'' Sansing said, ``are realizing that
they've got to do it now, rather than leave it unsettled forever.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, U.S. Attorney Doug Jones, 45, a Birmingham native,
was 9 when Birmingham's 16th Street Baptist Church, a center for
civil rights activity in the 1960s, was bombed, killing the four
girls. As a law student in 1977 he skipped classes for a week to
watch Bill Baxley, who was the Alabama attorney general,
successfully prosecute the Klan leader Robert Chambliss for murder
in the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Baxley chose not to prosecute other suspects at that time, in
the hope that better cases could be developed against them later.
When Jones became a U.S. attorney in 1997, he pushed for the
current grand jury investigation of others named in FBI files as
suspects in the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be able to get back and reopen the case, and let the
community know that it's not forgotten, that's important for
everybody,'' Jones said. ``If you can bring it to closure, everyone
can finish the healing process.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reason the climate is better for pursuing these cases
today, said Morris Dees, executive director of the Southern Poverty
Law Center in Montgomery, Ala., is that the FBI, which investigated
some of the cases when they occurred, is more cooperative than it
was 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In the Birmingham case, for example, documents show that J.
Edgar Hoover, who was then the FBI director, prevented bureau
agents from meeting with prosecutors to present the voluminous
evidence they had collected. Now it is the bureau that is leading
the new investigation, along with Jones' office.
</P>
<P>
   The re-examination of the Birmingham bombing was a result of
meetings between local black religious and community leaders and
local bureau officials in the mid-1990s. Officials close to the
case now would not discuss specific evidence, but have said there
are no new suspects, only new information. Still, there are hints
at the direction in which the case is going.
</P>
<P>
   Of the three other suspects named in the original FBI report,
two are living: Tommy Blanton Jr. in Birmingham and Bobby Frank
Cherry in Texas. According to a book on the bombing, ``Until
Justice Rolls Down,'' by a Birmingham News reporter, Frank Sikora,
witnesses quoted in FBI files had named Cherry as the one who
placed the bomb at the church. Blanton was said to have owned a car
linked to the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Both men have maintained their innocence. The bureau interviewed
Cherry recently and some members of his family have appeared before
the grand jury hearing the case.
</P>
<P>
   Also appearing before the grand jury this summer were two white
supremacists J.B. Stoner and Robert Shelton. Stoner was convicted
in another church bombing in Birmingham and shared a prison cell
with Chambliss.
</P>
<P>
   Federal civil rights charges were used in the 1960s to convict a
few suspects in these kinds of slayings, but the statute of
limitations on those charges has run out in the Birmingham case as
well as in all the other cases from that time.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said that his office was looking into using a federal law
with no statute of limitations concerning the transport of dynamite
in the bombing. He said there is also a possibility of using state
murder charges, which have no statute of limitations, as was done
in 1977 against Chambliss.
</P>
<P>
   But murder was the charge in the successful conviction in 1994
in Jackson, Miss., of the former Klansman, Byron De La Beckwith,
who shot to death Evers, the field secretary of the Mississippi
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, . The
conviction came after two prosecutions of Beckwith ended in
mistrials in the 1960s. The case inspired the film ``Ghosts of
Mississippi.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Medgar Evers case was a wedge in the dam,'' said Dees of
the law center, which keeps track of hate crimes and first called
attention to many of the unresolved killings with racial links.
``It gave everyone a tremendous amount of hope.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   That hope helped to stir the call for reopening the Birmingham
case. It also prompted the family of Vernon Dahmer in Mississippi
to push for a trial in his 1966 killing. In 1998, a former Klan
leader, Sam Bowers, was convicted of the fire-bombing murder of
Dahmer, the Hattiesburg NAACP president.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by those successes, other families have begun pushing
in the past year for answers in some of the lesser-known, long-ago
slayings linked to race. ``The South is still in the process of a
cleansing moment with these cases,'' said Myrlie Evers-Williams,
66, widow of Medgar Evers and chairwoman emeritus of the NAACP.
``I'm so thankful that others who have suffered the same injustice
as we did have moved forth. To see that pebble dropped in the water
and the ripples go out says something about justice in this
country. There is still hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, not everyone is happy that these cases are back in the
public spotlight. Many prosecutors said they had been asked over
and over why they wanted to stir up trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll hear it from white people on the golf course,'' said Bob
Helfrich, 45, the assistant district attorney in Hattiesburg who
prosecuted Bowers and plans to prosecute Charles Noble, another man
charged in the Dahmer case, next spring. ``They say, `Haven't we
spent enough money on this?' I have blacks tell me not to mess with
this, too. It is costly. But you can't put a price on justice.''
</P>
<P>
   In Birmingham, at a recent ceremony at the 16th Street Church
commemorating the victims of the bombing, police officers stood
guard outside. The church's pastor, the Rev. Christopher Hamlin,
said such vigilance is necessary because the church has continued
to receive bomb threats, especially in the three years since the
case was reopened.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street from the church, on a recent sunny day, Ronald
Roscoe, 47, a heating and air-conditioning technician, who is
black, was spending his lunch break in Kelly Ingram Park, near the
church's memorial to the four girls killed in the bombing. A city
gardener using a leaf blower reminded Roscoe of the images from
three decades ago of police officers wielding fire hoses in the
park to disperse civil rights protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the reopening of the bombing case, Roscoe said:
``It's a waste of time. I wish them luck, but after all this time I
don't believe the guys who did the bombing are ever going to be
convicted.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, Shane Buggay, 32, an orthopedic surgeon, who is white,
disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they can get them, then those men should pay,'' Buggay
said. ``Time has nothing to do with it. They are still trying to
convict Nazis for war crimes from World War II. It is just like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   But not all of the recently resurrected cases in the South have
resulted in convictions.
</P>
<P>
   In Belzoni, Miss., this summer one suspect was acquitted in the
1970 slaying of Rainey Pool, a one-armed sharecropper. Another man,
Joe Oliver Watson, pleaded guilty to manslaughter in the case this
summer and is awaiting sentencing. Three others are set to go on
trial Wednesday on charges of murdering Pool.
</P>
<P>
   In Montgomery, earlier this year, a grand jury failed to indict
two suspects, both former Klansmen, in the 1957 slaying of Willie
Edwards Jr., a black truck driver.
</P>
<P>
   And officials in Philadelphia, Miss., despite urging from the
families of the victims, are not saying publicly whether they are
investigating or will try to prosecute in state court any of the 18
men indicted on federal civil rights charges in the slaying of
three civil rights workers there in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Seven of those 18 were convicted on federal charges, including
Bowers, but none has ever been tried by the state for the
Philadelphia killings.
</P>
<P>
   Baxley, the former Alabama attorney general who prosecuted the
Birmingham bombing case in 1977, said some of the same problems he
encountered 20 years ago still exist. For instance, he said his
main concern in 1977 was to show the jury that Chambliss, by then a
frail 74-year-old, was once capable of killing four children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It worried me,'' Baxley said, ``that they would look at him
and think how could this old man be a threat to anybody. So we had
to let the jury see that this is not a harmless old grandfather or
uncle. They had to see the evil in this man.''
</P>
<P>
   Other major impediments to getting convictions are aging
witnesses with failing memories, or key witnesses who have already
died. In some of the slayings, no case files exist and no
transcripts from trials on federal charges exist, as they do in
better-known cases like the Evers slaying, the killings of the
Philadelphia, Miss., rights workers and the Birmingham church
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Another hurdle in the Birmingham case in 1977 was that people
remained afraid of retaliation from the Klan. Two major witnesses,
whose testimony Baxley believed might have helped convict others in
the bombing, refused to testify.
</P>
<P>
   These days, some of that fear persists, but it is far less
potent. In the Birmingham case this summer, the third of Cherry's
five wives told reporters before her grand jury testimony that
Cherry had admitted his involvement in the bombing and had bragged
about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not all people remain the same all through their lives,'' said
Joseph Lewis, 47, head of the Birmingham division of the FBI, which
has been investigating the case since 1996. ``When they are getting
close to their final days, they may say, `Well, it's time to clear
my conscience before I meet my maker.' That's what you hope for in
cases like this.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETER'S, Nova Scotia _ In a grand North Atlantic arc, from
Washington to Newfoundland to Norway, Scandinavians and their New
World descendants are gearing up for a series of lavish museum
exhibits next spring, designed to celebrate the 1,000th anniversary
of the arrival of the first Europeans in North America.
</P>
<P>
   But here, in a little fishing village 500 miles south of Leif
Ericsson's short-lived colony, a feisty, two-finger typist is
waging a one-man battle, happily trying to prick the Vikings'
balloon. This fall, Farley Mowat, one of Canada's best known
authors, is watching his new paperback climb high on Canada's
best-seller lists. The title is: ``The Farfarers: Before the
Norse.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Norse were not the first to cross the Atlantic,'' the
78-year-old writer said recently as he prepared to close his summer
cottage here for the winter. ``I always had this sense that someone
was there ahead of the Norse _ in Iceland, in Greenland, in
Labrador.''
</P>
<P>
   In his book, drawn on half a century of poking around stone
ruins sprinkled around the remote reaches of the North Atlantic,
Mowat theorizes that a ``pre-Indo European people'' that he has
decided to call the Albans sailed forth from the north of Scotland
in the 700s, partly fleeing Viking slave raiders and partly lured
by walrus herds. Before elephant ivory was available from Africa,
northern Europeans prized walrus tusks, carving them into crosses,
buttons, knife handles and saddle pommels. Following the walrus,
the Albans island-hopped until they reached northern Labrador.
Unable to return before winter, they built stone longhouses and
roofed them with their boats.
</P>
<P>
   A generation ago, in the mid-1960s, Mowat wrote ``Westviking _
The Ancient Norse in Greenland and North America,'' a book that
popularized new discoveries from the excavation of Ericsson's
colony at L'Anse aux Meadows on Newfoundland's northernmost tip.
Now, just weeks before the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History is
to open a large show, ``Vikings: The North Atlantic Saga,''
American bookstores are to start carrying his new book, which
argues that another group from Europe beat the Vikings here by 200
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, here comes Farley to rain on that parade,'' said Tom
Powers, an editor at his American publisher, Steerforth Press, said
of the Viking exhibits. ``Well, isn't that what writers are
supposed to do? Celebrate stories we know, and uncover new ones?''
</P>
<P>
   Many archaeologists and some reviewers have dismissed
``Farfarers'' as far-fetched.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has gotten some hard and fast scientific information and
then put a spin on it that 95 percent of professional
archaeologists would not support,'' said Kevin E. McAleese, curator
of a show that is to open in June at Newfoundland's provincial
museum, ``Full Circle: First Contact, the Vikings and Skraelings in
Newfoundland and Labrador.'' Referring to the Viking word for
native Americans, McAleese, said: ``It is about the first contact
between the Skraelings, or peoples of our side of the Atlantic,
with the peoples of the other.''
</P>
<P>
   From Washington, Bill Fitzhugh, curator of the Smithsonian
Viking show, called the book's theory ``very far-fetched'' and
based on ``no evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Such criticism does not faze Mowat, who was once barred from the
United States for telling a reporter that he had fired his .22
caliber rifle at U.S. Air Force jets flying overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Mowat, whose 36 books have taught generations of North Americans
and Europeans to look differently at wolves, whales, Eskimos, and
Vikings, now believes that fresh thinking is needed on the history
of human contacts across the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like the concept of firsts _ people drifted across
this planet like smoke,'' Mowat said during a break from banging on
his Underwood manual typewriter. ``We have to restore history to
what it originally was: stories. We have to take it away from the
academics, and put it back in the hands of the storytellers, the
saga men.''
</P>
<P>
   For this master storyteller, whose books have been translated
into 52 languages and have sold 15 million copies, the saga began
one windy summer day in 1966 in northern Quebec when Thomas Lee, a
Canadian archaeologist, showed him a series of well-fitted,
cylindrical towers and several rectangular stone foundations.
Researching the towers, he found they were always visible from the
sea. The foundations, about 30 in all, were found around polynyas,
or areas of the ocean where winds and currents generally prevent
freezing.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The mystery was this: How were these longhouses roofed? Lying
hundreds of miles north of the historic tree line, there was no
timber available for beams. Excavations of the foundations found no
evidence of whale bones used as supports. Several decades later, on
a visit to Northern Scotland's Shetland Islands, Mowat and his wife
Claire, spied what they thought was the answer: houses and animal
enclosures roofed with overturned fishing boats.
</P>
<P>
   Weaving together bits and pieces of Norse sagas, chronicles of
Irish monks, and archaeological evidence that he had picked up
during a lifetime of travels in Iceland, Greenland and the Canadian
Arctic, Mowat wrote what he calls ``a detective story'' and what
his Canadian publishers, Seal Books and Key Porter Books, list as
nonfiction.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Schledermann, a Canadian archaeologist, who has excavated
many of the rectangular ruins, has said that all the artifacts
recovered from the 700-1000 A.D. period were left by the Dorset
people, an indigenous group that was supplanted by Inuit, or
Eskimos, between 1000 and 1500.
</P>
<P>
   ``Farley went too far when he decided that the sites we were
working on in the high Arctic were related to Alban activities,''
said the scientist who directs the Arctic Institute of North
America at the University of Calgary. ``There is not a shred of
evidence of that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mowat relishes the controversy. Over the last decade, he
noted, archaeologists in the Americas have discovered things where,
according to reigning wisdom, they should not be. A series of
discoveries, some dating back as far as 15,000 years, have forced
archaeologists to abandon a fiercely held dogma that the oldest
human habitation in the Americas was tied to 11,000-year-old spear
points found in Clovis, N.M. In October, archaeologists in Brazil
unveiled the oldest known human fossil in the Americas, an
11,500-year-old skull with African features.
</P>
<P>
   Mowat says that many scientists admit to him privately that the
ancient history of trans-Atlantic travel is lost in the murk of
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scientific reaction is: `We are sympathetic to your
hypotheses, but we can't admit it, our jobs are at stake, our
reputations are at stake,''' he said, with a subversive twinkle in
his eye.

 By MIREYA NAVARRO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a studio in the theater district this past
weekend, close to 200 girls and young women auditioned for a new
musical. But this was no ordinary open casting call, for the role
being cast was that of Selena, the Tejano singing star whose murder
in 1995 at 23 horrified millions of fans, particularly the young
Hispanic women who saw themselves in her.
</P>
<P>
   One of them was Paola Cubides, a 20-year-old New Yorker of
Colombian descent, who said she had first heard Selena perform when
she stumbled upon a homemade cassette tape of her songs in school
one day. Two days later the singer was killed, and Ms. Cubides
would forever feel ``such a connection'' to her.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cubides said Selena was her role model _ an American-born,
English-speaking Latina with indigenous features like her own who
did not stray from her cultural roots to be successful. So when Ms.
Cubides' turn came up as No. 68 last Friday to try out for the role
of the adult Selena (there is also a part for Selena as a child),
she closed her eyes, squeezed the microphone hard and poured her
heart into ``Dreaming of You,'' one of Selena's posthumous hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``She gave me hope that I'd be able to make it too,'' Ms.
Cubides, an aspiring performer who plans to pursue musical training
next year and apply to Juilliard, said later. ``Right now she would
have been huge.''
</P>
<P>
   Selena Quintanilla Perez achieved in death the celebrity of an
Elvis Presley or a Marilyn Monroe among Latinos and others, even on
the East Coast and in other areas where she was not as well known
or where Tejano music was not as popular as in Texas, her home
state. Already the subject of movies, documentaries, books, tribute
issues of magazines and a ballet (George Faison's ``Idol
Obsession''), she is about to be memorialized again in ``Selena
Forever,'' a stage musical envisioned as a celebration of her life
and music.
</P>
<P>
   The producers of ``Selena Forever,'' who include the clothing
magnate Jerry Frankel (``Death of a Salesman,'' ``Jekyll and
Hyde,'' ``Charlie Brown''), say they plan to take the show, an
ambitious production with 25 cast members and an estimated cost of
close to $2 million, directly to Selena's audiences with a tour of
30 cities. It is scheduled to begin in San Antonio in March, the
fifth anniversary of her death. Its success on the road will
determine when and if it comes to Broadway, they said.
</P>
<P>
   With live music and an emphasis on the love story between Selena
and her husband, Chris Perez, her band's lead guitarist, the
producers said, the musical will aim for a wider audience than the
1997 film ``Selena,'' which was a financial success but did not
quite cross over to non-Hispanic audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing that amazes me is that I speak to people _ to old
people, to young people, non-Hispanics _ and nine out of 10 people
know who Selena is,'' said Frankel, who once owned a company that
had the license to manufacture the singer's line of clothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will strike a chord,'' he said of the production.
``It's a tragic story, but it's going to end on a high note.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the movie, in which the actress Jennifer Lopez
lip-synched to Selena's recordings, the musical will feature an
actress who will use her own voice for what is mostly an original
score. Only about a third of the music consists of Selena's songs.
</P>
<P>
   But like the upbeat biographical movie, the musical will gloss
over the singer's murder or any of the unsavory rumors that
followed it. There is not even a part in the script for Yolanda
Saldivar, the disgruntled employee and fan club founder who is
serving a life sentence for shooting the singer in the back after
being confronted with allegations of embezzlement by the
Quintanilla family. The stage production's script calls for the
story to start out with a shot and be told in flashbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Michel Vega, a theatrical booking agent who is a co-producer of
the musical with Frankel and John Quinn, a restaurateur, noted that
after ``West Side Story,'' with its gang warfare, and ``The
Capeman,'' with a murderer as its central character, ``Selena
Forever'' offers the opportunity to build a Latin-themed musical
around a positive figure for a change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to focus on all the great things she means to a
lot of people,'' Vega, a Cuban-American, said. ``We think there are
enough negative images around.''
</P>
<P>
   Selena achieved stardom in the United States and Mexico with
Tejano music, a bouncy blend of pop, polka and country rhythms from
the Southwest border dominated by male performers. She performed
since childhood with her siblings in a band that was managed by her
father and eventually included her future husband, and overcame
humble beginnings and language and cultural barriers in the
Hispanic world (she sang in Spanish but spoke it with a Texas
accent) to become known as the ``Queen of Tejano Music.''
</P>
<P>
   Selena, who had won a Grammy Award and earned a gold album, was
poised to release her first record in English and come full circle
in her identity as a Mexican-American artist, when she was shot
during a meeting with Ms. Saldivar in a motel in Corpus Christi,
Texas, her hometown. More than 30,000 people filed past her coffin
as she lay in state, and her posthumous album, ``Dreaming of You,''
made its debut at No. 1 on the Billboard charts.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, said Abraham Quintanilla, the star's father, the
family is deluged by letters ``from all over the world.''
Quintanilla has given ``Selena Forever'' licensing rights and acts
as an adviser to the show. He said he liked the script, by Edward
Gallardo, and loved the original music and lyrics by Gallardo and
Fernando Rivas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost five years after Selena's death, there's an insatiable
hunger for anything having to do with Selena,'' Quintanilla, 61,
said in a telephone interview from Corpus Christi, explaining why
he gave his blessing to the project. ``The public has not forgotten
her. As her father, I try to keep her alive through her music.''
</P>
<P>
   So the search is on for the embodiment of a cultural icon, a
young performer capable of conveying not only Selena's artistry but
also her unpretentiousness, sense of humor and warmth. The
musical's casting director, Stephen DeAngelis, arrived in New York
this weekend after casting calls in San Antonio, Corpus Christi,
Houston, Chicago, Las Vegas and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Miami, the last stop before a choice is made in December, is
next.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here out of respect,'' DeAngelis told the first group of
50 adults who showed up to audition at a Manhattan studio last
Friday. ``The doors Selena opened, she opened for all of you.''
</P>
<P>
   There were white Selenas and dark-skinned Selenas. Selenas in
jeans and Selenas in the shimmering tight pants and bras the singer
favored. There were off-key Selenas and Selenas who sounded very
much like the real thing, with the sob in the voice.
Dominican-American and Puerto Rican Selenas outnumbered Selenas
with roots in Peru, Honduras and Cuba. Or even French Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a model for me _ her charisma, her positive attitude and
the care she had for her fans,'' said Melanie Lagace, 21, a bank
employee and Latin band singer who rode a bus all night Thursday
from Montreal to make her first audition. ``Whatever the outcome of
the audition, I hope the spirit of Selena remains in every heart.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)

   nn
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday red lips and heavy makeup gave way to baby faces as
about 30 prepubescent girls showed up with parents, aunts and other
relatives to try out for the role of young Selena. The girls had to
look between 8 and 11, bear some resemblance to the singer and be
bilingual and ``sensitive and funny with an exceptionally powerful

cappella.

   ``I'm not sure,'' Courtnie Beceiro, 9, a fifth-grader at P.S.
188 in Queens, said in a whisper, shaking her head, when a reporter
asked her if she was up to the challenge of playing such a widely
revered figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was beautiful outside and inside,'' Courtnie said. ``She
showed a lot of people, especially Mexicans, Spaniards and so on,
that they can make a difference in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just even thinking about Selena and why somebody would want to
kill her makes me cry,'' she added, becoming teary-eyed.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such emotion, it was not lost on the candidates that
Selena, the role, could be the ticket to their own stardom, doing
for them what the movie did for Jennifer Lopez, who now commands
millions of dollars a film. In contrast to the casting calls for
the movie, which attracted thousands of hopefuls in a single city,
DeAngelis has so far tried out only about 1,000 candidates in seven
cities for the more demanding stage role.
</P>
<P>
   Most of them have had little professional experience, but that
does not matter, DeAngelis said, adding that he had already found
strong candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take a special girl to play a special girl,'' he
said. ``We're looking to really discover someone.''

STENCH OF HORROR LINGERS IN A PRISON IN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms)

<P>
   DUBRAVA, Yugoslavia _ The high, red brick walls of Dubrava
prison tell little. Like the modern police buildings outside, they
bear signs of bomb damage from NATO attacks in May this year, but
that is only half the story.
</P>
<P>
   Just inside the prison walls there are piles of abandoned
clothes, drenched by months of rain but still giving off a stench
of human corpses. The smell pervades the prison buildings inside, a
reminder of the horror that gripped the prison for five days in
late spring, when NATO bombing and the Serbian rampage against
Kosovo's Albanians combined to turn this prison into what a former
prisoner and Spanish peacekeepers who now guard the buildings
depict as a site of murderous mayhem.
</P>
<P>
   Naser Husaj, a former public prosecutor from the nearby town of
Pec and at the time one of Kosovo's most prominent political
prisoners, was in Dubrava prison in May. Returning to the prison
for the first time since his release a month ago, he described a
terrifying ordeal in which prisoners were trapped first by NATO
bombing, which killed at least 23 prisoners, and then by masked
Serbian police forces, who killed more than 100 other Albanian
inmates in running battles raging through the prison for two days.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were taking advantage of NATO's action,'' he said of the
Serbian guards. ``They wanted to kill us all.''
</P>
<P>
   The blood and smell of death remain, nearly six months later.
Bedding and clothes are strewn all over the extensive grounds where
prisoners dragged them out to sleep outside in an attempt to avoid
the NATO air strikes. And in the basements of the buildings, the
blood lies still sticky on the floor, bullet holes scar the walls,
and impact marks of grenade explosions crater the floors.
</P>
<P>
   Husaj, founder of the Kosovo Albanian nationalist party Balli
Kombetar, was serving a five-year sentence imposed by the Serbian
authorities, for heading what they branded a ``fascist quisling''
organization.
</P>
<P>
   He spent three years in Dubrava from 1995 to 1998, then a year
in a Serbian prison, before being brought back to Kosovo during the
NATO air campaign. Released at the end of his sentence last month,
he returned this past weekend to the prison for the first time and
told his story.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first attack started on May 19,'' he said of the NATO
bombing. ``They hit pavilion C, a cell block, and three people were
killed. On May 20 there was no bombing, and then on the May 21 at 8
a.m. we heard a plane. The guards ran away, and we ran out into the
middle of the grounds. They were hitting blocks all day.''
</P>
<P>
   He said all the guards had left the compound, including the
watchtowers, though some remained outside and kept strict security
around the prison. Some prisoners who were already out of their
cells for regular cleaning or cooking duties then freed other
prisoners from their cells.
</P>
<P>
   Some 20 people were killed that day, he said, pointing out a
bomb crater that still stank of human flesh where several people
had been killed. They carried the bodies up to the far end of the
grounds and laid them out by the sports field. That night the
entire prison population, some 900 men, slept in the grass up by
the sports fields, which is inside the prison compound.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning at 8 a.m. the guards returned to just the
watchtowers, and ordered the prisoners to assemble in a long line
in rows of four to prepare to be transferred to another prison.
Husaj was standing at the back to one side with several fellow
political prisoners when suddenly the guards opened fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``They started to shoot with a machine gun at the prisoners,''
he said. ``They threw grenades over the prison walls, and another
machine gun was shooting from a hole in the wall,'' he added,
pointing out the spot. ``Seventy people died in that shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   Husaj explained the shooting as Serbs using the NATO bombing as
an opportunity to take revenge and exact punishment on the
Albanians, and pass it off as a NATO atrocity.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not clear whether the guards had full control over the
900 prisoners who were now freed of their cells. The Spanish
peacekeeping soldiers guarding the prison confirm Husaj's account.
But the incident may have begun as a prison riot, they said, and it
was clear from makeshift weapons found later that some of the
inmates attempted to fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I turned and ran down the slope and into that building, block
B,'' he said. ``Who could escape just ran.'' But they were unable
to leave the compound. Hundreds of prisoners fled into the
buildings, hiding in basements and cells, and later bringing in the
wounded.
</P>
<P>
   For the next 36 hours, anarchy reigned as masked policemen moved
into the grounds, seeking out and attacking prisoners with
automatic weapons and grenades. Prisoners barricaded themselves
into rooms and basements, seizing wooden bars, metal pipes and
pieces of glass as weapons.
</P>
<P>
   In the basement of the cultural center, under insulated heating
pipes and industrial washing machines, the weapons still lay
around: a spade, metal spikes, wooden bars and stretches of metal
piping, wrapped with rags for a better grip.
</P>
<P>
   Pools of dried blood still stained the floor, amid discarded
clothes. Two small round craters from a hand grenade pockmarked the
cement floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought they wanted to kill us all,'' he said, describing
the state of terror of most prisoners. Only a small percentage of
the prisoners, from one block, were hardened criminals, he said;
the rest were Albanians picked up for minor crimes or for political
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Some prisoners trying to escape were shot climbing the walls, he
said. Others finished it for themselves. ``That day four people
went crazy and hanged themselves in their cells,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Husaj himself was nearly killed when three masked policemen
spotted him on the steps of the restaurant building. They fired a
grenade, which hit the entrance wall. He stumbled bleeding down to
the basement, where scores of others were sheltering, and slept
that night in a tiny inner laundry room.
</P>
<P>
   The police stormed the building the next morning. ``They came in
masks, with grenades and machine guns,'' he recalled. ``They
attacked the building with rocket-propelled grenades and shot
through the windows straight into the basement.''
</P>
<P>
   The stench of death from the basement is still overpowering. The
green linoleum floor is still sticky with blood, which has been
smeared around in an attempt to clean it. Husaj moved quickly in
the dark, showing a familiarity with the underground rooms. But
even he gagged as he showed where he saw six people gunned down in
one corridor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's get out of here,'' he said, his face white and gaunt in
the shadows.
</P>
<P>
   After that, the Serbs shouted that the prisoners, holed up in
the basement, had five minutes to surrender or they would be
killed. The prisoners then gave themselves up, walking out with
their hands on their heads, and they were later transferred to
Lipljan prison in central Kosovo. As they left the, police counted
those missing. It came to 154, he said.

 DUBRAVA, Yugoslavia: he said.   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reliving his ordeal, Husaj said he was still not sure what was
more terrifying, the fear of being trapped in the prison when it
was being attacked by NATO planes, or the fear of Serbian police
troops who chased him and tried to kill him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were afraid of both,'' he said. ``The prison blocks were
not so strong, and if NATO hit them they could kill 300 people at
once. And then if NATO hit them, the guards might shoot us again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs killed us like chickens,'' he went on. ``They used
the bombing as an excuse.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also ample evidence that the Serbian guards killed a
large number of inmates when they reasserted control. When they
arrived in June, Spanish troops discovered one body in the prison,
whom they nicknamed Frederico. He had been lying there at least a
month, and his throat had been cut, they said. The basement where
he had been found was where the prisoners had taken the wounded,
Husaj said.
</P>
<P>
   In a nearby village named Rakos, the war crimes tribunal has
reportedly found 97 bodies in a mass grave, thought to be the
bodies of inmates from the prison. Investigators from the tribunal
at The Hague have exhumed the site, and they have also investigated
what happened at the prison. But they have not yet released any
public findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was necessary to come here,'' Husaj said as he was leaving.
``But you must not think too much about what happened, otherwise
you go crazy.''

OWNERSHIP

<TEXT>
<P>
   In the Internet, where information is king, some of the most
valuable information is data about user or customer behavior. Of
this, one of the most closely followed measurements is so-called
``click data,'' which focuses on who has clicked on an advertising
banner or some other particular link. Web site publishers,
advertising agencies and companies who buy those ads have relied
heavily on that data to build their businesses, and until now they
have been generous about sharing it freely with each other.
</P>
<P>
   Now one of the Internet's biggest advertisers is raising the
question of whether that data belongs to anyone but the
advertisers, and the resulting debate could shape the future of the
advertiser-publisher relationship.
</P>
<P>
   According to executives within the Internet advertising
industry, IBM is testing new techniques of serving its ads to
Internet users in a way that prevents publishers from knowing who
clicked on IBM ads displayed on their Web sites. IBM, these
executives say, may then withhold the click data from publishers
unless they can be persuaded to do otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   An IBM official declined to comment about the proposed policy,
saying it was ``premature to speculate.'' Indeed, industry
executives said the company had merely floated the idea of claiming
ownership of click data. But the IBM talk has brought the issue of
data ownership to a head, and given new impetus to a debate that
has loomed as one of the most important facing the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just the tip of the iceberg; and the bottom of that
iceberg is the issue of who owns the data,'' said Michael Donahue,
executive vice president of the American Association of Advertising
Agencies. ``The ad agencies don't want to be cut out, because they
want access to that data. The advertisers say, `It's my money, so
it's my data,' and the publishers say, `That ad is part of my
site's content, so it's my data.'''
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of losing access to click data has sent a shiver
up the spines of Web site publishers, who rely on these statistics
to gauge the effectiveness of advertising and to gather information
about the buying interests of their users. That data is
tremendously valuable to publishers, who can command high
advertising fees for showing, for example, a mortgage company's ad
to someone who has recently clicked on an advertisement for a
realtor.
</P>
<P>
   Publishers also fear that if IBM assumes such a stance, other
advertisers will follow suit. Beyond IBM's considerable spending
power _ industry executives rank the company as one of the top
three advertisers on the Internet _ it has been influential in
shaping industry policies. IBM spearheaded an effort earlier this
year, for instance, to force Web site publishers to post privacy
statements or lose the company's advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Internet advertising executives cite two potential
justifications for withholding click data. For one thing, their
traditional relationship with print publishers and television and
radio networks suggests that the data belongs to advertisers. The
ad buyers generally do not share the results of advertising
campaigns with networks or print publishers when those media run
so-called direct response advertisements _ for example, a
commercial that invites viewers to call an 800 number to buy a
product.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers acknowledge that Internet publishers play a far more
active role in bringing qualified buyers to their doorstep than
other media. But they also make the point that the Internet
ultimately resembles the direct response model, so they could be
justified in handling the data in a similar manner.
</P>
<P>
   Of equal importance for some advertisers is the suspicion that
publishers and other companies that deliver ads are not above
selling click data to an advertiser's competitor. These companies
espouse a so-called Chinese wall policy dictating, for instance,
that publishers do not sell information about people who clicked on
one car company's ad banner to another car company. But industry
executives say that there are violations. ``I don't think it's
pervasive, but there are people doing it,'' said Kevin O'Conn
</P>
<P>
   Most other advertisers, of course, lack the technological
wherewithal to deliver their own ads or to otherwise separate
publishers from click data. But publishers fear other advertisers
could eventually deliver their ads in a manner similar to IBM's new
technique. Or, even if they lack the technical expertise to block
access, advertisers might seek either to contractually prevent
publishers from using that data or to force publishers to pay for
it.
</P>
<P>
   Industry executives say that IBM is sensitive to concerns about
causing a ripple effect, having staked a good measure of its
business future on the growth of the e-commerce industry. But as
the company joins others in pouring millions of advertising dollars
into the Internet economy _ and as the value of customer data
continues to rise _ IBM may decide that now is the time to
establish a precedent on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   According to Vivienne Bechtold, director of interactive
marketing for Procter &AMP; Gamble, the issue could force advertisers
to re-evaluate the role of publishers in helping to build ad
campaigns. Ms. Bechtold, who is also a member of a coalition of
Internet advertising and publishing leaders known as the Future of
Advertising Stakeholders, or FAST, stressed that Procter &AMP; Gamble
had not determined its own position on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can understand why IBM would consider this stance,'' she
said. ``On the other hand, the dynamics of the Internet raise the
question: If we share the data, would advertisers benefit more from
that collective expertise than if we treated them in the
traditional, customer-supplier way?''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, she said, ``advertisers could adopt a hybrid
approach, where we choose to share with some, while with others, we
treat it in the traditional way.''
</P>
<P>
   Other trends are complicating the matter, including the tendency
of advertisers to establish so-called ``pay for performance'' deals
with Web sites. In those agreements, a publisher's payment is often
based on the percentage of users who click on ad banners, so
advertisers would naturally disclose click data to publishers.
Other advertising deals remain on a ``CPM'' model, whereby
advertisers pay a set rate, typically in the $25 range, for every
thousand banners shown on a site. But about half of Internet
advertising deals are a combination of pay-for-performance and CPM,
so disputes over who owns the data could quickly muddy the waters.
</P>
<P>
   Publishers, meanwhile, are using so-called ``collaborative
filtering'' technology to aim ads at consumers on their sites _ and
can offer even more precise targets when they know what ads their
customers are clicking on. Indeed, according to Anil Singh, chief
sales and marketing officer for Yahoo: ``We can target clusters of
our audince that have a higher propensity to click on certain types
of offers. That's a great service for advertisers. If we were
unable to collect data in that effort, it would hurt the services
we could offer our clients.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a growing number of advertisers are choosing
to deliver their ads through third-party servers like Doubleclick
and Flycast, which also rely extensively on click data. Those
companies have much at stake as well. ``Are we willing to step back
and not have access to the data?'' asked Doubleclick's O'Connor.
``I'm not so sure. It could very well not be a good thing for the
advertisers.''
</P>
<P>
   At the center of this issue is Rich LeFurgy, chairman of the
Internet Advertising Bureau, an industry group that represents
Internet publishers. LeFurgy, who is also the chairman of FAST,
said the advertising bureau and IBM were seeking common ground.
``They understand our position, we understand theirs,'' he said.
``But this is stuff that's not to be underestimated in terms of its
importance and implications.''
</P>
<P>
   Internet publishers, however, have little leverage in the
debate, in the view of Jim Nail, an analyst with Forrester
Research. ``Advertisers are ultimately the source of all the money,
so they hold the trump card in this,'' Nail said. ``If they want to
do it, they can.''

 &HT;    Holyfield the champ of sequels
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Evander Holyfield took up golf recently and quickly
became a respectable player.
</P>
<P>
   Still, every so often, he will shank a tee shot into a nearby
tree, a shot that could shake the confidence of someone with a
mindset different from Holyfield's. The three-time heavyweight
champion simply takes a mulligan.
</P>
<P>
   And on the courtesy second attempt, Holyfield usually hits the
fairway.
</P>
<P>
   It is much the same in his boxing career.
</P>
<P>
   With a second fight, Holyfield tees off on his rematch opponent.
He has not lost in five ``mulligan bouts.'' It is one reason he
thinks that his do-over against Lennox Lewis in Las Vegas on
Saturday will be as sweet as a prodigious Tiger Woods drive with a
3-wood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learn from my mistakes,'' Holyfield said. ``You can take a
fight _ even if you win _ and build on it and be better in a
rematch. So, I'm confident I've learned enough from the first fight
with Lennox to turn it into victory.''
</P>
<P>
   His record supports his assertion. Just as a golfer can recall
every shot from a recently completed round, Holyfield has fresh
memories of his rematches. In second bouts, he has beaten Dwight
Qwai, Alex Stewart, Riddick Bowe, Mike Tyson and Michael Moorer.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield won the WBA cruiserweight championship from Qwai 13
years ago in a 15-round decision. In the rematch 17 months later,
he disposed of Qwai in four rounds. As a heavyweight, he turned an
eight-round technical knockout of Stewart in 1989 into a 12-round
decision four years later.
</P>
<P>
   Next up was his dramatic trilogy with Riddick Bowe. Bowe took
Holyfield's undisputed heavyweight championship in a close 12-round
decision Nov. 13, 1992. But Holyfield handled Stewart in his next
fight in 12 rounds and then regained the title by decision in 12
rounds against Bowe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bowe was a bigger guy,'' Holyfieldsaid. ``I jumped into his
chest. I learned from the first fight that I had to jump on him
right away and counter his shots. I let him get off before me too
much in the first fight.''
</P>
<P>
   The joy of that title was short, for the left-handed Moorer
presented awkward angles and took the belt from Holyfield just five
months after he defeated Bowe. As the nonchampion, Holyfield beat
Ray Mercer in a decision and lost to Bowe in their third bout in
the eighth round. Then he polished off Bobby Czyz in five, which
set up his long-awaited confrontation with Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   To the surprise of many people, Holyfield destroyed Tyson and
won by TKO in the 11th. Seven months later, he granted Tyson a
rematch. ``I just flat-out got on top of him,'' Holyfield said.
``The first fight, I didn't know him, so it was kind of learning
and adjusting as I went along. In the second fight, I didn't give
him a chance to gain any confidence. I just pressed him.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressed him to the point that Tyson knew he was beaten. Tyson
sealed his fate by biting Holyfield twice on the right ear;
Holyfield won by TKO disqualification in the third round. ``It
wasn't a difficult fight at all,'' Holyfield said. ``I knew from
the first fight how to slow him down. Just go forward at him from
different angles. Beat him to the punch. Then he doesn't feel like
he's in control or that you're afraid of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Still riding the wave of that conquest, Holyfield sought to
avenge the Moorer defeat of three years earlier. ``Being
left-handed, Moorer was different,'' Holyfield said. ``He won the
first fight, but it was very close. But the next time, it was real
simple. I had to get closer to him. So I said, `How do I get
close?' It was simple. I just covered up, and he had to come in to
hit me. He didn't learn from the first fight. I hit him with the
same shots. I got him close to me and hit him with uppercuts.''
</P>
<P>
   He knocked out Moorer in Round 8.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is Lewis, who believes he won the fight that was
judged a draw when the two men fought in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can trick Evander once but not twice,'' his attorney, Jim
Thomas, said. ``As well as making sure that he's in great physical
condition, Evander and (trainer) Don Turner put a lot of time into
watching the tapes of fights, evaluating and coming up with a very
good fight plan. And in rematch situations, Evander feels much
better than his opponent, because he's studied him so much that he
knows him.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield has studied his lackluster effort against Lewis
repeatedly. And because of his experience in succeeding in
rematches, he claims confidence. ``I'm a better fighter now than I
ever was,'' Holyfield said. ``I'm better in the art of the game. I
understand the game. I know how to set a man up to get my shots
off. Against Lennox, I threw some punches, but they weren't
effective. He didn't want to fight _ he ran _ and I just wanted to
hit him. So, I followed him around trying to make the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this time to be patient. I know how to conserve my
energy. I know how to set him up by being patient and not chasing
him all the time. Like always, I learned from the first fight.''

DESIRE OF THE EVERLASTING HILLS: ASSESSING THE GIFT-GIVER OF
NAZARETH 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(ms) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is the third volume in Thomas Cahill's projected
seven-volume Hinges of History series, in which the author means to
``retell the story of the Western world as the story of the great
gift-givers'' instead of as a sequence of catastrophes, as history
is often portrayed.
</P>
<P>
   The gift-giver in this case is Jesus of Nazareth, whom Cahill
calls ``the central figure of Western civilization.'' The question
posed here is the one Cahill sees as implied by his title, ``Desire
of the Everlasting Hills,'' which those familiar with the Bible
will recognize from Jacob's blessing on his son Joseph, in Genesis
49:26. (Cahill's translation is from the Latin of Jerome's
Vulgate.) As Cahill puts it: ``Is not the desire of the everlasting
hills that they be saved from their everlastingness, that something
new happen, that the everlasting cycle of human cruelty, of man's
inhumanity to man, be brought to an end?'' Or, to put the issue of
his book another way, did Jesus, with his attempts to affect such
changes, make a difference to the world?
</P>
<P>
   This issue will at once be seen to lack the verve of those
brought up in Cahill's previous books, ``How the Irish Saved
Civilization'' and ``The Gifts of the Jews.'' (The subtitle of the
new book is, quietly, ``The World Before and After Jesus,'' whereas
the subtitles of the previous books are ``The Untold Story of
Ireland's Heroic Role From the Fall of Rome to the Rise of Medieval
Europe'' and ``How a Tribe of Desert Nomads Changed the Way
Everyone Thinks and Feels.'')
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Cahill's answer to his question seems obvious. Of
course Jesus made a difference. At the very least, as the author
concludes, ``though war and injustice continue to rage,'' thanks to
Christ's teachings ``we have at last found words to describe and
condemn these oppressions, rather than praise them as we might once
have been tempted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   But posing such an open-ended question also serves as a vehicle
for exploring numerous other matters surrounding Jesus. And Cahill,
the former director of religious publishing at Doubleday, takes
full advantage.
</P>
<P>
   First, he compellingly depicts the world that Jesus arrived in,
painting both the despair of the Jewish people over the dilution of
their culture by conquering overlords and their dreams of a savior,
expressed by the prophecies in the last third of the Book of
Isaiah. (``Comfort ye, comfort ye, my people.'')
</P>
<P>
   Second, he analyzes the books of the New Testament, making
distinct the authors of the Gospels and Epistles _ Mark, Matthew,
Luke and John, and Paul of Tarsus _ and showing how their
backgrounds influenced their varying portraits of Jesus. Third, he
touches on important scriptural controversies, as usual avoiding
the pitfalls of obscureness and making what could easily have been
dull entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth, he touches ever so obliquely on the question of whether
Jesus actually existed. Though there are differences in approach,
he notes the underlying consistency of the portraits and remarks
that this ``makes Jesus a unique figure in world literature: never
have so many writers managed to convey the same impression of the
same human being over and over again.'' And he argues at some
length that the genuineness of the Shroud of Turin has yet to be
refuted, although he denies being a ``shroudie.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he presses certain subtler issues emanating from Jesus'
life. One is that in First Corinthians, Paul becomes ``the first
person in history'' to insist on the essential equality of the
sexes. Another is that, in the words of Rabbi Shaye J.D. Cohen,
Christianity is ``a form of Judaism.'' Cahill stresses this point
throughout, arguing that the two religions have more in common than
at odds and that while each has reason to suspect the other, the
more important challenge for the two is to reconcile.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because so much about Jesus remains unresolved and
controversial, ``Desire of the Everlasting Hills'' lacks the full
delight and insouciance of Cahill's earlier books. The strain of
elucidating so many subtleties about the Scriptures may explain why
the prose zigzags somewhat sharply between high seriousness and
sudden bursts of the vernacular like ``the harder the pecs and the
tighter the buns the more spiritual you were'' (speaking of the
Greek attitude toward the body) or ``Earth to Jesus: Hello!''
(responding to Jesus' injunction against looking on a woman with
lust).
</P>
<P>
   And because so much ground is covered and so much information
packed together, you often feel in danger of missing what Cahill is
really saying on a number of subtle subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``Desire'' remains divertingly instructive and imparts
gratifying dimension to the beginnings of what later became known
as Christianity. Most important, it makes of Jesus a still-living
literary presence. As Cahill writes: ``What especially makes the
Gospels _ from a literary point of view _ works like no others is
that they are about a good human being. As every writer knows, such
a creature is all but impossible to capture on the page, and there
are exceedingly few figures in all of literature who are both good
and memorable.''
</P>
<P>
   He concludes: ``Yet the evangelists, who left no juvenilia
behind them _ no failed novels, rhythmless poems, or other early
works by which we might judge their progress as writers _ whose
Greek was often odd or imprecise, and who were not practiced
writers of any sort, these four succeeded where almost all others
failed. To a writer's eyes, this feat is a miracle just a little
short of raising the dead.''

ENVOYS IN RUSSIA TO GET COSTLY Y2K LEAVES
</HEADLINE>
   (Exclusive) 
(jw) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Although the State Department is planning to withdraw
hundreds of government employees and their families from Russia and
other former Soviet republics before Jan. 1, experts at the
American Embassy in Moscow have concluded there is virtually no
risk to diplomats from the Year 2000 computer problem.
</P>
<P>
   The evacuation of diplomats, other government employees and
their families who wish to leave could cost millions of dollars and
reflects anxiety in Washington about the possible disruption of
electricity, heat and other basic services in the former Soviet
Union as a result of computer failures.
</P>
<P>
   The United States maintains diplomatic posts in more than 100
nations, but it plans to withdraw personnel over the Jan. 1 period
from just four: Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats in other nations like China either did not see a need
to leave because of possible computer glitches or because they are
already inured to hardships like power failures, according to
American officials.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Russia is likely to experience its share of
disruptions. An internal assessment by the American Embassy notes
that computer failures may interfere with telephone service and
produce electrical failures, which it says may last for a day or so
in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   But these are likely to be inconveniences, rather than real
dangers for American government employees, the review suggests.
Even if such disruptions occur, the American Embassy here and the
compound where many diplomats live have their own backup
generators, fuel, stores of food and water and Iridium telephones,
which can be used to make calls through communications satellites.
</P>
<P>
   ``The short-term risk to lives, health and safety as a result of
these disruptions is negligible,'' the review states.
</P>
<P>
   The Year 2000 problem stems from the fact that computers have
been programmed to read only the last two digits of a year. Unless
adjustments are made, that could cause them to read the year 2000
as 1900, interfering with public utilities, aviation, banks and
other enterprises that use computers.
</P>
<P>
   After a slow start, the Russian government appears to be taking
the problem seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Russians recognize that this problem is not
hypothetical,'' John Beyrle, a State Department specialist on the
former Soviet states told Congress in September. ``They do not have
their heads in the sand, but are struggling to do what is needed as
the clock winds down. In our assessment, the failures are not
likely to be severe or long lasting.''
</P>
<P>
   American experts have said, for example, that the risk of the
accidental launching of a nuclear missile will be virtually nil
because of precautions both sides are taking.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's aviation system appears to be well prepared, according
to American officials. The air traffic control system in Moscow,
for example, has already been tested by the Swedish contractors
that supplied it.
</P>
<P>
   The American Embassy has told Washington that the Year 2000
problem will not increase the likelihood of a Chernobyl-type
accident at Russia's nuclear power plants.
</P>
<P>
   Electricity is a bigger worry, especially since it is needed to
produce heat during Russia's frigid winters. Most of the heat in
Moscow, for example, is generated by plants that produce hot water
using natural gas. The plants use analog systems and are not
vulnerable to the Year 2000 problem. But they use electricity to
pump the water through their pipes.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent computer problems, Russia's electricity monopoly says
it plans to change over to manual control on Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am convinced that not one U.S. diplomat will notice any
problems,'' said Anatoly Chubais, the head of the electrical
monopoly and a former senior Kremlin aide.
</P>
<P>
   Western experts also point out that Moscow's politically
ambitious mayor, Yuri Luzhkov, has taken a special interest in
avoiding disruptions in the capital. If electrical failures do
occur, they are more likely to take place in small towns and
settlements in the countryside than Moscow and Russia's other major
cities.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the Russian public does not appear to be overly
concerned, if only because most people have more pressing economic
worries and because they routinely put up with disruptions to hot
water supply and other utilities.
</P>
<P>
   The Jan. 1 period will be unusually active politically because
of the horse-trading and maneuvering expected to follow Russia's
parliamentary elections on Dec. 19.
</P>
<P>
   In deciding, nevertheless, to withdraw some diplomats from
Russia, the State Department is erring on the side of caution.
American officials said the embassy would stay open and would
maintain a sufficient staff to deal with diplomatic issues, embassy
security and the possible problems encountered by American citizens
here.
</P>
<P>
   Just how many American government employees and family members
plan to leave Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Moldovoa for the United
States is still unclear. A State Department official said that the
estimates ranged from 250 to 800.
</P>
<P>
   The estimated cost to the U.S. government is $10,000 per person
for 30 days, and $5,000 per person if the leave is limited to 15
days. That means the cost to the American government could be as
high as $8 million and as little as $1.25 million. (In contrast,
the United States is spending $7.5 million this year under its
program to create civilian jobs for scientists in Russia's closed
nuclear cities.)
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But the scope of the withdrawal also seems to have been
influenced by State Department personnel procedures that were
designed more to deal with the evacuation of diplomats due to civil
wars than the subtle computer issues facing Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, the first step was taken when a special Y2K Committee
was formed, headed by the embassy's chief science officer. Drawing
on extensive discussions with Russian and Western experts, it
concluded that there was a ``negligible'' risk to American
personnel and distributed hundreds of copies of its assessment to
American employees here.
</P>
<P>
   But the embassy's Y2K Committee did not have the final word. It
reported to the embassy's Emergency Action Committee, which is made
up of senior diplomats and administrative personnel.
</P>
<P>
   The Emergency Action Committee had to confront the fact that
some of the staff were still very worried. So it sought to work out
a procedure that would allow the most anxious government employees
to return to the United States during the Jan. 1 period or, at
least, send their families there.
</P>
<P>
   But under State Department regulations on ``voluntary authorized
departure,'' it was not impossible to offer some diplomats a chance
to leave without making the proposal available to all American
government employees not required to be on duty on during the Jan.
1 period.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone who may leave is so fearful, embassy officials say.
Some may just be playing it safe while others may be looking for a
free trip back home. Those that leave for Washington will be
provided with free air fare, will be put up in hotels and given
daily living allowances.
</P>
<P>
   A further complication is that those that elect to leave must be
prepared to stay away for up to 30 days, in keeping with the State
Department regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The hope is that serious disruptions will not occur and that the
State Department will able to sound an all-clear by Jan. 6,
allowing many people to return several days later.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department procedures have produced some unwelcome
results for American diplomats here. Diplomats who were planning to
go to Western Europe, Southeast Asia or other foreign locations for
a brief break over the Christmas holidays will not be allowed to
return to Moscow until the State Department declares that the
computer danger has passed, confronting them with the possibility
of prolonged and costly foreign vacation.
</P>
<P>
   The regulations, a State Department official said, were designed
to keep as many people out of harm's way during a civil war or some
other type of crisis. Now, many diplomats here are forced to choose
to go without their foreign holiday, stay in Moscow or return to
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department has issued a travel advisory, warning
American citizens to avoid travel to Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and
Moldova during the Jan. 1 period. But its plan to assist the other
U.S. citizens in the Moscow region, numbering about 10,000, is less
clear.
</P>
<P>
   The American Embassy has advised Americans here to fill up their
bathtubs with water and make sure that they have manual, not just
electrical can openers.
</P>
<P>
   American citizens here are still awaiting the answer to some
riddles, like how they should contact the embassy for help if the
telephones do not work.

IN A WORLD OF CHIPS, A MAN FOR ALL MODEMS

<TEXT>
<P>
   The nation reacted with surprise upon learning late last month
that the Coca-Cola Co. has been testing a new kind of vending
machine that can be instructed to raise prices when the weather is
hot. But for companies like Eicon Technology, a Canadian maker of
wireless and cable modems that enable machines of all kinds to
follow orders, that was old news.
</P>
<P>
   Eicon paid just more than $6 million in January for a small
company called Trisignal that develops modems that can be worked
into an appliance's microprocessor, making it possible for a
machine in a remote location to respond to directives from someone
back at headquarters. For example, soft-drink vending machines
sitting in a patch of desert somewhere, or down at a mall, can be
reprogrammed or serviced based on reports they transmit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole idea is that now, any appliance can have
communications,'' said Gad Elmoznino, the director of Eicon's
Trisignal division, which he founded with a friend in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to start your air conditioner before you get home
from the airport, you have to have a modem in it,'' Elmoznino said.
Telephones, toasters and other household products could use the
technology before long, as well, he added. ``The next step is to
increase the size of the pipe. We will go to higher-speed
protocols,'' he said, referring to faster transmission formats that
can pump more information through a wire or cable.
</P>
<P>
   The modems operate most inexpensively on wired networks but can
also be used with wireless systems, Elmoznino said. They are
programmed onto existing microchips for the most part, and should a
problem develop, they do not disable the entire processor, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Brooks, an analyst with Aberdeen Group in Boston, said,
``The Trisignal acquisition really expands Eicon's reach from
computers into what I call device relationships.'' The devices
include the Casio Cassiopeia E-10, a hand-held organizer, and the
NEC Mobile Pro subnotebook.
</P>
<P>
   One of the major applications at the moment is the Sega
Dreamcast video-game console. About 2 million of the machines on
the market contain the Phantom embedded modem, developed by
Trisignal, Elmoznino said.
</P>
<P>
   The modem enables people to surf the Web on their television
screens, in addition to playing Sega Dreamcast games remotely with
other people.

   OFFICECLICK OFFERS AIDES A CLIQUE OF THEIR OWN
</P>
<P>
   Now that e-commerce companies are categorizing people every
conceivable way _ by sexual preference, foot size, lactose
intolerance _ and giving them a portal, it seems only right to
award a portal to administrative assistants.
</P>
<P>
   After all, administrative assistants _ a k a secretaries _
command about $200 billion in spending power in the workplace each
year. Executives of OfficeClick.com, a Web site that officially
opens Monday, say theirs is the first e-commerce site specifically
aimed at the estimated 10.5 million administrative assistants in
the United States, who procure goods on behalf of some 70 million
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``That $200 billion figure certainly spoke to us pretty
powerfully,'' said Jamie Rapperport, OfficeClick's chief executive.
By comparison, other markets that dominate the e-commerce headlines
_ music ($15 billion), books ($20 billion) and even apparel ($125
billion) _ seem almost anemic.
</P>
<P>
   The site is divided into three categories: one for buying office
supplies and gifts, booking travel and arranging for corporate
services; one for coordinating tasks; and one for gathering
information, with news and tips on researching purchases and
services.
</P>
<P>
   In the information category, the site supports a bulletin board
and calendar program that can be coordinated among several workers
in an office. A secretary, for instance, could post an updated
meeting schedule on the site, along with comments about the meeting
agenda, for workers to check privately. Or, the secretary could
schedule reminders for birthdays, ``then have a link to an online
cake vendor right next to it,'' Rapperport said.
</P>
<P>
   For research, the site offers access to corporate annual reports
through Hoover's Online and breaking business news from Reuters.
</P>
<P>
   Rapperport said OfficeClick would be free for users because it
earns money through advertising and revenue-sharing agreements with
vendors like Corporate Express, Staples and Office Depot.
</P>
<P>
   Some online diversions are also available on the site, in the
form of horoscopes and entertainment news, but notably, there are
no chat rooms. ``The whole idea,'' Rapperport said, ``is to make it
more work focused.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also a forum section where secretaries can post
questions and exchange tips about the best places to eat, the best
health plans or proven methods for publicly embarrassing a boss.

 &HT;    Suspect in fatal family shooting arrested

   ATLANTA _ An airport officer in Chattanooga, Tenn., had two
friendly chats with Kenneth Beamon before learning he was talking
to a suspected killer.
</P>
<P>
   Beamon is accused of killing an Atlanta woman and her two sons
Friday night. The cop's third talk with Beamon was brief and
one-sided.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're under arrest,'' Chattanooga Airport Police Officer
Richard Ansel said, handcuffing Beamon, 21.
</P>
<P>
   Ansel arrested Beamon at 12:10 a.m. Sunday. He also detained
Beamon's girlfriend, Shannon Sizemore, 19. The couple had planned
to spend the night inside the airport and catch a bus Sunday
morning at the nearby Greyhound Bus terminal, which was closed for
the night.
</P>
<P>
   Beamon was charged with the murders of Teresa Shoemaker, 32, and
her two sons, Lamar, 14, and Robert, 12, in their southeast Atlanta
home. Police say Beamon also shot Shoemaker's husband, Charles
Shoemaker, 34, who survived despite a gunshot wound to the head.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday evening, Atlanta homicide detectives planned to question
Sizemore, who has not been charged with a crime, said Atlanta
police Deputy Chief C.B. Jackson. Sizemore is Teresa Shoemaker's
niece. Police believe Sizemore had stayed with the Shoemakers
briefly.
</P>
<P>
   They want to ask her why Beamon would kill. They want to know
how. They want to know if anyone else was involved, since a gun and
a knife were used. They want to know what Beamon said as he fled to
Chattanooga with his girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have the answers soon enough,'' Jackson said. ``He will
have to answer for killing three people.''
</P>
<P>
   Teresa Shoemaker died of gunshot wounds to her head and chest,
said Al Boudy, a Fulton County Medical Examiner's Office
investigator. Lamar was shot in the chest. Robert was stabbed in
the heart.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Shoemaker was shot, then stabbed, said his uncle, Joe
McCollough.
</P>
<P>
   He said Shoemaker told him the gunman shot him in the head,
though it luckily was only a ``glancing blow'' that knocked him out
for a time.
</P>
<P>
   The shooter then apparently ran out of bullets and tried to
finish the job by stabbing Shoemaker with a knife three to four
times in the back and side, McCollough said. Shoemaker regained
consciousness and called 911.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Atlanta police obtained warrants for Beamon's arrest
and sent word to police agencies throughout the South.
</P>
<P>
   Ansel, the airport police officer, first spotted Beamon and
Sizemore as the pair were walking to the airport around 9:45 p.m.
Sunday. Neither had luggage. Sizemore carried a newspaper. Ansel
stopped and asked if they needed help.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, we're just going to the airport,'' he remembered Beamon
saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was courteous and friendly,'' Ansel said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, inside the airport's atrium, Ansel walked up to Sizemore,
who was standing alone. Again he asked if she needed help. She
seemed a little nervous. She said no and Beamon walked up.
</P>
<P>
   Ansel asked if they were waiting on a flight. No, they were
waiting on a bus, Beamon explained.
</P>
<P>
   The Greyhound station is only a half mile from the airport.
People occasionally stay in the airport overnight, waiting for the
bus station to open.
</P>
<P>
   Ansel told them where to buy snacks in the terminal, and the duo
headed that way.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly afterward, Ansel went into the police office where he
took a telephone call from a police dispatcher. The dispatcher
described a man and his girlfriend wanted in connection with the
Shoemaker slayings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just talking to them,'' Ansel said.
</P>
<P>
   Ansel called his sergeant, Simon Dean, and soon Beamon and
Sizemore were coming out of the terminal.
</P>
<P>
   Beamon was unarmed and did not struggle. He was booked into the
Hamilton County Jail in Chattanooga, where he awaits extradition to
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors on Sunday remembered the Shoemakers as people who
didn't cause any trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of her boys loved their bicycles. ... They were always on
their bikes,'' said Shirley Stegal, a family friend who lives
nearby on Hill Street. The Shoemakers ``mostly kept to themselves.
They were pretty nice people, though.''
</P>
<P>
   McCollough said the Shoemakers were looking to move out of the
neighborhood. McCollough said he last saw the family a month ago,
when he took them house hunting in Henry County.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to get into the country,'' he said. ``Where it
would be quieter.''

   BOEING-TAIL (Newport R.I) _ Hundreds of Boeing 767 airplanes
like EgyptAir plane that crashed off the Massachusetts coast,
killing all 217 people aboard, could be flying with improperly
torqued bolts that hold the vertical tail to the fuselage, the
Seattle Post-Intelligencer has learned. It is not yet clear if the
suspect bolts could be in planes built as far back as 1989, the
year the 767-300 that crashed was delivered to EgyptAir. Boeing
says the bolts aren't likely to pose a safety threat to airplanes
because of the big jet's redundant systems. But the company says it
is considering issuing a service bulletin warning operators of the
problem.

IN SILICON VALLEY, MICROSOFT FINDINGS BRING VINDICATION AND
ANXIETY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also MICROSOFT-CONSUMERS, MICROSOFT-STOCK) 
(mk) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF with STEVE LOHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ In Silicon Valley, the nation's
high-technology capital, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's powerful
findings in the Microsoft antitrust case have been received with a
sense of vindication but also ambivalence.
</P>
<P>
   In issuing his findings of fact on Friday evening, Jackson
delivered two implicit yet unmistakable messages to the industry.
Yes, he found, there is indeed a ``Microsoft problem'' in the
computer business, and the software monopolist's bullying tactics
hurt consumers and undermine innovation. He also found that there
is nothing special about the software industry: For purposes of
antitrust, he found, this high-tech world is not much different
from any bricks-and-mortar business.
</P>
<P>
   So any satisfaction that the judge shares the prevailing Silicon
Valley view of Microsoft is offset here by concern that his
document is a step toward greater government intervention in the
high-tech economy.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's findings are not a final ruling in the case, but
they will almost certainly serve as the framework for the outcome
of the case _ either in court or in an out-of-court settlement
between Microsoft Corp. and the government. In short, it seems
increasingly likely that there will be a solution that involves
mandated changes in Microsoft's corporate behavior, if not more
sweeping measures that, in theory, could include breaking up the
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``This document does change the landscape,'' said Jim Breyer,
managing partner for Accel Partners, a venture capital firm here.
</P>
<P>
   Much has changed in the computer business since the government
filed its sweeping antitrust suit against Microsoft in May 1998.
But industry executives here say the issues raised in the trial are
still of central importance to the nation's high-tech economy.
</P>
<P>
   It is true, they note, that most of the venture capital and
entrepreneurial effort in Silicon Valley these days is focused on
Internet startups. At these startups, the software and electronic
commerce services are built to work on the Internet's World Wide
Web rather than being bound to Microsoft's Windows operating
system. Such an evolution has become known as a ``post-PC era,''
which some experts say is beyond Microsoft's control as people
increasingly tap into the Web using everything from hand-held
devices to TV set-top boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the personal computer remains the primary avenue to the
Web _ and that promises to continue for years. And the federal
antitrust case focuses largely on how Microsoft allegedly used the
market power from its Windows monopoly to try to stifle the
challenge from Internet software.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Whether Microsoft can use its dominance in personal computing to
give it the upper hand in the Internet era, industry executives
say, will be an important policy issue for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people think we're in some post-PC era, but we're not _
and this issue really matters,'' said John Doerr, a partner in
Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers, a leading venture firm that has
backed Internet startups, companies aligned with Microsoft and some
of Microsoft's leading rivals, including Sun Microsystems and
America Online.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   There are aspects of Jackson's findings of fact that give people
here second thoughts. The judge's sweeping castigation of
Microsoft's business practices deals largely with how the company's
restrictive contracts thwarted personal computer makers, Internet
service providers and others from promoting, distributing or using
the products of rivals.
</P>
<P>
   But in his findings, Jackson made some fine-tuned judgments
about the software business. He found that the computer operating
system and Internet browsing software are separate products.
Microsoft, however, chose to fold its browsing software into
Windows _ and in a separate but related case, a federal appeals
court said Microsoft was free to do that as long as it could make
``any plausible claim'' of business efficiency or consumer benefit
from doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson went further. He found that by putting its browser in
the operating system Microsoft made Windows 98 unnecessarily buggy.
That product decision, he wrote, ``unjustifiably jeopardized the
stability and security of the operating system.''
</P>
<P>
   Just what does and does not belong in a computer operating
system can make for fascinating and impassioned debate among
software programmers. But having a federal court or the government
second guess such decisions is something that makes many industry
executives and experts leery, even those who are critical of
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone in the industry is uncomfortable with the chokehold
that Microsoft has,'' said Hal Varian, dean of the school of
information management and systems at the University of California
at Berkeley. ``But they are also uncomfortable with having the
government get involved in software design decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Some suggest that while the post-PC era is still not here, its
arrival is imminent and will bring an inevitable decline in
Microsoft's authority. ``The reality is that Microsoft today is
very much a niche player in the non-desktop market,'' said Greg
Galanos, a software strategist in the office of the president at
Motorola Corp.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, industry executives are not shy about offering
solutions for curbing Microsoft's power, and have done so since
before the suit was filed. They run the gamut from restricting
Microsoft to writing restrictive contracts to forcing it to publish
its software protocols to breaking up the company.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all the proposed solutions are highly problematic.
Breaking up the company by separating the Windows operating system
business from Microsoft's Office productivity programs, for
example, runs the risk of merely creating two monopolies instead of
one. Microsoft's market share in productivity programs like word
processing, spreadsheets and presentation software is even higher
than its share of the operating system market.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Mandating that Microsoft openly publish the underlying
``source'' code for Windows _ another sweeping sanction mentioned _
runs the risk of reducing Microsoft's incentives to innovate
because other software companies, at no cost, would get the
technology Microsoft had invested to build.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fundamental challenge for the government and the courts is
to come up with a set of remedies that really do help consumers
instead of doing more harm than good,'' said David Yoffie, a
professor at the Harvard business school.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many industry executives agree on what the policy goal
should be in dealing with Microsoft: keeping the basic technology
standards an open, public resource in the Internet era. Common
technology standards have been catalysts for the growth of
industries for centuries. In the 19th century, for example, the
national railway system could not develop until there was agreement
on a common track width and gauge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The personal computer industry has benefited greatly by the
establishment of technology standards, but they happen to be owned
by Microsoft,'' observed Richard Shaffer, principal of Technologic
Partners, a consulting firm. ``And for the Internet and electronic
commerce to flourish, we need standards for security, payment and
software protocols. But the objective has to be that nobody _ no
single company _ becomes the next Microsoft in this new world.''
</P>
<P>
   Esther Dyson, editor of Release 1.0, an industry newsletter,
added: ``From a policy standpoint, what you want to do is create an
environment of dynamic instability where everyone, including
Microsoft, has to innovate constantly to move forward without
getting the government deeply involved. You don't want Microsoft
controlling the industry, but you don't want the government
controlling it, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's top executives cringe at the suggestion that they
control the key technology or the pace of innovation in computing _
in the PC era or any other.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no control,'' said Steven Ballmer, the president of
Microsoft. ``If customers don't want to upgrade to the next version
of Windows, they don't have to. And if anybody wants to innovate on
top of us or alongside us, they can.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Ballmer said that the rise of new technologies
like Web-based software and the Linux operating system represented
a ``cataclysmic change'' in the software business. ``We have no
guaranteed position in this new Internet era,'' he said. ``To me,
it sure doesn't feel like we control things.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   More and more, Microsoft's challengers hope that Ballmer proves
to be correct. In his findings of fact, Jackson found that
Microsoft's grip on the industry would not be loosened anytime soon
by Linux or another rival operating system, the BeOS. The judge
called both ``fringe'' technologies and found that neither posed a
challenge to Windows in the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loathe Microsoft and there's no question it's a monopoly,''
said Eric Raymond, a programmer, author and Linux evangelist. ``But
I think Judge Jackson underestimated the competitive threat that
Linux presents.''
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Louis Gassee, founder of Be Inc., maker of the operating
system BeOS, said he founded his company because he felt
Microsoft's grip on the industry was loosening. The Microsoft suit
and the rise of Linux, he said, ``made it possible to consider a
fringe operating system'' _ and, he added, to consider the
possibility that it could make inroads against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   After the judge's findings of fact, he says, his chances could
improve. ``It's a staggering document,'' he said.

VIOLENCE IN A CITY JAIL IS CUT BY 90 PERCENT

 By CHRISTOPHER DREW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Just five years after city officials braced for riots
on Rikers Island, where inmates were routinely slitting each other
with razors, gangs were a menace and guards brawled with inmates in
a perpetual fight for control, violence inside the sprawling
complex of city jails has been brought to extraordinary lows.
</P>
<P>
   Using an array of tools and tactics _ from a huge SWAT team to
electric stun shields to a program that aggressively prosecutes
inmates for crimes committed inside the jails _ correction
officials have cut slashings and stabbings among inmates by over 90
percent. Stabbing assaults by inmates have plummeted from nearly
1,100 in 1994 to 78 so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   This aggressive effort has radically changed the climate inside
jails that were notoriously chaotic and brutal, and where both
inmates and guards feared for their safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, it's a different ballgame,'' Bernard Kerik, the
commissioner of correction, said. ``I tell you, if somebody had
told my officers five years ago we'd ever get the violence down
this low, they would have laughed in your face.''
</P>
<P>
   The changes have not come without concerns. Some inmates and
their legal advocates view the new tactics, particularly the use of
pepper gas and stun devices to subdue inmates, with alarm. They say
there already have been several cases of dangerous abuse, and they
contend that jail officials have been weak in disciplining the
guards.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that it is easier to control the
inmates,'' said Jonathan Chasan, a lawyer for the Prisoners' Rights
Project at the Legal Aid Society. But, he added, ``Whenever you
impose a system of restraint on this scale, it can easily be
abused.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, based on interviews with guards, inmates and lawyers for
some of the 17,000 people who at any moment are awaiting trial on
Rikers or in other detention houses, there is a general perception
that the jails have been made safer and more manageable.
</P>
<P>
   To both supporters and critics of the crackdown, the effort at
Rikers is a case of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's administration
enforcing its zero-tolerance approach to crime in its rawest form,
and correction officials from Maryland, Florida and Connecticut
have examined the Rikers experience as a kind of model.
</P>
<P>
   The sense of safety taking hold at Rikers has been achieved
through an ambitious, unapologetic program using everything from
high-tech weaponry to common sense.
</P>
<P>
   The stun devices _ large plexiglass shields threaded with wires
_ deliver six-second bursts of 50,000 volts of electricity and are
used to incapacitate inmates and cut the risk of hand-to-hand
violence. The devices, which crackle and spark when held against an
inmate, have been used 74 times, or about once a week, since they
were first deployed a year and a half ago. Mace or pepper spray has
been used 1,500 times over the last three and a half years.
</P>
<P>
   While controversial, both gas and stun devices are increasingly
being used in jails and prisons around the United States, and New
York City health officials have approved their use against inmates
who are generally healthy. Kerik, 44, a hard-edged former
policeman, said he remained willing to try anything else that
seemed likely to cut the violence further.
</P>
<P>
   That attitude, some visitors say, has led to changes that have
replaced a perpetually violent atmosphere in some cell blocks with
an almost eerie ``Twilight Zone'' calm.
</P>
<P>
   At Kerik's suggestion, inmates who have slashed others now walk
around with their hands clamped inside foot-long protective tubes,
known as ``the mitts.'' During cell-block raids, guards often bring
in chairs with magnetic sensors that can search for bits of metal
hidden in inmates' mouths and other body cavities.
</P>
<P>
   Another crucial change has been the creation of a jail
intelligence unit, which has disrupted the gangs and increased
arrests of inmates.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, most people who punched a guard or were caught with
weapons were simply shifted to a disciplinary ward. But over the
last two years, more than 1,800 inmates have been arrested and
charged with new crimes for violent acts and jail infractions.
</P>
<P>
   Inmates themselves say the threat of additional jail time has
become a powerful deterrent.
</P>
<P>
   Rodney Morris was held on Rikers for two years before being
acquitted last month on murder charges. He also had been there
before, in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back then,'' he said, ``it was more of a convict jail, where
people were getting cut more and robbed more.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ``that's not happening now, because basically the
brothers know that if I cut somebody, I will get arrested. And one
thing the brothers are not trying to do is get more jail time.''

</P>
<P>
   At Rikers in the early 1980s, emergency alarms often signaled
serious confrontations with inmates 10 times a day.
</P>
<P>
   Rikers has also been more difficult to control than most jails
and prisons. Unlike the convicts in federal and state custody, most
inmates in the city's jails are detainees, legally innocent and
awaiting trial, and more than 125,000 men and women cycle through
each year. Many also are habitual criminals or drug abusers and are
prone to lash out.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of officers and inmates were hurt in riots in the late
1980s and in 1990. But just as corrosive were the dozens of daily
conflicts over simple complaints about food or recreation time, any
of which could quickly turn violent or touch off a melee in a cell
block. As the jails began to fill with members of gangs like the
Latin Kings and the Bloods, the violence got even more brutal.
</P>
<P>
   Inmates were well armed, with metal yanked from mops and
radiators, plexiglass from light fixtures and bits of razor blades
melted into the handles of toothbrushes. Some thought nothing of
throwing urine or feces on guards or reaching out to slash officers
as they walked by.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Correction Department was reeling, its
ranks thinning from a freeze on hiring in the early 1990s and its
leadership overwhelmed. Wardens took to shuffling the worst inmates
back and forth to one another's jails under the guise of relieving
overcrowding. Some of the guards took it upon themselves to restore
order.
</P>
<P>
   Records from lawsuits show that when inmates were sent to the
disciplinary ward, they often received ``greeting beatings.'' At
other times, jail supervisors ordered assaults on antagonistic
inmates. Serious head injuries, bone fractures and perforated
eardrums were common.
</P>
<P>
   And when Giuliani began to trim drug treatment services in late
1994, riots seemed possible, prompting city officials to finally
try to change the vicious dynamics on the island.
</P>
<P>
   As a first step, Giuliani replaced the leadership of the
Correction Department. A former city budget official, Michael
Jacobson, became the commissioner, and Kerik got the No. 2 job,
overseeing day-to-day operations.
</P>
<P>
   Kerik, a blunt, irrepressible man, had once been a
$52,000-a-year jail warden in Passaic County, N.J. But when he got
a chance to fulfill a lifelong dream, and become a New York City
policeman, he grabbed it, even though it meant a cut in pay to
$25,000.
</P>
<P>
   During eight years with the Police Department, Kerik won 30
medals, including the Medal of Valor for a shootout in which he
wounded a drug dealer who had shot and wounded Kerik's partner. He
also grew a ponytail and wore five diamond earrings while pursuing
members of the Cali drug cartel as an undercover operative.
</P>
<P>
   To Kerik, fixing the crisis in the jails simply called for the
same kind of street smarts. ``People at first thought I was
crazy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Jacobson also was willing to experiment. And what emerged
was an unusual patchwork of changes, some off-the-cuff and others
tested at length, all meant to limit the chances for violence.
</P>
<P>
   One of Kerik's first ideas was to start handcuffing inmates
behind their backs rather than with their hands in front. He was
upset that some had hidden razor blades in their mouths, retrieving
them with their cuffed hands to attack inmates and guards.
</P>
<P>
   Later, after he read about the protective tubes in a trade
magazine, he ordered their use over the handcuffs to immobilize the
most dangerous inmates whenever they left their cells.
</P>
<P>
   Other simple changes included a ban on sneakers with air
cushions, because inmates were hiding razor blades in them. Even
the size of the food-tray openings on some cells has been trimmed,
to stop inmates from swiping at passing guards.
</P>
<P>
   Kerik, who became the commissioner in early 1998 after Jacobson
resigned, said jail officials also had to show the inmates they
were no longer afraid of them _ and that they had the tools to
clamp down without resorting to their fists.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the department has spent $13 million to increase security.
It has created a 111-member SWAT team to halt major riots and a
Gang Intelligence Unit to monitor the roughly 2,000 gang members
who are in the jails at any time. And it turned to the gas and the
stun shields.
</P>
<P>
   Jail supervisors and some guards carry canisters of gas _ at
first it was mace, now it is pepper spray _ on their belts. The
department also bought 90 stun shields for $545 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Both the shields and the spray are mainly used when teams go
into a cell to subdue inmates who have misbehaved or who refuse to
step out during a search _ a type of confrontation that has often
led to injuries among inmates and guards.
</P>
<P>
   Jail officials said that just the threat of the devices was
often enough to persuade inmates to comply. But if an inmate starts
to fight, Kerik said, one officer can spray the gas or ram the
shield into the inmate, disorienting him while the other guards put
on handcuffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has really prevented a lot of injuries,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To inmate advocates and other critics, some of the changes at
Rikers are justified, but others seem overzealous. Some inmates and
their lawyers are concerned that over the past two years, more than
700 of the 1,800 arrests of inmates have been for assaulting
guards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a number of the arrests are questionable,'' said John
Boston, the director of the Prisoners' Rights Project at the Legal
Aid Society. He said it was easy for guards to cover up their own
brutal actions by pressing for assault charges against inmates who
fight back.
</P>
<P>
   But in pushing ahead with the new techniques, jail officials
have the support of the city Board of Correction, even though the
board chairman, John Horan, said he was ``not crazy'' about the
stun guns.
</P>
<P>
   But the guards, to be sure, are grateful for the extra
firepower.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Maynard, a correction officer, said: ``It shows we're in
charge.''

MANY CONSUMERS DON'T AGREE WITH JUDGE'S FINDING AGAINST MICROSOFT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Calif., Colo.) (rk) 
 By AMY HARMON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As the Justice Department and some in the technology
industry celebrated a federal judge's finding that Microsoft &UR;  &LR; had
hurt consumers by abusing its Windows monopoly, Bob Mirell was
browsing the software aisles at CompUSA in midtown Manhattan
feeling decidedly unwounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why knock down a company that has a superior product?'' asked
Mirell, 52, who uses Microsoft's software at home and in his
printing business. ``If they've cornered the market, that's because
they're better.''
</P>
<P>
   Mirell and his 8-year-old daughter, Jacqueline, were among many
software users interviewed around the country over the weekend who
voiced some apprehension, even downright distress, at the notion
that Microsoft would be punished for what Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson deemed its direct and indirect harm to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's already hard enough getting everything to work
together,'' said Simon Smith, a department store salesman from
Queens. ``Maybe Microsoft set it up that way, but breaking up the
company would just make it worse.''
</P>
<P>
   In its 18-month antitrust battle against Microsoft, the
government introduced mountains of e-mail, documents and testimony
from business partners and competitors to show that the company had
a monopoly in computer operating systems and that it had illegally
leveraged that position to muscle its way into new markets.
</P>
<P>
   But proving that the software giant's tactics had resulted in
harm to consumers often seemed the fuzziest part of the case. Many
software users see one of the government's key complaints _
Microsoft's inclusion of a Web browser with Windows _ as a boon.
And unlike the century's first landmark antitrust trial, which
resulted in the breakup of Standard Oil, the government's case
against Microsoft was not fueled by a public outraged over rising
prices.
</P>
<P>
   That may be in part because a relatively tiny portion of the
consuming public were Standard Oil shareholders in 1911. In 1999,
Microsoft is one of the nation's most widely held stocks, and for
many investors, the impact Jackson's findings could have on their
portfolio was of more concern than some nebulous notion of fair
business practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to get too dramatic here, but I think it's a
miscarriage of justice,'' said Chris Bauer, 30, a programming
consultant from Dorchester, Mass., who was shopping at Microcenter
in Cambridge, Mass. Bauer, whose Microsoft stock has appreciated
considerably in recent months, added, ``The computer business is
such that there's always going to be competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was unequivocal in his findings, stating that Microsoft
had created ``confusion and frustration for consumers'' by ensuring
that its own Web browser would be continuously activate in Windows
98 even when a consumer was running a competing browser. The judge
also found that Microsoft was harming consumers ``indirectly by
unjustifiably distorting competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of people agreed with the judge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fabulous,'' said John Rockfellow, the director of the
Cancer Foundation in San Francisco, who was shopping on Saturday
for video games for his children at Good Guys, an electronics
store. He said he thought one result would be more competition
among operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   In Manhattan, Patrice Booker, 30, said she was glad to know that
the government might put controls on Microsoft, even though she
thought Microsoft's chairman, Bill Gates was a genius.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if I wanted to get into the computer business?'' wondered
Ms. Booker, who teaches English in Japan. ``If you limit the
ability for people to compete, it's no good for anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Macintosh users took particular relish in the judge's findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am so glad they finally got what's coming to them,'' said
Matt Fuller, 26, an Apple Macintosh devotee in Manhattan who said
he was forced to switch to a Windows-based machine two years ago
because the software he needed was not available on the Mac. ``It's
about time.''
</P>
<P>
   But a large contingent of those interviewed took a more
philosophical approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft probably does have a monopoly, but I'm not going to
lose any sleep over it,'' said Mike Johnson, a federal government
employee who was shopping at Circuit City in Denver on Saturday
evening. ``I'm skeptical that the government's accomplishing
anything by doing this.''
</P>
<P>
   And Dan Chapman, a bond trader in Manhattan, figured he'd make
money on the situation no matter what. ``I don't care if they go up
or down,'' said Chapman, who said he planned to buy Microsoft stock
if it went down as expected on Monday. ``I also own some of their
competitors, like America Online, so either way it will work out.''

WARNER-LAMBERT'S CHIEF DEFENDS DECISION TO IGNORE PFIZER'S BID 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The chief executive of the Warner-Lambert Co. described the drug
maker's rationale Sunday for proceeding with its proposed $72
billion merger with the American Home Products Corp. and spurning a
hostile, though more lucrative, overture by Pfizer Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Warner-Lambert, which is headed by Lodewijk J.R. de Vink, agreed
to a $72 billion merger with American Home Products last Thursday.
But within hours of announcing that deal, Pfizer, the maker of
Viagra and other drugs, began its own $80 billion hostile bid, an
uncharacteristic move that rocked the usually genteel
pharmaceutical industry and was rebuffed by Warner-Lambert.
</P>
<P>
   De Vink said in an interview from his office Sunday that even
after meeting with William C. Steere, Pfizer's chairman and chief
executive, almost two weeks ago, Pfizer has stopped short of a real
offer.
</P>
<P>
   De Vink confirmed that he received a letter on Oct. 25 from
Steere regarding speculation that Warner-Lambert was considering a
combination with another partner and that Steere was interested in
talking. Steere was right: Since July, Warner-Lambert and American
Home executives had been discussing a merger.
</P>
<P>
   But before that letter, de Vink said, he had no indication that
Pfizer was interested in anything other than the agreement the two
companies had to develop and market Warner-Lambert's cholesterol
treatment, Lipitor. ``There was never an expression to do more than
expand the marketing agreement,'' said de Vink.
</P>
<P>
   During the next two days, de Vink said, he met with his
investment bankers at Bear, Stearns &AMP; Co. and his board, which
recommended that he meet with Steere and ``find out what's on his
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   At an Oct. 27 meeting in Steere's offices at Pfizer's
headquarters in New York, de Vink said, the conversation was vague
and the two discussed several issues, including what role Warner's
management team would have in a combined company, what the makeup
of the board would be, how a combination would affect shareholders
and what the synergies between the two companies were.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not my question, `What's in it for me?''' de Vink said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that Steere told him he had not discussed the
combination with his board and asked whether the two men could talk
at later date because ``he was busy with another transaction.'' De
Vink would not say what company was involved, but industry
executives said Pfizer was trying to negotiate a merger with the
Monsanto Co. De Vink told Steere that a later meeting would be too
late.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week, Steere declined to discuss his talks
with de Vink. Sunday, Steere was traveling and could not be reached
for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, on Oct. 28, de Vink said the board of
Warner-Lambert met and he apprised it of his meeting with Steere.
``It was no specific offer,'' de Vink said, regarding the overture
from Pfizer. ``It was nothing more than a letter.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he called Steere and told him Warner-Lambert was not
interested, in part because of the ``size differential and the fit
is not in the best interest'' of the company or its shareholders.
He also said Steere wished him good luck.
</P>
<P>
   For almost a year, Warner-Lambert has examined its strategic
options for the business going forward, de Vink said, and hired
consultants from McKinsey &AMP; Co. to explore alternatives. The merger
with American Home, de Vink said, ``is for us a deal based on
strategy.'' Further, ``I kept the board informed on every word with
Pfizer.''
</P>
<P>
   But despite de Vink's explanation _ and despite the initial
applause from analysts concerning the combination _ if
Warner-Lambert shareholders were to vote for an merger with
American Home today, the most likely answer would be no. As of
Friday's market close, Pfizer's offer was higher, valued at $86.875
a share for Warner stockholders, despite the stock tumbling 6.7
percent. American Home's proposed offer was worth $81.95 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are expecting Pfizer to sweeten its offer, either in
more stock or some kind of price protection to offset any decline
in their share price.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pfizer has to win,'' Thomas McKillop, chief executive of
Astra-Zeneca, a rival European drug company, said in an interview
in his London office Sunday. ``If you put in a bid, you have to be
prepared to see it through.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, de Vink lamented the recent turn of events.
Warner-Lambert executives are reviewing their Lipitor agreement
with Pfizer. ``We didn't start this mudslinging thing, and I
wouldn't want it to come to that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The company also plans to meet with its investors next week.
</P>
<P>
   And the days ahead may be even more interesting that the last
few. In response to de Vink's review of his meetings with Steere, a
Pfizer spokeswoman said this: ``None of this is relevant to what
we're trying to accomplish.''

IN SEATTLE, FATE OF THE `GOLDEN GOOSE' WEIGHS HEAVY
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Three of the world's richest men, their wealth derived
from Microsoft, live in the Seattle area. The company's market
valuation alone is nearly half a trillion dollars, and its presence
is a huge reason that 2,500 other high-technology companies are
congregated here.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those start-ups are near Microsoft on the east side of
Lake Washington, and many were started by Microsoft alumni. Their
combined market value is roughly another half-trillion dollars,
according to a recent study by the Eastside Economic Council, a
business and civic group.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, in short, has transformed Seattle, almost
single-handedly saving the region from a recession a few years ago
during a downturn at the city's largest employer, Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Microsoft has fueled an extraordinary boom here
that is the subject of heated local debate. Some Seattleites
celebrate the growth, while others complain it is turning a once
unassuming, comfortable town into a glitzy, traffic-clogged mess.
</P>
<P>
   But now, after a withering denunciation of the region's Golden
Goose by a federal judge, people here are debating a different
question: What will this mean for the region?
</P>
<P>
   Not much, many insist. They note that the company's stock price
was $43 on the day the government filed its case in May 1998 and
has more than doubled since then.
</P>
<P>
   Only good things, say others. They invoke the famous advice
offered by John D. Rockefeller when he heard his oil monopoly was
being broken up by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1911: Buy Standard
Oil. The magnate rightly predicted the stock would be worth far
more divided into a bunch of new companies.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the doomsday, turn-out-the-lights scenarios.
An article in The Seattle Post-Intelligencer on Saturday, the day
after the judge's finding was issued, even carried a line of
speculation that the software giant might desert its woodsy Redmond
campus and hightail it for the Cayman Islands, beyond the reach of
U.S. antitrust laws. (``Unlikely but not impossible,'' the
newspaper said.)
</P>
<P>
   No one knows, of course, what will happen in the end. And for
now, even as many local leaders decry the judge's finding as an
unfair attack on the hometown team, there is no discernible sense
of panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main reaction I've noticed is that it's kind of exciting
as a news event, but people don't seem to see dire outcomes down
the road,'' said Fred Moody, managing editor of the Seattle Weekly
and author of a 1995 book, ``I Sing the Body Electronic: A Year
With Microsoft on the Multimedia Frontier.'' ``The attitude clearly
is, there's a long way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge's findings that Microsoft unfairly uses its monopoly
power to bully and thwart competition has also touched an
ambivalent chord here in Seattle about Bill Gates, the company's
co-founder and chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gates himself personifies the company, and there are a lot of
mixed feelings,'' Moody said. ``He is obviously a local kid who
made good. It's a lot of fun to see a Seattle person taking on the
world, being defiant and refusing to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he added, people in Seattle have the same
aversions that anyone else does to someone who is too rich and too
powerful. Besides, he said, ``A lot of people equate Microsoft with
the personal computer, and just because computers can be so
frustrating, they think it's all Microsoft's fault.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Dabek, a co-owner of Re-PC, a Seattle store and Web site
that sells recycled computers and peripherals, said he generally
admired Microsoft and believed that the company wasn't getting
enough credit from the judge or the government for sparking
innovation in the high-technology industry and for providing good
standards for software.
</P>
<P>
   But, having said that, he added that many of his customers were
reacting with glee to the government's gains in the antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   ``They feel as though Microsoft has literally led them down a
path they don't necessarily want to go down,'' Dabek said. ``They
don't like the Windows operating system, but they feel they have to
go along with it because everybody uses it.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft and the high-technology industry have created tens of
thousands of new jobs here. Microsoft alone employs about 17,500
people in the region and says it is looking for about 2,000 more.
And while the ``packaged software'' industry, which excludes
Internet ventures, employs only about one-fourth the numbers
employed by Boeing and the rest of the aerospace industry here, it
generates more wages, roughly $6.8 billion compared with $5.5
billion, according to a 1998 study by the state's Employment
Security Department.
</P>
<P>
   Those gains have created tensions of their own, as the image of
a blue-collar Seattle where anyone could make a good living and no
one's wealth was on ostentatious display has been replaced by
dot-com millionaires with hugely expensive homes and cars.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the main, state and local leaders here jumped to Microsoft's
defense within hours of the release of the findings of U.S.
District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Both U.S. senators and Gov. Gary Locke issued statements that
supported the company and criticized the judge.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jennifer Dunn, a Republican congresswoman who represents
the Eastside communities where so many technology companies are
located, said she was ``fearful of government attempts to regulate
this dynamic and competitive industry.'' And the state's chief
economist, Chang Mook Sohn, told reporters that ``anything that
hurts Microsoft hurts the state's economy _ no question about
that.''
</P>
<P>
   But others question whether the antitrust action really will
hurt Microsoft in the end, even if the outcome is a Draconian
remedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the company breaks up some day, that's not automatically
bad,'' said Dick Conway, co-publisher of the Puget Sound Economic
Forecaster, a quarterly newsletter. ``That was certainly the case
with AT&AMP;T, that the parts were greater than the whole, and that
certainly is conceivable here.''
</P>
<P>
   Conway made clear that he was not predicting a break-up.
</P>
<P>
   But the Standard Oil and AT&AMP;T cases differ from the Microsoft
matter in a way that is significant to Seattle. In the former
cases, there were clear geographical divisions that could be carved
out of the corporate empire. In Microsoft's case, such divisions
would seem meaningless, given the ubiquity of computer software.
</P>
<P>
   So one important local question if a break-up were ever ordered
would be how many of the divided parts of the software giant would
remain headquartered here.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, a great deal of the economic activity
Microsoft has generated here is taking place outside the company
campus anyway. Microsoft AlumNet, a 3,000-member group that
supports the business and philanthropic activities of company
alumni, says that more than a third of those members have started
their own technology companies or consulting practices here, or
hold top positions in other start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Companies like RealNetworks and Onyx Software are full of
Microsoft alumni. What's more, many analysts say the real growth
here is in Internet companies like Amazon.com, InfoSpace.com,
Go2Net and dozens of others.
</P>
<P>
   News of Jackson's findings late Friday capped a long, tense week
in Seattle. A crash of a Boeing plane, like Egyptair's Boeing 767,
is always a big story here. Political leaders wrung their hands
over passage of a statewide anti-tax measure that threatened stark
budget problems. And an office shooting left two people dead and a
killer at large.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of an unusual week for Seattle,'' said Conway, the
economist. ``No matter how the world might view Seattle as one of
these great livable places, we've got a lot of problems, too, and a
lot of those problems are beyond our control. For a city that
generates a lot of happy stories, this is the week that brings us
down to reality.''

YANKEE GROUP FOUNDER STEPPING DOWN FOR NEW VENTURE

   There are a lot of people out there trying to make a living as
experts and consultants in the technology and communications
businesses. Almost all of them owe something to Howard Anderson,
who practically invented the technology consulting industry when he
founded Yankee Group Research Inc. in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   And now, even Yankee's competitors have a new reason to thank
Anderson: He is leaving. Almost three decades after issuing his
first research report, ``The Unbundling of AT&AMP;T,'' in 1971,
Anderson said on Friday that he would step down from day-to-day
responsibilities at Yankee, based in Boston, to start a new venture
capital operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel terrific,'' said Anderson, 55, in an interview. ``We've
grown internally and I'm going to be here to help. Helping mentor
the next generation is great fun, and we're bringing in some
terrific talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Berge Ayvazian, 46, is the new chief executive. Ayvazian has
been with the firm for 14 years and was previously Yankee's chief
operating officer. Anderson will remain Yankee's chairman.
</P>
<P>
   From a financial perspective, Anderson deployed his exit
strategy three years ago, when he sold Yankee, of which he was the
sole shareholder, to Primark Corp. for $34 million. Anderson
received additional payments from Primark of about $20 million when
Yankee met certain growth targets.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's new venture, to be called Yankeetek, is putting
together a $50 million fund to invest in start-up companies
focused, naturally, on the Internet and communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every hot VC in Boston wants to invest,'' Anderson said on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   This is Anderson's second incarnation as a venture capitalist.
In 1983, he was one of three co-founders of Battery Ventures, which
earlier this year closed its fifth main fund, with a value of $440
million.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson holds the title of special partner at Battery, which
has maintained an affiliation with Yankee since its inception.
Among the companies Battery has invested in are Akamai, Fore
Systems and Infoseek.
</P>
<P>
   Both Battery and Yankee have agreed to invest in Yankeetek,
Anderson said, and Yankeetek will fit into the family of
enterprises by helping identify investment opportunities in very
small companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Battery does companies where the unit has product, it has
sales, it may or may not have earnings,'' Anderson said. But
Yankeetek, he said, will look only at start-up companies.

 By AMY HARMON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As the Justice Department and some in the technology
industry celebrated a federal judge's finding that Microsoft had
hurt consumers by abusing its Windows monopoly, Bob Mirell was
browsing the software aisles at CompUSA in midtown Manhattan
feeling decidedly unwounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why knock down a company that has a superior product?'' asked
Mirell, 52, who uses Microsoft's software at home and in his
printing business. ``If they've cornered the market, that's because
they're better.''
</P>
<P>
   Mirell and his 8-year-old daughter, Jacqueline, were among many
software users interviewed around the country over the weekend who
voiced some apprehension, even downright distress, at the notion
that Microsoft would be punished for what Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson deemed its direct and indirect harm to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's already hard enough getting everything to work
together,'' said Simon Smith, a department store salesman from
Queens. ``Maybe Microsoft set it up that way, but breaking up the
company would just make it worse.''
</P>
<P>
   In its 18-month antitrust battle against Microsoft, the
government introduced mountains of e-mail, documents and testimony
from business partners and competitors to show that the company had
a monopoly in computer operating systems and that it had illegally
leveraged that position to muscle its way into new markets.
</P>
<P>
   But proving that the software giant's tactics had resulted in
harm to consumers often seemed the fuzziest part of the case. Many
software users see one of the government's key complaints _
Microsoft's inclusion of a Web browser with Windows _ as a boon.
And unlike the century's first landmark antitrust trial, which
resulted in the breakup of Standard Oil, the government's case
against Microsoft was not fueled by a public outraged over rising
prices.
</P>
<P>
   That may be in part because a relatively tiny portion of the
consuming public were Standard Oil shareholders in 1911. In 1999,
Microsoft is one of the nation's most widely held stocks, and for
many investors, the impact Jackson's findings could have on their
portfolio was of more concern than some nebulous notion of fair
business practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to get too dramatic here, but I think it's a
miscarriage of justice,'' said Chris Bauer, 30, a programming
consultant from Dorchester, Mass., who was shopping at Microcenter
in Cambridge, Mass. Bauer, whose Microsoft stock has appreciated
considerably in recent months, added, ``The computer business is
such that there's always going to be competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was unequivocal in his findings, stating that Microsoft
had created ``confusion and frustration for consumers'' by ensuring
that its own Web browser would be continuously activate in Windows
98 even when a consumer was running a competing browser. The judge
also found that Microsoft was harming consumers ``indirectly by
unjustifiably distorting competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of people agreed with the judge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fabulous,'' said John Rockfellow, the director of the
Cancer Foundation in San Francisco, who was shopping on Saturday
for video games for his children at Good Guys, an electronics
store. He said he thought one result would be more competition
among operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   In Manhattan, Patrice Booker, 30, said she was glad to know that
the government might put controls on Microsoft, even though she
thought Microsoft's chairman, Bill Gates was a genius.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if I wanted to get into the computer business?'' wondered
Ms. Booker, who teaches English in Japan. ``If you limit the
ability for people to compete, it's no good for anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Macintosh users took particular relish in the judge's findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am so glad they finally got what's coming to them,'' said
Matt Fuller, 26, an Apple Macintosh devotee in Manhattan who said
he was forced to switch to a Windows-based machine two years ago
because the software he needed was not available on the Mac. ``It's
about time.''
</P>
<P>
   But a large contingent of those interviewed took a more
philosophical approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft probably does have a monopoly, but I'm not going to
lose any sleep over it,'' said Mike Johnson, a federal government
employee who was shopping at Circuit City in Denver on Saturday
evening. ``I'm skeptical that the government's accomplishing
anything by doing this.''
</P>
<P>
   And Dan Chapman, a bond trader in Manhattan, figured he'd make
money on the situation no matter what. ``I don't care if they go up
or down,'' said Chapman, who said he planned to buy Microsoft stock
if it went down as expected on Monday. ``I also own some of their
competitors, like America Online, so either way it will work out.''

SIDEWAYS GLANCE: WHAT'S AN AUTHOGRAPH WORTH TO YA?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   About 20 years ago, when Jim Lampley was just starting his
professional broadcasting career, ABC had him running around as a
reporter with Billie Jean King and O.J. Simpson for coverage of
``The Superstars'' competition from Rotunda, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The local autograph seekers recognized King and Simpson and kept
shoving pieces of paper under their noses. But Lampley?
</P>
<P>
   ``I could tell they didn't know who I was,'' said Lampley, ``and
every time I signed an autograph, they wouldn't even look at it,
and then move to the next celebrity.''
</P>
<P>
   So as an experiment, every time Lampley was given something to
autograph, he signed it ``O.J. Simpson.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I must have signed more than 100 of them,'' Lampley said.
``True story.''
</P>
<P>
   As long as he didn't leave fingerprints, he should be OK. But as
long as we're on the subject of autograph etiquette, it leads into
our latest ``What Would Jim Lampley Do?'' question:
</P>
<P>
   __ Situation: As you are leaving a restaurant with your family,
you spot a famous athlete sitting at a table across the way.
Although it seems he's there to have dinner, his food hasn't
arrived, and he's talking with others at his table. Is this a good
time to approach this person for an autograph or even for a
handshake?
</P>
<P>
   __ What Jim Lampley would do: ``I've been on both ends of this
situation. And as a rule, I never approach the person unless I'm
absolutely certain they know who I am. As a stranger, I wouldn't do
it. But then, I'm not exactly starving for the opportunity to meet
famous people.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a style and art and delicacy and sensitivity to
approaching someone you don't know. For me, there are situations
where I could be changing my baby's diaper or trying to buy an
airline ticket, and if someone approaches it the right way, then
it's a pleasure to meet them. But most people don't have that
subtlety to pull off something like that. A lot don't know how to
pull anything off, even if they're at a crowded arena, without
being offensive. I mean, on a plane once, I had someone reach
across me to jostle Bruce Jenner to wake him up to get an
autograph. That's an extreme.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand why people want autographs anyway. Wouldn't
it mean more to shake someone's hand and look them in the eye and
say something nice? The people who get the nerve up to ask to have
a picture taken with you have somehow developed the politeness to
get it done. But if you're a no-name celebrity like me, or even if
you're the real thing, people will ask for your autograph and they
don't even know who you are. That's really off-putting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't rule out the possibility that I could be sitting there
in a restaurant and someone who approaches is not only charming to
me but to the rest of the table. But most times, it's going to fail
and be awkward. And the famous person isn't going to like that.'' &QL;

HAWAII FIGHTS TO KEEP A NEWSPAPER 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Previously slugged HAWAII-STRIKE) 
(lb) 
 By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONOLULU _ Hawaii is no stranger to monopolies. This former
island kingdom is still a place where a handful of landlords own
vast tracts, where entrenched business interests dominate civic
affairs and where the Democratic Party, which has held sway since
the beginning of statehood, controls the governorship, the entire
congressional delegation and roughly 80 percent of the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   But now the state is fighting to keep Honolulu from becoming a
one-newspaper town.
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks ago, the owners of The Honolulu Star-Bulletin, a
scrappy afternoon daily that traces its roots to 1882, announced
plans to close on Oct. 30, without even offering it for sale, and
to accept a payment of $26.5 million to end a joint operating
agreement with its morning rival, The Honolulu Advertiser, which is
owned by Gannett Co. The end seemed inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual move, the Hawaii attorney general sued to block
the deal, arguing that Gannett's payment violated federal antitrust
law.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started looking into it, and we had a sense that there's
this transaction that's about to be consummated that involves the
payment of a big chunk of change by one competitor to its only
competition to close down,'' said Rod Kimura, a deputy state
attorney general. ``And we felt there was enough there to say:
`Look, why should we just sit back and ponder this? We ought to
bring it before the appropriate body, which is the court.'''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Judge Alan Kay of U.S. District Court here ruled
that the payment was tantamount to a buyout that would eliminate
``any competition to The Advertiser in this unique island
community,'' and so would run counter to the intent of the
Newspaper Preservation Act, a 1970 federal law that waived
antitrust rules to let newspapers share some operating expenses in
an effort to preserve competition.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Kay said, the deal was not exempt from antitrust
scrutiny, and he granted a preliminary injunction barring the
closure.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, the Justice Department subpoenaed records and began an
investigation into whether the planned closing broke antitrust
laws. Federal lawyers are conducting a similar review of Hearst
Corp.'s purchase of The San Francisco Chronicle, which has been in
a joint operating agreement with The San Francisco Examiner, owned
by Hearst.
</P>
<P>
   Gannett has appealed to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals,
in San Francisco, where the injunction is pending, arguing that it
was exempt from antitrust provisions under the Newspaper
Preservation Act, and that forcing it to publish the paper would
violate its First Amendment rights.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1962, the Honolulu papers have functioned under a joint
operating agreement in which they shared production, advertising
and distribution costs but maintained separate newsrooms. The
current agreement, entered into six years ago when Gannett sold The
Star-Bulletin to Liberty Newspapers for $15 million and then bought
The Advertiser from a local family, was set to expire in 2012.
</P>
<P>
   Rupert Phillips, a mainland investor who is a general partner of
Liberty, said in announcing the closing that he could make at least
a 20 percent return by investing in mainland newspapers instead of
the annual return of 12 percent to 17 percent that he was
guaranteed under the joint operating agreement.
</P>
<P>
   No one questions Liberty's right to sell the paper, which is
profitable, or to close it and let the joint operating agreement
expire. It is Gannett's payment that has raised the hackles of
state and federal authorities.
</P>
<P>
   In a court brief filed last week in support of Hawaii's effort
to block the closing, the Justice Department said the case ``may
present important questions of the extent of antitrust immunity
conferred by the Newspaper Preservation Act and the reach of
antitrust laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Munger, a lawyer for Gannett, said the newspaper would have
no further comment until it filed its next brief, on Wednesday, as
did Alan Marx, a lawyer for Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   Some time after that, a three-judge panel of the court of
appeals is expected to decide whether to uphold the injunction and
allow a trial on the closing, or lift the injunction.
</P>
<P>
   If the injunction is lifted, all sides expect The Star-Bulletin
to close within days. If the case goes to trial, no one is sure
what would happen, though most experts agree that The Star-Bulletin
would eventually close, because Gannett has already acquired most
of its assets and advertisers will face continuing pressure to
patronize The Advertiser, whose daily circulation is about 105,000
compared with about 65,000 for the Star-Bulletin.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   George Chaplin, who was editor in chief of The Advertiser for 28
years until his retirement in 1986, and who retains the title of
editor at large, predicted that The Star-Bulletin could not
survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time this happens, it's a real tragedy and it imposes a
real responsibility on the remaining paper to try to fill the gap,
which it never adequately can,'' Chaplin said
</P>
<P>
   The possible closure is a bitter irony for the staff of The
Star-Bulletin, which over the last two years has helped prompt a
small revolution with its aggressive coverage of mismanagement at
the Bishop Estate, a giant trust of former royal lands that has
been the subject of an investigation by state and federal
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation has led to the replacement of the estate's
board of politically connected trustees. The Star-Bulletin sparked
the case by publishing a manifesto by Hawaiian elders criticizing
the trust, after The Advertiser had asked the authors for more time
to decide whether to run it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult, obviously,'' said the Star-Bulletin's managing
editor, David Shapiro, whose remaining staff rallied last week to
cover the shooting of seven people at a Xerox Corp. warehouse even
as some editors had already begun leaving. ``People are distracted.
Emotions are all over the place, understandably so.''
</P>
<P>
   The Advertiser has said it will have room for perhaps 20 to 25
of the Star-Bulletin's 100 reporters and editors, said Wayne
Cahill, administrative officer of the Hawaii Newspaper Guild, which
represents workers at both papers. He is still hopeful a way can be
found to keep the paper open until at least the end of the joint
operating agreement in 2012.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always a settlement possibility,'' Cahill said, but he
added: ``If the injunction's lifted, the paper's dead. Then it's
left for lawyers to argue over who did a bad thing.''

   BOEING-TAIL (Newport R.I) _ Hundreds of Boeing 767 airplanes
like EgyptAir plane that crashed off the Massachusetts coast,
killing all 217 people aboard, could be flying with improperly
torqued bolts that hold the vertical tail to the fuselage, the
Seattle Post-Intelligencer has learned. It is not yet clear if the
suspect bolts could be in planes built as far back as 1989, the
year the 767-300 that crashed was delivered to EgyptAir. Boeing
says the bolts aren't likely to pose a safety threat to airplanes

 &HT;    Hawks' journey of discovery
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Every November they have an NBA season, they send the
Hawks west. However, the first trip of the season has never quite
had all the ramifications of this one.
</P>
<P>
   With stops tonight in Denver, then Vancouver, Portland and Los
Angeles to meet the Lakers, the young Hawks will be asked to run at
a time when they are still stumbling.
</P>
<P>
   They will see some of the best competition in the Trail Blazers
and Lakers after taking on some of the weakest in the West, the
Nuggets and Grizzlies.
</P>
<P>
   They will encounter their past when Dikembe Mutombo returns to
Denver; when ex-teammate Grant Long, injured and dressed in
civvies, says hello from the western corner of Canada; when Steve
Smith, among the classiest of all who wore the Hawks uniform, goes
after them in Portland.
</P>
<P>
   They will compare their own new Philips Arena to the plush,
bright Pepsi Center here and the Staples Center in Los Angeles.
Hawks-Thrashers-Braves president Stan Kasten and Hawks executive
vice president Lee Douglas will dare to compare in person.
</P>
<P>
   They will encounter the pessimism of a city expecting to lose
its team in Vancouver and the optimism born of a star-studded
roster in Portland, undefeated through four.
</P>
<P>
   With all that as a backdrop, the Hawks will try to at least
break even. If that is to happen, victories tonight and Wednesday
in Vancouver are almost compulsory.
</P>
<P>
   Quite understandably, coach Lenny Wilkens said, ``I feel a lot
better about things'' after the Hawks clobbered the weak Chicago
Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Why not? The Hawks shot .543 from the field, accumulated 21
assists, 10 steals and committed only 11 errors after 49 violations
in opening losses to Washington and Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Mutombo, who scored 16 points, grabbed 13 rebounds and blocked
three shots against marginally talented Will Perdue, also took
heart in the 113-97 triumph.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we showed how good we can be,'' Mutombo said. ``You
must start someplace and establish yourself if you are going to be
a good team. In our first two games we did not do that, but in this
one we played with much more confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our young guys are learning. Young (Chris) Crawford played
better (14 points). (Jason) Terry is improving night after night.
There's a lot more we want to see of him. I think his communication
with Bimbo (Coles) is working very well. I see them talking in the
time-outs, Bimbo telling him what he can do and that makes him
better.''
</P>
<P>
   With the wealth of shooters at their disposal, the Hawks'
success will be in the hands of Coles, a nine-year journeyman, and
Terry, the bright neophyte.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took a big step,'' Coles said of Terry, who had 12 points
and five assists against the Bulls and sparked the rally that
turned the game in the second quarter. ``But he's lucky. He's got a
lot of old point guards to each him _ me, Lenny and. . . . then
there's Stan The Man (Kasten).''
</P>
<P>
   They'll all be available on this trek west.

COMMENTARY: MARATHON MAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BOB HERBERT c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHUA, N.H. _ Al Gore seemed to be enjoying himself. The
instant reviews were coming in and they were quite favorable. The
vice president had just finished a two-hour open meeting with 125
mostly independent voters in Plymouth, N.H. He answered every
question they came up with, including one from a man who was
convinced that the search for a cure for cancer should be financed
by a steep dedicated tax on beer and ``every bottle of booze'' sold
in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect your opinion,'' Gore said, ``but I am not prepared
to endorse it right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the people at the Saturday morning meeting expressed
surprise at the range and the depth of the vice president's
knowledge of complex issues, and his eloquence as he talked about
matters like gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   In response to a health care question, Gore offered _ as he does
at nearly every stop _ a ferocious critique of Bill Bradley's
health care proposal, saying it would devour the budget surplus
over 10 years, largely destroy the Medicaid system and jeopardize
financing for Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   He said his own, more modest plan to provide access to health
insurance for every child in America within four years was
politically doable and had the virtue of remaining within the
constraints of a balanced budget. ``It's affordable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore may finally have stumbled upon himself. He's chucked
those long and dreadfully boring speeches. He no longer genuflects
before every politician in the house. He speaks frequently to
relatively small gatherings of ordinary citizens and talks to them
about whatever is on their minds. This plays to his strengths _ his
intelligence, his fundamental decency, his enormous capacity for
hard work and the experience he has gained from nearly seven years
as vice president.
</P>
<P>
   In response to a question about gay rights, Gore told the
audience: ``I do not believe that God could have intended for
people to be persecuted all their lives because of who they are or
who they fall in love with.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to health care and gay rights, the vice president
spoke easily and knowledgeably about the test ban treaty, gun
control, the environment and the dangers of excessive partisanship
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did very well,'' said Eileen Curran-Konrad, an English
teacher from New Hampton. ``He doesn't have charisma, but he has
substance and that's important. I'm going to vote for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Normandin, a lawyer from Laconia, said: ``He did an
outstanding job here. He displayed experience that other candidates
don't have, and he will bring respect and dignity to the White
House.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's appearance in Plymouth was one of several around the
state. There were no inside-the-Beltway questions, no queries about
campaign staffers, or the shift of his headquarters from Washington
to Nashville, Tenn., or the recent flap over Naomi Wolf, the writer
who has been advising him on women's issues. The voters were
interested in health care, education, human rights at home and
abroad, the danger of nuclear proliferation and Gore's vision of
America's future.
</P>
<P>
   During a stop in North Conway, the vice president devoted a few
gleeful minutes to George W. Bush's foreign policy follies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sympathize,'' said Gore, ``with those who say it's not
necessarily important whether a candidate for president who's just
getting his feet wet knows the names of the leaders of foreign
countries. But I think that it is an issue if a candidate for
president has no idea why it's important to stop the spread of
nuclear weapons with a comprehensive test ban treaty.''
</P>
<P>
   The audience applauded. Gore then referred to Bush's comment
about the coup in Pakistan. (Bush had said: ``The new Pakistani
general, he's just been elected _ not elected, this guy took over
office. It appears this guy is going to bring stability to the
country and I think that's good news for the subcontinent.'')
</P>
<P>
   Said Gore: ``I think it's important if a candidate for president
in our country, the world's oldest democracy, doesn't know that
when a democracy is overturned by a military coup, it's not good
news for America.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a good day for Al Gore. He ended it with a well-received
speech, delivered without notes, in Dover. He told the dinner
audience, among other things, that ``democracy is a marathon, not a
sprint.'' Hardly anyone missed the point.

A TOP GOVERNMENT LAWYER PUTS A BREAKUP ON THE TABLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Justice Department's top antitrust enforcer said for the
first time on Sunday that a break-up of Microsoft Corp. was within
a range of remedies being considered in the government's antitrust
suit against the software giant.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Attorney General Joel Klein, head of the Justice
Department's antitrust division, said on the ABC News program
``This Week'' that a wide range of remedies were being considered
in the wake of highly favorable court findings on Friday, and that
a break-up ``is in the range.'' But he cautioned that Justice
officials had not decided on any tack.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at a lot of remedies, and it is premature for us
now to get ahead of the story,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson of U.S. District Court on Friday
handed the Justice Department a huge victory in its antitrust
lawsuit, concluding that Microsoft had a monopoly in the
operating-system market and used it to bully competitors and stifle
innovation.
</P>
<P>
   Still to come is Jackson's verdict, in which he will determine
whether the facts he set out in his findings violate antitrust
laws. If he rules against Microsoft early next year, as now seems
likely, the verdict will be followed immediately by hearings on
what remedies would be needed to ensure competition.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has vowed to appeal any unfavorable decision. Some
experts said they thought the harshness of the judge's findings
last week were intended to pressure Microsoft into a settlement,
and over the weekend both Justice Department and Microsoft
officials expressed some interest in settling.
</P>
<P>
   In a full-page advertisement in The Washington Post on Sunday,
presented as a letter ``to our customers, partners and
shareholders,'' Microsoft's co-founder and chairman, Bill Gates,
said, ``Microsoft is committed to resolving this matter in a fair
and responsible manner, while ensuring that the fundamental
principles of consumer choice and innovation are protected.''
</P>
<P>
   But what happens if there is no settlement? After all, every
attempt to reach an agreement, both before the trial and in the
weeks after testimony concluded, came to nothing. Now, a settlement
would seem even less likely, given that Jackson's findings give the
Justice Department little incentive and Microsoft little room to
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming an eventual verdict in the government's favor, the case
will move to the remedies phase.
</P>
<P>
   On another Sunday talk show, CNN's ``Late Edition,'' Klein ruled
out financial penalties against Microsoft. ``We're concerned with
competition,'' he said. ``This is not a penal action.'' He added
that a proper remedy ``will make sure the market remains maximally
competitive so that consumers can have real choices and so that
everyone can innovate in this market.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's lawyers say it is far too early to talk about
remedies. ``After all, the court still hasn't drawn any legal
conclusions,'' said Charles Rule, a Washington lawyer and Microsoft
adviser who held Klein's job at the Justice Department during the
Reagan and Bush administrations. ``Everybody gets way ahead of
themselves talking about remedies at this stage.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The potential remedies that have been discussed by analysts and
Microsoft critics fall into two categories: ``behavioral'' changes
in the way the company interacts with customers and competitors,
and more sweeping ``structural'' changes to the corporation itself.
</P>
<P>
   The first route would basically compel the company to ``sin no
more.'' It could, for example, prohibit Microsoft's contracts with
computer manufacturers from requiring the purchase of other
Microsoft products. It could require the publishing of pricing
lists. It could require that Microsoft publish specifications for
the Windows application program interfaces, or APIs, the
operating-system code that rival software manufacturers must know
if their products are to run on Windows as well as Microsoft's
programs do.
</P>
<P>
   But the Justice Department could also ask that Microsoft be
required to license the source code of its Windows operating-system
to competitors, effectively selling the code and the brand to the
highest bidders and creating instant competition in Microsoft's
monopoly market.
</P>
<P>
   The harshest remedy would be divestiture. One option could split
Microsoft into three companies _ one to produce the Windows
operating system, one to produce application software like Excel,
Powerpoint and Word, and one to run its Internet and multimedia
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Another break-up scenario would be the creation of a handful of
new companies that would each have proprietary information for
Windows and Microsoft's other software products. Starting on equal
footing, these ``Baby Bills'' _ a pun that combines Gates' first
name with ``Baby Bells,'' the local phone companies created by the
1984 breakup of AT&AMP;T _ would compete with one another.
</P>
<P>
   Each potential remedy has pitfalls.
</P>
<P>
   The behavioral changes could institute a regulatory-oversight
morass and, some fear, might not go far enough. Leaving the
operating-system business under one roof, critics say, might not
eliminate anti-competitive behavior.
</P>
<P>
   And licensing the source code to other companies _ or breaking
Microsoft into ``Baby Bills'' _ could lead to incompatible versions
of the operating system and other software, which would be a
nightmare for consumers and developers.

WITH A 57-YARD PASS PLAY, LIONS OVERCOME RAMS IN FINAL 1:17 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONTIAC, Mich. _ The St. Louis Rams have amazed, even terrified,
the National Football League with their powerful and versatile
offense. But fear only lasts so long. It takes just a short time
for the rest of the league, full of innovative men, to put a team
like the Rams under a microscope and pick it apart, like a
scientist breaking down a virus.
</P>
<P>
   That detailed exam of the Rams' offense has led to a sharp
decline in production. St. Louis scored a healthy 143 first-half
points in its first six games but only 12 first-half points in its
last two. And in suburban Detroit Sunday, where the big story
continues to be ``Barry Who?'', the Rams again looked mortal.
</P>
<P>
   And in a wild, thrilling 31-27 victory by Detroit, it was the
Lions' offense that showed it could be the best in the game. In a
year of improbable stories, the Lions are among the most
surprising, leaping to the top of the National Football Conference
without all-world runner Barry Sanders. With a 6-2 record, the
Lions are tied with the Rams for the conference's best record.
</P>
<P>
   ``We proved today that there is no longer a question, `Are these
guys for real?''' said Lions safety Ron Rice. ``We're for real.
Believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   It is hard not to believe, especially after watching what will
surely end up being one of the most exciting fourth quarters of the
season. After both teams combined for only 2 points in the opening
period _ Detroit running back Greg Hill was tackled for a safety by
linebacker London Fletcher _ the game ended in a flurry of
activity. That included a pass for 57 yards on fourth-and-26 with
barely one minute remaining in the game.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed like there was no way the Rams would endure a two-game
losing streak, especially after St. Louis took a 27-24 lead with
just under three minutes remaining. The team scored because of a
smart call by offensive coordinator Mike Martz. With the ball on
the Detroit 2, Ram center Ryan Tucker reported as an eligible
receiver, and the Lions ignored him, as most teams do in that
situation. But after Tucker snapped the ball, and quarterback Kurt
Warner faked a handoff to Marshall Faulk, the 305-pound lineman ran
a lumbering pass pattern. Warner, who threw for 305 yards, four
touchdowns and three interceptions, lobbed Tucker the ball. No
Detroit player was within 5 yards. Warner passed to Isaac Bruce for
the 2-point conversion.
</P>
<P>
   There were 2 minutes 42 seconds remaining, and the situation was
dire for Detroit. Quarterback Charlie Batch was on the sideline
after banging his thumb on a defender's helmet. His backup, Gus
Frerotte, was at the helm, and he is most famous for injuring his
neck several years ago after banging his head in celebration on a
padded concrete wall while with the Washington Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to sit here and say I was excited about our
chances at that point,'' said Detroit defensive lineman James
Jones. ``But we never doubted ourselves as a team.''
</P>
<P>
   The drive, which started at the Lion 23, began with a false
start penalty then, two plays later, Frerotte was sacked for a
14-yard loss by end Kevin Carter. Two plays after that, the
quarterback was again dropped for negative yardage, this time for
eight yards by tackle D'Marco Farr. That left a fourth down and 26
at the Detroit 21-yard line with 1:17 left.
</P>
<P>
   Since wide receiver Germane Crowell (8 catches for 163 yards)
had burned Rams cornerback Dexter McCleon all afternoon, the Lions
again went to that well, figuring there was plenty to drink.
Crowell bolted by McCleon for a 57-yard reception that put the
Lions at the St. Louis 22 with one minute left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't surprised I got behind him,'' Crowell said of
McCleon. ``I was running past him all day.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Lions Coach Bobby Ross: ``I'm not going to sit here and
sound intelligent like we did this and that on that play. We just
laid the ball up.''
</P>
<P>
   On third down, McCleon, who will want to incinerate this
particular set of game films, was called for pass interference on
Crowell. That put the ball at the Ram 12. Then Frerotte threw a
wonderfully timed fade pass to Johnnie Morton for the winning
score.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit helped itself by studying game film of last week's
Tennessee victory over St. Louis, then stole a page from the
Titans' defensive blueprint. Last week, the Titans beat the Rams by
stacking the line of scrimmage to stop Faulk and constantly blitzed
Warner. Sunday, Faulk had only 15 yards rushing on 11 attempts and
Warner was under pressure all afternoon, sacked four times.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ron Rice is right, it is time to start taking the
Lions seriously. In this strange NFL season, who says they cannot
have Super Bowl dreams?

<P>
   NEW YORK _ For the second time in two years, Miguel Such was the
first to roll across the finish line in the New York City
Marathon's wheelchair event Sunday, and he thrust his fists in the
air and savored victory.
</P>
<P>
   But for Such and several other wheelchair athletes, who have
sued the marathon's organizers for discrimination, the real victory
was that none of them were stopped along the course to let leading
runners pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was much better than ever before,'' said Bob Neumayer, a
52-year-old veteran of 14 New York marathons. ``They didn't stop us
at the 59th Street Bridge, and that's the first time since 1986. I
saw progress. There is a long way to go, but I saw progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Nine wheelchair athletes, including two of the top three men's
finishers Sunday, filed suit against the New York Road Runners Club
in July, alleging that the marathon has discriminated against them
not only by delaying wheelchair racers to let top runners pass, but
also by denying them prize money and medals, which the elite
runners receive.
</P>
<P>
   New York has lagged behind most other cities in Europe and the
United States where wheelchair divisions have become a fixture in
marathons. In the last 20 years, wheelchair racing has developed
from a sideshow into a sport in its own right, with strict rules
about equipment. Some elite wheelchair athletes have become
professionals, attracting sponsorships and living on their purses.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Road Runners Club, however, has never created a
separate division for the wheelchair athletes with prizes and
medals. Nor does the marathon distinguish between the athletes
using racing wheelchairs pushed by hand and those using
hand-cranked chairs, which use bicycle gears.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to create an official wheelchair division and then
they can eliminate all these problems,'' Such said, after winning
with a time of 2 hours 39 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Such, a broad-shouldered 25-year-old professional racer from
Wilkes-Barre, Pa., said he was happy none of the wheelchair
athletes was detained along the route as some were last year, when
the police held dozens at the Queensboro Bridge for a half-hour to
let the lead runners pass.
</P>
<P>
   But Such noted with some bitterness that there was no ribbon at
the finish line for him, nor would there be any ceremony for the
top three wheelchair finishers, not to mention the lack of purses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the publicity we have here, and go to the runners and
compare the two,'' he said, struggling to get into sweat clothes in
the recovery area. ``There is a huge difference. We should be able
to get the same publicity. We should be able to get some prize
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Nogueira, an artist and professional wheelchair racer from
Glen Ridge, N.J., who came in third in the event (2:01:46) agreed.
``To do 26 miles and have no ribbon?'' he said. ``Come on!''
</P>
<P>
   But other wheelchair athletes said they were satisfied with the
road runners club's response to their complaints. In October, the
organizers agreed in a court-ordered stipulation not to
``unreasonably or unlawfully obstruct'' the wheelchair athletes.
They also agreed not to deflect news media attention from the
wheelchair event.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Guzman, 52, of Queens, was among those stopped at the
Queensboro Bridge last year. ``This year there was no problem,'' he
said. ``They only problem we had this year was there was too much
wind.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the wheelchair participants said the high winds and
chilly temperatures slowed their times dramatically. One hundred
forty-five men and women from 30 countries competed, though not all
used racing wheelchairs. The race started at 10:20 a.m., a
half-hour before the runners set off.
</P>
<P>
   Franz Neitlispach, a top wheelchair racer from Switzerland, who
recently won the Chicago marathon, took an early lead, accompanied
closely by his countryman Guido Mueller. Neitlispach was considered
the man to beat in this field.
</P>
<P>
   Such and Nogueira, who often train together, could not close the
gap on the Swiss duo until Mile 14. Wheelchair racing is similar to
cycling, in which competitors draft off the chair ahead of them to
conserve energy and then try to tire their opponents with repeated
challenges.
</P>
<P>
   At the 14th mile it appeared to be a four-man race. But
Neitlispach inexplicably dropped out and finished back in the pack.
Then at the 23rd mile, Such made his move, breaking away. Mueller,
a 40-year-old electronic technician, who finished first here in
1979, found the strength to push past Nogueira in the last two
miles, finishing with a time of 2:01:11, but he could not catch
Such.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very hard because of the wind,'' he said, slumped over
his chair with exhaustion at the finish.
</P>
<P>
   The first-place finisher among women was Helene A. Hines, 51, of
Lido Beach, N.Y., a former physical education teacher who has
multiple sclerosis. It was her first race in a wheelchair, though
she said she had run marathons. Using a hand-cranked chair, she
finished in 2:15:20. ``They told me hold back because it was my
first time,'' she said. ``But I just went for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The second-place women's spot went to a Canadian, Diane
Rakiecki, a 38-year-old teacher from Kelowna, British Columbia, who
rolled across the finish on a hand-cranked chair with a time of
2:32:23.
</P>
<P>
   The first woman to finish in a racing wheelchair, according to
the official results, was Maria Rosales of Argentina, 34th in
3:31:56.
</P>
<P>
   For the nine plaintiffs in the lawsuit, the day was a step in
the right direction. Still, Such said he longs for a day when a
wheelchair athlete will receive a gold medal on a dais in New York,
as in Boston and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York just hasn't caught up,'' he said, shaking his head.
``You see, it's for that little kid who is sitting at home and just
broke his back and can't look up to a Michael Jordan or a Wayne
Gretzky. But he can look up to a wheelchair athlete.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration may have rattled the
house of Bill Gates with its aggressive antitrust case against
Microsoft, but it is in the process of winking at some of the older
economic empires that in an earlier age dominated American
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   In a few days President Clinton is expected to sign a financial
services bill repealing the 1933 act that had shattered the house
of Morgan. The administration has already approved deals that have
resurrected big pieces of the old Bell telephone system, and later
this year regulators may approve an $80 billion merger involving
Exxon that would restore a chunk of the old Rockefeller oil empire.
</P>
<P>
   These and other actions from Washington reflect an enduring
legacy of Clinton's tenure. Assuming the president's signature on
new banking legislation that will deregulate Wall Street and usher
in a new wave of corporate consolidations, Clinton and his
administration will go down in history as encouraging the largest
number of business mergers _ and in some industries the greatest
concentration of economic power _ in many years.
</P>
<P>
   While its prosecution of Microsoft for using monopoly power to
squelch competition, and a few other notable exceptions, have shown
the Clinton administration to be more aggressive on antitrust
matters than were the regulators during the Reagan and Bush years,
the administration has also been far more tolerant of business
mergers than officials earlier in the century and in the 1960s. And
the deregulation under Clinton of telecommunications, financial
services and other industries, combined with policies that do not
condemn big mergers for their size alone, has led to an
unprecedented number of corporate deals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the greatest merger wave in history, and yet we are
hardly in the greatest litigation wave,'' said John Shepard Wiley
Jr., a professor of antitrust law at the University of California
at Los Angeles. ``There has been a sea change in attitudes toward
large mergers. It's a much different philosophy from the 1960s,
when the polestar was the protection of small business.''
</P>
<P>
   During the 12 years of the Reagan and Bush administrations,
which are widely viewed as among the most permissive antitrust
periods of the century, there were 85,064 corporate mergers valued
at more than $3.5 trillion, according to Securities Data Co. Under
nearly seven years of the Clinton administration, there have so far
been 166,310 deals valued at more than $9.8 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   But the numbers tell only a small part of the story.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Washington have already approved deals that have
put back together huge pieces of the old Ma Bell, reducing the
number of regional Bell companies to four from an original seven.
Officials are now considering a merger between Sprint and MCI
Worldcom that would reduce to two the number of dominant American
long-distance carriers, a second deal that will allow AT&AMP;T to
control more than 35 percent of the cable industry, and a third
merger that would give Viacom an ownership interest of at least 35
percent of the broadcast market.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, in the 1960s, Justice Department officials
successfully challenged many relatively small deals, perhaps the
most notable of which was the Vons grocery company's proposed
acquisition of Shopping Bag Food Stores, in which the combined
entity would have controlled only 7.5 percent of the Los Angeles
market.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Clinton administration has applied a looser
standard of review of mergers and acquisitions than some previous
administrations, it has been more aggressive in other areas of
antitrust enforcement. It has, for example, brought a number of
major price-fixing cases and initiated many important international
cartel investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Without doubt, its most prominent monopoly case has been the
Microsoft lawsuit, in which a federal judge concluded last week
that the company had bullied competitors and stifled innovation.
The case fits squarely in the tradition of the antitrust action
that the government began in the late 1960s against IBM and AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   In the area of mergers, Clinton officials say that despite the
number of large corporate combinations and the emergence of more
huge financial conglomerates, the economy is robustly competitive,
and that the economies of scale and scope achieved by some of the
mergers have served consumers well.
</P>
<P>
   ``While there are clearly new challenges for regulation in
antitrust,'' Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said Thursday in
an interview, ``I suspect that in the majority of industries, the
degree of competition has increased. Because of technology and
openness to trade, in many areas consumers have more choices than
ever before. And clearly one reason that inflation is low is that
businesses today have less pricing power.''
</P>
<P>
   Summers and other officials say that the globalization of the
economy has enlarged the marketplace to more than offset any
potential ill effects caused by the wave of mergers. The treasury
secretary also said that the deregulation of major industries, most
recently financial businesses, would help those who shop for
banking, securities and insurance services.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will make the economy more efficient and consumers will
benefit from that,'' he predicted. ``As the deregulation of
airlines and telecommunications demonstrates, archaic restrictions
reduce choice and raise prices.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics questions the policies. In the financial services
area, they ask whether regulators will be able to adequately
oversee new conglomerates that, should they encounter difficulties,
could pose systemwide problems. In telecommunications, they wonder
whether the government has been so permissive as to stifle
competition. And more generally, they ask whether the regulators of
an earlier day had it right in questioning size for size's sake.

</P>
<P>
   ``Teddy Roosevelt is turning over in his grave,'' said Kenneth
Guenther, a top lobbyist for many small banks and savings
associations, recalling Roosevelt's trust-busting instincts.
</P>
<P>
   Through much of the century, Washington viewed big industries
and financial conglomerates with great suspicion, reflecting a
long-held American fear that concentration was not a good thing.
There was also deep distrust of unchecked financial institutions,
particularly during times of economic decline, when they were
blamed for economic woes.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, following one of the biggest economic booms of all
times, Washington has become more trusting of Wall Street today, to
the point where it was not considered a big deal when former
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin announced that he would become a
senior official at Citigroup, the nation's largest financial
institution and a major beneficiary of the new financial services
law that Rubin had worked so hard to have adopted.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Pitofsky, chairman of the Federal Trade Commission,
recalled: ``There used to be a populist attitude abroad and in the
United States that big was bad, that very large companies treated
their workers, their customers and their supplies in ways that
weren't entirely fair. The idea was that small towns were better
served by small enterprises than by big firms from the East Coast.
There is now less mistrust of large companies, and the question is
no longer simply whether a firm is big, but whether its size is
being used unfairly to restrict competition and hurt consumers.
There is less apprehension about bigness than there used to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitofsky, a leading antitrust scholar, has been a major
proponent of examining big mergers not just by their size, but also
by exploring what efficiencies they may create that can benefit
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   But some experts say that in particular industries, like
financial services, deals that may seem either neutral or
beneficial to consumers in the short run may come with longer-term
costs. Many experts predict that the new financial services
legislation will lead to problems.
</P>
<P>
   The major question is whether regulators will be able to
adequately supervise the new financial behemoths, a process that
one former top official recently likened to ``bloodhounds chasing
greyhounds.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have in place the protocols to handle the problems,''
said Edward Kane, a professor of finance at Boston College, who in
the 1980s made the most accurate prediction of the impending
decacle of the savings and loan industry, which bankrupted a
federal deposit insurance fund. ``If our government could not
discipline the savings and loan industry in the 1960s, '70s and
'80s, how will it be able to discipline a Citigroup and other
global interests in 2000?''
</P>
<P>
   Summers said that if anything, the new legislation would reduce
certain risks by permitting financial institutions to move into new
areas of business. ``Diversified institutions are less likely to
fail than undiversified institutions,'' he said. ``Financial
institutions that are better diversified have safer portfolios.''
</P>
<P>
   Other officials, including Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan, while broadly endorsing the move to deregulate Wall
Street, have spoken of the need to be particularly vigilant about
the larger financial institutions soon to emerge.
</P>
<P>
   The new banking legislation also recognizes the particular
threats to the system posed by the nation's largest financial
institutions by imposing certain new conditions on the 50 biggest
ones if they decide to enter into the securities or insurance
businesses.

UNDERDOGS WOO INDEPENDENT VOTERS IN KEY STATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JAMES DAO with ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Michael O'Leary spent his Saturday knocking
on doors for Bill Bradley, the former senator who is running for
the Democratic presidential nomination. Yet O'Leary says he is
considering voting for another candidate in New Hampshire's
first-in-the-nation primary in February: Sen. John McCain, the
maverick Republican from Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary, a 44-year-old building contractor from Lebanon, N.H.,
is one of the state's growing number of independents _ registered
to vote, politically active, but with no allegiance to either
party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Bradley is my first pick, but I'm tempted to vote for
McCain, so he can give Bush a run for the money,'' he said,
referring to the presumed Republican front-runner, Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In their underdog campaigns for the presidency, McCain and
Bradley are counting on victories, or at least near-victories, in
New Hampshire to give them a shot at knocking off their parties'
front-runners. And as they rise in the polls here, they find
themselves in an odd duel for independent voters like O'Leary, who
are allowed under state rules to cast ballots in the Democratic or
Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
   It is these independent voters who have given New Hampshire its
tradition of being kind to insurgent, anti-establishment
candidates. Recent polls show that they prefer McCain over Bush,
and Bradley over his lone Democratic rival, Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the independents are a growing force in the state's
politics. State officials predict that nearly 40 percent of New
Hampshire's voters will be unaffiliated by the 2000 election,
because the majority of new registrants decline to join a party.
</P>
<P>
   Now those independents could play pivotal roles in both parties'
primaries, raising a difficult question for McCain and Bradley: Is
this a zero-sum game where a surge among independents by one
necessarily hurts the other?
</P>
<P>
   ``Bradley and McCain are competing against each other for the
undeclared partisans,'' said Lynn Vavreck, assistant professor of
government at Dartmouth College. ``I suspect this contest will be
decided on which party primary these undeclared decide to vote
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Many political analysts say Gore was thinking about the
possibility of McCain's stealing unaffiliated voters from Bradley
when he recently praised the Republican, saying: ``He's a man of
integrity. I hear an awful lot of independents are taking a look at
him.'' (Gore did say that he thought he could win independent
voters, too.)
</P>
<P>
   McCain's and Bradley's campaigns say they do not expect to
siphon off unaffiliated voters from each other, asserting that many
independents tilt toward one party or the other.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's aides also note that beyond the two candidates'
agreement on overhauling campaign-finance rules _ an issue of
appeal to independents _ they differ sharply on other issues.
Bradley, for instance, supports gun control and abortion rights,
while McCain has a long anti-abortion record and generally has
opposed gun control.
</P>
<P>
   But even a small shift in unaffiliated voters could make a
difference in a tight race. And many political analysts say they
expect a significant number of independents to vote in the primary
that seems to be the closest contest, on the theory that their
votes would have greater impact. So the fact that McCain pulled to
within 10 points of Bush in one poll here last week has created a
race in both parties. Gore and Bradley are in a statistical dead
heat here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they will look and see who is going to win without
their vote and go to the other,'' said Jeffrey Peters, a New
Hampshire resident who is head of a group called We the People that
advocates greater political participation. ``And if it is really
close in both, then I think they will really have to scratch their
heads and decide between Bradley and McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary, for instance, said he was closer to Bradley on the
issues, but will vote for McCain in the Republican primary if he
thinks Bradley is way ahead, or hopelessly behind Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of what I said about Bradley I think about McCain,'' he
said. ``They come across as decent, honest, stand-up guys.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's crowds in New Hampshire are also often studded with
independents who say they are trying to choose between the two men.
Ernest Vanesse, 79, is one.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in the back of a rally on the day McCain made his
formal announcement in a park in Nashua, Vanesse said he was a
former Democrat who became an independent.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was disgusted with the Monica Lewinsky scandal and
would not vote for Gore, because of his loyalty to President
Clinton. But he praised McCain as ``clearly an honest individual.''
And he said he was also attracted to Bradley because he was a ``new
fresh person in the Democratic Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire's
Survey Center, said independents tended to be somewhat younger,
more mobile, more affluent and better educated than other voters.
He also said they tended to be more socially moderate, a factor
that could help Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's aides acknowledge that social moderates might not like
McCain's anti-abortion stance, but note that he has called for a
dialogue between the two sides of the issue, to see if there is
middle ground on matters like adoption.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, 38 percent of New Hampshire's electorate were
registered Republicans, 23 percent were Democrats and 32 percent
were unaffiliated. But by next year, some state officials predict,
independents will be the largest group.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way you win them over is with the outsider image,'' Smith
said. ``If you are an independent, you don't want to register to a
party. You've indicated you don't want to be part of the club.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Bradley are clearly following that strategy. Both
cast themselves as populists prepared to buck the status quo. And
both promise to fight the entrenched power of lobbyists through
sweeping changes in campaign finance.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   ``When our country has been taken from us by the special
interests, the big-dollar donors, pride is lost to shame,'' McCain
said in his formal campaign announcement in Nashua, in late
September.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Bradley put it to a group of supporters in Somersworth on
Friday: ``I can tell you right now, if we get campaign-finance
reform, it would be like cutting oxygen off for the lobbyists.''
</P>
<P>
   Their campaigns have also heavily focused on reaching out to
unaffiliated voters in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   John Weaver, McCain's political director, said the campaign
always invited the entire public, not just Republicans, to McCain's
frequent town hall meetings in New Hampshire. Until Oct. 29 _ the
deadline to change voter registration _ they urged Democrats who
attended those events to reregister as independents so they could
vote for him in the Republican primary. Weaver said he did not know
how many people had done so.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain campaign also includes in its coalition here a nearly
200-member group called New Hampshire Independents for McCain,
which Weaver said included some disaffected members of both major
parties. One of the chairmen, David Lee, is a volunteer accountant
for the Democratic State Committee who changed his registration to
independent.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's aides said they had no plans to form a separate group
for independents. But they have targeted unaffiliated voters in
their door-to-door canvassing, emphasizing an insurgent message
that they think will appeal to independents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore is more tied to the Democratic establishment,'' said Mark
Longabaugh, Bradley's New Hampshire coordinator. ``That sends a
signal to independent voters.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been efforts by New Hampshire groups that advocate
campaign-finance changes to bring the two candidates together in a
joint event. Though McCain's aides expressed interest in the idea,
Bradley's campaign rejected it _ an indication, perhaps, that the
campaign does not want to promote McCain's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   But at a recent event in Florida, Bradley said he thought McCain
had a good chance of winning the Republican nomination. The reason
he gave _ voters are looking for someone they can trust _ is the
same one he offers when asked why he expects to win the Democratic
race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not endorsing him, by the way,'' Bradley added.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ A 36-year-old former Portuguese track star intruded
on Kenya's annual dominance of the New York City Marathon on
Sunday, but only until he was inside Central Park, less than two
miles from the finish. From there it was all uphill.
</P>
<P>
   That was when Joseph Chebet, who for two years had run his heart
out here only to have it broken, pulled away from Domingos Castro
in the park's winding, gradual inclines to win the marathon's 30th
running on a bright but chilly, windy day.
</P>
<P>
   The 29-year-old Chebet distanced himself forever from his
reputation of the world's second-best marathoner, the way he left
Castro behind and, earlier, his countryman John Kagwe, the two-time
defending champion who faded badly and finished fifth. By winning
in 2 hours 9 minutes 14 seconds, Chebet won $50,000, in addition to
a $20,000 bonus for finishing under 2:10. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Chebet, the fifth Kenyan to win New York in six years, also
became the third runner after the Americans Alberto Salazar in 1982
and Bill Rodgers in 1978 to win the Boston and New York City
Marathons in the same year.
</P>
<P>
   American excellence, much less dominance, continued to be
ancient history, as Dan Middleman, a native Long Islander now out
of Raleigh, N.C, ran an American-best 26th, in 2:24:52. Arsenio
Ortiz, a Mexican who lives in Ozone Park, Queens, was 18th
(2:21:35).  &UR;  &LR;  ``One day,'' said Chebet, a whisper of a man with a
slightly stooped but remarkably efficient and consistent stride,
``I was supposed to win in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   In the high altitude of the Kenyan hills, Chebet _ a member of
the Marakwet tribe _ didn't exactly leave this to chance. Motivated
by his breakthrough in Boston, where he also finished second in
1998, Chebet said he added an extra month to the 10 weeks he had
trained for this race the previous two years. He created a
now-or-never mind-set, promising himself that if he didn't win this
time around, he would ``never go back to New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Then it became a matter of execution, of figuring out the best
way to put his extended regimen to use. It did not hurt Chebet that
German Silva, the two-time champion from Mexico best known for
winning in 1994 despite taking a wrong turn into the park, was in
the race as a pace setter, or so-called rabbit, though he had said:
``Please do not call me a rabbit. I am a helper.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, as a fellow member of Team Fila, Silva's presence
enabled him to assist Chebet, as well as the other Kenyans _
including the third-place finisher, Shem Kororia, a Chebet training
partner _ who were decked in the blue and orange colors of the
aforementioned shoe manufacturer. Besides helping to set the pace
for the first 90 minutes of the race, Silva carried on a running
dialogue with the leaders, particularly Chebet and the other Fila
Kenyans. He served as a shield for Chebet from the
20-to-30-mile-an-hour wind gusts that were often in the runners'
faces, played amateur psychologist for those moments when doubts
crept in and even served up a drink or two when Chebet and his
mates happened to miss a water station.
</P>
<P>
   Silva, not in marathon shape after having a wart removed from
his foot, had said he would drop out with the other pace setters
midrace. But when the leaders left the Queensboro Bridge onto First
Avenue at the 16th mile, there was Silva, running strong, with
Castro, Giacomo Leone of Italy, Abdelkhader el-Mouaziz of Morocco
and five Kenyans.
</P>
<P>
   Had Silva set everyone up, including his soul mates in shoe
sales? No, he said later. He was just waiting for the best place
where he could drop out to watch the rest of the race. He found it
in a television truck, which he jumped aboard, giving the
struggling el-Mouaziz one last directive: ``You stay,'' Silva said.
``I go.''
</P>
<P>
   Safely aboard the vehicle, perched in front of a monitor, Silva
watched as the seven leaders continued on, until they neared
Central Park on Fifth Avenue. The race seemed to have the potential
to be a free-for-all to the finish, the antithesis of the one-woman
women's event won by Adriana Fernandez of Mexico. Then, suddenly,
the leader field was down to Castro, Chebet and Kagwe, the muscular
Kenyan who trains in Valley Forge National Park near Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Looking fashionably cool in a wool cap and dark glasses, Kagwe,
with his long, powerful strides, offered no hint of the fate that
awaited him inside the park. Castro made a move. Chebet calmly went
with him. Kagwe, in a matter of a handful of strides, fell far
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost the energy and couldn't do it,'' Kagwe said, later
adding that he didn't feel comfortable after being kicked several
times by ``a Moroccan,'' presumably el-Mouaziz.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was tripped five times; the guy kept on hitting my right
leg,'' he said. ``I said, `Oh, no, this is a race and if I hit him,
I will be the one that will be sued.''' Later, he decided: ``It is
not a big deal. I forgive him.''
</P>
<P>
   Now it was Chebet, free at last of Kagwe, and Castro, a 1988
Olympian in the 5,000 meters who remade himself as a marathoner,
winning in Paris in 1995 and Rotterdam two years later. His twin
brother, Dionisio, ran 33rd among the men Sunday, but Domingos
Castro's problem in the park was separating himself from Chebet. He
tried once, and Chebet stayed with him. He tried again, a third
time, then a fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Chebet instinctively knew his time had come. ``I saw that he was
a bit tired,'' he said. ``So I used a lot of energy, trying to
leave him.''
</P>
<P>
   As Castro, a more animated, less austere runner, began pumping
his arms to keep up, Chebet burst ahead, with about one and
three-quarter miles to go. His 25th mile, run in 4:43, would be the
fastest by anyone in the race. Gabriele Rosa, Chebet's coach, said
later: ``The race went as planned. He moved when I wanted him to
go.''
</P>
<P>
   There was one last chance for Castro, after the right turn onto
Central Park South, a straightaway, before the final turn back into
the park, to the finish. Castro made up a few strides, but not
enough.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Kenya, Chebet said people had told him to ``keep on
training, keep on going.'' He took that advice, through Boston and
the 26 miles 385 yards of New York. He did not turn his head until
he was just a few yards from home, and then he knew he would never
again have to look back with regret on the last two years. &QL;

   Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule book reviews:
</P>
<P>
   ``MY GARDEN (BOOK)''  &QL; 
By Jamaica Kincaid (FSG, $23) &QL; 
Jamaica Kincaid has written books full of her difficult feelings
for her mother and her brother, but boy, does she love her garden.
She is agitated and vexed when she's in it, but she's happy:
``Nothing works just the way I thought it would, nothing looks just
the way I had imagined it, and when sometimes it does look like
what I had imagined (and this, thank God, is rare) I am startled
that my imagination is so ordinary.'' This book is dense with
growing things, overrun with blooms, fertile with every plant
you've ever heard of and then some. Fellow gardening author Michael
Pollan says Kincaid's voice is that of ``an exquisitely attentive
gardener thinking out loud.'' We'd note that ``exquisitely
attentive'' is a kind way of saying ``obsessed,'' but then it's all
New &AMP; Notable can do to water the tomatoes. Kincaid celebrates seed
and plant catalogs, discusses the link between gardeners and
conquerors, and notes that ``everyone I have ever met who has a
garden has something growing in it from seeds that were gathered in
Monet's garden.'' That means she cultivates exotic friends, too. &QL; 
``THE BOOK BORROWER'' &QL; 
By Alice Mattison (Morrow, $24) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This odd and meandering novel begins with the meeting of two
young mothers at a park in 1975. Deborah Laidlaw is there with her
daughters, Toby Ruben with her baby son, and in the course of their
conversation Toby borrows a book that Deborah has been carrying
around but has not found time to read. Two things begin in this
scene: a lifelong friendship between Toby and Deborah, and our
interest in the fate of that borrowed book, ``Trolley Girl,'' the
story of a tragedy that occurred during a strike among trolley
workers in 1921. For much of her novel, Mattison alternates the
interplay between Toby, Deborah and their families with sections
narrated by the author of ``Trolley Girl.'' We're not sure why she
does this but we're grateful for it, because ``Trolley Girl''
proceeds with a sense of purpose and anticipation. The ground is
not so firm under Toby and Deborah, whose friendship unfolds in
rambling conversations and unseen resolutions. One chapter ends
with a terrible conflict between the two friends when Toby almost
gets Deborah fired from her teaching job. To our surprise, the next
chapter begins years later, with their friendship obviously
restored, although Mattison does not say how. This is exasperating,
but ``The Book Borrower'' is not without saving graces. One is Toby
Ruben, an authentic character who slips into mean-spiritedness when
she feels threatened. Another is Mattison's portrayal of the give
and take between friends, between men and women, between parents
and children _ that messy navigation of emotional ties. In the end,
her novel is less notable for its story than for these small
moments that ring true. &QL; 
``IF THIS HOUSE COULD TALK'' &QL; 
By Elizabeth Smith Brownstein (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $35) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I have found that it is the visible, the tangible, that goes a
long way in softening prejudices,'' Booker T. Washington wrote in
``Up From Slavery.'' ``The actual sight of a first-class house that
a Negro has built is 10 times more potent than pages of discussion
about a house that he ought to build, or perhaps could build.'' And
so, against the wishes of some of his benefactors, Washington built
``The Oaks,'' a red brick house with parlor, library, dining room,
kitchen, family and guest bedrooms, den, breakfast room, five
bathrooms and a veranda on three acres of land overlooking the
campus of Alabama's Tuskegee Institute. Among the other buildings
included in this look at historic homes and the people who lived in
them are the stunning ``symphony in wood'' built in 1908 (for a
mere $55,000) for Proctor &AMP; Gamble heir David Gamble in Pasadena,
Calif.; the New Hampshire farm of poet Robert Frost; Lorenzo
Hubbell's house and trading post in Ganado; the Massachusetts
homestead of Rebecca Nurse, who was hanged during the Salem witch
trials; the Bronx, N.Y., cottage of Edgar Allan Poe; and Frank
Lloyd Wright's Storer House and Auldbrass Plantation. Our favorite
is illustrator Edward Gorey's Cape Cod cottage, where books are
piled precariously high on every horizontal surface in sight. This
engaging blend of history, architecture and interior design
contains what its author calls ``stories of great passion, courage
and brilliance . . . and enough cruelty, greed and ignorance to go
around.'' &QL; 
``THE COST OF LIVING'' &QL; 
By Arundhati Roy (Modern Library, $11.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Roy follows her Booker Prize-winning first novel, ``The God of
Small Things,'' with two essays, one on dam projects that have
scarred her native India and the other on India's detonation last
year of a nuclear bomb. The first, called ``The Greater Common
Good,'' is more demanding reading, but both benefit from Roy's very
personal and appealingly abrasive style. In the second essay, ``The
End of Imagination,'' she touches on the success of her novel.
``The more I thought about it,'' she writes, ``the clearer it
became to me that if fame was going to be my permanent condition it
would kill me. Club me to death with its good manners and hygiene.
I'll admit that I've enjoyed my own five minutes of it immensely
but primarilyBECAUSE (editor: ITAL) it was just five minutes.
Because I knew (or thought I knew) that I could go home when I was
bored and giggle about it. Grow old and irresponsible. Eat mangoes
in the moonlight. Maybe write a couple of failed books _
worstsellers _ to see what it felt like.'' Instead, she has written
this, a thought-provoking challenge from a citizen of India and of
the world. &QL;

FEW ATTRACTIVE OPTIONS FOR UCLA'S DEFENSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA returns from its three-day weekend today to
prepare for Washington's three-pronged attack: junior quarterback
Marques Tuiasosopo running left, Tuiasosopo running right and
Tuiasosopo through the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's perfect for what they're doing,'' Bruins defensive
coordinator Bob Field said. ``He's got speed and he's so big and
physical that he can break arm tackles. He's like a big back
running with the ball, not a quick little quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington coach Rick Neuheisel installed the option in training
camp, and Tuiasosopo _ a junior whose father, Manu, played for UCLA
from 1975-78 _ has used it to become the Pac-10's most dynamic
player.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, he accounted for 509 total yards against
Stanford, making him the first player in NCAA history to run for
200 yards and throw for 300.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, he'll face a UCLA defense that's statistically similar
to Stanford's. More, the Bruins have not seen an option-oriented
attack this season. The best they can do is reserve quarterback
Drew Bennett on the scout team: He's UCLA's best athlete, but he
can't match Tuiasosopo's strength or instincts.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, if the Bruins base their defense solely on
Tuiasosopo, Washington's running backs and receivers will run free.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're not ready for the option, it can be devastating,''
Field said. ``You have to be disciplined to stop it. You have to
have somebody on all three phases, the (fullback) dive, the pitch
man and the quarterback. It forces (the defense) to make plays in
the open field.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's something the Bruins haven't done well in two years.
</P>
<P>
   __ Need for speed: Sophomore receiver Freddie Mitchell leads
UCLA with 29 receptions and 529 all-purpose yards. But he hasn't
scored a touchdown, he's averaging just 12.5 yards per catch and he
hasn't made the big plays many UCLA fans expected.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Combine the broken leg he suffered last season with an
aching knee that's lingered since training camp, and Mitchell
doesn't have his fifth gear.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's his knee more than anything else,'' Bruins coach Bob
Toledo said. ``He's obviously not as fast or quick as he was prior
to the injury. He can't run away from people. He can't separate
from them like he was before.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Look ahead: Will Toledo and offensive coordinator Al Borges
let reserve quarterback Ryan McCann compete for Cory Paus' starting
job in spring practice? They'll know in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on how we finish and what progress the position
makes,'' Borges said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Red flag: The Bruins are the least-penalized team in the
Pac-10 (five per game), and that might not be such a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we need more penalties,'' Toledo said. ``We need to be
more aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   __ By the numbers: The Bruins have been outscored 84-31 in the
fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA is averaging 48,649 fans per home game, 25,000 fewer than
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Kenyon Coleman leads the Bruins with 3.5 sacks.
Last year, linebacker Brendon Ayanbadejo led the team with nine.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins are converting 37 percent of their third downs;
opponents are converting 46 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Who would have guessed: During its three-game losing streak,
UCLA has a turnover ratio of plus-one.

COMMENTARY: THE SKILLFUL ENVOY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If an inability to recall the name of the new
strongman in Pakistan is proof of George Bush's lightweightedness,
then we are all lightweights.
</P>
<P>
   More to the point is the presidential front-runner's instinctive
judgment about Gen. Pervaiz Musharraf, who just seized power from
the elected government in Islamabad: ``It appears this guy is going
to bring stability to the country and I think that's good news for
the subcontinent.''
</P>
<P>
   Is it really good news? Going deeper, would ``stability'' be the
lodestar of George W.'s foreign policy?
</P>
<P>
   When his father, President Bush, spoke in Ukraine just before
the breakup of the Soviet empire, he put stability before
democracy. In what was promptly labeled in this space as his
``Chicken Kiev'' speech, the president urged Ukrainians to stay
under Moscow's control _ a monumental misreading of history.
</P>
<P>
   Let's see if George W.'s instinct is right in the recent
military takeover of a corrupt government in Pakistan. To make the
best case for the new Musharraf regime, I turned to the most
skillful diplomat in the world today: Sahabzada Yaqub Khan.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan trots out the retired Yaqub, a former foreign minister
and ambassador to Washington and Moscow, whenever the nation is in
crisis or an especially delicate job is needed. (He helped arrange
Nixon's opening to China.) His mission to the U.S. this week is to
assure us that the military coup was necessary and is temporary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is democracy an end in itself,'' he asks rhetorically, ``or a
means to an end? What do you do when democracy leads ineluctably to
chaos?''
</P>
<P>
   His country was in a terrible mess. Bribery was rampant and
taxes were being routinely evaded. Banks were lending huge sums to
politicians without collateral. Legislators were intimidating
judges.
</P>
<P>
   ``And finally,'' says the envoy, ``the prime minister tried to
subvert the army's loyalty to the nation, subjecting it to
political intrigue, attempting to murder the commander in chief.
The very moral fiber of the nation was damaged by its political
leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he says, a group of nonpolitical technocrats has been
appointed to root out the corrupt practices, revivify the rule of
law, devolve power to local constituencies. Musharraf has promised
to return the nation to its electoral process as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistanis accept this. The AP reports from Pakistan that most
of the populace, disgusted with corruption and religious violence,
welcomed the army coup. As a system, popular government became
unpopular.
</P>
<P>
   But the trouble is, I said to Pakistan's veteran diplomat, that
we've heard this same song about a necessary quick fix four times
in 50 years. Is there something endemic in Pakistan that corrupts
government, subverts civil society and makes a coup necessary
almost every decade?
</P>
<P>
   He chewed that over. ``Is it part of our culture? Frankly, I
have no answer to that. So far, as you suggest, each of our
attempts to cure ourselves has failed. But we must continue to try,
and it is in your interest as a democracy to help us succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You Americans seem to possess democracy so naturally, and for
us it is so difficult. But it took you centuries; give us a few
years. Be patient with those to whom democracy does not come
easily.''
</P>
<P>
   Yaqub Kahn can be persuasive. But all too often, a man on
horseback takes over from disorderly democrats and promises a
return to democracy _ and, having tasted power, never gives it up.
Freedom disappears in the name of stability. Better for an army to
be patient, to resist the temptation to regularly straighten out
the nation, and to trust the people to express their disgust at
corruption at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the message briefers should advise Bush to send to
whatsisname, Pakistan's maximum leader: Sustained democracy, even
though it goes through periods of corruption, is better for people
than the most benign dictatorship or technocracy. Impress the world
with the speed with which you establish honest, free elections.
Only then can good politicians drive out bad.
</P>
<P>
   This view struck my diplomatic friend as impractical. He
recalled the story about Charles de Gaulle, who overheard a
frustrated reformer cry out, ``Death to all fools!'' Le general
shook his head wearily and observed, ``That is a vast program.''

 By BILL SULLIVAN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
KNOXVILLE, Tenn. _ Anyone up for a rematch?
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first meeting wasn't too shabby, after all. It was a little
sloppy, perhaps, but a fight to the finish just the same back on
Sept. 18, when Florida came away with a 23-21 win over defending
national champion Tennessee at The Swamp in Gainesville.
</P>
<P>
   As statements go, however, it was hardly an emphatic one. And if
the dominoes fall the right way in the next few weeks, the
Volunteers and Gators just might do it again in the Sugar Bowl,
this time with a national championship on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to believe that if we continue to play the way we have
that we'll be one of the teams considered,'' Vols coach Phillip
Fulmer said after Saturday night's 38-14 rout of then-No. 24 Notre
Dame. ``We'll have an opportunity now, and that's all you can ask
for.''
</P>
<P>
   That opportunity was very much in doubt after the early loss to
their most bitter Southeastern Conference rival, a defeat that all
but assured that Tennessee would not defend its league
championship, much less its national title. In the weeks since, the
Vols (7-1) have taken care of business but still struggled to find
their way back into the national picture.
</P>
<P>
   Then Saturday rolled around, and No. 2 Penn State lost to
Minnesota, effectively finishing Joe Paterno's hopes of making it
to Bourbon Street. No. 3 Virginia Tech, meanwhile, needed a
last-second field goal to get past West Virginia for a second
straight unimpressive win, giving new ammunition to critics who
dismiss the Hokies as products of a weak Big East and subpar
schedule overall.
</P>
<P>
   And what of No. 5 Florida (which passed Tennessee and crept up
to fourth in the Bowl Championship Series standings last week)? The
Gators had to hold off a late Vanderbilt drive to get away with a
13-6 win over the Commodores, another outcome not conducive to
wowing writers, coaches or computers sensitive to margin of
victory.
</P>
<P>
   So meet the Vols, last year's champions and the new BCS Flavor
of the Week.
</P>
<P>
   When the Associated Press writers poll and ESPN/USA Today
coaches survey came out Sunday, Tennessee found plenty to like. In
the AP version, Florida State stayed at No. 1, while Virginia Tech,
Tennessee, Florida and Kansas State each moved up a notch. Penn
State slipped to No. 6, followed by Nebraska, Mississippi State,
Wisconsin and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Among the coaches, the top five were the same, but Nebraska and
Mississippi State each jumped ahead of No. 8 Penn State. Wisconsin
and Texas rounded out the Top 10.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, then, a pretty good weekend for Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could feel the energy,'' Fulmer said of his team's
reaction to the Penn State loss. ``They said I had a 41-inch
vertical jump.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that helps. It gives us a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   When the new BCS rankings come out today, Tennessee should be no
worse than fourth overall, and the Vols' dominant performance
against the Fighting Irish could vault them back over the Gators
and perhaps even close the gap on Virginia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   With Penn State awaiting roadside assistance for its broken-down
bandwagon, the traffic begins to thin out a bit on the way to the
French Quarter, but several teams still have a chance to maneuver
to the front of the pack.
</P>
<P>
   For some, the route is smoother than others.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Florida State: &LR;  Win out _ no small trick with a Nov. 20 trip to
Florida looming. The Seminoles actually improved their margins in
both traditional polls by taking the weekend off but haven't played
like a solid No. 1 lately.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Virginia Tech: &LR;  Win out, but get help to make sure. The latter
is hardly out of the question, especially since the Florida
State-Florida death match will eliminate one of the two. Still, the
Hokies' poor strength-of-schedule score in the BCS formula makes it
imperative that they retain favor in both traditional polls and the
eight computer rating systems.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Florida:  &LR; Beat Florida State on Nov. 20. Beat the SEC West
winner in the league championship game. In that scenario, the
Gators eliminate FSU on their own and more than likely would jump
back over Tennessee to be no worse than No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Tennessee: &LR;  Barring a South Carolina shocker over Florida, the
Vols are locked out of the SEC title game and an extra chance to
shine. Still, the Florida-Florida State game solves one Tennessee
problem. Virginia Tech remains vulnerable to a late Tennessee rush
and possible sentiment in the writers and coaches polls that a
two-point loss at Florida shouldn't cost the Vols so dearly in
comparison to a team that played a lesser schedule.
</P>
<P>
   In another scenario, Florida beats Florida State, then loses to
a team with at least one loss in the SEC title game. That could
create a Virginia Tech-Tennessee meeting in the Sugar Bowl if each
is able to win out.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Kansas State: &LR;  The Wildcats continue to be shunned because of a
creampuff non-conference schedule, and Saturday's struggle against
Colorado didn't help their image. Even so, Bill Snyder's team can
make people sit up and take notice with a big finish. K-State
already has a win over rising Texas and a date with Nebraska to
come. The Cats could blow into the Big 12 Championship Game, whip
up on the Longhorns again and make the case that an unbeaten team
from a good conference has to be worthy of a look.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Nebraska: &LR;  Sixth in the coaches poll and seventh among the
writers, the Cornhuskers need plenty of help. Wins over K-State and
a Big 12 title victory in a rematch with Texas probably won't be
enough.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Mississippi State:  &LR; What are these guys doing unbeaten? Well,
schedule helps, for one thing, since Jackie Sherrill's Bulldogs
didn't have to play Tennessee or Florida this year. That's good for
the record, not so hot for schedule strength, making MSU a long,
long shot at best.
</P>
<P>
   For now, everybody is waiting to see who's in the Sugar. After
that, the other BCS bowls revert to traditional tie-ins, with
wiggle room for avoiding rematches or creating more attractive
games.
</P>
<P>
   Six conferences _ the Atlantic Coast, Big East, Big Ten, Big 12,
Southeastern and Pac 10 _ all have automatic bids, leaving room for
two at-large entries.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech was looking good for one of the at-large spots
before losing over the weekend to Virginia. The Big Ten runner-up _
either Penn State or Wisconsin _ may have moved to the front, but
the Nittany Lions will need to win at least one of their last two
(home against Michigan, at Michigan State) to qualify.
</P>
<P>
   If the Lions win both, they're going to the Rose, and Wisconsin
becomes an attractive at-large with a likely Heisman Trophy winner
in Ron Dayne.
</P>
<P>
   One possible shakeout:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Sugar:  &LR; Florida (SEC) vs. Tennessee (at-large): Everybody but
Steve Spurrier would love to see a sequel.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Fiesta:  &LR; Nebraska (Big 12) vs. Wisconsin (at-large):
Cornhuskers give the BCS another excuse to ignore Kansas State.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Orange:  &LR; Florida State (ACC) vs. Virginia Tech (Big East):
Could be the best game of the bunch.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Rose:  &LR; Penn State (Big Ten) vs. Washington (Pac-10): The bloom
is off the Rose this year, since Penn State will consider this a
consolation prize and Washington would be the best of a sorry West
Coast lot.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, everything looked different just a week ago and
could very well change again this week.
</P>
<P>
   For now, it's adios to JoePa and Joe Hamilton, and welcome back
to the likes of the Gators and Volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   Never a dull moment. And if you need an endorsement that this
isn't such a bad thing, just ask the folks in Knoxville how it
feels to be back in the hunt.

<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. _ A federal grand jury has been hearing
evidence for more than a year in a 1963 racist bombing that killed
four black girls in a downtown Birmingham church.
</P>
<P>
   In Louisiana, the wife of one of the first black deputy sheriffs
in a small parish met last month with a prosecutor who recently
began re-examining the 1965 killing of her husband in an ambush.
</P>
<P>
   And in Mississippi, a white man pleaded guilty this summer, and
three others are to go on trial this week, in the 1970 killing of a
black sharecropper who was beaten and found dead in a rural river.
</P>
<P>
   Across the South, these and other unresolved, racially motivated
killings of blacks from the civil rights era are under new
scrutiny. This fresh round of investigations into the long-ago
killings, many of which had been ignored by authorities for years,
was inspired by the well-publicized conviction in 1994 of an aging
white defendant in the 1963 assassination of the Mississippi civil
rights leader Medgar Evers.
</P>
<P>
   For years, black community leaders and relatives of victims had
complained about the lack of action in both the higher-profile and
the lesser-known of these cases. But recently their urgings have
been taken more seriously, experts and historians say, because the
South's political, social and legal climate has changed
significantly since the era of the killings.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks have steadily gained political power and have pushed for
these cases to be heard before today's racially diverse juries. At
the same time, more witnesses, perhaps with less fear of
retaliation and with heavy consciences they want to unburden, are
coming forward.
</P>
<P>
   And a new breed of prosecutors and investigators, feeling an
urgency as many witnesses and defendants in the cases grow old, is
realizing the important role that resolving these cases can play in
the South's efforts to move beyond its past of racial hate and
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the South, we now have a black constituency that has
political clout, and a white constituency that is not against these
hatemongers being brought to justice,'' said David Sansing,
professor emeritus of history at the University of Mississippi.
``And the black constituency, emboldened by new-found political
power, is saying, `Justice delayed is justice denied, so let's quit
denying this justice.' Surprisingly, they are being met with
sympathy from district attorneys.''
</P>
<P>
   At least seven of these long-dormant cases are currently being
re-examined in the South. A few are before grand juries or are
being prosecuted. But some have only just begun to be
reinvestigated and have had little national attention.
</P>
<P>
   The officials pursuing these cases are mostly Southern and
mostly white. Most are in their mid-40s to early 50s. A few have
childhood memories of the crimes and of the violent reaction of the
Ku Klux Klan to school integration and black voter registration.
But they all share some sense that the decades-old cases are still
a stumbling block to the South's progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``These prosecutors,'' Sansing said, ``are realizing that
they've got to do it now, rather than leave it unsettled forever.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, U.S. Attorney Doug Jones, 45, a Birmingham native,
was 9 when Birmingham's 16th Street Baptist Church, a center for
civil rights activity in the 1960s, was bombed, killing the four
girls. As a law student in 1977 he skipped classes for a week to
watch Bill Baxley, who was the Alabama attorney general,
successfully prosecute the Klan leader Robert Chambliss for murder
in the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Baxley chose not to prosecute other suspects at that time, in
the hope that better cases could be developed against them later.
When Jones became a U.S. attorney in 1997, he pushed for the
current grand jury investigation of others named in FBI files as
suspects in the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be able to get back and reopen the case, and let the
community know that it's not forgotten, that's important for
everybody,'' Jones said. ``If you can bring it to closure, everyone
can finish the healing process.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reason the climate is better for pursuing these cases
today, said Morris Dees, executive director of the Southern Poverty
Law Center in Montgomery, Ala., is that the FBI, which investigated
some of the cases when they occurred, is more cooperative than it
was 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In the Birmingham case, for example, documents show that J.
Edgar Hoover, who was then the FBI director, prevented bureau
agents from meeting with prosecutors to present the voluminous
evidence they had collected. Now it is the bureau that is leading
the new investigation, along with Jones' office.
</P>
<P>
   The re-examination of the Birmingham bombing was a result of
meetings between local black religious and community leaders and
local bureau officials in the mid-1990s. Officials close to the
case now would not discuss specific evidence, but have said there
are no new suspects, only new information. Still, there are hints
at the direction in which the case is going.
</P>
<P>
   Of the three other suspects named in the original FBI report,
two are living: Tommy Blanton Jr. in Birmingham and Bobby Frank
Cherry in Texas. According to a book on the bombing, ``Until
Justice Rolls Down,'' by a Birmingham News reporter, Frank Sikora,
witnesses quoted in FBI files had named Cherry as the one who
placed the bomb at the church. Blanton was said to have owned a car
linked to the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Both men have maintained their innocence. The bureau interviewed
Cherry recently and some members of his family have appeared before
the grand jury hearing the case.
</P>
<P>
   Also appearing before the grand jury this summer were two white
supremacists J.B. Stoner and Robert Shelton. Stoner was convicted
in another church bombing in Birmingham and shared a prison cell
with Chambliss.
</P>
<P>
   Federal civil rights charges were used in the 1960s to convict a
few suspects in these kinds of slayings, but the statute of
limitations on those charges has run out in the Birmingham case as
well as in all the other cases from that time.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said that his office was looking into using a federal law
with no statute of limitations concerning the transport of dynamite
in the bombing. He said there is also a possibility of using state
murder charges, which have no statute of limitations, as was done
in 1977 against Chambliss.
</P>
<P>
   But murder was the charge in the successful conviction in 1994
in Jackson, Miss., of the former Klansman, Byron De La Beckwith,
who shot to death Evers, the field secretary of the Mississippi
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, . The
conviction came after two prosecutions of Beckwith ended in
mistrials in the 1960s. The case inspired the film ``Ghosts of
Mississippi.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Medgar Evers case was a wedge in the dam,'' said Dees of
the law center, which keeps track of hate crimes and first called
attention to many of the unresolved killings with racial links.
``It gave everyone a tremendous amount of hope.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   That hope helped to stir the call for reopening the Birmingham
case. It also prompted the family of Vernon Dahmer in Mississippi
to push for a trial in his 1966 killing. In 1998, a former Klan
leader, Sam Bowers, was convicted of the fire-bombing murder of
Dahmer, the Hattiesburg NAACP president.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by those successes, other families have begun pushing
in the past year for answers in some of the lesser-known, long-ago
slayings linked to race. ``The South is still in the process of a
cleansing moment with these cases,'' said Myrlie Evers-Williams,
66, widow of Medgar Evers and chairwoman emeritus of the NAACP.
``I'm so thankful that others who have suffered the same injustice
as we did have moved forth. To see that pebble dropped in the water
and the ripples go out says something about justice in this
country. There is still hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, not everyone is happy that these cases are back in the
public spotlight. Many prosecutors said they had been asked over
and over why they wanted to stir up trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll hear it from white people on the golf course,'' said Bob
Helfrich, 45, the assistant district attorney in Hattiesburg who
prosecuted Bowers and plans to prosecute Charles Noble, another man
charged in the Dahmer case, next spring. ``They say, `Haven't we
spent enough money on this?' I have blacks tell me not to mess with
this, too. It is costly. But you can't put a price on justice.''
</P>
<P>
   In Birmingham, at a recent ceremony at the 16th Street Church
commemorating the victims of the bombing, police officers stood
guard outside. The church's pastor, the Rev. Christopher Hamlin,
said such vigilance is necessary because the church has continued
to receive bomb threats, especially in the three years since the
case was reopened.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street from the church, on a recent sunny day, Ronald
Roscoe, 47, a heating and air-conditioning technician, who is
black, was spending his lunch break in Kelly Ingram Park, near the
church's memorial to the four girls killed in the bombing. A city
gardener using a leaf blower reminded Roscoe of the images from
three decades ago of police officers wielding fire hoses in the
park to disperse civil rights protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the reopening of the bombing case, Roscoe said:
``It's a waste of time. I wish them luck, but after all this time I
don't believe the guys who did the bombing are ever going to be
convicted.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, Shane Buggay, 32, an orthopedic surgeon, who is white,
disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they can get them, then those men should pay,'' Buggay
said. ``Time has nothing to do with it. They are still trying to
convict Nazis for war crimes from World War II. It is just like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   But not all of the recently resurrected cases in the South have
resulted in convictions.
</P>
<P>
   In Belzoni, Miss., this summer one suspect was acquitted in the
1970 slaying of Rainey Pool, a one-armed sharecropper. Another man,
Joe Oliver Watson, pleaded guilty to manslaughter in the case this
summer and is awaiting sentencing. Three others are set to go on
trial Wednesday on charges of murdering Pool.
</P>
<P>
   In Montgomery, earlier this year, a grand jury failed to indict
two suspects, both former Klansmen, in the 1957 slaying of Willie
Edwards Jr., a black truck driver.
</P>
<P>
   And officials in Philadelphia, Miss., despite urging from the
families of the victims, are not saying publicly whether they are
investigating or will try to prosecute in state court any of the 18
men indicted on federal civil rights charges in the slaying of
three civil rights workers there in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Seven of those 18 were convicted on federal charges, including
Bowers, but none has ever been tried by the state for the
Philadelphia killings.
</P>
<P>
   Baxley, the former Alabama attorney general who prosecuted the
Birmingham bombing case in 1977, said some of the same problems he
encountered 20 years ago still exist. For instance, he said his
main concern in 1977 was to show the jury that Chambliss, by then a
frail 74-year-old, was once capable of killing four children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It worried me,'' Baxley said, ``that they would look at him
and think how could this old man be a threat to anybody. So we had
to let the jury see that this is not a harmless old grandfather or
uncle. They had to see the evil in this man.''
</P>
<P>
   Other major impediments to getting convictions are aging
witnesses with failing memories, or key witnesses who have already
died. In some of the slayings, no case files exist and no
transcripts from trials on federal charges exist, as they do in
better-known cases like the Evers slaying, the killings of the
Philadelphia, Miss., rights workers and the Birmingham church
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Another hurdle in the Birmingham case in 1977 was that people
remained afraid of retaliation from the Klan. Two major witnesses,
whose testimony Baxley believed might have helped convict others in
the bombing, refused to testify.
</P>
<P>
   These days, some of that fear persists, but it is far less
potent. In the Birmingham case this summer, the third of Cherry's
five wives told reporters before her grand jury testimony that
Cherry had admitted his involvement in the bombing and had bragged
about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not all people remain the same all through their lives,'' said
Joseph Lewis, 47, head of the Birmingham division of the FBI, which
has been investigating the case since 1996. ``When they are getting
close to their final days, they may say, `Well, it's time to clear
my conscience before I meet my maker.' That's what you hope for in
cases like this.''

SENATE HEARINGS TO OFFER VIEW INTO PRIVATE BANKING 
</HEADLINE>
  
(EXCLUSIVE; 10:45 p.m. ET EMBARGO for print media; 12:01 a.m. ET
EMBARGO for electronic media.) (sw) 
 By JEFF GERTH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In 1997, federal bank examiners were pressing
executives at Citibank Private Bank to explain the source of more
than $50 million deposited into a secret account controlled by the
president of Gabon, Omar Bongo, bank and Senate documents show.
</P>
<P>
   Citibank profiles said Bongo's wealth was created as ``a result
of his position'' and ``donations'' from a French oil company doing
business in he African nation, according to the documents. But a
draft report by Democratic Senate investigators found that in
responding to regulators, Citibank produced a new profile showing
other sources of wealth _ information the report says is inaccurate
and unverified.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Citibank's handling of private accounts like Bongo's
will be the subject of Senate hearings. The Senate Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations is examining the vulnerability of
private banking to money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, billions of dollars have left fragile
economies, from Russia to Mexico, facilitated by Western bankers.
The Senate hearings, whose witnesses will include Citibank
executives and federal regulators, will offer the first detailed
public look at one of the most secretive parts of the global
financial system, private banking, in which wealthy customers are
afforded extra discretion and care. The hearings come at a time
when previously acceptable practices in private banking are
undergoing new scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Bongo's account is one of several the Senate is investigating
that are tied to prominent foreign political leaders or their
families, in Mexico, Venezuela, Nigeria and Pakistan as well as
Gabon. Citibank's private banking clients included such
controversial figures as the sons of Gen. Sani Abacha, the Nigerian
dictator; Raul Salinas de Gortari, the brother of Mexico's former
president, and Asif Ali Zadari, the husband of former Prime
Minister Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, federal examiners were looking at whether Bongo's
transactions should be reported as suspicious. American law bans
banks from moving money earned abroad from some crimes, like drug
trafficking, but not corruption. A central tenet of banking is to
know your customer, and banks are required to report certain
suspicious transactions to regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the committee's staff report notes, ``there is currently no
statutory, regulatory or industry guidance of what is adequate due
diligence.''
</P>
<P>
   So in 1997 the regulators felt reassured after Citibank
officials told them that Bongo's transactions ``are normal for the
head of state of an African country,'' according to portions of the
examiners' report quoted by Senate investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Bongo's profile had been revised in 1997 to say his wealth
stemmed primarily from government budgeted accounts and personal
oil investments in Gabon and other African countries. Senate
investigators, however, found the explanations unverified and, in
the first case, ``implausible and plainly contrary to Gabon's
budget policy and actual spending,'' the draft report says.
</P>
<P>
   Citibank documents show that bank officials were aware of news
reports that Bongo was under investigation for possibly accepting
bribes from French oil executives, but they were reluctant to raise
those reports with Bongo or regulators, according to the draft
report.
</P>
<P>
   Bongo has not been charged with any wrongdoing. A spokesman for
the Gabon Embassy in Washington declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   A Citibank spokesman said bank officials believed Bongo's wealth
came from legitimate sources and that he had been ``considered a
distinguished head of government, supported and embraced by U.S.
presidents.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Citibank has moved to close Bongo's account, one of
40,000 at Citibank Private Bank. Citibank estimates that only 350
of the private bank's customers are public officials or their
families.
</P>
<P>
   The closing of Bongo's account follows moves by the bank's
senior management to tighten supervision of sensitive accounts and
to keep the bank from being used for improper purposes.
</P>
<P>
   John Reed, the chairman and co-chief executive of Citigroup, the
parent of Citibank, is expected to tell the Senate committee about
Citibank's new measures against money laundering and a policy
adopted last year to shy away from targeting public figures as
private bank clients, according to people familiar with his
prepared testimony. He is also expected to discuss how regulators
now find significant improvements in the private bank's internal
controls.
</P>
<P>
   The Citibank documents make clear the potential pitfalls for one
of the world's most powerful and prestigious financial
institutions. The Senate inquiry is such a sensitive matter for
Citigroup that it hired two former senior White House lawyers, C.
Boyden Gray of the Bush administration and Jane Sherburne of the
Clinton administration, to help the bank prepare and respond.
</P>
<P>
   One Senate investigator said that Citibank had once lobbied to
have a 1992 check for $1 million from Libya to a Bongo account
offshore unfrozen by the U.S. government, contending that Citibank
could lose its business in Gabon if the payment remained frozen by
anti-terrorism statutes.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Musi, the chief compliance officer for Citibank Private
Bank, said, ``The Private Bank never has had a strategy to link
efforts to get or retain a head of state's personal business in
order to develop other business in that country.'' He added that
Citibank's business in Gabon is ``extremely small'' and unaffected
by the decision to close the Bongo account.

 WASHINGTON: Bongo account.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   But Raymond Baker, a guest scholar at the Brookings Institution
who is scheduled to testify at the hearings, worries that when
Western banks help the powerful elite in less developed countries
hide their wealth _ some of which may be ill gotten _ they undercut
the efforts by Western governments and entities like the
International Monetary Fund to help the economies of those poorer
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is Western taxpayers who are paying it out over the table
to these countries and the private banks who take it back under the
table,'' Baker said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   He is concerned that Western banks that move corrupt money out
of poorer countries may aid the client in committing crimes like
tax evasion, illegal capital flight and false trade invoicing, all
of which fall outside the reach of American money laundering
statutes. But this movement of money, Baker added, sucks $100
billion per year out of poorer countries.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the interest in Citibank Private Bank stems from
its involvement with Salinas. Reed is expected to tell the Senate
panel that the bank has learned a lot from the now well-known
Salinas affair, even though it has never been cited for any legal
or regulatory violations.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1992 and 1994 the bank moved between $80 million and
$100 million through Salinas' accounts, using extra confidential
methods that the General Accounting Office, the audit arm of
Congress, later found ``disguised'' the ``origin, destination and
beneficial owner of the funds.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed will tell the committee that while Citibank failed then to
follow its own policy, it now has much tougher rules.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate panel turned up some new details in the Salinas case,
including transcripts of phone calls between Citibank officials.
After Salinas' arrest in 1995 on murder charges _ he was later
convicted of participating in the murder of his former
brother-in-law _ the initial reaction of Citibank was to see
whether his money could be shifted to Switzerland to make it more
difficult for law enforcement officials to discover his assets,
according to Senate aides. This idea was rejected, the aides said,
when it was discovered that bank records in London and the United
States, which could not be destroyed, would point to the Swiss
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The committee has also examined the case of Zadari, a former
senator in Pakistan. Zadari, currently in jail on corruption
charges, had about $40 million in Citibank Private Bank in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   The bank has not been accused of wrongdoing, but internal
Citibank audits as well as audits by federal bank examiners
continually criticized managerial deficiencies in Citibank Private
Bank in Switzerland, Senate documents show.
</P>
<P>
   Those audits and the investigation of the Salinas money led Reed
to write Citibank's board of directors in November 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in a world where we have to worry about `how someone
made his/her money,' which did not used to be an issue,'' according
to portions of the letter excerpted in the Democratic draft report.
``Much that we had done to keep Private Banking private becomes
`wrong' in the current environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Another case study in the Senate inquiry involves the accounts
of two of Abacha's sons _ one of whom, Muhammad, has just been
charged in Nigeria with the murder of the wife of his father's
leading opponent.
</P>
<P>
   The New York private banker for the Nigerian account _ the same
person who handled Bongo's account _ told staff investigators that
for three years he thought his clients were Nigerian businessmen
rather than the sons of Nigeria's military leader, the staff report
says.
</P>
<P>
   When Abacha died unexpectedly in June 1998, the Nigerian
government began looking into his family's wealth and billions of
dollars of missing money. With the corruption inquiry under way,
Citibank got a request from one of Abacha's sons, saying they
urgently needed $39 million from their London account, records
show. But the money was in a time deposit that could not be
redeemed for a while without a financial penalty, the staff report
says.
</P>
<P>
   Citibank had long accommodated the Abacha family by setting up
accounts with secret names like Gelsobella and Chinquinto. So the
private bank found a way to immediately transfer the $39 million
and avoid the penalty, documents show.
</P>
<P>
   Citibank records one month later say the transfer was meant to
be the first step in the closing of the account by the client.
</P>
<P>
   But last March, before the account could be closed, a London
court issued an order in a civil suit freezing all accounts related
to Abacha.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup's lawyers have argued that the Senate committee is on
shaky jurisdictional grounds because American money laundering
statutes cover only proceeds of activities in foreign countries
that fall under three categories of offenses: certain drug crimes,
certain violent crimes, and fraud by or against a foreign bank,
according to a letter last month to the committee from Gray.
</P>
<P>
   The letter goes on to say that the Democratic staff believes
that money in the accounts of Bongo, Abacha's sons and Jaime
Lusinchi, the former president of Venezuela, may have been
``derived from corruption or other improper acts against a foreign
government.'' Even if true, Gray says in the letter, these offenses
do not constitute crimes in the United States and thus fall outside
the committee's jurisdiction.

   MICROSOFT FINDINGS LEAVE SOME FEELING AMBIVALENT
</P>
<P>
   In Silicon Valley, the nation's high-technology capital, Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson's powerful findings in the Microsoft
antitrust case have been received with a sense of vindication but
also ambivalence.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the judge found, there is a ``Microsoft problem'' in the
computer business, and the company's tactics hurt consumers and
undermine innovation. A solution to the problem is likely, but the
industry is also not entirely comfortable with the government
determining the course of its future.
SCORES, HIGHLIGHTS AND FOOD, TOO
</P>
<P>
   The ESPN sports empire has spawned six domestic cable television
networks and 20 more networks worldwide, a magazine, an Internet
service, books, videos, games, a radio network, music, pagers and
pay-per-view programming. After two decades of feeding sports fans
scores and highlights, the company decided the time had come to
feed them full of food and beer. In mid-September, the biggest,
glitziest ESPN Zone restaurant opened in Manhattan on Broadway, not
far from other outposts of Walt Disney, which is transforming ESPN
into a three-dimensional entertainment complex. PATENT CALLS FOR
THROWAWAY PHONES
</P>
<P>
   A full-time inventor in New Jersey has patented a technology
that she says can be used to manufacture cellular phones so
inexpensively that they could be sold for a fixed amount of air
time _ as long-distance calling cards are _ and then tossed in the
garbage once their minutes have been used up.
EXPERIMENTS IN NEWSPAPER REVENUE
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper publishers have long tried experiments to increase
revenue. But every experiment entails a risk, which was underscored
recently by The Los Angeles Times, where staff members protested an
arrangement with the Staples sports center to share profits from a
recent Sunday magazine issue devoted to it. Though the rebellion
may make publishers more careful, newspapers are not going to stop
the experiments.
BANKS CONSIDER BID FOR NATWEST
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Bank of Scotland is negotiating with the Spanish bank
Banco Santander Central Hispano about possibly making a joint bid
for National Westminster Bank, executives close to the talks said.
IBM ASKS, WHO OWNS WEB DATA?
</P>
<P>
   On the Internet, some of the most valuable information is data
about customer behavior. Web site publishers, advertising agencies
and companies who buy ads have relied heavily on that data to build
their businesses, and until now they have been generous about
sharing it. Now IBM, one of the Web's biggest advertisers, is
raising the question of whether that data belongs to anyone but the
advertisers.
CREDIBILITY SCARCE ON INTERNET
</P>
<P>
   Although the future of online commerce will rely on credibility,
companies continue to squander the public's trust. The Web looks a
lot like a computer version of print or broadcast media. But as a
rule, it has not adopted the kinds of standards and practices that
are assumed in traditional media, where advertisements and paid
announcements are labeled and conflicts of interest are, at least
in theory, disclosed as a matter of course. Digital Commerce.
YANKEE GROUP FOUNDER TO STEP DOWN

   Howard Anderson, who practically invented the technology
consulting industry when he founded Yankee Group Research Inc. in
1970, is stepping down from day-to-day responsibilities to start a

RELATIVES HOLD MEMORIAL SERVICE FOR EGYPTAIR CRASH VICTIMS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I. _ One week after EgyptAir Flight 990 mysteriously
plunged into the Atlantic from 33,500 feet, relatives bid a sad,
final goodbye to the 217 victims Sunday at a wind-swept park here
overlooking the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Even as those who lost loved ones hugged, wept and placed
flowers at the water's edge in a moving memorial, the U.S. Navy was
far out at sea preparing a second deep-diving drone to help recover
the jet's two black boxes that are the key to finding out what went
wrong aboard the Boeing 767-300.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Hall, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board,
said the second submersible robot, Magnum, is more maneuverable
than Deep Drone and can be used in rougher seas. It is being
carried aboard the civilian ship Carolyn Chouest.
</P>
<P>
   The USS Grapple, which is the mother ship for Deep Drone,
returned to Newport on Sunday for refueling before heading back out
to the crash site with the drone.
</P>
<P>
   Rough seas have limited efforts since Friday by Deep Drone to
recover the black boxes that investigators hope will give them
their first solid clues to why the Boeing 767 crashed without any
distress call from the pilots.
</P>
<P>
   With calmer seas forecast for Monday, both drones are expected
to be used. Deep Drone has zeroed in on electronic signals emitted
from the two black boxes, but has not seen them. The Navy believes
the boxes, which are about 15 feet apart, could be buried in mud or
under pieces of airplane debris scattered on the ocean bottom.
</P>
<P>
   The water is about 250 feet deep, and Hall said it would be too
risky to use divers.
</P>
<P>
   So for now, frustrated investigators can only hope that Deep
Drone and its more capable reinforcement can recover the voice and
data recorders which have been on the ocean bottom for one week.
</P>
<P>
   Though the focus of the investigation has been the hunt for
those boxes, recovery operations were overshadowed Sunday by the
emotional memorial service, held on a cold, clear afternoon at
Brenton Point State Park overlooking the Atlantic Ocean. The
service was closed to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Many Newport residents stood along downtown streets to pay their
respects as 14 buses carrying about 250 family members slowly made
their way to the park from a waterfront hotel where they have been
housed.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the memorial, leaders of the Jewish, Christian
and Islamic faiths offered readings, chants and prayers in three
languages.
</P>
<P>
   The memorial service was held in a large tent facing the ocean.
At the head table were flags of the United States, Egypt, Canada,
Syria, Sudan, Germany and Zimbabwe, representing the nationalities
of the victims.
</P>
<P>
   As the service ended, relatives were led to the water through a
corridor formed by military personnel and caregivers including
workers from the Red Cross, NTSB and Salvation Army.
</P>
<P>
   Some dropped flowers into the sea, while others placed flowers
in a wicker basket that later was taken away by a military
helicopter. On Monday, the helicopter will drop the flower basket
at the crash site off the Massachusetts coast. The moment will be
videotaped and copies sent to the relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives also were given bottles of sea water from the ocean
where their loved ones now rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your loss is great, your pain deep, but you must find solace
in the memory of those wonderful moments you shared with your loved
ones,'' said Egyptian Ambassador Nebil Fahmy, who read from the
Bible and the Koran.
</P>
<P>
   During the service, several of the relatives wailed
uncontrollably.
</P>
<P>
   One woman could be heard screaming, ``My baby, my baby!''
</P>
<P>
   After the hour-long memorial, four buses carried family members
to the Providence airport where they boarded a plane to take them
back to Cairo. EgyptAir Flight 990 was headed to the Egyptian
capital when it suddenly went down 30 minutes after taking off from
Kennedy Airport in New York.

HACKETT SAFE _ FOR NOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There was a telling moment during the postgame
press conference of USC's 26-16 loss to Arizona State, when coach
Paul Hackett talked about how close the Trojans were to winning the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes down to four minutes left and being down by three
points against a good team,'' Hackett said. ``That's what you hope
for.''
</P>
<P>
   A 5-4 Arizona State team being described as ``good'' might gall
impartial observers. But imagine the reaction today from the USC
diehards because the coach was pleased to be within three points in
the final minutes against a then-.500 team.
</P>
<P>
   Remarks like that helped get Larry Smith fired seven years ago.
And for the rest of this forgettable season, the speculation will
increase about Hackett's future.
</P>
<P>
   Today, as USC sits 3-6, the job-security issue is fairly
foolish. Hackett is in the second year of his five-year contract,
and while athletic director Mike Garrett might vent from time to
time to friends, firing his chosen successor to John Robinson is
highly unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   At least this year.
</P>
<P>
   Most people also forget that a final decision comes from school
president Steven Sample and he is still smarting from the beating
his image took when Robinson was fired two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Sample, more than anyone else, will want to stay the course for
one more year. He gave Robinson another year after USC went 6-6 in
1996 and would simply hate the idea that he is viewed as a
quick-trigger by firing Hackett. Besides, he and Garrett would look
incredibly foolish by sacking Hackett two seasons after they hired
him.
</P>
<P>
   It also comes down to credibility. Which coaches would want to
come work at USC knowing they would be given a two-year trial
period?
</P>
<P>
   This is not to be viewed as an endorsement of Hackett, just a
reality check.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the same cannot be said for the coaching staff. You can bet
there will be changes next season, even if it just comes down to
someone choosing to leave for another job.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is meant as an excuse for whatever shortcomings
Hackett might have. Truthfully, the Trojan program is in as much or
more turmoil today as at any point of Robinson's reign.
</P>
<P>
   There is no single area that can be spotlighted as the source of
the Trojans' woes. Quarterback John Fox wasn't the answer, although
it was perplexing why he started the game just to be quickly pulled
after one half. That's not much of a tryout when you've gathered
dust for two years.
</P>
<P>
   But the handling of Fox is an indication of the desperation
surrounding the program. This team might equal the six-game losing
streak of the 1991 Trojans, but it is far more talented.
</P>
<P>
   Who would take Reggie Perry at quarterback over Fox or Mike Van
Raaphorst? Thank you.
</P>
<P>
   That is why this season has turned into such an embarrassment.
It's not just about losing, it's about underachievement. And it
might get a lot worse. USC has the possibility of suffering its
longest losing streak in school history if it drops its next two
games.
</P>
<P>
   That is an astounding fact if you consider this could be one of
the easiest schedules ever, since USC is not expected to play a
ranked team this season.
</P>
<P>

Marcell Allmond sprained his shoulder and is also doubtful. &QL;

John Fox threw an interception, but what else could you expect
after two years off? Mike Van Raaphorst is not built to be a

Chad Morton gained 76 yards but did not get a single carry in the
fourth quarter. And why did Jabari Jackson get the ball on
third-and-4? &QL; 
C &QL; 
RECEIVERS &QL; 
Kareem Kelly was used as a decoy, R. Jay Soward had a critical drop
and Windrell Hayes eased to the sideline instead of diving for the
first-down marker. &QL;

OFFENSIVE LINE &QL; 
Can you believe that there were no quarterback sacks allowed? On
the other hand, Arizona State created enough pressures to force bad
passes. &QL; 
D+ &QL; 
DEFENSIVE LINE &QL; 
J.R. Redmond sliced through the line with ease and Ryan Kealy
didn't take much heat. But Ennis Davis' interception provided the
game's only interesting moment. &QL; 
D+ &QL; 
LINEBACKERS &QL; 
Someone forgot to cover TE Todd Heap on his touchdown reception,
and they weren't much better than the line against Redmond. No
dropoff at LB this season? Remember Chris Claiborne knocked Kealy
out of last year's game. &QL; 
D &QL; 
DEFENSIVE BACKS &QL; 
Whenever Arizona State needed a big pass play, it got it. After the
linebackers proved they couldn't cover Heap, the secondary failed
in its try. &QL; 
D- &QL; 
SPECIAL TEAMS &QL; 
Apparently, USC is going to idly accept its kicking woes, as David
Newbury missed a field goal and extra point. At least Antuan
Simmons blocked a kick. &QL;

COACHING &QL; 
What was all the fuss about starting John Fox, if he only got to
play one half? Two more 12-men-on-the-field penalties were
inexcusable. Is it too late to cancel the Louisiana Tech game? &QL;

TOUGHER ROBOT JOINING SEARCH AT CRASH SITE
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT NAVAL STATION, R.I. _ It uses sonar for ears and video
cameras for eyes. Its titanium arms have joints in seven places,
its wrists can spin 360 degrees and it can dive more than a mile
and a half in rough seas to grasp things from the ocean floor.
</P>
<P>
   It is Magnum, a heavy-duty yellow underwater robot that was
installed on a Navy support ship here Sunday as it prepared to take
its turn trying to retrieve the so-called black boxes of EgyptAir
Flight 990 from waters 50 miles south of Nantucket.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators hope Magnum will succeed in the harsh weather that
has thwarted its predecessor, a robot called Deep Drone. High seas
and whipping winds kept Deep Drone on deck and sent its Navy ship,
Grapple, back to port Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   National Transportation Safety Board Chairman James Hall said he
hoped Magnum could be in the water by Monday afternoon after being
sailed to the site aboard the support ship Carolyn Chouest. The
Grapple and Deep Drone will follow when weather permits, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators hope that the boxes, which hold the plane's
cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder, will help explain
why the Boeing 767 crashed on Oct. 31, killing all 217 aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Two factors allow Magnum to withstand heavier weather than Deep
Drone. The first is its protective steel cage. The second is the
Carolyn Chouest, which has thrusters that enable it to float in a
fixed spot without dropping anchor. On Saturday, heavy surf made it
difficult for the Grapple to stay anchored, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Magnum, which is about the size of a minivan, weighs 8,000
pounds with its cage. Both will be sent down to about 20 feet from
the bottom of the sea. Then two operators aboard the ship will
steer Magnum out of the cage, sending it commands through a
10,000-foot-long umbilical cord.
</P>
<P>
   The robot will be guided by the pinging sound emitted by devices
attached to the black boxes. But officials caution that the pingers
may have been separated from the boxes during the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said the boxes appeared to be buried under wreckage, which
might be too difficult for the robots to maneuver through. And
officials now believe it is too dangerous to send divers into a
field of small, jagged pieces that could cut their air tubes.

MOSS, SANDERS READY FOR DUEL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Sitting at his locker last week at the Cowboys'
Valley Ranch training complex, cornerback Deion Sanders allowed
himself to drift back to days gone by.
</P>
<P>
   It was the time of Wyatt Earp and Billy the Kid, when men were
defined by their reputation as a gunslinger. Challengers would
journey miles to try their hand against the fastest gun.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders said the Old West is not much different than that island
he has roamed on a weekly basis for the past 11 years as arguably
the best cover cornerback in league history. It's against him that
unknown receivers seek to make a name for themselves and
established guys hope to stamp their greatness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody gets motivated to beat the man on top,'' Sanders
said. ``Because of my reputation, guys want to make a name for
themselves by beating me. That's comes with being on top. It's been
like that for years. I'm the fastest gun out here.''
</P>
<P>
   So far in 1999, it's seemingly high noon every week for the
perennial All-Pro Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, he rebutted a challenge from the trash-talking
Redskins receiver duo of Albert Connell and Michael Westbrook. Last
week, he suffered a setback of sorts when he was burned for a
40-yard touchdown reception by Marvin Harrison of the Colts. It was
the first long touchdown pass he has giving up in four seasons with
the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   However, those were preliminary battles compared to what's set
to take place in the Metrodome tonight when the Cowboys (4-3) face
the Vikings (4-4).
</P>
<P>
   All that's missing from the made-for-television ``Monday Night
Football'' showdown between Sanders and Vikings receiver Randy
Moss, who in just his second season has supplanted Jerry Rice as
the league's most feared receiver, is promoter Don King.
</P>
<P>
   Finally: The Latest (Moss) Vs. the Greatest (Sanders).
</P>
<P>
   Fans were deprived of the matchup last season, as a toe injury
kept Sanders off the field in the Vikings' 46-36 blowout victory.
The then-rookie Moss lived up to his end of the bargain, catching
three passes _ all for touchdowns (51, 56 and 56 yards).
</P>
<P>
   Moss didn't talk after the game, saying later he had nothing to
say because of Sanders' absence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I was disappointed Deion didn't play. Until the time me
and Deion or the Vikings and Cowboys play, no one will know if he
goes out and makes me look bad. If he does, OK, Deion's the best.
If I go out and make Deion look bad, I'm the best. You're going to
hear that until we finally meet up.''
</P>
<P>
   Moss has been mum about the matchup in the days leading up to
the game. However, his seasonlong rhetoric clearly shows that he
has been gearing toward this game for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   Before an early-season matchup against Raiders cornerback
Charles Woodson, Moss said, ``I could see if it was Deion Sanders.
I'd be like, well OK, I'm a little shaky, I'm a little nervous
because it's Deion, but man \RWoodson\S is just another guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Moss, who spent time at Sanders' house before the 1998 draft,
has a healthy dose of admiration for Sanders' skill and flair.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's his passion and desire to go out there and showboat and
also show you he can still make it happen,'' Moss said. ``I think
that's what I respect most about Deion.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, who has been studying tape of the Vikings' star all
week, respects Moss as well. However, he said he refuses to get
caught up into the one-on-one matchup partly because Vikings
veterans Chris Carter and Jake Reed are tremendous threats as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randy Moss is a great player,'' Sanders said. ``But you can't
get into the one on ones. Neither one of us is going to get a win
or loss when we leave this game. This is a team thing. And when you
are talk about the Vikings, you are talking about three great
receivers _ Moss, Carter and Reed.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders points out that Moss, who has caught 35 passes for 553
yards and four touchdowns, has been less effective in 1999 because
teams have schemed to take away the deep ball. Carter has made up
for it with a team-leading 46 catches for 601 yards and five
touchdowns. Reed has caught 25 balls for 407 yards.
</P>
<P>
   And, there's some question as to how much Sanders will be
assigned to cover Moss. One aspect of the Cowboys' game plan will
be to double Moss and put Sanders on Carter. There will also be
times when he gets safety help.
</P>
<P>
   However, whenever Sanders gets Moss in bump-and-run coverage,
all eyes will be on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be exciting, that's for sure, with two great
players,'' Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said. ``It'll be interesting
to see how that unfolds. If I weren't so integrally involved in it,
it would be great as a fan to sit back and watch it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great for the league,'' Vikings coach Dennis Green said.
``I don't think there's any doubt. It's great for the fans. We're
not going to focus on that, though. We know that our agenda is to
try and win the game. We've won games when Randy has caught 10
balls. We've won games when Randy's caught one ball. I don't know
which one it's going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The latter is the biggest reason Sanders is trying to downplay
the matchup, as it's a no-win situation for him. If Moss doesn't
have a big game, it won't hurt his reputation and the Vikings can
still win.
</P>
<P>
   If Sanders has a bad game, the Cowboys will certainly lose and
his reputation will take another hit. Even though Harrison's
touchdown reception came as a result of a play fake, people are now
questioning whether Sanders has fully recovered from off-season toe
surgery that forced him to miss the first two games of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, 32, understands that he is judged on a different level
and that his legend, like a lot of gunslingers, is based more on
myth than reality. He also would have it no other way.
</P>
<P>
   ``What cornerback doesn't give up any receptions,'' Sanders
said. ``I know it hasn't happened to me a lot. But it's impossible
to shut everybody out. No other cornerback is held to that level
but me. I know its partly because of what I've done. I expect more
of myself that people expect of me. I welcome these challenges
because I'm going to be at the top of the mountain as long as I
play the game.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Franca Fiacconi felt the only way she could win
Sunday's New York City Marathon was to attack from the start.
Adriana Fernandez felt if she stayed with Fiacconi, she could break
her.
</P>
<P>
   Both were right: Fiacconi attacked, and Fernandez broke her and
won.
</P>
<P>
   Despite headwinds of 20 to 30 mph for much of the race,
Fernandez won in 2 hours 25 minutes 6 seconds. Only 23 women,
including Fernandez, have run a faster marathon. Fernandez's
performance was additionally impressive because this course, with
its sneaky hills, was more trying than such flat courses in
Rotterdam, the Netherlands, London and Chicago that usually produce
fast times.
</P>
<P>
   Fiacconi, the 34-year-old Italian who won in New York last year,
likes to run from the front and maybe steal the race. Fernandez,
the 28-year-old Mexican who was the runner-up last year, would not
let her, and she won by more than half a mile while Fiacconi faded
to fourth.
</P>
<P>
   One race official estimated that the winds made the times two
minutes slower. They were so strong at the start on the
Verrazano-Narrows Bridge that Fiacconi ran the first mile in 6:09,
by far the slowest mile of the race.
</P>
<P>
   In setting a Mexican record, Fernandez ran the second-fastest
time by a woman in the 30-year history of this race. Minutes after
the finish, she told a television interviewer: ``At places, the
wind almost stopped me. Without the wind, I probably would have
broken the course record.''
</P>
<P>
   The interviewer, Lisa Ondieki of Australia, nodded and smiled,
knowing that the New York record of 2:24:40 she set in 1992 would
live for at least another year.
</P>
<P>
   There were smiles from Fernandez, too, and not only because her
eighth career marathon had produced her second victory (she won in
1996 in Houston). In her previous two marathons, she finished
second in New York last year in 2:26:33 and second in London in
April in 2:24:06. That convinced her she could run with anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was second here last year,'' she said through a
translator, ``my confidence level went through the roof. This year,
I led for 21 miles in London. After that, I said I am no longer
going to run fast, but to win.''
</P>
<P>
   To help achieve that, she trained more this year in the
mountains of Toluca, Mexico, at 12,000-foot altitude. She is
coached by Rodolfo Gomez, the runner-up here in 1982 to Alberto
Salazar.
</P>
<P>
   Before the race, she was confident.
</P>
<P>
   ``My style of running is an intelligent one,'' she said. ``I'll
run according to how the race develops.''
</P>
<P>
   She knew Fiacconi had missed three key weeks of training after
breaking an elbow in August. She also knew Fiacconi would take out
the pace and put the burden on the others to stay with her.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez was ready. When the starting cannon finally sounded
after three or four false starts, Fiacconi took off and built a
lead as large as eight seconds, perhaps 40 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that if I let her go farther and open a bigger
gap,'' Fernandez said, ``she would gain confidence and maybe win
the race from the beginning. I decided to catch up with her, stay
with her and then make a push of my own.''
</P>
<P>
   Four miles into the 26.2-mile race through the city's five
boroughs, in Brooklyn, Fernandez caught up.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I did,'' Fernandez said, ``I felt very strong. I felt I
could win the race.''
</P>
<P>
   For most of the next 11 miles, Fernandez and Fiacconi ran side
by side. Occasionally, Fernandez would slip a stride or two ahead,
and Fiacconi would catch up. Nearing the 15-mile mark, approaching
the Queensboro Bridge, Fernandez ended the game of chicken.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to push harder,'' Fernandez said. She did,
Fiacconi could not respond, and soon Fernandez was the only person
in a surreal setting. No woman challenged her and no male runners
were nearby, and for long stretches Fernandez ran by herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised I was alone,'' she said, ``but I was
concentrating on my own pace and my own rhythm.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting there, she clicked off miles in 5:30, 5:37, 5:10, 5:15,
5:26, 5:34, 5:33, 5:25, 5:25 again, 5:30 and 5:28 as her lead
became larger and larger. She seemed to be running effortlessly;
Fiacconi was hurting, starting near the 15-mile mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't feeling any problems with the pace,'' Fiacconi said,
``but around 24 kilometers she pushed the pace and I was feeling a
problem with my left foot. So I let her go. I was not able to stay
with her. And at 30 kilometers, my elbow started to bother me.''
</P>
<P>
   Fiacconi drifted back and finished behind 27-year-old Catherine
Ndereba of Kenya (2:27:34), a two-time road runner of the year
competing in only her second marathon, and 38-year-old Katrin
Dorre-Heinig of Germany (2:28:41), running her 43rd marathon.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours after she finished in 2:29:49, Fiacconi was so cold
that she was wearing gloves indoors. She said she ran the race the
way she wanted to, except for her finishing place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be in front immediately,'' she said, ``to be
aggressive, to put immediate pressure on the field, not to wait for
anything. I knew when I came here that I was not 100 percent, but I
knew the course very well so I knew that in any case I can run
well.''
</P>
<P>
   She did not run that badly. Neither did Ndereba and
Dorre-Heinig.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard New York was the toughest course,'' Ndereba said, ``so
I am very much happy. Second place to me is like winning. People in
Central Park were yelling, `Looking good,' and I appreciate that.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorre-Heinig said she gave away any chance to win because ``the
margin between the first runner and me became too big.''
</P>
<P>
   At any time did she think she could win?
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the race, yes,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez thought the same for herself, and she became the first
Mexican woman to win here (three Mexican men have won). She will
leave with $50,000 in prize money, a $25,000 bonus for breaking
2:26, a $25,000 appearance fee and a Mazda Miata worth about
$25,000.
</P>
<P>
   She does not know how big a reception she will receive when she
returns to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Mexican soccer team wins,'' she said, ``the people
celebrate. I hope they do that for me for winning such an important
marathon.'' &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: 2 UNCERTAIN TEAMS ARE BLOWING IN THE WIND
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Let's say that last summer you won
tickets to the Arizona Cardinals versus the New York Jets Sunday at
Giants Stadium. Wow! The Jets breezed to the American Football
Conference championship game a year ago and the Cardinals relished
a sweet playoff victory at Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   You were excited because you would see one group (Jets) which
was a Super Bowl favorite and another (Cardinals) which should
knock again on the playoff door. You called your friends. You made
plans on that day to arrive at Giants Stadium early and to party
late.
</P>
<P>
   But plenty of awful karma happened between claiming your ticket
and settling in for Sunday's kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets lost their starting quarterback to injury and the
Cardinals did, too. The Jets entered with only one victory in seven
games, the Cardinals with two in seven games. Sunday, the teams
would score a total of 19 points in a slumbering, dreary, painful,
error-plagued experience.
</P>
<P>
   This was like winning a $500 gift certificate _ only to later
find that all selections must be made from the blue-light special
section at your corner dime store.
</P>
<P>
   It was like going to see a sexy, glitzy, cutting-edge concert
from the sensational, controversial rapper, Lil' Kim _ and, once
there, finding only video clips of Tiny Tim.
</P>
<P>
   Jets 12, Cardinals 7.
</P>
<P>
   Brrrrrrrrrrrr.
</P>
<P>
   It was supposed to be Vinny and the Jets against Jake the Snake.
</P>
<P>
   Vinny Testaverde, the wonder quarterback from last season,
against Jake Plummer, one of the National Football League's
brightest, rising stars.
</P>
<P>
   Instead it was Rick Mirer (Jets) versus Dave Brown (Cardinals).
</P>
<P>
   One player should not make a team and two players should not
make a game. This was, however, an excellent example of cutting off
the head and killing the body. The absence of Testaverde and
Plummer meant two laboring, uncertain teams.
</P>
<P>
   Blame it on the wind.
</P>
<P>
   Some tried. Now, it was windy at Giants Stadium. It whipped,
swirled and was at 20 miles per hour at game time and no doubt
gusted to higher numbers during the game. When either team had the
ball traveling West, it had the wind to its back and attempted to
use that to its passing advantage. It was tricky. But players on
both sides said that they had played in much worse conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The wind had little to do with the Jets' driving to the Arizona
27, 25 and 12 on three separate possessions and scoring only 3
points. It had nothing to do with Brown's completing a 71-yard pass
play early and then zilch for the rest of the game. Nothing to do
with Arizona allowing six sacks.
</P>
<P>
   And, certainly, little to do with one of the more comical plays
of the entire season.
</P>
<P>
   There was 2 minutes 22 seconds left and Arizona, trailing by
12-7, had the ball at its 25, intent on building a game-winning
drive. On a first-down play, Brown, in shotgun formation, was
stripped of the ball by Jets linebacker James Farrior. What
followed was a football folly, a bouncing ball slapped around by at
least six players. Finally, Arizona pounced on the loose ball at
its 6-yard line. (Mind you, this was a potential game-winning
drive.) Two plays later the Cardinals faced a fourth-and-43 from
their own 2. They punted and the Jets ran out the clock.
</P>
<P>
   Ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wind was making the ball shift in the kicking game,'' the
Jets' Bernie Parmalee said.
</P>
<P>
   Jets tackle Jumbo Elliott said: ``The wind was a dictating
factor in the game _ but it wasn't the whole story.''
</P>
<P>
   Credit Mirer, who was the better quarterback of the day, for an
apt summation: ``The wind affects some people more than others. The
wind and cold are part of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona _ which left 80-degree, nearly windless weather back
home _ led 7-3 at halftime and 7-6 with a little more than five
minutes to play. It simply blew it. Its pass defense let Keyshawn
Johnson slip behind it, against a three-deep zone with five men
underneath, and let him run 43 yards for a touchdown that proved
the game-winner. The Arizona offense for the entire second half had
shown it had already begun heading South. Or West, in this case.
After Johnson's catch and score, the game was over, right there.
</P>
<P>
   For Jets fans, thank goodness for Johnson. He gave them a thrill
just when it seemed everyone in Giants Stadium had fallen fast
asleep. He helped give the Jets their first victory in more than a
month, after three consecutive losses.
</P>
<P>
   Aeneas Williams is Arizona's premiere, pro-bowl cornerback. He
is a man of pristine vision. He sees the Jets and Cardinals, a
couple of 2-6 teams minus their starting quarterbacks. He sees the
truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wind in this game was not a factor in executing the
running game, making tackles and playing sound football,'' Williams
said. ``I see the Jets and I see a team that looks like it is still
hurting deeply over the loss of its quarterback but a team that is
still fighting and clawing. I don't know if they have the edge they
once had. They are fighting to not lose confidence. They have
suffered a huge drop in expectations. We haven't played a complete
game yet. We're trying to get to level ground. And right now, we're
below ground, which makes that even harder.'' &QL;

WOODS IS TOO UNFLAPPABLE, TOO GOOD, TOO SOON 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOTOGRANDE, Spain _ Tiger Woods was simply too good. Too good to
be daunted by a controversial triple-bogey on the 17th hole. Too
good to be rattled when fans cheered against him. Too good to be
beaten by a field featuring most of the world's best players. Too
good to be intimidated by a diabolical golf course that frustrated
many of his opponents.
</P>
<P>
   The world's No. 1 player showed his greatness in memorable
fashion Sunday, winning the American Express Championship and
becoming the first PGA Tour player to win four consecutive starts
since Ben Hogan in 1953. Woods did it the hard way, prevailing in a
one-hole playoff against Spain's Miguel Angel Jimenez, and
persevering through a final round that featured terrific golf,
drama and heated emotions.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Woods (71-69-70-68 _ 278, six-under par) birdied the
first playoff hole to defeat Jimenez (72-68-69-69 _ 278), darkness
was falling at Valderrama Golf Club, and Woods had put an
exclamation point on one of the superb seasons in golf history.
Winning for the ninth time worldwide this year, and for the eighth
time on tour, Woods ended the official 1999 season as the first
player with eight single-season victories since Johnny Miller in
1974.
</P>
<P>
   Woods is only the seventh player in golf history to win seven
times or more in one year, and the $1 million first-place check
lifted Woods' 1999 winnings to more than $6.6 million, making him
golf's first $6 million man for a single season. David Duval had
held the money record, winning $2.59 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   At 23, Woods has taken his extraordinary talent to a new level,
as he showed Sunday when he shot seven under par through the first
15 holes, a brilliant stretch that displayed the best in Woods'
diverse repertory. The highlights included 15-foot birdie putts at
both No. 1 and No. 2, a chip-in for eagle from 25 feet at No. 11,
an 8-iron shot downwind at No. 12 that carried 196 yards and led to
another birdie, then a 6-iron into the wind at No. 14 that stopped
two and a half feet from the cup for another birdie. On a blustery
day when only three players shot in the 60s, Woods looked as if he
might shoot a 64 or better.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he had shot a 64, in these conditions, I would have ranked
that with the all-time great rounds,'' said Nick Price, who played
a group behind Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the triple-bogey almost cost Woods the victory. But
somehow, as he has done 15 times in his young professional career,
he found a way to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played a great round of golf today,'' said Woods, who had
five birdies and an eagle, including a four-hole stretch from Nos.
9 through 12 when he made birdie, birdie, eagle, birdie. ``I've had
a great season, and it's nice to end it this way.''
</P>
<P>
   But the final event of the season did not escape controversy,
centering on a questionable pin position at the par-5, 490-yard No.
17, and the reaction of fans to Woods' triple-bogey.
Understandably, the gallery favored Jimenez, playing in a
tournament not far from where he grew up. But when Woods' third
shot at No. 17 hit the green, only to roll backward down a slope
more than 35 feet into the water, a loud cheer went up from the
gallery, and a group of fans standing on a knoll above the green
jumped for joy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was appalled at the cheering,'' said Tom Lehman, who played
with Woods on Sunday, and who also chipped a ball into the water at
No. 17. ``People criticized us at the Ryder Cup, but if you're
going to cheer people hitting balls into the water and missing
putts, it kind of takes away your right to criticize.''
</P>
<P>
   Price thought the cheer meant that Woods had made an eagle or a
birdie.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I found out that he had hit the ball in the water, I was
pretty disgusted,'' Price said. ``Golf has always been able to
separate itself from that kind of behavior. But it's not right what
happened at the Ryder Cup, and it's not right what happened here.
They're going to have trouble getting guys to come over here if
they are going to get that type of treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he felt about the reaction at No. 17, Woods said:
``That's unfortunate. It had nothing to do with the Ryder Cup. It
had to do with a person from their own country who they wanted to
win. When the ball when in the water, it was disappointing to hear,
but understandable.''
</P>
<P>
   Merely another unpleasant experience for Woods at Valderrama's
unique No. 17, a hole that has been unkind to him in the past. At
the 1997 Ryder Cup, Woods hit a putt at No. 17 that rolled off the
green into the water, one of the many momentum swings that led to
Europe's victory.
</P>
<P>
   The hole had been remolded since 1997, but it remains
treacherous. How difficult is it? Sunday, 11 of the 61 players had
a double-bogey or worse at No. 17. And Sunday's pin was in its most
dangerous location, front and right, in front of a downhill slope
that feeds directly into the water in front of the green.
Meanwhile, the wind was blowing from the back of the green toward
the front, helping to push balls into the water.
</P>
<P>
   When Woods reached No. 17, he was at nine under par, two strokes
ahead of Jimenez who was two groups behind. A good drive and a
6-iron lay-up left Woods only 100 yards from the pin. Then came the
trouble shot, a 9-iron that landed in the center of the green. At
first, it looked like a great shot, so good that Woods started
walking calmly toward the green. But slowly, the ball trickled down
the slope and kept going, and going, off the green and into the
water. Many players felt the pin position was ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not a pin position when the wind is blowing and the
greens are fast,'' Price said. ``I didn't know where to hit the
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiger hit three flawless shots and ended up with a
triple-bogey,'' Lehman said. ``I felt sorry for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Assessed a penalty stroke, Woods took his drop in front of the
water, pitched his next shot to the back of the green, hit a
delicate putt down the slope that ran five feet past the hole, then
missed his next putt before his tap-in for a triple-bogey eight.
Now Woods was two strokes behind, but Jimenez opened the door with
bogeys at both 16 and 18. After making a nice par at No. 17,
Jimenez could have won the tournament with par at the par-4 18th,
but he pulled his 2-iron tee shot into the left rough, hit short of
the green, then hit a bad chip from 45 feet that rolled into the
back rough. Jimenez then chipped four feet past the hole, but he
made the putt for bogey to force the playoff, as Woods warmed up on
the driving range.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, Woods sealed the victory at No. 18, the first
playoff hole. After a good drive by Woods, Jimenez hit another bad
tee shot with a driver, putting the ball left of the cart path into
the rough. His next shot landed in the front bunker, then Woods hit
a nice approach shot to 12 feet below the hole. Jimenez hit his
bunker shot 14 feet past the hole to the back fringe, and he almost
chipped in for par, barely missing the cup to the left. But after
Jimenez tapped in for bogey, Woods ended a bizarre and profitable
day by making his birdie putt.
</P>
<P>
   Woods will play in Taiwan this week at the Johnnie Walker
Classic, but his next official PGA Tour event will be January's
Mercedes Championship in Hawaii. Until then, his streak is safe.
And Woods can savor a splendid 1999, while looking ahead to 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully next year I'll play the same type of golf,'' Woods
said. ``We'll see if I can continue to improve.'' &QL;

WANTED: LEGAL, LOW-LEVEL WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service
 clients)  
 By CAROL SOWERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
Faced with a dwindling number of workers to fill jobs as
dishwashers, busboys, landscapers and maids, the hospitality
industry in the Phoenix area is mining a new mother lode of
employees: documented workers from countries as far away as Iran
and the Sudan.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Competition for legal workers is so fierce among hoteliers that
the indus try is raising wages, helping recruits learn English and
running vans hundreds of miles a day from modest neighborhoods to
fashionable resort cities where there are jobs but little or no
low-income housing.
</P>
<P>
   The search for hospitality workers is going on all over the
nation, where a robust economy is siphoning workers from low-level
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   When resorts from Colorado to Nantucket Island couldn't find sum
mer employees to flip burgers or make beds, they imported teenagers
from overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's worker shortage has caught the attention of Gov. Jane
Hull, who wants to reinstitute the bracero program, which would
allow thousands of Mexican laborers to get temporary work permits
for jobs in the hospitality, agricultural, custodial and other
industries.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Locally, some hoteliers are using recruitment tactics they say
they never dreamed would be necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are stealing from each other,'' said Judy Dewey, employment
direc tor at the Boulders, an exclusive Carefree resort. ``There is
no one out there willing to do these jobs. That is why refugees are
such a good source.''
</P>
<P>
   The industry can no longer ``just run ads for employees,'' said
Rich New man, Carefree Conference Resort manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the labor pool being as tight as it is, it has made us
think more creatively about how to find more people.''
</P>
<P>
   The demand for refugees from coun tries in political chaos
increases every year, said Craig Thoreson, director of Lutheran
Social Minis tries of the Southwest, which aids refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Ashraf Nasr, an employment coun selor for the International
Rescue Committee, said the hospitality in dustry employs about half
the nearly 800 workers his agency placed last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very important to us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Zakaria Majok, 41, from Sudan, said he is grateful for his job
as a bellman at the Orange Tree Golf &AMP; Confer ence Resort in
Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people at Orange Tree have been very good to me,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He started work a year ago when he arrived in Phoenix, and has
made enough money to rent a home for his family and buy a car.
</P>
<P>
   John Bergman, employment director of the Hyatt Regency
Scottsdale, began hiring refugees last spring. He remembers a few
years ago when applicants outnumbered jobs 10 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``There would be five openings and 50 applicants would show
up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many were Hispanic immigrants, who have long been the backbone
of the hospitality industry's labor force. But now with more
resorts and hotels springing up in the Phoenix area, there are not
enough docu mented Hispanics to fill the increas ing demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``That workforce has dried up,'' Bergman said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, about 270 of the resort's 900 employees are Hispanic
immigrants, with 25 others coming from from Cuba, Bosnia, Iran,
Africa, Russia or Croatia and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Because the refugees have immi gration documents, employers are
spared the worry that they are hiring illegals and risking stiff
federal fines.
</P>
<P>
   Worried about competitors, Bergman wouldn't divulge his source
of work ers but said the Hyatt, like other resorts, helps refugees
with transpor tation, handing out bus passes and sending vans for
employees whose shifts don't match bus schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Dewey, of the Boulders, said the resort also operates vans,
making six 60-mile round trips a day to pick up and return certain
workers who live near the Lutheran agency, at 2020 W. Indian School
Road in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Thoreson, the Lutheran agency's director, said transporting
workers ``is a huge, huge problem,'' created by the lack of
low-income housing in resort cities such as Scottsdale and
Carefree.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, the agency provided vans, but ``it became a
monumental task and we couldn't continue it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Carefree Conference Resort ran shuttles for six months, but
stopped two months ago because recent immigrants are buying cars or
join ing car pools, Newman said.
</P>
<P>
   Once workers are on the payroll, resorts fight to keep them by
provid ing translators, helping them with English, promoting them
and raising their wages.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, Bergman said the Hyatt raised wages to $8 an
hour from $6.25 for certain jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going into the busy sea son,'' he said. ``You have to
attract people from another job.''
</P>
<P>
   Although pay is inching up, Thore son said, it's difficult for
refugee families to manage.
</P>
<P>
   Before fleeing political persecution a year ago, Majok had jobs
as a night hotel manager, accountant, radio operator for an
American oil com pany and consultant for an African studies program
in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he is satisfied with his job as a bellman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm aware that to come to America is different, and I
recognize you have to start from zero,'' he said. ``I am sure I
will reach where I want to be.'' &QL;

GORE AND BRADLEY OFFER DIFFERING APPROACHES ON HEALTH CARE POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ROBIN TONER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The debate over health policy now being waged in
the Democratic presidential primary campaign is not simply about
cost estimates, political positioning and appeals to Democratic
constituencies. Health policy experts say Vice President Al Gore
and former Sen. Bill Bradley have very different visions about how
to deal with the nation's 44.3 million uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   Both men, these experts say, were clearly affected by the
failure of President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994. But
they responded to that history in different ways. Bradley is
proposing a big program, without the government mandates and cost
controls of the Clinton plan, and he is being accused of promising
more than he can deliver. Gore chose to build incrementally on
existing programs, and he is being accused of aiming too low.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley would create a vast new system of subsidies and tax
credits that would, he says, cover all children and provide access
to affordable coverage to all adults. It would allow anyone to buy
private insurance through the program that insures federal workers,
the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. And the people who
depend on Medicaid, the 34-year-old program for the poor, for their
health insurance would be ``mainstreamed'' into this broader system
with federal subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's plan would try to guarantee access to health coverage to
all children by 2005 by expanding eligibility for the Children's
Health Insurance Program, which was established two years ago for
children in families not poor enough for Medicaid but not affluent
enough to buy private insurance. It would also allow their
uninsured parents to enroll in that program. And it would allow
many uninsured Americans ages 55 to 65 to buy into the Medicare
program, a proposal made previously by the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   So far, a new survey suggests, the health care debate between
Gore and Bradley is playing to a tiny audience. Only 6 percent said
they were following news of Bradley's proposal very closely, while
only 8 percent were following Gore's, according to a Kaiser Family
Foundation/Harvard study conducted Oct. 22-26.
</P>
<P>
   But health policy experts are taking this debate seriously,
recognizing that the ideas thrashed out in the 1992 presidential
campaign framed the legislative struggle of the following two
years. And many of them said they were thrilled to see the issue
come back _ and eager to see the Republicans follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, the story is that a candidate running for president of
the United States has put the issue of the uninsured front and
center in his campaign, five years after every political pundit
said it would be a generation before any politician would be
willing to talk about it again,'' said Robert Reischauer, an
economist at the Brookings Institution who was director of the
Congressional Budget Office during the last health care struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Bradley's decision to go for a big, comprehensive health
care program with a price tag he estimates at $65 billion a year,
many analysts see his plan as a departure from past Democratic
orthodoxy. He envisions a major expansion in coverage _ raising the
proportion of Americans with health insurance from 84 percent to 95
percent, and covering virtually all children.
</P>
<P>
   But he rejects past Democratic strategies, like a new government
insurance program or a requirement that employers provide insurance
to their workers _ the so-called employer mandate that was the
cornerstone of the Clinton plan and previous Democratic proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Bradley proposes a new system of government subsidies
and tax credits to help low-income Americans buy private coverage.
Drew Altman, president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, said,
``Bradley is using what traditionally have been conservative means
to achieve a liberal end.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the Bradley plan, every child would be required to have
health insurance, but the federal government would provide
substantial assistance with the cost. For children living in
households with incomes under $32,800 (about twice the poverty
level for families of four), the government would make a full
premium payment, estimated at $1,200, to the federally approved
health care plan of the parents' choice.
</P>
<P>
   That subsidy would be tied to income, paid on a sliding scale
and phased out at $49,200 for a family of four. Families and
individuals would also receive a tax break to offset the costs of
health premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley estimates that 84 percent of the nation's 11 million
uninsured children would receive a full or partial subsidy.
</P>
<P>
   Low-income adults would also be eligible for subsidies to help
cover insurance premiums, with full annual premium costs up to
$1,800 paid for adults with incomes below $16,400 (for a family of
four) and a partial subsidy available to adults in families with
incomes up to $32,800. People could stay with their current
coverage or buy a plan through the Federal Employees Health
Benefits Program.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley plan would also essentially dismantle Medicaid, the
federal and state program that covers health care for poor people,
including many elderly Americans in nursing homes. The federal
government would take over the acute care portions of the program,
providing full subsidies to purchase insurance for eligible people.
And the states would take over the institutional long-term care
part of the program. This system of subsidies and tax credits would
also cover children in the Children's Health Insurance Program.
</P>
<P>
   Margy Heldring, the campaign's health coordinator, said the
Medicaid move was an attempt to eliminate the stigma attached to
the program and ``mainstream'' its beneficiaries into the private
insurance market. Already, she said, more than half of the Medicaid
beneficiaries have been moved to managed care plans in the states.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bradley gets high marks from health policy experts for
recognizing what many consider a crisis in health coverage,
particularly the failure of employer-sponsored insurance to cover
millions of American workers, and for putting serious money on the
table to combat it. But the subsidy and tax credit approach, while
increasingly popular in the past few years as politicians look for
alternatives to employer mandates, is no magic bullet, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   In general, many health experts say, such plans can end up
spending a lot of public money for people who already have
insurance, because the subsidy is based on income, not whether they
are insured. ``It's a more inefficient way to do it,'' said Stuart
Altman, a professor of health policy at Brandeis University, and a
longtime supporter of an employer mandate.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Thorpe, a former Clinton health adviser now on the faculty
of Emory University who insisted he was neutral in the race despite
claims of bias from the Bradley campaign, said, ``The bulk of the
kids who fall within these income brackets already have health
insurance.'' Such plans could also, some say, inadvertently
encourage employers to reduce their responsibilities for coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's promise of universal access has won praise from many
health care advocates, who are delighted to see an ambitious new
approach to the problem of the uninsured. But the Gore campaign
asserts that Bradley is simply making promises that don't add up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absurd to go making promises on this that literally will
never be kept because the money will never be there,'' said Elaine
Kamarck, a senior Gore adviser.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign takes aim at the Bradley plan on several
fronts: That it drains too much of the projected budget surplus,
and thus shortchanges Medicare, which will need a major infusion in
the coming years; that the overall cost estimate is off; that the
$1,800 premium estimate is unrealistic, thus discouraging
low-income people from participating and making it unlikely that
the plan would meet its 95 percent coverage goal, and that
dismantling Medicaid is dangerous and disruptive for millions of
vulnerable Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore proposal on health care is, his advisers argue, a far
more focused approach. It tries to broaden the Children's Health
Insurance Program, which has had varying degrees of success in the
states, by expanding eligibility to families at 250 percent of the
poverty level, from 200 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That would cover an additional 1 million uninsured children,
Gore advisers say. It would allow uninsured children in families
above 250 percent of the poverty level to buy into the Children's
Health Insurance Program or Medicaid, which would be more
affordable than buying individual policies. And it would escalate
the government's efforts to make sure that children who are
eligible for Medicaid or CHIP are enrolled.
</P>
<P>
   Gore would also allow many uninsured people ages 55 to 65, the
fastest growing group of uninsured in the country, to buy into
Medicare. He would create a new 25 percent tax credit for small
employers who join purchasing coalitions to buy insurance for their
workers. And he would provide a 25 percent tax credit for people
without access to employer-sponsored insurance who need to purchase
it on the individual market.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley campaign essentially dismisses Gore's proposal as
far too timid, given the steady rise in the uninsured in the midst
of an extraordinary economic boom. It argues that because Mr. Gore
relies so heavily on CHIP, a voluntary program which has had
serious problems reaching the eligible uninsured, it is unlikely to
end up covering all children.

WANTED: LEGAL, LOW-LEVEL WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service
 clients)  
 By CAROL SOWERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
Faced with a dwindling number of workers to fill jobs as
dishwashers, busboys, landscapers and maids, the hospitality
industry in the Phoenix area is mining a new mother lode of
employees: documented workers from countries as far away as Iran
and the Sudan.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Competition for legal workers is so fierce among hoteliers that
the indus try is raising wages, helping recruits learn English and
running vans hundreds of miles a day from modest neighborhoods to
fashionable resort cities where there are jobs but little or no
low-income housing.
</P>
<P>
   The search for hospitality workers is going on all over the
nation, where a robust economy is siphoning workers from low-level
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   When resorts from Colorado to Nantucket Island couldn't find sum
mer employees to flip burgers or make beds, they imported teenagers
from overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's worker shortage has caught the attention of Gov. Jane
Hull, who wants to reinstitute the bracero program, which would
allow thousands of Mexican laborers to get temporary work permits
for jobs in the hospitality, agricultural, custodial and other
industries.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Locally, some hoteliers are using recruitment tactics they say
they never dreamed would be necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are stealing from each other,'' said Judy Dewey, employment
direc tor at the Boulders, an exclusive Carefree resort. ``There is
no one out there willing to do these jobs. That is why refugees are
such a good source.''
</P>
<P>
   The industry can no longer ``just run ads for employees,'' said
Rich New man, Carefree Conference Resort manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the labor pool being as tight as it is, it has made us
think more creatively about how to find more people.''
</P>
<P>
   The demand for refugees from coun tries in political chaos
increases every year, said Craig Thoreson, director of Lutheran
Social Minis tries of the Southwest, which aids refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Ashraf Nasr, an employment coun selor for the International
Rescue Committee, said the hospitality in dustry employs about half
the nearly 800 workers his agency placed last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very important to us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Zakaria Majok, 41, from Sudan, said he is grateful for his job
as a bellman at the Orange Tree Golf &AMP; Confer ence Resort in
Scottsdale.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Jack Lew, the White House budget director,
came to power, he took down an oil painting of a yachting regatta
left on the office wall by a Republican predecessor and replaced it
with scenes of working-class life.
</P>
<P>
   Then he started trying to replace the legacy of the Reagan
revolution.
</P>
<P>
   At Lew's confirmation last year, Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, told
him that his dominion over trillions of dollars would make him
``the second most powerful person in our whole government,'' a
daunting thought, in part since Lew does not appear to have aged
much since college.
</P>
<P>
   But the power is real. And Lew, knee-deep in politics since he
was 12 years old, wants to use it. With negotiations over the size
and shape of the federal budget continuing late Sunday night, 37
days into the new fiscal year, Lew, king of the numbers crunchers,
is in the thick of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of power is to get things done,'' Lew said.
``Budgets aren't books of numbers. They're a tapestry, the fabric,
of what we believe. The numbers tell a story, a self-portrait of
what we are as a country.''
</P>
<P>
   Lew's self-portrait is woven from the tatters of old-time New
York Democratic politics and his 14 years working for some of the
legendary paleoliberals in Congress, like Tip O'Neill, the speaker
of the House, and Bella Abzug, the boisterous voice of much of the
West Side of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of making the world a better place was very much a
part of my upbringing,'' Lew said. ``The most important things in
my house were books and ideas. The issues of the world were part of
our daily conversations.''
</P>
<P>
   Lew, who is 44, married to a teacher of learning-disabled
students and has two teenage children, grew up in the apartment in
Queens where his mother, Ruth, a retired office manager, still
lives. His late father, Irving, who became a lawyer and a rare-book
dealer, came to New York from Poland in 1916 and learned to speak
English at Boys High School in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very much part of my understanding of what government
is,'' Lew said, referring to his father's experience. ``What would
have become of my father if he hadn't been able to learn English in
the public schools?''
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, a year of political assassinations and protests, Lew
hit the streets of New York to campaign for Sen. Eugene McCarthy,
the dove in the Democratic presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty exciting for a 12-year-old,'' Lew said. ``It was also
my introduction to seeing that you could make a difference in
people's lives through politics.''
</P>
<P>
   At 18, he became an aide to Ms. Abzug. At 23, after graduating
from Harvard, he went to work for O'Neill of Massachusetts _ the
Tyrannosaurus rex of the lost world of Democratic politics on
Capitol Hill _ and became his chief aide on domestic policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took away from that experience the best of Tip O'Neill _
using power as an instrument to help people,'' said John Podesta,
the White House chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   Lew concurred. ``I grew up in many ways on the Hill in O'Neill's
office,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1981, came the Reagan revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a very difficult, disappointing year, the year I lost
my father, the year the Democrats lost control of the government,''
Lew said. In many ways, he said, he has spent the last 20 years
working to repair what he believes Reagan wrought _ a government
with huge debts and a deficit of compassion.
</P>
<P>
   Congress' most potent weapon is the power of the purse _ to
spend money to get things done, or to cut it off. And since the
Republicans took Congress in 1995, the budget battles have been
bitter. That year, the battles shut down the government. In 1998,
shortly after Lew rose from deputy White House budget director,
replacing Franklin Raines, they contributed to the fall of Speaker
Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the fight is about which party can claim that its
fiscal discipline will balance the budget, protect Social Security
and make it deserving of political power. The Republican leadership
sees these issues as weapons for keeping control in Congress and
taking back the White House next year.
</P>
<P>
   As the budget wars drag on, Lew goes to battle with Congress
deep into the night, almost every night _ save sundown Friday to
sundown Saturday, when he observes the Jewish sabbath _ and feels
increasingly victorious.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've won the battle in the past two years that we lost in
1981,'' he said. ``Our goal wasn't to stop things. It was to do
things the right way. If you don't use power to got things done, it
contributes to public cynicism. People only see political
infighting. And I don't think that's what government's all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of his adversaries say they respect him. ``I enjoy working
with Jack Lew,'' said Rep. Bill Young, R-Fla., chairman of the
House Appropriations Committee. ``He's a tough negotiator, but he's
very nice to work with.''
</P>
<P>
   But not all. The Democrats have been bashing the Republicans for
using billions of surplus Social Security funds to finance this
year's spending bills, and ``it's unfortunate that Jack Lew's
participated in these berating sessions,'' said Sen. Arlen Specter,
R-Pa. ``Up until then I always thought he was a professional.''
</P>
<P>
   At the bargaining table, Podesta said, the administration is
unified, while Republicans speak in several voices _ moderate,
conservative and very conservative.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I am negotiating, I am doing it in one voice,'' Lew said.
``That gives us strength.''

   NEW YORK _ Erica Scheier, 26, a veterinarian from Hoboken, N.J.,
running Sunday's New York City Marathon, has never been a patient
runner, and has never been inclined to wait for anything in life.
She knew she was fast and wore a ``Go, Erica!'' T-shirt to gain
crowd support.
</P>
<P>
   Scheier also knew her aggressiveness could spell trouble in the
marathon, which favored prudence over speed. It was Scheier's first
attempt at the 26.2-mile distance, but she was so strong from
22-mile training runs that she felt it might be hard for her to run
slowly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm competitive,'' she said. ``I'm worried about that. I don't
want to hit the wall and collapse.''
</P>
<P>
   But Scheier had three auspicious goals in mind. One was to break
3 hours 40 minutes and qualify for the Boston Marathon in April.
Another was to break 3:30, a respectable pace of 8 minutes a mile.
A third goal was to break the family marathon record of 3:17, held
by her father, Evan Pickman, a scout for the Los Angeles Clippers
of the National Basketball Association.
</P>
<P>
   To go with her goals, Scheier had had three marathon dreams _
all nightmares. In one of them, she stopped to talk to spectators
and missed all her goals.
</P>
<P>
   For Scheier, unlike most new marathoners, there was no time to
waste.
</P>
<P>
   Defying convention _ and looking the wall right in the eye _ she
started out fast, hitting eight miles on Brooklyn's Fourth Avenue
in 58 minutes 50 seconds, a pace of 7:21 a mile. ``The pace felt so
comfortable, I decided to keep it up,'' Scheier said. ``Besides,
whenever I slowed down, the crowd picked me up with, ``Go,
Erica!'''
</P>
<P>
   Scheier's plan was working, but perhaps too well. She remembered
that she had collapsed in her last big race in 1996. While an
undergraduate at Dartmouth who ran the campus cross-country course,
Scheier doubled her major to complete her studies early and went on
to the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   In Philadelphia, while working and studying around the clock,
Scheier persisted in running daily and entered a 10-mile race. ``I
went out like a maniac,'' said Scheier, a former gymnast from
Tottenville High School on Staten Island. ``It was very hot, I
didn't stop for drinks and I collapsed at the finish.'' Medics
treated her with intravenous fluids and told her she was lucky to
be alive.
</P>
<P>
   For her marathon buildup, which began in June, Scheier was
careful. She increased her training gradually, to a peak of 50
miles a week, and practiced running with a water bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, she carried a bottle for insurance and her risky pace
from Brooklyn into Queens. Her halfway split on the Pulaski Bridge
was 1:37, close to her best half-marathon race, 1:32, in September.
That meant Scheier was either in over her head or might blow the
lights out of the family record.
</P>
<P>
   Scheier picked up a fresh water bottle from her mother, Marian,
at 17 miles on First Avenue. That was the first rendezvous point
for family members, who had a race of their own to get to the
course. Scheier's father flew to New York on Sunday morning from a
coaching assignment in Raleigh, N.C. Scheier's husband, Adam, an
assistant football coach at Columbia, rushed to the course after
reviewing films of the Lions' victory over Dartmouth on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   One other family member, Erica's pet cockatoo, Kramer (named
after the ``Seinfeld'' character for his unruly feathers), remained
at home. ``I left the TV on so he could watch the marathon and
cheer for me,'' Scheier said.
</P>
<P>
   Extra water and cheering were not enough for Scheier, who began
to labor under her ambitious pace. She weakened at 19 miles but
gobbled a banana and felt an immediate energy boost. ``It must have
gone right to my muscles,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Scheier, though slowing, had no problems, running
with a veteran's control. Then, in Harlem at the 21st mile, her
spirits rose when she saw Adam riding by on a bicycle. ``That's my
wife!'' he called out. ``That's my wife!'' Then he turned to Erica
and said with awe: ``You're a machine.''
</P>
<P>
   Cool and detached has been Scheier's athletic motif. As a child,
she won camp races but paid her victories little mind. She had more
fun dressing as a dolphin to be the mascot for the College of
Staten Island basketball team, coached by her father. But now, in
Central Park with three miles to go in her first marathon, Scheier
looked every bit the natural.
</P>
<P>
   At the 24th mile, her father, Evan, jumped out on the course to
run alongside for a few strides. ``You're well ahead of 3:30,'' he
told her. ``Just relax and enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Scheier did, breezing through the finish in 3:22:57, an
excellent marathon debut and 166th among the 9,000 women. ``I feel
wonderful,'' she said with her medal draped around her neck. ``But
dazed.''
</P>
<P>
   Scheier's eyes were clear, her cheeks caked in sweat. Spent, yet
content, she said: ``I know I qualified for Boston. But now that
I've achieved my goal, why run it again?'' &QL;

THE ELITE'S CHOICE HEADS TO VICTORY IN MEXICO PRIMARY 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Francisco Labastida Ochoa, the candidate favored
by the establishment in Mexico's governing party, appeared to be
heading toward a decisive victory Sunday evening in the first
presidential primary ever held by the party.
</P>
<P>
   According to an independent exit poll and less formal soundings
by officials in Labastida's campaign, he was ahead of his closest
rival, former Tabasco state Gov. Roberto Madrazo Pintado, by at
least 10 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever wins the primary race stands a strong chance to win the
presidential election on July 2 because opposition voters are
divided between two major parties, which have failed to form a
coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Esteban Moctezuma Barragan, Labastida's campaign manager, began
to claim victory soon after the polls closed at 6 p.m. Alejandro
Valenzuela, a campaign spokesman, said that based on preliminary
results the election seemed to be ``a landslide.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials in the campaign of Madrazo, who has long experience at
fighting tenaciously when he is behind in a race, insisted that he
had won and appeared to be laying the groundwork for a battle royal
over the results of the election.
</P>
<P>
   The primary broke with seven decades of authoritarian tradition
in which the incumbent president picked his successor in a ritual
known as the finger-tap. Despite the contention over the results,
it was regarded across the political spectrum as a historic advance
toward democracy in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   President Ernesto Zedillo, who made the decision to abandon the
old practice and allow Mexican voters to choose his party's
candidate, held up two fingers after he cast his own ballot Sunday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``This finger is a thing of the past,'' he said, waving the
index finger he opted not to use to tap the presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we have this one,'' Zedillo added, showing the indelible
black ink on his thumb which showed that he had voted in the
primary.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo did not reveal before the polls closed whom he had voted
for, however. Throughout the campaign he insisted that he was not
backing any of the four candidates. But Labastida's rivals bitterly
questioned the fairness of the race, charging that the party
establishment had guessed that Zedillo was backing his former
interior minister and thrown its power behind Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida, 57, served as President Zedillo's Interior Minister,
the No. 2 cabinet minister, and has had a steady 37-year career in
government posts. He promised gradual reforms to make the PRI less
corrupt and more democratic, and greater spending on social
programs for the working class if he becomes president.
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo, by contrast, presented himself as a rebel who would
make sweeping changes to break the hold of the Mexico City
political elite on the party.
</P>
<P>
   The governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the
PRI, has won every presidential election in Mexico since its
founding in 1929, making it the world's longest ruling party. It
has been weakened by spectacular corruption and disastrous economic
management by recent presidents.
</P>
<P>
   For the PRI, which achieved many of its past electoral victories
by ever more sophisticated methods of fraud and coercion, mounting
a clean primary was a special challenge. The party spent $3.3
million to organize a vote almost as ambitious as a presidential
election, with 64,200 polling stations nationwide and more than
450,000 people involved as officials and poll watchers.
</P>
<P>
   Any Mexican registered to vote was allowed to participate,
whether a PRI member or not. The winner had to take a majority of
300 electoral districts.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Gutierrez Barrios, the veteran PRI politician in charge
of ensuring an honest primary, said fraud was ``almost
impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Also running were Manuel Bartlett Diaz, 63, the former governor
of Puebla state, and Humberto Roque Villanueva, 55, a former
president of the party. Bartlett and Roque were expected to draw
small percentages.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   According to two exit polls by TV Azteca and Televisa, the two
major television networks, voters in Mexico City strongly favored
Jesus Silva Herzog, a former ambassador to the United States, to be
the PRI candidate for mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Party members savored their first chance to have a real say in
picking the candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not imposing leaders anymore,'' said Pedro Corro
Garcia, a 23-year-old engineering student whose family included
several generations of PRI followers. ``They are letting us
decide.''
</P>
<P>
   PRI elections officials said the voting was orderly in most
places, but they reported some ``marginal incidents'' of
irregularities. In a rural village in Puebla, Bartlett's home
state, ballots for 4 polling stations were burned, apparently by
opponents of the PRI. In the Mexico City suburb of Villa Coapa
predawn raiders, also apparently from opposition groups, stole all
of the ballots from one polling station, PRI officials said.
</P>
<P>
   However, complaints flowed in from Madrazo followers around the
country that PRI officials had dispensed hand-outs of food and
promises of government aid, and in some cases resorted to overt
threats, to get PRI followers to turn out and vote for Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   In one town in the state of Queretaro, the PRI mayor threatened
to fire six employees who planned to turn out as poll watchers for
Madrazo, according to Jacaranda Pineda Chavez, a state deputy who
supports Madrazo. Only one stayed home Sunday, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In San Andres Tuxtla, a town in the Gulf Coast state of
Veracruz, an official in charge of a federal aid program for the
lowest-income families warned that they might lose their assistance
if they failed to support Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see where their fanaticism for Labastida has taken them,''
Carmen Sanchez Llano, 30, a dentist who supports Madrazo, said by
telephone from the town.
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo gave no sign that he would give up easily and seemed to
be preparing to try to prove to PRI elections authorities that he
had won and, failing that, to assail the election with dozens of
formal complaints about inequities during the campaign and the
voting.
</P>
<P>
   During the day Madrazo's campaign violated PRI bylaws by
distributing e-mail results of impromptu polls showing Madrazo in
the lead. Right after the polls closed in Mexico City, he sent out
a bulletin announcing that he had won 139 districts while Labastida
had won only 69. He did not cite the source of his information.
</P>
<P>
   But Madrazo campaign officials said there was little chance that
he or his followers would leave the party even if he suffered a
conclusive defeat. Instead, Madrazo seemed to be paving the way for
a tough negotiation for positions of power within the party with
Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should we leave a party that is just as much ours as
theirs?'' said Jose Alberto Aguilar, an adviser to Madrazo.
</P>
<P>
   In one surprise, Leonardo Rodriguez Alcaine, the head of PRI's
main national labor federation, announced after he voted Sunday
that he had chosen Madrazo.
</P>
<P>
   At the polls many PRI voters said they were dismayed at the
surprisingly acid attacks Labastida and Madrazo leveled at each
other during the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``They let it get personal, all those attacks, `` grumbled Elvia
Fragoso Huerta, 49, a voter in the proletarian Mexico City suburb
of Ecatepec.

GOVERNMENT, MICROSOFT MAY BE WILLING TO SETTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RICHMAN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The government doesn't want Microsoft's money.
</P>
<P>
   But the nation's top antitrust official said Sunday that the
government is considering a full range of other punishments,
including corporate dismemberment, following a judge's emphatic
conclusion Friday that the Redmond, Wash., software giant is a
monopolist that has harmed consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the harshness of U.S. District Judge Thomas Jackson's
findings, both the government and the company expressed a
willingness to consider settling.
</P>
<P>
   The best possible outcome, said computer-industry companies and
associations reached over the weekend, will be the one that cures
any ills caused by Microsoft's monopoly, and prevents their
recurrence, but otherwise leaves unchanged how the industry does
business.
</P>
<P>
   In an open letter, Microsoft chairman Bill Gates said the
company is committed to ``a fair and responsible'' resolution. The
company's chief operating officer, Bob Herbold, said on the Sunday
talk shows that ``there's nothing we'd like more than to settle
this case.''
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Attorney General Joel Klein, who also appeared on
three television programs, said, ``Obviously settlement is always
an option.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Klein nor Herbold would suggest what an agreement might
entail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would need a settlement that deals with the very findings
that the court made in this case, a settlement that produces
consumer choice, innovation and competition in the market,'' Klein
said on ``Fox News Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited ``serious issues here about law enforcement and the
antitrust laws. And of course if Microsoft were prepared to engage
on those issues, we would be prepared as well.''
</P>
<P>
   In Gates' letter, which appeared as a full-page advertisement in
The Washington Post, he wrote that ``Microsoft is committed to
resolving this matter in a fair and responsible manner, while
ensuring that the fundamental principles of consumer benefit and
innovation are protected.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At the heart of this case,'' he said, ``is whether a
successful American company can continue to improve its products
for the benefit of consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter, addressed ``To Our Customers, Partners and
Shareholders,'' also appeared on Microsoft's Web site, dated
Friday, the day Jackson released his ruling. It was similar to a
statement Gates read on the same day.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who presided over 77 days of testimony, declared in a
remarkably blunt decision that Microsoft's aggressive use of its
monopoly status stifled innovation and hurt consumers by limiting
choices.
</P>
<P>
   Government lawyers, Klein said, are ``doing an analysis that
will look at the full range of remedies.'' Asked if breaking up
Microsoft is among them, Klein said: ``That is in the range, but
... it is premature for us now to get ahead of the story.''
</P>
<P>
   One penalty that he appeared to rule out is a fine. ``Let me
make clear we are not looking for any financial penalties,'' Klein
said on CNN's ``Late Edition.'' ``We're concerned with competition.
This is not a penal action, and we're not going to seek monies.''
</P>
<P>
   Too bad. Fines would probably suit most computer-industry
companies and associations, many of which fear the cure for
Microsoft's anticompetitive behavior may be worse than the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The findings handed down Friday hint at remedies that some worry
could hamstring the industry more effectively than Jackson found
Microsoft has done.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's news brought no gloom to the Computer &AMP; Communications
Industry Association, a 26-year-old Washington, D.C. group
representing, among others companies, several large Microsoft
opponents. Those include Oracle and Sun Microsystems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft is a rapacious monopoly that should be broken up and
then prevented from colluding further,'' said Ed Black, the
association's president. ``There is a huge fear factor (over
Microsoft) among our members,'' even though many of them embrace
Microsoft publicly, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, even Black advocates a ``minimally intrusive,
minimally regulatory'' remedy. ``Microsoft raises the specter of
some huge regulatory scheme,'' but that's not necessary to recreate
competition, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Wasch, president of the Software &AMP; Information Industry
Association, congratulated Jackson on the ruling. But, like Black,
he advised caution in fashioning a remedy. His group advocates
creating ``a new relationship between the dominant (operating
system) provider and the rest of the industry, while eliminating
the need for the government to remain as a watchdog of software
business practices.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Grummon, president of Bellevue-based Chili!Soft, said
nothing in the findings of fact makes him worry for his own
company. In fact, he said, some of the findings criticize Microsoft
tactics that caused hardship to Chili!Soft.
</P>
<P>
   He imagines the case's most likely outcome _ some form of
company break-up _ will affect the software industry much like the
breakup of AT&AMP;T in 1984 affected the telecommunications sector.
</P>
<P>
   That breakup released a flood of innovation from former Baby
Bells and newly hatched competitors, but it sacrificed the
uniformly excellent service AT&AMP;T customers had enjoyed.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, ``in the short term, Microsoft users will have
trouble getting the same level of consistency among various
products; they'll have more chaos and confusion,'' Grummon said.
That problem will exacerbate an already-critical shortage of
programming talent. But in the long term, software will get simpler
and more diverse.
</P>
<P>
   Several other trade groups and businesses were more vociferous
in their objections to the findings of fact and to any forthcoming
remedies.
</P>
<P>
   What monopoly? asked Jonathan Zuck, president of the Association
for Competitive Technology, a 500-member Washington, D.C.
organization founded as a reaction against the suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``There cannot be a monopoly in this industry. We've seen that
in the huge venture capital investments being made in (Windows
rival) Linux, in the way market shares change,'' Zuck said.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Windows does dominate the market for Intel-based PC
operating systems, changing that could be disastrous, Zuck said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Windows itself is just a $5 billion business sitting at the
middle of a $500 billion market for products and services that rely
on there being an operating system standard. It could cost up to
$30 billion to fragment that standard.''
</P>
<P>
   The findings of fact will probably cause a surge in membership
in Zuck's group from companies that haven't paid much attention to
the suit until now _ ``which is how they should be spending their
time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Association for Competitive Technology said an October
survey of 907 registered voters showed that 74 percent (with a 3.3
percent margin of error) favor consumer choice over government
intervention as the best marketplace regulator.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Sax, president of Sax Software Corp., a 10-person Eugene,
Ore. software developer, said he thinks the judge is ``basically
attacking the way the industry as a whole operates.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We compete with Microsoft, and they're incredibly powerful
competitors,'' Sax said. ``But it's possible for small companies to
take them on their weaknesses _ that's what being a company is all
about. Every company wants to drive its competitors out of
business, and there's nothing wrong with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Diamond, chief executive of Corporate Software &AMP;
Technology Inc. in Norwood, Mass., said he's wary of government
intervention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that the government is going to step into this
industry, which is operating at such an effective level, and we're
not supposed to fear that the government won't stumble, scares
me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is Microsoft an incredibly aggressive competitor? Absolutely.
Does that mean the industry or consumers have been hurt? I don't
believe it,'' he said. ``To say there hasn't been innovation or
reduction of costs to consumers is idiocy.''

JUDGE: HOW MICROSOFT USED ITS MONOPOLY POWER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By THE SEATTLE POST-INTELLIGENCER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson said Microsoft used its
monopoly power in several ways to damage competitors. Here are a
few examples:
</P>
<P>
   Intel: On Aug. 2, 1995, Bill Gates told Intel chairman Andy
Grove that Microsoft no longer would support Intel's next
generation of microprocessors if Intel continued developing
platform-level software that competed with Microsoft. Intel agreed
to stop.
</P>
<P>
   Apple: Microsoft attempted to convince Apple to abandon plans
for its multimedia playback software for Windows. In a meeting on
June 15, 1998, Apple chief executive Steve Jobs turned down the
offer. Although it was rejected, Jackson said Microsoft was
attempting to limit the development of multi-media content that
would run cross-platform.
</P>
<P>
   RealNetworks: On July 10, 1997, Microsoft executive Robert
Muglia told RealNetworks that it would be in the best interest of
both companies if RealNetworks only developed software for
Microsoft's multimedia platform. One week later, Microsoft made an
investment in RealNetworks and agreed to distribute a copy of the
company's media player with Internet Explorer; license the source
code for RealNetworks' streaming technology; and develop a common
file format for streaming audio and video.
</P>
<P>
   RealNetworks, the judge wrote, interpreted the agreement
differently from Microsoft and continued developing streaming
software on its own.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's intentions toward RealNetworks show that Microsoft
executives were willing to invest a large amount of cash and other
resources to halt software development, the judge wrote.
</P>
<P>
   IBM: Microsoft attempted to convince IBM to drop support of
products such as Notes and SmartSuite that competed with Windows
and Office. When IBM refused to cooperate, Jackson wrote, Microsoft
punished IBM with higher prices, a late license for Windows 95 and
the withholding of technical and marketing support.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly damaging, he wrote, was a delayed Windows 95
license that caused IBM to miss out on key holiday sales.
</P>
<P>
   On July, 25, 1995, three days after IBM announced its plans to
bundle SmartSuite on its personal computers, Microsoft told IBM
that it was canceling further negotiations with IBM for a Windows
95 license, he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   SmartSuite competed with Microsoft Office. Joachim Kempin, who
oversaw Microsoft's sales to computer makers, told an IBM executive
that Microsoft would consider restoring the license if IBM agreed
to support Microsoft software on IBM personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   Because IBM installed SmartSuite on its personal computers,
Judge Jackson wrote, Microsoft was reluctant to help IBM sell more
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq: On May 31, 1996, Microsoft sent a letter to Compaq
saying it would cancel the computer manufacturer's license for
Windows 95 unless it restored MSN and Internet Explorer to their
original positions on the standard Compaq Presario desktop screen.
Compaq agreed. Microsoft was willing to forfeit all Windows sales
with its biggest partner, the judge wrote, in order to enforce its
prohibition against removing Microsoft's Internet-related icons
from the Windows desktop.

NO STANDOUT FOR HORSE OF YEAR

<TEXT>
<P>
   HALLANDALE, Fla. _ The morning after the Breeders' Cup, the
North American Horse of the Year campaign turned negative.
</P>
<P>
   The debate among turf writers _ who split the year-end ballots
with Daily Racing Form staffers and track racing secretaries _
focused on the shortcomings of the candidates left standing
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   They include Breeders' Cup winners Artax (a one-dimensional
sprinter), Daylami (with one American race), Beautiful Pleasure
(never tested against males) and Soaring Softly (of the narrow
distaff turf division), and Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner
Charismatic (retired in June). Even Silverbulletday _ a Breeders'
Cup loser _ seemed to have some support.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever winds up with thoroughbred racing's top prize in
February, ``It'll be the most undeserving Horse of the Year in my
lifetime,'' said one voter, the New York Daily News' Bill Finley,
38.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of horses had chances to sew up the title in the
eight-race Breeders' Cup at Gulfstream Park. They all lost: Behrens
(seventh), Lemon Drop Kid (sixth), General Challenge (10th) and
River Keen (11th) in the $4 million Classic, won by inconsistent
Cat Thief; Silverbulletday (sixth) in the Distaff; and Chilukki
(third) in the Juvenile Fillies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we decided anything,'' said D. Wayne Lukas, who
trains Cat Thief and Juvenile Fillies upsetter Cash Run _ and
trained Charismatic.
</P>
<P>
   A quick survey of 10 writers Sunday found five leaning to
Charismatic, three to Artax and one each to Daylami and
Silverbulletday.
</P>
<P>
   Former claiming horse Charismatic nearly swept the Triple Crown,
breaking down while running third in the Belmont Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going to remember his heroics,'' said Gene Guidi of
the Detroit Free Press.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kentucky Derby and Preakness were his only major
victories.
</P>
<P>
   Artax won four major sprints, broke track records held by Dr.
Fager at Aqueduct and Gulch at Belmont Park, and tied the
Gulfstream 6-furlong record with his 1:07.89 Breeders' Cup Sprint
win. He'd be the first dedicated sprinter to win Horse of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's accomplished so much. Why not?'' said trainer Louis
Albertrani.
</P>
<P>
   But he is only 4 for 15 in 1999. He might not even have been
best in the Sprint, because half-length runner-up Kona Gold had to
overcome a bumpy start and an anti-stretch-runner track bias. And
as a sprinter, Artax is, by definition, a horse who failed at tests
of stamina, no small measure of thoroughbred excellence.
</P>
<P>
   Arab-owned, England-based Daylami was widely considered the best
horse in the world after winning major summer turf races in England
and Ireland by five and nine lengths. He ran away with the Turf on
Saturday, ending an 0-for-38 drought for Europe-prepped horses in
Florida Breeders' Cups.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just thought that of the 101 horses who ran in the Breeders'
Cup, he was the one who ran like a champion,'' said Ron Indrisano
of the Boston Globe. ``I'd like to vote for a horse with a touch of
greatness and I think he has that.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Turf was the 5-year-old's first race in America this
year. Even All Along, the French filly who was Horse of the Year in
1983, raced twice here.
</P>
<P>
   Soaring Softly, the Filly and Mare Turf winner; Beautiful
Pleasure, the Distaff winner, and Silverbulletday, unbeaten against
3-year-old fillies, are the female candidates worth mentioning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It says HORSE of the Year. It doesn't say COLT of the Year,''
said Soaring Softly trainer Jim Toner. ``I don't see why we can't
get in the running.''
</P>
<P>
   But none of the females defeated males or posted records
spotless enough to suggest they could.
</P>
<P>
   __ Notes: Hallandale Beach police were investigating the death
of a 45-year-old man who apparently fell 40 feet from a grandstand
catwalk after the races Saturday. The body of Jonathan Lane, a
part-time employee of Miami's Calder Race Course, was discovered by
a Gulfstream maintenance worker. . . . Two-year-old Anees, whose
rally from last to victory in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile signaled a
bright future, will return to Santa Anita and probably begin his
Kentucky Derby preparations there, trainer Alex Hassinger
said.!dlim!!end! &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A 36-year-old former Portuguese track star intruded
on Kenya's annual dominance of the New York City Marathon on
Sunday, but only until he was inside Central Park, less than two
miles from the finish. From there it was all uphill.
</P>
<P>
   That was when Joseph Chebet, who for two years had run his heart
out here only to have it broken, pulled away from Domingos Castro
in the park's winding, gradual inclines to win the marathon's 30th
running on a bright but chilly, windy day.
</P>
<P>
   The 29-year-old Chebet distanced himself forever from his
reputation of the world's second-best marathoner, the way he left
Castro behind and, earlier, his countryman John Kagwe, the two-time
defending champion who faded badly and finished fifth. By winning
in 2 hours 9 minutes 14 seconds, Chebet won $50,000, in addition to
a $20,000 bonus for finishing under 2:10. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Chebet, the fifth Kenyan to win New York in six years, also
became the third runner after the Americans Alberto Salazar in 1982
and Bill Rodgers in 1978 and 1979 to win the Boston and New York
City Marathons in the same year.
</P>
<P>
   American excellence, much less dominance, continued to be
ancient history, as Dan Middleman, a native Long Islander now out
of Raleigh, N.C, ran an American-best 26th, in 2:24:52. Arsenio
Ortiz, a Mexican who lives in Ozone Park, Queens, was 18th
(2:21:35).  &UR;  &LR;  ``One day,'' said Chebet, a whisper of a man with a
slightly stooped but remarkably efficient and consistent stride,
``I was supposed to win in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   In the high altitude of the Kenyan hills, Chebet _ a member of
the Marakwet tribe _ didn't exactly leave this to chance. Motivated
by his breakthrough in Boston, where he also finished second in
1998, Chebet said he added an extra month to the 10 weeks he had
trained for this race the previous two years. He created a
now-or-never mind-set, promising himself that if he didn't win this
time around, he would ``never go back to New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Then it became a matter of execution, of figuring out the best
way to put his extended regimen to use. It did not hurt Chebet that
German Silva, the two-time champion from Mexico best known for
winning in 1994 despite taking a wrong turn into the park, was in
the race as a pace setter, or so-called rabbit, though he had said:
``Please do not call me a rabbit. I am a helper.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, as a fellow member of Team Fila, Silva's presence
enabled him to assist Chebet, as well as the other Kenyans _
including the third-place finisher, Shem Kororia, a Chebet training
partner _ who were decked in the blue and orange colors of the
aforementioned shoe manufacturer. Besides helping to set the pace
for the first 90 minutes of the race, Silva carried on a running
dialogue with the leaders, particularly Chebet and the other Fila
Kenyans. He served as a shield for Chebet from the
20-to-30-mile-an-hour wind gusts that were often in the runners'
faces, played amateur psychologist for those moments when doubts
crept in and even served up a drink or two when Chebet and his
mates happened to miss a water station.
</P>
<P>
   Silva, not in marathon shape after having a wart removed from
his foot, had said he would drop out with the other pace setters
midrace. But when the leaders left the Queensboro Bridge onto First
Avenue at the 16th mile, there was Silva, running strong, with
Castro, Giacomo Leone of Italy, Abdelkhader el-Mouaziz of Morocco
and five Kenyans.
</P>
<P>
   Had Silva set everyone up, including his soul mates in shoe
sales? No, he said later. He was just waiting for the best place
where he could drop out to watch the rest of the race. He found it
in a television truck, which he jumped aboard, giving the
struggling el-Mouaziz one last directive: ``You stay,'' Silva said.
``I go.''
</P>
<P>
   Safely aboard the vehicle, perched in front of a monitor, Silva
watched as the seven leaders continued on, until they neared
Central Park on Fifth Avenue. The race seemed to have the potential
to be a free-for-all to the finish, the antithesis of the one-woman
women's event won by Adriana Fernandez of Mexico. Then, suddenly,
the leader field was down to Castro, Chebet and Kagwe, the muscular
Kenyan who trains in Valley Forge National Park near Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Looking fashionably cool in a wool cap and dark glasses, Kagwe,
with his long, powerful strides, offered no hint of the fate that
awaited him inside the park. Castro made a move. Chebet calmly went
with him. Kagwe, in a matter of a handful of strides, fell far
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost the energy and couldn't do it,'' Kagwe said, later
adding that he didn't feel comfortable after being kicked several
times by ``a Moroccan,'' presumably el-Mouaziz.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was tripped five times; the guy kept on hitting my right
leg,'' he said. ``I said, `Oh, no, this is a race and if I hit him,
I will be the one that will be sued.''' Later, he decided: ``It is
not a big deal. I forgive him.''
</P>
<P>
   Now it was Chebet, free at last of Kagwe, and Castro, a 1988
Olympian in the 5,000 meters who remade himself as a marathoner,
winning in Paris in 1995 and Rotterdam two years later. His twin
brother, Dionisio, ran 33rd among the men Sunday, but Domingos
Castro's problem in the park was separating himself from Chebet. He
tried once, and Chebet stayed with him. He tried again, a third
time, then a fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Chebet instinctively knew his time had come. ``I saw that he was
a bit tired,'' he said. ``So I used a lot of energy, trying to
leave him.''
</P>
<P>
   As Castro, a more animated, less austere runner, began pumping
his arms to keep up, Chebet burst ahead, with about one and
three-quarter miles to go. His 25th mile, run in 4:43, would be the
fastest by anyone in the race. Gabriele Rosa, Chebet's coach, said
later: ``The race went as planned. He moved when I wanted him to
go.''
</P>
<P>
   There was one last chance for Castro, after the right turn onto
Central Park South, a straightaway, before the final turn back into
the park, to the finish. Castro made up a few strides, but not
enough.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Kenya, Chebet said people had told him to ``keep on
training, keep on going.'' He took that advice, through Boston and
the 26 miles 385 yards of New York. He did not turn his head until
he was just a few yards from home, and then he knew he would never
again have to look back with regret on the last two years. &QL;

EXPERT TAKES A STAB AT WHAT'S NEXT FOR MICROSOFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By THE SEATTLE POST-INTELLIGENCER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Friday's findings of fact, handed down by U.S.
District Judge Thomas Jackson in the Department of Justice's
antitrust suit against Microsoft, were just the first step among
several required to resolve the case, according to William Kovacic,
a professor at George Washington University.
</P>
<P>
   Kovacic said he's unaware of any proceedings ever structured
like these. But here's his best guess on what could happen next.
</P>
<P>
   Conclusions of law phase:
</P>
<P>
   _ Within the next month or so, both the Department of Justice
and Microsoft will submit proposed conclusions of law. Conclusions
of law result from applying the Sherman Antitrust Act, and the
cases interpreting it, to the judge's findings of fact.
</P>
<P>
   _ Each side will then have a chance to react to the other side's
proposed conclusions in writing.
</P>
<P>
   _ Then each side gets to orally argue its proposed conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   _ The judge writes his own conclusions; likely sometime in
February, Kovacic said.
</P>
<P>
   Remedy phase:
</P>
<P>
   Then starts the remedy phase, where the judge determines how to
appropriately punish Microsoft and deter future wrongdoing. The
three-step process will likely be repeated, with each side allowed
to:
</P>
<P>
   _ Submit a proposal.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rebut the other side's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   _ Orally argue its proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Figuring one month for Jackson to reach his conclusion, this
phase will extend to April or May 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Kovacic said possible remedies range from milder punishments
that seek to change behavior, to more radical solutions
restructuring the company.
</P>
<P>
   From mildest to most radical, possibilities include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Court orders that Microsoft not behave in a certain manner,
such as enlisting competitors to compete against another company.
</P>
<P>
   _ Requiring the company to sell off or give away its Windows
source code and related knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dividing up the company, creating an applications division, an
operating-system division, and possibly an Internet services
division.
</P>
<P>
   _ Requiring the company to clone itself, creating duplicates of
the entire company in miniature that compete with each other.
</P>
<P>
   Appeal:
</P>
<P>
   Then, almost certainly, will come the appeal of whatever remedy
Jackson hands down. (No remedy will go into effect until all
appeals are exhausted.) By the time the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on
the matter, it will be June 2002, Kovacic predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Settlement (anytime):
</P>
<P>
   A settlement at any time could end the trial immediately.

SPORTS COLUMN: WHEN THE WALL IS INTERNAL AND THE COURSE IS IN THE
HEAD 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Pa.) (ms) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lisa Buster did not run one mile Sunday. But the
gamut of highs and lows she experienced were an emotional marathon
that left her drained at the end of the day. She watched one client
surge toward history, then fade, then surge again, then fade to
fifth. She saw another surge, fade and finish second.
</P>
<P>
   In the multilayered community of marathon running, Buster wears
many hats. She is a runner's agent. Sunday she was a bundle of
nerves and anticipation.
</P>
<P>
   She sat in a private room at Tavern on the Green, watching a
large-screen television with about 30 others, mostly friends and
family of the marathon's elite runners. Buster needed a bird's-eye
view to keep track of her high-profile Kenyan clients: John Kagwe,
the two-time defending champion, and Catherine Ndereba, a top
runner coming off a disappointing performance in the Boston
Marathon.
</P>
<P>
   This was potentially a historic day: a victory here would make
Kagwe, 30, the first man to win back to back to back since Alberto
Salazar won in 1980-82.
</P>
<P>
   For the special occasion, Kagwe's wife, Beatrice, made her first
trip to the United States, leaving their three children at home.
</P>
<P>
   Ndereba's husband, Anthony Maina, a prison warden back home, had
made his first trip the United States as well, leaving their
2-year-old son with his parents.
</P>
<P>
   As the race began, Buster traced the course she had taken to
reach this point: from a career as a radio sports reporter to
television news to doing the weather to managing elite Kenyan
runners in Valley Forge, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Buster did sports radio for five years, covering pro sports in
Washington and North Carolina. When she tried to become a
television sports reporter, Buster said she ran into resistance.
``I had people saying, `Well, I'd never have a woman in my sports
department,''' she said. ``I looked for a job for almost a year in
sports.'' Finally she accepted a job in Montana, where she entered
the world of running.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never involved in running,'' she said. ``When I was out
West, working in television, my boyfriend at the time was a runner.
He knew my boss at the station; he saw me on the air and he wanted
to meet me. That was the first time I really ever knew any
runners.''
</P>
<P>
   After she left the station, Buster and her companion went to
Italy for three months, and a couple of his runner friends asked
Buster to see about finding them some races.
</P>
<P>
   She continued to find races for her friends, even after she
moved back to Philadelphia and worked in marketing. Then she
decided to represent runners for a living. ``There weren't a lot of
people doing this in the early 1980s,'' she said. ``It's not
something I thought I would be doing. You don't just wake up and
say, `I'm going to represent runners for a living.'''
</P>
<P>
   On the screen, Adriana Fernandez was dominating the women's
race, but there was no sign of Ndereba. Buster was calm. ``In
Boston, she went out really fast,'' Buster said, ``so I think now
she's being more conservative.'' In the men's race, Kagwe was
running third and his wife seemed concerned. Buster grabbed her arm
giving assurances that her husband had a strong kick.
</P>
<P>
   Buster said there is no mystery to the Kenyan runners' success.
``They work hard and they sacrifice,'' she said. ``They give every
ounce of energy. It's not magic; it's dedication and focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a major sacrifice for John to leave his wife and his
children; tremendous sacrifice for Catherine to leave her husband
and their 2-year-old son. They make the sacrifice because they're
looking to build a future. They're not here to play.''
</P>
<P>
   The elite race is nearly over now. Kagwe begins to fade in the
last two miles. There are two more hills. Buster tells Beatrice,
whose expression says she already knows, that John does well on
hills. Perhaps he has one kick left.
</P>
<P>
   He does not. Joseph Chebet of Kenya finishes first; Kagwe
finishes a disappointing fifth.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the first runner finishes, client and wife run an
obstacle course past layers of security in an attempt to reach
Kagwe. When they reach the tent for the elite athletes, he says
that a Moroccan runner, Abdel-khader el-Mouaziz, kicked him in the
back of the leg at several points in the race. El-Mouaziz said they
were accidental. Buster wants to file a protest, but Kagwe waves
her off. The race was lost. The day is over.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after the race, Buster is still angry. ``He not only lost
the race but lost a chance for history,'' she said, ``and it wasn't
his fault.''
</P>
<P>
   In her efforts to straighten out the details of Kagwe's race,
Buster missed Ndereba's great finish. Running with the poise and
restraint she lacked in the Boston Marathon, Ndereba surged and
finished second. ``I'm happy for Catherine,'' Buster said.
</P>
<P>
   So now Kagwe and his wife, and Ndereba and her husband, will go
back to Kenya to rejoin their families. Next week sometime, four
more Kenyan clients will join Buster in Pennsylvania to begin the
cycle all over again. &QL;

PAYOFF SCANDAL COULD JUMP-START REFORM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   News flash: The head of the International Boxing Federation was
indicted on charges he took payoffs to improve fighters' rankings.
</P>
<P>
   There's a shock.
</P>
<P>
   This is something boxing insiders have accepted as commonplace _
even at the highest levels of the sport _ since the beginning of
time. The IBF's Bob Lee and others were simply snared as the result
of a federal grand jury inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The important thing now is to seize this opportunity to
eliminate such corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Forces are at work to clean up boxing. Two of the most
vociferous are U.S. senators John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Richard
Bryan (D-Nev.), who have co-authored laws to protect fighters and
the integrity of the sport. However, even they admit that
legislation can do only so much.
</P>
<P>
   In reaction to the IBF scandal, many in the business are saying
it's time to create a national and/or international organization to
oversee and regulate boxing, a la the major sports in this country
and the organizations that govern soccer and track and field
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The logical choice to take the reins in the United States is the
respected Association of Boxing Commissions. The ABC, composed of
government-appointed commissioners from states that sanction
boxing, already has worked to provide national standards under
which the sport operates. Some envision that one day the ABC, under
the watchful eye of federal regulators, could oversee every aspect
of the sport and actually rank fighters.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, no promoter, manager, trainer or fighter would be
allowed to work unless he or she is licensed _ and monitored _ by
the new organization. Thus, boxing's bad elements would be forced
into line or out on the street and the sport would be rid of the
myriad sanctioning bodies altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Congress would have to give its permission to form such an
organization because of antitrust laws, and it likely would do so
in light of the sport's unsavory reputation.
</P>
<P>
   The goal _ virtually !ital!everyone's goal _ is to create
something that has never been associated with boxing: the
perception of integrity.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Goossen of the America Presents promotional firm, which
wants to take a leading role in reform, envisons a day when the
boxing could be lifted to the level of baseball, football and
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just saw a situation where an umpire blew a call in
(baseball's postseason) and it cost a team a game. No one said,
`The fix is in.' That's what we want for boxing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The fact boxing is an international sport complicates things.
The two other major sanctioning organizations _ the World Boxing
Council and World Boxing Association _ are based in Mexico and
Venezuela, respectively. Of course, that means they're not bound by
American law unless they operate in this country.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is that Bob Lee and Co. were busted because they
have the misfortune of operating out of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   So what's the solution? Invite foreign officials to be part of
the ABC and make it a global organization.
</P>
<P>
   FIFA, soccer's governing body, and the IAAF, which runs track
and field, are not perfect, but they've done a credible job and
would be good role models.
</P>
<P>
   And, unlike those groups, an international form of the ABC
should be based in the United States because this is where the
sport thrives. Undeniably, the vast majority of fighters seeking
fame and fortune do it here. This, again, would allow federal
regulators to keep an eye on boxing as it makes the transition from
a rogue sport to a legitimate business.
</P>
<P>
   However, the government isn't likely to help in one regard:
funding. That would be up to those inside the business.
</P>
<P>
   An obvious way to support the ABC is to claim a percentage of
the profits or a set fee from each boxing show. As it is now, in
championship fights, promoters must pay to a sanctioning body a fee
for the right to that body's belt. That money could simply be
redirected to the ABC.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Goossen said America Presents already is pursuing
corporate and private sponsorship to fund the ABC and has had
received favorable initial responses.
</P>
<P>
   So, all the elements seem to be in place: the need for a
responsible, government-monitored body to oversee the sport; the
embryo of such an organization (the ABC); and realistic funding
possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Let's get it done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows that now's the time to get together,'' promoter
Bob Arum said.
</P>
<P>
   __ The leaders?: Goossen, who once ran Ten Goose Boxing in Van
Nuys, and America Presents have a specific plan to reform the
sport.
</P>
<P>
   First, the ABC would be given the authority to oversee the
sport. That includes the naming of a commissioner _ selected from
among current state appointees _ like that of the major sports.
Among the commission's duties would be to approve all contracts,
which would protect otherwise vulnerable fighters.
</P>
<P>
   Second, a school for judges and referees would be established.
All officials must graduate from the school and would be evaluated
regularly. They also would have to earn the right to work bouts
based solely on performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like other sports, they would work the biggest events through
merit and not through who you know,'' Goossen said.

   __ De La Hoya-Trinidad II: Arum, Oscar De La Hoya's promoter,
said he and Don King, Felix Trindad's promoter, are scheduled to
begin negotiations this weekend for a rematch. He's confident that
two will meet as soon as April in what would be De La Hoya's next
fight.
</P>
<P>
   Arum also said it's possible De La Hoya could fight IBF junior
middleweight champion Francisco Castillejo at Staples Center early
next year and then fight Trinidad around June.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Arum said, Trinidad has no choice but to fight De La
Hoya again because he cannot make anywhere near the money he would
make fighting anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to happen. (King) has a fighter with no earning
potential,'' Arum said.

   Trinidad won a decision in September.

   __ No butts about it: After the controversial draw in the first
Lennox Lewis-Evander Holyfield bout at Madison Square Garden, one
might expect the main concern of Lewis and trainer Emanuel Lewis to
be the judging when the two meet again Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Not so. They're worried most about how referee Mitch Halpern
will do his job.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis and Steward believe Holyfield purposely butts his
opponents. In fact, Lewis insists Holyfield practices it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He actually practices it with the heavy bag. He has a ring
(drawn) on the bag and practices head-butting,'' said Lewis, who
didn't say how he would know this.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield's reaction?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to get into these different tactics Lennox is
always bringing up,'' he said. ``He's just trying to get people to
watch me so he can do something even more outrageous.'' &QL;

 &HT;    MAN FAVORED TO WIN FIRST MEXICAN PRIMARY SAID HE DID IT HIS WAY
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>

Monday, EST. This embargo includes Cox Newspapers customers in

</P>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY If he wins this Sunday's presidential primary as
expected, Francisco Labastida Ochoa knows there are two ways
history will judge him in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   He could be seen as the first man who had to publicly fight to
win voters' hearts and become the presidential nominee for Mexico's
formidable Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
</P>
<P>
   Or he could be seen as yet another candidate selected by the
PRI's clever party managers, who feigned democracy and helped
guarantee him victory in the party's first presidential primary
election this century.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the first votes were cast in Sunday's election, it
was obvious Labastida was trying to bolster his image as a
political figure in his own right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is all this from spontaneous combustion?'' Labastida joked in
an interview with foreign reporters before the primary. ``If memory
serves me well, before I became a candidate I was a federal
secretary (cabinet member) three times.''
</P>
<P>
   Labastida is a 57-year-old lifelong PRI member with more than 30
years of service in PRI governments. He was Mexican President
Ernesto Zedillo's agriculture secretary and interior secretary
before he quit to run for his party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   If opinion and exit polls are correct, Sunday's vote will make
him the first PRI presidential candidate to be elected by voters
rather than appointed solely by the President of Mexico in the now
infamous ``dedazo,'' or ``big finger.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1929 every president of Mexico has selected the PRI's next
presidential candidate, and, in effect, his successor without the
benefit of input from the party's grassroots sympathizers. Sunday's
election is supposed to bury the so-called ``big finger'' and make
way for a ``new PRI'' - a party that's more democratic, in touch
with disgruntled Mexicans and ready to crack down on notorious
corruption within its ranks.
</P>
<P>
   With a candidate who has proved his appeal to voters in a
primary, the party reasons, it increases its chances of once again
winning the presidency in next year's July 2 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   But Labastida is fighting a widespread belief among Mexicans
that he's another pampered PRI candidate that the party's apparatus
favored over three other candidates.
</P>
<P>
   And this time, those angry accusations are also coming from
Labastida's own comrades within the PRI. The PRI's opposition
parties are already leaping at the chance to echo complaints of
vote buying lodged during the campaign by Labastida rivals Roberto
Madrazo, Manuel Bartlett and Humberto Roque Villanueva.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida says he personally earned the ample support from PRI
union and sympathizers he counted on throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1970 I managed a fourth of the country's budget,'' he said.
``I traveled the country, managing resources related to the
distribution of water . . . education, health, hospitals, etc. Some
of these relationships (forged with people) served me well.''
</P>
<P>
   If Labastida wins the PRI's primary against a backdrop of cries
of fraud from his rivals, he could face a tremendous additional
challenge to his credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida's chief rival, Roberto Madrazo, will either refuse to
endorse Labastida or break with the party in the event of fraud,
many analysts here say.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida says he doesn't need Madrazo to win. But he might need
some of Madrazo's supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida says he told Madrazo in their last conversation about
a month ago, ``Obviously, the risk of a crisis exists in the party.
Our campaign teams are fired up. If you win, you will need my
people to triumph (in 2000). If I win I'll need your people. If
we're speaking honestly, we need to tell things the way they are.''

PRIMO NEBIOLO, 76, WHO LED WORLD TRACK FEDERATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Primo Nebiolo, a powerful and controversial figure in
international sports who brought track and field out of the amateur
ranks as president of its world governing body for almost two
decades, died Sunday at a hospital in Rome. He was 76.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, according to Giorgio Reineri, a
spokesman for the International Amateur Athletic Federation, which
Nebiolo had led since 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Nebiolo was re-elected to a four-year term as IAAF president on
Aug. 17. The federation's senior vice president, Lamine Diack of
Senegal, has taken over as acting president. The IAAF council will
meet Nov. 18-19 in Monaco to consider arrangements for election of
a successor.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s and 1990s, Nebiolo emerged as a major power in the
sports world, along with Juan Antonio Samaranch, the International
Olympic Committee president, and Joao Havelange, who headed FIFA,
soccer's world governing body. As a member of the IOC, Nebiolo
supported Samaranch in the face of criticism over the last year
that the IOC was elitist, autocratic and prone to favoritism.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that was because Nebiolo operated the IAAF in much the
same fashion. He was a figure of great ego and ambition who
expected to be treated regally and drew criticism as an intractable
autocrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``He probably has an ego metabolism that takes more feeding than
others,'' LeRoy Walker, then the U.S. Olympic Committee president,
said in 1993. ``He is the president and wants to be treated that
way. He likes being exalted beyond all others.''
</P>
<P>
   But Nebiolo deflected accusations that he wielded unbridled
power. ``Hitler and Mussolini were dictators,'' he said. ``What am
I a dictator of, athletics?''
</P>
<P>
   However he was viewed, there was no denying his instrumental
role in helping to bring money and corporate sponsorship to track
and field, known as ``athletics'' in international competition.
</P>
<P>
   When Nebiolo took office for another term in 1995, Joe Douglas,
the manager of Carl Lewis, who became a millionaire in the
lucrative world of track and field that Nebiolo presided over,
praised him for ``making the sport professional and taking it out
of the Dark Ages.''
</P>
<P>
   Nebiolo was president of an organization that retained the word
``amateur'' but instituted large prize fees, world-record bonuses,
appearance fees and a host of world championship events. When
Nebiolo became IAAF president, it had a budget of about $50,000.
Now its budget is estimated at $40 million yearly, much of it
generated by television and sponsorship fees.
</P>
<P>
   Primo Nebiolo was born on July 14, 1923, in Turin, Italy. He
studied law and political science and was successful in the
construction business before turning his business skills to the
sports world.
</P>
<P>
   Nebiolo's start in sports came when he was a long jumper, but he
was often self-deprecating about his athleticism. ``When I
competed, we were lucky to have 50 spectators,'' he once said.
</P>
<P>
   His original base of power was the International University
Sports Federation, which he took over in 1961 when it was a tiny
organization and which he headed at his death. He built its World
University Games into the world's second-biggest athletic
competition, after the Summer Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   He had served as president of the Association of Summer Olympic
Federations since 1983, was president of the Italian Athletics
Federation from 1969 to 1989 and had been a member of the
International Olympic Committee since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Through his four decades in international sports, he weathered
many controversial episodes.
</P>
<P>
   At the 1987 world championships in Rome, Giovanni Evangelisti of
Italy won the bronze medal in the long jump, but the medal was
taken away after investigations showed that Italian officials
rigged the measurement. Nebiolo was not implicated, but he quit his
post as head of Italian track and field two years later.
</P>
<P>
   The refurbishment of the Olympic Stadium in Rome for the 1990
World Cup of soccer became entangled in a scandal involving cost
overruns. Nebiolo was indicted in connection with that but was
cleared of any improper involvement.
</P>
<P>
   He was a master of shrewd maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, when Nebiolo stripped the disgraced sprinter Ben
Johnson of his records after a positive drug test at the 1988
Summer Olympics, many officials were surprised to learn that they
had voided Johnson's achievements when they thought they had voted
on adjourning for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Nebiolo gained long-sought membership on the IOC in 1992 when he
threatened not to approve participation by South African runners at
the Barcelona Olympics later that year if he wasn't selected.
</P>
<P>
   He waged a protracted legal battle with Butch Reynolds, the
former 400-meter world record-holder. In 1990, the IAAF suspended
Reynolds for a positive drug test. Reynolds, who claimed the test
was flawed, sued and won a $27.3 million judgment against the IAAF
in a U.S. court. But the IAAF refused to pay and eventually won a
verdict that the U.S. courts had no jurisdiction in the case.
</P>
<P>
   At the 1993 world championships, Reynolds helped the United
States break the world record for the 1,600-meter relay _ and
Nebiolo presented the medals, kissing Reynolds on both cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Nebiolo touched off a furor in Sweden when he responded
to a reporter's questioning him about his autocratic style by
asking her about her sexual habits.
</P>
<P>
   This year, in a capstone to his career, Nebiolo, who is survived
by his wife, Giovanna, helped his native city of Turin successfully
bid to stage the 2006 Winter Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch, whose IOC was often engaged in power disputes with
Nebiolo's track and field unit, paid tribute to Nebiolo on Sunday
as ``one of the greatest leading sportsmen of this century.''
</P>
<P>
   Nebiolo, who was unpaid for his athletic endeavors, was no
apologist for his lofty reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that all big men in life want to get some position
for themselves,'' he once said. ``If you don't have ambitions in a
position where you don't receive money, why are you doing this? You
do this surely for ambition.''

   The New York Times' computer football ranking is based on an
analysis of each team's scores with emphasis on three factors: who
won, by what margin and against what quality of opposition. The
quality of an opponent is determined by examining its record
against other teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Times' computer model collapses runaway scores and takes
note of a home-field advantage. Recent games count more than
earlier games.
</P>
<P>
   The top team is assigned a rating of 1.000; the ratings of all
other teams are percentages reflecting their strengths relative to
the top team. This week, for example, there is a fairly large
difference between Florida State (No. 1) and Tennessee (2), but the
difference between Tennessee (2) and Florida (3) is much smaller.
</P>
<P>
   The cumulative records and average margin of victory of each
team's opponents do not include games against the ranked team.

 &HT;    Rookie Stewart wins second race, rises to fourth in standings
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Avondale, Ariz. _ Rookie NASCAR driver Tony Stewart doused
race-team owner Joe Gibbs with champagne after winning Sunday's
Dura Lube 500.
</P>
<P>
   There were plenty of reasons for the two to celebrate. With his
victory at Phoenix International Raceway, Stewart became the second
driver in Winston Cup's modern era to win two races in his rookie
season. Davey Allison was the first to accomplish the feat in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Tony to win just one race this year was incredible, beyond
my wildest dreams,'' said Gibbs, owner of Joe Gibbs Racing. ``For
him to win two as a rookie ... I just can't put it into words.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, 28, also has the chance to become the first rookie to
finish in the top five of the Winston Cup points standings since
James Hylton finished second in 1966. Stewart moved from fifth to
fourth in the points standings, passing Jeff Gordon, who finished
10th in Sunday's race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter much to me that I finish ahead of Jeff
Gordon in the points,'' said Stewart, who also won at Richmond.
``It's probably more important to the fans, based on all the cheers
I get when I pass Jeff.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart said he knew he had the best car in the 43-car field
after about 50 laps of the 312-lap event. He led three times for
150 laps, including the final 39. After crossing the finish line,
he took his car through some doughnut spins and then cruised
backward around the track.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really needed a good race here,'' Stewart said. ``I told
(crew chief Greg Zipadelli) in victory lane that this was a
personal victory for me. We were in a slump.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Martin finished second, followed by Bobby Labonte and Jeff
Burton.
</P>
<P>
   Labonte gained 15 points on Dale Jarrett, who has a 231-point
advantage in the standings with two races remaining. Jarrett
avoided disaster, blowing a tire early in the race and dropping a
lap down. But he rallied to finish sixth.
</P>
<P>
   He needs to finish eighth or better in Sunday's race at
Homestead, Fla., to clinch the Winston Cup title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm definitely happy about this race,'' Jarrett said. ``I
guess Bobby gained a few points on us, but not too many. If we do
our job (at Homestead) and finish in the top 10, that should pretty
much do it for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Labonte: ``As far as the points, we've got to go through it
another week. I thought it would be over with by now.''

 &HT;    Falcons, unable to protect the quarterback, fall to 2-7
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ They were playing the wrong song Sunday in the Georgia
Dome with 1:49 left in the Atlanta Falcons' game against
Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   The Twisted Sister tune, ``We're Not Gonna Take It,'' was a poor
choice on two counts.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Falcons had no choice but to take it. They were, in
every way, powerless to change the outcome of a 30-7 loss to a
Jacksonville team that looked like a good bet to return in January
for Super Bowl XXXIV.
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, the Falcons can't take each other anymore.
</P>
<P>
   This team looks nothing like last year's Super Bowl team, which
had great chemistry; instead, it looks like a team ready to
cannibalize itself.
</P>
<P>
   Thank NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue for the bye week that's
coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the worst exhibition of offense I have ever seen in
my life,'' said wide receiver Terance Mathis, who entered the game
with an NFC-high 47 receptions, and added three harmless catches
for a meager 28 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish (the bye) would have come three or four weeks earlier.
It's a chance for guys to get away from each other, and that's
going to be a welcome relief.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Lester Archambeau agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not such a bad idea, considering we're 2-7,'' he said.
``I mean, shoot, this is not the way we planned for this year to
go. It's a great time for individuals to recap their seasons. I've
been here seven years; I've been through some rough ... stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The first half Sunday could have been rougher. It was a miracle
the Jaguars' lead wasn't more than 17-0 in the second quarter; the
Falcons had three of their four turnovers in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   A few stand-up performances by the defense, including a blocked
field goal by cornerback Ray Buchanan, and an 84-yard drive at the
end of the second quarter pulled the Falcons within 17-7 at
halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Befitting the season, however, Tim Dwight's 99-yard kickoff
return to start the second half was called back because rookie
safety Johndale Carty was penalized for an illegal block.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, it was 20-7 Jacksonville, and the supposed sellout crowd,
which included at least 12,000 empty seats, booed the rest of the
way.
</P>
<P>
   The day's recipe for defeat? Falcons running back Ken Oxendine
rushed five times and Byron Hanspard four times, each for 11 yards.
Jacksonville's Fred Taylor rushed 27 times for 124 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars had no turnovers. The Falcons allowed Jacksonville a
franchise-high nine sacks, and Atlanta mustered a mere 182 total
yards and 10 first downs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we had made some progress in the last couple
weeks,'' coach Dan Reeves said. ``You name it, we did it (wrong).''
</P>
<P>
   Had the Falcons won, games against Tampa Bay, Carolina and New
Orleans after the bye week might have looked like three possible
steps toward a .500 record.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the bye looks like a temporary stay of execution.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was like a playoff game for us,'' Dwight said. ``We just
came up short by, what, 22 points?''
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Falcons can't even get their math right.

NETSCAPE AT CORE OF JUDGE'S RULING AGAINST MICROSOFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN COOK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Begin ital) The federal court's view of the relationship
between Microsoft and Netscape Communications Corp. _ key players
in a so-called ``browser war,'' _ is central to Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson's finding last Friday that Microsoft is a
monopolist whose actions hurt both competitors and consumers. (End
ital)
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ In the summer of 1995, Netscape Communications Corp.
was on a roll.
</P>
<P>
   The Mountain View, Calif., company's Navigator Web browser, well
on its way to 10 million customers, was the standard method of
searching for content on the Internet. An August initial public
offering, just 16 months after the company was founded, raised $140
million. And Netscape's products, including large corporate servers
and Internet tools, were being used by about 70 percent of Fortune
100 companies.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Barksdale, who joined Netscape as chief executive in January
of that year, was predicting big things for the fast growing
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough fight _ I'll grant you that _ but we're brave,''
Barksdale remarked at a Price Waterhouse forum in Seattle on Dec.
8th, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're well financed. We believe that God is on our side.''
</P>
<P>
   But in order to survive in the rapidly changing technology
industry, Netscape needed more than divine intervention.
</P>
<P>
   It also needed important technical information from Microsoft
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   What Netscape wanted in the summer of 1995 was technical
information _ termed Application Program Interfaces or APIs _ that
would allow it to build its Navigator browser to run on Windows 95,
the dominant operating system of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's ruling on Friday said Microsoft
denied Netscape access to that technical information in order to
protect its status as the world's leading software developer. The
judge also said that once Microsoft saw Netscape Navigator as a
threat, it used its monopoly power to retard and extinguish ``the
process by which (Netscape Navigator and Sun's Java) could have
facilitated the introduction of competition into an important
market.''
</P>
<P>
   Netscape, which was sold to America Online last November, is at
the crux of Jackson's ruling. It's mentioned throughout the
207-page document. And its saga is central to understanding how
Jackson came to his decision Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In the early summer of 1995, Microsoft was running far behind on
the Internet and it needed to move fast to catch up. Microsoft
chairman Bill Gates penned those sentiments in a May 1995 memo
called ``The Internet Tidal Wave,'' in which Netscape was described
as a new competitor born on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   That memo was a call to arms at the Redmond software campus. It
also led to an important meeting between Microsoft and Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   On June 21, 1995, Microsoft officials, including Daniel Rosen
and Thomas Reardon, met Netscape's senior executives in Mountain
View to discuss the possibility of forming a partnership.
</P>
<P>
   The ``special relationship,'' as it is called in Judge Jackson's
finding, would have given Netscape preferential treatment if the
company abandoned its plans for a browser to run on Windows 95. The
Microsoft officials told Netscape it could continue to develop its
browser for the Macintosh operating system, UNIX and 16-bit
Windows. But Windows 95 was off limits if Netscape used its own API
technology to compete with Microsoft's planned browser, Jackson
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Microsoft representatives made it clear ... that Microsoft
would be marketing its own browser for Windows 95, and that its
product would rely on Microsoft's platform-level Internet
technologies,'' Jackson wrote. ``If Netscape marketed its own
browsing software for Windows 95 based on different technologies,
then Microsoft would view Netscape as a competitor, not a
partner.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, Jackson wrote, also indicated that the speed at which
Netscape received the key technology information to build Navigator
for Windows 95 would depend on whether Netscape signed the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape was in a bind. It needed technology from Microsoft. But
it couldn't agree to give up its Windows 95 browser.
</P>
<P>
   When the Microsoft officials sensed that Netscape would turn
down the offer, Microsoft stopped calling the company. Microsoft
also lived up to its promise of delaying the delivery of the API
technical information for three months, wrote Jackson, causing
Netscape to postpone the release of its Windows 95 browser and miss
out on key holiday sales.
</P>
<P>
   The June 21, 1995, meeting was a historic event. Microsoft and
Netscape executives, who testified at the antitrust hearings in
Washington D.C., still dispute what happened. But Jackson, who
listened to lawyers and witnesses from both sides, appears to be
saying in his findings of fact that the type of behavior exhibited
by Microsoft at the meeting is monopolistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``These interactions demonstrate that it is Microsoft's
corporate practice to pressure other firms to halt software
development that either shows the potential to weaken the
applications barrier to entry or competes with Microsoft's most
cherished software products,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson also uses the Netscape example as a springboard to tell
how other firms such as RealNetworks, Intel and IBM suffered at the
hand of Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   After the June 21 meeting, Microsoft began pouring money and
resources into the development of Internet Explorer. The company
increased the number of developers working on the project from half
a dozen in early 1995 to more than 1,000 in 1999. It also spent
more than $100 million each year developing its new browser, wrote
Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the playing field in the browser war began to
shift.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft held just two percent of the browser market in January
1996, compared to Netscape's 71 percent. Two and a half years
later, the market was nearly dead even. Microsoft's Internet
Explorer held 45 percent while Netscape's Navigator held 54
percent. By April of this year, Microsoft was in the lead with 59
percent of computer users relying on Internet Explorer as their
primary browser.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft used several tactics to gain market share for its
browser. Those cited by Jackson include giving the product away,
dropping the Windows royalty price for computer makers in exchange
for promotion of Internet Explorer, and constricting Netscape's
access to distribution channels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft's restrictions succeeded in raising the costs to
OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) of pre-installing and
promoting Navigator,'' wrote Jackson, on page 103 of the finding.
``These increased costs, in turn, were in some cases significant
enough to deter OEMs from pre-installing Navigator altogether. In
other cases, ... OEMs decided not to pre-install Navigator after
Microsoft brought more pressure to bear.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft said the restrictions placed on computer manufacturers
were used to uphold the quality and consistency of Windows, not to
damage Netscape. But Jackson takes aim at that argument as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft would not have imposed prohibitions that burdened
OEMs and consumers with substantial costs, lowered the value of
Windows and harmed the company's relations with major OEMs had it
not felt that the measures were necessary to maximize Internet
Explorer's share of browser usage at Navigator's expense,'' he
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's ruling, while not defining Microsoft's actions as
illegal, is strong. For many former Netscape employees it is the
first step towards vindication.
</P>
<P>
   ``These landmark findings of fact prove Microsoft is one of the
most powerful and stifling monopolies of the century and illegally
abused its operating system software in bid to control the market
for Internet browsers,'' said former Netscape chief executive Jim
Barksdale in a statement released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Misner, who worked at Netscape from 1996 to June of this
year, said he greeted the findings with tempered enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   No champagne toasts.
</P>
<P>
   No tears of joy.
</P>
<P>
   The damage to Netscape has been done, he said. And Microsoft has
already altered some if its aggressive business practices, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does not change the past,'' said the former director of
strategic development at Netscape. ``The thing that I feel really
great about is that all of these startups that have come out of
Netscape in the past six months ... don't have to compete on an
uneven playing field in the future.''

CRASH VICTIMS' RELATIVES SEEK SOLACE IN RITUALS

<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I. _ The roses drifted seaward shortly before sunset
on Sunday, drawn away from the rocky shoreline by a crisp northerly
wind. ``Allahu akbar,'' the mourners wailed in Arabic. ``God is
great.'' Another voice, that of a woman crying in English, carried
out over the stones and surf. ``My baby, my baby, my baby,'' she
screamed, as Red Cross workers nearby wept.
</P>
<P>
   More than 250 grieving relatives and friends attended a memorial
service Sunday for the passengers and crew of EgyptAir Flight 990,
which crashed a week ago in waters south of Nantucket.
</P>
<P>
   Flight 990 carried all manner of people when it departed Kennedy
International Airport in New York, bound for Cairo, Egypt, and
climbed through the darkness to 33,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Among the passengers were Egyptian army officers who had
completed training in the United States, American and Canadian
tourists planning trips to the pyramids and the Nile, Egyptian
students who had been on exchange trips in U.S. schools, and
off-duty airline employees who were returning home after work
around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   They came from seven nations, and observed three faiths. All 217
died.
</P>
<P>
   ``The families and friends of those we lost never had the
opportunity to bid farewell,'' said the Egyptian ambassador to the
United States, Nabil Al Fahmy. ``So little can be said to relieve
their pain.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, knowing little more about the crash than they did
when they arrived in Rhode Island last week, the victims' families
sought solace in rituals of faith and symbols of grief. They
gathered in a tent near the water at Brenton Point State Park and
participated an interfaith service with Christian, Jewish and
Muslim clergy.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed ElHattab, assistant secretary-general of the Islamic
Society of North America, instructed the mourners to submit to
God's will. ``Lo, we belong to God, and lo, we are returning,''
said ElHattab. ``Let us remember it is God who grants life, and it
is he who takes us back.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Marc Jagolinzer, president of the Rhode Island Board of
Rabbis, said the dead would live on in the memories of their
friends and families.
</P>
<P>
   ``Death cannot rob us of our past _ the years, the dreams, the
experiences we have shared,'' said Jagolinzer. ``What we have had,
we shall always have.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Marco Girgis of the St. Mary and St. Mena Coptic
Orthodox Church in Cranston asked God to receive the plane's
passengers in the afterlife.
</P>
<P>
   ``Open for them, O Lord, the doors of paradise,'' Girgis said,
standing at a lectern that held miniature flags of the victims'
seven homelands: Canada, Egypt, Germany, Sudan, Syria, the United
States and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   After the service, the relatives were led from the tent down
what organizers called a ``corridor of honor,'' a road lined by Red
Cross grief counselors, National Transportation Safety Board
employees, U.S. Coast Guard and Navy sailors, and clergy. Each
family member was given a white rose.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As cries began to rise on the wind, some kissed the roses and
placed them in a white wicker basket, which will be flown to the
crash site and have its contents spread over the sea. Others,
accompanied by sailors, walked to the rocky shoreline and tossed
their flowers into the surf. A few, overcome, needed to be propped
up by sailors or other mourners.
</P>
<P>
   The service was held at a point facing south, toward the two
debris fields that the Navy located roughly 110 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   The wreckage and the passengers' remains rest beyond the shoals
of Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket, and farther offshore still, on
a smooth plateau inside the steep edge of the continental shelf.
</P>
<P>
   As the flowers drifted seaward, the same wind that had created a
menacing ocean swell tugged at the relatives' clothing and hair,
and the horizon seemed to waver, a sign that heavy swells persisted
at the crash site, where the Navy had suspended the latest search.
</P>
<P>
   The service on Sunday marked an end to a week of grief and
repeated disappointment. First, the families were told to expect no
one to have survived the six-mile fall to the sea and the extended
stay in chilly water. Then each day they received news of suspended
or unsuccessful searches.
</P>
<P>
   By Saturday, when they viewed the tiny bits of wreckage under
tents at the Quonset Point Air National Guard Base, many had come
to realize that they might never even receive their relatives'
remains.
</P>
<P>
   Samir El Shanawany, general manager of EgyptAir's North American
operations, said that 340 relatives and friends had made the
pilgrimage to Rhode Island. With the service over, many were
expected to leave Newport and wait for further news from home.

   You shoulda seen the whoppers that got away from Fox while it
was trying to cram the ``When Wild Bass Get Caught on Tape''
tournament into its sports-programming lineup Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Such as another episode of Pamela Anderson Lee in ``V.I.P.''
</P>
<P>
   Endless Wal-Mart commercials, debates about crankbait versus
spinnerbait and interviews with fish-catchers on Lake Lulu who were
thanking the Lord for helping them hook them big-mouths weren't
painful enough. In the end, no one seemed to know who had won the
darn-gum thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people haven't seen a weigh-in, they're in for a treat,''
said Joe Buck before the fiasco when the official-looking guy
throwing the fish into the bucket that apparently had a scale
underneath seemed to lose track of who was leading. In his ``Hey
Verne'' voice, he asked the guy in the sponsor-decorated shirt next
to him. He shrugged. Another guy walked in front of the camera.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it was decided some cattle rancher from Oklahoma named
Darrel would be given the oversized check for $600,000.
</P>
<P>
   Yup, that !ital!was pretty special.
</P>
<P>
   So, hey, next time some out-of-touch high-level senior exec at

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: TINKERING AT THE MARGINS OF ANTI-GAY BIGOTRY
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By BRENT STAPLES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The integration of the American military stands as this
country's most striking transformation of the century. Harry Truman
issued the executive order ending segregation in 1948, and by 1956,
white recruits from the most bigoted reaches of the South were
being ordered around by black drill sergeants at boot camp.
</P>
<P>
   Under the edict, known racists were no longer allowed to hold
positions of authority and were eventually weeded out. Within a few
decades, the military had more black managers by far than the
civilian sector, which still has not caught up. As the military
sociologist Charles Moskos wrote: ``Today, one is more likely to
hear racial jokes at the university faculty club than in the
officers' club. And in the officers' club, one will surely see more
blacks.''
</P>
<P>
   The integration of the military was vital to national security
and yielded an enormous benefit for the country as a whole. But it
would have taken substantially longer had Truman yielded to the
military's desire to tinker at the margins of bigotry instead of
rooting it out.
</P>
<P>
   Not long before Truman's order, a military panel suggested that
white soldiers would never accept blacks as commanders or comrades
in arms. The panel proposed keeping black numbers down through a
quota system and limiting black troops to support units, where they
would build roads or off-load ships. By rejecting this approach,
Truman delegitimized segregation in one swift movement.
</P>
<P>
   The perils of tinkering at the margins have become especially
clear with ``don't ask, don't tell,'' the policy that governs the
military's dealings with gay soldiers. The policy was billed as a
way to permit gay Americans to serve without fear of harassment or
expulsion _ as long as they kept sexual preferences to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But since the policy was put in place in 1994, the number of
soldiers being dismissed for reasons related to homosexuality has
risen dramatically. These losses present a reduction in military
readiness, given the difficulties in meeting recruitment targets.
In addition, the policy seems to have made circumstances worse for
gay soldiers under the guise of bringing them into the fold.
</P>
<P>
   Data from the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network shows that
dismissals under ``don't ask, don't tell'' have risen from 617 in
1994 to 1,163 in 1998. The Air Force had the most discharges of any
branch last year with 415 _ an astonishing 65 percent of which came
at a single Air Force base in Lackland, Texas. The Air Force says
recruits were claiming to be gay to escape service when the going
got tough. But given that Air Force training is relatively mild and
that the recruits are volunteers, deception to escape the service
seems less than the full story.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers from the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network visited
Lackland this fall and filed a report with the Air Force describing
several problems with how ``don't ask, don't tell'' was being
administered. The core issue was that briefings describing the
policy to new recruits were indirect and ambiguous. Network
investigators say they could not find a single recruit who
understood the policy or what it entitled service members to do or
not do.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the material bearing on ``don't ask, don't tell''
was tacked on to a discussion of the military code of justice,
leading some recruits to think that they would be expelled for
being gay with or without incriminating revelations. Other new
soldiers got the impression that the Air Force honor code obligated
them to confess sexual preferences _ and that they could face
imprisonment if they withheld the truth and were later found out.
</P>
<P>
   The network report says that even the base inspector general
misunderstood the policy, and felt it his duty to report anything
he heard. In a striking disregard for doctor-patient
confidentiality, a post psychologist told Network investigators
that it was his ``duty'' to inform on gay patients _ even though
none of the services require doctors to break confidence in this
fashion. In other words, recruits who had questions about a poorly
presented policy were risking self-incrimination and dismissal if
they spoke to anyone at all.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force says it has reduced the number of dismissals at
Lackland by allowing recruits to recant self-incriminating
statements and reworked the instructional package to make the
policy clearer.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force officials have also instructed recruits with questions
to seek out service defense lawyers, who are obligated by law to
preserve lawyer-client privilege. Unfortunately, including lawyers
in this equation deepens the impression that gay soldiers are
criminals by virtue of sexual preference. As a rule, jiggering with
a bad policy is likely to make it worse.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton could have avoided this nightmare by issuing a
Trumanesque directive banning anti-gay discrimination in the armed
services back in 1994. The Pentagon would have grumbled at first
but would also have done what it was told. By tinkering at the
margins, Congress and the president have ensured that the military
will be divided over this issue long after the civilian world has
put it to rest. The fatal mistake was compromising with bigotry in
the first place. &QL;

ON COLLEGE FOOTBALL: PENN STATE PLAYS IT TOO CLOSE FOR COMFORT 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   It seems disrespectful to think of a grand old game like the
Rose Bowl as a consolation prize, but that's what it will amount to
for Penn State. And that is only if the Nittany Lions can qualify
to play the Pacific-10 Conference champion in Pasadena, Calif., no
sure thing now. Ranked No. 2 last week, Penn State fell to No. 6 in
the Associated Press broadcasters' and writers' poll, No. 8 in the
USA Today/ESPN coaches' poll and No. 9 in the New York Times
computer ranking Sunday after losing by 24-23 to Minnesota in Happy
Valley on Saturday. The Nittany Lions (9-1 overall, 5-1 in the Big
Ten) have little chance now to play in the Sugar Bowl in the
national championship game between the two top-ranked schools as
judged by a consensus of ratings in the Bowl Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, the Lions are in second place in the Big Ten, a
half-game behind Wisconsin's 6-1. Assuming that Wisconsin defeats
last-place Iowa in its season finale on Saturday, the Badgers would
finish with a conference record of 7-1 and an overall record of
9-2. Penn State could clinch the Rose Bowl berth and finish 11-1
overall and in a 7-1 tie for the conference title with victories
over Michigan on Saturday at home and at Michigan State on Nov. 20.
</P>
<P>
   The first tie breaker for the Rose Bowl berth is head-to-head
competition, but the Lions and the Badgers do not face each other
this season. The next tie breaker is overall record, which would be
in Penn State's favor, assuming two difficult victories over the
Wolverines and the Spartans. The third tie breaker is that the most
recent Rose Bowl qualifier is eliminated and Wisconsin went last
season.
</P>
<P>
   But it may be difficult for Coach Joe Paterno to rally his team
against two ranked opponents after a loss to the Golden Gophers on
a last-second field goal. Michigan has defeated Penn State in their
last two meetings, by 27-0 in Ann Arbor last season and by 34-8 in
Happy Valley in 1997. Michigan is 12th in The Times ranking and
Michigan State is 17th. Minnesota moved up to No. 21 and Wisconsin
is 10th. All might be even higher if Big Ten teams didn't have to
play each other, forcing someone to lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the toughest conference you can play in,'' said
Rashard Casey, one of Penn State's two quarterbacks. ``Any team can
lose at any time.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Rose Bowl, the Florida Citrus Bowl has the second
selection from eligible Big Ten teams. Next in line are the
Outback, the Alamo and the Sun. Both Michigan and Michigan State
have records of 4-2 in the conference and 7-2 overall.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Cerimele, the Penn State fullback, said: ``We've got two
tough ones coming up. Next week's very important for us. I think
this team is going to bounce back and come back fighting. This team
is made up of a bunch of fighters and champions. We're not going to
fold. There is no doubt in my mind we are going to come out
fighting. We are going to give Michigan a great game and hopefully
come out on top.''
</P>
<P>
   Cerimele admitted that he cried after losing on Saturday on a
32-yard field goal by Dan Nystrom. Also in tears was LaVar
Arrington, the star linebacker who had a career-best 15 tackles.
``Call me selfish,'' Arrington said, ``but I was just thinking
about the Sugar Bowl. I had gotten to the point where I felt we'd
win every close game.''
</P>
<P>
   And this one was close all day. The Gophers held leads of 9-7
and 21-20. Penn State took its third lead of the game at 23-21 with
9 minutes 12 seconds remaining when Travis Forney kicked his third
field goal of the game, his second from 44 yards. His only miss had
been from 50 yards when he hit a goal-post upright with the wind at
his back. Instead of allowing Forney to try the same thing again on
Penn State's last possession, Paterno decided to punt with the line
of scrimmage the Minnesota 33.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Mason, coach of Minnesota, said he was happy about
Paterno's decision ``because Forney is that good of a kicker and I
knew he could hit one from 50 yards out.'' A field goal then would
have put the Gophers down by 5 points and would have forced them to
try for a touchdown. Mason also said he agreed with Paterno's
decision to punt and try to pin the Gophers deep in their own end.
But the punt went into the end zone and Minnesota started the final
drive from its 20, a change of only 13 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Paterno, reflecting on the decision, later said: ``I don't think
I thought twice about that one. I just figured they're not going to
be able to go the distance. I just didn't think they could. That's
a mistake I made. It never even dawned on me not to punt. I
thought, with less than two minutes to go, we would be able to hold
them.''
</P>
<P>
   But quarterback Billy Cockerham led a winning drive that
included two long gains on pass plays. He, too, defended Paterno's
reasoning. ``Joe Paterno hasn't been in the game for as long as he
has, and been as successful as he has, without knowing what he is
doing,'' Cockerham said. ``We just made a couple big plays.'' &QL;

<P>
   GENEVA -- The Telecom99 exhibition and conference here last week
was supposed to be all about the future of telecommunications and
the ``mobile Internet.'' Instead, it sometimes felt like a trip
back to 1993, around the time the first Web browser, Mosaic, came
out of the University of Illinois and kicked off the Internet's
commercial stage.
</P>
<P>
   Billboards all around the Palexpo exhibition center claimed that
``Instant Internet Is Here Today,'' and hostesses showed off
cellular phones that could display e-mail or capture and send video
clips. Speakers elaborated on how new wireless technologies would
dramatically change the way we live, work and relate to each other.
Hundreds of news articles about the event depicted a future world
of unlimited communication possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   It was easy to get carried away. But product demonstrations and
discussions with exhibitors revealed a different reality: one of
slow connections, complex setup procedures, buggy and unstable
software and hardware, incompatible systems and few services --
much as in the early days of the commercial Web. The only
difference from 1993: wires are giving way to wireless systems.
</P>
<P>
   The talk of the exhibition was the Wireless Application Protocol
(WAP), a new standard enabling access to Internet-like information
through mobile phones and other wireless-capable devices like the
Palm. In short, the WAP specifications define both a set of
protocols and a markup language that allow information to be
transmitted over mobile phone networks and displayed on devices
running so-called microbrowser software.
</P>
<P>
   The system works in much the same way as the Web, with the
Wireless Markup Language (WML) serving roughly the same functions
as HTML. But WAP is not a way to access standard Internet and
intranet services. Web information needs to be converted into a
special format before it can be made available to mobile users.
</P>
<P>
   When a user wants to look up, say, a stock quote, he launches a
connection between his cellular phone and the WAP server, gets a
menu, chooses one entry, gets a dialogue screen, punches in the
ticker symbol, clicks to send it, and gets the quote. (To see an
example of how this works on a mobile phone screen, take a look at
Olsen and Associates' WAP currency converter.)
</P>
<P>
   The process is not complicated, and telecommunications companies
like Telia of Sweden, Swisscom of Switzerland and Finland's Sonera
are testing services like news updates, weather forecasts,
ticketing, city guides, banking and stock trading.
</P>
<P>
   Sonera, the largest provider of cell-phone service in Finland,
has developed a ``mobile portal'' called Zed, which allows users to
set up and manage their accounts and personal home pages through
the Web, then access them over the phone. Telia has created a
similar service with Oracle dubbed myDOF, where DOF stands for
``Department of Future.''
</P>
<P>
   However, while most manufacturers were featuring prototype WAP
phones at their Telecom99 booths, almost none are commercially
available to date -- prompting some to joke that WAP means ``Where
Are the Phones?''
</P>
<P>
   Configuring the phone requires a tedious and long process of
inputting setup information. Once this is done, it takes as long as
35 seconds to establish a connection to a WAP information server.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, these so-called WAP gateways are not always
compatible. Technology developed by Apion of Ireland, for example,
will work with phones from Nokia and Ericsson, but won't work with
Motorola's, which feature different microbrowser software developed
by Phone.com. Connections often fail, and data are occasionally
delivered scrambled.
</P>
<P>
   Even when it works, wireless information can be extremely
expensive: Sonera's tentative pricing model charges users the
equivalent of 20 cents to transfer money and about $1 for each
real-time stock quote, while fees for news and other services are
somewhere in between. And it is impossible to make a phone call
while using these services.
</P>
<P>
   For all the problems, however, WAP should not be underestimated.
If the recent history of the Internet has taught something, it is
that new technology offering a higher level of interactivity and
mobility will spread quickly despite initial technical complexity
and limitations.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the technical issues will be only temporary. Phone.com
has just announced that it is acquiring Apion, so the
interoperability question should be solved soon. Almost every new
cell phone sold next year will be WAP-enabled. Small peripherals
and accessories that snap on to the bottom of the phones already
allow users to listen to the radio or to play MP3 music files.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the difficulty of typing on small cell phone keyboards,
simple applications like text messaging have proven hugely
successful over the last year, most notably among teen-agers.
Companies like Ericsson (with iPulse) and America Online (with
Instant Messenger) are already trying to move more complex features
like buddy lists and instant chat into a wireless format.
</P>
<P>
   Later on, third-generation network technologies, set to be
rolled out by 2003, will speed up connections up to 2 megabits per
second, 200 times the current transmission rate over digital
cellular networks and 40 times the speed of a typical home computer
modem.
</P>
<P>
   At that stage, it is easy to predict that anything that can go
mobile will go mobile, and the humble cell phone will turn into a
multifaceted personal assistant, giving access to voice, messaging,
news, digital imaging, video, databases and corporate information,
electronic wallets, real-time automatic translation, data-heavy
encryption, personal ID information and electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   And Europe will be leading the mobile movement, overtaking the
United States in mobile commerce. About one European in three has a
cell phone, and it is expected that 60 percent will have one by
2003. The European wireless advantage stems essentially from its
adoption of the Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM)
standard, which is now deployed in over 100 countries, while the
American cell phone market remains fragmented among different
standards.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the industry has many challenges ahead, most notably
developing trust and ensuring reliability. ``Nothing of this will
happen until the user can feel good with his phone,'' said Jorma
Ollila, chief executive of Finland's Nokia. ``We will become quite
dependent on mobile phones in our daily lives, and we don't want to
run into a situation to say, 'Sorry, my wallet ran out of
batteries,' or 'My passport has no network coverage.'''

PRODUCT REVIEWS FROM ANYONE WITH AN OPINION
</HEADLINE>
  By BOB TEDESCHI 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)
<TEXT>
<P>
   (To purchase this ``separate buy'' article from the New York
Times Syndicate please contact syndicate sales representative DEBRA

</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, advice on consumer purchasing decisions has been
the province of print publications like Consumer Reports, PC
Magazine or Car and Driver. While many of these publications have
moved their content online, the growth of the Web has empowered
another source of buying advice: the neighbor, cousin or uncle who
just bought a particular item and is more than willing to share an
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Internet retailers and some publishers have already capitalized
on this instinct by allowing users to post opinions about products
the companies sell or review. But a handful of companies are hoping
to take the age-old effectiveness of word-of-mouth recommendations
one step further, by creating independent Web sites that give
common folks and bona fide experts a forum for their opinions and
users a way to rate the pundits. While some of these sites are
charging users for qualified help, most are looking for more
creative ways to balance their books and keep users coming to the
site.
</P>
<P>
   The company that has generated the most recent buzz around this
idea is Epinions, which was started in the summer by several
well-known Silicon Valley venture capitalists. It is not the first
company to provide users with opinions on what to buy, but it has
been a force behind some changes in how these sites approach their
business.
</P>
<P>
   The cornerstone of the Epinions service, for instance, is that
it both rewards and rates product reviewers, in hopes of giving
them enough incentive to provide useful opinions. Anyone can sign
up to give advice on products that fit into the site's 12
categories, and prospective shoppers can browse through the reviews
and rate them on a scale from ``not useful'' to ``very useful.'' To
build credibility -- and eliminate suspicions that they are merely
company shills in disguise -- advisers can build a page on the site
with photos and personal information.
</P>
<P>
   The payoff is aimed at both the reviewer's wallet and ego.
Reviewers earn royalties of from one to three dollars for every 10
times their review is read by an Epinions member, and their picture
might be featured on the front page of the site if their reviews
are widely read.
</P>
<P>
   According to Nirav Tolia, a company co-founder, the site relies
on a so-called ``web of trust'' in which users, reviewers and
advisers tend over time to be matched up with people whose opinions
they have come to trust. ``It mimics the way word-of-mouth works in
the real world,'' Tolia said.
</P>
<P>
   When word-of-mouth recommendations result in a sale, Epinions
earns an undisclosed referral fee from merchants who pay to have
links displayed in areas where their product categories are
discussed. Epinions also earns money by displaying banner
advertisements on its pages, and can charge higher advertising
rates than general information sites -- between $30 and $70 for
every thousand banner ads displayed -- since advertisers know they
are reaching buyers more qualified than the general surfing public.
</P>
<P>
   Tolia said the company also earned money by licensing its
service to other e-commerce sites like Lycos, which included the
Epinions service in the new Lycoshop. ``It's hard to find people
who've actually walked the same path you're walking when you're
looking for a product,'' said Jeff Bennett, vice president for
e-commerce at Lycos. ``Epinions is very good when it comes to
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Other sites, like Productopia.com and Deja.com, have offered
recommendations from users for months, building expansive archives
of reviews across hundreds of categories of goods. But those sites
do not compensate contributors for their opinions -- at least not
yet.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Phillips, Deja.com's chief executive, said the company
planned to use both a rating and a reward system for reviewers in
the near future. The reward system ``could involve ego
gratification,'' he said, rather than financial incentives.
``There's a way to do both successfully.''
</P>
<P>
   Roger Neal, Productopia's chief executive, said his company had
no plans to compensate consumers who post reviews, since it already
pays professional product reviewers to post recommendations on its
site. ``We'd rather have people doing it for the normal reasons
they post on message boards,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One question about the business model of these sites is whether
the quality of the user reviews is enough to attract a lot of
visitors on an ongoing basis. Phillips, of Deja.com, acknowledged
that the responses can be mixed, but said the current quality of
reviews on his site ``is pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You certainly get some three-word reviews that are insipid,''
he said, ``but anyone who's put any effort into it usually has
something worthwhile to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Another issue is objectivity. These sites purport to be more
objective than retailers that offer user opinions. But some
question whether sites that accept commissions, referral fees or
advertising can deliver worthwhile information, even if it is
provided by individuals with no vested interest in the products.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since these sites derive revenue from transactions that result
from people responding to an opinion, it ultimately raises a
question of bias,'' said Andrew Bartels, an e-commerce analyst with
Giga Information Group, a consulting firm. Unscrupulous sites could
prominently display reviews that favor certain products, for
instance, and gain higher transaction fees for those products. ``It
could be that the only way to get true, unbiased opinions is for
users to pay for it,'' Bartels said.
</P>
<P>
   But Phillips, of Deja.com, disagrees. ``I don't buy that
argument,'' he said. ``We have no incentive to do anything except
try to make this valuable for consumers. The primary relationships
we have are with marketers who sell all of the products across a
category, so we don't do any better on one product versus
another.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one company is betting that consumers are willing to
pay for advice, although the services offered generally do not
focus on purchase decisions. Exp.com, introduced last month,
enables consumers to buy advice and services on topics ranging from
career planning and tax shelters to what type of roses to plant.
According to Mark Benning, the company's president, the site allows
users to rate the performance of its advisers, and takes a 20
percent cut of whatever the advisers charge.
</P>
<P>
   The service is unusual in that users contact the expert with a
specific question or request, and negotiate a fee before the advice
is given. ``So they get a much more personalized response,''
Benning said.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen, however, whether the arrangement will pay
off for those who offer their services for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Walworth, for instance, is a horticulture consultant and
columnist in Idaho who joined Exp.com in the late summer. She said
demand has been light, even though she often charges as little as
$5 for a short consultation -- and sometimes gives flower-buying
advice for free. ``Let's be real here: At that rate, I'm not going
to Europe any time soon,'' she said. ``But I got into this business
to help people.''
</P>
<P>
   Exp.com's motives, on the other hand, are decidedly more
profit-minded. Benning said he was optimistic that the company
could operate in the black, given what he has seen so far. ``We've
done thousands of transactions in just a month,'' he said. ``We're
pretty pleased with that.''

IN A MUST-WIN GAME, JETS COME BACK TO BEAT CARDS, 12-7
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Despite Curtis Martin's rushing, the
defense's domination and the special teams' big play, the New York
Jets' offense looked beaten and incompetent as it trudged deep into
the fourth quarter Sunday, desperately seeking to end the first
half of their season with a victory over the Arizona Cardinals. If
not, Monday's second-guessers, and perhaps the Jets themselves,
would be conjuring memories of a 1-15 record of another era.
</P>
<P>
   The boos, the tens of thousands of empty seats at Giants
Stadium, the impatience _ all were reminiscent of the pre-Bill
Parcells period.
</P>
<P>
   And then, suddenly, it happened: Down by 7-6, Jets quarterback
Rick Mirer, facing a third-and-12, looked right for Dedric Ward,
saw him covered, and then spotted the ubiquitous Keyshawn Johnson
in the middle of the field.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly the entire game, Johnson had been blanketed by the
Cardinals' Pro Bowl cornerback, Aeneas Williams. Mirer and Johnson
had hooked up only once, and once Mirer had failed to see a
wide-open Johnson waving his hands in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   This time, there was no Williams. He was near the sideline in
zone coverage. And this time Mirer not only saw Johnson in the
middle of the field, but also converted a clutch throw. He
connected with Johnson at the Cardinals' 25, and Johnson took it
the rest of the way to complete a 43-yard touchdown play. As is
Johnson's wont, he added some drama to the winning score when he
was tackled at the 1 and just made it over the goal line. The
missed two-point conversion made the final score 12-7.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' Parcells, the Jets' coach, said later, ``nothing's
easy around here, as you can tell.''
</P>
<P>
   No, but there were some encouraging developments. The Jets did
end the first half of the season 2-6. They also made a
fourth-quarter comeback, reversing a disturbing trend that had seen
them blow four fourth-quarter leads this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``A fresh start,'' special teamer Chris Hayes said at game's
end. He had made a spectacular play, for the third straight game,
as he tackled punt returner Mac Cody at the 6-yard line to pin the
Cardinals back in the final period.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no uproar, no fight songs in the New York locker
room. This was not a division opponent, or even a good team. The
rest of the Jets' schedule is daunting. The Cardinals are also 2-6,
but led for most of the game because a pair of former New Yorkers _
Dave Brown, the ex-Giant, and Rob Moore, the ex-Jet, converted on
the longest pass play of their careers, 71 yards, to set up a
second-quarter touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   And that was just about all the offensive punch for the
Cardinals, who have not started the same offensive line two
straight games, and who went to Brown at quarterback after Jake
Plummer was sidelined two games ago with a broken finger.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets' defense held their former, popular teammate, Adrian
Murrell to 10 yards on seven carries.
</P>
<P>
   While Murrell was running backward, and even fumbling once,
Martin generated 133 yards on 38 carries, the most times he has run
the ball in a four-quarter game.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, when it came to keeping the drives going, the Jets faltered
repeatedly. They barely converted 30 percent of the time on third
down, and in one stretch were unsuccessful on five straight
third-down opportunities. Luckily for the offense, the Cardinals
were worse _ in large part because of the Jets defense. That
defense stopped the Cards 10 of 12 times on third down.
</P>
<P>
   Mirer, who was nominated by Parcells to start the Jets' next
game, at New England on Monday night, didn't want to talk much
about the weather. Still, he conceded that winds, which reached 23
mph, had affected the passing game.
</P>
<P>
   And Mirer allowed himself a smile _ something he hasn't been
able to wear too often in this topsy-turvy season _ as he
considered how Johnson got open for the pivotal play of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't you ask him?'' Mirer said. ``He's always open.'' Or
so Johnson says.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells seemed willing to blame the wind for much of the
offense's headaches Sunday. He sounded exasperated, though, when
asked about Mirer's repeated decisions to run on third down instead
of pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were several balls he didn't throw you wish he'd
thrown,'' Parcells said. ``These are passes we've thrown for 10
years and when you don't get them you kind of wonder why he's
pulling the ball down.''
</P>
<P>
   All the Jets got out of the opening half was a 44-yard field
goal by John Hall. That wasn't enough to offset a 4-yard touchdown
run by Michael Pittman that followed the long Brown-to-Moore
connection.
</P>
<P>
   This marked the third time in Mirer's six starts that he has
been unable to direct a touchdown drive before halftime. But the
Jets crept to within a point on Hall's 33-yard field goal in the
third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their problems, the Jets had been blessed with good
field position throughout the game. In fact, they started seven
drives in Arizona territory, thanks in part to the short kicks into
the wind by Arizona punter Scott Player.
</P>
<P>
   Martin was the Jets' primary star on offense, but his repeated
running failed to produce points. Then came the almost-desperate
third-down completion to Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was open on that play a couple of times earlier, and we
didn't hit for one reason or another,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   And the coverage?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what coverage it was,'' he said. ``I only know it
was a touchdown.'' &QL;

PRODUCT REVIEWS FROM ANYONE WITH AN OPINION
</HEADLINE>
  By BOB TEDESCHI 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)
<TEXT>
<P>
   (To purchase this ``separate buy'' article from the New York
Times Syndicate please contact syndicate sales representative DEBRA
WEYDERT at 732-390-4480)
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, advice on consumer purchasing decisions has been
the province of print publications like Consumer Reports, PC
Magazine or Car and Driver. While many of these publications have
moved their content online, the growth of the Web has empowered
another source of buying advice: the neighbor, cousin or uncle who
just bought a particular item and is more than willing to share an
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Internet retailers and some publishers have already capitalized
on this instinct by allowing users to post opinions about products
the companies sell or review. But a handful of companies are hoping
to take the age-old effectiveness of word-of-mouth recommendations
one step further, by creating independent Web sites that give
common folks and bona fide experts a forum for their opinions and
users a way to rate the pundits. While some of these sites are
charging users for qualified help, most are looking for more
creative ways to balance their books and keep users coming to the
site.
</P>
<P>
   The company that has generated the most recent buzz around this
idea is Epinions, which was started in the summer by several
well-known Silicon Valley venture capitalists. It is not the first
company to provide users with opinions on what to buy, but it has
been a force behind some changes in how these sites approach their
business.
</P>
<P>
   The cornerstone of the Epinions service, for instance, is that
it both rewards and rates product reviewers, in hopes of giving
them enough incentive to provide useful opinions. Anyone can sign
up to give advice on products that fit into the site's 12
categories, and prospective shoppers can browse through the reviews
and rate them on a scale from ``not useful'' to ``very useful.'' To
build credibility -- and eliminate suspicions that they are merely
company shills in disguise -- advisers can build a page on the site
with photos and personal information.
</P>
<P>
   The payoff is aimed at both the reviewer's wallet and ego.
Reviewers earn royalties of from one to three dollars for every 10
times their review is read by an Epinions member, and their picture
might be featured on the front page of the site if their reviews
are widely read.
</P>
<P>
   According to Nirav Tolia, a company co-founder, the site relies
on a so-called ``web of trust'' in which users, reviewers and
advisers tend over time to be matched up with people whose opinions
they have come to trust. ``It mimics the way word-of-mouth works in
the real world,'' Tolia said.
</P>
<P>
   When word-of-mouth recommendations result in a sale, Epinions
earns an undisclosed referral fee from merchants who pay to have
links displayed in areas where their product categories are
discussed. Epinions also earns money by displaying banner
advertisements on its pages, and can charge higher advertising
rates than general information sites -- between $30 and $70 for
every thousand banner ads displayed -- since advertisers know they
are reaching buyers more qualified than the general surfing public.
</P>
<P>
   Tolia said the company also earned money by licensing its
service to other e-commerce sites like Lycos, which included the
Epinions service in the new Lycoshop. ``It's hard to find people
who've actually walked the same path you're walking when you're
looking for a product,'' said Jeff Bennett, vice president for
e-commerce at Lycos. ``Epinions is very good when it comes to
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Other sites, like Productopia.com and Deja.com, have offered
recommendations from users for months, building expansive archives
of reviews across hundreds of categories of goods. But those sites
do not compensate contributors for their opinions -- at least not
yet.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Phillips, Deja.com's chief executive, said the company
planned to use both a rating and a reward system for reviewers in
the near future. The reward system ``could involve ego
gratification,'' he said, rather than financial incentives.
``There's a way to do both successfully.''
</P>
<P>
   Roger Neal, Productopia's chief executive, said his company had
no plans to compensate consumers who post reviews, since it already
pays professional product reviewers to post recommendations on its
site. ``We'd rather have people doing it for the normal reasons
they post on message boards,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One question about the business model of these sites is whether
the quality of the user reviews is enough to attract a lot of
visitors on an ongoing basis. Phillips, of Deja.com, acknowledged
that the responses can be mixed, but said the current quality of
reviews on his site ``is pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You certainly get some three-word reviews that are insipid,''
he said, ``but anyone who's put any effort into it usually has
something worthwhile to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Another issue is objectivity. These sites purport to be more
objective than retailers that offer user opinions. But some
question whether sites that accept commissions, referral fees or
advertising can deliver worthwhile information, even if it is
provided by individuals with no vested interest in the products.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since these sites derive revenue from transactions that result
from people responding to an opinion, it ultimately raises a
question of bias,'' said Andrew Bartels, an e-commerce analyst with
Giga Information Group, a consulting firm. Unscrupulous sites could
prominently display reviews that favor certain products, for
instance, and gain higher transaction fees for those products. ``It
could be that the only way to get true, unbiased opinions is for
users to pay for it,'' Bartels said.
</P>
<P>
   But Phillips, of Deja.com, disagrees. ``I don't buy that
argument,'' he said. ``We have no incentive to do anything except
try to make this valuable for consumers. The primary relationships
we have are with marketers who sell all of the products across a
category, so we don't do any better on one product versus
another.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one company is betting that consumers are willing to
pay for advice, although the services offered generally do not
focus on purchase decisions. Exp.com, introduced last month,
enables consumers to buy advice and services on topics ranging from
career planning and tax shelters to what type of roses to plant.
According to Mark Benning, the company's president, the site allows
users to rate the performance of its advisers, and takes a 20
percent cut of whatever the advisers charge.
</P>
<P>
   The service is unusual in that users contact the expert with a
specific question or request, and negotiate a fee before the advice
is given. ``So they get a much more personalized response,''
Benning said.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen, however, whether the arrangement will pay
off for those who offer their services for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Walworth, for instance, is a horticulture consultant and
columnist in Idaho who joined Exp.com in the late summer. She said
demand has been light, even though she often charges as little as
$5 for a short consultation -- and sometimes gives flower-buying
advice for free. ``Let's be real here: At that rate, I'm not going
to Europe any time soon,'' she said. ``But I got into this business
to help people.''
</P>
<P>
   Exp.com's motives, on the other hand, are decidedly more
profit-minded. Benning said he was optimistic that the company
could operate in the black, given what he has seen so far. ``We've
done thousands of transactions in just a month,'' he said. ``We're
pretty pleased with that.''

HOW A FAMILY VISIT LED TO A 20-YEAR-OLD MURDER CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ANDY NEWMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Madeline Carmichael could not bear to look at her
granddaughter.
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Carmichael's 23-year-old son, Andre, visited her for
the first time since he was a child, she welcomed him to her
apartment in Brooklyn. But when he showed off his 3-year-old
daughter, Ms. Carmichael recoiled as if she had seen a ghost and
ordered him not to bring the girl around again, said Andre
Carmichael's wife, Bronzetta.
</P>
<P>
   The girl bore a strong resemblance to Andre's twin sister,
Latanisha, who disappeared 20 years ago, Bronzetta said she had
learned.
</P>
<P>
   So began the chain of events that led the police on Friday to
charge Madeline Carmichael with murder in Latanisha's death, after
they found the 3-year-old girl's mummified body wrapped in
newspaper and plastic and stuffed into a trunk in a closet in the
woman's home.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, a police detective went to a state prison near the
Canadian border to interview Madeline Carmichael's son Gregory, 37,
who is serving time for robbery, a law-enforcement official said.
Gregory was 17 and living at home at the time of Latanisha's death
in 1979, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Madeline Carmichael, 60, who the police said has a history of
child abuse and who gave two of her four children up to foster
care, was awaiting arraignment Sunday at Brookdale Hospital Medical
Center in Brooklyn, where she was taken after she fell ill as the
police arrested her.
</P>
<P>
   But officials and children's advocates were trying to determine
how Latanisha became the latest in the heartbreaking roll call of
children _ Lisa Steinberg, Elisa Izquierdo, Sabrina Green _ who
appear to have fallen through a hole in the city's child-welfare
safety net.
</P>
<P>
   To some critics of the child-welfare system, the wonder is that
cases like Latanisha's have not happened more often. In the late
1970s, the system was revealed to be in disarray, with shoddy
record keeping and caseworkers unable to keep pace with rapidly
increasing caseloads.
</P>
<P>
   Marcia Robinson Lowry, the executive director of Children's
Rights Inc., a national advocacy group, said that while the
child-welfare system is still bedeviled with problems, it has come
a long way in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The computer systems, as bad as they are now, were worse
then,'' Ms. Lowry said. ``The tracking was worse then, and the
follow-up just was not there.''
</P>
<P>
   If, as the police have said, Ms. Carmichael voluntarily
surrendered two of her children to foster care _ something
caseworkers often encouraged mothers to do to speed cases through
the system _ the authorities would have been inclined to leave her
alone, Ms. Lowry said.
</P>
<P>
   They might have asked Ms. Carmichael to account for Latanisha,
but the police said the woman usually told friends that the girl
had been sent to live with relatives in the South. If she had told
the authorities the same thing, Ms. Lowry said, the chances were
slim that anyone would have checked out her story. ``They couldn't
follow through then,'' Ms. Lowry said, ``so if she had said the
child was elsewhere, they would probably have just accepted that.''
</P>
<P>
   The city medical examiner has not yet determined the cause of
the child's death, the Brooklyn district attorney's office said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Sunday at the shelter in Harlem where she lives
with her family, Bronzetta Carmichael recounted in stunned tones
her husband's disturbing visit to his mother, which led to the
discovery of Latanisha's body.
</P>
<P>
   About a month ago, Bronzetta said, she began urging Andre to
seek ``closure'' with his mother, whom he had not seen since he was
placed in foster care in 1988, at age 11. When Andre made the trip
to Brooklyn, he took along his stepson and the couple's 3-year-old
daughter, Andrea, called Sweet-Sweet by her family.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Carmichael welcomed Andre and the boy, but seemed deeply
disturbed by the sight of Andrea, a shy girl with a button nose and
a shock of frizzy hair. Andre's suspicions were further aroused,
the police said, when he contacted an aunt who asked him if he had
also looked up his twin sister. He did remember having one, his
wife said.
</P>
<P>
   It was Andre Carmichael's older sister, Sabrina Carmichael, 29,
who told him that she believed that the twin was dead and possibly
still in their mother's apartment, the police said. Sabrina, who
was also sent into foster care as a child, said that Andre's
daughter looked just like Latanisha, Bronzetta said.
</P>
<P>
   Madeline Carmichael's discomfort with young children apparently
extended to Sabrina's children, too, said Johana Rivera, the
superintendent of Ms. Carmichael's apartment building.
</P>
<P>
   A reclusive woman who lived in a cramped flat filled with
parcels wrapped in cellophane and complained of hearing children's
voices crying in the night, Madeline sometimes allowed Sabrina, who
lives in the Bronx, to visit her, Ms. Rivera said. But when Sabrina
brought her children, Ms. Carmichael would not even open the door.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rivera also said Ms. Carmichael spoke of having another
daughter whom she had never named and who was so severely
``handicapped'' that Ms. Carmichael had had to put her in an
institution.
</P>
<P>
   Bronzetta Carmichael said she and her husband hoped that some
good might come of the discovery of Latanisha. ``Everything happens
for a reason,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Andrea, in a blue shirt and blue pants, stood quietly by her
mother's side, uncomprehending.

MAKING A FADED HOTEL RITZ-CARLTON'S FLAGSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By CHARLES V. BAGLI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The St. Moritz, the faded old dowager on Central Park
South, is the hotel that every tycoon wants but none has been able
to keep.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel's latest suitor is Christopher Jeffries of Millennium
Partners, who completed a deal on Saturday to buy the 69-year-old
hotel from Ian Schrager's hotel company, which had bought it only
18 months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel, whose once stylish interior became a place for
bargain-hunting tour groups as the carpets frayed, will get a full
makeover and become the 300-room flagship of the Ritz-Carlton
chain, Jeffries said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the deal, Millennium Partners and Schrager's
company will form a joint venture to convert the top 12 floors of
the 35-story building into 14 luxury condominiums, each offering a
panoramic view of Central Park and selling for more than $10
million. The hotel, at the Avenue of the Americas, now has 689
rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to position this as one of the great hotels in New
York,'' Jeffries said.
</P>
<P>
   But achieving that goal may not be easy. For nearly a decade,
the St. Moritz has been a white elephant that has alternately
attracted and repelled developers who relish the opportunity to get
in on the Central Park South boom, but face the potentially
daunting costs of renovating the property, which has long been
saddled with financing problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The location of the St. Moritz is such that it should be one
of the prime hotels in Manhattan,'' said Sean Hennessey, director
of the hospitality practice at PricewaterhouseCoopers, the
accounting firm. ``But every owner for the past decade has found it
a daunting challenge to come up with the necessary capital to
renovate it. The cost of the renovation argues strongly for a
residential component for at least part of the building.''

SPORTS COLUMN: HORSE OF THE YEAR WAITING TO BE CLAIMED 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   HALLANDALE, Fla. _ After all the upsets and long shots, the
dreams won and lost in the Breeders' Cup, who is the Horse of the
Year?
</P>
<P>
   Not Behrens, who needed only to win the Classic to reaffirm his
claim but instead ran seventh for his third straight defeat. He may
still be worth consideration, but he certainly did not clinch
anything in the Breeders' Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Not Cat Thief, who won the Classic. After all, he won only one
other race all year and ran in 10 that he did not win, including
the Kentucky Derby (third), the Preakness (seventh), the
Metropolitan Mile (sixth) and the Travers (seventh).
</P>
<P>
   Not Lemon Drop Kid, another smart 3-year-old, who ran sixth in
the Classic, five lengths in front of Behrens. Don't forget, he
finished ninth in the Kentucky Derby before winning the Belmont and
the Travers. But he also ran fifth in the Jockey Club Gold Cup
behind River Keen and Behrens, so he has raced out of the money in
his last two starts.
</P>
<P>
   Not even Silverbulletday, who won eight consecutive races
against fillies but could not finish better than seventh against
colts in the Belmont. She closed the year by losing to Beautiful
Pleasure in the Beldame at Belmont Park and again lost to Beautiful
Pleasure when she ran sixth in the Breeders' Cup Distaff on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   When she was winning the Kentucky Oaks, the Black-Eyed Susan and
the Alabama, all milestone races for a filly, Silverbulletday was
frequently named as one of those rare fillies who should be
considered for Horse of the Year. But now that she has stopped
beating fillies?
</P>
<P>
   So, you ask, who's left?
</P>
<P>
   For people who look to the Breeders' Cup every year for answers
to championship questions, there will be few guidelines this time.
Half of the eight races were won by long shots _ Soaring Softly and
Daylami were the only post-time betting favorites who won. Even Cat
Thief was a 19-1 long shot. One winner (Anees in the Juvenile) paid
$62.60 for a $2 bet. Another (Cash Run in the Juvenile Fillies)
rang down $67.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a vote for Horse of the Year,'' D. Wayne Lukas,
the trainer of Cat Thief and Cash Run, said Sunday. ``The Breeders'
Cup turned things upside down.''
</P>
<P>
   Only one horse who won a Breeders' Cup race probably makes the
short list of candidates for the sport's highest honor: Artax in
the Sprint. He was second choice by a fraction to Forestry in the
betting, and he gave a flying performance, challenging Enjoy the
Moment (who faded to last) before rocketing into the lead and
winning in 1:07 4/5, tying the Gulfstream Park track record for six
furlongs set 26 years ago by Mr. Prospector.
</P>
<P>
   This was his third victory in a row, his second track record in
a row and his third track record in six months. On May 2 at
Aqueduct, Artax broke the track record for seven furlongs set 31
years earlier by Dr. Fager. On Oct. 16 at Belmont Park, he cracked
the track record for six furlongs set 12 years ago by Groovy.
</P>
<P>
   He is owned by Ernie Paragallo and trained by Louis Albertrani,
who said, ``If he breaks cleanly from the gate, they can't beat
him.'' He did, and they didn't.
</P>
<P>
   In this dashing year at the races, Artax has won four of his 15
starts but has run in the money 10 times. But his speed may put him
in the rare position that Forego held in 1974, when he was both the
sprinter of the year and the Horse of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   And one horse who didn't run in the Breeders' Cup must be judged
in the voting for the Eclipse Award for Horse of the Year:
Charismatic, the former claimer who won the Kentucky Derby and the
Preakness for Lukas and ran third in the Belmont after breaking two
bones in his left foreleg.
</P>
<P>
   True, Charismatic's career ended prematurely, but consider what
he accomplished. After being put in a claiming race for $62,500 on
Feb. 11, and not being claimed, he raced two grinding months with
great success: on April 3 he was fourth in the Santa Anita Derby;
on April 18 he was first in the Lexington Stakes at Keeneland; on
May 1 he was first in the Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs at
31-1; on May 15, first in the Preakness at Pimlico, and on June 5,
third in the Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope,'' Lukas said, ``that Charismatic and Cat Thief
get consideration for 3-year-old champion. But I'm not sure that
anything in racing matches the demands placed on a young horse in
the Triple Crown.''
</P>
<P>
   William Clifton, the co-owner of Behrens, turned to James Bond
when he was saddling Behrens for the Classic, with Horse of the
Year waiting to be claimed, and said, ``We've got a putt to make on
18.''
</P>
<P>
   But golf is a humbling game. And so is horse racing.

AS NEW YORK CITY IMMIGRATION THRIVES, DIVERSITY BROADENS
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ New York City is ending the century as it began _
oxygenated by immigrants _ with the new arrivals coming from an
increasingly diverse set of nations and settling over a broader
swath of the city than ever before, according to a study by the
Department of City Planning to be released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   From 1990 through 1996, about 113,000 immigrants arrived in the
city each year, rivaling the numbers that flowed to the five
boroughs through Ellis Island from just a few countries in southern
and Eastern Europe at the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, not only do the newest New Yorkers come from
places spanning the globe, but since national and ethnic quotas
were eliminated in 1965, no one nationality or even ethnic group
has predominated.
</P>
<P>
   The results are evident in the city's many polyglot
neighborhoods, where products of a dozen different countries are
sold in stores on a single block, and in the city's schools, which
have had to accommodate children of 196 different nationalities
over the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The increasing diversity of the stream is characteristic of
New York's immigration and one of its strengths,'' said Joseph
Rose, the Planning Department director.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer variety and numbers of immigrants coming to New York
City have already begun to change its ethnic and racial balance, so
that no one group has an absolute majority.
</P>
<P>
   City planners now predict that by next year, the group that once
held a clear majority _ non-Hispanic whites _ will have declined to
35 percent of the total population. At the same time, the Hispanic
share of the population will be 29 percent, the non-Hispanic black
share will be 26 percent and Asians will make up 10 percent of the
population. In 1970, non-Hispanic whites accounted for 63 percent;
Hispanics, 16 percent; non-Hispanic blacks, 19 percent; and Asians,
2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Another result of the sustained flow of immigrants has been to
offset drops in the city's population caused by deaths and
migration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without immigration, we would have had net population
declines, and we would be like some of the older cities, like
Detroit, where they have had devastating population losses,'' said
Rae Rosen, senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York. But, she added, the steady flow of new immigrants has also
taxed some city resources like the already overcrowded school
system.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Planning Department report focuses on newly available data
about immigrants who settled in the city in 1995 and 1996. A more
detailed report, covering the period between 1990 and 1994, was
released three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   There were no significant shifts between the periods, although
immigration did increase slightly over the years and the relative
weight of some groups shifted. Caribbean and Latin American
immigration slowed, for example, while the numbers of Russians and
people from the former Soviet republics coming in each year surged.
</P>
<P>
   But taken together, the two reports document significant changes
in all five boroughs.
</P>
<P>
   Over the seven years, the greatest numbers of people came from
the Dominican Republic, the former Soviet Union and China.
</P>
<P>
   The fastest-growing groups, the report said, were from Ghana,
Nigeria, Bangladesh and Egypt. Those countries, among others,
benefited from the introduction of a visa lottery system that was
aimed at giving opportunities to people from a wider range of
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Although their numbers are still small _ only 5,000 immigrants
from Ghana arrived in the first seven years of the decade _ the
first arrivals from a country generally become the seeds of future
immigration as they bring family members to join them.
</P>
<P>
   Barely a neighborhood in the city has not felt the impact of
this decade's immigrants. Manhattan, for example, absorbed 14
percent of the new arrivals in the first seven years, most of them
from Israel, Japan, Canada and Brazil. And nearly 12,000
immigrants, chiefly from China, the former Soviet Union, the
Philippines and India, have settled on Staten Island, which has
attracted few new immigrants in the past.
</P>
<P>
   More than a third of all the immigrants during this period
settled in Brooklyn. Immigrants from former Soviet republics led
the way, accounting for one in three of the new Brooklyn residents,
but substantial numbers of Dominicans, Chinese, Jamaicans,
Guyanese, Poles and Haitians also came.
</P>
<P>
   The same trend emerged in Queens, which has long been a magnet
for immigrants. It received substantial numbers of every national
group, with the largest influx from the Dominican Republic, the
former Soviet Union and China.
</P>
<P>
   The tight housing market meant that immigrants sought housing
all over the city. Nearly one in three newly arrived Dominicans,
instead of concentrating in the traditional enclave in Washington
Heights in Manhattan, settled in Queens or Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, more than half of the new arrivals from China and
Taiwan moved into neighborhoods outside the city's three
Chinatowns.
</P>
<P>
   Where immigrants first settled, however, is not necessarily
where they have remained. The settlement patterns listed in the
city planning report were derived from information immigrants
provided to the Immigration and Naturalization Service at the time
they obtained permanent resident status. A more complete picture of
where immigrants come from, where they live and what they do will
be provided after the 2000 census.

EDITORIAL: THE TRUTH ACCORDING TO OTIS CHANDLER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Nov. 8:
</P>
<P>
   The startling letter that Otis Chandler wrote last week to the
staff of the newspaper run by his family for over a century may be
remembered as a striking moment in the effort to protect
journalistic integrity from the commercial pressures of a new age
in media economics.
</P>
<P>
   Before retiring as publisher of The Los Angeles Times in 1980,
Chandler turned an uneven, provincial daily into a newspaper with
ambitious news coverage and a national reputation for quality. But
it is also one of many American papers that have struggled in
ensuing years to maintain growth and profitability.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, stockholders in Chandler's family turned to a
former General Mills executive, Mark Willes, to improve the
company's economic status and boost its stock price. In his letter,
Chandler blamed Willes' philosophy of ``breaking down the
traditional editorial/business wall'' for leading to the paper's
current scandal _ a secret sharing of revenues with a professional
sports center that was the subject of a special magazine section.
</P>
<P>
   This thunder from the paper's most revered elder came as the
newsroom staff moved toward open revolt against Willes' approach of
having newsroom business managers help plan coverage that would
drive revenues. And it is that systemic approach, rather than the
paper's obvious mishandling of the Staples Center magazine section,
that holds the greater interest for other mainstream newspapers and
their readers.
</P>
<P>
   Under competitive pressure from broadcasting and the Internet,
all such newspapers have to find new ways of making money. But as
Chandler noted, Willes and his executives lacked newspaper
experience, and they plotted a radical and journalistically
dangerous course.
</P>
<P>
   After first decreeing an unrealistic goal of increasing
circulation by 500,000, they empowered the business side to reach
across the ``wall'' that protects news decisions from commercial
pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler characterized this as the novice mistake of
well-intentioned executives who ``have no newspaper experience at
any level.''
</P>
<P>
   His point about experience is important. Tension between the
business and editorial sides is part of life at any newspaper,
including this one. The challenge is to create ways of maintaining
journalistic quality and business viability, both of which are
essential to a thriving newspaper. That means communicating across
the wall without creating an adversary culture or disregarding the
values of either side.
</P>
<P>
   What the Staples Center controversy brought into the open at The
Los Angeles Times was not simply a conquest of business over the
newsroom. It was, more dangerously, a failure to understand the
contribution that an uncompromised newsroom makes to the business
strength of a newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Otis Chandler told his former colleagues that ``respect and
credibility for a newspaper is irreplaceable.'' He can hope to be
listened to at the paper he once led. He can be sure he will be
heeded in other newsrooms and circulation and sales offices
throughout the industry.

RELATIVES OF CRASH VICTIMS SAY GOODBYE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARCELLA BOMBARDIERI AND BRIAN MACQUARRIE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I. _ Kissing white roses that will be dropped Monday
into the remote waters where EgyptAir Flight 990 crashed last week,
relatives of the 217 victims of the disaster bid goodbye Sunday to
their loved ones at a multifaith memorial service held at Brenton
Point State Park.
</P>
<P>
   One woman repeatedly cried, ``My baby, my baby,'' and others
wailed and wept as they walked to the sea to kneel in prayer or
scatter flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Many intended to return to their homes across America and around
the world Sunday night and Monday, reconciled to the fact that
there will be no bodies to bury and no ready answers to unlock the
tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   As about 250 relatives mourned, the Navy prepared to double its
efforts to retrieve the critical black boxes hidden in the plane's
wreckage. A more powerful, more versatile underwater robot will
join forces with a drone that has made two dives to the ocean
bottom. Poor conditions prevented any recovery efforts Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps as powerful as the prayers and words of condolence
offered in several languages by religious leaders and Egyptian,
Canadian, and US officials at Sunday's service were the physical
symbols that took the place of normal funeral rites.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross is giving families, many desperate for any remnant
of the deceased, at least 100 bottles of sea water. Some scooped up
pebbles and sand on the beach to take home.
</P>
<P>
   White, the color of hope, dominated the service. The tent was
white. White carnations, daisies, and roses, set on a white
tablecloth, adorned the podium. Mourners faced the ocean, the sun's
glittering reflection on the water a bright reminder of nature's
awesome power dwarfing human life.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish, Muslim, and Christian spiritual leaders offered words of
comfort and healing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chain of love has lost a vital link,'' said Rabbi Marc S.
Jagolinzer, president of the Rhode Island Board of Rabbis. ``Yet
there is so much death cannot take . . .. Death cannot take from us
the love we knew. It is woven into the tapestry of our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the family members dropped flowers into a white wicker
basket that a military honor guard carried to a Coast Guard
helicopter. The helicopter hovered briefly by the shore before
departing. It will scatter the flowers at the crash site Monday,
weather permitting, and make a videotape for families.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Brokaw of Winchester, Mass., whose father perished in the
crash, sent two poems to Newport to be attached to the flowers
dropped at sea. The poems _ ``Nothing Golden Can Stay'' by Robert
Frost, and ``The Swan'' by Rainer Maria Rilke _ were chosen,
respectively, in memory of Richard Brokaw, 75, of Strafford, Vt.,
and his wife, Virginia Chaplin, 74, of Georgetown, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   The couple had been married for a year and were headed to Egypt
for a two-week educational tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were both so alive. They will remain that way for us. He
was a very happy man,'' Susan Brokaw said.
</P>
<P>
   Wanting to pay respects, a few Newport residents watched eight
buses take mourners from the Goat Island Doubletree Hotel to
Brenton Point. Some held hands over their hearts as the buses
passed; others lifted hats or simply stood and gazed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel desolate and you feel helpless and you think of these
people a lot,'' said Newport retiree Loretta Goldrick, who has been
praying for the families at Mass every morning. ``This is a very
celebratory city, where people come for weddings and parties. This
has been quite a departure. I think there's a terrible sense of
loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Dignitaries who attended the memorial included the Egyptian
ambassador to the United States, Nabil Al Fahmy; the deputy prime
minister of Canada, Herbert Gray; and the US transportation
secretary, Rodney Slater. President Clinton sent a letter of
condolence.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the recovery effort will receive reinforcements in
the form of a second underwater robot _ called Magnum _ that will
complement the Navy's Deep Drone, which previously had been used
alone in the harsh environment of the 270-foot-deep debris field.
</P>
<P>
   Magnum was scheduled to begin its 12-hour journey to the crash
site about midnight Sunday night on the stern of the Carolyn
Chouest, a civilian vessel leased by the Navy that can use a
special thruster to turn 360 degrees and remain fixed above the
crash site without anchoring.
</P>
<P>
   The two robots, conditions permitting, will be deployed Monday
afternoon to resume the search for the two black boxes of EgyptAir
990. The recovery effort was halted late Saturday night as winds
increased and the USS Grapple, the Navy's premier salvage ship,
starting to drag anchor in worsening seas and returned to Newport
for refueling. The Grapple was expected to rejoin the search effort
in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   James Hall, chairman of the National Transportation Safety
Board, said Sunday that the operation is too dangerous for divers,
who could spend only 25 minutes on a bottom strewn with potentially
entangling wreckage. He called the recovery operation one of the
most challenging that the NTSB has faced, similar in degree to the
difficulties encountered in the ValuJet crash in the Everglades in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a real daunting task ahead of us,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   The Deep Drone was deployed for about 9 1/2 hours Saturday.
Although the pinging emitted by transponders from the flight data
recorder and cockpit voice recorder were located once again, the
robot could not work its way through the wreckage to reach the
source of the sound, Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   If adding the second robot does not clear the obstacles, Hall
said, the Navy might begin hauling wreckage to the surface in hopes
that the black boxes will be retrieved with other debris. However,
he said, this tactic risks damaging the boxes, whose data are
expected to contain critical evidence about the cause of the crash.

33 WOUNDED IN ISRAEL ATTACK; PEACE NEGOTIATORS PUSH ON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT AND ALIZA MARCUS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NATANYA, Israel _ After a bombing wounded 33 people Sunday,
Israeli and Palestinian officials vowed not to let the attack
disrupt momentum in the peace process, and both sides agreed to go
ahead with talks Monday on the final and crucial aspects of the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli deputy minister of defense, Efraim Sneh, told Israel
Radio: ``The attack is another attempt by terrorist organizations
to derail the peace process. The government has no intention to
delay the ongoing process, which is a historical necessity.''
</P>
<P>
   Police said three pipe bombs had been left near a trash can
during the midmorning rush hour, at a busy intersection in this
coastal town north of Tel Aviv. A fourth pipe bomb was defused near
the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Four people were reportedly treated for moderate to serious
injuries, and 29 were treated for minor injuries, hospital
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of Palestinians were arrested, but all were released
before midnight. Police reinforced patrols on the border with the
West Bank, which runs less than 10 miles from the outskirts of
Netanya.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they were operating on the assumption that the
attack was the work of ``terrorists'' aimed at derailing the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
   There were no claims of responsibility as of Sunday night, but
on Saturday the military wing of the Islamic resistance movement
Hamas issued a written warning to media outlets that it would
resume violent attacks to counter Israel's continuing construction
of Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Sneh said, ``For some time we have been receiving warnings of
possible atacks designed solely to disrupt the peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   Ziad Abu Zayyad, a senior minister in the Palestinian Authority,
condemned the attack and told CNN, ``We are determined to fight
terror, and to isolate terrorists and marginalize them.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added that the peace process is in a precarious spot as
both sides try to renew the confidence in each other that will be
necessary for the further implementation of the ``Wye Two''
agreement. The first Wye River plan was agreed to at Wye
Plantation, Md., in the fall of 1998. Wye Two was signed by the two
sides this fall in Sharm el Sheikh, Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most significant attempts to invigorate the peace
process began last week in Oslo, where the 1993 peace plan got its
name and where the broad outlines of an agreement were hammered out
in secret talks.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Ehud Barak, Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat, and President Clinton all came together last week to
honor the slain Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who was
killed by a Jewish extremist opposed to the peace plan of which
Rabin was a principal architect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hear nice words from Mr. Barak, but we need to see more
actions,'' said Zayyad.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Barak is expected to continue with further Israeli
troop redeployments from the West Bank as spelled out in the Wye
Two agreement. And Palestinians and US officials are waiting to see
if he will live up to his promise to dismantle illegal settlements
in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Already, he extended the Sunday deadline by several days and the
Israeli media was reporting that several of the more militant
settlements, such as Maon, were digging in and would refuse the
attempts of Israeli soldiers to remove them.
</P>
<P>
   Top negotiators for the two sides are set to meet in Ramallah
Monday morning to set the agenda for talks on the so-called final
status issues, which include the final borders between Israel and
the Palestinian Authority, the status of Jerusalem, which both
sides claim as a capital, the return of Palestinian refugees, and
the fate of Jewish settlements that have been hastily erected and
fortified in the West Bank in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   One Palestinian commentator warned that Palestinians would judge
Barak's commitment to the peace process based on his approach not
just to these militant settlements, but to the other Jewish
settlements on occupied West Bank land.
</P>
<P>
   ``The settlements in the West Bank, that's the main issue for
Palestinians right now,'' said Ali Jarbawai, a political science
professor at Bir Zeit University on the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think many Palestinians appreciate the final status
talks. They are skeptical about them and have lost faith in the
process because of what they see around them, especially concerning
the settlements,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Movement forward in the process has not been easy, but it seems
now to be at a critical juncture. The scene at Sunday's bombing
showed just how high emotions are running in Israel now as the two
sides try to turn this corner.
</P>
<P>
   Angry Israelis shouting anti-Barak slogans clogged the street
after the explosions, jostling to get closer to the spot where the
pipe bombs exploded.
</P>
<P>
   Some shouted, ``Death to Arabs!''
</P>
<P>
   The bombs were left near a rubbish bin on the main street in
downtown Netanya, and the explosions carved a hole in the concrete
wall of a clothing shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly we heard explosions and saw a huge burst of smoke and
fire, and then things were flying through the air, people were
shouting and we were all terrified,'' said Aliza Yom-Tov, owner of
a lingerie shop located a few yards from where the bombs went off.
</P>
<P>
   ``After an attack like this the only thing to do is to stop
talks and not give them anything else,'' said Avraham Levy, a
50-year-old taxi driver who supports the opposition Likud party.
</P>
<P>
   But amid the carnage, some Netanya residents said the only
solution was to keep the peace process moving. A municipal official
who would not give his name attributed the bombings to Palestinian
frustration over a peace process that was slow and murky.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are attacks because there are no serious talks going on,
and the Palestinians don't know what they will get, and we don't
know what we are giving, and this opens the way for extremists,''
he said.

BLUE JAYS NEAR TRADE OF GREEN FOR MONDESI 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DANA POINT, Calif. _ The engine that the Texas Rangers stoked
last week with the trade of Juan Gonzalez roared into this tiny
resort town on the Pacific Ocean this past weekend and fired up a
contingency deal that has Shawn Green moving from Toronto to Los
Angeles for Raul Mondesi in a four-player swap. The completion of
the deal depends on the Dodgers' ability to negotiate a contract
with Green by midnight Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Like Gonzalez, who went to Detroit in a surprisingly early
trade, Green is a member of a glittering group of players who can
be free agents after next season and have made it virtually
impossible for their teams to sign them to extended contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a variation of free agency,'' one general manager said
Sunday on the first day of the annual general managers meetings.
``The players want to have free agency a year before they can
become free agents.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees jumped into Green's quasi-free agency, knowing what
an attraction he would be in New York as one of the game's best
young hitters and Jewish on top of it. They talked to the Blue
Jays, but Gord Ash, the Toronto general manager, said they offered
``too little,'' declining to identify the players because ``the
Yankees could get back in it.'' That could happen only if the
Dodgers fail to reach agreement with Green on a contract.
</P>
<P>
   Ash and Kevin Malone, the Dodgers' general manager, reached
agreement on players Friday, then sought permission from the
commissioner's office for the Dodgers to negotiate with Green and
his agent, Jeff Moorad.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a trade,'' Sandy Alderson, Major League Baseball's
executive vice president for baseball operations, said Sunday.
``There had to be a trade for permission to be granted.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the practice that has existed for years, the Dodgers were
given 72 hours to talk to Green and Moorad. The period began at
midnight Pacific time Friday and expires at midnight Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the Blue Jays were fined by the
commissioner's office for giving the Rangers and the Houston
Astros, who also were fined, permission to talk to Roger Clemens
and his agent after Clemens said he wanted to be traded. The Blue
Jays had not made a contingency deal with either team and had not
gone through the commissioner's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learn quickly,'' Ash said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays, who paid Green $4,575,000 in an expired two-year
contract, offered him $48 million on a five-year contract and were
prepared to go higher, but, Ash said, money was not the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told us he wanted to play in a major U.S. city with a large
Jewish population,'' Ash said. Toronto, it was mentioned, has a
large Jewish population. ``But it's not a major U.S. city,'' the
general manager said.
</P>
<P>
   Ash declined to talk about the trade. ``I prefer not to say
anything until we know where it's headed,'' he said. Malone also
declined to comment. ``I can't comment,'' he said, ``because any
comment could jeopardize the chances of completing a deal and I
don't want to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   An executive with one of the teams, however, confirmed that the
primary player who would go to the Blue Jays was Mondesi, like
Green an explosive hitter but unlike Green a discontented player.
The executive would not identify the other player who would go to
Toronto but said it was not Ismael Valdes, a 26-year-old member of
the Dodgers' starting pitching rotation, as had been rumored.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi's verbal eruptions with Malone and the Dodgers' manager,
Davey Johnson, made him a likely subject for a trade despite his
continued offensive production. The right fielder batted a
career-low .253, but achieved career highs with 99 runs batted in,
33 home runs and 36 stolen bases.
</P>
<P>
   Besides defusing a potentially inflammatory clubhouse, the
exchange would add the kind of left-handed power hitter the Dodgers
have sought for their primarily right-hand hitting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Green, who will celebrate his 27th birthday Wednesday, was among
the American League leaders in a host of offensive categories:
first in total bases (361), extra-base hits (87), doubles (45) and
the season's longest hitting streak (28 games); tied for second in
runs scored (134); fifth in slugging percentage (.588); tied for
fifth in home runs (42); tied for seventh in RBI (123), and tied
for ninth in hits (190).
</P>
<P>
   In trading Green and next Carlos Delgado, their slugging first
baseman, the Blue Jays said they wanted established players in
return, no prospects for them. Mondesi would certainly give them
that. They also do not have free-agency concerns with Mondesi
because he has two years left on a four-year, $36 million contract,
and the club holds two years of options after that.
</P>
<P>
   His salaries for the next two years are $9.5 million and $11
million, then $11 million and $13 million for the option years. The
four-year total of $44.5 million is less than the $48 million that
the Blue Jays offered Green. &QL;

MARATHON ENTRANTS RAN WITH COMPUTER CHIPS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For the first time, technology allowed friends,
relatives and anyone with computer access to learn how runners
fared in the New York City Marathon within about 15 minutes of
their crossing the finish line. The quick results were thanks to
the Internet, the Microsoft Network and a computer chip embedded in
a small yellow plastic disc that entrants wore on their sneakers.
</P>
<P>
   The ChampionChip, used in many international races, was part of
each entry kit. It transmitted a signal to a data cable under a mat
at both the starting line and the finish line. The cable then
transmitted the signals to Microsoft computer servers in Redmond,
Wash., which relayed them to computer terminals at the New York
Road Runners Club's trailers in Central Park, as well as to the
official marathon site on the Microsoft Network on the World Wide
Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got an entire team working on this,'' said Cindy Spodek
Dickey, a Microsoft marketing executive. ``We tested it up to the
last minute. It means this is the first time the world can access
runners' times almost right away.''
</P>
<P>
   The chips performed as promised, broadcasting precise run times
(the actual time from start to finish as opposed to the time from
when the gun was fired) of everyone in the pack. The chips also
broadcast split times for the elite runners at the 10K,
half-marathon and 20-mile marks. Indeed, by 3:45 p.m., the Web site
was already showing statistics for 18,000 entrants _ more than half
of those who had entered.
</P>
<P>
   For middle-of-the-pack athletes, the chip was especially useful
because the crowd at the starting line on the Verrazano Bridge is
so large that it takes up to 10 minutes for some to cross the
actual starting line. It was also important for runners who were
aiming for times to qualify for other races, such as the Boston
Marathon. The New York Road Runners Club planned to include the net
time as well as the gun time on every certificate sent to
finishers.

EDITORIAL: CLEAN AIR COUNTERATTACK 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Nov. 8:
</P>
<P>
   There were two important and potentially far-reaching victories
for clean air advocates last week.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the federal government announced legal action
aimed at forcing 32 coal-fired power plants in the Midwest and
South to install modern anti-pollution controls or risk severe
monetary damages.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, Gov. George Pataki of New York disclosed that he
would shortly impose new emissions standards on cars and some other
vehicles sold in New York in an effort to force the automobile
manufacturers to produce much cleaner cars on a faster timetable
than required by federal law.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few months ago, clean air advocates were on the run,
devastated by back-to-back rulings in the D.C. Court of Appeals in
response to lawsuits brought by the big utilities and a few
Midwestern states. The rulings invalidated new federal air-quality
standards and blocked a carefully negotiated plan that would have
forced 22 states east of the Mississippi to reduce emissions of the
chemicals that cause smog and acid rain.
</P>
<P>
   The rulings were particularly devastating for New York and other
Northeastern states that for years have suffered from air pollution
that blows eastward from dirty, coal-fired plants in the border
states and the Midwest. These plants are major sources not only of
urban smog and acid rain, but also of the gases that contribute to
global warming and mercury emissions that are lethal to fish and
wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, however, the eastern states, led by New York, have
counterattacked. In September, Eliot Spitzer, New York's attorney
general, threatened to sue 17 coal-fired plants in five Midwestern
and border states unless they reduced their emissions. The federal
actions announced Wednesday complement Spitzer's strategy while
doubling the number of plants on the target list.
</P>
<P>
   Both the federal and the state lawsuits are based on a largely
untested provision of the 1970 Clean Air Act. In general, the act
``grandfathered'' older coal-producing plants built before 1970,
exempting them from the law's strict pollution standards in the
mistaken expectation that they would be shut down in a few years.
But the law also specified that plants that were significantly
modernized to produce more energy had to comply with the same
pollution controls as new plants.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer and the federal government claim that the companies
named in their lawsuits deliberately ducked that obligation in
order to save money.
</P>
<P>
   If the suits succeed, the clean air benefits could occur within
a few years. Pataki's plan will take longer to show results, but
they could be huge. Under the new regulations, New York will adopt
California's emissions standards, which are tougher than the
federal government's and will require the industry to produce in 10
years cars that emit only half the pollution they do now.
</P>
<P>
   Since New York and California account for a huge share of the
national market, the super-clean New York-California car could
become the standard for the country.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, some environmentalists feared that the
Clinton administration and politicians with possible national
aspirations, like Pataki, would be reluctant to offend pivotal
Midwestern states and key industries with elections approaching.
Happily, these fears seem to have been unwarranted.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Edward Leitch, 72, traveled more than 5,000 miles
from Cairns, Australia, to New York City to run 26.2 miles Sunday
with his youngest son, Andrew, 38.
</P>
<P>
   Justin Rubenstein, 18, drove more than 200 miles from Worcester,
Mass., to go the distance with his grandfather, Harold Somer, 80,
and uncle, Robert, 37.
</P>
<P>
   There were 30,000 stories in the 30th New York City Marathon:
tales of running for redemption, running for glory, running just
for the sake of it. The Leitches' and Somers' stories are
uncomplicated yarns combining the love of family and sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the past two years, I listened to my grandfather and uncle
return home from running the marathon with these wonderful
stories,'' said Rubenstein, who was so enthralled by their colorful
vignettes that he decided to run this marathon as soon as he
reached the eligibility age of 18. ``It made me want to run. Not
just run, but to cross the finish line with two other
generations.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Leitch was the supportive son, standing along roadsides
in Australia, Boston, New York and Portland, Ore., watching his
father compete in what now amounts to 25 to 30 marathons. Andrew
Leitch moved to New York 10 years ago to pursue a career as a
musician but gave up that dream for a steady-paying job as creative
services director for T3, a multimedia company.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when he returned home for his mother's funeral, he
was struck by how fleeting life is and how many special moments
with her he had missed. He vowed not to lose similar opportunities
with his father, no matter how many miles apart they were.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when I decided to run the marathon with him,'' Leitch
recalled Saturday during a reception for runners from Australia and
New Zealand at the Australian Consulate at 158 West 42nd St. ``I
thought this would be something memorable I could do with my dad.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a touch of sweet irony to the Leitch and Somer stories.
In a sport dominated by youth, it is the younger generation that
has the rookies seeking advice from men two times their age, or in
the case of the Somer family, more than four times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him to take it slowly, go with the pace,'' Edward
Leitch said. ``If he feels good at six miles, then I told him he
could pick up the pace. Oh, I told him he probably wouldn't get a
good night's sleep the night before, because you're always a bit
restless the night before a marathon.''
</P>
<P>
   Harold Somer offered similar guidance to Justin, whose mother,
Linda, is one of three daughters and two sons in the family.
</P>
<P>
   ``No two bodies are the same,'' Somer advised his grandson over
a Saturday night premarathon family dinner of spaghetti and
meatballs and broiled chicken. ``He knows his body. As long as he
paces himself, he'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   The Leitches made plans to run side by side over the stretch of
five boroughs, while the Somers had no such expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping to do just under 3 hours 50 minutes,'' said Robert
Somer, a lawyer now in his 12th New York City Marathon. Rubenstein,
who understands that the triumph is in finishing, said that coming
in an hour behind his uncle would be fine. As for the patriarch of
the family? ``I told them not to wait for me. I'll be in the
five-hour range.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward Leitch, one of 135 runners from Australia and among 60
who made the trip just to run in the marathon, said his personal
best was 3 hours 19 minutes, which he achieved at the age of 60.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect to be in the four-hour-plus range,'' he said. Leitch,
a retired metallurgical chemist, began running in his 20s and
continued through the birth of his four sons, Campbell, Bruce,
Robert and Alex, the only nonrunner among them.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I've been doing a lot of cross-training,'' Alex Leitch
said. ``The only downside so far was that I got tennis elbow doing
weight training.''
</P>
<P>
   Now for the epilogues:
</P>
<P>
   Robert Somer decided to run with the Achilles Track Club,
helping three wheelchair athletes fight the wind gusts across the
Queensboro Bridge. This added more than an hour to his personal
best, and he finished in 5 hours 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Rubenstein ended up running the entire distance alongside his
grandfather, and they crossed the finish line together in 6 hours
49 minutes. Justin, a freshman at Colgate University, then headed
back to Massachusetts to make an 11:30 a.m. calculus class.
</P>
<P>
   Edward and Andrew Leitch crossed the finish line in 4:58. Edward
and his son Bruce planned to spend two more days in New York, then
fly to Chicago to see relatives there. They expect to return to
Australia on Friday. &QL;

BREEDERS' CUP JUVENILE A CURSE FOR THE DERBY 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALLANDALE, Fla. _ The colts and fillies had barely been sponged
off after the biggest race of their 2-year-old lives, and their
owners were already thinking about the first Saturday in May. In
the barn of the Breeders' Cup Juvenile winner Anees, trainer Alex
Hassinger already had Kentucky _ as in Derby _ on his mind.
</P>
<P>
   His colt needed to pass all 13 horses in the stretch to capture
the $1 million race after being bumped out of the gate by rival
Forest Camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got knocked pretty good. But what was impressive was
watching him in the last five-sixteenths of a mile when he passed
five horses and made up six lengths,'' said the trainer, who
saddled Juvenile fillies winner Eliza in 1992. ``He's a real
intelligent colt and I believe next year can be a big one for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a stirring victory for Hassinger's colt, but the
Breeders' Cup Juvenile hasn't meant much in the Triple Crown races
for 3-year-olds. Even if Anees grows without injury into a
3-year-old, continues to learn as he races, he still has history to
buck. No winners of the previous 15 Breeders' Cup Juveniles has
gone on to win the Kentucky Derby _ last year's winner, for
example, Answer Lively, finished 10th at Churchill Downs.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, New York-based Nick Zito compared the losing statistic
to the curse of the Bambino that befell the Red Sox which some New
Englanders still blame for the team's World Series futility. Zito
skipped the Juvenile and kept Champagne Stakes winner Greenwood
Lake in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many in the field will show up in the spring. Chief
Seattle looked like a winner until Anees rocketed by and trainer
John Kimmel said the improving colt will take the winter off. ``I
was very happy with the race,'' said Kimmel of the second-place
finisher.
</P>
<P>
   D. Wayne Lukas took the blame for High Yield's third-place
finish, but was clearly eyeing the spring classics. The colt came
four wide _ a la 1999 Derby winner Charismatic _ around the turn
but ran out of gas the last sixteenth of the mile. But Lukas says
High Yield is hearty enough to improve off heavy workouts in the
spring _ much like Charismatic did.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went to saddle him, he looked fat to me. He's going to
be a good 3-year-old because he's going to be able to take it,''
Lukas said of hard works. ``He'll dance the dances.''
</P>
<P>
   While Hassinger believes his colt made a case to be named
champion 2-year-old, the 31-1 shot perhaps left that title open for
the East Coast phenomenon More Than Ready. The Todd Pletcher
trained colt won 5 of 5 _ including four stakes _ before finishing
third in the Belmont Futurity and being walloped by more than 13
lengths in the Champagne. He, too, was turned out in Florida to
rest for a 3-year-old campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's pretty clear he is one of the best two years in
history,'' said Pletcher. ``It's up to others to decide where he
fits in the championship picture, but we're confident he is going
to be a 3-year-old to contend with.''

KINGS PICK UP PIECES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Kings had a lot to think about
Sunday after playing their worst game of the season the night
before. They had to ask themselves whether they were ready to move
on without injured stars Luc Robitaille and Jozef Stumpel.
</P>
<P>
   The players did very little skating at the team's Iceoplex
training facility. Instead, there were meetings with coach Andy
Murray addressing Saturday night's 5-3 meltdown against the
Philadelphia Flyers.
</P>
<P>
   Murray, who on Saturday refused to use the losses of Robitaille
and Stumpel as an excuse for the poor effort, said he understands
why the team came out so flat. But he vowed it would not carry over
to Tuesday night's game against Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today was a day of mourning around here,'' Murray said of his
team, which was outshot 26-9 in the first two periods. ``I think
before last night's game the team had come to grips with losing
Luc. But they didn't find out about Stumpy until almost an hour
before the game. Perhaps that was too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Stumpel had undergone an MRI on Thursday for a tender abdominal
area, but it wasn't until 5:50 p.m. Saturday that the club learned
he would undergo surgery today and could miss up to three months.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Jason Blake, who was slotted to take Robitaille's spot at
left wing, was moved to center after Stumpel was scratched.
</P>
<P>
   Blake was overwhelmed by the larger Philadelphia forwards and is
not expected to be back with the first line Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very long night for me,'' Blake said. ``It was good
to skate a little today, but I've spent a lot of time looking in
the mirror and wondering what I have to do to play better.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a good chance Blake will be replaced by center Len
Barrie, who was promoted Sunday from the club's minor-league
affiliate in Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we didn't know about Stumpy until so late in the day,
we didn't know we needed a center,'' Murray said. ``Even if we did,
it would have been a little hard to get him here since the Ice Dogs
were in Cincinnati.''
</P>
<P>
   But covering the logistics Sunday was not as difficult as
working on the mental part. Murray and his coaching staff met with
captain Rob Blake and alternate captain Garry Galley during the
afternoon. Also in the meeting was Robitaille, who is getting
around on a removable cast.
</P>
<P>
   `I told the veterans on the team that I need them to help us
move on from this,'' Murray said. ``As poorly as we played last
night, the game was still 2-2 after one period. We didn't even
start playing until the second.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't even talk about Edmonton. That will be addressed at
(today's) practice. I think when they hit the ice we'll be able to
see how much they have gotten over what happened Saturday.''

CHARLES SWEET, 81, WHO OVERSAW LABOR MURDER TRIALS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Pa., Maine)  (lb) 
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Judge Charles G. Sweet, who helped supervise the trials of
several of the nine people charged in the killing of the labor
leader Joseph Yablonski and his wife and daughter 30 years ago,
died on Oct. 31 at a nursing home in Tampa, Fla. He was 81.
</P>
<P>
   Sweet, who had been living for the last few years in a Tampa
retirement community, was president judge on the Common Pleas Court
in Washington County, Pa., from 1964 to 1984.
</P>
<P>
   From 1970 until 1974, he helped oversee long and complex
criminal proceedings that drew national attention to Washington
County and resulted in charges against nine people in the Yablonski
slayings.
</P>
<P>
   The Yablonskis were shot to death in their Clarksville, Pa.,
home on New Year's Eve, 1969. Three weeks earlier, Yablonski had
lost a bitter battle to unseat W.A. Boyle as president of the
United Mine Workers. Yablonski believed the election had been
rigged and may have been planning to help federal investigators in
an investigation of the election.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the nine people who were charged in the killings, Aubran
Martin and Paul Gilly, were convicted of first-degree murder in
trials that Sweet presided over in Washington County. Silous
Huddleston, Annette Gilly and Claude Veale confessed in the case,
and Albert Pass and William Prater were found guilty of murder in
Erie, Pa., after a change of venue.
</P>
<P>
   Sweet later granted probation to Huddleston and Ms. Gilly and
suspended their sentences because they had cooperated with the
prosecution. He also dropped murder charges against William
Turnblazer, a former United Mine Workers district president, who
testified against Boyle.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses at Boyle's 1974 trial in Media, Pa., and a retrial
there in 1977 said Boyle had transferred $20,000 in union money to
pay for the killing of Yablonski and any witnesses. Boyle died in
1984 while serving three consecutive life sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Sprague, a Philadelphia prosecutor who was appointed
special assistant to the U.S. attorney general and a special
prosecutor to Washington County for the Yablonski murders, said
Sweet was involved in the early trials and confessions, which led
to Boyle's conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the prosecutions in Washington County that built up a
foundation for the entire case,'' said Sprague, who is now in
private practice.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Greenleaf Sweet was born in Lewiston, Maine, on Aug. 5,
1918, and grew up in Western Pennsylvania. He graduated from
Pennsylvania State University and Harvard Law School.
</P>
<P>
   Sweet served in the Marine Corps in World War II, rising to the
rank of colonel.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Martha; a son, David, of Harrisburg;
a daughter, Barbara Sweet of Washington, D.C.; a stepdaughter,
Meredith Anthony-Light of New York; a stepson, Troy Breese of
Washington, Pa.; and three grandchildren.

 By JODY GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
MINNEAPOLIS _ The story this year in Minnesota hasn't been Randy
Moss.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has been quarterback Jeff George, who took over the reins
three weeks ago because Randall Cunningham wasn't getting it done.
It has been receiver Cris Carter, the beneficiary of Moss' double
teams, who has become the Vikings' leader in catches, receiving
yards and touchdowns. And it has been the ground game, where
often-injured Robert Smith has once again been plagued by health
problems.
</P>
<P>
   None of these, however, will be the story this evening when the
Vikings host the Cowboys on Monday Night Football. There's only one
theme, only one matchup that has NFL fans excited _ Moss meets
Deion Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be a lot of eyes on that matchup. I know I'll
be watching to see what happens,'' Cowboys safety George Teague
said. ``Mr. Moss is a great athlete and a great receiver, but we've
got a guy who can handle him, that's for sure. My money's on Prime
Time.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders watched from the sidelines last year, an injured toe
keeping him from this much-anticipated matchup. Moss stole the
spotlight, catching touchdown passes of 51, 56 and 56 yards before
a national Thanksgiving audience.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Moss declined interviews, insisting his on-field
performance should speak for itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have anything to say,'' Moss said about last year.
``What I said was on the field. What did I need to say? Deion
didn't play. Their questions were going to be, `What if Deion had
played?' The other question was going to be, `Did you have a point
to prove because Dallas didn't draft you?' Why stir up something
you already know the answer to?''
</P>
<P>
   This year has been tougher for Moss as defensive coordinators
have double- and triple-teamed him to keep him out of the end zone.
But even with only four touchdowns, Moss remains one of the most
exciting young players to come into the game. Sanders, of course,
remains one of the best to ever play his position, so the game
promises to have plenty of drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be curious to see how often they let Deion go one-on-one
with him,'' Vikings coach Dennis Green said.
</P>
<P>
   After his legal troubles in college, there were plenty of teams
that chose to pass on Moss _ 19, to be exact. Some of those teams
had bigger holes to fill. Some, like the Cowboys, could have used
Moss' talent but were afraid of the potential headache.
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't been one. In his first season, Moss proved to be a
solid pick off the field, staying completely out of trouble. On the
field, he was spectacular, becoming the only first-year player to
earn a spot in the 1999 Pro Bowl after setting an NFL rookie record
with 17 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it will be his performance tonight against Sanders that
will be the real benchmark, according to many NFL insiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that Randy has so much ability that just to see him
compete at a young age against the best is a treat,'' Minnesota
running back Leroy Hoard said. ``And to see how he handles it is
going to definitely determine where he makes his mark in this
league.''
</P>
<P>
   But as much attention as Moss and Sanders get, it could well be
some other key players who decide tonight's outcome. The Cowboys
(4-3) are coming off a 34-24 loss to the Colts, their third defeat
in four games. They have struggled offensively, particularly in
second halves this season, and have lost three of their four road
games thus far. Quarterback Troy Aikman will be trying to
re-establish the offense, which has plummeted to 17th in the league
with receiver Michael Irvin on the sidelines with a neck injury.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings (4-4), on the other hand, have put together
back-to-back wins for the first time this season after making the
switch from Cunningham to George. Carter caught eight passes for
144 yards and two touchdowns last weekend against Denver. Hoard
rushed for 105 yards and one touchdown on 17 carries in a victory
two weeks ago against San Francisco. Add receiver Jake Reed,
George's other weapon, and the Minnesota offense is ranked fifth
overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randy receives most of the attention, as he should,'' Sanders
said. ``But when you're talking about the Minnesota Vikings, you're
talking about a trio of receivers that are great. After watching
the highlights, Cris Carter is a big-time player. You can't just
emphasize one man.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't tell that to Moss, who knows that to be a superstar, he
has to be able to compete with the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a good chance for me to go against the best and
for Deion to go against the best,'' Moss said.

PEPI DEUTSCH, 101, HOLOCAUST SURVIVOR WITH REMARKABLE TALE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JOSEPH BERGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pepi Deutsch, a resilient, resourceful woman whose endurance of
the brutalities of the Nazis with her teen-age daughter at her side
was one of the most affecting stories of survival to emerge from
the Holocaust, died on Nov. 5 at Lawrence Hospital in Bronxville,
N.Y. She was 101 years old and lived at her daughter's home in
Scarsdale, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter, Clara Knopfler, said her mother, who had been one
of the world's oldest living Holocaust survivors, died from bladder
cancer that was diagnosed in July.
</P>
<P>
   Few mothers and daughters were able to survive the concentration
camps together. Either a mother was too old for work or a daughter
too young, and one or the other was sent to the gas chambers. Even
when they stayed together, relations frayed under the pressures of
starvation.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in these circumstances argued over a slice of bread or
a spoon of soup,'' Mrs. Knopfler, 72, said in an interview shortly
before she and her mother were honored in 1998 by the Westchester
Holocaust Commission. ``My mother and I never argued. She didn't
eat her soup, and gave it to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Deutsch and her daughter managed to stay together through a
makeshift Hungarian ghetto, deportation, Auschwitz-Birkenau and
bone-wearying work at three other slave encampments. But Mrs.
Deutsch's 19-year-old son, Zoltan, died in Auschwitz, shot to death
in front of her husband, Joseph. Later, Joseph perished in a death
march. In all, 37 of her relatives died, including her mother and
four brothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just I am and Clara,'' she said of the survivors.
</P>
<P>
   But that Clara survived told much about the sacrifices her
mother was willing to make. In January 1945, after the two women
weathered months of hunger, cold, lice and savagery from their
guards, Mrs. Deutsch made sure that Clara got to celebrate her 17th
birthday. She hoarded three slices of bread, coated them with
marmalade and produced a birthday cake.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter repaid her on other occasions, once shaming a young
Nazi guard into an apology of sorts after he struck Mrs. Deutsch
across the shoulders. Clara simply reminded him to think of his own
mother.
</P>
<P>
   The habits of caring for each other were so hardened in the
caldron of the war that when it ended, the two women remained
companions for five decades, through Communist Romania, immigration
to the United States in 1962 and building a new life here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could never separate from my mother or she from me,'' said
Mrs. Knopfler. ``I felt in the concentration camps, if we are
separated, we will never be together again.''
</P>
<P>
   Into her 100th year, Mrs. Deutsch pushed her square-shouldered
body through the Scarsdale house, did her own cooking _ she kept
kosher when her daughter did not _ and read a Hungarian newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Until the war, Mrs. Deutsch, who was born on June 30, 1898,
lived a comfortable life in a Transylvanian village that shifted
between Hungarian and Romanian control. Her husband owned a shoe
factory.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1944, the Germans took control of Hungary and herded Mrs.
Deutsch, her family and 10,000 other Jews onto the grounds of a
brick factory. From there, they were taken by cattle cars to
Auschwitz-Birkenau. The notorious Dr. Josef Mengele assigned the
youthful-looking Mrs. Deutsch, then in her 40's, to a work group of
younger women that included Clara. A group of women closer to Mrs.
Deutsch's age were gassed.
</P>
<P>
   The two women were soon shipped to a Latvian factory where old
batteries were recycled into gunpowder. They survived there on a
daily ration of three slices of bread and a soup of potato peels.
Transferred to eastern Prussia, they dug anti-tank trenches. Mrs.
Deutsch used her brief rest periods to wash Clara's only dress in a
river.
</P>
<P>
   With the approach of the Russian army, the Germans abandoned
their slaves, and Mrs. Deutsch again saved her daughter. When a
drunken Russian soldier was about to rape Clara, Mrs. Deutsch sat
on her daughter's lap until a Ukrainian pulled the soldier off.
</P>
<P>
   Through all the miseries, Mrs. Deutsch kept her faith, refusing
to eat rations of lard and fasting on Yom Kippur.
</P>
<P>
   Of the slaughter of six million Jews in the Holocaust, she said,
her daughter translating: ``This was not God's fault. This was done
by monsters.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Mrs. Knopfler, Mrs Deutsch is survived by a
grandson and two great-grandchildren.

KEARIN WANTS TO END BLAME GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ It starts at the top, Jeff Kearin said later,
taking responsibility for the remarkable lack of self-control the
Cal State Northridge football team showed Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I'm taking some bullets for the team,'' said Kearin,
CSUN's interim head coach whose explosive display of anger toward
the officials dulled the Matadors' momentum in the first quarter of
their 34-21 loss to host Portland State. ``I lost my composure
early with the officials. I lost my composure and all of a sudden
we're turning the ball over.''
</P>
<P>
   Kearin is right. His sideline tantrum, which drew a 15-yard
unsportsmanlike penalty, came in the moments after the Matadors
tied the game at 14. Kearin's antics obviously weren't
inspirational; CSUN didn't score again until late in the fourth
quarter, after the Vikings built a 34-14 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But Kearin is taking too much blame. It was a team effort in the
art of self-destructiveness _ especially when it came to blaming
the Big Sky Conference officials.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone associated with CSUN football _ the coaches, the
players and even some trainers _ didn't like the Matadors' penalty
total of 15. After the game, they made it sound like there were
twice as many penalties than that called against them.
</P>
<P>
   Look, any close observer of CSUN's seven Big Sky Conference
games this season notices the officials' tendency to drop the flag
on the Matadors, even for the most minor infractions. But the
football program needs to shed its ``us-against-the-conference''
mentality. It's a faulty mantra, and this Kearin knows.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're so predictable in that regard,'' he said after the game.
``It's got to stop with me as much as anybody. It's a culture we've
had here for a long, long time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors also seemed genuinely surprised and intimidated by
Portland State's physical aggressiveness, even though the Vikings
were fired up earlier in the week by CSUN cornerback Chazz Moore's
public prediction of a Matadors' upset.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, a Portland resident, said he endured emotional and
physical abuse from the Vikings, which he expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``All day long,'' is how Moore described the jeering. ``I
couldn't take a breath without hearing something.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time, Moore kept his cool. But his teammates seemed
genuinely surprised and intimidated by the Vikings' tactics. Most
of the Vikings are from large cities; they understood how to get
under the Matadors' skins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their demeanor is a lot like ours,'' Kearin said. ``Their
style of play is a lot like ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's loss left CSUN (5-4, 4-3) out of the race for the Big
Sky title and a shot at the Division I-AA playoffs. Now, the goal
with two games left should be a winning season.
</P>
<P>
   If the CSUN players think they weren't done any favors by the
Big Sky officials Saturday, they better think about what might
happen this week when they play at Southern Methodist University in
the Mustangs' last home game in the Cotton Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of talking on the field,'' is how CSUN
quarterback Marcus Brady described the game against Portland State.
``That's no excuse for us getting some stupid penalties.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
REPORT CARD &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
GAME: 9 &QL; 
RESULT: Portland State 34, CSUN 21 &QL; 
RECORD: 5-4, 4-3 &QL; 
THIS WEEK'S GPA: 2.33 &QL; 
CUMULATIVE GPA: 2.67 &QL; 
NEXT GAME: At Southern Methodist &QL; 
QUARTERBACKS &QL; 
Playing with a sore left ankle, Marcus Brady threw 2 INTs, one of
which was returned for a TD. He completed less than 50 percent of
his passes for the second time this season and didn't play in the
Matadors' final offensive series. &QL; 
C+ &QL; 
RUNNING BACKS &QL; 
A rare fumble for Jaumal Bradley came on his last carry of the
game; it was recovered by a teammate. Bradley had 85 of the
Matadors' 89 yards. It was CSUN's second-lowest rushing total of
season. &QL; 
C+ &QL; 
WIDE RECEIVERS &QL; 
Where there used to be sure hands, everyone in this unit is now
dropping passes, including Aaron Arnold. Arnold's drop of a long
pass in the end zone could have given CSUN a second-quarter lead.
Only two catches for Drew Amerson. &QL; 
C+ &QL; 
OFFENSIVE LINE &QL; 
Awesome on the Matadors' first drive, which featured 31 rushing
yards and a 3-yard TD by Bradley. CSUN later abandoned the run when
it was trailing. Protected Brady well. &QL; 
B &QL; 
DEFENSIVE LINE &QL; 
Only one sack for Big Sky's best sacking team, but PSU's Jimmy
Blanchard took a lot of three-step drops. Vikings had 148 yards on
ground, almost 30 yards less than their per-game average. &QL; 
B &QL; 
LINEBACKERS &QL; 
A combined 10 tackles from Cos Abercrombie and Jack Heaslet (five
each) simply isn't enough. CSUN's safeties still lead the team in
tackling every game, which means LBs aren't doing their job. &QL; 
C- &QL; 
DEFENSIVE BACKS &QL; 
These guys weren't burned by Jimmy Blanchard, one of the
conference's best QBs. But PSU receivers, most notably Terry
Charles, dropped several passes that could have gone for long
gains. &QL; 
B &QL; 
SPECIAL TEAMS &QL; 
A missed extra point, a muffed punt return, yet another bad snap on
a punt . . . the little things aren't getting done. Amerson is
becoming a threat on kickoff returns, though. He was the bright
spot. &QL; 
C- &QL; 
COACHING &QL; 
There seems to be a lack of responsibility by the Matadors players
over their committing stupid penalties, and the coaches need to do
something to change that _ immediately. &QL;

JOHN HADFIELD, 92, WHOSE BOOK ON BRITISH LIFE BECAME A TV SERIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Hadfield, an editor of literary anthologies and the author
of ``Love on a Branch Line,'' a fanciful tale of British rural life
in 1950s East Anglia that became a successful television series,
died the last week of October, The Daily Telegraph of London
reported. He was 92 and lived in Woodbridge in the English county
of Suffolk.
</P>
<P>
   Hadfield's bond with East Anglia, the easternmost peninsula of
England, was formed during World War II when the ship in which he
was traveling was torpedoed in the mid-Atlantic and he was sent to
recuperate in a sanatorium in the county of Norfolk.
</P>
<P>
   As an invalid he compiled an anthology of poetry, ``The Book of
Beauty'' (1952), the first of nearly a dozen. The work was so
popular that it allowed Hadfield to buy Barham Manor, a beautiful
but decrepit 16th-century house north of Ipswich where he designed
gardens and kept peacocks.
</P>
<P>
   His move to the region also coincided with the closing of the
Mid-Suffolk Light Railway, which ran from Haughley Junction to
Laxfield, or ``from nowhere to nowhere,'' as the locals liked to
put it.
</P>
<P>
   Out of this incident grew ``Love on a Branch Line,'' about a
staid civil servant, Jasper Pye, who is sent to set up an office in
East Anglia, where he encounters the flamboyant Lord Flamborough, a
double amputee who lives in splendor on his private railroad train,
and his three uninhibited daughters.
</P>
<P>
   The book, first published in 1959, was an immediate success; it
was reissued in 1988 and adapted for television in 1994 as a
four-part series for the BBC.
</P>
<P>
   Born on the outskirts of Birmingham, where his father practiced
law, Hadfield was educated at Bradfield. After graduation he joined
the London publishing firm of J.M. Dent, where his authors included
Field Marshal Montgomery, for whom he edited a book on the history
of warfare.
</P>
<P>
   In 1942 he was sent to the Middle East as books officer for the
British Council, where he formed a committee to translate English
books into Arabic. The translations varied wildly; Sir Arthur Conan
Doyle's ``Sign of Four'' became, in Arabic, ``Where Is the
Treasure, O Sherlock Holmes?,'' while ``Gone With the Wind'' was
whittled down to a mere 60 pages.
</P>
<P>
   After returning to England, Hadfield set up his own publishing
company, Cupid Press, which specialized in beautifully bound
anthologies of poetry and engravings published as limited editions.
</P>
<P>
   In 1952 he became editor of ``The Saturday Book,'' an
illustrated anthology of literature, poetry and curiosities
published every Christmas and touted as a ``gift book to please
every taste.'' He remained editor for 21 years, introducing such
poets as John Betjeman.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his second wife, Joy Westendarp, and a
daughter by his first marriage. &QL;

RULING PARTY ASKS VOTERS TO CHOOSE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Mexico's ruling party took its biggest step toward
democracy Sunday by asking millions of voters to choose its next
presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's primary election for the Institutional Revolutionary
Party marked the first time in the 70 years it has governed Mexico
that the country's dominant political organization has not relied
on a system in which the sitting president picks the party's next
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   But it remained unclear whether the primary campaign, which
featured four party stalwarts who often engaged in bitter public
disputes, would leave the party divided and damage its chances in
next year's general elections.
</P>
<P>
   Although official results were not available from PRI officials,
former interior secretary Francisco Labastida Ochoa, who many say
is President Ernesto Zedillo's preferred candidate, was expected to
defeat his closest rival, former Tabasco state governor Roberto
Madrazo Pintado.
</P>
<P>
   Two other candidates, former Puebla governor Manuel Bartlett
Diaz and former party leader Humberto Roque Villanueva, were
expected to trail far behind the front-runners.
</P>
<P>
   Despite cynicism among many voters that party leaders have been
working to ensure a Labastida victory, PRI officials said turnout
had been heavy across the country.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico City, turnout varied by precinct, and there were
scattered reports of polling places that opened late because voting
materials were not delivered on time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is proof that the PRI is willing to be more
democratic,'' said Candido Mayen Gonzalez, 66. ``It hasn't been
perfect, but at least they're trying to be more modern.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's election was open to all of Mexico's 55 million
registered voters, but PRI officials expected that only 6 million
would cast ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Because most people expect a Labastida victory, the most
pressing question now is whether Madrazo, 47, a self-described
alternative to the party's machine, would leave the party for
another to continue his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   During a gathering with reporters on Saturday, Labastida
predicted a 60 percent chance that Madrazo would split from the
PRI. Even if Madrazo left, Labastida added, the PRI would still be
able to win the general elections.
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo officials, however, insisted in a separate meeting
during the weekend that their candidate would not leave the PRI,
arguing that such a move would only benefit Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI's decision to hold a primary election was driven largely
by its decision to make the world's longest-ruling political party
seem more democratic and open. Since its founding in 1929, the PRI
has never lost a presidential election, but most Mexicans suspect
the party has often relied on electoral fraud and voter
intimidation to ensure its victories.
</P>
<P>
   With more competition from opposition parties during the last
two years, however, the PRI has experimented with the primaries in
several gubernatorial races. Party leaders found that the process
gave its candidates better name recognition and created the feeling
among voters that the PRI had taken steps to reform itself.
</P>
<P>
   But whether the PRI's record of success with primaries will also
work for next July's presidential election remains unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's winner will face two formidable opposition candidates:
Francisco Fox Quesada, a former Coca-Cola executive and governor of
Guanajuato state who is the candidate of the conservative National
Action Party; and Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the former mayor of Mexico
City, who is the candidate of a leftist coalition led by the Party
of the Democratic Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   There has been talk lately of a possible alliance between the
two opposition parties to ensure a PRI defeat in July, but neither
Fox nor Cardenas seems willing to let the other become the main
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Eckstein, a sociologist and Mexico specialist at Boston
University, said the PRI primary raises the stakes for other
parties in Mexico to appear more democratic.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is genuinely opening up the system, then the PRI is
likely to get candidates who can get out the vote,'' Eckstein said.
``Not only does it make the PRI look like the bearer of democracy,
but it increases its chances of having a winning candidate.''

<P>
   William Malcolm Goodhart, whose first effort at play writing
became a Broadway hit, died on Oct. 20 at his home on Shelter
Island, N.Y. He was 74. The cause was heart disease, his family
said.
</P>
<P>
   Goodhart achieved the dream of every aspiring playwright when
his comedy, ``Generation,'' opened on Broadway in 1965 and quickly
found an audience. The show, directed by Gene Saks, starred Henry
Fonda as a parent coping with his determinedly unconventional
daughter and son-in-law, who decide to deliver their own baby.
</P>
<P>
   Despite some lukewarm reviews, ``Generation'' settled in for a
long run and was adapted for the screen by Goodhart in 1969. In the
film, David Janssen played the role originated by Fonda.
</P>
<P>
   Born in New Haven, Conn., in 1925, Goodhart was a physics major
at Yale University before enlisting in the Army in 1943. After the
war he returned to Yale to study at the drama school and began his
career as a scenic artist and lighting designer. After the success
of ``Generation,'' Goodhart became a writer and producer for Warner
Brothers. His screen credits include ``The Heretic,'' which was a
sequel to ``The Exorcist,'' and ``Cloud Dancer.''
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Joanne; three daughters, Eliza
Goodhart Denoeux, Amy Goodhart Redburn and Sarah Celeste Goodhart,
and four grandchildren.

GEORGE V. HIGGINS, 59, AUTHOR OF CRIME NOVELS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.) (ms) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   George V. Higgins, a crime novelist best known for his first
published work, the best seller ``Friends of Eddie Coyle,'' was
found dead Nov. 6 at his home in Milton, Mass. He was 59. He
apparently died of natural causes, The Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   The writing skills that Higgins showed in ``Eddie Coyle'' (1972)
prompted an enthusiastic review by Christopher Lehmann-Haupt in The
New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``In deference to the oblique speaking styles of Eddie Coyle and
his friends, and because I find myself so utterly in thrall to the
mood of George V. Higgins' first novel, let me approach the book's
merits somewhat deviously,'' the review began.
</P>
<P>
   Lehmann-Haupt went on to applaud ``the deftness that is evident
everywhere in this ultrarealistic little slice of criminal life,
written by an assistant U.S. attorney for the district of
Massachusetts, and one of the best of its genre I have read since
Hemingway's `The Killers.'''
</P>
<P>
   The 183-page work, about a hoodlum who becomes an informer for
the police, has settings in Higgins' native Massachusetts and
includes a bank robbery and earthy dialogue that, Lehmann-Haupt
wrote, ``eats at one's nerve endings.'' The book's ironies,
including ``a world in which hoods and cops depend on one another
to eke out their mean livings,'' are ``corrosive enough,'' he
added, and ``the ending is as hard as a set of metal knuckles in
the face.''
</P>
<P>
   Adapted by Paul Monash, the book became a 1973 movie that
starred Robert Mitchum as Eddie Coyle. Vincent Canby, writing in
The Times, called it ``a good, tough, unsentimental movie,'' and
praised Mitchum's performance in the title role as conveying ``wit
and a certain dignity'' on its less-than-tragic hero.
</P>
<P>
   Higgins' other novels include ``The Digger's Game,'' ``Cogan's
Trade'' and ``A City on a Hill.'' His last work was ``The Agent''
(1999), about an unpopular sports agent. He also wrote columns for
The Boston Herald American, The Boston Globe, and The Wall Street
Journal from 1977 to 1985.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in the mid-1980's Higgins said he had been
influenced by John O'Hara, particularly by his short stories.
</P>
<P>
   Higgins was born in Brockton, Mass., and received a bachelor's
degree from Boston College in 1961 and a law degree from Boston
College in 1967. He was an assistant attorney general and then an
assistant U.S. attorney in Boston from 1969 to 1973.
</P>
<P>
   His marriage to Elizabeth Mulkerin ended in divorce. He is
survived by his wife, Loretta, a daughter and a son.

   (NYT26) NEW YORK -- Nov. 7, 1999 -- RUN-NY-MARA-WHEELCHAIRS-2,
11-7 -- Wheelchair competitors in the 1999 New York City Marathon
giving their all in a race in which for the first time none of them
were stopped along the course to let leading runners pass. Nine
wheelchair athletes, including two of the top three men's finishers
Sunday, filed suit against the New York Road Runners Club in July,
alleging that the marathon has discriminated against them not only
by delaying wheelchair racers to let top runners pass, but also by
denying them prize money and medals, which the elite runners
receive. (James Estrin/New York Times Photo)

to roll across the finish line in the New York City Marathon's
wheelchair event on Sunday, and he thrust his fists in the air and
savored victory. But for Such and several other wheelchair
athletes, who have sued the marathon's organizers for
discrimination, the real victory was that none of them were stopped
along the course to let leading runners pass. (Steve Berman/New

year, Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, told him that his dominion over
trillions of dollars would make him ``the second most powerful
person in our whole government,'' a daunting thought, in part since
Lew does not appear to have aged much since college. The power is
real and Lew, knee-deep in politics since he was 12 years old,
wants to use it. ``The purpose of power is to get things done,''
says Lew. (Shana Raab/New York Times Photo)

300 homeowners have become part-time concert promoters, turning
their homes into mild-mannered clubs for a night, and scores of

others. In his 45 years as an agent and manager, stretching from
the era of Catskill comedy to ``Saturday Night Live,'' Brillstein
has never been accused of mincing words. His newly published
autobiography will do nothing to challenge his image. The book is

justice those who bombed the 16th Street Baptist Church and killed
four black girls in 1963. Across the South, unresolved, racially

11-7 -- Wheelchair competitors in the 1999 New York City Marathon
giving their all in a race in which for the first time none of them
were stopped along the course to let leading runners pass. Nine
wheelchair athletes, including two of the top three men's finishers
Sunday, filed suit against the New York Road Runners Club in July,
alleging that the marathon has discriminated against them not only
by delaying wheelchair racers to let top runners pass, but also by
denying them prize money and medals, which the elite runners
receive. (James Estrin/New York Times Photo)

wheelchair event on Sunday, and he thrust his fists in the air and
savored victory. But for Such and several other wheelchair
athletes, who have sued the marathon's organizers for
discrimination, the real victory was that none of them were stopped
along the course to let leading runners pass. (Steve Berman/New

JACKSON'S COMPLAINTS PROBABLY WON'T HELP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's hardly a new complaint: Teams pound on
Shaquille O'Neal like it's free time on the pinata.
</P>
<P>
   Del Harris moaned about it. Kurt Rambis complained of it. And
now it's Phil Jackson's turn to try to do something about what has
frustrated other O'Neal coaches to no end.
</P>
<P>
   And best of luck.
</P>
<P>
   After O'Neal was ejected for a pair of technicals after he lost
his temper when repeatedly fouled hard Saturday night in Portland,
Jackson said: ``I was really disappointed with the refereeing. I
thought it was awful.''
</P>
<P>
   That could bring him a $5,000 fine from the NBA, the league
typically frowning on its coaches ripping the officials. But is
there anything Jackson really thinks can be done to end the
hack-a-Shaq routine favored by so many teams?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it's very simple,'' he said. ``The referees have to
determine whether it's a foul on the ball or the guy is going to
block the shot, or it's a foul just to take him out and prevent him
from scoring. That's a flagrant foul according to the books. I
think focus will come to play on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is treated with the kind of respect other O'Neal coaches
might not have always enjoyed, but referees have never shown an
inclination to protect a guy 7-foot-1 and 330 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Teams figure they can't stop him inside, so they quickly foul
him hard before he can begin his shot. It doesn't help O'Neal's
cause that he's such a weak threat at the free-throw line (10 of 28
entering Sunday's game).
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal would not comment after being ejected Saturday night in
Portland, and again refused to talk to the media before Sunday's
game with the Dallas Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson repeated Sunday that O'Neal had let the team down by
losing his cool and getting ejected, but his public attack of the
officials was old-school coaches' defense of standing by your
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me (it is),'' Jackson said. ``I don't know if any other
coach will do it. It's part of the role of who I am and what I
believe in as far as the players that I coach. They need to know
that.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Also: The Lakers' one weakness is generally considered to be
at power forward, but Dallas forward and former Laker Cedric
Ceballos figures with A.C. Green the Lakers should be fine: ``You
don't need a big-time four with a guy like (O'Neal). All they need
A.C. to do is rebound and play defense, and that's what he does
best.'' . . . With Derek Fisher in a shooting slump, 5-11 Tyronn
Lue is getting some unexpected playing time at the point. Said Lue:
``I'm more confident because he's giving me opportunity to play.
I'm just trying to build from here and try to get better.''

   Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule book reviews:
</P>
<P>
   ``MY GARDEN (BOOK)''  &QL; 
By Jamaica Kincaid (FSG, $23) &QL; 
Jamaica Kincaid has written books full of her difficult feelings
for her mother and her brother, but boy, does she love her garden.
She is agitated and vexed when she's in it, but she's happy:
``Nothing works just the way I thought it would, nothing looks just
the way I had imagined it, and when sometimes it does look like
what I had imagined (and this, thank God, is rare) I am startled
that my imagination is so ordinary.'' This book is dense with
growing things, overrun with blooms, fertile with every plant
you've ever heard of and then some. Fellow gardening author Michael
Pollan says Kincaid's voice is that of ``an exquisitely attentive
gardener thinking out loud.'' We'd note that ``exquisitely
attentive'' is a kind way of saying ``obsessed,'' but then it's all
New &AMP; Notable can do to water the tomatoes. Kincaid celebrates seed
and plant catalogs, discusses the link between gardeners and
conquerors, and notes that ``everyone I have ever met who has a
garden has something growing in it from seeds that were gathered in
Monet's garden.'' That means she cultivates exotic friends, too. &QL; 
``THE BOOK BORROWER'' &QL; 
By Alice Mattison (Morrow, $24) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This odd and meandering novel begins with the meeting of two
young mothers at a park in 1975. Deborah Laidlaw is there with her
daughters, Toby Ruben with her baby son, and in the course of their
conversation Toby borrows a book that Deborah has been carrying
around but has not found time to read. Two things begin in this
scene: a lifelong friendship between Toby and Deborah, and our
interest in the fate of that borrowed book, ``Trolley Girl,'' the
story of a tragedy that occurred during a strike among trolley
workers in 1921. For much of her novel, Mattison alternates the
interplay between Toby, Deborah and their families with sections
narrated by the author of ``Trolley Girl.'' We're not sure why she
does this but we're grateful for it, because ``Trolley Girl''
proceeds with a sense of purpose and anticipation. The ground is
not so firm under Toby and Deborah, whose friendship unfolds in
rambling conversations and unseen resolutions. One chapter ends
with a terrible conflict between the two friends when Toby almost
gets Deborah fired from her teaching job. To our surprise, the next
chapter begins years later, with their friendship obviously
restored, although Mattison does not say how. This is exasperating,
but ``The Book Borrower'' is not without saving graces. One is Toby
Ruben, an authentic character who slips into mean-spiritedness when
she feels threatened. Another is Mattison's portrayal of the give
and take between friends, between men and women, between parents
and children _ that messy navigation of emotional ties. In the end,
her novel is less notable for its story than for these small
moments that ring true. &QL; 
``IF THIS HOUSE COULD TALK'' &QL; 
By Elizabeth Smith Brownstein (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $35) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I have found that it is the visible, the tangible, that goes a
long way in softening prejudices,'' Booker T. Washington wrote in
``Up From Slavery.'' ``The actual sight of a first-class house that
a Negro has built is 10 times more potent than pages of discussion
about a house that he ought to build, or perhaps could build.'' And
so, against the wishes of some of his benefactors, Washington built
``The Oaks,'' a red brick house with parlor, library, dining room,
kitchen, family and guest bedrooms, den, breakfast room, five
bathrooms and a veranda on three acres of land overlooking the
campus of Alabama's Tuskegee Institute. Among the other buildings
included in this look at historic homes and the people who lived in
them are the stunning ``symphony in wood'' built in 1908 (for a
mere $55,000) for Proctor &AMP; Gamble heir David Gamble in Pasadena,
Calif.; the New Hampshire farm of poet Robert Frost; Lorenzo
Hubbell's house and trading post in Ganado; the Massachusetts
homestead of Rebecca Nurse, who was hanged during the Salem witch
trials; the Bronx, N.Y., cottage of Edgar Allan Poe; and Frank
Lloyd Wright's Storer House and Auldbrass Plantation. Our favorite
is illustrator Edward Gorey's Cape Cod cottage, where books are
piled precariously high on every horizontal surface in sight. This
engaging blend of history, architecture and interior design
contains what its author calls ``stories of great passion, courage
and brilliance . . . and enough cruelty, greed and ignorance to go
around.'' &QL; 
``THE COST OF LIVING'' &QL; 
By Arundhati Roy (Modern Library, $11.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Roy follows her Booker Prize-winning first novel, ``The God of
Small Things,'' with two essays, one on dam projects that have
scarred her native India and the other on India's detonation last
year of a nuclear bomb. The first, called ``The Greater Common
Good,'' is more demanding reading, but both benefit from Roy's very
personal and appealingly abrasive style. In the second essay, ``The
End of Imagination,'' she touches on the success of her novel.
``The more I thought about it,'' she writes, ``the clearer it
became to me that if fame was going to be my permanent condition it
would kill me. Club me to death with its good manners and hygiene.
I'll admit that I've enjoyed my own five minutes of it immensely
but primarilyBECAUSE (editor: ITAL) it was just five minutes.
Because I knew (or thought I knew) that I could go home when I was
bored and giggle about it. Grow old and irresponsible. Eat mangoes
in the moonlight. Maybe write a couple of failed books _
worstsellers _ to see what it felt like.'' Instead, she has written
this, a thought-provoking challenge from a citizen of India and of
the world. &QL;

VAN NUYS AIRPORT GIVES HOLLYWOOD CONVENIENCE, PRIVACY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JESSE HIESTAND 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; LOS ANGELES -- Whenever Vanna White needs to get out of town
fast, the ``Wheel of Fortune'' letter- and head-turner hops aboard
one of two Learjets she owns at Van Nuys Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The same with actors Dennis Quaid, John Travolta, and Tom Cruise
and Nicole Kidman, who keep jets at Van Nuys Airport. And Robert
Redford, Charlton Heston, Kevin Costner and basketball bad-boy
Dennis Rodman regularly charter flights out of Van Nuys.
</P>
<P>
   They all have made Van Nuys Airport a veritable Airport of the
Stars, the air hub of choice in Los Angeles because of convenience
and privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just show up, get on the plane and take off,'' said White,
whose husband is a pilot. ``There's no waiting on private jets _
and absolutely no luggage problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though a private flight can cost $1,200 to $4,000 an hour,
pilots and charter-plane owners said they have no problem filling
seats with the rich and famous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Speed, convenience and privacy'' said Learjet pilot Max
Falahati, who flies top Hollywood talent, high rollers and athletes
with his company Millennium Jets. ``You go on your own timetable.
There are no delays and no cancellations. Also, we can get to
airports that the airlines can't go to.''
</P>
<P>
   The roster of celebrities who use Van Nuys is closely guarded,
but on occasion, a mishap sometimes leads to their disclosure. For
instance, Harrison Ford recently crash-landed a helicopter near
Lake Piru after flying out of Van Nuys. He and a flight instructor
walked away unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   And in February, director Barry Sonnenfeld, whose credits
include ``Wild, Wild West,'' ``The Addams Family'' and ``Men in
Black'' was aboard a Gulfstream II that skidded across a Van Nuys
runway in a hard landing, hitting four parked planes. No one was
hut.
</P>
<P>
   Some said it is unfair that a privileged few get to travel in
such luxury and help make Van Nuys the busiest general aviation
airport in the nation. They bridle at the noise from the roughly
110 private jets and 500 other propeller planes.
</P>
<P>
   ``To save a little bit of inconvenience on their part, these
people distress tens of thousands of Valley residents,'' said
Gerald Silver, president of Homeowners of Encino and its Stop the
Noise! campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an exclusive airport that serves only a handful of
wealthy business executives, rock stars and entertainers who don't
want to be troubled by taking the inconvenience of first-class
travel out of LAX,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   White said her planes seek to abide by the voluntary flight
curfew of 10:45 p.m. to 6:45 a.m. and that she and other
celebrities still take commercial flights out of Los Angeles
International Airport for business.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts such as soundproofing homes are under way to trim the
noise but many homeowners said it is not enough and are calling for
a strict phaseout of these jets.
</P>
<P>
   The fact remains that Hollywood has used Van Nuys since 1929, a
year after the then-named Metropolitan Airport opened. Howard
Hughes, Cecil B. DeMille and Gene Autry were among the stars who
first started flying at the new airport.
</P>
<P>
   In the '30s, Hollywood producers started using the airport for
film locations. Scenes from ``Casablanca'' were shot there and the
airport remains a prime locale for feature films, TV shows, music
videos and commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Recent movies shot in part at Van Nuys Airport include
flight-themed ``Con Air'' and ``Air Force One.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They can get things done on the tarmac and other areas that
could not be done at other airports,'' said Mike Bobenko of the
Entertainment Industry Development Corp., which coordinates filming
locations for Los Angeles city and county.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount Pictures and its parent company Viacom are among the
studios that have jets at the airport. The studio's two Gulfstreams
are primarily used for executive travel but have also shuttled
actors to New York for the publicity appearances on David
Letterman's show, or to Los Angeles to be interviewed by Jay Leno,
said David Zagnoli of the corporate aviation department.
</P>
<P>
   White's jets rarely sit idle, as she leases them to celebrity
friends _ household names that she and charter services keep secret
out of privacy concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I make reservations far enough in advance I can probably
get it,'' said White, now in her 17th year as co-host of the
popular game show. ``We thought we'd get a second one so we can use
it, but it's always busy flying other people.''
</P>
<P>
   Such convenience is also prized by several corporations that use
the airport, including MGM Grand, Litton Industries, Guess? Inc.,
Hughes Electronics, Anheuser Busch and Dole Foods.
</P>
<P>
   The mysterious crash of champion golfer Payne Stewart's Learjet
35 in South Dakota recently has not slaked celebrities' thirst for
a quick escape from L.A.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those planes have a great reputation, and I know from paying
the maintenance bill that they're in great shape,'' said White,
whose two Learjet 35s are based at charter provider Clay Lacy
Aviation.

 MANY BOEING 767s MAY HAVE IMPROPERLY TORQUED TAIL BOLTS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I. _ Hundreds of Boeing 767 airplanes like the one
that crashed off the Massachusetts coast Oct. 31, killing all 217
people aboard, could be flying with improperly torqued bolts that
hold the vertical tail to the fuselage, the Seattle
Post-Intelligencer has learned.
</P>
<P>
   It is not yet clear if the suspect bolts could be in planes
built as far back as 1989, the year the 767-300 that crashed was
delivered to EgyptAir.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing says the bolts aren't likely to pose a safety threat to
airplanes because of the big jet's structure. But the company says
it is considering issuing a service bulletin warning operators of
the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing late last month grounded its first 767-400, a plane still
in flight testing, until the tail bolts were replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Seven other planes that were either in final assembly or on the
Everett, Wash., flight line _ five 767-300s and two 767-400s headed
for flight test _ have since had their tail bolts removed and
replaced, a Boeing spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Some tail bolts in those eight planes were found to have been
undertorqued.
</P>
<P>
   A Boeing spokesman said the company is attempting to determine
the extent of the problem and how long ago it began. ``Because of
redundancy in the structure of the tail fin, we don't believe this
is a safety-of-flight issue,'' said Doug Webb, Boeing's chief
spokesman at the Everett plant where the 767 is built.
</P>
<P>
   A person familiar with the issue said Boeing machinists have
unknowingly used a faulty calibration process to torque 767 tail
bolts since at least 1992, and perhaps longer.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration on Friday sent two
inspectors to the Everett plant to audit Boeing's tool calibration
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are performing on-going audits of calibration of tooling
and how it is monitored by Boeing,'' said Vi Lipski, deputy
airplane transport directorate manager in the FAA's Renton office.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 800 of the 767 widebody jets have been built since the
first one entered service with United Airlines in 1982. Today, the
twin-engine 767 is the dominant plane on trans-Atlantic routes
between Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   It has a good safety record.
</P>
<P>
   Other than a hijacking that ended in an ocean ditching when the
plane ran out of fuel, only two 767s have been involved in fatal
crashes, including EgyptAir Flight 990.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators don't know the cause of the latest crash. In 1991,
a Lauda Air 767-300 crashed in a Thailand jungle when an engine
thrust reverser deployed in flight. All 223 people aboard were
killed.
</P>
<P>
   Once Boeing has a better understanding of the torque problem, it
is likely to issue a service bulletin to 767 operators,
recommending that the tail bolts be checked and replaced if
necessary. A service bulletin could trigger an airworthiness
directive from the FAA that would make any Boeing recommendation
mandatory.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as FAA awareness, I would be looking to Boeing to
present us information as to how prevalent this is with planes in
service,'' Lipski said. ``I don't know ...''
</P>
<P>
   Lipski said she could not say, without knowing specific details,
if improperly torqued 767 tail bolts pose a safety concern for the
flying public.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may have safety implications. But we would have to look
at the conditions ... if there are other redundancies. ... I can't
say what this event would cause. We would have to assess more
information about the design and integrity of the vertical fin.''
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen bolts, each about 4 inches long and 3/4 inch in
diameter, hold the massive tail fin, also called the vertical
stabilizer, to the 767 fuselage. The tail fin is attached to the
fuselage during final body join on the production line. Each of
those bolts must be tightened, or torqued, in foot pounds (the
amount of energy required to lift one pound a distance of one
foot), to engineering specifications. A special set of calibrated
tools is required.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing only recently became aware that 767 tail bolts were being
incorrectly torqued by Everett machinists.
</P>
<P>
   Webb said a 767-300 operator notified Boeing on Sept. 30 that
mechanics had found two undertorqued tail bolts on the plane.
</P>
<P>
   He would not identify the operator.
</P>
<P>
   A source said the operator was American Airlines, and the
undertorqued bolts were discovered by the airline's mechanics
during what is known as a C-check. This is the first major overhaul
a commercial jetliner undergoes after a certain amount of time in
service.
</P>
<P>
   The source said mechanics found the tail bolts were so loose
that they were ``banging around.''
</P>
<P>
   The plane was the 700th to roll down the Everett 767 production
line, and was delivered in April 1998. Some 70 more 767s have been
built since that one.
</P>
<P>
   Only the one 767 carrier has reported finding incorrectly
torqued tail bolts, Webb said.
</P>
<P>
   Those 16 tail bolts on the 767 are covered with a seal to
protect them from corrosion. The seal must be scraped away before
they can be checked.
</P>
<P>
   Once Boeing was made aware of the problem, Webb said, the
company launched an investigation to find the cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found that the tools used in the bolt installation could
produce an undertorqued condition,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA was notified Oct. 26, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Two different tools are used in combination to bolt the tail to
the 767 fuselage at the final body joint station where the work is
performed. Only one set of tools is used by machinists on all
shifts.
</P>
<P>
   One tool is called a nut runner. It is an air-driven torque
wrench that essentially works like the pneumatic lug wrench used by
pit crews to quickly remove and replace tires on a race car.
</P>
<P>
   The other tool is known as a torque multiplier. This device
helps machinists apply the hundreds of foot pounds of torque
required to tighten the bolts.
</P>
<P>
   Although Boeing said the nut runner was properly calibrated, the
FAA's Lipski said the nut runner and torque multiplier should have
been calibrated together, but were not.
</P>
<P>
   ``When used together, the spinning ratios were not accurate,''
Lipski said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When independently calibrated, they could result in an
out-of-torque condition.''
</P>
<P>
   Lipski said it is up to Boeing and not the FAA to make sure
calibration processes, as well as the internal monitoring of those
processes, is adequate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no FAA requirement,'' she said. ``Boeing has a system
in place to monitor this. I would default to Boeing's system and
procedures.''
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Heathers, a 767 spokeswoman, said the nut runner was last
verified to have the proper calibration in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Webb said Boeing does not know how long the two tools have been
used in combination without joint calibration.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are reviewing all the processes to find out when this
started,'' he said. ``We have been told a number of different
dates.''
</P>
<P>
   A person familiar with the issue told the Post-Intelligencer the
two tools should never have used in combination without checking
with engineering, and is the result of Boeing having too many
inexperienced people on the 767 line in 1989. Many of the most
senior machinists had been transferred to the 747-400 line because
of production problems with the company's newest version of its
jumbo jet, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was sucking away the best people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That was the year the EgyptAir 767-300 was built. It was the
283rd plane to roll down the 767 line, though no connection between
the crash Oct. 31 and the bolt problem has been made. The Lauda Air
jet that later crashed was right behind it, plane No. 282. That
crash was blamed on an accidental deployment of a thrust reverser.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one on the 767 line ever went to the tooling engineers to
check if this procedure (for using the two tools in combination
during tail join) was okay,'' the source said. ``They just started
doing it. The machinists say they have been doing this for at least
seven years, but people on the factory floor know it was done the
same way before that.''

 _ SF CHRON   By Tom Stein &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
There's a new twist in the evolution of e-commerce: A handful of
online companies are starting to move offline. They are opening up
physical stores and showrooms as a way to better connect with
consumers, bolster credibility and ultimately drive more traffic
back to their Web sites.
<P>
   Call it the first batch of clicks-to-bricks companies.
</P>
<P>
   It's a logical next step for Internet merchants. After all, the
Internet is merely one channel for reaching customers. Analysts
believe online companies must learn to attract consumers everywhere
they live and work, and that includes the real world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flagship stores are necessary to target mass consumers,'' said
Internet analyst Mike May of Jupiter Communications in New York.
``Their function is not so much to sell products, but to acquaint
and educate consumers about their online counterparts and
legitimize the brand name.''
</P>
<P>
   An upscale online auctioneer called GMBid.com, for one,
simultaneously unveiled its Web site in August along with a
10,000-square-foot showroom just off Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills,
where potential bidders can personally inspect such auction items
as classic Ferraris, Chagall paintings and Cartier watches. Then
they can use Internet terminals in the showroom to place their bids
in cyberspace _ or wait until they get back to their home or
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's critically important in terms of building trust to have a
physical location where people can find you and feel the
excitement,'' said Julie Carson, president of GMBid.com.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans to build similar showrooms in other major
metropolitan areas like London, New York and Chicago. The showrooms
will all contain Web kiosks for bidding. The GMBid.com site also
will feature live Web cams so bidders around the world can view
items in the showrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Clicks-to-bricks firms are another twist on the so-called
click-and-mortar operations, in which traditional brick-and-mortar
companies like Barnes &AMP; Noble and Toys R Us jumped into the
Internet, combining their physical operations with cyberspace
``clicks.''
</P>
<P>
   Most pundits readily agree that traditional offline companies
that do not adopt an online strategy will get annihilated in the
new economy. But now they are starting to ponder whether the
reverse is true as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can an e-business be solely an e-business, or will it have to
morph into a clicks-and-mortar play?'' asked Christopher Lochhead,
chief marketing officer at Internet consulting firm Scient Corp. in
San Francisco. ``That question is still up for grabs.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies like Gazoontite.com, 800.com, GMBid.com and
Drugstore.com are not taking any chances.
</P>
<P>
   Gazoontite.com, which sells such products as air purifiers,
anti-dust-mite bedding and aromatherapy candles, came online this
summer with a Web site as well as a 1,500-square-foot flagship
store in San Francisco's Union Square. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Soon Yu, chief executive of Gazoontite, said it cost about
$200,000 to open his San Francisco store, but he feels that's a
small price to pay in terms of acquiring customers and then leading
them to the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   He may have a point. Today, Internet companies are pouring
millions of dollars into TV and print ads in order to raise brand
awareness. Ad spending by Net companies for this year is expected
to top $1 billion. Amazon.com alone has said it will spend $100
million on marketing for this Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a per-dollar basis, we are getting a bigger bang for our
buck,'' Yu said.
</P>
<P>
   The Gazoontite.com store, which attracts thousands of tourists
and passers-by each day, boasts Internet shopping kiosks as well as
plenty of signs and logos highlighting its dot-com heritage. ```We
are making the stores very integrated with the Web environment,''
said Yu. ``We are first and foremost a dot-com company.''
</P>
<P>
   Building a strong brand name and consumer trust is vital to any
Internet company.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not what Yu was thinking about when he originally
dreamed up his company. At first, Gazoontite was going to exist
solely in cyberspace. After all, he reasoned, it's a lot easier _
and cheaper _ to get a virtual business up and running.
</P>
<P>
   But Yu quickly realized his business plan had some major holes.
After conducting some basic market research, he saw that consumers
would be reluctant to buy his offbeat breathing and lifestyle
products without first being able to see, smell and touch them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because our products are unfamiliar, people need to experience
them for themselves,'' explained Yu. ``In a Web-only environment,
our products appeared less credible and consumers were less likely
to buy them.''
</P>
<P>
   Investing hundreds of thousands of dollars in physical stores
and showrooms doesn't appeal to all Web-based businesses. But that
just may be the price some companies must pay to attract mainstream
customers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Consumer e-commerce is expected to hit about $30 billion this
year. That may seem like a large number, but it represents only
about 2 or 3 percent of the traditional retail market. Or look at
this way: Last year Barnes &AMP; Noble did $3 billion in sales,
compared with only $610 million for Amazon. To make more money and
compete effectively, Internet companies must broaden their
strategies and learn to play in the world of ``stores with doors.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Online-Offline Team
</P>
<P>
   Drugstore.com is taking that advice to heart and is teaming up
with Rite Aid, one of the nation's biggest brick-and-mortar
drugstore chains to expand its market.
</P>
<P>
   Through this partnership, Drugstore.com gains an instant offline
presence. Customers can order their drugs online and then pick them
up at their local Rite Aid store.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's naive to think you can attract customers with just a
pretty Web site,'' said Drugstore.com chief executive Peter
Neupert.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership with Rite Aid was a matter of survival for
Drugstore.com. That's because it found that many people did not
like the idea of ordering their medications online and then having
to wait several days before they arrived. Also, the company had
trouble establishing relationships with large health insurance
providers, and thus had to turn some customers away because it
could not accept their insurance cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people like the convenience of ordering online and then
getting it delivered to their home,'' said Neupert. ``But it's
important to offer multiple channels because there are some items
that people need right away. The Rite Aid partnership fills a real
need in terms of allowing us to move more quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the Rite Aid partnership goes a long way toward
boosting his company's brand awareness among consumers. Rite Aid,
for instance, has agreed to place the Drugstore.com logo on its
shopping bags, receipts and prescription labels.
</P>
<P>
   Not every Internet company is convinced it needs a
clicks-to-bricks strategy. Amazon.com, arguably the biggest and
most recognizable e-business in the world, said it is not about to
open up retail stores in the physical world anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't found a great reason to go offline,'' said Amazon
spokeswoman Lizzie Allen. ``We can't think of a single way that
opening up a retail store would improve the customer experience.''
</P>
<P>
   But proponents of clicks-to-bricks operations point to the
convenience of being able to place a book order online from the
office and then pick it up on the way home at the Amazon
Superstore, thus eliminating the wait as well as those pesky
delivery charges.
</P>
<P>
   To be offline, or not to be? That is the question facing
Portland's 800.com, which sells consumer electronic products such
as TVs, stereos, and DVD players on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have done lots of focus groups and concluded that consumers
don't enjoy going to electronics stores,'' said 800.com chief
executive Greg Drew. ``They are actively looking for an
alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the company is taking its first baby steps into
the physical world. It recently opened a small retail outlet at its
corporate headquarters in Portland, Ore. On display are hundreds of
products that consumers can test for themselves. There are also Web
terminals where shoppers can select from 800.com's stock of more
than 250,000 products.
</P>
<P>
   But, oddly enough, Drew doesn't want news of his offline plans
leaking out. ``Just forget we have a physical store,'' he pleads.
``It's not really a part of our overall strategy.''

CORTINES READY FOR JOB TURNING AROUND LAUSD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREG GITTRICH 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; LOS ANGELES -- At dawn this morning, when Ramon C. Cortines
plans to walk into the Los Angeles Unified headquarters, he will
usher in a new era for the nation's second-largest school district,
where a culture of incompetence and denial will no longer be
tolerated or ignored.
</P>
<P>
   The rhetoric and the posturing are over, says Cortines _ an
intense, confident, energetic 67-year-old who has closely watched
leaders of the $7.4 billion public school system stumble for more
than a year.
</P>
<P>
   The former Pasadena, New York City, and San Francisco school
chief pledges to focus on the basics _ putting ``the right'' books
in hands of every student, cleaning up sullied and vandalized
bathrooms and building schools in innovative ways.
</P>
<P>
   During a weekend interview, Cortines _ who will formally take
over as interim superintendent when Ruben Zacarias retires Jan. 15
_ said he will ask everyone to get on board and seek out advice
from local elected officials and community leaders.
</P>
<P>
   And the message for those who can't or won't go along with his
can-do attitude is clear: get out of the way. &QL; 
``I will get in at 6 a.m., and when it gets rough, I'm sure I will
get up a little earlier,'' Cortines said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be looking for good people. The system needs to
look at the young people and the people that are mid-career. We
should use all of the talent that is here and send a message that
there is not a pecking order anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is no longer who you know. It is about capacity, ability
and talent.''
</P>
<P>
   With many high-level administrators up for retirement or
weighing their future, Cortines said will not ``put a guilt trip on
anyone or hold anyone hostage to their job.'' He promises to listen
to everyone, but ``people should do what is best for them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When they do what is best for them, they tend to do the right
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Cortines called off a trip to New York that he had scheduled for
this week after being tapped by the school board on Thursday to
advise Zacarias until his retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Until Zacarias' exit, he will be formally in charge of all the
district's departments, with Cortines serving as his ``adviser''
and Chief Operating Officer Howard Miller managing the district
facilities and business divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Come Jan. 16, one man is in charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a collaborator. I try to get everybody involved,''
Cortines said. ``We need to debate and discuss, but when it comes
to the end of the day, while everyone can make recommendations,
someone is going to say: `Cortines, what do you think?' I'm going
to give an answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Wasting no time, Cortines already has drawn up a lengthy
schedule for what he calls ``Week One.''
</P>
<P>
   He plans to sit down today with Zacarias and Deputy
Superintendent of Instruction Lilliam Castillo and talk about new
directions for educational programs. And he will huddle with
teachers union president Day Higuchi, local and state politicians
and high-ranking LAUSD administrators before Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Miller is penned in for 8:30 a.m. today so he and Cortines can
continue talking about the district's facility and school
construction needs. The two began talking about the district's
overcrowded classrooms last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He and I both agreed that there is no way to build all the
schools that we need to build in the next 10 years. I suggested
that he come up with a plan for some different ways to use
buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   The innovative steps may include purchasing and converting
commercial space into classrooms, renovating warehouses, and using
campuses for different grade levels. All of the strategies were
employed by Cortines during his stint as chancellor of New York
City's public schools in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need some of our high schools to be much smaller so we
don't lose kids though the cracks, can better deal with attendance
and drop-out rates, and develop a more personal kind of
relationship between staff, students and their families,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cortines and Miller are investigating the feasibility of
converting several large middle schools into high schools, and
using large elementary schools as middle schools.
</P>
<P>
   Such a move would allow the district to use nearly $1 billion it
hopes to receive in state funds to build a variety of smaller
campuses and convert existing structures rather than build scores
of giant high schools that hold up to 5,000 students each.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not enough land available, and we want to avoid the
dislocation of residents and others,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cortines plans to set up a variety of task forces to examine and
implement changes. Each will include parents, teachers,
administrators and experts in education.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to look at how do we raise the standard. We need to
take existing programs that are very good and that are working, and
say this needs to be the standard across the board. These changes
need to be about the people in the classroom and the people at this
district. This needs to make a statement about what they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Beginning today, Cortines will make unannounced visits to three
to four schools every week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to see it and I have to hear it and I have to
internalize what is going on so that I can make the best
recommendations for policy changes to the board or make the best
changes from a management standpoint on behalf of the kids.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Cortines plans to meet with Mayor Richard Riordan,
who helped elect a reform-minded majority to the school board
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   The role in school reform played by the mayor and his supporters
in the business community has become an issue in the Latino
community.
</P>
<P>
   But Cortines, who has faced many fierce political fights in his
43-year career, feels he can have a good working relationship with
Riordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the mayor should take a more active role. He's done
an outstanding job in creating a renaissance in Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   Cortines also said he believes he can develop a good
relationship with key Latino leaders, especially state Sen. Richard
Polanco, D-Los Angeles, a powerful force who has thrown his support
behind breaking up the district if he's not satisfied with the
direction LAUSD takes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to know who I am. And I need to know who they are,''
Cortines said. ``They need to know from me that I need their help
in improving their school system. I plan to keep them informed, so
they can ask questions and offer constructive criticism.''
</P>
<P>
   Cortines also plans to wade into the issue of the
environmentally troubled Belmont Learning Center _ the nation's
costliest high school, a $282 million project if completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cost of Belmont seems to be way out of line, not that you
can do anything about it now. But I need to understand why it
happened, so we can avoid something similar as we move ahead to
build other schools and procure property.''
</P>
<P>
   With an expanding list of environmental crises, including the
discovery of asbestos problems at several schools, Cortines said he
plans to hold all employees accountable if they fail to protect the
safety of children and staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are internal people within both our maintenance and
safety branches that don't talk to each other. That's not going to
be tolerated. If it's a safety or a health issue, somebody needs to
get everyone at the table and knock heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to allow anyone to play Pontius Pilate and stand
in the corner and wash their hands. If they touched it, they have
responsibility. You can't say I don't make decisions. If you don't
make decisions, you are going to be part of the budget cuts.'' &UR;

`BONE COLLECTOR' STEALS TOP SPOT AT BOX OFFICE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Suspense-seeking moviegoers mobbed multiplexes as ``The Bone
Collector'' dominated the nation's box office with an estimated
$17.2 million at 2,589 theaters during the Friday-Sunday period,
studio sources said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Collector,'' starring Denzel Washington as a paraplegic
detective tracking a serial killer, performed in line with
expectations and reflected the powerful recent market for thrillers
such as ``The Sixth Sense,'' ``The Blair Witch Project,'' ``The
Haunting,'' ``Stigmata'' and ``The House on Haunted Hill.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the right genre at the right time,'' noted veteran
industry tracker Arthur Rockwell. ``It's certainly not losing any
steam.''
</P>
<P>
   Universal mounted an extensive marketing campaign that paid off
by attracting 49 percent males and 51 percent females along with an
even split of customers under and over 25 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are absolutely pleased because it plays very well to all
audiences,'' said distribution chief Nikki Rocco.
</P>
<P>
   Audiences were attracted equally by the suspense genre and by
Washington, Rocco said. Reviews were mixed for ``Collector,'' which
also stars Angelina Jolie and was originally slotted for early
fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bone Collector'' kept business healthy during an otherwise
moderate weekend, with total receipts at about $78 million _ up 15
percent from the previous weekend, when Halloween held down
moviegoing, but down 38 percent from the same weekend last year
when ``The Waterboy'' opened with a stunning $39.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   The opening of ``The Bachelor,'' an update of the 1925 Buster
Keaton film ``Seven Chances,'' led the rest of the pack with $8
million at 2,522 theaters as its promotional campaign _
highlighting a scene where hundreds of women in wedding gowns are
chasing star Chris O'Donnell for a chance to inherit $120 million _
helped overcome mostly negative reviews. ``The marketing of `The
Bachelor' was one of the best this year,'' said Robert Bucksbaum,
president of the Reel Source tracking service. ``Middle America
wanted to see this film.''
</P>
<P>
   Finishing a close third was Warner Bros.' second weekend of
``The House on Haunted Hill'' with $7.8 million at 2,710 theaters
as last weekend's winner lost slightly more than half its audience
_ not surprising in light of the heavy tie-ins with Halloween and
this weekend's competition from ``The Bone Collector.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney's opening of ``The Insider,'' a recap of efforts by a
``60 Minutes'' producer and a tobacco industry executive to expose
the industry's inner workings, came in fourth with a lukewarm $7
million at 1,809 theaters despite strong reviews and the marquee
power of star Al Pacino.
</P>
<P>
   Distribution chief Chuck Viane said results were in line with
studio expectations, adding that the combination of strong viewer
recommendations and possible Academy Award nominations could turn
``The Insider'' into a solid long-term performer such as ``Scent of
a Woman'' and ``L.A. Confidential.'' ``It may take a long time for
`The Insider' to reach its potential,'' he added. Bucksbaum said
``The Insider'' may be one of the few fall films that will remain
in multiplexes as major holiday season releases _ ``Toy Story 2,''
``The World Is Not Enough,'' ``Sleepy Hollow,'' ``End of Days'' _
begin to dominate later this month. ``Most of the fall films will
disappear very quickly,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   But Rockwell said he was skeptical about prospects for ``The
Insider,'' adding, ``People may be tired of hearing about this
incident.''
</P>
<P>
   Holdover films took the six remaining Top 10 slots with each
posting solid business compared with Halloween weekend, which was
one of the slowest of the year. Paramount's seventh weekend of
``Double Jeopardy'' led the rest of the pack in fifth with $4.5
million at 2,722 theaters as the Ashley Judd vehicle reached $104.5
million and became the 15th movie this year and 198th of all time
to top $100 million in domestic grosses.
</P>
<P>
   Universal's third weekend of ``The Best Man'' continued its
solid performance in sixth with $4.3 million at 1,285 sites,
followed by DreamWorks' eighth weekend of ``American Beauty'' with
$3.3 million at 1,553 theaters and Disney's 14th weekend of ``The
Sixth Sense'' with $3.2 million at 1,802 sites. ``Sense,'' which
has topped $264 million, matched last weekend's total even though
it was playing in 249 fewer theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out the top 10 were Miramax's second weekend of ``Music
of the Heart'' with $3 million at 1,353 theaters and 20th Century
Fox's fourth weekend of ``Fight Club'' with $2.5 million at 1,607
sites. Battling for 11th with $2 million each were Paramount's
fifth weekend of ``Superstar'' and its third weekend of ``Bringing
Out the Dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Universal's fourth weekend of ``The Story of Us'' continued to
disappoint with $1.9 million at 2,010 theaters, giving the Bruce
Willis-Michelle Pfeiffer vehicle $25.3 million overall or less than
a tenth of what Willis' previous film, ``The Sixth Sense,'' took
in. USA's art-house hit ``Being John Malkovich'' came in 14th with
an impressive $1.85 million at 175 theaters in its second weekend.
</P>

   Virtual Ink, a Cambridge, Mass., startup, last month began

   Specialized whiteboards capable of saving scribbled meeting
notes and drawings in digital form have been available for years.
But except for some very small models, they cost well over $1,000
and are small and heavy, compared to their conventional cousins.
Most also require special proce- &LR;  &QL;

THE ELITE'S CHOICE WINS HUGE VICTORY IN MEXICO PRIMARY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for updating, rewriting throughout) (sw) 
 By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Franciso Labastida Ochoa, the candidate of the
establishment in Mexico's governing party, won a decisive victory
on Sunday in the party's first presidential primary election, rapid
vote counts and early official returns showed. But his main
opponent moved to open a battle over the results.
</P>
<P>
   In a televised address to the nation after the polls closed,
President Ernesto Zedillo said his party's first competitive
primary had been generally orderly and ``genuinely democratic,''
and would ``without a doubt strengthen the democracy of the nation
as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   With 27 percent of the votes counted, Labastida was winning 248
out of 300 electoral districts, while his chief rival, Roberto
Madrazo Pintado, was trailing far behind with only 22 districts.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida has a strong chance of winning the presidential
election next July 2 because opposition voters are divided between
two major parties that have failed to form a coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo campaign officials held a news conference right after
the polls closed at 6 p.m. to declare their candidate the winner.
Madrazo, the former governor of Tabasco state, has long experience
at fighting tenaciously when he is behind in a race, and he seemed
to be preparing for a confrontation with Labastida and party
authorities to challenge the outcome of the primary.
</P>
<P>
   The primary broke with seven decades of authoritarian tradition
in which the incumbent president hand-picked his successor in a
ritual known as the finger-tap. Despite the contention over the
results, the vote was regarded across the political spectrum as a
historic advance toward democracy in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo, who made the decision to abandon the old practice and
allow Mexican voters to choose his party's candidate, held up two
fingers after he cast his own ballot on Sunday morning. ``This
finger is a thing of the past,'' he said, waving the index finger
he opted not to use to tap the presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we have this one,'' Zedillo added, showing the indelible
black ink on his thumb that showed he had voted in the primary.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo revealed in his speech that to ensure his neutrality, he
had marked the names of all the candidates on the ballot, knowing
that it would invalidate his vote. Throughout the campaign he
insisted that he was not backing any of the four candidates. But
Labastida's rivals bitterly questioned the fairness of the race,
charging that the party establishment had thrown its power behind
the former Cabinet minister, believing him to have Zedillo's
support.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida, 57, served as Zedillo's interior minister, the
highest Ccabinet minister, and has had a steady 37-year career in
government posts. He promised gradual reforms to make the governing
Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI, less corrupt
and more democratic, and greater spending on social programs for
the working class if he becomes president.
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo, by contrast, presented himself as a rebel who would
make sweeping changes to break the hold of the Mexico City
political elite on the party. The PRI has won every presidential
race in Mexico since its founding in 1929, making it the world's
longest-ruling party. It has been weakened by spectacular
corruption and disastrous economic management by recent presidents.
</P>
<P>
   For the PRI, which achieved many of its past electoral victories
by sophisticated methods of fraud and coercion, mounting a clean
primary was a special challenge. The party spent $3.3 million to
organize a vote almost as ambitious as a presidential election,
with 64,200 polling stations nationwide and more than 450,000
people involved as officials and poll watchers. Any Mexican
registered to vote was allowed to participate, whether a PRI member
or not.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Gutierrez Barrios, the veteran PRI politician in charge
of ensuring an honest primary, said fraud was ``almost
impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Also running were Manuel Bartlett Diaz, 63, a former governor of
Puebla state, and Humberto Roque Villanueva, 55, a former president
of the party. They were expected to draw small percentages.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   According to two surveys of voters by TV Azteca and Televisa,
the two major television networks, voters in Mexico City strongly
favored Jesus Silva Herzog, a former ambassador to the United
States, to be the PRI candidate for mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Party members savored their first chance to have a real say in
picking the candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not imposing leaders anymore,'' said Pedro Corro
Garcia, a 23-year-old engineering student whose family included
several generations of PRI followers. ``They are letting us
decide.''
</P>
<P>
   PRI elections officials said the voting was orderly in most
places, but they reported some ``marginal incidents'' of
irregularities. In a rural village in Puebla, Bartlett's home
state, ballots for four polling stations were burned, apparently by
opponents of the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   In the Mexico City suburb of Villa Coapa, predawn raiders, also
apparently from opposition groups, stole all of the ballots from
one polling station, PRI officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But complaints flowed in from Madrazo followers around the
country that PRI officials had dispensed handouts of food and
promises of government aid, and in some cases resorted to overt
threats, to get PRI followers to turn out and vote for Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   In one town in the state of Queretaro, the PRI mayor threatened
to fire six employees who planned to turn out as poll watchers for
Madrazo, according to Jacaranda Pineda Chavez, a state deputy who
supports Madrazo. Only one stayed home on Sunday, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In San Andres Tuxtla, a town in the Gulf Coast state of
Veracruz, an official in charge of a federal aid program for the
lowest-income families warned that they might lose their assistance
if they failed to support Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see where their fanaticism for Labastida has taken them,''
Carmen Sanchez Llano, 30, a dentist who supports Madrazo, said by
telephone from the town.
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo gave no sign that he would give up easily and seemed to
be preparing to try to prove to PRI elections authorities that he
had won and, failing that, to assail the election with dozens of
formal complaints.
</P>
<P>
   During the day, Madrazo's campaign violated PRI bylaws by
sending e-mail messages with results of impromptu polls showing him
in the lead. Right after the polls closed in Mexico City, he sent
out a bulletin announcing that he had won 139 districts while
Labastida had won only 69.
</P>
<P>
   In a message directed at Madrazo without mentioning him by name,
Zedillo called on the losing candidates to ``accept the results
with the same democratic conviction with which they participated in
the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo campaign officials said there was little chance that he
or his followers would leave the party even if he suffered a
conclusive defeat. Instead, Madrazo seemed to be paving the way for
a tough negotiation with Labastida for positions of power within
the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should we leave a party that is just as much ours as
theirs?'' said Jose Alberto Aguilar, an adviser to Madrazo.
