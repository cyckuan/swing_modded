<HEADLINE> Provocative Press Reports Warned in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Iranian conservative judicial
officials on Monday warned the country's press, individuals and
groups against publishing any "provocative articles and
statements."
</P>
<P>
At a judicial meeting, the judiciary chief Ayatollah Mohammad
Yazdi said that "such seditious acts, no matter on whose part they
are, will be encountered legally and strictly."
</P>
<P>
The warning came amid a wave of accusations against the
pro-moderate press for provoking and intensifying the recent
unrest triggered by student protests against restrictions on the
press.
</P>
<P>
Yazdi said that the Iranian judiciary will independently and
decisively fulfill its duty in confrontation with any lawlessness,
disturbance of public order and violation of the citizens' rights.
</P>
<P>
"Under no circumstances will we allow insecurity or assault on
the principles of the system or achievements of the Islamic
revolution," he warned, assuring that the offenders will be
punished.
</P>
<P>
Yazdi also thanked the Iranian people for their massive turnout
on Wednesday in support of the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei to suppress the recent week-long student protests, which
turned into a social and political turmoil in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Intelligence Ministry said that some agents
affiliated to exiled Iranian opposition groups have been behind
the recent unrest.
</P>
<P>
Manouchehr Mohammadi, arrested as a mastermind behind the
unrest, confessed Monday evening on the state-run television
that he had traveled abroad and gained support from some Iranian
opposition groups in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has vowed to continue its investigation into the
unrest and the police crackdown on student hostels, which
triggered the recent student protests and clashes between
students and the police.

<HEADLINE> Britain Welcomes Moves to Solving Kashmir Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Britain on Monday welcomed Pakistan
and India's steps towards resolving their conflict in the disputed
Kashmir region and urged the two countries to overcome their
differences.
</P>
<P>
"I welcome the progress towards a resolution of the crisis,"
Prime Minister Tony Blair said in a statement which was issued
after the fighting in Kashmir ended at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
"The recent fighting underlines the need for Pakistan and India
to work together to resolve their outstanding differences,
including over Kashmir," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The fighting in Kashmir came to an end after hundreds of
infiltrators retreated from Indian-held territory. India accused
that the the invaders were a mix of Pakistani troops and Moslem
militants, while Pakistan says they were freedom fighters opposed
to Indian rule.
</P>
<P>
Blair praised Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif for taking
"early action" after a July 4 meeting with U.S. President Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
He also commended India's "continuing restraint...in reacting
to this difficult situation".
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister said he hoped both sides would respect the
integrity of the ceasefire line running through Kashmir and that
they would swiftly resume a dialogue launched by their two prime
ministers earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Both India and Pakistan had been the colonies of Britain till
the end of Second World War.

Eastern tour.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure, Aznar signed with Syrian officials Monday

<HEADLINE> Cypriot President Calls for Solution to Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides
Monday stressed that the aim of the U.N. initiative on Cyprus
should be the achievement of a bizonal, bicommunal federation.
</P>
<P>
In a message on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the
1974 coup and the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, the President noted
that the Greek Cypriot side shall not accept any deviation from
the parameters of the relevant U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared in 1983 a breakaway
"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" recognized only by Ankara.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the island
through a bizonal, bicommunal federation formula, but so far no
tangible results have been achieved.
</P>
<P>
In his message, Clerides emphasised that until a solution is
found, the Cyprus government will pursue its policy of
strengthening the island's armaments.
</P>
<P>
The President said Cyprus and both Greek Cypriots and Turkish
Cypriots still suffer from the "terrible consequences of the
criminal coup" and "the illegal and brutal Turkish invasion of the
island."
</P>
<P>
Clerides said since the invasion, all governments of Cyprus
have "shown good will and have even made paiful concessions"
in U.N. efforts to find a settlement.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, he added, "the Turkish leadership was always
intransigent" and its policy was always to secure recognition
of the illegal regime.
</P>
<P>
He called on the international community to put an end to
the unacceptable tactics of the Turkish side "if they really
wish for a compromise solution to be found."

<HEADLINE> Nigerian President Pays Brief Visit to Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo Monday paid a half-day visit to Angola at the invitation
of Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos.
</P>
<P>
This is Obasanjo's first official trip to Angola since his
inauguration on May 29 this year.
</P>
<P>
He visited Luanda in 1979 as Nigeria's military ruler.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo told reporters nothing when he left for home Monday
afternoon and the two governments did not issue any press release.
</P>
<P>
According to Angola News Agency (ANGOP) report, the two
presidents held private talks at the State House while the
accompanying Nigerian officials including Foreign Minister Alaha
Lamidou also contacted their Angolan counterparts.
</P>
<P>
The talks focused on the cooperative bilateral relations,
especially in economy, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have agreed to hold a meeting of the mixed
committee by the end of this year, it added.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that the civil war must have been one of the
majors issue of their talks.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo has said that he would exert his efforts to help bring
peace to the war-torn southern African country.
</P>
<P>
Dos Santos, who was busy with domestic affairs, did not attend
the inauguration ceremony of Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
But the Angolan government has said again and again that the
re- establishment of democracy in the most populous African
country is favorable for the stability of the the whole continent.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Renews Call for Lifting Sanctions on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General Esmat
Abdel-Meguid renewed on Monday his call for lifting the crippling
international economic sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at the Cairo-based Arab League
headquarters, Abdel-Meguid said he made the call in light of
Iraq's announcement of its compliance with the relevant United
Nations Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
He said Arab countries are ready to make all efforts to help
get the economic sanctions lifted to ease the sufferings of the
Iraqi people. An Arab committee has been formed to seek ways in
this regard.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council imposed the embargo on Iraq after its
1990 invasion of Kuwait, barring export of Iraqi oil, its main
revenue earner. The embargo will not be lifted until the
U.N. Special Commission, or UNSCOM, certifies that Iraq has
destroyed all its weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
But Iraq stopped its cooperation with UNSCOM in charge of
overseeing the elimination of its banned weapons last December
after the United States and Britain launched four days of
airstrikes against it.
</P>
<P>
The chief of the pan-Arab forum underlined the necessity for
respecting Iraq's sovereignty, territorial integrity and
non-interference in its domestic affairs.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid was referring to the continued attacks on Iraq's
military and civilian targets by warplanes of the U.S. and Britain
patroling two no-fly zones in the country since December.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led Western allies set up the two no-fly zones in the
south and north of Iraq after the 1991 Gulf War allegely to
protect the Shiite Muslims and ethnic Kurdish minorities. Iraq
announced not to recognize the no-fly zones after the December
attack.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Government Urged to Retaliate Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The Foreign Relations Commission of
the Iranian Majlis (parliament) on Monday urged the Foreign
Ministry to adopt "retaliatory policies against Turkey" for the
Turkish air raid on Iranian villages Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Turkish warplanes bombed several Iranian villages bordering
Iraq on Sunday, killing five people and injuring 10 others. So far
Turkey has denied launching the assault.
</P>
<P>
The commission condemned in a statement the "unjustifiable"
Turkish attack as well as the remarks by Turkish Prime Minister
Bulent Ecevit over the recent unrest in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit said last Tuesday that the recent unrest in Iran,
triggered by protests against the police assault on university
students on July 8, was the result of an "oppressive and outdated"
Islamic regime and the Iranian people could not be expected to
endure it for a long period.
</P>
<P>
The commission termed the recent stance of the Turkish
government towards the domestic developments in Iran as a token
of hostility of Turkish statesmen to Iran.
</P>
<P>
It also expressed hope that Turkey will make formal apologies
to Iran and prevent the recurrence of such incidents.
</P>
<P>
The commission said the Iranian army and border guards will
retaliate any fresh aggression.

<HEADLINE> Woman Entrepreneur Named HP New CEO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 19 (Xinhua) -- A woman entrepreneur was named
Monday president and chief executive officer of Silicon Valley's
largest and America's 16th largest corporation, Hewlett-Packard.
</P>
<P>
Carly Fiorina, 44, president of Lucent Technologies' Global
Service Provider Business, will succeed Lewis Platt, who
previously announced his intention to retire.
</P>
<P>
For the first time since its founding in 1938, HP, with roughly
40 billion U.S. dollars in annual revenue, recruited an outsider
to take its helm.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years, HP's profits fell and its stock hit a
plateau. As Platt announced in March he would depart HP next year,
the leading computer maker had been embarked on massive,
months-long manhunts, searching for prospects with strong
management experience and the drive to transform a company for a
new millennium. Only recently Platt said the search for his
successor would include outsiders.
</P>
<P>
Recently named by Fortune as the most powerful woman in
American business, Fiorina has nearly 20 years of broad technology
and telecommunications experience at Lucent and AT&AMP;T. She manages
Lucent's largest and fastest-growing division, with more than 20
billion dollars in annual revenue.
</P>
<P>
HP said earlier this year that it planned to split its
measurement businesses from its core computer and imaging
operations. The move will create a computer and imaging company
with some 40 billion dollars in annual revenue, and a smaller
company including testing and measuring, components, chemical
analysis and medical components with about 7 billion dollars in
revenue.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Army Ready for Further Redeployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Israeli army on Monday started
preparation works for the construction of a new base near the West
Bank city of Jenin, as part of the preparations for a further
Israeli redeployment from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The new base, located next to Shaked, a settlement northwest of
Jenin, will substitute a base closer to areas controlled by the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
Monday's activities were mostly restricted to taking
measurements, and actual groundwork will only start on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Serious construction is not yet scheduled on the base, but
this small step will be the first encouraging sign of movement the
Palestinians will have seen since Israel's May elections.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has promised that he would
implement the Wye agreement signed between Israel and the PNA last
October and continue the Israeli troops' withdrawal from the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
Further redeployment of Israeli troops was suspended at the end
of last year by former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after
Israeli troops finished the first stage of the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Preparations for relocation of army bases, which were supposed
to be implemented in January of this year, were also halted.
</P>
<P>
Barak reportedly would carry out the second phase of withdrawal
under the Wye agreement within weeks. But he also proposed to
combine the third withdrawal with the final status talks.
</P>
<P>
The PNA has insisted that Israel should fully implement the Wye
agreement before the final status talks.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Speaker Vows Not to Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The embattled Speaker of the House
of Representatives, Alhaji Ibrahim Buhari, has vowed not to resign
as he filed a suit in Lagos against The News magazine.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held here Monday, the speaker said that
"I will never step aside or be cajoled into resigning my election
as the speaker of the House of Representatives."
</P>
<P>
The Lagos-based magazine alleged in its July 11 edition that
the speaker falsified his age in order to qualify for election
into the House and lied about his qualification including his
claim in being alumnus of the University of Toronto in Canada.
</P>
<P>
In his first media reaction to the allegations, Buhari said
that he would not bow to "unwarranted media intimidation" to
vacate his seat.
</P>
<P>
Branding the allegations "false, malicious and calculated to
destroy my political career", the speaker stated that he had
resorted to the court as a "law abiding citizen".
</P>
<P>
The speaker's response came just as eight members of the House
demanded he resign and pursue his legal battle against the
magazine.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, they said "our constitutions have instructed us
to demand the immediate resignation of the speaker to enable him
to deal with his private legal problem."
</P>
<P>
They noted that the allegations had "seriously compromised his
capacity to pilot the affairs of the 360-member House" which has
been engaged in soul searching since its formation.
</P>
<P>
The umbrella union of the country's 27 labor unions also
reacted to the allegations, asking the speaker to render
"unreserved apology for the embarrassment he had caused the
nation".
</P>
<P>
"Rather than produce incontrovertible evidence to substantiate
his refutal of the scandalous allegations, the speaker resorted to
civil litigation that has the capacity to prolong the crisis,"
president of the union, Adams Oshiomole said.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese Government Urges Rebels to Accept All-out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese Foreign Minister Mustafa
Othman Ismail Monday called on the rebel Sudanese People's
Liberation Army (SPLA) to accept an all-out ceasefire to end the
years-old civil war.
</P>
<P>
He made the press statement after the SPLA declared a ceasefire
in 70 percent of the south Sudanese areas except the East
Equatorial, the southernmost province bordering Uganda.
</P>
<P>
According to Mustafa, it means that the movement is still
preparing for an attack from the Ugandan territories against Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese foreign minister, who heads the government
negotiating delegation in the peace talks with the rebels, urged
the international community to bring pressures on the SPLA and
force it to accept an all-out ceasefire and give access to the
relief missions in the south.
</P>
<P>
He also asked the SPLA to hand over the bodies of the four Sudanese
relief workers who were murdered in March by the rebel movement
while working with the International Association of the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the first session of the peace talks between the
representatives of the Sudanese government and the rebels was held
in Nairobi on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The government delegation hoped for discussing the ceasefire
and other thorny issues, Mustafa added.
</P>
<P>
However, in a press conference on Monday the SPLA chief negotiator
Silvakir stressed opposition to an all-out ceasefire and linked the
issue to the resolution of all disputable points.
</P>
<P>
Silvakir declared a three-month truce as of Monday covering
north and west the Gazal River and middle and upper Nile provinces.

<HEADLINE> Leading Software Producer Introduces End-to-End Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW ORLEANS, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Computer Associates
International (CA), leading software producer in the world, Monday
announced a broad-based solution that supports customers'
e-business initiative with the industry's most comprehensive
portfolio seamlessly bundles security functions that are essential
to delivering trusted e-business solutions.
</P>
<P>
The solution allows customers to get to market more rapidly and
reduce development costs without compromising transition integrity.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came as CA's week-long annual meeting entered
its second day, which attracts more than 25,000 computer science
professionals all over the world.
</P>
<P>
E-trust addresses the challenges of buyers and sellers in an
e-business relationship. Buyers with assurances that their
transition will be honored and private. Sellers want assurances
that they have resource.
</P>
<P>
Both parties want to work within an auditable, policy-based
business model that is effectively protected from viruses,
malicious code, cyber-criminals and other threats.
</P>
<P>
"Security is the essential ingredient for every virtual
business relationship," said CA Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer Charles B. Wang. "As e-business exponentially, CA's
e-Trust is designed to facilitate security and trust by delivering
some of today's most powerful integrated security, trust and
privacy services and solutions."
</P>
<P>
The e-Trust portfolio of tools and solutions includes trust
certificates, encryption controls, antivirus mechanisms, malicious
code prevention, denial-of-service counter-measures, intrusion
detection, firewar facilities, policy compliance and comprehensive
auditing capabilities.
</P>
<P>
E-trust includes a trust certificate solution that confirms the
identity of the trading parties in any e-business transaction.
Through a powerful implementation of the On-line Certificate
Status Protocol (OCSP), e-trust enables any company to conduct
trusted business-to-business e-commerce with any other member that
is also a member of the trust network, the global banking
industry's foremost trust infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone wants the Internet to be a secure, 'well-lit' place
in which to do business," Wang said. "An essential pre-requisite
is to have in place a highly reliable and trusted security
solution that deals with issues such as identification,
authentication, privacy, fraud control -- as well as the more
traditional aspects of authorisation, administration and
auditing."
</P>
<P>
Wang, one of the overseas Chinese in the United States, is CA's
chairman and chief executive officer, the world leader in
mission-critical business software.
</P>
<P>
With revenue of 5.3 billion U.S. dollars in fiscal year 1999,
CA employs more than 14,000 people in 100 countries around the
world.
</P>
<P>
Wang founded CA in 1976, launching the company with three
associates, a single product and a simple idea: that technology
must serve business. Today, CA software provides the computing
foundation for hundreds of thousands of businesses all over the
world.

Olasvirta whose country has assumed the European Union (EU)
presidency told reporters here Monday that it was not part of the
policy of Finland to discriminate against refugees because of
their regional domicile.
</P>
<P>
He said refugees in parts of Africa should not suffer because
of the prevailing situation in Kosovo but that they should get the
same level of attention from the donor community.
</P>
<P>
Olasvirta said he had acknowledge Chiluba's concern over the
token amount of 11 cents of U.S. dollar spent on an African
refugee while a colossal amount of 1.50 dollars was spent on each
refugee per day in Europe.
</P>
<P>
"This is a very difficult problem but I can assure you that it
is not the policy of my government or the European Union whose
presidency we have taken over, to make such differences in
payments," he said.
</P>
<P>
Olasvirta suggested that the United Nations High Commission
for Refugees (UNHCR) representative could shade more light on the
discrepancies.
</P>
<P>
"After Chiluba made his concern known, we also got in touch
with our director of refugees in Finland on the same (issue)," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Finnish government has said it will focus its
relations with Africa during its presidency of the European Union
on the preparation for the EU-Africa summit planned to take place
in early 2000.

<HEADLINE> Bonn Says Scharping Won't Be Next NATO Secretary-General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN July 19 (Xinhua)--German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
Monday insisted that his Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping would
not go Brussels to succeed the outgoing NATO secretary-general
Javier Solana.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder stressed his stand in his Bonn chancellory that he
preferred Scharping to stay in German cabinet, saying: "For us the
situation has not yet changed."
</P>
<P>
German Defense Ministry echoed Schroeder's statement on the
same day. A spokesman for the Ministry said that Scharping himself
did not wish to leave Bonn as next NATO chief.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Schroeder told reporters Scharping was not willing
to run for the post in Brussels. "If he were willing to, I would
support him." said Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
Scharping, also deputy chairman of Schroeder's ruling Social
Democratic Party (SPD), was reportedly the hottest candidate to
take over the post from Solana, who is due to assume office this
autumn as European Union's mediator for common foreign and
security policy.
</P>
<P>
The United States thought Scharping had done " a good job"
during the past Kosovo conflicts, and looked him as the most
preferrable candidate for NATO's civilian head, said today's
"Berliner Tagszeitung" newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Other candidates, such as the outgoing chairman of British
Liberal Democrats, Paddy Ashdown, was regarded " politically not
weight enough" by Washington and other NATO members, the newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
But both Schroeder and Scharping repeatedly ruled out such
speculations in recent days. Scharping said last week that he
would stay in Bonn to advocate for German forces' budget and
modernization.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Demands Minimum Wage for Thai Workers in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The Thai ambassador to Israel
said on Monday that his government will freeze the flow of Thai
workers to Israel unless the workers be paid at least the minimum
wage.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador, Domedeg Bunnag, told Israel Radio that the
Israeli employers should pay the Thai workers at least the minimum
wage of 20 U.S. dollars a day.
</P>
<P>
Bunnag said there are about 24,000 Thai workers in Israel and
many of them were underpaid.
</P>
<P>
He noted the embassy has informed Israeli employers that they
should pay each worker the minimum wage of 78 shekels (a little
less than 20 dollars) before September, otherwise the Thai
government would turn down their new applications for workers and
will advise the workers to sue for compensation.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador stressed that in addition to low pays, the
working and living conditions of the Thai workers in Israel are
poor and unsafe.
</P>
<P>
In response, the Israeli Labor Ministry said it is aware of the
problem and has sent inspectors to check the Thai workers'
conditions.
</P>
<P>
The ministry pledges to take steps to correct the situation.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Warships in Northern Cyprus to Mark 1974 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Six Turkish warships docked Monday
at the port in the Kyrenia town in northern Cyprus to mark on July
20 the 25th anniversary of the 1974 war which separated the
Mediterranean island, the Cyprus News Agency (CNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared in 1983 a breakaway
"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus," recognized only by Ankara.
</P>
<P>
According to the Turkish Cypriot press, the warships will sail
back to Turkey on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit, who ordered Turkish
troops into Cyprus in 1974 also as the prime minister, is expected
to pay a one-day visit to the Turkish Cypriot area to mark the
anniversary of the 1974 war.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit was quoted as saying on Sunday that it would be
"impossible" for Turkey to make any concessions on Cyprus if
there is "no Turkish state" on the island.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot side refuses to attend any negotiations on
a Cyprus settlement unless their self-styled "Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus" is recognized.

<HEADLINE> Iran Has No Plan to Unify Foreign Exchange Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Governor General of the Central
Bank of Iran (CBI) Mohsen Nourbakhsh announced on Monday that Iran
has no plan so far to unify multiple foreign exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Nourbakhsh said that reduction in number
of the foreign exchange rates is one of the CBI goals and the
government's economic rehabilitation program is being implemented
with this in mind.
</P>
<P>
He said that the country's foreign exchange policies will be
outlined in the third five-year development plan (2000-2005),
the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Nourbakhsh said that there are three different official rates
for foreign exchanges in the country.
</P>
<P>
He said that the CBI is planning to set-up a foreign exchange
market in the stock exchange which will be initiated in the second
half of this Iranian year (started March 21) to help ease
exports-import activities. However, he gave no details on the
planned market.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the black market in the country, the CBI chief
said that foreign exchange rate on the black market has had a
declining trend in the past few days and it is expected to remain
so in next few days.
</P>
<P>
He said that the foreign exchange price depends on three
elements of demand-supply, psychological factors and general
economic condition of the country.
</P>
<P>
The CBI has no tools to control the black market, but can only
meet portion of hard currency demands such as hard currency for
travelers, the official said, while putting the black market
transactions at about 3 billion U.S. dollars annually.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Benefit from Asian-Africa Promotion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe is to benefit from the
Asian-Africa investment and technology promotion center which was
launched in Austrian capital Vienna Monday, the Zimbabwe News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO)
said in a statement that a similar center would be established in
Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, for coordinating partnerships between Asia
and seven African countries.
</P>
<P>
African countries that would initially take part in the
centre's program are Zimbabwe, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Mozambique,
Senegal, Tanzania and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The center's initial focus would include the development of
Africa's agro-industries, particularly food processing and
textiles.
</P>
<P>
The African continent relied heavily on imported technologies
while lacking the capabilities to adapt them to changing trends in
production and demand, said the UNIDO.
</P>
<P>
"Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for less than three percent of the
world value added in agro-industrial production," it said.
</P>
<P>
"To bridge the gap, the center is adopting a four-pronged
strategy by promoting capacity building, access to business
information, completion of partnership arrangements through
technical expertise and provision of finance and mobilization of
financial resources for new promotion activities," said the
Vienna-based organization.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government had committed one million U.S. dollars
for the program during next 24 months.

ANKARA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman Demirel
said here on Monday that the world must recognize the "Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus" as a state.
</P>
<P>
Demirel made the remarks when receiving Turkish Cypriot
"Ambassador" to Ankara Nazif Berman on the eve of the 25
anniversary of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus on July 20, 1974.
</P>
<P>
"It is impossible to continue to consider that there were one
state and one citizenship on the island," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish leader noted that his country "is very sensitive
concerning the Cyprus question," adding it will not give
concessions "on the rights that were gained with great self
sacrifices."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-dominated
south, which is internationally recognized, and the Turkish
Cypriots-controlled north since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded
and occupied the northern third of the island in the wake of a
failed coup seeking union with Greece.

In 1983, Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas declared the
breakaway "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus," which is now
recognized only by Turkey.
</P>

The United Nations has been trying for decades to reunite the
island through a bi-communal federation formula, but the talks
between the two sides have made no substantive progress so
far.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Accuses Sudan of Continuing to Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Ambassador of the United States in
Cairo Daniel Kurtzer on Monday accused Sudan of continuing to support
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a meeting with Egyptian Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa, Kurtzer said Sudan "still shelters and
supports terrorists," Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Any improvement of the U.S.-Sudanese relations depends on
Khartoum's end to supporting terrorism, the U.S. diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
Washington has imposed sanctions on Sudan, barring most
bilateral trade and prohibit U.S. investment in the country. It
has also frozen Sudanese government assets in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. withdrew its diplomats from Sudan in 1996 because of
concern for their safety. The next year, Washington tightened
sanctions against Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Sudan has denied the U.S. accusation.
</P>
<P>
Kurtzer said he briefed Moussa on the mission of a special
envoy for humanitarian conditions in southern Sudan. U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said last week that
President Bill Clinton would appoint such an envoy.
</P>
<P>
Kurtzer said the envoy would coordinate his work with Egypt and
the parties trying to broker peace in Sudan under the umbrella of
the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development, or IGAD.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government and the rebel Sudan People's Liberation
Army have held several rounds of talks on ending the civil war. The
two sides resumed negotiations in Nairobi, Kenya on Monday. The
talks were arranged and chaired by IGAD, which comprise Djibouti,
Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The southern rebels have been fighting for autonomy from
Khartoum's Muslim-dominated government since 1983. About 1.9
million people have been killed in the fighting or died of
famines.

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Unionist Attacks Ahern over Decommissioning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 19 (Xinhua) -- A top Protestant politician in
Northern Ireland attacked Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern on
Monday for saying that IRA guerrillas might not meet a May 2000
disarmament deadline.
</P>
<P>
Senior parliamentarian Ken Maginnis of the Ulster Unionist
Party (UUP) said Ahern's statement could deal a fatal blow to
Northern Ireland's stricken peace accord and that further UUP
talks with him could be in doubt if he did not clarify his
comments, according to a Reuters report filed from Belfast.
</P>
<P>
"It will be exceedingly difficult in the light of this
statement for unionists to resume where we left off talks with the
Taoiseach (prime minister) unless there is some clarification,"
Maginnis, who is the UUP's spokesman on security affairs in
volatile British-ruled province, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"If anything risks fatally damaging the Good Friday agreement,
I think it is this particular statement," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ahern, who was due later on Monday to meet Gerry Adams, head of
the Irish Republican Army's Sinn Fein political arm, said on
Sunday he believed the IRA would want more time to disarm after
the future of the accord was thrown into doubt last week.
</P>
<P>
Ahern and his British counterpart Tony Blair will have crucial
talks in London on Tuesday with former U.S. senator George
Mitchell, who brokered last year's watershed accord.
</P>
<P>
Blair and Ahern, exasperated by the failure of a pact that they
had championed and the rival parties had signed up to, are to
launch a review of its trouble-laden operations so far. Political
sources say it could be early September before the review is
completed.

<HEADLINE> Iran Carries out Unmanned Aircraft Air Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Monday carried out an air
show of tens of unmanned aircraft (drone) manufactured by the
Defense Ministry to show its capabilities in aviation industries.
</P>
<P>
The successful flights of tens of unmanned planes marked Iran's
technological and industrial capabilities, the Islamic Republic
News Agency (IRNA) reported. But the report gave no details about
the air show.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to IRNA, Managing Director of the Aviation Industries
Organization of the Iranian Armed Forces Hassan Tavallayee said
taking into account foreign sanctions, Iran by relying on domestic
manpower and expertise have designed and manufactured different
types of unmanned planes.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft are able to fly with a radius of 1,500 kilometers
and at an altitude of 11,000 feet, Tavallayee said, adding that
the planes are invisible and able to carry out surveillance
missions and send back pictures to the stations on the ground.
</P>
<P>
He said that the drones are equipped with advanced computer
system enabling them to identify memory-saved flight route and
carry out full automatic operation in silence.
</P>
<P>
Air photography, electronic warfare, telecommunications
watching, targeting, traffic control, surveillance of border
strips to combat smugglers and meteorological studies are among
other functions of these airplanes, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Tavallayee said the Saeqeh (Thunder) 1 and Saeqeh 2 unmanned
aircraft are ready for mass production and the planes are being
used as targets in air defense training.
</P>
<P>
The light aerodynamic plane can fly as fast as 300 kilometers
per hour, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The High Court of Zimbabwean
capital Harare Monday started the trial of three Americans
arrested in March this year for unlawful possession of arms and
trying to take them aboard an aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Musakwa of the Attorney General's Office said that Garry
 Blanchfield (35), Joseph Petijohn (34) and John Dixon (35) were
found in possession of arms of war on March 7 at the Harare
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
The arms, which included 21 rifles, 22 pistols, 31 bayonets, 13
 binoculars, 70 assorted knives and three electronic shock devices
were exhibited in the court.
</P>
<P>
Musakwa said this was in contravention of the Aircraft Act and
the Law and Order Maintenance Act of Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
But the three pleaded not guilty. The case continues Tuesday
before Justice Mohamed Adam.
</P>
<P>
Defense advocate Chris Anderson said the accused had told him
that they needed the weapons for hunting and had brought them from
the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
He maintained that the three were missionaries from a
registered Christian group in the United States.
</P>
<P>
He added that none of the accused had every undertaken military
training and some of the knives discovered on them were a private
collection for Jonathan Wallace, leader of their church.

<HEADLINE> Online Retailing Revenues Surge in North America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Online retailing in North
America is expected to top 36 billion U.S. dollars by the end of
the year and a projected growth of 145 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
According to a report released Monday by the Boston Consulting
Group, a general management consulting firm, total 1998 online
revenues across all categories reached almost 15 billion dollars,
presenting 0.5 percent of all retail sales in North America.
Online orders in 1998 were up 200 percent and the number of online
shoppers was up 300 percent.
</P>
<P>
The consulting firm based its study on a detailed survey of 158
online retailers. The top 50 retailing sites accounted for almost
75 percent of the market in 1998, and the top 10 sites accounted
for 43 percent of the revenues.
</P>
<P>
The cost of acquiring customers remains high. Web sites are
spending, in general, between 22 and 42 dollars to get one
customer to make a purchase, the study said. But in addition to
Internet traffic increases, there is also lots of room for growth
in the supplemental revenue Web sites can earn. Such supplemental
revenues include the sales of advertising space on sites,
permission-based direct marketing and membership. And research
fees are an untapped source of revenue for most online retailers,
accounting only five percent of overall revenues, according to the
study.
</P>
<P>
"Most people think e-commerce is mainly being done by Web-only
businesses," the report said, but 62 percent of the online
revenues in 1998 were from retailers who had businesses that
predated the Web. These catalog, call centers and brick-and-mortar
retailers are a growing force behind the continued rapid growth of
online retail.
</P>
<P>
Currently, pure-play retailers are dominant in the collectibles
(person-to-person auctions), books, music/video and automotive
categories. In categories such as financial brokerage, consumer
electronics, apparel and computers, the majority of sales are from
multichannel retailers.

ATHENS, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Four more Russian navy ships

This will be the last group of Russian ships which send troops

<HEADLINE> Dollar Buying Renders S. African Rand Weaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Dollar buying pushed the
South African rand to end the day weaker at 6.1530 per U.S. dollar
from a previous close of 6.1440.
</P>
<P>
Trading on the rand was a bit scrappy Monday with the local
currency leaping from a weaker opening level of 6.1600 to a firmer
level of 6.1420 at midday. However, late dollar buying saw the
rand edging to close lower once again the same day.
</P>
<P>
The dollar buying was largely due to players eyeing the gold
price.
</P>
<P>
Overall, the rand was steady, trading between 6.1420 on the
bottom side and 6.1560 on the top side, market sources said.
</P>
<P>
They said good two-way trading was seen between local and
offshore players, mostly from London.
</P>
<P>
Most players continued to eye the weaker gold price which
dipped to 252. 80 dollars per ounce during the session.
</P>
<P>
However, the gold price was last at 254.00 dollars from a
previous New York close of 253.65 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Market sources said most players will continue eyeing the gold
price until all pending gold sales by various central banks are
completed or aborted.
</P>
<P>
The UK Treasury auctioned 25 tons of gold two weeks ago and
intends auctioning about 390 more tons in the coming two years.
The Swiss National bank has also given notice that it will sell
about 1,300 tons.

<HEADLINE> Belgian Rider Dierckxsens Banned for Doping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Ludo Dierckxsens, winner of the Tour
de France 11th stage in St Etienne on Friday, has been excluded by
his team from the Tour for doping, the International Cycling Union
said in St Gaudens on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The 34-year-old Belgian Champion was excluded for confessing to
the UCI during a dope test that he was taking the banned drug
synacthene.
</P>
<P>
The UCI said, in a communique, that despite the fact that he
had a medical prescription for the drug, he was considered
positive.
</P>
<P>
It was the first doping case on the Tour this year following
the 1998 scandal which led to the exclusion of the Festina team.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Swiss Cycling Federation opened an
investigation into Lampre after a Swiss television program alleged
that it was in possession of banned substances discarded by the
team.
</P>
<P>
The program claimed one of its reporters watched a Lampre team
car stop at a waste bin during the Tour of Switzerland on and
dispose of a sack which the reporter said contained drugs and
syringes.

<HEADLINE> China Urges Warring Afghan Parties to End Conflicts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister
Yang Wenchang, speaking at a U.N.-sponsored talks on peace in
Afghanistan which opened in Tashkent, Uzbekistan Monday, urged the
two warring Afghan sides to eliminate their differences and end
the conflicts between them.
</P>
<P>
Afghanistan's warring factions opened the two days of peace
talks in the Uzbek capital for finding a way to end conflicts that
have raged in the country for more than 10 years.
</P>
<P>
In his address to the meeting, Yang expressed the hope that a
stable Afghan government will be formed in the country at an early
date.
</P>
<P>
The talks are being attended by senior officials from China,
Pakistan, Iran, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan -- the six
neighboring countries of Afghanistan -- plus the United States and
Russia, which are known as "the six-plus-two group."
</P>
<P>
Yang pointed out that as the conflicts in Afghanistan have
raged for more than 10 years, how to effectively promote the
Afghan peace process and end the civil war at an early date is a
need of the present time and also a common aspiration of the
people.
</P>
<P>
"The international community should endeavor to create a
constructive, good and generous external environment for settling
the Afghan issue," he said.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming the participants in the talks, Uzbek President Islam
Karimov also said, "Our most coveted and greatest desire is to see
a peaceful, stable and secure Afghanistan."
</P>
<P>
Opening the talks, a U.N. official read a statement from
Secretary-General Kofi Annan that expressed concerns about the
conflicts in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"Afghan people continue to suffer, shots are heard, and people
continue to die," said Lakhdar Brahimi, the U.N. special envoy to
Afghanistan, "We have gathered to put an end to this."
</P>
<P>
The Taliban group, which is in control of about 90 percent of
Afghanistan, are presently battling the northern-based opposition
alliance on several fronts.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Taliban and the opposition representatives will
meet directly to discuss issues related to the exchange of
prisoners of war and the lifting of blockades that have prevented
humanitarian aid deliveries to the country, according to news
reports reaching here.

<HEADLINE> WB Chief Urges Albania to Push Ahead Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- World Bank President James
Wolfensohn here on Monday urged the Albanian government to carry
out reforms in various sectors as a precondition for the bank to
extend its assistance to the country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference at Rogner Hotel here, Wolfensohn
indicated that he had met with Albanian leaders and other senior
officials, and he hoped that Albania can take action to reform its
governance structure, justice system and legal system.
</P>
<P>
Wolfensohn stressed that Albania should pay special attention
to its campaign against corruption.
</P>
<P>
He also urged Albania to attach importance to restructuring its
economic structure, in the realms of infrastructure,
communications, power, and water in short term, and in the realms
of education, health, and other social sectors in long term.
</P>
<P>
Albania has to do that, otherwise Albania is not competitive,
people will not invest in Albania, he said.
</P>
<P>

crucial moment for development after the Kosovo crisis ended. He
said that his visit to Albania this time is to show the bank's
support to the country because the country had played an important

<P>
"While the world is ready to give you support, and I think
Albania at the moment is on the frontpages," he said.

the next six or 12 months is very important," he noted, urging
Albania to catch this good moment to move.
</P>
<P>
"Other 12 months, some other countries will be on the
frontpages," he added.
</P>
<P>
Wolfensohn met with Albanian President Rexhep Mejdani on Monday
morning. Mejdani expressed his thanks for the World Bank's support
not only in recent times, but also during the past eight years
after Albania joined the institution.

on Sunday.The two sides signed agreements for three projects
financed by the World Bank involving 41 million U.S. dollars,
including a community works project, and a microcredit project.

<P>
Albania joined the bank in 1991. Since then, the total lending
by the bank to Albania includes 34 credits totalling 481.8
million, of which 267 million having been disbursed.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> UK Firms World's Most Acquisitive, Says KPMG </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON July 19 (Xinhua) - Britain has leapt to first place in
the league table of international investment, according to figures
published Monday by KPMG.
</P>
<P>
In the latest KPMG Corporate Finance survey, the researchers
said that "1999 looks set to beat easily" the year before, when
merger deals totalled a record 544bn US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The value of cross-border deals rose by almost 130 percent
between the first and second quarters of 1999, the figures reveal,
taking the value from 124bn US dollars to 285bn US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The UK returned to its position as the world's most acquisitive
nation, after heading the league table for the first time in 1998.
</P>
<P>
UK firms invested most heavily in the US. Deals totalling 80bn
US dollars amounted to half the UK's purchases, said Stephen
Barrett, head of M&AMP;A at KPMG.
</P>
<P>
Boosted by UK activity, European firms were behind two thirds of
all merger deals worldwide, buying companies worth 189bn US dollars

<HEADLINE> Britain to Withdraw More Forces From Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 19 (Xinhua) - Britain said on Monday it would
withdraw a large proportion of its armed forces from Kosovo over
the next three months as security in the province improves.
</P>
<P>
Defence Secretary George Robertson told parliament that between
August and October Britain would bring home three army units, a
local report said.
</P>
<P>
That action would reduce the British presence in Kosovo from
10,000 to 7,000 people.
</P>
<P>
"These withdrawals...along with withdrawals of units of the
Royal Air Force and Royal Navy announced last month will go a long
way to help relieve the overstretch in the armed forces,"
Robertson said, sounding to acknowledge that the services had been
stretched close to the limit.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Labour government, which used to be the most hawkish
in the NATO countries during the bombing against Yugoslavia, has
consistently said its armed forces could cope with its commitments
in Kosovo and Bosnia and not neglect others elsewhere in the
world.
</P>
<P>
Robertson said further withdrawals of British forces would "of
course follow."

Iran's accusation that Turkish warplanes had bombarded villages

<P>
The Iranian ambassador to Ankara was summoned to the Turkish

In Tehran, Turkish Charge d'Affaires Aykut Sezgin was summoned

Azerbaijan province bordering southeastern Turkey, where rebels of

<P>
In the past, the PKK had used Iranian territory as a transit
route. In recent months, however, Turkish intelligence reported

<HEADLINE> Sudanese Rebels Extend Cease-fire as Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The long-delayed fourth round of
peace talks intended to end a civil war opened in Kenyan capital
Nairobi Monday with the rebels announcing a renewed cease-fire
immediately after the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) and the Sudan
People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) declared after the opening
session that it would extend "a humanitarian cease-fire for
further three months in southern provinces of Bahr-el-Ghazal,
western upper Nile and central upper Nile."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, spokesman for the SPLM, Samson Kwaje, appealed to
the international community to put pressure on the Sudanese
government to do the same.  There is no immediate comment from
Khartoum.
</P>
<P>
The talks are going on behind closed doors with the presence of
Sudanese Foreign Minister Mustafa Ismail and his 30-strong
delegation and deputy commander of the Sudan People's Liberation
Army Slava Kiir with a team of 25 rebel members.
</P>
<P>
However, the presence of relevant parties reaffirms the
commitment to the search for a solution to the war in southern
Sudan through the Inter- Governmental Authority on Development
(IGAD) framework, Kenyan Foreign Minister Bonaya Godana said in
his welcome speech.
</P>
<P>
"It was encouraging that the two parties in August 1998 agreed
to observe a three-month cease-fire which has been maintained to
date, to facilitate free flow of humanitarian assistance to the
victims of the conflict," Godana said.
</P>
<P>
The minister also expressed hope that progress on major issues
like a comprehensive cease-fire and question on the relationship
between state and religion will be made.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks, held under the auspices of the IGAD, will last
for five days.
</P>
<P>
Sudan's civil war has ravaged the southern part of Africa's
biggest country, killing more than 1.8 million people through war
and famine since 1983.
</P>
<P>
Historical, religious and cultural tensions between an Arab
north and a black and Christian south are root causes for the war
in southern Sudan.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Divers Sent to Find Wreckage of Young Kennedy's Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Divers plunged into the
Atlantic Monday and a high-tech vessel scoured the ocean floor for
the wreckage of the plane that carried John F. Kennedy, son of
former U.S. President John Kennedy, his wife and her sister.
</P>
<P>
The divers planned to search at least two locations pinpointed
by the Rude, a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
research vessel with side-scan sonar.
</P>
<P>
The plane piloted by Kennedy, 38, and carrying his wife,
Carolyn sessette Kennedy, 33, and her sister Lauren Bessette, 34,
was reported missing early Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Kennedy took off from New Jersey State Friday night on a trip
to his cousin Rory's wedding Saturday on Cape Cod in Massachusetts
State. The plane was to make a stop on Martha's Vineyard to drop
off Lauren Bessette before continuing to the Cape.
</P>
<P>
Ten state police divers in gray shirts and blue shorts boarded
two boats about Monday noon at Menemsha Harbor, on the west end of
Martha's Vineyard. A third vessel left carrying air tanks and dive
suits.
</P>
<P>
"We're on our way out," said state trooper Blake Gilmore, a
dive team leader. A couple of hours later, images from television
news helicopters showed some divers going into the water. Police
on Martha's Vineyard had no detail on what the divers were doing.
</P>
<P>
The search, which has covered almost 23,000 square kilometers,
produced no major finds Sunday but authorities were focusing on "a
couple of targets" identified by the Rude's sonar, Coast Guard
Rear Adm. Richard M. Larrabee said.
</P>
<P>
Late Sunday, the Coast Guard announced it was now conducting a
"search and recovery" mission, meaning the three on the plane were
presumed dead.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Imposes 116.8 Million in Sanctions in EU Beef Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton administration
announced Monday a final list of 116.8 million U.S. dollars in
food imports from the European Union (EU), on which it will impose
punitive tariffs in retaliation of EU's ban U.S. beef treated with
growth hormones.
</P>
<P>
The 100 percent tariffs, aimed at eliminating the European
products from American store shelves by doubling their price, will
go into effect July 29, the administration said.
</P>
<P>
The final list focuses heavily on European pork imports into
the United States but it also includes French mustard, truffles,
Roquefort cheese and fruit juices.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said they designed the list to inflict the most
economic damage on France, Germany, Italy and Denmark, believing
those nations hold the key to overturning the ban on American
beef.
</P>
<P>
The British food exports were omitted from the list because of
that nation's support for the U.S. position.
</P>
<P>
The administration took the action after receiving the go-ahead
last week from the World Trade Organization (WTO), which has ruled
that EU's ban on U.S. beef produced with growth hormones is not
justified by scientific evidence.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government earlier this year published a preliminary
target list of 900 million dollars in European items that could be
subjected to the tariffs but pared the final list to the 116.8
million dollar level. The WTO set that figure as the amount of
economic harm suffered annually by American beef producers because
of the European ban.
</P>
<P>
American cattle producers had put the economic costs of the
European ban, which has been in place for a decade, at 500 million
dollars annually.
</P>
<P>
The 100 percent tariffs on pork and gourmet foods mark the
second time this year that the Clinton administration has hashed
out at the EU for failing to abide by a WTO ruling in favor of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
The United States has already imposed 100 percent tariffs on a
separate group of 194.2 million dollars in European imports,
ranging from fancy handbags to bed linen, in a dispute involving
trade barriers imposed on American banana companies.
</P>
<P>
Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Peter Scher said in announcing
Monday's final list that the administration is still hoping the EU
will relent in both the beef and banana battles and abide by the
WTO rulings.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania, Uganda Ready to Sign EAC Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania and Uganda are
ready to sign the treaty to re-establish the East African
Community on July 30, but Kenya' s position has not been made
clear.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the Secretariat of the East African
Cooperation (EAC) in Arusha, north Tanzania, said Monday that all
have been set for the three presidents of Tanzania, Uganda and
Kenya to sign the treaty but some issues being raised by Kenya are
yet to be resolved.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that Tanzania and Uganda have taken the
position of accepting to sign the treaty to adopt the framework of
the would-be East African Community and negotiations on some key
protocols could continue.
</P>
<P>
However, Kenya, whose industries are more developed, is
pressing hard for the trade and industries protocols to be
included immediately.
</P>
<P>
"Kenya's instance on effecting the trade and industries
protocols raises the eyebrows of many and observers feel that they
(Kenyans) are up to something which will definitely be highly
detrimental to the two partners," the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that in light of the Kenya's position, there
is a likelihood that a tripartite commission of the EAC will be
convened toward the end of this week to resolve pending issues so
that the treaty is signed as planned.
</P>
<P>
The sources had earlier pointed out that the trade protocols in
the draft treaty favored Kenya more and the adoption of zero EAC
tariffs could cause huge revenue loss to Tanzania and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Minister for Industries and Commerce, Iddi Simba,
said that signing of the treaty is inevitable but trade
negotiations among the EAC members are to be put into force.
</P>
<P>
He said it would be disastrous on the Tanzanian industries if
the protocols of the treaty are to be put into force as they are.
</P>
<P>
"We have to put our house in order first," the minister said,
adding that the industries have to perform and produce commodities
which can compete in the local, regional and international
markets.
</P>
<P>
"This can be done by taking bold decisions on reviewing the tax
 structure, change of leadership attitude toward the private
sector and so on," he pointed out.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The widely anticipated moment
when the Earth's population hits 6 billion may already have
occurred.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Census Bureau's world population clock, which ticks
off the estimated world population increase, hit 6 billion over
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The clock reached the milestone at 8:24:02 p.m. EDT Sunday.
</P>
<P>
However, the Census Bureau cautions that "the populations
displayed on the clock are not intended to imply that the
population of the world is known to the last person."
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the Census Bureau's international programs center is
considering whether to revise its estimates to bring them closer
to those of the United Nations, which estimates the world will
reach 6 billion in October.
</P>
<P>
The global population reached 1 billion in 1804. It took 123
years to reach 2 billion in 1927 and only 33 years to reach 3
billion in 1960.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen years later it reached 4 billion in 1974, and 5
billion in a time-span of 13 years. It reaches 6 billion in
another 12 years.

LONDON, July 19 (Xinhua) -- European stock markets ended a
relatively quiet session Monday in mixed mood with London and
Paris closing in the red.
</P>
<P>
The UK's FTSE 100 closed over 1.2 percent lower at 6,483.7, a
fall of almost 80 points, after mortgage banks took a strong hit
from an announcement by the government that it will investigate
why the lenders have failed to pass on the last two interest rate
cuts in full.
</P>
<P>
Bank stocks, which had bolstered the leading index for much of
the session, slumped just before the close after the news broke.
Woolwich slumped 3.3 percent, while Abbey National lost 2.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
The UK's leading retail bank, Lloyds TSB, closed down almost
3.7 percent, while other mortgage lenders fared little better.
</P>
<P>
Oil stocks also were weak after big gains in recent weeks. BP
Amoco fell 1.8 percent, while Shell closed almost 2 percent lower.
</P>
<P>
Blue chip stocks in France failed to move ahead on the day as
dealing in heavyweights in the banking and oil sectors was
suspended for much of the session.
</P>
<P>
Investors treaded cautiously as they searched for clear
direction in the country's two big hostile takeover battles in the
oil and banking sectors. The CAC 40 lost 38 points, or 0.8
percent, to end at 4,618.75.
</P>
<P>
Shares in Germany ended trading virtually unchanged. The Dax
index of leading shares closed up a mere 4.80 points at 5,624,

January 2001."
</P>
<P>
For his part, Barak said he would consider, together with

The Yorubas alleged that a Hausa woman had offended the local
tradition by coming out Saturday night during a Yoruba "Oro"
festival.
</P>
<P>
The angry Oro adherents reportedly attacked the woman as she
was in violation of an age-old Yoruba belief that Oro must never
be seen by a woman, and then the Hausa community members
retaliated, resulting in the deaths and destruction of property.
</P>
<P>
Residents of the town said that the violence was unprecedented
in the town's history where the two groups have co-existed
peacefully for hundreds of years.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic clashes are frequent in the most populous African
country but those between Hausas and Yorubas have gained added
significance since the end of 15 years of Hausa-dominated military
rule on May 29 when Olusegun Obasanjo was sworn-in as a civilian
president.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Trade Deficit Surges to Another Record in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 20 (Xinhua) --U.S. trade deficit soared to
another record of 21.3 billion dollars in May as world oil prices
jumped to their highest level since late 1997, the Commerce
Department reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Department said that May deficit shot up a 14.8 percent
increase from the 18.6 billion dollars deficit in April.
</P>
<P>
U.S. imports of goods and services climbed 2.2 percent to a
record high of 98.9 billion dollars in May, reflecting higher oil
prices and a big jump in auto shipments.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. exports fell 0.8 percent to 77.6 billion
dollars as demand dropped sharply for commercial aircraft, farm
products and USA-made autos.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, the U.S. trade deficit is running at an
annual rate of 225 billion dollars, more than one-third higher
than last year's record high of 164.3 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
U.S. manufacturers and farmers have been battered by the world
financial turmoil, which forced U.S. companies to compete with a
flood of cheaper imports. Manufacturing sector has cut 488,000
jobs since March 1998 and farmers are suffering their worst
economic crisis in a decade.
</P>
<P>
However, the overall U.S. economy has continued to post robust
growth as consumer spending has remained strong.
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit in goods and service has set a record in four
of the last five months, reflecting the fact that a strong U.S.
economy has propelled demand for imports while U.S. companies and
farmers have seen their overseas sales shrink.
</P>
<P>
Prices of imported crude oil have rebounded in recent months,
sending U.S. oil bill sharply higher.
</P>
<P>
The price of crude oil jumped to 14.54 dollars a barrel in May,
up from 12.71 dollars in April and the highest price since
December 1997. Rising crude prices offset a smaller volume of
imported oil to boost the bill for foreign oil by 12.8 percent, to
5.3 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Imported autos and auto parts were up 6 percent in May to 14.5
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The decline in U.S. exports included a drop of 221 million
dollars in sales of commercial aircraft, a drop of 283 million
dollars in sales of consumer goods and a fall of 129 million
dollars in sales of U.S. autos.
</P>
<P>
Also, farm sales fell by 29 million dollars with exports of
meat, rice and corn all down.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. deficit with Japan shrank by 6.7 percent in May to 5.3
billion dollars but for the first five months of this year is
still running 6.5 percent above the 1998 levels.
</P>
<P>
But the May deficit with Western Europe rose to 3.6 billion
dollars, the biggest imbalance since July 1998. Rising trade
tensions with Europe have led the Clinton administration to impose
economic sanctions on more than 300 million dollars in European
luxury imports in disputes involving U.S. banana companies and
beef producers.
</P>
<P>
The deficit with Mexico in May climbed to 2.2 billion dollars,
the second-highest level on record.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the swelling trade deficit might fuel the
government's worry of growing cries for protection from U.S.
industries, ranging from steel producers to apple growers.

<HEADLINE> 130,000 Visitors Pass Three Gorges Dam Safely </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Some 130,000 visitors who were
stranded in the area of the Three Gorges Project, China's largest
hydroelectricity project now under construction, due to worsening
floods on the Yangtze River, had all safely left there by land by
20:00 tonight.
</P>
<P>
Experts pointed out that because the water level inside the dam
area stands at a relatively high level, shipping there has been
halted three times since June 30, which resulted in a lot of
passengers being forced to stay on their ships.
</P>
<P>
The local government mobilized thousands of coaches to help
these passengers, including some foreign visitors, out of trouble.
</P>
<P>
By 8:00 tonight, all the passengers on 810 ships, including 2,
900 foreign visitors, had left the dam area on the upper reaches
of the Yangtze by land, and work is going on to move the remaining
visitors out of the area.
</P>
<P>
The biggest flood peak on the Yangtze this year passed Yichang,
where the dam is located, at 13:00 this afternoon. The water level
at the Project has accordingly dropped. However, shipping there
will continue to be halted for a certain time.

Cup in France were fined a symbolic 1,000 euros by The European
Commission on Tuesday, because of favoring French residents in
ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
The Commission said the fine was relatively light because it
was the first time it had reviewed ticket sales for a sports event
and it therefore accepted that the organizers could not have
foreseen their legal problems.

But it warned sports event organizers that in future it would
take a tougher line.

<HEADLINE> WTO Must Guard Against Protectionism: CBI </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON July 20 (Xinhua) The World Trade Organisation (WTO) must
continue to guard against protectionism if it is to meet the needs
of business in the 21st century, said the Confederation of British
Industry (CBI) Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
CBI's governing Council approved the objectives it wants to
come out of the WTO Ministerial meeting in Seattle in November.
The paper - CBI Objectives for the 1999 WTO Ministerial Meeting -
will be sent to the UK Government.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the paper, Adair Turner, CBI Director-General, said:
"This autumn's ministerial meeting offers a vital opportunity to
show whether the WTO can be an effective trade body into the next
century."
</P>
<P>
"The CBI will be looking to the US, as the host, to take a
lead in ensuring that the WTO renews its commitment to free and
open trade," he added.
</P>
<P>
At a time when globalization is creating truly world markets
for goods, services and capital, Turner said it needs to make sure
that countries do not become more protectionist.
</P>
<P>
For world trade to flourish the WTO must become able to settle
disputes fast and effectively. Without this there is a real fear
that countries may become more protectionist as they fail to
implement WTO rules fully and faithfully, he stressed.

<HEADLINE> UK Retreats From Euro Poll, Guardian Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON July 20 (Xinhua) The UK government is backing away from
firm plans to hold a referendum on joining the single European
currency in the next parliament, the Guardian reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper, quoting unidentified Labor sources for its
information, said there is no guarantee that a referendum will be
held in the next parliament at all, let alone in the aftermath of
of an election in the summer of 2001.
</P>
<P>
Officially, Labor was committed to holding a referendum on the
European single currency provided five economic tests were met,
but the assumption had been that the poll would be held early in
the next parliament if Blair won again, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
"The key thing is the five tests. We are not going to take a
decision for political reasons that are economically risky," one
source was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"People who are interpreting our policy as that there will
definitely be a referendum early in the next parliament have got
it wrong," he added.
</P>
<P>
It is commonly believe that the Labor government has been on
the back foot over the euro issue since taking a pounding in
European elections last month.

<HEADLINE> Flood Situation in Bangladesh May Take Serious Turn: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh is apparently heading
towards a severe flood this year, due to simultaneous rise of
water levels in all the four river basins following heavy monsoon
during the past two days, experts said.
</P>
<P>
"Despite a sign of improvement with recession of downpour early
this week, the flood situation now takes a reverse course with
heavy monsoon in the upper catchment areas," said engineer A.N.H.
Akhtar Hossain of the Flood Warning Center (FWC), the BSS news
agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The "very active monsoon" has resulted in the rise of water
levels in major rivers of the Meghna, Brahmaputra and Ganges
basins simultaneously. "The situation now depends absolutely on
the weather and if the monsoon continues for the next two days, we
fear the country will face a disaster," said Hossain.
</P>
<P>
FWC officials said normally the rivers in the Meghna basin rise
in May-June, the Brahmaputra basin in July and the Ganges basin in
July-August. But now all the rivers in the three basins are rising
at the same time, as it happened during the century's worst floods
last year, they said.
</P>
<P>
A prolonged flood hit Bangladesh last year, which lasted from
July to September, affecting two-thirds of the country, killing
over 1,000 persons and inflicting huge economic losses.
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists said a "long series" of strong clouds
originating from the Bay of Bengal now covered entire Bangladesh
and the upper catchment areas which were likely to cause heavy
downpour in the next several days.
</P>
<P>
"There is no sign of recession in the next few days," a
meteorologist said, predicting "heavy to very heavy" monsoon over
Bangladesh, particularly in the entire southern part, in the next
18 hours from 6 p.m. Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
In a statement of "warning message," the FWC said that "due to
very heavy fall in the northern part of the country, the districts
of Kurigram, Rangpur, Gaibangha and Bogra may experience flash
flood and local inundation."
</P>
<P>
The excessive rainfall in the southeastern hill basin has
already caused flash flood in the hill districts and further heavy
fall might aggravate the situation, the FWC said, adding that "the
prevailing flood situation in the Meghna basin (in greater Sylhet
and some parts of central Bangladesh) will deteriorate further."
</P>
<P>
Reports said flood protection embankments of several rivers in
the country collapsed earlier this month and a number of districts
in southeastern Bangladesh have been flooded, leaving thousands
and thousands of people homeless.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The number of the China Telecom's
fixed phone users has surpassed 100 million.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference today, Lu Xinkui, vice-minister of the
information industry, issued a certificate to the 100 millionth
user, a 16-year-old Beijing girl named Hou Shiwen.
</P>
<P>
Insiders note that this indicates that the China's
telecommunications industry has entered a new development period.
</P>
<P>
China's fixed phone business is mainly operated by China
Telecom. The second-largest telecommunication company in the
country, China Unicom, only manages local phone networks in
Tianjin and Chongqing municipalities, and Sichuan Province on a
trial basis.
</P>
<P>
Lu noted that in the past 20 years China's communications
capacity witnessed a rapid development, with a network which
covers the country and links it with the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that by the end of last month, China Telecom's
total switching capacity of the central office exchange had
reached 145 million lines, and the number of circuit terminals of
long-distance the automatic switching network had reached 4.52
million.
</P>
<P>
While promoting the telecommunications capacity, China Telecom
is also making efforts to improve its services.
</P>
<P>
Since March of this year, the country has adjusted posts and
telecommunications fee rates by a large margin. The additional fee
formerly charged for local phone fees has been abolished, and the
installment fees have been lowered by 57 percent in the country as
a whole.

The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton announced plans on Monday to
hasten economic assistance to Israel, whose visiting prime
minister vowed to reinvigorate the "sacred mission" of finding a
lasting peace with his country's Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
-- As fresh ships and sensors gathered offshore to probe for
wreckage, investigators released new data on Monday that portrayed
the final half-minute of John F. Kennedy Jr.'s doomed flight as an
uncontrolled plunge into the sea. Massachusetts State Police
divers found neither bodies nor wreckage.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Even five months after Mr. Clinton's trial in the Senate,
the President's impeachment by the House of Representatives
remains an energizing issue that still angers supporters of both
parties enough to make them reach for their checkbooks, said fund-
raisers for both the Republican and Democratic parties.
</P>
<P>
-- President Bill Clinton pledged on Monday that he would get
in touch with President Hafez al-Assad of Syria to emphasize that
a "golden opportunity" lay before him to complete a peace deal
with Israel. Mr. Clinton spoke as he and Prime Minister Ehud
Barak of Israel ended a series of meetings.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Microsoft's net income advanced 60 percent in its fiscal
fourth quarter, topping forecasts. But the firm warned that
growth is likely to slow next year.
</P>
<P>
-- Two U.S. peacekeepers in Kosovo died when their armored
personnel carrier overturned on Sunday near Domorovce, the first
American deaths since the force moved into the province.

government of China and that Taiwan is an inalienable part of

<HEADLINE> China Closes Down More Coal Mines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July (Xinhua) -- China closed down 23,168 coal mines,
mostly small ones, across the country in the first five months of
this year, further cutting coal production by more than 100
million tons, according to statistics from the State
Administration of the Coal Industry.
</P>
<P>
Coal supply exceeds demand in China, and the coal stockpiles of
the country keep increasing, so the Administration is continuously
shutting down coal mines, particularly small township-run ones,
officials here said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the activities of many small coal mines in some major
coal producing provinces and autonomous regions have caused a
severe waste of coal resources, and worsened the ecological
situation.

<HEADLINE> Russia Denies Violation of Arms Embargo on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Tuesday denied as
groundless British reports that the sudden transfer of Russian
peacekeepers from Bosnia to Kosovo was intended to protect
military secrets from NATO rather than for political reasons, the
Interfax news agency reported, quoting sources with the defense
and foreign ministries.
</P>
<P>
The denial came after reports Monday in the Times and Jane's
Defense Weekly that said Russian paratroopers rushed to Pristina
on June 12 to keep out NATO forces from the area until air-defense
and missile systems unknown to the West were removed from secret
underground hangars and stores in the Slatina airport area.
</P>
<P>
The publications listed SA-10 surface-to-air-missiles and
Tamara air-defense systems capable of discovering U.S. stealth
aircraft. They assumed that the air defense means may have been
sold or rented to Belgrade in violation of international sanctions,
an assertion Moscow categorically denied.
</P>
<P>
Interfax quoted the ministry sources as saying that Russia
strictly observes all its international commitments.
</P>
<P>
"This fully applies to the requirements of the U.N. Security
Council resolution concerning a ban on arms deliveries to
Yugoslavia," the sources said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The People's Bank of China (PBOC)
and the Ministry of Finance announced today that certificate bonds
can be hypothecated for bank loans, and a regulation has been
promulgated to guide such business.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the PBOC, the central bank, said that this move
is aimed at offering convenience to consumers to buy houses, motor
vehicles and other consumer goods, and at the same time, to
diversify functions of treasury bonds gives individual investors
more convenient capital financing.
</P>
<P>
According to the procedure, certificate bonds issued since the
beginning of 1999 can be hypothecated in return for Renminbi loans
from commercial banks, but the amount of loans granted should not
exceed 90 percent of the value of the hypothecated bonds.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
stressed in a telephone conversation with U.S. President Bill
Clinton Sunday that the Taiwan issue concerns China's sovereignty
and territorial integrity, as well as the cause of peaceful
reunification of the motherland and the feelings of all Chinese
people, according to a People's Daily's Wednesday commentary.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that to realize peaceful reunification of the
motherland is the firm determination of the Chinese government and
the common wish of all the Chinese people, including Taiwan
compatriots and overseas compatriots.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's remarks full expressed the firm resolve of the Chinese
government and people to fight against splittism and defend China'
s sovereignty and territorial integrity, the article says.
</P>
<P>
His remarks also show that the Chinese communists have always
regarded the reunification of the motherland as their historical
task, which represents the strong will of the Chinese people on
the issue of reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The article says that anyone with even a slight knowledge of
Chinese history knows that it has been the tradition of the
Chinese nation since the dawn of history to oppose splittism and
uphold reunification.
</P>
<P>
This determination to seek reunification is firmly rooted in
the culture of the Chinese nation, and flows in the blood of the
Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Sun Yat-sen once pointed out that "China is a reunified
country which has been imprinted on the consciousness of Chinese
history. And it is exactly this that has kept Chinese civilization
intact despite the many forces of destruction facing it."

The cause of the reunification of the motherland conforms to
the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation, the article says.
The Chinese people believe in the truth that the "one China"
principle is the foundation and prerequisite for the reunification
of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
To sum up, the "one China" principle conforms to the interests
of the entire Chinese people and the fundamental interests of
people on both sides of the Taiwan Straits, it says.
</P>
<P>
Any words or deeds undermining this principle betray the will
and interests of the Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
Lee Teng-hui and the Taiwan authorities enraged the whole of
the Chinese people by undermining the "one China" principle. Such
unwise words and deeds certainly will not be forgiven or excused,
the article stresses.
</P>
<P>
Historical facts prove that anyone who defies the feelings and
will of the Chinese people and dares to challenge the
reunification of the motherland and the "one China" principle is
doomed to failure.
</P>
<P>
And the cause of the reunification of the motherland, which

<HEADLINE> Turkey Rules out Federal Solution in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit Tuesday ruled out any notion of establishing a bicommunal,
bizonal federation in Cyprus, the Cyprus News Agency (CNA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit, who went to Turkish Cypriot area in Cyprus Tuesday for
a one-day visit, said that "as far as the Turkish side is
concerned, the federal solution is no longer on the cards."
</P>
<P>
He warned that unless a confederal solution is agreed upon, the
current division on the island will remain.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in northern Nicosia controlled by Turkish Cypriots,
where he watched a parade commemorating the 25th anniversary of
the Turkish invasion, Ecevit called on the G-8 (seven most
industrialized nations plus Russia) not to get involved in the
Cyprus peace effort.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued on June 20 at the end of their annual
summit in Cologne, Germany, the leaders of G-8 urged the Greek
and Turkish Cypriots to enter talks without setting any
pre-conditions and negotiate in good faith until a settlement is
reached.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared in 1983 a breakaway
"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" recognized only by Ankara.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the island
through a bizonal, bicommunal federation formula, but so far no
tangible results have been achieved.

ISLAMABAD, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The Taliban's supreme leader

Laden, the alleged international terrorist.

<HEADLINE> Mugabe Calls for Int'l Support for Angolan Govt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
Tuesday called on the international community to support the
Angolan government to check UNITA's aggression and restore peace
in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
Opening the fifth session of the fourth parliament of Zimbabwe,
Mugabe said the outbreak of civil war in Angola was a threat to
the development and prosperity of the 14-member Southern African
Development Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
"I therefore reiterate my call upon SADC and the international
community to provide the Angolan government with all the
assistance it needs to check UNITA's (National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola) aggression and bring peace to Angola," he
said.
</P>
<P>
In the Horn of Africa, Mugabe said Zimbabwe welcomed Eritrea
and Ethiopia's endorsement of the Organization of African Unity
(OAU) Framework Agreement.
</P>
<P>
The agreement called for a cease-fire, the deployment of a
peace-keeping force and the actual demarcation of the common
border.
</P>
<P>
On the crisis in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Mugabe
said the signing of an agreement by warring parties involved in
the DRC crisis would enable the Congolese people to begin the
process of resolving their differences and work out arrangements
of their own choice for a new political and constitutional
dispensation for their country.
</P>
<P>
He also praised the Zimbabwe defense force for their sterling
role alongside their counterparts from Angola, Namibia and Congo
(K), in defending the sovereignty and territorial integrity of
that country.
</P>
<P>
He said a declaration recognizing an international fact finding
 commission established to investigate grave breaches and other
serious violations of provisions in the Geneva Conventions and its
additional protocols will be presented for approval by parliament.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Improve Revenue Collection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government is
putting in place measures that will improve revenue collection and
financial accountability, President Robert Mugabe said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the opening of the fifth session of the fourth
 parliament, Mugabe said the government planned to set up a
Zimbabwe Revenue Authority, which was expected to help reduce the
country's budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's budget deficit stands at about 10 billion Zimbabwean
dollars or 263 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The international financial institutions and local business
community had been calling for its reduction.
</P>
<P>
"The establishment of the authority is expected to improve
revenue collection, thereby contributing to the reduction of the
budget deficit," said Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
He said the government would also introduce a new computerized
public financial management system this year which would
significantly improve the state's financial accountability.
</P>
<P>
"Greater effort is already being directed toward ensuring that
all government computer systems are year 2000 compliant," he said.
</P>
<P>
Faced with a situation where resources dedicated to capital
development were declining, Mugabe said the government formulated
a policy that would allow the private sector -- local and foreign
-- to participate in infrastructural development.
</P>
<P>
This would be done according to priorities outlined in the
nation's development plans and programs, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe added that the government was setting up a
Public-Private Partnership in Infrastructure Unit to oversee the
implementation of the government policy.

<HEADLINE> Iran Lambasts U.S. Support for Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Tuesday lashed out at the
United States for its all-out support to Israel after Washington
announced to boost military assistance to Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi said that
the U.S. all-out support for Israel and its growing military
assistance to Tel Aviv is a dangerous action jeopardizing the
Middle East region, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. issued a statement on Monday that it would boost
annual military assistance to Israel from about 1.8 billion
U.S. dollars to about 2.4 billion dollars over the next decade
while gradually phasing out economic aid to Israel.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Israel would strengthen their security
relationship, including giving Israel a fund to buy an Arrow
missile battery for use against ballistic missiles and expanding
joint efforts to develop new technologies to combat such attacks,
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian spokesman said that "the White House is following
partial and biased policy to reinforce the interests of the
Zionist (Israeli) regime by ignoring and sacrificing the
interests of the Muslim and Arab states in the Middle East
region."
</P>
<P>
He condemned Israeli expansionist policy and its ignorance of
the rights of the Palestinians and Lebanon through continued
occupation of the Islamic territories especially Jerusalem, not
allowing the Palestinian refugees to return to their homeland
and launching constant aggressions on Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, the U.S. growing support for the Zionist
regime, which is a sign of the White House's double standard, is
aimed at reinforcing the Zionist regime to reach its expansionist
objectives," he added.

BEIJING, July 20 (Xinhua) -- China registered a fall in
overseas investments both in terms of contractual volume and paid-

</P>
<P>
The newly-approved projects involved 19.39 billion U.S. dollars
of contractual overseas investment, falling by 19.87 percent on a
year-on-year basis. The volume of overseas investments already in
place was 18.57 billion U.S. dollars, declining by 9.21 percent.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June, China had approved a total of 332,764
overseas-invested ventures, with combined contractual overseas
investments of 591.92 billion U.S. dollars and arrived overseas
investments of 286.02 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>

"Some 98 percent of the 1998 international capital flow took

resulted in a continuous drop in the amount of international
capital flow to developing nations, and has had a great impact on
China's efforts to attract overseas investments."

resulted in a continuous drop in the amount of international
capital flow to developing nations, and has had a great impact on
China's efforts to attract overseas investments."

<HEADLINE> Jiang Calls for Greater Poverty Relief Efforts (4) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Some of the remaining poor population live in old
revolutionary base areas, and during the war-time period, they
contributed greatly to the Party and people's cause. Officials at
all levels should feel remorse that they still lead poverty-
stricken lives," Jiang said, noting that any failure to provide
sufficient food and clothing for those people would make it
hard to justify ourselves to the martyrs, the people and history.
</P>
<P>
As a developing socialist country, China will never rely on
others for construction at any time, and must consistently adhere
to the policy of independence and self-reliance, he said, but
called for bold efforts to use foreign capital and technology.
</P>
<P>
"Rural markets are far from developed, and the reason is that
most farmers earn low incomes. So, domestic demand will be greatly
stimulated if their incomes and consumption are raised," he said.
He called for greater poverty relief efforts in the relatively
impoverished central and western areas, as more than 200 million
people live there.
</P>
<P>
Unswerving efforts should be made to do a good job of poverty
relief, in a bid to maintain the hard-won situation of reform,
development, and stability, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have many poor people living in places of strategic
importance and border areas, mainly inhabited by ethnic groups.
Failure to solve the food and clothing problem will jeopardize
national unity, frontier stability and even the national security,
" Jiang warned.
</P>
<P>
He called for increased investment in poverty alleviation from
central and local governments, urging officials in impoverished
areas to give top priority to poverty relief.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Investments in China Drop in 1st Half Year (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In addition, they said, the Asian financial crisis has also
undermined the ability of some southeast Asian countries and
regions to invest abroad, which has also contributed to the
decline of overseas investments in China.
</P>
<P>
However, many experts pointed out that overall investment flow
to China this year will remain at a considerably big scale as
China's national economy is still growing steadily, its currency
remains stable and reforms are making headway as planned. The huge
market potential in China also makes it an ideal place for
overseas investors, they said.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, MOFTEC officials said that China pays great
attention to the environment for attracting overseas investments,
and more favorable policies and measures will be taken to
encourage overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
"We are now opening service trade areas step by step," said a
senior MOFTEC official at a recent meeting. "China's attraction to
overseas investors is expected to be further increased as
important progresses have been made in the country's accession to
the World Trade Organization."

<HEADLINE> Jiang Calls for Greater Poverty Relief Efforts (5) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The efforts to wipe out poverty must be continued without
relaxation even after the task of providing the poverty-stricken
rural population with basic food and clothes is completed, Jiang
said.
</P>
<P>
The top priority for poverty relief in the next century is the
feeding and clothing of the remaining poverty-stricken population
in the rural areas and further improvement of lives of those that
have just been pulled out of poverty, he noted, adding that
efforts should be also made to promote the social and economic
development of those areas in an all-round way.
</P>
<P>
"Poverty relief in the next century must be viewed as part of
China's economic development strategy and considered together with
the strategy of speeding up the construction of the central and
western regions, so as to reduce the gap between the eastern and
western regions for the goal of getting rich together," he said.
</P>
<P>
As a country in the primary stage of socialism, China must
brace for a protracted struggle in its poverty relief efforts, he
continued.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said China's population now stands at 1.25 billion, and
might hit 1.6 billion by the year 2030; its per-capita farmland is
less than one third of the world's average, and its per-capita
water resources only one fourth.
</P>
<P>
China is feeding one-fifth of the world's population with no
more than one tenth of the world's farmland and less than one-
seventh of water resources.
</P>
<P>
It will be quite a long historical process for China to change
from a country that has an overwhelmingly rural population and
depends mainly on human power to an industrialized country that
boasts modern agriculture and service industries, and has most of
its population living in urban areas, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He quoted the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping as saying that
the consolidation and development of the socialist system will
take the efforts of generations, or even dozens of generations of
Chinese people. Hence, he said, we must have a long-term plan in
our minds and work toward that goal step by step.
</P>
<P>
While noting that China can not expect lockstep development
among its regions through the means of egalitarianism, Jiang said
the time has now come for China to accelerate the development of
its central and western regions.

<P>
"From now on, this must be considered a major strategic task of
the Party and the government and given greater priority," Jiang
stressed.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the central and western regions of the country
hold very important strategic positions because of their vast
areas and rich resources of power, minerals and agriculture, which
are essential to China's sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that the government will continue to give priority
to the central and western regions in arranging investment
projects in the fields of water resources, electricity,
transportation, environmental protection and resources development.
</P>
<P>
In fact, he said, the government has been doing just that in
recent years. For example, 62 percent of the extra-budget
investment in 1998 was spent on such projects in the central and
western regions.
</P>
<P>
Jiang called for enhanced economic and technological
cooperation between the western and eastern regions for their
mutual benefit. In particular, he said, eastern regions should
give priority to helping the improvement of the basic conditions
of life and production in the western regions.
</P>
<P>
Noting that it is the task and responsibility of the Party to
serve the people, Jiang said that the fight against poverty would
be a major test of Party members and cadres.
</P>
<P>
He charged all Party members and officials to go to the poverty-
stricken areas, to hear the people's opinions and help the people
cast off poverty.
</P>
<P>
He said the dispatch of Party officials to poverty-stricken
areas should be an important way to test and judge them, and only
those who have survived the test and won the trust of the people
should be promoted.
</P>
<P>
Jiang finally urged the whole Party and society to become
further mobilized, to hold higher the banner of Deng Xiaoping
Theory, and to stick to the strategy outlined by the 15th National
Congress of the Party for the ultimate victory in the battle
against poverty.

BEIJING, July 20 (Xinhua) -- China witnessed a negative growth
in its ocean fishing sector in the first half of this year, which
shows that the country has realized the target of zero growth of
its ocean fishing harvest.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics released by the Fishery Administration
Bureau under the Ministry of Agriculture, China's aquatic catches
reached 6.73 million tons in the January to June period, down 2.32
percent from the same period of last year. Of them, the catches
from the seas dropped by 220,000 tons, to 5.6 million tons.
</P>
<P>
China started implementing a fishing ban this year as part of
its efforts to promote the recovery of marine resources. The
fishing ban from June 1 through July 31 applies to an area in the
South China Sea north of 18 degrees north latitude.
</P>
<P>
It is said that about 90,233 fishing boats were idle during

<HEADLINE> Tourism Makes Big Headway In Past Two Decades (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The tourism sector has blossomed as
one of China's major economic sectors as it is reported to have
earned 343.9 billion yuan in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Sun Gang, deputy director of the National Tourism
Administration, said that he regards the progress as a result of a
number of inspiring speeches given around 1979 by the late Chinese
leader Deng Xiaoping who called for all-out efforts to accelerate
the nation's tourism development.
</P>
<P>
The guideline was first definitely brought forward during Deng'
s visit to the Mount Huangshan scenic spot in east China's Anhui
Province in July 1979, with the backdrop of the nation's
backwardness in its tourism industry caused by the "Cultural
Revolution" (1966-1976).
</P>
<P>
Deng's stirring speeches helped free the Chinese people from
old ideas that sightseeing was a political tool and not an
economic one, Sun Gang told a recent meeting in Huangshan City to
commemorate the 20th anniversary of Deng's visit to Mount
Huangshan.
</P>
<P>
As a result, great changes have taken place to the country's
tourism in the past two decades. In 1996, China's tourism sector
reached the goal set by Deng to reap 10 billion U.S. dollars in
earnings from overseas tourists a year.
</P>
<P>
The number of overseas tourists to China soared to more than 63
million in 1998, 35 times the figure in 1978, the year the country
introduced the reform and opening-up policy, which was initiated
by Deng.
</P>
<P>
The country's tourism earnings from overseas visitors were 48
times the 1978 figure, topping the 12.6 billion U.S. dollars
earned in 1998. This puts China in the 8th place in the world in
its foreign-exchange earnings from overseas visitors, a remarkable
leap from 41st in 1978.

WUHAN, July 20 (Xinhua) -- By eight o'clock this morning, 20,
000 residents of the Paizhouwan Flood Diversion Zone in central
China's Hubei Province, had been evacuated to safety, in
preparation for a possible diversion of flood waters.
</P>
<P>
The authorities plan to remove a total of 57,000 local
residents from the diversion zone, which is located in Jiayu
County, in order to protect major cities on the lower reaches of
the Yangtze River, the longest in the country.
</P>
<P>
Since the collapse of dykes at Paizhouwan last August, the
local government has exerted great efforts to rebuild a 45-km-long
stretch of dykes.
</P>
<P>
It is predicted that the first flood peak of the river will
pass Paizhouwan soon, with a predicted water level of 31.45 meters,
0.03 meters higher than last year's record, which breached the
dykes.

The nation's earnings from domestic tourists are growing even
faster than those from overseas visitors.
</P>
<P>
Huangshan City, at the foot of Mount Huangshan, has witnessed
speedy economic development in the past two decades by taking
advantage of the renowned tourist attraction, which has been
listed by UNESCO as one of the world's cultural and natural

</P>
<P>
Huangshan city earned 1.14 billion yuan from tourism in 1998,
and the number of visitors to local scenic attractions reached 58,
000 in January-May of this year, a 37 percent rise on a yearly
basis.
</P>
<P>
Over the past ten years, Huangshan has invested two billion
yuan to develop more than 30 local scenic spots, and brought
domestic air routes serving the area to over 20. In addition, it
has built eight new highways.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 120,000 people engaged in the local tourism
sector, which has boosted the development of such local economic
sectors as arts and crafts, foodstuffs and garments.
</P>
<P>
Now China should give priority to working out a plan for
tourism development for 2001-2005 and even until 2015, said Sun,
adding that key outlines included are the further promotion of
tourism in the central and western parts of the country, and the
gradual loosening of restrictions on Chinese traveling overseas.

<HEADLINE> Armed Police Donate for Afforestation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 20 (Xinhua) -- China's armed police have declared
war against severe soil erosion by donating money to assist the
afforestation efforts across the country.
</P>
<P>
A total of 4.32 million yuan (about 520,000 U.S. dollars)
donated by armed policemen was presented to the China Youth
Development Foundation, which is initiating a national
afforestation project.
</P>
<P>
Xu Yongguang, secretary-general of the foundation, said it was
the largest amount of donation they have received since the "Green
Hope Project" was launched half a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The armed police plan to voluntarily plant about one million
trees in areas around Beijing, on the middle and upper reaches of
the Yellow River and in the Three Gorges section of the Yangtze
River, political commissar of the armed police Xu Yongqing
announced at today's donation ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Due to uncontrolled logging in the past, the above-mentioned
areas have become vulnerable to frequent attacks by sandstorms,
serious droughts and devastating floods. The Chinese army,
including armed policemen, are regularly deployed to fight natural
disasters.
</P>
<P>
"After all our previous fights against floods, we deeply
understand how important it is to protect the ecological
environment," Xu Yongqing said.
</P>
<P>
The Green Hope Project has collected more than 10 million yuan
for massive afforestation in the Yellow and the Yangtze river
basins.

<HEADLINE> Crackdown Launched on Quack Doctors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 20 (Xinhua) -- China's public health authority
has started a crackdown on the illegal practice of medicine
through further implementation of a national law on medical
practitioners.
</P>
<P>
The Law on Medical Practitioners, which went into effect in May
this year, stipulates that a doctor is allowed to practise
medicine only after passing the official national examination and
acquiring a license. The Ministry of Health (MOH) has just
published two sets of regulations to strengthen the enforcement of
the law.
</P>
<P>
"This is an important measure to clear up the medical services
market. The crackdown on illegal and fake doctors has to be
stepped up," said Wu Mingjiang, director of the MOH's department
of medical administration.
</P>
<P>
The official acknowledged that the downsliding of medical
services in recent years has aroused lots of complaints. Many
persons without licenses practise medicine, especially in rural
and remote areas which have less access to medical services.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China has more than 1.5 million doctors
and some 460,000 medical assistants. However, it is found that the
number of new physicians in recent years has far exceeded the
number of graduates from medical colleges, which suggests that
many unqualified people are practicing medicine.
</P>
<P>
A senior legislator also admitted that cases of unauthorized
medical services have been on the rise in recent years, because
some people take advantage of legal and administrative loopholes
to practise medicine without licenses.
</P>
<P>
"Their illegal activities seriously endanger the people's
health, and must be stamped out," said Zhang Xuwu, vice-chairman
of the Ninth National People's Congress Law Committee.
</P>
<P>
Wu Mingjiang said, starting next year, all physicians will have
to obtain two certificates - a qualification certificate after
passing the national examination and a registration license.
</P>
<P>
Even after acquiring the necessary qualifications, all doctors
will be urged to improve their professional skills and strictly
adhere to medical ethics. Violators will be liable to suspension
of their licenses, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
"The people's health should always enjoy the top priority, and
so we won't allow unqualified persons to infiltrate the ranks of
medical practitioners," stressed Health Minister Zhang Wenkang.

LONDON, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Zahra Quaziz of Morocco is to run
for a new women's 5,000 meters world record at the British Grand
Prix at Crystal Palace on August 7, said event organizers Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> China Announces Minimum Prices for Major Tungsten Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 20 (Xinhua) -- China announced today the minimum
prices for major tungsten products today as a measure to combat
dumping activities on the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
The bottom-line price for tungsten concentrate is set at 19,175
yuan per ton, ammonium paratungstate at 38,800 yuan and tungsten
trioxide at 45,000 yuan, according to the Chinese Wolfram Industry
Association.
</P>
<P>
The announcement, made at today's national conference on
tungsten products prices, will take effect tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
This is the first price management step by the nonferrous
metals sector since China passed a regulation last November to
stop unfair business practices.
</P>
<P>
Guo Shengkun, deputy director of the State Administration of
the Nonferrous Metals Industry, said that wolfram is one of China'
s important mineral resources; its deposits, output and exports
account for 60 percent, 80 percent and 70 percent, respectively,
of the world's total.
</P>
<P>
However, over-exploitation and dumping by some enterprises over
the past few years have disrupted the normal economic order, and
the prices for high-purity tungsten concentrate on the global
market have plunged from 190 U.S. dollars per ton several years
ago to 50 U.S. dollars at present, he said.
</P>
<P>
An official with the State Development Planning Commission's (
SDPC) Price Management Department said that the SDPC and related
departments will work out the average costs for wolfram producers
as a guide for setting the minimum price level.
</P>
<P>
At today's conference, the State Economic and Trade Commission
and the Ministry of Land and Resources jointly issued a circular
on a campaign to rectify the order for the production and
management of wolfram enterprises.
</P>
<P>
According to the circular, unauthorized wolfram mines,
refineries and processing companies will be shut down, and the
government will manage the purchase and sales of wolfram products.
All individual purchase and sale are forbidden by the circular.
</P>
<P>
The clear-up drive will be completed by June 30 next year.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Blasts Kabila, Allies on Violating Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan government Monday
accused Congolese President Laurent Desire Kabila and his allies
of violating the cease-fire agreement signed in Lusaka last week,
state-run Radio Rwanda reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the Office of the President late Monday
night accused Kabila's forces and its backers of repeated
violations of the Lusaka accord in launching both ground and air
attacks on positions held by the Congolese rebels, the Rwanda News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Office of the President also accused Zimbabwe of training
and arming Rwandan Hutu ''Interahamwe'' before sending them back
to Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to prop up Kabila and
prepare the invasion of Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The former Rwandan government forces and its Interahamwe
militia were blamed for the 1994 genocide of over 500,000 Tutsis
and moderate Hutus in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The statement alleged that Kabila and his allies have violated
the spirit of the accord signed in Lusaka on July 10.
</P>
<P>
The Congolese rebels failed to sign the accord following
internal squabble over who should represent and sign for the main
rebel movement, the Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD), and
pledged to fight on to topple Kabila.
</P>
<P>
"The government of the Republic of Rwanda wishes to bring to
notice the continued air bombardment and ground attacks by
president Kabila's forces and the countries supporting him, since
the signing of the Lusaka accord," the statement highlighted.
</P>
<P>
"The government further notes with grave concern the continued
training of Interahamwe militia in Zimbabwe and their deployment
in the DRC in blatant defiance of agreement calling for the
disarmament of the genocidal forces," the statement underlined,
warning that the continued violation renders the spirit of the
peace deal "fragile and seriously undermined."
</P>
<P>
Rwanda urged Zambian President Frederick Chiluba, the mediator
in the 11-month-old conflict raging in Africa's third-largest
country, to have the rebels sign the agreement so that the peace
deal can be smoothly implemented.
</P>
<P>
According to a Rwandan senior military commander in Congo (K),
Kabila's forces and allies have been bombing Tiana-Mwanga town
near Kabila's home town of Manono in northern Katanga province,
Dibelenge in Eastern Kasai, and Ikela, 1,000 kilometers northeast
of the capital Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
No casualty figures were revealed, but the officer claimed that
many civilians perished under the bombs of Antonovs and Mig jet
fighters of Kabila and his allies.
</P>
<P>
The Congolese forces and its allies in turn also charged that
rebels and their Rwandan backers have not respected the cease-fire
deal and have continued to mount attacks on their positions and
have cut off some of the supply routes,

especially in eastern Kasai.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, news agencies have reported heavy fighting in
Zongo, in northern Congo, where clashes between the Congolese
Liberation Movement (MLC) of Jean Pierre Bemba, and government
troops pushed over 1,000 residents to cross to the Central African
Republic.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda and Uganda dispatched troops to DRC to help the
Congolese rebels in fighting to remove Kabila from power, while
Zimbabwe, Namibia, Angola and Chad sent troops to support him.
Kabila is allegedly also backed by a number of regional guerrilla
forces fighting to remove the governments in Rwanda, Burundi, and
Uganda, but he denied.

<HEADLINE> Angola Needs $105 Million to Help War Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Minister of Assistance and
Resettlement Albino Malungo has said his country needs about 105
million U.S. dollars to implement various programs on refugee
relief.
</P>
<P>
Malungo made the remarks to the official Angola News Agency
Angog on his way to Geneva to attend a United Nations annual
meeting, Angog reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the current refugee problem is
"very serious" due to renewed civil war in Angola. However, the
government could only afford over 20 million dollars in this
regard. He appealed to the international community to assist the
1.7 million refugees in the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Malungo revealed that the International Red Cross
Society has decided to provide 10 million Swiss francs (about 6.3
million dollars) to help 60,000 poor rural families.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the United Nations Food and Agriculture
Organization and World Food Program also raised about 37.45
million dollars to assist about 800,000 refugees.
</P>
<P>
Since the international aid is far from enough, the Angolan
government recently changed the relief strategy to self-relief
through agricultural production so that the refugees could be
self-sufficient.
</P>
<P>
The government plans to use the major amount of the relief
fund on purchasing seeds, farm tools and other means of
production. The minister expressed his hope that the new strategy
could win support internationally and hence solve the problem of
the shortage of fund.

a planned economy before 1978.
</P>
<P>
However, heightened competition was reported in the market of
means of production afterwards when all kinds of enterprises get
in to grab a slice of the market.
</P>
<P>
The new computerized distribution network will enable
commodities to be traded in a unified way, and buyers can acquire
information, place orders and make settlement through networking
with the sales center.
</P>
<P>
Company president Tian Yuan said his company also has
intentions to expand itself into a comprehensive group in
materials circulation industry, and negotiations are underway with
two companies from North America and Hong Kong to start joint
ventures in materials transportation.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Authorities in the Far Eastern
Russian region of Khabarovsk on Tuesday declared a state of
emergency in the wake of raging forest fires, the Interfax news

</P>
<P>
Viktor Ishayev, head of the Khabarovsk territorial
administration, said 350 fires have been registered so far this

Ishayev instructed local leaders to take exhaustive measures
to combat fires and ordered the use of technical equipment and
personnel from all enterprises and organizations irrespective of
their organizational and legal status.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Calls for Greater Poverty-Relief Efforts (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
called on the whole nation to step up their efforts to basically
resolve the problem of food and clothing for the country's needy
in the rural areas by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
"The poverty-relief work has reached a crucial stage, so we
must mobilize the forces of the whole Communist Party of China (
CPC) and society to take concrete steps to ensure we reach the
strategic target by 2000," Jiang told a conference on the topic
here.
</P>
<P>
Since the founding of new China in 1949, the CPC and the
Chinese government have always given priority to solving the
problem of food and clothing for the poor people, whose number has
decreased by 10 million annually on the average over the past 20
years, he said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, the impoverished population in the rural
areas dropped to 42 million from 250 million in 1978. Moreover,
they only accounted for 4.6 percent of the total rural population
compared with 30.7 percent in 1978.
</P>
<P>
"This is a miracle not only in Chinese history but also in
world history," he said.
</P>
<P>
The great achievement in our poverty-relief efforts has proved
that China's socialist system is the fundamental guarantee for the
elimination of poverty, and the road of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics is the only way leading to a rich and
strong country, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Under the leadership of the Party and the central government,
the whole of society has been mobilized and organized to allocate
huge amounts of funds for poverty alleviation, which is unique in
the world, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 20 years, the impoverished population has been
decreasing by an annual average of 10 million in China, in
contrast to the worsening situation in many other countries and
regions, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Senior officials from the Taiwan
Affairs Office under the Communist Party of China's (CPC) Central
Committee and the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council
refuted Lee Teng-hui's separatist remarks here today.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that the divisive acts of Lee Teng-hui have
aroused immense indignation among the Chinese people both at home
and abroad, seriously affected the social stability of Taiwan,
produced a negative effect on Taiwan's economic development and
worsened cross-straits relations.
</P>
<P>
The divisive forces in Taiwan are attempting to revise the so-
called "constitution" and "law" of Taiwan in line with the "two
nations" theory, and realize the "independence of Taiwan" in the
name of the so-called "Republic of China", they said.
</P>
<P>
The officials said by opposing Lee's divisive conspiracy they
are safeguarding China's state sovereignty and territorial
integrity and this is in line with the aspiration of Taiwan
compatriots for peace, stability and development.
</P>
<P>
They warned the divisive forces in Taiwan to stop playing with
fire, and called on the people of insight in Taiwan to distance
themselves from Lee's splittist line and make contributions to the
peaceful reunification of the motherland.

<HEADLINE> Ivanov: No Winners or Losers in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov said Tuesday that there were no winners or losers in the
Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
"The whole of the Balkan operation is a series of blunders,
including political, international, military and information ones,
" Ivanov said in an interview with the Komsomolskaya Pravda
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"A lot of miscalculations were made during the analysis of the
situation in Yugoslavia and its possible consequences," the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
Moscow has been against NATO's military solution to the Kosovo
crisis from the very beginning and suspected its ties with the
transatlantic alliance when it started a 78-day air campaign
against Yugoslavia on March 24.
</P>
<P>
It resumed limited contacts with NATO last month, mainly in
the area of cooperation in peacekeeping operations in the Yugoslav
province.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said the reason for the whipping up of tension around
Yugoslavia was "to put to trial the resolutions, drawn up by NATO
during the past several months," including the use of force
without a mandate from the U.N. Security Council and outside NATO'
s sphere of responsibility.
</P>
<P>
"This goes beyond the sphere of the Balkan problem," Ivanov
said, "In fact, this means the struggle for the future world setup.
"
</P>
<P>
He sees the deployment of massive international peacekeeping
troops in Kosovo as "an inevitable measure, but it is not at all
the best way to maintain peace and stability in the area.
</P>
<P>
Russia, which will eventually have 3,600 peacekeepers in
Kosovo, will try "not to allow the situation to become permanent,"
Ivanov said.

<HEADLINE> Efforts Urged for Protection of "Good Bugs" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- An influential Canadian
environmental group is urging for the protection of six types of "
good insects", as well as earthworms.
</P>
<P>
Honeybees, ladybugs and beetles are listed as endangered
species of beneficial bugs by the country's World Wildlife
Federation (WWF).
</P>
<P>
In its latest report of Beneficial Bugs at Risk from Pesticides,
the WWF recommends Canadians ban the heavy pesticide use that
kills off both beneficial and harmful insects.
</P>
<P>
A single ladybug, for example, can eat up to 4,000 aphids
during a lifetime. But many of the pesticide sprays used by
farmers to kill aphids also kill ladybugs, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The report also warns of the damage inflicted on earthworms,
which condition soil, and banchus flavescens, wasps whose larvae
feed on the canola-eating bertha army worm.
</P>
<P>
"Insects may not be as appealing as big, furry animals, but we'
d be a lot worse off without most of them," concludes the
conservation group.

<P>
Jiang said that the achievement has also shown the world that
the CPC and the Chinese government have always attached great
importance to promoting human rights in China, and have made
strenuous efforts to safeguard the rights of existence and
development of the Chinese people, which are the most important
rights of all.
</P>
<P>
As China has the largest population in the world, it is the
most elementary work for the country to safeguard the rights of
existence and development, he said, adding that China's success in
providing adequate food and clothing to millions of people who
used to live in poverty is a major contribution to the world's
development of human rights.
</P>
<P>
Jiang described the unprecedented poverty alleviation drive in
China as having powerfully facilitated the coordinated development
of the national economy and social stability.
</P>
<P>
Noting that many of the poverty-stricken areas used to be
located in the ethnic minority and border areas, Jiang said that
it is very important to ensure the stable development of those
areas, which will have a major impact on national unity.
</P>
<P>
He said that China has registered rapid economic growth in
ethnic minority and border areas in the past few years, with the
living standards of the local people improving markedly and major
changes taking place in social development.
</P>
<P>
The remarkable progress and experience China has gained in its
poverty-alleviation strive embody the great spirit of self-
reliance and hard work of the Chinese people, which should be
further promoted to encourage the people to work even harder in
the socialist modernization drive, Jiang said.

LMAPUTO, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Voters' registration started
Tuesday in Mozambique and the process would last for two months,

Afonso Dhlakama, chairman of the largest opposition -- the
National Resistance of Mozambique (Renamo), also registered
Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>

"It is the solemn commitment of the Party and the central
government to the entire people to basically solve the food and
clothing problem facing the impoverished population in rural areas
by the year 2000," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"We must work hard to realize this goal, and we have every
favorable condition to do this," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
China still has 42 million poor people in rural areas,
including some 20 million handicapped people and those in abject
poverty who lack fundamental living conditions, Jiang noted,
adding that it will be no easy job to bring 10 million poor people
out of poverty every year over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
"Poverty relief and development have reached the most difficult
stage," Jiang said. "However, the whole Party and the nation must
work together with one mind to tackle the problem."
</P>
<P>
What the poor population in rural areas worry about most is
sufficient food and clothing. The next thing they are concerned
about is a better-off life. So the Party should spare no effort to
help the poor people realize their aspirations, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Chairman Mao Zedong once called on the Party to give priority
to people's clothing, food, housing, chief daily necessities,
medicare and marriages, Jiang recalled, pointing to the political
importance of Party members being organizers of people's daily
life.

<HEADLINE> Israeli-Syrian Talks Could Be Resumed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli-Syrian talks could
be resumed in weeks, a senior aide to Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak said Tuesday amid pledges by Barak to achieve comprehensive
peace within 15 months.
</P>
<P>
"I estimate it won't take very long...but it's closer to weeks
than days," Barak's chief of staff Danny Yatom, who is
accompanying Barak on a six-day visit to Washington, told Israel
Radio.
</P>
<P>
Wrapping up his talks with Barak Monday, United States
President Bill Clinton called on Syrian President Hafez al-Assad
Monday to seize the current "golden opportunity" to resume the
peace negotiations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
"He knows very well that I am committed to the peace process
between Israel and Syria, and I believe he has a golden
opportunity now to resume them," Clinton said at a joint news
conference with Barak.
</P>
<P>
Barak is on his maiden visit to Washington since taking office
early this month. He has held rounds of talks with Clinton and
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
Defeating the hard-line Benjamin Netanyahu in the prime
ministerial election in May, Barak has pledged to push forward
the peace process on all tracks -- the Palestinian, Syrian and
Lebanese tracks, which were largely frozen in the three years of
Netanyahu's office.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Washington, which started Thursday, Barak
set a 15-month target period for reaching peace with the three
Arab neighbors. His aides explained that by setting such a
time frame, Israel is showing the Arab parties that it is not
interested in dragging foot in peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Israel had held sporadic peace talks with Syria since 1991
before they broke off in early 1996. The two sides did not resume
official talks in the last three years, but Netanyahu said he had
held back-channel contacts with Damascus, during which he said
progress had been made on security issues.
</P>
<P>
Syria denied such contacts have ever taken place.
</P>
<P>
Since his election victory, Barak has reached out to Damascus,
saying he will work for a quick solution to the Israeli-Syrian
hostility on the basis of United Nations Resolutions 242 and 338.
</P>
<P>
The two resolutions call on Israel to withdraw its troops from
Arab territories it seized in the 1967 Middle East war, including
the strategic plateau Golan Heights of Syria.
</P>
<P>
Barak has said he is ready to make territorial compromise on
the Golan, but he has not defined the extent of such compromise,
saying Israel has to see what Assad is willing to give to Israel
on issues like security arrangements and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He welcomed reports Monday that Syria has asked radical
Palestinian groups based in Damascus to halt their armed struggle
against Israel, saying it would be "good news" if it is true.
</P>
<P>
The reports said the Syrian call also went out to Hezbollah, or
Party of God, which is leading a war of attrition to oust Israeli
troops and their local ally South Lebanon Army militia from a
border zone Israel carved out in southern Lebanon in 1985.
</P>
<P>
Barak has promised to withdraw Israeli troops from southern
Lebanon within a year. To achieve this goal would require progress
on the talks with Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> WTO Ruling Body to Decide on Leadership Plan This Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The ruling General Council of the
World Trade Organization (WTO) will formally decide within this
week on a power-sharing plan which could possibly put an end to
the logjam over the organization's new leader, according to trade
officials.
</P>
<P>
During an informal meeting Wednesday at the WTO headquarters,
trade envoys of the WTO members discussed the draft "3+3" plan
brokered by Bangladesh and Australia, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
"We are close to have agreement to the plan. It is 99 percent,
" one ambassador said at the end of the three-hour closed-door
meeting. The major problems left now are the number of the deputy
director-generals and their allocation among different
geographical regions.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, Mike Moore of New Zealand would be the WTO
Director-General for three years from September 1, 1999 to August
31,2002. Supachai Panitchpakdi of Thailand would succeed Moore
from September 1, 2002 for three years to August 31, 2005.
</P>
<P>
Neither of the candidates should be eligible for reappointment
as Director-General nor should his period of office be extended,
according to the proposal.
</P>
<P>
Normally, the term of office of the WTO chief is four years
like former WTO Director-General Renato Ruggiero has served.

<HEADLINE> Iran Summons Turkish Envoy Again Over Air-Raid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Iran summoned the Turkish charge
d'affaires to Iran Kut Sezgin again on Monday to follow up the
measures taken by Ankara regarding its air raid on Iranian
villages, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Foreign Ministry presented the latest figures of
human and material losses caused by the Turkish attack and
demanded again that the Turkish government make convincing
response and meet Iran's demands.
</P>
<P>
Sezgin reassured that he had promptly reported the case to
Ankara and that he would follow up the matter.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish envoy was summoned by the Iranian Foreign Ministry
for the first time on Sunday night after four Turkish warplanes
raided a military outpost on Iran-Iraq border and tribal tents in
a region, killing five people and injuring 10 others.
</P>
<P>
Iran strongly condemned the raid and observed the right to
take actions against the aggression and violation.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Relations Commission of the Iranian Majlis (parliament)
on Monday urged the Foreign Ministry to speedily adopt
"retaliatory policies against Turkey" for the raid.
</P>
<P>
Issuing a statement, the commission also lambasted Turkish
Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit for his remarks on the recent unrest
in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit said on Tuesday that the current violent unrest in Iran
was the result of an "oppressive and outdated" Islamic regime and
the Iranian people could not be expected to endure it for a long
period.
</P>
<P>
"It is regrettable that Iran's friendly stances towards its
neighbor including Turkey was responded by Turkish militarism,"
the Iranian Majlis commission said.

OTTAWA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The local television warned of
trouble going to the Montreal International Airport Tuesday
because of the dispiute over the limitation to taxi drivers.
</P>
<P>
Passengers could hardly find any taxi on their way to their
flights as furious cabbies refuse to pick up them until the

About 500 cabs blocked access to the airport Monday in protest
against the strict limitations imposed to reduce the number of
taxis from more than 3,000 to 260.
</P>
<P>
Police arrested 27 drivers after a five-hour protest was staged
in front of the ramp to the airport's arrivals and departures area.
</P>
<P>
All 27 taxi drivers were released Monday evening, but they
could face charges of mischief, illegal assembly and obstructing
justice, according to the Montreal police.

<HEADLINE> Potential U.S. attack Forces Arab Families to Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Fearing U.S. attacks on
Afghanistan, some Arab families living near the eastern Afghan
city of Jalalabad have moved to safer places after press reports
said that Osama bin Laden is residing near the town, witnesses
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The travelers said in Pakistan that they saw Arab families
leaving Faram Hadah, 5 kilometer south of Jalalabad, for unknown
places.
</P>
<P>
A British newspaper reported earlier this month that Osama, the
"No. 1 terrorist in the world" as the United States called, is
hiding at Faram Hadah near Jalalabad, capital of Ningrahar
province.
</P>
<P>
There is widespread rumor here that the United States is
planning fresh attacks against Osama who is accused of
masterminding the bombings on U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania
last August.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the bombings, the United States launched a few
cruise missiles on targets in Afghanistan which were reported to
be training bases of Osama.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban movement, which controls a majority of
Afghanistan's territory, had admitted that Osama is still in
Afghanistan and is living under the supervision of a special
commission.
</P>
<P>
In February, the Taliban announced that the Saudi dissident is
missing and that they have no information about his whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
The United States has been demanding the expulsion of Osama.
Recently, it imposed trade and economic sanctions on the Taliban
in a bid to force them to extradite Osama.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, however, are reluctant to expel him, saying
Afghanistan does not have extradition treaty with the United
States and they are not bound to hand him over to Washington.

<HEADLINE> PNA Rejects Merging Wye Pact Into Final Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Local Government Minister of the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) Saeb Erekat stressed here
Tuesday that the PNA rejects the merging of the Wye agreement into
the final status talks.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side hopes that United States President Bill
Clinton and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak would work out a
realistic schedule and action plan on how to implement the
endorsed agreements, Erekat told Voice of Palestine Radio.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side is waiting for Barak to announce the
suspension of Jewish settlement activities in the occupied
territories, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians call on Barak to pledge commitment to the
Wye accord and ensure continued Israeli pullout from the West
Bank, he added.
</P>
<P>
Erekat noted that reconsidering, amending or merging the Wye
pact into the final status talks is unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-brokered Wye agreement, signed last October, asked
Israel to withdraw from another 13.1 percent of the West Bank in
three phases. However, former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu froze the pact after the first stage of pullout.

Since taking office last month, Barak has pledged to carry out
signed agreements between the two sides, but he proposed to
combine the remaining part of the Wye deal with the final status
talks with the Palestinians, which means Israel could make less

The Palestinians has repeatedly refused such proposals.

<HEADLINE> Power Cut Downs Russian Air Defense in Far East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The radar units of the 11th air
and air-defense army have temporarily lost control of the air
border in Russia's Far East due to power cut, the Interfax news
agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
During the period when reserve sources of electricity were not
switched on, military radars lost sight of passenger air lines in
the area which they normally are responsible for after the
Khabarovskenergo company cut off electricity to the air defense
units because of outstanding debts.
</P>
<P>
The air and air-defense forces have paid only 27 percent of
their electricity bills, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
Electricity was also cut off from units in charge of the "
nuclear shield" -- the strategic rocket forces, and from dozens of
garrisons, Interfax said without mentioning when the incident took
place.
</P>
<P>
Military commanders also fear lack of water supply would cause
disaster if ravaging forest fires reach such facilities as arms
depots and there is no water to put them out.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Khabarovsk territorial administration Viktor
Ishayev has declared a state of emergency in the face of forest
fires raging in the region.
</P>
<P>
About 350 fires have been registered so far this year and over
20,000 hectares of forest destroyed. As many as 121 fires were
burning in an area of more than 11,000 hectares as of July 19,
Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
The blackout apparently violated a July 1999 government
resolution that bans cutting supply of heat, electricity and water
to facilities that are of strategic importance for the country's
security.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 20 (Xinhua) -- China's Xinhai Technology Co. Ltd.
announced today that it has put into operation an Internet service
network Chinadns (www.chinadns.com) for medium-sized and small
businesses in the country that want to enter Internet.
</P>
<P>
Insiders noted that it's the first service network to provide
automatic domain names registration for medium-sized and small
businesses.
</P>
<P>
Considering the fact that these businesses are short of funds
and professional personnel, Xinhai has promised to provide several
service items free of charge, including on-line auction and
homepage messages, according to a corporate spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two weeks since Xinhai opened the network on a
trial basis, Chinadns has had more than 5,000 registered customers,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Xinhai is not the first firm to do so, and a number of Chinese
and foreign computer producers and Internet service providers have
been busy helping medium-sized and small businesses surf Internet,
according to industry sources.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the State Economic and Trade Commission and China
Hewlett-Packard jointly opened a homepage to provide training and
policy guiding for medium-sized and small businesses.
</P>
<P>
Also in June, IBM announced a broad-base solution for China's
medium-sized and small businesses to get access to Internet
services.
</P>
<P>
An expert from the Ministry of Information Industry noted that
the country's Internet service market has great potential, and it
is especially so considering that medium-sized and small
businesses account for 99 percent of the total industrial
enterprises in China.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the number of domain names registered in
China is nearly 30,000 at present, and it is expected to reach 600,
000 by the year 2001.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 20 (Xinhua) -- A new medicine for snake bite
treatment has been developed after research over the past fifteen
years, said a report released here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Kapil Mani Mishra, who developed the medicine, said in the
report submitted to the Drugs Management Department that a kind of
weed taken as liquid, powder or in lumps can counter snake poison.
The weed, named Stylo Sadeko, can be found along the Trishuli
River in central Nepal and in the eastern hill regions.
</P>
<P>
Mishra has carried out researches into snakes and plants in
Nepal, India, Bhutan and other countries.
</P>
<P>
Several hundred people die of snake bites every year in Nepal.
So far, snake bite has been treated only through injections.
Before the treatment is given, poisonous snakes have to be
distinguished from non-poisonous ones.

<P>
BEIJING, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC)
National Committee, meeting with visiting President of the Mexican
Supreme Court of Justice Genaro David Gongora Pimentel, said that
the strengthening of exchanges between the two supreme courts of
China and Mexico is conducive to perfecting the legal systems in
both countries.
</P>
<P>
Both China and Mexico are countries with ancient civilizations
and which now face the common task of developing their economies,
said Li, adding that there are broad prospects for friendly
cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The status of courts is a sign of the justice, civilization and
progress of a country, said Li. A large country with a huge
population such as China should carry out legal construction in
line with its own situation, while paying attention to absorbing
all beneficial experiences from overseas, Li added.
</P>
<P>
Gongora said that his current trip is aimed at furthering his
understanding of the judicial system in China, and further
enhancing exchanges and cooperation between the two supreme courts
in such fields as training judges and anti-corruption efforts.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that the Mexican government has consistently
followed the "one-China" policy, and that China's sovereignty and
territorial integrity allow for no separation.

<P>
JAKARTA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian former president
Soeharto was hospitalized at Pertamina hospital in South Jakarta
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Several members of Soeharto's family were seen entering the
hospital building, but there was no immediate report on Soeharto's
disease.
</P>
<P>
Former vice-chairman of the Supreme Advisory Council retired
Let. Gen. Suhardiman and several noted figures were seen to look
up the former president Soeharto at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto's lawyer Juan Felix Tampubolon said Soeharto was no
sick and he only undertook the regular medical check-up every
three weeks, including urine test.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Soeharto had a medical check-up in a hospital in Bad
Oyenhausen, Germany.
</P>
<P>
In late 1997, the former president cancelled trips to attend
the Organization of the Islamic Conference meeting in Tehran and
the informal summit of ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian
Nations) in Kuala Lumpur when his doctors advised him to take a
10-day rest.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto was forced to resign from his presidential position on
May 21 last year after 32 years in power in the country.
</P>
<P>
He was born at the village of Kemusuk Argomulyo, Yogyakarta in
Central Java, on June 8, 1921.

MANILA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
on Tuesday called on his nationals to help the government
eradicate the drug menace, the government's "No.1 public enemy."
</P>
<P>
Addressing the national anti-drug conference here, Estrada said
this move to make the Philippines a drug-free country should
involve every "man, woman and child" through a massive information
and education campaign.
</P>
<P>
"We can already see its evil effects, especially among our
youth," he noted, adding that the illegal drugs are the root of
the crime.
</P>
<P>
The drug menace has reportedly reached a disturbing level in
the country, with more than 6,000 out of 42,000 communities
nationwide already affected by this scourge and some 1.7 million
Filipinos, most of them young, have fallen victims to it.
</P>
<P>
"The worst part of it is that about 70 percent of brutal and
heinous crimes committed were reported to be drug-related," the
president stressed.
</P>
<P>
Estrada called on nationals for a concerted effort in the
anti-drug campaign, saying "we should unite and mobilize now in

<HEADLINE> Russian Investigative Reporter Sentenced, Pardoned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Russia's Pacific Fleet military
court on Tuesday found military reporter Grigory Pasko guilty of
abusing power and sentenced him to three years of imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
However, a recent amnesty announced by the State Duma applies
to this article of the Criminal Code and Pasko was released from
custody in court as he had already spent over one third of his
term at a detention facility, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Pasko, an investigative reporter for the Boyevaya Vakhta
newspaper of the Pacific Fleet, was arrested by military counter-
intelligence on November 20 1997, at Vladivostok airport when he
was returning from a business trip to Japan.
</P>
<P>
He was initially charged with high treason for allegedly
surrendering 10 documents containing state secrets to foreign
citizens. Pasko's defense, however, said that he had reported to
the Japanese media only information about the condition of several
environmentally hazardous Pacific Fleet facilities and all the
materials of the case were directly or indirectly related to
environmental matters.
</P>
<P>
The court did not find proof of Pasko surrendering state
secrets to the Japanese media.
</P>
<P>
The closed trial began on January 21, 1999, in the far eastern
city Vladivostok.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Prosecutor Colonel Konstantin Osipenko wanted the
court to declare Pasko guilty of high treason, sentence him to 12
years of imprisonment and strip him of his military rank and
decorations.
</P>
<P>
In his last word last week Pasko pledged his innocence and
urged the court to acquit him because under Russian law
environmental matters are not classified.
</P>
<P>
Interfax said Pasko's case would still have to be considered by
the military collegium of the Russian Supreme Court.

Administration of Machinery Industry announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate is 0.68 percentage points higher than that of

industrial added value of the machinery industry was worth 56
billion yuan (about 6.78 billion U.S. dollars) in the first half
year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the sales/production ratio of the sector also rose
month by month. In the January-June period, 95.3 percent of
machinery products were sold out, up 0.31 percent over the same
period last year, but 0.36 percent lower than the industrial
sector as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The large and medium-sized firms enjoyed a 10.34 percent of
growth in the period, higher than the sector's average. Their
sales volume reached 218.3 billion yuan, up 8.11 percent over last
year's same period.
</P>
<P>
Stimulated by the government's policy to increase investment in
infrastructure construction, industrial added value of the

LAGOS, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Inspector General of Police
Alhaji Smith has ordered a full scale probe into the hostilities
between Hausa and Yoruba communities which occurred last Sunday at
Shagamu, about 40 kilometers north of Lagos.
</P>
<P>
The inspector general has instructed that further hostilities
must not be allowed to occur and that a detachment of mobile
policemen be released to the troubled spots, according to a New
Nigerian report Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Emmanuel Ajayi, police public relations
officer of the Zone II which comprises Lagos, Oyo and Ogun states,
as saying that a large number of policemen had been released by
the zone to contain the situation.
</P>
<P>
He said that their men are already in control of the area and
warned trouble-makers to stay clear as the police would deal
ruthlessly with anyone found attempting to frustrate police
efforts to restore normalcy.
</P>
<P>
Ajayi explained that the crisis started when an Hausa lady was
attacked because she offended the local tradition by coming out on
July 15 when the Yorubas were performing their "Oro" festival.
</P>
<P>
She was admitted in the hospital where she died the following
day and the death developed into a physical exchange between the
Yoruba and Hausa residents in the town.
</P>
<P>
A dusk to dawn curfew was ordered on Sunday by the Ogun State
Governor, Chief Segun Osoba but tension was still high on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Though security has been beefed up by a combined squads from
Lagos and Oyo states, hundreds of residents were seen fleeing the
troubled town on Monday and the streets of the town remained empty
 with shops and commercial houses closed.
</P>
<P>
The bodies of the victims in the ethnic clashes which left more
than 40 people dead are to be given mass burial on Tuesday.

Organisation (WTO) began a meeting here Tuesday to discuss a power-
sharing plan that could possibly put an end to the logjam over the
organization's new leader, diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
Under the draft "3+3" plan brokered by Bangladesh and Australia,
Mike Moore of New Zealand would be WTO Director-General for three
years from September 1, 1999 to August 31, 2002.
</P>
<P>
Supachai Panitchpakdi of Thailand would succeed Moore from
September 1, 2002 for three years to August 31, 2005.
</P>
<P>
According to the proposal neither of the candidates should be
eligible for reappointment as Director-General nor should his
period of office be extended.
</P>
<P>
The plan has to be adopted by the General Council of the 134-
member WTO.
</P>
<P>
Normally, the term of office of the WTO chief is four years

<HEADLINE> Flood-Hit Chinese Provinces Declare State of Emergency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 20 (Xinhua) -- China's Hubei and Anhui provinces
along the Yangtze River, the country's longest river, have
declared a state of emergency as of today to prepare for worse
flooding reinforced by heavy rains.
</P>
<P>
The decisions were made by the two provincial governments in
accordance with China's Anti-Flood Law that took effect last year.
</P>
<P>
Under the law, local flood-control headquarters are empowered
to make decisions during the emergency period on flood-related
matters such as removing obstacles from roads and bridges,
mobilizing materials, vehicles and laborers, and taking control of
communications facilities.
</P>
<P>
According to sources with the local governments, the flood-
control situation is becoming more and more serious as the water
levels at some sections of the Yangtze have exceeded the danger
lines for 20 days.
</P>
<P>
At 2 p.m. Monday, the water level at Yichang, a major city in
Hubei, climbed to 52.87 meters, 1.19 m. higher than the previous
day. The water level at Wuhan, capital of the province, hit 28.37
m., 0.25 m. higher than the previous day, and the water level at
Anqing in Anhui reached 17.93 m., near the record high in 1983.
</P>
<P>
According to the Yangtze River Water Conservation Committee,
the biggest flood peak of the season is expected to pass through
Yichang today at a flow rate of 57,800 cubic meters per second,
bringing the local water level to an estimated 53.3 m.. The peak
is expected to hit Hankou in Wuhan on July 23.
</P>
<P>
A new round of torrential rains are now sweeping parts of
Sichuan, Guizhou, Hunan and Hubei provinces in the upper and
middle reaches of the Yangtze, posing a growing threat of rampant
flooding in the middle and lower reaches of the river.
</P>
<P>
Facing the threat, the provinces have stepped up efforts to
guard against severe flooding and added flood-control materials in
regions near the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
In Hunan, another province in the middle reaches of the river,
an emergency state was already imposed on July 17, and flood
fighters are keeping watch on dikes and levees day and night.

<HEADLINE> Flow of Crude Premieres in Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 20 (Xinhua) -- First commercial flow of crude oil
has been drilled out in the northern parts of the Tibet Autonomous
Region on the "Roof of the World", the China National Star
Petroleum Corporation (CNSPC) announced here today.
</P>
<P>
This marks an end to the region's history of no crude oil
production, said Zhou Baixiu, CNSPC vice president.
</P>
<P>
The No.3 Luenpola well, which stands 4,700 meters above sea
level, pumped 103 cubic meters of oil during the July 9-11 test
production, reporting 34 cubic meters of oil per day.
</P>
<P>
The successful trial exploration has proven more than three
million cubic tonnes of oil reserves, preluding a medium-sized
oilfield with some 10 million tonnes of reserves, he said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past eight years, the CNSPC has drilled 14 exploratory
wells on the Tibetan Plateau, with crude flow discovered in three
of them. The No.3 Luenpola is the first well in Tibet that has
achieved commercial flow of crude oil.
</P>
<P>
The oil and gas resources at the Luenpola Basin stand at 100
million to 150 million cubic tonnes," Zhou said, adding that the
basin will be an oilfield with the highest elevation in the world.
</P>
<P>
Thermal process was adopted to pump the crude oil in the No.3
Luenpola well, which is viscous crude, as are most of the oil
reserves proven in the northern parts of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
The CNSPC prepares to further expand its findings in the basin,
and will try to build one or two oil development bases with annual
output volume of over 50,000 tonnes each. Integrated research and
exploration will be carried out in an area of 1.2 million sq. km
in Tibet for possible oil and gas reserves.
</P>
<P>
At present China's annual oil output has exceeded 150 million
tonnes, with proven reserves of 17 billion tonnes, ranking the
fifth and the ninth in the world, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Experts pointed out that the latest development is of
significant importance to social stability and economic
development in Tibet, a region traditionally short of energy.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Optimistic About PAL's Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
confident that the recovery of the Philippine Airlines (PAL) will
proceed smoothly after the flag carrier "practically resolved"
issues involving its rehabilitation program, a senior official
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu made the assessment as he
noted that the PAL has already adequately addressed the issues
raised by the U.S. Export-Import Bank (Eximbank), one of the
airline's major creditors which initially opposed the PAL
rehabilitation program.
</P>
<P>
"I think we have satisfied the issues asked by the U.S.
Export-Import Bank, as well as even the issues brought about by
creditors from Europe. So I think PAL's rehabilitation will go on
smoothly," Espiritu said.
</P>
<P>
The PAL is now undergoing a rehabilitation plan that the
Philippine Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved in
June. Lucio Tan, chairman of the Board of Directors of the PAl
and his group of investors infused 200 million dollars in fresh
capital into the airline to get the rehabilitation program going.
</P>
<P>
Espiritu said one of the major issues still hounding the
rehabilitation program involves the treatment of the airline's
secured creditors as compared to its unsecured creditors.
</P>
<P>
Some creditors, he said, felt the SEC was treating unsecured
creditors the same way as secured creditors of the airline.
</P>
<P>
"We assured the creditors that secured creditors will get
priority over unsecured ones in payment of debts," he said.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Say Viagra Keeps Plants From Wilting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 20 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli and an Australian
scientist have found that a small amount of Viagra -- the
male-potency drug -- can stop cut flowers from wilting and double
the shelf life of fruits and vegetables, a local daily reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Prior to this finding, the two scientists have already
patented a process for increasing the shelf-life of produce and
flowers by using Nitric Oxide (NO), an environmental pollutant
that in small quantities has beneficial medical effects, the
Jerusalem Post said.
</P>
<P>
Professor Ya'acov Leshem, a Bar-Ilan University plant
researcher and Prof. Ron Wills of the Australian University of
Newcastle, discovered that Viagra can also promote plant freshness
by using a similar biological mechanism as Nitric Oxide (NO).
</P>
<P>
They have tested Viagra and NO on fruit and vegetables. It
shows that one milligram of Viagra in a solution is enough to
prolong the life of two vases full of cut flowers for as long as
one week.
</P>
<P>
Professor Leshem said he has read a lot about Viagra and
wondered whether it works in plants the same way as in animals
and men.
</P>
<P>
"There definitely is a parallel," he said.
</P>
<P>
Leshem said it isn't known what effect Viagra will have on
people or environment if it is absorbed by fruits and vegetables,
adding that considerable work has to be done before this new
freshness preservation process is approved.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Arctic Expedition Completes First-Stage Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SNOW DRAGON SHIP, July 20 (Xinhua) -- China's first government-
sponsored Arctic expedition team has completed the first stage of
their research in the Chukchi Sea, Arctic Ocean over the past week.
</P>
<P>
The expedition ship has stopped 14 times in the Chukchi Sea for
scientists to study the exchange of water flow between the Arctic
and the Pacific Ocean, and the influence of sea ice on marine
environment, said Qin Weijia, assistant to the chief scientist of
the expedition.
</P>
<P>
Scientists have obtained a large amount of data about the sea
temperature and salinity, according to Qin.
</P>
<P>
Deposits samples containing information about global climate
change have also been collected. Studies of these deposits can
help scientists track ancient environmental and climate changes
and in turn provide information about preventing some natural
disasters.
</P>
<P>
Scientists have also collected plankton samples to study their
growth progress, which will offer precious data on the research of
ecological system of the Arctic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
The densely dotted floating ice in the Arctic Ocean has brought
great difficulties to scientists' research during the previous
week. The team has adjusted its research plan to bring forward its
13-15 day oceanic and fishery resources survey in the Bering Sea
and postpone research in the Arctic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
The team arrived the Bering Sea today to start its second stage
of research. And scientists will wait for an improvement in the
ice conditions, and recross the Arctic Circle.
</P>
<P>
The expedition team left Shanghai at the beginning of this
month, and is expected to return in September.

<HEADLINE> China's Half-Year Interbank Trading up Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Turnover on China's interbank
money market reached 208 billion yuan in the first half of this
year, more than four times that of the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
This includes 72.29 billion yuan in credit, 134.34 billion yuan
in bond repurchase agreements, and 1.42 billion yuan in spot bonds.
</P>
<P>
The weighted average interbank lending rate dropped 3.56
percentage points from the same period of 1998 to 4.2 percent,
with the rate for interbank repurchases falling 3.73 percentage
points to 3.86 percent.
</P>
<P>
Interbank trading was most active for 30-day and 60-day
transactions, with repurchasing most active in 7-day and 14-day
varieties.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attribute the surge in the interbank money market to
the expansion of membership as more financial institutions, such
as rural credit cooperatives, received approval to enter the
market this year.
</P>
<P>
Bond issues totaling 43.4 billion yuan, and a lower lending
rate, have also been conducive to the growth.

<HEADLINE> Northeast City Handles Medical Waste </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Shenyang, capital of northeast
China's Liaoning Province, has become the first Chinese city to
successfully dispose of medical waste.
</P>
<P>
More than ten tons of medical waste are transported in airtight
vehicles from more than 200 city hospitals every day to a
processing plant, where it is then incinerated.
</P>
<P>
A special domestically developed incinerator is used to process
the waste, which can reduce the noxious content to below State-
mandated standards.
</P>
<P>
Hospital waste is regarded as potentially more hazardous than
common garbage, and the Shenyang city government adopted a plan
for the unified disposal of medical waste last year, while urging
local scientists to hasten the development of incinerators to
effectively process such waste.
</P>
<P>
The technology-intensive incinerator was finally developed by
the city's research institute of environment science, and was
built with special incinerator technology designed to process
hazardous waste material.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Manchester United's Andy Cole has
been accused of having an ego problem by Simon Colosimo, an
Australian player who suffered a serious knee injury from Cole's
tackle in the friendly between United and the Australian national
team.
</P>
<P>
Cole's ugly challenge in Sunday's match left Simon Colosimo
with torn knee ligaments and shattered his dreams of playing for
European clubs this year. He was carried from the pitch on a
stretcher after Cole kicked him in the knee with studs raised.
Tests showed that he will need an operation and could be out for
up to six months.
</P>
<P>
"If he kicked me on the shin or the ankle, well that's all part
of the game, but so high up on the knee was malicious," Colosimo
said on Tuesday. "If it had been me I would have gone to see him
and apologized, but I think he's got a bit of an ego."
</P>
<P>
Before leaving Australia for United's matches in Hong Kong,
Cole told reporters that he had nothing to apologize for.
</P>
<P>
Colosimo was considered as one of the most promising Australian
players and he has been communicated with several European clubs
including Bayern Munich and Greek club Panathanaikos. His Carlton
club has suggested it might sue United for the loss of possible
transfer riches.

<HEADLINE> Shanxi Enjoys Steady Increase in Foreign Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, July 20 (Xinhua) -- North China's Shanxi Province has
seen a steady increase in foreign trade during the first six
months this year, with the total volume rising by 22.98 percent
over the same 1998 period to 654 million US dollars worth.
</P>
<P>
Surging imports are the main reason behind the trade growth,
which rocketed by 134.52 percent on an annual basis to 238 million
US dollars worth, according to statistics from the provincial
Customs.
</P>
<P>
Exports dropped by 3.28 percent to 416 million US dollars worth
during the period, compared to the national export decrease of 4.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
General foreign trade continued to grow due to the intensified
crackdown on smuggling, expanded domestic demand and gradual
recovery of the Asian economies.
</P>
<P>
Exports from the State sector stood at 84.5 percent of the
total, valued at 351 million US dollars. Solely overseas-funded
ventures, on the other hand, saw their exports surge by 58.14
percent to 22 million US dollars worth.
</P>
<P>
The United States remained the leading trade partner of Shanxi,
followed by Germany and the Republic of Korea. Exports to the
United States rose by 7.54 percent to 54 million US dollars worth
during the January-June period, while imports from the country
totaled 98.49 million US dollars, a 7.5 percent rise over the same
1998 period.
</P>
<P>
Substantial growth was also reported in export of chemical
products, pulp and paper-made products, and optical and medical
apparatus during the period.

<HEADLINE> Windmills in Prairie Bring Light to Inland Herdsman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Thousands upon thousands of
windmills scattering on the prairie in north China's Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region are bringing joy to some one million
local farmers and herdspeople, who were used to the whistling wind
but never thought of using it to generate electricity to their own
benefit.
</P>
<P>
"If it were not for the windmill generators, we cannot watch TV,
and lighting at night is still be a problem," said a herdsman
sitting inside his tent enjoying TV together with his three
children. Outside his tent, a 200 kilowatt wind-driven generator
kept turning like the propeller of a small helicopter.
</P>
<P>
"Wind generators are far cheaper than diesel-consuming motors
and, besides they are noiseless and free of smog," he said. Many
of his herdsfolk living in remote grasslands depend on windmill
generators nowadays for their daily-use electrical power.
</P>
<P>
The wind power was tapped on this land-locked prairie with the
erection of wind power plants. Five such plants have been emerged
since late 1980s, and the total installment capacity reached 46,
000 kilowatts by the end of last year, generating 100 million kwh
of electrical power annually.
</P>
<P>
Funding from overseas including government loans from Denmark
and the Netherlands and loans from the Export and Import Bank of
the United States have contributed to nearly 20,000 kilowatts in
installment capacity, according to Qi Laisheng, president of the
Inner Mongolia Wind Power Co. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Qi said, new loans totaling 146 million US dollars
from the World Bank and Danish, Dutch and Spanish governments
contributed to an additional, planned installment capacity of 220,
000 kilowatts.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the wind resources in Inner Mongolia are still
far from being explored to the fullest extent. The wind power
potential could exceed 100 million kilowatts in capacity in the
region, compared to the current 46,000 kilowatts in installment
capacity, estimated experts from China Meteorological
Administration.
</P>
<P>
"Inner Mongolia is expected to overtake the Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region in terms of installment capacity in one or two
years' time and turn itself into the country's largest wind power
base," Qi Laisheng noted.
</P>
<P>
Energy experts are currently conducting feasibility studies on
setting up a large wind power plant in Inner Mongolia to transmit
electricity to the capital of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"If this plan is proved feasible, some of the thermal power
plants in and around the Chinese capital will be removed, thus
substantially reduce the severe smog pollution in Beijing," Qi
said.

HANOI, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam earned more than 1.36

first half of this year, a fall of 13.2 percent year-on-year,
Vietnam's business daily The Saigon Times Daily reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In the period, trading companies under Vietnam's Ministry of
Agriculture and Rural Development achieved a combined export
turnover of 519.3 million dollars, a drop of 26.9 percent compared
to the corresponding period last year.
</P>
<P>
Export of fruit and vegetables alone achieved a turnover of
32.7 million dollars.

<P>
Income from major export items decreased from the year ago
period, including cashew nuts by 39.1 percent, tea by 11.9 percent
and rice by 7.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The decline was caused mainly by falling prices of agricultural
and forestry products in the world markets. In addition, the
recent adverse weather also affected crop yields and quality,
reducing their commercial value.

excessive stockpiling of these apartments in the island province
of Hainan. The rest of the country will benefit if this effort
succeeds.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the plan, the central government will also
earmark 400 billion yuan to cover the gap of land transfer fees
left by sales of stockpiled apartments at the prices for ordinary
apartments.
</P>
<P>
The construction scale of open-market apartments in Hainan has
climbed to 36.69 million sq. m. since the island was separated
from south China's Guangdong Province and became a province in its
own right in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, 16.86 million sq. m. of apartments were completed,
1.44 million sq. m. are being constructed, and construction of
another 11.35 million sq. m. was stopped or postponed, and the
building of other 7.04 million sq. m. was never realized.
</P>
<P>
In the past decade, only 9.74 million sq. m. of commercial
apartments were sold, and 7.03 million sq. m. of apartments remain
unsold.
</P>
<P>
In Hainan alone, some 50.6 billion yuan has stagnated in the
real estate sector owing to unsold open-market apartments, and
postponed construction and land acquisition, said local sources.

LUSAKA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- A meeting of military experts which
is expected to culminate into the establishment of a Joint
Military Commission (JMC) on the Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC) failed to start in Lusaka Monday because rebels and Rwandan
officials did not arrive on time.
</P>

The belligerent nations involved in the nearly one-year-old
conflict include Zimbabwe, Namibia, Angola, Uganda and Rwanda.

Two ministers from each country and two senior army officers
would constitute the JMC.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Shaanxi Attracts More Overseas Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, July 20 (Xinhua) -- A total of 239,184 overseas tourists
visited northwest China's Shaanxi Province in the first half of
this year, increasing by 24 percent over the same period of last
year.
</P>
<P>
Of the tourists, 43,614 came from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao,
up 33.57 percent from the first six months of last year, according
to Shaanxi Provincial Tourism Bureau.
</P>
<P>
With more foreign visitors coming, the province's foreign
exchange earned from the tourism industry was also up by 24
percent compared to the same period of last year, the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
Shaanxi province, particularly its capital city of Xi'an, is
famous for its ancient terra cotta soldiers and numerous other
ancient sites of historical interest.
</P>
<P>
Japan was still the country that contributed the largest number
of foreign tourists to Shaanxi, followed by the United States.
</P>
<P>
From January to June this year, the tourists from Japan and the
United States recorded an increase of 39.23 percent and 34 percent
respectively over the same period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Local tourism officials attributed the record number of
tourists to this year's promotion campaign abroad, improvement of
the province's tourism management and more tourists form Asian
countries, such as the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Indonesia and
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the number of tourists form these countries sharply
decreased because of the financial crisis that dealt a hard blow
to the region's economy.
</P>
<P>
The province has also been successful in attracting investment
from both home and abroad to develop its tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
During the '99 China East-West Cooperation and Investment Trade
Fair held here in early April, Shaanxi secured contracts for 41
projects, with a total investment of 4.498 billion yuan.

WELLINGTON, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Meningitis has claimed six
victims of the nearly 200 people infected with the disease so far
this year in New Zealand, a country with a population of about 3.8
million.
</P>
<P>
The Dominion Tuesday quoted New Zealand health officials as
saying that worse could be to come with July to September usually
having the highest rates of meningitis.
</P>

AMMAN, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Jordan on Tuesday denied it is
holding behind-the-scenes talks with the Palestinians on the
establishment of a Jordanian-Palestinians confederation.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Information and government spokesman Nasser Lawzi
said no discussion about the confederation has taken place
between Jordan and the Palestinians though the two sides enjoy a
strong and solid relationship, Jordan's semi-official Jordan Times
reported.
</P>
<P>
The minister firmly denied press reports that Jordan and the
Palestinians are planning to pursue the confederation
negotiations in parallel with Palestinian-Israeli final status
talks.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated Jordan's official policy that the kingdom will
form a confederation with the Palestinians until an independent
Palestinian state is proclaimed with Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has repeatedly rejected Palestinian initiatives to set
up a confederation for fears it might create social and political
turmoil among the predominantly Palestinian population of the
desert kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Some 60 percent of Jordan`s 4.77 million population are of
Palestinian origin.

<P>
SHENZHEN, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Experts invited to draw up urban
water-system planning for this original special economic zone have
sent out an alert that Shenzhen could be faced with a water
shortage in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
The city receives accumulated precipitation of over 1,800 mm. a
year. But with no water conservation facility to preserve the
water, the actual per-capita water resource accounts for only 25
percent of the country's average level.
</P>
<P>
"There may be a shortfall of some one billion cu.m. of water by
the year 2010," the experts here forecast.
</P>
<P>
In order to substantially solve this problem, Shenzhen is
constructing a water-conducting project to introduce Dongjiang
River water from some 50-60 km. away, since Shenzhen is without
its own river resource.
</P>
<P>
Experts are also working on ways to refine sea water and
recycle sewage.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Honors External Debt Obligations: Finance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Kenya never defaulted on its
undertakings and will continue to always honor external debt
obligations as they fall due, Kenyan Finance Minister Francis
Masakhalia has said.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Nation newspaper said Monday that Kenya had defaulted
on its external debt obligations to the tune of 4.6 billion
shillings (61 million U.S. dollars) owed to bilateral creditors by
the end of June.
</P>
<P>
The minister said in a statement faxed to the press Monday
evening that the government was unable to pay about four billion
shillings (52 million dollars) in principal and interest on
external debt because of " administrative delays."
</P>
<P>
About three billion shillings (40 million dollars) of this debt
"has as of today been already settled, and arrangements are in
place to clear the remaining balance in the course of this week,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
He further explained that the current "delays in payment have
nothing to do with lack of foreign exchange."
</P>
<P>
Masakhalia noted that the Central Bank of Kenya's "foreign
reserves now stand at 580 million dollars and are therefore enough
to meet all government external obligations for many months."
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that Kenya never defaulted on its undertakings
and will continue to honor external debt obligations.

<P>
TEHRAN, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Five persons working for moderate
dailies have been arrested on charge of involvement in recent
unrest in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
An informed source said the five people are from Zan (women),
Khordad (name of the third Iranian month), Neshat (Joy), and Azad
(Freedom), the favorite dailies of the Iranian people,
particularly of the youth, the pro-conservative daily Tehran Times
reported on Tuesday.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Hainan, China's southernmost island
province, increased its forest cover to 1.73 million hectares by
the end of last year thanks to the provincial government's
afforestation and environmental protection efforts.
</P>
<P>
According to the provincial forestry bureau, the province's
forestry cover grew from 38 percent over a decade ago to 51
percent by the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Hainan, China's biggest special economic zone, gained
provincial status in 1998 and has since maintained a forestry
policy with an emphasis on "protection, reforestation, and
development."
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the province issued regulations banning logging and
grazing on hillsides, increasing its tropical forests to 600,000
hectares from 380,000 more than a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
The province has also completed the construction of a 1,500-
kilometer-long coastal shelterbelt, turning former wastelands into
greenery.

<P>
To date, the province has planted new forests covering 733,000
hectares, 466,000 of which are dedicated to cash plants, such as
rubber and fruit trees, according to the provincial forestry
bureau.

<P>
HARARE, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean Ministry of Lands
and Agriculture has received a grant of nine million U.S. dollars
from the British government for the implementation of the
three-year Agricultural Services Management Project.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural project seeks to identify and rationalize the
functions of the ministry and increase stakeholder consultation,
Zimbabwean daily Herald reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Its main goal, however, is to improve the performance of the
agricultural sector, especially small-holder farmers, and to
prepare the ground for a full Agricultural Sector Investment
Program in three years.
</P>
<P>
At the signing ceremony held Monday in Harare, British High
Commissioner to Zimbabwe Peter Longworth said the grant showed
Britain's commitment to poverty reduction in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
"The project will make a valuable contribution to improved
efficiency and services to poor farmers, and thus to the reduction
of poverty, especially in the rural areas," said Longworth.
</P>
<P>
The project is being co-funded by contributions from the
Zimbabwean government, the European Commission, the World Bank and
the Department for International Development. The total cost of
the projects is estimated at 31 million U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Price Decline Hits Shrimp Production in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's shrimp production and
export have been severely hit by a sharp price decline in the
international market since early June, incurring heavy losses to
both local exporters and producers.
</P>
<P>
The prices of shrimps declined to 6.8 U.S. dollars per pound
from nine dollars in early June, said Salahuddin Ahmed, vice
president of the Bangladesh Frozen Food Exporters Association, The
Business Independent daily reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
As a result, local exporters had lost over 1 billion taka
(about 20.2 million dollars) so far this year, said Salahuddin,
who is also a shrimp producer.
</P>
<P>
The foreign currency income from the sector, an important
foreign exchange earner of the country, might decrease if the
price slump in the international market continued, he said.
</P>
<P>
The loss could be covered up if production in the local shrimp
cultivation projects was boosted, he said, adding that the
production should be increased 25 percent to cover the loss,
considering the nearly 25-percent fall in prices.
</P>
<P>
The country earned 13,285.6 million taka (about 268.4 million
dollars) by exporting some 24,500 tons of frozen shrimps during
the 1998-99 fiscal year ending on July 30.

<HEADLINE> Breakthrough in Protection of Ancient Structures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, July 20 (Xinhua) -- China has made a breakthrough in
reinforcing ancient structures made of earth, sources said here
today.
</P>
<P>
To date, the country has successfully consolidated a number of
well-known ancient earthen structures with a special protective
material called high modulus potassium silicate (PS).
</P>
<P>
The technique was developed by a group of Chinese scientists in
northwest China's Gansu Province headed by Li Zuixiong, deputy
director of the Dunhuang Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
They tried the material first on the ruins of an ancient city
in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region after first
testing it in the laboratory. They then reinforced an ancient site
at Banpo and the museum of terra-cotta warriors unearthed from the
tomb of Emperor Qin Shihuang in Shaanxi Province and an ancient
tomb at Sanmenxia in Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
"This material is low cost and easy to use, so it has a bright
future," Li said.
</P>
<P>
China has a great number of ancient earthen structures, most
which are located along the ancient Silk Road in northwest China
including the ancient city of Jiaohe in Xinjiang, Banpo village in
Shaanxi Province, and Yumen Pass in Dunhuang. Of great historic
significance, many of these sites have been damaged by rain and
wind over the years.
</P>
<P>
Repairing them with the PS materials forms a protective layer
to guard them against the ravages of wind erosion. The appearance
of these buildings will remain basically the same, Li said.

<P>
AMMAN, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Spanish Prime Minister
Jose Maria Aznar has promised support for Jordan in the Middle
East peace process while consolidating bilateral ties in
political and economic fields.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference Monday night with his
Jordanian counterpart Abdel Raouf al-Rawabdeh in Amman, Aznar said
Jordan "could always count on the active and positive role of
Spain" in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
``We enormously appreciate Jordan's moderation and stability
and its untiring contribution to the peace process," the Spanish
minister said.
</P>
<P>
Aznar arrived in Amman late Monday for a two-day visit after
concluding his visit to Syria where he held talks with Syrian
President Hafez al-Assad on the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Both Aznar and al-Rawabdeh believed that the Middle East peace
process is going through a positive stage after Ehud Barak was
sworn in as Israel's new prime minister earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
They said the current sense of optimism must be translated
into tangible peace moves since Barak has pledged to comply with
all agreements with the Palestinians, and vowed to resume peace
talks with Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Aznar said he has held very positive and encouraging talks in
Damascus, and both Syrian President al-Assad and Israeli Prime
Minister Barak showed "clear determination" not to waste the
positive momentum in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers also pledged to strengthen political,
economic and cultural cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish premier is expected to meet Jordanian King
Abdullah Bin Hussein Tuesday before leaving Amman for Lebanon to
continue his Middle East tour, which will also take him to
Israel and the Palestinian-self-rule areas.

<P>
KATHMANDU, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The Home Ministry has revised
its tourist and business visa fees and changed the current
trekking permit issuing system in line with the new budget for the
1999-2000 fiscal year, The Rising Nepal daily reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted the Home Ministry as saying that those who
want multi-entry business visa for a period of one year and five
years will be charged an amount equivalent to 100 and 250 U.S.
dollars respectively in Nepalese currency. Five-year multiple
business visa is provided for foreign investors for the first
time.
</P>
<P>
The visas can be obtained from the Immigration Department on
recommendation of the Industry Ministry, the paper added.
</P>
<P>
"Single entry tourist visa can be obtained from the entry
points of Nepal or from Royal Nepalese diplomatic missions abroad
by paying 30 U.S. dollars for 60 days," The Home Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Visitors who wish to obtain the facility of single, double or
multiple re-entry can get it by paying an additional 25, 40 and 60
U.S. dollars respectively, according to the Home Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Visitors who visited Nepal earlier with tourist visa and want
to visit again within 150 days of the same visa year can obtain
re-entry visa by paying 50 U.S. dollars for 30 days, while those
who wish to stay longer than 60 days will pay the amount
equivalent to 50 U.S. dollars in Nepalese currency for another 30
days.
</P>

WASHINGTON, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. space shuttle Columbia
's historic mission with the first woman commander was aborted
Tuesday morning just six seconds before the launch when the

stopped the count-down.
</P>
<P>
Launch controllers detected high levels of hydrogen in an aft

<P>
The crew was reportedly in no danger and launch controllers
will now assess the situation, find out what went wrong and
determine whether they can schedule another launch in the next 24
hours.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Women's World Cup Soccer Team Visits White House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The United States women's
soccer team, which won the World Cup on July 10, visited the White
House and met President Bill Clinton here today.
</P>
<P>
Clinton spoke of the excitement during the team's championship,
which culminated with a victory over China on penalty kicks.
</P>
<P>
"The Women's World cup champions brought America to its feet,
had us screaming our lungs out with pride and joy," he said. "They
also didn't spare us the suspense."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the winning goal made him "actually almost fell
out of the sky box. The day after the game, a lot of us who aren't
so young anymore were trying to search the whole, cluttered attic
of our memories to try to think if there was ever a time when
there had been a more exciting climax to an athletic event that
meant as much to so many. I'm not sure that, in my lifetime, there
has been."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he was on the edge of his seat during the final at
the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California. He mentioned the game-
saving header by Kristine Lilly, a stopped penalty shot by
goalkeeper Briana Scurry and Brandi Chastain's championship-
clinching goal as highlights.
</P>
<P>
But a CNN video tape proved that the goal Lilly cleared out
during the extra time has been inside the goalmouth-line entirely.
That means China would have claimed the triumph if the referee had
seen it. Scurry also broke the rule by moving forward before China
's Liu Ying hit the penalty.
</P>
<P>
However, Wang Junsheng, a deputy chairman of the Chinese Soccer
Association, made a statement that China won't make an official
complaint toward the FIFA about the controversial goals.

<HEADLINE> Explosive Thrown at Home of Paraguay's Newspaper Director </HEADLINE>

<P>
BUENOS AIRES, July 19 (Xinhua) -- An explosive device blew up
early Monday morning at the residence of Paraguay's ABC Daily
newspaper director Aldo Zucolillo. There were no reports of injury
or damage.
</P>
<P>
The device was thrown into the garden where it exploded and
left a mark in a six square-meter area, police said.
</P>
<P>
The explosion took place a day after the ABC Daily published
results of an investigation related to an alleged arrangement
between a judge and a supposed witness regarding the death of Vice-
President Luis Maria Argana.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here from Asuncion quoted Zucolillo as saying
that it was a threat, but vowed that his publishing work would not
be halted.
</P>
<P>
The ABC Daily contends that the Paraguayan authorities invented
a false witness in order to incriminate former members of Raul
Cubas' deposed government, who is related to retired general Lino
Oviedo.
</P>
<P>
Cubas resigned on March 28, five days after Argana's death, and
took refuge in Brazil, while Oviedo went into exile in Argentina.

Stroessner in 1984, but reappeared after his fall in 1989.

<P>
BEIJING, July 20 (Xinhua) -- "It is far from enough to just
depend on the government to take care of the aged. We hope every
capable individual can lend a hand to aged people," said an
official with the Ministry of Civil Affairs, today's "China Youth
Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
China's aged population reached 120 million this year, and is
expected to reach 132 million next year, which has been designated
the year for entering aging society by the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
The number of elderly people is growing in China, with scores
of millions added every year, 15 percent of whom are unable to
support themselves. The government cannot provide help for all of
them, as the civil affairs departments can only provide beds for
only seven out of one thousand in the elderly population, while
developed countries have beds for three to eight percent of their
elderly population.
</P>
<P>
Dou Yupei, a Civil Affairs Ministry official, said that China
needs at least 200 billion U.S. dollars to be able to provide beds
for three percent of its elderly population.
</P>
<P>
Xu Ruixin, vice-minister of Civil Affairs, said that it is
extremely difficult to provide adequate assistance only from the
government and social welfare organizations.
</P>
<P>
There are over 42,000 old-age homes in China, only 600 of which
are non-government run.
</P>
<P>
Xu called for relevant departments to install new regulations
to encourage individuals to operate facilities for the aged, the

<HEADLINE> PLA Helps Build 140 Hydro-Electric Stations in Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The People's Liberation Army (PLA)
and armed police in Tibet have helped construct over 140 hydro-
electric stations there over the past 40 years.
</P>
<P>
Before the implementation of the Democratic Reform in 1959,
Tibet did not have a single power station.
</P>
<P>
The PLA has regarded support for hydro-power-station building
in Tibet as one of the major task for building a prosperous Tibet.
</P>
<P>
In 1959, the PLA was entrusted with building Tibet's first
large-scale hydro-electric station in Ngachen, and after its
completion in 1965, Tibet had its first-ever power supply.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the PLA has been providing large numbers of troops,
supplies, and motor vehicles to help build these stations in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Since the late 1980s, the armed police troops in Tibet have
also been playing a major role in helping Tibet with power-station
construction.
</P>
<P>
A hydro-power unit of the armed police built a high altitude
hydro-electric station in the plateau areas of northern Tibet in
1993, bringing a power supply to Nagqu Prefecture.
</P>
<P>
The armed police also spent six years in building the Yamzho
Yumco hydro-electric station located at an altitude of 5,800
meters. This station has significantly increased the power supply
in Lhasa, capital of Tibet, and provides electricity to other
parts of the region as well.
</P>
<P>
The border troops have also contributed to providing a power
supply to 5,665 families of farmers and herdsmen living in the
border areas.

<HEADLINE> China Opens New Investment Channels for Insurers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 20 (Xinhua) -- China's insurance firms have
recently been given the green light to buy bonds issued by
enterprises directly under the control of the central government
and those of enterprises with credit ratings above AA+, sources
said here today.
</P>
<P>
This marks another major step taken by the government to ease
the pressure on insurance firms in their effort to find reliable
and lucrative ways to invest their huge premium income, following
the approval in October 1998 of their right to enter the inter-
bank bonds market.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are only three enterprise bonds that insurers
are able to buy. These are the bonds issued by the Ministry of
Railways, the China State Power Corporation, and the China Yangtze
Three Gorges Project Development Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Such bonds held by insurers are limited to 10 percent of their
total assets, according to standards set by the China Insurance
Regulatory Commission.
</P>
<P>
China's Insurance Law allows insurers to invest in only three
areas, including bank deposits, government and financial bonds,
and sectors that will be approved by the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Su Su, an official with the Beijing-based New China Life
Insurance Co., Ltd., said her company welcomes the new move, but
added that the three bonds are apparently too small, compared with
the huge funds held by insurers.
</P>
<P>
She said New China and other insurance firms have already
invested in these bonds.
</P>
<P>
The government is now under increasing pressure to open new
areas of investment to insurers, who have been hit hard by the
central bank's seven consecutive interest rate cuts since 1996.
</P>
<P>
A possible new area might be securities investment funds, a
relatively new investment tool in China, and an area that has
drawn heated discussions in the media recently.
</P>
<P>
But sources here said insurers may not show much interest in
such funds because of their disappointing performance in the past.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Foreign Exchange Reserves Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's net foreign exchange
reserves decreased by 281 million U.S. dollars to 16.1 billion
dollars on July 15 compared to the previous week's level, Bank
Indonesia said in its weekly indicator report.
</P>
<P>
The drop was mainly due to the repayment of government foreign
debts, The Jakarta Post Tuesday quoted the report as saying.
</P>
<P>
But Bank Indonesia said its net international reserves were
still above the International Monetary Fund-adjusted target of
14.7 billion dollars despite the drop.
</P>
<P>
Gross international reserves, which are net foreign exchange
reserves plus outstanding foreign exchange contracts, also dropped
295.8 million dollars to 26.6 billion dollar during the week, the
central bank said.

<HEADLINE> Russia Returns Border Defense to Kirghizstan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Russia has agreed to relinquish
the defense of Kirghizstan's borders to Kirghizstan, whose borders
have been guarded by Russian border guards since the
disintegration of the former Soviet Union in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Agreements on the turnover and bilateral cooperation on future
border issues were signed by Konstantin Totsky, director of the
Russian Federal Border Service, and Kirghiz Defense Minister
Myrzakan Usurkanovich Subanov Sunday in the Kirghiz capital of
Bisket, said reports reaching here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Totsky told reporters that the withdrawal of Russian border
guards from Kirghizstan did not mean "the loss of Russia's
influence in Central Asia."
</P>
<P>
Under the agreements, he said, Russian forces will continue to
stay in the Central Asian state to help it cope with problems in
the establishment of its border force and its border defense.
</P>
<P>
Russia will also help train Kirghizstan's military personnel
and gratuitously turn over all the equipment of its border guards
to the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
The two countries will complete the turnover process by August
25.
</P>
<P>
Russia and Kirghizstan began negotiations on the turnover of
border defense after Kirghiz President Askar Aakayevich Akayev
ordered the establishment of the country's border service.

<HEADLINE> Hainan to Explore China's Farm Produce Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Hainan Province Governor Wang
Xiaofeng pledged that his province would continue to explore China
's farm produce market and strive to achieve a goal of making the
per capita national annual consumption volume of fruits and
vegetables produced in Hainan exceed two kg by the year of 2000.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who made the remark at a recent forum, disclosed that a
plan for establishing a through-train-style roller ship service
between Hainan Island and Hong Kong to facilitate transportation
of fresh fruits and vegetables out of Hainan is under study.
</P>
<P>
The unique tropical climate has turned Hainan into a natural
greenhouse of China. From last winter to this spring, 94,666
hectares of off-season fruits and vegetables were planted in the
island province and 1.93 million tons of off-season fruits and
vegetables were harvested, with the output value estimated at five
billion yuan (600 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Of the total output, 1.639 million tons or 1.639 billion kg of
off-season fruits and vegetables were shipped out of Hainan Island
from last November to this May, which meant that every Chinese
citizen ate more than one kg of fruits and vegetables from Hainan
in that period of time. And 150,000 tons of the shipment were sold
to the Hong Kong market.
</P>
<P>
Local farmers of Hainan earned a per capita net income of 329
yuan from the planting alone, said local sources.
</P>
<P>
Relevant State departments moved in to give a helping hand by
introducing a green-channel system from Haikou to Beijing and to
Shanghai to facilitate a quick shipment of fresh fruits and
vegetables out of Hainan.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Receive Massive Amount of Foreign Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka will receive nearly 40
billion rupees (570 million U.S. dollars) in foreign aid for its
economic and infrastructure development effort before the end of
the year, official press said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Daily News quoted a spokesman for the Ministry of Finance as
saying that it follows successful negotiations conducted with
foreign governments and monetary and donor agencies.
</P>
<P>
The pledging of such a large amount of foreign aid by developed
countries and monetary agencies is seen as confidence placed by
them in the resilience of Sri Lanka's economy and its development
prospects, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
A part of the total aid to be received is outright grants
while the balance is on very low concessionary rates of interest.
</P>
<P>
The foreign aid will be used to improve education, health and
infrastructure facilities such as electricity, telecommunication
and water supply and for the development of agriculture and
industry.
</P>
<P>
It will also be used to provide housing and other welfare
facilities for people in the war affected areas of the north and
east.
</P>
<P>
At the Aid-Sri Lanka consortium group meeting in 1998, aid
pledges totaling little over 700 million dollars were made by
donors to the Sri Lanka.

<HEADLINE> Bulgarian Air Force Receives US-made Helicopters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PLOVDIV, Bulgaria, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The Bulgarian air force
has added two U.S.-made Bell 206 helicopters to its fleet. The
planes landed Monday at the Kroumovo air base in Southern Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
The arrival of the two training helicopters marked the start
of the process that would enable Bulgaria to upgrade its military
equipment to meet the requirements of trans-Atlantic integration,
said Chief of General Staff Miho Mihov, who was among the military
officials to meet the helicopters at the air base.
</P>
<P>
Under a deal between the Bulgarian Defense Ministry and the U.S.
aircraft maker Bell Helicopters Textron, another four Bell 206
helicopters for transport purposes are expected in the months to
come.
</P>
<P>
Equipped with medical equipment, these planes, earmarked to the
fleet of the 24th air base, could be used in rescue operations and
other peace-time and military missions.
</P>
<P>
Bell 206 helicopters are state-of-the-art machines used by
over 100 countries across the world. A Bell 206 American pilot
performed the first solo flight across the Atlantic in 1983,
flying 56,742 kilometers in 320 hours.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Coach Feels Pressure as Moment of Truth Comes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Sportswriter Cao Jianjie
</P>
<P>
BEIJING, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Table Tennis is hailed as China's
national game and Chinese fans will accept nothing less than a
clean title sweep in the coming World Table Tennis Championships.
</P>
<P>
Chinese head coach Cai Zhenhua feels pressure.
</P>
<P>
"A clean title sweep is very, very difficult, but we are
working for it," said Cai, a member of China all-conquering 1981
squad who took the helm of a men's team in decline in 1991 and
became head coach for both the men's and women's team last year.
</P>
<P>
China will send the youngest ever team to early the 45th World
Table Tennis Championships to be held early August in Eindhoven,
the Netherlands. The current team is comprised of 11 men and 12
women players with the oldest only 24.
</P>
<P>
China owes its everlasting dominance in table tennis to an
inexhaustible source of young promising players and future
champions. Almost in every world championships, China sends a
reshuffled team with quite a few new faces.
</P>
<P>
The Eindhoven-bound men's team are spearheaded by Kong Linghui
and Liu Guoliang, ranked second and third in the world. Wang Nan
and Li Ju, world top two players, head the women's squad.
</P>
<P>
Kong was 1995 world champion and World Cup winner and Liu was
the dual Olympic champion in 1996 when he also won the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
The man set to shine in the world championships is Wang Liqin,
tipped by pundits as champion-elect.
</P>
<P>
Wang plays quite a simple game with exceptional ball control
and fluid movement, powerful two wing loops and drives plus
effective spin services that set himself up. He receives a
special daily training session from head coach Cai, just as Kong
did two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Wang, a losing quarter-finalist to current world No. 1 Vladimir
Samsonov of Belarus, is burning with hunger and vengeance. Besides
the lanky Belarussian, his teammates Kong and Liu, reigning world
champion Jan-Ove Waldner of Sweden and World Cup holder Zoran
Primorac of Croatia could be barriers on his climb to the top.
</P>
<P>
Ma Lin is the other Chinese to watch in the championships.
Teenager Ma, who plays an aggressive topspin game in penhold grip,
caught world attention as he beat Waldner in the World Club
Championships in June.
</P>
<P>
Kong and Liu, who combined to win the Olympic doubles title in
1996, and Wang Li Qin and Yan Sen, the winners of the ITTF Pro-
Tour crown, are heavily favored for the men's doubles title in
Eindhoven.
</P>
<P>
China has a sure shot at the women's singles title since Wang
Nan, Li Ju and rising star Zhang Yiying are nearly invisible in
international games.
</P>
<P>
Chinese women's doubles pairs could meet some difficulty from
South Korea who boasts two world-class duos. The mixed doubles
title will certainly go to China which has the best combinations
of the world.

<HEADLINE> Latin American Exporters: No Auction System for Banana Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, July 19 (Xinhua)-- Latin American banana exporters
reject the possibility of selling banana on the European Union (EU)
market through an auction system, Costa Rican Vice Foreign Trade
Minister Anabel Gonzalez said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
An auction system "would cause the market big harm and is not
acceptable," said Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
The EU will define, in the coming weeks, a new set of rules for
the import of banana, after the World Trade Organization (WTO)
rejected the quote system the EU had been applying since six years
ago.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica and Colombia, that hold almost half of the EU's
banana quota, have demanded that their acquired rights be
recognized, but met opposition from Panama and Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
Banana exporting countries met last Friday in Panama to analyze
the situation and made known their stance on this issue, he added.
</P>
<P>
EU established a system of quotas for the import of banana from
Latin America with the objective of protecting the production of
their former Caribbean, Asian and African colonies.
</P>
<P>
But WTO's decision to reject the quota system and calls for the
system's revision have worried Latin American banana exporters.

<HEADLINE> Red Tide Hits Chinese Coasts Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Large areas of red tide have been
detected along both the northern and southern Chinese coasts,
ringing an alarm bell again to Chinese who care about marine
environment.
</P>
<P>
The State Oceanic Administration (SOA) has detected red tide
measuring 680 square kilometers in sea waters to the south of
Dalian, in northeast China's Liaoning Province, according to today
's China Daily report. The spot is not far from the Bohai Sea
where 6,300 sq. km. of red tide had just ebbed away.
</P>
<P>
The red tide in waters along south China's Guangdong coasts was
first spotted in Raoping on July 10 and has rapidly spread to
cover 400 sq. km. since last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Marine scientists who have yet to determine whether the
disastrous red tide algae would spread further advised local
fishermen to move fish and other aquatic products to safe waters.
</P>
<P>
Red tide occurred in the same area of Guangdong between
November 1997 and January 1998, causing some 60 million yuan (7.2
million U.S. dollars) in economic losses.

ROME, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Two-time world champion Michael
Schumacher has returned to his home in Switzerland with a good
condition after surgery on his broken leg and nearly a week in a
Swiss clinic, Ferrari said in Naranello, Italy, on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Italian Formula One team released a statement saying
doctors treating Schumacher were "impressed" by his potential for
recovery.

<P>
Schumacher broke his right leg in two places in a high-speed,
head-on crash into a tire wall at the British Grand Prix on July

</P>
<P>
Surgeons at a Britain's hospital last week inserted a 30-

<P>
Schumacher is expected to be out of racing for about three

SANTIAGO, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Sales in Chile's Free Zone of

<HEADLINE> China's Largest Kinescope Factory Increases Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The Caihong Color Kinescope Factory,
China's largest base for the production of this key television
component, increased its production and exports by big margins in
the first six months of this year.
</P>
<P>
The factory, located in Xianyang, in northwest China's Shaanxi
Province, produced four million color kinescopes in the first half
of this year, an increase of 32 percent over the same period of
last year.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, the factory exported 1.09 million color
kinescopes, earning 30.47 million US dollars in foreign exchange,
up 31 percent and 8.2 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Wu Weiren, the factory's director, attributed the increase in
production and exports to the factory's continuous efforts to
improve quality, lower production costs and apply new technology.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that, since its establishment some 20 years ago, the
state-owned plant has won national prizes for the high quality of
its products. Now it is China's only color kinescope factory with
an ISO 9000 certificate.
</P>
<P>
Since 1997, the supply of color kinescopes has surpassed the
demand on both the international and domestic markets, bringing
about a sharp decrease in the price of this product. But the
Caihong Color Kinescope Factory has managed to offset the lowered
price by cutting its production costs, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
With the application of new technology and improvement of its
management system, the factory cut its production costs by 21
percent last year, according to Wu.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that the factory earmarks nearly 100 million yuan (120,
000 US dollars) each year for cooperation with China's prestigious
universities, such as Qinghua University and Xi'an Communications
University, to improve its technology for producing kinescopes.
He added that such efforts have been paying off.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Largest Islamic Organization Congratulates PDI-P </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's largest Islamic
organization Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) has congratulated the Indonesian
Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) for its victory in the June 7
general election.
</P>
<P>
After addressing a seminar on women's leadership in a religious
perspective and political culture in Semarang, capital of Central
Java, on Monday, NU top executive Said Aqiel Siradj said NU allows
a woman to be president.
</P>
<P>
Based on a polling station result, involving 100 ulemas from
Java, Madura and Bali, Siradj said 70 of them agreed that a woman
could be a president, while 20 rejected the view and the rest
abstained.
</P>
<P>
In his address, Siradj reminded that Islam was brought by
Prophet Muhammad to the human race to fight discrimination between
man and woman.
</P>
<P>
However, NU left the presidential matter to the People's
Consultative Assembly (MPR), the country's highest decision-making
body, Siradj was quoted by the Antara News Agency Tuesday as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The 500 legislators along with another 200 appointed MPR
members will cast their votes in a presidential election set to
take place in November this year.
</P>
<P>
In his address to a seminar on gender in Purwokerto, Central
Java, last week, NU Chairman Abdurrahman Wahid said NU would
support PDI-P chairwoman Megawati Soekarnoputri for president,
arguing that Islam did not oppose female presidents.
</P>
<P>
The National Awakening Party (PKB) Chairman Matori Abdul Djalil
said with the statement of the party's founder that PKB would back
up Megawati in the next presidential election. Wahid, who is
better known as Gus Dur, is the PKB founder.
</P>
<P>
"With Gus Dur's decision, PKB fully supports Megawati in the
next presidential election. And we have prepared a coalition to
support her," Matori added.
</P>
<P>
The country's second largest Islamic organization Muhammadiyah
has said it will accept whoever becomes president so long as he or
she is elected by the MPR.
</P>
<P>
In the provisional vote count completed on July 15, PDI-P won
the elections and secured 154 of the 462 contested seats for the
House of Representatives (DPR). Golkar Party came second with 120
seats, while PKB, the United Development Party (PPP) and the
National Mandate Party (PAN) controlled 51, 39 and 35 seats
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Forty-eight political parties took part in the election to
compete for 462 of the 500 seats in the DPR. The remaining 38
seats are reserved for the military, whose members do not vote.
</P>
<P>
Despite the controversy on the gender issue, only PPP
officially declared that it opposes a female president among the
Islamic parties. Chairman Hamzah Haz said the decision was based
on the edict of PPP's council of ulemas.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Golkar Party Chairman Akbar Tanjung said recently
that the party's support for its presidential candidate B.J.
Habibie remained solid although he acknowledged the defeat his
party suffered in the elections.
</P>
<P>
Golkar had previously congratulated PDI-P for its success.

<HEADLINE> Electrical Appliance Maker Tops 10 Billion Yuan in Half-Year Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QINGDAO, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The Haier Group, one of China's
largest electrical appliance manufacturers, recorded a 35 percent
rise in sales to hit 10.3 billion yuan (1.24 billion US dollars)
during the first half of this year, compared to the same period of
last year.
</P>
<P>
Based in this coastal city in east China's Shandong Province,
Haier reported a 36 percent rise in pre-tax profits and a 126
percent growth in foreign-exchange earnings from exports in the
same period.
</P>
<P>
Despite the great pressure on exports, Haier exported its
products to a total of 87 countries and regions during the first
half of the year, with 60 percent of the exports going to the U.S.
and European markets.
</P>
<P>
During the January-May period, Haier developed 158 new
technologies, 96 of them up to the international level.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, Haier has made big headway in
its overseas operations, and has begun to build a production base
in the United States costing 30 million US dollars in its first
phase, which is expected to turn out 200,000 refrigerators per
year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, within this year Haier is expected to set up an
information industry park and an industrial development park here.
The information park will become the country's sole large-screen
digital color TV production base, and the industrial development
park will focus its development on dish-washers, air-conditioners
for commercial use and robots for industrial use.

<HEADLINE> China Gives Coal Export More Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Exports of coal are being
encouraged to strengthen the profitability of the State's major
coal mines.
</P>
<P>
Tax rebates rates have been increased on coal exports and
incentives have been created for trade agents and large state-
owned coal enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The policies will favor the industry's campaign to turn around
loss-making state-owned enterprises within a couple of years,
today's China Daily quoted some analysts as saying.
</P>
<P>
"To export more coal, we will continue to improve service
levels, enhance management and reduce costs," said an official of
the China National Coal Industry Import and Export Group Corp, the
nation's largest coal exporter.
</P>
<P>
During the first half of the year, China exported 17.79 million
tons of coal, an increase of 24 percent from the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
But the figure failed to reach a half-year goal set by the
industry at the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
"It will not be easy for China to achieve progress in a slack
international market," said Shi Wanpeng, vice-minister of the
State Economic and Trade Commission, at a conference held earlier
this month in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Currency devaluations in some coal-mining nations during the
past two years have enhanced their competitiveness, helping them
to increase their coal exports.
</P>
<P>
This has hampered China in the global coal market although
China's share in the market is rather small, about 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Some developed nations are trying to solve their energy needs
by investing directly in coal-producing nations. With their
supplies secured, there is no need for them to import coal from
China.

will further expand its service in providing loans to Chinese
students who are going abroad to study.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Opposes Scope of U.N. Mission in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia Monday expressed
its objection to the scope of the United Nations mission in
Kosovo, according to its U.N. envoy.
</P>
<P>
Vladislav Jovanovic, charge d'affaires of the Permanent Mission
of Yugoslavia to the United Nations, said a provision for the U.N.
mission in Kosovo known as the UNMIK "constitutes an outright
distortion of the mandate of UNMIK and is a direct violation of
the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia (FRY)."
</P>
<P>
His remarks were contained in his letter to the U.N. Security
Council to comment on U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's report
dated July 12.
</P>
<P>
The letter dated July 16 and released as a Security Council
document on July 19 said the FRY "takes exception to the
definition of the mandate and authority of the mission."
</P>
<P>
It said the the U.N. chief's report de facto suspends the
sovereignty of Yugoslavia in Kosovo and Metohija and provides for
an unlimited mandate of the UNMIK, which constitutes a drastic
violation of Security Council resolution 1244 (1999), said the
letter.
</P>
<P>
Jovanovic said that in certain paragraphs of Annan's report
"UNMIK arrogates the right to select and appoint Serbian
representatives in Kosovo and Metohija" and the Special
Representative of the U.N. Secretary-General "arrogates the right
to change, repeal or suspend the existing laws of the FRY."
</P>
<P>
He also said Annan's report "fails to address or dilutes the
true account of the security situation" in Kosovo after the
arrival of the UNMIK.
</P>
<P>
"It is exactly the maintenance, rather than the weakening of
the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia that the mandate of UNMIK is aimed at," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"The goal of the international security and civil presences in
Kosovo and Metohija is to achieve substantial autonomy and
democratic self-governance in the province rather than the
creation of conditions for a future solution of its political
status," he said.

LONDON, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Stan Collymore has joined Fulham

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 19 (Xinhua) -- England captain Alan Shearer could
end his career in Newcastle when he signed a new deal with the
English Premier League football club on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The contract extension takes the striker, who turns 29 next
month, through to 2004 and the age of 34.
</P>
<P>
He joined his hometown club from Blackburn for a British record
15 million pounds in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Shearer finished the last Premiership season with 21 goals and
has been linked with moves to clubs in England and Italy in the
last year.
</P>
<P>
"Talks have been going on for a while and the deal is right for
both parties," said the England skipper.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone knows what I feel for this football club. I never
wanted to leave. I love it here, I love the area and I love the
people.
</P>
<P>
"I want this football club to be successful and I want to be
part of that, " he said.
</P>
<P>
During the player's time at St James Park, Newcastle have come
agonizingly close to glory.
</P>
<P>
In his first season they were Premiership runners-up, while the
last two seasons have seen defeats in the FA Cup final.

<HEADLINE> Chinese In Netherlands Support One-China Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMSTERDAM, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of the overseas
Chinese, Chinese students and scholars in the Netherlands gathered
here Monday to express their strong support for the one-China
policy and criticize separatist remarks made recently by Taiwan's
Lee Teng-hui.
</P>
<P>
In a symposium called by all Chinese communities in the
country, Hu Yunge, one of the organizers, said overseas Chinese
definitely support the Chinese goverment's Taiwan policy and Lee's
separatist remarks will be doomed to be thwarted by the wheel of
history.
</P>
<P>
"China's unification is the desire of all Chinese in the world.
With Hong Kong and Macao returning to China, it is impossible to
delay the process of tackling the Taiwan issue on the unification
agenda. Lee's wilful act will lead to disastrous consequences to
the Taiwan society and people. Lee must give up his separatist
remarks and acts, otherwise he will be traitor and sinner for the
Chinese nation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lee Teng-hui, leader of the Taiwan authorities, claimed in an
interview with a German radio early this month that his executive
organ has defined the relationship across the Taiwan Straits as
"state-to-state, or at least special state-to-state relations,"
which has been widely slammed by most of the Chinese all over the
world.
</P>
<P>
"Now Lee's true color has been exposed thoroughly. By denying
the one-China principle, his aim is to legalize the divided status
between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits and bring about
confrontation in the two-side relationship. His act will
inevitably undermine peace and stability in the region," Hu said.
</P>
<P>
One of the leaders of overseas Chinese in the Netherlands, Bi
Chuanyou said that Lee's remarks proved that the Taiwanese leader
had repeatedly told lies about his view over China's future
because he had kept saying that he supported the efforts to bring
about the unity of China.
</P>
<P>
A Chinese scholar in Delft University, Huang Shunjiang,
believed that the Chinese government has offered the best peaceful
solution to the Taiwan issue, that is the "one country, two
systems" within a unified China. "This is a bottom line acceptable
by all concerned parties, but Lee's remarks totally denied that.
He is playing with fire."
</P>
<P>
"We strongly support the Chinese government's policy on keeping
the right to resort to force over the Taiwan issue," Huang said.
"If you understand the history of China, you will never give up
force in the course of unification."
</P>
<P>
More than 30 members of the Chinese communities in the
Netherlands attended Monday's meeting. They represented about
100,000 Chinese in this country who believe a stronger and unified
China will be conducive to peace not only in Asia but in the
world, said Hu Yunge.

<HEADLINE> Ince Given Green Light for Middlesbrough </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Frenchman Gerard Houllier's
Liverpool revolution is continuing this week with Paul Ince the
biggest name heading out the door.
</P>
<P>
Liverpool have given Middlesbrough permission to speak to the
outcast and Boro boss Bryan Robson hopes to tie up a deal in the
next few days.
</P>
<P>
Robson is keen to land his former Manchester United team-mate
who has been transfer listed at a knockdown price of around one
million pounds.
</P>
<P>
Robson believes the 31-year-old England midfielder still has
something to offer in the Premiership.
</P>
<P>
He said: "I'm hopeful that we will be able to make a move on
that front this week.
</P>
<P>
"We've spoken to Liverpool and we hope to speak to Paul soon.
</P>
<P>
"It's not that often that a player of his ability becomes
available at the right price and we hope to be able to take
advantage."
</P>
<P>
Ince is the biggest casualty of Houllier's transformation of
the Merseyside club after the former Inter Milan star was publicly
dumped.
</P>
<P>
Houllier left him in England last week to sort out his future
while the squad went to their pre-season training camp in
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Jean-Michel Ferri is set to follow Ince out of Anfield and
close behind him could be misfit striker Sean Dundee.

<HEADLINE> Britain, Italy to Discuss EU Defense Targets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Massimo
D'Alema said here Monday that Britain and Italy would discuss this
week the way for greater integration of European defense forces to
help tackle military crises and peacemaking duties.
</P>
<P>
"We have to see what sort of path we can walk along to bring
some reforms (to European defense policies), in view of the
difficult experience in Kosovo," D'Alema, in London for talks with
British Prime Minister Tony Blair, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said there were a number of social and defense issues to
discuss, including "the building of a dialogue towards a common
path for the European left."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a spokesman for Blair said that the British prime
minister and D'Alema would be "setting a bar above which we have
to get if we are to have a credible, autonomous European defense."
</P>
<P>
During the recent Kosovo conflicts, many European countries
began to recognize their dependence on the United States. After
the war, they started to discuss the possibility of building an
autonomous European defense capability.
</P>
<P>
But neither Britain nor Italy gave concrete details of their
proposals for the new idea of European defense. They said the
first steps could include an audit of military hardware held by
European Union states as well as an assessment of their
procurement needs beyond national requirements.
</P>
<P>
"You have to think through the resource implications of a
common European defense," a Reuters report quoted Blair's
spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The aim (of the talks) is to define some convergence criteria
which have to be similar to those which have been in place for the
European single currency," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said the discussions would cover not only the number of
troops but also their quality.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Barak Welcome Reported Syrian Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton and
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said Monday that they would
welcome Syrian moves to rein in Palestinian groups against Israel.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders, speaking at a joint news conference after two
hours of talks, did not confirm reports that Syria earlier this
month had urged Damascus-based radical groups to abandon their
armed struggle against Israel.
</P>
<P>
But both made clear that they would be pleased by such a move
as Israel aims to resume peace talks with the Palestinians as well
as with Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"We too would like to have more normal relations with Syria and
we would like Syria to be reconciled to all its neighbors in the
region," Clinton said. He called the reported Syrian move a
"positive step."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he intended to contact Syrian President Hafez
Assad following his talks with the Israeli leader to urge the
Syrian leader to seize the opportunity brought by Barak's victory
in the May election.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials declined to say how or when Clinton would
communicate with Assad, saying only that it would be "soon."
</P>
<P>
Barak said he could not confirm that Syrian Vice President
Abdel-Halim Khaddam met leading members of Palestinian radical
groups in Damascus and urged them to abandon armed conflict.
</P>
<P>
But he said that if there was such a meeting as reported, then
"it is of course good news for all of us."

<HEADLINE> Italy's Florence Library Rediscovers Dante's Ashes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The Italian national library in
Italy's central city of Florence announced Monday that a package
containing some of the ashes of one of Italy's most famous poets,
Dante Alighieri, was found buried among the books on one of its
thousands of shelves.
</P>
<P>
The ashes were donated to the library in 1865, the year Dante's
tomb was discovered in another Italian central city of Ravenna,
but the institution somehow lost track of their whereabouts in
1929, starting a 70-year quest to find them again.
</P>
<P>
This was evidently no easy task, given that the library
contains 5,300,000 volumes, but suddenly Monday, two of the
librarians, Carmela Santalucia and Giuseppe Capecci, were tidying
up the shelves in one section when they noticed a strange-looking
envelope poking out from between a couple of books.
</P>
<P>
Closer examination of the 11 cm by 7 cm package revealed it to
be the long-lost relic. There was writing on the outside of the
envelope which read: "The ashes here enclosed were collected from
the cloth on which the box and the bones of Dante Alighieri were
resting."
</P>
<P>
The precious finding included another piece of paper bearing
the faded imprint of Dante's skull.
</P>
<P>
The head of the library, Antonia Ida Fontana, said at a press
conference later on that "the ashes were rediscovered by chance,
lying amongst the shelves on the second floor, in the section
dedicated to rare manuscripts."
</P>
<P>
"It was an incredible moment for everyone," she added.

<HEADLINE> Britain Keeps in Custody Egyptians Wanted in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 19 (Xinhua) -- A British court ordered Monday two
Egyptians who are expected to be in connection with last year's
deadly bombing of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania to
remain in custody to face extradition hearings.
</P>
<P>
A judge remanded the two men, 42-year-old Ibrahim Hussein Abdel
Hadi Eidarous and Adel Mohammed Abdul Almagid Bary, 39, until
August 16, saying that he was concerned the two suspects might try
to flee.
</P>
<P>
"There are substantial grounds for saying that if either were
admitted to bail, they would not attend (trial)," the judge said.
</P>
<P>
The United States wants the two men to face charges of
conspiracy to murder over the bombings on August 7, 1998, which
killed at least 215 people in Nairobi and 11 in Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
The two have been in custody since their arrest on July 11.
</P>
<P>
A female prosecuting lawyer representing the United States
government said Eidarous and Bary were members of a militant group
called the Egyptian Islamic Jihad.
</P>
<P>
She said the group was affiliated with Saudi dissident Osama
bin Laden, accused by the United States of masterminding the
embassy attacks.

<HEADLINE> Barak Wishes Release of Israel's Spy of Pollard: Berger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak has told President Bill Clinton that he wished Jonathan
Pollard be released from his prison sentence on charges of spying
for Israel, National Security Adviser Sandy Berger said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The prime minister did raise" the desire to Clinton during
their talks, Berger told reporters after a joint news conference
by Clinton and Barak. He added that Clinton had made no
commitments on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Berger said Clinton had not yet received a report about Pollard
from White House counsel Charles Ruff, who last November asked the
relevant U.S. government agencies to offer their views on whether
he should be released.
</P>
<P>
"The president has not received the report that was referred to
from Chuck Ruff and made no commitments with regard to it," Berger
said, adding: "The prime minister said it should not be a part of
the peace process."

At the close of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones

Dow component Citigroup issued a strong second-quarter earnings
reports, but after an initial rise, fell prey to the broader
market's doldrums.
</P>
<P>
Citigroup said it earned 70 cents per share in the second
quarter, topping Wall Street's expectations by 5 cents per share.
Its stock rose only slightly.
</P>
<P>
The S&AMP;P 500 fell 11.12 to 1,407.66. The Nasdaq composite fell
34.10 to 2,830.38.
</P>
<P>
Decliners outnumbered advancers by a 13-to-9 margin on the New
York Stock Exchange, with 1,743 down, 1,203 up and 592 unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume totaled 636.70 million shares as of 4 p.m., down
from 710.05 million at the same point on Friday.

The NYSE composite index fell 4.55 to 658.57, and the American
Stock Exchange composite index fell 0.44 to 817.66.
