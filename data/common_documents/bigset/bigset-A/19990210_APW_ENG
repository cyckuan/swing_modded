<HEADLINE> Amazon Raves About 'Monica's Story' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ``Monica's Story'' was getting rave reviews  
Tuesday from visitors to the Internet bookstore, Amazon.com. The 
problem is, the book is not out yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wrote a review that I made up out of thin air,'' said Peter  
Feld, who posted one of three reviews in the customer comments 
section of the Web site's page on the book. 
</P>
<P>
	The 288-page book by British writer Andrew Morton on Monica  
Lewinsky -- based on exclusive interviews with her -- is due out 
later this month. Messages left with the publisher, St. Martin's 
Press, were not returned. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did it out of humor and admiration for Monica,'' said Feld,  
a 40-year-old Manhattan-based political consultant who was reached 
by phone while traveling in California. 
</P>
<P>
	The reviews of the Lewinsky book will be deleted, said Bill  
Curry, a spokesperson for the Seattle-based company, the world's 
largest online bookseller. 
</P>
<P>
	Customer comments -- or reviews -- can be sent to Amazon.com  
electronically and the company does not contact the self-made 
critics to ensure that they actually read the book, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In his five-star review of Jan. 28, Feld writes: ``I though I  
knew it all, but Monica's Story blew me away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two other reviewers, who remained anonymous, also gave the book  
the maximum five stars.

<HEADLINE>  Heavy Snow Disrupts Parts of Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHAMONIX, France (AP) -- Two avalanches roared down a  
mountainside in the French Alps, burying chalets and killing at 
least 10 people, police said today. Heavy snow fell relentlessly in 
other parts of Europe, forcing evacuations and stranding thousands 
in Switzerland, Austria and Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	With at least two people still missing, rescue workers were  
searching through the snow that blanketed the area just north of 
the popular ski resort of Chamonix, about 30 miles southeast of 
Geneva. Unable to reach the villages by vehicle or helicopter, the 
rescue workers resorted to skis. 
</P>
<P>
	``People can survive for a long time under the snow,'' said  
Blaise Agresti, commander of a mountain police brigade. ``In the 
mountains, it is important that we never give up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The avalanches barreled down the mountainside near the villages  
of Le Tour and Montroc-le-Planet, destroying 17 chalets and burying 
others under deep snow. 
</P>
<P>
	``The scene was spectacular,'' said Jean-Marie Pavy, 49, who was  
staying in a chalet just outside the avalanche's path. ``The chalet 
next to ours disappeared -- it was pushed across the road. There 
were blocks of cement and gravel everywhere. It was the 
apocalypse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The victims included four children, three men and three women,  
police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, about 20 people were pulled out of the snow alive,  
including at least eight children and one man who spent hours 
trapped under the snow before being rescued. Two of the survivors 
were from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, rescue workers today renewed their search for a  
28-year-old British skier in the French Alps resort of Courchevel. 
The skier, who was not identified, was skiing off marked trails 
Tuesday when hit by an avalanche. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, up to 16 inches of snow fell in parts of the Swiss  
Alps overnight and the danger of avalanches remained high, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	In parts of the Austrian province of Tyrol, thousands of people  
remained trapped by record snowfall, with some unable to leave for 
the fifth day, and snow continued fall in much of Austria. 
</P>
<P>
	An avalanche in northwestern Romania blocked a major highway  
after hours of heavy snow, but no injuries were reported, the 
Interior Ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
	Snow was expected to taper off in the Alps, however, and the sky  
was clear in Chamonix this morning. Ski runs were closed in the 
French Alps resort, and hundreds of skiers were trying to leave the 
town in buses and cars to find open slopes. 
</P>
<P>
	The avalanches came during the first week of the annual French  
school winter holidays. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's horrible,'' said Jean-Louis Verdier, deputy mayor of  
Chamonix. ``There is nothing left. Everything was wiped away. Where 
the chalets should be, there is a big hole.''

<HEADLINE> New Orleans Mayor Suspends Gun Swap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- The city's controversial gun swap program  
with Glock Inc. has been suspended pending an investigation into 
whether illegally modified weapons have been shipped to the gun 
maker -- and whether weapons once handled by criminals have ended up 
back in Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a deal revealed last month, the city sent weapons  
confiscated from criminals to Glock in exchange for new police 
weapons. The confiscated guns could not be resold in Louisiana and 
weapons without serial numbers or illegal modifications had to be 
destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mayor Marc Morial suspended the deal Tuesday, saying the  
contract with a Symrna, Ga.-based gun maker may have been violated. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract is suspended ``until we can determine whether there  
have been any violations or wrongdoing by (New Orleans police) or 
Glock representatives in trading weapons that should have been 
destroyed,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation will also look into unconfirmed reports that  
some guns have made their way back to the state. 
</P>
<P>
	The swap had led to criticism of Morial, who helped spearhead  
lawsuits against the gun industry by cities seeking to recover the 
costs of gun violence. Critics said New Orleans could wind up as a 
defendant in one of the lawsuits because the city ended up 
functioning like a gun distributor. 
</P>
<P>
	A Glock spokesman told WWL-TV that the city wasn't honoring the  
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``The city has their guns,'' said Paul Jannuzzo, Glock's vice  
president and general counsel. ``But we don't have all of our 
money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the $613,000 contract, city police have already traded  
7,200 confiscated weapons and old 9mm service pistols for about 
1,700 new Glock .40-caliber handguns. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspension of the contract comes with police still owing  
Glock $153,000 worth of confiscated firearms.

<HEADLINE> Girl Sues To Wear Witch Symbol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- A 17-year-old student has sued her suburban high  
school, saying it is violating her right to religious freedom by 
ordering her not to wear the symbol of her faith -- the practice of 
witchery. 
</P>
<P>
	Crystal Siefferly, a self-proclaimed witch, is at odds with  
Lincoln Park High School over the pentagram, a five-pointed star 
symbolic of Wiccan religion. She has worn her pentagram necklace 
under her clothing since the symbol was banned in October. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be forced to conceal one's religious symbol under one's  
shirt is a feeling of shame,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wicca -- sometimes spelled Wycca -- comes from the Old English  
word for witch. The religion celebrates seasonal and life cycles 
using rituals from pre-Christian Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The Michigan American Civil Liberties Union filed suit in  
federal court Tuesday on the student's behalf, seeking a temporary 
order barring enforcement of the ban while a judge considers the 
case. The ACLU says the policy violates the First Amendment's 
guarantees of free speech and religious freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	``Christian students can wear crosses, and Jewish students can  
wear stars of David, but Wiccans can't wear the pentagram,'' 
Michigan ACLU spokesman Tom Schram said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Siefferly, a senior at the high school, has practiced Wicca  
for several years after reading a book on the subject, Schram said. 
</P>
<P>
	The school has also barred students from wearing symbols of  
white supremacy, gangs and Satan. 
</P>
<P>
	A school memo said the ban is part of an effort to crack down on  
gangs, drugs and violence. Items banned under the policy include 
the pentagram, black nail polish, dog collars and ``death-style 
makeup.'' Violators face confiscation of banned items and 
suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	Lincoln Park schools Superintendent Randall Kite said he could  
not discuss the district's policy in detail, citing his attorney's 
advice. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's certainly not intended to discriminate against anyone's  
religion,'' Kite said.

<HEADLINE> Gov't Finishes Internee Payments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After paying reparations to more than 82,000  
Japanese-Americans placed in internment camps or stripped of 
property during World War II, the Justice Department approved much 
smaller payments to 181 ethnic Japanese from Latin America who 
suffered similar treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	About 350 other Latin American Japanese are eligible for money,  
but will not receive it unless Congress approves additional 
reparations funds, officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The department plans to formally release final figures from the  
10-year, $1.6 billion Japanese reparations program on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The redress program made $20,000 payments to 82,210  
Japanese-Americans or their heirs, department officials said. Under 
a federal court settlement approved last month, the balance of the 
fund was left over to make $5,000 payments to Latin American 
Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
	A Justice Department official, speaking on condition of  
anonymity, said the reparations fund is depleted but more payments 
could be made if Congress makes more money available. 
</P>
<P>
	The oldest claimants in the group, or their heirs, have first  
dibs on the money. All Latin Americans eligible for reparations 
will get an apology letter from President Clinton, the official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not surprising that there is so little money there, but  
we are not happy with the way it turned out,'' said Julie Small, a 
spokeswoman for Latin American Japanese who sued for reparations in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	When the group agreed to settle the case, leaders thought there  
would be ``at least a little something for everyone,'' Ms. Small 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, a lawyer for the group complained in a court  
filing that the Justice Department has not lived up to terms of the 
settlement approved by a Federal Claims Court judge Jan. 25. 
</P>
<P>
	``The community has really fought long and hard to get a modicum  
of justice,'' lawyer Robin Toma said in an interview. ``We're just 
trying to make sure every single former internee had a fair 
opportunity to get the rather modest benefit that the settlement 
agreement gives them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The reparations fund, set up by Congress in 1988, went first to  
Japanese-Americans harmed by the United States after the Japanese 
bombing of Pearl Harbor in 1941. 
</P>
<P>
	President Roosevelt ordered the internments out of fear that  
people of Japanese ancestry could pose a security risk. The vast 
majority of those herded into camps were U.S. citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	The reparations program officially ended last year, after  
handing out payments to an estimated 98 percent of eligible former 
internees or their heirs. The Justice Department office handling 
the claims remained open until last Friday to handle a few 
last-minute claims and to complete paperwork. 
</P>
<P>
	The checks and apology letters will be mailed to Latin American  
Japanese this week, the Justice Department official said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the letter, Clinton pledged to help win more money for  
settlements if the fund ran dry, but the White House has made no 
formal requests to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 2,200 ethnic Japanese were taken from their homes in  
13 Latin American countries and brought by the American military to 
camps in Louisiana, Texas and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Toma's filing alleged that the Justice Department wrongly  
declared about 275 applicants ineligible and that it saddled other 
former internees with confusing bureaucratic demands. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department spokeswoman Christine DiBartolo said Justice  
officials had not received a copy of the filing and could not 
comment.

<HEADLINE> Bill Would Protect Air Passengers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The chairman of the House Transportation  
Committee wants airlines to pay if they keep passengers stranded in 
airplanes, as happened earlier this year in the snowbound Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bud Shuster, R-Pa., included the requirement in  
multifaceted passenger rights legislation he filed today. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the bill, airlines that held passengers for two  
hours or more would have to repay them twice the value of their 
ticket. Passengers held for three hours or more would receive three 
times the value of their ticket, with the same trend holding true 
for passengers held four hours or more. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't walk through the chamber or go to the House gym  
without members coming up to me and telling me the horror stories 
that they have had, that their constituents have had, in dealing 
with the airlines,'' Shuster said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill filing comes five days after two senators introduced  
similar legislation to define passenger rights. The bill by Sens. 
John McCain, R-Ariz., and Ron Wyden, D-Ore., would require airlines 
to give passengers 48 hours to cancel tickets that now are 
nonrefundable. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation would also require airlines to explain why  
flights are delayed. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the legislation stems from complaints after snowstorms  
stranded travelers in Detroit over the New Year's holiday. In some 
cases, passengers were stuck on planes for eight hours or more 
within view of the terminal because the planes either could not 
take off or pull into a gate. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuster spoke of one family trapped for 12 hours.  
</P>
<P>
	Airlines have said the regulations are unnecessary and  
misplaced. They complain that they cannot be held accountable for 
bad weather or the unavailability of gates. 
</P>
<P>
	They also say that their industry is sensitive to passenger  
needs, as evidenced by their purchases of new airplanes and 
advanced entertainment systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuster said the decision by American Airlines pilots to call in  
sick and refuse all overtime this week, creating travel delays and 
cancellations for thousands of travelers, shows why such 
legislation is needed. The pilots and American's management are 
clashing over compensation for pilots after the airline's recent 
acquisition of Reno Air. 
</P>
<P>
	``I say a pox on both their houses. I think they don't give a  
damn about the traveling public,'' the congressman said. ``I think 
that you need to do whatever it takes to get their attention.''

<HEADLINE> Patti Page Still a Singing Rage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BATH, N.H. (AP) -- The year was 1946 when Jack Rael came to  
Tulsa, Okla., for a one-nighter with a Chicago band, checked into 
his hotel room and flicked on the radio. 
</P>
<P>
	Clara Ann Fowler, 18, of nearby Claremore, happened to be doing  
her 15-minute live show, and her singing caught Rael's attention. 
He immediately called the station, KTUL, and asked Fowler if she 
had ever thought of leaving Tulsa for the big time. No, she said, 
she wanted to be a commercial artist. He asked her to send him some 
sample records. She did, and less than eight weeks later she was 
opening in Chicago with the band for a six-week engagement. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the end of the 1940s, Clara Ann Fowler was on her way to  
becoming one of the greatest female pop singers of all time. By 
then, she was known as The Singing Rage, Miss Patti Page. 
</P>
<P>
	What followed was a string of top 10 hits: ``With My Eyes Wide  
Open,'' ``Would I Love You,'' ``Mockin' Bird Hill,'' ``I Went to 
Your Wedding,'' ``Doggie in the Window,'' ``Allegheny Moon,'' ``Old 
Cape Cod'' and ``Tennessee Waltz,'' the third best-selling record 
in history. Overall, she has sold more than 100 million records, 
more than any other female singer. 
</P>
<P>
	She had her own television shows in the 1950s on ABC, CBS and  
NBC, with many of the top stars of the day as guests. 
</P>
<P>
	And 52 years later, Patti Page, 71, is still singing, one of a  
handful of entertainers whose popularity has endured because they 
have maintained their fan base and have been introduced to younger 
generations through special concert shows and biography series on 
public television. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's still unbelievable,'' Page said in a recent interview at  
the 1830s farmhouse where she and her husband, retired aerospace 
executive Jerry Filiciotto, live half the year. Their other home is 
in California. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was a kid from Oklahoma who never wanted to be a singer, but  
was told I could sing. And things snowballed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She first grabbed attention with the release of ``Confess,'' one  
of the first recordings to use dubbing technology in which the 
singer records more than one track of the song, doing her own 
backup and harmonies. 
</P>
<P>
	The hits followed, and her career now includes 15 gold records  
and three gold albums of more than 1 million in sales. She had 24 
records in the top 10, including four that reached No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Now she has been nominated for a Grammy for the first time in  
her career -- they didn't have Grammys when she made most of her 
hits. Her album, ``Live at Carnegie Hall -- the 50th Anniversary 
Concert,'' cut May 31, 1997, is among five nominees for the best 
traditional pop vocal performance in an album. 
</P>
<P>
	That might come as a surprise to many, she acknowledged.  
</P>
<P>
	``People think I retired, but I never have,'' she said, though  
she did cut back in the 1960s to raise her family. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now there's a new generation appreciating us,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	She and her husband also produce Patti Page Maple Syrup and  
cranberry mix at their Hilltop Farm. They sell the products over 
the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	She still does about 40 shows a year, with symphony orchestras  
or at casinos in Atlantic City and Nevada. She also did a recent 
show for National Public Television, toured some stations as part 
of their fund-raisers, and expects to do another tour in the 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``Doggie in the Window'' is her most-requested song, but  
``Tennessee Waltz,'' which sent her career into orbit in 1950, 
remains her favorite. And it became a hit by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	Rael, who would remain her agent for 50 years, and record  
company owner Jerry Wexler passed each other in a New York City 
building, and Wexler said he had reviewed a record by a country 
singer he thought Page might like. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a recording date coming up, so we just added it to the  
date,'' Page said. They had no musical arrangement. ``We just made 
it up as we went along,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was November, and Mercury records said nothing would sell at  
that season except Christmas music, so the song was put on the flip 
side of ``Boogie Woogie Santa Claus'' and released. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon after, Page was singing at the Copacabana in New York with  
Jerry Lewis, ``and as I was walking off the stage, several people 
said, `Sing the waltz.' I had no idea what they were talking 
about,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	She soon learned. A record distributor in Philadelphia said  
everyone was talking about ``Tennessee Waltz'' -- and no one was 
playing ``Boogie Woogie Santa Claus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It became the first pop tune that crossed over into a big  
country hit. 
</P>
<P>
	The waltz was on the charts for 30 weeks, 12 of them in the top  
10, and eventually sold more than 10 million copies, behind only 
``White Christmas'' by Bing Crosby at the time. Since then, Elton 
John's song about Princess Diana has taken over the top spot.

<HEADLINE> When Office Dating Abounds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	You're in love with the cute co-worker just a few cubicles away,  
and -- sigh! -- she loves you too. Snatching kisses in the elevator 
is fun, and you can't wait for your next stairwell squeeze. 
</P>
<P>
	How about a cold shower instead?  
</P>
<P>
	As more companies let colleagues freely date and throw them  
together for marathon work and social fun, passion is spilling into 
the workplace. Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky aren't the only 
ones to choose the office for a tryst: 9 percent of people have 
made love at work, and 12 percent have walked in on other lovers, 
according to a recent survey of more than 1,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	But remember what happened to Clinton and Lewinsky. Bringing sex  
into the office is playing with fire. Sooner or later, someone's 
going to see the smoke. And even if you're involved in a perfectly 
aboveboard courtship with a co-worker, take care. In most offices, 
seemingly tame gestures -- lunches together, knowing looks -- can 
cause problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's a tightly knit group and you regularly go in an office  
and close the door, that's a signal to others,'' says Wayne Sotile, 
a psychologist and family counselor. ``A workplace romance never 
occurs in a vacuum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Certainly, workers now have ample opportunity to get to know one  
another. Americans work 47 hours a week on average -- 3 1/2 more hours 
than they did 20 years ago -- and they often work closely on teams 
and joint projects. 
</P>
<P>
	Work is such a fertile dating ground, says Rich Gosse, founder  
of the global organization American Singles, that he advises the 
lovelorn: ``If you don't date people on the job, you'll stay single 
your whole life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nor do most companies forbid office courtship. Nowadays, dating  
is rarely banned and couples are allowed to stay on the payroll 
together, as long as one doesn't oversee the other. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, the accounting firm Deloitte &AMP; Touche scrapped its rule  
forbidding couples to work together, finding that it was too 
restrictive and out-of-date, says Jim Walls, national director of 
human resources. Now the company allows all romances, except for 
those between bosses and underlings. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lives of our employees are none of our business, provided  
that those relationships don't interfere with our business,'' says 
Walls. 
</P>
<P>
	It's no wonder, then, that almost 40 percent of adults have  
dated a co-worker, according to a random telephone survey of 1,007 
adults. The survey, commissioned by the romance book publisher 
Harlequin Enterprises and conducted by Roper Starch, also found 
that nearly 10 percent of adults have made love in the office. 
</P>
<P>
	Sonia Vieira, a marketing specialist, hasn't made any effort to  
keep secret her three-year relationship with a co-worker at 
MasteryWorks, an Annandale, Va., consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
	She says she feels so comfortable with her colleagues that at  
times she publicly greets her boyfriend with a kiss and a hug, yet 
she takes care not to flaunt the relationship at work. ``We both 
keep it very professional,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	That's true, says company president Caela Farren, Vieira's  
direct boss, who says she's never seen the couple's open affection, 
but wouldn't care if she did. 
</P>
<P>
	Not all companies or co-workers are so accepting, even if dating  
is allowed. Gossip flourishes and judgment may be questioned if 
love is openly shown, or if lovers seem more wrapped up in each 
other than their work. 
</P>
<P>
	``Typically, this kind of behavior isn't conducted to offend  
other people, it's just not thought about,'' says Robert Sawdon, 
vice president of human resources for Wright Line Inc., a 
Worcester, Mass.-based maker of computer furniture. 
</P>
<P>
	At a past job, Sawdon had to talk to a couple who had a habit of  
kissing passionately in their car each morning in the company 
parking lot. ``It was distracting to other employees,'' he recalls. 
``I suggested that they take it to the public park down the 
street.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What is tolerated ultimately may depend on each company's  
culture. 
</P>
<P>
	``People make their own rules in the context of the relationship  
in the workplace,'' says Linda Gerstel, a New York City lawyer who 
dated and ultimately married a fellow lawyer at the same firm. 
</P>
<P>
	When Gerstel met her husband nine years ago, she refused to have  
lunch with him or be seen leaving or arriving together. Although 
neither was boss to the other, she worried when they worked on the 
same committees, fearing others would think they'd vote in a block. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis Powers, author of ``The Office Romance,'' praises lovers  
who keep their work and love lives as separate as possible. He says 
lovers need to show that they're getting their work done just as 
they always did. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet to some, few things are more tantalizing than the forbidden:  
sex in the office when nobody's looking -- even though that breaks 
most employee codes of conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	When one company found underwear on a desktop, an investigation  
was undertaken and the couple that had been dallying at night was 
disciplined, says Katie Buchanan, a human resources executive who 
refused to name the company, her former employer. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Sonia Vieira doesn't have any qualms about a quick  
private kiss with her boyfriend when she's working late. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kissing? Sure,'' she says. ``It doesn't go as far as making  
love, but if it's just us two, (kissing) doesn't bother me. It's 
usually after hours.''

<HEADLINE> Steelers Sign Tight End Mark Bruener </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The Pittsburgh Steelers made certain they  
didn't lose Mark Bruener to free agency, signing one of the NFL's 
best blocking tight ends to a $10 million, four-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruener likely will be the only player among a large group of  
Steelers unrestricted free agents to re-sign before the free agent 
signing period begins Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Other prospective Steelers free agents are defensive backs  
Carnell Lake, Lee Flowers and Darren Perry, receiver Charles 
Johnson, kicker Norm Johnson, fullback Tim Lester, defensive 
lineman Oliver Gibson and linebacker Donta Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	Perry, a starter since 1992, and Gibson appear the most likely  
to leave. It also seems certain that Lake, a four-time Pro Bowl 
defensive back, will test the open market before the Steelers 
decide whether to offer him a contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Lake moved from strong safety to cornerback last season but had  
a sub-par season, and the Steelers want him to return to safety. 
However, cornerbacks usually command higher salaries than safeties, 
and Lake may want to determine if there is interest in him as a 
cornerback. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Bill Cowher and new offensive coordinator Kevin Gilbride  
consider Bruener one of the key blockers in the Steelers' running 
game and did not want to go searching for a replacement. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'd be hard-pressed to find a tight end who blocks the way  
Mark blocks. It probably doesn't show in his catching, but his 
production in the running game is as good as any in the league,'' 
Cowher said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-4, 261-pound Bruener, a first round draft choice in  
1995 from Washington, has started since his rookie season. He has 
missed only four games in four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruener caught 19 passes for 157 yards and two touchdowns last  
season and has 75 receptions for 653 yards and 11 touchdowns in his 
four-year career. He had six touchdown catches among his 18 
receptions in 1997.

<P>
	Five days into the NBA season, only four teams remain  
undefeated. 
</P>
<P>
	It's no surprise in the West that Utah and Seattle are both 3-0,  
but look who's unblemished in the East -- Milwaukee and 
Philadelphia! 
</P>
<P>
	The Jazz, Sonics, Bucks and 76ers all won Tuesday night to keep  
their perfect records intact. 
</P>
<P>
	Karl Malone scored 31 points as Utah improved to 3-0 for the  
first time in a decade by beating Dallas 90-79. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Payton scored 20 and the SuperSonics had an easy time  
against Golden State, beating the Warriors 90-71 for Seattle's 
first 3-0 start since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray Allen took a hard fall to the floor while battling for a  
rebound with Charles Oakley, but returned in the fourth quarter to 
start a game-breaking run as the Bucks (2-0) beat the Toronto 
Raptors 91-77. 
</P>
<P>
	Theo Ratliff had 10 points, nine rebounds and five of  
Philadelphia's season-high 13 blocks as the Sixers improved to 3-0 
for the first time since 1984-85 by defeating previously unbeaten 
Detroit 90-86. 
</P>
<P>
	In other NBA games, Boston defeated Miami 108-101, Minnesota  
plodded past San Antonio 74-70, Atlanta defeated Chicago 87-71 and 
Sacramento topped Phoenix 112-95. 
</P>
<P>
	``Utah may be the best team in the league now,'' said Cedric  
Ceballos of the Mavericks, whose team hung with the Jazz for 3 1/2 
quarters before Malone led a late charge that iced the win. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah, which also beat the Lakers and Bulls, has never started  
4-0 in the 25-year history of the franchise. That chance will come 
Thursday night at Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	Malone, who scored 21 and 28 points against the Bulls and  
Lakers, put the Jazz ahead 76-74 with a bucket with 6:37 to go, and 
Dallas folded after that. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just keep scratching and clawing for every victory,'' John  
Stockton said. ``We showed again we can play defense when we need 
to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Howard Eisley had 11 points for the Jazz, making him the only  
other Utah player in double figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas coach Don Nelson said Utah showed why it should be  
favored to win the NBA championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``They did what great teams are supposed to do,'' Nelson said.  
``They just picked up apart in the fourth quarter. We played very 
well for three quarters, but good teams turn it on in the fourth 
period.'' 
</P>
<P>
                     *SuperSonics 90, Warriors 71    	
</P>
<P>
	At Seattle, the Sonics took care of this one early, allowing the  
reserves to play the entire fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Rashard Lewis, the Sonics' second-round pick out of high school,  
punctuated the victory with 17 seconds left on a slam dunk off a 
feed by Moochie Norris. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle coach Paul Westphal gave Don MacLean and rookies  
Vladimir Stepania, Lewis and Jelani McCoy their first playing time 
of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was great to get a couple of minutes and get the feel of an  
NBA game,'' Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sonics center Olden Polynice made his first 3-pointer since the  
1995-96 season, and Vin Baker went 0-for-4 from the line -- making 
him 0-for-10 for the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're 3-0 and that's great. I look at myself and think about  
what we can do once I start clicking,'' Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
                        *Bucks 91, Raptors 77    	
</P>
<P>
	Toronto rookie Vince Carter led all scorers with 22 points and  
brought the 14,577 fans at Maple Leafs Garden to their feet by 
finishing off an alley-oop pass from Dee Brown to cut the Bucks' 
lead to 72-70 with 6:50 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	But Allen followed with a pair of free throws to start an 11-0  
run capped by Vinny Del Negro's uncontested layup for an 81-70 lead 
with 3:48 to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a fourth-quarter team,'' Allen said. ``If the game is up  
and down in the fourth, we're a shoo-in to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glenn Robinson finished with 16 points, Dell Curry added 15 and  
Terrell Brandon 14. 
</P>
<P>
                        *76ers 90, Pistons 86    	
</P>
<P>
	At Philadelphia, Matt Geiger had 16 points and three blocks, and  
Harvey Grant recorded the other four rejections in a swat-fest that 
handed the Pistons their first loss in four games. 
</P>
<P>
	Grant Hill had 32 points to lead the Pistons, who were playing  
their third game in three nights. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fans and the media are making a big deal of three games in  
three days, but the players really like it,'' said Hill, coming off 
a career-high 46 points against Washington. ``I'd rather play than 
practice any day.'' 
</P>
<P>
                        *Celtics 108, Heat 101    	
</P>
<P>
	At Miami, Antoine Walker scored 31 points to help Boston beat  
the shorthanded Heat for the first time in three years. 
</P>
<P>
	``This feels good,'' Walker said. ``The monkey is off our back.  
Miami has always been at the top of the division, which gives us a 
lot of confidence early in the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Heat completed the first stretch of three games in three  
nights in franchise history. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been almost 2 1/2 years since we had this kind of doubt,''  
coach Pat Riley said. ``We've got to find some combination, some 
way to make this thing work. We're not going to feel sorry for 
ourselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
                      *Timberwolves 74, Spurs 70    	
</P>
<P>
	At Minneapolis, the Wolves survived poor shooting nights from  
Stephon Marbury and Kevin Garnett. 
</P>
<P>
	Garnett, who shot 6-for-25, barely beat the shot clock with a  
short jumper to give the Wolves a 68-66 lead, their biggest since 
the first quarter, with 1:24 left. 
</P>
<P>
	Marbury, who was 6-for-19, hit a 15-foot jumper to break a  
68-all tie with 43 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	Garnett then forced a turnover with 33 seconds left and Marbury  
another with 10 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Hawks 87, Bulls 71    	
</P>
<P>
	Chicago fell behind 13-2 and 22-6 in its home opener and then  
rallied within two in the third quarter before Atlanta pulled away. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Smith scored 30 points, including 14 in the final quarter.  
Alan Henderson and Grant Long added 14 points apiece, while Dikembe 
Mutombo had 11 points and 14 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Kings 112, Suns 95    	
</P>
<P>
	Chris Webber had 28 points and 20 rebounds and rookie Jason  
Williams scored 22 points as Sacramento ended an 11-year, 24-game 
losing streak in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	Phoenix failed to sell out for the first time in 325 games.

<HEADLINE> Steel Buyers Worry About Tariffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Oil driller Gary Green sympathizes with steel  
producers fighting a tide of cheap imports, but he worries more 
that any government help they get would increase his costs for 
equipment made of steel. 
</P>
<P>
	As steel producers press the Clinton administration to levy  
steel tariffs and impose other sanctions, others ask that the 
government consider effects of such a decision on the overall 
economy, not just the steel industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry blames at least 10,000 layoffs and three  
bankruptcies on the import surge. But while 200,000 people work in 
steel production, more than 8 million -- people like Green -- work in 
manufacturing and other steel-consuming industries. 
</P>
<P>
	``To the extent there are favoritisms levied for domestic steel  
producers, really the people like us, the roughnecks that work in 
the fields, we lose jobs,'' said Green, who runs Gary Drilling Co. 
in Bakersfield, Calif., with his father, Ed. 
</P>
<P>
	Drilling contractors already are reeling from low oil prices  
worldwide and from tariffs imposed in 1995 on imports of a special 
type of steel tubing essential to their business. After foreign 
producers largely pulled out of the U.S. market, drillers faced 
price hikes and order backlogs of up to two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Green said tariffs being considered on a more common product,  
hot-rolled carbon steel, could have a bad effect on business. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department is to make a preliminary determination  
Friday on whether to impose steel tariffs against Japan, Russia and 
Brazil. The domestic steel industry alleges that imports are being 
dumped in U.S. markets at prices dramatically below production 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Heavy steel users in manufacturing and construction, many  
enjoying import-driven price reductions, also face having to pay 
more for their raw materials if tariffs are added. 
</P>
<P>
	The steel buyers ``are sorry that some of the domestic mill  
suppliers are having financial difficulties, but frankly their job 
is to make money for their shareholders, too,'' said Tom Stundza, 
executive editor of Purchasing, a Newton, Mass.-based magazine for 
industry buyers. ``I don't know of any buying group that's been 
weeping any tears over the fact that the price of metal came 
down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even the companies that buy most of their steel domestically  
under long-term arrangements immune to short-term pricing 
variations are worried about the impact of tariffs on worldwide 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	General Motors Corp.'s Alan Adler said cutting off the U.S.  
market could raise production costs for foreign producers and 
affect prices of steel bought for GM's overseas plants, which make 
cars for foreign sales. The auto maker buys 5 million tons of steel 
a year worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1995 government study estimated that tariffs to combat dumping  
cost the U.S. economy close to $1.6 billion more than the benefits 
they provide in terms of sales and protected jobs. Critics say that 
study takes a snapshot of the economy and fails to reflect the 
temporary nature of lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Steel prices in the United States have dropped as much as $75 a  
ton from the $350 level before Asia's economic crisis lowered 
demand for steel abroad and forced foreign producers to seek U.S. 
outlets. 
</P>
<P>
	Although imports dropped sharply in December, levels remain  
above those of 1997. Steel producers are pressing on with their 
dumping case, saying tariffs are needed to make import prices 
comparable to prevailing domestic levels. 
</P>
<P>
	``For buyers, really it's a false short-term benefit,'' said  
Roger Schagrin, a lawyer for eight U.S. steel producers. ``If it 
wasn't stopped we would not have a viable steel industry left to 
supply them in the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said domestic production still accounts for about 60 percent  
of U.S. steel consumption, down from 80 percent before the import 
surge. 
</P>
<P>
	Some steel users are sympathetic to the producers' complaints.  
Heavy-equipment manufacturer Caterpillar Inc. supports using 
existing trade laws, which allow tariffs, to address unfair trade 
practices, although the company cautioned against giving the steel 
industry the stronger sanctions it wants. 
</P>
<P>
	Even free-trade advocates in Congress agree that U.S. trade laws  
must be enforced. 
</P>
<P>
	``It can increase the cost of goods, to be sure, but the goods  
are being unrealistically sold,'' said Rep. Philip Crane, R-Ill., 
chairman of the House Ways and Means subcommittee on trade. ``Short 
term, it's beneficial from a consumer's standpoint, but it's not 
proper or good in the long term because you create those kinds of 
disruptions where you're destroying our capabilities.''

</P>
<P>
	At Seattle, the Sonics took care of this one early, allowing the  
reserves to play the entire fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Rashard Lewis, the Sonics' second-round pick out of high school,  
punctuated the victory with 17 seconds left on a slam dunk off a 
feed by Moochie Norris. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle coach Paul Westphal gave Don MacLean and rookies  
Vladimir Stepania, Lewis and Jelani McCoy their first playing time 
of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was great to get a couple of minutes and get the feel of an  
NBA game,'' Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sonics center Olden Polynice made his first 3-pointer since the  
1995-96 season, and Vin Baker went 0-for-4 from the line -- making 
him 0-for-10 for the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're 3-0 and that's great. I look at myself and think about  
what we can do once I start clicking,'' Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
                        *Bucks 91, Raptors 77    	
</P>
<P>
	Toronto rookie Vince Carter led all scorers with 22 points and  
brought the 14,577 fans at Maple Leafs Garden to their feet by 
finishing off an alley-oop pass from Dee Brown to cut the Bucks' 
lead to 72-70 with 6:50 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	But Allen followed with a pair of free throws to start an 11-0  
run capped by Vinny Del Negro's uncontested layup for an 81-70 lead 
with 3:48 to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a fourth-quarter team,'' Allen said. ``If the game is up  
and down in the fourth, we're a shoo-in to win.''

<P>
	Glenn Robinson finished with 16 points, Dell Curry added 15 and  
Terrell Brandon 14.

Harvey Grant recorded the other four rejections in a swat-fest that 
handed the Pistons their first loss in four games. 
</P>
<P>
	Grant Hill had 32 points to lead the Pistons, who were playing  
their third game in three nights. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fans and the media are making a big deal of three games in  
three days, but the players really like it,'' said Hill, coming off 
a career-high 46 points against Washington. ``I'd rather play than 
practice any day.''

<P>
	At Miami, Antoine Walker scored 31 points to help Boston beat  
the shorthanded Heat for the first time in three years. 
</P>
<P>
	``This feels good,'' Walker said. ``The monkey is off our back.  
Miami has always been at the top of the division, which gives us a 
lot of confidence early in the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Heat completed the first stretch of three games in three  
nights in franchise history. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been almost 2 1/2 years since we had this kind of doubt,''  
coach Pat Riley said. ``We've got to find some combination, some 
way to make this thing work. We're not going to feel sorry for 
ourselves.''

</P>
<P>
	At Minneapolis, the Wolves survived poor shooting nights from  
Stephon Marbury and Kevin Garnett. 
</P>
<P>
	Garnett, who shot 6-for-25, barely beat the shot clock with a  
short jumper to give the Wolves a 68-66 lead, their biggest since 
the first quarter, with 1:24 left. 
</P>
<P>
	Marbury, who was 6-for-19, hit a 15-foot jumper to break a  
68-all tie with 43 seconds remaining.

<HEADLINE> Nissan Unveils New Maxima </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Nissan's larger, more luxurious Maxima sedan is  
just one of the cars that will be featured at this year's Chicago 
Auto Show. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota displayed two new models at the media preview Wednesday,  
including the MR-Spyder, a mid-engine, open-air roadster that will 
go on sale in the United States in early 2000, and a convertible 
version of Toyota's Camry Solara coupe 
</P>
<P>
	Other new models unveiled include the redesigned 2000 Pontiac  
Bonneville sedan. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan Motor Co. said its larger, more luxurious 2000 Maxima  
sedan will go on sale in June. The car comes with a more powerful 
3-liter V6, and more distinctive front- and rear-end treatments 
than the current generation Maxima. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Seergy, a Nissan vice president, said the car will be  
priced in the same lower to mid-$20,000 price range as the current 
model. He said Nissan expects to sell 110,000 Maximas a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan also displayed a wild show car that executives openly  
called a ``polarizing design.'' The NCS, for ``new concept sedan,'' 
is intended to offer the room and storage space of a minivan in a 
sedan-like package. 
</P>
<P>
	With its high roof and sweeping side window line, the NCS looks  
like a cross between a station wagon and a hatchback car. Jerry 
Hirshberg, who heads Nissan's California design studio, said that 
with the seats folded flat, two adults could sleep comfortably in 
the NCS. 
</P>
<P>
	Seergy said the NCS will be basis for a production model in the  
next two to three years. Like other major automakers, Nissan is 
hoping to create a hybrid car that combines attributes of a sport 
utility vehicle and minivan with the driveability and comfort of a 
sedan. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota Motor Corp.'s MR-Spyder will replace the MR2, a hardtop  
sports car that remains on sale in Japan but was removed from the 
North American market in 1995 because of slow sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Donald Esmond, a vice president of Toyota Motor Sales USA Inc.,  
said the rear-drive MR-Spyder would be priced to compete against 
the Mazda Miata in the lower end of the sports car market, which 
means $20,000 to $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the same price range Nissan is considering for the  
revival of its Z-car, expected to go into production in the next 
few years. 
</P>
<P>
	The sports car market has grown increasingly crowded in the past  
decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Mazda marked the 10th anniversary of its popular roadster by  
unveiling a limited edition model at the Chicago show, where the 
original debuted in 1989. The car features special trim and a 
special six-speed manual transmission in place of the standard 
five-speed version. 
</P>
<P>
	The MR-Spyder borrows some styling from its higher-priced  
competition: the bulbous fender flares look like they came off the 
new Audi TT, while the rear-end design looks a lot like the Porsche 
Boxster's, complete with big air scoops to cool the engine that 
rests behind the seats. 
</P>
<P>
	The car will be built in Japan, but Esmond would not say when it  
might go on sale there or in Europe. Toyota said the production 
version will be very close to the concept car. 
</P>
<P>
	The MR-Spyder will be powered by a new 1.8-liter, twin-cam,  
four-cylinder engine rated at 140 horsepower. It also features an 
unusual five-speed manual transmission that does not use a clutch. 
The driver can either shift using a conventional center console 
shifter, or by pressing buttons on either side of the steering 
wheel. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota also showed off its convertible Solara, which will go on  
sale in spring 2000. The convertible is aimed at buyers who desire 
a sports car but need the room and comfort of a larger car. It will 
be offered with a choice of four-cylinder or V6 engines, a standard 
four-speed automatic transmission, a power folding top and a glass 
rear window. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota expects to sell only 6,000 convertibles a year. The coupe  
went on sale last fall and Toyota plans to sell 50,000 this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pontiac division of General Motors Corp. unveiled its  
redesigned flagship sedan, the Bonneville, which executives 
described as a sporty luxury car ``with attitude.'' It shares the 
chassis and major mechanical underpinnings with Chevrolet's 2000 
Impala. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Bonneville has Pontiac's styling trademarks, including  
``cat's eye'' headlights and sculpted ``gills'' to give it a more 
aggressive look. The car will come standard with a V6 engine that 
can be upgraded with a supercharger that boosts power to 240 
horsepower from 205. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bonneville is aimed at baby boomer families who ``want a car  
that helps them look and feel young,'' said Mary Boland, Pontiac 
brand manager. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago Auto Show, which opens to the public Friday, runs  
through Feb. 21.

<HEADLINE> Gore Seeks Help of Black Lawmakers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore appealed to black  
members of Congress and their guests Wednesday night to help turn 
out voters next year to keep a Democrat in the White House and 
return control of the House to Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that a turnover of the House from Republican to  
Democratic control in the 2000 election would put blacks in key 
committee chairmanships. 
</P>
<P>
	The country needs ``more political maturity,'' not attempts to  
eliminate affirmative action programs, Gore told about 500 people 
at a dinner sponsored by the Congressional Black Caucus. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't need more division in America,'' Gore said, adding  
that that his vision of the nation in the new millennium is that of 
a place ``committed to justice as well as prosperity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore already has formed committees for seeking the Democratic  
presidential nomination next year and named several key campaign 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the start of President Clinton's administration more  
blacks have become home and business owners as well as federal 
judges than ever before, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the achievements, too many are still without adequate  
health care or are forced to learn in crumbling, overcrowded 
schools buildings, he said. Blacks also remain twice as likely to 
die at birth or from HIV/AIDS, or to be unemployed, he said.

<HEADLINE> Real `English Patient' Was No Count </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ERD, Hungary (AP) -- The Hungarian count known to the world as  
the hero of ``The English Patient'' was a haunted desert explorer 
who collaborated with the Nazis to try to save his lover's life. 
</P>
<P>
	But the real-life story of Laszlo de Almasy is even better, the  
author of a new biography claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Janos Kubassek, a Hungarian with a lifelong fascination with  
Almasy, says he discovered documents from the war crimes tribunal 
showing that Almasy saved several Jews during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	He also debunks a couple of misconceptions about Almasy in ``The  
True Story of the English Patient,'' published in Hungarian this 
month: Almasy wasn't a devoted Nazi and he wasn't a count. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that Kubassek has anything but praise for Anthony  
Minghella's breathtaking film, winner of the 1997 Academy Award for 
best picture, or the prize-winning Michael Ondaatje novel on which 
it was based. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are wonderful works -- of fiction,'' he says.  
</P>
<P>
	Kubassek, 41, is a geographer, historian and director of the  
Hungarian Geographical Museum in this small town 12 miles west of 
Budapest. He relates his obsession with Almasy sitting in a tiny 
office filled with books, maps and mementos of his trips tracing 
Almasy's life and travels. 
</P>
<P>
	As a boy of 15, he acquired one of Almasy's books from a  
secondhand bookseller, and it determined his career. He joined the 
Hungarian Geographical Society a year later and went to the 
University of Debrecen to study geography. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to know everything there was to know about Almasy,''  
he says, still visibly gripped by that youthful passion. 
</P>
<P>
	Born Aug. 22, 1895, in Borostyankoe, Hungary -- now Bernstein,  
Austria -- Almasy was no count, his biographer learned. When he 
served as an adjutant to Austrian ruler Karl IV, the emperor once 
referred to him that way, and it stuck. 
</P>
<P>
	Almasy went on his first of many expeditions to the Sahara in  
1926, journeys he described in a series of books. He became known 
for discovering Stone Age paintings in caves in Libya. 
</P>
<P>
	His reputation as a Sahara expert led to his widely questioned  
association with the Nazis when the German Luftwaffe requested his 
services in 1941 from the Hungarian military, where he was an air 
force reservist. He joined Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps, and was 
assigned to aerial reconnaissance tasks. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1942, he personally guided two German spies across the  
Sahara, taking them behind British lines, and was awarded two 
German Iron Crosses for his services. 
</P>
<P>
	He returned to Budapest in 1943 and, at the Defense Ministry's  
request, wrote up his diary account of serving under Rommel, which 
was published as a book. 
</P>
<P>
	He was arrested and held briefly by Soviet authorities in  
Hungary in 1945, then arrested again by Hungarian authorities after 
a neighbor accused him of Nazi sympathies. 
</P>
<P>
	But as court records studied by Kubassek showed, the Hungarian  
war crimes tribunal found no such evidence and he was released in 
1946. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only was Almasy no Nazi, the biographer says, archives tell  
how he saved the lives of several Jews in 1944, when Adolf Eichmann 
was rounding up the Jews of Hungary for extermination. 
</P>
<P>
	During the darkest hours of Nazi terror in Hungary, Almasy often  
donned his Luftwaffe uniform with Iron Cross decorations and 
successfully prevented Hungarian fascists from searching his 
apartment where he was sheltering the family of Lajos Weisz, his 
Jewish neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
	Kubassek also found court evidence that Almasy saved Gyoergy  
Fuksz, the son of Olympic fencing champion Jenoe Fuksz, a Jew. And 
that he rescued a Jewish Polish refugee boy from certain discovery, 
obtained false papers for him, and put him into a Catholic 
orphanage where he survived the war. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was pro-monarchy and that was about his only politics,''  
Kubassek says. ``Almasy welcomed the transfer to Rommel's army 
because it meant a chance to return to his beloved Sahara, but 
there is nothing in any of his writings or private letters 
indicating Nazi sympathies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Almasy left Hungary for good in the middle of 1947, returning to  
Africa where he organized safaris. After coming down with dysentery 
in Egypt, he died March 22, 1951, at the age of 55 in a clinic in 
Salzburg, Austria. 
</P>
<P>
	One mystery that remains even after all of Kubassek's research  
concerns Almasy's love life. There were romantic interests, but no 
evidence indicates a great romance as in Minghella's movie. 
</P>
<P>
	``No woman could tolerate for long playing second fiddle to the  
Sahara,'' Almasy's cousin Antal told Kubassek.

<HEADLINE> Spielberg Offers Holocaust Archive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- While steering clear of Germany's debate over its  
national Holocaust memorial, director Steven Spielberg suggested 
Wednesday that his archive of interviews with survivors was still 
available if Germany wants to include it. 
</P>
<P>
	Spielberg, in town for the screening of his Holocaust  
documentary ``The Last Days'' at the Berlin International Film 
Festival, declined to comment on competing concepts for the 
memorial, to be built in Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is a decision that the German people have to make,'' he  
said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	But he indicated that he was still interested in having the  
archives collected by his Shoah Visual History Foundation as part 
of the project. 
</P>
<P>
	Spielberg first made the suggestion in a German magazine  
interview last November, and it reportedly was backed by Chancellor 
Gerhard Schroeder's culture adviser, Michael Naumann. 
</P>
<P>
	But there was no mention of Spielberg's archive in a new concept  
Naumann unveiled in December, which combines a research center, 
exhibition space and a memorial park. 
</P>
<P>
	After more than a decade of public debate, parliament is to vote  
on the project this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Spielberg said he has met with government officials, and had a  
chat with Schroeder scheduled for Wednesday. But he denied he was 
lobbying for his archive to be included. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're sitting in the wings, waiting to see what you decide,  
before we then come here with our repository and make a home for 
it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Spielberg also accepted a $1.5 million donation to his  
foundation from a Partners for Tolerance initiative backed by three 
of Germany's biggest publishing houses, Bertelsmann, Burda and 
Springer. 
</P>
<P>
	The publishers plan to help translate educational materials  
produced by the Shoah Foundation, like an interactive CD-ROM 
unveiled last year, and distribute them to German schools. The 
foundation also has ideas about making survivor interviews 
available via Internet directly at former concentration camps. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Last Days,'' a documentary feature nominated for an  
Academy Award on Tuesday, was to be screened out of competition 
Thursday at the Berlin festival. The film, which traces the 
experiences of five Hungarian Holocaust survivors, is slated to 
open this month in theaters in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Spielberg said he was ``very happy'' about the Oscar  
nominations, which included 11 for another of his movies, ``Saving 
Private Ryan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Breaking into a big grin, he said: ``How do I feel? How do you  
think I feel?''

<HEADLINE> Leonard, Hearns To Promote Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Sugar Ray Leonard sees Ike Quartey as the  
fighter who will help determine just how good Oscar De La Hoya 
really is. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the same function Thomas Hearns fulfilled for Leonard in  
their epic welterweight title fight 18 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	And Leonard turned out to be very good indeed.  
</P>
<P>
	``Very few fights can live up to the hype of that fight, but it  
did,'' Leonard said. ``This fight isn't that big, but it's big 
because it's a barometer of where Oscar De La Hoya truly is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leonard joined Hearns at a press conference Wednesday to promote  
De La Hoya's WBC welterweight title defense against the unbeaten 
Quartey on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	They couldn't agree on who beat who in their two fights (Leonard  
stopped Hearns in 1981, then fought to a disputed draw in a rematch 
eight years later), but agreed that the De La Hoya-Quartey fight is 
nowhere near as big as their first bout. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to top the magnitude of what Ray and myself had,''  
Hearns said. ``These guys are in our shadow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya's defense of his WBC title against Quartey, a former  
WBA champion, is certainly on paper the best 147-pound title fight 
in some time, perhaps even stretching back into the era where 
Leonard, Hearns and Marvelous Marvin Hagler created some memorable 
bouts. 
</P>
<P>
	It promises to give De La Hoya his first major test against an  
undefeated fighter in his prime, and could set the stage for a 
series of big fights among the smaller fighters. 
</P>
<P>
	But though it may be a fight fan's favorite, it comes nowhere  
near being the event that Leonard-Hearns was when they met for the 
first time at Caesars Palace nearly two decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``We generated far more intrigue, far more interest,'' Leonard  
said. ``Thomas Hearns was a personality. I was a personality. 
Everybody knew the power Thomas Hearns had and everyone knew what a 
ring technician I was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leonard and Hearns were brought in by promoter Bob Arum to help  
generate interest in the fight, which matches two undefeated 
fighters who have distinctly different styles and have both been 
champions in the 147-pound class. 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya may be the biggest name in boxing outside of Mike  
Tyson, but only those in the know have heard much about Quartey, 
despite his impressive credentials. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were concerned about how this fight would sell because of  
Quartey's relative anonymity,'' Arum said. ``He's from Ghana and 
doesn't talk much so people don't know about him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya, fighting in his 18th title bout at the age of 26,  
will be defending for the sixth time the WBC welterweight title he 
first won from Julio Cesar Chavez. 
</P>
<P>
	He'll be doing it against a big puncher who is 34-0-1 with 29  
knockouts and held the WBA version of the title before having to 
relinquish it to go after big money fights. 
</P>
<P>
	``I need to fight the tough guys to bring out the best in me,''  
De La Hoya said. ``I really can't wait to get into the ring because 
I know it will be a very tough fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quartey said little at Wednesday's final prefight news  
conference, though he did make a grand entrance behind a half-dozen 
people chanting his name and holding large yellow ``I Like Ike'' 
signs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been waiting for this opportunity all my life,'' said  
Quartey, who will receive some $3 million for the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Arum said some 12,000 tickets had been sold for the fight at  
UNLV's campus arena. It will be available on pay-per-view for a 
suggested retail of $39.95. 
</P>

	De La Hoya is a 3 1/2-1 favorite, and should he win he would fight  
again in May against the winner of the Frankie Randall-Oba Carr 
fight on the undercard. Then, he would likely either fight Felix 
Trinidad or a rematch with Pernell Whitaker sometime in the fall.

<HEADLINE>  Sponsor Criticizes Olympic Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For the first time since the Salt Lake bribery  
scandal broke, criticism of Olympic leadership is coming from a key 
member of the tight-knit community that runs the games. 
</P>
<P>
	David D'Alessandro, the top official of Olympics sponsor John  
Hancock insurance, said Tuesday that the International Olympic 
Committee does not want to deal with the corruption case. 
D'Alessandro hinted that the IOC's president, Juan Antonio 
Samaranch, might be nearing the final days of his once-unchallenged 
reign. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still think Kenny Rogers said it best: `Know when to hold  
'em, know when to fold 'em, know when to walk away, know when to 
run,''' D'Alessandro said. ``I think Samaranch is getting close to 
the end of his `fold 'em' stage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president and chief operations officer of John Hancock said  
the IOC had become ``a cult of royals'' that was incapable of 
making the radical changes necessary to bounce back from the worst 
scandal in its history. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each day, the IOC loses a bit more credibility,'' he said.  
``It's clear the leaders of the IOC want to wake up, and this is 
all gone away and they have their club back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	D'Alessandro also said he was canceling negotiations with NBC  
for $20 million in ads to protest the IOC's failure to deal with 
the growing corruption scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to buy a nickel of advertising on NBC until we  
are confident the IOC is going in the right direction,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The move was meant to pressure the network, the single biggest  
revenue source for the IOC with a $3.57 billion rights contract, to 
try to convince the committee of the need for meaningful change. 
</P>
<P>
	``NBC tells them to change, you don't think the IOC will listen?  
What are they going to do, go find someone else?'' D'Alessandro 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC spokeswoman Maria Battaglia said the network was unaware of  
D'Alessandro's decision on the ads. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had no issues with other advertisers,'' she said.  
``We've continued to have tremendous interest in the Olympics and 
have closed major deals with several advertisers in the past few 
weeks. They've understood that the Olympics are about the games and 
the athletes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Lausanne, Switzerland, IOC marketing director Michael Payne  
downplayed the John Hancock move. 
</P>
<P>
	``They aren't withdrawing from their sponsorship,'' he said.  
``This issue is related to a media purchase which is separate from 
the sponsorship. ... The sponsors are standing, first of all, 
behind the games, and, second, behind the steps and action the IOC 
is taking'' to clean house. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Alessandro, whose company pays about $50 million to be the  
official life insurance and annuities sponsor of the Olympics and 
use the five-ring logo in its ads, said there have been only two 
high points for the IOC since the scandal broke in early December. 
</P>
<P>
	One, he said, was when vice president Dick Pound was appointed  
to investigate the Salt Lake allegations for the IOC ``instead of 
one of their ventriloquist dummies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The second, he continued, came when nine members of the IOC  
resigned or were expelled and Samaranch apologized for the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the first moment in which the sponsors correctly said,  
`Oh, he gets it,''' D'Alessandro said. ``You know what? That was 
the last moment when it could be correctly said, `Oh, he gets 
it.''' 
</P>
<P>
	For weeks, D'Alessandro has closed ranks with other sponsors and  
sports officials in defending Samaranch and the IOC, although 
warning that solid action was needed to save the value of the 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	But now, he said, he was putting together a plan to distance his  
company from the committee despite a contract that runs through the 
Sydney Games in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he has removed the Olympic rings from his company's  
annual report and from correspondence due to be sent out over the 
next few months. 
</P>
<P>
	The rings also have been removed from John Hancock billboards at  
Fenway Park in Boston and other stadiums and arenas, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to go to the expense of putting them back on,''  
he said. While the IOC contract offered no direct escape clause, 
``you don't have to promote it, you don't have to use the rings,'' 
D'Alessandro added. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said that if the rings become too devalued as an  
advertising tool, ``we would approach it as we would if we had 
bought the Olympic car. If that car does not operate properly and 
as expected, you no longer drive that car.''

<HEADLINE>  Iverson Slumps but 76ers Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Allen Iverson's eyes still light up when he  
gets the ball in his hands. His expression changes once he releases 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	The ball goes up and Iverson winces like a player in a major  
shooting slump. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the Philadelphia 76ers' star point guard is having fun  
lately. But it has nothing to do with 40- or 50-point games. The 
surprising 76ers are unbeaten even though Iverson is missing 73 
percent of his shots. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who knows what will happen when I play a good game,'' Iverson  
said. ``Whenever that may be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 76ers, 3-0 for the first time since 1984, are winning with  
defense and balanced scoring. Even Iverson can't believe it. Since 
Philadelphia made him the No. 1 pick in the draft in 1996, Iverson 
has been a raw, relentless scorer. 
</P>
<P>
	He had little help in his first two seasons, and the 76ers kept  
losing. 
</P>
<P>
	While making a push for the rookie of the year award in 1996, he  
made plenty of enemies when he broke Wilt Chamberlain's record with 
four straight 40-point games. He scored 50 in Cleveland in the 
record-breaking game, leaving a hostile crowd with no choice but to 
give him a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, the 76ers were well out of the playoff hunt by then,  
lending credence to Iverson's reputation as a supposedly selfish 
player who cared only about his stats. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, he's too busy winning games to worry about numbers -- even  
if his numbers are atrocious. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I came out and was scoring all those 40- and 50-point  
games, we were losing every time because nobody else was getting 
involved. ... I can't come out and score 35, 36 points every night 
and then come up with L's. I mean, we need other guys to play 
basketball,'' Iverson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Apparently, the 76ers listen to their 23-year-old leader.  
</P>
<P>
	A swarming defense is anchored by twin towers Theo Ratliff and  
Matt Geiger, who combined for eight of the team's season-high 13 
blocks in a 90-86 victory over the Detroit Pistons on Tuesday 
night. Harvey Grant, one of the top defensive forwards in the 
league, kept Grant Hill under control and had four blocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill, coming off a career-high 46 points against Washington,  
scored 32 points against the 76ers on 11-for-18 shooting. Iverson 
had 19 points, but was 6-for-20 from the field. He's averaging only 
16.7 points and has made only 15 of 55 shots in the three games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm resorting back to my high school ways where I used to miss  
shots and get frustrated,'' Iverson said. ``These last three games 
have been tough offensively for me, but I was just trying to do the 
other things on the court, just stay involved with everything. We 
have people who are putting the ball in the hole.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Geiger, who signed a $52 million, six-year contract as a free  
agent, is giving Ratliff some much needed help in the middle. 
Though disjointed and even clumsy at times, the 7-foot-1 center has 
allowed Ratliff to move to his natural position of power forward, 
where he is wreaking havoc with 11 blocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're definitely playing well, things are going good and we're  
winning ball games,'' Geiger said. ``But if we were 0-3, I wouldn't 
say we're the worst team and we're not going to make the playoffs. 
It's the same with 3-0. We're not going to win every game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Larry Brown's decision to move Tim Thomas from the  
starting lineup to the bench has paid off. Thomas had 10 points in 
15 minutes on Tuesday night after scoring 13 points in 14 minutes 
in a 95-75 victory over Orlando in the home opener. 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie Larry Hughes has looked overmatched at times, but he came  
off the bench to score 16 points against the Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson, whose nickname is the Answer because his line of shoes  
bears that name, isn't the only one any more. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy. I'm not frustrated at all,'' Iverson said. ``As  
long as there's tomorrow, everything's all right with me. I could 
play 10 more bad games in a row as long as we win.''

<HEADLINE> Japan Banks May Limit Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's financial authorities have asked two major  
banks to withdraw completely from overseas operations as a 
precondition to receiving public funds, a newspaper reported 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tokai and Asahi banks announced large stock losses in their  
midterm results, prompting the Financial Restructuring Committee to 
request them to restrict their activities to the domestic market, 
the Sankei Shimbun said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokai and Asahi are among a number of debt-ridden Japanese banks  
that are requesting money from a public fund created last year to 
strengthen the ailing financial system. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the Financial Restructuring Committee and the banks  
denied such requests had officially been made. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hideyuki Takahashi, an official at the committee's risk  
management division, said that the committee might have made ``some 
suggestions'' to the banks, urging them to improve aspects of their 
restructuring plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Asahi and Tokai, two of Japan's largest city banks, announced in  
September that they would form a broad alliance creating Japan's 
largest banking network with nearly 700 branches, including about 
100 overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	The two banks said they have no intention to withdraw completely  
from overseas operations, even if authorities ask them to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokai Bank spokeswoman Chie Arai said that the bank has already  
shrunk its foreign business and that ``there will be no complete 
withdrawal from overseas operations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two banks had previously said they would scale back the  
number of overseas bases when they originally applied for public 
funds -- Tokai to 55 from 63 and Asahi to 22 from 36 over the next 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokai Bank originally requested $2.63 billion to $3.50 billion  
plus an unspecified amount of additional money in public funds, 
while Asahi Bank asked for some $3.50 billion to $4.39 billion in 
taxpayer money.

<TEXT>
<P>
	Five days into the NBA season, only four teams remain  
undefeated. 
</P>
<P>
	It's no surprise in the West that Utah and Seattle are both 3-0,  
but look who's unblemished in the East -- Milwaukee and 
Philadelphia! 
</P>
<P>
	The Jazz, Sonics, Bucks and 76ers all won Tuesday night to keep  
their perfect records intact. 
</P>
<P>
	Karl Malone scored 31 points as Utah improved to 3-0 for the  
first time in a decade by beating Dallas 90-79. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Payton scored 20 and the SuperSonics had an easy time  
against Golden State, beating the Warriors 90-71 for Seattle's 
first 3-0 start since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray Allen took a hard fall to the floor while battling for a  
rebound with Charles Oakley, but returned in the fourth quarter to 
start a game-breaking run as the Bucks (2-0) beat the Toronto 
Raptors 91-77. 
</P>
<P>
	Theo Ratliff had 10 points, nine rebounds and five of  
Philadelphia's season-high 13 blocks as the Sixers improved to 3-0 
for the first time since 1984-85 by defeating previously unbeaten 
Detroit 90-86. 
</P>
<P>
	In other NBA games, Boston defeated Miami 108-101, Minnesota  
plodded past San Antonio 74-70, Atlanta defeated Chicago 87-71 and 
Sacramento topped Phoenix 112-95. 
</P>
<P>
	``Utah may be the best team in the league now,'' said Cedric  
Ceballos of the Mavericks, whose team hung with the Jazz for 3 1/2 
quarters before Malone led a late charge that iced the win. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah, which also beat the Lakers and Bulls, has never started  
4-0 in the 25-year history of the franchise. That chance will come 
Thursday night at Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	Malone, who scored 21 and 28 points against the Bulls and  
Lakers, put the Jazz ahead 76-74 with a bucket with 6:37 to go, and 
Dallas folded after that. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just keep scratching and clawing for every victory,'' John  
Stockton said. ``We showed again we can play defense when we need 
to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Howard Eisley had 11 points for the Jazz, making him the only  
other Utah player in double figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas coach Don Nelson said Utah showed why it should be  
favored to win the NBA championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``They did what great teams are supposed to do,'' Nelson said.  
``They just picked up apart in the fourth quarter. We played very 
well for three quarters, but good teams turn it on in the fourth 
period.'' 
</P>
<P>
                     *SuperSonics 90, Warriors 71    	
</P>
<P>
	At Seattle, the Sonics took care of this one early, allowing the  
reserves to play the entire fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Rashard Lewis, the Sonics' second-round pick out of high school,  
punctuated the victory with 17 seconds left on a slam dunk off a 
feed by Moochie Norris. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle coach Paul Westphal gave Don MacLean and rookies  
Vladimir Stepania, Lewis and Jelani McCoy their first playing time 
of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was great to get a couple of minutes and get the feel of an  
NBA game,'' Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sonics center Olden Polynice made his first 3-pointer since the  
1995-96 season, and Vin Baker went 0-for-4 from the line -- making 
him 0-for-10 for the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're 3-0 and that's great. I look at myself and think about  
what we can do once I start clicking,'' Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
                        *Bucks 91, Raptors 77    	
</P>
<P>
	Toronto rookie Vince Carter led all scorers with 22 points and  
brought the 14,577 fans at Maple Leafs Garden to their feet by 
finishing off an alley-oop pass from Dee Brown to cut the Bucks' 
lead to 72-70 with 6:50 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	But Allen followed with a pair of free throws to start an 11-0  
run capped by Vinny Del Negro's uncontested layup for an 81-70 lead 
with 3:48 to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a fourth-quarter team,'' Allen said. ``If the game is up  
and down in the fourth, we're a shoo-in to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glenn Robinson finished with 16 points, Dell Curry added 15 and  
Terrell Brandon 14. 
</P>
<P>
                        *76ers 90, Pistons 86    	
</P>
<P>
	At Philadelphia, Matt Geiger had 16 points and three blocks, and  
Harvey Grant recorded the other four rejections in a swat-fest that 
handed the Pistons their first loss in four games. 
</P>
<P>
	Grant Hill had 32 points to lead the Pistons, who were playing  
their third game in three nights. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fans and the media are making a big deal of three games in  
three days, but the players really like it,'' said Hill, coming off 
a career-high 46 points against Washington. ``I'd rather play than 
practice any day.'' 
</P>
<P>
                        *Celtics 108, Heat 101    	
</P>
<P>
	At Miami, Antoine Walker scored 31 points to help Boston beat  
the shorthanded Heat for the first time in three years. 
</P>
<P>
	``This feels good,'' Walker said. ``The monkey is off our back.  
Miami has always been at the top of the division, which gives us a 
lot of confidence early in the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Heat completed the first stretch of three games in three  
nights in franchise history. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been almost 2 1/2 years since we had this kind of doubt,''  
coach Pat Riley said. ``We've got to find some combination, some 
way to make this thing work. We're not going to feel sorry for 
ourselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
                      *Timberwolves 74, Spurs 70    	
</P>
<P>
	At Minneapolis, the Wolves survived poor shooting nights from  
Stephon Marbury and Kevin Garnett. 
</P>
<P>
	Garnett, who shot 6-for-25, barely beat the shot clock with a  
short jumper to give the Wolves a 68-66 lead, their biggest since 
the first quarter, with 1:24 left. 
</P>
<P>
	Marbury, who was 6-for-19, hit a 15-foot jumper to break a  
68-all tie with 43 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	Garnett then forced a turnover with 33 seconds left and Marbury  
another with 10 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Hawks 87, Bulls 71    	
</P>
<P>
	Chicago fell behind 13-2 and 22-6 in its home opener and then  
rallied within two in the third quarter before Atlanta pulled away. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Smith scored 30 points, including 14 in the final quarter.  
Alan Henderson and Grant Long added 14 points apiece, while Dikembe 
Mutombo had 11 points and 14 rebounds.

<HEADLINE>  Iverson Slumps but 76ers Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Allen Iverson's eyes still light up when he  
gets the ball in his hands. His expression changes once he releases 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	The ball goes up and Iverson winces like a player in a major  
shooting slump. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the Philadelphia 76ers' star point guard is having fun  
lately. But it has nothing to do with 40- or 50-point games. The 
surprising 76ers are unbeaten even though Iverson is missing 73 
percent of his shots. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who knows what will happen when I play a good game,'' Iverson  
said. ``Whenever that may be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 76ers, 3-0 for the first time since 1984, are winning with  
defense and balanced scoring. Even Iverson can't believe it. Since 
Philadelphia made him the No. 1 pick in the draft in 1996, Iverson 
has been a raw, relentless scorer. 
</P>
<P>
	He had little help in his first two seasons, and the 76ers kept  
losing. 
</P>
<P>
	While making a push for the rookie of the year award in 1996, he  
made plenty of enemies when he broke Wilt Chamberlain's record with 
four straight 40-point games. He scored 50 in Cleveland in the 
record-breaking game, leaving a hostile crowd with no choice but to 
give him a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, the 76ers were well out of the playoff hunt by then,  
lending credence to Iverson's reputation as a supposedly selfish 
player who cared only about his stats. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, he's too busy winning games to worry about numbers -- even  
if his numbers are atrocious. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I came out and was scoring all those 40- and 50-point  
games, we were losing every time because nobody else was getting 
involved. ... I can't come out and score 35, 36 points every night 
and then come up with L's. I mean, we need other guys to play 
basketball,'' Iverson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Apparently, the 76ers listen to their 23-year-old leader.  
</P>
<P>
	A swarming defense is anchored by twin towers Theo Ratliff and  
Matt Geiger, who combined for eight of the team's season-high 13 
blocks in a 90-86 victory over the Detroit Pistons on Tuesday 
night. Harvey Grant, one of the top defensive forwards in the 
league, kept Grant Hill under control and had four blocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill, coming off a career-high 46 points against Washington,  
scored 32 points against the 76ers on 11-for-18 shooting. Iverson 
had 19 points, but was 6-for-20 from the field. He's averaging only 
16.7 points and has made only 15 of 55 shots in the three games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm resorting back to my high school ways where I used to miss  
shots and get frustrated,'' Iverson said. ``These last three games 
have been tough offensively for me, but I was just trying to do the 
other things on the court, just stay involved with everything. We 
have people who are putting the ball in the hole.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Geiger, who signed a $52 million, six-year contract as a free  
agent, is giving Ratliff some much needed help in the middle. 
Though disjointed and even clumsy at times, the 7-foot-1 center has 
allowed Ratliff to move to his natural position of power forward, 
where he is wreaking havoc with 11 blocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're definitely playing well, things are going good and we're  
winning ball games,'' Geiger said. ``But if we were 0-3, I wouldn't 
say we're the worst team and we're not going to make the playoffs. 
It's the same with 3-0. We're not going to win every game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Larry Brown's decision to move Tim Thomas from the  
starting lineup to the bench has paid off. Thomas had 10 points in 
15 minutes on Tuesday night after scoring 13 points in 14 minutes 
in a 95-75 victory over Orlando in the home opener. 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie Larry Hughes has looked overmatched at times, but he came  
off the bench to score 16 points against the Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson, whose nickname is the Answer because his line of shoes  
bears that name, isn't the only one any more. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy. I'm not frustrated at all,'' Iverson said. ``As  
long as there's tomorrow, everything's all right with me. I could 
play 10 more bad games in a row as long as we win.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	Five days into the NBA season, only four teams remain  
undefeated. 
</P>
<P>
	It's no surprise in the West that Utah and Seattle are both 3-0,  
but look who's unblemished in the East -- Milwaukee and 
Philadelphia! 
</P>
<P>
	The Jazz, Sonics, Bucks and 76ers all won Tuesday night to keep  
their perfect records intact. 
</P>
<P>
	Karl Malone scored 31 points as Utah improved to 3-0 for the  
first time in a decade by beating Dallas 90-79. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Payton scored 20 and the SuperSonics had an easy time  
against Golden State, beating the Warriors 90-71 for Seattle's 
first 3-0 start since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray Allen took a hard fall to the floor while battling for a  
rebound with Charles Oakley, but returned in the fourth quarter to 
start a game-breaking run as the Bucks (2-0) beat the Toronto 
Raptors 91-77. 
</P>
<P>
	Theo Ratliff had 10 points, nine rebounds and five of  
Philadelphia's season-high 13 blocks as the Sixers improved to 3-0 
for the first time since 1984-85 by defeating previously unbeaten 
Detroit 90-86. 
</P>
<P>
	In other NBA games, Boston defeated Miami 108-101, Minnesota  
plodded past San Antonio 74-70, Atlanta defeated Chicago 87-71 and 
Sacramento topped Phoenix 112-95. 
</P>
<P>
	``Utah may be the best team in the league now,'' said Cedric  
Ceballos of the Mavericks, whose team hung with the Jazz for 3 1/2 
quarters before Malone led a late charge that iced the win. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah, which also beat the Lakers and Bulls, has never started  
4-0 in the 25-year history of the franchise. That chance will come 
Thursday night at Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	Malone, who scored 21 and 28 points against the Bulls and  
Lakers, put the Jazz ahead 76-74 with a bucket with 6:37 to go, and 
Dallas folded after that. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just keep scratching and clawing for every victory,'' John  
Stockton said. ``We showed again we can play defense when we need 
to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Howard Eisley had 11 points for the Jazz, making him the only  
other Utah player in double figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas coach Don Nelson said Utah showed why it should be  
favored to win the NBA championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``They did what great teams are supposed to do,'' Nelson said.  
``They just picked up apart in the fourth quarter. We played very 
well for three quarters, but good teams turn it on in the fourth 
period.'' 
</P>
<P>
                     *SuperSonics 90, Warriors 71    	
</P>
<P>
	At Seattle, the Sonics took care of this one early, allowing the  
reserves to play the entire fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Rashard Lewis, the Sonics' second-round pick out of high school,  
punctuated the victory with 17 seconds left on a slam dunk off a 
feed by Moochie Norris. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle coach Paul Westphal gave Don MacLean and rookies  
Vladimir Stepania, Lewis and Jelani McCoy their first playing time 
of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was great to get a couple of minutes and get the feel of an  
NBA game,'' Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sonics center Olden Polynice made his first 3-pointer since the  
1995-96 season, and Vin Baker went 0-for-4 from the line -- making 
him 0-for-10 for the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're 3-0 and that's great. I look at myself and think about  
what we can do once I start clicking,'' Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
                        *Bucks 91, Raptors 77    	
</P>
<P>
	Toronto rookie Vince Carter led all scorers with 22 points and  
brought the 14,577 fans at Maple Leafs Garden to their feet by 
finishing off an alley-oop pass from Dee Brown to cut the Bucks' 
lead to 72-70 with 6:50 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	But Allen followed with a pair of free throws to start an 11-0  
run capped by Vinny Del Negro's uncontested layup for an 81-70 lead 
with 3:48 to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a fourth-quarter team,'' Allen said. ``If the game is up  
and down in the fourth, we're a shoo-in to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glenn Robinson finished with 16 points, Dell Curry added 15 and  
Terrell Brandon 14. 
</P>
<P>
                        *76ers 90, Pistons 86    	
</P>
<P>
	At Philadelphia, Matt Geiger had 16 points and three blocks, and  
Harvey Grant recorded the other four rejections in a swat-fest that 
handed the Pistons their first loss in four games. 
</P>
<P>
	Grant Hill had 32 points to lead the Pistons, who were playing  
their third game in three nights. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fans and the media are making a big deal of three games in  
three days, but the players really like it,'' said Hill, coming off 
a career-high 46 points against Washington. ``I'd rather play than 
practice any day.'' 
</P>
<P>
                        *Celtics 108, Heat 101    	
</P>
<P>
	At Miami, Antoine Walker scored 31 points to help Boston beat  
the shorthanded Heat for the first time in three years. 
</P>
<P>
	``This feels good,'' Walker said. ``The monkey is off our back.  
Miami has always been at the top of the division, which gives us a 
lot of confidence early in the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Heat completed the first stretch of three games in three  
nights in franchise history. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been almost 2 1/2 years since we had this kind of doubt,''  
coach Pat Riley said. ``We've got to find some combination, some 
way to make this thing work. We're not going to feel sorry for 
ourselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
                      *Timberwolves 74, Spurs 70    	
</P>
<P>
	At Minneapolis, the Wolves survived poor shooting nights from  
Stephon Marbury and Kevin Garnett. 
</P>
<P>
	Garnett, who shot 6-for-25, barely beat the shot clock with a  
short jumper to give the Wolves a 68-66 lead, their biggest since 
the first quarter, with 1:24 left. 
</P>
<P>
	Marbury, who was 6-for-19, hit a 15-foot jumper to break a  
68-all tie with 43 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	Garnett then forced a turnover with 33 seconds left and Marbury  
another with 10 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Hawks 87, Bulls 71    	
</P>
<P>
	Chicago fell behind 13-2 and 22-6 in its home opener and then  
rallied within two in the third quarter before Atlanta pulled away. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Smith scored 30 points, including 14 in the final quarter.  
Alan Henderson and Grant Long added 14 points apiece, while Dikembe 
Mutombo had 11 points and 14 rebounds.

<HEADLINE> Hollywood Cemetery Dignity Restored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- There's been another face lift in Hollywood.  
</P>
<P>
	New life has been breathed into the 100-year-old Hollywood  
Memorial Park Cemetery -- renamed Hollywood Forever by its new 
owners -- and the graveyard's permanent celebrity residents are now 
showcased in a setting befitting their fame. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawns, roads and roofs have been repaired or replaced. There is  
a new look to the buildings, including the sun-splashed chapel 
leading into an elegant columbarium with glass-paned niches. Two 
decades of decay and neglect have been erased. 
</P>
<P>
	The once crumbling mausoleum where Benjamin ``Bugsy'' Siegel is  
entombed has been revitalized and pigeons have been shooed away. 
The road near the grave of Douglas Fairbanks Sr. has been repaved. 
The skylights over Rudolph Valentino's crypt have been fixed. 
</P>
<P>
	Palm trees sway over emerald lawns covering the graves of Peter  
Lorre, Tyrone Power, Harry Cohn, Cecil B. DeMille, John Huston, 
Nelson Eddy and Carl ``Alfalfa'' Switzer. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``That's All Folks'' epitaph on Mel Blanc's tombstone is now  
polished. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a place to be proud of again,'' said Tyler Cassity, who  
came to California to restore what he views as nothing less than a 
historic treasure. Cassity, whose father owns a mortuary chain in 
St. Louis, and his investors bought the cemetery for $375,000. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Hollywood sign looming in the distance, workers quietly  
go about completing the first phase of the $7 million 
rehabilitation project while relatives place flowers on graves, 
children play on lawns, and tourists wander the grounds clutching 
free maps to celebrity graves. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cemeteries aren't spooky anymore,'' the 28-year-old Cassity  
said. ``People want to see the old monuments and statues here. 
We're not like the lawn parks. The more people there are, the more 
alive it is. We're taking away that stigma of death. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you see a bunch of children frolicking on your grass, it  
makes you feel good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cassity welcomes tourists and fans, including the annual  
migration of Valentino fans on the anniversary of his death, but 
tour buses are forbidden on the 620-acre site behind Paramount 
Studios. 
</P>
<P>
	Hearses occasionally turn off busy Santa Monica Boulevard with  
new arrivals. 
</P>
<P>
	The cemetery's mortuary is up and running, and the crematory (45  
percent of California corpses go up in smoke) will be fired up 
soon. The Mamas &AMP; the Papas singer Cass Elliot was the last person 
cremated at the Hollywood cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
	New mausoleums are being added to increase capacity by 60,000 --  
mostly by eliminating some roads. There are 80,000 remains already 
at Hollywood Forever. 
</P>
<P>
	Several years ago, the Hollywood Cemetery Association, which  
owned the graveyard, filed for bankruptcy protection amid 
allegations of fiscal impropriety. Several purchase deals fell 
through before Cassity bought it last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Considered by many to be the cemetery's savior, Cassity is  
brimming with enthusiasm about the make-over. Early on, he saw 
promise in the bankrupt property. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was described to me as a total disaster,'' he said. ``When  
we came here monuments were face down. Thirty percent of the 
monuments needed to be reset. There was neglect, but I thought 
neglect was easy to correct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides decay and disrepair, considerable damage was caused by  
the 1994 earthquake, and the 1998 El Nino rains flooded ponds and 
the cemetery lake. Cassity has cleaned all that up, saying, ``I've 
been a strict cemeterian for a year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new owner has also introduced an array of video and digital  
services for families. 
</P>
<P>
	California, which has long pioneered innovative send-offs for  
the dearly departed, offered the perfect climate for this death 
business maverick. 
</P>
<P>
	Families can now enter a video kiosk -- a small viewing room --  
where a giant computer-activated television plays videotaped 
goodbyes and biographical epitaphs of the dead. Thousands of videos 
are already produced. 
</P>
<P>
	The dead can soon be downloaded from anywhere by tapping into  
the Hollywood Forever video library on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	A no-frills biography is $400, and the all-out production is  
about $5,000. But the average is about $1,100. 
</P>
<P>
	Cassity also wants to offer DNA analysis of the deceased for  
inscription on a CD-ROM. It would cost about $400 for the analysis. 
The CD and a lock of hair would be stored at the cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
	The way Cassity sees it, who knows what future advances will be  
made in science and technology? 
</P>
<P>
	``We treat it as a laboratory for ideas,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Drug Co. Sells a Benefits Division </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Drugmakers wield too much power in influencing  
which medicines are provided to patients by health insurance plans, 
consumer groups say. 
</P>
<P>
	That's why many consumer advocates on Tuesday cheered a move by  
SmithKline Beecham to sell its pharmacy benefits division, becoming 
the second drug company in three months to quit the business. 
</P>
<P>
	Seeking to refocus on its core drug business and raise cash to  
increase research spending, SmithKline agreed to sell Diversified 
Pharmaceutical Services to Express Scripts for $700 million. That's 
just a third of what SmithKline paid to acquire Diversified in 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 115 million Americans are enrolled in prescription  
drug plans administered by pharmacy benefit managers. Those 
companies decide what medicines insurance plans will pay for -- 
compiling lists called formularies -- and encourage doctors to 
prescribe only those drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Health insurers consider formularies a valuable weapon in  
controlling costs, but consumer groups worry about the dangers in 
limiting which brands patients can use. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer advocates complain that when a drugmaker owns a drug  
benefits company, the benefits manager tends to promote drugs made 
by its parent company -- regardless of whether competing drugs are 
better or less expensive. 
</P>
<P>
	SmithKline's sale was expected after Eli Lilly sold its pharmacy  
benefits company in November to drugstore giant Rite Aid for $1.5 
billion. Notably, that price tag also represents just a third of 
what Lilly paid for PCS Health Systems in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Merck is now the only major drugmaker still owning a pharmacy  
benefit management company. Merck said it has no plans to divest 
Medco. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with two divestitures, consumer advocates maintain that  
pharmacy benefit management companies -- no matter who owns them -- 
hold too much power in controlling consumer access to prescription 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	With health insurers trying to combat spiraling drug costs, the  
benefit managers they hire are under pressure to promote cheaper 
drugs to doctors and patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, drug manufacturers will still be able to wield influence  
over pharmacy benefit managers by offering huge discounts and 
rebates. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is still influence peddling, so consumers still have to  
watch out,'' said Dr. Sidney Wolfe of the consumer advocacy group 
Public Citizen. 
</P>
<P>
	While consumer advocates hope Merck will follow the lead of its  
competitors, analysts say its unlikely because Medco is profitable. 
</P>
<P>
	Merck's $6.6 billion purchase of Medco in 1993 marked the first  
time a drug company bought a pharmacy management firm. As a result, 
Merck got one of the best firms for a low price, said Alex Zisson, 
an analyst with Hambricht &AMP; Quist. 
</P>
<P>
	The big drugmakers initially bought pharmacy benefit firms out  
of a desire to control what doctors hear about drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the move perplexed some industry watchers.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was an unusual decision for an industry, which pursues  
higher drug costs, to invest in a business whose main performance 
requirement is to reduce drug costs,'' said Thomas Moore, a health 
policy fellow at George Washington University. 
</P>
<P>
	But the benefit firms gave drug companies much more than a way  
to get their drugs onto insurers formularies, also providing 
detailed information on prescription trends among millions of 
doctors and patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Employers and their insurance carriers have increasingly come to  
rely on benefit firms as drug costs increase at double digit rates. 
</P>
<P>
	But the industry faces more challenges than just controlling  
drug costs. Last year, the Food and Drug Administration issued 
draft guidelines that regulate how the companies can market their 
drugs and work with pharmaceutical firms.

<HEADLINE> 3 GOP Senators Say They'll Acquit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Three Republican senators declared Wednesday  
they would vote to acquit President Clinton on both articles of 
impeachment, the clearest sign yet that the vote to convict him 
would fall far short of the needed two-thirds majority and possibly 
even shy of 50 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Sens. James Jeffords of Vermont, Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania  
and John Chafee of Rhode Island -- moderate lawmakers from the 
Northeast -- were the first Republicans to announce opposition to 
both articles, perjury and obstruction of justice in the Monica 
Lewinsky affair. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of a second day of closed-door deliberations as the  
trial neared an end, a Democratic drive to censure Clinton 
sputtered under Republican opposition. Sen. Joseph Lieberman of 
Connecticut said that if GOP leaders thwart efforts to force a 
censure vote, supporters might simply draft a declaration 
condemning the president's behavior and circulate it for senators 
to sign. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffords said enough Republicans may vote against the articles  
of impeachment to keep the final roll calls on Thursday or Friday 
short of even 51 votes, although he subsequently softened his 
prediction. ``The pressure is coming on to get a majority,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Majority Leader Trent Lott said there had been  
no attempt by the leadership to line up votes for conviction. Lott, 
R-Miss., issued a statement at mid-afternoon declaring that the 
evidence ``shows that the president has committed perjury and 
obstructed justice. The only question left is, will the Senate vote 
to find him guilty of committing these high crimes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only a constitutional two-thirds -- 67 votes in the 100-member  
Senate -- could convict and oust Clinton, the second president in 
history to be put on trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., has disclosed that he will vote to  
convict Clinton for obstruction but to acquit for perjury. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Senate plodded through a second day of closed-door  
deliberations, Jeffords said Clinton ``gave misleading statements 
... did obstruct justice, but his actions in this case do not reach 
the high standard of impeachment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A short while later, Specter said the charges ``have not been  
proved'' at the historic month-long trial now drawing to a close. 
He said he wished Clinton, who refused to be questioned in writing 
or in person, had submitted to a ``firm examination'' by lawyers in 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Chafee stepped to the microphones in late afternoon to say that  
when it came to obstruction of justice, ``circumstantial evidence 
in each of the cases is rebutted by direct evidence or by 
confusion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With solid support among the Senate's 45 Democrats, the  
president has long been out of danger of conviction. Failure to 
deliver a simple majority for either article in the Senate, 
controlled by 55 Republicans, would be a stinging repudiation of 
the case that the GOP House voted to take to trial and its 13 
prosecutor-congressmen argued to the senators. 
</P>
<P>
	Gorton said Tuesday night he will vote for Clinton's conviction  
on the charge of obstruction of justice but not on perjury. ``I 
cannot will to my children and grandchildren the proposition that a 
president stands above the law and can systematically obstruct 
justice because both his polls and the Dow Jones index are high.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Clinton's acquittal assured, Democrats continued their  
campaign for a formal vote to censure the president after the 
trial. But Republican opposition seemed to be stiffening, and 
Specter said censure would violate the constitutional doctrine of 
separation of powers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's been very little mention of censure'' in the  
closed-door deliberations, said Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn. ``To me, 
the push for censure is losing steam.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic leader Tom Daschle is hoping for at least a  
procedural vote before lawmakers adjourn for a week-long vacation, 
a roll call that would allow Democrats to go on record condemning 
the president's behavior while acquitting him at his trial. 
</P>
<P>
	With Chief Justice William Rehnquist presiding, the Senate spent  
a second day behind closed doors, senators taking turns delivering 
their final statements. By day's end, an estimated 55 senators had 
spoken, and prospects for a final vote on Thursday were dimming. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside the shuttered Senate chamber, Republicans and Democrats  
took turns laying out their reasoning on the case. ``I think people 
were reaching for history, given the occasion,'' said Democratic 
Sen. Charles Schumer. 
</P>
<P>
	Other senators said there was very little give and take, mostly  
individual senators speaking from a lectern in the well of the 
Senate. ``The drama is going to be whether obstruction gets 50 
votes or not. It's going to be neck and neck,'' Schumer predicted. 
</P>
<P>
	A member of the GOP leaders, Sen. Connie Mack of Florida, said  
``I wouldn't be surprised'' if other Republicans join the ranks of 
those voting for acquittal on both counts. He declined to 
speculate, but Maine's Sens. Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, both 
of whom are among the more moderate Republicans, have yet to 
declare their intentions. 
</P>
<P>
	Chafee, Jeffords and Specter are among the most moderate  
Republicans in the Senate, and had long been viewed as possible 
votes for acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The facts and circumstances of this case are low and tawdry,  
but these same circumstances do not, in my opinion, cause his 
offenses to rise to the level of impeachable acts,'' Jeffords said. 
</P>
<P>
	Specter said that under Scottish law, three verdicts are  
possible: guilty, not guilty or not proved. He opted for the third. 
</P>
<P>
	Specter was critical of the trial itself, saying only ``partial  
justice'' had been served since House prosecutors were hampered by 
the Senate's unwillingness to call witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with CNN, Jeffords said six to seven Republicans  
might well vote to acquit on both counts, and possibly as many as 
12. He offered no elaboration. But a short while later, he told The 
Associated Press his earlier estimates may have been too high. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is diminishing,'' he said. ``The pressure is coming on to  
get a majority,'' he added, although he did not identify the source 
of the pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators were well aware of the precedent-setting nature of the  
moment. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffords said he was concerned that conviction of this president  
``may establish a low threshold that would make every president 
subject to removal for the slightest indiscretion or that a vote to 
convict may imperil every president who faces a Congress controlled 
by an opposing party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gorton said that by acquitting Clinton, ``the republic and its  
institutions will be weakened. One exception or excuse will lead to 
another, the right of the most powerful of our leaders to act 
outside the law -- or in violation of the law -- will be 
established.''

<HEADLINE> S.Korean IOC Member Took No Bribes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- A South Korean member of the  
International Olympic Committee has been cleared of any wrongdoing 
in an ever-expanding bribery scandal, his lawyer said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard Graff said a report by an ethics panel in Salt Lake City  
on Tuesday exonerated his client, Kim Un-yong, of accepting bribes 
from the Utah city's bid committee for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim distributed Graff's statement to dispute reports that the  
ethics panel's findings further implicated Kim in the biggest 
scandal in Olympic history. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics panel said bid committee records show it paid $45,000  
toward the salary of Kim's son, John, to work at Keystone 
Communications, a satellite communications company based in Salt 
Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	But Graff, a U.S. attorney representing the Kim family, said the  
panel's report merely proved that the bid committee's payment to 
Keystone was a private deal that did not involve Kim or his son. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any secret deal between the bid committee and Keystone was a  
contrivance solely between those two entities, and was wholly 
unknown to either Dr. Kim or to his son,'' Graff said. ``We are 
gratified that the ... report has finally exonerated Dr. Kim and 
his son.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kim reiterated that he has no intention of quitting the IOC's  
executive board. 
</P>
<P>
	``Such persistent attempts to smear both my reputation and the  
leadership of President (Juan Antonio) Samaranch are political and 
designed to undermine the stability of his leadership, as well as 
to affect the succession of his presidency,'' Kim said. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the time comes, I will fight back. I have a lot of  
ammunition,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim said he did not expect his opponents within the IOC to go so  
far as to try to expel him. ``That's too risky for them,'' Kim 
added, declining to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	So far 24 IOC members, roughly one-fifth of the IOC's total  
membership, are implicated in Salt Lake's vote-buying schemes. Kim 
is the highest ranking official among them. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim, 67, is a member of the IOC's inner circle and has widely  
been considered a possible successor to Samaranch in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics report said bid committee president Tom Welch  
arranged for Kim's son to work for Keystone after Kim sought his 
help. 
</P>
<P>
	``Human relationship is not a bad thing,'' Kim said. ``We meet a  
lot of people and we try to help each other. It's a good thing. I 
once found a job in Korea for a friend's daughter. We send uniforms 
for African athletes,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't receive any cash or any gifts. ... The point here is  
whether my son received any improper benefits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quoting the panel report, Graff said Keystone asked for  
reimbursement from the bid committee, saying it had not received 
``value'' from the relationship with Kim's son. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim has previously said Keystone paid consulting fees to his  
son's company, Komar International, based in Hackensack, N.J. At 
the same time, he has said, Komar was paying Keystone $40,000 for 
satellite transmissions to Korean television stations in the United 
States and Korea.

<HEADLINE> Dartmouth Frats Told To Admit Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HANOVER, N.H. (AP) -- The fraternities that helped inspire the  
movie ``Animal House'' should start accepting women members, 
Dartmouth College has decided. 
</P>
<P>
	The trustees and college President James Wright said the  
decision to have the frats go coed -- and the school's sororities, 
too -- is intended to encourage ``respectful relations between women 
and men'' and is part of a broad overhaul of social life at the Ivy 
League school. The changes, which the college hopes to begin 
implementing next school year, were announced in a letter to 
students Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fraternities and sororities as we have known them will be  
ended,'' Wright told The Boston Globe. ``There has been a sense ... 
that we needed to take significant steps, and this is a piece of 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wright said he and the trustees are prepared to weather the  
student and alumni opposition they expect from the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	More than a third of the college's 4,300 undergraduates are  
members of 25 single-sex fraternities and sororities. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright said decisions about how the new system will work won't  
be made until next school year, and it is not clear whether Greek 
houses will hold traditional rush next fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright said the trustees are prepared to spend ``tens of  
millions of dollars'' to change social and residential life. He 
said the college hopes to buy and refurbish fraternity and sorority 
houses, which are privately owned. 
</P>
<P>
	Hazing and abuse of alcohol have led to heightened concern about  
fraternities on campuses around the country. Former single-sex 
colleges including Colby, Williams and Bowdoin have eliminated 
fraternities. 
</P>
<P>
	But fraternities have endured at Dartmouth, which has had them  
for more than 158 years. One of its graduates, Chris Miller, 
co-wrote ``Animal House,'' the hit 1978 comedy about debauchery at 
fraternities. 
</P>
<P>
	The college began admitting women in the early 1970s, and now  
has sororities as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Greek system is strong here. There are many people, both  
at the college and alumni, who loved it and who are going to object 
to any change,'' said Jacob Elberg, editor of The Dartmouth. 
</P>
<P>
	The overhaul of residential and social life is aimed at giving  
students more choice in living arrangements, cutting the number of 
students who live off-campus, and reducing alcohol abuse, school 
officials said.

<HEADLINE> `Providence' is a Mayor's Dream </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- Mayor Vincent ``Buddy'' Cianci was giddy  
after watching the debut episode of NBC's much-hyped series 
``Providence'' on a large screen in a glitzy ballroom downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	He charmed the crowd of about 1,000 with a few jokes, then  
rolled a clip from episode No. 9 in which he makes a cameo as a 
mayor who wins a cooking contest. ``Buddy! Buddy! Buddy!'' the 
crowd chanted. 
</P>
<P>
	Never mind that the audio was muddy. Never mind that some  
critics have panned the melodrama as schmaltzy. Never mind that the 
characters have phony accents. 
</P>
<P>
	To Cianci and locals, the show is Providence's shot at national  
TV exposure, a chance to lure tourists and untold riches to Rhode 
Island's capital. A TV show named after his city was something even 
Cianci, tireless promoter of revitalized Providence, never dreamed 
of. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never thought it would get this big,'' said Cianci, who, in  
his exuberance, seated a reporter on his knee. ``The skyline is 
beautiful, the rivers are beautiful. The way they have made 
Providence look is fabulous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The question now for Cianci and his boosters is whether the show  
will be Providence's 15 minutes of fame or an enduring hit. Will it 
establish the gritty city as, to borrow a favorite term from the 
mayor, a ``Renaissance city''? 
</P>
<P>
	So far, things look good for ``Providence,'' which airs Friday  
at 8 p.m. EST. The first four episodes won high ratings, 
establishing the series as the season's most successful new drama. 
</P>
<P>
	The show also is a chance to remake the image of the city once  
known for its corruption -- Providence for years was headquarters to 
the New England Mob -- and showcase it as a delightful place to 
live. 
</P>
<P>
	If other cities that have been featured prominently in TV series  
are any indication, Providence could benefit. 
</P>
<P>
	The NBC show ``Miami Vice'' is said to have pumped $100 million  
annually into Florida's Dade County during the show's five-year run 
ending in 1989, according to figures from Cianci's office. CBS' 
``Northern Exposure'' brought thousands of tourists every weekend 
to Roslyn, Wash., which was depicted as a small Alaskan town. 
</P>
<P>
	In Baltimore, where the current NBC drama ``Homicide: Life on  
the Street'' is filmed, the show has boosted tourism and raised the 
number of inquiries from Hollywood about filming there, city 
officials say. A Baltimore hotel runs ``Homicide'' tours for 
visitors, and the show's producers spend about $500,000 per episode 
in the city, said Michael Styer, director of the Maryland Film 
Office. 
</P>
<P>
	In some ways, Providence is even luckier than Baltimore. Whereas  
``Homicide'' depicts murders and crimes in Baltimore, 
``Providence'' oozes sentimentality. The name of the series, a play 
on the divine intervention that brings the character back home, 
also doesn't hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish I had a show named `Maryland' or `Baltimore,''' Styer  
joked. 
</P>
<P>
	Although creator John Masius had never been to Providence before  
filming began, he liked the photographs sent to him by city and 
state film offices and thought the name ideally matched the theme 
of the series he had in mind. 
</P>
<P>
	The show depicts the life of Sydney Hansen (played by Melina  
Kanakaredes), who quits her job as a Los Angeles plastic surgeon 
and moves home to Providence to be with her family after her 
mother's death. She takes a job as a physician in a clinic for the 
poor and uninsured, reconnects with a long-lost high school 
sweetheart and tries to find meaning in her life. 
</P>
<P>
	The show so far has included shots of the East Side, home to  
Brown University and one of the largest concentrations of historic 
homes in New England, and other photogenic spots. At the premiere 
party at the Biltmore Hotel, various scenes in the opener won 
applause from the partisan crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, a cabbie drives Hansen over scenic bridges, past  
riverwalks and along Blackstone Boulevard, where some of the city's 
poshest homes are built. 
</P>
<P>
	As if that weren't enough to boost Cianci's ego, the cabbie  
turns to Hansen and says that since she has been living in Los 
Angeles for so long, she may not recognize downtown Providence 
because the mayor has done so much work renovating it. 
</P>
<P>
	It appears the show already is paying off for Providence. NBC  
this week announced it has picked the city for the Gravity Games, 
featuring such ``adrenaline sports'' as skateboarding. Cianci says 
NBC chose Providence over larger cities because it has spent so 
much money promoting ``Providence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cianci also has gotten some attention on Fox's animated TV  
television show ``Family Guy,'' set in Rhode Island and featuring a 
fictional Buddy Cianci Jr. High School. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was growing up, I used to tell people to avoid  
Providence because there was nothing here,'' said Mark Menard, who 
drove through whipping snows to attend last month's ``Providence'' 
party. ``It's taken a 180-degree turn. Now, it's vibrant and there 
is a pride among the people here.''

<HEADLINE> House Managers Blame Public Opinion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Resigned to losing their case, the House  
prosecutors say public opinion polls made a stronger impression on 
senators than any evidence that President Clinton committed high 
crimes and misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
	Lead prosecutor Henry Hyde of Illinois said he was ``baffled''  
by polls that showed Americans consistently opposed Clinton's 
removal no matter what evidence the 13 Republican managers on the 
prosecution team presented. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did feel that if we could get the story out in a coherent  
fashion the public might be informed and a change in the public's 
mind would reach the senators,'' Hyde said in an interview 
Wednesday as the Senate moved through its second day of closed 
deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's essential, for impeachment to prevail, to have bipartisan  
support. We never had it,'' the House Judiciary Committee chairman 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. agreed: ``The public opinion polls  
have been the hurdle for us. That is tough, to remove a popular 
president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In more than three weeks of arguments before 100 silent  
senators, the managers insisted that Clinton committed perjury 
before a grand jury and obstructed justice in his efforts to cover 
up his affair with Monica Lewinsky. And they argued strongly that 
the offenses met the constitutional standards for conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	But in poll after poll, constituents of the senator-jurors  
overwhelmingly opposed Clinton's removal. Surveys showed that 
two-thirds of Americans took this stance as the trial wound down. 
</P>
<P>
	As the 67 votes needed for Clinton's removal moved further out  
of reach, the president's approval rating hovered consistently 
above 60 percent. Approval for the Republicans' handling of the 
case never topped 40 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	And though impeachment duty endeared the prosecutors to  
conservatives, evidence began to mount that some of them were 
suffering back home. 
</P>
<P>
	A Chicago Tribune poll showed that three months after Hyde won  
easy re-election to his Illinois House seat, one-third of the 
voters in his conservative district said they had a lower opinion 
of him as a result of impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Jim Rogan, R-Calif., faced a difficult re-election even  
before he was appointed to the impeachment team. Though he outspent 
his Democratic opponent 2-to-1, Rogan was elected to his second 
House term last year with only 50.2 percent of the vote. Clinton 
won Rogan's Pasadena-area district by 49 percent in 1996, compared 
with 41 percent for Republican nominee Bob Dole. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Steve Chabot of Ohio is in a similar situation, embarking  
on the impeachment trial after he overcame a tight race to win 
re-election with 53 percent of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservatives predict voters will consider impeachment old news  
by the time the next Election Day rolls around. The managers point 
out that they only did the job the Constitution required after the 
House approved impeachment articles. And Hyde framed the question 
of political fallout when he told the Senate that ``upholding the 
rule of law'' was worth losing one's congressional seat. 
</P>
<P>
	Several managers lamented the Senate's restrictive trial rules.  
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly the procedures that we adopted in a bipartisan fashion  
were difficult,'' said sophomore Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., whose 
Fayetteville-area district has sent Republicans to Congress in 
every election since 1966. By one percentage point, Clinton 
narrowly won and lost the district in 1992 and 1996, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Charles Canady of Florida no longer worries about  
re-election because he has limited himself to eight years in the 
House, a period that expires next year. 
</P>
<P>
	He said of the trial, ``The basic facts of the case were the  
same'' as they were when Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr 
delivered his report to Congress in September. 
</P>
<P>
	With defeat imminent, the prosecutors returned to the House this  
week visibly relieved to be considering such normal legislative 
matters as federal spending and trade. 
</P>
<P>
	A few, such as Canady, went upstairs to the Rules Committee on  
Wednesday, where Chairman David Drier was holding an ice cream 
social. Even sweeter, said some of the managers, were the hearty 
back-slaps and words of support they got from Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone understands that this was a tough job,'' Rogan aid.

	GOP Opposes Censure Vote  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With President Clinton's acquittal assured,  
Democrats continued their campaign for a formal vote to censure him 
after the trial. But Republican opposition seemed to be stiffening, 
and Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said censure would violate the 
constitutional doctrine of separation of powers. Three Republican 
senators declared today they would vote to acquit on both articles 
of impeachment, the clearest sign yet that the vote to convict him 
would fall far short of the needed two-thirds majority. Democratic 
leader Tom Daschle is hoping for at least a procedural vote before 
lawmakers adjourn, a roll call that would allow Democrats to go on 
record condemning the president's behavior. 

</P>

	Robertson Returns To Lead Coalition  
</P>
<P>
	CHESAPEAKE, Va. (AP) -- Christian Coalition founder Pat Robertson  
has reassumed the presidency of the political organization after 
spending several years as a senior adviser, a spokeswoman said. 
Robertson angered some conservative leaders, including 
just-departed president Don Hodel, when he said last month that 
President Clinton had won the public relations battle and the 
Senate should end the impeachment trial. The coalition is in the 
midst of efforts to defend its own past political activities. The 
FEC has sued the coalition, accusing it of illegally spending 
thousands of dollars to promote Republican candidates. 

</P>

	Attempts To Set Ore. Ship Afire Fail  
</P>
<P>
	COOS BAY, Ore. (AP) -- Navy demolition experts with grenades  
failed to set fire to a grounded cargo ship tonight, leaving it 
vulnerable to an advancing storm that threatened to break it apart 
and cause a disastrous oil spill. Flames flickered and black smoke 
billowed out of the New Carissa, but within seconds the only thing 
burning aboard the 639-foot ship was a small smoldering fire in one 
cargo hold. Coast Guard officials had said that burning the ship 
could be like lighting a barbecue grill -- it could take several 
tries to get the heavy, low-grade oil to burn.

	Judge Orders Pilots To Halt Sickout

<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- A federal judge ordered American Airlines pilots  
to end their sickout and go back to work tomorrow, warning them 
they could be held in contempt of court if they don't. The pilots 
began calling in sick Saturday after talks broke down with the 
company about the salaries paid pilots of Reno Air, which AMR, 
American's parent, recently acquired. The dispute has forced the 
carrier to cancel 2,500 flights and stranded an estimated 200,000 
travelers.

	No Breakthrough in Colombia Talks  
</P>
<P>
	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Two days of talks between Colombian  
rebels and that country's presidential peace envoy concluded today 
with no breakthrough on ending a 34-year civil war, but both sides 
agreed to keep working towards a political solution, an envoy said. 
Victor Ricardo said discussions between himself and the National 
Liberation Army, Colombia's second largest guerrilla group, focused 
on establishing direct dialogue, ``humanizing'' the conflict and 
possible formal peace talks. The two sides agreed to meet again in

	Jury Wavering in NYC Guns Lawsuit  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A judge urged a wavering jury to try to overcome  
their differences and reach a verdict in the New York City 
class-action lawsuit against the nation's largest gun makers. 
Deliberations were to resume tomorrow. The case is considered a 
model for the lawsuits by cities throughout the nation. But a day 
after Georgia became the first state to shield gunmakers from 
product liability lawsuits by cities and counties, Louisiana Gov. 
Mike Foster today announced his support for a similar bill.

	Knicks Crush Wizards 101-88

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Knicks played the kind of unselfish  
team ball that had been missing in their first two games, getting 
double-figure scoring from five players to beat the Washington 
Wizards 101-88 tonight and gain their first victory of the season. 
It came without the assistance of Latrell Sprewell, who will be out 
3-6 weeks with a stress fracture of his right heel. Larry Johnson 
scored 18 points, Patrick Ewing and Charlie Ward added 16 apiece 
and Chris Childs came off the bench for 13 points, nine assists and 
eight rebounds.

<HEADLINE> Woman Barred From Contacting Pitt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A woman who allegedly climbed through a  
window at Brad Pitt's home and stayed for 10 hours was barred from 
contacting the actor and must stay 100 yards away from him for the 
next three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Superior Court Commissioner Victor Reichman told Athena Marie  
Rolando, 19, on Wednesday that Pitt ``certainly has a right to be 
free from intruders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pitt had been granted a temporary restraining order to keep the  
woman away, but his attorneys wanted a three-year order. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything is going to be fine,'' Ms. Rolando said outside  
court, adding, ``I'd actually like to file a restraining order 
against Mr. Pitt himself to stay away from me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In court documents, Pitt contends the woman left ``many menacing  
and bizarre letters'' at the front gate of his home beginning in 
September 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Rolando hoisted herself through a window of Pitt's home in  
the Santa Monica Mountains on Jan. 7 and spent 10 hours inside, 
police alleged. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitt, the star of ``Meet Joe Black'' and ``Legends of the  
Fall,'' was not home at the time.

<HEADLINE> Study Links Scars to Breast Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A microscopic change in breast tissue can help doctors predict  
whether a woman whose biopsy is benign may develop cancer, 
researchers reported today in the New England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	If the tissue has an abnormality called a radial scar, the woman  
is almost twice as likely to develop cancer, researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a microscope, normal breast tissue shows random clusters  
of ducts. Radial scars have a core of what appears to be scarred 
tissue surrounded by a cluster of ducts radiating outward. 
</P>
<P>
	Some studies found a link between radial scars and breast  
cancer, while others were inconclusive. The latest study, conducted 
at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Brigham and Women's 
Hospital in Boston, is believed to be the largest so far. 
</P>
<P>
	It looked at 1,396 women with benign breast biopsies.  
Ninety-nine had radial scars. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly one-third -- 32 -- of the women with radial scars later  
developed breast cancer, compared with 223, or about one-fifth, of 
those without the abnormalities. 
</P>
<P>
	The risks were higher among women with more and larger radial  
scars.

<HEADLINE> ABC May Boot Frank Gifford </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Frank Gifford is being forced out at ABC after  
his contract expires in June, according to a published report. 
</P>
<P>
	Gifford spent 27 years in the ``Monday Night Football''  
broadcast booth before Boomer Esiason replaced him before last 
season. Gifford switched to the pregame show. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Daily Variety, the network and Gifford are  
talking about other roles within ABC Sports. Network officials are 
considering a major overhaul of the pregame show. 
</P>
<P>
	Gifford's agent, Ron Konecky, told The Associated Press he has  
not been informed of a change in Gifford's role. An ABC spokesman 
declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The news came less than a week after Gifford's former partner,  
Dan Dierdorf, left ABC after the network decided not to renegotiate 
his $1.7 million a year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Dierdorf's departure was thought to be a cost-cutting move.  
Reportedly, Gifford's salary is higher than Dierdorf's. 
</P>
<P>
	Gifford is the only person to be in the NFL Hall of Fame as both  
a player and a broadcaster.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Holds Conference on Aging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Dramatizing gains made in life expectancy,  
a conference on aging opened at the United Nations on Wednesday by 
praising increased longevity as one of mankind's greatest 
achievements. 
</P>
<P>
	While the technological revolution has captured the public  
imagination, aging experts said a ``silent revolution'' of improved 
health, hygiene and nutrition has extended the average life span by 
several years in the past half century. 
</P>
<P>
	The global average for life expectancy has increased since the  
1950s from about 45 to nearly 63 years, according the U.N. 
Population Division. Figures for individual developed nations are 
higher, while those for less developed countries are lower. 
</P>
<P>
	But ambassador Julia Alvarez of the Dominican Republic and  
co-host of the two-day conference, cautioned that ``quoting 
statistics about aging will take us just so far. The problem is not 
counting, but consciousness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Figures on the world's increasingly elderly population presented  
at the conference to several hundred delegates from Europe, Brazil, 
Japan and elsewhere in Asia portend several elderly-specific 
challenges -- appropriate housing and care-giving among them: 
</P>
<P>
	--One of every 10 people is now 60 or older, with Japan having  
the highest percentage of any country. In the United States, one in 
six is 60 or older. By 2050, one of five in the world will be 60 or 
older. 
</P>
<P>
	--The older population -- those 60 and older -- is becoming  
increasingly urban. By next year, the majority of the world's older 
population will live in urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
	--The older population is itself aging. Currently, people 80 and  
older make up 11 percent of the population that is at least 60 
years old. By 2050, 27 percent of the older population will be over 
80. 
</P>
<P>
	--The majority of older people, 55 percent, are women. Among  
those 80 or older, 65 percent are women. Japanese women enjoy an 
average life expectancy of 83, versus 63 in Bolivia. 
</P>
<P>
	--Nine million of the 43 million Americans 60 and older live  
alone -- and 80 percent are women. 
</P>
<P>
	--Striking differences exist between regions with the elderly:  
one of five Europeans, for example, is 60 or older, compared to one 
of 20 Africans. By 2020, 46 percent of women 80 and older will live 
in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result of the increasingly aging population, the United  
Nations last month declared 1999 the International Year of Older 
Persons and organized a conference that concludes Thursday to show 
successful designs for the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
	Models shown by Sekisui House of Japan included Rokko Island  
City, where heights of tables, bathtubs and toilets were adjusted 
for the older, often-slumping or osteoporosis-ridden population and 
kitchens were designed to be more user-friendly for the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
	Hand rails were also made more easily accessible and at better  
heights for older residents in tubs, showers and public baths. In 
the community of Ouda in Nara, southern Japan, traffic lights were 
changed to give the elderly and infirm a full minute to cross 
streets more easily. 
</P>
<P>
	College architectural designs were shown from Tokyo, the New  
York metropolitan area, the University of Hawaii at Manoa, the New 
Jersey Institute of Technology, the University of New Mexico and 
Florida A&AMP;M. 
</P>
<P>
	Southern University designed a specific housing and community  
center plan for Mamou, La., where 42 percent of the 3,000 residents 
are 60 and older.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Rises, Japan Stocks Higher / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar surged against the yen Wednesday as  
investors were reassured by Brazil's pledge to take responsibility 
for its Eurobond debt payment. Japanese stocks closed mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 115.30 yen in late afternoon trading, up 0.60  
yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo and well above its late New York 
level of 114.39 yen overnight. It ranged from 113.73 yen to 115.50 
yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 49.74  
points, or 0.36 percent, to close at 13,952.40. On Tuesday, the 
average closed down 89.83 points, or 0.64 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar dipped early Wednesday on  
reports that the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais would not honor a 
Eurobond debt payment, due later Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But subsequent news that the Brazilian government had reiterated  
a pledge to cover the remainder of the state's Eurobond debt 
encouraged Japanese investors and trust banks to buy back dollars. 
Interbank players bought the currency to cover their short, or 
oversold, dollar positions. 
</P>
<P>
	Unconfirmed speculation that a large Japanese brokerage has  
incurred huge losses also helped to trigger a burst of dollar 
buying against the yen, pushing up the value of the greenback. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the euro was traded at 130.22 yen, up from 129.68 yen  
late Tuesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, prices were mixed as players  
awaited key economic and market events scheduled for later in the 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	The market remained weaker most of the day following a steep  
drop in U.S. stocks overnight. But gains in bond prices and the 
dollar's rebound helped buoy prices late in the afternoon session, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many investors refrained from active trading ahead of a Bank of  
Japan board meeting on Friday and testimony Thursday by U.S. 
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders were also seen adjusting positions ahead of Friday's  
settlement for February stock options contracts. Japan's financial 
markets will be closed Thursday for a national holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market lacked fresh incentives, and caution remained about  
the outlook for the New York market,'' said Yasuo Ueki, general 
manager at Nikko Securities Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the Nikkei's rise, the broader Tokyo Stock Price Index  
of all issues listed on the first section shed 0.56 points, or 0.05 
percent, to 1,083.09. The TOPIX closed down 6.98 points, or 0.64 
percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the first section was estimated at 412 million shares,  
up from 306.24 million shares on Tuesday. Retreating issues 
outnumbered advancers 576 to 529, with 183 issues closing 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 2.000 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.985 percent, 
driving its price down to 98.42 yen from 98.54 yen.

<HEADLINE> Little Progress at Kosovo Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RAMBOUILLET, France (AP) -- Ethnic Albanian rebels and rival  
Serbians demanded several important changes today to a 
U.S.-sponsored plan to bring peace to Kosovo, despite the American 
mediator's report of progress during talks. 
</P>
<P>
	The two delegations remained far from any agreement after three  
full days of talks at the 14th century French chateau where they 
are meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Serb-led Yugoslavia was demanding a formal pledge to keep the  
country's borders intact, and Albanian negotiators were calling for 
a referendum on independence, an immediate cease-fire and NATO 
guarantees for the eventual interim settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement today, the Kosovo Liberation Army said it would  
not give up its battle for independence for the province, where 
more than 2,000 people have died and hundreds of thousands have 
been left homeless in a year of fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	In the statement, distributed to the ethnic Albanian media in  
Kosovo, the KLA also demanded a formal cease-fire be signed with 
the Serb side and guaranteed by a third party. 
</P>
<P>
	The Serbian government considers the KLA terrorists and has  
refused to sign a cease-fire because that would amount to a de 
facto recognition of the group. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite claims of progress Tuesday by chief U.S. mediator  
Christopher Hill, sources close to the delegations said the two 
sides had not agreed on a single word of the peace plan. Progress, 
in the view of the mediators, appears to mean the delegations are 
actively studying the text of the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not easy, and frankly it's not a lot of fun ... but we  
are making progress,'' said Hill, who heads the team of three 
mediators shuttling between Serb and ethnic Albanian delegations. 
The two sides are staying on different floors and have not met 
face-to-face. 
</P>
<P>
	The KLA rebels, who have five officials on the 16-member ethnic  
Albanian delegation, also demanded the release of all political 
prisoners held in Kosovo or the free return to the province of 
those sentenced in absentia. 
</P>
<P>
	Another request was to allow an investigation of alleged war  
crimes in Kosovo by the U.N. tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
	``Above all we demand our legitimate right to recognize the  
independence of Kosovo through a clear and indisputable formulation 
with fixed dates and with a distinct mechanism which will secure 
Kosovo to become independent,'' the KLA said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Serbian side has also filed a series of complaints about the  
peace plan, which was handed to them when negotiations began 
Sunday, sources close to the delegation said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Serbians said the plan virtually separates Kosovo, their  
medieval heartland, from Serbia. They want the ethnic Albanian 
delegation to publicly sign their pledge that Kosovo will not 
become independent. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plan, Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority would be given  
virtual autonomy during an interim period of at least three years. 
But the province would remain part of Yugoslavia's republic of 
Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO generals are working on plans to dispatch 25,000 to 30,000  
troops to Kosovo, including up to 4,000 Americans, to enforce the 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia strongly opposes the NATO threat of force. A Western  
military source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Tuesday 
that discussion of a NATO deployment is being put off until the end 
of the talks to avoid a diplomatic dispute with the Russians. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic said that autonomy  
for Kosovo would be no problem. But he said ``under no condition'' 
would foreign peacekeeping troops be allowed in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Also today, a spokesman for international monitors said Serb  
authorities have agreed to release the bodies of 40 ethnic 
Albanians slain in January in Racak. The killings brought new 
threats of NATO airstrikes and intensified diplomacy, paving the 
way for the current peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
	The bodies have remained unburied because of a struggle between  
Serbs trying to avoid the spectacle of a mass funeral and ethnic 
Albanian politicians seeking to draw attention to what they say was 
a Serb atrocity.

<HEADLINE>  2 GOP Sens. Say They'll Acquit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two Republican senators declared Wednesday  
they would vote to acquit President Clinton of both articles of 
impeachment, the clearest sign yet as the trial neared an end that 
the charges would fall far short of conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Sens. James Jeffords of Vermont and Arlen Specter of  
Pennsylvania were the first Republicans to announce opposition to 
both articles, perjury and obstruction of justice in the Monica 
Lewinsky affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffords said enough Republicans may join them to hold the final  
roll calls on Thursday or Friday short of even a majority of 51 
votes. Only a constitutional two-thirds -- 67 votes in the 
100-member Senate -- could convict and oust Clinton, the second 
president in history to be put on trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., has disclosed that he will vote to  
convict Clinton for obstruction but to acquit for perjury. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Senate plodded through a second day of closed-door  
deliberations, Jeffords said Clinton ``gave misleading statements 
... did obstruct justice, but his actions in this case do not reach 
the high standard of impeachment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A short while later, Specter said the charges ``have not been  
proved'' at the historic month-long trial now drawing to a close. 
He said he wished Clinton, who refused to be questioned in writing 
or in person, had submitted to a ``firm examination'' by lawyers in 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
	With solid support among the Senate's 45 Democrats, the  
president has long been out of danger of conviction. Failure to 
deliver a simple majority for either article in the Senate, 
controlled by 55 Republicans, would be a stinging repudiation of 
the case that the GOP House voted to take to trial and its 13 
prosecutor-congressmen argued to the senators. 
</P>
<P>
	Gorton said Tuesday night he will to vote for Clinton's  
conviction on the charge of obstruction of justice but not on 
perjury. ``I cannot will to my children and grandchildren the 
proposition that a president stands above the law and can 
systematically obstruct justice because both his polls and the Dow 
Jones index are high.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Clinton's acquittal assured, Democrats continued their  
campaign for a formal vote to censure the president after the 
trial. But Republican opposition seemed to be stiffening, and 
Specter said censure would violate the constitutional doctrine of 
separation of powers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's been very little mention of censure'' in the  
closed-door deliberations, said Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn. ``To me, 
the push for censure is losing steam.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic leader Tom Daschle is hoping for at least a  
procedural vote before lawmakers adjourn for a week-long vacation, 
a roll call that would allow Democrats to go on record condemning 
the president's behavior while acquitting him at his trial. 
</P>
<P>
	With Chief Justice William Rehnquist presiding, the Senate spent  
a second day behind closed doors, senators taking turns delivering 
their final statements. Majority Leader Trent Lott told reporters 
at a midday break that 26 to 28 lawmakers had spoken at that point 
in the closed-door deliberations. He said he hoped a final vote was 
still possible by late Thursday, although he indicated it could 
slip to Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffords and Specter are among the most moderate Republicans in  
the Senate, and had long been viewed as possible votes for 
acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The facts and circumstances of this case are low and tawdry,  
but these same circumstances do not, in my opinion, cause his 
offenses to rise to the level of impeachable acts,'' Jeffords said 
in his statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Specter said that under Scottish law, three verdicts are  
possible: guilty, not guilty or not proved. He opted for the third. 
</P>
<P>
	Specter was critical of the trial itself, saying only ``partial  
justice'' had been served since House prosecutors were hampered by 
the Senate's unwillingness to call witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the full weight of the evidence with live witnesses had  
been presented to the Senate instead of bits and pieces of cold 
transcript, it is possible the Senate and the American people would 
have demanded the president's appearance in the well of the 
Senate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Under firm examination the president might have displayed the  
egregious character described harshly by his defenders in their 
proposed censure petitions. That sequence might have led to his 
removal. But on this record the proofs are not present.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with CNN, Jeffords said six to seven Republicans  
might well vote to acquit, and possibly as many as 12. He offered 
no elaboration. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators in both parties, and of differing opinions on the case,  
were well aware of the precedent-setting nature of the moment. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffords said he was concerned that conviction of this president  
``may establish a low threshold that would make every president 
subject to removal for the slightest indiscretion or that a vote to 
convict may imperil every president who faces a Congress controlled 
by an opposing party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gorton, a former attorney general in Washington state, said that  
by acquitting Clinton, ``the republic and its institutions will be 
weakened. One exception or excuse will lead to another, the right 
of the most powerful of our leaders to act outside the law -- or in 
violation of the law -- will be established.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As expected, Democrat Tom Harkin of Iowa announced plans to vote  
for acquittal. He did so in a statement that also attacked 
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we have here is an out-of-control independent counsel  
with a blank check'' who turned over information to ``overzealous'' 
House prosecutors, Harkin said. 
</P>
<P>
	He predicted only one-third of the Senate would vote for the  
perjury article.

prosecutor-congressmen argued to the senators. 
</P>
<P>
	Gorton said Tuesday night he will to vote for Clinton's  
conviction on the charge of obstruction of justice but not on 
perjury. ``I cannot will to my children and grandchildren the 
proposition that a president stands above the law and can 
systematically obstruct justice because both his polls and the Dow 
Jones index are high.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Clinton's acquittal assured, Democrats continued their  
campaign for a formal vote to censure the president after the 
trial. But Republican opposition seemed to be stiffening, and 
Specter said censure would violate the constitutional doctrine of 
separation of powers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's been very little mention of censure'' in the  
closed-door deliberations, said Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn. ``To me, 
the push for censure is losing steam.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic leader Tom Daschle is hoping for at least a  
procedural vote before lawmakers adjourn for a week-long vacation, 
a roll call that would allow Democrats to go on record condemning 
the president's behavior while acquitting him at his trial. 
</P>
<P>
	With Chief Justice William Rehnquist presiding, the Senate spent  
a second day behind closed doors, senators taking turns delivering 
their final statements. Majority Leader Trent Lott told reporters 
at a midday break that 26 to 28 lawmakers had spoken at that point 
in the closed-door deliberations. He said he hoped a final vote was 
still possible by late Thursday, although he indicated it could 
slip to Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffords and Specter are among the most moderate Republicans in  
the Senate, and had long been viewed as possible votes for 
acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The facts and circumstances of this case are low and tawdry,  
but these same circumstances do not, in my opinion, cause his 
offenses to rise to the level of impeachable acts,'' Jeffords said 
in his statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Specter said that under Scottish law, three verdicts are  
possible: guilty, not guilty or not proved. He opted for the third. 
</P>
<P>
	Specter was critical of the trial itself, saying only ``partial  
justice'' had been served since House prosecutors were hampered by 
the Senate's unwillingness to call witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the full weight of the evidence with live witnesses had  
been presented to the Senate instead of bits and pieces of cold 
transcript, it is possible the Senate and the American people would 
have demanded the president's appearance in the well of the 
Senate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Under firm examination the president might have displayed the  
egregious character described harshly by his defenders in their 
proposed censure petitions. That sequence might have led to his 
removal. But on this record the proofs are not present.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with CNN, Jeffords said six to seven Republicans  
might well vote to acquit, and possibly as many as 12. He offered 
no elaboration. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators in both parties, and of differing opinions on the case,  
were well aware of the precedent-setting nature of the moment. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffords said he was concerned that conviction of this president  
``may establish a low threshold that would make every president 
subject to removal for the slightest indiscretion or that a vote to 
convict may imperil every president who faces a Congress controlled 
by an opposing party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gorton, a former attorney general in Washington state, said that  
by acquitting Clinton, ``the republic and its institutions will be 
weakened. One exception or excuse will lead to another, the right 
of the most powerful of our leaders to act outside the law -- or in 
violation of the law -- will be established.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As expected, Democrat Tom Harkin of Iowa announced plans to vote  
for acquittal. He did so in a statement that also attacked 
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we have here is an out-of-control independent counsel  
with a blank check'' who turned over information to ``overzealous'' 
House prosecutors, Harkin said. 
</P>
<P>
	He predicted only one-third of the Senate would vote for the  
perjury article.

<HEADLINE> Mercury Tracer Production To End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Ford Motor Co.'s Lincoln-Mercury division will  
end production of the Mercury Tracer subcompact car July 2. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Ford also announced list prices for the 2000  
Lincoln LS, the new entry-level luxury sedan for the No. 2 
automaker's U.S. luxury nameplate. The car will start at $31,450 
with a base V6 and range to $35,225 with a V8. Prices include 
destination charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tracer is a twin to the better-selling Ford Escort. The  
decision to end production of the slow-selling Tracer reflects 
Lincoln-Mercury's desire to differentiate its model lineup from 
that of the Ford division. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford plans to replace the Escort later this year with the new  
Focus, which already is on sale in Europe. Mercury likely will not 
have a subcompact in its lineup after the Tracer's demise. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tracer is produced at plants in Wayne, Mich., outside  
Detroit, and Hermosillo, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement was made during the Chicago Auto Show media  
preview.

<TEXT>
<P>
	Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers in the  
United States and abroad: 

</P>
<P>
	Feb. 6  
</P>
<P>
	The Tallahassee (Fla.) Democrat, on race study:  
</P>
<P>
	At the beginning of the century, historian W.E.B. DuBois  
described color as the major problem of the new century. Now ... 
his comment is almost an understatement. 
</P>
<P>
	That's why President Clinton's proposed $10 million effort to  
quantify racism in America through a research program is such a 
good idea. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Racism's become a subjective term. ... Just as some blacks cry  
racism whenever life fails to go their way, some whites are just as 
quick to pooh-pooh what ... seem like textbook examples of unequal 
treatment to blacks. ... 
</P>
<P>
	It's a shame that we haven't reached a point where we could  
spend this money on concrete solutions. ... But if this research 
succeeds in accomplishing its highest goals, that $10 million will 
be more than well-spent. 

</P>
<P>

<P>
	Albuquerque (N.M.) Journal, on national forest grazing report:  
</P>
<P>
	So, the Forest Service released a report with the conclusion  
that grazing on national forests is not posing an immediate threat 
to rare species of wildlife in nearly all grazing areas studied. 
And, environmental activists promptly denounced the findings as 
politically motivated. No surprises there. 
</P>
<P>
	Two things come to mind in assessing this perpetual  
disagreement, however. One is that the environmentalists have not 
been without success in forcing change in Forest Service grazing 
practices. Fencing cows away from fragile riparian areas was 
mandated as a result of earlier interchanges. 
</P>
<P>
	Another is that if the grazing practices of the ranching  
community and the management practices of the Forest Service and 
its predecessors have been so abysmally bad for the last 100 years, 
how can it be that there are any endangered species left in the 
path of the cows? 
</P>
<P>
	The Forest Service, at least, demonstrates the ability to  
respond to new information and new ideas on how the natural 
resource should be managed. ... It remains caught between the 
militant environmentalist groups and the stockmen, secure in the 
knowledge that anything it does will incur the wrath of one or the 
other -- or both. ... 

</P>
<P>
	Feb. 3  
</P>
<P>
	The Oregonian, Portland, on First Amendment and anti-abortion  
Web site: 
</P>
<P>
	An effort by doctors and clinics to protect themselves, their  
workers and their patients from the violence of anti-abortion 
extremists has prevailed in federal court in Portland, Ore. But in 
doing so it succeeded in turning the law into a blunt object to 
batter the First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	The members of the now-defunct American Coalition of Life  
Activists made it their mission to drive abortion from the land by 
using everything they could, staying just inches within the law. 
They may indeed have crossed the line. 
</P>
<P>
	But this case should be appealed.  
</P>
<P>
	The standard the jury used to reach its decision was set far too  
low. 
</P>
<P>
	A verdict that hangs on what a reasonable person should have  
foreseen as threatening by its context, as this decision does, is a 
step too far from the actual potential to do harm. ... 

</P>
<P>
	Feb. 3  
</P>
<P>
	Akron (Ohio) Beacon Journal, on President Clinton's proposed  
budget: 
</P>
<P>
	Many Republicans in Congress leaped to attack the $1.77 trillion  
budget proposal unveiled by President Clinton this week. They 
accused the president of engaging in liberal excess. 
</P>
<P>
	For the record, Clinton hasn't proposed a reckless budget.  
</P>
<P>
	Federal spending would grow at a relatively tiny rate of 2.2  
percent in the fiscal year that starts Oct. 1. In other words, 
spending would keep up with inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton would operate within the spending limits established in  
the balanced-budget agreement two years ago. He would pay for his 
new initiatives largely by closing tax loopholes and placing a new 
55-cent tax on a pack of cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans may note that both proposals are unlikely to pass  
Congress. That doesn't mean the president has used smoke and 
mirrors. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Clinton budget has one obvious flaw, it relies on flimsy  
forecasts for the long term. In the short term, it is sound, even 
conservative, in its projections. 

</P>
<P>
	Feb. 8  
</P>
<P>
	Austin (Texas) American-Statesman, on ending executions:  
</P>
<P>
	Texas leads the nation in the number of executions yet can't  
seem to execute inmates quickly enough to free space for new 
prisoners. There are fundamental flaws with our state criminal 
justice system. 
</P>
<P>
	A proposal to expand death row because of crowding highlights  
the state's unjust use of the death penalty and the urgent need to 
replace it with life without parole. The death penalty is fraught 
with problems -- from the casual and secretive clemency review 
process to the often incompetent legal representation offered death 
row inmates. No one is arguing that convicted murders should not 
face punishment. But the state's reckless use of the death penalty 
fails to acknowledge the judges, juries and prosecutors make 
errors. ... 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas Legislature should end this brutal and unfair  
practice. The fact that death row is overcrowded proves that the 
death penalty isn't the crime deterrent supporters claim it is. 

</P>
<P>
	Feb. 3  
</P>
<P>
	Charleston (W.Va.) Daily Mail, on Medicare and Social Security:  
</P>
<P>
	One out of every five children in America is being raised in  
poverty. That's federal policy. For more than three decades now, 
the government has chosen to give special aid to people at the 
other end of the age spectrum. 
</P>
<P>
	Medicare was created to pay the medical bills of all people 65  
or over, regardless of their income or assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Medicare and Social Security are the main reason that, according  
to the Los Angeles Times, 42 percent of the federal budget now goes 
to help those 65 and older. 
</P>
<P>
	They make up 13 percent of the population.  
</P>
<P>
	All that government spending has worked. The poverty rate for  
those 65 and older is now about half of that for Americans under 
the age of 18. 
</P>
<P>
	But entitlements for the elderly have damaged the federal budget  
and the working class, who are socked with a payroll tax of 15.3 
percent -- counting the employer's match. 
</P>
<P>
	Now for the bad news. In the next 30 years, baby boomers will  
retire and life expectancies will increase. Those 65 and older will 
make up 20 percent of the population. 
</P>
<P>
	Will they devour 60 percent of the federal budget in the  
process? ... 
</P>
<P>
	Failing to address this problem now, when times are good, dooms  
another set of children to poverty to support an aging population. 
This intergenerational shift of money is unfair.

	Long Beach (Calif.) Press-Telegram, on cost of a free computer:  
</P>
<P>
	In what privacy advocates are calling ``a Faustian bargain,'' a  
Pasadena company is giving away 10,000 personal computers, complete 
with free Internet access, to people who don't mind letting the 
company know who they are, how old they area, how much they earn 
and what kind of products they buy. 
</P>
<P>
	Faustian deal, schmaustian deal, this is simply a good deal.  
Chances are good that if you have a supermarket card, your grocer 
already knows enough about you and your family to be able to target 
the right toilet paper discount coupons to your household. Anyone 
with basic knowledge of the Internet can find your name, address, 
phone number, e-mail address and even your criminal record, if you 
have one. ... Visit a Web site and order a shirt, and you're in 
that merchant's database. ... 
</P>
<P>
	That's what Free-PC.com is doing, only on a grander scale.  
</P>
<P>
	Once you've filled out a five-minute online questionnaire,  
you'll become part of a database, and if you fit the profile of ... 
a big spender, you'll not only get a free PC, you'll have a 
permanent strip on your monitor that displays ads geared to your 
buying habits and interests. And even if you don't buy anthing, the 
computer will be programmed to ... report on where you've been on 
the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Sound scary? Only if you have any illusions about your privacy.  
We don't. We happen to think that Internet privacy is a noble but 
losing battle. If you can get a free PC in the process, we say ... 
you have less to lose than you think.

<P>
	The Post and Courier, Charleston, S.C., on a Latin view of  
President Clinton and Monica Lewinsky: 
</P>
<P>
	Gabriel Garcia Marquez, the Nobel laureate who brought the  
``magical reality'' of Latin American literature to a worldwide 
audience, can be relied upon for a Latin slant, a very Latin slant, 
on any subject. Particularly, the scandal that has enveloped 
William Jefferson Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Writing in the Colombian magazine Cambio, Garcia Marquez asked:  
``Is it fair that this rare example of the human species must 
squander his historic destiny just because he couldn't find a safe 
place to make love?'' 
</P>
<P>
	To which, the very un-Latin reply is: ``It's not about love,  
stupid. It's about lying.'' 

</P>
<P>
	Feb. 9  
</P>
<P>
	Financial Times, London, on state election in Germany:  
</P>
<P>
	Barely 100 days after he took power at the head of the  
center-left coalition government, Gerhard Schroder, the German 
chancellor, has been given a nasty black eye by the voters. The 
same political alliance of Social Democrats (SPD) and Greens was 
voted out of office in the state of Hesse on Sunday, not least 
because of the perceived muddle at the heart of government back in 
Bonn. ... 
</P>
<P>
	... The Hesse result should provide a salutary warning to Mr.  
Schroder. He has failed to deliver a clear platform of coherent 
policies, not least to deal with unemployment, which is his top 
priority. The government's tax reforms are ill thought-out, and 
could well be counter-productive in discouraging enterprise. ... 
</P>
<P>
	... By failing to give a clear lead in his first 100 days, Mr.  
Schroder has been condemned to compromise. 

</P>
<P>
	Feb. 9  
</P>
<P>
	Sueddeutsche Zeitung, Munich, on Kosovo negotiations in France:  
</P>
<P>
	The international community is counting on a proven concept at  
the Kosovo negotiations in Rambouillet. The stick and carrot. The 
interned representatives of the Serbs and Albanians must be 
floating proudly over the red carpet of the castle in view of the 
praise from the foreign negotiating leaders. `Intelligent,' they 
were called, `constructive,' even though till now they haven't 
delivered much proof of that. At the same time U.S. Secretary of 
State Madeleine Albright reminds all of those overcome by 
over-enthusiasm who want to forget, that a military threat 
continues to hang over their heads. 
</P>
<P>
	This pressure is necessary, because praise will not move the two  
sides to an agreement. ... 

</P>

</P>
<P>
	The Times, London, on King Hussein's funeral:  
</P>
<P>
	The sounds of weeping, bagpipes and chants from countless  
minarets were extraordinary. The image of the coffin, a solitary 
Arab stallion, and the seemingly endless funeral cortege, will stay 
in the memory of millions. Despite the scenes of grief and the 
pressing crush from high and low, King Hussein of Jordan was buried 
yesterday with an appropriate dignity. ... 
</P>
<P>
	... That a diplomatic gathering of this size and rank should  
settle in such a small city as Amman is a tribute to King Hussein's 
standing. He moved in a unique set of political circles -- the 
remaining monarchies, Western industrialized powers, the Arab 
nation, the Third World -- and all were represented at his last 
journey. ... He is a reminder that, for all the prominence of 
superpowers and economic blocs, the charismatic individual has not 
been rendered redundant in international relations. 

</P>
<P>
	Feb. 9  
</P>
<P>
	Neue Zuercher Zeitung, Zurich, Switzerland, on King Hussein:  
</P>
<P>
	The world's great and powerful converged on Amman Monday to pay  
their last respects to the dead Hashemite king. 
</P>
<P>
	If the significance of the deceased can be measured by the  
length and weight of the list of guests at his funeral, King 
Hussein would have to be placed among the most important heads of 
state of this century. ... 

</P>
<P>
	Feb. 9  
</P>
<P>
	La Stampa, Turin, Italy, on King Hussein:  
</P>
<P>
	A little more than three years later, Jordan shared Israel's  
fate of prematurely losing its great leader of peace. There are 
obvious parallels between the two events. 
</P>
<P>
	The most obvious is the grief of the people. Then there is the  
global character of the two funerals. Yitzhak Rabin and King 
Hussein belonged to everyone, their choice for peace was 
everyone's, and at both funerals, world leaders came to testify 
this. ... 

</P>
<P>
	Feb. 9  
</P>
<P>
	Le Monde, Paris, on King Hussein:  
</P>
<P>
	In an ever-aging group of Arab leaders, King Hussein was the  
model of levelheadedness. He fought the Palestinians, but then knew 
how to make peace with Yasser Arafat. He fought the Israelis ... 
but then formed a partnership with his neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
	His achievements were by no means small, and that fact was  
reflected in the number of important leaders who turned up at his 
funeral. As well as respect for the dead king, this surely is a 
display of their anguish. 

</P>
<P>
	Feb. 8  
</P>
<P>
	Mainichi Shimbun, Tokyo, on King Hussein:  
</P>
<P>
	According to an Arabic saying, `those of proper birth keep their  
promises; those of lowly birth do not.'' Jordan's King Hussein took 
maximum advantage of his distinguished lineage, which inspired 
reverence among his subjects. Though he presided over a small 
country with no oil, King Hussein was able to translate his status 
as head of the Hashemite monarchy and direct descendant of the 
great-grandfather of the prophet Muhammad, the founder of Islam, 
into influence in the Arab and Islamic world. 
</P>
<P>
	It is almost a miracle that he ruled for 46 years after  
ascending to the throne at the age of 17 in a volatile region of 
the world. King Hussein survived by wearing many hats, at times 
serving as mediator, at times messenger, while surrounded by 
neighbors who were at loggerheads. 
</P>
<P>
	King Hussein's successor -- his eldest son, Crown Prince Abdullah  
-- has told a London-based Arabic newspaper that he would continue 
Jordan's traditional policies toward the Middle East peace process 
and Iraq. However, it is unfair to expect that the 37-year-old 
former soldier, whose political acumen is untested, will be as 
skillful as a diplomat as his father from the outset. ... As the 
stability of Jordan will directly affect peace in the Middle East 
and the Persian Gulf, shouldn't Japan actively extend support to 
the young leader? 

</P>
<P>
	Feb. 9  
</P>
<P>
	The Straits Times, Singapore, on King Hussein:  
</P>
<P>
	King Hussein's skills of maneuver not only preserved the  
country's independence, but also helped it to play bridge or 
buffer, as circumstances required, between countries sworn to 
enmity. It is true that much of this freedom of maneuver locally 
came from his strong links to the West: After all, the Hashemite 
monarchy had been brought to power by the British. But that is not 
the whole story. The larger picture shows how it adjusted 
successfully to the interplay of regional forces, from pan-Arabism 
to militant Islam. Had it not stood its ground firmly, any of these 
forces would have been quite sufficient to overwhelm it. It is this 
political versatility that underwrote King Hussein's quest for 
peace, which crossed a milestone in his accord with Israel. The new 
king must continue that legacy in the face of the hatred, violence 
and terror ranged against it. 

</P>
<P>
	Feb. 8  
</P>
<P>
	El Correo, Bilbao, Spain, on IOC doping conference:  
</P>
<P>
	The unsatisfactory outcome of the World Anti-doping Conference  
shores up the negative predictions which preceded its staging. To 
reunite 600 representatives from Olympic organizations, 
governments, sports and scientific associations and sportsman so as 
to set up an Anti-doping Agency and then conclude that they must 
meet again is a sad outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	... Fans and spectators have the right to demand a guarantee  
against fraud, against foul play which can only come from an 
Anti-doping Agency which is truly independent and backed by an 
international body. 

</P>
<P>
	Feb. 10  
</P>
<P>
	The Sydney Morning Herald, Australia, on Zimbabwe's crackdown on  
the press: 
</P>
<P>
	A country with which Australia has had a long and concerned  
relationship tortures two journalists for reveling an intended 
coup. The journalists' editor is arrested and charged with 
publishing false news likely to spread ``alarm and despondency.'' 
The charge carries a sentence of up to seven years' imprisonment. 
The government defies an order from the Supreme Court to release 
the editor and accept ``the rule of law.'' The Supreme Court is 
accused by the president of ``an outrageous and deliberate act of 
impudence.'' If this country had been South Africa, say, in the 
days of apartheid, the Australian government would have protested 
vehemently and recommended an intensification of the sanctions 
already imposed on that country. Why, then, is the Australian 
government seemingly so silent about President Robert Mugabe's 
determination to overturn the constitution of Zimbabwe? ...

<HEADLINE> Earnhardt Jokes About Big Question </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Dale Earnhardt hasn't had to answer  
that awful question once this year: ``When are you going to win the 
Daytona 500?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before his stirring victory a year ago at Daytona International  
Speedway, the seven-time Winston Cup champion had to field that 
query almost every day. 
</P>
<P>
	He tried to joke about it, but it was no use. The question  
became a burden. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's funny,'' he said as the Richard Childress Racing team  
worked nearby on his trademark black No. 3 Chevrolet Monte Carlo. 
``It feels great to come down and not be asked if you think you can 
win it this year and talk about all the things that have gone wrong 
the last several years. 
</P>
<P>
	``All that's behind us. But now they want to know how it feels  
not to have that question asked,'' Earnhardt said, laughing. ``Now 
they can go along and bug Terry Labonte and Rusty Wallace and some 
of these other guys who haven't won it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's definitely special to win the Daytona 500. Now when  
Darrell (Waltrip) and me are sitting in a rocking chair on the 
front porch when we're both about 70, he can't say, 'I won it and 
you didn't.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Before he won the Daytona 500, Earnhardt already was among the  
best in the history of his sport, with 71 career victories. Now, 
besides a record eighth championship, what else does the 
47-year-old driver have to accomplish? 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to win the Daytona 500 again, and I want to win a whole  
bunch more races,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Considering he has won just once in his last 92 races, that  
seems a stretch. But he insists his team can still win. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll go out and work hard to prove that again,'' he said.  
``It seems like it's just been a couple of years that we've had 
some turn of events that hasn't allowed us to be in the top five 
every race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Childress says the team has kept its key personnel, added two  
engineers and reorganized its shop during the winter in an effort 
to strengthen its hand. The team owner also pointed to the strong 
combination of Earnhardt and crew chief Kevin Hamlin. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry McReynolds began the 1998 season as Earnhardt's crew  
chief, but their relationship deteriorated after the Daytona 
victory. At midseason, Childress switched crew chiefs, putting 
McReynolds with Mike Skinner and Hamlin with Earnhardt. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both of those combinations seem to be working just fine,''  
Childress said. 
</P>
<P>
	Now it's time to make it work on the track.  
</P>
<P>
	``I know Dale Earnhardt probably as good as anybody,'' Childress  
said. ``We talked at the end of the year about getting everybody in 
shape and he's ready to go. I see that desire when I'm talking to 
him. He's still got the desire to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The next order of business is qualifying for Sunday's race.  
Earnhardt will start fifth in the second of two 125-mile qualifying 
races Thursday on the 2 1/2-mile Daytona oval. He has won 11 of these 
qualifiers, including his last nine. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, he will have to beat, among others, teammate Skinner,  
Rusty Wallace, former Daytona 500 winners Ernie Irvan and Dale 
Jarrett, and Jeremy Mayfield. 
</P>
<P>
	Surprising rookie Tony Stewart, who will start from the pole in  
the race, has already locked in a front-row starting spot for 
Sunday with his qualifying speed. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Gordon, two-time defending Winston Cup champion and the  
1997 Daytona winner, will start from the pole in the first 
qualifying race and on Sunday after leading first-day time trials 
with a lap of 195.067 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	In the unique Daytona qualifying format, positions 3-30 will be  
determined by Thursday's races, positions 31-36 will revert to the 
remaining fastest drivers from time trials and the rest of the 
43-car field will be provisionals.

<HEADLINE> Pinter, Silver Have New Plays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A study in contrasts. Harold Pinter, a British  
playwright of few words. Nicky Silver, an American playwright of, 
well, quite a lot. 
</P>
<P>
	Each has a new work off-Broadway, and both of the productions  
are worth seeing, particularly for the way their lead actresses 
tackle very choice roles. 
</P>
<P>
	First, the Pinter. His ``Ashes to Ashes'' is spare, a bit chilly  
and only 45 minutes long, a length that will have audiences out of 
the Roundabout Theater Company's production at the Gramercy Theater 
in time for an unhurried supper. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if they are puzzled by the plot -- and this being Pinter,  
they will be -- you can bet theatergoers will talk about Lindsay 
Duncan's fascinating performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Duncan, a calm, cool blonde in the tradition of Glenn Close,  
plays Rebecca, a woman haunted by the past. The actress radiates a 
security on stage, a confidence that comes from a flawless 
technique and an emotional directness. 
</P>
<P>
	The character talks of a lover, who apparently physically abused  
her. These facts come out slowly, pried from the woman by an 
interrogator named Devlin, played by quietly solicitous David 
Strathairn. 
</P>
<P>
	Gradually, her thoughts turn to memories of babies being pulled  
from the arms of screaming mothers at railway stations. Images of 
the Holocaust, perhaps? Yet the woman is much too young -- the play 
is set in the present -- to have lived through World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Could this be a woman descending into deep psychological torment  
that takes her beyond her own despair? Maybe. Whatever the answers, 
Duncan makes Rebecca's suffering seem very real indeed. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there is ``The Eros Trilogy'' from Nicky Silver, a man  
whose characters often speak in such long monologues that actors 
like to use them as audition pieces. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Vineyard Theater, Silver, author of such quirky comic  
works as ``Pterodactyls'' and ``Raised in Captivity,'' offers two 
such monologues. They constitute the evening's verbose first act. 
The leadoff entry features Betty Buckley, in a rare departure from 
musical theater. 
</P>
<P>
	Buckley can command a stage, something she does here with all  
the intensity of Norma Desmond snaring Joe Gillis in ``Sunset 
Boulevard.'' After all, she is playing one of Silver's favorite 
character types, an all-consuming mother. 
</P>
<P>
	Claire is a wealthy Park Avenue matron, lounging in her boudoir.  
She is bemoaning the lowering of standards all across her fair 
city, particularly the increased frequency with which people spit 
on the sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
	Buckley, coy, coquettish and totally charming, talks directly to  
the audience. Her tale gradually darkens, revealing an unhappy 
childhood and battles with her children. Her only solace: a younger 
lover, who helps her blot out the ugliness of the past. 
</P>
<P>
	The first act's second monologue features Claire's troubled son  
Philip, a quivering, high-strung gay man played by Zak Orth. Philip 
shouts a lot, and Orth displays considerable lung power in bringing 
this unhappy lad to life. It makes for an unpleasant 25 minutes, 
done at high volume. 
</P>
<P>
	Things pick up after intermission with a variation on A.R.  
Gurney's ``Love Letters.'' Here the correspondents are a gay son 
and another domineering mother. Their letter-writing lasts over 
several decades, from summer theater camp -- ``Dear Mother ... I 
have a good part in the show `Follies''' -- to Mom's golden years 
and her son finally settling down in a solid relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	As the son, T. Scott Cunningham holds his own against the  
formidable Buckley. He is sharp and funny, particularly in a 
diatribe against Mom that is Silver at his neurotic best. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Orange Juice Down on Big Fla. Crop  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Orange-juice futures fell nearly 9 percent Wednesday on the  
Board of Trade of the City of New York after the government said 
production this year will be far greater than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, palladium futures rose sharply for a second  
day. 
</P>
<P>
	Frozen, concentrated orange juice prices fell after the U.S.  
Agriculture Department's monthly update on supply and demand said 
the Florida crop will be 2 percent, or 4 million boxes, larger than 
an earlier estimate of 194 million boxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Liekwise, the estimated amount of juice per box was increased to  
a record 1.60 gallons, figures that point to consumers being awash 
in cheap orange juice in coming months. Florida accounts for about 
90 percent of all U.S. orange juice production. 
</P>
<P>
	The department's latest figures surprised market participants,  
who had expected the report to show a downward revision. 
</P>
<P>
	Rainstorms at this time last year, followed by hot and dry  
conditions had been expected to seriously reduce supplies. But 
beneficial weather conditions last month apparently revived many of 
the trees thought to be damaged, the government said. 
</P>
<P>
	Orange juice for March delivery fell 7.95 cents, or 8.5 percent,  
to 92.25 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Palladium futures rose on the New York Mercantile Exchange amid  
word of more financial troubles at Russia's giant Norilsk Nickel 
mine, which accounts for most of the palladium and platinum that is 
exported to world markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Norilsk Nickel announced it planned to cut nickel output this  
year, while Russia's Unexim Bank -- which owns 55 percent of the 
mine -- told creditors it would miss $13.99 million in interest 
payments. 
</P>
<P>
	The mine said it does not anticipate problems in obtaining new  
equipment for upgrades needed to keep it operating at capacity, but 
market participants were nervous the two announcements could signal 
even further delays in getting palladium to Western manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has not shipped new supplies of the metal since December,  
and dwindling inventories have prompted market jitters. Palladium 
is used in catalysts to provide cleaner-burning cars and in such 
electronics as cellular phones. 
</P>
<P>
	March palladium rose $5.40 to $356.90 an ounce, while April  
platinum rose $1.50 to $361 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans tumbled early on the Chicago Board of Trade after the  
U.S. Agriculture Department estimated the amount of soybeans left 
over before the next harvest will rise to 410 million bushels, a 
13-year high and up from the 390 million bushels predicted last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	Even more disturbing to market participants was the government's  
forecast that Argentina's corn, wheat and soybean crops will be 
large and that Brazil, the world's second-largest soybean grower 
behind the United States, is on track to harvest a crop close to 
last year's record 31 million-ton crop. 
</P>
<P>
	That likely would lead to pricing wars this spring as producers  
compete for scant export business, causing U.S. inventories to grow 
even further. 
</P>
<P>
	March soybeans recovered and rose 1/4 cent to $4.99 1/4 a bushel, but  
other contract months retreated.

<HEADLINE> Filmmakers May Buy Oakland A's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Two Hollywood moguls responsible for the  
movies ``Batman,'' ``Basic Instinct'' and ``I Know What You Did 
Last Summer'' have expressed an interest in buying the Oakland 
Athletics, two newspapers reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Guber, founder and chairman of Mandalay Entertainment and  
former head of Sony Pictures Entertainment, and his vice chairman, 
Paul Schaeffer, have submitted an application to go through major 
league baseball's preapproval process -- required before prospective 
buyers can examine financial documents. 
</P>
<P>
	``This opportunity came along and we found it to be  
interesting,'' Schaeffer told The Oakland Tribune. ``It's close to 
home, the team is young and it has some terrific young stars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Guber and Schaeffer's company, Mandalay Sports Entertainment,  
already owns the Triple-A Las Vegas Stars, the Class A Lake 
Elsinore Storm and the Las Vegas Thunder minor league hockey team. 
The company also is building a baseball stadium in Dayton, Ohio, 
for a Class A team from Rockford, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	Schaeffer said he and Guber were approached by Game Plan LLC,  
the Boston investment banking firm hired by Oakland and Alameda 
County to find new owners. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're serious, but we don't have any information yet,''  
Schaeffer told the San Francisco Chronicle on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials have until April 21 to find a buyer willing to meet  
the $122 million asking price. If there's no sale, owners Steve 
Schott and Ken Hoffmann will keep the team and can't sell it for a 
lower price for at least one year. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one other group, which includes Hall of Famer Joe  
Morgan and George Zimmer of the Men's Wearhouse clothing chain, has 
expressed interest.

<HEADLINE> January Sets Tornado Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Springlike weather patterns produced a record  
163 tornadoes over the United States in January, the most ever for 
the first month of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The total is more than three times the previous record for  
January -- 52 -- set in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	The January tornadoes were caused by an unusual weather pattern  
for the month, said Harold Brooks, meteorologist with the National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Severe Storms 
Laboratory in Norman, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the storms were caused by a southerly flow of wind from  
the Gulf of Mexico, which brought in moisture at low levels, and 
then combined with a strong upper air pressure, which causes wind 
at about 30,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	``We usually don't see this tornado-producing combination until  
March or April,'' Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
	A one-day January record of 87 twisters was set Jan. 21,  
according to the National Weather Service. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frankly, we consider this to be a significant number of  
tornadoes for a March day -- the height of tornado season. These 
numbers in January are unprecedented,'' said Joe Schaefer, director 
of the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center in 
Norman. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, 141 tornadoes struck Arkansas, Louisiana and Tennessee  
in that spate, the agency said. Additional twisters ripped through 
six other states in January 
</P>
<P>
	The first tornadoes of 1999 occurred on the first day of the  
year in Texas and Louisiana. The next day, more tornadoes hit 
Florida, Georgia, Mississippi and North Carolina, with a total of 
18 in just two days. Six days later two more struck Louisiana and 
Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
	On Jan. 17, deadly tornadoes touched down in three states,  
Arkansas, Missouri and Tennessee, killing 10 people and injuring 
100. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, 104 tornadoes were spotted during a three-day period, most  
of them on Jan. 21 in Arkansas, Louisiana and Tennessee. During the 
next two days, 17 additional twisters struck Mississippi, Alabama 
and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	The first tornado death this year occurred on Jan. 2 and the  
total number of deaths caused by tornadoes rose to 18 by the end of 
the month.

<HEADLINE>  Iverson Slumps but 76ers Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Allen Iverson's eyes still light up when he  
gets the ball in his hands. His expression changes once he releases 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	The ball goes up and Iverson winces like a player in a major  
shooting slump. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the Philadelphia 76ers' star point guard is having fun  
lately. But it has nothing to do with 40- or 50-point games. The 
surprising 76ers are unbeaten even though Iverson is missing 73 
percent of his shots. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who knows what will happen when I play a good game,'' Iverson  
said. ``Whenever that may be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 76ers, 3-0 for the first time since 1984, are winning with  
defense and balanced scoring. Even Iverson can't believe it. Since 
Philadelphia made him the No. 1 pick in the draft in 1996, Iverson 
has been a raw, relentless scorer. 
</P>
<P>
	He had little help in his first two seasons, and the 76ers kept  
losing. 
</P>
<P>
	While making a push for the rookie of the year award in 1996, he  
made plenty of enemies when he broke Wilt Chamberlain's record with 
four straight 40-point games. He scored 50 in Cleveland in the 
record-breaking game, leaving a hostile crowd with no choice but to 
give him a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, the 76ers were well out of the playoff hunt by then,  
lending credence to Iverson's reputation as a supposedly selfish 
player who cared only about his stats. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, he's too busy winning games to worry about numbers -- even  
if his numbers are atrocious. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I came out and was scoring all those 40- and 50-point  
games, we were losing every time because nobody else was getting 
involved. ... I can't come out and score 35, 36 points every night 
and then come up with L's. I mean, we need other guys to play 
basketball,'' Iverson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Apparently, the 76ers listen to their 23-year-old leader.  
</P>
<P>
	A swarming defense is anchored by twin towers Theo Ratliff and  
Matt Geiger, who combined for eight of the team's season-high 13 
blocks in a 90-86 victory over the Detroit Pistons on Tuesday 
night. Harvey Grant, one of the top defensive forwards in the 
league, kept Grant Hill under control and had four blocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill, coming off a career-high 46 points against Washington,  
scored 32 points against the 76ers on 11-for-18 shooting. Iverson 
had 19 points, but was 6-for-20 from the field. He's averaging only 
16.7 points and has made only 15 of 55 shots in the three games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm resorting back to my high school ways where I used to miss  
shots and get frustrated,'' Iverson said. ``These last three games 
have been tough offensively for me, but I was just trying to do the 
other things on the court, just stay involved with everything. We 
have people who are putting the ball in the hole.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Geiger, who signed a $52 million, six-year contract as a free  
agent, is giving Ratliff some much needed help in the middle. 
Though disjointed and even clumsy at times, the 7-foot-1 center has 
allowed Ratliff to move to his natural position of power forward, 
where he is wreaking havoc with 11 blocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're definitely playing well, things are going good and we're  
winning ball games,'' Geiger said. ``But if we were 0-3, I wouldn't 
say we're the worst team and we're not going to make the playoffs. 
It's the same with 3-0. We're not going to win every game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Larry Brown's decision to move Tim Thomas from the  
starting lineup to the bench has paid off. Thomas had 10 points in 
15 minutes on Tuesday night after scoring 13 points in 14 minutes 
in a 95-75 victory over Orlando in the home opener. 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie Larry Hughes has looked overmatched at times, but he came  
off the bench to score 16 points against the Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson, whose nickname is the Answer because his line of shoes  
bears that name, isn't the only one any more. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy. I'm not frustrated at all,'' Iverson said. ``As  
long as there's tomorrow, everything's all right with me. I could 
play 10 more bad games in a row as long as we win.''

<HEADLINE> FAA, Pilots Reach Runway Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government, airlines and a pilots union  
have agreed to continue using, with some modifications, takeoff and 
landing rules designed to speed the flow of traffic at congested 
airports. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Aviation Administration, the Air Transport  
Association and the Air Line Pilots Association International 
announced Tuesday that they had worked out new terms for continuing 
``land-and-hold-short operations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The technique, under which a landing plane stops short of a  
runway intersection so another plane can simultaneously use the 
crossing runway for a takeoff, helps reduce airport delays. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot association's 50,000 members had threatened to quit  
agreeing to such landings on Feb. 19 without some revisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the terms of the agreement:  
</P>
<P>
	--Both sides agree that land-and-hold-short operations should not  
be tried when it's wet, despite previous tests. They will be 
reserved for dry runways only. 
</P>
<P>
	--Airports will install two sets of lights in intersecting  
runways to both warn pilots of the upcoming intersection and to 
then mark precisely where the runways cross. 
</P>
<P>
	--Pilots and air traffic controllers will receive new training in  
land-and-hold-short operations. 
</P>
<P>
	--Both sides have agreed to use more conservative figures for  
calculating which runways qualify for land-and-hold-short 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	--Both will study several runways where an in-flight collision  
could occur if a pilot who aborted a landing continued into the 
path of an airliner taking off on an intersecting runway. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are pleased that with this agreement, airline passengers  
can be assured that land-and-hold-short operations will now be 
performed with increased margins of safety,'' said Capt. Duane 
Woerth, president of the pilots' association. 
</P>
<P>
	FAA Administrator Jane Garvey added: ``The three parties worked  
closely together to identify and resolve issues with the first 
consideration always being safety.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If pilots had refused to participate in land-and-hold-short  
operations, air traffic controllers would have had to wait until a 
landing airliner had turned off a runway before giving takeoff 
clearance to a plane using an intersecting runway. 
</P>
<P>
	That would have created widespread flight delays and missed  
connections. American Airlines passengers are currently 
experiencing such repercussions as the airline's pilots stage a 
work slowdown to protest provisions of American's recent purchase 
of Reno Air. 
</P>
<P>
	Land-and-hold-short operations were begun in 1968. Since then,  
air traffic has increased dramatically. Takeoffs and landings alone 
have risen from 55.9 million in 1985 to 61.1 million in 1996. At 
the same time, there has been an increase in the number of 
intersecting runways. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, land-and-hold-short operations are permitted at 850  
runways in 220 airports around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	As airlines have pushed to improve their on-time performance,  
pilots have expressed concern about the practice. A National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration database on 
land-and-hold-short operations also shows at least 50 incidents 
since 1996.

<HEADLINE> American Airlines Seeks Court Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- American Airlines asked a federal judge today to  
order its pilots to stop calling in sick in a dispute that forced 
the carrier to cancel 900 more flights today. 
</P>
<P>
	AMR Corp., the airline's parent company, asked U.S. District  
Judge Joe Kendall for a temporary restraining order and asked that 
the pilots be held in contempt of court if they continued to call 
in sick. 
</P>
<P>
	Airline attorney Dee Kelly also asked for damages, saying that  
the airline is losing money every day the ``sick out'' continues. 
``They're threatening to bring the airline to a complete halt,'' 
Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate reaction from the pilots' union.  
</P>
<P>
	The latest strife between American and its pilots -- which has  
resulted in travel delays for more than 200,000 passengers -- has 
now grounded about than 2,500 flights since Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Talks stalled last Friday in a dispute over when pilots from the  
recently acquired Reno Air would be upgraded to the pay scale 
received by American's pilots. The next day, many American pilots 
began calling in sick and refusing to fly voluntary overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of cancellations has escalated each day, with more  
than 800, or about 37 percent, of the airline's flights knocked off 
Tuesday's schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations have begun anew and were scheduled to continue  
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the purchase of Reno is the source of this dispute, ill  
will between the pilots and the company has been festering for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early 1990s in an attempt to stem losses, American  
Airlines closed three hubs and furloughed 610 pilots, while at the 
same time leasing its empty airport gates to Reno Air and Midway 
Airlines Inc. and selling frequent-flier miles on the smaller 
carriers. 
</P>
<P>
	American pilots saw the move as a way to shift work to their  
lower-paid counterparts at the smaller airlines. The distrust was 
highlighted by jokes among crew members that AMR stood for 
``American, Midway, Reno.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that this is a confrontation that has its roots in  
things that have happened in the past, and I think that (AMR 
chairman and chief executive Don) Carty seriously underestimated 
the residual anger that was there with the pilot group,'' said 
Holly Hegeman, an airline analyst for PlaneBusiness. 
</P>
<P>
	The bitterness between management and the pilots has complicated  
their relations for years. ``The level of distrust boggles my 
mind,'' said James Higgins, an analyst with Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; 
Jenrette. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, when contract negotiations faltered, American  
pilots staged a brief strike. 
</P>
<P>
	Last summer, more than 450 flights were canceled as pilots  
refused to work overtime to protest a passenger-sharing deal with 
Canadian Airlines Corp. And more than 1,000 flights were canceled 
during a dispute in 1990 in which American sought a court 
injunction against the pilots, whom the airline accused of staging 
an illegal sick-out. That dispute resulted in a public apology 
advertisement in the nation's newspapers which misidentified 
American's pilot union. 
</P>
<P>
	The recent turmoil hasn't helped to heal the rift. The Allied  
Pilots Association says AMR is moving too slowly in integrating the 
Reno pilots into their work force. The union wants pay raises for 
all pilots who will move into higher-paying jobs, retroactive to 
the company's purchase date of Dec. 23. 
</P>
<P>
	AMR said that it will take about 12 to 18 months to move pilots  
into their new positions and that the union's plan would cost as 
much as $50 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Carty, who took the reins of the company last year, said the  
``dysfunctional'' relationship between management and pilots is not 
one that he is proud of. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do regret that we don't have a better relationship with the  
Allied Pilots Association. I don't know the answer. ... We're going 
to keep plugging at it,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Jeff Daniels Relishes Outsider Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Jeff Daniels knows about aliens.  
</P>
<P>
	He stars opposite a Martian in his latest movie, and you might  
say he's from another world himself. 
</P>
<P>
	The 43-year-old actor is a Hollywood outsider, shunning the  
glitz and glamour for a quiet life in his Michigan hometown, 
despite a prosperous career of 33 movies that includes 
``Pleasantville'' and ``Dumb &AMP; Dumber.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There is so much pressure here. ... that after a while, it  
becomes so important for people to be noticed, to be talked about, 
photographed and interviewed. They bask in it,'' the soft-spoken 
actor said in a recent interview. ``But I wasn't capable of doing 
the schmooze.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daniels says only work can draw him back to Hollywood -- like on  
this day, when he is dutifully promoting his latest film, an update 
of the 1960s sitcom ``My Favorite Martian.'' Daniels plays the 
beleaguered, earthling straight man to Christopher Lloyd's manic, 
bug-eyed space traveler. 
</P>
<P>
	But something is wrong with the 6-foot-3-inch actor. His body  
has been invaded by those very tiny -- and very terrestrial -- 
organisms that bring us the common cold. 
</P>
<P>
	His eyes sink in fleshy bags. His long body sprawls over a  
delicate wooden chair that's too tiny for him. He sips a lot of 
orange juice and moves like a robot. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniels is exhausted and just wants to go home.  
</P>
<P>
	But he says the ``fantasy world'' of Hollywood always makes him  
want to go home. In 1989, that impulse drove him there for good. 
</P>
<P>
	A few months before the release of the spidery saga  
``Arachnophobia,'' Daniels abandoned the entertainment meccas of 
New York and Los Angeles and settled his family in Chelsea, Mich., 
about 50 miles west of Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I began to realize (producers) were calling enough, the phone  
was ringing enough that I could live anywhere,'' he said. ``I've 
never really left Michigan, even living nine years in New York. I 
was always still there. ... It has helped me stay real.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Daniels admitted he missed the creative energy of Hollywood  
studios, where he still marvels at the chance to perform on the 
same sound stages once graced by his screen favorites Spencer 
Tracy, Clark Gable and the Marx Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
	So to fill a little of Chelsea's creative void, Daniels founded  
the Purple Rose Theater Company in 1990. Though he hasn't yet 
appeared on its stage, Daniels has written several plays and 
occasionally directs shows. 
</P>
<P>
	The name was inspired by Woody Allen's film ``The Purple Rose of  
Cairo,'' in which Daniels -- in one of his first leading roles -- 
played an enchanted movie idol who literally steps off the silver 
screen into Depression-era New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniels said he founded the theater to bring a little showbiz to  
his hometown while giving the Midwestern actors and writers a venue 
for their work. 
</P>
<P>
	``Theater has always been there for me,'' he said. ``So I got a  
group of actors from that corner of the country. ... and really 
tried to work on getting local writers writing, instead of just 
performing scripts that were popular in New York last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When appearing in a movie, Daniels often hammers out the kinks  
in his plays during the downtime between shots. 
</P>
<P>
	He said it's his way of staying close to the theater even when  
he's filming on location. 
</P>
<P>
	``And, in a lot of ways, the characters I write, I'm acting  
them,'' he said. ``I wouldn't get to play them because I'm 
physically wrong for the part of a 30-year-old woman who doesn't 
believe in God, or the old man hunting in Escanaba.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though Daniels has returned to his roots and fled the celebrity  
life, he says he has never turned away from his affection for 
movies. He gets a kick out of studying audiences, and occasionally 
sneaks into darkened theaters to note their reaction to his work. 
</P>
<P>
	After seeing Daniels in ``101 Dalmatians,'' one audience member  
called him just to praise his ability to ``fall in love and get 
married in seven minutes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He said. ... `I thought you did a great job and I want you to  
know I'm a member of your fan club,''' Daniels recalled. The 
admirer was Dustin Hoffman. 
</P>
<P>
	``You hang on to stuff like that,'' Daniels said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Detained in Buffalo, N.Y. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Border Patrol officers have detained six  
Chinese nationals who crept into the United States by crawling 
across a bridge with the Niagara River roaring 200 feet below. 
</P>
<P>
	Three men and three women were captured about 12:30 a.m. Tuesday  
on the American side of the Whirlpool Bridge, about five miles 
downriver from Niagara Falls. As many as four other people ran from 
the Border Patrol officers who spotted them. 
</P>
<P>
	``An agent saw what he believed to be an animal,'' on the upper  
deck of the Whirlpool Bridge, said Don Palacios, assistant chief 
border patrol agent. ``He approached and realized it wasn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The upper deck of the bridge is reserved for trains.  
</P>
<P>
	The six were charged with illegal entry, a misdemeanor, and  
ordered held pending a detention hearing scheduled for today. 
</P>
<P>
	Only last month, four women were discovered wedged in a plywood  
box under a refrigerated fish truck at the Queenston-Lewiston 
bridge just north of Niagara Falls in an attempt to get into the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say a recent crackdown along the New York-Canadian  
border has authorities worried there will be even more risky 
smuggling attempts. 
</P>
<P>
	Those arrested on Tuesday may have paid smugglers up to $40,000  
each for passage into the United States. They had arrived in Canada 
within the past two weeks from the Fujian Province in southeastern 
China, Palacios said. 
</P>
<P>
	They could face up to six months in jail, $5,000 fines, or both.

<HEADLINE> Rap Foe's Defamation Suit Dismissed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A judge dismissed a defamation lawsuit filed  
by a gangsta rap critic against two news magazines for their 
reports on her earlier lawsuit against the estate of slain rapper 
Tupac Shakur. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Ronald L. Buckwalter threw out C. DeLores  
Tucker's lawsuit against Time, Newsweek, writers for those 
publications, and Shakur estate lawyer Richard Fischbein. 
</P>
<P>
	Buckwalter ruled that Mrs. Tucker, a former Pennsylvania  
secretary of state, was a public figure in the eyes of the law. 
That means she had to prove that Time and Newsweek wrote the 
stories with ``actual malice,'' knew they were inaccurate and would 
``embarrass and humiliate'' her and her husband, William. The 
Tuckers did not meet that burden of proof, Buckwalter ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a vast difference between being annoyed and/or  
embarrassed on the one hand, and being disgraced and ridiculed to 
the extent that one's reputation is harmed in the estimation of the 
community, on the other,'' the judge wrote in a ruling issued 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tuckers' $10 million lawsuit against Shakur's estate said  
the rapper's lyrics, in which he rhymed Mrs. Tucker's name with an 
obscenity, caused emotional distress that led to ``a loss of 
consortium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A subsequent article in Time referred to ``claims that lewd  
remarks made about her ... caused her so much distress that she and 
her husband have not been able to have sex.'' A Newsweek article 
referred to claims that the lyrics ``iced their sex life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tucker said the ``consortium'' complaint had nothing to do  
with sex. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tuckers' lawsuits are still pending against dozens of news  
outlets, including The Associated Press, that carried stories on 
the initial lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Buckwalter last month threw out the lawsuit against Shakur's  
estate, ruling that the references to Mrs. Tucker on Shakur's ``All 
Eyes on Me'' album were ``unpleasant at best and vulgar at worst'' 
but not libelous. 
</P>
<P>
	Shakur was shot to death in Las Vegas in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Child Welfare Workers Fired </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Five child welfare workers were fired  
Wednesday for failing to notice that a 6-year-old girl who was 
allegedly beaten to death by her father was being abused. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the fired employees was the investigator who asked a judge  
to return Kayla McKean to her father's home. 
</P>
<P>
	The firings follow an investigation by the Department of  
Children and Families, which has come under scrutiny since Kayla 
was killed Nov. 25. Two other agency employees have resigned. 
</P>
<P>
	At a meeting Tuesday, officials from six agencies agreed there  
was poor communication between the department and a private firm 
contracted to provide foster care and other services to Kayla's 
family. 
</P>
<P>
	Department officials have admitted that their investigators and  
supervisors missed repeated signs that the girl was being abused. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Adams, 24, confessed to hitting Kayla with his hands,  
slamming her against a wall and striking her with a paddle after 
she soiled her underwear, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
	He is charged with first-degree murder. The girl's 22-year-old  
stepmother, Marcie Adams, is charged with child neglect and abuse.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks To Expand AmeriCorps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is asking Congress to  
increase support for AmeriCorps so 100,000 youths can volunteer 
their time and energy through the national service program 
annually. New television ads are being developed to try to stoke 
interest in volunteering. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to make an all-out national effort to challenge young  
Americans to serve,'' said Bruce Reed, the president's domestic 
policy adviser. ``If we're going to come together as a country, the 
ethic of service needs to be part of every American's daily life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president's fiscal 2000 budget requests $585 million for  
AmeriCorps, a $113 million increase over last year. The increase 
would raise from 50,000 to 70,000 the number of high school- and 
college-age students who could participate next year, and set the 
program on a course to include 100,000 in the year 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was highlighting the plan during a speech at the  
University of Maryland today. In Maryland, high school students are 
required to perform volunteer work as a condition of graduation. 
Gov. Parris Glendening and Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., were 
attending. 
</P>
<P>
	In advance of the president's appearance, Republican National  
Committee Chairman Jim Nicholson circulated a statement 
spotlighting a plan ``hidden away in Bill Clinton's budget'' to cut 
$4.6 billion from the student loan program. Nicholson called it a 
``stingy, shortsighted proposal'' that would lead to higher student 
fees, slower loan approvals, fewer loan consolidations and higher 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	A national service program, akin to a domestic Peace Corps, was  
an early priority of the Clinton administration. Since the program 
was established four years ago, more than 100,000 people have 
participated. 
</P>
<P>
	AmeriCorps has not been popular with congressional Republicans,  
who have attempted several times to kill or severely curtail the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	AmeriCorps volunteer resources to schools, churches and  
nonprofit groups, such as Habitat for Humanity and the American Red 
Cross. 
</P>
<P>
	Also today, AmeriCorps was unveiling an MTV-produced public  
service campaign to encourage young people to get involved and 
provide information on how to enroll.

<HEADLINE> Leonard, Hearns To Promote Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Eighteen years after they first met in one of  
the great welterweight fights of all time, Sugar Ray Leonard and 
Thomas Hearns got into a bit of a tussle again Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, though, it was just over who would get to sit next to  
female boxer Mia St. John on the dais at the Las Vegas Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
	Hearns won the friendly skirmish, then he and Leonard turned to  
their main job at hand -- promoting Saturday's welterweight title 
fight between Oscar De La Hoya and undefeated Ike Quartey as the 
next great welterweight bout. 
</P>
<P>
	As much as they tried, though, it just wasn't the same.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to top the magnitude of what Ray and myself had,''  
Hearns said. ``These guys are in our shadow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya's defense of his WBC title against Quartey, a former  
WBA champion, is certainly on paper the best 147-pound title fight 
in some time, perhaps even stretching back into the era where 
Leonard, Hearns and Marvelous Marvin Hagler created some memorable 
bouts. 
</P>
<P>
	It promises to give De La Hoya his first major test against an  
undefeated fighter in his prime, and could set the stage for a 
series of big fights among the smaller fighters. 
</P>
<P>
	But, though it may be a fight fan's favorite, it comes no where  
near being the event that Leonard-Hearns was when they met for the 
first time at Caesars Palace nearly two decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``We generated far more intrigue, far more interest,'' Leonard  
said. ``Thomas Hearns was a personality. I was a personality. 
Everybody knew the power Thomas Hearns had and everyone knew what a 
ring technician I was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leonard and Hearns were brought in by promoter Bob Arum to help  
generate interest in the fight, which matches two undefeated 
fighters who have distinctly different styles and have both been 
champions in the 147-pound class. 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya may be the biggest name in boxing outside of Mike  
Tyson, but only those in the know have heard much about Quartey, 
despite his impressive credentials. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were concerned about how this fight would sell because of  
Quartey's relative anonymity,'' Arum said. ``He's from Ghana and 
doesn't talk much so people don't know about him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya, fighting in his 18th title bout at the age of 26,  
will be defending for the sixth time the WBC welterweight title he 
first won from Julio Cesar Chavez. 
</P>
<P>
	He'll be doing it against a big puncher who is 34-0-1 with 29  
knockouts and held the WBA version of the title before having to 
relinquish it to go after big money fights. 
</P>
<P>
	``I need to fight the tough guys to bring out the best in me,''  
De La Hoya said. ``I really can't wait to get into the ring because 
I know it will be a very tough fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quartey said little at Wednesday's final pre-fight news  
conference, though he did make a grand entrance behind a half-dozen 
people chanting his name and holding large yellow ``I Like Ike'' 
signs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been waiting for this opportunity all my life,'' said  
Quartey, who will receive some $3 million for the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Arum said some 12,000 tickets had been sold for the fight at  
UNLV's campus arena. It will be available on pay-per-view for a 
suggested retail of $39.95. 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya is a 3 1/2-1 favorite, and should he win he would fight  
again in May against the winner of the Frankie Randall-Oba Carr 
fight on the undercard. Then, he would likely either fight Felix 
Trinidad or a rematch with Pernell Whitaker sometime in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's delivered in every fight we've put him in,'' Arum said.  
``We're confident he will this time too.''

<HEADLINE> Fierce Winter Storm Hits Western US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- More than 8 feet of snow dumped on the Sierra  
Nevada in just four days closed Interstate 80 and triggered 
voluntary evacuations at parts of Lake Tahoe amid fear of 
avalanches. 
</P>
<P>
	Several major roads were shut down Tuesday because of spinouts  
and near-blizzard conditions. Hundreds of state workers were sent 
home early in Reno, Carson City and other cities. 
</P>
<P>
	In parts of Washoe County, sheriff's deputies went door-to-door  
late Tuesday urging dozens of residents to leave their homes until 
later today. An avalanche warning was in effect today along Lake 
Tahoe's north shore. 
</P>
<P>
	An avalanche closed the Mount Rose Highway southwest of Reno,  
burying the road under 8 feet of snow but causing no injuries. Over 
the weekend, one man was killed and three friends barely escaped 
after being buried for more than four hours in an avalanche near 
Donner Pass. 
</P>
<P>
	Snow was falling early today from Montana to the Wasatch  
Mountains of Utah. Some of the snowfall in Utah was heavy, 
prompting several winter storm warnings across the state. Skies 
over Nevada were clearing today. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescuers planned search again today for two missing men who  
failed to return from a weekend outing in Washington's Cascade 
Range. The search near Snoqualmie Pass was halted before nightfall 
due to the high avalanche danger, King County sheriff's deputy John 
Urquhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Interstate 80 was closed for several hours Tuesday from the  
Nevada-California state line west to Applegate, Calif., about 30 
miles northeast of Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's terrible,'' Sara Olson said at the J&AMP;L Food Mart in  
nearby Truckee, Calif. ``I'm getting very sick of this. If I have 
to pick up another shovel, someone's going to get hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, hundreds of big-rigs and commuters were stranded  
because a 50-mile stretch of Interstate 5 -- the main artery linking 
Southern California and the San Joaquin Valley -- was shut down by 
snow, ice and fog. 
</P>
<P>
	The highway over the Tehachapis some 60 miles north of Los  
Angeles was closed late Tuesday when the snow storm moved in and 
visibilities dropped to zero. The California Highway Patrol said 
I-5 would reopen before noon today. 
</P>
<P>
	Pounding rain also plagued Northern California. In San  
Francisco, gusty winds up to 60 mph uprooted trees and collapsed a 
three-story scaffold onto six parked cars. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Weather Service late Tuesday lifted flood watches  
issued for the Russian River in Sonoma County and flood warnings 
for the upper Napa River and Petaluma River. 
</P>
<P>
	But floods ate away at Sonoma County roads, forcing traffic to a  
single lane near Rio Nido. County officials declared a local state 
of emergency Tuesday to help pay for the millions in road repairs. 
</P>
<P>
	By Tuesday night, the powerful cold front had moved east and  
residents assessed the damage of the region's biggest storm since 
El Nino battered California last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Three unoccupied homes were crushed in the wine country town of  
Calistoga, Calif., when strong winds toppled a huge oak tree near 
the Napa River.

<HEADLINE>  Aamodt Wins Combined Skiing Event </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VAIL, Colo. (AP) -- Aamodt and Kjus. Kjus and Aamodt. The two  
Norwegian stars have become as inseparable as salmon and boiled 
potatoes at the World Alpine Ski Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Kjetil Andre Aamodt and Lasse Kjus finished 1-2 on Tuesday in  
the men's combined event, giving Aamodt his second medal at these 
championships and Kjus his third. 
</P>
<P>
	They feed off each other's accomplishments, and have been for  
more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lasse and I motivate each other by having good results,''  
Aamodt, 27, said. ``When he's not at the start, I don't feel like 
racing either. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been skiing against him since I was 6 years old, and he's  
the skier I measure myself against. He's been doing so well this 
year, and I feel fortunate to beat him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kjus, 28, agreed. ``Kjetil is such a marvelous skier. He  
motivates me and helps me to ski faster. We're a positive influence 
on each other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's the second time in these championships that Aamodt and Kjus  
have joined each other on the podium. Kjus was second in Saturday's 
downhill, behind Austria's Hermann Maier, and Aamodt was third. 
Last Tuesday, Kjus shared the super-G gold medal with Maier. 
</P>
<P>
	True to their symbiotic relationship, the Norwegians have  
dominated the two combined events on the World Cup circuit this 
season. Kjus was first and Aamodt second in a combined in Wengen, 
Switzerland, on Jan. 17. A week later, Aamodt was first and Kjus 
second in Kitzbuhel, Austria. 
</P>
<P>
	With his second medal, Aamodt tied Marc Girardelli's record for  
the most world championship and Olympic medals in a career, with 
13. Kjus is not far behind, with 11. 
</P>
<P>
	In this event, the combined times of a downhill and two slalom  
runs determine the combined champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Aamodt, gold medalist in combined at the last world  
championships in 1997 in Sestrieres, Italy, led Kjus by .40 seconds 
entering the second heat of the slalom. 
</P>
<P>
	Kjus had the second-fastest time in the second run of 45.12  
seconds, giving him a combined time of 2 minutes, 43.25 seconds and 
putting pressure on his teammate, who skied next. 
</P>
<P>
	But Aamodt was up to the challenge. Early in his run, he lost a  
few hundredths of his advantage, but he punched out gates in a mad 
rush to the bottom, finishing in 45.36 for a total time of 2:43.09. 
</P>
<P>
	Switzerland's Paul Accola took the bronze medal as the top seven  
racers after the first slalom run held their positions in the 
second run. 
</P>
<P>
	Accola, who finished second in the combined at the 1989 world  
championships here, overcame a slip near the finish when he got 
sideways between gates and still managed to post the fastest second 
run, 45.09. His combined time was 2:43.62. 
</P>
<P>
	``The combination is the worst competition for us because we  
know we're favorites,'' Aamodt said. ``The (time) difference in the 
downhill was small, so I knew I had to risk in the slalom to get 
the gold or take a medal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw Lasse push really hard out of the start, so ...''  
</P>
<P>
	Kjus said he was satisfied with the silver medal. ``I skied very  
well today. Kjetil skied a bit better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Austrian men and women claimed 10 out of a possible 15 medals  
through the first five events, but they were shut out for the first 
time on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Norway has five medals, all accounted for by Kjus and Aamodt.  
</P>
<P>
	Canada's Darin McBeath was the top North American, placing 13th  
in 2:49.67. Jakub Fiala of Breckenridge, Colo., was the top 
American, finishing 16th in 2:52.32. 
</P>
<P>
	Accola, who has been critical of the leadership of the Swiss Ski  
Federation, said, ``If winning the medal saves their jobs, I'm 
sorry I won it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Austria's Christian Mayer placed fourth in 2:43.89.  
Switzerland's Bruno Kernen, who paced the downhill portion of the 
combined on Monday but slipped to fifth place after a mediocre 
first slalom run earlier Tuesday, was fifth in 2:44.92. 
</P>
<P>
	Aamodt, the only skier to have won world-championship medals in  
all five disciplines, trailed Kernen by just .08 seconds in the 
downhill. Aamodt fashioned a first slalom run of 44.21 to move into 
first place overall at 1:57.73. 
</P>
<P>
	Kjus, third in the downhill but only .14 seconds behind Kernen,  
was timed in 44.55 in the first slalom and stood second overall at 
1:58.13. He lost some ground to his teammate, however, falling .40 
seconds behind Aamodt. 
</P>
<P>
	Mario Reiter of Austria, the 1998 Olympic combined champion,  
straddled a gate on his first slalom and was disqualified.

<HEADLINE> GOP Pushes Milder Tax Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans are working on modest tax relief  
alternatives as more questions are raised about the political 
wisdom of pushing a huge 10 percent income tax reduction that may 
never become law. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to ask yourself: Do you want to attempt something  
that may not be attainable, thereby deflating your supporters?'' 
asked Rep. Steve Largent, R-0kla. 
</P>
<P>
	Foremost among the options gaining in popularity is elimination  
of the marriage penalty, a quirk in the tax code in which millions 
of two-income couples pay more tax than if they weren't married. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans are determined to use for tax relief some of the  
projected $2.56 trillion budget surplus over the next decade, 
although most agree with President Clinton that 62 percent of the 
surplus should go to keep Social Security solvent. The fight will 
come over what to do with the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10 percent income tax cut enjoyed a boomlet of support when  
the new Congress convened last month. Now Republicans see several 
drawbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The broad cut is expensive, at an estimated $743 billion over 10  
years, and President Clinton is likely to threaten a veto as 
Democrats pound home their claim that it primarily benefits the 
wealthy. Such a fight could have a major impact on 2000 races, with 
control of the House hanging in the balance. 
</P>
<P>
	Fixing the marriage penalty, in contrast, enjoys broad support  
within the GOP and among Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't sense overwhelming support for a 10 percent reduction  
in rates,'' said Rep. Jerry Weller, R-Ill., a main sponsor of the 
marriage penalty measure. ``The best way is a more targeted 
approach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The marriage penalty affects an estimated 21 million two-income  
couples, many firmly in the middle class, who pay an average of 
$1,400 more in income taxes than they would if single. 
</P>
<P>
	Bills drafted by Weller and Rep. Nancy Johnson, R-Conn. -- both  
members of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee -- would 
fix this problem by giving married couples who file jointly a 
standard deduction equal to twice the $4,250 now available for 
singles. 
</P>
<P>
	Weller's measure, which had 223 cosponsors as of Wednesday,  
would go a big step further by extending the 15 percent tax bracket 
for married couples from a maximum of $41,200 now to $49,300, so 
that more of their income would be taxed at a lower rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Had those changes been made for 1998, it would have meant an  
average of $1,400 more for married couples. The Johnson measure 
would cost roughly $28 billion over five years, Weller's more than 
$100 billion in the same period. 
</P>
<P>
	For Republicans, the legislation has the added attraction of  
broad support from social conservative groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrea Sheldon, executive director of the Traditional Values  
Coalition, which represents 40,000 churches, said marriage penalty 
relief not only cuts taxes but makes a strong pro-family statement 
instead of discouraging couples from tying the knot. 
</P>
<P>
	To be sure, Republicans are far from giving up on the 10 percent  
income-tax reduction. The chairmen of the two budget committees, 
Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico and Rep. John Kasich of Ohio, are 
likely to include versions in spending blueprints Congress will 
consider this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	But those blueprints aren't binding, and the real heavy lifting  
on tax cuts will occur later in the Ways and Means Committee and in 
the Senate Finance Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation circulated by Johnson and supported by 11 other  
House GOP moderates that includes marriage penalty relief would 
also raise the outside earnings limit for Social Security 
recipients, accelerate full tax deductibility of health insurance 
premiums for self-employed people and enact tax breaks for 
long-term care and affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure is similar to the five-year, $80 billion tax relief  
package passed last fall by the House but never taken up by the 
Senate. This year's version would cost about $100 billion over five 
years.

<HEADLINE> Artist's Work From Attic to Gallery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTSMOUTH, Va. (AP) -- When Brad Face's mother died in 1992, he  
got to thinking about her French aunt. He had never met Tante 
Andree Ottoz, even though the two women had been close. 
</P>
<P>
	So Face and his wife, Dotty, finally went to see Tante Andree in  
Paris in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	That visit led to the rediscovery of the life's work of Tante  
Andree's father, the Belgian landscape artist Louis Dewis 
(pronounced lew-WEE doo-WEES). Acclaimed during his lifetime, in 
death he disappeared from the art scene, much like the hundreds of 
oil paintings that had been squirreled away in his daughter's attic 
since his death in 1946 at 74. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of those paintings now are on display, for the first time  
in more than 50 years, at The Arts Center of the Portsmouth 
Museums. The exhibit, ``Dewis: Rediscovered,'' continues through 
Feb. 14. 
</P>
<P>
	Tante Andree was 92 when Face went to visit her in the same  
antique-filled apartment near the Champs Elysees where she had 
lived since the 1930s. The walls bore paintings by the well-known 
19th-century French artist Camille Corot, and several by her 
father. 
</P>
<P>
	On the last day of their visit, Face mentioned that he preferred  
Dewis' work to Corot's. ``I think it's much more colorful, more 
pleasant to be with,'' Face told his great-aunt. 
</P>
<P>
	Face said the family back in Virginia only had about 10 Dewis  
paintings and that he wished there were more so he could mount a 
retrospective of the man's work. 
</P>
<P>
	Tante Andree replied: ``Oh, I think we have more in the attic.''  
</P>
<P>
	She added that she hadn't looked at them in 50 years and warned:  
``They may have all rotted away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Faces had to catch a plane. But they returned a year later  
and climbed the spiral staircase to the attic to find several 
dust-covered wooden crates stowed in a tiny storage room. 
</P>
<P>
	They picked the largest one and pried off its lid.  
</P>
<P>
	Their horror when sawdust fell out turned to relief when they  
looked at the brightly colored paintings. Done on board instead of 
canvas, they were dirty but in generally good condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Face estimated there were about 300 paintings, showing Belgian  
towns and countryside and pastoral scenes in France. 
</P>
<P>
	Tante Andree then also remembered that rolled-up canvases and  
piles of sketchbooks were hidden in a cabinet in a ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
	Growing up, Face had known a little about Dewis. ``He wasn't an  
unknown, and he wasn't a Renoir or a Monet,'' Face said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wanting to learn more, Face asked Tante Andree if she had any  
contemporary criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	She showed him a scrapbook kept by her mother, filled with  
articles raving about the beauty of his work. It, too, had been 
stowed in the cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
	Face, a former Norfolk television sportscaster who has no  
training in art, didn't know whether anyone else would be 
interested in seeing the paintings. Still, he decided to try to 
revive Dewis' reputation. 
</P>
<P>
	A neighbor back home knew the head of the Portsmouth Museums,  
whom Face invited to see the paintings. That led to the exhibit, 
which includes 50 oil paintings as well as sketches and even the 
artist's palette. 
</P>
<P>
	Face and his family spent 1998 preparing for the exhibit --  
cleaning the paintings, having them framed and doing research to 
figure out where the works were created. 
</P>
<P>
	Dewis scrawled place names on the backs of the paintings, but  
``he had the worst handwriting I've ever seen,'' said Face, 46, who 
heads The Face Cos., a high-tech materials and electronic research 
and development company in Norfolk. 
</P>
<P>
	Face designed the exhibit's layout and wrote descriptions of the  
paintings. He had his father, Sam, design an easel shaped like the 
Eiffel Tower to display one of the larger paintings. 
</P>
<P>
	Pat Dungan, assistant curator, said the exhibit is like a time  
capsule. ``Viewers can step back in time and they can see this 
gentleman's life unfold,'' she said. ``You could tell he was born 
to paint, and this is what he did. This was not a one-shot 
painter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Face and the museum hope to take the exhibit to other American  
museums, and Face would like to hold a similar show in Europe. He 
eventually wants to sell some paintings to pay for permanent homes 
in Europe and the United States for the bulk of the work. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, he's enjoying the positive comments he has overheard  
from museum-goers, and the joy the exhibit has given his Tante 
Andree. 
</P>
<P>
	She couldn't attend the premiere party for the Portsmouth  
exhibit in December, so Face videotaped it and showed her the tape 
when he recently revisited Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were tears rolling down her face,'' he said. ``This is  
something she really wanted to see while she was still on this 
earth -- the chance for her father's work to be appreciated again.''

<HEADLINE> Tyson's Future Clouded by Questions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- There are three big ifs blocking Mike Tyson's  
path before he can resume his boxing career. 
</P>
<P>
	If the judge who sentenced Tyson to jail permits him to travel  
out of state, if Indiana authorities don't revoke his probation and 
if Nevada authorities don't strip him of his boxing license, Tyson 
could very well be headlining a card in Las Vegas this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	It all starts with Tyson's behavior in the Montgomery County,  
Md., jail. If he doesn't cause trouble, he could begin training at 
an outside gym after the first two months or so of his one-year 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, if Tyson's promoters can schedule a fight, he and his  
lawyers would appear once again before District Court Judge Stephen 
Johnson and request to travel outside Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he wanted to have a fight, they would petition the judge,''  
Montgomery County State's Attorney Douglas Gansler said. ``It's not 
atypical. People do it all the time for weddings, funerals or 
sometimes for work-related business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson, who pleaded no-contest to charges stemming from the  
August fender-bender, has been in the jail since Friday. Shelly 
Finkel, Tyson's adviser, said those who have visited the boxer 
describe him as ``depressed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't expect a sentence of this severity at all,'' Finkel  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Typically, a prisoner with Tyson's sentence would serve about 60  
days in the jail before being transferred to the county's 
prerelease center, where inmates can leave during the day for work 
and return at night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any person who has a profession, we would make sure they could  
continue their work,'' Department of Corrections spokeswoman Claire 
Gunster-Kirby said. ``We would work with Mr. Tyson or anyone to 
make they could continue in their profession.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At first, Tyson could train at a gym and later earn other  
privileges, such as home visits during the day to spend time with 
his wife, Gunster-Kirby said. 
</P>
<P>
	During the sentencing hearing, witnesses said Tyson had $20  
million in debts, mostly to the IRS, and would need to fight three 
or four times this year to pay them off. 
</P>
<P>
	At 32, Tyson would be nearing the twilight of his boxing career  
even if it had not been interrupted by two jail sentences and a 
suspension for biting Evander Holyfield's ear during their 1997 
title bout. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson had been scheduled to fight a yet-to-be-named opponent  
April 24 in Las Vegas, although it's unlikely he could make that 
date if he remains in jail the full 60 days before transferring to 
the prerelease center. 
</P>
<P>
	Any plans for Tyson to fight could be thwarted by the Nevada  
Athletic Commission, which has the power to revoke the fighter's 
boxing license in light of the jail sentence. Tyson only recently 
was reinstated after a one-year suspension for the Holyfield 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
	The situation could also change if Tyson appeals his sentence.  
He could then face a jury trial and be acquitted -- or get a 
potentially harsher sentence if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's lawyers, who have 30 days to appeal, did not return  
calls Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Finkel said the lawyers want to see what action, if any, will be  
taken in Indiana, where Tyson remains on probation until March for 
a 1992 rape conviction.

<HEADLINE> Sick Smoker Gets $1.5M in Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A woman who blames her inoperable cancer on  
the smoking habit she took up as a teen-ager won $1.5 million in 
the first case to go to trial since California repealed a ban on 
individuals' lawsuits against tobacco companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The compensatory damages awarded Tuesday to Patricia Henley  
cover her medical costs, pain and suffering. The Superior Court 
jury was to consider punitive damages today. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Henley, 52, was diagnosed a year ago with inoperable cancer  
in her chest. She sued tobacco giant Philip Morris Cos. -- maker of 
cigarette brands including Marlboro and L&AMP;M -- alleging negligence, 
liability and fraud and blaming the company for her illness. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she began smoking at 15, several years before  
government-required warnings began appearing on cigarette packages 
in 1966. She claimed major tobacco companies failed to warn that 
smokers may be unable to quit the habit. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers on both sides of the case did not return phone calls  
seeking comment Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris released a statement saying it ``will have no  
further comment on the case or the verdict'' until the trial's 
punitive phase was completed. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first case since the repeal of a 1987 tort reform law  
that banned cigarette smokers' lawsuits on the basis that smoking's 
risks were well known. Dozens of cases were dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, then-Attorney General Dan Lungren joined justice  
officials in other states in suing the tobacco industry, and the 
state Legislature responded to criticism of the ban by repealing 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	The tobacco industry came to a $206 billion legal settlement  
with states in November but cigarette makers still face 
class-action lawsuits and individual lawsuits by smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Henley, of Los Angeles, quit smoking in 1997 after suffering  
coughing fits and other health problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris argued it was not liable for Ms. Henley's illness  
since she understood and assumed the risks of smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, a Florida appeals court overturned a Jacksonville  
jury's $1 million judgment for the family of a dead smoker against 
Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp., saying the case should not have 
been tried in Jacksonville. It was the third time a jury had 
awarded compensatory damages in a tobacco liability case; the first 
two verdicts also were overturned.

<HEADLINE> The Nation's Weather  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Unsettled weather draped itself across much of the West early  
today, threatening to dump up to a foot of snow in the Rockies and 
pushing rain into the Southwest. Avalanche warnings were posted in 
the Sierra Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
	Snow accumulations of 6 to 12 inches were possible from eastern  
Montana into the central Rockies, with whiteout conditions likely 
from drifting snow. Mountain snow was forecast across northern 
Arizona, Utah and northern New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Skies were clearing across much of California and western  
Nevada, but showers were forecast across southern Arizona and New 
Mexico. And a new system was bringing rain to coastal areas of the 
Pacific Northwest, with snow above 500 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Even as Nevada skies were clearing, four days of heavy Sierra  
Nevada snow and near-blizzard conditions prompted avalanche 
warnings along Lake Tahoe's northern shore today. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunshine should be abundant across the Northeast, with fair  
skies stretching from New England into the mid-Atlantic and Ohio 
Valley. A few flurries were possible in New England by evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Patchy rain was forecast across the Southeast, with a chance of  
thunderstorms. 
</P>
<P>
	Thunderstorms were lumbering toward the gusty southern and  
central Plains, with rain likely from the eastern Dakotas to the 
western Great Lakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Several inches of snow was forecast for the western Dakotas.  
</P>
<P>
	In Nebraska, dry pasture land helped fuel a North Platte brush  
fire that may have been sparked by a train Tuesday. More than 6,000 
acres have been scorched. 
</P>
<P>
	The hottest spot in the lower 48 states Tuesday was Del Rio,  
Texas, with a high reading of 92 degrees. The coldest place was 
Clayton Lake, Maine, with a low of 16 below zero. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's temperatures should range from the 20s in the northern  
Rockies to 80s in Florida and along the Gulf Coast, with readings 
elsewhere into the 30s for New England and the northern Plains, 40s 
for the Great Lakes and Northwest, the 50s for northern California, 
the 60s for the Ohio Valley and Southern California, and the 70s 
for the South and Southwest.

<HEADLINE>  Marines Accused of Flying Too Fast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A Marine jet that sliced through an  
Italian ski gondola cable, killing 20 people, violated the 
mission's speed limit during almost all of the flight, a witness 
testified Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Warrant Officer Jeffrey Poncelet said his analysis of  
tapes from the EA-6B Prowler flown by Capt. Richard Ashby showed 
that 89 percent of the flight was faster than the speed limit of 
517 mph. The jet was going more than 575 mph for 58 percent of the 
flight, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors have said the radar-jamming jet struck the ski  
gondola cable at 621 mph. Poncelet's testimony supported their 
claim that Ashby should have known he was flying too fast and 
violating an altitude restriction of 1,000 feet. The cable was hit 
at about 360 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby, 31, of Mission Viejo, Calif., is being court-martialed on  
20 counts of involuntary manslaughter, and other offenses. He could 
get more than 200 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, two witnesses testified that the radar altimeter  
on the jet malfunctioned on two earlier flights but was fixed. 
</P>
<P>
	Maintenance officer Lt. Col. Gary Eugene Slyman said that when  
Ashby pilot signed out the EA-6B Prowler on Feb. 3, 1998, the jet 
had a missing screw and an erratic air-conditioner, but nothing 
serious enough to ground it. 
</P>
<P>
	``This airplane was a solid player for us,'' Slyman said. ``This  
plane had flown the most sorties and most hours of any airplane we 
had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Slyman said that when he flew the plane on an earlier mission,  
the altimeter alarm -- which is supposed to go off when the plane 
dips below a preset altitude -- sounded at 25,000 feet instead of at 
the lower elevation it was set for. He said he reset the alarm and 
it corrected itself. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Scott Roys testified the radar altimeter stuck when he was  
in the same jet another time, but he and the pilot fixed it. 
</P>
<P>
	After the jet hit the cable, Ashby filed a complaint about the  
radar altimeter, Slyman said. Slyman didn't elaborate on the nature 
of the problem Ashby cited. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys also contend the ski area in the Alps wasn't  
on Ashby's map. 
</P>
<P>
	The Prowler's navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, 31, of  
Westbury, N.Y., is awaiting trial next month.

<HEADLINE> Tyson To Face Probation Hearing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Mike Tyson's probation officer says he will  
ask an Indiana judge next month to consider punishing the 
heavyweight fighter further following his sentencing in Maryland 
for assaulting two motorists. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a feeling back here in Indiana that he needs to be  
held accountable for the violation of probation,'' George Walker, 
chief of probation in Marion County, Ind., told The Washington 
Post. ``I can't say whether what Maryland does satisfies that or 
not. That will be up to the court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walker said Wednesday he will file paperwork after March 7  
asking Marion County Superior Court Judge Patricia Gifford for a 
hearing on whether Tyson violated his probation on a 1991 rape 
conviction in Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson, 32, was sentenced by a Maryland judge last week to a year  
in prison on a no-contest plea to kicking one motorist and punching 
another after a minor three-car accident in Gaithersburg, Md., last 
August. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the Maryland sentence, he will be eligible in 60 days to  
be moved to a pre-release center, where he could train during the 
day and, with good behavior, could be released from custody seven 
months from now. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson served three years of a six-year term in Indiana for the  
rape conviction. His probation for that crime was to have expired 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Kemp, Tyson's lawyer in the Maryland case, told the Post he  
is considering whether to file an appeal of the sentence there or 
asking the judge to reconsider the sentence.

<HEADLINE> Biotech Firm Loses Half Its Value </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                           *PHIL GALEWITZ   	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The tiny biotech firm EntreMed will press ahead  
with an experimental drug that briefly sparked hope for a cancer 
cure, but investors sliced the company's value in half Wednesday 
after Bristol-Myers quit plans to pay for human testing. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said late Tuesday's announcement by Bristol-Myers  
Squibb, the world's largest maker of cancer drugs, cast serious 
doubt on angiostatin's potential as a treatment for people with 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	They were also dubious about whether EntreMed, of Rockville,  
Md., has the scientific and financial capability to develop the 
drug by itself. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bristol is the leading drug company in cancer in the world. If  
they have no interest in the drug what does that say?,'' said Carl 
Gordon, an analyst with OrbiMed Advisors. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of EntreMed lost nearly half their value Wednesday on the  
Nasdaq Stock Market, falling $11.62 1/2 to $12.87 1/2. That's less than a 
dollar above where the stock was on the morning of May 4, the day 
when angiostatin was featured in a front page article in The New 
York Times and the stock soared as high as $85. 
</P>
<P>
	EntreMed officials say they can survive without Bristol-Myers  
and move ahead with human testing. The company has $32 million in 
cash, and no long term debt. But analysts said it would take $100 
million or more to develop such a drug. 
</P>
<P>
	Bristol-Myers had spent tens of millions researching  
angiostatin, a naturally occurring human protein, after obtaining 
development rights from EntreMed in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Harvard University scientist Judah Folkman gained worldwide  
attention last spring when he reported that angiostatin, combined 
with a second EntreMed compound called endostatin, shrunk tumors in 
rats by cutting off their blood supply. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the ensuing months, other scientists raised questions  
about the discovery, saying they could not duplicate the results of 
Folkman's research. 
</P>
<P>
	Bristol-Myers reported that it was having trouble producing  
angiostatin in the laboratory and demonstrating that the drug 
destroyed cancer cells in rats. 
</P>
<P>
	Bristol-Myers now plans to focus on other anticancer agents,  
said spokeswoman Peggy Ballman. The company retains development and 
marketing rights for angiostatin. 
</P>
<P>
	But EntreMed officials say if Bristol seeks to rejoin efforts to  
develop angiostatin, it will have to pay higher royalty fees. 
</P>
<P>
	EntreMed plans to seek Food and Drug Administration permission  
by year's end to start human testing of angiostatin, and hopes to 
get FDA approval to start testing endostatin even sooner, said 
spokeswoman Mary Sundeen. She said the company has made advances on 
both drugs, which can work to shrink tumors separately or together. 
</P>
<P>
	Sundeen did concede that Bristol-Myers' decision would have a  
short-term impact. 
</P>
<P>
	``From a financing perspective, it hits us pretty hard,'' she  
said, adding that ``there is also a perception out there that 
angiostatin does not work because Bristol Myers Squib does not want 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sundeen noted that in 1996, Bristol-Myers quit research into  
using the controversial drug Thalidomide to help cancer patients. 
EntreMed went ahead and developed the product and licensed it to 
Celgene Inc., which received FDA approval last year and has seen 
strong early sales. 
</P>
<P>
	EntreMed officials still will consult with Bristol-Myers' top  
scientists on angiostatin, and will get research help from the 
National Cancer Institute, Sundeen said. 
</P>
<P>
	But industry watchers say EntreMed faces a tough road ahead.  
</P>
<P>
	``It won't be easy and $30 million is not enough,'' said Viren  
Mehta, an analyst with Mehta Partners in New York. ``Yet, a small 
focused company willing to take a certain amount of risk can move 
faster than a larger company may be able to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Ultimately, EntreMed will have to take on another partner,''  
said OrbiMed's Gordon. Brostol Myers' decision ``substantially 
reduces the chances for EntreMed to do it themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bristol-Myers, which put $1.6 billion into drug development last  
year, said it routinely reviews all research spending each winter. 
</P>
<P>
	Notably, the drugmaker also announced Wednesday that it is  
suspending study of the drug lobucavir for chronic hepatitis B and 
herpes after studies showed possibilities of increased drug-related 
tumors in rodents. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said they had hoped the drug, which was in final phase  
of human testing, would generate hundreds of millions in annual 
sales.

<HEADLINE> US, Brit Jets Fire on Iraqi Sites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For the first time in a week, U.S. and British  
warplanes fired at two air defense sites in Iraq today after three 
waves of Iraqi fighter jets violated the southern ``no-fly'' zone, 
U.S. military officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The incidents occurred near Talil, about 170 miles southeast of  
Baghdad, and near An Najaf, about 100 miles south of Baghdad, 
between 2:30 a.m. and 4:30 a.m. EST, said the U.S. Central Command. 
</P>
<P>
	The official Iraqi News Agency reported the strikes killed one  
civilian and injured others. 
</P>
<P>
	All coalition aircraft, including six F-15E fighters and several  
British GR-1 Tornado fighter-bombers, returned safely to their 
bases, the Pentagon said. The warplanes used precision-guided 
missiles and 500 and 1,000 pound bombs, although U.S. officials 
didn't say how many. 
</P>
<P>
	In three separate incidents, a pair of Russian-made MiG-23 or  
MiG-25 jets entered the no-fly zone, where U.S. and British patrols 
have barred Iraqi military flights since after the 1991 Gulf War to 
protect rebel groups from Saddam Hussein's forces, U.S. officials 
said. The Iraqi planes immediately turned tail when confronted, the 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were involved in this pattern of cheat and retreat,''  
said Navy Lt. Cmdr. Ernest Duplessis, a spokesman for U.S. Central 
Command in Florida. ``It was a provocation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. pilots weren't targeted by the Iraqi jets or by the  
anti-aircraft missile sites, but struck against the air defense 
systems as a self-defensive measure, Duplessis said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no (radar) illumination, but anytime we have a  
violation of the no-fly zone that is a threat,'' Duplessis said. 
``And so the air defense sites were struck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. warplanes struck six Iraqi targets, including  
surface-to-air-missile batteries and associated command and control 
systems, according to Duplessis, who said a damage assessment was 
still under way to determine if the sites were destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no incidents in the northern no-fly zone, the  
Pentagon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coalition aircraft have destroyed about 40 air defense sites  
during more than 80 no-fly zone violations by Iraq since December 
when Saddam began challenging the no-flight regions following the 
four-day mid-December U.S. and British bombing campaign against 
Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton last month approved more aggressive rules of  
engagement for U.S. pilots aimed at taking out air defense sites 
when the opportunity arises during no-fly provocations. The goal is 
to weaken Saddam's ability to strike back and to make no-fly 
patrols safer, U.S. officials said.

<HEADLINE>  Papillon Wins at Westminster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The smallest dog proved the biggest and best of  
them all as a dainty papillon floated to victory Tuesday as 
best-in-show at the Westminster Kennel Club's 123rd annual show. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-pound dog -- who came within a whisker of the prize in 1996  
-- lived up to his own name, Loteki's Supernatural Being, and his 
breed's name, French for butterfly, as he flew around the ring with 
handler-owner John Oulton. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the 31st best-in-show for Kirby, at 8 years old a veteran  
of the show ring. He also collected top prize this summer at the 
World Championship in Helsinki. 
</P>
<P>
	``Helsinki was incredible, of course, there were 16,000 dogs,''  
Oulton said. ``But I think this is really, for me, the top, top 
award.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Edd Embry Bivin praised all seven finalists, chosen Monday  
and earlier Tuesday to represent their breed groups, but said Kirby 
stood head and batlike ears above the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	``They put together a pack that was really something to see,''  
he said. ``This little dog was so on for this night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kirby came in second to a clumber spaniel in 1996, then didn't  
even win his breed the following year. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, unlike most Westminster winners, he won't retire to the  
home he shares with Oulton and 10 other pets in Norwalk, Conn., 
though Oulton already limits him to a few shows a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could never retire this dog because he loves to show so  
much,'' he said. ``He may make two or three appearances a year just 
to let him have the fun of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kirby was chosen from among 2,500 dogs representing 152 breeds.  
Westminster is essentially a beauty contest: The dogs are judged 
solely on how they meet the American Kennel Club standards for 
their breed. 
</P>
<P>
	Other group winners chosen Monday and Tuesday were:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Non-sporting: Lake Cove That's My Boy, a standard poodle who  
also won the group last year, owned by longtime Westminster 
exhibitor Mrs. Alan Robson of Glenmoore, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Terrier: Sunspryte's Just In Thyme, a Welsh terrier owned by  
comedian Bill Cosby with Jean Heath and Beth Bates of Pleasanton, 
Calif. Another Cosby-Heath dog, the Lakeland terrier Revelry's 
Awesome Blossom, was fourth in the group. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Working: Mentmore's Windy Meadow, a 3-year-old Bernese  
mountain dog owned by Cheryl Paterson of London, Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Sporting: Bit O Gold Titan Treasure, who also won the group in  
1997 and 1998. The Gordon setter is is owned by Susan Lubrand, 
Barry Rose, Judy Brown and Peggy Nowak of Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Hound: Sundown Alabster Treasure, a graceful saluki owned by  
James D. Black of San Andreas, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Herding: Windwalker's Yes Virginia, a German shepherd who beat  
the old English sheepdog that won the group last year. The 
4-year-old dog belongs to Jamie Walker and Joe Greer of 
Albuquerque, N.M.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Will Seek To Work With GOP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will reach out to  
Republicans to work on a legislative agenda after his impeachment 
trial, although no one can ``pretend that none of this ever 
happened,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, trying to close the most painful chapter of his  
presidency, plans to make a public statement after the Senate takes 
the expected vote to acquit him. Lockhart said he did not know 
whether Clinton would speak in person or issue a written statement 
but that his reaction would come on the same day of the vote, 
perhaps as early as Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The impeachment ordeal, triggered by Clinton's effort to conceal  
his sexual relationship with a former intern, has engendered bitter 
feelings between the White House and Republicans in Congress who 
tried to force Clinton from office. 
</P>
<P>
	With the end in sight, White House officials have been debating  
how Clinton should react. Lockhart has promised the White House 
would be a ``gloat-free'' zone. Republicans were furious when 
Clinton staged an upbeat White House rally with House Democrats on 
Dec. 19 just after the House voted to impeach him. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart, asked whether Clinton can expect to be criticized no  
matter how he acts, said, ``I think that there are people here who 
understand that some of this game isn't on the level.'' He said 
Clinton's reaction to acquittal would be ``relief and an 
anxiousness to continue doing the job that he's been doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton told a University of Maryland audience that his goal as  
president was to ``bring America together again'' and not let 
divisions overcome common goals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Martin Luther King once said that the old law of 'an eye for  
an eye' sooner or later leaves everyone blind,'' Clinton said. ``We 
have to find this magical balance of being honest about our 
differences of opinion on matters from the serious to the 
mundane.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While once there was talk of imposing a heavy financial penalty  
on Clinton or stripping him of his pension, Republicans and 
Democrats are now divided over whether there should be any censure 
at all. Some lawmakers argue there is nothing in the Constitution 
about censure, and some Republicans oppose censure on the ground 
that it would give Democrats political cover after voting to acquit 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart said that Clinton ``would be open to some censure. He  
understands the wrongful nature of his behavior.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The spokesman said Clinton looks forward to working with  
Republicans on his agenda, which includes repairing Social 
Security, reforming managed-care health plans and improving 
schools. He said Clinton would look forward to sitting down with 
Republican and Democratic leaders but noted that Congress is 
expected to begin a recess Friday after the expected impeachment 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked how Clinton could deal with his impeachment adversaries,  
Lockhart said, ``Well, I don't know that you could ever pretend 
that none of this ever happened. But the president said very 
directly in the State of the Union (address) that it's the peoples' 
business that comes first. 
</P>
<P>
	``And in order to do the peoples' business,'' Lockhart said,  
``the president has to work with Democrats and Republicans in the 
House and in the Senate. He plans to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The spokesman noted that Republicans ``have some quite different  
ideas'' from Clinton's about how to address the nation's problems. 
``But that's not going to stop us on a range of issues of 
continuing to work with them.'' He said both parties would have a 
different approach as the 2000 elections approach, ``and it will be 
up to the voters to decide.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Court Limits Miranda Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- A federal appellate court has ruled that  
prosecutors may rely on confessions obtained from suspects who 
never received Miranda warnings, as long as the statements were 
made voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision released Monday by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of  
Appeals contradicts Justice Department policy and could touch off a 
new Supreme Court battle over the rights of criminal suspects. 
</P>
<P>
	In reaching its decision, the 4th Circuit upheld a law passed by  
Congress in response to the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark 1966 
Miranda ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	As memorialized in countless police dramas, the high court in  
that ruling held that investigators must first advise suspects of 
specific constitutional rights -- the right to remain silent, the 
right to have a lawyer present -- in order for their statements to 
be used as evidence at trial. 
</P>
<P>
	In federal and state prosecutions ever since, failure to recite  
such warnings often resulted in a valuable piece of evidence -- a 
confession or some incriminating statement -- being lost to 
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1968, Congress passed a law that said such statements can be  
used at trial as long as federal judges are sure the statements 
were voluntary and not coerced. Compliance with Miranda, according 
to the law, is just one factor to be considered by a court. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno, in a letter to Congress two years  
ago, said the 1968 law was unconstitutional. The Justice Department 
for years has declined to rely on it during appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	That tradition was followed when U.S. District Judge James  
Cacheris threw out the confession of Charles Dickerson that he 
robbed a bank in Alexandria. Dickerson said his 1997 statement was 
given before he was told of his right to remain silent and see an 
attorney. The government appealed. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4th Circuit reversed Cacheris and criticized the Clinton  
administration for refusing to use the 1968 law. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress possesses the legislative authority to overrule  
judicially created rules of evidence and procedure that are not 
required by the Constitution,'' Judge Karen Williams wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	In dissent, Judge M. Blane Michael said he was troubled that the  
court based its ruling on a law not even raised by the government 
in its appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4th Circuit's 2-1 ruling is binding for federal cases in  
five states -- Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina 
and West Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	But David Cole, a constitutional scholar at Georgetown  
University Law Center, predicted the Supreme Court would review the 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``It demonstrates yet again that the 4th Circuit is out on the  
extreme conservative end of the spectrum among federal courts,'' 
Cole said Tuesday. ``The court here took a position more 
pro-government than the government.''

<HEADLINE> Lightning Owner May Sell Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Less than a year after buying the Tampa Bay  
Lightning, owner Art Williams is talking about the possibility of 
getting rid of the struggling NHL franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	Unhappy with how the team is performing, Williams told the Tampa  
Tribune in Wednesday's editions that he will sell the team and 
rights to the Ice Palace if he can't finalize a partnership 
arrangement by early this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The 56-year-old retired insurance magnate bought the Lightning  
and rights to the arena for $117 million last May. He said he's 
confident he can find a partner by the end of June. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the possible suitors, Williams said, is a local individual  
who has come forward with ``a 50-50'' proposition. Another 
possibility might involve sharing ownership with two out-of-town 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would still have a sizable investment in that scenario, but  
the guy who might be the majority owner has tremendous NHL 
experience,'' Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams declined to identify any of the interested parties, but  
vowed, ``the people of Tampa Bay would be delighted if either came 
aboard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Tribune said Williams, of Palm Beach, may lose more than $20  
million in his first season as an NHL owner. Anyone buying the 
franchise would have to keep the team in Tampa since the Lightning 
have 27 years remaining on their 30-year lease with the Tampa 
Sports Authority. 
</P>
<P>
	Last summer Williams took over a franchise that was struggling  
on and off the ice. 
</P>
<P>
	The first-year owner has raised the team payroll, funded  
improvements in the Ice Palace, agreed to charter flights for all 
road trips and paid off a number of creditors. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, the Lightning continue to lose. At their current pace,  
they'll finish with the NHL's worst record for the second straight 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't been coming to games recently for a simple reason --  
this team broke my heart,'' Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't have been happier the first month of the season ...  
then the bottom fell out. I've been more upset with the constant 
losing than all the money coming out of my wallet. This has been a 
painful experience for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, coach and general manager Jacques Demers on Wednesday  
said Williams has not placed any restrictions on what he can or 
can't do to try to try to turn the team around. 
</P>
<P>
	``I spoke to Art (Tuesday). He didn't tell me not to trade any  
players,'' Demers said, adding that he understands the owner's 
feelings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Art is a businessman. I don't have to sign the checks every  
two weeks. I don't have to lose $20 million this year,'' Demers 
said. ``Every conversation I've had with Art the last two weeks has 
been extremely positive about the direction the team is headed. 
He's the owner. It's his team. He has to do what he thinks is best 
for his family.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Knocks Medical Spending Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans lashed out at the Clinton  
administration on Wednesday for the president's failure to ask for 
a significant boost in medical research spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Clinton pledged to increase spending at the National  
Institutes of Health by 50 percent over five years, but his budget 
for 2000 pushes up spending a mere 2 percent, to nearly $16 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The budget is ``very, very cynical,'' said Rep. John Porter,  
R-Ill., chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee that 
handles health spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``It isn't fair to the budget process or even this committee to  
come in with a budget like this,'' he told Health and Human 
Services Secretary Donna Shalala. ``The budget retains the 
president's rhetoric but none of the money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, Clinton asked for a 2.6 percent raise for NIH.  
But last year, Vice President Al Gore announced with great fanfare 
a plan to significantly increase spending over five years, starting 
with an 8 percent jump the first year. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress did even better, raising the NIH budget 14 percent to  
about $15.6 billion for 1999 -- enough to cover two years of 
increases under Clinton's five-year plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Republicans are charging that the administration  
purposefully shortchanged NIH for 2000, knowing that Congress, 
where medical research enjoys considerable bipartisan support, 
would again add more money. That could allow the president to use 
scarce money available under tight budget caps to pay for other 
initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's extremely frustrating,'' said Rep. Dan Miller, R-Fla.  
Given inflation, he added, ``really we're cutting NIH in your 
budget.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller asked Shalala how much she had requested for NIH as the  
White House developed its budget plan. She declined to answer but 
said she understood GOP concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	``I share some of the frustration, obviously,'' she told the  
subcommittee. ``Going up and down is not the way to make long-term 
commitments to NIH.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, she insisted that the administration remains committed to  
its five-year plan to increase NIH funding by 50 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	One cautionary note was sounded Wednesday by Rep. David Obey,  
D-Wis., who said that NIH budgets cannot continue to climb at the 
expense of other programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The education and health and job budgets are also important,''  
he said, lecturing the assembled array of lobbyists for medical 
research. ``You had better not play the 'me-only game.' You have to 
realize we're all in this together.''

<HEADLINE> Wendell Hopes 99s Bring Good Luck </HEADLINE>

	NEW YORK (AP) -- For Turk Wendell, getting his one cent in wasn't

	Wendell, a rather superstitious relief pitcher who wears uniform

the New York Mets on a one-year contract worth $1,200,000.99. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to his base salary, Wendell can earn three bonuses

	``I love 99, so why not?'' Wendell said. ``I want to have as  
many 99s in my contract as possible. It has to give me good luck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wendell, who made $661,000 last year, also can earn a $17,500  
bonus for finishing 45 games, which is unlikely to happen because 
John Franco is the Mets' closer. Wendell also can earn a $17,500 if 
he's selected for the NL All-Star team. 
</P>
<P>
	Wendell, a 31-year-old right-hander, was 5-1 with four saves and  
a 2.93 ERA in 66 games last season. He broke a team record 
previously held by Jesse Orosco when he appeared in nine 
consecutive games last September. 
</P>
<P>
	New York had submitted a $1.05 million figure in salary  
arbitration and Wendell had asked for $1,575,000. A hearing had 
been scheduled for Friday in Tampa, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortstop Rey Ordonez and reliever Armando Benitez are the only  
Mets players remaining in arbitration. The team has not gone to a 
hearing since 1992.

<HEADLINE> EntreMed Stock Plunges on Drug Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRINCETON, N.J. (AP) -- Shares of EntreMed Inc. lost half their  
value today after drug giant Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. withdrew its 
backing for joint development of a drug previously touted for its 
apparent cancer-fighting qualities. 
</P>
<P>
	Angiostatin, a naturally occurring human protein, was thrust  
into the spotlight last May when it was featured in a front-page 
New York Times article. 
</P>
<P>
	According to research by Dr. Judah Folkman of Children's  
Hospital in Boston, the combination of angiostatin and the drug 
endostatin was able to shrink tumors in mice by cutting off the 
tumor's blood supply. Neither of the drugs has been tested on 
people, however. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement Tuesday, Bristol-Myers cast doubt on the drug's  
future. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this time, angiostatin protein in its present form does not  
meet our criteria for molecules that advance to clinical trials,'' 
said Robert A. Kramer, vice president of Oncology Drug Discovery 
for the Princeton-based Bristol-Myers Squibb. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times reported today that Kramer said the company's main  
concern was not the effectiveness of the compound, but whether it 
could be manufactured in large enough amounts to sustain tests in 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	As recently as last November, a Bristol-Myers spokesman said  
they hoped human testing would begin late this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Bristol-Myers previously had a co-agreement with EntreMed of  
Rockville, Md., to conduct research and development on angiostatin. 
Under a new agreement announced Tuesday, the much smaller EntreMed 
will now take on all responsibility for laboratory research into 
the drug. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading this morning on the Nasdaq Stock Market, EntreMed  
plummeted 50 percent, dropping $12.25 to reach $12.25 a share. 
Bristol-Myers was off 31 1/4 cents at $122.18 3/4 a share on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	It's unclear whether EntreMed has the financial resources to  
continue the years of research needed to bring angiostatin to 
market. For the nine months ended Sept. 30, EntreMed lost $8.8 
million on revenues of $3.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	EntreMed also holds the license to endostatin.  
</P>
<P>
	Calls to the EntreMed offices by The Associated Press were not  
immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Bristol-Myers, which had $18.2 billion in 1998 sales, will end  
almost all of its laboratory study of the protein, focusing instead 
on other anticancer agents, the company said. It is retaining its 
right to reassume development and marketing rights to a drug based 
on angiostatin if further research shows it to be effective. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Children's Hospital said the change in the  
research agreement had no immediate effect on the hospital's 
working arrangement with EntreMed.

<HEADLINE>  Buckeyes Making a Great Turnaround </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- At times, it seems as if Jim O'Brien can't  
believe it. He looks at the Big Ten standings, and there's his team 
in second place. 
</P>
<P>
	Few can quite believe it, either.  
</P>
<P>
	Just a year ago, Ohio State was at its lowest point in 99 years  
of men's basketball. Now the Buckeyes are making one of the great 
turnarounds in NCAA Division I history. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never thought going into this year we would find ourselves  
in this position,'' O'Brien said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State is 18-6 overall and 8-3 in the Big Ten -- a galaxy  
away from last season's marks of 8-22 and 1-15. Now they own a No. 
13 ranking entering Saturday's game at Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no question that going into this season, if somebody  
would have said, 'With only six games remaining you guys are going 
to be 13th in the country,' I would have thought that they were 
crazy,'' O'Brien said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State has five difficult Big Ten games remaining, then the  
conference tournament and a likely NCAA tournament berth. 
</P>
<P>
	If they win the rest of their regular-season games, take the  
league tournament and one NCAA tournament game -- in other words, 
nine straight wins -- the Buckeyes will be assured the greatest 
Division turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year was really a tough season for them,'' Bob Knight  
said after Ohio State battered Indiana 73-56 last month in the most 
lopsided loss he has endured to his alma mater. ``This year they've 
really improved defensively. I think Ohio State is a team that will 
give anybody in our conference a difficult time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They are a top 15 team,'' says Minnesota coach Clem Haskins,  
whose team fell 89-60 to the Buckeyes. 
</P>
<P>
	Just a year ago, the 22 losses matched the worst total in school  
history and the Big Ten record was its worst ever. The team lost a 
record 17 games in a row during the season and extended its Big Ten 
losing streak to 20. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Ohio State is closing in on Michigan State for the Big Ten  
lead. After Tuesday night's 74-69 win over Michigan -- running Ohio 
State's record at its new Value City Arena to 12-1 this year -- 
O'Brien didn't want to discuss the postseason. It was as if he 
might jinx himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I want them to do is to be focused in on the next  
opponent,'' he said. ``We've had very few -- and forget about bad 
games -- we've had very few bad practices this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With four starters back this season, the only substantive  
addition was point guard James ``Scoonie'' Penn. 
</P>
<P>
	Penn, a muscular pinball generously listed as 5-foot-10, was the  
freshman of the year in the Big East three years ago at Boston 
College under O'Brien. He was the conference tournament MVP two 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Brien, who was hired in 1997 to replace Randy Ayers and clean  
up a program damaged by brushes with the law, brought Penn to 
Columbus. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the season, Penn was asked how good the Buckeyes would  
be. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first thing he blurts out is, 'I think we should be in the  
NCAA tournament,''' O'Brien said. ``I'm looking at him like, you 
know, he's nuts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Penn is joined by Michael Redd, who a year ago became the first  
freshman to lead the Big Ten in scoring. Center Ken Johnson has 
turned into a shot-swatting presence while forwards Jason Singleton 
and Jon Sanderson do their share on defense and the boards. 
</P>
<P>
	Contributions also have come from reserves George Reese, Neshaun  
Coleman and freshmen Brian Brown and Boban Savovic. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a hard time believing right now there are not 13 teams  
in the country better than we are -- or more than 13,'' O'Brien 
said. ``We have some very good wins, but I still remain very, very 
cautious in what we're doing with our team because I think there's 
a fine line with how good we can be.''

 *Executives Searching for Work    	
</P>
<P>
	LAYOFF SURVEY: The job cuts that many big companies announced at  
the end of 1998 sent many highly-paid executives searching for 
work, reports Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas, an employment 
consulting firm. Challenger Gray found in a survey that the median 
salary of managers and executives before they were laid off during 
the fourth quarter was $92,000, up 18 percent from the median 
$78,000 earned by executives dismissed during the third quarter. 
The survey also found it's taking longer for managers to find new 
jobs than it took several months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	CUSTOMER SERVICE: A Web site set up to record customer  
complaints and kudos found consumers believe the service they 
receive from many businesses, institutions and government offices 
keeps getting worse. The site, created by Service Intelligence, a 
consulting firm, found the most complaints about workers in the 
medical field, retailing, airlines and the government. The best 
service was reported at hotels, followed by restaurants. Service 
Intelligence said 445 people responded to the online survey, with 
46 reporting overall service in this country is getting worse. 
Thirty-six percent believe it's the same, and 18 percent see an 
improvement. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
	JUGGLING ACT: Parents find it hard to balance work and family,  
but many believe that having children makes them better employees. 
A survey of 1,002 adults commissioned by Lutheran Brotherhood, a 
financial services concern, found 52 percent of employed parents 
believe they're more productive because they have children. The 
survey conducted by Yankelovich Partners found only 11 percent say 
parenthood made them less productive. Gwen Kuhrt, the human 
resources manager for Lutheran Brotherhood, says the increase in 
productivity may be because, ``some parents may try to work more 
efficiently so that they have more time to spend with their kids.''

<P>
	TRAVEL TAKES ITS TOLL: If you're frazzled from traveling for  
your job, you have plenty of company in your misery. Management 
consultants Runzheimer International reported that a survey of 
business travelers found many are stressed out and suffering from 
fatigue, loss of humor, aching arms and legs, paranoia, memory 
loss, hyperactivity and crying. Most of the stressed travelers 
point the finger of blame at airlines because of lost luggage, long 
lines and not enough air conditioning on flights.

<HEADLINE> Lang-Tchernyshev Leads Ice Dancing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Naomi Lang and Peter Tchernyshev, the  
apparent heirs to the American ice dancing crown held seemingly 
forever by Elizabeth Punsalan and Jerod Swallow, strengthened their 
lead Wednesday in the original dance. 
</P>
<P>
	Lang and Tchernyshev, former training partners with five-time  
winners Punsalan and Swallow at the Detroit Skating Club, also took 
the compulsories the previous night at the U.S. Figure Skating 
Championships. As usual in dance, there was little change in the 
standings, with Tuesday's runners-up, Eve Chalom and Mathew Gates, 
still in second place. 
</P>
<P>
	Third place still belonged to Deborah Koegel and Oleg Fediukov  
heading into Friday's free dance, worth 50 percent of the overall 
score. 
</P>
<P>
	Performing to Tchaikovsky's ``Waltz of the Flower'' from ``The  
Nutcracker,'' Lang and Tchernyshev finished first with eight of the 
nine judges. Chalom and Gates, who skated to Shostakovich's 
``Second Waltz,'' got the other first-place vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was the first time we debuted that one,'' Lang said.  
``But we skated that really well, we felt. It fits out style a 
little bit more than `Masquerade Waltz.' 
</P>
<P>
	``We both used to do ballet and I danced to `The Nutcracker,' so  
it is kind of like coming home. And he's Russian, so he understands 
it well.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-BMW Exec May Be Heading to Ford </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- An executive who once was considered to be next  
in line to head German automaker BMW AG may be heading to Ford 
Motor Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford president Jac Nasser on Wednesday would not confirm or deny  
a German news report that the Detroit automaker was about to hire 
former BMW board member Wolfgang Reitzle. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Wolfgang is a tremendous executive and leader,''  
Nasser told reporters during the media preview of the Chicago Auto 
Show. ``I'm sad that he's in the situation that he's in. That's 
something for him and the board of BMW to work out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reitzle, who had once been considered the next in line to head  
BMW, resigned Friday in a management shakeup that also resulted in 
Chairman Bernd Pischetsrieder's ouster. The German news agency VWD 
reported that Ford would hire Reitzle as head of global 
development. 
</P>
<P>
	BMW also declined to comment on the report, attributed to  
unidentified sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Reitzle headed markets and product development for BMW, a maker  
of high-performance sports and luxury cars. His hiring by Ford 
would be a coup for the world's No. 2 automaker as it tries to 
strengthen its market position in Europe and elsewhere in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's shakeup led to widespread industry speculation that the  
company is seeking a change in direction that might include a 
merger or acquisition by a larger automaker like Ford or General 
Motors Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasser dismissed that speculation.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's not the way I read it. I read it as (the board) really  
trying to change what's happened rather than to change what could 
happen. I think it's a reflection of the Rover difficulties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute that led to Pischetsrieder's departure was over  
BMW's strategy for turning around its money-losing Rover unit in 
Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, they're going through a very difficult process,''  
Nasser said. ``The Rover acquisition has been a tremendous 
digestive problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When asked what he would do to correct Rover's problems, Nasser  
was coy. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the reasons we're valued as a great partner is because  
I think we do have the answers to those questions,'' he said. 
``It's a very, very sensitive issue. It's obviously got government 
and union and management and pride associated with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford, flush with $24 billion in cash, recently announced plans  
to buy Sweden's Volvo AB for $6.5 billion. The deal is awaiting 
Volvo shareholder approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasser said he has not talked to BMW or the Quandt family, which  
owns 42 percent of the company and would have to approve any deal 
with another automaker. But he noted that Ford is open to any 
overtures. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't rule out anybody,'' Nasser said. ``But I think when  
a company with the stature of BMW and their board come out and say 
they want to be independent, you have to respect that.

<HEADLINE> Seattle Names New Schools Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The city school board has named a former deputy  
as replacement for John Stanford, the Seattle school superintendent 
whose ``love 'em and lead 'em'' philosophy had him signing 
autographs in schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The board voted 6-1 on Tuesday to name Joseph Olchefske, 40,  
acting superintendent since June, to the top job. Stanford, a 
former Army major general with no background in education who 
brought a no-nonsense approach to the superintendent's job, died of 
leukemia in November. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had trouble not having a few tears up there, wishing John  
were here,'' said Olchefske. ``It's a bittersweet moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stanford was credited with improving test scores, increasing  
enrollment and boosting community interest in education during his 
3 1/2-year tenure. 
</P>
<P>
	Olchefske hugged his 4-year-old daughter and promised to  
continue to work for better education for the city's 47,600 public 
school students. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a lot of work to do. We are in fact far from done,''  
Olchefske said. ``I want a great school system for my daughter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olchefske was hired by Stanford as chief financial officer in  
1995. Like Stanford, he came from another field; he had had a 
15-year career in at a brokerage firm, specializing in 
public-sector financing. In choosing him as superintendent, the 
board opted not to conduct a nationwide search for a new 
superintendent and dropped a widely criticized proposal to split 
the job between two leaders, one academic and the other 
administrative.

<HEADLINE> Study Links Scars to Breast Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A microscopic change in breast tissue can help doctors predict  
whether a woman whose biopsy is benign may develop cancer later. 
</P>
<P>
	If the tissue has an abnormality called a radial scar, the woman  
is almost twice as likely to develop cancer, researchers in Boston 
found. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a microscope, normal breast tissue shows random clusters  
of ducts. Radial scars have a core of what appears to be scarred 
tissue surrounded by a cluster of ducts radiating outward. 
</P>
<P>
	Some studies found a link between radial scars and breast  
cancer; others were inconclusive. The latest study, conducted at 
Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Brigham and Women's 
Hospital in Boston and reported in Thursday's New England Journal 
of Medicine, is believed to be the largest so far. 
</P>
<P>
	It looked at 1,396 women with benign breast biopsies.  
Ninety-nine had radial scars. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly one-third -- 32 -- of the women with radial scars later  
developed breast cancer, compared with 223, or about one-fifth, of 
those without the abnormalities. 
</P>
<P>
	The risks were higher among women with more and larger radial  
scars.

<HEADLINE> Dow Gains 18 in Early Trading / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices have opened mixed. The Dow Jones  
industrial average is up 18 points in today's early going. Losers 
on the New York Stock Exchange hold an 8-7 lead over gainers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq Composite Index is up a point and the S&AMP;P 500 Index  
is up two points. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow has suffered declines in four straight sessions.  
</P>
<P>
	The recent declines have sent the blue-chip index into negative  
territory for 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	But it may be a little too soon to tell if the market is headed  
for a truly serious pattern of declines.

<HEADLINE> Martin To Team With Volunteer Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Every lap, pole and race Mark Martin wins  
this year on the NASCAR Winston Cup circuit will mean money in the 
bank for Big Brothers Big Sisters of America, under a partnership 
between the volunteer group, the driver and his sponsor Valvoline. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Caring Hands'' program was to be announced Thursday at a  
news conference in Daytona, Fla., site of Sunday's Daytona 500. 
</P>
<P>
	Working through 500 affiliate agencies around the country, Big  
Brothers Big Sisters matches adult volunteers with children growing 
up in single-family homes. The adults act as friends and mentors to 
the children. 
</P>
<P>
	Valvoline, based in Lexington, said it has set a goal of raising  
$1 million for Big Brothers Big Sisters and recruiting 10,000 new 
volunteer mentors through the partnership with Martin. The driver, 
who has been sponsored by Valvoline for a decade, was the runner-up 
to Jeff Gordon for last year's Winston Cup points championship. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to donations based on Martin's performance,  
Valvoline said it will donate $1 to Big Brothers Big Sisters for 
each NASCAR fan who puts handprints on a large canvas wall that 
will be displayed at 15 Winston Cup stops, and will encourage fans 
to match the donation. The trackside fund-raisers also will be a 
chance for local Big Brothers Big Sisters chapters to recruit 
volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
	Valvoline President James O'Brien is himself a Big Brother, and  
said he hopes the campaign will reduce the ranks of 35,000 young 
people currently waiting to be assigned Big Brothers and Big 
Sisters. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the help of Mark Martin and the generous support of  
NASCAR fans around the country, this program will make a huge 
difference in the lives of thousands of children,'' O'Brien said. 
``It's our hope that this alliance will inspire others to lend 
their time, talents and financial resources to Big Brothers Big 
Sisters of America and help us provide caring adult role models for 
every child that needs one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Brien was to kick off the campaign by presenting a $50,000  
check to Tom McKenna, national executive director of the 
Philadelphia-based organization, at Thursday's event at Daytona 
International Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	For each Winston Cup race Martin wins in 1999, Valvoline will  
donate $5,000. Each Martin pole will be worth $2,500 and each lap 
the driver leads will be worth $20. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, driving the Valvoline No. 6 car, Martin won eight  
Winston Cup races and three poles.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Ailing Banks To Get $66B </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The Japanese government will inject public funds  
worth almost $66 billion into 15 major banks as part of efforts to 
shore up the debt-ridden financial system, newspapers reported 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The government passed legislation last October allowing the use  
of taxpayers' money to bail out weak Japanese banks or help 
replenish capital reserves at healthier ones. 
</P>
<P>
	The Financial Restructuring Committee will formally notify the  
15 banks on Friday that their requests for public funds have been 
approved, major dailies including the Yomiuri Shimbun and the Asahi 
Shimbun reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The banks will receive the funds by the end of March, the  
reports said. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan is mired in its worst recession since World War II, as  
debt-ridden banks scale back on lending, starving companies of 
cash. 
</P>
<P>
	Many finance institutions are now struggling to write off  
massive bad loans left over from the collapse of Japan's ``bubble'' 
economy in the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee has asked the banks to carry out drastic  
restructuring, and some banks have reportedly been urged to 
restrict their activities to the domestic market. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the 15 banks, Fuji Bank Ltd. will get the largest amount  
of $8.85 billion, followed by Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd. with an 
injection of $7.96 billion, the newspapers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 15 banks also plan to strengthen their capital by issuing  
new stock totaling $15.04 billion, the reports said.

<HEADLINE> FAA, Pilots Reach Runway Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government, airlines and a pilots union  
have agreed to continue using, with some modifications, takeoff and 
landing rules designed to speed the flow of traffic at congested 
airports. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Aviation Administration, the Air Transport  
Association and the Air Line Pilots Association International 
announced Tuesday that they had worked out new terms for continuing 
``land-and-hold-short operations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The technique, under which a landing plane stops short of a  
runway intersection so another plane can simultaneously use the 
crossing runway for a takeoff, helps reduce airport delays. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot association's 50,000 members had threatened to quit  
agreeing to such landings on Feb. 19 without some revisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the terms of the agreement:  
</P>
<P>
	--Both sides agree that land-and-hold-short operations should not  
be tried when it's wet, despite previous tests. They will be 
reserved for dry runways only. 
</P>
<P>
	--Airports will install two sets of lights in intersecting  
runways to both warn pilots of the upcoming intersection and to 
then mark precisely where the runways cross. 
</P>
<P>
	--Pilots and air traffic controllers will receive new training in  
land-and-hold-short operations. 
</P>
<P>
	--Both sides have agreed to use more conservative figures for  
calculating which runways qualify for land-and-hold-short 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	--Both will study several runways where an in-flight collision  
could occur if a pilot who aborted a landing continued into the 
path of an airliner taking off on an intersecting runway. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are pleased that with this agreement, airline passengers  
can be assured that land-and-hold-short operations will now be 
performed with increased margins of safety,'' said Capt. Duane 
Woerth, president of the pilots' association. 
</P>
<P>
	FAA Administrator Jane Garvey added: ``The three parties worked  
closely together to identify and resolve issues with the first 
consideration always being safety.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If pilots had refused to participate in land-and-hold-short  
operations, air traffic controllers would have had to wait until a 
landing airliner had turned off a runway before giving takeoff 
clearance to a plane using an intersecting runway. 
</P>
<P>
	That would have created widespread flight delays and missed  
connections. American Airlines passengers are currently 
experiencing such repercussions as the airline's pilots stage a 
work slowdown to protest provisions of American's recent purchase 
of Reno Air. 
</P>
<P>
	Land-and-hold-short operations were begun in 1968. Since then,  
air traffic has increased dramatically. Takeoffs and landings alone 
have risen from 55.9 million in 1985 to 61.1 million in 1996. At 
the same time, there has been an increase in the number of 
intersecting runways. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, land-and-hold-short operations are permitted at 850  
runways in 220 airports around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	As airlines have pushed to improve their on-time performance,  
pilots have expressed concern about the practice. A National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration database on 
land-and-hold-short operations also shows at least 50 incidents 
since 1996.

<HEADLINE> Japan Argues Over Economic Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's central bank is being urged by the prime  
minister to buy government bonds to keep a rise in long-term 
interest rates from choking off an economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	``This possible action by the Bank of Japan is one option which  
we have to consider seriously,'' Akitaka Saiki, a spokesman for 
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of Japan, which so far has rejected such proposals as  
inflationary, has another policy-setting meeting Friday. Its chief, 
Masaru Hayami, is reported to have told Parliament on Tuesday that 
the central bank has no intention of changing its basic policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration's comments Wednesday, expressing frustration  
at the Bank of Japan's stance, highlighted a growing struggle 
between Obuchi's administration and the central bank over how to 
save Japan's ailing economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are strongly hoping that the Bank of Japan will try to  
coordinate with the government's fiscal policy,'' Saiki said. 
</P>
<P>
	Interest rates have risen sharply in recent months on worries  
the government will flood the market with new bonds to finance 
increased public works spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Obuchi's government set aside a total of 84 trillion yen, or  
$728.5 billion at current exchange rates, late last year to fix 
troubled banks and kickstart growth through public investment and 
tax breaks. 
</P>
<P>
	The subsequent increase in government debt has sent bond prices  
plummeting and driven up interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose  
to 2.065 percent Wednesday from 1.985 percent a day earlier. The 
rate had dropped as low as 0.7 percent last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Rising borrowing costs could drag down corporate earnings and  
threaten to prolong Japan's worst postwar recession. 
</P>
<P>
	Obuchi's government wants the Bank of Japan to buy bonds, which  
would likely drive up prices and bring interest rates back down. 
</P>
<P>
	But by purchasing its own bonds, the government would be  
borrowing from itself -- and essentially printing more money, 
something the Bank of Japan fears will rekindle inflation.

<HEADLINE> Vet Dies Before Receiving Medal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- After weeks of anticipating a final high  
honor for enduring the horrors of infantry warfare, one of the last 
veterans of World War I joined the ranks of departed doughboys -- 
just two hours before an envoy arrived with France's most 
distinguished award: the Legion of Honor medal. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Fackler, 98, of Allentown died in a nursing home, his  
68-year-old son at his side, as relatives, friends and fellow 
veterans prepared to attend an award ceremony in the home's 
reception room. 
</P>
<P>
	``He missed it by two hours. He was waiting for it. I think it  
kept him going this long,'' son Bill Fackler said. ``It was a sad 
occasion. We had everything organized for that day. The 
presentation was to be at 2 p.m. He died at quarter to twelve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Fackler, who served in the Meuse-Argonne offensive of  
September 1918, had been named a Chevalier of the National Order of 
the Legion of Honor by the president of France. That nation decided 
last year on the 80th anniversary of the 1918 armistice to honor 
Allied soldiers who fought in France. 
</P>
<P>
	Among ``a bunch of medals'' he had received, Fackler considered  
the Purple Heart his highest honor. He was founder and past 
president of the Lehigh Valley chapter of the Military Order of the 
Purple Heart, his son said. 
</P>
<P>
	Before offensives were waged with electronics and long-range  
missiles, Charles Fackler's war was fought up close and on the 
ground, often with bayonets. He was wounded by bullets and shrapnel 
and gassed several times as he slogged through the fields and 
forests as part of the Army's Company D, 112th Regiment, 28th 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was called the Bucket of Blood. We survived like animals in  
the tall grass, weeds, bushes and the likes of that,'' he recalled 
in a September interview. ``My chest looks like a checkerboard with 
scars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fackler had said the French medal would be his next highest  
honor, according to his minister, the Rev. Walter Wagner, pastor of 
Christ Lutheran Church in Allentown. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was proudest of all of the Purple Heart, that he was  
wounded in the service of his country, trying to repel an aggressor 
and safeguard peace,'' Wagner said. ``In a sense, the French Legion 
of Honor would have been the obverse. On the other side, this was 
the French government saying to him `We recognize that, too.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Though a CAT scan in December showed cancer invading Fackler's  
stomach and liver and he had grown rapidly weaker, his son said, 
``He was waiting for this. We spoke of it many times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the old soldier slipped into a coma and died Jan. 21,  
family members, friends and fellow veterans were already en route 
to the Whitehall Township nursing home, and it was too late to call 
off the medal ceremony. Instead, it was turned into a memorial 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	``The consul from France was on his way from Washington with the  
medal. There were 60 or 65 veterans there, and friends. It turned 
out to be a very nice affair,'' Bill Fackler said Jan. 27. ``The 
individuals from the American Legion and Purple Heart got up and 
said a few words. It was a little emotional, to say the least.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly afterward, members of Fackler's veterans' groups --  
Purple Heart, American Legion Post 576, Veterans of Foreign Wars 
Post 13, and Disabled American Veterans -- gathered again at 
Allentown's Greenwood Cemetery for a funeral. 
</P>
<P>
	Fackler had a soldier's sendoff. A bugler played taps and a  
rifle brigade fired a salute. Fellow veterans folded the flag that 
draped his casket and presented it to his son. 
</P>
<P>
	``He must be smiling down on us,'' Bill Fackler said. Though  
none of the veterans was old enough to remember World War I, he 
said, ``They were all buddies of his. They all loved him. A couple 
of the fellows, they just broke down emotionally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Fackler wore the Legion of Honor for his funeral. Then,  
like the flag, it went to his son. ``I kept it. We didn't bury it 
with him. It is beautiful,'' Bill Fackler said.

<HEADLINE> Browns Can Lure Free Agents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Dwight Clark remembers what happened the last  
time expansion teams were turned loose with pockets full of cash in 
the NFL's free-agent market. 
</P>
<P>
	``They blew us out of the water,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Clark, now the Cleveland Browns' director of football  
operations, was in the San Francisco 49ers' front office in 1995 
when both Carolina and Jacksonville were new to the league. 
</P>
<P>
	After picking the players they wanted in the expansion draft, it  
was time for the Panthers and Jaguars to go free-agent shopping. 
And because they weren't saddled down with any hefty player 
contracts, the two teams could spend, spend, spend. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were out of cap room and couldn't compete with them,''  
Clark said. ``The expansion guys came in with suitcases full and 
took a few guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Clark will get a chance to lure big-name free agents to  
Cleveland, filling out the blanks on fat checks with Browns owner 
Al Lerner's signature on them. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a bad feeling,'' Clark said. ``We have a lot of holes  
to fill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clark said that last week before the Browns added 37 more  
players to their roster in Tuesday's expansion draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Using a philosophy of picking young, inexpensive players with  
long-term potential, the Browns spent just more than $18 million on 
players who will count against their $57.2 million salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
	That means there's nearly $40 million in the Cleveland kitty to  
use on free-agent signing and for rookies taken in April's college 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we're looking to bring aboard any significant player who  
can have a major impact on the team,'' Browns president Carmen 
Policy said. ``And a major impact on the team going beyond 1999. We 
should have a tidy sum available for free agents. Neither cap space 
nor cash should be an impediment to our going forward in free 
agency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The free-agent signing period begins Friday and runs through  
July 15. Before Friday, the other 30 NFL teams are scrambling to 
get under the cap by trimming their payrolls. Some are 
renegotiating players' contracts with the purpose of avoiding the 
loss of players they want to keep to the Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	Some teams have only a few million to cut, others like the  
49ers, are more than $10 million over the cap. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland loaded up on offensive lineman (10) and defensive  
backs (9) in the expansion draft, making it likely they'll spend 
their money on skill players in free agency and the college draft. 
The Browns only took one quarterback -- Tampa Bay's Scott Milanovich 
-- and just four running backs. 
</P>
<P>
	But Browns coach Chris Palmer indicated the club might fill some  
other holes not plugged in the expansion draft first. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have a left tackle on the offensive line,'' he said.  
``We need a pass rusher defensive end, and we need a cover 
cornerback.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Depending on who is still available by Friday, it appears the  
deepest position for quality free agents for Cleveland to choose 
from will be wide receivers. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the biggest-named ones on the market are Arizona's Rob  
Moore, Green Bay's Antonio Freeman, New Orleans' Sean Dawkins, 
Pittsburgh's Charles Johnson, and San Francisco's J.J. Stokes. 
</P>
<P>
	Stokes, who caught 63 passes for 770 yards and eight TDs last  
season, would feel right at home in Cleveland with Clark and 
Policy. Before the '95 college draft, the two traded the 49ers' No. 
30 pick to Cleveland for the Browns' No. 10 pick and used it to 
take Stokes. 
</P>
<P>
	Another 49ers' wideout, Terrell Owens, is a restricted free  
agent and could also wind up in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns might also be able to find a free-agent quarterback  
or two through free agency. Kansas City's Rich Gannon, St. Louis' 
Steve Bono, New Orleans' Kerry Collins, Tampa Bay's Steve Walsh and 
Washington's Trent Green are currently set to be out there. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the hot rumors circulating around the expansion draft was  
Cleveland's interest in Green. 
</P>
<P>
	Green, who will be 29 in July, went from a career third-stringer  
to starter this season. If the Browns to decide to go after him, 
they could lean toward taking Texas running back Rikcy Williams 
with the No. 1 overall pick in the college draft.

<HEADLINE> Stuck Cargo Ship To Be Burned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COOS BAY, Ore. (AP) -- Faced with an approaching storm that  
threatened to break up a stuck cargo ship, authorities decided 
today that setting the ship and its fuel on fire was the only way 
to save beaches from a spill of nearly 400,000 gallons of oil. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to burn the ship was made by a unified command of  
Coast Guard, state and federal authorities after it became clear 
that they could not remove the 639-foot New Carissa intact -- 
already leaking fuel that has fouled several miles of beaches -- 
before the a series of storms hit this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	The ship, owned by a Japanese company, registered in Panama and  
staffed with a Filipino crew of 23, ran aground Thursday morning 
just 450 feet offshore as it waited to come into port to pick up a 
load of wood chips. Its crew was removed by the Coast Guard on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The discovery that some of the ship's fuel tanks were leaking  
changed the Coast Guard's priority Monday from protecting the ship 
to protecting miles of environmentally sensitive beaches. The ship 
is aground in an area known as the Leberti Hole, considered a prime 
crab-fishing area. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities had been preparing to try to pull the ship free,  
which would have enabled it to be towed in and repaired, until the 
approaching storm changed their plans. Now, the ship will be a 
total loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are significantly concerned the ship will not stay  
together,'' Coast Guard Capt. Mike Hall said today. ``We're between 
a rock and a hard spot. If we don't do something now we would have 
to stand before you and tell you why we let 400,000 gallons of oil 
spill on our beaches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Navy explosives experts flew in today and were preparing the  
ship for burning. Plans call for removing huge cargo hatches on the 
deck and using small shaped charges to crack open the fuel tanks, 
allowing the fuel to burn more freely. The fire will be ignited 
with 5-gallon buckets of gasoline and incendiary grenades that 
reach temperatures of 1,800 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said this kind of burning of the heavy, tarlike  
bunker fuel would a controlled burn, not an explosion, and less 
risky to the environment than pumping the fuel off the ship. The 
burn could take a couple of days. 
</P>
<P>
	``The goal is to keep the fuel within the skin of the ship,''  
Hall said. ``We think the storm will help us as it feeds the 
oxygen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Already, three of the ship's five tanks, containing 140,000  
gallons, have ruptured, streaking oil along six miles of beaches. 
Several birds have been found coated with fuel in the area, which 
is near the habitat of the Western snowy plover, a threatened 
species of shore bird. 
</P>
<P>
	About 200 people have been mobilized to clean up the gooey  
residue. Workers in yellow slickers and orange hardhats used rakes, 
shovels and absorbent material known as pompoms to gather up the 
oil and put it in clear plastic bags for disposal. Front loaders 
gathered up oily driftwood.

<HEADLINE>  American Airlines Seeks Court Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- American Airlines asked a federal judge today to  
order its pilots to stop calling in sick in a dispute that forced 
the carrier to cancel 900 more flights today. 
</P>
<P>
	AMR Corp., the airline's parent company, asked U.S. District  
Judge Joe Kendall for a temporary restraining order and asked that 
the pilots be held in contempt of court if they continued to call 
in sick. 
</P>
<P>
	Airline attorney Dee Kelly also asked for damages, saying that  
the airline is losing money every day the ``sick out'' continues. 
``They're threatening to bring the airline to a complete halt,'' 
Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate reaction from the pilots' union.  
</P>
<P>
	The latest strife between American and its pilots -- which has  
resulted in travel delays for more than 200,000 passengers -- has 
now grounded about than 2,500 flights since Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Talks stalled last Friday in a dispute over when pilots from the  
recently acquired Reno Air would be upgraded to the pay scale 
received by American's pilots. The next day, many American pilots 
began calling in sick and refusing to fly voluntary overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of cancellations has escalated each day, with more  
than 800, or about 37 percent, of the airline's flights knocked off 
Tuesday's schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations have begun anew and were scheduled to continue  
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the purchase of Reno is the source of this dispute, ill  
will between the pilots and the company has been festering for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early 1990s in an attempt to stem losses, American  
Airlines closed three hubs and furloughed 610 pilots, while at the 
same time leasing its empty airport gates to Reno Air and Midway 
Airlines Inc. and selling frequent-flier miles on the smaller 
carriers.

	American pilots saw the move as a way to shift work to their  
lower-paid counterparts at the smaller airlines. The distrust was 
highlighted by jokes among crew members that AMR stood for 
``American, Midway, Reno.''

<P>
	``I think that this is a confrontation that has its roots in

<HEADLINE>  American Airlines Seeks Court Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- American Airlines asked a federal judge today to  
order its pilots to stop calling in sick in a dispute that forced 
the carrier to cancel 900 more flights today. 
</P>
<P>
	AMR Corp., the airline's parent company, asked U.S. District  
Judge Joe Kendall for a temporary restraining order and asked that 
the pilots be held in contempt of court if they continued to call 
in sick. 
</P>
<P>
	Airline attorney Dee Kelly also asked for damages, saying that  
the airline is losing money every day the ``sick out'' continues. 
``They're threatening to bring the airline to a complete halt,'' 
Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate reaction from the pilots' union.  
</P>
<P>
	The latest strife between American and its pilots -- which has  
resulted in travel delays for more than 200,000 passengers -- has 
now grounded about than 2,500 flights since Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Talks stalled last Friday in a dispute over when pilots from the  
recently acquired Reno Air would be upgraded to the pay scale 
received by American's pilots. The next day, many American pilots 
began calling in sick and refusing to fly voluntary overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of cancellations has escalated each day, with more  
than 800, or about 37 percent, of the airline's flights knocked off 
Tuesday's schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations have begun anew and were scheduled to continue  
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the purchase of Reno is the source of this dispute, ill  
will between the pilots and the company has been festering for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early 1990s in an attempt to stem losses, American  
Airlines closed three hubs and furloughed 610 pilots, while at the 
same time leasing its empty airport gates to Reno Air and Midway 
Airlines Inc. and selling frequent-flier miles on the smaller 
carriers. 
</P>
<P>
	American pilots saw the move as a way to shift work to their  
lower-paid counterparts at the smaller airlines. The distrust was

<HEADLINE> U.S. Opposes Aircraft Engine Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The European Parliament favors a set of new  
aircraft engine rules, but the United States says they would harm 
U.S. air carriers and trample on existing international guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	One proposed rule, expected to be adopted today during a meeting  
of the European equivalent of Congress, would prohibit the 
registration in Europe of aircraft with ``hush kits'' after April 
1. The Europeans complain that the kits, which are installed on 
engines and act as mufflers, quiet aircraft but do not diminish 
their pollution. 
</P>
<P>
	Another element would ban aircraft that have hush kits and are  
registered elsewhere from flying in European skies as of April 1, 
2002, unless they were operating in the European Union before April 
1, 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``A thorough analysis of the situation shows that hush-kitted  
aircraft perform worse than current production airplanes in terms 
of fuel burn and air pollution,'' the European Union said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials and U.S. airlines object for a variety of  
reasons, including the claim that the European Union is attempting 
to spur sales by Airbus Industries, the European airplane 
consortium. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Airbus itself opposes the E.U. rules.  
</P>
<P>
	``We like to think of ourselves as rational people, and we're  
not going to stand up and punch our customers in the eye,'' said 
company spokesman David Venz. 
</P>
<P>
	Carriers such as Northwest Airlines and FedEx, which have a  
higher percentage of old planes in their fleets, say the rules 
could inhibit their operations in Europe. They also say the rules 
would sharply devalue older U.S. jets, which are often retired and 
sold in Europe, Africa and Asia, because they would no longer be 
operable in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. airlines are buying hundreds of new planes and installing  
hush kits on older models because the federal government has 
required that all jets operating in the country meet more stringent 
noise standards known as Stage 3 as of Jan. 1, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar worldwide requirement goes into effect April 1, 2002.  
That standard was adopted by the International Civil Aviation 
Organization, a United Nations-based group that works to bring 
uniformity to global aviation rules. Both the United States and the 
European Union are members of the group. 
</P>
<P>
	``We share concerns regarding noise at all airports, and believe  
that the proper approach for addressing those concerns is within 
the ICAO process, not through unilateral adoption of a design 
standard which disregards actual performance,'' said a letter sent 
to the European Union by Commerce Secretary William M. Daley, U.S. 
Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky and Transportation 
Secretary Rodney Slater. 
</P>
<P>
	European officials believe the United States is trying to  
sidestep efforts to clean up the air by using methods that extend 
the service life of planes whose signature is dark, belching smoke. 
</P>
<P>
	``The hush kit approach is clearly in the U.S. interest,'' said  
the E.U. statement. ``All manufacturers of hush kits are U.S.-based 
companies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Aaron, undersecretary of commerce for international trade,  
told reporters that if the Europeans proceed, ``this will not go 
unanswered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the United States wants more time to discuss the rules,  
with some discussion during a meeting with E.U. officials in 
mid-March. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to have these consultations while we've got a  
gun pointed at our heads,'' Aaron said.

<HEADLINE> Knicks Face Wizards Without Spree </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Now that they've lost Latrell Sprewell, the new  
Knicks will start looking more like the old Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	Kurt Thomas and Marcus Camby will fill the role formerly  
occupied by Charles Oakley, and Dennis Scott will do his best to be 
a latter-day John Starks, or Chris Mills. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the bad thing about this, we traded two guys who came  
off the bench last year who were pretty good shooters and 
scorers,'' Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy said Wednesday as his team 
prepared to play the Washington Wizards. ``Our strength is going to 
have to be things that can be consistent every night -- defense and 
rebounding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Off to an 0-2 start when Sprewell was healthy, New York now must  
get through the next 3-6 weeks without him. 
</P>
<P>
	That should mean more of the old style offense -- dumping the  
ball inside to Patrick Ewing or Larry Johnson and letting Allan 
Houston score from the perimeter. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas, a power forward, replaced Sprewell in the starting  
lineup against the Wizards, and Larry Johnson moved from power 
forward to small forward -- the spot Sprewell was playing. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell, who has a slight stress fracture of the right heel,  
will rest the injury for three weeks before it is reevaluated. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is my first injury ever,'' Sprewell said, adding that it  
wouldn't have kept him from playing if this was playoff time. 
``With the way the fans have accepted me, I almost feel I'm letting 
them down, so it's more disappointing than frustrating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas, signed as a free agent during training camp, has been  
ahead of Camby on the depth chart since the day he arrived. Not as 
good of a jump shooter or foul shooter as Oakley, Thomas 
nonetheless should be able to provide the rebounding Oakley 
contributed before he was traded last summer for Camby. 
</P>
<P>
	Camby's work ethic and conditioning were criticized during  
training camp by his teammates and coach, and he played only six 
minutes in New York's first two games and did not score. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not a big, strong physical type of defensive team,'' Van  
Gundy said, ``but you can still be a good defensive team without as 
many physical players if you still have a presence in the lane. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's why I've been a little disappointed that we haven't  
made it known that the lane is ours,'' Van Gundy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott, who reported to camp somewhat out of shape, played seven  
minutes in New York's season-opener and did not score. He and Chris 
Childs will now be counted on to be the Knicks' primary scorers off 
the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully I can come off the bench and start popping shots  
(like Starks) and the crowd will fall in love with me,'' Scott 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	After playing Thursday at Chicago, the Knicks will be off until  
Monday.

<HEADLINE> Skater Hughes Hopes To Catch Kwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Michelle Kwan is nowhere near ready to get  
off the medals podium, yet people are already trying to crown her 
successor. 
</P>
<P>
	Consider Sarah Hughes. She has athletic ability and a budding  
gracefulness, not to mention a couple of impressive titles. She 
just might have what it takes. 
</P>
<P>
	But hold on a second, Hughes and coach Robin Wagner warn -- the  
kid is only 13. This is her first trip to the U.S. Figure Skating 
Championships as a senior. Don't push her onto any podiums, they 
say. She's not ready yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is really just the start for her, it's the development  
I'm looking for,'' Wagner said. ``You can't reach too far too soon. 
It's got to be a comfortable process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The women's competition begins Thursday with the short program,  
and Kwan is the overwhelming favorite to win her third U.S. crown. 
But after Kwan, second and third place are wide open. Nicole Bobek, 
the 1995 U.S. champion, has endometriosis and withdrew last 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	That leaves Angela Nikodinov and Amber Corwin, fifth and sixth  
at nationals last year. Or Brittney McConn, who was fourth at the 
1998 World Junior Championships. Or Naomi Nari Nam, a sprite who's 
zoomed through the novice and junior ranks. 
</P>
<P>
	Or how about Hughes, who won the U.S. junior title last year and  
finished second at the junior worlds in November? 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't go out with such high expectations or else you're  
going to kill yourself with putting pressure on yourself,'' she 
said. ``I'm just going to go out and treat it like any other 
competition. You can't look at a competition and say, `Oh, my gosh, 
it's the world juniors!' Or, `Oh, my gosh, it's senior nationals!' 
</P>
<P>
	``You just go out and do what you can do because that's all you  
have control over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That philosophy has worked pretty well for Hughes. The fourth of  
sixth children, she took up skating to tag along with her older 
brothers and sister. Their father played hockey at Cornell, and he 
introduced his children to the ice early. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just followed them,'' Hughes said, shrugging. ``I'd skate  
and chase them around the rink.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wagner began working with Hughes four years ago and immediately  
saw she had the athletic ability to be a good jumper. But she also 
had a delicate presence on the ice -- a combination that's made Kwan 
one of the most successful and popular skaters ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes' breakthrough came last season, when she won three of  
four competitions. 
</P>
<P>
	``When she won juniors last year, I thought, `OK, she's taken  
that first, actually small step.' Then when she was second at 
junior worlds, I said, `Now she's taken that second step,''' Wagner 
said. ``Juniors is really just the beginning. Her winning juniors 
put her into the arena where she can really further her career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Wagner wants to make sure Hughes develops the right way.  
Countless skaters have risen too far too fast and burned out. And 
when Tara Lipinski vaulted to the top of the senior ranks as a 
14-year-old, she was picked on for wearing costumes and skating to 
music that emphasized her youth. 
</P>
<P>
	So Wagner is walking a fine line. Hughes' short program is to  
Chopin's ``Fantasy Impromptu'' and her free skate is excerpts from 
``Swan Lake.'' Both programs are elegant and showcase her improving 
artistic ability, yet they're appropriate for a 13-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
	``She is so young that I didn't want to do anything that was  
extremely passionate or deep in emotion and yet,'' Wagner said. 
``Those are two pieces of music that, as a young skater, she could 
interpret and feel comfortable skating to, and still grow with 
throughout the year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grow into another Kwan? If not quite yet, perhaps someday.

<HEADLINE> Customs Dept. Halts Computer Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- A 24-hour shutdown of U.S. Customs Service  
computers in the Houston area has been postponed after an outcry by 
local officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The drill at the Port of Houston, the largest port in the nation  
in movement of foreign cargo and the second largest in total 
tonnage, had been scheduled for today. 
</P>
<P>
	The drill was supposed to show how 200 importers, customhouse  
brokers and freight forwarders would do if they were forced to get 
by without customs computers for a day -- and rely on pen and paper. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is meant to be a constructive exercise that everybody  
learns from in a positive way,'' said Customs spokesman Dennis 
Murphy in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Port officials felt different about the drill. They said a  
computer crash, simulated or not, would have meant major delays at 
the area's ports and at Bush Intercontinental Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	If just one ship laden with 5,000 tons of steel were delayed for  
a day, that could cost a shipper $60,000 in additional handling and 
storage fees, said Alistair McNab, executive vice president of the 
Greater Houston Port Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
	Customs officials said port officials will be told of a two-week  
window during which to expect the test when it is rescheduled.

<HEADLINE>  Sponsor Criticizes Olympic Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For the first time since the Salt Lake bribery  
scandal broke, criticism of Olympic leadership is coming from a key 
member of the tight-knit community that runs the games. 
</P>
<P>
	David D'Alessandro, the top official of Olympics sponsor John  
Hancock insurance, said Tuesday that the International Olympic 
Committee does not want to deal with the corruption case. 
D'Alessandro hinted that the IOC's president, Juan Antonio 
Samaranch, might be nearing the final days of his once-unchallenged 
reign. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still think Kenny Rogers said it best: `Know when to hold  
'em, know when to fold 'em, know when to walk away, know when to 
run,''' D'Alessandro said. ``I think Samaranch is getting close to 
the end of his `fold 'em' stage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president and chief operations officer of John Hancock said  
the IOC had become ``a cult of royals'' that was incapable of 
making the radical changes necessary to bounce back from the worst 
scandal in its history. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each day, the IOC loses a bit more credibility,'' he said.  
``It's clear the leaders of the IOC want to wake up, and this is 
all gone away and they have their club back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	D'Alessandro also said he was canceling negotiations with NBC  
for $20 million in ads to protest the IOC's failure to deal with 
the growing corruption scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to buy a nickel of advertising on NBC until we  
are confident the IOC is going in the right direction,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The move was meant to pressure the network, the single biggest  
revenue source for the IOC with a $3.57 billion rights contract, to 
try to convince the committee of the need for meaningful change. 
</P>
<P>
	``NBC tells them to change, you don't think the IOC will listen?  
What are they going to do, go find someone else?'' D'Alessandro 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC spokeswoman Maria Battaglia said the network was unaware of  
D'Alessandro's decision on the ads. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had no issues with other advertisers,'' she said.  
``We've continued to have tremendous interest in the Olympics and 
have closed major deals with several advertisers in the past few 
weeks. They've understood that the Olympics are about the games and 
the athletes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Lausanne, Switzerland, IOC marketing director Michael Payne  
downplayed the John Hancock move. 
</P>
<P>
	``They aren't withdrawing from their sponsorship,'' he said.  
``This issue is related to a media purchase which is separate from 
the sponsorship. ... The sponsors are standing, first of all, 
behind the games, and, second, behind the steps and action the IOC 
is taking'' to clean house. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Alessandro, whose company pays about $50 million to be the  
official life insurance and annuities sponsor of the Olympics and 
use the five-ring logo in its ads, said there have been only two 
high points for the IOC since the scandal broke in early December. 
</P>
<P>
	One, he said, was when vice president Dick Pound was appointed  
to investigate the Salt Lake allegations for the IOC ``instead of 
one of their ventriloquist dummies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The second, he continued, came when nine members of the IOC  
resigned or were expelled and Samaranch apologized for the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the first moment in which the sponsors correctly said,  
`Oh, he gets it,''' D'Alessandro said. ``You know what? That was 
the last moment when it could be correctly said, `Oh, he gets 
it.''' 
</P>
<P>
	For weeks, D'Alessandro has closed ranks with other sponsors and  
sports officials in defending Samaranch and the IOC, although 
warning that solid action was needed to save the value of the 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	But now, he said, he was putting together a plan to distance his  
company from the committee despite a contract that runs through the 
Sydney Games in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he has removed the Olympic rings from his company's  
annual report and from correspondence due to be sent out over the 
next few months. 
</P>
<P>
	The rings also have been removed from John Hancock billboards at  
Fenway Park in Boston and other stadiums and arenas, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to go to the expense of putting them back on,''  
he said. While the IOC contract offered no direct escape clause, 
``you don't have to promote it, you don't have to use the rings,'' 
D'Alessandro added. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said that if the rings become too devalued as an  
advertising tool, ``we would approach it as we would if we had 
bought the Olympic car. If that car does not operate properly and 
as expected, you no longer drive that car.''

all gone away and they have their club back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	D'Alessandro also said he was canceling negotiations with NBC  
for $20 million in ads to protest the IOC's failure to deal with 
the growing corruption scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to buy a nickel of advertising on NBC until we  
are confident the IOC is going in the right direction,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The move was meant to pressure the network, the single biggest  
revenue source for the IOC with a $3.57 billion rights contract, to 
try to convince the committee of the need for meaningful change. 
</P>
<P>
	``NBC tells them to change, you don't think the IOC will listen?  
What are they going to do, go find someone else?'' D'Alessandro 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC spokeswoman Maria Battaglia said the network was unaware of  
D'Alessandro's decision on the ads. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had no issues with other advertisers,'' she said.  
``We've continued to have tremendous interest in the Olympics and 
have closed major deals with several advertisers in the past few 
weeks. They've understood that the Olympics are about the games and 
the athletes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Lausanne, Switzerland, IOC marketing director Michael Payne  
downplayed the John Hancock move. 
</P>
<P>
	``They aren't withdrawing from their sponsorship,'' he said.  
``This issue is related to a media purchase which is separate from 
the sponsorship. ... The sponsors are standing, first of all, 
behind the games, and, second, behind the steps and action the IOC 
is taking'' to clean house. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Alessandro, whose company pays about $50 million to be the  
official life insurance and annuities sponsor of the Olympics and 
use the five-ring logo in its ads, said there have been only two 
high points for the IOC since the scandal broke in early December. 
</P>
<P>
	One, he said, was when vice president Dick Pound was appointed  
to investigate the Salt Lake allegations for the IOC ``instead of 
one of their ventriloquist dummies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The second, he continued, came when nine members of the IOC  
resigned or were expelled and Samaranch apologized for the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the first moment in which the sponsors correctly said,  
`Oh, he gets it,''' D'Alessandro said. ``You know what? That was 
the last moment when it could be correctly said, `Oh, he gets 
it.''' 
</P>
<P>
	For weeks, D'Alessandro has closed ranks with other sponsors and  
sports officials in defending Samaranch and the IOC, although 
warning that solid action was needed to save the value of the 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	But now, he said, he was putting together a plan to distance his  
company from the committee despite a contract that runs through the 
Sydney Games in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he has removed the Olympic rings from his company's  
annual report and from correspondence due to be sent out over the 
next few months. 
</P>
<P>
	The rings also have been removed from John Hancock billboards at  
Fenway Park in Boston and other stadiums and arenas, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to go to the expense of putting them back on,''  
he said. While the IOC contract offered no direct escape clause, 
``you don't have to promote it, you don't have to use the rings,'' 
D'Alessandro added. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said that if the rings become too devalued as an  
advertising tool, ``we would approach it as we would if we had 
bought the Olympic car. If that car does not operate properly and 
as expected, you no longer drive that car.''

<HEADLINE> Avis Suit Gets Class-Action Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A lawsuit by Jewish customers who say Avis  
Rent-a-Car denied them the benefits of corporate accounts has 
received class-action status, a federal judge ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit was filed on behalf of a Fort Lauderdale man and a  
Chicago bookstore affiliated with a yeshiva, a Jewish school. It 
alleges Avis denied corporate accounts to Jewish customers and 
labeled them with the code word ``yeshiva.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some were given so-called ``bogus'' accounts that carried  
reduced discounts, the suit claims. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge's ruling allows attorneys to represent the interests  
of the more than 10,000 Jewish customers who have been customers of 
Avis from 1993 to 1998, according to plaintiffs' attorney Tod 
Aronovitz. 
</P>
<P>
	Avis said it was attempting to flag unqualified drivers who  
posed as representatives of Jewish schools and the word yeshiva 
wasn't used in a derogatory way. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was used to talk about the problem we had become aware  
of,'' said Tony Fuller, a spokesman for Garden City, N.J.-based 
Avis. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 27-page order signed Monday, U.S. District Judge Alan Gold  
said that testimony from former Avis employees showed that 
``thousands of potential customers'' had been turned down after 
being identified with the code word. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is undisputed that Avis employed a 'yeshiva' policy and the  
'yeshiva' policy emanated from its World Reservations Center,'' the 
judge said in the order. 
</P>
<P>
	``The allegations of discrimination here are based on a  
documented company policy written by upper management at Avis' 
World Reservations Center, distributed to its employees by upper 
management -- and monitored by upper management'' at the center, 
Gold said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fuller said Avis would appeal to the U.S. Circuit Court of  
Appeals in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``We view it for our part as a procedural matter,'' Fuller said.  
``The judge didn't really address the merits of the case, and in 
fact, invited an early appeal on the ruling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Few complainants have stepped forward since the suit was filed  
in 1997, Fuller said.

<HEADLINE> USDA Almost Out of Loan Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A rush of farmers borrowing money to handle  
debt after a year of low prices has nearly depleted federal loan 
money, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency is preparing numbers to formally request additional  
money from Congress, Glickman told a Senate committee Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our funding will be exhausted in the next few weeks,''  
Glickman said. ``Demand is outrunning our funding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the agency has not decided how much money to request but  
said it may be as much as $100 million for loans, plus additional 
money to assist Puerto Rico, which was hit hard by Hurricane 
Georges last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Agency officials said they hoped to prepare paperwork to submit  
to the White House in the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers have been forced to seek more loans to restructure debt  
and jump-start their operations after a year in which prices in 
some sectors dipped to record lows. Hog farmers, for instance, saw 
prices drop as low as $8 a hundredweight in December. Grain farmers 
also had a bad price year. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are lines. There is a waiting period,'' Glickman said of  
the Farm Service Agency offices in various states that administer 
USDA loans. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, a coalition of farm groups wrote the Clinton  
administration and Congress warning them of the impending crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``The continuation of low prices for virtually all commodities  
and livestock -- as well as natural disaster which occurred in 1998 
-- has dramatically increased the demand for funding through 
guaranteed loan programs,'' the groups wrote. Many states have 
already depleted their allotment of funds, the groups said. 
</P>
<P>
	Demand has increased 26 percent for the guaranteed operating  
loan, 160 percent for the interest assistance program and 92 
percent for the guaranteed farm ownership program, the groups said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to make sure that every farmer and rancher that is  
having financial difficulties has access to the options that the 
guaranteed loan programs offer,'' the letter said.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Ccuts Sale of DBS stake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- Singapore today cut by more than a third the  
size of the stake in government-owned Development Bank of Singapore 
which it plans to sell. The amount was cut to $765 million because 
of lower than expected interest from investors. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we had received a greater demand, we would have done a  
larger transaction,'' Richard Gnodde, managing director at Goldman 
Sachs in Singapore, the bond's underwriter, said of the planned 
sale of part of Southeast Asia's largest bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The bond issue was expected to be $1.3 billion, with the option  
of expanding it to $1.6 billion, but early Wednesday the issue was 
reduced to $765 million, which Gnodde characterized later at a 
press conference as ``exactly the right size.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The $765 million issue was separated into three tranches: $350  
million, 350 million euros and 30 million Singapore dollars ($17.8 
million). The bonds are redeemable in 2004, but can be converted 
into DBS shares anytime after February 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Gnodde said the Singapore government decided to cut the size of  
the issue rather than the price. 
</P>
<P>
	In cutting the size, the government ``listened to what the  
market was telling'' it, Gnodde said. 
</P>
<P>
	The institutional tranches -- the euro- and U.S.  
dollar-denominated portions -- were fully subscribed by investors in 
the U.S., Europe and Asia, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that we were able to place out within 24 hours three  
quarters of a billion dollars is a significant transaction,'' 
Gnodde said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Investors will appreciate we didn't push out more.''

<HEADLINE> Magazine Criticized for Parody </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The sight of stubble-faced, blue-collar  
workers decked out in feathers and sequins and strutting to show 
tunes down Philadelphia's main boulevard could strike an outsider 
as odd. 
</P>
<P>
	Stranger still to many residents was Philadelphia magazine's  
parody detailing the secret life of a gay mummer, a thick-chested 
construction worker who lives for New Year's Day and the parade 
that allows him to dress up in sequined camouflage and show his 
true colors. 
</P>
<P>
	The satire flopped with most readers -- they didn't know it was a  
spoof. 
</P>
<P>
	Editor Eliot Kaplan has apologized for running the story. He  
said the story, published in January's issue, seemed so obvious it 
didn't need a disclaimer. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, Kaplan argued, mummers -- whose wilder-the-better  
costumes put them in competition for cash prizes in the nation's 
oldest New Year's Day parade -- traditionally are macho 364 days a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were attempting to do a satire,'' he said. ``A gay mummer --  
we thought it was preposterous. But maybe it was too real. When 
only 10 to 20 percent of the readers think it's fake ... it just 
didn't work. I have to apologize.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a lot of ways, the mummers' annual parade is like the Mardi  
Gras festival, with elaborate costumes, instruments and flamboyant 
routines. 
</P>
<P>
	Mummery dates to the 17th century when Europeans came to the New  
World with their holiday ritual of welcoming the New Year by 
masquerading, visiting friends and firing weapons into the air. 
Eventually the city put an end to the shooting and drunken revelry 
and began sponsoring an annual parade in 1901. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a spectacle -- men dressing like women, donning feathers and  
lace, sequins and satin, strutting several miles for all the world 
to see. 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine story chronicled the double life of Neil, just one  
of the guys as he cracked jokes and taught his buddies new dance 
steps, sewing Princess Leia costumes as needed. On the inside, Neil 
was a nervous wreck, fearing anything he said or did would give his 
secret away. 
</P>
<P>
	The hoax was uncovered by Philadelphia Daily News columnist Stu  
Bykofsky, who has been merciless in his criticism of the story. 
</P>
<P>
	He isn't alone in questioning the ethics of the spoof, which  
comes on the heels of a number of high-profile incidents last year 
in which journalists lost their jobs over fabricated stories and 
inaccuracies. 
</P>
<P>
	This story was particularly troublesome because it makes readers  
question whether stories are fact or fiction, said Joseph Turow, 
communications professor at the University of Pennsylvania's 
Annenberg School for Communications. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's obviously the appearance of a problem here when you're  
working with something so borderline as that. Subtle humor only 
implies fakery,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Duane Swierczynski, a Details magazine editor who penned the  
parody, said he wished he would have included more ``bombshell 
clues'' to make the story seem fake. 
</P>
<P>
	Mummers weren't happy to learn the piece wasn't real.  
</P>
<P>
	``There must be gay mummers,'' said Palma Lucas, director of the  
Philadelphia Mummers Museum. ``Gays are in every fabric of our 
lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his defense, Kaplan noted a Sports Illustrated April Fool's  
profile of a fictitious Buddhist-trained baseball pitcher who could 
throw a 168-mph fastball. 
</P>
<P>
	George Plimpton, author of the SI piece, said satire has its  
literary place. But in the case of the magazine's flopped spoof, 
Plimpton said the piece ``might have worked out better'' on April 
1.

<HEADLINE> Moore Prepares for 1st IROC Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Greg Moore quickly realized that  
virtually everything he's learned in CART is useless in the 
International Race of Champions Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of like taking Jeff Gordon and Dale Earnhardt and  
some of those other NASCAR guys to Milwaukee, putting them in a 
Champ car and saying, `Go out there and race.' They'd definitely 
find it real different,'' the 24-year-old Canadian said as he 
prepared for his first IROC appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Trickle, a stock car veteran and a coach for newcomers to  
the all-star series, gave Moore some advice last week before he 
first sat in one of the sleek IROC cars. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dick told me to remember that whatever you do in a Champ car,  
you have to do exactly the opposite in these cars,'' Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In CART, you always try to get in clean air. Here, you have to  
stay in the dirty air. And the drafting here is a lot different 
than on the ovals we run. You can't follow right behind somebody 
nose-to-tail in a Champ car.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the circumstances, the fact that there are eight NASCAR  
Winston Cup drivers in the IROC field makes it very difficult for 
the open-wheel stars to shine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I'm going to be learning the whole race on Friday,''  
Moore said. ``The best I can probably hope for is to finish in the 
top six and learn enough that I can be really competitive in the 
next race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dale Jarrett and Bobby Labonte, two of the Winston Cup drivers,  
drew the front-row positions for the 100-mile race at Daytona 
International Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never done very much in this series, so I'm just happy  
they invited me back,'' Jarrett said after the random draw on 
Wednesday to determine the lineup. ``I plan on winning my first one 
Friday so that I keep getting invited back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Labonte was added to the all-star field after CART star Al Unser  
Jr. withdrew because one of his children became ill. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hate to be here under these circumstances,'' he said. ``I'd  
rather make it into the series on Winston Cup points, but now that 
I'm here, I'm going to try to make the most of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IROC rookies Adrian Fernandez of CART and defending NASCAR Busch  
Series champion Dale Earnhardt Jr. will start from the second row, 
followed by another IROC rookie, 1998 Indianapolis 500 champion 
Eddie Cheever and seven-time Winston Cup champion Dale Earnhardt. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenny Brack, the Indy Racing League's defending champion, will  
start from the fourth row with former Winston Cup champion Rusty 
Wallace. 
</P>
<P>
	NASCAR's Jeff Burton and Moore drew the fifth-row spots, with  
two-time defending Winston Cup champion Jeff Gordon and three-time 
defending IROC champion and Winston Cup runner-up Mark Martin 
bringing up the rear. 
</P>
<P>
	``One good thing about starting last is that you can't finish  
any worse,'' Martin said. ``Actually, in these IROC races, that's 
not a real handicap. There's a lot of passing, especially here in 
Daytona.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IROC invitees race in cars that are supposed to be  
identically prepared. Martin was asked how he continues to dominate 
the series, in which he has won four of the last five titles? 
</P>
<P>
	``I've just been real lucky the last five years,'' he said. ``I  
hope it continues.''

<HEADLINE> Alcott, Daniel To Enter LPGA Hall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif. (AP) -- Amy Alcott was weary of hearing  
well-intentioned folks remind her of the one victory she's lacking 
to qualify for the LPGA Hall of Fame. She won't have to listen to 
it anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcott and Beth Daniel are in, thanks to a vote of tour players  
that softened the criteria for the toughest Hall of Fame in sports. 
Only 14 women had qualified since the hall was created in 1967. 
Betsy King was the last inductee in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've really kind of gotten tired of people telling me, even  
though it's out of the goodness of their heart, `Come on, Amy, you 
can win that one more,''' Alcott said. ``In my heart, I know I 
will. Being inducted into the Hall of Fame is not going to change 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The old rules required a player to have 30 victories, including  
two majors, or 35 victories with one major or 40 wins with no 
majors. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the previous system, Alcott's 29 wins left her one short  
of qualifying. Her last win came at the 1991 Dinah Shore, one of 
five major titles in a 24-year career. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have spent way too much time on the one Amy didn't get  
instead of celebrating the excellence of her 29 wins, including 
five major championships,'' Hall of Famer Pat Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel has 32 career victories, including one major since her  
1979 LPGA debut. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new rules, a player will have to win either a major  
championship, Vare Trophy for lowest scoring average or player of 
the year, and then have accumulated 27 points. Two points would be 
awarded for each major, with one point each for a victory, Vare 
Trophy or player of the year award. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes, 14 years in the making by the LPGA board of  
directors, won approval by 98 percent of the tour players in voting 
conducted Jan. 12 to Feb. 5, tour commissioner Jim Ritts announced 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm thrilled the criteria has been changed,'' Hall of Famer  
Patty Sheehan said. ``It lets the world know we finally have a 
respectable hall of fame.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alcott's and Daniel's first tournament as Hall of Famers will be  
the Valley of the Stars Championship beginning Friday at Oakmont 
Country Club in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the things that means the most to me is the fact that  
the current Hall of Famers all agree with this criteria,'' Daniel 
said. ``Had even one Hall of Famer not agreed with it, it wouldn't 
have meant quite as much to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new criteria, Alcott would have qualified for the Hall  
of Fame in 1985 by virtue of her 35 points, while Daniel would have 
made it in 1990 based on her 39 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want to have an asterisk by my name, saying she  
needed one more,'' Alcott said. ``I don't think one more win should 
mean anything. I've had a great career, I've known it in my own 
heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alcott will be inducted on March 22, along with Seve Ballesteros  
and Lloyd Mangrum, at the World Golf Hall of Fame in St. Augustine, 
Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel chose to wait until March 2000 for her induction.  
</P>
<P>
	``I felt March was too soon to get everything ready and my  
family ready,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other current players close to qualifying for the Hall of Fame  
are 1998 player of the year Annika Sorenstam (24 points), 
three-time U.S. Open winner Hollis Stacy (22 points) and Laura 
Davies (22 points). 
</P>
<P>
	The players also voted to establish a 12-person veterans  
committee to nominate one retired player for the Hall of Fame. 
However, no one will be inducted in the veterans category this year 
because the committee will not be named until the LPGA Championship 
in June. 
</P>
<P>
	The retired players most likely to be considered include Donna  
Caponi (20 wins, four majors), Marlene Hagge (24 wins, one major), 
Marilynn Smith (19 wins, two majors), Judy Rankin (26 wins), Sandra 
Palmer (17 wins, two majors), Jane Blalock (27 wins) and Ayako 
Okamoto (17 wins).

<HEADLINE> Pluto Again the Farthest Planet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Mere days after surviving attacks on its  
status as a planet, diminutive Pluto is resuming its traditional 
spot farthest from the sun. 
</P>
<P>
	Pluto was on course to cross the orbit of Neptune at 5:08 a.m.  
EST Thursday, NASA reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Normally the most distant planet from the sun, Pluto has a  
highly elliptical orbit that occasionally brings it inside the 
orbit of Neptune. 
</P>
<P>
	That last took place on Feb. 7, 1979, and since then Neptune had  
been the most distant planet. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Pluto once again becomes the farthest planet from the sun,  
where it will remain for 228 years. It takes Pluto 248 years to 
circle the sun. 
</P>
<P>
	Only last week the Paris-based International Astronomical Union,  
the world's leading astronomical organization, reaffirmed Pluto's 
standing as the smallest planet. 
</P>
<P>
	News reports had said Pluto might be demoted to a minor planet,  
or -- worse -- a trans-Neptunian Object. 
</P>
<P>
	``No proposal to change the status of Pluto as the ninth planet  
in the solar system has been made by any division, commission or 
working group of the IAU responsible for solar system science,'' 
said the 80-year-old organization, the final authority on 
astronomical matters. 
</P>
<P>
	While Pluto will cross Neptune's orbit, there is no worry about  
a collision, NASA reports. The two will actually be far apart at 
the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Pluto was discovered Feb. 18, 1930, by Clyde Tombaugh at Lowell  
Observatory in Flagstaff, Ariz. It's moon, Charon, was found in 
1979. 
</P>
<P>
	With a diameter of 1,430 miles, Pluto is less than half the size  
of any other planet and only two-thirds as big as Earth's moon.

<HEADLINE> Cousins Arrested After Swap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FITCHBURG, Mass. (AP) -- The Pridgen cousins were wanted men. It  
just took authorities a while to figure out where they were, 
accusing them of essentially swapping places as they hid with 
relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	They were in custody Wednesday and awaiting transfer back to  
their hometowns. Fitchburg police arrested John Pridgen of Georgia, 
and Georgia authorities picked up Satron Pridgen of Fitchburg. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's extremely unusual that we have members of the same family  
swapping places, being involved in crimes north and south of the 
Mason-Dixon Line,'' said Bucky Burnsed, a spokesman for the police 
in Savannah, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	John Pridgen, 22, is a suspect in the Nov. 30 shooting death of  
Khalif McLeod as the victim rode a bike on a street in Savannah. 
Police believe the killing stemmed from a gang turf war. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Satron Pridgen, 20, was being sought after an attack  
at an Oct. 25 party in Fitchburg. The victim, a 38-year-old man, 
was shot in the face but survived. 
</P>
<P>
	Satron Pridgen was arrested Feb. 4 in Pembroke, Ga., where his  
mother owns a mobile home. John Pridgen was arrested Jan. 20 in a 
Fitchburg apartment after Savannah police received a tip and 
relayed it to Massachusetts authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear Wednesday who the attorneys for the two men were.

	3 GOP Senators Say They'll Acquit  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After two days of closed-door deliberations,  
three Republican senators are declaring they'll vote to acquit 
President Clinton on both articles of impeachment, the clearest 
sign yet that the vote to convict him will fall far short of the 
needed two-thirds majority. Sens. James Jeffords of Vermont, Arlen 
Specter of Pennsylvania and John Chafee of Rhode Island -- moderate 
lawmakers from the Northeast -- were the first Republicans to 
announce opposition to both articles, perjury and obstruction of 
justice in the Monica Lewinsky affair.

	300 Missing After Ship Sinks  
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Rescue teams searched in vain  
Wednesday for more survivors from a passenger ship that sank with 
332 people aboard between the Indonesian islands of Borneo and 
Sumatra. So far, 19 people have been rescued and one body has been 
found since the boat went down Sunday, officials said. Rescue teams 
re continuing their search, but with no new survivors found in the 
past 24 hours, hopes are fading. The leaky motorized sailing ship, 
was licensed to carry cargo but not passengers, officials and news 
reports are saying.

	Christian Coalition Changes Chief  
</P>
<P>
	CHESAPEAKE, Va. (AP) -- Christian Coalition founder Pat Robertson  
has reassumed the presidency of the political organization after 
spending several years as a senior adviser, a spokeswoman said. 
Robertson angered some conservative leaders, including 
just-departed president Don Hodel, when he said last month that 
President Clinton had won the public relations battle and the 
Senate should end the impeachment trial. The coalition is in the 
midst of efforts to defend its own past political activities. The 
FEC has sued the coalition, accusing it of illegally spending 
thousands of dollars to promote Republican candidates.

	Attempts To Set Ore. Ship Afire Fail  
</P>
<P>
	COOS BAY, Ore. (AP) -- Navy demolition experts with grenades  
failed to set fire to a grounded cargo ship Wednesday night, 
leaving it vulnerable to an advancing storm that threatened to 
break it apart and cause a disastrous oil spill. Flames flickered 
and black smoke billowed out of the New Carissa, but within seconds 
the only thing burning aboard the 639-foot ship was a small 
smoldering fire in one cargo hold. Coast Guard officials had said 
that burning the ship could be like lighting a barbecue grill -- it 
could take several tries to get the heavy, low-grade oil to burn.

	Colombia Peace Talks Stall

<P>
	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Two days of talks between Colombian  
rebels and that country's presidential peace envoy concluded 
Wednesday with no breakthrough on ending a 34-year civil war, but 
both sides agreed to keep working towards a political solution, an 
envoy said. Victor Ricardo said discussions between himself and the 
National Liberation Army, Colombia's second largest guerrilla 
group, focused on establishing direct dialogue, ``humanizing'' the 
conflict and possible formal peace talks. The two sides agreed to 
meet again in Caracas in the next few days to try to advance the 
talks.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Philanthropist Paul Mellon has bequeathed the  
largest gift ever to the National Gallery of Art -- $75 million and 
a collection of more than 100 works of art, including paintings by 
Vincent van Gogh, Claude Monet and Winslow Homer. The donations by 
Mellon, who died Feb. 1 at the age of 91, were enumerated in his 
will filed Wednesday. Mellon had already given more than 900 works 
to the museum, but his last gift is ``the largest in the gallery's 
history,'' the museum director, Earl A. Powell III, told The 
Washington Post.

Nnamaka's three-point play with 39 seconds left broke a 54-54 tie 
and his free throw with 9.1 seconds left provided the final margin.

Trail Blazers defeated the Indiana Pacers 100-92 Wednesday night. 
The last time the teams met, on Feb. 27, 1998 in Indianapolis, the 
Pacers humiliated the Blazers 124-59. It was Portland's worst loss 
ever and the first time in NBA history a team has doubled the score 
of an opponent.

<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Don't expect races in this town to be  
run anywhere but at Daytona International Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	The renaming of Charlotte Motor Speedway to Lowe's Motor  
Speedway in a $35 million, 10-year deal won't be duplicated at 
Daytona, says Bill France, chairman of International Speedway Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not looking at anything like that,'' France said.  
``Daytona's sort of a unique name. Do you change the name of the 
Kentucky Derby? Do you change the name of The Masters?'' 
</P>
<P>
	France, also president of NASCAR, announced Wednesday that he is  
relinquishing control of day-to-day operations to new senior vice 
president Mike Helton. 
</P>
<P>
	The 66-year-old France said he wouldn't judge Speedway  
Motorsports Inc., the parent of company of the Charlotte track, but 
added that naming rights can be sold to virtually anything. 
</P>
<P>
	``We could name every grandstand here after some company,'' he  
said. ``We could name the garages out there after some mechanics or 
companies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although he said there were no plans to sell naming rights for  
Daytona, Darlington Raceway, Talladega Superspeedway or any other 
ISC tracks, France did not rule it out. 
</P>
<P>
	``If someone paid you $500 million, would you change it?'' he  
asked. ``Someday, you might have to. It depends on your need for 
revenue.''

	 *SICK DAUGHTER:* Al Unser Jr.'s 12-year-old daughter was  
diagnosed Wednesday with a rare condition that has paralyzed her 
legs. 
</P>
<P>
	Cody Unser, one of four Unser children, was hospitalized after  
falling ill during a school basketball game on Friday in 
Albuquerque, N.M., where the family lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Edward Benzel at the New Mexico Health Sciences Center said  
Wednesday that Cody has transverse myelitis, which causes an 
inflammation of the spinal cord. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not clear how she got sick, but it might have been the  
result of a viral infection, he said. It also was unclear how soon 
she would get better. 
</P>
<P>
	``Recovery is cautiously accepted and can be seen within two  
weeks or after a year or more,'' Benzel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cody will be transferred to a rehab center within a week.  
</P>
<P>
	Her illness prompted her father to withdraw from the 1999  
International Race of Champions Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Unser, a two-time IROC champion and the career leading winner in  
the all-star series, will be replaced by NASCAR Winston Cup star 
Bobby Labonte, the pole winner for the 1998 Daytona 500 and a 
two-time winner last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-race IROC series begins Friday at Daytona International  
Speedway.

	 *DRIVER CHANGE:* Rookie Mike Harmon got a ride in Junie  
Donlavey's car because he brought Big Daddy's BBQ Sauce with him as 
a sponsor on the No. 90 Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	When Big Daddy's dried up as a sponsor, Donlavey changed drivers  
-- going back to one he fired in 1996 -- Mike Wallace. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we had Big Daddy's ... we had money to be able to bring a  
boy along like Harmon,'' said Donlavey, the senior owner in the 
sport. 
</P>
<P>
	But Harmon lacks the experience of Wallace, causing Donlavey to  
make the change in hopes of qualifying for the Daytona 500. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had to do something,'' Donlavey said.  
</P>
<P>
	Wallace, now a regular in the NASCAR truck series, was in  
Daytona Beach just to watch the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess I didn't burn any bridges,'' he said about rejoining  
Donlavey in what for now is a one-race arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
	Wallace said he remains committed to his truck deal.  
</P>
<P>

	 *AN OLD MAN:* Busch Grand National rookie Adam Petty has his  
favorite garage story concerning two-time series champion Randy 
LaJoie. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you add up all our ages, that's how old Randy LaJoie is,''  
said the 18-year-old Petty. 
</P>
<P>
	``Adam and I have a lot of fun,'' said LaJoie, 37. ``When he  
gets to be my age, I'm not sure he'll add up to as many wins as I 
have either. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *OLDER MEN:* Dave Marcis, hoping to extend his record to 32  
starts in the Daytona 500, must have the oldest race team in 
history. Marcis is 57, and Jim Sauter is 55. 
</P>
<P>
	Sauter won't be in the 500 unless both Marcis-owned cars make  
the field with finishes of 15th or better in qualifying races 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	If Sauter makes the field and Marcis doesn't, Sauter will exit  
the seat. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's our ace in the hole,'' Marcis said.

<P>
	 *DRIVE IN:* Stanton Barrett is a daredevil to be sure, and he  
might need some of that to make the Daytona 500 field. The 
26-year-old stuntman and son of former world land speed record 
holder Stan Barrett, must drive his way in because his speed is 
down and he has no owner points to make the race on a provisional. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our deal is pretty well cut-and-dried,'' Barrett said. ``If we  
finish 15th or better, we race in the Daytona 500. If we finish 
16th or worse, we go home and watch it on television.''

<HEADLINE> Concern Remains for Salman Rushdie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Ten years ago Sunday, Salman Rushdie received  
what he has called his ``unfunny Valentine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Feb. 14, 1989, the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini condemned  
``The Satanic Verses'' as blasphemy, and called for Rushdie's 
death. The author, who lives in London, was forced into hiding. The 
novel's Japanese translator was murdered and the Italian and 
Norwegian translators were attacked. 
</P>
<P>
	A decade later, the 51-year-old Rushdie is, in many ways, a  
fortunate man. He has long outlived Khomeini, the Iranian leader 
who died less than four months after issuing the ``fatwa'' (a 
religious death threat). ``The Satanic Verses'' has sold more than 
a million copies worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Rushdie continues to write and has been seen increasingly in  
public. Last fall, after Iran's foreign minister said his country 
would not enforce the fatwa, an international committee set up on 
Rushdie's behalf was disbanded. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rushdie's novel, which satirized the Prophet Mohammed and  
the origins of the Koran, is still banned in several Middle Eastern 
and Asian countries and is still controversial in parts of the 
West; only last year did a mainstream British publisher, Vintage, 
get around to issuing the book in paperback. 
</P>
<P>
	And although Rushdie has said the ``last chapter'' of his ordeal  
is complete and even boasted that he was ``happy'' not to be a 
Muslim, others doubt he is out of danger. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is the danger entirely gone? Of course not. There's still a  
bounty on his head. He still receives constant threats,'' said 
Susan Sontag, a friend of Rushdie's and a former president of the 
American center of International PEN, a writers' organization that 
vehemently opposed the fatwa. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a step in the right direction, but one can't really jump  
up and down and start clapping yet,'' said author Paul Auster, also 
a friend of Rushdie's. ``But to go through what he's gone through 
and not have moments of pique and anger and say things you would 
regret is perfectly normal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel Pipes, an author and director of the Middle East Forum, a  
Philadelphia-based think tank, said there was nothing new about 
last fall's announcement. He said that Iranian officials long had 
claimed they would not act upon the death sentence and that they 
were simply interested in improving relations with Britain, a 
desired trading partner. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fatwa is in effect, and will remain in effect,'' said  
Pipes, who wrote about the death sentence in the book ``The Rushdie 
Affair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My view was when Khomeini died, Rushdie had no chance to  
escape this edict. No one who took Khomeini's place had the stature 
to revoke it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carmel Bedford, who served as secretary for the now-defunct  
International Rushdie Defense Committee, said the committee's 
concern was that the fatwa had government authorization. Without 
that, she said, the author is relatively safe, despite the threats 
from religious leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rushdie now is just the same as any celebrity who has that  
appeal for lunatics,'' said Bedford, whose organization was based 
in London and was affiliated with International PEN. 
</P>
<P>
	``After the agreement last fall with the Iranian government, we  
expected to have people come out of the woodwork and make threats, 
which they did in the immediate weeks after. But that was to try 
and galvanize extremists, and they are in a minority.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Support for the fatwa remains. In Rushdie's native India, a  
powerful Muslim cleric warned of violent protests against any visit 
by the author. India, which has a sizable Muslim minority and was 
the first to ban ``The Satanic Verses,'' recently granted Rushdie a 
visa for the first time since the 1980s. Rushdie's lawyer, Vijay 
Shankaras, has said the author could visit India within two or 
three months. 
</P>
<P>
	In Iran, a foundation has offered a $2.8 million reward for  
Rushdie's death and hundreds turned out for an anti-Rushdie 
demonstration. More than half of the countrye come out of the 
woodwork and make threats, which they did in the immediate weeks 
after. But that was to try and galvanize extremists, and they are 
in a minority.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to reporters last fall, Rushdie said he would still  
need some kind of security, but no longer ``the colossal apparatus 
of state protection.'' He said a number of suspected stalkers were 
expelled from Britain over the years, but that none came close to 
harming him. 
</P>
<P>
	Compared to some authors, Rushdie is certainly lucky. According  
to International PEN's Writers-in-Prison Committee, over 300 
writers and journalists have been killed in the past five years and 
at any given time some 300 are in prison. For all the worrying that 
no one cares anymore about writing, some unquestionably still care 
-- enough to want the writer silenced. 
</P>
<P>
	``Writers are dangerous because they're free,'' Auster said.  
``They think for themselves, and in a repressive regime that's the 
most dangerous thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many Iranian writers have lived in exile since the 1979 Islamic  
revolution and it is believed that several who remained in the 
country were murdered. Just last year, writers Mohammad Jafar 
Pouyandeh and Mohammad Mokhtari disappeared from their homes. Their 
bodies were found dumped on the outskirts of Tehran, both 
apparently strangled. 
</P>
<P>
	The two had tried to establish a writers association and had  
been summoned by a court two months earlier to answer questions 
about their activities. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I were Salman Rushdie, I would be concerned,'' said  
novelist Joanne Leedom-Ackerman, vice president of International 
PEN. ``Clearly, with the number of writers who have been killed, 
all factions in Iran are not at peace with freedom of expression.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rushdie, a prominent writer well before ``Satanic Verses,'' is  
the author of eight works of fiction, including the Booker 
Prize-winning novel ``Midnight's Children,'' and three works of 
nonfiction. He declined to comment on the anniversary of the fatwa 
and has been known to become annoyed when interviewers bring up 
similarities between his fiction and his life. 
</P>
<P>
	His new novel, ``The Ground Beneath Her Feet,'' will be  
published by Henry Holt this spring. The main character is a famous 
pop singer who is trapped in a major earthquake and lost to her 
friends forever. 
</P>
<P>
	The last day of her life: St. Valentine's Day, 1989.

<HEADLINE> Panel OKs Work Exemption for Amish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A House committee voted Wednesday to relax  
federal child-labor protection laws that the Amish believe are 
threatening their centuries-old religious and work values. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, approved on a voice vote by the House Committee on  
Education and the Workforce, would let Amish teen-agers work in 
sawmills, woodworking shops and other industries that the Amish 
deem essential to their livelihood but that the Labor Department 
deems hazardous. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no reason to believe that Amish young people will be  
placed at risk,'' said Rep. William Goodling, R-Pa., the committee 
chairman. ``But the fact is that as the Amish struggle to raise 
their children and preserve their way of life, the Department of 
Labor's actions are undermining the Amish culture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Amish are known for shunning modern conveniences and taught  
to live apart from the world and abstain from worldly goods. They 
began arriving in the United States about 1720 and settled first in 
Pennsylvania. Some 150,000 Amish live in 22 states and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Their religious traditions forbid formal schooling beyond eighth  
grade, and youngsters are supposed to work after that in 
apprenticeship settings, such as woodworking. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Democrats raised safety concerns, saying a work environment  
dangerous for adults is even more dangerous for teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not reasonable for a 14-year-old to have the same  
discipline and concentration as adults,'' said Rep. William Clay of 
Missouri, the panel's ranking Democrat. ``Any inattention can be 
fatal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the bill countered that the youths would be  
working with their parents or other members of the Amish community 
in limited, supervised settings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Amish livelihood has traditionally been rooted in  
agriculture, but many families have turned to woodworking and other 
small industries because of the growing costs of farming. 
</P>
<P>
	That set up a clash with federal labor laws, which prohibit  
children under 16 from working in manufacturing operations such as 
sawmills and children under 18 from working in other hazardous 
occupations, even for tasks that do not require operating 
mechanical equipment. Several Amish businesses have been fined 
thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation sent to the full House would let teen-agers work  
in those settings under supervision. They still would be prohibited 
from directly operating mechanical equipment. The measure also 
would require other anti-noise and safety features, including 
barriers to protect against wood particles or flying debris. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar legislation passed the House last year but died in the  
Senate. Rep. Joseph Pitts, R-Pa., the bill's chief sponsor, said 
concerns had been raised in the Senate over the constitutionality 
of exempting members of one religion. But he said he believed the 
dispute has largely been resolved, as the Supreme Court has granted 
the Amish exemptions from such requirements as schooling beyond 
eighth grade. 
</P>
<P>
	Labor Department officials say their foremost duty is to protect  
youths from occupational hazards, regardless of religion, race, 
ethnicity or gender. They say they understand the Amish 
circumstances but believe that safety comes first.

<HEADLINE> Va. Offers $2M to Switched Babies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) -- The families of two girls switched  
at birth are divided over whether to accept a reported $4 million 
settlement offer from the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Three-year-olds Rebecca Grace Chittum and Callie Marie Johnson  
would get $2 million over 25 years under the proposed deal by the 
state of Virginia, which runs the University of Virginia Medical 
Center, where the girls were switched in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman raising Callie Marie has rejected the offer.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's not enough for these little girls,'' said Cynthia  
Johnson, the lawyer for Paula Johnson. ``Their whole lives are 
screwed up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	W.T. Robey III, an attorney for one of two sets of grandparents  
who are raising the other girl, called the offer ``fair'' and said 
an agreement could be reached soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives the child a college education and financial security  
for the balance of her life for whatever needs she may have,'' 
Robey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoping to head off lawsuits from the girls' families, the state  
made the settlement offers in December, state officials who 
requested anonymity said in today's editions of The Washington Post 
and the Richmond Times-Dispatch. 
</P>
<P>
	If accepted, the state would immediately pay $350,000 to the  
families of each girl. When the girls turn 18, they would each get 
$50,000 a year for four years. After that, they would get $100,000 
annually for another three years. Each would get single payments of 
$400,000 at age 25 and $750,000 at age 30. 
</P>
<P>
	The attorney for Paula Johnson, who is raising Callie but is the  
biological mother of Rebecca, criticized the offer. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only cash up front that would be available for the parents  
was that $350,000,'' said Cynthia Johnson, who is not related to 
Paula Johnson. ``There should be a separate settlement for the 
child and ... for the parents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators trying to determine how the switch happened have  
cited more than three dozen deficiencies in the maternity ward and 
other locations at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the Virginia Health Department investigation failed to  
determine how the girls were sent home with the wrong mothers. 
Investigators said the hospital was sloppy or inconsistent in 
following important procedures, including those for using newborn 
ID bands. 
</P>
<P>
	The hospital has changed the way it bands infants. It now uses  
an identification tag that is clamped to the infant's umbilical 
cord, as well as wrist and ankle bands.

<HEADLINE> CBS To Overhaul `NFL Today' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CBS completed its purge of its rookie studio analysts Wednesday,  
hiring veterans Craig James and Jerry Glanville to boost its 
struggling ``NFL Today'' studio show. 
</P>
<P>
	The network had come under heavy criticism last year for pairing  
Jim Nantz with television rookies Marcus Allen, Brent Jones and 
George Seifert. 
</P>
<P>
	The foursome didn't mesh from the outset, and Seifert was  
replaced during the season with insider Mike Lombardi, who likely 
will return to his off-air research role next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Seifert left the network last month to coach the Carolina  
Panthers. Allen will be a reporter and Jones will be a game 
analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think with the lineup that we'll have this season, we'll be  
in a much more competitive position with the other NFL pregame 
shows,'' said CBS Sports President Sean McManus. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the ``NFL Today'' was the lowest rated network  
pregame show in history. Its 2.7 rating on Sunday's one-hour show 
trailed Fox by 37 percent, prompting Wednesday's moves. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people at CBS realized now how it was a real tough task  
for Brent and Marcus coming in with little experience,'' said 
James, who has been hosting college football studio shows since 
1991. ``I genuinely believe that if this team comes about, with 
Randy (Cross) and Jerry, it will be entertaining and informative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cross, who filled in on CBS' studio during the playoffs, is  
expected to be the final member of the team as soon as the network 
finds a replacement for him as the network's No. 2 analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	Glanville has spent the last five seasons as an analyst for Fox  
and also co-hosts ``Inside the NFL'' on HBO. Fox claims it has a 
three-year contract with Glanville, but he says he never signed it. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they have a document with my signature, I promise you the  
FBI will be called in because it is a forgery,'' Glanville said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox spokesman Vince Wladika would not say if there was a signed  
contract but said there was an agreement with the network and 
Glanville's agent Ed Hookstratten. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is paperwork exchanged between Fox and (lawyer) Ed  
Hookstratten that indicates there is an agreement between Fox and 
Jerry Glanville,'' said Fox spokesman Vince Wladika. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the uncertainty, CBS said Glanville is a member of its  
team now. This isn't the first time that a broadcaster has tried to 
switch jobs after not signing his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Dierdorf moved from CBS to ABC's ``Monday Night Football''  
in 1987 after failing to sign his contract. Dierdorf was let go by 
ABC last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Phil Simms also switched from ESPN to NBC in a similar  
situation. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if Glanville is held to his Fox deal and doesn't join CBS,  
``NFL Today'' will receive a major boost from James and Cross. 
</P>
<P>
	James filled in well on ``NFL Today'' last year during the  
playoffs after being moved over from his college studio duties. 
</P>
<P>
	Cross has 10 years of industry experience -- and offers insight  
and humor that the show lacked. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overall, this has the potential to be as good as anything out  
there,'' Cross said. ``I spent one season with Jim, so I think 
we'll work well together. One thing is for sure -- opinions will not 
be at a shortage.''

<HEADLINE> Grisham Not Always So Well Known </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OXFORD, Miss. (AP) -- John Grisham is accustomed to cheering  
crowds at book signings, but it wasn't always that way. 
</P>
<P>
	Among old friends in his hometown who turned out Tuesday for a  
signing of his latest book, ``The Testament,'' Grisham, 44, 
recalled a very different event on the Gulf Coast in 1989. That was 
one of his first bookstore receptions, shortly after the former 
Mississippi lawmaker had written ``A Time to Kill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I went to a store at a mall down there, and the staff was so  
glad to see me. They got me coffee, couldn't have been nicer. They 
put me at a table at the front of the store, right out in the mall 
where people could see me. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hardly a soul showed up. People walking by would veer away  
from me like I was a beggar. And when the staff realized nobody was 
going to show, they got busy real quick, putting up stock or 
whatever. A buddy of mine from law school finally walked by and we 
talked for an hour and a half. And he didn't even buy a book.''

<P>
	WEMBLEY, England (AP) -- Nicolas Anelka became the first  
Frenchman to score against England at Wembley Stadium, getting both 
goals as the World Cup champions won 2-0 Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Playing against three defenders who play alongside him for the  
London club Arsenal, Anelka hit the crossbar in the 63rd minute 
with a shot that appeared to cross the goal line, then scored in 
the 69th and 76th minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	France, which had lost four straight games against England at  
Wembley, is unbeaten in 18 games. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss did little to enhance Howard Wilkinson's chances of  
becoming England's coach. He is interim coach following last week's 
firing of Glenn Hoddle, who was ousted after being quoted as saying 
the disabled were being punished ``for the sins of an earlier 
life.''

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Prices Fall Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets took a beating  
Wednesday following hefty losses on Wall Street, though shares were 
mixed on the big Tokyo market. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index fell 168.16 points,  
or 1.8 percent, to close at 9,076.33, as strong U.S. economic data 
released in recent weeks dashed hopes for any immediate local 
interest rate cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	The market also has been quiet ahead of the long Lunar New Year  
holiday next week. 
</P>
<P>
	In Singapore, the Straits Times Index fell 19.81 points, or 1.5  
percent, to 1,286.56. Banking shares led the fall as investors 
bought safer government bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	In Manila, shares fell for the fifth straight session on recent  
poor Philippine economic data. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-company PSE index closed down 37.83 points, or 2.0  
percent, at 1,897.19, its lowest level in nearly two months. The 
index has lost 5.5 percent in the past five sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market was looking for any reason to sell shares and Wall  
Street's loss triggered the selloff,'' said Fitzgerald Aklan, 
assistant vice president for sales at Orion-Squire Securities Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average fell 1.7 percent to 9,133.03 on  
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo, prices were mixed with little news to motivate  
investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 49.74  
points, or 0.36 percent, to close at 13,952.40. On Tuesday, the 
average had fallen 89.83 points, or 0.64 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Many investors refrained from active trading ahead of a Bank of  
Japan board meeting on Friday. Japan's financial markets will be 
closed Thursday for a national holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the U.S. dollar surged against the Japanese  
yen as investors were reassured by Brazil's pledge to take 
responsibility for some European bond payments, following reports 
questioning whether the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais would fail 
to pay. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 115.30 yen in late trading, up 0.60 yen from  
late Tuesday in Tokyo and well above its late New York level of 
114.39 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Thai shares fell on heavy selling in financial issues,  
after Bangkok Bank said it would raise capital to meet loan-loss 
provisions requirements without government help. The SET index fell 
5.62 points, or 1.75 percent, to 314.74. 
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Indonesian shares fell in line with other Asian  
bourses. The JSX Composite Index dropped 4.145 points, or 1 
percent, to 398.681. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian shares continued to fall following the  
introduction of an exit tax imposed on investors who take profits 
out of the country. The Composite Index lost 1.99 points, or 0.36 
points, to 546.15. 
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: South Korean shares rebounded after recent sharp losses  
that had come on concerns about higher interest rates. The Kospi 
index rose 1.11 points, or 0.21 percent, to 524.49. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australian shares fell, mostly triggered by the Dow's  
drop. The All Ordinaries index fell 35.9 points, or 1.2 percent, to 
2,854.8 points. 
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Taiwanese shares rose on government buying and on  
expectations Taiwan will soon announce new economic stimulus 
measures. The Weighted Price Index closed up 74.27 points, or 1.3 
percent, to 5,798.00. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand shares plunged on fears of an imminent  
interest rate increase. The NZSE-40 capital index fell 62.49 
points, or 2.9 percent, to 2,103.80.

<HEADLINE> USDA Almost Out of Loan Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A rush of farmers borrowing money to handle  
debt after a year of low prices has nearly depleted federal loan 
money, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency is preparing numbers to formally request additional  
money from Congress, Glickman told a Senate committee Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our funding will be exhausted in the next few weeks,''  
Glickman said. ``Demand is outrunning our funding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the agency has not decided how much money to request but  
said it may be as much as $100 million for loans, plus additional 
money to assist Puerto Rico, which was hit hard by Hurricane 
Georges last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Agency officials said they hoped to prepare paperwork to submit  
to the White House in the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers have been forced to seek more loans to restructure debt  
and jump-start their operations after a year in which prices in 
some sectors dipped to record lows. Hog farmers, for instance, saw 
prices drop as low as $8 a hundredweight in December. Grain farmers 
also had a bad price year. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are lines. There is a waiting period,'' Glickman said of  
the Farm Service Agency offices in various states that administer 
USDA loans. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, a coalition of farm groups wrote the Clinton  
administration and Congress warning them of the impending crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``The continuation of low prices for virtually all commodities  
and livestock -- as well as natural disaster which occurred in 1998 
-- has dramatically increased the demand for funding through 
guaranteed loan programs,'' the groups wrote. Many states have 
already depleted their allotment of funds, the groups said. 
</P>
<P>
	Demand has increased 26 percent for the guaranteed operating  
loan, 160 percent for the interest assistance program and 92 
percent for the guaranteed farm ownership program, the groups said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to make sure that every farmer and rancher that is  
having financial difficulties has access to the options that the 
guaranteed loan programs offer,'' the letter said.

<HEADLINE> Cousins Arrested After Swap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FITCHBURG, Mass. (AP) -- Two cousins were wanted for unrelated  
shootings 1,000 miles apart -- one in this central Massachusetts 
city, the other in Georgia. Both went on the lam and hid with 
relatives, essentially swapping places. 
</P>
<P>
	They were back in custody Wednesday and awaiting transfer back  
to their hometowns. Fitchburg police arrested John Pridgen of 
Georgia, and Georgia authorities picked up Satron Pridgen of 
Fitchburg. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's extremely unusual that we have members of the same family  
swapping places, being involved in crimes north and south of the 
Mason-Dixon Line,'' said Bucky Burnsed, a spokesman for the police 
in Savannah, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	John Pridgen, 22, was a suspect in the Nov. 30 shooting death of  
Khalif McLeod as the victim rode a bike on a street in Savannah. 
Police believe the killing stemmed from a gang turf war. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Satron Pridgen, 20, was being sought in connection  
with an attack at an Oct. 25 party in Fitchburg. The victim, a 
38-year-old man, was shot in the face but survived. 
</P>
<P>
	Satron Pridgen was arrested Feb. 4 in Pembroke, Ga., where his  
mother owns a mobile home. 
</P>
<P>
	John Pridgen was arrested Jan. 20 in a Fitchburg apartment after  
Savannah police received a tip and relayed it to Massachusetts 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear Wednesday who the attorneys for the two men were.

<HEADLINE> Bears President McCaskey Replaced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) -- For 79 years, the Chicago Bears were  
the ultimate family operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Founding father and coach George Halas, his son and finally his  
grandson exercised day-to-day control of the storied team that 
helped start the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	Now all that has changed. Ted Phillips, reared in the  
organization but not a member of the family, is in as president and 
CEO. And Halas' grandson, Michael McCaskey, is out as president 
after 16 years, booted upstairs to chairman of the board. 
</P>
<P>
	And who better to make the tough restructuring announcement  
Wednesday than Virginia Halas McCaskey? She's the team's majority 
stockholder, George's daughter and Michael's mom. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it took me overnight, and I began to look at it  
realistically rather than sentimentally,'' Virginia McCaskey said. 
``I realized this was the way to go and the thing to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael McCaskey's critics were many and his mistakes glaring as  
the once-proud Bears floundered on the field and off. 
</P>
<P>
	The team suffered through losing seasons, empty seats, bad  
personnel decisions, failure to land a new lease or stadium and an 
embarrassing fiasco last month in naming a new head coach. 
</P>
<P>
	All for a team that looked in the mid-80s as a budding dynasty  
following an 18-1 mark and Super Bowl title following the 1985 
season. Many thought the Bears would return many times under coach 
Mike Ditka. They haven't been back since, and both Ditka and Dave 
Wannstedt have been fired as coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Phillips, formerly vice president of football operations and  
the team's chief financial officer, has the assignment of 
resurrecting the struggling team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ted has been handed the baton. He's our new leader,'' Michael  
McCaskey said. ``Along with the responsibilities comes the 
authority to hire and fire and structure the way he thinks is best 
for the Bears.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That won't include hiring a general manager, something McCaskey  
refused to do. Phillips vowed to let personnel director Mark Hatley 
and new coach Dick Jauron make the football decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think one of the misconceptions out there is the term GM.  
Everyone throws it around,'' Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You draw lines of authority and give people responsibility and  
let them run with their decisions. What a GM accomplishes we will 
accomplish with Dick and Mark.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bears took a public relations beating last month when  
Arizona Cardinals defensive coordinator Dave McGinnis turned down 
the team's coaching job after his hiring was announced prematurely. 
</P>
<P>
	The team issued a press release and called a news conference to  
introduce McGinnis, who was livid because no agreement had been 
reached. 
</P>
<P>
	Trying to put it quickly behind them, the Bears then turned to  
Jauron, Jacksonville's defensive coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was nothing calculated in what happened there. For  
whatever mistakes that were made, I regret my part, especially the 
misunderstandings that developed. I wish we hadn't stumbled that 
badly,'' Michael McCaskey said Wednesday of the McGinnis incident. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's disappointing to foul up like that and to cause grief for  
other people whom you admire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Virginia McCaskey said the McGinnis fiasco didn't prompt her  
family to make the change. And she said the criticism has been 
tough at times. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any mother, any wife likes to see her loved ones appreciated  
and supported. But I think maybe Mike has handled it better than I 
have,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael McCaskey, 55, praised Phillips for his contributions to  
the team over the last 16 years. He said handing over control to a 
person outside of the family ``was emotional, but it's not 
agonizing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's emotional because it is so important for us as the  
McCaskey-Halas family to be tied to the Bears.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the restructuring, his father, Ed McCaskey, who will  
turn 80 in April, stepped down as chairman of the board and took 
the title of chairman emeritus. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips, 41, a former auditor and tax accountant, joined the  
Bears in 1983 as the club's controller. He is still the team's 
chief negotiator of players' contracts, but said he will try to 
hire someone for that position soon with the free agency period 
starting Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips learned of his appointment Monday when summoned to the  
McCaskey home. He said his first priority will be to work out a new

<HEADLINE> Regional Theater: Skin of Our Teeth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- The Ice Age. The Great Flood. A World War.  
Plus a parade of famous people from Socrates to Homer to Moses to 
Jesus and even the Virgin Mary. 
</P>
<P>
	Such are the improbable ingredients of ``Over &AMP; Over,'' a new  
Kander and Ebb musical that will be over and out unless major 
revisions are made before a second production is attempted. It may 
be a good thing they already cut the woolly mammoths. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on Thornton Wilder's ``The Skin of Our Teeth,'' the show  
receiving its world premiere at the tiny Signature Theater is 
unfocused and seems unfinished, despite a high-powered cast and a 
veteran creative team. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the trouble is the musical's original source. ``The Skin  
of Our Teeth'' remains an odd play, a three-act comedy that 
chronicles the adventures of an Everyman, his wife, two children 
and a recalcitrant maid. They muddle their way through a series of 
calamities, including a conflagration not unlike the one raging 
when Wilder's work first opened on Broadway in 1942. 
</P>
<P>
	A struggle for survival should permeate this work -- and it does,  
although what produces that effect in the musical is the performers 
grappling with some pretty incoherent material. 
</P>
<P>
	David Garrison and Linda Emond, as Mr. and Mrs. Antrobus,  
portray types, not people. Admittedly, the Wilder original didn't 
give adapter Joseph Stein much to work with. 
</P>
<P>
	The father blusters, invents the wheel and has an affair with  
the maid. The mother fusses, sings one lovely song, ``He Always 
Comes Home to Me,'' and worries about her children. Stein makes 
these characters smaller than life, lost even on the Signature's 
small stage. 
</P>
<P>
	Not so Dorothy Loudon, playing a series of three roles including  
the Virgin Mary. None of them has anything to do with the plot, but 
at least one of her two songs, ``This Life,'' has the potential to 
stop the show, if it ever builds up enough momentum to get going 
for more than a moment or two. 
</P>
<P>
	Sherie Scott, one of the shining lights in Disney's ``Elaborate  
Lives'' done last fall in Atlanta, beams just as brightly in ``Over 
&AMP; Over.'' As Sabina the vixenish maid, Scott injects sass and sex 
appeal into the proceedings, particularly when she vamps through 
``You Owe It to Yourself,'' an attempted seduction of Mr. Antrobus. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the score -- music by John Kander and lyrics by Fred Ebb -- is  
frustratingly inconsistent. It falters at crucial dramatic moments 
and often just marks time. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, ``Rain,'' a big, if obvious number that precedes  
the flood to end all floods, doesn't overpower the way it should. 
Neither does a gospel jamboree meant to enliven the appearance of 
all those famous people in Act 1. And Sabina's song of hope, 
``Someday, Pasadena,'' becomes a bewildering and hokey dance 
sequence, complete with twirling gauchos, that would not be have 
been out of place on ``The Ed Sullivan Show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Director Eric D. Schaeffer has had a hard time shaping this  
large amount of material, much less giving it any drive. For a show 
that covers thousands of years of history, ``Over &AMP; Over'' 
meanders. 
</P>
<P>
	It's always a bad sign when Act 2 is longer than what preceded  
it. Here, the second and third acts of the original have been 
crammed into one, making for a long sit-down after intermission. 
</P>
<P>
	The show also takes a turn for the serious in the second half,  
especially after war erupts. By then daughter Gladys, who had been 
something of a whine, has had a baby and son Henry, a stand-in for 
Cain (complete with a mark on his forehead), gets to reveal his 
true, evil nature. As Henry, Jim Newman snarls effectively through 
the toughest of Kander and Ebb's ditties, ``Nice People.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Every so often, ``Over &AMP; Over'' cheerfully breaks down the  
theater's fourth wall -- with the maid addressing the audience and a 
harassed stage manager (a nice bit of tomfoolery by the very funny 
Mario Cantone) interrupting the action, too. 
</P>
<P>
	At times like these, the show really connects with theatergoers.  
If only the rest of ``Over &AMP; Over,'' were that audience-pleasing -- 
and to the point. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over &AMP; Over'' plays through Feb. 21.

<HEADLINE> Robertson Returns To Lead Coalition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHESAPEAKE, Va. (AP) -- Christian Coalition founder Pat Robertson  
has reassumed the presidency of the political organization after 
spending several years as a senior adviser, a spokeswoman said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The post became vacant when Don Hodel, a former Reagan  
administration Cabinet secretary, left to pursue other interests. 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson angered some conservative leaders, including Hodel,  
when he said last month that President Clinton had won the public 
relations battle and the Senate should end the impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Hodel said he had been planning to leave the coalition for  
months and that his departure had nothing to do with Robertson's 
remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	Coalition spokeswoman Molly Clatworthy said Robertson had  
already taken up the duties of the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	Hodel and former Rep. Randy Tate, R-Wash., took over the  
coalition in 1997, replacing strategist Ralph Reed, who had helped 
Robertson build the grassroots organization into a national force. 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson founded the coalition in 1989 after a failed 1988  
presidential campaign. He served as president while Reed worked as 
executive director. 
</P>
<P>
	The coalition is in the midst of efforts to defend its past  
political activities. The Federal Election Commission has sued the 
coalition, accusing it of illegally spending thousands of dollars 
to promote Republican candidates.

<HEADLINE> Falwell Calls 'Teletubby' Gay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROANOKE, Va. (AP) -- Is Tinky Winky gay?  
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Jerry Falwell suspects so, telling parents that the  
purple ``Teletubbies'' character from the popular children's 
television show is a homosexual role model. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a headline that reads ``Parents Alert: Tinky Winky Comes  
Out of the Closet,'' an article in the February edition of the 
National Liberty Journal notes that Tinky Winky has the voice of a 
boy yet carries a purse. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is purple -- the gay-pride color; and his antenna is shaped  
like a triangle -- the gay-pride symbol,'' the story said. The paper 
is edited and published by Falwell. 
</P>
<P>
	Falwell contends the ``subtle depictions'' are intentional and  
in a statement issued Tuesday said, ``As a Christian I feel that 
role modeling the gay lifestyle is damaging to the moral lives of 
children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Itsy Bitsy Entertainment Co., which licenses the  
Teletubbies in the United States, said that what Falwell's 
newspaper described as a purse is actually Tinky Winky's magic bag. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that he carries a magic bag doesn't make him gay,''  
Steve Rice said. ``It's a children's show, folks. To think we would 
be putting sexual innuendo in a children's show is kind of 
outlandish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The British show aimed at toddlers began airing on U.S. public  
television stations last spring and is now as popular as Barney, a 
singing dinosaur who also happens to be purple. 
</P>
<P>
	The Teletubbies are portrayed by actors in oversized, brightly  
colored costumes. They all have television screens on their tummies 
and, according to the story line, live in a superdome hidden in the 
hills. 
</P>
<P>
	Other than Tinky Winky, the troupe features Dipsy in green,  
Laa-Laa in orange and Po in red. The Teletubbies dance, sing and 
share ``bi-i-ig hugs'' beneath a radiant sun emblazoned with the 
face of a laughing infant. 
</P>
<P>
	Rice said Falwell was attacking ``something sweet and innocent''  
to further his conservative political agenda. ``To out a Teletubby 
in a preschool show is kind of sad on his part. I really find it 
absurd and kind of offensive,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Falwell's spokeswoman, Laura Swickard, said the founder of the  
now-defunct Moral Majority agreed with everything that was in the 
NLJ article and would not comment beyond his one-paragraph 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Falwell urged General Motors, Chrysler and Johnson &AMP;  
Johnson to withdraw their sponsorship of an episode of the sitcom 
``Ellen'' when the lead character announced her homosexuality.

<HEADLINE> Buick Invitational To Feature Woods  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- All Tiger Woods has to do to keep his No. 1  
spot on the Official World Golf Ranking is to play well this week 
in the Buick Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods holds a slim lead over David Duval, but said he doesn't  
put much emphasis on the rankings, which will be used to set the 
64-player field at the Andersen Consulting Match Play Championship 
in two weeks at La Costa. 
</P>
<P>
	What he'd really like to do is simply tame Torrey Pines,  
starting today. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would much rather go out there and just win tournaments, and  
winning tournaments will take care of that,'' Wood said of the 
rankings. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is, victories haven't come as easy for Woods as they  
did in his first 21 tour starts as a pro, when he won six times. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods paused a moment when asked if he was happy with his game.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's all right,'' he said. ``It's nothing great right now. I'm  
not hitting it as well as I'd like and putting as well as I'd like, 
but I'm getting around. I'm scoring well, just not playing well. 
I'm getting the job done with my short game, but I wish I could 
make a few more putts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Expounding on his putting problems, he said: ``It's been one of  
those unusual stretches where I've never remembered lipping out so 
many putts over the last six months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe things will change at Torrey Pines, a course he's played  
many times. 
</P>
<P>
	With just one victory in his last 31 PGA starts, Woods opens a  
stretch of three straight tournaments on familiar courses -- Torrey 
Pines, Riviera and La Costa. 
</P>
<P>
	He won an Optimist Junior World Golf Championship at Torrey  
Pines South as a 15-year-old in 1991. Last year he left a 40-foot 
eagle putt a foot short on the final hole to miss getting into a 
playoff in the rain-shortened Buick with eventual winner Scott 
Simpson and Skip Kendall. 
</P>
<P>
	``I enjoy playing down here,'' Woods said. ``Since I grew up  
here in Southern California, it's a little bit easier for me to 
play when we're on the West Coast. It's great. I know the greens, I 
know the course. I played here a bunch of times. It'll be a fun 
tournament.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods is the marquee name in a field that includes just nine of  
the top 20 money winners after the first five tournaments. Among 
those skipping the Buick are Duval, Payne Stewart, Rocco Mediate, 
Justin Leonard and 1997 winner Mark O'Meara. Jeff Sluman is the 
only 1999 winner in the field. 
</P>
<P>
 *Divots:* Course manager John Walter said the sulfuric acid burns on  
the 18th greens of both the North and South courses have been 90 
percent repaired. The North 18 was the most heavily damaged when a 
vandal or vandals struck less than two weeks ago. Although there 
will be color differences between the old and new sod, the green is 
rolling smooth, Walter said. ... The North Course, which had been 
considered two strokes easier than the South, has been lengthened 
due to renovations to five holes, including two of the par-5s. 
``It's pretty close now, but I think the par-5s on the South Course 
aren't as accessible as the par-5s on the North,'' Woods said. ... 
Golfers play a round each on the North and South before the cut, 
then the final two rounds are played on the South. ... After a wet 
weekend at Pebble Beach, the weather here should be sunny and cool, 
with some Santa Ana winds.

<HEADLINE> Baptists Pull Support for American </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The Southern Baptist Convention has  
withdrawn its recommendation that members fly American Airlines, 
saying the nation's second-largest carrier broke a promise by 
donating $75,000 to pro-gay organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	American insisted it never promised to stay neutral on gay  
issues. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, the 15.6 million-member convention recommended  
American and Delta Air Lines for travel to its annual meeting in 
Atlanta, scheduled for June 15-16. An average of 20,000 people 
attend such meetings of the nation's largest Protestant 
denomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials pulled the recommendation for American on Tuesday.  
Convention spokesman Bill Merrell said the organization recently 
learned that American gave $50,000 to the Gay and Lesbian Alliance 
Against Defamation media awards -- which will honor ``Corpus 
Christi,'' a play with a gay Christlike character which has been 
criticized as blasphemous by Christian groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Merrell also said American gave $25,000 to the Human Rights  
Campaign, which supports the legalization of same-sex marriages. 
</P>
<P>
	He said American officials had promised to stay away from  
``anti-family organizations'' after evangelical groups published an 
open letter in The Washington Times and Texas newspapers in 1997 
claiming the airline targeted the gay market. 
</P>
<P>
	``In order to be fair to our constituents and exercise our  
integrity we had a duty to let our constituents know that we are 
not recommending American Airlines,'' Merrell said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the convention doesn't plan a full-scale boycott as was  
launched against the Walt Disney Co. in 1997, he said. Southern 
Baptists are boycotting Disney for its corporate practice of 
extending health insurance to homosexual partners of employees and 
hosting homosexuals at its amusement parks. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrea Rader, a spokeswoman at American's headquarters at Fort  
Worth, Texas, said the airline appears to have been ``singled out'' 
by the convention. 
</P>
<P>
	Rader said the airline financially supports the Human Rights  
Campaign and the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, known 
as GLAD, but she could not confirm the exact figures. 
</P>
<P>
	``We consider the Human Rights Campaign and GLAD to be civil  
rights organizations, and our association with them is one that we 
consider to be consistent with our employees' interests and with a 
significant section of our customer base,'' Rader said.

<HEADLINE> Woman Identified After 14 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITE RIVER JUNCTION, Vt. (AP) -- She traveled until she ran out  
of money, then locked herself in a motel room and swallowed a fatal 
dose of insecticide. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman had gone to great lengths to conceal her identity.  
</P>
<P>
	No driver's license, credit card, checkbook or other identifying  
materials were found with the woman's body. She had signed guest 
registers ``K. Smith,'' paid in cash and made calls with prepaid 
phone cards. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourteen frustrating months later, police on Wednesday said they  
had identified the mystery woman as Susan Clapp, 45, of St. Charles 
County, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	Her death had been ruled a suicide shortly after she was found  
dead in a room at a Comfort Inn here on Dec. 17, 1997. Still 
unknown, she was buried in a Vermont hillside cemetery in October, 
with townspeople taking up a collection to pay for a simple 
headstone. 
</P>
<P>
	Police pursued more than 100 leads. They ran a description  
through the National Crime Information Center and checked out 36 
possible matches to missing people in the days after the body was 
found. 
</P>
<P>
	No luck. No one from Clapp's family ever reported her missing.  
</P>
<P>
	All police really knew was that in the days before her death,  
the mystery woman took a train from New York to Claremont, N.H., 
stayed at a bed and breakfast, got a ride to White River Junction 
and stayed two nights at the Comfort Inn. 
</P>
<P>
	The big break came Feb. 2, when the St. Louis Post-Dispatch ran  
a brief story saying that police had traced receipts for a $150 
sweater and a $300 luggage set found in the mystery woman's 
possession to two upscale stores near St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	A photo ran with the story. Clapp's friend Richard Lakas saw it,  
``knew it was Sue'' and contacted Police Capt. Dave Rich in 
Vermont. 
</P>
<P>
	Then on Tuesday, the Vermont medical examiner's office made a  
positive identification from dental records. ``It was a long time 
coming,'' Rich said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clapp was a successful businesswoman who bought and sold  
repossessed houses in the St. Louis area when things began to go 
sour in the mid-1990s, Lakas said. 
</P>
<P>
	He called her ``very well educated, motivated, strong-willed,''  
and said she ate health foods and exercised. 
</P>
<P>
	She was divorced in January 1996. Rich said he had learned some  
business dealings had gone bad around the same time. Lakas wouldn't 
comment on that. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were a lot of things that had gone on in her life in the  
last couple of years that individually might not have had this 
impact, but when you added them up, they did,'' Rich said.

<HEADLINE> For Some, Y2K Causing Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Year 2000 computer problem is not only  
striking fear in the hearts of computer system operators, Sen. John 
McCain says. It's also bringing up dollar signs in the eyes of 
unscrupulous attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, R-Ariz., has introduced a bill that would limit the  
amount of damages plaintiffs can collect from companies that cause 
business failures or sell products that fail because of the 
problem, also known as the Y2K glitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Some frivolous lawsuits already have been filed, McCain, who is  
chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, told panel members 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``These lawsuits are sheer craziness and represent  
ambulance-chasing at its worst,'' McCain said. ``They are absolute 
confirmation that Y2K litigation is not about consumers, but about 
making wealthy lawyers even wealthier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Houston attorney Howard Nations disagreed, saying most  
responsible businesses are well on their way to having their 
computer systems ready for 2000. The only companies the bill would 
protect would be the ones that have procrastinated. 
</P>
<P>
	``Changing the law which controls the actions of corporate  
leaders within our civil justice system in order to reward the 
irresponsible while denying recovery to the responsible sends the 
wrong message to the business community, the wrong message to the 
public and the wrong message to voters,'' Nations told the 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer programmers are scrambling to avert disasters predicted  
when New Year's Day 2000 arrives. That's when computer systems 
performing calculations involving dates may begin generating 
incorrect data because they recognize only the last two digits of a 
year and will assume that 2000 is 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	Some experts have said the Y2K computer glitch could spark such  
problems as power outages, traffic snarls, paycheck delays and 
disruption of air travel. 
</P>
<P>
	It also is expected to trigger a flood of expensive lawsuits,  
and many of them are likely to be filed by greedy lawyers, said 
McCain. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the bill, which McCain called a ``work in progress'' that  
is open to changes, no punitive damages would be awarded except in 
cases of extreme negligence. Damages not related to economic loss 
would be limited to $250,000 or three times the amount of economic 
loss. Damages unrelated to economic loss for smaller businesses 
would be limited to $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also would require plaintiffs to give defendants a  
chance to correct their mistakes before a lawsuit is filed. 
</P>
<P>
	Businesses that make a good-faith effort to prepare for 2000 or  
fix their mistakes should not be punished for their efforts with 
high punitive damage awards, McCain said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several other members of Congress are working on their own bills  
and a coalition of business leaders has proposed another plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Small businessman Mark Yarsike asked the committee to reject the  
idea, saying a Y2K glitch turned his first day as a gourmet produce 
grocer into a nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
	Happy customers who streamed in and picked out purchases quickly  
became angry after store clerks tried to ring up purchases on the 
store's sparkling new $100,000 high-tech computer system. It 
crashed after clerks tried to process credit cards set to expire in 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``People were waiting with full carts of groceries to pay but  
couldn't,'' he told the committee. ``We could not process a single 
credit card or could not take cash or checks. We could not make one 
sale.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yarsike said that if such a law had been in place during the 2 1/2  
years he struggled with almost daily computer crashes, the company 
that sold him the system never would have settled out of court. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is S. 96.

<HEADLINE> Grains Mostly Up; Soybeans Lower / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
        CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain futures finished mostly higher Wednesday  
on the Chicago Board of Trade, while soybean futures finished mostly 
lower. 
</P>
<P>
        Soybeans recovered partially from an early tumble sparked by  
a report forecasting that the amount of soybeans left over before the 
next harvest will rise to 410 million bushels, a 13-year high and up 
from the 390 million bushels predicted last month. 
</P>
<P>
        Even more disturbing to market participants was the government's  
forecast that Argentina's corn, wheat and soybean crops will be large 
and that Brazil, the world's second-largest soybean grower behind the 
United States, will come close to last year's record harvest of 31 
million tons. 
</P>
<P>
        That likely would lead to pricing wars this spring as producers  
compete for scant export business, causing U.S. inventories to grow 
even further. 
</P>
<P>
        The U.S. Agriculture Department's corn outlook was mostly neutral,  
with the report predicting domestic and foreign demand will be strong 
enough to reduce inventories that are at the highest level since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
        The department said wheat exports will continue to suffer,  
boosting ending supplies to 980 million bushels, up from 900 million 
predicted a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
        March soybeans rose 1/4 cent to $4.99 1/4 a bushel, while other  
contract months retreated. Wheat for March delivery rose 2 3/4 cents 
to $2.67 1/4 a bushel; March corn rose 3 1/2 cents to $2.20 1/4 a bushel; 
March oats rose 3/4 cent to $1.07 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
        Beef and pork bellies futures were lower on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange, while lean hogs were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
        April live cattle fell 0.20 cent to 67.22 cents a pound; March  
feeder cattle fell 0.17 cent to 74.25 cents a pound; April lean hogs 
fell 0.72 cent to 46.85 cents a pound; March pork bellies fell 0.43 
cent to 57.52 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Medicare Makes Strides Vs. Waste </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Medicare is losing significantly less money to  
waste, fraud and mistakes, government auditors say. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appears we have turned a corner and are headed in the right  
direction,'' said Nancy-Ann DeParle, administrator of the health 
insurance program for the elderly and disabled. 
</P>
<P>
	An audit released Tuesday by the Health and Human Services  
Department's inspector general estimates that Medicare paid out 
$12.6 billion it shouldn't have in the government's fiscal year 
1998, which ended Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	That's about 7 cents out of every dollar that was spent by  
Medicare in direct payments to health care providers, including 
doctors and hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	By comparison, in 1996 -- the first year such estimates were made  
-- improper Medicare payments were estimated at $23.2 billion, or 14 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``It shows a very significant turnaround,'' said HHS Inspector  
General June Gibbs Brown, who attributed the improvement to 
stricter government supervision. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are taking it seriously that someone is going to check  
on what's going on,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	A government crackdown on Medicare waste began in 1993 with new  
money and power granted by Congress. Since then, the proportion of 
the program's 860 million bills a year that are reviewed by 
auditors has risen from 5 percent to 14 percent, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the Justice Department is working more closely with  
Medicare auditors to investigate suspicious claims and prosecute 
cases of suspected fraud -- including one against the nation's 
largest hospital chain, Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Some health care providers have complained that the anti-fraud  
tactics have been too harsh, threatening those who have made 
innocent mistakes and chilling caregivers' work with the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
	However, many lawmakers concerned about a cash shortage expected  
to face Medicare in less than a decade support even stricter 
controls. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not time for a victory lap,'' said Sen. Tom Harkin,  
D-Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Hospitals received the most improper Medicare payments in 1998 --  
$2.8 billion for care involving overnight stays and $1.2 billion 
for outpatient care. Home health care companies showed the biggest 
improvement, with overpayments dropping to $800 million from $2.5 
billion in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Auditors did not immediately attempt to distinguish between  
attempts to defraud the government and simple errors -- although 
they are following up each case. The most common problem found -- 
accounting for $7 billion in improper payments -- was that services 
provided were not considered medically necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	In one example, a home health care company was paid $1,198 for  
25 nursing visits to a woman, although auditors found she was able 
to drive and therefore not homebound -- a requirement for Medicare 
home care coverage.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Scandal Keeps Growing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The amazing thing was how raw it became, how all pretense was  
dropped at the end. 
</P>
<P>
	By then, according to a report released Tuesday by a Salt Lake  
City ethics panel, all shame and any fear of getting caught was 
apparently gone. By then, the grafters and glad-handers and poseurs 
no longer bothered to couch their requests as ``scholarship funds'' 
or even ``humanitarian aid.'' By then, there was no need. They 
simply asked for the money. 
</P>
<P>
	For enough money to put a family of four up in a top-of-the-line  
Paris hotel for a week and a half. For tens of thousands of dollars 
for the relative of an IOC member to cushion the pain of a divorce. 
</P>
<P>
	To twist one of IOC boss Juan Antonio Samaranch's pet phrases,  
what is unfolding in Salt Lake City will probably be remembered as 
the best Olympic scandal ever. Not because it involved the most 
money, but because the people in charge kept what amounts to the 
best record of an Olympic bribery scandal ever. 
</P>
<P>
	That might be a uniquely American habit. Handing over gifts and  
entertaining lavishly is not just the cost of doing business in 
this country anymore, it's practically the cornerstone. It's 
encouraged. It's perfectly legitimate. It's even tax deductible. 
It's also why the Super Bowl winds up in one town as opposed to 
another; and the Republican convention, the optometrists 
convention, the Scrabble convention and so on. 
</P>
<P>
	And so why, someone asked IOC vice president Dick Pound a few  
days ago, should the Olympics be any different? 
</P>
<P>
	The Canadian's answer cut right to the chase. Anachronism or  
not, the Olympics are supposed to be above purchase, about 
something other than money. 
</P>
<P>
	Towns that go after the Super Bowl, that hand out hotel suites  
and tickets to ride in the front of the airplane, are upfront about 
the process. They are spending money to make money. Towns that go 
after the Olympics have always done the same thing. The difference 
is that while the chase takes place, everybody talks about grander 
stuff, about fostering world peace and harmony. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Gary Hart's ill-fated run for the Democratic presidential  
nomination a few years ago, or even Falcons safety Eugene 
Robinson's late-night prowling on the eve of the Super Bowl a few 
weeks ago, that's practically an invitation to have people prove 
otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
	This time around, the people in charge got sloppy. They got most  
of the paperwork past the first wave of auditors, but then somebody 
besides the IOC members for whom they were intended noticed the 
Salt Lake City boosters' conspiratorial wink. Enough records turned 
up to fill out a 300-page report. 
</P>
<P>
	That attention to detail will be the undoing of a lot of people.  
When Salt Lake City's bid to host the 1998 Winter Games was beaten 
by Nagano, Japan, a few of the organizers took careful notes on 
what the IOC members carried off. They saw how much more the 
selectors prized the video recorders Nagano handed out than the 
disposable cameras they were giving away. 
</P>
<P>
	That was probably when the resolve not to be trumped again  
turned to arrogance. The Salt Lake City people had no problem 
copying Nagano's largess when they should have been copying their 
stealth instead. 
</P>
<P>
	It's roundly believed that the Japanese backers of the bid for  
those Winter Games budgeted -- and spent -- $10 million for the final 
week of the selection process, roughly $10,000 per member. The 
reason exact figures are not available, unlike Salt Lake City's 
effort, is because the records were burned. 
</P>
<P>
	Anybody who asked to see them received this official response:  
There was nothing in them that the public needed to know. That's 
why Nagano Gov. Goro Yoshimura told Kyodo News service with a 
straight face that the IOC investigation showed that the way his 
organizing committee treated IOC members was ``within the scope of 
common sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such statements by anybody connected to the Salt Lake City bid  
will raise a red flag for some time to come. The Justice 
Department, the General Accounting Office and the Utah Attorney 
General are going to be sifting through the paperwork, too much of 
it too blatant to disguise any longer. 
</P>
<P>
	Some lessons are tough to learn. Think back to that classic  
moment in ``All The President's Men'' when ``Deep Throat,'' the 
source who guides a pair of reporters trying to uncover a scandal 
that would rock the country. 
</P>
<P>
	What he said was this: ``Follow the money.''  
</P>

<HEADLINE> Defense Awards $3 Billion Space Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Air Force and the Pentagon's ballistic  
missile defense shop announced Tuesday award of the first portion 
of a $3 billion contract to research whether space-based lasers can 
shoot down long-range enemy missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense officials were careful to say the program doesn't  
violate the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty the United States has 
with Russia, which bars development of a national space-based 
missile defense system. Instead, the project will simply test 
technologies, U.S. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not Star Wars,'' said Gloria Cales, an Air Force  
spokeswoman, in a reference to former President Reagan's failed 
effort to develop such a space-based system. ``This is just the 
beginning stage of an experiment to see if space-based lasers would 
work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force program is just one of several missile defense  
research projects the Pentagon has approved, although the U.S. 
administration won't decide for another couple of years whether to 
fully develop and deploy such a system -- if scientists can get one 
to work. If a deployment decision is made, U.S. officials have 
acknowledged, the ABM treaty would need to be renegotiated. 
</P>
<P>
	When President Clinton first took office in 1993, his  
administration declared ``the end of the Star Wars era.'' Recent 
missile development by nations such as North Korea and Iran, 
however, placed fresh emphasis on the threat posed to America by 
long-range nuclear missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, Clinton sent a budget to Congress asking for $6.6  
billion over the next five years towards developing a national 
defense against missile attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans in Congress have long argued for a national missile  
defense system. 
</P>
<P>
	An industry group led by The Boeing Co., headquartered in  
Seattle, won the first $125 million installment of the $3 billion 
research contract with the Air Force and the Ballistic Missile 
Defense Organization. The two other companies on the contract team 
are Lockheed Martin Missiles and Space of Sunnyvale, Calif. and 
TRW, Inc., of Redondo Beach, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	The initial work is scheduled to be completed in 18 months to  
two years at the Air Force's Space and Missile Systems Center in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	The objective is to research the feasibility of a space-based  
laser system, develop ground, flight and space technologies and 
then conduct a demonstration, the Air Force said.

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 9.27; Nasdaq Down 9.13 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock indexes bounced around this morning as  
investors tried to decide whether to continue Tuesday's sell-off in 
computer shares. 
</P>
<P>
	At 10 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 9.27 at 9,123.76, after swinging between positive and negative 
in the first hour of trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also lower, with the Nasdaq  
composite down 9.13 at 2,301.66, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 
index down 0.35 at 1,215.79. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer stocks were mixed. Dow member IBM was up 1 1/2 at 164 1/4.  
</P>
<P>
	And while Nasdaq stocks were led lower by Dell Computer, down 3  
53/64 at 93 63/64, computer leader Cisco Systems was up 1 at 96 
15/16, and Microsoft was up 11/16 at 160 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow industrials were led lower by Philip Morris, down 1  
13/16 at 43 9/16. A jury awarded $1.5 million to a California woman 
who sued Philip Morris for negligence, liability and fraud tied to 
her smoking-related cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the Dow fell 158.08, or 1.7 percent, to close at  
9,133.03, and the Nasdaq composite lost 94.13, or 3.91 percent, to 
close at 2,310.79. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by nearly 3 to 2 on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 88.22 million shares, 
off from Tuesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average declined 0.36 percent.  
European markets fell sharply for the second day in a row, with 
Germany's DAX index down 2.85 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 
1.16 percent, and France's CAC-40 was down 1.6 percent in midday 
trading.

<HEADLINE> Virginia Now the Place for Trash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- After years of promoting itself as a place  
for lovers, Virginia is getting a trashier reputation. 
</P>
<P>
	With cheap land and good roads, the state has become a magnet  
for out-of-state garbage. Cash-strapped localities also need money 
for schools and other services, and industrial prospects are hard 
to come by. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Gov. Jim Gilmore has made cutting garbage imports a  
top priority of the General Assembly session, which ends Feb. 27. 
Virginia landfills took about 3.2 million tons of out-of-state 
garbage in 1997, second only to Pennsylvania, and the amount is 
growing. 
</P>
<P>
	``My administration is taking decisive action to prevent the  
commonwealth from becoming the nation's dumping grounds,'' Gilmore 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But some municipalities like getting dumped on, for the money.  
</P>
<P>
	Mary Jones is the administrator of Sussex County, which has  
reaped $12.3 million from Atlantic Waste Disposal's landfill since 
it opened in 1994. She says as long as the trash is not an 
environmental threat, Gilmore should butt out. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has always been a local issue,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Waste Management Inc. wants to start shipping garbage to  
Virginia by barge in late spring for disposal at a company-owned 
landfill in Charles City County, a rural county east of Richmond 
with many historic James River plantations. The Houston-based 
company already is hauling about 2,400 tons of New York City 
garbage a day, much of it to Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani angered  
Virginia officials by suggesting that other states have a duty to 
haul away city garbage since out-of-towners take advantage of the 
Big Apple's resources. 
</P>
<P>
	Waste Management spokeswoman Jewel Sikes said there are many  
factors that make Virginia an attractive receptacle. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's well located, within ease of transportation,'' she said.  
``The communities were very willing to host these sites and get the 
fees associated with them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Eddie Perry, pastor of St. John's Baptist Church in  
Charles City County, said Waste Management's landfill has been the 
community's economic lifeline. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone wants to say no to trash, but you don't see industry  
breaking down the doors to come to Charles City County,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	County officials say they would not have been able to build a  
$22.5 million school complex in 1994 without the trash money. The 
county earned more than $3.7 million -- nearly one-fourth of its $16 
million budget -- from landfill revenues last year.

<HEADLINE> Potato Blight Threatens Colo. Crops / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTE VISTA, Colo. (AP) -- Late blight, the fungus that caused  
the Irish potato famine 150 years ago, is now threatening producers 
in southern Colorado's San Luis Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	The valley was the last potato-growing region of the United  
States to have escaped the blight since it devastated Ireland in 
1845. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a very serious issue facing our industry,'' Colorado  
State University extension specialist Richard Zink said. ``We'll 
all have to work together to get ahead of it. Once you've seen it, 
you'll never forget it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last summer, the blight, which has been causing problems for  
some Idaho growers, appeared in the valley for the first time, 
affecting more than 75,000 acres of cropland. 
</P>
<P>
	The fungus, which breeds beneath the warm, moist canopy of the  
potato plant's leaves, can be controlled using chemicals. To save 
the potatoes, crop dusters were kept busy from dawn to dusk. 
</P>
<P>
	The efforts were successful. A near-record crop of more than 2.5  
billion pounds worth $100 million was harvested last October. 
</P>
<P>
	No large-scale losses were reported last year, but nearly every  
San Luis Valley field was affected. Growers spent millions of 
dollars on chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
	Zinc said late blight-infected seed potatoes probably will be  
planted this year and growers will not realize their crop is 
infected until July, when it is too late to plant another crop. 
</P>
<P>
	For the third year in a row, the valley will be quarantined by  
state and federal officials, who will inspect every incoming load 
of seed potatoes. 
</P>

	DECATUR, Ill. (AP) -- First, the bad news: You still need to work  
to pay the mortgage, the car loan and taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	But the good news is that the grocery bill is paid in full.  
</P>
<P>
	As of this week, the average American already had earned enough  
money to pay for food for the entire year, according to the 
Illinois Farm Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most Americans don't have any other experience of the cost of  
food elsewhere,'' said Randy D. Prince, executive vice president of 
the Macon County Farm Bureau. ``Food is cheap here compared to 
other countries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Americans spend an average of 11 percent of their disposable  
personal income on food, according to the latest statistics 
compiled by the U.S. Agriculture Department's Economic Research 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
	Disposable income is defined as the portion of money available  
for spending or saving, and 11 percent of the year had passed as of 
early this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rather than being an economic burden, shopping for food is  
seen as enjoyable,'' said David Patton, special activities manager 
for the Illinois Farm Bureau. ``That's the way it should be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The percentage of disposable personal income spent for food has  
been steadily declining over the past 25 years, Patton said. That's 
despite a trend toward Americans buying more expensive convenience 
foods for preparation at home and eating out more often, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stacey Hoadley, a Decatur mother who buys food for six people,  
said she is grateful for such reasonable prices even though she 
spends $125 every week or two. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel fortunate to live in a country where we don't have to  
struggle to get food,'' Hoadley said as she wheeled her grocery 
cart down an aisle. 
</P>
<P>
	But she still searches for bargains and coupons.  
</P>
<P>
	``Even though it may be affordable, prices keep going up,''  
Hoadley said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Agriculture Department's figures include food and  
nonalcoholic beverages consumed at home and away from home.

	Judge Orders Pilots To Halt Sickout  
</P>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- A federal judge today ordered pilots at American  
Airlines to end a sickout that has grounded hundreds of flights and 
stranded an estimated 200,000 travelers. U.S. District Judge Joe 
Kendall chided both sides in issuing the temporary restraining 
order and told them to resume negotiating. ``It's silly for us to 
even be here,'' he said. ``It's like killing a gnat with a sledge 
hammer.'' Kendall told the pilots to return to work tomorrow and 
warned they could be held in contempt if they don't. ``If you would 
look up bad labor relations in the dictionary, you would have an 
American Airlines logo beside it,'' Kendall said.

	Prices Rise on Midwest Houses  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Midwestern cities recorded some of the biggest  
increases in existing home prices in the nation last year while 
cities in the Northeast registered some of the smallest gains and 
some outright declines. Nationally, the median resale price -- 
meaning half sold for more and half for less -- was $131,000 during 
the October-December quarter, up 4.9 percent from the same quarter 
a year earlier, the National Association of Realtors said today. 
The figure compares to a fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter gain in 
consumer prices of 1.5 percent. The Realtors said median prices of 
existing homes rose faster than that inflation rate in 102 of 129 
metropolitan areas.

	Kodak Recalls Some Camera Adapters  
</P>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Eastman Kodak Co. said today it is  
recalling 120,000 AC adapters for digital cameras due to an 
electrical problem that could cause camera batteries to leak acid 
and explode. The company said it knows of three incidents when 
batteries in digital cameras have overheated and discharged acid 
while the adapters were in use. In one case, a man reported 
suffering minor burns. The problems occurred when the connector 
plug of the AC adapter was not fully inserted into the cameras, 
Kodak said. The adapters were manufactured by ELPAC Electronics 
Inc., of Irvine, Calif., and sold separately as authorized 
accessories for Kodak digital cameras. They were sold nationwide 
between March 1996 and August 1998 under the model numbers 2534, 
2457, MI2008 and M42008.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Microsoft Vice President Brad Chase, in  
written testimony released today, defended the company's limits on 
the world's largest Internet provider that discouraged distribution 
of a rival's software. Chase insisted that under an important March 
1996 agreement, America Online's 16 million subscribers still are 
free to download and use rival Internet software from Netscape 
Communications Corp. He acknowledged that Microsoft's AOL deal -- 
which continues until Jan. 1, 2001 -- requires that at least 85 
percent of AOL's customers use Microsoft's own ``Internet 
Explorer.'' But he said Microsoft didn't require AOL to actually 
prevent its subscribers from using Netscape's software. Microsoft 
instead set limits on ways AOL could give away Netscape's browser.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Last minute buying lifted the Dow Jones  
industrial average into positive territory today, but a recovery in 
the shares of large technology companies failed to ignite the rest

	Chicago Auto Show Offers New Models  
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Toyota Motor Corp. showed off its challenge to  
Mazda's Miata and the expected revival of Nissan's Z-car on 
Wednesday: the MR-Spyder, a mid-engine, open-air roadster that will 
go on sale in the United States in early 2000. It will replace the 
MR2, a hardtop sports car that remains on sale in Japan but was 
removed from the North American market in 1995 because of slow 
sales. Toyota unveiled a concept version of the new car at the 
Chicago Auto Show's media preview. Other new models include the 
redesigned 2000 Pontiac Bonneville sedan, Nissan's redesigned 
Maxima sedan, and a convertible version of Toyota's Camry Solara 
coupe.

<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar surged against the yen Wednesday as  
investors were reassured by Brazil's pledge to take responsibility 
for its Eurobond debt payment. Japanese stocks closed mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 115.30 yen in late afternoon trading, up 0.60  
yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo and well above its late New York 
level of 114.39 yen overnight. It ranged from 113.73 yen to 115.50 
yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 49.74  
points, or 0.36 percent, to close at 13,952.40. On Tuesday, the 
average closed down 89.83 points, or 0.64 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar dipped early Wednesday on  
reports that the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais would not honor a 
Eurobond debt payment, due later Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But subsequent news that the Brazilian government had reiterated  
a pledge to cover the remainder of the state's Eurobond debt 
encouraged Japanese investors and trust banks to buy back dollars. 
Interbank players bought the currency to cover their short, or 
oversold, dollar positions. 
</P>
<P>
	Unconfirmed speculation that a large Japanese brokerage has  
incurred huge losses also helped to trigger a burst of dollar 
buying against the yen, pushing up the value of the greenback.

	Meanwhile, the euro was traded at 130.22 yen, up from 129.68 yen  
late Tuesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, prices were mixed as players  
awaited key economic and market events scheduled for later in the 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	The market remained weaker most of the day following a steep  
drop in U.S. stocks overnight. But gains in bond prices and the 
dollar's rebound helped buoy prices late in the afternoon session, 
traders said.

<P>
	Many investors refrained from active trading ahead of a Bank of  
Japan board meeting on Friday and testimony Thursday by U.S. 
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, they said.

<HEADLINE> Browns Load Up on Linemen, DBs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANTON, Ohio (AP) -- The Cleveland Browns showed their football  
smarts in the NFL expansion draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Playing within the rules established by the league, they picked  
37 players -- only one older than 30 years old -- but used up only 
$18.062 million in salary cap room, leaving them with $39 million 
to spend in the free-agent market. 
</P>
<P>
	They stocked their offensive line with a mixture of youngsters  
and proven veterans, big guys who can protect a quarterback like 
Tim Couch or open holes for a running back like Ricky Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	They selected 10 defensive backs, many of whom also played on  
special teams on their previous teams. And following a rule of good 
theater, the Browns finished with a bang to send their fans home 
smiling. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're young. We're cap-friendly. We're energetic. I think  
we've covered our bases,'' Browns president Carmen Policy said. 
</P>
<P>
	It appears so.  
</P>
<P>
	Surrounded by bronzed Hall of Fame busts of Jim Brown, Lou Groza  
and Leroy Kelly, the Browns entered the next phase of their NFL 
return by picking more no-name players on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Priming for the Browns' return this season after a three-year  
absence, Cleveland selected Detroit center Jim Pyne with its first 
pick, and then capped its day with the surprising selection of 
Antonio Langham, a former Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	Drafting Pyne No. 1 set the tone for a draft in which the Browns  
spent wisely -- only two players have salary cap costs over $1 
million -- and loaded up on young players with upside potential. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland bypassed bigger-named players in order to save money  
in the short-term while being successful well into the millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not trying to impress anybody in '99,'' said Dwight  
Clark, the Browns' director of football operations. ``We're not 
going to mortgage our future and spend a lot of cap money and cash 
on guys that we think the arrow's pointing down on. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were some good players that we could have taken that  
would have probably helped us win some games next year, but then 
we're out trying to fill those spots. So we want to get some guys 
we thought we could mold into the type of players that can help us 
down the line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the 10 d-backs and nine offensive lineman, the  
Browns picked up five linebackers, four running backs, four wide 
receivers, four defensive lineman, and one quarterback, Tampa Bay's 
Scott Milanovich. 
</P>
<P>
	The average expansion player is 25.6 years old and has a cap  
value of $502,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL required the Browns to take 30 to 42 players or spend 38  
percent ($21.77 million) of their salary cap ($57.288 million) on 
players they took in the expansion draft. So although they can't 
compete on the field, being frugal will allow the Browns to compete 
off it. 
</P>
<P>
	They can begin signing free agents on Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	``We should have a tidy sum available for free agency,'' Policy  
said, putting his arm around Al Lerner, Cleveland's billionaire 
owner. 
</P>
<P>
	The expansion draft went about as well as the Browns could have  
hoped. Clark said the team only had to adjust its wish list three 
times when teams pulled back players. 
</P>
<P>
	Pyne, 27, started all 16 games for the Lions last season after  
spending his first three years with Tampa Bay. His versatility made 
him attractive to the Browns, as did his salary cap number of 
$1.885 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland chose to use its last pick to take Langham despite his  
$3.02 million cost against the cap. The Browns feel he can regain 
the form that made him one of the league's top corners and because 
Langham's agent has agreed to rework the player's contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was a special pick for us,'' Clark said. ``And Antonio  
wanted to come back here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A former first-round draft pick by the Browns from Alabama,  
Langham, 26, lost his starting job this season with the 49ers. 
Clark, however, thinks Langham's problems are more mental than 
physical. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure he wants to admit this, but it's a total lack of  
confidence,'' Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland invited its first five picks -- Pyne, Dallas defensive  
end Hurvin McCormack, New England tackle Scott Rehberg, Cincinnati 
wide receiver Damon Gibson and San Francisco center Steve Gordon -- 
to the event, and each was greeted with a rousing ovation as they 
made their way to the Canton Civic Center stage to be presented a 
Browns cap by Policy and Lerner. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't wait to play in front of the Dawg Pound,'' Gibson  
said. ``I want to beat Cincinnati now. Nothing personal, that's 
just the way it is. I'm a Cleveland Brown now.''

<HEADLINE> Atempts To Set Ore. Ship Afire Fail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COOS BAY, Ore. (AP) -- Navy demolition experts with grenades  
failed to set fire to a grounded cargo ship Wednesday night, 
leaving it vulnerable to an advancing storm that threatened to 
break it apart and cause a disastrous oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
	Flames flickered and black smoke billowed out of the New  
Carissa, but within seconds the only thing burning aboard the 
639-foot ship was a small smoldering fire in one cargo hold. 
</P>
<P>
	Coast Guard officials had said that burning the ship could be  
like lighting a barbecue grill -- it could take several tries to get 
the heavy, low-grade oil to burn. Chief Gene Maestas said there 
would be no more attempts to ignite the oil Wednesday night because 
of the darkness. 
</P>
<P>
	Setting the ship ablaze in the breakers was a desperation move  
to spare Oregon beaches from the tarlike bunker fuel remaining 
inside the ship. Authorities concluded they couldn't move it before 
a storm expected to hit late Wednesday with 70 mph gusts. Already, 
cracks in the hull of the ship have leaked oil over miles of 
coastline. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are significantly concerned the ship will not stay  
together,'' said Coast Guard Capt. Mike Hall. ``We're between a 
rock and a hard spot. If we don't do something now we would have to 
stand before you and tell you why we let 400,000 gallons of oil 
spill on our beaches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Demolition experts attempted to get the fire going with buckets  
of gasoline and incendiary grenades detonated by remote control. 
Huge cargo hatches on the deck were removed and the fuel tanks were 
blown open to help the fire burn faster. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's about what I expected -- a small flash, a little smoke and  
it went out,'' said Bob Graham, a retired truck driver, part of a 
crowd of people who waited for hours on the bluffs to see the 
blaze. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the fire is started, it could take a couple of days to burn  
off the fuel. Afterward the charred steel hull will be hauled to 
the beach, cut up and removed. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said such burns have been conducted safely in Alaska  
and other parts of the world. 
</P>
<P>
	The ship, owned by a Japanese company and registered in Panama  
with a crew of 23 Filipinos, ran aground last Thursday 150 yards 
offshore. It was coming into port to pick up a load of wood chips. 
</P>
<P>
	Pounding surf opened up cracks in its steel hull Monday, and  
three of the ship's five fuel tanks, containing 140,000 gallons, 
ruptured, causing streaking oil along six miles of beach. 
</P>
<P>
	The ship is aground in an area known as the Leberti Hole,  
considered a prime crab-fishing area. It is near the habitat of the 
Western snowy plover, a threatened shorebird. 
</P>
<P>
	About 200 people mobilized along the southern Oregon Coast to  
clean up the goo. Several birds have been found coated with fuel.

<HEADLINE>  Europe Hit by Heavy Snowstorm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHAMONIX, France (AP) -- Two avalanches roared down a  
mountainside in the French Alps, burying chalets and killing at 
least 10 people, police said today. Heavy snow fell in other parts 
of Europe, forcing evacuations and stranding thousands in 
Switzerland, Austria and Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	With at least two people missing, rescue workers were searching  
through the snow that blanketed the area just north of the popular 
ski resort of Chamonix, about 30 miles southeast of Geneva. Unable 
to reach the villages by vehicle or helicopter, the rescue workers 
resorted to skis. 
</P>
<P>
	``People can survive for a long time under the snow,'' said  
Blaise Agresti, commander of a mountain police brigade. ``In the 
mountains, it is important that we never give up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The avalanches barreled down the mountainside near the villages  
of Le Tour and Montroc-le-Planet, destroying 17 chalets and burying 
others under deep snow. 
</P>
<P>
	``The scene was spectacular,'' said Jean-Marie Pavy, 49, who was  
staying in a chalet just outside the avalanche's path. ``The chalet 
next to ours disappeared -- it was pushed across the road. There 
were blocks of cement and gravel everywhere. It was the 
apocalypse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The victims included four children, three men and three women,  
police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, about 20 people were pulled out of the snow alive,  
including at least eight children and one man who spent hours 
trapped before being rescued. Two survivors were from the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, rescue workers today renewed their search for a  
28-year-old British skier in the French Alps resort of Courchevel. 
The skier, who was not identified, was skiing off marked trails 
Tuesday when hit by an avalanche. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, up to 16 inches of snow fell in parts of the Swiss  
Alps overnight and the danger of avalanches remained high. 
</P>
<P>
	In parts of the Austrian province of Tyrol, thousands of people  
remained trapped by record snowfall, with some unable to leave for 
the fifth day, and snow continued fall in much of Austria. 
</P>
<P>
	An avalanche in northwestern Romania blocked a major highway  
after hours of heavy snow, but no injuries were reported, the 
Romanian Interior Ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
	Snow was expected to taper off in the Alps, however, and the sky  
was clear in Chamonix this morning. Ski runs were closed in the 
French Alps resort, and hundreds of skiers were trying to leave the 
town in buses and cars to find open slopes. 
</P>
<P>
	The avalanches came during the first week of the annual French  
school winter holidays. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's horrible,'' said Jean-Louis Verdier, deputy mayor of  
Chamonix. ``There is nothing left. Everything was wiped away. Where 
the chalets should be, there is a big hole.''

<HEADLINE>  Europe Hit by Heavy Snowstorm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHAMONIX, France (AP) -- Two avalanches roared down a  
mountainside in the French Alps, burying chalets and killing at 
least 10 people, police said today. Heavy snow fell in other parts 
of Europe, forcing evacuations and stranding thousands in 
Switzerland, Austria and Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	With at least two people missing, rescue workers were searching  
through the snow that blanketed the area just north of the popular 
ski resort of Chamonix, about 30 miles southeast of Geneva. Unable 
to reach the villages by vehicle or helicopter, the rescue workers 
resorted to skis. 
</P>
<P>
	``People can survive for a long time under the snow,'' said  
Blaise Agresti, commander of a mountain police brigade. ``In the 
mountains, it is important that we never give up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The avalanches barreled down the mountainside near the villages  
of Le Tour and Montroc-le-Planet, destroying 17 chalets and burying

<HEADLINE> Defense Presents Minister's Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARGO, Fla. (AP) -- Members of the Rev. Henry Lyons' black church  
group don't believe he misused funds or abused his power as 
president of the National Baptist Convention USA, several ministers 
testified Wednesday as Lyons' defense began. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons is on trial with his alleged mistress, Bernice Edwards, on  
racketeering charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Edward V. Hill told jurors he led a convention ethics  
commission that investigated Lyons' conduct. It focused only on 
whether he stole money from its treasuries, not on his deals with 
corporations seeking to do business with the group. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't want to go any further,'' Hill said.  
</P>
<P>
	After issuing a report saying they found no evidence Lyons stole  
from the treasury, the convention's members voted to keep Lyons as 
president and adopted a resolution supporting him. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics commission was formed after Florida prosecutors began  
investigating Lyons' finances in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	He and Ms. Edwards are accused of swindling more than $4 million  
from companies hoping to sell cemetery products, life insurance 
policies and credit cards to the convention's members. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers say the failed business deals are not criminal  
matters. They spent much of Wednesday presenting testimony from 
convention ministers who said they believe Lyons has the right to 
earn profit from his post as president and to spend the money as he 
chooses. 
</P>
<P>
	``I cannot think of anything he did under this administration  
that the previous presidents did not have the privilege to do,'' 
said the Rev. Lacy Curry.

<HEADLINE> Saints' Ditka To Get Heart Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- New Orleans Saints coach Mike Ditka wants to  
be sure the fluttering of his heart was not an indication of 
anything more serious than an irregular heartbeat. 
</P>
<P>
	Ditka planned to have further tests to follow up on the  
emergency treatment he received last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to get an angiogram, and then make sure I don't have  
any blockage,'' Ditka said. ``If I have blockage, then I have to 
get done what has to be done whether they have to bypass it or 
whatever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ditka, 59, had a heart attack in 1988. A mild electric shock was  
administered to his heart on Feb. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``It went out of rhythm, and I had to get it shocked back into  
rhythm,'' Ditka told Chicago reporters before returning to New 
Orleans on Wednesday. ``But I feel pretty good. I've been working 
out every day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ditka has also been working everyday, Saints general manager  
Bill Kuharich said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That happened last week and he's been in here every day same  
as always,'' Kuharich said on Wednesday. ``It hasn't had any affect 
on him that I can see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ditka said the experience of his old friend, Dan Reeves, head  
coach of the Atlanta Falcons, made him cautious despite his lack of 
problems. Reeves had quadruple bypass surgery Dec. 14, one day 
after experiencing unusual sensations in his neck and chest during 
a game against Ditka and the Saints in the Superdome. 
</P>
<P>
	Ditka experienced a fluttering sensation in his chest about two  
weeks ago during the week preceding Super Bowl, Ditka's wife, 
Diana, said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ditka was examined by a New Orleans cardiologist recommended by  
Saints team physician Dr. Charles Brown, and the irregular 
heartbeat was detected.

<HEADLINE> Police Handcuff Episcopal Priest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Episcopal bishop of Los Angeles expressed  
frustration with police after a priest in full vestments was 
handcuffed and detained just yards away from his church. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident happened Jan. 7 as police pursued two black men  
after reports that someone was wielding a gun on a street corner. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Donald Culmer, who is black, stepped out of his church  
after morning services and confronted one of the men. Four police 
officers surrounded both Culmer and the suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	Culmer said he was ordered to drop to his knees and handcuffed  
in front of his parishioners. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is stunning to me that the police were evidently not able  
to recognize the full priestly vestments in which this priest was 
dressed,'' Bishop Frederick Borsch said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Culmer said he was released about two minutes after he was  
handcuffed, after parishioners and the church secretary told police 
they had the wrong man. One officer was Asian, two were Hispanic 
and one was American Indian. 
</P>
<P>
	``They dusted him off and sent him on his way,'' said Los  
Angeles police Cmdr. David Kalish. ``This does not appear to be a 
racial incident, it was a police incident. But we apologize for any 
misunderstandings or embarrassments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The officers were operating under the assumption that the  
suspect may have had time to put the robes on, Kalish said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They didn't know who was who,'' Kalish said.

<HEADLINE> Bush Urged To Run for President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Current and past Republican members of  
Congress announced a campaign Wednesday to persuade George W. Bush 
to run for president, saying the Texas governor's ``compassionate'' 
message will resonate with voters. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is the one that will appeal to the broadest spectrum of  
Americans,'' said former Rep. Gerald Solomon, R-N.Y., chairman of 
the Draft Bush 2000 Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that, by far, George Bush represents the best  
candidate the Republican Party can put forward for president next 
year,'' added former Rep. Guy Molinari, R-N.Y., president of the 
New York borough of Staten Island. 
</P>
<P>
	Solomon said about 75 people from all factions of the party  
attended a Capitol Hill meeting Tuesday, where they had a 
``serious, thoughtful discussion about the appeal of Governor Bush 
and his compassionate conservative message nationwide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Solomon, now a Washington lobbyist, said Bush's campaign slogan  
of ``compassionate conservatism'' -- which has been criticized by 
other Republicans with an eye on the presidency -- can attract 
women, minorities and young people. 
</P>
<P>
	``A message of inclusion is one which the Republican Party needs  
to put forward,'' added Rep. David Dreier, R-Calif., chairman of 
the House Rules Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has said he will decide by early April whether to enter the  
race. 
</P>
<P>
	Among likely GOP presidential candidates, he shares top billing  
with Elizabeth Dole, the former Red Cross president who also is 
exploring a possible candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot wait to begin the organization when he makes that  
decision so we are going to help him,'' said Rep. Pete Sessions, 
R-Texas, who is in charge of enlisting current House members for 
the effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Molinari will focus on retired members.

<HEADLINE> Oscar Looks Abroad for Nominees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- America's tight grip on the golden statuette  
is slipping, with Academy Award voters looking abroad for many of 
this year's Oscar nominees. 
</P>
<P>
	All five best picture nominees were set abroad: the bittersweet  
Holocaust tale ``Life Is Beautiful'' from Italy; the Renaissance 
England duo ``Shakespeare in Love'' and ``Elizabeth;'' and the 
World War II battle films ``Saving Private Ryan'' and ``The Thin 
Red Line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign-born actresses got the lion's share of Tuesday's  
nominations: Cate Blanchett, ``Elizabeth''; Fernanda Montenegro, 
``Central Station''; Emily Watson and Rachel Griffiths, ``Hilary 
and Jackie''; Brenda Blethyn, ``Little Voice''; Judi Dench, 
``Shakespeare in Love''; and Lynn Redgrave, ``Gods and Monsters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just three of the 10 actress nominees are American: Gwyneth  
Paltrow of ``Shakespeare in Love,'' Meryl Streep of ``One True 
Thing'' and Kathy Bates from ``Primary Colors.'' Paltrow and Streep 
were nominated for best actress, Bates for best supporting actress. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the big Hollywood studios' dominance of the awards has  
eroded in recent years, most of them retain bragging rights -- and a 
cut of the box office take -- because their subsidiaries release 
foreign and specialized films that are often in Oscar contention. 
</P>
<P>
	Many films this year were co-productions by big studios --  
``Saving Private Ryan'' was produced by DreamWorks and Paramount, 
while ``Shakespeare in Love'' was financed by Miramax and 
Universal. 
</P>
<P>
	Miramax, which released ``Life Is Beautiful'' and ``Shakespeare  
in Love,'' belongs to Disney. Gramercy, which released 
``Elizabeth,'' is now owned by Universal. 
</P>
<P>
	The best actor nominees were a mix of Americans -- Edward Norton,  
``American History X,'' Nick Nolte, ``Affliction'' and Tom Hanks, 
``Saving Private Ryan'' -- and foreign-born stars, Italy's Roberto 
Benigni, ``Life Is Beautiful,'' and England's Ian McKellen, ``Gods 
and Monsters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The supporting actor nominees were mostly Americans: James  
Coburn, ``Affliction''; Robert Duvall, ``A Civil Action''; Ed 
Harris, ``The Truman Show''; and Billy Bob Thornton, ``A Simple 
Plan.'' The Australian actor Geoffrey Rush also was nominated in 
this category for ``Shakespeare in Love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two Americans won nominations for direction: Steven Spielberg,  
``Saving Private Ryan'' and Terrence Malick, ``The Thin Red Line.'' 
The others were Benigni, Australian Peter Weir for ``The Truman 
Show'' and England's John Madden for ``Shakespeare in Love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, ``The Truman Show,'' much praised for its  
originality, was overlooked for best picture and for its leading 
man, Jim Carrey. This might bear out the old saying that if you're 
looking for an Oscar, don't release your film early in the year: 
``Truman'' was released in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Other notable omissions include Michael Caine, who won a best  
actor Golden Globe for ``Little Voice''; Susan Sarandon as best 
actress for ``Stepmom''; and Joseph Fiennes as best actor for 
``Shakespeare in Love.''

<HEADLINE> Bill Can Block Costs for Businesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In its first major legislative action of the  
year, the House approved, in a bipartisan vote on Wednesday, a bill 
that would make it tougher for the federal government to impose new 
costs on businesses and consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, giving lawmakers a parliamentary tool to block laws  
and regulations that add to private sector costs, passed 274-149, 
with 67 Democrats joining 207 Republicans in support. It faces an 
uncertain future in the Senate and opposition from the Clinton 
administration, which says it does not properly balance the costs 
of legislation with intended benefits to the public. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Mandates Information Act,'' authored by Reps. Gary Condit,  
D-Calif., and Rob Portman, R-Ohio, requires congressional 
committees and the Congressional Budget Office to report on how 
legislation affects consumers, workers and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	It allows lawmakers to raise a parliamentary objection called a  
point of order to any bill that the CBO has not studied or which 
costs the private sector more than $100 million in a year. 
</P>
<P>
	A point of order prompts a 20-minute debate, and if sustained,  
can effectively kill a bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``This bill does not stop legislative mandates,'' Condit said in  
debate that began last week. ``All the bill does is allow us to 
accumulate more information ... so we hopefully can make better 
decisions on behalf of the people we represent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation expands the unfunded mandate act, a central  
piece of the House GOP's ``Contract with America,'' which passed 
Congress in 1995. That law requires cost analyses of laws or 
regulations but allows points of order only on those measures that 
cost the public sector more than $50 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the new bill pointed out that there had been only  
seven points of order resulting from the 1995 act, and in each case 
the House decided to move forward with the bill despite the costs 
to state or local governments. 
</P>
<P>
	The Condit-Portman bill had strong backing from business groups:  
``Often, legislators don't take into account how tough it can be 
for businesses, particularly small businesses, to absorb government 
mandates,'' said Herman Cain, CEO and president of the National 
Restaurant Association. 
</P>
<P>
	But the consumer group Public Citizen, reflecting the opposition  
of consumer and environmental organizations, said it would allow 
Congress ``to hide behind a procedural vote to torpedo vital 
legislation with strong public support.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House defeated, by 216-203, an amendment by Rep. Henry  
Waxman, D-Calif., that would have allowed members to raise similar 
objections to bills that could weaken existing health, safety and 
environmental laws. 
</P>
<P>
	It also rejected, 216-210, an amendment by Rep. Sherwood  
Boehlert, R-N.Y., a leading GOP environmentalist, that would have 
made it more difficult to raise points of order and stated that 
such objections could not cut off debate on a bill. 
</P>
<P>
	A nearly identical bill passed the House last year by 279-132,  
but was not taken up by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican leadership has touted the bill as an example of  
its attempt to offer legislation that appeals to both parties, but 
Clinton administration officials saw it differently. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration, in a statement, said it recognized the need  
for good cost analyses but opposed the bill, saying it created an 
obstacle to needed legislation by ``considering only the costs and 
none of the benefits of legislation that protects human health, 
safety, the environment or the nation's economic well-being.''

<HEADLINE> Mets Sign Wendell for $1,200,000.99 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- As Mark Grudzielanek and Johnny Damon went to  
salary arbitration, Turk Wendell agreed to one of the oddest 
contracts ever -- in terms of numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	The quirky reliever, who wears uniform No. 99, avoided  
arbitration Wednesday when he agreed with the New York Mets on a 
one-year contract worth $1,200,000.99. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to his base salary, Wendell can earn three bonuses  
of $4,999 if he pitches in 67, 68 and 69 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love 99, so why not?'' Wendell said. ``I want to have as  
many 99s in my contract as possible. It has to give me good luck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wendell, who made $661,000 last year, also can earn a $17,500  
bonus for finishing 45 games, which is unlikely to happen because 
John Franco is the Mets' closer. Wendell also can earn $17,500 if 
he's selected for the NL All-Star team. 
</P>
<P>
	Wendell, a 31-year-old right-hander, was 5-1 with four saves and  
a 2.93 ERA in 66 games last season. He broke a team record 
previously held by Jesse Orosco when he appeared in nine 
consecutive games last September. 
</P>
<P>
	New York had submitted a $1.05 million figure in salary  
arbitration and Wendell had asked for $1,575,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Grudzielanek, a Los Angeles Dodgers infielder eligible for  
arbitration for the first time, asked for a raise from $350,000 to 
$2.6 million, while the team countered at $1.9 million. Arbitrator 
Nicholas Zumas is expected to issue his decision Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Grudzielanek, 28, was acquired from Montreal last July 31, and  
hit a combined .272 last season with 10 homers and 62 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Damon, also eligible for the first time, asked a three-man panel  
for a raise from $460,000 to $3.2 million. Kansas City offered $2.1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Damon, 25, hit .277 last year with 18 homers, 66 RBIs and 26  
steals. His case will be decided by Mort Mitchnick, Roger Abrams 
and Roger Kaplan. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners won the first two cases of the year, beating Boston  
outfielder Midre Cummings and Montreal infielder Shane Andrews on 
Tuesday. Panels, rather than single arbitrators, decided both those 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixteen players remain in arbitration, with hearings scheduled  
through Feb. 19.

<HEADLINE> HS Reading Tests Show Improvement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For the first time in almost a decade,  
American students are starting to read better: High school seniors 
show the biggest improvement, but even younger children are 
catching up, the Education Department said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's students had been lagging in reading, even as their  
math and science scores advanced. 
</P>
<P>
	``Reading is the starting point for all learning,'' Vice  
President Al Gore said as he announced reading scores from the 1998 
National Assessment of Educational Progress, a set of federally 
mandated tests. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of the excitement about the information superhighway is  
for naught if the words on the screen are incomprehensible,'' Gore 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the tests, a random group of pupils at three grade levels --  
fourth, eighth and 12th -- had to read and answer questions about 
works ranging from poetry to a 1040EZ income-tax form. 
</P>
<P>
	Many educators point out that, despite improvement, an alarming  
number of U.S. schoolchildren still cannot read at a basic grade 
level. 
</P>
<P>
	``We live in an age drenched in media and information, but many  
of our children can't read,'' said Rep. Bill Goodling, R-Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	Students have gained steadily in NAEP math and science scores  
since about 1980, after declines in the 1970s. The first NAEP 
reading test was given in 1971, but content and scoring were 
changed in 1992. During the 1970s and 80s, reading scores 
fluctuated only slightly, unlike the decreases throughout most of 
the 1990s and this year's increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a rise in their test scores, poor, central-city and  
minority children still scored lower on average than other 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	And children who spent more time reading with their families and  
less time watching television still scored better than other 
students. 
</P>
<P>
	Such quality time with young children is the key to rising  
reading test scores, said Emelie Parker, a first-grade teacher from 
Falls Church, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	``We give our children time to learn how to crawl, to walk, to  
throw a ball,'' said Parker, a 16-year classroom veteran who has 
written articles on teaching reading. ``We need to give them the 
time to learn how to read. 
</P>
<P>
	``So often a child who has never held a crayon or a pencil comes  
to class and sits next to a child who has read for years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the reading test, pupils at fourth-, eighth- and 12th-grade  
levels are tested about every two to four years through a national 
sample of about 31,000 public and private school students. The most 
recent previous reading test was in 1994, before that 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	The reading test includes multiple-choice questions and requires  
pupils to write responses in their own words ranging from a 
sentence or two to more than a paragraph. It measures a student's 
ability to read for literary experience, to gain information and to 
perform a task. 
</P>
<P>
	Pupils are scored on four levels that reflect expert judgment  
about what they should know and be able to do in specific grades. 
The levels are below basic, for the poorest performers; basic, for 
students who meet at least some fundemental skills needed for the 
grade; proficient, for those who show strong work for their grade 
levels; and advanced, for superior performers. 
</P>
<P>
	On the 1998 test:  
</P>
<P>
	--Among 12th-graders, 23 percent scored below basic level, 37  
percent reached basic level, 35 percent were proficient and 6 
percent scored at the advanced level. All levels were improved from 
the 1994 results. 
</P>
<P>
	--Among 8th-graders, 26 percent scored below basic level, 41  
percent reached basic level, 31 percent were proficient and 3 
percent scored at the advanced level. Those reflected improvements 
from 1994 at all levels but advanced. 
</P>
<P>
	--Among 4th-graders, 38 percent scored below basic level, 32  
reached basic level, 24 percent were proficient and 7 percent 
scored at the advanced level. Again, all levels were improved from 
1994 except advanced. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am encouraged by the direction of the reading results and  
perhaps the unprecedented emphasis on reading,'' said Mark D. 
Musick, who chairs the National Assessment Governing Board that 
sets the test standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Education Secretary Richard W. Riley said the scores highlight  
the good done by the Clinton administration's reading initiatives 
begun in the last few years. Goodling, however, said the results 
showed Clinton's education ideas are failing. 
</P>
<P>
	State-by-state results will be released next month. States where  
pupils performed poorly in the 1994 tests already are working on a 
fix. For example, Utah lawmakers are sending money to the 
University of Utah to train reading specialists to go into schools.

<HEADLINE> Therapist Convicted of Child Porn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME, N.Y. (AP) -- A psychotherapist facing four years in prison  
for possessing child pornography says he was collecting the 
material for research and is concerned about the impact his 
conviction will have on colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will have a chilling effect, if not completely halt any  
legitimate research in the area of child pornography on the 
Internet,'' said Paul V. Fraser, 53. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraser has appealed his Jan. 29 conviction, defense attorney  
Mark Wolber said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraser was caught in June with an extensive collection of child  
pornography in his computer files. He said the materials were for 
his work with a volunteer county committee called the Pornography 
Interdiction Work Group and that the district attorney's office 
knew what he was doing. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraser came to the attention of authorities after he took his  
computer into a repair shop for installation of a new hard drive. 
Technicians realized that Fraser had hundreds of graphic images 
depicting minors and contacted police. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor William Weber said Fraser was never authorized to  
collect such materials.

<HEADLINE> Pinter, Silver Have New Plays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A study in contrasts. Harold Pinter, a British  
playwright of few words. Nicky Silver, an American playwright of, 
well, quite a lot. 
</P>
<P>
	Each has a new work off-Broadway, and both of the productions  
are worth seeing, particularly for the way their lead actresses 
tackle very choice roles. 
</P>
<P>
	First, the Pinter. His ``Ashes to Ashes'' is spare, a bit chilly  
and only 45 minutes long, a length that will have audiences out of 
the Roundabout Theater Company's production at the Gramercy Theater 
in time for an unhurried supper. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if they are puzzled by the plot -- and this being Pinter,  
they will be -- you can bet theatergoers will talk about Lindsay 
Duncan's fascinating performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Duncan, a calm, cool blonde in the tradition of Glenn Close,  
plays Rebecca, a woman haunted by the past. The actress radiates a 
security on stage, a confidence that comes from a flawless 
technique and an emotional directness. 
</P>
<P>
	The character talks of a lover, who apparently physically abused  
her. These facts come out slowly, pried from the woman by an 
interrogator named Devlin, played by quietly solicitous David 
Strathairn. 
</P>
<P>
	Gradually, her thoughts turn to memories of babies being pulled  
from the arms of screaming mothers at railway stations. Images of 
the Holocaust, perhaps? Yet the woman is much too young -- the play 
is set in the present -- to have lived through World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Could this be a woman descending into deep psychological torment  
that takes her beyond her own despair? Maybe. Whatever the answers, 
Duncan makes Rebecca's suffering seem very real indeed. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there is ``The Eros Trilogy'' from Nicky Silver, a man  
whose characters often speak in such long monologues that actors 
like to use them as audition pieces. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Vineyard Theater, Silver, author of such quirky comic  
works as ``Pterodactyls'' and ``Raised in Captivity,'' offers two 
such monologues. They constitute the evening's verbose first act. 
The leadoff entry features Betty Buckley, in a rare departure from 
musical theater. 
</P>
<P>
	Buckley can command a stage, something she does here with all  
the intensity of Norma Desmond snaring Joe Gillis in ``Sunset 
Boulevard.'' After all, she is playing one of Silver's favorite 
character types, an all-consuming mother. 
</P>
<P>
	Claire is a wealthy Park Avenue matron, lounging in her boudoir.  
She is bemoaning the lowering of standards all across her fair 
city, particularly the increased frequency with which people spit 
on the sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
	Buckley, coy, coquettish and totally charming, talks directly to  
the audience. Her tale gradually darkens, revealing an unhappy 
childhood and battles with her children. Her only solace: a younger 
lover, who helps her blot out the ugliness of the past. 
</P>
<P>
	The first act's second monologue features Claire's troubled son  
Philip, a quivering, high-strung gay man played by Zak Orth. Philip 
shouts a lot, and Orth displays considerable lung power in bringing 
this unhappy lad to life. It makes for an unpleasant 25 minutes, 
done at high volume. 
</P>
<P>
	Things pick up after intermission with a variation on A.R.  
Gurney's ``Love Letters.'' Here the correspondents are a gay son 
and another domineering mother. Their letter-writing lasts over 
several decades, from summer theater camp -- ``Dear Mother ... I 
have a good part in the show `Follies''' -- to Mom's golden years 
and her son finally settling down in a solid relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	As the son, T. Scott Cunningham holds his own against the  
formidable Buckley. He is sharp and funny, particularly in a 
diatribe against Mom that is Silver at his neurotic best.

<HEADLINE> AMA Says Viagra Paid for Sex Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The American Medical Association admitted  
Wednesday its journal failed to disclose that the authors of a sex 
study had been paid by the maker of the drug Viagra. 
</P>
<P>
	A study in Wednesday's edition of the Journal of the American  
Medical Association reported that a large percentage of American 
men and women experienced sexual dysfunction. 
</P>
<P>
	The journal did not point out that Edward Laumann, a University  
of Chicago sociologist and the lead author of the study, and his 
co-author, Raymond Rosen, had been paid by Pfizer Inc. to review 
clinical trial data on Viagra before the impotency drug was 
submitted for government approval. 
</P>
<P>
	In an Associated Press story, Laumann was quoted as saying the  
study ``gives us a base for explaining why we had this enormous 
response to Viagra.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Phil Fontanarosa, a JAMA editor, said the connection would  
be noted in a subsequent issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an oversight on the part of JAMA,'' AMA spokesman Scot  
Roskelley said. ``The authors did disclose it, the person who was 
looking at it just didn't catch it.''

<HEADLINE> Steelworkers Lobby Against Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Steelworkers from across the country took part  
in a day of organized lobbying Wednesday, urging their members of 
Congress to back quotas on cheap steel imports blamed for numerous 
layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The visits came two days before the Commerce Department was to  
announce whether it found evidence that Russia, Brazil and Japan 
have illegally dumped steel in U.S. markets at prices dramatically 
below production costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that the majority of Congress are interested in what  
constituents have to say,'' said Walt Jones, a 26-year veteran of 
the steel mills from Granite City, Ill. ``We have a group here to 
let them know how our members and our communities feel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, steelworkers spread out on the National Mall sheets of  
steel shaped like ships to symbolize imported goods. The steel 
sheets were signed by individuals from steel-producing communities. 
</P>
<P>
	Steelworkers were joined by rubber tire makers and other crafts  
represented by the United Steelworkers of America. A few hundred 
union activists came by bus, car or airplane to push for quotas. 
</P>
<P>
	The steel imports have pushed down U.S. steel prices and have  
been blamed for 10,000 layoffs and three company bankruptcies. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry had made a comeback after cutting more than 300,000  
jobs and investing more than $50 billion since the 1980s to raise 
their plants to worldwide standards. Company executives and union 
leaders say they cannot continue to compete if foreign producers 
dump their products in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Illegal dumping has not yet been proven, but the government has  
found reason to believe that last year's import surge could 
threaten U.S. steel producers. Friday's preliminary ruling from 
Commerce could be a step toward imposing dumping tariffs on 
imports. 
</P>
<P>
	The steelworkers union wants to go further and has sought  
monthly limitations on imports. Some lawmakers from steel-producing 
states have introduced quota bills and urged steelworkers to be 
relentless in pressing their congressional members to back the 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Be firm, but never let your eye leave the eye of the person  
you are talking to,'' said Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va. ``Some 
people come in and because they have never been in a Senate office 
before are a little shy. Don't be. It's your job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the lobbying, quota legislation is unlikely to pass  
Congress. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has warned that 
quotas and other remedies ``will create retaliation and undercut 
our whole trading system.'' Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin 
expressed similar sentiment last week. 
</P>
<P>
	While some visiting steelworkers were new to the art of  
lobbying, others had lobbied before against ratifying international 
trade agreements that they believe would cost U.S. jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio, led a chant of ``Steel helped to  
build America'' in a House conference room where steelworkers 
congregated before their individual appointments with members and 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
	All visitors were given a lobbying package that included a map,  
phone numbers and office locations -- and for senators the year they 
are up for re-election. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the more attention we can draw to the problem, the  
quicker a solution can come,'' said Chuck Rocha, a local union 
steward at a tire company in Tyler, Texas.

<HEADLINE> Romney May Head Salt Lake Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Olympics organizers scrambled to smooth  
the way for Mitt Romney to be chosen Thursday as the chief of a 
committee badly bruised by scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston venture capitalist, who is the choice of Gov. Mike  
Leavitt and Salt Lake Organizing Committee chairman Robert Garff, 
met with members of a hastily organized search committee Tuesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	That came hours after the committee learned the details of how  
bid committee executives engaged in unethical conduct in spending 
more than $1 million to curry favor with 24 International Olympic 
Committee members. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney met Wednesday with SLOC board members who will be asked  
to hire him as the new chief executive officer of the group staging 
the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the sort of franchise player that can restore the  
integrity to an institution that has gone awry,'' said Bill Hybl, 
president of the U.S. Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's fabulous,'' said board member Henry Marsh. ``As one board  
member said, it's a miracle to get him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Republican who unsuccessfully challenged Ted Kennedy for his  
U.S. Senate seat in 1994, the 51-year-old Romney is the son of the 
late George Romney, governor of Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	Marsh was one of a handful of board trustees asked by Garff on  
Tuesday to peruse applications of those seeking the top SLOC job, 
an effort to show that the board gave attention to candidates other 
than Romney. 
</P>
<P>
	There has been growing pressure on Leavitt and Garff by board  
members and constituents upset there was no exhaustive search as 
promised by Leavitt and Garff last month. 
</P>
<P>
	A week ago, Garff conceded a search could be short-circuited if  
a universally approved candidate were found. Romney already was the 
clear choice by then, but Garff and Leavitt have declined to say 
so. 
</P>
<P>
	``We looked at stacks, dozens of resumes,'' Marsh said.  
</P>
<P>
	But the group also met -- and was wowed by -- Romney, Marsh said.  
</P>
<P>
	``He has the perfect business background. He knows how to take  
major businesses in trouble and turn them around,'' Marsh said. 
``He's tremendously charismatic and he will be a tremendous 
motivating force for the staff and get them going again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Romney's company, Bain Capital Inc., specializes in buying  
companies and turning them around. Domino's was a recent 
acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
	Roger Black, another trustee at the meeting, confirmed the group  
looked at resumes and met with Romney. Neither Marsh nor Black 
would confirm the committee will recommend hiring Romney on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	One businessmen who had been a potential candidate -- Jon  
Huntsman Jr. -- backed out after it became clear there would be no 
real search, he told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Huntsman, a former ambassador to Singapore and vice chairman of  
the $5 billion Huntsman Chemical Corp., said Wednesday he also 
rejected Leavitt's request that he serve on SLOC's new management 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Dave Checketts, chief executive of Madison Square Garden,  
apparently was never interested in the job and merely was chatting 
with an old acquaintance when he met briefly with Leavitt last 
week. That meeting set off speculation that Checketts, a Utah 
native, would be a candidate, but those who know him say he has 
never been interested. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on Thursday, the organizing committee will be asked to  
endorse a restructuring proposed by Leavitt and Garff. It would 
expand the board of trustees from 33 to 50, but it would strip the 
board of its decision-making authority and essentially make it an 
advisory board to a new management committee of 20. 
</P>
<P>
	Leavitt and Mayor Deedee Corradini had not yet released the  
proposed list of candidates for either the board or management 
committee, but one person familiar with the discussion said Frank 
Joklik, who resigned as CEO last month, and board members Spence 
Eccles, John Price, Don Cash and Gerald Sherratt were among those 
being considered for the management committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The new board also is expected to address recommendations from  
the independent ethics panel that investigated Salt Lake's bid. The 
panel said SLOC should have an ombudsman so employees can report 
suspicions about ethical lapses and it should review all 
significant spending twice a year.

<HEADLINE>  Hubble May Have Early Planet Images </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Scientists may be getting a glimpse of the  
infancy of planets in new pictures from the Hubble Space Telescope. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the pictures released by NASA on Tuesday don't actually  
show planets, they give a look at disks of dust that circle young 
stars. Scientists believe that as stars age, this dust condenses to 
form planets. 
</P>
<P>
	Thus, the Hubble images may be offering a glimpse of what our  
solar system looked like 4.5 billion years ago when the Earth and 
other planets began to condense, the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration reported. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA said Hubble was able to photograph the disks edge-on,  
avoiding the glare from the young suns that can overpower the light 
reflected from the dust. 
</P>
<P>
	``While the existence of these disks has been known from prior  
infrared and radio observations, the Hubble images reveal important 
new details such as a disk's size, shape, thickness and 
orientation,'' said Deborah Padgett of the California Institute of 
Technology's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, 
Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Her group used Hubble cameras to look at six young stars 450  
light-years away in the constellation Taurus. Light-years, used for 
measurement in space, represent the distance light travels in a 
year, or nearly 6 trillion miles. 
</P>

	In all six cases, the researchers found evidence of dust bands  
crossing bright areas around the star.

<P>
	The images ``show dark clumps and bright streamers above and

into these disks and driving outflowing jets of gas from the 
forming stars,'' Padgett said in a statement.

<HEADLINE>  Hubble May Have Early Planet Images </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Scientists may be getting a glimpse of the  
infancy of planets in new pictures from the Hubble Space Telescope. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the pictures released by NASA on Tuesday don't actually  
show planets, they give a look at disks of dust that circle young 
stars. Scientists believe that as stars age, this dust condenses to 
form planets. 
</P>
<P>
	Thus, the Hubble images may be offering a glimpse of what our  
solar system looked like 4.5 billion years ago when the Earth and 
other planets began to condense, the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration reported. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA said Hubble was able to photograph the disks edge-on,  
avoiding the glare from the young suns that can overpower the light 
reflected from the dust. 
</P>
<P>
	``While the existence of these disks has been known from prior  
infrared and radio observations, the Hubble images reveal important 
new details such as a disk's size, shape, thickness and 
orientation,'' said Deborah Padgett of the California Institute of 
Technology's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, 
Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Her group used Hubble cameras to look at six young stars 450  
light-years away in the constellation Taurus. Light-years, used for 
measurement in space, represent the distance light travels in a 
year, or nearly 6 trillion miles. 
</P>
<P>
	In all six cases, the researchers found evidence of dust bands  
crossing bright areas around the star. 
</P>
<P>
	The images ``show dark clumps and bright streamers above and  
below the dust lanes, suggesting that raw material is still falling 
into these disks and driving outflowing jets of gas from the 
forming stars,'' Padgett said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> WWI-Era Veteran Decorated by France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- A 105-year-old Army veteran who arrived in  
France a day after World War I ended in November 1918 received one 
of the French government's highest honors. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice, but I don't know if I earned it,'' Peter Gorseth  
said after receiving the Insignia of Chevalier of the Legion of 
Honor and a ceremonial embrace Tuesday from Emmanuel Cohet, deputy 
consul general from the French consulate in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohet begged to disagree.  
</P>
<P>
	``We know -- even among the younger generations -- that the peace  
and the prosperity that we have enjoyed over the past decades were 
built upon the sacrifice of millions of men and women,'' Cohet 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gorseth served in the U.S. Army Veterinarian Corps in 1918 and  
1919 in Bordeaux, France. For seven months, he worked in a 
makeshift clinic where horses and mules mauled by the war were 
brought for help.

<HEADLINE> Study Questions Some Transfusions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Cutting back on blood transfusions for the critically ill can  
actually improve some patients' chances of survival, researchers 
reported today in the New England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	The new study by Canadian researchers questions the common  
practice of giving critically ill patients red blood cells when 
they become mildly anemic. It suggests that waiting until anemia is 
severe can save both money and lives. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was directed by Dr. Paul C. Hebert of the University  
of Ottawa. 
</P>
<P>
	Paradoxically, it found that when it comes to blood  
transfusions, less can be more: Younger and less critically ill 
patients were more likely to die if they got more transfusions. 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody is sure why this was so. However, other studies have  
suggested that red-cell transfusions may suppress the immune system 
and cause circulatory problems in the capillaries. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a landmark study. This is big-time,'' said Dr. Stephen  
Cohn, chief of trauma and surgical critical care at Jackson 
Memorial Hospital-University of Miami School of Medicine. He said 
it will have a far-reaching effect on the treatment of the 
critically ill. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohn and Dr. Robert Taylor, president of the Society for  
Critical Care Medicine, said they plan to use Hebert's guidelines 
in their hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor emphasized the findings don't apply to patients who are  
bleeding or suffering from heart attacks, cardiovascular disease or 
emphysema. 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody knows just how many patients the nation's ICUs treat a  
year, or how many transfusions they get. 
</P>
<P>
	But Cohn said one 20-bed intensive care unit at Jackson Memorial  
gave patients about 125 units of red cells a month in 1997. 
Hebert's findings would let the ICU eliminate at least one-third of 
those, Cohn said. At a conservative $200 per transfusion, that 
could mean $100,000 a year in savings in that ICU alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Red-cell transfusions are routine to fight anemia. However,  
doctors disagree on when they are needed. 
</P>
<P>
	The study involved 838 critically ill and anemic patients at  
hospitals across Canada. One group got transfusions when they were 
slightly anemic, as measured by their hemoglobin levels. The other 
got transfusions only when they were severely anemic. 
</P>
<P>
	The 420 patients in the liberal transfusion group got an average  
of 5.6 units of blood each. The 418 in the restrictive group 
averaged 2.6 units; one-third of them did not get any transfusions 
at all. 
</P>
<P>
	Seventy-eight patients in the restrictive group died within 30  
days, compared with 98 in the group that got more transfusions. 
That difference wasn't considered significant. 
</P>
<P>
	But there was a big difference in the percentage of younger and  
less sick patients who died. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the patients under 55, 5.7 percent of those in the  
restrictive group died within 30 days, compared with 13 percent of 
those in the liberal transfusion group. Among those who were less 
critically ill, the figures were 8.7 percent and 16.1 percent.

<HEADLINE> Chiefs Promote Kurt Schottenheimer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- There'll still be a Schottenheimer  
coaching for the Kansas City Chiefs after all. 
</P>
<P>
	Kurt Schottenheimer was promoted to defensive coordinator  
Wednesday by Gunther Cunningham, who became coach last month after 
Marty Schottenheimer resigned. 
</P>
<P>
	Kurt, 49, broke into the NFL on Marty's staff in Cleveland in  
1987 and then accompanied his older brother to Kansas City in 1989 
when Marty became coach of the Chiefs. He was the Chiefs' special 
teams coach for six years and spent the past four seasons coaching 
the defensive backs. 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham said that when he was hired as defensive coordinator  
four years ago, he and Kurt Schottenheimer became instant friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kurt and I met and Marty said, `My God, you guys get along,'''  
Cunningham said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bang! The relationship developed, and from that time on he  
made all the adjustments for me on the sideline. He is a very 
strong, strong person. It goes back to his special teams 
background. The combination of those things made me see the light. 
I went through 85 different scenarios. This job wasn't promised to 
him. It was my decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new Chiefs' staff will look a lot like the old one. Besides  
promoting Schottenheimer, Cunningham is retaining Mike Solari as 
offensive line coach and Jimmy Raye as offensive coordinator. In 
addition, Bob Karmelowicz and Darvon Wallis have been retained as 
defensive line coach and defensive assistant. 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham, who said he has been working from 4 a.m. to 10 p.m.  
every day putting together his staff, has hired former Chiefs' 
defensive coordinator Dave Adolph as assistant head 
coach/linebackers coach. In addition, Ron Zook was hired off the 
Pittsburgh staff to coach defensive backs. Earlier, the Chiefs said 
they had named Keith Rosen as tight ends coach and Richard Mann to 
replace Al Saunders as wide receivers coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Still to be named is a quarterback coach. Cunningham has been  
talking with Tom Rossley, who was an assistant last year with the 
Chicago Bears.

<HEADLINE> Ditka To Have Further Heart Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- New Orleans Saints coach Mike Ditka plans to  
have further testing done on his heart as a precautionary measure 
after receiving treatments earlier this month to correct an 
irregular heartbeat. 
</P>
<P>
	Ditka, 59, revealed his most recent heart problem Tuesday during  
an interview in Chicago. He gave no indication that his recent 
condition will prevent him from coaching a third season with the 
Saints. 
</P>
<P>
	``(The heart) went out of rhythm, and I had to get it shocked  
back into rhythm,'' said Ditka, who was scheduled to return to New 
Orleans today. ``But I feel pretty good. I've been working out 
every day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ditka said he will have an angiogram performed soon to check for  
possible blockage in his heart and the valves and arteries that 
surround it. The treatment he received Feb. 2 was an electric 
shocking of the heart used to correct irregular beats. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to get an angiogram, and then make sure I don't have  
any blockage,'' Ditka said. ``If I have blockage, then I have to 
get done what has to be done whether they have to bypass it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel good. But I'm not going to assume anything, because Dan  
(Reeves, Atlanta's coach) felt good. Then all of a sudden he didn't 
feel good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves had quadruple heart bypass surgery performed Dec. 14, one  
day after experiencing unusual sensations in his neck and chest 
during a game against Ditka and the Saints in the Superdome. 
</P>
<P>
	Ditka experienced a fluttering sensation in his chest about two  
weeks ago during the week preceding the Super Bowl, Ditka's wife, 
Diana, said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ditka was examined by a cardiologist recommended by Saints team  
physician Dr. Charles Brown, Diana Ditka said, and the irregular 
heartbeat was detected. 
</P>
<P>
	The Saints coach was placed on blood thinners in preparation for  
the Feb. 2 procedure, known as cardioversion. 
</P>
<P>
	``What happens is your heart flutters,'' Mrs. Ditka said. ``So  
it gives you a little bit of a sensation in there. It's like an 
anxiety attack. That's what he was feeling. And that's why he 
decided to get checked. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it was not like heart or chest pains or anything like  
that. It was just a little bit of an anxiety attack. He had an 
irregular heartbeat, and they shocked it to get it back to normal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a common thing when you have a heart disease, which he  
has. It's not major, and it only took a couple of hours to do it. 
He felt fine afterward. This is totally preventative medicine, 
really.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Nov. 2, 1988, Ditka suffered a heart attack while he was head  
coach of the Bears. The attack required an angioplasty procedure to 
clear a small blocked valve located in the rear of his heart. 
</P>
<P>
	Ditka missed just one game before returning to the sidelines and  
then completed a 12-4 season in which he was named NFL Coach of the 
Year. 
</P>
<P>
	Diana Ditka said her husband has been remiss in having regular  
medical checkups since joining the Saints on Jan. 28, 1997. But his 
current situation is nothing that will prevent him from coaching 
this season.

<HEADLINE> Mercedes To Offer Custom Look </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- For the well-heeled Mercedes-Benz driver who  
shudders at the thought of seeing a carbon-copy Mercedes in the 
next lane, the luxury automaker has a preventative fix. 
</P>
<P>
	Mercedes will offer the first of 10 limited-edition models with  
special custom-look paint and top-quality leather trim to its North 
American customers starting next summer on 2000 models. They 
include attention-getting colors outside Mercedes' usual subtle, 
sophisticated palate. 
</P>
<P>
	There's the SLK roadster in ``electric green.'' The E-Class  
sedan in ``espresso.'' And the CLK coupe in ``vari-color slate 
blue.'' The cost: an extra $5,000 to $10,000 on top of cars that 
sell in the $40,000 to $80,000 range in their standard form. 
</P>
<P>
	Mercedes called the customization program ``designo'' and gave  
it a custom pronunciation: dee-zin-yo. Executives announced the 
program Wednesday at the Chicago Auto Show's media preview. 
</P>
<P>
	``Designo buyers not only want added flair, they want to enjoy a  
measure of exclusivity,'' said Joachim Eberhardt, vice president of 
marketing for Mercedes-Benz of North America Inc. ``They don't want 
to see someone wearing the same jacket or dress as theirs at a 
party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Exclusivity has long been part of the Mercedes mystique. But  
last year the German automaker sold 170,245 cars and sport utility 
vehicles in the United States -- up 39 percent from 1997 and triple 
its sales from 1993. In January, it ranked as the top-selling 
luxury brand. 
</P>
<P>
	Eberhardt described the designo models as ``automotive art for  
individualists.'' Only 250 to 500 of each designo car will be sold 
annually. Most will have to be custom-ordered, though Mercedes 
hopes to have one or two on display in each Mercedes showroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Mercedes has had a similar program for its European customers  
for nearly four years, with a much wider range of colors and 
interiors available. The company decided a smaller scale would 
suffice in North America market where the program is expected to 
satisfy the smallest of niche markets, at least for now. 
</P>
<P>
	The program addresses a growing trend of luxury car owners who  
take their new cars to customization shops to make them more 
individual expressions of their personalities, often spending 
thousands of dollars for custom interiors, sporty body cladding, 
chrome wheels and special paint jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We saw there was a need for this in the marketplace and we  
would like to participate in it,'' Eberhardt said. ``And, more 
importantly, provide a better quality product.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While $10,000 sounds like a lot of greenbacks for some green  
cowhide and paint, Eberhardt said the fine craftsmanship is worth 
the extra money for many customers. The work also carries the full 
factory warranty, unlike custom work done by private shops. 
</P>
<P>
	``The leather comes only from southern Germany because they have  
a better grade with no scars,'' he said. ``It's literally 
hand-stitched.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two designo versions of the CLK, E-Class, SLK, S-Class and SL  
models will be available initially in North America. The plant that 
makes the M-Class SUV in Alabama is not yet capable of producing 
the different variations, but it eventually will come under the 
program, too.

<HEADLINE> NYC Protests Police Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Her anguished cry filled the air at the spot in  
the Bronx where her son died in a barrage of 41 police bullets. 
</P>
<P>
	Kadiadou Diallo had just arrived Tuesday from her native Guinea  
when she went to the brick row house where her 22-year-old son, 
Amadou Diallo, was killed Feb. 4. 
</P>
<P>
	``My Amadou! My Amadou! My Amadou!'' Mrs. Diallo cried. Later,  
she said, ``Justice must be done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a separate rally attended by about 1,000 people, more than 20  
speakers talked about mobilizing city residents to pressure local, 
state and federal officials to reform New York City's police 
department. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the last hundred victims of police brutality in this city  
were blond-haired, blue-eyed, corn-fed, apple-cheeked white people, 
you would see some action,'' said attorney Ron Kuby. 
</P>
<P>
	Diallo, who was struck by 19 bullets, was black; the four  
officers who shot at him are white. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Attorney's office is monitoring the case. The officers,  
who did not return telephone calls Tuesday, have not been 
questioned. One has apologized publicly. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers' attorney, Stephen Worth, has said his clients  
believed Diallo was reaching for a gun when they opened fire. Only 
a wallet and a beeper were found near Diallo after he was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Rudolph Giuliani postponed a Thursday trip to Texas,  
during which he planned to spend the night at the home of potential 
presidential contender Gov. George W. Bush. The trip would have 
left Giuliani out of town Friday, when a prayer service is planned 
for Diallo. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Diallo's husband, Saikou Diallo, was to arrive Thursday.  
The couple planned to take their son home for burial on Saturday.

17-year-old Bobby Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones came back to win the U.S. Amateur at Oakmont in 1925.  
Amateur Willie Turnesa won at Oakmont in 1938, followed by Steve 
Melnyk in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
	Oakmont has been host to 12 national championships since the  
1919 U.S. Amateur, including seven U.S. Opens and one U.S. Women's

<HEADLINE> Va. Gov. To Cut Garbage Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Virginia is tired of other folks dumping on  
it. 
</P>
<P>
	Virginia landfills took about 3.2 million tons of out-of-state  
garbage in 1997, second only to Pennsylvania, and the amount is 
growing. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Republican Gov. Jim Gilmore has made cutting garbage imports  
a top priority of the legislative session that ends Feb. 27, and 
has been submitting bills to keep the garbage trucks at bay. 
</P>
<P>
	``My administration is taking decisive action to prevent the  
commonwealth from becoming the nation's dumping grounds,'' Gilmore 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the factors that make Virginia a prime spot for dumping  
are its bountiful supply of open land; extensive network of rail 
lines and roadways; and, most importantly, its cash-strapped 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the nation's biggest trash haulers, Waste Management  
Inc., has been hauling tens of thousands of tons of garbage to the 
state, including hundreds of tons a day in New York City garbage. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the Houston-based company hopes to ship garbage by barge to  
a landfill in Charles City County, a rural county east of Richmond 
with many historic James River plantations. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal has some environmentalists in an uproar, but the  
Rev. Eddie Perry, pastor of St. John's Baptist Church in Charles 
City County, said the community does not mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone wants to say no to trash, but you don't see industry  
breaking down the doors to come to Charles City County,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many counties see the trash as their financial salvation.  
</P>
<P>
	Charles City County officials say they would not have been able  
to build a $22 million school complex in 1994 if not for the trash 
money. The county earned more than $3.7 million -- nearly one-fourth 
of its $16 million budget -- from landfill revenue last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sussex County has reaped $12 million from Atlantic Waste  
Disposal's landfill since it opened in 1994, said Mary Jones, 
county administrator. The revenue allowed the county to float bonds 
for a courthouse, a jail and water system improvements. A new high 
school is under construction thanks to the garbage revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones said if the landfills pose no environmental problems, the  
state should butt out. ``This has always been a local issue,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gilmore is pressing ahead.  
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the General Assembly approved Gilmore's proposal to  
cap the amount of garbage landfills take at 2,000 tons per day, or 
at 1998 levels, whichever is greater. The deal would allow smaller 
landfills, most of them owned by local governments, to grow while 
halting growth at the mega-landfills. 
</P>
<P>
	Also enacted was a bill to ban trash barges from Virginia  
waterways, a move likely to force Waste Management to sue if it 
wants to see its barge plan become reality. 
</P>
<P>
	Company spokeswoman Jewel Sikes said Waste Management trash  
appears to be wanted by some. 
</P>
<P>
	``The communities were very willing to host these sites and get  
the fees associated with them,'' she said. ``Communities have made 
a lot of inroads to solving their problems because of the money 
generated by landfills.''

<HEADLINE> Panel OKs Work Exemptions for Amish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A House panel has approved exemptions for  
Amish teen-agers to work in sawmills and woodworking shops despite 
concerns about flying debris and other dangers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Amish have sought the exemptions since the Labor Department  
began fining Amish businesses thousands of dollars for employing 
youths in those businesses in violation of federal child-labor 
protection laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The Amish believe the existing laws threaten their centuries-old  
religious and work values. Legislation approved on a voice vote 
Wednesday by the House Committee on Education and the Workforce 
would let Amish youths work in limited, supervised settings. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. William Clay of Missouri, the panel's ranking Democrat,  
warned that workers face such dangers as flying saws and falling 
stacks of lumber. He questioned whether youths should be exposed to 
such an environment. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's one of the most dangerous workplaces in the country,''  
he said. ``The occupational fatality rate in the lumber and wood 
industry is five times the national average.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. William Goodling, R-Pa., the committee's chair, said he had  
no reason to believe that Amish youths would be placed at risk 
because the legislation would require supervision and prohibit 
teen-agers from directly operating mechanical equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Amish are known for shunning modern conveniences and taught  
to live apart from the world and abstain from worldly goods. They 
began arriving in the United States about 1720 and settled first in 
Pennsylvania. Some 150,000 Amish live in 22 states and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Their religious traditions forbid formal schooling beyond eighth  
grade, and youngsters are supposed to work after that in 
apprenticeship settings, such as woodworking. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation sent to the full House would let teen-agers work  
in those settings but would also require additional anti-noise and 
safety features, including barriers to protect against wood 
particles or flying debris. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar legislation passed the House last year but died in the  
Senate.

<HEADLINE> Jaguars Name New QB Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Unable to lure his first two  
candidates to Jacksonville, Jaguars coach Tom Coughlin ended up 
installing one of his favorite football minds as offensive 
coordinator: Himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Coughlin left the coordinator's spot open Wednesday, instead  
announcing the hiring of quarterbacks coach Bob Petrino, the former 
offensive coordinator at Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
	It confirmed that he has given up trying to fill the position  
Chris Palmer vacated to become coach of the Cleveland Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now that our coaching staff is once again complete, we'll  
continue moving forward with our plans through free agency and 
personnel evaluations,'' Coughlin said. ``I'm excited to have Bob 
joining the Jaguars coaching staff and having him here as part of 
our program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Petrino will work strictly with quarterbacks and Coughlin will  
expand his responsibilities in an offense that he always played a 
significant role in -- including in the play-calling area. 
</P>
<P>
	Coughlin had interviewed former Bears coordinator Matt Cavanaugh  
and Broncos receiver coach Mike Heimerdinger for the coordinator's 
spot, but Cavanaugh took a position in Baltimore and Heimerdinger 
stayed in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, new defensive coordinator Dom Capers was introduced  
to media for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Carolina coach was hired last month to replace Dick  
Jauron, who became the head coach of the Chicago Bears. 
</P>
<P>
	Capers' hiring fueled speculation that the Jaugars will switch  
to a 3-4 defense next season. That was his specialty with the 
Panthers, and before that, as defensive coordinator with the 
Steelers. 
</P>
<P>
	He said a switch away from the 4-3 was anything but guaranteed.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think sometimes you get the label of being a 3-4 coach  
because of the Pittsburgh years and the first couple of years at 
Carolina,'' Capers said. ``But we always mixed the two, depending 
on what we felt we needed to do to win the game and how your 
personnel matched up against the opponent.''

<HEADLINE> Oregon Police Seek Broadcast Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALEM, Ore. (AP) -- A police organization has asked state  
lawmakers to ban live TV news coverage of how police handle such 
problems as hostage takings and barricaded suspects. 
</P>
<P>
	Live coverage of those events puts officers at risk because a  
suspect, for example, could watch the broadcast and figure out what 
police are doing and where the officers are located, supporters of 
the ban said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the media is broadcasting my position, a wall or a tree or  
a car doesn't do me any good. Bullets go right through them,'' said 
Liz Cruthers, president of the Oregon Council of Police 
Associations. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a proposal by the group, it would be up to the police  
commander at the scene to determine whether a tactical situation 
has developed. In that case, TV stations would be informed that no 
live broadcast is allowed. 
</P>
<P>
	The police officers' proposal also would prohibit news media  
helicopters from flying within 1,000 feet of such operations and 
subject stations that violate the law to a $10,000 civil penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oregon Association of Broadcasters said the proposal  
encroaches on freedom of the press and is unnecessary because 
Portland TV stations already have agreed to restrict the use of 
helicopters in such situations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not out there to hurt anybody. We're there to get the  
story,'' said Bill Johnstone, executive director of the 
broadcasters group.

<HEADLINE> America's Grip on Oscars Slipping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- America's tight grip on the Oscar golden  
statuette is slipping, with voters for the Academy of Motion 
Picture Arts and Sciences looking abroad for many of this year's 
nominees. 
</P>
<P>
	Just three of 10 nominees in the actress categories are  
American: Gwyneth Paltrow of ``Shakespeare in Love,'' Meryl Streep 
of ``One True Thing'' and Kathy Bates from ``Primary Colors.'' 
Paltrow and Streep were nominated for best actress, Bates for best 
supporting actress. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign-born actresses won the lion's share of Tuesday's Oscar  
nominations: Cate Blanchett, ``Elizabeth''; Fernanda Montenegro, 
``Central Station''; Emily Watson and Rachel Griffiths, ``Hilary 
and Jackie''; Brenda Blethyn, ``Little Voice''; Judi Dench, 
``Shakespeare in Love''; and Lynn Redgrave, ``Gods and Monsters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also, all five best picture nominees were set abroad: the  
bittersweet Holocaust tale ``Life Is Beautiful'' from Italy; the 
Renaissance England duo ``Shakespeare in Love'' and ``Elizabeth;'' 
and the World War II battle films ``Saving Private Ryan'' and ``The 
Thin Red Line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the big Hollywood studios' dominance of the awards has  
eroded in recent years, most of them retain bragging rights -- and a 
cut of the box office take -- because their subsidiaries release 
foreign and specialized films that are often in Oscar contention. 
</P>
<P>
	Many films this year were co-productions by big studios --  
``Saving Private Ryan'' was produced by DreamWorks and Paramount, 
while ``Shakespeare in Love'' was financed by Miramax and 
Universal. 
</P>
<P>
	Miramax, which released ``Life Is Beautiful'' and ``Shakespeare  
in Love,'' belongs to Disney. Gramercy, which released 
``Elizabeth,'' is now owned by Universal. 
</P>
<P>
	The best actor nominees were a mix of Americans -- Edward Norton,  
``American History X,'' Nick Nolte, ``Affliction'' and Tom Hanks, 
``Saving Private Ryan'' -- and foreign-born stars, Italy's Roberto 
Benigni, ``Life Is Beautiful,'' and England's Ian McKellen, ``Gods 
and Monsters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The supporting actor nominees were mostly Americans, including  
James Coburn, ``Affliction''; Robert Duvall, ``A Civil Action''; Ed 
Harris, ``The Truman Show''; and Billy Bob Thornton, ``A Simple 
Plan.'' The Australian actor Geoffrey Rush also was nominated in 
this category for ``Shakespeare in Love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two Americans won nominations for direction, including Steven  
Spielberg, ``Saving Private Ryan'' and Terrence Malick, ``The Thin 
Red Line.'' The other three were Benigni, Australian Peter Weir for 
``The Truman Show'' and England's John Madden for ``Shakespeare in 
Love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, ``The Truman Show,'' much praised for its  
originality, was overlooked for best picture and for its American 
leading man, Jim Carrey. This might bear out the old saying that if 
you're looking for an Oscar, don't release your film early in the 
year: ``Truman'' was released in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Other notable omissions include Michael Caine, who won a best  
actor Golden Globe for ``Little Voice;'' Susan Sarandon as best 
actress for ``Stepmom;'' and Joseph Fiennes as best actor for 
``Shakespeare in Love.''

<HEADLINE> Kodak Recalls Some Camera Adapters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Eastman Kodak Co. said today it is  
recalling 120,000 AC adapters for digital cameras due to an 
electrical problem that could cause camera batteries to leak acid 
and explode. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it knows of three incidents when batteries in  
digital cameras have overheated and discharged acid while the 
adapters were in use. In one case, a man reported suffering minor 
burns when battery acid exploded in his face. 
</P>
<P>
	The problems occurred when the connector plug of the AC adapter  
was not fully inserted into the cameras, Kodak said. 
</P>
<P>
	The adapters were manufactured by ELPAC Electronics Inc., of  
Irvine, Calif., and sold separately as authorized accessories for 
Kodak digital cameras. 
</P>
<P>
	They were sold nationwide between March 1996 and August 1998  
under the model numbers 2534, 2457, MI2008 and M42008. They also 
have angled or tapered connector tips. 
</P>
<P>
	Kodak said it would replace the recalled products with  
redesigned ELPAC AC adapters, and offer a discount upgrade for 
consumers who want to trade in their original cameras for new ones.

<HEADLINE> Ford Believes BMW To Be Independent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Ford President Jac Nasser declined Wednesday to  
rule out a possible acquisition of German automaker BMW AG, but 
said he believes BMW and its major shareholders when they say they 
want to remain independent. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasser wouldn't confirm or deny a German news report that Ford  
Motor Co. was about to hire former BMW board member Wolfgang 
Reitzle. He said he didn't want to jeopardize Reitzle's position by 
commenting while Reitzle was still negotiating terms of his 
departure from BMW. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Wolfgang is a tremendous executive and leader,''  
Nasser told reporters during the media preview of the Chicago Auto 
Show. ``I'm sad that he's in the situation that he's in. That's 
something for him and the board of BMW to work out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reitzle, who had once been considered the next in line to head  
BMW, resigned Friday in a management shakeup that also resulted in 
Chairman Bernd Pischetsrieder's ouster. The German news agency VWD 
reported that Ford would hire Reitzle as head of global 
development. 
</P>
<P>
	BMW also declined to comment on the report, attributed to  
unidentified sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Reitzle headed markets and product development for BMW, a maker  
of high-performance sports and luxury cars. His hiring by Ford 
would be a coup for the world's No. 2 automaker as it tries to 
strengthen its market position in Europe and elsewhere in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's shakeup led to widespread industry speculation that the  
company is seeking a change in direction that might include a 
merger or acquisition by a larger automaker like Ford or General 
Motors Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasser dismissed that speculation.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's not the way I read it. I read it as (the board) really  
trying to change what's happened rather than to change what could 
happen. I think it's a reflection of the Rover difficulties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute that led to Pischetsrieder's departure was over  
BMW's strategy for turning around its money-losing Rover unit in 
Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, they're going through a very difficult process,''  
Nasser said. ``The Rover acquisition has been a tremendous 
digestive problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When asked what he would do to correct Rover's problems, Nasser  
was coy. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the reasons we're valued as a great partner is because  
I think we do have the answers to those questions,'' he said. 
``It's a very, very sensitive issue. It's obviously got government 
and union and management and pride associated with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford, flush with $24 billion in cash, recently announced plans  
to buy Sweden's Volvo AB for $6.5 billion. The deal is awaiting 
Volvo shareholder approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasser said he has not talked to BMW or the Quandt family, which  
owns 42 percent of the company and would have to approve any deal 
with another automaker. But he noted that Ford is open to any 
overtures. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't rule out anybody,'' Nasser said. ``But I think when  
a company with the stature of BMW and their board come out and say 
they want to be independent, you have to respect that. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do think that the industry will continue to consolidate and  
we want to be part of the process of consolidation. So I wouldn't 
limit myself to any one particular group at this point.''

<HEADLINE> Holtz Takes Helm at South Carolina </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Lou Holtz now starts the real work of  
turning South Carolina from chickens to champions. 
</P>
<P>
	The coach's winter conditioning program, which some former Notre  
Damers called the ``pukefest,'' begins this week with an eye toward 
increasing the Gamecocks' speed, strength and agility. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goals are very constant from year to year but differ from  
place to place,'' Holtz said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Holtz said through the training sessions, which last until  
spring football practice begins March 20, he will establish work 
ethic, discipline -- ``And I'm talking about if the coach says 
something, it's not just a suggestion,'' Holtz said -- quickness, 
conditioning and related skills. 
</P>
<P>
	Holtz looks like anything but an authoritarian in his sparsely  
decorated office. But his success, popularity and philosophy are 
everywhere, from the three flattering books neatly lined up on the 
coffee table to the bumper sticker on his closet door that sounds 
like a TV ad: ``How to you spell relief? H-O-L-T-Z'' 
</P>
<P>
	He says his Gamecocks won't need relief from crazy, sickening  
workouts. ``But you do have to set some standards,'' Holtz said. 
``It might be a little more intensity than they're used to. But by 
your second year, you can take it to another level. But they think 
it's easier because they've been through it before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holtz remembers his first off-season program at Notre Dame --  
players pouring sweat, large barrels for, ahem, vomiting, ruffled 
faculty. ``They still talk about that. That is legendary,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Holtz and his coaches have shown Gamecock players the agility  
drills they will be expected to perform during the 75-minute 
workouts. By the end -- besides leaner, stronger, quicker players -- 
Holtz hopes to forge a bond with players he and his staff can call 
on in the fourth quarter against Tennessee or Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll get to know them and they'll know us,'' said Holtz.

<HEADLINE> Gifford Reportedly Out at ABC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- First it was Dan Dierdorf. Now it's Frank  
Gifford. 
</P>
<P>
	Gifford is being forced out at ABC after his contract expires in  
June, according to a published report. 
</P>
<P>
	Gifford spent 27 years in the ``Monday Night Football''  
broadcast booth before Boomer Esiason replaced him last season. 
Gifford switched to co-host the pregame show with Chris Berman. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Daily Variety, the network and Gifford are talking  
about other roles within ABC Sports. Network officials are 
considering a major overhaul of the pregame show, including 
bringing in ESPN's Tom Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	Gifford's agent, Ron Konecky, said he has not been informed of a  
change in Gifford's role. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frank's contract is up in June and we are discussing some  
future assignments with him,'' said ABC spokesman Mark Mandel. 
</P>
<P>
	The news came less than a week after Gifford's former partner,  
Dan Dierdorf, left ABC after the network refused to make him a 
substantial contract offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Dierdorf's departure was thought to be a cost-cutting move.  
Reportedly, Gifford's salary is higher than Dierdorf's $1.7 million 
a year deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Gifford is the only person to be in the NFL Hall of Fame as both  
a player and a broadcaster. 
</P>
<P>
	He received an Emmy award for outstanding sports personality in  
1976 and an Emmy for lifetime achievement in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Japan Threatens Y2K Do-Nothings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- A Japanese government watchdog agency is  
threatening to punish financial institutions which fail to prepare 
adequately for the so-called millennium computer bug problem. 
</P>
<P>
	The Financial Supervisory Agency will penalize banks and other  
financial companies that cause problems for their customers due to 
computer trouble stemming from the switch from 1999 to 2000, an 
agency official said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Firms which fail to comply with an agency schedule for preparing  
for the millennium, or Y2K, bug may also face punishment, said the 
official, who declined to be named. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer experts have warned that computers which refer to only  
the last two digits of a year may be unable to distinguish between 
2000 and 1900, something which could trigger system crashes or 
create erroneous data. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoping to spur Japan's financial institutions to speed up  
efforts to deal with the bug, the FSA is threatening to suspend 
operations of industry laggards for an indefinite period of time, 
the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly all Japanese banks and credit unions share the same  
interbank system that handles domestic and corporate fund 
transactions. So financial authorities fear one weak link in the 
chain could lead to disruptions throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, the Federation of Bankers Association of Japan  
said its member banks and experts have begun discussing ways to 
establish a backup system that would prevent individual bank's 
problems with the Y2K bug from affecting the entire system. 
</P>
<P>
	The FSA said that as of December, nearly half of the top 19  
Japanese banks had completed needed updates for just a quarter of 
their main computer systems. Only two banks had updated more than 
75 percent of their systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese financial institutions were recently required to submit  
quarterly reports to the FSA detailing their progress in preparing 
for Jan. 1, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	In September, a special task force set up by Prime Minister  
Keizo Obuchi issued a report urging large companies to test their 
readiness for the potential turn-of-the-century crisis by staging 
mock exercises no later than June 1999.

<HEADLINE> Dolphins Interested in Wheatley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The Miami Dolphins are interested in acquiring  
running back Tyrone Wheatley from the New York Giants, and a deal 
may be completed as early as Friday, when the NFL trading period 
begins. 
</P>
<P>
	The teams reached a verbal agreement on a trade that would send  
a low-round draft pick to the Giants, The Miami Herald quoted 
sources with the Giants and the NFL Players Association as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had conversations,'' Dolphins coach Jimmy Johnson said  
in a statement Wednesday. ``But I'm not going to comment further 
about the nature of those discussions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wheatley's agent, Joel Segal, didn't return phone calls seeking  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot, 235-pound Wheatley carried just 14 times for 52  
yards for the Giants last season. He would give the Dolphins a big 
back in short-yardage situations, a problem for them last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheatley, 27, was a first-round draft pick in 1995. His best  
season was in 1997, when he rushed for 583 yards, averaging 3.8 per 
carry.

<HEADLINE> Hog Farmers Seek $500M More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's pork producers asked Congress  
Wednesday for up to another $500 million federal assistance, saying 
they remain in danger of losing their livelihoods. 
</P>
<P>
	Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman indicated that the Clinton  
administration would not object to additional aid. 
</P>
<P>
	The government last month announced a $50 million aid package  
for pork farmers, who are receiving record low prices. That package 
was aimed at small producers with less than 500 market hogs, paying 
them up to $2,500 each. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeal Wednesday to the House Agriculture Committee was for  
direct payments of up to $50,000 each for farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are thousands of professional, efficient, conscientious  
pork producers who are teetering on the edge of bankruptcy through 
no fault of their own,'' said Craig Jarolimek, vice president of 
the National Pork Producers Council. ``Their lives remain in 
jeopardy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pork producers do not ``make these legislative requests  
lightly,'' Jarolimek said. He and others said larger pork producers 
left out of the earlier assistance deal are in dire need of help. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more hogs you marketed, the more hogs you lost,'' said  
Steven Cohen, an NPPC spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	No exact formula for the payment proposal has been developed,  
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hog prices have dropped to record lows in recent months. Farmers  
got as low as $8-$10 per hundredweight in December compared to 
around $45 a year ago. That means a hog that used to bring in about 
$120 was only worth just over $20. 
</P>
<P>
	Glickman, speaking later before a House appropriations  
subcommittee, said if Congress passed additional assistance for 
pork farmers ``I'm sure we would support that.'' He said that while 
he recognized some farmers were left out of the package, his 
department had limited funds to work with. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, an animal rights group protested giving any aid to pork  
producers. Actor James Cromwell, star of the movie ``Babe,'' said 
Congress not to give money to pork producers. 
</P>
<P>
	``This cruelty is in effect subsidized through government  
support payments and government bailouts,'' Cromwell said.

<HEADLINE> Death Recommended for Fla. Murderer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- A jury recommended the death penalty  
Wednesday for a landscaper who strangled an Orlando mother -- a 
woman whose sister-in-law was murdered by a serial killer seven 
years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	John Huggins, 36, showed no reaction to the jury's  
recommendation that he get the electric chair. 
</P>
<P>
	The slaying of Carla Larson, 30, was the second violent death to  
be inflicted on the Larson family. 
</P>
<P>
	Her husband's sister, Sonja Larson, an 18-year-old college  
student, was stabbed to death by Danny Rolling, who terrorized the 
Gainesville area in 1990. Rolling killed five college students in 
all and is awaiting execution.

<HEADLINE> Presidential Hopefuls Need Big Cash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Before the first votes are cast in next year's  
presidential primaries, some prospective candidates may have to 
withdraw. They won't be able to come up with the $20 million ante. 
</P>
<P>
	That amount -- $2,283 every hour of every day from Jan. 1 to Dec.  
31 -- is how much money political experts say a candidate needs to 
raise by the end of 1999 to fully finance a campaign in 2000. 
Because large states like New York and California are holding their 
primaries in early March, candidates won't have enough time to turn 
an upset in Iowa or New Hampshire into badly needed campaign cash. 
</P>
<P>
	``Money is the first primary. If you can't raise money, you're  
done,'' Democratic fund-raiser Terence McAuliffe said. ``Campaigns 
don't end; they run out of money. At some point, you can't write 
the checks to charter that plane, for the TV studio, to pay the 
staff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least one potential GOP candidate, Elizabeth Dole, is raising  
money before filing with the Federal Election Commission, using a 
provision that allows aspirants to gauge support in advance of a 
full-fledged candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	As he did in 1996, millionaire publisher Steve Forbes can  
finance his presidential campaign by writing checks rather than 
raising money. For the others, raising the $20 million is ``a big 
test,'' former Vice President Dan Quayle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Making the test trickier, federal election laws require that the  
money come in chunks no larger than $1,000 per donor. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could care less about a guy who can give $100,000,'' said  
McAuliffe, who was finance chairman for President Clinton's 
re-election campaign. ``It is the individual who has the ability to 
tap their neighbors, their friends, their relatives. You have got 
to create an army of true believers who are going to spend all day 
calling people on the telephone, asking for money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To assemble that army, a candidate's money people seek out  
veteran fund-raisers, old friends, new friends and friends of 
friends. Many fund-raisers are real estate developers, contractors, 
investors, lawyers or small-business owners -- folks that come with 
long lists of clients, vendors or associates they can ask for 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	The script has the candidate join a small group in a room, or at  
least get on the telephone with potential donors, to seal the deal. 
Some big fund-raisers hope one day to bring their issues directly 
to the next president or one of his top aides. Others want nothing 
more than an autographed picture to hang on the wall. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a lot easier to get the money if they have an opportunity  
to meet the candidate,'' said Ted Welch, a fund-raiser for former 
Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander. ``People just like to be able to 
say two years from now, `I met Lamar Alexander and supported him, 
and he won. Here's a picture of where I was with him in 1999.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The Democrats' 1988 presidential nominee, former Massachusetts  
Gov. Michael Dukakis, said he used to look at the fund-raisers as a 
chance to build grassroots support. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd arrive and the crowd would be there. I'd spend time with  
people chatting and listening and make my speech,'' Dukakis said. 
``Everyone got to shake my hand, ask me questions, develop some 
sense that they knew this guy. This not only raised the money we 
needed but produced fabulous grassroots organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Small contributions, raised through phones and mail, also are  
important. Most candidates agree to limit the amount of money they 
spend in primaries -- $37 million in 1996 -- making them eligible for 
federal matching funds of up to $250 per contributor. While only 
$250 of a $1,000 contribution is matched, small donors' dollars are 
doubled by the government. 
</P>
<P>
	``Direct mail is an emotional medium,'' said Quayle's chief  
fund-raiser, Richard Norman. ``You've got to use some pretty 
emotional language to talk someone into pulling out their checkbook 
when they don't even know you.''

<HEADLINE> `Moses und Aron' Impressive at Met </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Arts and Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Schoenberg's ``Moses und Aron'' has long  
frightened operagoers because of its dissonance and complexity. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the Metropolitan Opera has finally staged this complex  
treatment of the Old Testament story -- and made it musically 
impressive, clear, often delicate, visually striking and an 
inspiring story about faith. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday night's audience responded with enthusiastic applause, as  
conductor James Levine stressed the beauty, lyricism and even 
romanticism that are in the 1932 score, along with jagged 
fragments. 
</P>
<P>
	Bass John Tomlinson, 52, made his Met debut as Moses,  
technically a speaking role that calls for the performer to place 
the words on specific pitches. The audience was almost unaware that 
he wasn't connecting the words, which made the part more musical 
than proclaimed. Tomlinson sings regularly at London's two opera 
companies and sings Wagner in Bayreuth. 
</P>
<P>
	English tenor Philip Langridge sang Aron, as he has done in  
Salzburg, Austria, and Paris. His part is not melodic. Langridge 
sang it expressively, without audible strain. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham Vick's production, with sets and costumes designed by  
Paul Brown, presented the opera in a stylized manner. It began with 
Moses, holding his staff, sitting on what looked like a red sand 
dune that had a small, red-lighted, gold tree on top. Six singers 
sitting in a row of chairs sang angelic music, interrupted by six 
off-stage speakers who delivered God's command that Moses be his 
prophet. 
</P>
<P>
	Moses doesn't want to be God's prophet and pleads his lack of  
eloquence. He is told he'll meet Aron, who will speak for him. In 
the second scene, the dune moves into the wings, followed by 
smaller mounds of red sand where the two men meet. 
</P>
<P>
	A difference in philosophy between Moses and Aron is immediate.  
Moses says God will free the people who are slaves in Egypt. They 
are to believe in the ``unimaginable God'' and make no images of 
him. Aron says they're accustomed to worshiping images of their 
gods and really need it. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, the long ``golden calf'' orgy scene is a series of modern  
dances by various groups of dancers. Unlike the notorious 1990 
production at the New York City Opera, nobody is naked, not even 
the ``four naked virgins.'' They strip to underwear and sacrifice 
themselves by laying their heads across a red rope. 
</P>
<P>
	The orgy dances, by Ron Howell, are sanitized, with much  
flinging around of fur coats, women sitting on men's shoulders and 
being spun around. Only the last minutes simulate an orgy. 
</P>
<P>
	In Act 2, Aron and the elders try, unsuccessfully, to pacify the  
people, who fear Moses has left them forever and want the images of 
their former gods restored. Aron, his life threatened, gives in, 
and a gilded calf on a platform is raised high on a pole, while the 
orgy takes place below it. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end, Moses returns, coming down what looks like a  
gangplank. Fire spurts up from the ground and the people return to 
Moses' God. 
</P>
<P>
	Moses despairs that they have been swayed by an image. But,  
musically, the ending speaks of a triumph of faith.

<HEADLINE> HS Reading Tests Show Improvement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For the first time in almost a decade,  
American students are starting to read better: High school seniors 
show the biggest improvement, but even younger children are 
catching up, the Education Department said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's students had been lagging in reading, even as their  
math and science scores advanced. 
</P>
<P>
	``Reading is the starting point for all learning,'' Vice  
President Al Gore said as he announced reading scores from the 1998 
National Assessment of Educational Progress, a set of federally 
mandated tests. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of the excitement about the information superhighway is  
for naught if the words on the screen are incomprehensible,'' Gore 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the tests, a random group of pupils at three grade levels --  
fourth, eighth and 12th -- had to read and answer questions about 
works ranging from poetry to a 1040EZ income-tax form. 
</P>
<P>
	Many educators point out that, despite improvement, an alarming  
number of U.S. schoolchildren still cannot read at a basic grade 
level. 
</P>
<P>
	``We live in an age drenched in media and information, but many  
of our children can't read,'' said Rep. Bill Goodling, R-Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	Students have gained steadily in NAEP math and science scores  
since about 1980, after declines in the 1970s. The first NAEP 
reading test was given in 1971, but content and scoring were 
changed in 1992. During the 1970s and 80s, reading scores 
fluctuated only slightly, unlike the decreases throughout most of 
the 1990s and this year's increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a rise in their test scores, poor, central-city and  
minority children still scored lower on average than other 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	And children who spent more time reading with their families and  
less time watching television still scored better than other 
students. 
</P>
<P>
	Such quality time with young children is the key to rising  
reading test scores, said Emelie Parker, a first-grade teacher from 
Falls Church, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	``We give our children time to learn how to crawl, to walk, to  
throw a ball,'' said Parker, a 16-year classroom veteran who has 
written articles on teaching reading. ``We need to give them the 
time to learn how to read. 
</P>
<P>
	``So often a child who has never held a crayon or a pencil comes  
to class and sits next to a child who has read for years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the reading test, pupils at fourth-, eighth- and 12th-grade  
levels are tested about every two to four years through a national 
sample of about 31,000 public and private school students. The most 
recent previous reading test was in 1994, before that 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	The reading test includes multiple-choice questions and requires  
pupils to write responses in their own words ranging from a 
sentence or two to more than a paragraph. It measures a student's 
ability to read for literary experience, to gain information and to 
perform a task. 
</P>
<P>
	Pupils are scored on four levels that reflect expert judgment  
about what they should know and be able to do in specific grades. 
The levels are below basic, for the poorest performers; basic, for 
students who meet at least some fundemental skills needed for the 
grade; proficient, for those who show strong work for their grade 
levels; and advanced, for superior performers. 
</P>
<P>
	On the 1998 test:  
</P>
<P>
	--Among 12th-graders, 23 percent scored below basic level, 37  
percent reached basic level, 35 percent were proficient and 6 
percent scored at the advanced level. All levels were improved from 
the 1994 results. 
</P>
<P>
	--Among 8th-graders, 26 percent scored below basic level, 41  
percent reached basic level, 31 percent were proficient and 3 
percent scored at the advanced level. Those reflected improvements 
from 1994 at all levels but advanced. 
</P>
<P>
	--Among 4th-graders, 38 percent scored below basic level, 32  
reached basic level, 24 percent were proficient and 7 percent 
scored at the advanced level. Again, all levels were improved from 
1994 except advanced. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am encouraged by the direction of the reading results and  
perhaps the unprecedented emphasis on reading,'' said Mark D. 
Musick, who chairs the National Assessment Governing Board that 
sets the test standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Education Secretary Richard W. Riley said the scores highlight  
the good done by the Clinton administration's reading initiatives 
begun in the last few years. Goodling, however, said the results 
showed Clinton's education ideas are failing. 
</P>
<P>
	State-by-state results will be released next month. States where  
pupils performed poorly in the 1994 tests already are working on a 
fix. For example, Utah lawmakers are sending money to the 
University of Utah to train reading specialists to go into schools.

<HEADLINE> Wash. Lawmakers Fight Ferry Rage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Suzanne Abbott was waiting for the morning ferry  
across Puget Sound when the car cut in front of her, sparking a 
lecture from the semi-retired finance manager on courtesy. 
</P>
<P>
	The talk nearly caused her to miss the ferry.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's that game called `my job is more important than yours,'''  
said Abbott, 61, who lives on Bainbridge Island, a bedroom 
community separated from downtown Seattle by seven miles of water. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferry rage -- the maritime equivalent of road rage -- is a growing  
phenomenon on the four busiest of 10 ferry routes around Puget 
Sound that make up the nation's largest ferry system, said Susan 
Harris-Huether, a spokeswoman for Washington State Ferries. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers tried to do something about it Wednesday. The state  
Senate voted 46-1 to send the House a measure that would make 
cutting in on a ferry line a $71 traffic infraction. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Jim Hargrove cast the only dissenting vote, sarcastically  
suggesting the measure include penalties for cutting in line at 
theaters and ball games. 
</P>
<P>
	The House has rejected similar measures before, arguing that it  
is impossible to legislate manners. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem stems from a combination of booming growth and  
soaring Seattle real-estate prices that are driving more commuters 
to the west side of the sound, Harris said. The state ferry system 
transports 26 million people and 11 million vehicles a year on 27 
vessels. 
</P>
<P>
	Current law allows authorities to send cheaters to the back of  
the line, but that is not always easy to do, said the bill's 
author, Sen. Mary Margaret Haugen, a Camano Island Democrat whose 
district includes many ferry riders. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is truly a serious problem,'' she said. ``People get  
very, very angry. They often get in fights.''

<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The city of St. Louis has reached an agreement  
to sell the site of the Arena, and the 70-year-old sports landmark 
is expected to be demolished by the end of next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Clarence Harmon announced Wednesday the completion of a  
deal to sell the 26-acre Arena site to Balke Brown Acquisitions 
Corp. The company plans a commercial and mixed-use development. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arena, vacant since 1995, was the longtime home of the St.  
Louis Blues. It also housed college basketball games, rock concerts 
and various other events. The Blues moved to the new Kiel Center in 
1994.

	MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) -- A second fugitive convicted of killing  
a Japanese businessman in Panama has been captured, police said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Horacio Chang Wong was apprehended Tuesday in La Trinidad, about  
95 miles north of Managua, said Police Commissioner Eduardo Cuadra 
Ferrey. His brother, Humberto, was arrested Friday in the southern 
town of Jinotega. 
</P>
<P>
	The two were among four men convicted of the 1992 kidnap-slaying  
of Takashi Ota, an executive of Citizen Latinoamericana Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The four were sentenced to 20 years in prison, though that  
sentence was imposed on the brothers in absentia. 
</P>
<P>
	The two fled Panama apparently with $750,000 in ransom collected  
for Ota before his body was discovered near Panama City. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuadra said he expected Panama to seek their extradition.

leveled the building and killed 29 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Itzhak Aviran said the scheduled guard was absent and his  
replacement didn't come. A passing police control car did not 
report the building was unstaffed, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Aviran met with Supreme Court head Julio Nazareno to inquire  
into the state of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Police detained an Iranian woman in December in connection with  
the embassy attack and the 1994 car bombing of a Jewish community 
center that killed 85 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasrim Mokhtari, who denied any involvement, was released two  
weeks later for lack of evidence.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Federal highway police rescued a 13-year-old  
boy from kidnappers in a pre-dawn raid Wednesday and arrested five 
suspects. 
</P>
<P>
	Jonathan Gonzalez had been held for eight days at a hideout in  
Atizapan, just northwest of Mexico City. His kidnappers demanded a 
ransom of $500,000 but eventually settled for $10,000, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police were contacted by the boy's mother shortly before the  
ransom was to be delivered along a highway east of Mexico City. 
They detained two people who apparently had gone to pick up the 
money, and the two revealed the location of the hideout. 
</P>
<P>
	The rescue operation yielded three more arrests, but police said  
a former soldier suspected of leading the gang escaped.

crisis. Victims range from wealthy businessmen and politicians to 
ordinary citizens.

	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- A leading historian has resigned from  
a panel planning to rewrite Venezuela's constitution, charging that 
President Hugo Chavez monopolized the process. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter published Wednesday in local newspapers, Jorge  
Olavarria said Chavez made an error by issuing a presidential 
decree calling for a national vote on whether Venezuela should form 
a constituent assembly to write a new constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the questions to be voted on would give Chavez the right  
to decide how assembly members are to be chosen. Critics say that 
would concentrate power in his hands. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez, the leader of a failed 1992 coup attempt who took office  
Feb. 2, bypassed the recommendations of the commission and drafted 
the decree himself. 
</P>
<P>
	The former paratrooper says a new constitution is needed to  
clean up corrupt political parties that many blame for squandering 
billions of dollars generated by Venezuela's oil reserves, the 
largest outside the Middle East.

	Shortly after taking power in August, Mahuad announced tough  
economic reforms, saying Ecuador's economy was suffering ``its 
worst crisis in 70 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Battered by El Nino-powered floods and low prices for its main  
export, oil, Ecuador had a huge budget deficit and Latin America's 
highest inflation at 43 percent in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Unions and student groups have staged a series of protests and  
strikes against the measures, which included cutting subsidies on 
electricity, cooking gas and diesel oil. 
</P>
<P>
	Mahuad's approval rating reached 70 percent in late October  
after he signed a peace treaty with Peru ending a border dispute 
that had erupted in three wars. But it has fallen under 50 percent 
recently as his tough economic medicine has caused fuel prices to 
rise up to 400 percent.

<HEADLINE> Gov't Finishes Internee Payments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department closed the books on a  
$1.6 billion reparations program for ethnic Japanese interned in 
American camps during World War II, and will now settle with 181 
ethnic Japanese from Latin America who suffered similar treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	The redress program made $20,000 payments to 82,210 Japanese  
Americans or their heirs, department officials said Wednesday. 
Under a federal court settlement approved last month, the balance 
of the fund was left over to make $5,000 payments to Latin American 
Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
	The department plans to formally release final figures from the  
10-year Japanese reparations program today. 
</P>
<P>
	Roughly 350 additional Latin American Japanese are eligible for  
money, but will not receive it unless Congress approves additional 
reparations funds, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fund is out of money. We are assuming that if more money  
is given, we could reopen these files and make more payments,'' 
said a Justice Department official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The oldest claimants in the group, or their heirs, have first  
dibs on the money. All Latin Americans eligible for reparations 
will get an apology letter from President Clinton, the official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not surprising that there is so little money there, but  
we are not happy with the way it turned out,'' said Julie Small, a 
spokeswoman for Latin American Japanese who sued for reparations in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	When the group agreed to settle the case, leaders thought there  
would be ``at least a little something for everyone,'' Ms. Small 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, a lawyer for the group complained in a court  
filing that the Justice Department has not lived up to terms of the 
settlement approved by a Federal Claims Court judge Jan. 25. 
</P>
<P>
	``The community has really fought long and hard to get a modicum  
of justice,'' lawyer Robin Toma said in an interview. ``We're just 
trying to make sure every single former internee had a fair 
opportunity to get the rather modest benefit that the settlement 
agreement gives them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The reparations fund, set up by Congress in 1988, went first to  
Japanese Americans harmed by the United States after the Japanese 
bombing of Pearl Harbor in 1941. 
</P>
<P>
	President Roosevelt ordered the internments out of fear that  
people of Japanese ancestry could pose a security risk. The vast 
majority of those herded into camps were U.S. citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	The reparations program officially ended last year, after  
handing out payments to an estimated 98 percent of eligible former 
internees or their heirs. The Justice Department office handling 
the claims remained open until last Friday to handle a few 
last-minute claims and to complete paperwork. 
</P>
<P>
	The checks and apology letters will be mailed to the 181 Latin  
American Japanese this week, the Justice Department official said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the letter, Clinton pledged to help win more money for  
settlements if the fund ran dry, but the White House has made no 
formal requests to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 2,200 ethnic Japanese were taken from their homes in  
13 Latin American countries and brought by the American military to 
camps in Louisiana, Texas and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> EU Lawmakers Back Plane Noise Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STRASBOURG, France (AP) -- The European Parliament on Wednesday  
backed a European Union proposal for new standards aimed at 
reducing aircraft noise and pollution caused by fuel emissions. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal has angered the United States, which claims the  
proposed new rules on plane engines would discriminate against U.S. 
companies and ignore existing international rules on aircraft noise 
pollution levels. 
</P>
<P>
	EU Transport Commissioner Neil Kinnock said he expects the  
proposal to be approved by the 15 EU transport ministers when they 
meet next month. 
</P>
<P>
	David Aaron, U.S. undersecretary of commerce for international  
trade, warned in Washington Tuesday that if the EU proceeds with 
the new rules, ``this will not go unanswered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the United States wants more time to discuss the rules,  
without the pressure of an imminent change of rules within the 
15-nation EU. 
</P>
<P>
	Kinnock proposed last March to phase out the use of aircraft  
equipped with so-called hush kits to muffle engine noise in its air 
space by April 1, 1999. The Commission said it is acting out of 
concern for the environment, because the kits quiet aircraft but do 
not diminish pollution. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposal, EU airlines will no longer be able to add  
aircraft with hush kits to their active fleets from April 1, 1999. 
The rule change wouldn't affect aircraft registered prior to April 
1. 
</P>
<P>
	But Washington has trade concerns because all major hush-kit  
manufacturers are non-European and virtually all hush-kit 
installations are for aircraft manufactured outside Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. airlines are buying hundreds of new planes and installing  
hush kits on older models because Washington has required that all 
jets operating in the country meet more stringent noise standards 
as of Jan. 1, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar worldwide requirement goes into effect April 1, 2002.  
That standard was adopted by the International Civil Aviation 
Organization, a United Nations-based group that works to bring 
uniformity to global aviation rules. Both the United States and the 
EU are members of the group. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU and the United States are trading accusations of  
protectionism. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials and airlines claim that the EU is attempting to  
spur sales by Airbus Industries, the European airplane consortium. 
</P>
<P>
	But last December Kinnock's spokeswoman Sarah Lambert called the  
U.S. complaint a ``thinly-veiled form of commercial protectionism 
masquerading as environmental concern.''

<HEADLINE> Helton To Run NASCAR Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- NASCAR president Bill France today  
turned over control of the racing circuit's daily operations to 
Mike Helton. 
</P>
<P>
	The move marks the first time France or his late father, Bill  
France Sr., hasn't been in charge of NASCAR since the circuit was 
formed 51 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	France will remain NASCAR's president, while Helton will be  
senior vice president and chief operating officer. France, 66, said 
he is not departing the NASCAR scene, only taking a diminished 
role. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can read the tea leaves as well as I can,'' he said during  
a news conference. ``That's the best answer I can give you right 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	France said Helton had been moving into the role as NASCAR's  
day-to-day manager the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just making it formal,'' France said.  
</P>
<P>
	Helton said the move should not suggest that major changes will  
follow. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no new agenda that needs to be accomplished, other  
than managing growth of NASCAR the way it is going today,'' Helton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Helton entered racing in 1980 as public relations director at  
Atlanta International Raceway. He came to Daytona and began working 
for the France family in 1986 as director of promotions and market 
development. 
</P>
<P>
	He was hired as vice president of competition for NASCAR in  
1994.

<HEADLINE> House Managers Blame Public Opinion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Resigned to losing their case, the House  
prosecutors say public opinion polls made a stronger impression on 
senators than any evidence that President Clinton committed high 
crimes and misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
	Lead prosecutor Henry Hyde of Illinois said he was ``baffled''  
by polls that showed Americans consistently opposed Clinton's 
removal no matter what evidence the 13 Republican managers on the 
prosecution team presented. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did feel that if we could get the story out in a coherent  
fashion the public might be informed and a change in the public's 
mind would reach the senators,'' Hyde said in an interview 
Wednesday as the Senate moved through its second day of closed 
deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's essential, for impeachment to prevail, to have bipartisan  
support. We never had it,'' the House Judiciary Committee chairman 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. agreed: ``The public opinion polls  
have been the hurdle for us. That is tough, to remove a popular 
president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In more than three weeks of arguments before 100 silent  
senators, the managers insisted that Clinton committed perjury 
before a grand jury and obstructed justice in his efforts to cover 
up his affair with Monica Lewinsky. And they argued strongly that 
the offenses met the constitutional standards for conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	But in poll after poll, constituents of the senator-jurors  
overwhelmingly opposed Clinton's removal. Surveys showed that 
two-thirds of Americans took this stance as the trial wound down. 
</P>
<P>
	As the 67 votes needed for Clinton's removal moved further out  
of reach, the president's approval rating hovered consistently 
above 60 percent. Approval for the Republicans' handling of the 
case never topped 40 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	And though impeachment duty endeared the prosecutors to  
conservatives, evidence began to mount that some of them were 
suffering back home. 
</P>
<P>
	A Chicago Tribune poll showed that three months after Hyde won  
easy re-election to his Illinois House seat, one-third of the 
voters in his conservative district said they had a lower opinion 
of him as a result of impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Jim Rogan, R-Calif., faced a difficult re-election even  
before he was appointed to the impeachment team. Though he outspent 
his Democratic opponent 2-to-1, Rogan was elected to his second 
House term last year with only 50.2 percent of the vote. Clinton 
won Rogan's Pasadena-area district by 49 percent in 1996, compared 
with 41 percent for Republican nominee Bob Dole. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Steve Chabot of Ohio is in a similar situation, embarking  
on the impeachment trial after he overcame a tight race to win 
re-election with 53 percent of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservatives predict voters will consider impeachment old news  
by the time the next Election Day rolls around. The managers point 
out that they only did the job the Constitution required after the 
House approved impeachment articles. And Hyde framed the question 
of political fallout when he told the Senate that ``upholding the 
rule of law'' was worth losing one's congressional seat. 
</P>
<P>
	Several managers lamented the Senate's restrictive trial rules.  
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly the procedures that we adopted in a bipartisan fashion  
were difficult,'' said sophomore Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., whose 
Fayetteville-area district has sent Republicans to Congress in 
every election since 1966. By one percentage point, Clinton 
narrowly won and lost the district in 1992 and 1996, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Charles Canady of Florida no longer worries about  
re-election because he has limited himself to eight years in the 
House, a period that expires next year. 
</P>
<P>
	He said of the trial, ``The basic facts of the case were the  
same'' as they were when Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr 
delivered his report to Congress in September. 
</P>
<P>
	With defeat imminent, the prosecutors returned to the House this  
week visibly relieved to be considering such normal legislative 
matters as federal spending and trade. 
</P>
<P>
	A few, such as Canady, went upstairs to the Rules Committee on  
Wednesday, where Chairman David Drier was holding an ice cream 
social. Even sweeter, said some of the managers, were the hearty 
back-slaps and words of support they got from Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone understands that this was a tough job,'' Rogan aid.

<HEADLINE> Diet Industry Given New Guidelines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some of the biggest names in the weight loss  
business have pledged to give consumers looking to shed excess 
pounds better information about how much diet products and programs 
will cost, the risks involved and the benefits of even moderate 
weight loss. 
</P>
<P>
	A set of voluntary guidelines, released today a group of  
government, industry and health representatives, don't reach a 
consensus on one of the most pressing questions -- how many pounds 
consumers can expect to lose -- but they do urge the diet industry 
to disclose more information to clients. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very happy that we have gotten this far,'' said Lynn  
McAfee of the Philadelphia-based Council on Size &AMP; Weight 
Discrimination, one member of the coalition called the Partnership 
for Healthy Weight Management. But ``this is clearly a work in 
progress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Trade Commission and other members of the group --  
including consumer and health advocates as well as industry 
representatives -- worked on the guidelines for a year and said they 
hoped consumers would use the guidelines when choosing weight-loss 
programs. Americans spend about $33 billion a year in their efforts 
to shed pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The guidelines suggest that companies alert consumers that  
``most people who lose weight are likely to find it difficult to 
keep the weight off.'' But the coalition has not reached agreement 
on how businesses can provide clients with an accurate measure of 
typical weight loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been struggling with these issues, but we realize  
there's not a one-size-fits-all disclosure,'' said Warren Dennis, 
outside general counsel for the Jenny Craig program. 
</P>
<P>
	Slim Fast, Jenny Craig, Weight Watchers and Novartis Nutrition  
Corp., which runs the Optifast plan, were among the coalition's 
industry participants. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis said the results of weight-loss programs vary so much  
from individual to individual and are dependent on so many factors 
that determining their effectiveness is very difficult. It's even 
tougher to figure out how many people successfully maintain their 
weight loss after a few years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer advocates disagree.  
</P>
<P>
	``We feel the companies have a good idea about how much their  
clients lose on average,'' said Bruce Silverglade, director of 
legal affairs at the Center for Science in the Public Interest. 
``This is not rocket science.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. George Blackburn of the Center for the Study of Nutrition  
and Medicine at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston said 
many larger companies already conduct long-term studies -- two to 
five years -- on outcomes. But clients may not hear the big numbers 
they are hoping for, he warns. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, they want magic outcomes,'' Blackburn said.  
``We can only give them ... reasonable, healthy, long-term weight 
loss.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The guidelines urge providers of weight-loss services or  
products, including physicians, nutritionists and commercial 
centers, to give clients a detailed description of program 
contents, goals and staff qualifications. They should provide an 
estimate of total costs, including mandatory food purchases or 
medical tests required by the program. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry leaders believe that following the guidelines will not  
amount to a significant change of practice for weight-loss 
companies, particularly since many of them already are under 
consent orders with the government that prevent them from making 
false claims about their products. By setting the standard, the 
coalition hopes smaller operations will follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
	The guidelines place heavy emphasis on giving consumers  
information about the health risks of obesity, trying to shift the 
focus away from dropping pounds solely for cosmetic reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``People enter weight-loss programs because they want to lose a  
whole lot of weight to be a size 6 or 8. They don't want to hear 
that just losing 20 pounds has health benefits,'' said Tracy Fox, a 
registered dietitian with the American Dietetic Association's 
government affairs office. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Institutes of Health says about 55 percent of  
American adults are overweight or obese -- up from 43 percent in 
1960. The extra weight can mean increased risk of heart disease, 
high blood pressure, diabetes, stroke, gallbladder disease, 
arthritis, sleep and breathing problems and some types of cancer.

<HEADLINE> Spielberg Offers Holocaust Archive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- While steering clear of Germany's debate over its  
national Holocaust memorial, director Steven Spielberg suggested 
Wednesday that his archive of interviews with survivors was still 
available if Germany wants to include it. 
</P>
<P>
	Spielberg, in town for the screening of his Holocaust  
documentary ``The Last Days'' at the Berlin International Film 
Festival, declined to comment on competing concepts for the 
memorial, to be built in Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is a decision that the German people have to make,'' he  
said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	But he indicated that he was still interested in having the  
archives collected by his Shoah Visual History Foundation as part 
of the project. 
</P>
<P>
	Spielberg first made the suggestion in a German magazine  
interview last November, and it reportedly was backed by Chancellor 
Gerhard Schroeder's culture adviser, Michael Naumann. 
</P>
<P>
	But there was no mention of Spielberg's archive in a new concept  
Naumann unveiled in December, which combines a research center, 
exhibition space and a memorial park. 
</P>
<P>
	After more than a decade of public debate, parliament is to vote  
on the project this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Spielberg said he has met with government officials, and had a  
chat with Schroeder scheduled for Wednesday. But he denied he was 
lobbying for his archive to be included. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're sitting in the wings, waiting to see what you decide,  
before we then come here with our repository and make a home for 
it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Spielberg also accepted a $1.5 million donation to his  
foundation from a Partners for Tolerance initiative backed by three 
of Germany's biggest publishing houses, Bertelsmann, Burda and 
Springer. 
</P>
<P>
	The publishers plan to help translate educational materials  
produced by the Shoah Foundation, like an interactive CD-ROM 
unveiled last year, and distribute them to German schools. The 
foundation also has ideas about making survivor interviews 
available via Internet directly at former concentration camps. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Last Days,'' a documentary feature nominated for an  
Academy Award on Tuesday, was to be screened out of competition 
Thursday at the Berlin festival. The film, which traces the 
experiences of five Hungarian Holocaust survivors, is slated to 
open this month in theaters in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Spielberg said he was ``very happy'' about the Oscar  
nominations, which included 11 for another of his movies, ``Saving 
Private Ryan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Breaking into a big grin, he said: ``How do I feel? How do you  
think I feel?''

<HEADLINE> Real `English Patient' Was No Count </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ERD, Hungary (AP) -- The Hungarian count known to the world as  
the hero of ``The English Patient'' was a haunted desert explorer 
who collaborated with the Nazis to try to save his lover's life. 
</P>
<P>
	But the real-life story of Laszlo de Almasy is even better, the  
author of a new biography claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Janos Kubassek, a Hungarian with a lifelong fascination with  
Almasy, says he discovered documents from the war crimes tribunal 
showing that Almasy saved several Jews during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	He also debunks a couple of misconceptions about Almasy in ``The  
True Story of the English Patient,'' published in Hungarian this 
month: Almasy wasn't a devoted Nazi and he wasn't a count. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that Kubassek has anything but praise for Anthony  
Minghella's breathtaking film, winner of the 1997 Academy Award for 
best picture, or the prize-winning Michael Ondaatje novel on which 
it was based. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are wonderful works -- of fiction,'' he says.  
</P>
<P>
	Kubassek, 41, is a geographer, historian and director of the  
Hungarian Geographical Museum in this small town 12 miles west of 
Budapest. He relates his obsession with Almasy sitting in a tiny 
office filled with books, maps and mementos of his trips tracing 
Almasy's life and travels. 
</P>
<P>
	As a boy of 15, he acquired one of Almasy's books from a  
secondhand bookseller, and it determined his career. He joined the 
Hungarian Geographical Society a year later and went to the 
University of Debrecen to study geography. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to know everything there was to know about Almasy,''  
he says, still visibly gripped by that youthful passion. 
</P>
<P>
	Born Aug. 22, 1895, in Borostyankoe, Hungary -- now Bernstein,  
Austria -- Almasy was no count, his biographer learned. When he 
served as an adjutant to Austrian ruler Karl IV, the emperor once 
referred to him that way, and it stuck. 
</P>
<P>
	Almasy went on his first of many expeditions to the Sahara in  
1926, journeys he described in a series of books. He became known 
for discovering Stone Age paintings in caves in Libya. 
</P>
<P>
	His reputation as a Sahara expert led to his widely questioned  
association with the Nazis when the German Luftwaffe requested his 
services in 1941 from the Hungarian military, where he was an air 
force reservist. He joined Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps, and was 
assigned to aerial reconnaissance tasks. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1942, he personally guided two German spies across the  
Sahara, taking them behind British lines, and was awarded two 
German Iron Crosses for his services. 
</P>
<P>
	He returned to Budapest in 1943 and, at the Defense Ministry's  
request, wrote up his diary account of serving under Rommel, which 
was published as a book. 
</P>
<P>
	He was arrested and held briefly by Soviet authorities in  
Hungary in 1945, then arrested again by Hungarian authorities after 
a neighbor accused him of Nazi sympathies. 
</P>
<P>
	But as court records studied by Kubassek showed, the Hungarian  
war crimes tribunal found no such evidence and he was released in 
1946. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only was Almasy no Nazi, the biographer says, archives tell  
how he saved the lives of several Jews in 1944, when Adolf Eichmann 
was rounding up the Jews of Hungary for extermination. 
</P>
<P>
	During the darkest hours of Nazi terror in Hungary, Almasy often  
donned his Luftwaffe uniform with Iron Cross decorations and 
successfully prevented Hungarian fascists from searching his 
apartment where he was sheltering the family of Lajos Weisz, his 
Jewish neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
	Kubassek also found court evidence that Almasy saved Gyoergy  
Fuksz, the son of Olympic fencing champion Jenoe Fuksz, a Jew. And 
that he rescued a Jewish Polish refugee boy from certain discovery, 
obtained false papers for him, and put him into a Catholic 
orphanage where he survived the war. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was pro-monarchy and that was about his only politics,''  
Kubassek says. ``Almasy welcomed the transfer to Rommel's army 
because it meant a chance to return to his beloved Sahara, but 
there is nothing in any of his writings or private letters 
indicating Nazi sympathies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Almasy left Hungary for good in the middle of 1947, returning to  
Africa where he organized safaris. After coming down with dysentery 
in Egypt, he died March 22, 1951, at the age of 55 in a clinic in 
Salzburg, Austria. 
</P>
<P>
	One mystery that remains even after all of Kubassek's research  
concerns Almasy's love life. There were romantic interests, but no 
evidence indicates a great romance as in Minghella's movie. 
</P>
<P>
	``No woman could tolerate for long playing second fiddle to the  
Sahara,'' Almasy's cousin Antal told Kubassek.

<HEADLINE> Star Watch: A Clued-In Alicia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The life of a twentysomething movie mogul can be  
rough. Bad scripts are piling up, your faxes get ignored and the 
tabloids always smell blood. 
</P>
<P>
	Plus, you have to deal with toilet seats that warm  
automatically. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eewwww,'' says Alicia Silverstone, emerging from a swanky  
Manhattan hotel bathroom. ``That is the absolutely grossest thing 
ever! Why on Earth does someone think we need that? ... It's sick. 
Ick!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Excess and wastefulness -- these are the targets that currently  
draw the ire of this 22-year-old former video vixen, whether they 
come in the form of high-tech bun-warmers or the latest offering 
from Tinseltown. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hollywood has gotten pretty bad,'' Silverstone says, curling  
up behind a coffee table laden with very cold take-out: congealing 
bok choy, rice, tofu, asparagus and sushi. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the most popular movies of this year insult my  
intelligence. Tell me, why is THAT the No. 1 movie of the year? You 
must be joking me,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just don't understand as human beings how we can want to be  
rich before wanting to educate. Why do we teach people to be as 
nasty and disgusting as we can just to make money? It's sick and I 
would never want to be a part of it,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	But, of course, Silverstone has been a part of it -- pretty much  
since her 1993 debut in ``The Crush'' as a low-rent, predatory 
Lolita who fakes her own rape and delivers such offhand gems as, 
``Nick, ever do a virgin?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I never thought of it as a sexual role. I was 15! But when I  
went back to my notes, I wrote really sexual things in there for my 
character. I wrote really crazy things,'' Silverstone says. ``I was 
15 years old! I didn't even know what I was writing. I don't even 
know what that stuff means now! How did I know what it meant 
then?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet with her wide eyes, blond hair and Valley Girl allure,  
Alicia (pronounced A-lee-see-ah) continued being cast as the 
come-hither Dream Date to an audience of adolescent boys. 
</P>
<P>
	There was the sexpot lead in ``The Babysitter,'' the goofy  
wannabe detective in ``True Crime,'' the flirtatious daughter in 
``Hideaway'' and her wild-girl roles in three, one-word-titled 
Aerosmith music videos -- ``Cryin','' ``Amazing'' and ``Crazy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no regrets,'' Silverstone says. ``I don't want to do  
movies that don't challenge me, that don't move me. So I would not 
choose to do something that involved, like, screaming for two 
hours. That would be boring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Was that, perhaps, a not-so-subtle dig at some of her peers?  
After all, haven't a whole herd of twentysomething actors made 
their mark by yelling their heads off in such teen slasher movies 
as ``Scream,'' and ``I Know What You Did Last Summer''? 
</P>
<P>
	Silverstone, dressed in slim pants and a dark cashmere cardigan  
that plunges at the neck, won't elaborate, only offering her 
strange, downward-sloping grin. 
</P>
<P>
	But if she has no regrets, she also has little patience for the  
exploitative, brain-dead fare that young actors so often take on as 
they move up the Hollywood food chain. ``There's no such thing as 
being forced. They feel like there's no alternative, but I think 
it's because of what they're after,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem with young people and the reason they make their  
choices is probably because they think they want to make it while 
they can,'' she says. ``Now! Make a lot! Quantity, not quality -- 
it's all about how fast I can do it and what's going to make me 
more famous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Everything changed for Silverstone after ``Clueless'' in 1995.  
Critics and audiences alike were delighted by her Cher, a 
fast-talking Beverly Hills Betty who struggles with her own shallow 
materialism. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're going to play someone flighty, you have to be really  
smart,'' says Silverstone. ``It wouldn't work if you don't have the 
depth. The idea is that it comes off as easy and painless, but you 
have to have a lot going on. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's why I don't like a lot of actors today and the movies  
they do because I don't believe they're feeling or thinking a 
thing. They're just saying the words as interestingly as possible 
and they look good. That, to me, is nothing. There's nothing 
interesting about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Renny Harlin, who co-produced Silverstone's latest romantic  
comedy, ``Blast From the Past,'' was impressed to find that the 
actress' bubbly on-screen image was a far cry from the intense 
young woman he met on the set. 
</P>
<P>
	``Alicia is very intelligent, very mature, more like an artsy  
thinker than your usually Hollywood starlet who likes to go to 
parties and hang out with the cool people and get her picture 
taken,'' Harlin says. 
</P>
<P>
	After the huge success of ``Clueless,'' Silverstone's previous  
works, slated for the straight-to-video bin, were quickly dusted 
off for theatrical release. A two-picture, $10 million producing 
deal with Columbia Pictures made her Hollywood's youngest 
actress-cum-producer. She was 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Inevitably, the other stiletto dropped: Her follow-up films,  
``Excess Baggage'' and ``Batman &AMP; Robin'' were poorly received, and 
she had the temerity to actually walk around in public after 
gaining a few pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Her huskier appearance at the 1996 Academy Awards prompted jokes  
about Fatgirl and excess baggage. Scripts arrived which she says 
offended her. Two years after having climbed to the pinnacle of the 
industry, she was now dubbed a fading It girl. 
</P>
<P>
	``My experience with studios typically is that they have this  
formula, right? And they use this formula so that you may as well 
be writing it for animals,'' she says. ``No, I don't even want to 
degrade animals by saying they understand it. It's like some kind 
of machinery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Having been through the industry wringer, Silverstone returns  
after a two-year lull with her new fish-out-of-water comedy and has 
begun shooting ``Love's Labour's Lost,'' a Shakespeare comedy 
adapted into a musical by Kenneth Branagh. 
</P>
<P>
	There is still bitterness, however. Not to the public, which  
hasn't given up on her. Not for her critics, who like to trash her 
four-person First Kiss production team. No, her ire is for those 
Hollywood types who waste precious celluloid. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's so sad that we don't educate. ... Of course, it's a  
business but we can educate so powerfully through movies,'' she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	``So why are we choosing to put trash down their mouths?''

<HEADLINE> Smoker Awarded $51.5M in Damages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- When Patricia Henley was 15, she watched  
sultry star Susan Hayward smoke on the big screen. It was cool. It 
was glamorous. She said no one told her it might be deadly. 
</P>
<P>
	Three decades later, the former three-pack-a-day smoker with  
inoperable lung cancer convinced a jury that Philip Morris Cos. 
concealed the risks and addictiveness of smoking, and the panel 
rewarded her by returning the largest verdict ever in a tobacco 
lawsuit filed by an individual -- $51.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel wonderful,'' said Ms. Henley, who pledged to donate any  
money she receives to educate youngsters about the dangers of 
smoking. ``This is a great day for the children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Henley, 52, won $50 million in punitive damages Wednesday on  
top of $1.5 million in compensation awarded by the Superior Court 
jury a day earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Although no similar verdict against the tobacco industry has  
survived on appeal, some say Ms. Henley's case marks a change in 
fortune for cigarette makers. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Stanton Glantz, a University of California, San Francisco  
professor of medicine who published a book in 1996 that exposed 
tobacco industry documents, said he believes plaintiffs' lawyers 
have learned from mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you're just beginning to see the beginning of the dam  
burst,'' he said. ``The evidence of wrongdoing by the industry is 
getting overwhelming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Henley thought she had pneumonia when she started coughing  
and having trouble singing. She was about to record a country and 
western music compact disc when she finally sought help. 
</P>
<P>
	She was diagnosed a year ago with inoperable cancer. Ms. Henley  
was forced to quit smoking and educate herself about what was in 
all those Marlboros. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went from knowing nothing to knowing too much,'' she said.  
``We went into this case figuring we'd never beat big business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She sued Philip Morris in May.  
</P>
<P>
	Her lawyer, Madelyn Chaber, asked a jury of five men and seven  
women to ``send a message back to this company that the price of 
human life cannot be calculated into the cost of doing business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Punitive damages were the only way to get the attention of a  
company worth $3.5 billion, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the 12 jurors, including jury foreman George Loudis,  
voted against awarding the $50 million in punitive damages. He 
supported punitive damages of $15 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our decision was based on a lot of evidence, the suppression  
of known facts by Philip Morris,'' Loudis said. ``They had a lot of 
information they just didn't give out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	William Ohlemeyer, who represents Philip Morris, said Wednesday  
that the company would appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The jurors unfortunately let their feelings of sympathy get in  
the way,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is California's first since the repeal of a 1987 state  
law that banned lawsuits by cigarette smokers on the basis that the 
risks of smoking were well known. Dozens of cases pending at the 
time were dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, then-state Attorney General Dan Lungren joined justice  
officials in other states in suing the tobacco industry, and the 
state Legislature repealed the ban on individual lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	The tobacco industry reached a $206 billion legal settlement  
with states in November, but cigarette makers still face individual 
and class-action claims. 
</P>
<P>
	However, jury awards in such cases are rare. Two verdicts in  
Florida and one in New Jersey against cigarette makers were all 
overturned by appeals courts. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Ms. Henley's lung cancer is in remission, she said it's  
not likely she'll live to see her granddaughters, ages 2 and 10, 
grow up. 
</P>
<P>
	``My battle's over. It's just a matter of time,'' she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A jury awarded a former three-pack-a-day  
smoker $50 million in punitive damages Wednesday in her lawsuit 
against a tobacco company, bringing the total award to $51.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	A day earlier, the jury ordered Philip Morris Cos. to pay $1.5  
million in compensatory damages to Patricia Henley to cover medical 
expenses, pain and suffering. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel wonderful,'' said Henley, who pledged to donate any  
money she receives to educate youngsters about the dangers of 
smoking. ``This is a great day for the children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Henley, 53, of Los Angeles, was diagnosed last year with  
inoperable lung cancer. She alleged the tobacco company hooked her 
on cigarettes when she was 15 and misled her about the dangers. Her 
cancer is in remission after chemotherapy and radiation treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Before jurors deliberated for four hours Wednesday, Henley's  
attorney told them that punitive damages were the only way to get 
the attention of a $3.5 billion company. Madelyn Chaber asked the 
jury to award her client $15 million in punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
	William Ohlemeyer, who represents the tobacco company, told the  
jury that the tobacco company has been punished enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is nothing you can do now in this lawsuit that sends a  
clearer message,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the 12 jurors, including jury foreman George Loudis,  
voted against awarding the $50 million in punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our decision was based on a lot of evidence, the suppression  
of known facts by Philip Morris,'' Loudis said. ``They had a lot of

Legislature responded to criticism of the ban by repealing it. 
</P>
<P>
	The tobacco industry came to a $206 billion legal settlement  
with states in November, but cigarette makers still face class 
action suits and individual suits by smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	However, jury awards in such cases are rare.  
</P>
<P>
	A Florida appeals court earlier this year overturned a  
Jacksonville jury's $1 million judgment for the family of a dead 
smoker against Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, another Jacksonville jury awarded $750,000 to a man who  
blamed his lung cancer on smoking. Last June, an appeals court 
threw out the verdict, saying the plaintiff waited too long after 
he fell ill to sue and that a 1969 federal law bars lawsuits from 
claiming the wording of cigarette warning labels is inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
	The first award against a tobacco company in a liability case  
was won in 1988 by the family of Rose Cipollone of New Jersey. But 
that $400,000 verdict was overturned on appeal, and the nine-year 
lawsuit was dropped when the family could no longer afford to 
continue.

<HEADLINE>  Judge Orders Pilots To Halt Sickout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- A federal judge ordered pilots at American  
Airlines Wednesday to end a sickout that has grounded 2,500 
flights, stranded an estimated 200,000 travelers and left 
businesses scrambling to find new ways to ship cargo. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Joe Kendall chided the pilots union and the  
airline in issuing a temporary restraining order and told them to 
resume negotiating. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's silly for us to even be here,'' he said. ``It's like  
killing a gnat with a sledge hammer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall told the pilots to return to work Thursday and warned  
they could be held in contempt of court if they don't. He also 
placed some blame for the dispute on the airline. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you would look up bad labor relations in the dictionary,  
you would have an American Airlines logo beside it,'' Kendall said. 
</P>
<P>
	AMR Corp., the airline's parent company, had asked for the  
judge's order. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're threatening to bring the airline to a complete halt,''  
AMR attorney Dee Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilots began calling in sick and refusing overtime Saturday  
after talks broke down with the company about the salaries paid 
pilots of Reno Air, which AMR recently acquired. American pilots 
are barred by federal law from striking over the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Reno pilots make half the $164,000 a year that an  
experienced American pilot makes and the American pilots want AMR 
to add Reno pilots to the higher pay scale quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	AMR said that it will take about 12 to 18 months do that and the  
pilot union's demands would cost as much as $50 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline estimated that 2,077 of the 9,400 American pilots  
called in sick Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	AMR spokesman Chris Chiames said the company believed the pilots  
would abide by the judge's order. ``We have never questioned a 
pilot that has called in sick. We just hope they will all get 
better soon,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the pilots' union was not immediately available  
to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, passengers struggled through another day of  
delays. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicole Travis, 15, of Long Island, N.Y. found herself stuck in  
Chicago, a city she had no intention of visiting. Travis said she 
stood in line for four hours at LaGuardia Airport in New York, then 
got booked on a United Airlines flight to Chicago's O'Hare 
International Airport, hoping eventually to get to a planned 
vacation with relatives in Tampa, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was supposed to be an eight-day vacation but now it's only  
seven days. This day was wasted,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Erin McGrath was angry at the pilots because she got stuck after  
a business trip to West Palm Beach, Fla. She waited in line at the 
Ft. Lauderdale airport Wednesday for a rental car so she could 
drive to Miami for a flight to San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm waiting for the time when unions and employees realize  
that they don't have to share in every penny of their company's 
profits. It seems like the only people they are hurting are the 
ones that pay their bills.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, some praised American employees for being friendly and  
helpful in getting them booked on other flights. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlie Hall of Dallas arrived in Chicago on a United flight  
that American helped him book. ``I can't complain except that I 
lost frequent flier miles,'' said Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss of American's cargo services was causing heartburn at  
Gladstone's 4 Fish restaurant in Malibu, Calif., where supplies of 
succulent dungeness crab from Alaska were dwindling. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gladstones has no freezers or microwaves. All of our food is  
fresh,'' said spokeswoman Christine Lloyd. ``Our produce and fish 
is delivered daily, including Sunday. We rely heavily on things 
coming in every day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Miami, F C Forwarding, a small freight company that ships  
live animals, computers, and electronics -- mostly to Latin America 
-- decided earlier this week to find other shippers. 
</P>
<P>
	Adriana Rehm, a vice president, said does about 20 shipments a  
day, almost all with American. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't tell you we've lost money because there are other  
alternatives to American, but it has been a major inconvenience,'' 
Ms. Rehm said. ``We've had to scramble to get our stuff out on time 
and avoid customer dissatisfaction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	TWA, Delta and other airlines accepted American tickets in the  
same price class and waived the customary change of flight fee, as 
part of a common pact made between airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're picking them up wherever we fly if American operates  
there, too,'' said Delta spokesman Bill Berry. 
</P>
<P>
	Airline analyst Raymond Neidl with Furman Selz Inc., estimated  
American is losing about $19 million a day in revenue -- or $1.5 
million a day in profits. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he doubted the airline has alienated customers for the  
long term. 
</P>
<P>
	``The key question is how quickly will this business come back  
to American, and my guess is pretty quickly,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Japan Threatens Y2K Do-Nothings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- A Japanese government watchdog agency is  
threatening to punish financial institutions which fail to prepare 
adequately for the so-called millennium computer bug problem. 
</P>
<P>
	The Financial Supervisory Agency will penalize banks and other  
financial companies that cause problems for their customers due to 
computer trouble stemming from the switch from 1999 to 2000, an 
agency official said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Firms which fail to comply with an agency schedule for preparing  
for the millennium, or Y2K, bug may also face punishment, said the 
official, who declined to be named. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer experts have warned that computers which refer to only  
the last two digits of a year may be unable to distinguish between 
2000 and 1900, something which could trigger system crashes or 
create erroneous data. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoping to spur Japan's financial institutions to speed up  
efforts to deal with the bug, the FSA is threatening to suspend 
operations of industry laggards for an indefinite period of time, 
the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly all Japanese banks and credit unions share the same  
interbank system that handles domestic and corporate fund 
transactions. So financial authorities fear one weak link in the 
chain could lead to disruptions throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, the Federation of Bankers Association of Japan  
said its member banks and experts have begun discussing ways to 
establish a backup system that would prevent individual bank's 
problems with the Y2K bug from affecting the entire system. 
</P>
<P>
	The FSA said that as of December, nearly half of the top 19  
Japanese banks had completed needed updates for just a quarter of 
their main computer systems. Only two banks had updated more than 
75 percent of their systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese financial institutions were recently required to submit  
quarterly reports to the FSA detailing their progress in preparing 
for Jan. 1, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	In September, a special task force set up by Prime Minister  
Keizo Obuchi issued a report urging large companies to test their 
readiness for the potential turn-of-the-century crisis by staging 
mock exercises no later than June 1999.

<HEADLINE> American Dispute Hurting Shippers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Cargo companies that rely on American Airlines were  
making other, often more costly, arrangements Wednesday to ship 
everything from fresh fish to forklifts to their customers. 
</P>
<P>
	American even wound up looking to a rival to lease space to  
store goods it could not carry. 
</P>
<P>
	Shippers had to scramble as a result of a pay dispute with  
pilots that forced the cancellation of 2,500 American flights since 
Saturday. On Wednesday, a federal judge in Texas ordered the pilots 
to stop calling in sick and directed them to return to work 
Thursday or face contempt charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami, a gateway to Latin America, is one of the cities hardest  
hit by the cancellations. 
</P>
<P>
	Associated Global Systems, which ships machinery all over the  
world, stopped using American on Tuesday and was concerned about 
the effect of the sickout on its Latin American deliveries. It 
turned to Federal Express and United Parcel Service to substitute 
for its primary carrier, American, for shipments ranging from 
industrial parts to backhoes and forklifts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Service is what we're all about. Had we stayed with them, it  
would have been a complete disaster,'' said Anthony Vella, 
corporate supervisor for the New York-based Associated Global. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have alternate carriers that we use at a higher expense  
that cuts into our profit significantly, but it's service and it's 
our job to do it,'' Vella said. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta Air Lines at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International  
Airport appeared to benefit from its rivals' woes. 
</P>
<P>
	American sought to lease space from Delta, saying there was no  
room in Miami for goods it could not ship, said Denny Clark, a 
Delta cargo supervisor at the airport about 25 miles north of 
Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked whether Delta will lease the space, Clark said,  
``Sure, money is money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adriana Rehm, vice president of F C Forwarding, a small freight  
company which ships mostly to Latin America, was among those forced 
to make alternate arrangements to keep customers happy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ninety percent of our business is with American but we can't  
afford to risk our business,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Miami-based company, which exports an average of 20  
shipments a day, including live animals, computers and electronics 
machinery, is relying on the services of the Lan Chile airline. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't tell you we've lost money because there are other  
alternatives to American, but it has been a major inconvenience,'' 
Ms. Rehm said. ``We've had to scramble to get our stuff out on time 
and avoid customer dissatisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the shipments are delayed, the customer's business is  
affected. This in turn can lead to major problems in the economies 
of our countries -- if we do nothing about it.''

<HEADLINE> Tube Talk: Placing Songs on TV Shows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- On an early winter's night, songwriter John  
Hiatt hit the television jackpot. 
</P>
<P>
	Joey and Dawson were discussing their relationship again on  
``Dawson's Creek,'' wrestling over whether Joey would spend a 
semester in France. A piano in the background heralded Hiatt's 1987 
ballad, ``Have a Little Faith in Me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Less than an hour later on ``Party of Five,'' Julia and Ned were  
at his college dorm, trying to decide whether to break up. The 
music came in as an insistent plea: Hiatt's ``Have a Little Faith 
in Me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Watching with a sense of renewed appreciation for her dad was  
Hiatt's 14-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	``My stock went up with her and her friends quite a bit,'' he  
said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
	It did with his record company, too. The placement of songs in  
TV shows -- particularly those popular with a teen-aged audience -- 
are becoming a potent way to expose music and to juice sales. 
</P>
<P>
	It has to be just the right song, though. And just the right  
moment. Matching the two is the job of people like John McCullough, 
Hollywood's most respected music supervisor, who recommends songs 
to television producers to enhance their scenes. 
</P>
<P>
	Music has long played a vital role in movies, but less so in  
television comedies and dramas. McCullough's work has helped change 
the thinking of TV and music executives. 
</P>
<P>
	His placement of an Enya ballad added the perfect touch to a  
moonlit scene in ``Northern Exposure.'' The BoDeans' ``Closer to 
Free'' became a hit song when McCullough suggested it as the theme 
for ``Party of Five.'' Edwin McCain's ``I'll Be'' headed to the Top 
10 after it was used during a key scene in Dawson and Joey's 
endless soap opera. 
</P>
<P>
	Music is also frequently used on ``Homicide: Life on the  
Street,'' ``Providence'' and ``Beverly Hills 90210.'' Sometimes 
musicians come out from the background: ``Ally McBeal'' has made 
Vonda Shepard an integral part of the show, ``New York Undercover'' 
has acts like Tracy Chapman, Ray Charles and Nancy Wilson perform 
in a club featured in every episode of the series, and R.E.M. is 
taping an upcoming appearance on ``Party of Five.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hiatt was happy to grant permission to producers who wanted to  
use ``Have a Little Faith in Me.'' It has been used more than a 
dozen times in movies or television shows. 
</P>
<P>
	``I certainly would think that any time someone can hear your  
music, possibly for the first time, then that's a good thing,'' he 
said. ``As far as soaring record sales, I personally haven't 
experienced that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's still lucrative. A television producer generally pays a  
licensing fee to the song's publisher to use the song, and the 
writer receives royalties every time it is played. If the episode 
is rerun a lot and goes into syndication, a writer can really cash 
in. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though ``Have a Little Faith in Me'' never became a hit on  
the radio, the song he wrote in the mid-1980s to try and smooth a 
rough marriage has since become his signature. Audiences respond 
enthusiastically because of its exposure on screens. The marriage 
didn't last, but the song has. 
</P>
<P>
	McCullough actually chose other songs for those key ``Dawson's  
Creek'' and ``Party of Five'' moments. Producers insisted on Hiatt, 
but he has no complaints. ``It's an incredible song,'' he said. 
``It's always one of those songs that is just sitting there waiting 
for the right scene.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Finding a song to evoke a mood is a matter of instinct.  
McCullough stays away from the obvious -- he doesn't want viewers to 
say ``not that again'' -- and like any music fan, loves to introduce 
people to something new. He has recently used music by bluegrass 
artist Tony Ellis and the Peruvian musicians Duchichelo. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't use music for the sake of using it to be cool,'' he  
said. ``If it doesn't bring something to a scene or an episode, we 
don't use it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCullough knows he's struck the proper chord when the Internet  
is buzzing the next day about the song, and people call producers 
wanting to know the singer. One night, that realization came 
directly to him through a telephone call. 
</P>
<P>
	A friend was on the line, a music executive. He was driving up  
Ventura Boulevard late at night, searching for an open music store 
to buy a Heather Nova song his teen-age daughter simply had to have 
after hearing it on ``Dawson's Creek.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He was yelling at me,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	It isn't always easy to match music and television. Networks  
like to create their own background music because it's cheaper. 
Sometimes artists don't want their work on TV, or don't like a 
particular program. TV shows also generally can't afford the 
typical rate to license songs, so McCullough has to show executives 
how a discount may pay off in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've finally realized the value of 20 million viewers,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlantic Records saw the impact on McCain's ``I'll Be'' almost  
instantly. Sales of his album more than doubled the week after the 
song's appearance on ``Dawson's Creek, said Linda Ferrando, senior 
vice president at Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	Anxious to expose its music any way it can, Atlantic has  
aggressively sought these TV tie-ins. It has a significant 
advantage: the company's corporate parent, Time Warner, also owns 
the WB, the hot new network for teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had many meetings, deciding to really work together -- a  
`you help us, we'll help you' kind of thing,'' Ferrando said. ``We 
understand the WB network is targeting a specific audience and the 
music companies are targeting the same audience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Corporate synergy makes it easier, for example, for producers  
with shows on the WB to license songs from Time Warner labels. But 
it has its dangers: McCullough said producers of ``Dawson's Creek'' 
were pressured to include songs from Time Warner labels, but 
they've insisted on also using songs from other labels. 
</P>
<P>
	The executives walk a fine line with viewers. If they include  
too many Time Warner songs, viewers may suspect the music is a 
sales pitch instead of a key part of the show. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of each ``Dawson's Creek,'' producers flash a graphic  
giving the name of the artists featured in each show. Again, this 
is a danger zone: Do viewers consider this helpful information or 
just another commercial? 
</P>
<P>
	If the music isn't used judiciously, ``You're doing a disservice  
to your viewers,'' McCullough said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Your viewers are tuning in to that episode to be pulled in to  
all the characters' lives,'' he said. ``If you're not using a song 
that conveys a certain emotion or gets across what you're trying to 
say, then what are you doing it for?''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Little Changed; Dow Up 0.26 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock index were slightly changed at midday as  
market leader technology shares struggled to set a direction. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up  
0.26 at 9,133.29, after swinging narrowly between positive and 
negative in the first hour of trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Broad indexes were higher, with the Nasdaq composite up 24.75 at  
2,335.54, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index up 9.91 at 1,226.05. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors continued to sell Internet stocks in disappointment  
that Lycos didn't get a premium in its three-way deal with USA 
Networks Inc. and TicketMaster Online Citysearch Inc. Lycos' shares 
were down 11 5/16 at 82 15/16, pulling other Internet shares with 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	But unlike Tuesday, when computer shares were sold  
indiscriminantly, the shares of big computer companies were mixed 
today. IBM was up 2 1/4 at 165 on the Big Board. 
</P>
<P>
	In Nasdaq trading, Dell Computer was down 11/16 at 97 1/8, but  
Cisco Systems was up 1 7/8 at 97 13/16, and Microsoft was up 1 7/16 at 
16 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's been some real carnage, especially in the Internet  
world, and who knows where that stops,'' said Arthur Hogan, head 
trader at Jefferies &AMP; Co. in Boston. ``But people are realizing 
that even when you sell your Lycos and your Yahoo!, you don't sell 
your Microsoft, you don't sell your Intel, you don't sell your IBM. 
And so we're seeing some real bargain hunting'' in big technology 
shares. 
</P>
<P>
	A big loser among the Dow industrials was Philip Morris, down 3  
13/16 at 41 9/16. A jury awarded $1.5 million to a California woman 
who sued Philip Morris for negligence, liability and fraud tied to 
her smoking-related cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by 7 to 4 on the New York  
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 322.82 million shares, up from 
Tuesday's pace of 317.48 million.

<HEADLINE> Study Questions Some Transfusions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Cutting back on blood transfusions for the critically ill can  
actually improve some patients' chances of survival. 
</P>
<P>
	A new study by Canadian researchers questions the common  
practice of giving critically ill patients red blood cells when 
they become mildly anemic. It suggests that waiting until anemia is 
severe can save both money and lives. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was directed by Dr. Paul C. Hebert of the University  
of Ottawa and published in Thursday's New England Journal of 
Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Paradoxically, it found that when it comes to blood  
transfusions, less can be more: Younger and less critically ill 
patients were more likely to die if they got more transfusions. 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody is sure why this was so. However, other studies have  
suggested that red-cell transfusions may suppress the immune system 
and cause circulatory problems in the capillaries. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a landmark study. This is big-time,'' said Dr. Stephen  
Cohn, chief of trauma and surgical critical care at Jackson 
Memorial Hospital-University of Miami School of Medicine. He said 
it will have a far-reaching effect on the treatment of the 
criticallly ill. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohn and Dr. Robert Taylor, president of the Society for  
Critical Care Medicine, said they plan to use Hebert's guidelines 
in their hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor emphasized the findings don't apply to patients who are  
bleeding or suffering from heart attacks, cardiovascular disease or 
emphysema. 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody knows just how many patients the nation's ICUs treat a  
year, or how many transfusions they get. 
</P>
<P>
	But Cohn said one 20-bed intensive care unit at Jackson Memorial  
gave patients about 125 units of red cells a month in 1997. 
Hebert's findings would let the ICU eliminate at least one-third of 
those, Cohn said. At a conservative $200 per transfusion, that 
could mean $100,000 a year in savings in that ICU alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Red-cell transfusions are routine to fight anemia. However,  
doctors disagree on when they are needed. 
</P>
<P>
	The study involved 838 critically ill and anemic patients at  
hospitals across Canada. One group got transfusions when they were 
slightly anemic, as measured by their hemoglobin levels. The other 
got transfusions only when they were severely anemic. 
</P>
<P>
	The 420 patients in the liberal transfusion group got an average  
of 5.6 units of blood each. The 418 in the restrictive group 
averaged 2.6 units; one-third of them did not get any transfusions 
at all. 
</P>
<P>
	Seventy-eight patients in the restrictive group died within 30  
days, compared with 98 in the group that got more transfusions. 
That difference wasn't considered significant. 
</P>
<P>
	But there was a big difference in the percentage of younger and  
less sick patients who died. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the patients under 55, 5.7 percent of those in the  
restrictive group died within 30 days, compared with 13 percent of 
those in the liberal transfusion group. Among those who were less 
critically ill, the figures were 8.7 percent and 16.1 percent.

<HEADLINE>  More IOC Members Implicated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The U.S. Olympic Committee was linked for  
the first time to possible corruption and 10 more International 
Olympic Committee members were implicated for accepting extravagant 
gifts as part of a widening bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	A 300-page report issued Tuesday by a Salt Lake Organizing  
Committee ethics panel provided the first detailed glimpse of the 
way IOC members -- now numbered at 24, roughly a fifth of IOC 
membership -- had their hands out. The report said there were more 
than $1 million worth of cash payments, scholarships, shopping 
sprees, vacations and medical expenses as Salt Lake bid for the 
2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The extremes to which bid executives obliged, sharing another $1  
million worth of donated air fares, hotel rooms and shopping with 
IOC members, were unethical, the panel concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	But the panel's report also demonstrated that senior U.S.  
Olympic Committee staffers seemed willing to curry favor with an 
IOC member from Sudan, whose country's athletes were being trained 
in the United States with Salt Lake money. 
</P>
<P>
	And in yet another setback for Olympic leaders, a major sponsor,  
John Hancock Insurance, said it was canceling negotiations with NBC 
for $20 million in ads to protest the IOC's failure to deal with 
the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah Gov. Mike Leavitt suggested every bid city undergo the  
wrenching self-scrutiny that Salt Lake City has suffered the past 
seven weeks on its path to setting a new standard of 
``forthrightness'' in the Olympic world. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know what happened here was not right. So we're setting it  
right and we're paving the way for others to do the same,'' Leavitt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics panel report called on the IOC and USOC to reform,  
including prohibitions on bid cities from having National Olympic 
Committees such as the one that was the conduit for much of Salt 
Lake's excesses. The panel also urged rules with teeth on IOC 
member-bid city relations and regular reporting of money spent on 
IOC members by bid cities. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics panel blamed two men for the pandering: Tom Welch,  
bid committee president, and David Johnson, his vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	While Welch and Johnson were cast as the champions who brought  
the games to Salt Lake, the ethics report also cast them as two 
rogues who turned the city's legitimate lobbying effort into a 
secretive, no-holds-barred mission to win votes. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said the strategy had its roots in Salt Lake's  
four-vote loss to Nagano, Japan, for the 1998 Games. Welch, who 
told investigators he had turned down two offers of IOC influence 
for cash on the eve of that vote, apparently felt he had to up the 
ante if Salt Lake City was ever going to secure the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Four IOC members have resigned and five have been expelled so  
far, and the IOC indicated today it is prepared to consider 
expelling more members. 
</P>
<P>
	``The IOC remains fully committed to investigating and taking  
action based on all available evidence,'' the IOC said in a 
statement. ``The IOC executive board expects to receive the 
earliest possible recommendations of the ad-hoc commission after 
its review of the SLOC Board of Ethics report.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IOC executive board delegate Jacques Rogge, a member of the  
IOC's internal investigative panel, said he had not yet seen the 
report and could not comment in detail. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to look into it -- that's our mandate, to cover  
everything regarding Salt Lake City,'' he told The Associated 
Press. ``We expect to call for a meeting to review the report.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rogge said a key issue for the IOC panel will be to determine  
whether members were guilty of actual ethical violations. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to differentiate between what is a breach of the  
line, and what is so-called `lavish treatment,''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the 10 newly implicated IOC members, Phillip Coles of  
Australia and Willi Kaltschmitt of Guatemala appear to have 
benefited the most. 
</P>
<P>
	The two men and their families made four vacation trips together  
to the United States, staying in expensive hotels and enjoying 
recreational outings. One of those trips was to the Super Bowl, and 
Welch and the bid committee picked up the $19,991 tab. Coles 
stepped down today from Sydney's organizing committee board for the 
2000 Summer Olympics, pending an IOC inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	Austin Sealy of Barbados, another of the 10 newly named IOC  
members, received $3,000 monthly payments through a company 
affiliated with a consultant, according to bid records the panel 
reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
	The others newly implicated were Maj. Gen. Henry Edmund Olufemi  
Adefope, Nigeria; Ashwini Kumar, India; Shagdarjav Magvan, 
Mongolia; Anani Matthia, Togo; Rampaul Ruhee, Mauritius; Siuli Paul 
Wallwork, Western Samoa; and Mohamed Zerguini, Algeria. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the more disturbing findings in the board of ethics  
report provide examples of disgusting and disguised transactions 
and phony contracts,'' said Robert Garff, chairman of the Salt Lake 
Organizing Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The report cited the USOC's involvement by detailing a November  
1995 e-mail exchange among three USOC staff directors. It contained 
repeated references to an agreement to help train athletes from the 
Sudan at USOC facilities as part of Salt Lake City's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of promises were made to secure votes,'' wrote Alfredo  
La Mont, who, at the time, was the USOC's director for 
international relations. 
</P>
<P>
	When Jim Page, the USOC's deputy executive director for  
programs, balked at picking up Salt Lake's portion of the training 
cost after the city was awarded the 2002 Games, Tom Wilkinson, then 
assistant executive director, said it had to be paid because ``a 
deal is a deal and Sudan delivered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``May need Sudan again in future,'' Wilkinson wrote. ``Don't  
burn bridges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That appeared to be a reference to the Sudanese IOC member, Gen.  
Zein El Abdin Ahmed Abdel Gadir, one of the nine IOC delegates who 
have been expelled or resigned. 
</P>
<P>
	The USOC denied that it was part of any quid pro quo.  
</P>
<P>
	``We were committed to help Salt Lake's bid, and to the extent  
that finding places at our training center for qualified athletes 
might have helped convince Sudan's IOC member to vote for it, we 
were pleased to do so. That was proper,'' USOC spokesman Mike Moran 
said. ``But we did not take part in any effort to buy his vote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moran called Wilkinson's comments ``very unfortunate,'' but  
conceded that La Mont's reference to promises connected to votes 
should have triggered some sort of USOC inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	La Mont has since resigned his USOC position.  
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, David D'Alessandro, president and chief operations  
officer of John Hancock, was bitterly critical of most of the IOC 
leadership, including president Juan Antonio Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he stopped talks with NBC to pressure the network -- the  
single biggest revenue source for the IOC with a $3.57 billion 
rights contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to buy a nickel of advertising on NBC until we  
are confident the IOC is going in the right direction,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC marketing director Michael Payne downplayed the Hancock move  
and said the rest of the committee's sponsors were ``standing, 
first of all, behind the games, and, second, behind the steps and 
action the IOC is taking'' to clean house. 
</P>
<P>
	In Sweden, the newspaper Dagens Nyheter reported that  
Stockholm's bid for the 2004 Olympics paid for the medical care of 
IOC members or their relatives on five occasions. The newspaper 
said each of the payments amounted to more than the $150 limit for 
gifts. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that Olympic chief  
Billy Payne suggested a college tennis scholarship, medical 
treatment and free plane tickets as gifts for IOC members in a memo 
written before the city won the 1996 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Payne said the suggestions never were acted upon and called the  
ideas ``out of bounds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the Salt Lake report found While Jean-Claude Ganga, the  
IOC member from the Republic of Congo, got $250,000 -- the highest 
sum going to any IOC member's family -- it could not be determined 
whether he turned the money over to sporting groups in his country, 
as he claims. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the committee's more unusual relationships, according to  
the report, were the efforts on behalf of Sonia Essomba, the 
daughter of Rene Essomba of Cameroon, who died in August. Not only 
did it give her $108,350 in tuition and living expenses, but Welch 
dispatched his secretary to help her move furniture to a new 
apartment in Washington and acted as her attorney in breaking her 
old lease. 
</P>
<P>
	Essomba himself got $60,000 in cash from the bid committee.  
</P>
<P>
	Welch and Johnson have denied wrongdoing and on Tuesday, Tom  
Schaffer, Welch's attorney, said the report reinforced what Welch 
has been contending: that there was no bribery, no exchange of 
gifts for votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch contends he was only building friendships with IOC  
members, not buying their votes, and that members of the bid 
committee board were aware of the spending. Leavitt, bid chairman 
Frank Joklik and others named by Welch have repeatedly denied 
knowledge of the details of the gift plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics panel inquiry is just one of five investigations into  
Olympic misconduct. The others include probes by the IOC, USOC, 
Justice Department and Utah attorney general. The General 
Accounting Office, Congress' investigative arm, is moving ahead 
with an inquiry into how the Salt Lake Games are benefiting by what 
is certain to be millions of dollars in federal aid. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics panel conducted hundreds of hours of interviews and  
reviewed 50,000 pages of documents before issuing its report. 
</P>
<P>
	The SLOC, which will stage the games beginning three years from  
this week, will be reorganized Thursday and take up recommendations 
from the ethics panel. Among the recommendations are that SLOC have 
twice yearly reviews of significant spending and that it create an 
ombudsman so employees can report suspicions about ethical lapses.

<HEADLINE> Wasteful Government Spending Eyed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With over $30 billion wasted through fraud and  
mismanagement at federal agencies, Congress ought to withhold money 
from programs that can't get their act together, a House chairman 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a long way to go before the American people get their  
money's worth from the federal government,'' Rep. Dan Burton, 
R-Ind., chairman of the House Government Reform and Oversight 
Committee, said at a hearing on how to make agencies more 
accountable for the money they spend and oversee. 
</P>
<P>
	Burton said he uncovered examples of billions of dollars wasted  
in a variety of housing, welfare and health programs. Many show up 
year after year on a list of problem programs compiled by federal 
watchdogs. The list grew to 26 wasteful programs this year from 14 
in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ten of these problems have been on the list since its  
inception'' a decade ago, said Burton. ``All this makes me wonder 
when, if ever, we are going to get some meaningful results here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats on the committee contended that social programs aren't  
the only places where waste occurs in government. They said 
military programs lose billions each year due to mismanagement and 
fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee will present highlights from investigative reports  
written by inspector generals, the internal watchdogs who police 
federal agencies for waste, fraud and abuse. Burton said the 
reports paint an alarming picture of systematic waste and fraud 
costing taxpayers billions each year. 
</P>
<P>
	One example is Medicare, which lost an estimated $20 billion  
from improper payments in 1997. An audit released Tuesday by the 
Health and Human Services Department estimated that improper 
Medicare payments dropped to $12.6 billion last year. More than 
half the excessive charges was for services deemed medically 
unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
	The $12.6 billion amounted to about 7 cents out of every dollar  
that was spent by Medicare in direct payments to health care 
providers, including doctors and hospitals. By comparison, in 1996 
-- the first year such estimates were made -- improper Medicare 
payments were estimated at $23.2 billion, or 14 cents of each 
dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	``It shows a significant turnaround,'' said HHS Inspector  
General June Gibbs Brown, who attributed the improvement to 
stricter government supervision. She is scheduled to testify at the 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest audit show hospitals received most of the improper  
payments in 1998. Home health care companies showed the biggest 
improvement, with excessive payments dropping to $800 million from 
$2.5 billion in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Burton called the audit encouraging but said the level of  
improper payments is still unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're applauding this? This is still an outrageous amount of  
waste,'' Burton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other examples of waste to be examined by lawmakers:  
</P>
<P>
	--SBA auditors found that the agency lost about $56 million on  
loans liquidated in 1994 because of errors made in the liquidation 
process by lenders and SBA officials. 
</P>

<HEADLINE>  Judge Orders Pilots To Halt Sickout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- A federal judge ordered pilots at American  
Airlines Wednesday to end a sickout that has grounded 2,500 
flights, stranded an estimated 200,000 travelers and left 
businesses scrambling to find new ways to ship cargo. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Joe Kendall chided the pilots union and the  
airline in issuing a temporary restraining order and told them to 
resume negotiating. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's silly for us to even be here,'' he said. ``It's like  
killing a gnat with a sledge hammer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall told the pilots to return to work Thursday and warned  
they could be held in contempt of court if they don't. He also 
placed some blame for the dispute on the airline. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you would look up bad labor relations in the dictionary,  
you would have an American Airlines logo beside it,'' Kendall said. 
</P>
<P>
	AMR Corp., the airline's parent company, had asked for the  
judge's order. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're threatening to bring the airline to a complete halt,''  
AMR attorney Dee Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilots began calling in sick and refusing overtime Saturday  
after talks broke down with the company about the salaries paid 
pilots of Reno Air, which AMR recently acquired. American pilots 
are barred by federal law from striking over the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Reno pilots make half the $164,000 a year that an  
experienced American pilot makes and the American pilots want AMR 
to add Reno pilots to the higher pay scale quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	AMR said that it will take about 12 to 18 months do that and the  
pilot union's demands would cost as much as $50 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline estimated that 2,077 of the 9,400 American pilots  
called in sick Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	AMR spokesman Chris Chiames said the company believed the pilots  
would abide by the judge's order. ``We have never questioned a 
pilot that has called in sick. We just hope they will all get 
better soon,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the pilots' union was not immediately available  
to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, passengers struggled through another day of  
delays. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicole Travis, 15, of Long Island, N.Y. found herself stuck in  
Chicago, a city she had no intention of visiting. Travis said she 
stood in line for four hours at LaGuardia Airport in New York, then 
got booked on a United Airlines flight to Chicago's O'Hare 
International Airport, hoping eventually to get to a planned 
vacation with relatives in Tampa, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was supposed to be an eight-day vacation but now it's only  
seven days. This day was wasted,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Erin McGrath was angry at the pilots because she got stuck after  
a business trip to West Palm Beach, Fla. She waited in line at the 
Ft. Lauderdale airport Wednesday for a rental car so she could 
drive to Miami for a flight to San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm waiting for the time when unions and employees realize  
that they don't have to share in every penny of their company's 
profits. It seems like the only people they are hurting are the 
ones that pay their bills.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, some praised American employees for being friendly and  
helpful in getting them booked on other flights. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlie Hall of Dallas arrived in Chicago on a United flight  
that American helped him book. ``I can't complain except that I 
lost frequent flier miles,'' said Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss of American's cargo services was causing heartburn at  
Gladstone's 4 Fish restaurant in Malibu, Calif., where supplies of 
succulent dungeness crab from Alaska were dwindling. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gladstones has no freezers or microwaves. All of our food is  
fresh,'' said spokeswoman Christine Lloyd. ``Our produce and fish 
is delivered daily, including Sunday. We rely heavily on things 
coming in every day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Miami, F C Forwarding, a small freight company that ships  
live animals, computers, and electronics -- mostly to Latin America 
-- decided earlier this week to find other shippers. 
</P>
<P>
	Adriana Rehm, a vice president, said does about 20 shipments a  
day, almost all with American. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't tell you we've lost money because there are other  
alternatives to American, but it has been a major inconvenience,'' 
Ms. Rehm said. ``We've had to scramble to get our stuff out on time 
and avoid customer dissatisfaction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	TWA, Delta and other airlines accepted American tickets in the  
same price class and waived the customary change of flight fee, as 
part of a common pact made between airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're picking them up wherever we fly if American operates  
there, too,'' said Delta spokesman Bill Berry. 
</P>
<P>
	Airline analyst Raymond Neidl with Furman Selz Inc., estimated  
American is losing about $19 million a day in revenue -- or $1.5 
million a day in profits. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he doubted the airline has alienated customers for the  
long term. 
</P>
<P>
	``The key question is how quickly will this business come back  
to American, and my guess is pretty quickly,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> House Praises King Hussein </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House approved without dissent Wednesday a  
resolution praising the late King Hussein of Jordan for his 
``enlightened leadership'' and his efforts to bring peace to the 
Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
	The resolution, passed 420-0, also expressed U.S. support for  
the new government under Hussein's son, King Abdullah II. The 
Senate approved the resolution Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Ben Gilman, R-N.Y., the International Relations Committee  
chairman, who represented the House at Hussein's funeral Monday, 
said Hussein was a ``true survivor'' who ``succeeded through the 
sheer force of will as well as his dedication, his persistence and 
his vision for a brighter future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Minority Whip David Bonior, D-Mich., who also attended the  
funeral in Amman, Jordan, praised the king as ``a man of honor, a 
man of wisdom and, beyond anything else, a man of peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``King Hussein contributed to the cause of peace with tireless  
energy,'' the resolution said. Congress ``extends its deepest 
sympathy and condolences to the family of King Hussein and to all 
the people of Jordan in this difficult time,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	The resolution expresses ``support and best wishes for the new  
government of Jordan under King Abdullah'' and reiterates a U.S. 
commitment ``to strengthening the vital relationship between our 
two governments and people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The resolution is to be sent to Hussein's family.

<HEADLINE> Sciatica Not Helped by Bed Rest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Sciatica, like other types of back ailments, doesn't necessarily  
get any better with bed rest, researchers reported today in the New 
England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	A week or two in bed used to be routine treatment for any sort  
of aching back. But over the past 15 years, doctors have learned 
that many types of backaches get better just as fast if people go 
about their normal activities. 
</P>
<P>
	Until now, that hadn't been tested with sciatica, pain from the  
sciatic nerve -- usually just in the buttocks and thigh, but 
sometimes to the foot. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Patrick C.A.J. Vroomen of Maastricht University Hospital in  
the Netherlands, where two weeks of bed rest is a common treatment 
for sciatica, studied 183 patients assigned either to bed rest or 
``watchful waiting'' -- getting up and about whenever possible 
without straining the back or provoking pain. 
</P>
<P>
	After two weeks, 70 percent of the 92 patients who got out of  
bed only to bathe or use the toilet felt better. So did 65 percent 
of those who were up and about. Statistically, those are the same. 
</P>
<P>
	After 12 weeks, 87 percent of the patients in each group felt  
better. 
</P>
<P>
	``We found no evidence that bed rest is an effective treatment  
for patients with sciatica,'' Vroomen said.

<HEADLINE> Ohio State Track Athlete Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Ohio State's Jimmy Redmond, kicked off the  
football team because of legal problems, may also lose his spot on 
the track team after being charged early Wednesday with criminal 
damaging and assault. 
</P>
<P>
	Redmond, 21, a junior from Lee's Summit, Mo., was arrested after  
allegedly punching and kicking holes in the walls and a closet door 
at the apartment of Ruchee Sachdeva. 
</P>
<P>
	The police complaint also says Redmond grabbed hold of Sachdeva,  
threw her to the ground and caused an abrasion on her nose. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said when they arrived, he produced an altered or  
fictitious ID. 
</P>
<P>
	Redmond, a reserve flanker on the football team last fall, was  
kicked off the team last month after his arrest on charges of 
drunken driving, menacing, operating a vehicle under suspension and 
reckless operation. His trial on those charges is scheduled to 
start Feb. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	Redmond, a sprinter, subsequently joined the track team. At the  
time, track coach Russ Rogers said he would not permit any more 
problems from Redmond. He said Redmond would sign a list of 10 
requirements to stay in good standing with the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he doesn't follow those rules, then we're going to kick him  
off the track team,'' Rogers said two weeks ago.

<HEADLINE> Transplant Drug May Speed Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Cyclosporine, a drug given to transplant patients to prevent  
organ rejection, may turn pre-existing cancer more aggressive, 
researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
	Transplants always carried the risk of cancer because doctors  
must suppress the immune system with powerful drugs such as 
cyclosporine to prevent the patient's body from attacking the new 
organ. 
</P>
<P>
	But previously it was believed the cancer risk increased because  
the weakened immune system failed to destroy defective cells that 
could turn malignant. 
</P>
<P>
	``This study suggests the drug has a direct effect on the tumor  
cell and enhances it growth,'' said Dr. Gary Nabel, a University of 
Michigan researcher who specializes in the immune system. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was conducted by Cornell University researchers and  
published in Thursday's issue of the journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors were quick to caution that the findings will not affect  
treatment of transplant patients because it applies only to cancer 
that has already formed. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, they emphasized the study provides an important clue  
about blocking cancer growth. 
</P>
<P>
	``If anything, it's a reason for hope,'' said Dr. Manikkam  
Suthanthiran, chief of transplant medicine at Cornell. 
</P>
<P>
	Suthanthiran and his colleagues isolated human lung and bladder  
cancer cells that were treated with cyclosporine. They also 
injected cancerous cells into specially bred mice that had 
virtually no immune system. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings indicated that cyclosporine promotes the production  
of a natural protein called transforming growth factor beta, 
already a suspect in cancer growth. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our findings in no way mean this is increasing the incidence  
of cancer,'' Suthanthiran said. ``It more reflects that cancer can 
be made more aggressive by a certain protein.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added that the study reveals a potential mechanism for  
blocking cancer by inhibiting the production of TGF beta. 
</P>
<P>
	Cyclosporine, which is also used to treat arthritis, is made by  
the Swiss-based pharmaceutical giant Novartis. Geoff Cook, a 
Novartis spokesman, said the company sees no cause for concern. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Israel Penn, a transplant pioneer at the University of  
Cincinnati, said only a small proportion of transplant patients 
have pre-existing cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the tens of thousands of people receiving cyclosporine for  
years with very beneficial results, the good far, far outweighs the 
bad,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Citigroup To Switch to MasterCard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Citigroup Inc. is shaking up the credit card  
industry by snubbing the Visa brand name in favor of MasterCard. 
</P>
<P>
	Citigroup, one of the nation's top credit card issuers, made the  
move after a weeks-long spat with Visa's directors that resulted in 
Citigroup chairman John Reed and another senior executive resigning 
from the group's board Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Reed had wanted to banish the Visa logo to the back of  
Citigroup's credit cards in order to raise the profile of the 
bank's own ``Citi'' brand. The directors of Visa, owned by a 
coalition of banks across the country, feared the move would weaken 
the Visa name. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, any new cards issued by Citigroup would no  
longer carry the Visa logo, only MasterCard. As existing Visa cards 
expire over the next several years, they would be replaced with 
MasterCards. 
</P>
<P>
	MasterCard, which has seen its share of the credit card market  
decline for more than 20 years, offered to give Citigroup a 
discount in its dues, and agreed to move the MasterCard symbol to 
the back of the card, said David Robertson, president of The Nilson 
Report, an industry newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
	Citigroup ``got a sweetheart deal from MasterCard,'' said  
Robertson. ``That's money that flows right to the bottom line.'' 
Last year Citigroup paid Visa dues totaling between $75 million and 
$100 million, according to an industry source. 
</P>
<P>
	New York-based Citigroup would only confirm that it has resigned  
from the Visa board and made no comment about its future with 
MasterCard. A spokeswoman for MasterCard also would not comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Citigroup is already a major issuer of MasterCard credit cards,  
which make up 53 percent of the company's cards. But the Visa cards 
are more heavily used, accounting for 55 percent of Citigroup's 
credit card balances. 
</P>
<P>
	Community banks and credit unions are outraged over Citigroup's  
tough stand on promoting its own name over the credit card brand. 
They fear the move could erode the status of the Visa name and 
shift power in the industry to a handful of large banks that may 
follow Citigroup's lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``We find what John Reed is doing is very destructive to the  
thousands of banks, credit unions and savings an loans that connect 
into the Visa brand and find worldwide acceptance through it,'' 
said Kenneth Guenther, executive vice president of the Independent 
Bankers Association of America. ``I understand John Reed is not 
interested in sharing and wants it all to himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Citigroup is the second-largest credit card issuer in the United  
States with $69.6 billion in consumer credit card balances, 
slightly behind BancOne's First USA subsidiary with $69.9 billion, 
according to the Nilson newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
	MasterCard, desperate to regain some of its lost business, was  
eager to please Citigroup. Purchase, N.Y.-based MasterCard has seen 
its market share fall to 33 percent last year from 38 percent a 
decade ago, while Visa's share has climbed to 67 percent from 62 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But Citigroup is prevented by several contracts from moving much  
of its existing business from Visa to MasterCard. Citigroup 
promised to send its new business to MasterCard, and to switch 
expiring Visa cards with MasterCard credit cards over a three-year 
period, Robertson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Citibank's growth has been lackluster for years,'' he said.  
``Unless they begin to turn that around, that is not necessarily a 
huge change.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Turn Higher; Dow Up 26.00 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock indexes moved higher in late morning after  
a shaky opening, as computer-related technology shares rallied. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 26.00 at 9,159.03, after swinging between positive and negative 
in the first hour of trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also moved higher, with the Nasdaq  
composite up 24.75 at 2,335.54, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index 
up 9.91 at 1,226.05. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer stocks were higher after a mixed opening. Dow member  
IBM was up 2 1/8 at 164 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasdaq stocks were led higher by Dell Computer, up 1 3/8 at 99  
3/16, Cisco Systems, up 2 1/4 at 98 3/16, and Microsoft, up 2 13/16 at 
162 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
	But concerns that Lycos didn't get a premium in its three-way  
deal with USA Networks Inc. and TicketMaster Online Citysearch Inc. 
pushed Lycos' shares down 10 3/8 at 83 7/8. But the rest of the Internet 
sector was mixed, with Yahoo! up 5 at 145 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	A big loser among the Dow industrials was Philip Morris, down 2 5/8  
at 42 3/4. A jury awarded $1.5 million to a California woman who sued 
Philip Morris for negligence, liability and fraud tied to her 
smoking-related cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by more than 4 to 3 on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 227.54 million 
shares, up from Tuesday's pace.

<HEADLINE> NASCAR Faces Change in Leadership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- For the first time since the France  
family founded NASCAR a half century ago, an outsider will run the 
circuit's daily operations. 
</P>
<P>
	NASCAR president Bill France Jr. turned over control to Mike  
Helton on Wednesday. Helton, the vice president of competition the 
past five years, becomes senior vice president and chief operating 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
	France said he doesn't consider Helton an outsider anymore,  
making the decision a simple one. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's levelheaded, he thinks before he acts,'' France said of  
Helton, who has worked for his family since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've always tried to operate here with the philosophy of  
looking at short-term benefits vs. long-term negatives and vice 
versa. Mike has a great understanding of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Helton said the move did not foreshadow a big change in the way  
NASCAR operates. And he emphasized that France will still be 
president of the circuit and working across the hall from him. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most important thing that everyone should understand is  
that there's nothing broken in the system,'' Helton said. ``There's 
not necessarily a need for change in direction as much as there is 
for continual management of NASCAR as it goes forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The front-office move is the first of several that are expected  
to help NASCAR manage its growth. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrangement may take some getting used to. It was France's  
late father, Bill France Sr., who founded the circuit in 1947 and 
had a heavy hand in the decision-making until he retired in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, France Jr.'s son, Brian France, is expected to take  
over. Meanwhile, the 66-year-old France said he has no immediate 
intentions of retiring. 
</P>
<P>
	Helton, 45, got into racing in 1980 as public relations director  
at Atlanta International Raceway. Since starting work for the 
France family, he has served as director of promotions at Daytona 
and general manager and president at Talladega Superspeedway. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has a unique experience of being involved in all aspects of  
the sport, including marketing, PR, licensing and most importantly, 
our core business, which is racing,'' France said. 
</P>
<P>
	Helton's promotion formalized a chain of command that began  
taking form a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mike has been in the saddle, he's got total credibility and  
respect out there in the garage area,'' France said. ``When you 
start talking to race teams out there, that's going to be your 
ultimate answer and I'm totally confident in how that's going to 
work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before practice for Sunday's Daytona 500 began, the good reviews  
began streaming in. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mike Helton will do a great job,'' said Roush Racing owner  
Jack Roush. ``Mike has got maturity, he's got wisdom, he's 
certainly embroiled in France's philosophy of stock car racing, so 
it will be fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seven-time Winston Cup champion Dale Earnhardt agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a good move,'' he said. ``The business has grown  
so big, it's hard for any one man to cover it all. But I don't 
think that there's a decision that goes on that Mr. France isn't in 
on. I'm sure he's not going anywhere any time soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earnhardt said Helton earned his respect in his four years  
dealing directly with the competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got great rapport with people in the garage area and he's  
learned a lot from Mr. France about making logical decisions,'' 
Earnhardt said. ``He's a fair man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	France said Helton will have final say in almost every decision  
that comes out of NASCAR, ``and in most cases, he'll be leading 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That doesn't mean, however that NASCAR has seen the last of its  
president. 
</P>
<P>
	``It depends on how the fish are biting, to some extent,''  
France said. ``But in all seriousness, if Mike thinks he needs some 
help, I'd be happy to.''

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Fall / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices fell Tuesday as the stock market  
stabilized after Tuesday's steep selloff and as the government 
continued a week of heavy borrowing. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 29/32  
point, or $9.06 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in 
the opposite direction, rose to 5.36 percent from 5.30 percent late 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices slipped as the Dow Jones industrial average rose in  
the afternoon, recovering some of the big losses of the day before. 
The broader stock market, which also was pummeled Tuesday, turned 
mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	Treasury bonds had gained Tuesday as investors sought a haven  
for their funds during the stock market's turbulence. As the market 
leveled off, money came out of government bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, traders were assessing demand for the government's  
latest auctions. The Treasury sold $10 billion in 10-year notes 
Wednesday and still has an auction of $10 billion in 30-year bonds 
on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities

<HEADLINE> Senior Students Inspired by Classes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYLVANIA, Ohio (AP) -- Standing in his cap and gown while waiting  
to speak before beaming relatives, Elliott Gottlieb got nervous. 
</P>
<P>
	He had never done anything like this before and wondered whether  
anything would come out when he started to speak. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet as he slowly stepped in front of the audience it all seemed  
to flow: The story of watching all three of his children graduate 
from college and the embarrassment he felt from dropping out of 
high school nearly 60 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have regretted it ever since,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The 76-year-old who turned a small Toledo furniture shop into a  
bustling business was proud to say he had achieved his goal -- he 
received his General Equivalency Diploma. 
</P>
<P>
	Gottlieb and others his age are from a generation that couldn't  
easily attend college or in some cases finish high school. But 
today they are returning to the classroom not only to further their 
education but to retain their vigor and vitality. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're remnants of the Depression and World War II,'' said  
Margaret Katzan, director of the University of Toledo's program for 
students over 60. ``They have an opportunity that was never there 
before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are more than 100 of these ``new'' students at Toledo.  
They are enrolled in music, art, history and computer science. Some 
are quite serious about their studies. Others simply enjoy being 
around younger students who see them as living history books. 
</P>
<P>
	``They get to talk to people who aren't talking about which leg  
is aching today,'' Katzan said. ``They can be a part of life rather 
than watching it disappear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's not just all classes and homework for these senior  
students. 
</P>
<P>
	They write plays, volunteer at inner-city schools reading to  
children and sing in the school chorus. One man played tuba in 
Toledo's marching band a few years back. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1975, all Ohioans age 60 and older have been able to take  
college classes for free at the state's public colleges and 
universities. At most schools, though, the senior students can't 
get credit for the courses. 
</P>
<P>
	However, in early December, state lawmakers approved a bill that  
will give low-income Ohioans age 60 and older free tuition at any 
state college or university, allowing them to take classes for 
credit at no charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Jo Ann Ramisch, 70, received her undergraduate degree last year  
and is working on a master's in children's literature at Toledo, 
which offers free classes for credit. She's also putting her school 
work to use tutoring and reading to underprivileged kids. 
</P>
<P>
	She missed out on college the first time around because her  
family couldn't afford it and at that time it wasn't a priority. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just a given that the boys had to get an education,''  
she said. ``That was just not so with the girls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Kotecki is taking math and art classes ``just to keep my  
mind active. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen a lot of people, once they retire, deteriorate  
mentally and physically,'' said Kotecki, 66, who lives in a Toledo 
suburb. 
</P>
<P>
	He left college in the early 1950s after one year to join the  
Marines. He has noticed that campus life seems the same. 
</P>
<P>
	``The students -- they're still into drinking beer and having  
parties,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Norma Cox calls herself a late bloomer. The 60-year-old takes  
classes at Bowling Green State University and works part time in 
the school's admission office. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't realize that I had a mind that could be challenged,''  
she said. ``Who says you can't keep learning?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gottlieb isn't sure whether he'll continue his education.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a little late for college, but my kids are on my back to  
take some classes,'' he said. Just getting his equivalency diploma 
was reward enough. 
</P>
<P>
	He dropped out in 1939 after his mother died, despite getting  
good grades. He was having trouble at home and looking for an 
adventure. 
</P>
<P>
	So Gottlieb and four friends decided to quit school and join the  
Air Force. But military doctors found a spot on his lung that 
stopped him from joining the others in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of my buddies never came back,'' he said, looking down at  
his folded hands. 
</P>
<P>
	He went into the furniture business, learning it from the bottom  
up while lugging sofas and iron bathtubs in and out of homes. 
</P>
<P>
	``They weighed more than we did,'' he remembered.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1949, Gottlieb opened his own furniture store and, as luck  
would have it, a new freeway opened and brought thousands of baby 
boomers to his store for more than 30 years. He left the business 
in 1984 and dabbled in sales before retiring. 
</P>
<P>
	He had just about anything a person could want -- a comfortable  
home, golf all day and three children with successful careers. 
</P>
<P>
	Still something was missing.  
</P>
<P>
	``All my kids are college graduates and I didn't even have a  
high school diploma,'' he recalled thinking. 
</P>
<P>
	So, with some nudging from the family, he decided to take the  
GED test. His oldest grandson, a 13-year-old, helped him catch up 
on geometry. 
</P>
<P>
	He passed easily and was asked to address fellow graduates at a  
ceremony in early November. Reluctantly, he accepted. 
</P>
<P>
	``When my son and two daughters began school, I made a vow that  
they were not going to follow in my footsteps. They were going to 
have a college education if I had anything to say about it,'' 
Gottlieb told the audience. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am proud to say that my wish came true.''

<HEADLINE> Grounded Oregon Ship To Be Towed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COOS BAY, Ore. (AP) -- Salvage crews prepared to tie cables to a  
grounded cargo ship in the first step toward hauling it off the 
beach where it has been leaking oil from ruptured fuel tanks for 
three days. 
</P>
<P>
	A 200-foot tugboat was to make its way today to the side of the  
639-foot New Carissa just north of Coos Bay, where it has been 
stuck in the sand and pounded by surf since running aground 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a saying in the salvage industry: The ship will come  
when it wants to come, and stay as long as it wants to lay there,'' 
said Bill Milwee, a Portland salvage consultant representing the 
Japanese ship owners. ``We hope it doesn't want to stay there 
long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plans call for the tug to drop three heavy anchors in the sea,  
then run some 2 1/2-inch cables from its heavy-duty winches to the New 
Carissa. Pulling against the anchors, the tug crew will tighten the 
cables to stop the ship from rolling in the surf against the sandy 
bottom. 
</P>
<P>
	As tides and conditions permit, powerful pumps will suck sand  
from beneath the New Carissa as the tug works to haul it free. 
</P>
<P>
	Preparations were also made for pumping the fuel off the ship  
into containers on the beach in case efforts to haul the ship into 
deeper water fail. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, about 200 people have been mobilized to clean up the  
gooey residue of leaking bunker fuel that has washed ashore along 
six miles of beach southwest of Eugene. 
</P>
<P>
	Crews equipped to deal with oiled wildlife were standing by in  
case the slick moves into the nearby habitat of the Western snowy 
plover, a threatened shore bird. Several birds have been found 
coated with fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard said three of the ship's five fuel tanks were  
leaking and one, containing heavy bunker oil, was ``seriously 
breached.'' Those three tanks hold 140,000 gallons of oil and 
diesel; all five tanks together hold nearly 400,000 gallons. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, the Exxon Valdez spewed nearly 11 million gallons  
of oil into the Prince William Sound in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're skating on the edge here, hoping, praying, working hard  
to avoid a disaster,'' said Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., following a 
helicopter tour of the affected coastline. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a report issued Tuesday in Alaska said that only two  
of the nearly two dozen species of animals hurt by the Valdez spill 
are fully recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	The Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council, a state-federal  
panel, added river otters to its list of species considered 
recovered. Bald eagles were declared recovered 2 1/2 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The spill in Prince William Sound fouled 1,300 miles of pristine  
shore, killed hundreds of thousands of sea birds, about 250 bald 
eagles, 300 seals and other animals. It also disrupted salmon and 
herring fisheries for years. 
</P>
<P>
	The trustees boosted the status of several species from ``not  
recovering'' to ``recovering.'' They include clams, Pacific 
herring, sea otters, black oyster catchers and marbled murrelets. 
</P>
<P>
	Several species show little or no clear improvement since the  
spill, the council said. They include the common loon, cormorants, 
harbor seals, harlequin ducks, killer whales and pigeon guillemots.

<HEADLINE> NASCAR Faces Change in Leadership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- NASCAR president Bill France Jr. is  
hanging the Gone Fishin' sign on his office door. The guy who is 
replacing him has a feeling France still will be pretty easy to 
find. 
</P>
<P>
	France passed control of NASCAR to Mike Helton on Wednesday,  
marking the first time since his family founded the racing circuit 
in 1947 that an outsider will run day-to-day operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Helton, the vice president of competition, becomes senior vice  
president and chief operating officer, but he knows France will be 
right across the hall. 
</P>
<P>
	At least most of the time.  
</P>
<P>
	``It depends on how the fish are biting,'' France said. ``But  
I'm still president of NASCAR. What we've announced today is that 
Mike is taking over a lot of the day-to-day operations. He was 
already doing a lot of that to begin with, and we're just making it 
formal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	France said Helton will have final say in almost every decision  
that comes out of NASCAR, ``and in most cases, he'll be leading 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Helton said the move did not foreshadow a big change in the  
way NASCAR operates. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most important thing that everyone should understand is  
that there's nothing broken in the system,'' Helton said. ``There's 
not necessarily a need for change in direction as much as there is 
for continual management of NASCAR as it goes forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The front-office move is the first of several that are expected  
to help NASCAR manage its growth. 
</P>
<P>
	When the changes are complete, it will leave quite a different  
scene than when France's late father, Bill France Sr., founded the 
circuit in 1947. He ran the operation until 1972, then passed 
control over to his son. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was kind of a similar situation than what we're talking  
about with Mike,'' France said. ``Only in those days, NASCAR was 
far more limited than what we have today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, France Jr.'s son, Brian France, is expected to take  
over. 
</P>
<P>
	Until then, the leader will be Helton, 45, who got into racing  
in 1980 as public relations director at Atlanta International 
Raceway. Since starting work for the France family, he has served 
as director of promotions at Daytona and general manager and 
president at Talladega Superspeedway. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mike has been in the saddle, he's got total credibility and  
respect out there in the garage area,'' France said. ``When you 
start talking to race teams out there, that's going to be your 
ultimate answer and I'm totally confident in how that's going to 
work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Drivers and owners quickly confirmed that opinion.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's got the experience, the knowledge,'' owner Richard  
Childress said. ``He can sit down with any major corporation and 
deal with the car owners and teams. He's got a good relationship 
with everyone in the garage area.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seven-time Winston Cup champion Dale Earnhardt agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a good move,'' he said. ``The business has grown  
so big, it's hard for any one man to cover it all. But I don't 
think that there's a decision that goes on that Mr. France isn't in 
on. I'm sure he's not going anywhere any time soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earnhardt said Helton earned his respect in his four years  
dealing directly with the competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got great rapport with people in the garage area and he's  
learned a lot from Mr. France about making logical decisions,'' 
Earnhardt said. ''He's a fair man.''

<HEADLINE> Jury Picked in Dragging Death Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JASPER, Texas (AP) -- A jury was selected Wednesday for a  
suspected white supremacist who could face the death penalty in the 
dragging death of a black man. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not an all-white jury,'' said District Attorney Guy  
James Gray, who said he was barred by the judge from further 
comment. None of the jurors was in the courtroom Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Jasper is nearly half black, the racial makeup of the  
county -- from where potential jurors were drawn -- is only 18 
percent black. Just seven people in the 50-member pool were black, 
creating the possibility that John King, 24, would get an all-white 
jury in the June death of James Byrd Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	King and two other white men are accused of killing Byrd, 49, by  
chaining him to a pickup truck and dragging him nearly three miles. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors have painted King as the ringleader. The other  
suspects, Shawn Berry, 23, and Lawrence Brewer, 31, will be tried 
later.

<HEADLINE>  Bodies of Albanian Victims Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Serb authorities today released all  
40 bodies of ethnic Albanians whose killings 3 1/2 weeks ago 
galvanized international pressure for the Kosovo peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Four trucks carrying the bodies left Pristina for the southern  
village of Racak escorted by peace verifiers from the Organization 
for Security and Cooperation in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethnic Albanians in Racak, where the killings occurred, said  
they planned to keep the bodies in the village mosque for burial 
Thursday or Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The discovery Jan. 16 of what international peace verifiers call  
a massacre by Serb police brought new threats of NATO airstrikes 
and intensified diplomacy that led to the peace talks in 
Rambouillet, France. 
</P>
<P>
	The bodies had remained unburied because of a struggle between  
Serbs trying to avoid the spectacle of a highly publicized mass 
funeral and ethnic Albanian politicians seeking to draw attention 
to what they say was a Serb atrocity. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigating magistrate Danica Marinkovic had refused to  
release the bodies until they had been formally identified in 
accordance with Serb law. Some family members were afraid to come 
to claim bodies for fear of police harassment. 
</P>
<P>
	On Feb. 3, Markinovic allowed 29 of the bodies to be transported  
to Stimlje, the main town adjacent to Racak. But she insisted that 
family members claim the bodies individually at the local police 
station. 
</P>
<P>
	Relatives refused, citing fears of the police and pressing their  
demand for all bodies to be released at the same time. Markinovic 
rejected a request by a local imam, or Muslim preacher, to claim 
the 29 bodies on behalf of the families. The remains were returned 
to the morgue in Pristina, Kosovo's capital 25 miles north of 
Racak. 
</P>
<P>
	Marinkovic then offered to release the bodies in groups over  
several days, apparently to avoid a mass funeral while peace talks 
were under way in France. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Jorgen Grunnet, spokesman for the Organization for  
Security and Cooperation in Europe, said Marinkovic agreed late 
Tuesday to release all the bodies simultaneously if family members 
made the necessary identifications. 
</P>
<P>
	Early today, about 20 male relatives gathered outside the  
Pristina morgue. They were let inside in groups of two to make the 
identifications and sign the necessary papers. 
</P>
<P>
	Standing in the snow outside the morgue, relatives of the  
victims accused authorities of adding to their suffering by 
delaying the release. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is something unseen before. There is no reason for them  
to maltreat families this way. The bodies belong to the families by 
law,'' said Tadeja Rodici, a lawyer for the relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	``They will be buried together or not at all,'' said Faik  
Ramadani, who came to pick up the bodies of his three sons.

<HEADLINE> German Union Hopes To Avoid Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Despite the collapse of contract  
talks, leaders of Germany's giant IG Metall union said Wednesday 
there was still time to avert a full-scale strike that threatens to 
shut down the auto and metalworking industries. 
</P>
<P>
	The union, Germany's biggest with 3.4 million metal and  
electrical workers nationwide, set a deadline of midnight Wednesday 
for a contract agreement. Talks ended Tuesday with no deal and the 
employers' side canceled sessions planned for Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	IG Metall chief Klaus Zwickel accused industry negotiators of  
trying to drive his union into a strike by canceling talks. But he 
also noted that there was still time to reach a deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd be a bad union chairman if I said, 'The negotiations have  
failed, now there's only a labor battle left,'' he was quoted as 
telling the Rheinische Merkur newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Union leaders planned to meet Sunday and could call then for a  
strike vote. If passed, a strike could begin March 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Employers have been offering pay increases of 2.3 percent, plus  
an additional 0.5 percent for companies that can afford it, while 
the union has stuck by its demand for 6.5 percent raises. 
</P>
<P>
	Employers say meeting union demands would kill jobs at a time of  
slowing economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
	The union says that after years of modest wage increases,  
workers should receive a greater share of the increased profits 
reported by many German companies last year. It also charges 
industry has not followed through on promises to create 
significantly more jobs in exchange for wage restraint. 
</P>
<P>
	IG Metall continued to press its wage demands with warning  
strikes. On Wednesday, the union said about 100,000 workers had 
staged short walkouts throughout Germany, including at Audi, MAN 
and Siemens plants. 
</P>
<P>
	The last nationwide strike in then-West Germany's metal  
industries was in 1984, when six weeks of walkouts virtually shut 
down the nation's auto industry.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Crop Freeze Labeled Disaster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRESNO, Calif. (AP) -- President Clinton has issued a major  
disaster declaration for six California counties hit hardest by a 
crippling and costly citrus freeze. 
</P>
<P>
	The declaration issued Tuesday clears the way for special  
unemployment benefits for farmers and farmworkers devastated by the 
four-day freeze in December that caused an estimated $656 million 
in damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmworker advocates say the benefits will not be enough to meet  
the basic needs of the pickers and packers left jobless. 
</P>
<P>
	``We appreciate everything the president did, but it's not going  
to cut it,'' said Victor Lopes, mayor of Orange Cove, a Sierra 
foothill community of 8,000 that serves as a virtual labor camp for 
the citrus industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The declaration can be amended by the Federal Emergency  
Management Administration, leaving the door open for additional 
types of aid. 
</P>
<P>
	The declaration was announced by Vice President Al Gore in a  
conference call with Gov. Gray Davis. Gore has delivered most of 
federal largesse since the disaster struck voter-rich California, a 
state crucial to his presidential drive.

<HEADLINE> Boy Scout Quits Over Clinton Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. (AP) -- A 46-year member of the Boy Scouts  
of America has resigned after the organization's leaders refused to 
ask President Clinton to return the group's most distinguished 
award. 
</P>
<P>
	Garry Brewer, national representative for the organization's  
Western Colorado Council, on Tuesday insisted Clinton should return 
the Silver Buffalo award because of his relationship with former 
White House intern Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bill Clinton doesn't deserve this award ... he's tarnished the  
badge,'' said Brewer, a former Republican Party chairman in Mesa 
County. 
</P>
<P>
	Brewer said the award recognizes a recipient's character, but  
Scout spokesman Gregg Shields said it is an award for service to 
youth that has been given to most presidents. 
</P>
<P>
	``Character is not mentioned in the award,'' he said. ``The Boy  
Scouts is and always has been steadfastly non-political.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Scouts awarded Clinton the Silver Buffalo in July 1997  
during a jamboree. Clinton's involvement with Ms. Lewinsky surfaced 
six months later.

<HEADLINE> Youngsters Shine in Pairs Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The post-Olympic year usually is a time  
for change in figure skating. Nowhere is that change more 
pronounced at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships than in pairs. 
</P>
<P>
	A set of siblings and a familiar face in a new skating  
arrangement took the top two places in the pairs short program 
Wednesday night. Danielle and Steve Hartsell, the 1997 world junior 
champions, skated with verve to edge Kyoko Ina and John Zimmerman. 
Standing third was another relatively unknown couple, Laura Handy 
and J. Paul Binnebose. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everyone knew going into this year that it was a wide  
open field,'' Binnebose said. ``Whoever went out and did the 
cleanest programs had a shot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Hartsells, who were national junior winners in 1995 and  
placed third in seniors a year ago -- only two American couples went 
to the Olympics -- had the strongest short program, worth one-third 
of the overall score. Skating to ``Piano Et Voix Rythmique,'' they 
were first with six of the nine judges, showing power in their lift 
and their throw triple salchow and precision in their side-by-side 
triple toe loops. 
</P>
<P>
	The duo from the Detroit Skating Club isn't thinking about the  
U.S. crown quite yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our main objective here is to get on the world team,'' said  
Steve, who at 21 is three years older than his sister. ``If we end 
up winning the long program (Friday night), that would make it 
sweeter, but we are still here to try to make the world team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The top three qualify for the world championships at Helsinki  
next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Ina has been to four worlds -- with former partner Jason Dungjen.  
She and Dungjen, who split last spring, won the last two U.S. 
titles and were fourth at the Nagano Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	She joined with Zimmerman, another pairs veteran who has never  
been on the U.S. medals podium, for this season. They already have 
qualified for the Grand Prix finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nationals is another stepping stone toward the ultimate goal,  
which is the Olympics,'' Ina said. ``So whatever happens is great. 
Every performance is a learning experience for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They learned in the short program that even when you hit  
something big -- side by side triple toes -- it isn't always enough. 
Their spins were off and she barely landed the throw triple 
salchow. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the first year and we are still growing as a team,''  
Zimmerman said. ``We have a little bit of the jitters, still.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Hartsells should be over that. They've been skating together  
for nearly a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just try to separate skating and our life as brother and  
sister,'' Danielle said. ``We are really good friends and we 
actually hang out a lot. 
</P>
<P>
	``But when we are on the ice, we are kind of like business  
partners. We've got a job to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also doing their job well were Naomi Lang and Peter Tchernyshev,  
who added a win in the original dance to their victory in 
compulsories. They lead runners-up Eve Chalom and Mathew Gates 
heading into Friday's free dance, worth 50 percent of the score. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's our new OD and we skated that really well, we thought,''  
Lang said. 
</P>
<P>
	Later today, the men's short program is on the schedule. The  
women's short is scheduled for the evening.

<HEADLINE>  Helton To Run NASCAR Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- NASCAR president Bill France today  
turned over control of the racing circuit's daily operations to 
Mike Helton. 
</P>
<P>
	The move marks the first time France or his late father, Bill  
France Sr., hasn't been in charge of NASCAR since the circuit was 
formed 51 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	France will remain NASCAR's president, while Helton will be  
senior vice president and chief operating officer. France, 66, said 
he is not departing the NASCAR scene, only taking a diminished 
role. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can read the tea leaves as well as I can,'' he said during  
a news conference. ``That's the best answer I can give you right 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	France said Helton had been moving into the role as NASCAR's  
day-to-day manager the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just making it formal,'' France said.  
</P>
<P>
	Helton said the move should not suggest that major changes will  
follow. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no new agenda that needs to be accomplished, other  
than managing growth of NASCAR the way it is going today,'' Helton 
said. 
</P>

	Helton entered racing in 1980 as public relations director at  
Atlanta International Raceway. He came to Daytona and began working 
for the France family in 1986 as director of promotions and market

<HEADLINE> Rap Foe's Defamation Suit Dismissed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A judge has dismissed a defamation lawsuit  
filed by a rap music critic against two news magazines for their 
reports on her earlier lawsuit against the estate of slain rapper 
Tupac Shakur. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Ronald Buckwalter threw out C. DeLores  
Tucker's lawsuit against Time, Newsweek, writers for those 
publications, and Shakur estate lawyer Richard Fischbein. 
</P>
<P>
	Buckwalter ruled that Mrs. Tucker, a former Pennsylvania  
secretary of state, was a public figure in the eyes of the law. 
That means she had to prove that Time and Newsweek wrote the 
stories with ``actual malice,'' knew they were inaccurate and would 
``embarrass and humiliate'' her and her husband, William. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tuckers did not meet that burden of proof, Buckwalter ruled.  
</P>
<P>
	``There is a vast difference between being annoyed and/or  
embarrassed on the one hand, and being disgraced and ridiculed to 
the extent that one's reputation is harmed in the estimation of the 
community, on the other,'' the judge wrote in a ruling issued 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tuckers' $10 million lawsuit against Shakur's estate said  
the rapper's lyrics, in which he rhymed Mrs. Tucker's name with an 
obscenity, caused emotional distress that led to ``a loss of 
consortium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A subsequent article in Time referred to ``claims that lewd  
remarks made about her ... caused her so much distress that she and 
her husband have not been able to have sex.'' A Newsweek article 
referred to claims that the lyrics ``iced their sex life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tucker said the ``consortium'' complaint had nothing to do  
with sex. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tuckers' lawsuits are still pending against dozens of news  
outlets, including The Associated Press, that carried stories on 
the initial lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Buckwalter last month threw out the lawsuit against Shakur's  
estate, ruling that the references to Mrs. Tucker on Shakur's ``All 
Eyes on Me'' album were ``unpleasant at best and vulgar at worst'' 
but not libelous. 
</P>
<P>
	Shakur was shot to death in Las Vegas in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Impeachment Lawyers Get Poor Rating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate is deliberating in the impeachment  
trial, but one verdict already is in: The lawyering wasn't always 
topnotch. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors should have called presidential secretary  
Betty Currie to testify, and independent counsel Kenneth Starr 
shouldn't have helped prosecutors arrange to meet Monica Lewinsky 
before her sworn questioning, legal observers say. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton's defense team won more praise than criticism  
from legal experts -- but some say it all makes little difference 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lawyering hasn't mattered at all,'' said University of  
Southern California law professor Erwin Chemerinsky. ``If the 
lawyers hadn't uttered a word, the votes in the House and Senate 
would have been the same.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were some high-water marks in terms of legal advocacy.  
White House counsel Charles Ruff, former Sen. Dale Bumpers and 
House prosecutor Asa Hutchinson were praised for their clear, 
well-argued Senate presentations. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hutchinson's opening argument also contained what some  
lawyers consider one of the trial's biggest blunders. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson said presidential friend Vernon Jordan intensified  
efforts to find Ms. Lewinsky a job after a judge's ruling on Dec. 
11, 1997, increased the likelihood she would have to testify in 
Paula Jones' sex-harassment lawsuit against Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Ruff showed that Jordan's job-seeking efforts on Ms.  
Lewinsky's behalf occurred hours before, not after, the judge's 
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson got his revenge a few days later, pointing out that  
Ruff erred in saying Mrs. Currie was never a prospective witness in 
the Jones case. Actually, Mrs. Currie was added to the Jones 
witness list shortly after Clinton questioned her on whether he was 
ever alone with Ms. Lewinsky. Ruff immediately apologized for his 
error. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson's mistake seemed worse because he failed to  
acknowledge it, said New York lawyer Bruce Yannett. Instead, 
Hutchinson came up with a new explanation for what caused Jordan to 
intensify the job search. 
</P>
<P>
	Bumpers' speech to the Senate in Clinton's defense was a high  
point in the trial because he ``was the only one who could get away 
with basically talking to these people as peers,'' said Charles 
Geyh, director of the American Judicature Society's center for 
judicial independence. 
</P>
<P>
	Some low-water marks, according to legal observers:  
</P>
<P>
	--House prosecutors' decision not to call Mrs. Currie as a  
witness. If she were pressed on whether she contacted Ms. Lewinsky 
to pick up gifts Clinton had given her, ``that really could have 
caused things to unravel,'' said Georgetown law professor Louis 
Michael Seidman. 
</P>
<P>
	--Starr's intervention in the trial, by getting a court order  
that required Ms. Lewinsky to meet with prosecutors before the 
Senate decided whether to call her as a witness. There also were 
news reports during the trial that Starr had concluded Clinton 
could be charged with a crime while in office. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Senate's decision to start the trial without working out  
the procedures in advance. Geyh, an Indiana University law 
professor, recommends senators reconsider the procedures later, 
adding, ``They could make it less of a free-for-all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York lawyer Gerald Lefcourt said the best presentation by  
the 13 House prosecutors came near the end, when they were able to 
illustrate their case with the videotaped sworn statements by Ms. 
Lewinsky, Jordan and Clinton aide Sidney Blumenthal. But it was too 
late to make a difference, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Seidman, of Georgetown, believes the House prosecutors blundered  
``in thinking they were still trial attorneys.'' They should have 
brought in other lawyers to help present their case instead of 
giving their own long and unfocused speeches to the Senate, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Philadelphia lawyer Lawrence Fox said the prosecutors did  
well, considering they were hamstrung by being allowed to call only 
three witnesses, presented on videotape instead of live. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's team was ``brilliant'' to use a diverse group of  
lawyers -- including two women, one of them black -- in contrast to 
the 13 white men representing the House, Fox said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have known for a very long time that they didn't have  
anything to worry about'' as long as they made no major mistakes, 
Fox said.

<HEADLINE> Ray Allen Gets $70.9M Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- He got game. Ray Allen's got smarts, too.  
</P>
<P>
	Allen, who starred alongside Denzel Washington last year in  
Spike Lee's ``He Got Game,'' signed a six-year, $70.9 million 
contract extension with the Milwaukee Bucks on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The pact is nearly identical to those recently autographed by  
fellow rising stars Kobe Bryant, Allen Iverson, Shareef Abdur-Rahim 
and Antoine Walker. 
</P>
<P>
	The big difference?  
</P>
<P>
	Allen won't have to fork over a 4 percent commission -- or a cool  
$2,836,000 -- to an agent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't need somebody skimming millions off the top,'' said  
Allen, who chose instead to pay a team of lawyers, a business 
manager and an accountant at an hourly rate of up to $500. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen negotiated directly with team owner Herb Kohl, the senior  
senator from Wisconsin, because the NBA's new labor accord sets 
limits on what players can earn based on years of service. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen said Kohl agreed to pay him the maximum salary allowed a  
third-year player by the new collective bargaining agreement: $9 
million to start, with annual raises of 12.5 percent. He signed the 
six-year, $70.9 million deal Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	That made Allen the highest-paid player in team history,  
surpassing the $68.25 million contract that Glenn Robinson received 
as the top pick in the 1994 NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen is not only wealthy, he's wise, said Bucks coach George  
Karl. 
</P>
<P>
	Karl contends that agents are superfluous now for rookies, who  
have a salary scale, and stars such as Allen. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's got to be a movement maybe from agent to business  
advisor to marketing advisor to merchandiser to accountant,'' Karl 
said. ``I just think Ray should be complimented. If he's not the 
first, he's the first I know of who has done this big a deal 
pushing aside the pressures of hiring a big-name agent. And I think 
he's done it with a lot of class and style. I think he's shown a 
lot of people that you may not need agents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Horsey, Allen's accountant, said his client is at the  
forefront of a movement that could have a huge impact on the 
league. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him that he's going to set the trend and people are  
going to seek his advice on how this was done,'' Horsey said. 
``Basically it was a team approach. You have a business, you have 
accountants and lawyers that provide you with advice. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the pioneer. He's the one that set the stage,'' Horsey  
said. ``I told him he has to be ready to deal with requests, 
inquiries about this situation from other players. It's important 
that he be there for others.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allen said he's already been queried about his no-agent approach  
by Minnesota's Sam Mitchell, ``and he said it was real smart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's only smart for me and any other guy who might be in my  
situation who's going to negotiate a new deal with their team to 
maybe think about having a lawyer do it or even yourself,'' Allen 
said. ``Whatever a lawyer might charge on an hourly rate is not 
nearly as much as an agent might get off his percentage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His mother said Allen, who was represented by Lee Fentress of  
Advantage International when he entered the league in 1996, isn't 
anti-agent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing against agents, but it's not what's best for Ray,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeremiah DeBerry, Allen's lawyer, said agents anymore are  
necessary only for ``middle of the road guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``For the rookies and for the high profile guys who are going to  
get the maximum, certainly this is the way to go,'' DeBerry said. 
``It just makes sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And it saves millions.

<HEADLINE> Senator Questions Starr's Tactics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr came under  
increased criticism Wednesday as a Democratic senator questioned 
his conduct of the Monica Lewinsky investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department also has advised Starr it intends to  
investigate the actions of Starr's office, including the Jan. 16, 
1998 offer to Ms. Lewinsky of an immunity deal conditioned on her 
not discussing it with her lawyer, Frank Carter. 
</P>
<P>
	Another possible area of inquiry: Starr's failure to inform the  
department that he and others on his staff had contact with lawyers 
working on Paula Jones' sexual harassment suit against President 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats have suggested a possible conflict and  
misrepresentation when Starr's prosecutors told the Justice 
Department they hadn't had any contact with Mrs. Jones' lawyers. 
Those comments by Starr's prosecutors are memorialized in notes 
taken by participants at a meeting in January 1998 at the Justice 
Department, when Attorney General Janet Reno was trying to decide 
whether Starr's office should handle the Lewinsky investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've heard a lot about the rule of law recently'' in the  
impeachment trial, said Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin. ``How does'' 
the rule of law ``apply to Ken Starr and the Office of Independent 
Counsel? Honesty and truthfulness and the rule of law also applies 
to those who are cloaked with the authority and the responsibility 
of enforcing those laws.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One area that may be of concern to the Justice Department is the  
contact between Paul Rosenzweig, who is a member of Starr's office, 
and Philadelphia lawyer Jerome Marcus, who assisted Mrs. Jones' 
legal team. 
</P>
<P>
	Four days before Linda Tripp's first contact with Starr's office  
on Jan. 12, 1998, Marcus spoke with Rosenzweig about the Lewinsky 
allegations, a contact that Starr confirmed in his testimony Nov. 
19 to the House Judiciary Committee. Starr said his office did not 
act on it that he did not believe the information on Jan. 8, 1998 
included any mention of Linda Tripp's name. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, The New York Times has reported that there were  
several conversations between Marcus and Rosenzweig from November 
1997 to January 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	There also are questions about the contact between Starr law  
partner Richard Porter and New York book agent Lucianne Goldberg. 
</P>
<P>
	When Mrs. Tripp was looking for a new attorney, Goldberg called  
Porter on Mrs. Tripp's behalf. The question is whether, through his 
contact with Goldberg, Porter ended up representing anyone, 
including Mrs. Tripp, involved in the case who went to the 
prosecutor's office. Depending on precisely what Porter did, Starr 
could have been barred from taking on the Lewinsky probe because of 
a conflict-of-interest provision in the law governing appointment 
of independent counsels.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft's Contracts Eyed at Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Microsoft's defense at its trial is turning  
its attention this week to controversial agreements it made with 
other companies to distribute its Internet browser software. 
</P>
<P>
	The government was expected today to continue questioning  
Cameron Myhrvold, a Microsoft vice president who negotiated many of 
those contracts. Lawyers on Tuesday finished questioning William 
Poole, who arranged similar deals. 
</P>
<P>
	The government alleges Microsoft's contracts violated antitrust  
laws because they illegally discouraged other companies from 
distributing rival Internet software from Netscape Communications 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Some companies, for example, couldn't distribute Netscape's  
browser to more than 15 percent of their customers without 
violating their Microsoft agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft also said it will release today new written testimony  
from its next witness, Brad Chase, another vice president who was 
largely responsible for an important March 1996 agreement with 
America Online, the world's largest Internet provider with more 
than 15 million subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
	Chase, who will take the stand later this week, was expected to  
rebut testimony from an America Online executive, David Colburn. He 
testified previously that AOL was unhappy after its agreement with 
limits that Microsoft imposed on AOL's distribution of Netscape's 
software to its subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department lawyer David Boies sought Tuesday to  
challenge Myhrvold about the exclusive deals Microsoft made with 
America Online and other Internet providers, but Myhrvold said he'd 
have to wait to talk with Chase, the company's next witness. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't negotiate with America Online. I wasn't part of those  
discussions,'' Myhrvold testified. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft didn't emerge entirely unscathed Tuesday. The  
government raised questions about a second video demonstration it 
showed the judge, a sensitive issue for the company after its 
embarrassment last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft acknowledged that two laptop computers used in a  
side-by-side Internet comparison were equipped with modems working 
at different speeds. 
</P>
<P>
	But the company said the impact on its test was negligible  
because one modem was working less than 3 percent faster than the 
other and because most of its demonstration took place offline. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft calculated that the difference accounted for 22  
seconds out of its 13-minute demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is just another red herring for the government,'' company  
spokesman Mark Murray said. ``It just shows how threadbare their 
case is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Microsoft suffered a debacle over questions about  
another of its demonstrations after acknowledging it had edited 
together video segments of several different computers so it 
appeared a single computer was being tested. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge called that admission ``very troubling'' but allowed  
Microsoft to recreate its demonstration overnight with government 
lawyers watching. U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson 
didn't comment on the company's latest video problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Boies raised the issue without much fanfare Tuesday on an  
otherwise unremarkable day of testimony while questioning Myhrvold. 
</P>
<P>
	In the video, Microsoft sought to demonstrate how newer versions  
of its computer operating system allow consumers to open an online 
account and begin using the Internet more quickly because the 
technology is built into Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	The procedure took about five minutes using Windows 98 but  
almost three times as long using the company's much older Windows 
3.1. 
</P>
<P>
	But Boies pressed Myhrvold on whether both computers used modems  
working at the same speed, which could influence results. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft said afterward that Windows 98 actually connected to  
its so-called Internet Referral Server at 33,600 bits per second -- 
the server's top speed -- while the older Windows connected at 
28,800 bits per second.

<HEADLINE> Dartmouth To End Single-Sex Frats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HANOVER, N.H. (AP) -- Dartmouth College, the school that inspired  
``Animal House,'' plans to put an end to single-sex fraternities 
and sororities to foster more ``respectful relations'' between the 
sexes. 
</P>
<P>
	Dartmouth students were in an uproar Wednesday over the plan.  
</P>
<P>
	``This was like a bomb,'' said Misha Rosoff, 23, rush chairman  
at Sigma Alpha Epsilon. ``Everyone sort of assumed that the 
trustees would try to get rid of the Greek system, but this came 
with no warning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the Ivy League school refused to say whether the  
plan means requiring fraternities and sororities to go coed or 
phasing them out altogether, but college President James Wright 
said it will be the biggest change in social life at Dartmouth 
since women were admitted in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	The move, announced in a letter to students Tuesday, is aimed at  
encouraging ``respectful relations between women and men.'' College 
administrators said they are concerned about problem drinking and 
the social fragmentation that sometimes accompanies the Greek 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	The college did not say specifically when the changes would be  
put into effect. 
</P>
<P>
	The details are to be worked out in consultation with students  
and backed with tens of millions of dollars for construction of new 
housing, dining and social areas to replace the Greek houses. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, the Greek system ``as we know it today will not  
continue,'' Wright said in an interview Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dartmouth, founded in 1769, has had fraternities for more than  
158 years, and they are a major part of the school's image and the 
social life in Hanover, a snowy town of about 7,000 people 135 
miles from Boston. According to the student paper, The Dartmouth, 
more than 35 percent of the 4,300 undergraduates are members of 25 
single-sex fraternities and sororities. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Greek system is a very huge thing up here,'' said Brad  
Bingham, 22, a member of Alpha Delta. ``If there was a city or a 
bigger town with more things to do, maybe it wouldn't be so 
important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A group of students gathered outside Wright's home to protest  
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Greek officers also met Wednesday night and decided to cancel  
all 21 events and parties planned for the weekend. They want to 
show administrators that there's nothing to do at Dartmouth without 
Greek activities, said College Fraternity Sorority Council member 
Jamie Paul. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Miller, a member of Alpha Delta when he was a Dartmouth  
student, co-wrote ``Animal House,'' the 1978 comedy about 
frat-house debauchery. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time they plant a tree or modify the curriculum they  
constantly have student meetings and discussions,'' complained 
Catherine Curran, 19, a sophomore and sorority member from Las 
Vegas. ``For something this drastic, they should have gotten 
student input.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The national organizations of some fraternities and sororities  
do not permit coed membership, and that could prove a hurdle. 
</P>
<P>
	The 120,000 living members of Sigma Alpha Epsilon would have to  
vote to change the fraternity's bylaws to admit women, and ``the 
chances of that are slim to none,'' said Ben Lewis, a spokesman in 
Evanston, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know of no modern-day fraternity or sorority who has allowed  
anyone in of another gender,'' Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Something that could become a model for Dartmouth occurred at  
Middlebury College in Vermont in 1991, Middlebury spokesman Phil 
Benoit said. 
</P>
<P>
	The trustees there ``basically said to the Greek system houses,  
`It's all right to remain here, but you must open membership to 
both genders,''' he said. He said nearly all complied, though they 
changed names and affiliations.

<HEADLINE> Ice Fishermen Rescued From Floe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARRISON TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) -- A dozen anglers who ignored  
warnings to stay off weakening ice were rescued by a helicopter and 
a Hovercraft after becoming stranded on Lake St. Clair. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of about 50 fishermen were trapped Tuesday on an ice  
floe that carried them 1 1/2 miles off the Harrison Township shore, 
about 25 miles northeast of Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the anglers were able to reach shore by crossing an ice  
bridge at Metropolitan Beach. No injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
	It was sunny and about 50 degrees at the time of the rescue. The  
U.S. Coast Guard had issued repeated warnings to stay off the ice 
after several days of warmer-than-usual temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
	On Dec. 29, 18 fishermen were rescued from a 500-foot ice floe  
in the same area. That rescue cost taxpayers an estimated $50,000 
to $70,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Annoyed by the increasing cost of such rescues, two legislators  
said they plan to introduce laws that would punish anglers who 
ignore warnings about unsafe ice. 
</P>
<P>
	State Sen. David Jaye said Tuesday he planned to introduce  
legislation allowing one free rescue for anyone involved in an ice 
fishing incident that was deemed reckless. 
</P>
<P>
	A second incident would bring a $500 fine and a third rescue  
would end in a $1,000 fine and the loss of winter fishing 
privileges for five years. 
</P>
<P>
	State Rep. William Callahan is proposing legislation that would  
create a trust fund to reimburse local communities for rescue 
costs. The fund would be sustained by a fee added to fishing, 
boating and hunting licenses. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also would fine anglers who disregard notices about  
unsafe ice.

	``Live at Cibolo Creek Country Club'' (Misery Loves Co.) -- Ray  
Wylie Hubbard 

</P>
<P>
	Ray Wylie Hubbard is as interesting a singer-songwriter as there  
is working today. His songs of drinkers, drifters, gamblers and 
criminals strike a spot deep within the heart, where they resonate 
long after the last note has faded from the ear. But besides 
singing minor-chord tales of loneliness and awakening, Hubbard also 
sounds like he's having a lot of fun. 
</P>
<P>
	``Live at Cibolo Creek Country Club'' is a nice mix of both --  
the gentle silliness of Hubbard's stories and the deep 
introspection of his writing. Fans who have seen him live will 
recognize most of the stories -- and songs -- on ``Cibolo Creek,'' 
but the chance to hear Hubbard perform his country-folk tunes with 
a crack band (Stephen Bruton and Lloyd Maines, among others) should 
draw them to this excellent disc anyhow. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the songs, it's nice to hear Hubbard sing the tune that  
has hounded him since he wrote it 25 or so years ago -- ``Up Against 
the Wall Redneck Mother,'' which he has long resisted performing. 
But newer songs, ``There Are Some Days'' and ``Loco Gringo's 
Lament'' in particular, show just how far 
</P>
<P>
 las come from his country-outlaw days.
</P>
<P>
	Right now, ``Cibolo Creek'' is a record in search of a record  
deal. In the meantime, it can be ordered through www.raywylie.com.

<P>
	``Noels Celtique'' (Green Linnet) -- L'Ensemble Choral du Bout du  
Monde 

</P>
<P>
	Sure, the holidays are gone. That should not stop you from  
picking up this sublimely beautiful album of choral music from 
France. Anyhow, unless you speak Breton, the Celtic dialect of 
Brittany, you might not even realize these are Christmas songs. And 
unless you are familiar with such Breton Christmas songs as ``Pa 
voe ganet'' you won't already be tired of any of these selections -- 
there is no ``Little Drummer Boy'' here. 
</P>
<P>
	The ensemble draws its 100-plus members from villages across  
Brittany, and backs up their beautiful voices with Renaissance and 
medieval instruments. The net result is an album of quiet beauty, 
the kind of music that will warm your soul on a winter's day.

	GOP Opposes Censure Vote  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With President Clinton's acquittal assured,  
Democrats continued their campaign for a formal vote to censure him 
after the trial. But Republican opposition seemed to be stiffening, 
and Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said censure would violate the 
constitutional doctrine of separation of powers. Three Republican 
senators declared today they would vote to acquit on both articles 
of impeachment, the clearest sign yet that the vote to convict him 
would fall far short of the needed two-thirds majority. Democratic 
leader Tom Daschle is hoping for at least a procedural vote before 
lawmakers adjourn, a roll call that would allow Democrats to go on 
record condemning the president's behavior.

	CHESAPEAKE, Va. (AP) -- Christian Coalition founder Pat Robertson  
has reassumed the presidency of the political organization after 
spending several years as a senior adviser, a spokeswoman said. 
Robertson angered some conservative leaders, including 
just-departed president Don Hodel, when he said last month that 
President Clinton had won the public relations battle and the 
Senate should end the impeachment trial. The coalition is in the 
midst of efforts to defend its own past political activities. The 
FEC has sued the coalition, accusing it of illegally spending 
thousands of dollars to promote Republican candidates.

	Grounded Oregon Ship Set Afire

	COOS BAY, Ore. (AP) -- With the blast of grenades and a plume of  
black smoke, Navy demolition experts set fire to a grounded cargo 
ship tonight in a race to beat a storm that threatened to break it 
up and cause a disastrous oil spill. Setting the New Carissa ablaze 
in the breakers was a desperation move to spare Oregon beaches from 
the heavy, tarlike bunker fuel remaining inside the 639-foot ship. 
Already, cracks in the hull of the ship have leaked oil over miles 
of coastline. The ship, owned by a Japanese company and registered 
in Panama, ran aground last Thursday 150 yards offshore.

	DALLAS (AP) -- A federal judge ordered American Airlines pilots  
to end their sickout and go back to work tomorrow, warning them 
they could be held in contempt of court if they don't. The pilots 
began calling in sick Saturday after talks broke down with the 
company about the salaries paid pilots of Reno Air, which AMR, 
American's parent, recently acquired. The dispute has forced the 
carrier to cancel 2,500 flights and stranded an estimated 200,000 
travelers.

	No Breakthrough in Colombia Talks

agreed to keep working towards a political solution, an envoy said. 
Victor Ricardo said discussions between himself and the National 
Liberation Army, Colombia's second largest guerrilla group, focused 
on establishing direct dialogue, ``humanizing'' the conflict and 
possible formal peace talks. The two sides agreed to meet again in 
Caracas in the next few days to try to advance the talks.

Deliberations were to resume tomorrow. The case is considered a

double-figure scoring from five players to beat the Washington 
Wizards 101-88 tonight and gain their first victory of the season. 
It came without the assistance of Latrell Sprewell, who will be out 
3-6 weeks with a stress fracture of his right heel. Larry Johnson 
scored 18 points, Patrick Ewing and Charlie Ward added 16 apiece 
and Chris Childs came off the bench for 13 points, nine assists and 
eight rebounds.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Barely Changed; Dow Down 4.12 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock indexes were barely changed in late  
afternoon, as strength in the shares of large technology companies 
failed to lift the rest of the market. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 4.12 at 9,128.91, after swinging narrowly between positive and 
negative all morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow would have been even lower had it not been for IBM,  
which was up 2 3/8 at 165 1/8, accounting for more than 9 points to the 
positive side on the Dow. 
</P>
<P>
	Broad indexes dipped lower, with the Nasdaq composite down 1.11  
at 2,309.68, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index down 4.08 at 
1,220.22. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders and analysts have become increasingly worried that the  
only strength in the market right now is in technology. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rallies are incredibly narrow; the sell-offs are broad,''  
said Larry Rice, chief investment officer at Josephthal &AMP; Co., 
``and you're not going to get a sustained move to the upside 
without the participation of the entire market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Internet stocks continued to drop on disappointment that Lycos  
didn't get a premium in its three-way deal with USA Networks Inc. 
and TicketMaster Online Citysearch Inc. Lycos' shares were down 7 1/8 
at 87 1/8, pulling other Internet shares with it. 
</P>
<P>
	But unlike Tuesday, when computer shares were sold  
indiscriminantly, the shares of big computer companies were mixed 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	In Nasdaq trading, Dell Computer was up 1 1/16 at 98 7/8 after  
recovering from early losses, Cisco Systems was up 1 11/16 at 97 5/8, 
and Microsoft was up 1/16 at 160 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's been some real carnage, especially in the Internet  
world, and who knows where that stops,'' said Arthur Hogan, head 
trader at Jefferies &AMP; Co. in Boston. ``But people are realizing 
that even when you sell your Lycos and your Yahoo!, you don't sell 
your Microsoft, you don't sell your Intel, you don't sell your IBM. 
And so we're seeing some real bargain hunting'' in big technology 
shares. 
</P>
<P>
	A big loser among the Dow industrials was Philip Morris, down 4 1/4  
at 41 1/8. A jury awarded $1.5 million to a California woman who sued 
Philip Morris for negligence, liability and fraud tied to her 
smoking-related cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by about 7 to 4 on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 572.46 million 
shares, up from Tuesday's pace.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Mixed; Dow Up 44.28 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Last-minute bargain hunting Wednesday lifted the  
Dow Jones industrial average higher just before the closing bell, 
but the broad market ended mixed, and small stocks lost ground. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow gained 44.28 points to 9,177.31 after edging narrowly  
between positive and negative territory all day. The gain in the 
blue chips followed a 148-point loss on Tuesday that was also led 
by computer shares. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM accounted for more than half of the Dow's gain, rising 6 1/8 to  
close at 168 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite ended 1.29 lower at 2,309.50 after a  
94-point loss on Tuesday, failing to benefit from strength in 
computer shares despite its heavy weighting in that sector. The 
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index rose 7.41 to 1,223.55. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index, which is made up of smaller companies,  
dropped 5.17 to 397.96. That got the attention of traders and 
analysts, who have become increasingly worried that the only 
strength in the market right now is in technology stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rallies are incredibly narrow; the sell-offs are broad,''  
said Larry Rice, chief investment officer at Josephthal &AMP; Co., 
``You're not going to get a sustained move to the upside without 
the participation of the entire market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues led advancers by 3 to 2 on the New York Stock  
Exchange. Volume was anemic compared to recent days with 864 
million shares having changed hands, down from Tuesday's level. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of the Internet search and directory company Lycos fell  
for a second day amid continued disappointment in the price that 
its shareholders will receive as the company is merged with USA 
Networks Inc.'s Home Shopping Network. 
</P>
<P>
	Some investors had hoped that, with the red-hot market for  
Internet stocks, Lycos should have commanded a higher price. Lycos' 
shares lost 7 to 87 1/4 and pulled other Internet shares with it. 
</P>
<P>
	But unlike Tuesday, when tech shares were sold indiscriminantly,  
the shares of several big technology companies were higher. Intel 
gained 3 1/2 to 128 13/16 
</P>
<P>
	``There's been some real carnage, especially in the Internet  
world, and who knows where that stops?'' said Arthur Hogan, market 
analyst at Jefferies &AMP; Co. in Boston. ``But people are realizing

</P>
<P>
	Dow member Philip Morris fell 3 15/16 to 41 7/16. A jury awarded  
$1.5 million to a California woman who sued Philip Morris for 
negligence, liability and fraud tied to her smoking-related cancer, 
in the first tobacco liability case to come to trial after the 
state removed a ban on such suits. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Pluto Is Again Most Distant Planet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tiny Pluto slips outside the orbit of Neptune  
today to resume its role as the farthest planet from the sun. 
</P>
<P>
	This return to normal comes just days after the littlest planet  
survived an attack that threatened to strip it of its planetary 
status altogether. 
</P>
<P>
	Normally the most distant planet, Pluto has an unusual orbit  
that takes 248 Earth-years to complete one trip around the sun. 
During just 20 of those years, it moves inside Neptune's orbit to 
become the eighth planet instead of the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	Pluto moved inside Neptune's orbit on Feb. 7, 1979, and was on  
course to cross back outside at 5:08 a.m. EST today, scientists at 
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration calculated. 
</P>
<P>
	Pluto will remain the most distant planet for the next 228  
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Just last week, the Paris-based International Astronomical  
Union, the world's leading astronomical organization, reaffirmed 
Pluto's standing as the smallest planet. 
</P>
<P>
	News reports had said Pluto might be demoted to a minor planet,  
or -- worse -- a trans-Neptunian object. 
</P>
<P>
	``No proposal to change the status of Pluto as the ninth planet  
in the solar system has been made by any division, commission or 
working group of the IAU responsible for solar system science,'' 
said the 80-year-old organization, the final authority on 
astronomical matters. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though Pluto was crossing Neptune's orbit, there was no  
worry about a collision, NASA said, because the planets were going 
to be far apart at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Pluto was discovered Feb. 18, 1930, by Clyde Tombaugh at Lowell  
Observatory in Flagstaff, Ariz. Its moon, Charon, was found in 
1979. 
</P>
<P>
	With a diameter of 1,430 miles, Pluto is less than half the size  
of any other planet and only two-thirds as big as Earth's moon.

<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Eliot Corday, a doctor who helped develop  
modern cardiac care and the cardiologist for William Randolph 
Hearst and Gen. Omar Bradley, died Monday. He was 85. 
</P>
<P>
	Corday helped Nobel laureate Dickenson Richards develop the  
Masters 2-step test, which was the forerunner to modern stress 
testing. He also collaborated with Dr. George Griffin to study the 
flow of radio-labeled sodium through the cardiac chambers, research 
that was the basis for development of modern nuclear cardiology. 
</P>
<P>
	Corday served as a cardiology consultant to the U.S. Air Force's  
surgeon general from 1967 to 1977. He served as chief of cardiology 
at Cedars of Lebanon in Los Angeles for 11 years before the 
hospital merged with what is now Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.

</P>
<P>
	Grooms was assigned to design the Gopher mascot while he was  
working for the Collegiate Manufacturing Co. in Ames, Iowa, in the 
1940s. His grandson wrote in the Minnesota Alumni Association 
magazine in July 1995 that Grooms was a little worried about the 
assignment because he didn't know what a gopher looked like. He 
ended up drawing a chipmunk. 
</P>

<P>
	SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -- Col. Robert S. Scott, a Medal of Honor  
winner who killed 28 Japanese soldiers during a fierce battle in 
World War II, died Friday. He was 85. 
</P>
<P>
	He received the medal for ``conspicuous gallantry'' in the  
Solomon Islands. On July 29, 1943, Scott, an Army lieutenant, held 
his ground when the Japanese launched a fierce counterattack during 
fighting near Munda Airstrip at New Georgia in the Solomon Islands. 
</P>
<P>
	With only a tree stump for cover, Scott stalled the enemy  
advance with carbine fire and grenades. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott continued to fight even after his carbine had been shot  
from his hands and he had suffered wounds to his left hand and 
head. He used grenades to beat the enemy back, killing 28 Japanese 
soldiers in the process. 
</P>
<P>
	After World War II, he left the Army but re-enlisted in 1947 and  
served until 1966 when he retired with the rank of colonel.

<HEADLINE>  Marines Accused of Flying Too Fast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A Marine jet that sliced through an  
Italian ski gondola cable, killing 20 people, violated the 
mission's speed limit during almost all of the flight, a witness 
testified Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Warrant Officer Jeffrey Poncelet said his analysis of  
tapes from the EA-6B Prowler flown by Capt. Richard Ashby showed 
that 89 percent of the flight was faster than the speed limit of 
517 mph. The jet was going more than 575 mph for 58 percent of the 
flight, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors have said the radar-jamming jet struck the ski  
gondola cable at 621 mph. Poncelet's testimony supported their 
claim that Ashby should have known he was flying too fast and 
violating an altitude restriction of 1,000 feet. The cable was hit 
at about 360 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby, 31, of Mission Viejo, Calif., is being court-martialed on  
20 counts of involuntary manslaughter, and other offenses. He could 
get more than 200 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, two witnesses testified that the radar altimeter  
on the jet malfunctioned on two earlier flights but was fixed. 
</P>
<P>
	Maintenance officer Lt. Col. Gary Eugene Slyman said that when  
Ashby pilot signed out the EA-6B Prowler on Feb. 3, 1998, the jet 
had a missing screw and an erratic air-conditioner, but nothing 
serious enough to ground it. 
</P>
<P>
	``This airplane was a solid player for us,'' Slyman said. ``This  
plane had flown the most sorties and most hours of any airplane we 
had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Slyman said that when he flew the plane on an earlier mission,  
the altimeter alarm -- which is supposed to go off when the plane 
dips below a preset altitude -- sounded at 25,000 feet instead of at 
the lower elevation it was set for. He said he reset the alarm and 
it corrected itself. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Scott Roys testified the radar altimeter stuck when he was  
in the same jet another time, but he and the pilot fixed it. 
</P>
<P>
	After the jet hit the cable, Ashby filed a complaint about the  
radar altimeter, Slyman said. Slyman didn't elaborate on the nature 
of the problem Ashby cited. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys also contend the ski area in the Alps wasn't  
on Ashby's map. 
</P>
<P>
	The Prowler's navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, 31, of  
Westbury, N.Y., is awaiting trial next month.

<HEADLINE> Texas Man Executed for 1979 Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- A convict known as Spiderman because he  
once slipped through jail bars and escaped was executed by 
injection Wednesday night for the fatal beating of a man during a 
carjacking. 
</P>
<P>
	George Cordova already had a long criminal record when he was  
arrested for the 1979 murder of Jose Hernandez, 19, in San Antonio. 
Hernandez's girlfriend was beaten and gang-raped during the attack, 
but survived and testified against Cordova. 
</P>
<P>
	Cordova, 39, apologized to Hernandez's family in a rambling,  
nine-minute final statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I could die a hundred times to bring him back I would do  
it,'' he said. ``I hope you all can take this bad experience and 
turn it into something positive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He continued: ``If I see your brother I'm going to hug him. ...  
If he will allow me to be his servant, I'll tie his shoes. I'll do 
anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cordova, whose first arrest came at age 11 for tormenting a  
police dog, escaped from jail while awaiting trial for the 
Hernandez murder in 1980. He slipped through a gap in the bars and 
climbed out of a fourth-floor window by using a rope made of 
sheets. 
</P>
<P>
	Five months later, he was arrested in Florida and later  
sentenced to 30 years for raping a teacher. The day before his rape 
trial, he was caught trying to saw his way out of jail.

<HEADLINE>  Papillon Wins at Westminster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The smallest dog proved the biggest and best of  
them all as a dainty papillon floated to victory Tuesday as 
best-in-show at the Westminster Kennel Club's 123rd annual show. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-pound dog -- who came within a whisker of the prize in 1996  
-- lived up to his own name, Loteki's Supernatural Being, and his 
breed's name, French for butterfly, as he flew around the ring with 
handler-owner John Oulton. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the 31st best-in-show for Kirby, at 8 years old a veteran  
of the show ring. He also collected top prize this summer at the 
World Championship in Helsinki. 
</P>
<P>
	``Helsinki was incredible, of course, there were 16,000 dogs,''  
Oulton said. ``But I think this is really, for me, the top, top 
award.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Edd Embry Bivin praised all seven finalists, chosen Monday  
and earlier Tuesday to represent their breed groups, but said Kirby 
stood head and batlike ears above the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	``They put together a pack that was really something to see,''  
he said. ``This little dog was so on for this night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kirby came in second to a clumber spaniel in 1996, then didn't  
even win his breed the following year. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, unlike most Westminster winners, he won't retire to the  
home he shares with Oulton and 10 other pets in Norwalk, Conn., 
though Oulton already limits him to a few shows a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could never retire this dog because he loves to show so  
much,'' he said. ``He may make two or three appearances a year just 
to let him have the fun of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kirby was chosen from among 2,500 dogs representing 152 breeds.  
Westminster is essentially a beauty contest: The dogs are judged 
solely on how they meet the American Kennel Club standards for 
their breed. 
</P>
<P>
	Other group winners chosen Monday and Tuesday were:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Non-sporting: Lake Cove That's My Boy, a standard poodle who  
also won the group last year, owned by longtime Westminster 
exhibitor Mrs. Alan Robson of Glenmoore, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Terrier: Sunspryte's Just In Thyme, a Welsh terrier owned by  
comedian Bill Cosby with Jean Heath and Beth Bates of Pleasanton, 
Calif. Another Cosby-Heath dog, the Lakeland terrier Revelry's 
Awesome Blossom, was fourth in the group. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Working: Mentmore's Windy Meadow, a 3-year-old Bernese  
mountain dog owned by Cheryl Paterson of London, Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Sporting: Bit O Gold Titan Treasure, who also won the group in  
1997 and 1998. The Gordon setter is is owned by Susan Lubrand, 
Barry Rose, Judy Brown and Peggy Nowak of Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Hound: Sundown Alabster Treasure, a graceful saluki owned by  
James D. Black of San Andreas, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Herding: Windwalker's Yes Virginia, a German shepherd who beat  
the old English sheepdog that won the group last year. The 
4-year-old dog belongs to Jamie Walker and Joe Greer of 
Albuquerque, N.M.

<HEADLINE> Fierce Winter Storm Hits Northwest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- More than 8 feet of snow dumped on the Sierra  
Nevada in just four days closed Interstate 80 and triggered 
voluntary evacuations at parts of Lake Tahoe amid fear of 
avalanches. 
</P>
<P>
	Several major roads were shut down Tuesday because of spinouts  
and near-blizzard conditions. Hundreds of state workers were sent 
home early in Reno, Carson City and other cities. 
</P>
<P>
	In parts of Washoe County, sheriff's deputies went door-to-door  
late Tuesday urging dozens of residents to leave their homes until 
later today. An avalanche warning was in effect today along Lake 
Tahoe's north shore. 
</P>
<P>
	An avalanche closed the Mount Rose Highway southwest of Reno,  
burying the road under 8 feet of snow but causing no injuries. Over 
the weekend, one man was killed and three friends barely escaped 
after being buried for more than four hours in an avalanche near 
Donner Pass. 
</P>
<P>
	Snow was falling early today from Montana to the Wasatch  
Mountains of Utah. Some of the snowfall in Utah was heavy, 
prompting several winter storm warnings across the state. Skies 
over Nevada were clearing today. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescuers planned search again today for two missing men who  
failed to return from a weekend outing in Washington's Cascade 
Range. The search near Snoqualmie Pass was halted before nightfall 
due to the high avalanche danger, King County sheriff's deputy John 
Urquhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Interstate 80 was closed for several hours Tuesday from the  
Nevada-California state line west to Applegate, Calif., about 30 
miles northeast of Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's terrible,'' Sara Olson said at the J&AMP;L Food Mart in  
nearby Truckee, Calif. ``I'm getting very sick of this. If I have 
to pick up another shovel, someone's going to get hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pounding rain also plagued Northern California. In San  
Francisco, gusty winds up to 60 mph uprooted trees and collapsed a 
three-story scaffold onto six parked cars. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Weather Service late Tuesday lifted flood watches  
issued for the Russian River in Sonoma County and flood warnings 
for the upper Napa River and Petaluma River. 
</P>

<HEADLINE>  Papillon Wins at Westminster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The smallest dog proved the biggest and best of  
them all as a dainty papillon floated to victory Tuesday as 
best-in-show at the Westminster Kennel Club's 123rd annual show. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-pound dog -- who came within a whisker of the prize in 1996  
-- lived up to his own name, Loteki's Supernatural Being, and his 
breed's name, French for butterfly, as he flew around the ring with 
handler-owner John Oulton. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the 31st best-in-show for Kirby, at 8 years old a veteran  
of the show ring. He also collected top prize this summer at the 
World Championship in Helsinki. 
</P>
<P>
	``Helsinki was incredible, of course, there were 16,000 dogs,''  
Oulton said. ``But I think this is really, for me, the top, top 
award.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Edd Embry Bivin praised all seven finalists, chosen Monday  
and earlier Tuesday to represent their breed groups, but said Kirby 
stood head and batlike ears above the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	``They put together a pack that was really something to see,''  
he said. ``This little dog was so on for this night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kirby came in second to a clumber spaniel in 1996, then didn't  
even win his breed the following year. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, unlike most Westminster winners, he won't retire to the  
home he shares with Oulton and 10 other pets in Norwalk, Conn., 
though Oulton already limits him to a few shows a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could never retire this dog because he loves to show so  
much,'' he said. ``He may make two or three appearances a year just 
to let him have the fun of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kirby was chosen from among 2,500 dogs representing 152 breeds.  
Westminster is essentially a beauty contest: The dogs are judged 
solely on how they meet the American Kennel Club standards for 
their breed. 
</P>
<P>
	Other group winners chosen Monday and Tuesday were:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Non-sporting: Lake Cove That's My Boy, a standard poodle who  
also won the group last year, owned by longtime Westminster 
exhibitor Mrs. Alan Robson of Glenmoore, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Terrier: Sunspryte's Just In Thyme, a Welsh terrier owned by  
comedian Bill Cosby with Jean Heath and Beth Bates of Pleasanton, 
Calif. Another Cosby-Heath dog, the Lakeland terrier Revelry's 
Awesome Blossom, was fourth in the group. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Working: Mentmore's Windy Meadow, a 3-year-old Bernese  
mountain dog owned by Cheryl Paterson of London, Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Sporting: Bit O Gold Titan Treasure, who also won the group in  
1997 and 1998. The Gordon setter is is owned by Susan Lubrand, 
Barry Rose, Judy Brown and Peggy Nowak of Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Hound: Sundown Alabster Treasure, a graceful saluki owned by  
James D. Black of San Andreas, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Herding: Windwalker's Yes Virginia, a German shepherd who beat  
the old English sheepdog that won the group last year. The 
4-year-old dog belongs to Jamie Walker and Joe Greer of 
Albuquerque, N.M.

<HEADLINE> House Managers Blame Public Opinion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Resigned to losing their case, the House  
prosecutors say public opinion won out over their case that 
President Clinton committed high crimes and misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Baffled'' by polls that showed Americans consistently opposed  
Clinton's removal no matter what evidence the prosecution team 
presented, lead manager Rep. Henry Hyde said he had held out hope 
for a sea change. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did feel that if we could get the story out in a coherent  
fashion, the public might be informed and a change in the public's 
mind would reach the senators,'' Hyde said in an interview 
Wednesday as the Senate moved through its second day of closed 
deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's essential, for impeachment to prevail, to have bipartisan  
support. We never had it,'' the House Judiciary Committee chairman 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. agreed: ``The public opinion polls  
have been the hurdle for us. That is tough, to remove a popular 
president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In more than three weeks of arguments before 100 silent  
senators, the managers insisted that Clinton committed perjury 
before a grand jury and obstructed justice in his efforts to cover 
up his affair with Monica Lewinsky. And they argued strongly that 
the offenses met the constitutional standards for conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	But in poll after poll, constituents of the senator-jurors  
overwhelmingly opposed Clinton's removal. Surveys indicated that 
two-thirds of Americans took this stance as the trial wound down. 
</P>
<P>
	As the 67 votes needed for Clinton's removal moved farther out  
of reach, the president's approval rating hovered consistently 
above 60 percent. Approval for the Republicans' handling of the 
case never topped 40 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	And though impeachment duty endeared the prosecutors to  
conservatives, evidence began to mount that some of them were 
suffering back home. 
</P>
<P>
	A Chicago Tribune poll suggested that three months after Hyde  
won easy re-election to his Illinois House seat, one-third of the 
voters in his conservative district said they had a lower opinion 
of him as a result of impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Jim Rogan, R-Calif., faced a difficult re-election even  
before he was appointed to the impeachment team. Though he outspent 
his Democratic opponent 2-1, Rogan was elected to his second House 
term last year with only 50.2 percent of the vote. Clinton won 
Rogan's Pasadena-area district by 49 percent in 1996, compared with 
41 percent for Republican nominee Bob Dole. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Steve Chabot of Ohio is in a similar situation, embarking  
on the impeachment trial after he overcame a tight race to win 
re-election with 53 percent of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservatives predict voters will consider impeachment old news  
by the time the next Election Day rolls around. The managers point 
out that they only did the job the Constitution required after the 
House approved impeachment articles. And Hyde framed the question 
of political fallout when he told the Senate that ``upholding the 
rule of law'' was worth losing one's congressional seat. 
</P>
<P>
	Several managers lamented the Senate's restrictive trial rules.  
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly the procedures that we adopted in a bipartisan fashion  
were difficult,'' said sophomore Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., whose 
Fayetteville-area district has sent Republicans to Congress in 
every election since 1966. Clinton won the district by 1 percentage 
point in 1992 and then lost it by 1 percentage point in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Charles Canady of Florida no longer worries about  
re-election because he has limited himself to eight years in the 
House, a period that expires next year. 
</P>
<P>
	He said of the trial, ``The basic facts of the case were the  
same'' as they were when Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr 
delivered his report to Congress last September. 
</P>
<P>
	With defeat imminent, the prosecutors returned to the House this  
week visibly relieved to be considering such normal legislative 
matters as federal spending and trade. 
</P>
<P>
	A few, such as Canady, went upstairs to the Rules Committee on  
Wednesday, where Chairman David Drier was holding an ice cream 
social. Even sweeter, said some of the managers, were the hearty 
backslaps and words of support they got from Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone understands that this was a tough job,'' Rogan said.

<HEADLINE> American Airlines Seeks Court Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- American Airlines asked a federal judge today to  
order its pilots to stop calling in sick in a dispute that forced 
the carrier to cancel 900 more flights today. 
</P>
<P>
	AMR Corp., the airline's parent company, asked U.S. District  
Judge Joe Kendall for a temporary restraining order and asked that 
the pilots be held in contempt of court if they continued to call 
in sick. 
</P>
<P>
	Airline attorney Dee Kelly also asked for damages, saying that  
the airline is losing money every day the ``sick out'' continues. 
``They're threatening to bring the airline to a complete halt,'' 
Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate reaction from the pilots' union.  
</P>
<P>
	The latest strife between American and its pilots -- which has  
resulted in travel delays for more than 200,000 passengers -- has 
now grounded about than 2,500 flights since Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Talks stalled last Friday in a dispute over when pilots from the  
recently acquired Reno Air would be upgraded to the pay scale 
received by American's pilots. The next day, many American pilots 
began calling in sick and refusing to fly voluntary overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of cancellations has escalated each day, with more  
than 800, or about 37 percent, of the airline's flights knocked off 
Tuesday's schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations have begun anew and were scheduled to continue  
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the purchase of Reno is the source of this dispute, ill  
will between the pilots and the company has been festering for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early 1990s in an attempt to stem losses, American  
Airlines closed three hubs and furloughed 610 pilots, while at the 
same time leasing its empty airport gates to Reno Air and Midway 
Airlines Inc. and selling frequent-flier miles on the smaller 
carriers. 
</P>
<P>
	American pilots saw the move as a way to shift work to their  
lower-paid counterparts at the smaller airlines. The distrust was 
highlighted by jokes among crew members that AMR stood for 
``American, Midway, Reno.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that this is a confrontation that has its roots in  
things that have happened in the past, and I think that (AMR 
chairman and chief executive Don) Carty seriously underestimated 
the residual anger that was there with the pilot group,'' said 
Holly Hegeman, an airline analyst for PlaneBusiness. 
</P>
<P>
	The bitterness between management and the pilots has complicated  
their relations for years. ``The level of distrust boggles my 
mind,'' said James Higgins, an analyst with Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; 
Jenrette. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, when contract negotiations faltered, American  
pilots staged a brief strike. 
</P>
<P>
	Last summer, more than 450 flights were canceled as pilots  
refused to work overtime to protest a passenger-sharing deal with 
Canadian Airlines Corp. And more than 1,000 flights were canceled 
during a dispute in 1990 in which American sought a court 
injunction against the pilots, whom the airline accused of staging 
an illegal sick-out. That dispute resulted in a public apology 
advertisement in the nation's newspapers which misidentified 
American's pilot union. 
</P>
<P>
	The recent turmoil hasn't helped to heal the rift. The Allied  
Pilots Association says AMR is moving too slowly in integrating the 
Reno pilots into their work force. The union wants pay raises for 
all pilots who will move into higher-paying jobs, retroactive to 
the company's purchase date of Dec. 23. 
</P>
<P>
	AMR said that it will take about 12 to 18 months to move pilots  
into their new positions and that the union's plan would cost as 
much as $50 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Carty, who took the reins of the company last year, said the  
``dysfunctional'' relationship between management and pilots is not 
one that he is proud of. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do regret that we don't have a better relationship with the  
Allied Pilots Association. I don't know the answer. ... We're going 
to keep plugging at it,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> IOC Promises To Continue Crackdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- With 20 percent of its members implicated in the  
Salt Lake scandal, the International Olympic Committee promised 
Wednesday to consider expelling more of them to restore its damaged 
credibility and assuage big-money sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will act decisively,'' said Anita DeFrantz, an IOC vice  
president from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC leaders read the 300-page report issued Tuesday by a Salt  
Lake ethics panel, a document detailing more than $1 million in 
cash payments and other favors lavished on IOC members during the 
city's winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The report linked an additional 10 IOC members to the scandal,  
bringing to 24 -- a fifth of the total membership -- the number of 
Olympic delegates accused of accepting excessive benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC said the ethics report was being forwarded to its own  
six-man panel investigating the Salt Lake case. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision-making IOC executive board expects to receive ``the  
earliest possible recommendations'' from the panel, the IOC said in 
a statement from Lausanne, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	``The IOC remains fully committed to investigating and taking  
action based on all available evidence,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the IOC panel identified 14 members involved in  
alleged excesses stemming from Salt Lake's bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine of those members have either resigned or been expelled by  
the IOC executive board. Three others -- including powerful 
executive board member Kim Un-yong of South Korea -- remain under 
investigation, one received a warning and one has died. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC noted that last month's expulsions were ``based on  
evidence available at the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Further expulsions are now likely before the special IOC  
assembly in Lausanne, March 17-18. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you find something that's a real breach, we basically have  
only one sanction, and that's expulsion,'' said IOC vice president 
Dick Pound, head of the internal inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC executive board delegate Jacques Rogge, a member of Pound's  
panel, said the commission will likely meet soon to review the 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogge said he was not surprised that more members were  
implicated. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew more names would come up,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Rogge said a key issue for the IOC panel will be to determine  
whether members were guilty of actual ethical violations. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to differentiate between what is a breach of the  
line, and what is so-called `lavish treatment,''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch has also written to all  
cities which bid for the Olympics of 1996 through 2004, asking for 
any documented evidence of misconduct. The deadline for responses 
is Feb. 15, meaning even more members could be implicated before 
the March meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC marketing director Michael Payne, on a trip to the United  
States to meet with Olympic sponsors, said the IOC is doing 
everything in its power to stamp out corruption and institute 
reform. 
</P>
<P>
	``Has the IOC been damaged?'' Payne said. ``Yes, clearly it has.  
On the other hand, it's the opportunity to clean house and to 
reform. You have to take two or three steps backwards to move one 
step forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the head of Olympics sponsor John Hancock insurance  
criticized the IOC's handling of the crisis and suggested that 
Samaranch's tenure may be running out. 
</P>
<P>
	But Payne rejected the continuing calls from outside the IOC for  
Samaranch to resign, saying the 78-year-old president is needed to 
lead the house-cleaning efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the president stepped down, you would have a presidential  
election with all the instability that would bring,'' Payne said. 
``That's the last thing you want at this stage. You need a firm 
hand at the top to drive through the changes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Payne played down the decision by John Hancock, one of the IOC's  
international corporate sponsors, to cancel negotiations with NBC 
for $20 million in ads. 
</P>
<P>
	``They aren't withdrawing from their sponsorship,'' he said.  
``This issue is related to a media purchase, which is separate from 
the sponsorship. Several Olympic sponsors don't advertise at all on 
the broadcast. There's no obligation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite John Hancock's move, Payne said there was no crack in  
support from the Olympic sponsors who pay tens of millions of 
dollars to help finance the games. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sponsors are standing, first of all, behind the games,  
and, second, behind the steps and action the IOC, Samaranch and the 
executive board are taking,'' Payne said. 
</P>
<P>
	Payne spoke by telephone from New York, where he will meet this  
week with Olympic sponsors. He also is to travel to Australia later 
this month to meet with sponsors of the 2000 Sydney Games. 
</P>
<P>
	A key test for IOC leaders is how they handle the case of Kim,  
the South Korean executive board member and highest-ranking 
official implicated in the Salt Lake scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim is one of three members -- along with Russia's Vitaly Smirnov  
and Ivory Coast's Louis Guirandou-N'Diaye -- still under 
investigation by Pound's panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim was further implicated in the Salt Lake report. It found  
that the bid committee paid $45,000 toward the salary of his son, 
John, to work at Keystone Communications, a satellite 
communications company based in Salt Lake. Keystone's former chief 
executive said the bid committee paid all of the costs of John 
Kim's employment -- $75,000 to $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim claimed the report had exonerated him and his son.  
</P>
<P>
	``Any secret deal between the bid committee and Keystone was a  
contrivance solely between those two entities, and was wholly 
unknown to either Dr. Kim or to his son,'' Kim's lawyer, Howard 
Graff, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics report also said Kim sought bid committee help in  
getting a visa and admission aid for a Russian student at the 
University of Utah. The committee spent $15,000 on the student, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim, 67, has been considered a leading contender to succeed  
Samaranch, whose term expires in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	``Such persistent attempts to smear both my reputation and the  
leadership of president Samaranch are political and designed to 
undermine the stability of his leadership, as well as to affect the 
succession of his presidency,'' Kim said. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the time comes, I will fight back,'' he said. ``I have a  
lot of ammunition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kim said he did not expect his opponents to try to expel him.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's too risky for them,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	In other developments:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Australia's Phil Coles, one of the 10 new IOC members  
implicated in the Salt Lake case, stepped down from the Sydney 
Olympic organizing committee board, pending an IOC inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	The Salt Lake report said Coles and Guatemala's Willi  
Kaltschmitt made four visits together, with their families, to the 
United States -- including a trip to the Super Bowl in Miami, hosted 
by Salt Lake City bid director Tom Welch, at a cost of $19,991. 
</P>
<P>
	``Phil categorically denies that he visited Salt Lake City four  
times during Salt Lake City's candidature,'' Coles' lawyer, Simon 
Rofe, said. ``It is regrettable that the board of ethics chose to 
make this serious allegation of unethical conduct without first 
putting it to Phil in order that he could respond and set the 
record straight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Barbados IOC member Austin Sealy, who was implicated in the  
Salt Lake report, denied any wrongdoing. Bid records showed $3,000 
a month passed through a company affiliated with a consultant to 
Sealy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have never been solicited for my vote, never been offered  
any payment, never been offered any inducement,'' he said. ``The 
bottom line is that I know nothing about any payments. I'm 
completely in the dark about this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- The Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter reported that Stockholm's  
unsuccessful bid for the 2004 Olympics paid for the medical care of 
IOC members or their relatives on five occasions. The newspaper 
said each of the payments amounted to more than the $150 limit for 
gifts. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that Olympic chief  
Billy Payne suggested a college tennis scholarship, medical 
treatment and free plane tickets as gifts for IOC members in a memo 
written before the city won the 1996 Games, but immediately 
dismissed the idea. 
</P>
<P>
	-- In Salt Lake City, Olympics organizers scrambled to smooth the  
way for Mitt Romney to be chosen Thursday as the chief of a 
committee badly bruised by scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston venture capitalist, who is the choice of Gov. Mike  
Leavitt and Salt Lake Organizing Committee chairman Robert Garff, 
met Wednesday with SLOC board members who will be asked to hire him 
as the new chief executive officer of the group staging the 2002 
Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the sort of franchise player that can restore the  
integrity to an institution that has gone awry,'' said Bill Hybl, 
president of the U.S. Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Leavitt, responding to allegations that the telecommunications  
company U S West dangled a $5 million Olympic contribution for 
favorable treatment, said Wednesday he is abandoning a sweeping 
initiative to deregulate the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Ernst &AMP; Young, the accounting firm criticized by the SLOC  
ethics panel for not flagging undocumented expenditures by Olympic 
bid executives, said the voluminous report issued by the panel left 
out many facts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really disappointing because I thought the ethics  
committee would do a better job than that,'' said Scott Peterson, 
the managing partner of Ernst &AMP; Young's Salt Lake office. 
</P>
<P>
	``No Big 6 firm just blindly accepts management's explanations,  
especially when there's an audit committee and there are lots of 
discussions that occur.''

<HEADLINE> 5 Fla. Child Welfare Workers Fired </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Five child welfare workers have been fired  
for failing to notice that a 6-year-old girl who was allegedly 
beaten to death by her father was being abused. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the employees was the investigator who asked a judge to  
return Kayla McKean to her father's home. 
</P>
<P>
	The firings on Wednesday follow an investigation by the  
Department of Children and Families, which has come under scrutiny 
since Kayla was killed Nov. 25. Two other employees have resigned. 
</P>
<P>
	Child welfare officials have agreed that there was poor  
communication between the department and a private firm contracted 
to provide foster care and services to Kayla's family. 
</P>
<P>
	Department officials have said their investigators and  
supervisors missed repeated signs that the girl was being abused. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks To Expand AmeriCorps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is asking Congress to  
increase support for AmeriCorps so 100,000 youths can volunteer 
their time and energy through the national service program 
annually. New television ads are being developed to try to stoke 
interest in volunteering. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to make an all-out national effort to challenge young  
Americans to serve,'' said Bruce Reed, the president's domestic 
policy adviser. ``If we're going to come together as a country, the 
ethic of service needs to be part of every American's daily life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president's fiscal 2000 budget requests $585 million for  
AmeriCorps, a $113 million increase over last year. The increase 
would raise from 50,000 to 70,000 the number of high school- and 
college-age students who could participate next year, and set the 
program on a course to include 100,000 in the year 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was highlighting the plan during a speech at the  
University of Maryland today. In Maryland, high school students are 
required to perform volunteer work as a condition of graduation. 
Gov. Parris Glendening and Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., were 
attending. 
</P>
<P>
	In advance of the president's appearance, Republican National  
Committee Chairman Jim Nicholson circulated a statement 
spotlighting a plan ``hidden away in Bill Clinton's budget'' to cut 
$4.6 billion from the student loan program. Nicholson called it a 
``stingy, shortsighted proposal'' that would lead to higher student 
fees, slower loan approvals, fewer loan consolidations and higher 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The RNC was sponsoring its own forum today, across the street  
from Clinton's appearance at Maryland's Ritchie Coliseum, to 
discuss Republican beefs with the president's education budget. 
</P>
<P>
	A national service program, akin to a domestic Peace Corps, was  
an early priority of the Clinton administration. Since the program 
was established four years ago, more than 100,000 people have 
participated. 
</P>
<P>
	AmeriCorps has not been popular with congressional Republicans,  
who have attempted several times to kill or severely curtail the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	AmeriCorps volunteer resources to schools, churches and  
nonprofit groups, such as Habitat for Humanity and the American Red 
Cross. 
</P>
<P>
	Also today, AmeriCorps was unveiling an MTV-produced public  
service campaign to encourage young people to get involved and 
provide information on how to enroll.

<HEADLINE> Senators Craft Impeachment Speeches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Casting their vote is one thing. But as  
President Clinton's impeachment trial grinds toward an end, many 
senators are finding that deciding how to explain that vote to 
constituents is going to be an equally difficult task. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm on draft No. 8 right now,'' Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash.,  
said recently, clutching a typewritten speech pockmarked with 
handwritten changes as another trial day ended. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's acquittal, expected Thursday or Friday, has been a  
virtual certainty for some time. Unburdened by indecision over how 
they will vote, most senators have spent recent days planning 
remarks that may get more attention back home than anything they 
have ever said. 
</P>
<P>
	Though most deny that politics will have anything to do with  
their decision, senators' votes -- and the speeches they give 
defending them -- will occur in a superheated political climate. 
</P>
<P>
	After a year of reading about Monica Lewinsky, the former White  
House intern, most Americans have strong opinions about whether 
Clinton should be removed from office. Polls show that about 
two-thirds of them want Clinton to continue as president, though 
Republicans favor his removal by a 60-40 margin. 
</P>
<P>
	That could put two types of lawmakers into the most difficult  
positions when it comes to explaining their impeachment votes: 
Republicans from pro-Clinton states in the North who vote to 
convict; and Democrats from conservative Southern states voting to 
acquit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd look at it a little like votes on abortion. These are very  
emotional, very personal votes,'' said Chriss Winston, who headed 
White House speechwriting for most of President Bush's 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Her advice to senators: ``You have to say, 'I've looked at it,  
I've considered the wishes of my constituents, and in the end I 
have to do what I think is right.' ... They have to try walking 
people through their decision-making process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agreeing with that approach is Daniel Casse, another former Bush  
aide who like Winston continues writing speeches. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've seen senators and representatives of either party who  
speak out as a matter of conscience have gained a certain stature 
in the public's eye'' in the past, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Plenty of senators seem to have already chosen that path.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's important for them to know I began this with an open  
mind,'' said freshman Democratic Sen. John Edwards, referring to 
his constituents in mostly conservative North Carolina. ``I've been 
impartial. And to whomever I make unhappy, I've voted my 
conscience. Most people are responsive to what they view as a 
principled vote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senators began their final deliberations behind closed doors  
Tuesday after voting to abide by Senate rules requiring the last 
stage of the debate to be private. They will be able to publish 
their remarks from the secret session in the Congressional Record. 
</P>
<P>
	But at some point after the trial ends -- on the Senate floor,  
speaking to reporters or in speeches back home -- they will have to 
appear in person to address why they voted as they did. 
</P>
<P>
	Realizing this and with an eye to history as well, senators are  
crafting their remarks with care. Gorton, who announced Tuesday 
that he would vote to convict Clinton on one of the two articles of 
impeachment, was among many who said they had gone through multiple 
drafts of their speeches. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important to do it right, and as precisely as possible,''  
said Gorton. ``Unlike 99 percent of all our debates, people will be 
reading this one 100 years from now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In remarks he delivered to the closed session of the Senate,  
Gorton said, ``I cannot will to my children and grandchildren the 
proposition that a president stands above the law and can 
systematically obstruct justice simply because both his polls and 
the Dow Jones index are high.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Winston said that for the best effect, senators should deliver  
their explanatory speeches on the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
	``The floor of the Senate offers a certain decorum that makes  
whatever they have to say have fewer partisan overtones,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't have to give the speech of their lives,'' she said,  
``but the best advice is speak from the heart, and speak from the 
floor.''

<P>
	ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) -- Navy's football team will face Air Force  
at Jack Kent Cooke Stadium this October, marking the second 
straight season the Midshipmen will be playing at the Landover home 
of the Washington Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
	The game is scheduled for Oct. 9. The Naval Academy also  
announced Wednesday that it will play Air Force at Jack Kent Cooke 
Stadium in 2001 and 2003. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> GOP Plays Down 10 Percent Tax Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A growing number of Republicans, worried that  
a broad 10 percent income tax cut isn't politically possible, are 
working on alternatives that include eliminating the ``marriage 
penalty'' quirk that makes millions of two-income married couples 
pay more than if they were unmarried. 
</P>
<P>
	From conservatives like Rep. Steve Largent of Oklahoma to  
moderates like Rep. Nancy Johnson of Connecticut, Republicans are 
looking for a less expensive tax cut that would have a better 
chance of passing before the 2000 congressional campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to ask yourself: Do you want to attempt something  
that may not be attainable, thereby deflating your supporters?'' 
Largent said. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans are determined to use for tax relief some of the  
projected $2.56 trillion budget surplus over the next decade, 
although most agree with President Clinton that 62 percent of the 
surplus should go to keep Social Security solvent. The fight will 
come over what to do with the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10 percent income tax cut enjoyed a boomlet of support when  
the new Congress convened last month. Now Republicans see several 
drawbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The broad cut is expensive, at an estimated $743 billion over 10  
years, and President Clinton is likely to threaten a veto as 
Democrats pound home their claim that it primarily benefits the 
wealthy. Such a fight could have a major impact on 2000 races, with 
control of the House hanging in the balance. 
</P>
<P>
	Fixing the marriage penalty, in contrast, enjoys broad support  
within the GOP and among many Democrats. House Speaker Dennis 
Hastert, R-Ill., symbolically gave this year's bill the number H.R. 
6 to show it is a top priority. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't sense overwhelming support for a 10 percent reduction  
in rates,'' said Rep. Jerry Weller, R-Ill., a main sponsor of the 
marriage penalty measure. ``The best way is a more targeted 
approach. Taxpayers find targeted tax cuts tangible. They can 
relate to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The marriage penalty strikes an estimated 21 million two-income  
couples, many firmly in the middle class, who pay an average of 
$1,400 more in income taxes than they would if single. 
</P>
<P>
	Bills drafted by Weller and Johnson -- both members of the  
tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee -- would fix this problem 
by giving married couples who file jointly a standard deduction 
equal to twice the $4,250 now available for singles. 
</P>
<P>
	Weller's measure, which already has 223 co-sponsors, would go a  
big step further by extending the 15 percent tax bracket for 
married couples from a maximum of $41,200 now to $49,300, so that 
more of their income would be taxed at a lower rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Had those changes been made for 1998, it would have meant an  
average of $1,400 more for married couples. The Johnson measure 
would cost roughly $28 billion over five years, Weller's more than 
$100 billion in the same period. 
</P>
<P>
	For Republicans, the legislation has the added attraction of  
broad support from key social conservative groups, many of which 
are frustrated by the GOP's inability to enact such priorities as a 
ban on partial-birth abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrea Sheldon, executive director of the Traditional Values  
Coalition, which represents 40,000 churches, said marriage penalty 
relief not only cuts taxes but makes a strong pro-family statement 
instead of discouraging couples from tying the knot. 
</P>
<P>
	``The marriage penalty is morally wrong,'' Sheldon said. ``It's  
our top priority.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To be sure, Republicans are far from giving up on the 10 percent  
income-tax reduction. The chairmen of the two budget committees, 
Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico and Rep. John Kasich of Ohio, are 
likely to include versions in spending blueprints Congress will 
consider this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	But those blueprints aren't binding, and the real heavy lifting  
on tax cuts will occur later in the Ways and Means Committee and in 
the Senate Finance Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation circulated by Johnson and supported by 11 other  
House GOP moderates that includes marriage penalty relief would 
also raise the outside earnings limit for Social Security 
recipients, accelerate full tax deductibility of health insurance 
premiums for self-employed people and enact tax breaks for 
long-term care and affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure is similar in many ways to the five-year, $80  
billion tax relief package passed last fall by the House but never 
taken up by the Senate. This year's version would cost about $100 
billion over five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bill Archer, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, has  
not yet signaled which way he will go. But like most Republicans, 
Archer is committed to significant tax relief. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's any big controversy,'' Archer, R-Texas,  
said. ``We've just got to work through this.''

<HEADLINE> Sciatica Not Helped by Bed Rest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Add sciatica to the sorts of back pain that shouldn't keep you  
in bed. 
</P>
<P>
	A week or two in bed used to be routine treatment for any sort  
of aching back. But over the past 15 years, doctors have learned 
that many types of backaches get better just as fast if people go 
about their normal activities. 
</P>
<P>
	Until now, that hadn't been tested with sciatica, pain from the  
sciatic nerve -- usually just in the buttocks and thigh, but 
sometimes all the way down to the foot. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Patrick C.A.J. Vroomen of Maastricht University Hospital in  
the Netherlands, where two weeks of bed rest is a common treatment 
for sciatica, reported his findings in Thursday's New England 
Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors randomly assigned 183 patients either to bed rest or  
``watchful waiting'' -- getting up and about whenever possible 
without straining the back or provoking pain. 
</P>
<P>
	After two weeks, 70 percent of the 92 patients who got out of  
bed only to bathe or use the toilet felt better. So did 65 percent 
of those who were up and about. Statistically, those are the same. 
</P>
<P>
	After 12 weeks, 87 percent of the patients in each group felt  
better. 
</P>
<P>
	``We found no evidence that bed rest is an effective treatment  
for patients with sciatica,'' Vroomen said.

<HEADLINE> Texas Coach Brown Get $1M Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Texas coach Mack Brown will earn $1 million  
a year under a contract extension approved Wednesday by university 
officials that seeks to keep him with the Longhorns through the 
2008 season. 
</P>
<P>
	The extension approved by the UT System Board of Regents raises  
Brown's total compensation by $250,000 a year. It is retroactive to 
Jan. 1, the day Brown led the Longhorns to a 38-11 win over 
Mississippi State in the Cotton Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown's base salary is $200,000 a year with the rest of the  
money coming from endorsements, radio, television and other media 
commitments, summer camp income and expense allowances, the school 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coach Brown has done an excellent job not only on the field,  
but in projecting an attitude and image of excellence and character 
off the field,'' said Regent Patrick Oxford of Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is at the peak of his profession and these compensation  
actions reflect the market for premier college football coaches,'' 
Oxford said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown's contract is extended four years through Dec. 31, 2008.  
Also approved was an annuity to pay the 47-year-old Brown a net $1 
million when he turns 55 if he is the Texas football coach for at 
least five years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really excited about the confidence the university has  
shown in our program, not only for me but for our whole staff,'' 
Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	Five of Brown's assistants -- coordinators Greg Davis and Carl  
Reese, strength coach Jeff Madden, assistant athletic director for 
football operations Cleve Bryant and tight ends coach Tim Brewster 
-- will receive annuities if they have been at Texas at least five 
years. Each will receive $50,000 per year for five years. 
</P>
<P>
	The university last month approved pay raises for Brown's staff.  
Davis and Reese will each get raises of $35,000, bringing their 
salaries to $150,000. Brown's other assistants also will get raises 
of $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Oxford said the new contract is necessary to keep Brown and his  
staff at Texas. Brown was offered a job with an NFL team, Oxford 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas athletic director DeLoss Dodds wouldn't say what NFL team  
offered Brown a job. 
</P>
<P>
	``That wouldn't really be fair to them or to coach Brown,''  
Dodds said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown said the raises and annuities for his assistants are very  
important. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just about every member was offered an opportunity to go  
elsewhere this year. All of our coaches chose to stay because of 
the commitment by the university to have the best program in the 
county,'' Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	When Texas officials first discussed a new deal for Brown in  
December, Dodds said a contract buyout would cost UT $1 million at 
most because the school would be obligated to pay only the base 
salary over a five-year maximum. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas was 4-7 in 1997 before Brown arrived. After a 1-2 start in  
1998, the Longhorns rebounded to win eight of their last nine, 
including wins over Nebraska and Texas A&AMP;M. Tailback Ricky Williams 
won the Heisman Trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Brown signed a recruiting class that was hailed by  
experts as the nation's best. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to make every effort to assure that our head coach and  
his staff are compensated at a rate that places them among the 
top-ranked programs in the country. I believe that the actions by 
the administration and the board of regents accomplish this goal,'' 
Dodds said.

<HEADLINE> NATO Urged To Clarify Admission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- NATO members should decide at April's 50th  
anniversary summit in Washington on a clear and definite road map 
and timetable for admitting members, former President Carter's 
national security adviser said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Comments at a symposium indicated the most likely candidate for  
membership is Slovenia, followed by Slovakia and Lithuania. Some 
participants suggested the trio could join as early as 2001 or 
2002, provided they meet the same stringent requirements the newest 
members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization have satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington gathering is to welcome as full alliance members  
the former Warsaw Pact nations Poland, the Czech Republic and 
Hungary. Their entry will increase membership to 19 and expand the 
Atlantic alliance eastward toward Russia, to the frontier of the 
former Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
	``Vagueness regarding keeping NATO's door open is tantamount to  
a pause,'' Zbigniew Brzezinski, a key member of Carter's national 
security team, said at the Center for Strategic and International 
Studies seminar. Opponents of further NATO expansion say a pause is 
needed to give the alliance time to adjust to having three new 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration wants the April summit to end with a  
robust and credible package on keeping the alliance open to new 
members. It also wants to avoid a contest among the attending heads 
of state over who should get the next invitation. 
</P>
<P>
	Brzezinki said NATO ministers should agree in April to meet  
before the end of the year or next spring to assess which nations 
are ready to join so invitations can be extended late in 2000. 
Successful candidates could then join within a year or two. 
</P>
<P>
	He referred to a congressional survey released Monday that said  
of the nine central European countries that have applied, Slovenia 
is the most qualified to join NATO, with Slovakia and Lithuania 
just behind. 
</P>
<P>
	At a NATO meeting last week in Munich, Germany, Russia's deputy  
foreign minister, Yevgeny Gusarov, said the alliance must not 
consider farther expansion after the three former Soviet allies are 
inducted this year. He said Russia will not tolerate farther 
eastward expansion. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. William Roth, R-Del., president of the North Atlantic  
Assembly, which comprises lawmakers from member countries, has said 
Slovenia, part of former Yugoslavia, should be invited at the April 
summit to begin negotiations to join NATO. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Defense Secretary William Perry said at the symposium  
that Slovenia already meets NATO membership qualifications but 
Romania, another potential candidate, still needs to work on 
developing democratic institutions and establishing an open-market 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	At NATO's last summit in 1996, France led a strong effort by  
eight nations who favored admitting Slovenia and Romania as part of 
the first wave. The United States rejected the proposal, 
effectively quashing it. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO was established in 1949 to confine the Soviet Union in  
Europe. Its last expansion was in 1980, when Spain became the 16th 
member.

<HEADLINE> Social Security Plan Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The head of a blue-ribbon commission on Social  
Security and Congress' chief auditor agree President Clinton's plan 
to save Social Security leaves a lot to be desired. 
</P>
<P>
	David M. Walker, head of the congressional General Accounting  
Office, called Clinton's proposal ``extremely complex and 
confusing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both he and Edward Gramlich, who headed a 13-member Social  
Security study commission, on Tuesday questioned Clinton's proposal 
to use general tax revenues to meet projected shortfalls between 
Social Security payroll taxes and benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Gramlich, now a member of the Federal Reserve Board, said his  
panel had specifically considered that idea two years ago but 
unanimously rejected it. Since its creation 60 years ago, Social 
Security has relied exclusively on payroll taxes to fund benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are serious drawbacks to relaxing Social Security's  
long-run budget constraint through general revenue transfers,'' 
Gramlich told the Senate Finance Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his commission felt it was a bad idea because it would  
put the needs of retirees in direct competition with other 
government programs and would make it harder for Congress to make 
the tough choices of trimming benefits or raising payroll taxes to 
fix the long-range financing problem. 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, spokesman Barry Toiv said Clinton's plan is  
a two-pronged approach -- shore up Social Security for the coming 
baby-boom drain, then ``make the hard choices to extend the trust 
fund even further'' -- that does not count on an endless stream of 
general revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	Social Security now takes in $100 billion more annually than it  
needs to pay current benefits. But starting in 2013, payroll tax 
collections will not be enough to cover the growing needs of baby 
boomer retirees. 
</P>
<P>
	Gramlich said ``some reduction in benefits are almost certain to  
be necessary as the U.S. population ages.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walker said Clinton's proposal to use general revenue money to  
support future Social Security payments marked a ``major change in 
the underlying theoretical design of this program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said that one ``disconcerting aspect'' of Clinton's proposal  
was that it would establish a claim on general revenue funds even 
if the future surpluses were not realized by stating that the 
amounts to be transferred would be written into law as a percentage 
of taxable payrolls, rather than a percentage of future surpluses 
in any given years. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's plan would devote $2.8 trillion, or 62 percent of $4.5  
trillion in projected budget surpluses over the next 15 years, to 
paying down the national debt as a way of shoring up Social 
Security. 
</P>
<P>
	He would do this through a complicated process that Republican  
critics have charged amounts to double-counting $2.3 trillion of 
the money. Those funds are already earmarked for the Social 
Security trust fund. Clinton would give Social Security a 
government IOU, just as currently, and then take the money and buy 
back Treasury bonds now held by the public. 
</P>
<P>
	For every dollar he reduces the $5.5 trillion national debt in  
this way, he would give Social Security a second IOU. The 
administration argues this will lock in the surplus reduction for 
Social Security by giving the program an additional claim on 
government resources. 
</P>
<P>
	But both IOUs would represent internal bookkeeping claims on the  
government, without actual assets backing them up. When benefit 
demands outstrip current payroll taxes starting in 2013, the 
government will have to face painful choices of cutting benefits, 
raising taxes or borrowing more from the public to make up the 
shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration argues that by paying down the national debt  
now and lowering interest payments, the government will be on a 
sounder footing to meet baby boomer retirement needs. 
</P>
<P>
	But Walker said ``some could view this as double counting.  
Importantly, to the extent it appears that way to the public, it 
could undermine confidence in a system that is already difficult to 
explain.''

<HEADLINE> Developing Nations Urge Caution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTEGO BAY, Jamaica (AP) -- Unbridled capitalism endangers the  
very independence of developing countries by leaving them at the 
mercy of international lending institutions and colossal foreign 
companies, embattled leaders said at a summit Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The fear that hundreds of millions of people in poorer nations  
might be trampled by a few rich global players dominated the 
opening of the ninth summit of developing nations in this lush 
Caribbean island. 
</P>
<P>
	Many leaders of the Group of 15 -- which actually has 17 members  
-- warned that rapid globalization could destroy their economies and 
affect the industrialized world as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pace and direction of globalization, which threaten  
defenseless nations and endanger millions of vulnerable people, 
will have to be curbed,'' warned Jamaica's Prime Minister P.J. 
Patterson, whose country has lost thousands of textile jobs to 
other nations with cheaper wage rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Other member nations might disagree -- like Mexico, which  
benefits from preferred access to the North American market and has 
attracted some of Jamaica's textile jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	While apparently divided over concrete policies, officials here  
appeared united in the frustrating perception that their interests 
are given short shrift by the industrialized world. 
</P>
<P>
	``Paradoxically, the greatest catastrophe for us, who had always  
been anti-communist, is the defeat of communism,'' said Malaysian 
President Mahathir Mohamad. ``The end of the Cold War has deprived 
us of the only leverage we had -- the option to defect. Now we can 
turn to no one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Together, the G-15 nations account for a third of the world's  
population and produce $2 trillion worth of goods -- nearly 40 
percent of the gross domestic product of all developing nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Members include Indonesia, where economic problems brought down  
the government, and Brazil, which is struggling to avert 
hyperinflation and a currency collapse. 
</P>
<P>
	Such problems, delegates argue, should prompt the International  
Monetary Fund, World Bank and other multilateral institutions to 
re-think traditional measures emphasizing austerity in exchange for 
financial aid. 
</P>
<P>
	In a stirring speech that struck a chord with applauding  
officials, Mahathir complained that former Asian ``tigers'' are 
``reduced to whimpering and begging'' for aid from the IMF and are 
being compelled to open their economies to ``super-big'' foreign 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``The temptation to interfere in local politics might be too  
much for the foreign giants to resist,'' he warned. 
</P>
<P>
	Patterson called for the World Trade Organization to move  
against what he termed a ``resurgence of protectionist measures by 
developed countries,'' even while developing nations suffer under 
the freer trade imposed by the industrialized world. 
</P>
<P>
	The results, he said, ``threaten the very economic survival of  
many countries within the developing world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A more optimistic note was struck by Venezuela's new president,  
Hugo Chavez, who predicted social and economic renaissance in 
Venezuela after a long period of ``slumber.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I have utmost faith that the people of Venezuela and Latin  
America are emerging, each in their own way, following a path to 
development and progress,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Only seven heads of states were present -- from Jamaica,  
Malaysia, Nigeria, Senegal, Sri Lanka, Venezuela and Zimbabwe. Vice 
presidents and foreign and finance ministers represented Algeria, 
Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Kenya 
and Peru.

<HEADLINE>  3 GOP Senators Say They'll Acquit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican support for convicting and removing  
President Clinton waned today as senators debated impeachment for a 
second day behind closed doors. Three GOP senators announced they 
would reject both the perjury and obstruction of justice charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will vote to acquit on both articles,'' said Sen. John  
Chafee of Rhode Island, a key moderate Republican. Chafee said 
House prosecutors had not met the burden of proof that Clinton 
committed crimes because their ``circumstantial evidence is 
rebutted by direct evidence or confusion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sens. James Jeffords of Vermont and Arlen Specter of  
Pennsylvania said they, too, would not support allegations of 
perjury and obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Specter, citing the laws of Scotland, said there could be  
``three possible verdicts: guilty, not guilty, not proved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the option in this trial, I suspect many senators would  
choose 'not proved' instead of 'not guilty,''' the Pennsylvania 
Republican said in a statement that he planned to deliver on the 
Senate floor 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffords said Clinton had committed shameful acts but his  
offenses ``do not reach the high standard of impeachment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other senators' decisions announced today were not a surprise.  
Democrat Tom Harkin of Iowa left the chamber to read reporters his 
statement in favor of acquittal. Sen. Dick Lugar, R-Ind., said he 
would vote to convict on both articles. 
</P>
<P>
	Harkin said the House had presented ``a counterfeit case'' based  
on the efforts of ``an out-of-control independent counsel with a 
blank check.'' He predicted that only one-third of the Senate would 
vote for the perjury article. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said that ``if at  
all possible'' he would like to set a vote for 5 p.m. EST Thursday 
on whether to convict Clinton on the perjury and obstruction of 
justice charges -- votes that by all signs will fall far short of 
the two-thirds majority needed to oust the nation's 42nd president. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we still have speeches and we can't do it then we will  
certainly go over to Friday but I think we need to begin to talk 
about that goal,'' Lott said at the opening of today's trial 
session. The Senate sergeant at arms then closed the doors so the 
debate could begin in private for a second day. 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, spokesman Joe Lockhart said the president is  
``open to the idea of censure.'' But Lockhart added, ``I don't 
think it's appropriate for us to indicate or try to prescribe'' 
punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton will probably have something to say after the Senate  
votes, Lockhart said. The White House has been sensitive to 
possible criticism if Clinton appears to gloat over the likely 
acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
	Both inside and outside the chamber today, GOP senators raised  
doubts about support for a censure or rebuke of the president if he 
is acquitted on the two articles of impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's been very little mention of censure,'' Sen. Bill  
Frist, R-Tenn., said before today's proceedings. ``To me, the push 
for censure is losing steam.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Frist indicated that the debate Tuesday was lawyerly on the  
article alleging that Clinton committed perjury before a grand jury 
-- an accusation some Republicans have suggested they may not 
support in the final vote. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Frist's GOP colleagues, Slade Gorton of Washington,  
disclosed in the four-hour debate Tuesday he opposes the perjury 
article but supports the article accusing Clinton of obstruction of 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president should be removed from office for obstruction of  
justice,'' Gorton said during the debate. He released his remarks 
afterward. ``Although the president lied, this specific case of 
perjury does not rise to a level requiring removal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senators from both parties acknowledge Clinton is assured of  
acquittal because the two-thirds margin for conviction cannot be 
attained. Many were slow to get to the chamber this morning for the 
second day of deliberations, raising concerns from Sen. Patrick 
Leahy, D-Vt. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we're going to be off at committee meetings, I don't think  
that does service to the intent of this closed door hearing. ... 
Nothing could be more important than this on our agenda today and 
tomorrow,'' Leahy said. 
</P>
<P>
	For days, senators have been forecasting a stronger conviction  
vote on the obstruction-of-justice article than on a perjury count 
that might not attain even a majority. 
</P>
<P>
	If Clinton is acquitted as expected, several Republicans  
expressed a willingness Tuesday to end the impeachment ordeal 
without further action -- leaving it to historians, rather than a 
Senate censure, to judge his efforts to cover up an extramarital 
affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	The censure idea is ``a rose that is beginning to wilt,'' said  
Sen. Larry Craig of Idaho, a member of the Senate Republican 
leadership. Some Democrats, he said, want a censure because they're 
``seeking cover'' for their expected acquittal votes. 
</P>
<P>
	However, a censure resolution -- either immediately following the  
trial or later -- remained a possibility because Republican 
opposition was being countered by support from most Democrats and a 
handful of GOP senators. 
</P>
<P>
	To have a such a measure considered in the 100-member Senate,  
supporters would need 60 votes to hurdle an expected stalling 
action by Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, the leading opponent of a 
censure. He believes a censure violates the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Senate debated his fate Tuesday, Clinton traveled to  
western Virginia for a private meeting with House Democrats holding 
their annual retreat. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Robert Menendez of New Jersey, a member of the House  
Democratic leadership, said the president never overtly mentioned 
impeachment. But, ``He said, 'Thank you for all the support you've 
given me over time, going back to 1993, and I'm committed to you in 
your efforts to achieve a majority''' in the elections in 2000.

<HEADLINE> Right Plants for Butterfly Watching </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	POUND RIDGE, N.Y. (AP) -- Butterfly watching ranks as one of  
gardening's most delightful perks, and you can enjoy and enhance it 
even in small places. The secret is planting the right plants rich 
in nectar and perfume. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of us are familiar with buddleia, known as ``butterfly  
bush'' for the numbers of the beautiful creatures it attracts. But 
there are other plants, like plain old milkweed, worth knowing 
about as butterfly lures. 
</P>
<P>
	A variety of such plants and other aspects of this pastime are  
explored in a revised and updated manual just issued by the Xerces 
Society in association with the Smithsonian Institution and 
published by Sierra Club Books. The book ($24, softcover) is titled 
``Butterfly Gardening, Creating Summer Magic in Your Garden,'' and 
was first published in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	The Xerces Society, a conservationist organization headquartered  
in Portland, Ore., is named for the now-extinct Xerces Blue 
Butterfly. Wiped out by urban expansion, the last known specimens 
were taken in 1941 at the Presidio military base in San Francisco. 
A French entomologist named the butterfly for the Persian King 
Xerxes, but with the French spelling ``Xerces,'' which was 
retained. 
</P>
<P>
	The volume contains fine color closeups of butterflies, a master  
list of plant species that attract them, seed and plant sources, a 
bibliography of books and periodicals, essays by experts on 
ecology, butterflies and other insects and tips on butterfly 
watching and photography. There are diagrams and designs for small 
and large butterfly gardens and a key to geographical regions 
showing which plants are effective where. 
</P>
<P>
	The tone is set in an essay by British entomologist Miriam  
Rothschild of the banking family. Her uncle, Walter, assembled a 
famous collection of 2.25 million butterflies and moths. 
</P>
<P>
	She says, ``I doubt a garden can ever be too large, certainly  
not from the butterfly's viewpoint. But so many of us are forced to 
be satisfied with a small patch of ground that it is an agreeable 
thought that butterflies can be attracted to tiny gardens as well 
as large ones. A buddleia planted against your house, a patch of 
red valerian growing out of a wall, or a lavender bush constitutes 
a true butterfly lure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Rothschild says it is clear that butterflies prefer heavy  
perfume to delicate scents. The color and perfume advertise the 
presence of carbohydrates, which the butterflies need to sustain 
their energy for flight, she explains. 
</P>
<P>
	In another essay, author and lecturer Jo Brewer calls milkweed  
``one of the most important of all butterfly nectar plants'' and 
says that in her Massachusetts garden ``we have recorded 18 species 
of New England butterflies nectaring at this plant, including the 
female Monarch, which takes nectar from and lays her eggs on 
milkweed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among other plants she mentions dame's rocket, garden phlox and  
New England asters to provide continuous bloom from early spring to 
autumn. She also had success with red zinnias and orange marigolds. 
</P>
<P>
	It's one thing to attract butterflies, but other talents and  
expertise are needed to identify them. A good way to start is by 
estimating size - large like a Monarch, medium like a Painted Lady, 
small like skippers and blues. Xerces Society founder Robert 
Michael Pyle gives some tips. Sharp eyes, a net, a good pair of 
tweezers, a hand-held lens, close-focus binoculars and a notebook 
are some requirements Pyle lists. 
</P>
<P>
	``When observing butterflies, remember to move slowly and  
fluidly,'' he warns. ``Rapid movements put butterflies to flight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He says ``a little practice perfects usage of a net. It is  
critical to follow through so that the target insect is swept deep 
into the net bag. If you are gentle and use care and forceps, you 
can examine butterflies and then release them without harm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In time, Pyle says, the budding lepidopterist ``will get to know  
that swallowtails and fritillaries have a special fondness for 
thistle and mint nectar, while hairstreaks love dogbane and 
milkweed. Crescent-spots flap and glide, but skippers, of similar 
color and size, fly with quick jerky movements. Soon, basic 
discrimination is easy, and you become a sharper observer in the 
process of having fun.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> NBC Will Happily Live in the '60's / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- If the 1990s are a drag, NBC will gladly return  
to the 1960s or 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	The network's music-packed miniseries, ``The '60's,'' was a hit  
in its debut Sunday night, helping the network to an easy ratings 
victory during the first week of the important February ``sweeps'' 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics didn't much like the two-part miniseries, but its  
opening night audience of 24 million viewers was bigger than any 
other program last week except NBC's trio of Thursday night hits, 
Nielsen Media Research said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frasier,'' the week's second most-watched show, drew higher  
ratings than normal on Thursday night with actor Woody Harrelson 
reprising his role from the 1980s hit ``Cheers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``ER'' was the week's most popular show, as is customary, in its  
countdown to George Clooney's departure. 
</P>
<P>
	In what's becoming a tradition in one of the four ``sweeps''  
months -- when ratings are watched closely to set local advertising 
rates -- Fox drew solid numbers with dramatic nonfiction 
programming. Last Thursday's specials included ``World's Most 
Shocking Moments'' and a daredevil jump by Robbie Knievel. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week, NBC had a 10.3 rating and 17 share. CBS was a  
solid second with a 9.3 rating and 15 share, ABC had a 7.9 rating 
and 13 share and Fox was at 7.2 and 11. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the developing networks, the WB had a 3.3 rating and 5  
share, UPN had a 2.1 rating and 3 share and Pax TV had a 0.8 rating 
and 1 share. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's ``World News Tonight'' was the top-rated evening news  
program, the third week in a row it has won or shared the lead. ABC 
had an 8.7 rating and 17 share, NBC's ``Nightly News'' was at 8.4 
and 16 and the ``CBS Evening News'' had a 7.7 rating and 15 share. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. Share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of Feb. 1-7, the top 10 shows, their networks and  
ratings were ``ER,'' NBC, 20.3; ``Frasier,'' NBC, 17.0; 
``Friends,'' NBC, 16.9; ``NBC Sunday Night Movie: The '60's, Part 
One,'' NBC, 15.1; ``60 Minutes,'' CBS, 14.8; ``Touched By an 
Angel,'' CBS, 14.7; ``Veronica's Closet,'' NBC, 14.1; ``Jesse,'' 
NBC, 13.5; ``Dateline NBC-Monday,'' NBC, 13.0; ``CBS Sunday Movie: 
Night Ride Home,'' CBS, 12.3.

<HEADLINE> Maryland's Ekezie Out for Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLLEGE PARK, Md. (AP) -- Maryland center Obinna Ekezie had his  
troubled season come to a disappointing and premature end Wednesday 
when tests revealed he has a ruptured right Achilles tendon. 
</P>
<P>
	Ekezie, a 6-foot-10 senior, was averaging 12.7 points and 5.9  
rebounds in his final season at Maryland. He had started 87 
straight games for the Terrapins before being replaced in the 
starting lineup by freshman Lonny Baxter against Virginia on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ekezie hurt his heel late in Tuesday's practice, school  
officials said. A magnetic resonance imaging procedure Wednesday 
afternoon determined that he had a ruptured Achilles tendon. The 
seventh-ranked Terrapins played at North Carolina State on 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obinna has done a great deal for this program in the past four  
years, and he will be missed very much,'' coach Gary Williams said 
in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Ekezie, a native of Nigeria, scored only one point Jan. 31 at  
Wake Forest and followed that will a two-rebound effort against 
Duke. That caused Williams to shake up the lineup and replace 
Ekezie with Baxter, who keyed a second-half surge that helped 
Maryland pull away to a 77-62 Atlantic Coast Conference victory 
over the Cavaliers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ekezie came off the bench to score eight points and grab six  
rebounds in a season-low 17 minutes. It was only the third time in 
his last 17 games that he failed to score in double figures, but 
this season his scoring and rebounding averages are lower than they 
were a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Ekezie currently ranks fourth on the team in scoring and  
is second in rebounding and blocked shots. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he never played basketball before coming to the United  
States before his senior year of high school, Ekezie on Dec. 12 
became the 34th player in school history to top the 1,000-point 
barrier. He scored 1,172 points in his college career. 
</P>
<P>
	He is one of only four Terrapins to record 1,000 points, 600  
rebounds and 100 blocked shots.

<HEADLINE> A Muted Loman in 'Salesman' Revival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Any ``Death of a Salesman'' worth its salt  
should move an audience to tears. 
</P>
<P>
	A Broadway revival of Arthur Miller's classic drama, which  
opened Wednesday (50 years to the day after the original arrived in 
New York), never quite does, although it comes close. 
</P>
<P>
	This respectful production, imported from Chicago's Goodman  
Theater, stars Brian Dennehy as Willy Loman, a salesman who defines 
himself by what he does. When Willy's job disappears, it shatters 
not only his life, but the lives of those around him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Salesman'' is a tale of unbearable sadness, something that  
Miller captured not only in his brilliant portrait of Willy, but in 
the three other members of the Loman household: Willy's loyal wife 
Linda; his elder son, Biff, a golden boy beginning to tarnish, and 
his youngest child, Happy, a skirt-chasing, good-time guy. 
</P>
<P>
	Director Robert Falls' version weighs in at three hours plus --  
and you feel it. He has taken a cautious, reverential approach to 
the play. Maybe that's why Dennehy gives a curiously muted 
performance. The actor is a large, broad man, which works against 
his characterization, although Lee J. Cobb, who was the first Willy 
Loman in 1949, was not exactly small. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Willy's humiliating meeting with the smarmy son of  
his old boss should be unnerving to watch. You get the feeling 
Dennehy could flatten the little twerp anytime he wanted to. 
</P>
<P>
	This salesman is falling apart psychologically, something  
Dennehy doesn't convincingly convey. Willy's breakdown appears 
studied, almost forced. The actor, though, does rise to 
considerable heights in his final embrace of Biff. There's a 
fragility here that is missing from the rest of his cautious 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Considerable emotional firepower comes from Elizabeth Franz, who  
plays Linda. Franz, a veteran stage performer best-known for 
originating the title role in ``Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It 
All for You,'' delicately portrays both sides of this extraordinary 
woman. 
</P>
<P>
	Her Linda clearly adores Willy -- just look at Franz's radiant  
smile -- yet she is realistic enough to know the man's flaws. She 
chills her sons and the audience when she admonishes her children 
that ``attention must be paid'' to this slowly drowning man. 
</P>
<P>
	Franz is a small, almost emaciated woman, a distinct contrast to  
the hulking Dennehy, yet there is a physicality to her performance. 
She literally throws herself on Willy's grave in the play's final 
scene, a moment Miller fittingly entitled ``Requiem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Anderson's Biff blusters with macho enthusiasm and yet  
finds the insecurity that haunts the young man's life. He, too, is 
particularly fine in the tormented father-son reunion, when Willy's 
illusions are stripped bare and Biff admits the failures of his own 
life. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the strengths of the original production apparently were  
Jo Mielziner's expressionistic settings, which served both the 
psychological and realistic aspects of the play. The current 
production on stage at the Eugene O'Neill Theater does neither and 
simply looks awkward. 
</P>
<P>
	Designer Mark Wendland's turntable sets are fussy and  
distracting. Willy's life is contracting, closing in on him. These 
swirling sets convey nothing of the man's entrapment. 
</P>
<P>
	By now, ``Death of a Salesman'' has attained such a rarefied  
position in American dramatic literature that its status as a 
classic may have intimidated Dennehy. Yet the power and the poetry 
of Miller's crowning achievement still come through. An imperfect 
revival then, but one that still packs a punch, particularly when 
Franz's Linda proclaims the importance of the salesman she has 
married.

<HEADLINE> Ski Chief Looks to New Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VAIL, Colo. (AP) -- It will take courage as much as money for  
international skiing to thrive in the 21st century, the head of the 
sport says. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are aware of the fact that in the new millennium, there  
will be a major fight between sports for television time, mainly in 
Europe but it might also be in North America,'' said Gian-Franco 
Kasper, president of the International Ski Federation. ``We have a 
lot of special sports coming up. The old traditional sports will 
have to fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kasper points to a major advantage enjoyed by skiing -- it is the  
only major international sport in Europe during winter. But, he 
says, it's time to go forward. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't speak of modernization as a revolution. ...  
Modernization for me is a question of the spirit, the mentality,'' 
he said. ``That's exactly what we have to change with our people, 
to be open to all new ideas and to have the courage to try them 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the last 15 years, we've had a lot of ideas from  
journalists, from the industry, from our own people, but we didn't 
have the courage to make real changes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kasper noted that, without such courage, his organization  
wouldn't have grown from its original membership of 14 nations 75 
years ago to 100 today. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasper, presiding over the World Alpine Ski Championships, says  
today's children will determine whether his federation remains a 
force. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have the potential of millions and millions of young skiers  
all over the world, but we have to get those kids into our sport,'' 
he said. ``It's relatively easy to do it in Europe, with the 
European system. I know it's much more difficult to do it in the 
United States, where you have a different mentality, a different 
approach to sports clubs. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Europe, everything is based on the local ski clubs. The  
local ski clubs normally takes the kids when they are 5 or 6 years 
old, not for competition but just into the society, and the result 
at the very far end is that out of thousand kids in the local ski 
club, you might get one or two who are skiing well and will make 
the national team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In North America, he said, the sport could help itself by  
putting involvement ahead of money. 
</P>
<P>
	``Children should never have to pay for a ticket to a ski race  
and children under 12 should never have to pay for a lift ticket,'' 
he said. ``This is how you can get them involved.''. 
</P>
<P>
	There is also the question of language.  
</P>
<P>
	``The main language of Alpine skiing for many years was German,  
so it was difficult for the French and the Americans, for instance, 
to even follow what was happening,'' Kasper said. ``We have changed 
that a little bit. Although we speak a lousy English, we try at 
least to speak in English and that I think worldwide helps a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By recruiting youngsters and breaking language barriers, Kasper  
thinks skiing has a chance to spread beyond its central European 
roots. 
</P>
<P>
	``We saw the Super Bowl figures here -- 100 million in the  
states, plus 20 million worldwide,'' Kasper said. ``In the men's 
downhill, we have between 450 million and 500 million viewers 
watching. In Austria, 60 percent were watching Vail. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know you cannot create this here in this country, but  
looking a little bit at what happens over there could help create 
enthusiasm for our sport.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Comments on Impeachment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A timeline of President Clinton's comments and testimony about  
Monica Lewinsky and allegations of perjury and obstruction of 
justice that led to the Senate impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Jan. 17, 1998, Paula Jones deposition:  
</P>
<P>
	Q: ``Did you have an extramarital sexual affair with Ms.  
Lewinsky?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton: ``No.''  
</P>
<P>
	Q: ``If she told someone that she had a sexual affair with you  
beginning in November of 1995, would that be a lie?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton: ``It's certainly not the truth. It would not be the  
truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Jan. 17, 1998, Paula Jones deposition:  
</P>
<P>
	Q: ``So I understand, your testimony is that it was possible,  
then, that you were alone with (Ms. Lewinsky), but you have no 
specific recollection of that ever happening?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton: ``Yes, that's correct. It's possible that she, in,  
while she was working there, brought something to me and that at 
the time she brought it to me, she was the only person there. 
That's possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Jan. 26, 1998, televised White House event:  
</P>
<P>
	``I want to say one thing to the American people. I want you to  
listen to me. I'm going to say this again. I did not have sexual 
relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky. I never told anybody to 
lie. Not a single time. Never. These allegations are false. And I 
need to go back to work for the American people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Aug. 17, 1998, grand jury testimony:  
</P>
<P>
	``When I was alone with Ms. Lewinsky on certain occasions in  
early 1996, and once in early 1997, I engaged in conduct that was 
wrong. These encounters did not consist of sexual intercourse. They 
did not constitute sexual relations, as I understood that term to 
be defined at my January 17th, 1998 deposition. 
</P>
<P>
	``But they did involve inappropriate, intimate contact. These  
inappropriate encounters ended at my insistence in early 1997. I 
also had occasional telephone conversations with Ms. Lewinsky that 
included inappropriate sexual banter. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Aug. 17, 1998, grand jury testimony:  
</P>
<P>
	Q: ``You are aware, are you not, Mr. President, that the  
subpoena called for the production of, among other things, all the 
gifts that you had given Ms. Lewinsky? You were aware of that on 
December 28th, weren't you?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton: ``I'm not sure, and I understand this is an important  
question. I did have a conversation with Ms. Lewinsky at some time 
about gifts, the gifts I'd given her. ... And I told her that if 
they asked her for gifts, she'd have to give them whatever she had, 
that that's what the law was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Aug. 17, 1998, grand jury testimony:  
</P>
<P>
	Clinton: ``What I was trying to determine was whether my  
recollection was right because (presidential secretary Betty 
Currie) was always in the office complex when Monica was there, and 
whether she thought she could hear any conversations we had or did 
she hear any.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Q: ``Ms. Currie testified that these were not really questions  
to her, that they were more like statements. Is that not the 
truth?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton: ``Well, I can't testify as to what her perception was.  
I can tell you this: I was trying to get information in a hurry. I 
was downloading what I remembered. ... So I was not trying to get 
Betty Currie to say something that was untruthful.'' 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	Aug. 17, 1998, nationally televised speech:  
</P>
<P>
	``As you know, in a deposition in January, I was asked questions  
about my relationship with Monica Lewinsky. While my answers were 
legally accurate, I did not volunteer information. 
</P>
<P>
	``Indeed, I did have a relationship with Ms. Lewinsky that was  
not appropriate. In fact, it was wrong. It constituted a critical 
lapse in judgment and a personal failure on my part for which I am 
solely and completely responsible.''

<P>
	``I have been your friend. I've done my best to be your friend,  
but I also let you down and I let my family down and I let this 
country down. But I'm trying to make it right. And I'm determined 
never to let anything like that happen again.''

posed by the House Judiciary Committee:

friends, or colleagues to know the full nature of my relationship 
with Ms. Lewinsky. ... I misled people about this relationship. I 
have repeatedly apologized for doing so. ... 
</P>
<P>
	``I did not tell Ms. Lewinsky to lie, and I did not tell anybody  
to lie about my relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.''

<P>
	Dec. 19, 1998, after the House of Representatives voted to  
impeach: 
</P>
<P>
	``I have accepted responsibility for what I did wrong in my  
personal life, and I have invited members of Congress to work with 
us to find a reasonable bipartisan and proportionate response. 
</P>
<P>
	``That approach was rejected today by Republicans in the House,  
but I hope it will be embraced by the Senate. I hope there will be 
a constitutional and fair means of resolving this matter in a 
prompt manner. ...

<P>
	``We must stop the politics of personal destruction. We must get  
rid of the poisonous venom of excessive partisanship, obsessive 
animosity and uncontrolled anger.''

<HEADLINE> Dartmouth To End Single-Sex Frats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HANOVER, N.H. (AP) -- Dartmouth College, the school that inspired  
``Animal House,'' plans to put an end to single-sex fraternities 
and sororities to foster more ``respectful relations'' between the 
sexes. 
</P>
<P>
	Dartmouth students were in an uproar Wednesday over the plan.  
</P>
<P>
	``This was like a bomb,'' said Misha Rosoff, 23, rush chairman  
at Sigma Alpha Epsilon. ``Everyone sort of assumed that the 
trustees would try to get rid of the Greek system, but this came 
with no warning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the Ivy League school refused to say whether the  
plan means requiring fraternities and sororities to go coed or 
phasing them out altogether, but college President James Wright 
said it will be the biggest change in social life at Dartmouth 
since women were admitted in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	The move, announced in a letter to students, is aimed at  
encouraging ``respectful relations between women and men.'' College 
administrators said they are concerned about problem drinking and 
the social fragmentation that sometimes accompanies the Greek 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	The college did not say specifically when the changes would be  
put into effect. 
</P>
<P>
	The details are to be worked out in consultation with students  
and backed with tens of millions of dollars for construction of new 
housing, dining and social areas to replace the Greek houses. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end, the Greek system, ``as we know it today, will not  
continue,'' Wright said in an interview Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dartmouth has had fraternities for more than 158 years, and they  
are a major part of the school's image and the social life in 
Hanover, a snowy town of about 7,000 people 135 miles from Boston. 
According to the student paper, The Dartmouth, more than 35 percent 
of the 4,300 undergraduates are members of 25 single-sex 
fraternities and sororities. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Greek system is a very huge thing up here,'' said Brad  
Bingham, 22, a member of Alpha Delta. ``If there was a city or a 
bigger town with more things to do, maybe it wouldn't be so 
important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Miller, a member of Alpha Delta when he was a Dartmouth  
student, co-wrote ``Animal House,'' the 1978 comedy about 
frat-house debauchery. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time they plant a tree or modify the curriculum they  
constantly have student meetings and discussions,'' complained 
Catherine Curran, 19, a sophomore and sorority member from Las 
Vegas. ``For something this drastic, they should have gotten 
student input.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The national organizations of some fraternities and sororities  
do not permit coed membership, and that could prove a hurdle. 
</P>
<P>
	The 120,000 living members of Sigma Alpha Epsilon would have to  
vote to change the fraternity's bylaws to admit women, and ``the 
chances of that are slim to none,'' said Ben Lewis, a spokesman in 
Evanston, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know of no modern-day fraternity or sorority who has allowed  
anyone in of another gender,'' Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Something that could become a model for Dartmouth occurred at  
Middlebury College in Vermont in 1991, Middlebury spokesman Phil 
Benoit said. 
</P>
<P>
	The trustees there ``basically said to the Greek system houses,  
`It's all right to remain here, but you must open membership to 
both genders,''' he said. He said nearly all complied, though they 
changed names and affiliations.

<HEADLINE> Stranded Tourists Extend Vacations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Sun, sand, pina coladas. For some  
passengers stranded in the Caribbean by this week's American 
Airlines pilots' sickout, things could have been worse. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess we'll look at it as an extension of our vacation,''  
said Bob Young of New Washington, Ohio, as he and his wife, Chris, 
surveyed red ``canceled'' messages on screens Wednesday at San 
Juan's Luis Munoz Marin Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	He pointed to a box of duty-free liquor from the nearby U.S.  
Virgin Islands and grinned. ``At least we've got lots of sedatives 
to get us through it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For many, however, the delays caused anxiety.  
</P>
<P>
	Jose Serra of Aguadilla, Puerto Rico, drove two hours Wednesday  
to San Juan to pick up his son, who was supposed to arrive from New 
York. Two New York flights later, he was still waiting. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point, he could be on any airline, coming from  
anywhere,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge in Dallas on Wednesday ordered American's pilots  
to stop calling in sick in their dispute over pay and to return to 
work Thursday. The dispute has delayed travel for more than 200,000 
passengers by grounding some 2,500 flights since Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The fallout has been widespread in the Caribbean, where American  
and its American Eagle commuter affiliate control about 70 percent 
of the region's $1 billion air-travel market. American Eagle was 
unaffected, but dozens of American flights were canceled in San 
Juan, where American's regional hub operates more than 80 flights 
daily. 
</P>
<P>
	Alternatives for passengers were limited.  
</P>
<P>
	Unable to get home, some vacationers were booked into beachside  
hotels or received meal and transportation vouchers to spend a few 
hours waiting anywhere other than the San Juan airport terminal, 
where seating is scarce. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are worse places to be stuck for four hours,'' said  
Margo Litwin of New York, who was reading a paperback by the 
palm-shaded, beachside pool of the San Juan Grand Hotel. Her 
luggage was packed and ready for a flight home. 
</P>
<P>
	Airline ticket counters were jammed with tourists, many of whom  
had just disembarked from cruise ships. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can tell my boss in Chicago I'm infuriated,'' said a  
smiling Derrick Larien as he picked up his bags for a night's stay 
at a San Juan hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of travelers did manage to get home -- on carriers such  
as US Airways and Delta Air Lines. With American Eagle on schedule, 
travel between San Juan and many Caribbean islands continued 
normally. 
</P>
<P>
	Even diplomats weren't immune.  
</P>
<P>
	At a 17-nation conference of developing countries in Montego  
Bay, Jamaica, delegates booked on American to fly through Miami to 
Europe and other points were trying to change carriers Wednesday. 
They said American told them they could not guarantee any flight 
until the day of departure. 
</P>
<P>
	Tourism officials watched developments warily, mindful of a  
short-lived American pilots' strike in 1997 that cost hotels, 
cruise companies and tour operators millions of dollars in lost 
bookings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every hotel is mortally terrified of what could happen,'' said  
John Bell, general director of the Puerto Rico-based Caribbean 
Hotel Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Caribbean tourism is a $17 billion industry and directly or  
indirectly employs 690,000 people, according to the Barbados-based 
Caribbean Tourism Organization. Nearly half the region's tourists 
come from the United States, as do more than 80 percent of its 
cruise ship passengers.

<HEADLINE> Cendant Posts $302M 4Q Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Cendant Corp. suffered a net loss of $302  
million in the fourth quarter because of charges it took to pull 
out of proposed acquisitions and to settle a class-action lawsuit 
over an accounting fraud scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding the charges, the franchiser of names like Ramada  
hotels and Avis car rentals earned $190 million, or 22 cents a 
share, in the three months ended Dec. 31 up 65 percent from the 
year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings beat Wall Street expectations. A survey of analysts  
by First Call Corp. projected earnings of 20 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's adjusted results also excluded a 46 cents a share  
gain from the sales of its Hebdo Mag International publishing 
subsidiary and some software businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings report was released after the market has closed.  
Shares of Cendant closed down $1.18 3/4 at $19 in trading on the New 
York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Cendant took a $433.5 million charge to pull out of a merger  
with Miami-based American Bankers Insurance Group Inc. and a $219 
million deal to buy Providian Auto and Home Insurance Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also agreed to raise the value of Prides, a special  
class of securities Cendant issued two months before its stock 
value plunged by $14 billion with its disclosures of accounting 
fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Cendant has said that employees at CUC International Inc., the  
Stamford, Conn.-based membership club giant that merged with 
Parsippany, N.J., franchiser HFS Inc. to form Cendant in December 
1997, posted more than $500 million in bogus revenues for 
businesses that sold memberships to travel, discount entertainment 
and shopping clubs. 
</P>
<P>
	The revelations led to the resignations of 10 directors,  
including CUC founder Walter Forbes, a huge class-action 
shareholder lawsuit and a loss in market value of more than $20 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Cendant also said Wednesday it plans to sell three Internet  
companies it said weren't profitable enough, although it intended 
to stay in the Internet membership business. The companies are 
RentNet, Match.com and GoodMovies.com. 
</P>
<P>
	Cendant moved its corporate headquarters from Parsippany, N.J.,  
to New York last month.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Scandal Keeps Growing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The amazing thing was how raw it became, how all pretense was  
dropped at the end. 
</P>
<P>
	By then, according to a report released Tuesday by a Salt Lake  
City ethics panel, all shame and any fear of getting caught was 
apparently gone. By then, the grafters and glad-handers and poseurs 
no longer bothered to couch their requests as ``scholarship funds'' 
or even ``humanitarian aid.'' By then, there was no need. They 
simply asked for the money. 
</P>
<P>
	For enough money to put a family of four up in a top-of-the-line  
Paris hotel for a week and a half. For tens of thousands of dollars 
for the relative of an IOC member to cushion the pain of a divorce. 
</P>
<P>
	To twist one of IOC boss Juan Antonio Samaranch's pet phrases,  
what is unfolding in Salt Lake City will probably be remembered as 
the best Olympic scandal ever. Not because it involved the most 
money, but because the people in charge kept what amounts to the 
best record of an Olympic bribery scandal ever. 
</P>
<P>
	That might be a uniquely American habit. Handing over gifts and  
entertaining lavishly is not just the cost of doing business in 
this country anymore, it's practically the cornerstone. It's 
encouraged. It's perfectly legitimate. It's even tax deductible. 
It's also why the Super Bowl winds up in one town as opposed to 
another; and the Republican convention, the optometrists 
convention, the Scrabble convention and so on. 
</P>
<P>
	And so why, someone asked IOC vice president Dick Pound a few  
days ago, should the Olympics be any different? 
</P>
<P>
	The Canadian's answer cut right to the chase. Anachronism or  
not, the Olympics are supposed to be above purchase, about 
something other than money. 
</P>
<P>
	Towns that go after the Super Bowl, that hand out hotel suites  
and tickets to ride in the front of the airplane, are upfront about 
the process. They are spending money to make money. Towns that go 
after the Olympics have always done the same thing. The difference 
is that while the chase takes place, everybody talks about grander 
stuff, about fostering world peace and harmony. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Gary Hart's ill-fated run for the Democratic presidential  
nomination a few years ago, or even Falcons safety Eugene 
Robinson's late-night prowling on the eve of the Super Bowl a few 
weeks ago, that's practically an invitation to have people prove 
otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
	This time around, the people in charge got sloppy. They got most  
of the paperwork past the first wave of auditors, but then somebody 
besides the IOC members for whom they were intended noticed the 
Salt Lake City boosters' conspiratorial wink. Enough records turned 
up to fill out a 300-page report. 
</P>
<P>
	That attention to detail will be the undoing of a lot of people.  
When Salt Lake City's bid to host the 1998 Winter Games was beaten 
by Nagano, Japan, a few of the organizers took careful notes on 
what the IOC members carried off. They saw how much more the 
selectors prized the video recorders Nagano handed out than the 
disposable cameras they were giving away. 
</P>
<P>
	That was probably when the resolve not to be trumped again  
turned to arrogance. The Salt Lake City people had no problem 
copying Nagano's largess when they should have been copying their 
stealth instead. 
</P>
<P>
	It's roundly believed that the Japanese backers of the bid for  
those Winter Games budgeted -- and spent -- $10 million for the final 
week of the selection process, roughly $10,000 per member. The 
reason exact figures are not available, unlike Salt Lake City's 
effort, is because the records were burned. 
</P>
<P>
	Anybody who asked to see them received this official response:  
There was nothing in them that the public needed to know. That's 
why Nagano Gov. Goro Yoshimura told Kyodo News service with a 
straight face that the IOC investigation showed that the way his 
organizing committee treated IOC members was ``within the scope of 
common sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such statements by anybody connected to the Salt Lake City bid  
will raise a red flag for some time to come. The Justice 
Department, the General Accounting Office and the Utah Attorney 
General are going to be sifting through the paperwork, too much of 
it too blatant to disguise any longer. 
</P>
<P>
	Some lessons are tough to learn. Think back to that classic  
moment in ``All The President's Men'' when ``Deep Throat,'' the 
source who guides a pair of reporters trying to uncover a scandal 
that would rock the country. 
</P>
<P>
	What he said was this: ``Follow the money.''

<HEADLINE> Sen. J.Kerry Mulls Presidential Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. John Kerry is planning several more  
visits to New Hampshire next month as he nears a decision about 
running for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Friends describe the Massachusetts Democrat as genuinely  
conflicted over the prospect, interested in promoting an agenda 
that would focus on education but realistic about the 
organizational and fund-raising lead already built by Vice 
President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview Wednesday as he headed to the Senate chamber to  
make his speech about the impeachment charges against President 
Clinton, Kerry said: ``I'm going to wrap this up in the next week 
or so. I really don't want to keep this hanging much longer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The senator had hoped to decide by late January, but aides say  
the impeachment proceedings have hindered him in contacting 
potential donors and doing other exploratory work. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerry is now planning to address a citizens round table in New  
Hampshire on March 8. He also is trying to arrange a speech at New 
Hampshire College in Manchester on the same day. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Kerry hopes to make an appearance in March before  
the Laconia, N.H., Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	If Kerry keeps to the timetable he outlined Wednesday, those  
speeches would come after he has announced his decision about 
running for president. 
</P>
<P>
	The challenge before Kerry is daunting. With the California and  
New York primaries moved up to March just weeks after the Iowa 
caucuses and New Hampshire primary, political analysts say 
presidential candidates have to build a campaign kitty of $20 
million by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the fund-raisers Kerry has previously tapped in  
Massachusetts, including former Democratic National Committee 
finance chairman Alan Solomont, have already signed onto Gore's 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerry also has extensive contacts in Hollywood, a political pot  
of gold for Democrats in recent years. Gore, however, makes 
official and campaign visits to California monthly and has made 
inroads with many of Kerry's previous supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Kerry has about $500,000 in debt remaining for his  
1996 re-election campaign against former Massachusetts Gov. William 
F. Weld. 
</P>
<P>
	Complicating matters is the political groundwork done by former  
Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, who has already said he is running 
for the Democratic nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerry supporters believe he could be a viable candidate because  
he has high name recognition in New Hampshire, raised more than $12 
million for the Weld campaign and has a record of working for 
school improvements and programs to provide early education and 
health care to infants and toddlers. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerry, 55, gained national prominence in the 1970s when he  
returned from Navy service in Vietnam and led protests against the 
war.

<HEADLINE>  3 GOP Senators Say They'll Acquit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican support for convicting and removing  
President Clinton waned today as senators debated impeachment for a 
second day behind closed doors. Three GOP senators announced they 
would reject both the perjury and obstruction of justice charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will vote to acquit on both articles,'' said Sen. John  
Chafee of Rhode Island, a key moderate Republican. Chafee said 
House prosecutors had not met the burden of proof that Clinton 
committed crimes because their ``circumstantial evidence is 
rebutted by direct evidence or confusion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sens. James Jeffords of Vermont and Arlen Specter of  
Pennsylvania said they, too, would not support allegations of 
perjury and obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Specter, citing the laws of Scotland, said there could be  
``three possible verdicts: guilty, not guilty, not proved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the option in this trial, I suspect many senators would  
choose 'not proved' instead of 'not guilty,''' the Pennsylvania 
Republican said in a statement that he planned to deliver on the 
Senate floor 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffords said Clinton had committed shameful acts but his  
offenses ``do not reach the high standard of impeachment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other senators' decisions announced today were not a surprise.  
Democrat Tom Harkin of Iowa left the chamber to read reporters his 
statement in favor of acquittal. Sen. Dick Lugar, R-Ind., said he 
would vote to convict on both articles. 
</P>
<P>
	Harkin said the House had presented ``a counterfeit case'' based  
on the efforts of ``an out-of-control independent counsel with a 
blank check.'' He predicted that only one-third of the Senate would 
vote for the perjury article. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said that ``if at  
all possible'' he would like to set a vote for 5 p.m. EST Thursday 
on whether to convict Clinton on the perjury and obstruction of 
justice charges -- votes that by all signs will fall far short of 
the two-thirds majority needed to oust the nation's 42nd president. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we still have speeches and we can't do it then we will  
certainly go over to Friday but I think we need to begin to talk 
about that goal,'' Lott said at the opening of today's trial 
session. The Senate sergeant at arms then closed the doors so the 
debate could begin in private for a second day. 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, spokesman Joe Lockhart said the president is  
``open to the idea of censure.'' But Lockhart added, ``I don't 
think it's appropriate for us to indicate or try to prescribe'' 
punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton will probably have something to say after the Senate  
votes, Lockhart said. The White House has been sensitive to 
possible criticism if Clinton appears to gloat over the likely 
acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
	Both inside and outside the chamber today, GOP senators raised  
doubts about support for a censure or rebuke of the president if he 
is acquitted on the two articles of impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's been very little mention of censure,'' Sen. Bill  
Frist, R-Tenn., said before today's proceedings. ``To me, the push 
for censure is losing steam.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Frist indicated that the debate Tuesday was lawyerly on the  
article alleging that Clinton committed perjury before a grand jury 
-- an accusation some Republicans have suggested they may not 
support in the final vote. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Frist's GOP colleagues, Slade Gorton of Washington,  
disclosed in the four-hour debate Tuesday he opposes the perjury 
article but supports the article accusing Clinton of obstruction of 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president should be removed from office for obstruction of  
justice,'' Gorton said during the debate. He released his remarks 
afterward. ``Although the president lied, this specific case of 
perjury does not rise to a level requiring removal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senators from both parties acknowledge Clinton is assured of  
acquittal because the two-thirds margin for conviction cannot be 
attained. Many were slow to get to the chamber this morning for the 
second day of deliberations, raising concerns from Sen. Patrick 
Leahy, D-Vt. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we're going to be off at committee meetings, I don't think  
that does service to the intent of this closed door hearing. ... 
Nothing could be more important than this on our agenda today and 
tomorrow,'' Leahy said. 
</P>
<P>
	For days, senators have been forecasting a stronger conviction  
vote on the obstruction-of-justice article than on a perjury count 
that might not attain even a majority. 
</P>
<P>
	If Clinton is acquitted as expected, several Republicans  
expressed a willingness Tuesday to end the impeachment ordeal 
without further action -- leaving it to historians, rather than a 
Senate censure, to judge his efforts to cover up an extramarital 
affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	The censure idea is ``a rose that is beginning to wilt,'' said  
Sen. Larry Craig of Idaho, a member of the Senate Republican 
leadership. Some Democrats, he said, want a censure because they're 
``seeking cover'' for their expected acquittal votes. 
</P>
<P>
	However, a censure resolution -- either immediately following the  
trial or later -- remained a possibility because Republican 
opposition was being countered by support from most Democrats and a 
handful of GOP senators. 
</P>
<P>
	To have a such a measure considered in the 100-member Senate,  
supporters would need 60 votes to hurdle an expected stalling 
action by Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, the leading opponent of a 
censure. He believes a censure violates the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Senate debated his fate Tuesday, Clinton traveled to  
western Virginia for a private meeting with House Democrats holding 
their annual retreat. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Robert Menendez of New Jersey, a member of the House  
Democratic leadership, said the president never overtly mentioned 
impeachment. But, ``He said, 'Thank you for all the support you've 
given me over time, going back to 1993, and I'm committed to you in 
your efforts to achieve a majority''' in the elections in 2000.

<HEADLINE> Hartsells Win Skating Short Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- As the heavy beat of their music finished,  
Steve Hartsell pumped his fist and then grabbed his sister in a 
bear hug. 
</P>
<P>
	Winning sure feels good.  
</P>
<P>
	The brother-and-sister duo skated a clean and powerful program  
Wednesday night, showing the confidence it takes to stand atop the 
medals podium at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships. Defending 
national champion Kyoko Ina showed her new partnership with John 
Zimmerman still needs a little work. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great to be in first,'' Steve Hartsell said, ``especially  
to be ahead of the defending national champion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Hartsells, skating to ``Piano Et Voix Rythmique,'' were  
first with six of the nine judges in the short program, worth 
one-third of the total score. The free skate is Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ina and Zimmerman, who just began skating together last fall  
after Ina split with former partner Jason Dungjen, were second. 
Laura Handy and J. Paul Binnebose were third. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hartsells won the 1997 World Junior Championships, and have  
been making their way up the senior ranks ever since. They finished 
third at last year's national championships and were determined to 
move up this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Their style is still a little raw, but what they lack in polish  
they make up for in power. Their throw triple salchow was huge, and 
Danielle seemed to fly across half of the rink before she finally 
landed. 
</P>
<P>
	Their overhead lift was nice and with one change in position,  
more difficult than many of the other pairs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been skating really well all week,'' Steve said, ``and  
we were just very excited ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	``To stick it,'' his sister chimed in. ``We're in the best shape  
we've ever been in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ina and Zimmerman are in shape, but they're not in synch.  
</P>
<P>
	Despite winning the last two American crowns and finishing  
fourth at the Nagano Olympics, Ina and Dungjen were barely 
coexisting after seven years together. They split after Dungjen got 
hurt and they had to withdraw from the world championships last 
March. 
</P>
<P>
	Ina hooked up shortly after with Zimmerman, who finished third  
at the 1997 U.S. championships with Stephanie Stiegler, but sat out 
last year. They began working with renowned coach Tamara Moskvina, 
who coached 1998 Olympic gold medalists Artur Dmitriev and Oksana 
Kazakova. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Kyoko) and Tamara have been keeping me up to speed on what  
the pressures will be, and they were on target,'' Zimmerman said. 
``We handled the big tricks, but sometimes the other things can get 
away from you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Skating to ``Don Quixote,'' Ina and Zimmerman showed flashes of  
just how good they can be. Their double twist was huge, and they 
finished with a flourishing ``Natalia'' spin, a unique move in 
which her head is at his feet, one arm wrapped around his leg, the 
other holding hers. 
</P>
<P>
	But they were out of unison on their side-by-side combination  
spin, the hardest thing for new partners to master. And Ina, 
usually almost flawless, barely held on to the landing of the throw 
triple salchow, throwing in a turn at the end to save it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our last competition was the Cup of Russia in November,'' Ina  
said. ``We tried to keep it at that level, but it's still difficult 
when you have that much time off. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had the same anxiety as always at nationals, but there was a  
different sense of now competing again, and it's hard to jump back 
into something,'' she said. ``In the future, we'll be accustomed to 
each other and the anxiety level will be different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Wednesday's ice dancing, Naomi Lang and Peter Tchernyshev  
strengthened their lead in the original dance. The apparent heirs 
to five-time winners Elizabeth Punsalan and Jerod Swallow also took 
the compulsories the previous night. 
</P>
<P>
	As usual in dance, there was little change in the standings,  
with Tuesday's runners-up, Eve Chalom and Mathew Gates, still in 
second place. Third place still belonged to Deborah Koegel and Oleg 
Fediukov heading into Friday's free dance, worth 50 percent of the 
overall score.

<HEADLINE> Tube Talk: Placing Songs on TV Shows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- On an early winter's night, songwriter John  
Hiatt hit the television jackpot. 
</P>
<P>
	Joey and Dawson were discussing their relationship again on  
``Dawson's Creek,'' wrestling over whether Joey would spend a 
semester in France. A piano in the background heralded Hiatt's 1987 
ballad, ``Have a Little Faith in Me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Less than an hour later on ``Party of Five,'' Julia and Ned were  
at his college dorm, trying to decide whether to break up. The 
music came in as an insistent plea: Hiatt's ``Have a Little Faith 
in Me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Watching with a sense of renewed appreciation for her dad was  
Hiatt's 14-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	``My stock went up with her and her friends quite a bit,'' he  
said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
	It did with his record company, too. The placement of songs in  
TV shows -- particularly those popular with a teen-aged audience -- 
are becoming a potent way to expose music and to juice sales. 
</P>
<P>
	It has to be just the right song, though. And just the right  
moment. Matching the two is the job of people like John McCullough, 
Hollywood's most respected music supervisor, who recommends songs 
to television producers to enhance their scenes. 
</P>
<P>
	Music has long played a vital role in movies, but less so in  
television comedies and dramas. McCullough's work has helped change 
the thinking of TV and music executives. 
</P>
<P>
	His placement of an Enya ballad added the perfect touch to a  
moonlit scene in ``Northern Exposure.'' The BoDeans' ``Closer to 
Free'' became a hit song when McCullough suggested it as the theme 
for ``Party of Five.'' Edwin McCain's ``I'll Be'' headed to the Top 
10 after it was used during a key scene in Dawson and Joey's 
endless soap opera. 
</P>
<P>
	Music is also frequently used on ``Homicide: Life on the  
Street,'' ``Providence'' and ``Beverly Hills 90210.'' Sometimes 
musicians come out from the background: ``Ally McBeal'' has made 
Vonda Shepard an integral part of the show, ``New York Undercover'' 
has acts like Tracy Chapman, Ray Charles and Nancy Wilson perform 
in a club featured in every episode of the series, and R.E.M. is 
taping an upcoming appearance on ``Party of Five.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hiatt was happy to grant permission to producers who wanted to  
use ``Have a Little Faith in Me.'' It has been used more than a 
dozen times in movies or television shows. 
</P>
<P>
	``I certainly would think that any time someone can hear your  
music, possibly for the first time, then that's a good thing,'' he 
said. ``As far as soaring record sales, I personally haven't 
experienced that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's still lucrative. A television producer generally pays a  
licensing fee to the song's publisher to use the song, and the 
writer receives royalties every time it is played. If the episode 
is rerun a lot and goes into syndication, a writer can really cash 
in. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though ``Have a Little Faith in Me'' never became a hit on  
the radio, the song he wrote in the mid-1980s to try and smooth a 
rough marriage has since become his signature. Audiences respond 
enthusiastically because of its exposure on screens. The marriage 
didn't last, but the song has. 
</P>
<P>
	McCullough actually chose other songs for those key ``Dawson's  
Creek'' and ``Party of Five'' moments. Producers insisted on Hiatt, 
but he has no complaints. ``It's an incredible song,'' he said. 
``It's always one of those songs that is just sitting there waiting 
for the right scene.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Finding a song to evoke a mood is a matter of instinct.  
McCullough stays away from the obvious -- he doesn't want viewers to 
say ``not that again'' -- and like any music fan, loves to introduce 
people to something new. He has recently used music by bluegrass 
artist Tony Ellis and the Peruvian musicians Duchichelo. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't use music for the sake of using it to be cool,'' he  
said. ``If it doesn't bring something to a scene or an episode, we 
don't use it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCullough knows he's struck the proper chord when the Internet  
is buzzing the next day about the song, and people call producers 
wanting to know the singer. One night, that realization came 
directly to him through a telephone call. 
</P>
<P>
	A friend was on the line, a music executive. He was driving up  
Ventura Boulevard late at night, searching for an open music store 
to buy a Heather Nova song his teen-age daughter simply had to have 
after hearing it on ``Dawson's Creek.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He was yelling at me,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	It isn't always easy to match music and television. Networks  
like to create their own background music because it's cheaper. 
Sometimes artists don't want their work on TV, or don't like a 
particular program. TV shows also generally can't afford the 
typical rate to license songs, so McCullough has to show executives 
how a discount may pay off in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've finally realized the value of 20 million viewers,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlantic Records saw the impact on McCain's ``I'll Be'' almost  
instantly. Sales of his album more than doubled the week after the 
song's appearance on ``Dawson's Creek, said Linda Ferrando, senior 
vice president at Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	Anxious to expose its music any way it can, Atlantic has  
aggressively sought these TV tie-ins. It has a significant 
advantage: the company's corporate parent, Time Warner, also owns 
the WB, the hot new network for teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had many meetings, deciding to really work together -- a  
`you help us, we'll help you' kind of thing,'' Ferrando said. ``We 
understand the WB network is targeting a specific audience and the 
music companies are targeting the same audience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Corporate synergy makes it easier, for example, for producers  
with shows on the WB to license songs from Time Warner labels. But 
it has its dangers: McCullough said producers of ``Dawson's Creek'' 
were pressured to include songs from Time Warner labels, but 
they've insisted on also using songs from other labels. 
</P>
<P>
	The executives walk a fine line with viewers. If they include  
too many Time Warner songs, viewers may suspect the music is a 
sales pitch instead of a key part of the show. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of each ``Dawson's Creek,'' producers flash a graphic  
giving the name of the artists featured in each show. Again, this 
is a danger zone: Do viewers consider this helpful information or 
just another commercial? 
</P>
<P>
	If the music isn't used judiciously, ``You're doing a disservice  
to your viewers,'' McCullough said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Your viewers are tuning in to that episode to be pulled in to  
all the characters' lives,'' he said. ``If you're not using a song 
that conveys a certain emotion or gets across what you're trying to 
say, then what are you doing it for?''

<HEADLINE> CIA Reports on Weapons Concerns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The CIA is becoming increasingly concerned  
that business ``entities'' in China and Russia are trafficking 
weapons of mass destruction to countries such as Iran, Syria and 
India despite restrictions imposed by their own central 
governments. 
</P>
<P>
	A report to Congress on Tuesday by the CIA's Nonproliferation  
Center points to the emergence of independent or quasi-government 
entities in Russia and China as exporters of chemical, biological 
and nuclear weapons technology. The report lauds Moscow and Beijing 
for expanding their commitments to restrict export of deadly 
technologies. 
</P>
<P>
	But in an illustration of the increasingly complex post-Cold War  
world, the report says those commitments may not be enough. 
</P>
<P>
	In May 1998, for example, Russia announced strengthened rules  
restricting business from exporting proliferation-related equipment 
and technology. 
</P>
<P>
	``These actions, if enforced, could help counter the  
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery 
systems,'' the CIA reported. ``However, there are signs that 
Russian entities have continued to engage in behavior inconsistent 
with these steps. Monitoring Russian proliferation behavior, 
therefore, will have to remain a very high priority for some time 
to come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Similarly in China the problem appears to have less to do with  
Beijing's willingness to make commitments and cooperate as with the 
tendencies of entities with newfound independence from the central 
government to make deals with foreign countries seeking missile 
technology and other weapons capability. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the first six months of last year, the period covered by  
the report, ``Chinese entities provided a variety of 
missile-related items and assistance to several countries of 
proliferation concern,'' the CIA reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese organizations, some with direct ties to the Beijing  
government, others with more diverse organizational structures, 
supplied advanced conventional weapons to Iran, according to the 
report. Despite U.S. sanctions imposed in 1997 on seven Chinese 
entities, the CIA reported, some of these organizations continued 
to supply Iran and Syria with chemical weapons-related materials, 
including basic ingredients in some chemical weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	The CIA cited Russian companies for supplying ``a variety of  
ballistic missile-related goods and technical know-how to foreign 
countries'' during the first half of last year. The agency said 
Iran relied on Russia's help in developing the Shahab-3 
medium-range ballistic missile, first flight tested last July. 
Russia was also ``a key supplier for civilian nuclear programs in 
Iran and, to a lesser extent, India.'' 
</P>
<P>
	India, which has long had nuclear capability, is less reliant on  
Russian help than Iran, according to the CIA. 
</P>
<P>
	The report lists Russia, China and North Korea as the key  
``supplier nations'' for weapons of mass destruction and Iran, 
Iraq, India, Pakistan, Syria, Egypt, Libya, Sudan and, again, North 
Korea, as the key consumer nations of these weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Throughout the first half of 1998, North Korea continued to  
export ballistic missile-related equipment and missile components 
and materials to countries of concern,'' according to the CIA. 
``Pyongyang attaches a high priority to the development and sale of 
ballistic missiles, equipment, and related technology. North Korea 
has little else to export to raise significant amounts of hard 
currency besides ballistic missiles and other weapons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Egypt, a U.S. ally and beneficiary from billions of dollars in  
annual aid from Washington, was one of North Korea's key customers 
for missile technology and components, part of what the CIA termed 
a long-running pattern of cooperation between the two nations.

	Iraq is barred by an international arms embargo from importing  
weapons technology but continues to buy civilian equipment that 
could be converted for use in chemical weapons production, 
according to the CIA. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since the Gulf War, Baghdad has rebuilt key portions of its  
chemical production infrastructure for industrial and commercial 
use,'' the CIA reported. ``Some of these facilities could be 
converted fairly quickly for production of (chemical weapons) 
agents. Iraq retains a CW capability and intends to reconstitute 
its pre-Gulf war capability as rapidly as possible once sanctions 
are lifted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The CIA identifies Iran as perhaps the most aggressive developer  
of weapons-of-mass-destruction capability, seeking its own 
indigenous missile capability, working to develop a nuclear 
capability, beginning work on a biological weapons program, and 
expanding its already formidable chemical weapons arsenal that 
includes stockpiles of ``blister, blood and choking agents and the 
bombs and artillery shells for delivery them.''

<HEADLINE> Former AP Farm Writer Kendall Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Don Kendall, farm writer for The Associated  
Press for 23 years before his retirement in 1991, has died after 
suffering a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall, 70, was stricken Monday while driving near his home in  
suburban Silver Spring, Md. 
</P>
<P>
	His byline was a fixture for more than 20 years in newspapers  
across America, especially in the Farm Belt. He produced six 
columns a week while covering the Agriculture Department from 1968 
to his retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don had a remarkable career in journalism,'' said Sandy  
Johnson, Washington bureau chief for the AP. ``He was dedicated to 
telling readers about food and farms, and the intersection of the 
two.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps and a graduate of Kansas  
State University, Kendall began his journalism career at the 
Hutchinson (Kan.) News, where he covered agriculture issues and the 
state Legislature for 11 years. He was named a Nieman Fellow at 
Harvard University in 1964 and joined the AP in Kansas City, Mo., 
three years later. 
</P>
<P>
	He transferred to Washington in 1967 and was named AP farm  
writer the following year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to be a farm writer,'' Kendall wrote then-AP President  
Wes Gallagher. ``Agriculture is too vital to be viewed entirely 
from the barnyard, too important to be entrusted entirely to the 
bureaucrats.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His hands-on approach typically produced a crop of homegrown  
tomatoes that would appear, without fanfare, in large baskets to be 
enjoyed by Washington AP colleagues, many of whom did not know the 
source of the ripe bounty. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, Kendall, who grew up on a small farm near Herington,  
Kan., covered nine secretaries of agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall ``knew the subject matter of this department as well as  
anybody who worked here,'' said Bob Bergland, who was President 
Carter's agriculture secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of his retirement, Kendall's byline file in the AP  
library covered 800 index cards, including some 7,000 farm columns. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Hutchinson News, Kendall covered farm news, politics and  
the state Legislature. One of his assignments was to cover the 
Clutter murder trial in western Kansas, which later became the 
subject of Truman Capote's book ``In Cold Blood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1977, Kendall won the J.S. Russell Memorial Award, the top  
award of the Newspaper Farm Editors of America, now known as the 
National Association of Agricultural Journalists. He was president 
of the group in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to his wife, Lou, survivors include a son, three  
daughters and six grandchildren.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges AmeriCorps Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLLEGE PARK, Md. (AP) -- President Clinton urged Congress on  
Wednesday to expand his AmeriCorps volunteerism program, saying 
young people deserve an opportunity to prove they are not ``a 
generation of cynics and slackers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a rally at the University of Maryland, the president said the  
number of AmeriCorps volunteers could increase by 25 percent if his 
fiscal 2000 budget proposal is approved. He said he wants to expand 
the program every year until it has 100,000 participants by 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	AmeriCorps could then be a springboard for volunteerism at home,  
much like the Peace Corps was for service overseas a generation 
ago, Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``America needs to think of itself as sort of a giant  
AmeriCorps, the Peace Corps at home, getting things done 
together,'' Clinton said. ``It may be your best chance to change 
the lives of others for the better and to enrich your own life in 
the process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president, joined by dozens of AmeriCorps volunteers in gray  
sweatshirts, issued a national ``call to service'' to help the 
program begin recruiting additional volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ask you all to help me reach others ... to use this moment  
to prove that this generation of young people, far from being a 
generation of cynics and slackers, is instead a generation of doers 
and patriots,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton chose to highlight the program in Maryland because the  
state's high school students are required to perform volunteer work 
as a condition of graduation. ``We must be a passionate, engaged 
and concerned community,'' said Maryland Gov. Parris Glendening. 
</P>
<P>
	During the rally, the Corporation for National Service, which  
runs AmeriCorps, unveiled an MTV-produced public service 
announcement that shows hip-looking teens and young adults 
performing service projects, while voice-overs extol the virtues of 
the AmeriCorps experience while cool, pulsing music plays in the 
background. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've learned the rewards of service are greater than the size  
of your paycheck or salary,'' said Justin Ward, 23, a 1998 Maryland 
graduate who coordinates volunteers for Habitat for Humanity in 
Aberdeen, Md. He was one of four volunteers who spoke at the rally. 
</P>
<P>
	A national service program was an early priority of the Clinton  
administration. Since AmeriCorps was established four years ago, 
more than 100,000 people have volunteered as volunteers at schools, 
churches and nonprofit groups. 
</P>
<P>
	But AmeriCorps has not been popular with congressional  
Republicans, who have attempted several times to kill or severely 
curtail the program. One lawmaker suggested that AmeriCorps 
volunteers could be used as census takers. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is seeking $533 million for AmeriCorps in fiscal 2000,  
an increase of $106 million over last year. The increase would 
raise from 50,000 to 70,000 the number of high school- and 
college-age students who could participate next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Clinton's rally, Republican National Committee Chairman  
Jim Nicholson circulated a statement spotlighting a plan ``hidden 
away in Bill Clinton's budget'' to cut $4.6 billion from the 
student loan program. Nicholson called it a ``stingy, shortsighted 
proposal'' that would lead to higher student fees, slower loan 
approvals, fewer loan consolidations and higher interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The RNC sponsored its own forum across the street from Clinton's  
event to discuss Republican complaints about the president's 
education budget.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Supports New Banking Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration threw its support  
Wednesday behind a new version of legislation to lift barriers 
between banks, brokerage firms and insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill proposed by Rep. John LaFalce of New York, the House  
Banking Committee's senior Democrat, would lift the barrier but 
preserve the split regulatory authority between the Treasury 
Department and the Federal Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	In the opening shot of this year's congressional debate on the  
issue, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin called the bill ``the best 
chance'' for gaining bipartisan support and eventual enactment. 
With the exception of a provision that would allow the mixing of 
banking and industrial activities, Rubin told reporters he fully 
supports the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill competes, however, with legislation proposed previously  
by Banking Committee Chairman Rep. Jim Leach, an Iowa Republican, 
which would give the Fed more power over new financial activities. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury, represented by Rubin, and the central bank,  
represented by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, have long 
been at odds over how to overhaul the existing Depression-era 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration wants to let banks diversify through  
subsidiaries of the bank itself, not just through affiliated 
companies within the same parent holding company. That arrangement 
would increase the power of the Treasury's Office of the 
Comptroller of the Currency, regulator of nationally chartered 
banks. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other side of the battle, bills letting banks into other  
kinds of financial activities through a holding company structure 
would expand the Fed's role in regulating financial services 
industries. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer activists, including Ralph Nader, have opposed previous  
versions of the legislation, saying it would concentrate financial 
power in a few hands and hurt consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Paul Kanjorski, D-Pa., expressed concern that with a  
greater mixing of financial industries, regional banks could become 
``vacuum cleaners'' of smaller banks and then be taken over 
themselves by larger corporations. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin's comments Wednedsay came as Wall Street titans, including  
the head of Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., urged Congress to enact financial 
overhaul legislation, a version of which died last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Merrill Lynch Chairman and Chief Executive Officer David  
Komansky appealed to patriotism in exhorting the banking regulators 
to stop feuding. 
</P>
<P>
	``If fiercely competitive financial firms can set aside our  
parochial interests and achieve consensus, surely our government 
agencies can do the same,'' Komansky testified. ``For the sake of 
our nation, all of us need to focus less on turf and more on common 
ground.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Without financial revamping legislation, he warned, ``We're  
speeding into the 21st century in a vehicle that was designed in 
1933.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Komansky was referring to the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act, which  
erected the barriers separating the financial services industries 
at a time when the government feared that banks would become too 
powerful. 
</P>
<P>
	John McCoy, president and chief executive of Bank One Corp., who  
appeared with Komansky, was asked by a lawmaker which approach he 
would prefer, Treasury's or the Fed's. ``I basically believe that 
we can be supportive either way,'' he replied. 
</P>
<P>
	The parade of industry officials testifying in favor of sweeping  
financial legislation also included Michael Patterson, vice 
chairman of investment bank J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co.; Richard Huber, 
chairman, president and CEO of insurance giant Aetna Inc.; Roy 
Zuckerberg, partner in Wall Street giant Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. and 
chairman of the Securities Industry Association; and Matthew Fink, 
president of the Investment Company Institute, which represents the 
mutual fund industry. 
</P>
<P>
	American consumers spend an estimated $300 billion a year on  
financial services. Backers of the overhaul legislation, some of 
whom have been pushing it in Congress for 20 years, say it is 
needed to keep the U.S. financial industry competitive in a 
fast-changing world.

<HEADLINE> Transplant Drug May Speed Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Cyclosporine, a drug given to transplant patients to prevent  
organ rejection, may turn pre-existing cancer more aggressive, 
researchers reported today in the journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	Transplants always carried the risk of cancer because doctors  
must suppress the immune system with powerful drugs such as 
cyclosporine to prevent the patient's body from attacking the new 
organ. 
</P>
<P>
	But previously it was believed the cancer risk increased because  
the weakened immune system failed to destroy defective cells that 
could turn malignant. 
</P>
<P>
	``This study suggests the drug has a direct effect on the tumor  
cell and enhances it growth,'' said Dr. Gary Nabel, a University of 
Michigan researcher who specializes in the immune system. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors were quick to caution that the findings will not affect  
treatment of transplant patients because it applies only to cancer 
that has already formed. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, they emphasized the study provides an important clue  
about blocking cancer growth. 
</P>
<P>
	``If anything, it's a reason for hope,'' said Dr. Manikkam  
Suthanthiran, chief of transplant medicine at Cornell University. 
</P>
<P>
	Suthanthiran and his colleagues isolated human lung and bladder  
cancer cells that were treated with cyclosporine. They also 
injected cancerous cells into specially bred mice that had 
virtually no immune system. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings indicated that cyclosporine promotes the production  
of a natural protein called transforming growth factor beta, 
already a suspect in cancer growth. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our findings in no way mean this is increasing the incidence  
of cancer,'' Suthanthiran said. ``It more reflects that cancer can 
be made more aggressive by a certain protein.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added that the study reveals a potential mechanism for  
blocking cancer by inhibiting the production of TGF beta. 
</P>
<P>
	Cyclosporine, which is also used to treat arthritis, is made by  
the Swiss-based pharmaceutical giant Novartis. Geoff Cook, a 
Novartis spokesman, said the company sees no cause for concern. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Israel Penn, a transplant pioneer at the University of  
Cincinnati, said only a small proportion of transplant patients 
have pre-existing cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the tens of thousands of people receiving cyclosporine for  
years with very beneficial results, the good far, far outweighs the 
bad,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Feared Direct Competition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Microsoft executive testified Wednesday that  
the company's restrictive contracts with Internet service providers 
were intended to prevent consumers from picking -- when given a 
``side-by-side choice'' -- Netscape's Web browser instead of the one 
made by Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft Vice President Cameron Myhrvold said the company asked  
America Online and other Internet service providers to exclusively 
distribute Microsoft's browser ``so we wouldn't lose those 
side-by-side choices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under cross-examination by a Justice Department attorney,  
Myhrvold was questioned about an AOL contract that requires at 
least 85 percent of its customers to use Microsoft's Internet 
Explorer, or ``IE'' browser. 
</P>
<P>
	Government attorney David Boies introduced an e-mail sent to  
Myhrvold by another executive that showed the number of AOL 
customers who used IE jumping from 2 million to 12 1/2 million within 
a year described as a period where ``AOL force fed the browser to 
America Online base.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boies asked Myhrvold several times about Microsoft's motives  
behind its restrictive contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	``You were concerned if you presented users with a choice,  
side-by-side, they would pick the Netscape browser rather than 
yours?'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, that's right,'' Myhrvold said. ``We were nowhere. We were  
the Johnny-come-lately of the Internet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Microsoft felt Netscape had ``mind share,'' or name  
recognition. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would lose many of those decisions if we had to compete  
side-by-side,'' Myhrvold said. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet service providers often signed contracts requiring them  
to distribute Microsoft browsers in exchange for a place on the 
Windows desktop, the first screen people see when they turn on 
their computers. The companies were allowed to ship different 
browsers but only if requested by a customer -- and only if the 
total number shipped was less than 25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In its antitrust lawsuit, the government claims Microsoft used  
its monopoly power and illegal tactics to crush and discourage 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Written testimony by another Microsoft vice president, released  
earlier Wednesday, seemed to somewhat contradict Myhrvold's claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft executive Brad Chase denied that Microsoft required  
AOL to prevent its subscribers from using Netscape software. 
Instead, the company set limits on ways AOL could give it away. 
</P>
<P>
	``If 100 percent of AOL's subscribers converted to Netscape  
Navigator because that is what they decided to use, AOL would not 
be in breach of any term,'' Chase wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that AOL itself is allowed to distribute Netscape's  
software ``provided that AOL uses reasonable efforts to minimize 
its involvement and use of the AOL brand name in conjunction with 
such a distribution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chase said Microsoft insisted on the restrictions because of its  
financial investment when it agreed in 1996 to develop a customized 
version of its Internet browser for AOL's subscribers -- including 
assigning a software engineer to wear a pager at all times so that 
AOL could contact him during an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
	Chase was expected to take the witness stand Thursday morning.

<HEADLINE> A Muted Loman in 'Salesman' Revival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Any ``Death of a Salesman'' worth its salt  
should move an audience to tears. 
</P>
<P>
	A Broadway revival of Arthur Miller's classic drama, which  
opened Wednesday (50 years to the day after the original arrived in 
New York), never quite does, although it comes close. 
</P>
<P>
	This respectful production, imported from Chicago's Goodman  
Theater, stars Brian Dennehy as Willy Loman, a salesman who defines 
himself by what he does. When Willy's job disappears, it shatters 
not only his life, but the lives of those around him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Salesman'' is a tale of unbearable sadness, something that  
Miller captured not only in his brilliant portrait of Willy, but in 
the three other members of the Loman household: Willy's loyal wife 
Linda; his elder son, Biff, a golden boy beginning to tarnish, and 
his youngest child, Happy, a skirt-chasing, good-time guy. 
</P>
<P>
	Director Robert Falls' version weighs in at three hours plus --  
and you feel it. He has taken a cautious, reverential approach to 
the play. Maybe that's why Dennehy gives a curiously muted 
performance. The actor is a large, broad man, which works against 
his characterization, although Lee J. Cobb, who was the first Willy 
Loman in 1949, was not exactly small. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Willy's humiliating meeting with the smarmy son of  
his old boss should be unnerving to watch. You get the feeling 
Dennehy could flatten the little twerp anytime he wanted to. 
</P>
<P>
	This salesman is falling apart psychologically, something  
Dennehy doesn't convincingly convey. Willy's breakdown appears 
studied, almost forced. The actor, though, does rise to 
considerable heights in his final embrace of Biff. There's a 
fragility here that is missing from the rest of his cautious 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Considerable emotional firepower comes from Elizabeth Franz, who  
plays Linda. Franz, a veteran stage performer best-known for 
originating the title role in ``Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It 
All for You,'' delicately portrays both sides of this extraordinary 
woman. 
</P>
<P>
	Her Linda clearly adores Willy -- just look at Franz's radiant  
smile -- yet she is realistic enough to know the man's flaws. She 
chills her sons and the audience when she admonishes her children 
that ``attention must be paid'' to this slowly drowning man. 
</P>
<P>
	Franz is a small, almost emaciated woman, a distinct contrast to  
the hulking Dennehy, yet there is a physicality to her performance. 
She literally throws herself on Willy's grave in the play's final 
scene, a moment Miller fittingly entitled ``Requiem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Anderson's Biff blusters with macho enthusiasm and yet  
finds the insecurity that haunts the young man's life. He, too, is 
particularly fine in the tormented father-son reunion, when Willy's 
illusions are stripped bare and Biff admits the failures of his own 
life. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the strengths of the original production apparently were  
Jo Mielziner's expressionistic settings, which served both the 
psychological and realistic aspects of the play. The current 
production on stage at the Eugene O'Neill Theater does neither and 
simply looks awkward. 
</P>
<P>
	Designer Mark Wendland's turntable sets are fussy and  
distracting. Willy's life is contracting, closing in on him. These 
swirling sets convey nothing of the man's entrapment. 
</P>
<P>
	By now, ``Death of a Salesman'' has attained such a rarefied  
position in American dramatic literature that its status as a 
classic may have intimidated Dennehy. Yet the power and the poetry 
of Miller's crowning achievement still come through. An imperfect 
revival then, but one that still packs a punch, particularly when 
Franz's Linda proclaims the importance of the salesman she has 
married.

<HEADLINE> Monte Carlos To Pace Indy Field </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Chevrolet Monte Carlos will pace both the  
Indianapolis 500 and the NASCAR Coca Cola 600 at Concord, N.C., on 
May 30, the first time the same model car has served as pace car 
for two major races on the same day. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2000 Monte Carlo production model, as well as race and pace  
car versions, will be introduced Thursday at the Chicago Auto Show 
by the Chevrolet Division of General Motors. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be the 12th time a Chevrolet has paced the Indianapolis  
500, but the first time for a Monte Carlo. A Corvette pace car has 
been used four times, including 1995 and 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The driver of the 1999 Indy pace car has not been announced.  
Golfer Greg Norman was to have driven the pace car last year but 
was unable to steer because of recent arthroscopic surgery on his 
shoulder and was replaced by former Indy winner Parnelli Jones.

<HEADLINE> Defense Awards $3 Billion Space Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Air Force and the Pentagon's ballistic  
missile defense shop announced Tuesday award of the first portion 
of a $3 billion contract to research whether space-based lasers can 
shoot down long-range enemy missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense officials were careful to say the program doesn't  
violate the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty the United States has 
with Russia, which bars development of a national space-based 
missile defense system. Instead, the project will simply test 
technologies, U.S. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not Star Wars,'' said Gloria Cales, an Air Force  
spokeswoman, in a reference to former President Reagan's failed 
effort to develop such a space-based system. ``This is just the 
beginning stage of an experiment to see if space-based lasers would 
work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force program is just one of several missile defense  
research projects the Pentagon has approved, although the U.S. 
administration won't decide for another couple of years whether to 
fully develop and deploy such a system -- if scientists can get one 
to work. If a deployment decision is made, U.S. officials have 
acknowledged, the ABM treaty would need to be renegotiated. 
</P>
<P>
	When President Clinton first took office in 1993, his  
administration declared ``the end of the Star Wars era.'' Recent 
missile development by nations such as North Korea and Iran, 
however, placed fresh emphasis on the threat posed to America by 
long-range nuclear missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, Clinton sent a budget to Congress asking for $6.6  
billion over the next five years towards developing a national 
defense against missile attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans in Congress have long argued for a national missile  
defense system. 
</P>
<P>
	An industry group led by The Boeing Co., headquartered in  
Seattle, won the first $125 million installment of the $3 billion 
research contract with the Air Force and the Ballistic Missile 
Defense Organization. The two other companies on the contract team 
are Lockheed Martin Missiles and Space of Sunnyvale, Calif. and 
TRW, Inc., of Redondo Beach, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	The initial work is scheduled to be completed in 18 months to  
two years at the Air Force's Space and Missile Systems Center in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	The objective is to research the feasibility of a space-based  
laser system, develop ground, flight and space technologies and 
then conduct a demonstration, the Air Force said.

<HEADLINE> Kaczynski Seeks New Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) -- Unabomber Theodore J. Kaczynski believes  
he was unfairly coerced into pleading guilty and has hired a new 
lawyer to help him win a second trial, a Vermont law professor said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	A new trial could lead to the death penalty for the  
anti-technology terrorist, who has been in a federal prison in 
Florence, Colo., since he was sentenced to life without parole last 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very important to me that Ted have a choice, the  
meaningful choice of going back to court,'' said Vermont Law School 
Professor Michael Mello, who has exchanged about 130 letters with 
Kaczynski since July. 
</P>
<P>
	Mello said he is trying to talk Kaczynski out of filing a motion  
for a new trial because of the risk of the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaczynski's guilty plea cut short his trial in Sacramento,  
Calif. He capitulated after his lawyers attempted against his 
wishes to portray him as mentally ill and the judge refused to let 
him represent himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plea bargain, the government withdrew its demand for  
the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaczynski began writing to Mello after the professor published  
articles critical of the defense lawyers. Mello contends that 
Kaczynski's guilty plea was involuntary, that he was coerced by his 
lawyers and that the judge was wrong in not letting Kaczynski 
represent himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaczynski asked Mello's help in finding a new lawyer, and  
Richard Bonnie of the University of Virginia law school recently 
agreed to take the case, said Mello, who is writing a book about 
the Unabomber trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's one of the leading national experts on law and  
psychiatry,'' Mello said. 
</P>
<P>
	Quin Denvir, Kaczynski's attorney at the trial, and Bonnie  
declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The correspondence between the Kaczynski and Mello is described  
in the National Law Journal this month.

<HEADLINE> Questions Remain Over Tyson Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Mike Tyson has always been a rough fighter, but not an  
especially dirty one until the night of June 28, 1997, when he 
committed an act that opened the final chapter of his boxing 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	How long the chapter runs, or if it already has been concluded,  
remains to be seen, but there is no doubt that when he bit a chunk 
out of Evander Holyfield's right ear, the image of ``the baddest 
man on the planet'' changed for good. 
</P>
<P>
	Baddest men don't bite. They don't assault 50 and 63-year-old  
men either. That's what Tyson has been sentenced to a year in jail 
for doing after a traffic accident at Gaithersburg, Md., last Aug. 
31. 
</P>
<P>
	There are people who argue that the sentence was too severe, but  
there is no arguing that it was just another incident of Tyson 
reacting adversely to a situation. Such reactions can get you 
disqualified in boxing. They can get you jailed outside the ring. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm Mike, and Mike is going to be Mike,'' Tyson told a bunch  
of boxing writers a few days before his fifth-round knockout of 
Francois Botha Jan. 16, his only fight since the Bite Fight. 
</P>
<P>
	There seems to be a Mike who feels the world is against him, Yet  
he also seems to feel it's a weakness not to act defiant. He can't 
seem to, or doesn't want to, shuck the baddest man image he built 
and which those involved in the selling of the Mike Tyson have 
cultivated. 
</P>
<P>
	The sentence in Maryland was imposed last Friday on Tyson, who  
pleaded no-contest to two misdemeanor assault charges, and his 
attorneys have 30 days to decide whether to appeal. An appeal could 
lead to a jury trial and an even longer jail term. There also is 
the matter of what an Indiana judge will do in the matter of 
Tyson's parole on a rape conviction for which he served three 
years. His parole is due to end in March. 
</P>
<P>
	The Maryland incident happened while Tyson was still seeking to  
get back his boxing license, revoked by the Nevada State Athletic 
Commission for biting both of Holyfield's ears. The first bite was 
the one that ripped a piece out of Holyfield's right ear. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson, who reportedly has a four-fight, $33 million television  
deal with Showtime, which also has paid his $14 million tax bill, 
was scheduled to fight April 24 in the second of a four-bout deal 
with the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	That fight remains possible, but it's iffy.  
</P>
<P>
	One question that has been answered is that Tyson, who will be  
33 on June 30, is a long way from being the fighter who was the 
most feared in the world from 1986 to 1990. His speed and movement 
have been slowed by inactivity (seven fights in about 7 years, 7 
months). 
</P>
<P>
	Even before his shocking upset by James ``Buster'' Douglas in  
1990, out-of-the-ring distractions were hurting Tyson as a fighter. 
The knockout loss to Holyfield in 1996 stripped from him the cloak 
of invincibility that Douglas had badly torn. Intimidation can 
still be Tyson's weapon in some cases, but it's been badly watered 
down, as shown by Botha, who was taunting Iron Mike before he got 
careless and got nailed. 
</P>
<P>
	Another question is if Tyson fights again, can he be, and for  
how, long a a major attraction? Are people getting tired of his 
soapbox life in a society filled with real-life soapbox dramas.

<HEADLINE> Chicago Auto Show Unveils New Models </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Toyota Motor Corp. showed off its challenge to  
Mazda's Miata and the expected revival of Nissan's Z-car on 
Wednesday: the MR-Spyder, a mid-engine, open-air roadster that will 
go on sale in the United States in early 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	It will replace the MR2, a hardtop sports car that remains on  
sale in Japan but was removed from the North American market in 
1995 because of slow sales. Toyota unveiled a concept version of 
the new car at the Chicago Auto Show's media preview. 
</P>
<P>
	Other new models unveiled Wednesday include the redesigned 2000  
Pontiac Bonneville sedan, Nissan's redesigned Maxima sedan, and a 
convertible version of Toyota's Camry Solara coupe. 
</P>
<P>
	Donald Esmond, a vice president of Toyota Motor Sales USA Inc.,  
said the rear-drive MR-Spyder would be priced to compete against 
the Miata in the lower end of the sports car market, which means 
$20,000 to $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the same price range Nissan Motor Co. is considering for  
the revival of its Z-car, expected to go into production in the 
next few years. 
</P>
<P>
	The sports car market has grown increasingly crowded in the past  
decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Mazda marked the 10th anniversary of its popular roadster by  
unveiling a limited edition model at the Chicago show, where the 
original debuted in 1989. The car features special trim and a 
special six-speed manual transmission in place of the standard 
five-speed version. 
</P>
<P>
	The MR-Spyder borrows some styling from its higher-priced  
competition: the bulbous fender flares look like they came off the 
new Audi TT, while the rear-end design looks a lot like the Porsche 
Boxster's, complete with big air scoops to cool the engine that 
rests behind the seats. 
</P>
<P>
	The car will be built in Japan, but Esmond would not say when it  
might go on sale there or in Europe. Toyota said the production 
version will be very close to the concept car. 
</P>
<P>
	The MR-Spyder will be powered by a new 1.8-liter, twin-cam,  
four-cylinder engine rated at 140 horsepower. It also features an 
unusual five-speed manual transmission that does not use a clutch. 
The driver can either shift using a conventional center console 
shifter, or by pressing buttons on either side of the steering 
wheel. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota also showed off its convertible Solara, which will go on  
sale in spring 2000. The convertible is aimed at buyers who desire 
a sports car but need the room and comfort of a larger car. It will 
be offered with a choice of four-cylinder or V6 engines, a standard 
four-speed automatic transmission, a power folding top and a glass 
rear window. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota expects to sell only 6,000 convertibles a year. The coupe  
went on sale last fall and Toyota plans to sell 50,000 this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan said its larger, more luxurious 2000 Maxima sedan will go  
on sale in June. The car comes with a more powerful 3-liter V6, and 
more distinctive front- and rear-end treatments than the current 
generation Maxima. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Seergy, a Nissan vice president, said the car will be  
priced in the same lower to mid-$20,000 price range as the current 
model. He said Nissan expects to sell 110,000 Maximas a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan also displayed a wild show car that executives openly  
called a ``polarizing design.'' The NCS, for ``new concept sedan,'' 
is intended to offer the room and storage space of a minivan in a 
sedan-like package. 
</P>
<P>
	With its high roof and sweeping side window line, the NCS looks  
like a cross between a station wagon and a hatchback car. Jerry 
Hirshberg, who heads Nissan's California design studio, said that 
with the seats folded flat, two adults could sleep comfortably in 
the NCS. 
</P>
<P>
	Seergy said the NCS will be basis for a production model in the  
next two to three years. Like other major automakers, Nissan is 
hoping to create a hybrid car that combines attributes of a sport 
utility vehicle and minivan with the driveability and comfort of a 
sedan. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pontiac division of General Motors Corp. unveiled its  
redesigned flagship sedan, the Bonneville, which executives 
described as a sporty luxury car ``with attitude.'' It shares the 
chassis and major mechanical underpinnings with Chevrolet's 2000 
Impala. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Bonneville has Pontiac's styling trademarks, including  
``cat's eye'' headlights and sculpted ``gills'' to give it a more 
aggressive look. The car will come standard with a V6 engine that 
can be upgraded with a supercharger that boosts power to 240 
horsepower from 205. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bonneville is aimed at baby boomer families who ``want a car  
that helps them look and feel young,'' said Mary Boland, Pontiac 
brand manager.

<HEADLINE>  U.S., S.Africa Plan for Closer Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) -- The United States and South  
Africa laid a foundation today for closer military relations, and 
South Africa's defense chief welcomed a token U.S. contribution of 
airlift support for a multinational African peacekeeping exercise. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen and his South African  
counterpart, Defense Minister Joe Modise, approved the content of 
draft diplomatic papers that are intended to set a legal framework 
for U.S. military activities in South Africa, starting with the 
peacekeeping exercise in April. 
</P>
<P>
	A formal exchange of the diplomatic notes later will enable two  
U.S. Air Force C-130 transport crews to fly troops from several 
sub-Saharan African countries to South Africa for the April 
exercise, dubbed Blue Crane, involving about 4,000 African troops. 
Besides the C-130 crews, the only other direct U.S. participation 
will be several officers acting as advisers, said Rear Adm. Koos 
Louw, director of foreign relations at the South African Defense 
Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
	The legal documents, once formally in place, will provide the  
basis for all future U.S. military activities in South Africa, Louw 
said. The Blue Crane exercise will mark the first time American 
troops have operated in South Africa, although it will be only a 
token presence. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one year ago the U.S. government ended its ban on arms  
trade with the South African government after the Justice 
Department settled legal claims for violations of U.S. export laws. 
</P>
<P>
	At a ceremony in the 17th century Castle of Good Hope that is  
headquarters of the Western Province Command of South Africa's 
Army, Cohen and Modise signed an agreement to exchange information 
on military environmental issues such as cmeaning up surplus 
military bases, disarming conventional munitions and environmental 
management of military live-fire ranges. 
</P>
<P>
	``It shows that the progress we are making in our relationship,  
indeed, is more than verbal, it is now committed to deeds as 
well,'' Cohen said. Later he added, ``From my meetings here it is 
clear that our militaries will have many opportunities to advance 
our mutual goals to help make Africa a continent of peace and 
prosperity in the 21st century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mobise thanked Cohen for U.S. willingness to share its expertise  
in peacekeeping. He said in response to a question, however, that 
the South African government is not yet ready to participate in a 
U.S. program of peacekeeper training that is being offered to many 
African nations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new spirit of cooperation between our two countries, and  
in particular between our two departments of defense, manifests 
itself in your visit to South Africa,'' Modise said. Although 
Modise did not say so, Cohen is the first American secretary of 
defense ever to visit South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen said that in their discussions today Modise raised the  
issue of civil war in Angola and Congo. 
</P>
<P>
	``He outlined the dimensions of the problem,'' Cohen said. ``We  
both agree, I believe, that diplomacy is really the only solution, 
that there are no military solutions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen also was meeting today with members of Parliament and  
community leaders. He also was to call on Deputy President Thabo 
Mbeki, the heir apparent to President Nelson Mandela.

<HEADLINE> Bill Would Boost Census Accuracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Welfare recipients would be able to hold  
temporary census jobs without fear of losing government benefits 
under legislation introduced Wednesday by two Florida lawmakers who 
don't find themselves on the same side of an issue very often. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Carrie Meek, a Democrat, and Republican Rep. Dan Miller,  
chairman of the House panel on the census, said the bill is aimed 
at getting a more accurate count for the 2000 census. 
</P>
<P>
	During previous counts, census takers have missed significant  
numbers of people living in poor minority and immigrant 
neighborhoods. The 1990 census missed an estimated 1.4 percent of 
the population. 
</P>
<P>
	Research has shown that accuracy is increased when members of  
those communities help in counting, Miller and Meek said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to make sure to do our very best to count each head,''  
Meek said. ``We know the key to getting an accurate count is to 
count the people who have been undercounted in the past. ... We 
need to have as much local involvement as we can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under current laws, additional income earned by participants of  
various welfare programs can put them at risk of losing government 
benefits, including health care and food stamps. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller said he expects little opposition to the idea, except  
possibly from members of Congress who object to the federal 
government getting involved in decisions that usually are left to 
state officials. A welfare overhaul passed in 1996 gave states the 
option of removing restrictions on recipients of public assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking at this as a constitutional issue,'' Miller said.  
``We have to do the census. ... If it will help get us a better 
census, then it's worth pushing for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Constitution requires the government to count every U.S.  
resident every 10th year, and the resulting numbers determine how 
many seats each state will have in the House and how to divide 
about $182 billion a year in federal aid among cities and states. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller headed the Republicans' successful fight against using  
statistical sampling during next year's census, and Meek was among 
Democrats who supported sampling. The counting system has been in 
political dispute because the people and areas most likely to be 
undercounted involve those who tend to vote Democratic. The use of 
sampling to add them could put Republicans at a disadvantage in 
elections after 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court ruled in favor of a lawsuit to prevent the use  
of sampling in 2000 for apportionment of representatives filed by 
the Atlanta-based Southeastern Legal Foundation, a conservative 
public interest law firm. But the court did not rule on whether the 
device can be used for other reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala said temporary  
census jobs would give welfare recipients work experience.

<HEADLINE> Grounded Oregon Ship To Be Burned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COOS BAY, Ore. (AP) -- Navy explosives experts boarded a grounded  
cargo ship Wednesday in a race to set fire to the vessel before an 
approaching storm breaks it up and causes a disastrous oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities decided to burn the ship rather than try to save it,  
concluding it was the only way to spare Oregon beaches from the 
heavy, tarlike bunker fuel remaining inside the New Carissa. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are significantly concerned the ship will not stay  
together,'' said Coast Guard Capt. Mike Hall. ``We're between a 
rock and a hard spot. If we don't do something now we would have to 
stand before you and tell you why we let 400,000 gallons of oil 
spill on our beaches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Already, cracks in the hull of the 639-foot ship have leaked oil  
over miles of coastline. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to set fire to the ship was made after it became  
clear salvage crews could not budge the vessel free before a storm 
that was expected to slam the coast late Wednesday with 70 mph 
winds. 
</P>
<P>
	Explosives experts were flown by helicopter to the deck of the  
ship to prepare it for an afternoon burning. Plans called for 
removing huge cargo hatches on the deck and using small explosive 
charges to crack open the fuel tanks, allowing the fuel to flow 
into the cargo holds and burn more freely. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire was to be ignited with buckets of gasoline and  
incendiary grenades detonated by remote control. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the best show in town,'' said Danny Martin, a  
longshoreman who was part of a growing crowd that gathered on the 
shoreline bluffs to watch. 
</P>
<P>
	It could take a couple of days to burn off the fuel. Afterward  
the charred steel hull will be hauled to the beach, cut up and 
removed. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said such burns have been conducted safely in Alaska  
and other parts of the world. 
</P>
<P>
	The ship, owned by a Japanese company and registered in Panama  
with a crew of 23 Filipinos, ran aground Thursday morning 150 yards 
offshore. It was coming into port to pick up a load of wood chips. 
</P>
<P>
	Pounding surf opened up cracks in its steel hull Monday, and  
three of the ship's five fuel tanks, containing 140,000 gallons, 
ruptured, causing streaking oil along six miles of beach. 
</P>
<P>
	The ship is aground in an area known as the Leberti Hole,  
considered a prime crab-fishing area. It is near an area where the 
Western snowy plover, a threatened shorebird, lives. 
</P>
<P>
	About 200 people mobilized along the southern Oregon Coast to  
clean up the goo. Several birds have been found coated with fuel.

<HEADLINE> Proposal Targets Disability Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It would be easier for the government to catch  
and punish people who collect disability payments they aren't 
entitled to under legislation endorsed by a House panel Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation, agreed unanimously by Democrats and Republicans  
on the House Ways and Means human resources subcommittee, would 
tighten some rules for Supplemental Security Income, or SSI, 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	It would not make the definition of a disabled person any  
stricter, an idea Republican lawmakers floated previously. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is the right balance between preventing fraud and  
maintaining a strong safety net for those in need,'' said Rep. 
Benjamin Cardin, D-Md. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers estimate the new rules, which have the Clinton  
administration's approval and are expected to sail through the full 
committee and onto the House floor, could save up to $100 million 
over five years. The Senate is discussing similar legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the rules:  
</P>
<P>
	--People who give away their financial resources within three  
years of applying for SSI in order to meet poverty requirements 
would have to accept reduced benefits during a penalty period. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Social Security administration could alert credit bureaus,  
hire collection agencies and intercept other state and federal 
benefit checks to recover SSI overpayments. 
</P>
<P>
	--Doctors or lawyers who misrepresent circumstances of a person  
applying for benefits could be barred from further involvement with 
the program. 
</P>
<P>
	--People who receive checks unlawfully while in prison would have  
to repay the government or be barred from SSI for 10 years after 
they're free. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the legislation would cut by 25 percent the  
benefits that can be collected by one subset of people: Filipino 
veterans of the U.S. armed forces in World War II who have moved 
back to the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
	Usually, the benefits cannot be received abroad, but some  
Filipino veterans who've returned home have petitioned Congress to 
keep them. 
</P>
<P>
	SSI provides extra financial help to 6.6 million elderly, blind  
or disabled Americans with low incomes. Although administered by 
the Social Security Administration, it is separate from Social 
Security disability and retirement benefits, which are paid for 
with payroll taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, the General Accounting Office declared SSI at high risk  
for waste and fraud after finding hundreds of million of dollars a 
year were going to people who aren't eligible either as a result of 
criminal schemes or inaccurate government records.

<HEADLINE> Norwegians Favored in Giant Slalom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VAIL, Colo. (AP) -- Powerful Austria slipped up by letting Norway  
finish 1-2 in the men's combined competition. Now the duo of Kjetil 
Andre Aamodt and Lasse Kjus is hungry for more. 
</P>
<P>
	Aamodt, winner of the combined and bronze medalist in the  
downhill, and Kjus, co-winner of the super-G and silver medalist in 
the super-G and combined, are among the favorites for Friday's 
men's giant slalom in the World Alpine Ski Championships. They'll 
also challenge in Sunday's windup event, the men's slalom. 
</P>
<P>
	After an off day Wednesday, today's women's GS marked the  
opening of the technical portion of the two-week championships, 
after completion of the downhills, super-Gs and combined. 
</P>
<P>
	Austria's Alexandra Meissnitzer, with three victories in six  
races this season, was the favorite, although resurgent teammate 
Anita Wachter (two wins), Norway's Andrine Flemmen, Germany's 
Martina Ertl and Italy's Olympic champion, Deborah Compagnoni, 
loomed as threats. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think GS is the most competitive discipline, with so many  
good skiers -- Hermann Maier, Michael Von Gruenigen, Benjamin Raich, 
Lasse Kjus and Paul Accola,'' Aamodt said. ``I think in every race 
there was a new winner until the last race in Adelboden, when Maier 
won for the second time. 
</P>
<P>
	``So the field is very strong.''  
</P>
<P>
	Maier would appear to be the biggest threat, since he's the  
defending World Cup GS champion and is on a roll in the World 
Championships, sharing gold with Kjus in the super-G and winning 
the downhill. 
</P>
<P>
	Switzerland's Von Gruenigen, Austrian rookie Raich, Austria's  
Stephan Eberharter and Italy's Patrick Holzer have also won GS 
races this season. Aamodt, seeking a record 14th Olympic and World 
Championships medal, has been in the top four three times in six 
races. 
</P>
<P>
	He's also got a winning record on this GS course, coming from  
far back in the second run to win the 1994 gold on the way to the 
World Cup overall title. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like this course. I just have to be really aggressive,''  
Aamodt said, then added with a mischievous twinkle in his eye, 
``and not drink too much beer the night before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kjus has yet to crack the top five in a World Cup GS this  
season, but that is more a product of bad health than bad racing. 
Kjus, the 1996 overall champion, has been bothered by a chest cold 
and respiratory problems, although he seems in perfect form here 
with three medals (a gold and two silvers) in three events. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is starting to be fun now,'' Kjus said. ``I'm really  
looking forward to the next race. Every medal gives me more 
energy.''

<HEADLINE> Deutsche Bank Expects OK for Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Deutsche Bank chairman Rolf Breuer  
said Wednesday that he expects the bank's planned takeover of 
U.S.-based Bankers Trust will be approved this year, despite 
lawsuits by Holocaust victims. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no signal that anyone will interfere with our  
application process,'' Breuer told reporters at a conference on 
mergers. 
</P>
<P>
	Breuer just returned from Washington, D.C., where he joined  
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's chief of staff in talks with Jewish 
groups, Israeli government representatives and groups representing 
Holocaust survivors on settling outstanding Holocaust and slave 
labor claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Bank is one of many German companies facing  
class-action suits in the United States filed by Holocaust 
survivors, accusing them of profiting from slave labor or the Nazi 
expropriation of Jewish assets. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuits could delay regulatory approval of Deutsche Bank's  
planned $10.1 billion takeover of Banker's Trust. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Breuer said Wednesday that talks under way to settle  
claims by Holocaust victims shouldn't interfere with the takeover, 
although he said that delays in those talks beyond the end of this 
year could pose a problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Breuer said the question of how much German companies would  
contribute to a possible umbrella fund for the victims wasn't 
discussed during this week's talks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We never spoke about money, not even behind closed doors ...  
or between the German parties,'' Breuer said. ``First we must agree 
on a structure for resolving the claims.''

<HEADLINE> Voter Turnout Lowest Since 1942 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Voter turnout in midterm elections last  
November dropped to the lowest rate in more than 50 years and 
political parties continued to lose their grip on voters, according 
to final turnout figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Turnout fell to 36.06 percent of eligible voters, or 72,450,901  
people, the lowest rate since 1942, elections analyst Curtis Gans 
said Tuesday. There was a net increase of 5.5 million Americans 
registered to vote, largely because of changes made by the National 
Voter Registration Act, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The continuing decline in turnout is the central story in my  
view,'' he said, noting that the political parties continue to lose 
strength and more people are registering as independents. 
</P>
<P>
	Gans said voters showed a distaste for highly partisan, negative  
campaigns for senator in New York, in which Democrat Charles 
Schumer defeated incumbent Republican Al D'Amato, and for governor 
in Ohio, where Republican Bob Taft defeated Democrat Lee Fisher. 
</P>
<P>
	``You had two very close, very expensive and very nasty races  
and both of them had lower turnout than the race for governor in 
New York and the race for Senate in Ohio, which were less 
expensive, more genteel and had higher turnout,'' said Gans. 
</P>
<P>
	Gans said the final turnout figure of 36.06 percent in the  
report by his Committee for the Study of the American Electorate 
was lower than the 38 percent reported on the networks on Election 
Night, which came from the Voter News Service. VNS is a partnership 
of the ABC, CBS, CNN, NBC and Fox television networks and The 
Associated Press. Gans said he was concerned those reports didn't 
adequately communicate the continued decline in voter turnout. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our estimates on election night are rough estimates and we  
tell our members to report them as such,'' said Murray Edelman, 
editorial director of VNS. ``We correctly reported that it was a 
low turnout. The alternative is to not report the turnout until a 
day or two after election.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Edelman noted that VNS' role is to provide the best estimate  
available of what's going on in the elections ``in a timely 
manner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other than the dropping rate of voter participation, one of the  
more significant stories in the final figures was the continuing 
decline in registration by political party. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic registration fell to an estimated 29.5 percent of the  
eligible electorate in the District of Columbia and 24 states that 
have registration by party, a figure that has been dropping 
steadily since the 1960s. Republican registration was at 22 percent 
of eligible voters, also a lower percentage than in past years. 
</P>
<P>
	Registration for independent or third-party voters has climbed  
to 13 percent.

<HEADLINE> McCarver To Join Yankees' Broadcast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Less than two weeks after being fired by the New  
York Mets, Tim McCarver will be brought on board by the crosstown 
Yankees on Tuesday, a source at Fox Sports told the Associated 
Press. 
</P>
<P>
	McCarver, who has 10 Emmy nominations, was fired by the Mets  
after 16 years as the team's analyst and replaced by Tom Seaver, 
who won three Cy Young Awards with the team. 
</P>
<P>
	WNYW general manager Mike Wach expressed interest in McCarver as  
soon as he was dismissed by the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	Sources said negotiations began once Yankees owner George  
Steinbrenner approved the hiring. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are still contractual agreements to be worked out,''  
Wach said on Wednesday. ``The parties involved are all in agreement 
in principle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement was scheduled for Tuesday so that Steinbrenner  
may be able to attend. He is scheduled to be in New York for Monday 
night's ESPY Awards. 
</P>
<P>
	McCarver's agent, Bob Rosen, spoke with Wach on Wednesday and  
said he is ``optimistic the deal will be done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``No deal has been made yet, but it'll certainly have to be made  
by Tuesday. ... The next round of discussions are with Tim.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because he is also the lead baseball analyst for Fox's national  
broadcasts, McCarver will miss about eight out of 50 games for 
WNYW, the Fox affiliate that will televise Yankees games this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	McCarver's partner is expected to be former Yankees outfielder  
Bobby Murcer. Wach hopes to introduce Murcer along with McCarver on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets acknowledge they had heard complaints within the  
organization that McCarver was too critical of the team. But 
executives said they got rid of him only to make room for Seaver.

<HEADLINE> Utah Drops Deregulation Effort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Responding to allegations US West dangled  
a $5 million Olympic contribution for favorable treatment, Gov. 
Mike Leavitt abandoned his sweeping deregulation initiative 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``If that's what they (US West) were trying to do, it didn't  
work,'' an angry Leavitt told The Associated Press. ``We have 
withdrawn the bill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He had been trying to get US West and its rivals to agree on  
legislation that would wire Utah for universal and rapid Internet 
access and set the stage for other telecommunications advances to 
showcase a ``Digital Utah'' for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a move that stunned US West and its critics, Leavitt said  
he was dropping his effort for this year. 
</P>
<P>
	On Jan. 18, two days after US West announced it was resuming  
sponsorship of Salt Lake's troubled Olympics, the governor 
introduced his vision of deregulation in his annual 
state-of-the-state address. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer groups claim Leavitt has been working off a draft of  
legislation that could have been written by the Denver-based 
telecommunications giant. The critics also alleged US West last 
month mixed Olympic contributions and politics to try to get its 
way. Their criticism was most recently voiced in Wednesday's 
Washington Post. 
</P>
<P>
	``The governor feels burned by the accusation he was succumbing  
to pressure from US West to put up some deregulation bill,'' said 
Jeff Fox, a former Utah lawmaker and lobbyist on utility issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox said Leavitt's proposals, circulated as recently as Tuesday,  
drew an unenthusiastic response from virtually every player in 
telecommunications -- except US West. 
</P>
<P>
	Other consumer advocates said Leavitt didn't begin pushing his  
proposals until after US West, which had been withholding a $5 
million contribution from Olympic organizers, finally announced 
Jan. 16 it was releasing the money. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sequence of events didn't look good,'' said John Flynn, a  
law professor at the University of Utah and consumer advocate on 
deregulation matters. ``The timing of it all looked strange for the 
governor to be introducing a bill this late in the legislative 
session.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Leavitt said, he hadn't submitted a bill but was  
working toward drafting one. The governor said he invited US West 
and its rivals to meetings Jan. 27 and Feb. 5 in his boardroom that 
yielded no consensus. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just trying to find a way to further competition in the  
state, and it became clear to me that it wasn't going to happen 
this year,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Within an hour of his remarks, the governor's spokeswoman, Vicki  
Varela, sought to clarify that Leavitt was likely to offer 
something less than a ``substantive'' deregulation bill this 
legislation session, which ends March 3. 
</P>
<P>
	Varela also stressed that Leavitt was not abandoning his  
intention to have a ``Digital Utah'' ready in time for the 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	US West, meanwhile, ``completely rejects'' the accusation it  
tried to get a deal on deregulation in return for its crucial 
support of the 2002 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	US West CEO Sol Trujillo and Leavitt have discussed both the  
Olympic contribution and deregulation, ``but in terms of linking 
the two issues, that didn't happen,'' said Ted Smith, Utah vice 
president for the telephone company. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a sponsor we've got three years to go between now and the  
Olympics and, for business reasons, who knows what will happen? But 
it will have nothing to do with legislation from the governor,'' 
Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	US West spokesman Michael Frandsen said the timing of the  
company's pledge and Leavitt's work on deregulation was 
coincidental, nothing more. 
</P>
<P>
	The $5 million contribution is just part of a $50 million US  
West sponsorship deal. The $5 million was due in January, when the 
company was having misgivings about the wide-reaching corruption 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had concerns about the Olympics that were completely  
separate from anything else going on and we weren't the only 
sponsor with those concerns,'' Frandsen said.

<HEADLINE> Suspect Arraigned in Will Thefts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- When the wills of deceased Boston-area baseball  
players were discovered on the sports memorabilia market last year, 
court officials wondered who would steal such historical public 
records. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say it was an inside job.  
</P>
<P>
	Probation officer Joseph Schnabel was arraigned Tuesday on  
larceny charges for allegedly swiping the documents from a vault at 
the Suffolk County Courthouse where he worked. 
</P>
<P>
	But many of the papers remain missing, Suffolk County Register  
of Probate Richard Iannella said. 
</P>
<P>
	``To think that an officer of this court benefited financially  
and at the same time committed grave robbery is unconscionable,'' 
Iannella said. ``A part of Boston history and major league baseball 
history has been stolen and may never be returned home to its 
proper place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a Boston Municipal Court hearing that lasted about a minute,  
an innocent plea was entered on behalf of Schnabel, 55, of 
Pembroke. 
</P>
<P>
	The case involves the theft of court papers bearing the  
signatures of some of baseball's earliest stars. George Wright, 
Hugh Duffy and Tommy McCarthy, all Hall of Famers, played for 
Boston teams in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Gerald Stewart said Schnabel admitted to Boston  
police and FBI agents that he stole two documents in 1996. He told 
investigators that he sold a paper issued on the death of Wright's 
wife for $1,700. 
</P>
<P>
	Also missing was the will of Samuel Wright, George's brother.  
Samuel Wright's will has since been recovered from an Oregon 
memorabilia dealer, Iannella said. 
</P>
<P>
	Iannella realized the records were missing from a vault at the  
Suffolk County Courthouse in October when a document signed in 1913 
by Wright was listed in the catalog of a New York auction house. 
</P>
<P>
	That led to the realization that the will of Wright and his wife  
were missing, along with the wills of McCarthy and Duffy. In fact, 
McCarthy's entire file appeared to have been stolen. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities in other parts of the country then realized their  
vaults had been raided as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Detective Howard Springer of the McLean County, Ill., sheriff's  
department said Schnabel is a suspect in the theft of the will of 
Hall of Famer Charles ``Old Hoss'' Radbourne from a courthouse 
there, but said a decision has not been made about whether to 
charge him. 
</P>
<P>
	'We're waiting to see what happens out in the Boston area with  
the charges,'' Springer said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Radbourne will was returned by a New Jersey banker who paid  
$11,500 for it on the memorabilia market. 
</P>
<P>
	Iannella said the will of another Wright brother, Harry Wright,  
has disappeared from a Philadelphia courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston Police Department spokesman Peter Norton said Schnabel  
admitted to stealing two documents in Massachusetts and selling 
them, and to stealing two documents in other states. 
</P>
<P>
	The players made names for themselves in the early days of  
organized baseball, playing with such clubs as the Providence 
Grays, the Boston Beaneaters and the Boston Red Stockings. 
</P>
<P>
	Schnabel has been a probation officer for about 15 years, said  
Iannella. A probation spokeswoman refused to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Schnabel was released on his own recognizance after arraignment  
on the larceny charge. Neither he nor his lawyer, James McCusker, 
would comment on the case as they hustled from the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Iannella said he doesn't know if the wills of other celebrities  
have also been stolen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I suspect there are more,'' he said. ``We have over a million  
files here and we're trying to do inventory.''

<HEADLINE> Pro Bowling Goes Instant Replay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AKRON, Ohio (AP) -- Upon further review, strike that spare.  
</P>
<P>
	Bowling, of all things, has become the latest sport to go to  
instant replay. 
</P>
<P>
	Professional Bowlers Tour commissioner Mark Gerberich  
implemented the new rule this week following a late foul call last 
weekend against Columbia 300 Open winner Parker Bohn III. 
</P>
<P>
	PBA Tour tournament director Kirk von Krueger, acting on the  
spot, used instant replay Sunday to determine that Bohn fouled and 
gave him zero for his spare attempt in the fourth frame. 
</P>
<P>
	The corrected call on Bohn came midway through the sixth frame  
after it was determined that the foul lights were turned off and 
the line judge did not have a clear view. Instant replay has been 
used in the past on PBA telecasts to determine whether a pinsetter 
caused a pin to fall or if it fell on its own. 
</P>
<P>
	``An opportunity presented itself to correct a potential no-call  
and preserve the integrity of the sport,'' von Krueger said. ``The 
most important thing was to get the call right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the tour's tournament committee recommended the PBA  
``allow instant replay to help in case of questionable calls (on 
PBA telecasts) with notification to the player and decision 
rendered before the next shot is thrown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the foul, Bohn won his 18th career title.  
</P>
<P>
	``If I did foul, I'm willing to accept my foul and go on,'' Bohn  
said. ``But it should have been called immediately.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rule will be reviewed by the PBA Tour's board of directors  
at its meeting in May.

	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- The Carolina Panthers cleared about $3.1  
million in salary cap room Wednesday by cutting two original 
franchise members, linebacker Lamar Lathon and nose tackle Mike 
Fox. 
</P>
<P>
	The releases of Lathon and Fox were two of several moves new  
coach George Seifert announced two days before the NFL's 
free-agency signing period opens. Seifert said the Panthers also 
extended kicker John Kasay's contract through the 2003 season and 
agreed to terms on a new three-year contract with offensive guard 
Anthony Redmon. 
</P>
<P>
	Carolina also signed three players to training-camp contracts:  
linebackers Steven Conley and Sam Manuel and defensive tackle Harry 
Deligianis. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Seifert said the Panthers would not put a franchise  
designation on offensive tackle Blake Brockermeyer, a label that 
would have restricted him from signing with other teams when free 
agency opens Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Seifert said the Panthers were talking with Brockermeyer and his  
agent about negotiating a new contract to keep the 1995 first-round 
draft choice with Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would like to have him on the team,'' Seifert said. ``We  
believe this is the best way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seifert offered a similar assessment about his decision to cut  
Lathon and Fox, saying he hoped both might be able to rejoin the 
team at a later date. But Seifert said that with free agency 
approaching, Carolina felt it best to cut the players, thereby 
saving about $1.7 million in salary cap room for Lathon and about 
$1.4 million for Fox. 
</P>
<P>
	Lathon, a nine-year NFL veteran who was entering the final  
season of a five-year, $13.5 million contract, spent 1998 on 
injured reserve as he battled worsening knee problems. He underwent 
four knee operations last year alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox, another nine-year veteran who was entering the final season  
of a five-year, $9 million contract, lost his starting job early 
last season and wound up with 32 tackles and one sack. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasay, an eight-year veteran, made 19 of 26 field-goal attempts  
this past season, including a career-high four of 50 yards or more. 
</P>
<P>
	Combined with losing Tarek Saleh in the expansion draft, the  
Panthers have freed up about $3.5 million this week in salary cap 
room.

<HEADLINE> NCAA Urges Ban on Internet Wagering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (AP) -- The NCAA urged a national commission  
studying gambling to push for a federal ban on wagering over the 
Internet to protect the integrity of college sports. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Gambling Impact Study Commission is preparing a  
report due in June to the president and Congress. It invited groups 
to attend its meeting this week at Regent University and suggest 
what should be included in the report. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet gambling could tempt college athletes to shave points,  
said Bill Saum, the NCAA's director of agent and gambling 
activities. Students who place bets anonymously over the Internet 
from the privacy of their dormitories could try to influence the 
outcome of a game, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Internet gambling poses a direct threat to all sports  
organizations,'' Saum told the commissioners Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal law banning Internet gambling while the industry is  
still in its infancy would be a strong deterrent, Saum said. 
</P>
<P>
	But a trade group representing about 50 companies interested in  
Internet betting argued that prohibition didn't work for alcohol 
and it won't work for Internet gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	``People like to gamble,'' said Albe Angel, vice chairman of the  
Interactive Gaming Council. He proposed the study commission 
instead recommend regulations, such as licensing Internet gambling 
sites, with states enforcing the regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Regulation is far preferable to prohibition as a model for  
controlling interactive gambling, particularly over the Internet,'' 
Angel said. He noted 25 other countries already have approved some 
form of interactive gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	An Internet subcommittee of the commission voted 3-0 to  
recommend a ban, saying it's necessary to protect children from 
exposure to gambling while surfing the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you feel strongly about keeping betting out of the home, I  
think this is the course that we're going to have to have to try to 
follow,'' subcommittee member Leo T. McCarthy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several commissioners agreed but wondered whether a ban could be  
enforced. Subcommittee chairman William A. Bible said the 
subcommittee will need to meet further to discuss enforcement and 
possible exemptions to a ban. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department has estimated $600 million was bet  
illegally over the Internet on sports in 1997, a tenfold increase 
over 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Last July, the U.S. Senate voted to ban Internet gambling,  
including the pay-to-play casino-style games offered by dozens of 
sites on the World Wide Web. Most are operated by businesses based 
overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar legislation got bogged down in the House, where  
Internet-related businesses were seeking exemptions. The bill never 
got out of subcommittee.

 *Celebrity Spotlight &AMP; Birthdays    	
</P>
<P>
	In the spotlight: Yoko Ono  
</P>
<P>
	 *Image:* Artist, businesswoman, rock singer, political activist,  
grieving widow and mother. Yoko Ono has more labels than canned 
goods in a grocery store. 
</P>
<P>
	 *Personal stats:* Ono was born on Feb. 18, 1933, in Tokyo. She  
settled in the United States after World War II. After dropping out 
of Sarah Lawrence College, she immersed herself in New York City's 
burgeoning underground music and art scene. She developed a 
reputation as a respected avant-garde artist long before she met 
Beatle John Lennon. 
</P>
<P>
	 *John and Yoko:* Ono and Lennon met at an art show in London in  
1966. They were married in a ceremony on Gibraltar on March 20, 
1969. Several months later, they staged an eight-day ``bed-in'' at 
a hotel in Montreal, an event undertaken to promote world peace and 
made open to the media. 
</P>
<P>
	``Give Peace a Chance,'' a song recorded at the bed-in, became  
the definitive peace anthem for pacifists worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Lennon's death in December 1980, Ono has been active as an  
artist. Her cathartic solo effort ``Season of Glass'' is her 
best-known album. In 1992, she released ``Onobox,'' a six-CD set of 
her music. 
</P>
<P>
	In November 1997, she filled five galleries at Oxford's Museum  
of Modern Art with 65 works of art representing her nearly 40-year 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yoko is often seen in a wrong context because of her  
relationship with John Lennon rather than the extremely important 
artist she actually is,'' said museum director Kerry Brougher. 
</P>
<P>
	Sean Lennon, who was 5 when his father died, is a musician. He  
played in his mother's band IMA and toured as a member of Cibo 
Mato. His debut album, ``Into the Sun,'' was released last year.

<HEADLINE> Sexual Problems Plague Americans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- For millions of Americans, sex ain't so hot.  
</P>
<P>
	A comprehensive survey found that sexual dysfunction afflicts 43  
percent of women and 31 percent of men, with problems including a 
lack of interest in sex and the inability to have an orgasm. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it gives us a base for explaining why we had this  
enormous response to Viagra,'' said Edward Laumann, a University of 
Chicago sociologist and lead author of the study published in 
today's Journal of the American Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
	As grim as the survey's findings are, the results could offer  
hope to millions, many of whom think they're the only ones having 
trouble in bed, said Laumann, who has been a paid consultant to the 
company that makes Viagra. 
</P>
<P>
	``Often they don't even admit it to their partners. It's the old  
`I've got a headache' instead of `I don't feel like having sex,''' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Laumann and his co-author, Raymond Rosen, had been paid by  
Pfizer Inc. to review clinical trial data on Viagra before the 
impotency drug was submitted for U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
	That association was not mentioned by the journal, but Dr. Phil  
Fontanarosa, a JAMA editor, said today the omission was an 
oversight and would be noted in a subsequent issue. Laumann said he 
had told JAMA editors about the relationship before the study was 
published. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers said problems with sex are often coupled with  
everything from emotional and health problems to lack of time, job 
pressures and money trouble. But they said they aren't sure which 
comes first -- stress or problems with sex. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers based the findings on the 1992 National Health  
and Social Life Survey, a compilation of interviews with 1,749 
women and 1,410 men. 
</P>
<P>
	The participants, ages 18 to 59, were asked if they had  
experienced sexual dysfunction over several months in the previous 
year. Sexual dysfunction was defined as a regular lack of interest 
in or pain during sex or persistent problems achieving lubrication, 
an erection or orgasm. 
</P>
<P>
	Lack of interest was the most common problem for women, with  
about a third saying they regularly didn't want sex. Twenty-six 
percent said they regularly didn't have orgasms and 23 percent said 
sex wasn't pleasurable. 
</P>
<P>
	About a third of men said they had persistent problems with  
climaxing too early, while 14 percent said they had no interest in 
sex and 8 percent said they consistently derived no pleasure from 
sex. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, 43 percent of women and 31 percent of men said they had  
one or more persistent problems with sex. Researchers had expected 
the overall numbers to be closer to maybe 20 percent for each sex. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers said those in the survey who experienced sexual  
dysfunction often were more likely to be unhappy and more likely to 
describe their satisfaction with the partnership as unsatisfactory, 
Laumann said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Domeena Renshaw, a Chicago-area sex therapist, said the  
results are not surprising, considering the long list of couples 
waiting to get into the sexual dysfunction clinic she has run at 
the Loyola University Medical Center since 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	In that time, she has treated nearly 140 couples who had never  
consummated their marriages, including a couple who had been wed 
for 23 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosen, co-director of the Center for Sexual and Marital Health  
at the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in New Brunswick, N.J., 
said the survey provides much-needed information about women, who 
have often been excluded from studies about sexual performance. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the findings are the most comprehensive on sex since Dr.  
Alfred Kinsey did his landmark studies in 1948. Kinsey got similar 
results regarding impotence and failure to achieve orgasm but 
didn't ask about lack of sexual desire. 
</P>
<P>
	Too often, Rosen said, Americans have gotten their information  
about sex from magazines bought at the grocery-store checkout. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a scientist, it makes my hair stand on end,'' Rosen said.  
``It's terrible.''

<HEADLINE> For Some, Y2K Causing Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Year 2000 computer problem is not only  
striking fear in the hearts of computer system operators, Sen. John 
McCain says. It's also bringing up dollar signs in the eyes of 
unscrupulous attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, R-Ariz., has introduced a bill that would limit the  
amount of damages plaintiffs can collect from companies that cause 
business failures or sell products that fail because of the 
problem, also known as the Y2K glitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Some frivolous lawsuits already have been filed, McCain, who is  
chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, told panel members 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``These lawsuits are sheer craziness and represent  
ambulance-chasing at its worst,'' McCain said. ``They are absolute 
confirmation that Y2K litigation is not about consumers, but about 
making wealthy lawyers even wealthier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Houston attorney Howard Nations disagreed, saying most  
responsible businesses are well on their way to having their 
computer systems ready for 2000. The only companies the bill would 
protect would be the ones that have procrastinated. 
</P>
<P>
	``Changing the law which controls the actions of corporate  
leaders within our civil justice system in order to reward the 
irresponsible while denying recovery to the responsible sends the 
wrong message to the business community, the wrong message to the 
public and the wrong message to voters,'' Nations told the 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer programmers are scrambling to avert disasters predicted  
when New Year's Day 2000 arrives. That's when computer systems 
performing calculations involving dates may begin generating 
incorrect data because they recognize only the last two digits of a 
year and will assume that 2000 is 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	Some experts have said the Y2K computer glitch could spark such  
problems as power outages, traffic snarls, paycheck delays and 
disruption of air travel. 
</P>
<P>
	It also is expected to trigger a flood of expensive lawsuits,  
and many of them are likely to be filed by greedy lawyers, said 
McCain. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the bill, which McCain called a ``work in progress'' that  
is open to changes, no punitive damages would be awarded except in 
cases of extreme negligence. Damages not related to economic loss 
would be limited to $250,000 or three times the amount of economic 
loss. Damages unrelated to economic loss for smaller businesses 
would be limited to $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also would require plaintiffs to give defendants a  
chance to correct their mistakes before a lawsuit is filed. 
</P>
<P>
	Businesses that make a good-faith effort to prepare for 2000 or  
fix their mistakes should not be punished for their efforts with 
high punitive damage awards, McCain said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several other members of Congress are working on their own bills  
and a coalition of business leaders has proposed another plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Small businessman Mark Yarsike asked the committee to reject the  
idea, saying a Y2K glitch turned his first day as a gourmet produce 
grocer into a nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
	Happy customers who streamed in and picked out purchases quickly  
became angry after store clerks tried to ring up purchases on the 
store's sparkling new $100,000 high-tech computer system. It 
crashed after clerks tried to process credit cards set to expire in 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``People were waiting with full carts of groceries to pay but  
couldn't,'' he told the committee. ``We could not process a single 
credit card or could not take cash or checks. We could not make one 
sale.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yarsike said that if such a law had been in place during the 2 1/2  
years he struggled with almost daily computer crashes, the company 
that sold him the system never would have settled out of court. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Northwest, Union Agree on Pilot Pay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAGAN, Minn. (AP) -- Northwest Airlines and its pilots have  
reached an agreement on pay for flying Northwest's new Airbus A319 
jets. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders of the Air Line Pilots Association unanimously ratified  
the agreement, under which pilots will receive the same pay for 
flying 319s as they are paid for flying the 63 A320 planes already 
in Northwest's fleet. Northwest in July takes delivery of the first 
of 50 A319 planes on order. 
</P>
<P>
	Both planes have the same cockpit layout and pilots will be  
qualified in both aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	``Negotiations on pay rates and work rules for aircraft types  
can be lengthy and disruptive and so we are pleased to have been 
able to work with ALPA so productively on this issue, said Richard 
Anderson, Northwest executive vice president and chief operating 
officer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest, the nation's fourth-largest airline, has recent  
firsthand experience with contentious negotiations. Pilots for the 
Eagan-based carrier went on strike for 15 days last summer, 
shutting down the airline. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that we were able to expeditiously negotiate this  
issue to a successful conclusion reflects the cooperation and 
partnership we've had with Northwest,'' said Steve Zoller, chairman 
of the union's Master Executive Council.

<HEADLINE> Diesel Pipeline Bursts in Tennessee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- A 10-inch pipeline burst this morning,  
sending 85,000 gallons of diesel fuel spewing onto homes and 
flowing into the Tennessee River. 
</P>
<P>
	No injuries were reported, but 10 homes hit by the fuel were  
condemned, according to the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency. 
Some were already vacant; in the rest, residents were forced to 
move into shelters. 
</P>
<P>
	Vacuum trucks and floating booms were used to contain the fuel  
on the river. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear what time the pipeline, owned by Atlanta-based  
Colonial Pipeline Co., burst or what caused the incident. The 
problem was discovered early today when residents called 
authorities complaining about a strong smell of fuel in the 
neighborhood near the University of Tennessee campus. 
</P>
<P>
	When fire engines arrived on the Tennessee River bank,  
firefighters found fuel spewing about 30 feet in the air and coming 
down on houses. 
</P>
<P>
	The fuel ``went down a hill, through several yards, into a small  
creek, then into the river,'' Colonial spokesman Noel Griese said. 
</P>
<P>
	The pipeline was finally shut down about 4:30 a.m., Griese said.  
</P>
<P>
	He said the fuel was a high-sulfur fuel used by off-road  
vehicles and tractors.

<HEADLINE> Once-Dominating Closer Battles Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Reconstruction of Mark Wohlers is still a  
work in progress. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Atlanta Braves closer, who mysteriously lost the  
ability to throw strikes, stepped atop a bullpen mound at Turner 
Field on Wednesday, ostensibly to take part in a winter 
conditioning camp conducted by pitching coach Leo Mazzone. 
</P>
<P>
	But this was more than just an opportunity for Wohlers to loosen  
up his arm before spring training begins next week. This was part 
of the continuing effort to pick up the pieces of his shattered 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he did great today,'' Mazzone said after Wohlers threw  
about 30 pitches from the mound behind the left-field fence. 
``Mechanically, he executed what he wanted to do about 60 percent 
of the time, which is a big upgrade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But it's still a long way from Wohlers regaining his status as  
one of baseball's most feared pitchers -- the guy who saved 97 games 
over three seasons, plus the clinching game of the 1995 World 
Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Several pitches skipped in the dirt, one bouncing so far in  
front of the plate that it hopped over the backstop and onto the 
field. A few other pitches sailed directly into the backstop, out 
of the catcher's reach. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, Wohlers honed in on his target. It didn't matter than  
many of his pitches would have been balls in a game; at least they 
wound up in the catcher's glove. 
</P>
<P>
	Therefore, this was a good day.  
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to be patient and allow him to get through certain  
things that ... he's trying to square away,'' Mazzone said. ``We're 
trying to keep on plugging to put it back together. What avenue 
that's going to take, I don't really know. 
</P>
<P>
	``At times, it comes out like he wants it to. At times, he's off  
target. But as long as there are times where it comes out like he 
wants to, there's no reason why he can't do it more often.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers seemed relaxed on the mound, smiling after one of his  
wayward pitches and chatting with Mazzone about his mechanics. But 
the pitcher has no desire to talk about his comeback, brushing off 
a reporter's interview request with bitterness in his voice, the 
scars of last season's nightmare still evident. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got nothing to say,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers' sudden meltdown has put him in the company of Steve  
Blass and Mitch Williams -- other pitchers who lost sight of the 
strike zone. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, Wohlers had a 10.18 ERA in Atlanta, with 33 walks  
and seven wild pitches in 20 1-3 innings. He tried to regain his 
form in the minor leagues, but that only made matters worse. At 
Triple-A Richmond, he was 0-3 with a 20.43 ERA, walking 36 and 
throwing 17 wild pitches in 12 1-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to his problems on the field, Wohlers' wife filed  
for divorce and his mother suffered a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be tough for him,'' said Kerry Ligtenberg, who  
took over the closer's role for the Braves. ``There's going to be a 
lot more focus on him this spring to see what happens, to see if he 
can come back. Everybody is going to be watching his performance. 
If he can overcome that and be tough enough to handle that, I think 
he's going to have no problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ligtenberg finds it difficult to relate to Wohlers' woes.  
</P>
<P>
	``There have been times when I'm not able to throw anywhere  
close to the strike zone for one hitter, and that's frustrating in 
itself,'' Ligtenberg said. ``To go out there every day and not know 
what's going to happen, where the ball is going to go, that's got 
to be extremely frustrating and wear on you after a while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers continues to work with Braves psychologist Jack  
Llewellyn, who stood behind the mound during Wednesday's session. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people think it's mechanical and some think it's  
mental,'' Llewellyn said. ``But I don't think you can separate the 
two.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He uses visualization techniques with Wohlers, hoping to locate  
the once-menacing pitcher with the 100 mph fastball. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking for a person who's able to recover quickly from  
adversity,'' Llewellyn said. ``Every pitcher goes through 
adversity. The question is: If he throws a bad pitch, how long does 
it take for him to recover?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers is still searching for the answer.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Little Changed; Dow Up 0.26 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock index were slightly changed at midday as  
market leader technology shares struggled to set a direction. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up  
0.26 at 9,133.29, after swinging narrowly between positive and 
negative in the first hour of trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Broad indexes were higher, with the Nasdaq composite up 24.75 at  
2,335.54, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index up 9.91 at 1,226.05. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors continued to sell Internet stocks in disappointment  
that Lycos didn't get a premium in its three-way deal with USA 
Networks Inc. and TicketMaster Online Citysearch Inc. Lycos' shares 
were down 11 5/16 at 82 15/16, pulling other Internet shares with 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	But unlike Tuesday, when computer shares were sold  
indiscriminantly, the shares of big computer companies were mixed 
today. IBM was up 2 1/4 at 165 on the Big Board. 
</P>
<P>
	In Nasdaq trading, Dell Computer was down 11/16 at 97 1/8, but  
Cisco Systems was up 1 7/8 at 97 13/16, and Microsoft was up 1 7/16 at 
16 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's been some real carnage, especially in the Internet  
world, and who knows where that stops,'' said Arthur Hogan, head 
trader at Jefferies &AMP; Co. in Boston. ``But people are realizing 
that even when you sell your Lycos and your Yahoo!, you don't sell 
your Microsoft, you don't sell your Intel, you don't sell your IBM. 
And so we're seeing some real bargain hunting'' in big technology 
shares. 
</P>
<P>
	A big loser among the Dow industrials was Philip Morris, down 3  
13/16 at 41 9/16. A jury awarded $1.5 million to a California woman 
who sued Philip Morris for negligence, liability and fraud tied to 
her smoking-related cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by 7 to 4 on the New York  
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 322.82 million shares, up from 
Tuesday's pace of 317.48 million.

<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Hours after northern Utah had 115-mph  
winds and record warm temperatures, a powerful storm brought heavy 
snow and knocked out power for thousands. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm, which began Tuesday night, blew over semitrailer  
trucks, caused cars to slide off roads and closed canyon highways. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Salt Lake's airport registered a record high of 62.  
Hours later, the city had 7 to 8 inches of new snow. Some canyons 
in the Salt Lake Valley received up to 15 inches. 
</P>
<P>
	In Colorado, several incoming flights to Denver International  
Airport were diverted to Colorado Springs Wednesday afternoon 
because of winds gusting to 60 mph and blowing dust. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in the Denver area, falling trees and limbs caused  
scattered electrical outages. Up to 8 inches of snow fell in the 
mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Sierra Nevada mountains of California and Nevada,  
Interstate 80 reopened as conditions were clear Wednesday. More 
than 8 feet of snow had fallen on the region in just four days.

<HEADLINE> Ditka To Have Further Heart Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- New Orleans Saints coach Mike Ditka plans to  
have further testing done on his heart as a precautionary measure 
after receiving treatments earlier this month to correct an 
irregular heartbeat. 
</P>
<P>
	Ditka, 59, revealed his most recent heart problem Tuesday during  
an interview in Chicago. He gave no indication that his recent 
condition will prevent him from coaching a third season with the 
Saints. 
</P>
<P>
	``(The heart) went out of rhythm, and I had to get it shocked  
back into rhythm,'' said Ditka, who was scheduled to return to New 
Orleans today. ``But I feel pretty good. I've been working out 
every day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ditka said he will have an angiogram performed soon to check for  
possible blockage in his heart and the valves and arteries that 
surround it. The treatment he received Feb. 2 was an electric 
shocking of the heart used to correct irregular beats. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to get an angiogram, and then make sure I don't have  
any blockage,'' Ditka said. ``If I have blockage, then I have to 
get done what has to be done whether they have to bypass it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel good. But I'm not going to assume anything, because Dan  
(Reeves, Atlanta's coach) felt good. Then all of a sudden he didn't 
feel good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves had quadruple heart bypass surgery performed Dec. 14, one  
day after experiencing unusual sensations in his neck and chest 
during a game against Ditka and the Saints in the Superdome. 
</P>
<P>
	Ditka experienced a fluttering sensation in his chest about two  
weeks ago during the week preceding the Super Bowl, Ditka's wife, 
Diana, said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ditka was examined by a cardiologist recommended by Saints team  
physician Dr. Charles Brown, Diana Ditka said, and the irregular 
heartbeat was detected. 
</P>
<P>
	The Saints coach was placed on blood thinners in preparation for  
the Feb. 2 procedure, known as cardioversion. 
</P>
<P>
	``What happens is your heart flutters,'' Mrs. Ditka said. ``So  
it gives you a little bit of a sensation in there. It's like an 
anxiety attack. That's what he was feeling. And that's why he 
decided to get checked. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it was not like heart or chest pains or anything like  
that. It was just a little bit of an anxiety attack. He had an 
irregular heartbeat, and they shocked it to get it back to normal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a common thing when you have a heart disease, which he  
has. It's not major, and it only took a couple of hours to do it. 
He felt fine afterward. This is totally preventative medicine, 
really.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Nov. 2, 1988, Ditka suffered a heart attack while he was head  
coach of the Bears. The attack required an angioplasty procedure to 
clear a small blocked valve located in the rear of his heart. 
</P>
<P>
	Ditka missed just one game before returning to the sidelines and  
then completed a 12-4 season in which he was named NFL Coach of the 
Year. 
</P>
<P>
	Diana Ditka said her husband has been remiss in having regular  
medical checkups since joining the Saints on Jan. 28, 1997. But his 
current situation is nothing that will prevent him from coaching 
this season.

<HEADLINE> Syria Votes for Assad in Referendum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) -- Syrians, many dancing and singing outside  
polling stations, began voting today in a national referendum to 
approve a fifth seven-year term in office for Hafez Assad, their 
president of 28 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Assad, 68, an air force pilot who came to power in 1970, is the  
only name on the ballot and his re-election is virtually a foregone 
conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
	He won 99.99 per cent of the votes when he was last re-elected  
in December 1991. Today's result, scheduled to be announced 
Thursday, is not expected to be different. 
</P>
<P>
	Voters have a choice of checking a green ring that says ``Yes''  
or a black one signifying ``No.'' There are about 9 million 
eligible voters. 
</P>
<P>
	``A thousand yes to Hafez Assad,'' Rasmi al-Salti, a 54-year-old  
engineer, said as he prepared to vote in Damascus. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far back as I can remember, there has never been a more  
loyal and patriotic person than our president. It's our turn to 
repay him for all that he's done for us,'' Salti said. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the street, hundreds of people gathered under sunny skies  
waving Syrian flags, dancing to the beat of drums and singing 
national songs. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar scenes of jubilation could be seen outside almost every  
voting station in Damascus, with tens of thousands of men, women 
and children taking part. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today is the great day. ... All of Syria says `Yes' to leader  
Assad,'' headlined Syria's official Tishreen newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Its editorial said the election of Assad ``is the election of  
national pride, dignity and Arab solidarity and unity. ... It is 
the election of a prosperous future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Assad, whose current term ends March 12, served as air force  
commander and defense minister before taking power in a bloodless 
coup. He has since transformed his country from a coup-plagued 
former French colony into one of the Middle East's strongest 
powers. 
</P>
<P>
	The referendum climaxes weeks in which the re-election of Assad  
dominated life in Syria, an Arab country of 17 million people. 
</P>
<P>
	Giant portraits of Assad are displayed on almost every  
government building in Damascus, the capital, and banners pledging 
allegiance to the president are draped across squares. 
</P>
<P>
	Syrian flags and strings of pictures of Assad are plastered on  
almost every corner, wall, home and car in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``Assad Forever,'' says one banner. ``With Our Blood and Souls,  
We Say `Yes' to You,'' reads another. 
</P>
<P>
	The referendum was to have taken place Monday but was postponed  
after the death of Jordan's King Hussein on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Syria announced three days of mourning for the king, ending the  
rallies and late-night parties that were held across Syria after 
Parliament's Jan. 14 nomination of Assad. 
</P>
<P>
	Celebrations, which were organized by groups loyal to Assad's  
ruling Baath Socialist Party, were expected to resume Thursday.

a month before the city won the 1996 Games, but that the ideas were 
quickly dropped and never acted on. 
</P>
<P>
	Payne said the memo was an example of his ``brain-dumping''  
style of management that usually resulted in a colleague asking, 
``Are you crazy?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was wrong to even think about it, but what matters is what  
we did not do,'' Payne said. ``I'm embarrassed by it, and I feel 
like a jerk. It was a dumb thing to do, but our failure to act on 
this or even discuss it is a manifestation of how our system 
worked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A copy of the Aug. 20, 1990 memo, outlining possible gifts to  
IOC members to secure their votes, was obtained by The Atlanta 
Journal-Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC selected Atlanta over Athens, Greece, to stage the  
Centennial Games in a vote in Tokyo Sept. 20, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was in the heat of the battle, about three weeks before  
Tokyo, and I was just brain dumping, which I have a history of 
doing,'' Payne said. ``I have no fear that one of these brain dumps 
resulted in inappropriate action. We're not perfect, but we are 
sure our system worked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The International Olympic Committee is embroiled in a bribery  
scandal that began late last year when Salt Lake Olympic officials 
admitted giving cash, medical care and scholarships to IOC members 
and their families. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine members have either been expelled or resigned from the IOC,  
and a report released Tuesday by a Salt Lake ethics panel 
implicated 10 more members. 
</P>
<P>
	Payne has consistently denied any wrongdoing while securing the  
1996 Games. Some of the gifts suggested in his memo were a tennis 
scholarship to the University of Georgia for the daughter of an IOC 
executive board member, free medical care for another and free 
airline tickets for two other members interested in attending an 
international baseball game in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC member Pal Schmitt's daughter eventually attended the  
University of Southern California on a tennis scholarship. IOC vice 
president Anita DeFrantz said Tuesday she recommended Petra Schmitt 
for the USC scholarship, but Pal Schmitt told the Hungarian 
newspaper Nepszabadsag Wednesday that Petra had secured the 
scholarship on her own. Petra Schmitt was USC's No. 1 player and a 
two-time all-America. 
</P>
<P>
	Payne said he could not recall whether he sent the memo, which  
was addressed to Olympic organizer Ginger Watkins, or how long it 
took before the ideas were rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't tell you whether it was an hour or a day later,''  
Payne told The Associated Press. ``It was 10 years ago. ... It was 
a difficult time and I thank God that reasonableness was applied 
throughout the process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The memo came from records stored at the Atlanta History Center  
that Payne and his lawyers have refused to make public. The records 
detail the bid process, as well as the organization of the 1996 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are private records,'' Payne spokesman Lee Echols said.  
``We will make those records relevant to any allegations of 
impropriety, but it would be really fruitless to open up all the 
records unless there is a specific allegation that requires 
proof.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC has asked all bid cities fro the 1996 Games onward to  
detail any improprieties in their bids or improper actions by IOC 
members. Those responses are due next Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Payne and other former Atlanta organizers are still preparing  
their response.

<P>
	World Cup champion France, with two second-half goals from  
Nicolas Anelka, beat England for the first time ever at Wembley 
Stadium, coming away with a 2-0 victory Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``It won't be long before Wembley is knocked down and rebuilt  
and it's a great pleasure for a French team to come here and win at 
least,'' France coach Roger Lemerre said. 
</P>
<P>
	On a night of exhibition games across Europe, Norway played a  
scoreless tie against Italy at Pisa, and Portugal and the 
Netherlands played a scoreless tie in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	Denmark won 1-0 at Split against Croatia, the third-place team  
at last year's World Cup, getting a goal from Ebb Sand in a game 
interrupted by a 15-minute power failure. In Dublin, Ireland beat 
Paraguay 2-0 on goals by Denis Irwin and David Connolly. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Finland and Poland played a 1-1 tie at Valletta, Malta,  
and Albania beat Macedonia 2-0 at Tirana. 
</P>
<P>
	In the night's two qualifiers for next year's European  
Championship, Yugoslavia defeated Malta 3-0 and Cyprus beat San 
Marino 4-0 at Limassol, 
</P>
<P>
	Albert Nadj, playing his first international game, scored twice  
for Yugoslavia and Savo Milosevic scored once. Cyprus got two goals 
from Michalis Constantinou and one each from Vassos Melanarkitis 
and Marios Christodoulou. 
</P>
<P>
	Anelka became the first Frenchman to score against England at  
Wembley Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Playing against three defenders who play alongside him for the  
London club Arsenal, Anelka hit the crossbar in the 63rd minute 
with a shot that appeared to cross the goal line, then scored in 
the 69th and 76th minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has scored not two goals but three,'' Lemerre said. ``As  
far as I am concerned the first one was a goal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	France, which had lost four straight games against England at  
Wembley, is unbeaten in 18 games. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss did little to enhance Howard Wilkinson's chances of  
becoming England's coach. He is interim coach following last week's 
firing of Glenn Hoddle, who was ousted after being quoted as saying 
the disabled were being punished ``for the sins of an earlier 
life.''

<HEADLINE> Rangers' Palmeiro Has Knee Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Texas Rangers first baseman Rafael  
Palmeiro underwent surgery Wednesday to repair a slight cartilage 
tear in his right knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmeiro, who signed a $45 million, five-year contract to return  
to Texas after five years in Baltimore, is believed to have injured 
himself while running stairs as part of a workout last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors said he might be limited a bit at the beginning of  
spring training, but he should be able to play in exhibition games. 
He's expected to be ready for the start of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Team orthopedist John Conway said the tear was in the area of  
the groove on which the kneecap slides. 
</P>
<P>
	As a left-handed hitter, Palmeiro gets his power by stepping  
into the ball and planting his right leg. He hit .296 with 43 
homers and 121 RBIs for the Orioles last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers also announced that they signed four rookies on the  
major league roster to contracts: pitchers Derrick Cook, Ryan Glynn 
and Jonathan Johnson and infielder Kelly Dransfeldt. 
</P>
<P>
	The team now has agreed to terms with 33 of its 40 roster  
players.

<HEADLINE> La. Gov. Wansts to Shield Gunmakers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- A day after Georgia became the first state to  
shield gunmakers from product liability lawsuits by cities and 
counties, Louisiana Gov. Mike Foster on Wednesday announced his 
support for a similar bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure would block a New Orleans lawsuit seeking damages  
from gun manufacturers for the costs of gun violence. The bill 
Georgia Gov. Roy Barnes signed Tuesday was meant to block a similar 
case by Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``Georgia had no problem with it,'' Foster said while speaking  
to a civic club in Baton Rouge. ``And we, in Louisiana, believe in 
2nd Amendment rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New Orleans Mayor Marc Morial criticized Foster's decision,  
saying the bill ``is a sad sellout to the money and power of the 
gun lobby.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, in a New York City class-action lawsuit against the  
nation's largest gun makers, a judge on Wednesday urged a wavering 
jury to try to overcome its differences and reach a verdict. 
Deliberations were to resume Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is considered a model for the lawsuits by cities.

<HEADLINE> Georgia Governor Signs Gun Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- With few words and no fanfare, Gov. Roy Barnes  
signed into law a bill that makes Georgia the first state to 
prohibit its cities and counties from taking gun makers to court. 
</P>
<P>
	The move on Tuesday capped two weeks of lobbying by the National  
Rifle Association aimed at undermining legal challenges mounted by 
several cities -- including Atlanta -- to recover the costs of 
gun-related violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the first of what we hope to be many similar legislative  
efforts around the country in an attempt to stop what we think are 
basically extremely ill-considered, wrong-headed lawsuits,'' said 
James Baker, chief lobbyist for the NRA. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnes, a Democrat, issued a short written statement, saying  
he's confident the state can legally restrict the rights of its 
municipalities. 
</P>
<P>
	The new law, which goes into effect immediately, prohibits any  
Georgia city or county from filing product liability suits against 
the firearms industry, reserving that right to the state. The 
measure affects any pending or future suit. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta filed its suit last week, accusing 17 gun makers of  
negligently designing firearms with inadequate safety devices and 
warnings. 
</P>
<P>
	The city plans to move forward with its suit and challenge the  
new law, said Nick Gold, spokesman for Mayor Bill Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't feel it's constitutional for the state to tell the  
municipalities who they can and cannot sue,'' Gold said. 
</P>
<P>
	The NRA, which endorsed Barnes and Lt. Gov. Mark Taylor in the  
1998 elections, had thrown its weight behind the bill. The NRA 
claims to have 93,000 Georgia members and wields considerable clout 
at the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill gained momentum following Campbell's announcement last  
month that Atlanta would join other municipalities, including New 
Orleans, Chicago, Miami-Dade County and Bridgeport, Conn., in suing 
gun manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the law in no way limits who can buy or own a gun,  
supporters say gun suits threaten to reduce access to firearms. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the belief of a lot of folks that these types of suits  
amount to really a type of backdoor gun control,'' said Democratic 
state Rep. Curtis Jenkins.

<HEADLINE> Recall of Clot-Busting Drug Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Consumer advocates urged the Food and Drug Administration on  
Wednesday to recall the clot-busting drug Abbokinase because it 
could be contaminated with infectious diseases such as hepatitis. 
</P>
<P>
	But federal regulators said they have already enacted sufficient  
consumer protections, including urging doctors to consider using 
alternative clot-busters. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA last year found manufacturer Abbott Laboratories and  
supplier BioWhittaker failed to adequately test the neonatal kidney 
cells used to make the drug. As a result, the FDA suspended sales 
of Abbokinase in November to investigate the safety violations. 
</P>
<P>
	FDA inspection reports say the tissue was obtained from  
stillborn babies and prematurely delivered fetuses without adequate 
screening to ensure that they and their mothers were healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	After extensive sampling of the drug found no proof of  
contamination and Abbott upgraded its safety methods and added 
warnings to the drug's label, the FDA let sales resume Jan. 25. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington-based consumer group Public Citizen said those  
measures aren't enough. Sidney Wolfe, the group's health research 
director, charged that FDA ignored its own inspectors' 
recommendations to seize $100 million worth of Abbokinase and the 
raw materials used to make it -- kidney cells from dead babies in 
Cali, Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you have your choice of being injected with something that  
may be contaminated and something that isn't, most people would 
choose the one that isn't contaminated,'' Wolfe said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Abbott and the FDA are making a travesty of public health'' he  
wrote in a letter dated Wednesday to FDA Commissioner Jane Henney. 
</P>
<P>
	He demanded an FDA investigation into the ``extremely suspicious  
circumstances'' in which BioWhittaker of Walkersville, Md., 
obtained the kidney cells it sold to Abbott of North Chicago, Ill. 
BioWhittaker is a subsidiary of Cambrex Corp. of East Rutherford, 
N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	FDA officials said they were working with the companies to  
resolve the problems identified by inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are comfortable with our approach,'' said FDA biological  
products expert Dr. David Feigal. 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott spokeswoman Melissa Brotz said the product has been used  
by more than 4 million patients over the past 20 years with no 
reported cases of viral transmission. 
</P>
<P>
	``We remain confident Abbokinase is safe and effective. We are  
doing everything to improve the manufacturing process,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Abbokinase breaks up blood clots in legs and lungs, and clears  
catheters used by extremely sick patients. There are numerous other 
alternatives that work equally well or better but are much safer, 
so recalling Abbokinase won't hurt patients, Wolfe said. 
</P>
<P>
	But some doctors insist Abbokinase works best in certain serious  
or life-threatening situations, So FDA concluded that if those 
doctors understand the potential infection risk, they can choose 
it.

<HEADLINE> Chosen Few Attend Impeachment Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As the impeachment trial of President Clinton  
nears its end, only three dozen aides are being permitted into the 
Senate's secret sessions to assist the 100 senators and Chief 
Justice William Rehnquist. 
</P>
<P>
	It's an exclusive club that includes top leadership aides,  
stenographers and the Senate's chaplain. But to help prevent the 
public from learning what is happening inside, they have all taken 
an oath to ``never divulge, publish or reveal by writing, word, 
conduct or otherwise, for any purpose'' anything that happens. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really buttoned down,'' said Sen. Frank Lautenberg,  
D-N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	Barred are the White House lawyers and House managers who  
prosecuted the case. Forbidden are aides from senators' personal 
staffs and committees, always bristling with technical information 
and armloads of paper. Even the teen-age pages who normally scurry 
around with documents and glasses of cold water for senators are 
gone. 
</P>
<P>
	Rehnquist is accompanied by an assistant or two, participants  
say. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and Senate 
Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., have three aides apiece. No. 2 
GOP leader Don Nickles of Oklahoma has two assistants, and No. 2 
Democratic leader Harry Reid of Nevada has used one. 
</P>
<P>
	Two others familiar to television viewers of the trial also  
attend. They are James Ziglar, the sergeant-at-arms, who each day 
reads an ancient oath warning that disruptions will be met with 
``pain of imprisonment''; and the Rev. Lloyd Ogilvie, the 
sonorous-voiced Senate chaplain who opens each session with a 
prayer. 
</P>
<P>
	Stenographers rotate every 15 minutes, recording a transcript of  
proceedings that may never be publicly revealed. The Senate's 
secretary, legal counsel, parliamentarian and members of their 
staffs also attend. 
</P>
<P>
	Also given floor privileges is an aide to Sen. Max Cleland,  
D-Ga., who needs help transferring from his wheelchair to his 
Senate chair. 
</P>
<P>
	As for senators' cold water, that still gets delivered to  
Republicans by David Hoppe and Eric Ueland, top aides respectively 
to Lott and Nickles. It could not be immediately learned who is 
performing that function on the Democratic side.

<HEADLINE> Princeton Rally Stuns Pennsylvania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- In his 44 years as an official scorer at the  
Palestra, Bob McKee thought he had seen it all. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he saw ``The Comeback'' -- Princeton's furious rally from a  
27-point second half deficit to a 50-49 win that stunned archrival 
Pennsylvania 50-49. The win gave the Tigers sole possession of 
first place in the Ivy League. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been doing games here since 1955,'' McKee said. ``There's  
never been one like that. Never.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Well, not quite. According to Penn's sports information  
department, the rally from the 27-point deficit was the fourth-best 
in NCAA history (Duke's comeback from a 32-point bulge to beat 
Tulane 74-72 in 1950 is the biggest.) 
</P>
<P>
	The comeback was also the biggest in Princeton history, and  
Tiger fans can thank Chris Young for that. The 6-foot-10 freshman 
center, playing in his first game against Penn, scored seven of the 
game's last nine points, including the game-winning hook shot with 
2:15 left that gave the Tigers its 11th straight win and sixth in a 
row over Penn (14-4, 6-1). 
</P>
<P>
	After getting over a 29-0 first half run that saw the Tigers  
trail 33-9 at halftime, Princeton guard Brian Earl was drained. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing like it,'' said Earl, who finished with a  
game-high 20 points. ``I played some huge games in high school. 
We've won a lot of games, a lot of close games. But this, at the 
Palestra, the fans are on top of you, you're playing against kids 
you've played against for a while. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like a storybook ending,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	An ending that that seemed highly unlikely at halftime. After  
Earl opened the game with a 3-pointer, Penn's zone frustrated 
Princeton (16-4, 7-0) into 2-for-18 shooting, both by Earl. 
</P>
<P>
	The halftime score made guard Gabe Lewullis want to join some of  
the bored fans in the crowd of 8,872 out the exits. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was ready to leave, too,'' Lewullis said.  
</P>
<P>
	But the Tigers turned to a swarming pressure defense to slowly  
climb their way back into the game and quiet the otherwise 
delirious crowd. An eight-point run cut it to 42-30; the deficit 
dipped to nine with seven minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
	Penn didn't score in the game's final five minutes, and by the  
time the buzzer had sounded the score that read on the scoreboard 
stunned the Quakers and sent the Tigers into a delirium: 
</P>
<P>
	Princeton 50, Penn 49.  
</P>
<P>
	``I broke down,'' Earl said about his reaction at the end of the  
game. ``I had nothing left, both physically and mentally. I grabbed 
the ball and it all just sunk in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Penn coach Fran Dunphy hopes his team can get over the loss and  
gain revenge when the two teams again play on March 2 at Princeton. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's our test now,'' Dunphy said. ``To decide who we're  
going to be as a team. And we have to do a good job of staying 
together. We're one game behind and we have to take care of 
business.''

<HEADLINE> Nike Splits With Italian Soccer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEAVERTON, Ore. (AP) -- Nike has parted ways with the Italian  
national soccer team. 
</P>
<P>
	In a meeting with Wall Street analysts Tuesday, Nike officials  
said the company will cancel its $15 million a year sponsorship of 
the team, once seen as a jewel of the company's soccer sports 
marketing program. 
</P>
<P>
	While ending its sponsorship of a powerhouse soccer team such as  
Italy would have unthinkable for Nike in past years, the 
announcement drew praise from Wall Street analysts, who say the 
move is evidence Nike is serious about cutting costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is definitely a new Nike,'' said Dana Cohen, an analyst  
with Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Clarke, Nike president and chief operating officer, assured  
analysts the Beaverton company will return to sales growth in its 
2000 fiscal year, which begins June 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're poised to have steady improvement,'' Clarke said. He did  
warn, however, that the turnaround will be slow and steady. ``I 
think we have to be clear: We're not going to explode into revenue 
growth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ongoing fiscal discipline is key, executives said.  
</P>
<P>
	Nike has cut its selling, general and administrative costs from  
$2.8 billion in its 1998 fiscal year to $2.4 billion in 1999. The 
company also has cut back on filling new positions and taken to 
paying lower fees for athlete endorsements.

<HEADLINE>  Judge Orders Pilots To Halt Sickout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- A federal judge today ordered pilots at American  
Airlines to stop calling in sick in a pay dispute that grounded 
hundreds of flights and disrupted travel for more than 200,000 
passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Joe Kendall chided both sides in issuing the  
temporary restraining order and told them to resume negotiating. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's silly for us to even be here,'' he said. ``It's like  
killing a gnat with a sledgehammer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall told the pilots to return to work Thursday and warned  
they could be held in contempt of court if they violate his order. 
He also said he wants to see copies of any messages to the pilots 
asking them to return to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you would look up bad labor relations in the dictionary,  
you would have an American Airlines logo beside it,'' Kendall said. 
</P>
<P>
	AMR Corp., the airline's parent company, had asked the judge to  
order pilots to stop calling in sick in the midst of a labor 
dispute about salaries paid pilots of Reno Air, which it recently 
acquired. 
</P>
<P>
	AMR attorney Dee Kelly also asked for damages, saying that the  
airline was losing money in the clash that resulted in the 
cancellation of nearly 1,000 flights today. American pilots are 
barred by federal law from striking over the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're threatening to bring the airline to a complete halt,''  
Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
	After hearing the company's request, Kendall called a two-hour  
break in the hearing and invited the two sides to talk during that 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't seem to me like a bunch of grown up people with  
cumulative IQs couldn't sit down and figure this out without 
disrupting several hundred thousand people,'' Kendall said. 
</P>
<P>
	The strife between American and its pilots -- which has resulted  
in travel delays for more than 200,000 passengers -- has now 
grounded about than 2,500 flights since Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Talks stalled last Friday over when pilots from Reno Air would  
be upgraded to the pay scale received by American's pilots. The 
next day, many pilots began calling in sick and refusing to fly 
voluntary overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	American spokesman John Hotard said 2,077 pilots had reported  
sick today alone. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I look at these numbers we should contact the Centers for  
Disease Control,'' Kendall said to the pilot union's lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	The union said the abnormally high number of sick calls was a  
rational response to the stress the labor dispute creates for 
individual pilots, and noted that safety regulations require pilots 
to stay home if they consider themselves under too much stress to 
fly. 
</P>
<P>
	In a court filing, American Airlines management argued that the  
union's advice to members to stay home if the labor dispute was 
causing them stress is a sign the union was, in effect, pushing an 
illegal sickout. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of our pilots are reporting to work, but those who are  
not have created an untenable situation,'' airline chairman Donald 
J. Carty said. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of cancellations has escalated each day. On Tuesday,  
more than 800, or 36 percent of its 2,250 daily flights, were 
canceled, delaying 73,000 travelers. 
</P>
<P>
	American's 9,400 pilots, represented by the Allied Pilots  
Association, say AMR should add Reno Air pilots to its roster more 
quickly, thereby moving all employees up on its pay scale. 
</P>
<P>
	AMR said that it will take about 12 to 18 months to move pilots  
into their new positions and that the union's demand for pay raises 
would cost as much as $50 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the nation, would-be passengers spent hours dozing on  
terminal carts stuffed with luggage or slumped in their chairs. 
From Miami to San Francisco, blinking blue letters on airport 
monitors read ``Canceled'' beside a long list of destinations. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this were to happen in Argentina, they would burn the  
airport,'' said Beatriz Chichizola, a native of Buenos Aires who 
waited for hours Tuesday at Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Smith, a farmer from South Otselic, N.Y., left nearby  
Syracuse for a week-long vacation to Aruba and was stranded Tuesday 
with five friends at Kennedy International Airport in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've given us the run-around,'' he said. ``We think the  
pilots on strike should be fired.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 75 people waited in line at the American Airlines counter  
at San Francisco International Airport -- Dorothy Krumper of 
Flanders, N.J., among them. Although her flight to New York was 
canceled, she was smiling and said the airline's employees treated 
her well. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were very nice. I'm being re-ticketed to United,'' she  
said.

<HEADLINE> IOC Promises To Continue Crackdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- With 20 percent of its members implicated in the  
Salt Lake scandal, the International Olympic Committee promised 
Wednesday to consider expelling more of them to restore its damaged 
credibility and assuage big-money sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will act decisively,'' said Anita DeFrantz, an IOC vice  
president from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC leaders read the 300-page report issued Tuesday by a Salt  
Lake ethics panel, a document detailing more than $1 million in 
cash payments and other favors lavished on IOC members during the 
city's winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The report linked an additional 10 IOC members to the scandal,  
bringing to 24 -- a fifth of the total membership -- the number of 
Olympic delegates accused of accepting excessive benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC said the ethics report was being forwarded to its own  
six-man panel investigating the Salt Lake case. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision-making IOC executive board expects to receive ``the  
earliest possible recommendations'' from the panel, the IOC said in 
a statement from Lausanne, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	``The IOC remains fully committed to investigating and taking  
action based on all available evidence,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the IOC panel identified 14 members involved in  
alleged excesses stemming from Salt Lake's bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine of those members have either resigned or been expelled by  
the IOC executive board. Three others -- including powerful 
executive board member Kim Un-yong of South Korea -- remain under 
investigation, one received a warning and one has died. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC noted that last month's expulsions were ``based on  
evidence available at the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Further expulsions are now likely before the special IOC  
assembly in Lausanne, March 17-18. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you find something that's a real breach, we basically have  
only one sanction, and that's expulsion,'' said IOC vice president 
Dick Pound, head of the internal inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC executive board delegate Jacques Rogge, a member of Pound's  
panel, said the commission will likely meet soon to review the 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogge said he was not surprised that more members were  
implicated. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew more names would come up,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Rogge said a key issue for the IOC panel will be to determine  
whether members were guilty of actual ethical violations. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to differentiate between what is a breach of the  
line, and what is so-called `lavish treatment,''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch has also written to all  
cities which bid for the Olympics of 1996 through 2004, asking for 
any documented evidence of misconduct. The deadline for responses 
is Feb. 15, meaning even more members could be implicated before 
the March meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC marketing director Michael Payne, on a trip to the United  
States to meet with Olympic sponsors, said the IOC is doing 
everything in its power to stamp out corruption and institute 
reform. 
</P>
<P>
	``Has the IOC been damaged?'' Payne said. ``Yes, clearly it has.  
On the other hand, it's the opportunity to clean house and to 
reform. You have to take two or three steps backwards to move one 
step forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the head of Olympics sponsor John Hancock insurance  
criticized the IOC's handling of the crisis and suggested that 
Samaranch's tenure may be running out. 
</P>
<P>
	But Payne rejected the continuing calls from outside the IOC for  
Samaranch to resign, saying the 78-year-old president is needed to 
lead the house-cleaning efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the president stepped down, you would have a presidential  
election with all the instability that would bring,'' Payne said. 
``That's the last thing you want at this stage. You need a firm 
hand at the top to drive through the changes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Payne played down the decison by John Hancock, one of the IOC's  
international corporate sponsors, to cancel negoatiations with NBC 
for $20 million in ads. 
</P>
<P>
	``They aren't withdrawing from their sponsorship,'' he said.  
``This issue is related to a media purchase, which is separate from 
the sponsorship. Several Olympic sponsors don't advertise at all on 
the broadcast. There's no obligation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite John Hancock's move, Payne said there was no crack in  
support from the Olympic sponsors who pay tens of millions of 
dollars to help finance the games. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sponsors are standing, first of all, behind the games,  
and, second, behind the steps and action the IOC, Samaranch and the 
executive board are taking,'' Payne said. 
</P>
<P>
	Payne spoke by telephone from New York, where he will meet this  
week with Olympic sponsors. He also is to travel to Australia later 
this month to meet with sponsors of the 2000 Sydney Games. 
</P>
<P>
	A key test for IOC leaders is how they handle the case of Kim,  
the South Korean executive board member and highest-ranking 
official implicated in the Salt Lake scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim is one of three members -- along with Russia's Vitaly Smirnov  
and Ivory Coast's Louis Guirandou-N'Diaye -- still under 
investigation by Pound's panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim was further implicated in the Salt Lake report. It found  
that the bid committee paid $45,000 toward the salary of his son, 
John, to work at Keystone Communications, a satellite 
communications company based in Salt Lake. Keystone's former chief 
executive said the bid committee paid all of the costs of John 
Kim's employment -- $75,000 to $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim claimed the report had exonerated him and his son.  
</P>
<P>
	``Any secret deal between the bid committee and Keystone was a  
contrivance solely between those two entities, and was wholly 
unknown to either Dr. Kim or to his son,'' Kim's lawyer, Howard 
Graff, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics report also said Kim sought bid committee help in  
getting a visa and admission aid for a Russian student at the 
University of Utah. The committee spent $15,000 on the student, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim, 67, has been considered a leading contender to succeed  
Samaranch, whose term expires in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	``Such persistent attempts to smear both my reputation and the  
leadership of president Samaranch are political and designed to 
undermine the stability of his leadership, as well as to affect the 
succession of his presidency,'' Kim said. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the time comes, I will fight back,'' he said. ``I have a  
lot of ammunition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kim said he did not expect his opponents to try to expel him.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's too risky for them,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	In other developments:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Australia's Phil Coles, one of the 10 new IOC members  
implicated in the Salt Lake case, stepped down from the Sydney 
Olympic organizing committee board, pending an IOC inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	The Salt Lake report said Coles and Guatemala's Willi  
Kaltschmitt made four visits together, with their families, to the 
United States -- including a trip to the Super Bowl in Miami, hosted 
by Salt Lake City bid director Tom Welch, at a cost of $19,991. 
</P>
<P>
	``Phil categorically denies that he visited Salt Lake City four  
times during Salt Lake City's candidature,'' Coles' lawyer, Simon 
Rofe, said. ``It is regrettable that the board of ethics chose to 
make this serious allegation of unethical conduct without first 
putting it to Phil in order that he could respond and set the 
record straight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Barbados IOC member Austin Sealy, who was implicated in the  
Salt Lake report, denied any wrongdoing. Bid records showed $3,000 
a month passed through a company affiliated with a consultant to 
Sealy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have never been solicited for my vote, never been offered  
any payment, never been offered any inducement,'' he said. ``The 
bottom line is that I know nothing about any payments. I'm 
completely in the dark about this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- The Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter reported that Stockholm's  
unsuccessful bid for the 2004 Olympics paid for the medical care of 
IOC members or their relatives on five occasions. The newspaper 
said each of the payments amounted to more than the $150 limit for 
gifts. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that Olympic chief  
Billy Payne suggested a college tennis scholarship, medical 
treatment and free plane tickets as gifts for IOC members in a memo 
written before the city won the 1996 Games, but immediately 
dismissed the idea. 
</P>
<P>
	-- In Salt Lake City, Olympics organizers scrambled to smooth the  
way for Mitt Romney to be chosen Thursday as the chief of a 
committee badly bruised by scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston venture capitalist, who is the choice of Gov. Mike  
Leavitt and Salt Lake Organizing Committee chairman Robert Garff, 
met Wednesday with SLOC board members who will be asked to hire him 
as the new chief executive officer of the group staging the 2002 
Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the sort of franchise player that can restore the  
integrity to an institution that has gone awry,'' said Bill Hybl, 
president of the U.S. Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Leavitt, responding to allegations that the telecommunications  
company U S West dangled a $5 million Olympic contribution for 
favorable treatment, said Wednesday he is abandoning a sweeping 
initiative to deregulate the industry.

<HEADLINE> Report Explores Atlanta Bid Gifts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Atlanta Olympic chief Billy Payne, in a  
memorandum written before the city won the 1996 Games, suggested a 
college tennis scholarship, medical treatment and free plane 
tickets as gifts for International Olympic Committee members, The 
Atlanta Journal-Constitution said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said it received a copy of the memo this week. It  
said the memo to bid team colleague Ginger Watkins, written Aug. 
20, 1990, is the first evidence that Payne considered gifts for IOC 
members that he now says were ``out of bounds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When queried about the memo, Payne's attorney, Joe Bankoff, and  
Watkins searched Olympic records at the Atlanta History Center and 
found the original in a box containing some of Watkins' files, the 
newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Payne said Tuesday he doesn't remember the memo, but said after  
the original was found that he must have written it. He said he 
suspected the memo was never sent, but if it was, ``none of those 
suggestions, which could have been deemed inappropriate, were ever 
acted upon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the memo, Payne suggested inducements such as a University of  
Georgia scholarship for IOC Executive Board member Pal Schmitt's 
daughter and an invitation for medical treatment from the Emory 
Clinic to Bashir Mohamed Attarabulsi, the Libyan IOC member who 
resigned recently. 
</P>
<P>
	In an effort to characterize the environment in which he wrote  
the memo, Payne said the final few weeks before the vote were 
``unbelievably tense and busy,'' and the competition among the six 
bidding cities ``was fierce.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In those frantic few weeks before the announcement, I was  
continually thinking out loud about things which might have made a 
difference in our campaign,'' he acknowledged. ``None of these 
directives were ever seriously discussed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Watkins said Tuesday she didn't remember receiving the memo and  
agreed with Payne that even if she did, none of his suggestions was 
acted upon. 
</P>
<P>
	``None of the things that are on there ever occurred,'' she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Payne's memo also suggested gifts such as complimentary airline  
tickets for two IOC members from South America; a suit of clothes 
made by a specific Korean haberdasher for the member from Panama; 
and a letter showing support for Atlanta signed by all the members 
of the U.S. Supreme Court for the head of the IOC's juridical 
commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The first item on the list was headed ``Attarabulsi.'' Payne  
suggested they come up with ``a letter from Emory Clinic 
acknowledging that we would like him to come to Atlanta for medical 
treatment whenever he needs it and an offer to pay his air 
transportation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An Emory Clinic spokeswoman said corporate policy prohibited the  
clinic from confirming or denying whether Attarabulsi ever received 
treatment. Attarabulsi, an IOC member since 1977, resigned because 
of revelations that his son, Suhel, received tuition to attend an 
English language center at Brigham Young University and a community 
college, plus $700 a month for expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the item headed Pal Schmitt, Payne wrote, ``Get a letter  
from the University of Georgia offering a scholarship to his 
daughter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A university spokesman said there is no record of Schmitt's  
daughter, Petra, attending the university. She enrolled at the 
University of Southern California in 1992 and was two-time 
all-American on the tennis team. 
</P>
<P>
	Payne said he believes providing medical treatment and  
scholarships would be improper. But he said that because his 
proposal to do just that was dismissed is ``testimony to the high 
standards, under enormous pressures, used by our team in pursuit of 
the Games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The other six gift ideas on his list were simply personal items  
that would have fallen within the IOC's rules at the time, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Payne said he never acted on his bad ideas.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was brain dumping, which is not uncharacteristic of me,'' he  
said. ``For every good idea I had, I had a thousand bad ideas.' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC, following revelations of payoffs in Salt Lake City, is  
investigating all candidate cities from 1996 through 2006. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC has sent an inquiry letter to the U.S. Olympic Committee  
seeking any evidence of improprieties in Atlanta's bid. Payne said 
he has not received a formal inquiry from the USOC or the IOC, but 
he has prepared a response that maintains the Atlanta bid team 
violated no laws or Olympic rules. It also asserts no bribes or 
inappropriate gifts were sought by IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	No specific evidence of wrongdoing has surfaced in the Atlanta  
bid, and Payne and Watkins both contend that none will. ``Our games 
were won fairly,'' Payne said.

<HEADLINE> Ray Allen Gets $70M Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Guard Ray Allen signed a $70.9 million,  
six-year extension today, becoming the highest-paid player in 
Milwaukee Bucks history. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a coach, my job is to piece this thing together,'' new  
coach George Karl said at a news conference to announce Allen's 
extension. ``And now I've got a very big piece.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allen negotiated directly with team owner Herb Kohl, the senior  
senator from Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen, who saved a 4 percent commission -- $2,836,000 -- that he  
would have had to pay an agent, said Kohl agreed to pay him the 
maximum salary allowed a third-year player by the new collective 
bargaining agreement: $9 million to start, with annual raises of 
12.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	That works out to $70.9 million over six years, the same  
contract recently signed by Kobe Bryant, Allen Iverson, Shareef 
Abdur-Rahim and Antoine Walker, all three-year stars who would have 
been eligible for free agency after this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen didn't want to become a free agent, where he wouldn't have  
been able to make as much money anyway, according to the new 
collective bargaining agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	But with his budding movie career -- he starred alongside Denzel  
Washington in Spike Lee's ``He Got Game,'' last year, many felt 
he'd rather live in New York or Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want to,'' Allen said. ``Milwaukee is not a big  
market but you can create that here. Utah did it with Karl Malone 
and John Stockton. Green Bay has done it with Brett Favre.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Allen didn't have an agent, he did hire celebrity  
lawyer Johnnie Cochran at $500 an hour to look over the contract. 
</P>
<P>
	He also had a business manager, an accountant and his personal  
lawyer, collectively known as ``Team Allen,'' to make sure the deal 
was to his liking. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen's deal surpasses the $68.25 million contract that Glenn  
Robinson got as the top pick in the 1994 NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen met with Kohl late last month and said he was satisfied  
not only with the offer but with the owner's commitment to building 
a championship contender in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	Karl was delighted that Allen worked without an agent, saying  
last week ``contract negotiations are simple stuff now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Karl also said it didn't concern him that Allen might get bogged  
down with money matters instead of the business of playing 
basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	``You all think negotiating a big contract is bothersome,'' Karl  
said, chuckling. ``It's fun negotiating to be rich.''

<HEADLINE>  Judge Orders Pilots To Halt Sickout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- A federal judge ordered pilots at American  
Airlines Wednesday to end a sickout that has grounded 2,500 
flights, stranded an estimated 200,000 travelers and left 
businesses scrambling to find new ways to ship cargo. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Joe Kendall chided the pilots union and the  
airline in issuing a temporary restraining order and told them to 
resume negotiating. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's silly for us to even be here,'' he said. ``It's like  
killing a gnat with a sledge hammer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall told the pilots to return to work Thursday and warned  
they could be held in contempt of court if they don't. He also 
placed some blame for the dispute on the airline. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you would look up bad labor relations in the dictionary,  
you would have an American Airlines logo beside it,'' Kendall said. 
</P>
<P>
	AMR Corp., the airline's parent company, had asked for the  
judge's order. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're threatening to bring the airline to a complete halt,''  
AMR attorney Dee Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilots began calling in sick and refusing overtime Saturday  
after talks broke down with the company about the salaries paid 
pilots of Reno Air, which AMR recently acquired. American pilots 
are barred by federal law from striking over the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Reno pilots make half the $164,000 a year that an  
experienced American pilot makes and the American pilots want AMR 
to add Reno pilots to the higher pay scale quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	AMR said that it will take about 12 to 18 months do that and the  
pilot union's demands would cost as much as $50 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline estimated that 2,077 of the 9,400 American pilots  
called in sick Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	AMR spokesman Chris Chiames said the company believed the pilots  
would abide by the judge's order. ``We have never questioned a 
pilot that has called in sick. We just hope they will all get 
better soon,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the pilots' union was not immediately available  
to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, passengers struggled through another day of  
delays. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicole Travis, 15, of Long Island, N.Y. found herself stuck in  
Chicago, a city she had no intention of visiting. Travis said she 
stood in line for four hours at LaGuardia Airport in New York, then 
got booked on a United Airlines flight to Chicago's O'Hare 
International Airport, hoping eventually to get to a planned 
vacation with relatives in Tampa, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was supposed to be an eight-day vacation but now it's only  
seven days. This day was wasted,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Erin McGrath was angry at the pilots because she got stuck after  
a business trip to West Palm Beach, Fla. She waited in line at the 
Ft. Lauderdale airport Wednesday for a rental car so she could 
drive to Miami for a flight to San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm waiting for the time when unions and employees realize  
that they don't have to share in every penny of their company's 
profits. It seems like the only people they are hurting are the 
ones that pay their bills.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, some praised American employees for being friendly and  
helpful in getting them booked on other flights. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlie Hall of Dallas arrived in Chicago on a United flight  
that American helped him book. ``I can't complain except that I 
lost frequent flier miles,'' said Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss of American's cargo services was causing heartburn at  
Gladstone's 4 Fish restaurant in Malibu, Calif., where supplies of 
succulent dungeness crab from Alaska were dwindling. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gladstones has no freezers or microwaves. All of our food is  
fresh,'' said spokeswoman Christine Lloyd. ``Our produce and fish 
is delivered daily, including Sunday. We rely heavily on things 
coming in every day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Miami, F C Forwarding, a small freight company that ships  
live animals, computers, and electronics -- mostly to Latin America 
-- decided earlier this week to find other shippers. 
</P>
<P>
	Adriana Rehm, a vice president, said does about 20 shipments a  
day, almost all with American. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't tell you we've lost money because there are other  
alternatives to American, but it has been a major inconvenience,'' 
Ms. Rehm said. ``We've had to scramble to get our stuff out on time 
and avoid customer dissatisfaction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	TWA, Delta and other airlines accepted American tickets in the  
same price class and waived the customary change of flight fee, as 
part of a common pact made between airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're picking them up wherever we fly if American operates  
there, too,'' said Delta spokesman Bill Berry. 
</P>
<P>
	Airline analyst Raymond Neidl with Furman Selz Inc., estimated  
American is losing about $19 million a day in revenue -- or $1.5 
million a day in profits. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he doubted the airline has alienated customers for the  
long term. 
</P>

	``The key question is how quickly will this business come back  
to American, and my guess is pretty quickly,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  Judge Orders Pilots To Halt Sickout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- A federal judge today ordered pilots at American  
Airlines to stop calling in sick in a pay dispute that grounded 
hundreds of flights and disrupted travel for more than 200,000 
passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Joe Kendall chided both sides in issuing the  
temporary restraining order and told them to resume negotiating. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's silly for us to even be here,'' he said. ``It's like  
killing a gnat with a sledgehammer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall told the pilots to return to work Thursday and warned  
they could be held in contempt of court if they violate his order. 
He also said he wants to see copies of any messages to the pilots 
asking them to return to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you would look up bad labor relations in the dictionary,  
you would have an American Airlines logo beside it,'' Kendall said. 
</P>
<P>
	AMR Corp., the airline's parent company, had asked the judge to  
order pilots to stop calling in sick in the midst of a labor 
dispute about salaries paid pilots of Reno Air, which it recently 
acquired. 
</P>
<P>
	AMR attorney Dee Kelly also asked for damages, saying that the  
airline was losing money in the clash that resulted in the 
cancellation of nearly 1,000 flights today. American pilots are 
barred by federal law from striking over the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're threatening to bring the airline to a complete halt,''  
Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
	After hearing the company's request, Kendall called a two-hour  
break in the hearing and invited the two sides to talk during that 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't seem to me like a bunch of grown up people with  
cumulative IQs couldn't sit down and figure this out without 
disrupting several hundred thousand people,'' Kendall said. 
</P>
<P>
	The strife between American and its pilots -- which has resulted  
in travel delays for more than 200,000 passengers -- has now 
grounded about than 2,500 flights since Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Talks stalled last Friday over when pilots from Reno Air would  
be upgraded to the pay scale received by American's pilots. The 
next day, many pilots began calling in sick and refusing to fly 
voluntary overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	American spokesman John Hotard said 2,077 pilots had reported  
sick today alone. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I look at these numbers we should contact the Centers for  
Disease Control,'' Kendall said to the pilot union's lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	The union said the abnormally high number of sick calls was a  
rational response to the stress the labor dispute creates for 
individual pilots, and noted that safety regulations require pilots 
to stay home if they consider themselves under too much stress to 
fly. 
</P>
<P>
	In a court filing, American Airlines management argued that the  
union's advice to members to stay home if the labor dispute was 
causing them stress is a sign the union was, in effect, pushing an 
illegal sickout. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of our pilots are reporting to work, but those who are  
not have created an untenable situation,'' airline chairman Donald 
J. Carty said. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of cancellations has escalated each day. On Tuesday,  
more than 800, or 36 percent of its 2,250 daily flights, were 
canceled, delaying 73,000 travelers. 
</P>
<P>
	American's 9,400 pilots, represented by the Allied Pilots  
Association, say AMR should add Reno Air pilots to its roster more 
quickly, thereby moving all employees up on its pay scale. 
</P>
<P>
	AMR said that it will take about 12 to 18 months to move pilots  
into their new positions and that the union's demand for pay raises 
would cost as much as $50 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the nation, would-be passengers spent hours dozing on  
terminal carts stuffed with luggage or slumped in their chairs. 
From Miami to San Francisco, blinking blue letters on airport 
monitors read ``Canceled'' beside a long list of destinations. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this were to happen in Argentina, they would burn the  
airport,'' said Beatriz Chichizola, a native of Buenos Aires who 
waited for hours Tuesday at Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Smith, a farmer from South Otselic, N.Y., left nearby  
Syracuse for a week-long vacation to Aruba and was stranded Tuesday 
with five friends at Kennedy International Airport in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've given us the run-around,'' he said. ``We think the  
pilots on strike should be fired.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 75 people waited in line at the American Airlines counter  
at San Francisco International Airport -- Dorothy Krumper of 
Flanders, N.J., among them. Although her flight to New York was 
canceled, she was smiling and said the airline's employees treated 
her well. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were very nice. I'm being re-ticketed to United,'' she  
said.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Utility Pays After Wildfires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Northern California's biggest utility  
has agreed to pay the government $7.25 million in cash and about $1 
million in property to settle allegations that its failure to keep 
trees near its power lines trimmed caused two wildfires in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement by San Francisco-based Pacific Gas and Electric  
Co. averts a Public Utilities Commission hearing scheduled for this 
week on whether the utility should be penalized for negligent 
tree-trimming. 
</P>
<P>
	In a lawsuit, the federal government said a fire in Northern  
California started when a 500,000-volt transmission line ignited a 
tree 7 feet away. State law requires a 10-foot clearance. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit also said another fire started when a dead tree that  
should have been removed by PG&AMP;E fell onto a power line. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Attorney Paul Seave said the settlement will ``compel PG&AMP;E  
to maintain its power lines in a safe and responsible manner. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the settlement, the utility admitted no wrongdoing.  
</P>
<P>
	PG&AMP;E spokesman Bill Roake said the utility's tree-trimming  
program is ``one of the most stellar in the United States.''

<HEADLINE> House Panel Looks at Gov't Waste </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal agencies lose over $30 billion a year  
to fraud and mismanagement and shouldn't get more money or start 
new initiatives proposed by the Clinton administration until they 
fix the problems, a GOP House committee chairman said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wouldn't we be better off trying to fix the problems in  
existing programs before we start creating dozens of new ones?'' 
asked Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., chairman of the Committee on 
Government Reform and Oversight. He spoke at a hearing on how to 
make agencies more accountable for the money they spend and 
oversee. 
</P>
<P>
	Inspectors general -- the internal watchdogs who police federal  
agencies -- who oversee programs with some of the worst problems 
testified that they've made progress in weeding out waste, fraud 
and abuse. But they acknowledged that problems persist and 
suggested that Congress is partly to blame for failing to pass laws 
that would help. 
</P>
<P>
	``HUD needs legislation to streamline its programs,'' said Susan  
Gaffney, inspector general at the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development. ``Powerful interest groups surround HUD. They're not 
interested in consolidating HUD programs and they influence 
Congress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The inspectors general from the Agriculture Department and the  
Department of Health and Human Services also testified. 
</P>
<P>
	Burton said the committee will ask agencies what legislation  
would help and eventually craft bills for Congress to consider. He 
also said agencies should be allowed to offer rewards to employees 
who turn around wasteful programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you offer $1 million, you'd be surprised how many people  
would start coming up with ideas,'' said Burton. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's hearing was convened to highlight government waste  
caused by overlapping responsibilities for overseeing regulations, 
poor management and con artists cheating benefit programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on reports gathered from the inspectors general, Burton  
said the committee added up over $30 billion wasted each year in a 
variety of housing, welfare and health care programs, including: 
</P>
<P>
	--$1 billion a year in improperly distributed Food Stamps.  
</P>
<P>
	--$1 billion in Supplemental Security Income overpayments.  
</P>
<P>
	--$4.4 billion in fraudulent earned-income tax credits.  
</P>
<P>
	--$365 million lost from delays in selling off foreclosed HUD  
properties. 
</P>
<P>
	Committee Democrats denigrated the hearing's focus on waste  
within social programs, contending that other government programs 
also lose billions each year to mismanagement and fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope that some of our GOP friends will be prepared to take a  
look at areas like defense spending or intelligence,'' said 
independent Rep. Bernard Sanders of Vermont, who tends to vote with 
Democrats. ``It is not true that those agencies are run cost 
effectively. They are in fact a disaster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Major Owens, D-N.Y., asked why delinquent farm loans  
totally $12 billion were not discussed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have a problem with welfare mothers stealing the  
government blind, we have a problem with farmers stealing the 
government blind,'' said Owens. 
</P>
<P>
	Burton said the committee would look into the delinquent farm  
loans.

<HEADLINE> Bitter Cold Wave of 1899 Recalled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A century ago this week most of America  
shivered in the icy grip of the cold snap that set the standard for 
cold snaps. 
</P>
<P>
	There was snow in Fort Myers, Fla., ice on the Mississippi River  
at the Gulf of Mexico and temperatures of 20 below zero in 
Quantico, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	That bitter cold wave set state record lows in Florida, Georgia,  
Kentucky, Louisiana, Nebraska, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, 
Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and West Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	A century later and with more weather observing stations in  
operation, the 1899 lows still stand as state records in Florida, 
Louisiana, Nebraska, Ohio and Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Great Storm locked the East in its cold embrace, worst in  
country's history,'' said National Weather Service meteorologist 
Ken Batty, who researched the event. ``Loss of lives, livestock, 
and crops was enormous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The temperature plunged to minus 15 in Washington, D.C., on Feb.  
11, 1899, the coldest ever recorded in the capital. At nearby 
Quantico, the thermometer hit 20 below. 
</P>
<P>
	That night, a powerful nor'easter began its journey up the East  
Coast. By the time it was over, there was more than 3 feet of snow 
in Philadelphia, New Jersey, New York City and New England. The 
Chesapeake region and the Potomac Valley had drifts up to 10 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was really the benchmark that other cold waves later were  
compared to,'' Batty, of Charleston, W.Va., said in a telephone 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
	The Great Arctic Outbreak of 1899 set cold records from Montana  
to Texas and east to the Atlantic coast, the late weather historian 
David Ludlum reported in The American Weather Book. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Batty noted, things are much different, with forecasts  
calling for temperatures to climb to the 60s and perhaps even 70 in 
parts of the Ohio Valley and Appalachians -- nearly 100 degrees 
warmer in some spots than the same week a century ago. 
</P>
<P>
	While the 1899 event was a surprise to many, significant winter  
storms today, such as the New Year's storm in the Midwest and the 
mid-Atlantic ice storm last month, were forecast well in advance. 
</P>
<P>
	In Florida 100 years ago, the cold brought snow flurries as far  
south as Fort Myers, with Lake City receiving 3 inches. Cold swept 
across the state behind the storm, and Tallahassee still holds the 
state record of 2 below zero on Feb. 13. 
</P>
<P>
	Freezing temperatures occurred all the way to Miami, which  
posted a low of 29 degrees on Valentine's Day. 
</P>
<P>
	For three days, there was sleigh riding in Montgomery, Ala. In  
Georgia, the northern part of the state hit 12 below zero, while 
the southern portion fell to zero. New Orleans saw a low of 7 
degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	In Chicago, the absence of snow on the ground enabled the freeze  
to penetrate up to 5 feet, damaging water pipes. On Lake Michigan, 
tugs were frozen out of port for four days. 
</P>
<P>
	From a sparse network of reporting stations, the coldest  
temperature measured was 61 degrees below zero in Logan, Mont. 
</P>
<P>
	Accompanying the great freeze were numerous floods caused by ice  
jams on the Ohio, James, Tennessee and Cumberland rivers and many 
streams and tributaries. There was ice, either floating or solid, 
throughout the entire Mississippi watershed, which was frozen south 
to Cairo, Ill. On Feb. 17, ice reached New Orleans and was passed 
out into the Gulf of Mexico two days later. 
</P>
<P>
	After Valentine's Day, temperatures began to moderate.  
</P>
<P>
	At the time people coped fairly well, Batty said, adding, ``You  
kind of wonder, now in modern days, whether we have a harder time 
coping in terms of lifestyles. ... They didn't have automobiles and 
that eliminates a lot of the problems we have today.''

<HEADLINE> Senate Moving Closer to Acquittal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate, poised to acquit President  
Clinton, has become the stage for a lesser drama centering on 
whether prosecutors will come away with even a simple majority 
favoring his conviction and removal from office. 
</P>
<P>
	With Republican hopes for a 67-vote conviction margin now just a  
distant memory, attention turned to the struggle for a mere 
majority -- a legally empty result that nevertheless would offer 
rebuffed House prosecutors a symbolic achievement for all their 
uphill work. 
</P>
<P>
	``The drama is going to be whether obstruction gets 50 votes or  
not,'' said Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	The article cited by Schumer, obstruction of justice, has been  
considered the stronger of two charges in impeachment trial 
deliberations that enter their third day today. Numerous senators 
have predicted the perjury article against Clinton would not 
achieve a majority. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Republicans said Wednesday they will not vote to convict  
Clinton. If three more do so and all 45 Democrats vote to acquit, 
the articles would fall short of a majority. Opinion polls have 
shown consistently that about two-thirds of the public think 
Clinton shouldn't be convicted and removed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't be surprised if others would make a similar  
announcement -- how many I don't know,'' Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., 
said of anti-conviction Republicans. Mack did not announce his 
position. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly half the 100 senators had not addressed their colleagues  
after the second day of closed-door deliberations ended Wednesday. 
Votes on the articles were possible late today, but senators were 
prepared to delay the verdict until Friday. The votes would be in 
open session. 
</P>
<P>
	If acquitted, there is a chance that Clinton would face no  
formal rebuke by the Senate. A Democratic initiative to censure 
Clinton struggled for survival under Republican resistance. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., said that if GOP leaders prevent  
a censure vote, supporters might simply draft a declaration 
condemning the president's behavior and circulate it for senators 
to sign. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's session spanned eight hours with several breaks  
along the way. More than 30 senators spoke, with most taking the 
maximum 15 minutes allotted and some reminded by Chief Justice 
William Rehnquist's gavel that time had expired. The first day of 
deliberations on Tuesday covered a period of slightly more than 
four hours. 
</P>
<P>
	While the transcript of the deliberations will remain secret  
unless the Senate changes its mind later, some senators have read 
to reporters the remarks they prepared for the closed session. 
</P>
<P>
	Moderate Republicans James Jeffords of Vermont, Arlen Specter of  
Pennsylvania and John Chafee of Rhode Island announced their 
opposition to conviction on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffords told reporters, ``The pressure is coming on to get a  
majority.'' But a spokesman for Majority Leader Trent Lott said the 
leadership had not tried to line up votes for conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott, R-Miss., issued a statement at mid-afternoon declaring  
that the evidence ``shows that the president has committed perjury 
and obstructed justice. The only question left is, will the Senate 
vote to find him guilty of committing these high crimes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's actions to conceal his extramarital affair with Monica  
Lewinsky were widely condemned by Democrats and Republicans alike, 
including those opposing conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffords said Clinton ``gave misleading statements ... did  
obstruct justice, but his actions in this case do not reach the 
high standard of impeachment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Specter told reporters he couldn't bring himself to vote for  
acquittal when the roll is called, but rather would declare the 
allegations were ``not proved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chafee said that despite Clinton's ``reckless, tawdry  
behavior,'' he concluded that House prosecutors presented 
``circumstantial evidence'' that was ``rebutted by direct evidence 
or by confusion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with CNN, Jeffords said six to seven Republicans  
might well vote to acquit on both counts, and possibly as many as 
12. He offered no elaboration. But a short while later, he told The 
Associated Press his earlier estimates may have been too high.

<HEADLINE> Bill Will Reduce Paperwork Burden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Small businesses would have the option of  
filing information with the federal government electronically under 
a bill the House passed Tuesday, instead of filling out and mailing 
stacks of paper forms. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure, passed 413-0, is intended to reduce the paperwork  
burden on government as well as on those who must comply with its 
requests for information. 
</P>
<P>
	``Paperwork burdens are literally strangling the productivity of  
our nation's economy, particularly small businesses,'' said Rep. 
Sue Kelly, R-N.Y., a sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
	The Office of Management and Budget says Americans spent more  
than 6.5 billion hours in 1991 completing forms and compiling 
records for the government. 
</P>
<P>
	Small-business owners also spend at least a billion hours each  
year filling out forms at an annual cost of $100 billion, the Small 
Business Administration says. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also is aimed at educational and nonprofit groups,  
federal contractors, state and local governments and individuals 
required to file papers with the government, such as employment and 
tax forms and patent applications. 
</P>
<P>
	It would not require small businesses to computerize their  
operations, said Rep. William Pascrell, D-N.J., who noted that some 
paperwork must be filed with up to 50 different federal, state and 
local agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure advances to the Senate, which failed to act on a  
nearly identical version of the legislation before the last 
Congress ended. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 439.

<HEADLINE> Bears President McCaskey Replaced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) -- Michael McCaskey was removed Wednesday  
as president of the Chicago Bears following a bungled coaching 
announcement that brought league-wide embarrassment to one of the 
NFL's founding franchises. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaskey, a Yale graduate and former business professor at  
Harvard, was moved upstairs to chairman of the board. The 
restructuring was announced by his mother -- majority stockholder 
Virginia Halas McCaskey, daughter of team founder and legendary 
coach George Halas. 
</P>
<P>
	Ted Phillips, the team's vice president of football operations  
and chief financial officer, was named president and CEO -- marking 
the first time in the team's 79-year history that someone outside 
the McCaskey-Halas family has held that position. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it took me overnight and I began to look at it  
realistically rather than sentimentally,'' Virginia McCaskey said. 
``I realized this was the way to go and the thing to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team was embarrassed last month when Arizona Cardinals  
defensive coordinator Dave McGinnis turned down the Bears' coaching 
job after his hiring was announced prematurely. The Bears issued a 
press release and called a news conference to introduce McGinnis, 
who was furious because there was no agreement in place. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bears later hired Jacksonville defensive coordinator Dick  
Jauron as coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael McCaskey, 55, who became the Bears' third president in  
1983, again apologized Wednesday for the McGinnis fiasco. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was nothing calculated in what happened there. For  
whatever mistakes that were made, I regret my part, especially the 
misunderstandings that developed. I wish we hadn't stumbled that 
badly,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's disappointing to foul up like that and to cause grief for  
other people whom you admire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bears have stumbled to 4-12 records the last two seasons,  
and some of their recent player acquisitions have been disastrous, 
none more so than quarterback flop Rick Mirer, who cost them a 
first-round pick and was released after one season. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael McCaskey, the oldest of 11 McCaskey children, has come  
under fire for choices throughout his career. He refused to hire a 
general manager, did not work out a plan to build a new stadium and 
saw thousands of no-shows at Soldier Field last season. 
</P>
<P>
	After winning a Super Bowl championship in 1985 with a team  
assembled primarily by former general manager Jim Finks, McCaskey's 
tenure was marked by an eroding talent base, losing seasons and the 
firing of head coaches Mike Ditka and Dave Wannstedt. 
</P>
<P>
	Virginia McCaskey said the McGinnis fiasco didn't persuade her  
family to make the change. And she said the criticism has been 
tough at times. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any mother, any wife likes to see her loved ones appreciated  
and supported. But I think maybe Mike has handled it better than I 
have,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael McCaskey praised Phillips for his contributions to the  
team over the last 16 years. He said handing over control to a 
person outside of the family ``was emotional, but it's not 
agonizing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's emotional because it is so important for us as the  
McCaskey-Halas family to be tied to the Bears.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the restructuring, his father, Ed McCaskey, who will  
turn 80 in April, stepped down as chairman of the board and took 
the title of chairman emeritus. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips, 41, a former auditor and tax accountant, joined the  
Bears in 1983 as the club's controller. He is still the team's 
chief negotiator of players' contracts but said he will try to hire 
someone for that position soon with the free agency period starting 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips learned of his appointment Monday when summoned to the  
McCaskey home. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he would not hire a general manager and that all  
football decisions would be made by personnel director Mark Hatley 
and Jauron. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no doubts that the structure in place can't be  
successful,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm in the process of looking at the entire organization to  
see what makes sense so that we can be successful in the future.''

<HEADLINE> Penguins Modest As Streak Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANONSBURG, Pa. (AP) -- The Pittsburgh Penguins have been there  
before, so don't tell them their seven-game winning streak makes 
them a cinch to advance deep into the Stanley Cup playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, the Penguins were coming off consecutive Stanley Cups  
and a late-season 17-game winning streak, only to lose to the New 
York Islanders in the second round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the Penguins' goals are more modest. They just want to keep  
this streak going as long as they can, beginning with Thursday 
night's home game against Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado's 12-game winning streak ended with a 2-1 loss Tuesday  
to Calgary, leaving the Penguins with the NHL's longest current 
winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you put seven wins together, you can't ride the back of  
just one person,'' coach Kevin Constantine said Wednesday. ``Tom 
(Barrasso) has had some great games in there, and Peter Skudra 
actually had some good games in there. Obviously, Jaromir (Jagr) 
has had a lot of good games in there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Obviously. Jagr leads the NHL with 77 points, 18 of them during  
the streak -- seven goals and 11 assists. 
</P>
<P>
	Jagr got hot when Constantine moved rookie Jan Hrdina and  
journeyman Kip Miller from the third line onto Jagr's No. 1 line. 
Miller scored the tying goal in Tuesday's 3-2 overtime victory over 
Montreal, his seventh goal in eight games. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexei Kovalev, who got the game-winner in the final half-minute  
of overtime Tuesday, has five goals and nine points during the 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller is having a career year with 10 goals and 19 points,  
while Hrdina is among the best first-year players in the league 
with eight goals and 25 points. Hrdina has three goals and nine 
points in eight games. 
</P>
<P>
	With all this scoring -- the Penguins have the NHL's No. 4  
offense -- they have won three games in overtime since Kovalev 
arrived in late November and have seven ties compared to 18 last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had to play pretty tight at the vest last year to get our  
points,'' Constantine said. ``And if you look at our wins last 
year, they were lower-scoring games than they are this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``So I would say the fact that we have a couple more  
game-breakers this year has allowed us to take some tie games and 
get the extra goal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The streaking Penguins could be buoyed by the return of two  
defensemen -- Ian Moran (abdominal injury) and Maxim Galanov 
(separated shoulder) -- on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Vancouver is led by former Penguins player Markus Naslund with  
27 goals and 45 points, while Mark Messier has 13 goals and 44 
points. Bill Muckalt tops all rookies with 15 goals and 32 points. 
Garth Snow has a 3.07 goals-against average and .898 save 
percentage.

<HEADLINE> News Corp. Posts Flat Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. posted flat profits  
in its fiscal second quarter as soaring costs for NFL games and 
losses from Fox News Channel offset robust video sales of the movie 
``Titanic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	News Corp. reported Wednesday it earned $395 million, or 40  
cents per U.S. share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31. The Sydney, 
Australia-based company earned $396 million, or 41 cents per share, 
in the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue jumped 15 percent to $4.06 billion from $3.53 billion,  
boosted by video sales of ``Titanic'' and ``Dr. Dolittle,'' as well 
as the international box-office success of ``There's Something 
About Mary.'' News Corp.'s 20th Century Fox studio co-produced 
``Titanic'' with Paramount Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
	The recent quarter's profits were boosted by a gain of $56  
million from the sale of an 18 percent stake in the company's Fox 
Entertainment Group to the public. The group includes News Corp.'s 
television and film operations, as well as sports holdings such as 
baseball's Los Angeles Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding that gain, News Corp.'s profits dropped 14 percent to  
$339 million, or 34 cents per share -- a penny above analysts' 
estimates. The results were released after the close of trading on 
the New York Stock Exchange, where News Corp. shares fell 62 1/2 cents 
to $28.37 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Profits were held back mainly by News Corp.'s television  
business, which posted a 27 percent drop in operating profits. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fox network absorbed higher costs for broadcast rights to  
professional football games and took a loss on the World Series, 
which drew poor ratings and ended quickly as the New York Yankees 
swept the San Diego Padres in four games. 
</P>
<P>
	Cable's Fox News Channel also posted a quarterly loss. Those  
downturns offset higher profits from the company's television 
stations. 
</P>
<P>
	News Corp.'s overall profits were also hurt by $44 million in  
start-up losses from its Latin American satellite broadcasting 
business. And operating profits from newspapers dipped 3 percent 
because of price discounts and promotional spending in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	News Corp.'s film business posted the best results, as strong  
video sales helped boost operating profits by 170 percent. News 
Corp. president Peter Chernin said he expects ``Titanic'' -- the 
highest-grossing film ever -- to continue aiding profits for up to 
another year. 
</P>
<P>
	Operating profits from the HarperCollins book publishing  
division rose 39 percent thanks to several best-sellers. Operating 
profits from magazines climbed 3 percent, helped by a higher cover 
price and rising advertising at TV Guide. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first six months of its fiscal year, News Corp. earned  
$591 million, or 60 cents per share, down from $639 million, or 67 
cents per share. Revenue rose to $7.22 billion from $6.38 billion.

<HEADLINE> NE Medical Mag Supports JAMA Editor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The editor in chief of one of the nation's top two medical  
journals says the firing of the other publication's editor was ``an 
irrational decision and an ominous precedent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. George Lundberg was fired from the Journal of the American  
Medical Association on Jan. 15 for publishing a 1991 survey of 
college students on whether oral sex constitutes sex. 
</P>
<P>
	AMA executive vice president E. Ratcliffe Anderson Jr. accused  
Lundberg of inappropriately injecting the AMA into a political 
debate by deliberately running the study during President Clinton's 
impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	In an editorial in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine,  
editor in chief Dr. Jerome P. Kassirer said a medical journal 
should be a ``lively forum'' for the discussion of important 
issues, even if they involve medicine only indirectly. 
</P>
<P>
	He added: ``I believe that medical editors have an obligation to  
publish not only articles that are well-reasoned, informative and 
carefully reviewed, but also ones that are sufficiently timely to 
contribute to the development of public policy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kassirer cited several articles that he, too, ``put on a fast  
track in order to be topical.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview, however, he said that as far as the survey's  
scientific value, it was ``certainly something I never would have 
published.''

<HEADLINE>  Rifts in Jordan Royal Family </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- The man who spent his life preparing to sit  
on the Hashemite throne was absent when the new monarch began 
greeting his subjects. 
</P>
<P>
	The death of King Hussein did more than shake up his nation. It  
rattled the royal family to the core. 
</P>
<P>
	At the center of the storm is Hussein's brother, 51-year-old  
Prince Hassan, who had been groomed as the royal heir for more than 
three decades. Then a quarrel over succession left Hassan out in 
the cold last month when the ailing Hussein picked his son, 
Abdullah, to take the throne after his death. 
</P>
<P>
	After Hussein died Sunday and King Abdullah took power, the  
family publicly united for the funeral. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hassan's decision to stay away from the greeting ceremony  
Tuesday could show cracks emerging and has made some people nervous 
after 46 years of steadfast rule under Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no room for any family rift because that will imperil  
national security and disturb the personal interests of the royal 
family,'' said former Cabinet minister Jamal Shaer. 
</P>
<P>
	There is little chance of serious challenges since the military  
is loyal to Abdullah, 37, a career officer. Yet Jordanians grow 
quickly uneasy over any royal discord in their tiny desert kingdom 
with an unmatched record of stability in the volatile Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
	``The monarchy here allows for one head of state, not two,''  
said political analyst Labib Kamhawi. ``Hassan's options are simple 
and clear: Either to stay in the country quietly or leave.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hassan's world came crashing down in the span of a few hours on  
Jan. 26. Hussein sent Hassan an angry letter of dismissal, accusing 
him of power-grabbing and fabricating ``lies and gossip'' about his 
family. 
</P>
<P>
	Palace sources said Hussein was referring to false allegations  
that his wife, Queen Noor, had an out-of-wedlock child before 
marriage and that she was maneuvering to have her son, Hamzeh, 
replace Hassan as the crown prince -- as he ultimately did. 
</P>
<P>
	At Hussein's funeral Monday, Hassan and his 19-year-old son  
Rashid were virtually the only immediate members of the family who 
did not wear the traditional mourning headdress. 
</P>
<P>
	Hassan stood silently, staring at the ceiling of the ornate  
throne chamber in Raghdan Palace, as other members of the family 
tearfully shook hands with heads of state and dignitaries paying 
respects. 
</P>
<P>
	Hassan's Pakistani-born wife, Princess Sarvath, and their three  
daughters were not present at the funeral. Hassan's daughters did 
not visit their uncle the king in his sickbed at an Amman hospital 
in his last days, when all the other royal family members were in 
constant attendance. 
</P>
<P>
	A palace source, speaking on customary condition of anonymity,  
said it has been a ``most strenuous time'' for Hassan because of 
the loss of his brother and ``the swift changes that ensued.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hassan has been cloistered in the library of his modest Amman  
home reading books until late at night, the source added. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently, rumors mounted that Hassan will take himself into  
exile in London like his uncle, Prince Nayef bin Abdullah, who fled 
to Spain one year after Hussein ascended to the throne, depriving 
him of the crown. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hassan's aides say there is ``nothing in cards now'' for any  
stay abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	In an emotional letter to Abdullah read Tuesday night on Jordan  
Television, Hassan pledged his support for the king and his crown 
prince. 
</P>
<P>
	``I vow in front of God, the nation, and our great people to  
support you and be a brother to your majesty and your crown 
prince,'' Hassan wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been suggestions that Abdullah -- who was sworn in as  
king only three hours after Hussein's death -- would appoint Hassan 
as a chief adviser to primarily oversee economic development in 
Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was not immediately clear if Hassan would accept a post  
that would require working under his nephew, 18-year-old Prince 
Hamzeh. As crown prince, Hamzeh is now No. 2 under King Abdullah, 
responsible for the country's affairs when Abdullah is away. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamzeh is Hussein's son from his fourth wife, American-born Lisa  
Halaby, who adopted the name of Noor al-Hussein -- Arabic for 
``Light of Hussein'' -- after converting to Islam before she married 
the king in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	Noor had ruffled the feathers of Hassan's family for showcasing  
Hamzeh and grooming him for the throne in recent years, the royal 
palace sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	Noor will keep her title as queen even if King Abdullah decides  
to bestow the title on his wife, Princess Rania, as well. Jordan 
can have more than one queen. 
</P>
<P>
	Another new factor is Princess Muna -- the former Toni Gardiner --  
Hussein's British-born second wife and the mother of King Abdullah. 
She went to live in Britain following her divorce from the king, 
but was in Jordan during Hussein's final illness, visiting him 
frequently at the hospital with other members of the royal family. 
</P>
<P>
	Muna had been little seen publicly in Amman for some years, but  
on Tuesday she re-emerged into view, joining Queen Noor and other 
royal relatives in receiving condolences from Jordanian women. In 
addition to Abdullah, she had a second son and twin daughters with 
Hussein.

<HEADLINE> Argentina 1, Mexico 0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Defender Juan Sorin scored in the 67th minute  
as Argentina disappointed a record soccer crowd of 91,585 at the 
Coliseum with a 1-0 victory over Mexico in an exhibition match 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	On a sequence beginning with a free kick, Guillermo Barros  
Schellotto drove to the goal from the left side, drawing Mexican 
goalkeeper Jorge Campos toward him. Campos deflected Schellotto's 
pass, but an onrushing Sorin put a diving header into the unguarded 
net. 
</P>
<P>
	Lethargic for most of the match played in front of the heavily  
pro-Mexico crowd, the Mexican team increased the fervor of its 
attack following the goal. Juan Manuel Abundis' 76th-minute shot 
barely went wide of the net while his 83rd-minute shot hit the 
crossbar. 
</P>
<P>
	Luis Hernandez' 79th-minute shot eluded goalkeeper German  
Burgos, but was cleared away by defender Claudio Husain. 
</P>
<P>
	Sergio Almaguer and Francisco Palencia took Mexico's final shots  
in the 84th and 90th minutes, with both going wide of the goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Argentina had the match's first credible scoring chance in the  
56th minute. Martin Palmero dribbled passed Mexico's defense, but 
his shot from inside the penalty area sailed over the goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Players from each team drew yellow cards during an uneventful  
first half -- Mexican defender Claudio Suarez in the 13th minute and 
Argentinean defender Eduardo Berizzo in the 22nd. 
</P>
<P>
	A closed-circut telecast of the match was aired at the adjacent  
Sports Arena to approximately 1,000 fans who were unable to be 
seated at the sold-out Coliseum.

<HEADLINE>  Hubble May Have Early Planet Images </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Scientists may be getting a glimpse of the  
infancy of planets in new pictures from the Hubble Space Telescope. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the pictures released by NASA on Tuesday don't actually  
show planets, they give a look at disks of dust that circle young 
stars. Scientists believe that as stars age, this dust condenses to 
form planets. 
</P>
<P>
	Thus, the Hubble images may be offering a glimpse of what our  
solar system looked like 4.5 billion years ago when the Earth and 
other planets began to condense, the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration reported. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA said Hubble was able to photograph the disks edge-on,  
avoiding the glare from the young suns that can overpower the light 
reflected from the dust. 
</P>
<P>
	``While the existence of these disks has been known from prior  
infrared and radio observations, the Hubble images reveal important 
new details such as a disk's size, shape, thickness and 
orientation,'' said Deborah Padgett of the California Institute of 
Technology's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, 
Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Her group used Hubble cameras to look at six young stars 450  
light-years away in the constellation Taurus. Light-years, used for 
measurement in space, represent the distance light travels in a 
year, or nearly 6 trillion miles. 
</P>
<P>
	In all six cases, the researchers found evidence of dust bands  
crossing bright areas around the star. 
</P>
<P>
	The images ``show dark clumps and bright streamers above and  
below the dust lanes, suggesting that raw material is still falling 
into these disks and driving outflowing jets of gas from the 
forming stars,'' Padgett said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> Jet Said To Be OK Before Flight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- The radar altimeter alarm on a Marine  
jet that killed 20 people in an Italian ski gondola malfunctioned 
on an earlier flight, but the problem was corrected, a maintenance 
officer testified today. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Col. Gary Eugene Slyman testified that when Capt. Richard  
Ashby, the pilot facing 20 manslaughter charges in the tragedy, 
signed out the EA-6B Prowler on Feb. 3, 1998, the jet had several 
minor problems. The problems included a missing screw and an 
erratic air-conditioner -- but nothing serious enough to ground it. 
</P>
<P>
	``This airplane was a solid player for us,'' Slyman, maintenance  
officer for Ashby's squadron, said during the third day of 
testimony at Asbhy's court-martial. ``This plane had flown the most 
sorties and most hours of any airplane we had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby, 31, of Mission Viejo, Calif., is charged with 20 counts  
of involuntary manslaughter, destroying government and private 
property and dereliction of duty. If convicted on all charges, he 
faces more than 200 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said the jet was flying too low and too fast in  
violation of an altitude restriction of 1,000 feet. The cable was 
hit at about 360 feet. Defense attorneys contend the ski area on 
Mount Cermis wasn't on Ashby's map. 
</P>
<P>
	Slyman said when he flew the plane on an earlier mission, the  
radar altimeter alarm -- which is supposed to go off when the plane 
dips below a prescribed altitude -- sounded at 25,000 feet instead 
of at the lower elevation it was set for. He said he reset the 
alarm and it corrected itself. 
</P>
<P>
	After the jet hit the gondola cable, Ashby filed a complaint  
about the radar altimeter, Slyman said, but Slyman didn't elaborate 
on the nature of the problem Ashby cited. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Ashby's former commander, Lt. Col. Richard Muegge  
described Ashby as ``an outstanding pilot,'' but one who took risks 
on the ill-fated flight. Muegge said he was surprised when he found 
out the Marine pilot had a video camera aboard. 
</P>
<P>
	``I sent them out there to do training, something valuable for  
us, not sightsee,'' Muegge said. 
</P>
<P>
	Muegge also testified that a 360-degree corkscrew roll the plane  
performed during the flight was risky and unsanctioned. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not very safe,'' he said. ``It doesn't take much to lose  
altitude. It can be disorienting. It's not commonplace and it's 
never been condoned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked by a prosecutor to rate Ashby as a pilot, Muegge said he  
was ``an outstanding pilot ... He had the best hands in the 
squadron. But it's more than hands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Prowler's navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, 31, of  
Westbury, N.Y., is scheduled to be tried next month for the deaths.

<HEADLINE> Ford Believes BMW To Be Independent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Ford President Jac Nasser declined Wednesday to  
rule out a possible acquisition of German automaker BMW AG, but 
said he believes BMW and its major shareholders when they say they 
want to remain independent. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasser wouldn't confirm or deny a German news report that Ford  
Motor Co. was about to hire former BMW board member Wolfgang 
Reitzle. He said he didn't want to jeopardize Reitzle's position by 
commenting while Reitzle was still negotiating terms of his 
departure from BMW. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Wolfgang is a tremendous executive and leader,''  
Nasser told reporters during the media preview of the Chicago Auto 
Show. ``I'm sad that he's in the situation that he's in. That's 
something for him and the board of BMW to work out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reitzle, who had once been considered the next in line to head  
BMW, resigned Friday in a management shakeup that also resulted in 
Chairman Bernd Pischetsrieder's ouster. The German news agency VWD 
reported that Ford would hire Reitzle as head of global 
development. 
</P>
<P>
	BMW also declined to comment on the report, attributed to  
unidentified sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Reitzle headed markets and product development for BMW, a maker  
of high-performance sports and luxury cars. His hiring by Ford 
would be a coup for the world's No. 2 automaker as it tries to 
strengthen its market position in Europe and elsewhere in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's shakeup led to widespread industry speculation that the  
company is seeking a change in direction that might include a 
merger or acquisition by a larger automaker like Ford or General 
Motors Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasser dismissed that speculation.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's not the way I read it. I read it as (the board) really  
trying to change what's happened rather than to change what could 
happen. I think it's a reflection of the Rover difficulties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute that led to Pischetsrieder's departure was over  
BMW's strategy for turning around its money-losing Rover unit in 
Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, they're going through a very difficult process,''  
Nasser said. ``The Rover acquisition has been a tremendous 
digestive problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When asked what he would do to correct Rover's problems, Nasser  
was coy. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the reasons we're valued as a great partner is because  
I think we do have the answers to those questions,'' he said. 
``It's a very, very sensitive issue. It's obviously got government 
and union and management and pride associated with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford, flush with $24 billion in cash, recently announced plans  
to buy Sweden's Volvo AB for $6.5 billion. The deal is awaiting 
Volvo shareholder approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasser said he has not talked to BMW or the Quandt family, which  
owns 42 percent of the company and would have to approve any deal 
with another automaker. But he noted that Ford is open to any 
overtures. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't rule out anybody,'' Nasser said. ``But I think when  
a company with the stature of BMW and their board come out and say 
they want to be independent, you have to respect that. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do think that the industry will continue to consolidate and  
we want to be part of the process of consolidation. So I wouldn't 
limit myself to any one particular group at this point.''

<HEADLINE>  Hubble May Have Early Planet Images </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Scientists may be getting a glimpse of the  
infancy of planets in new pictures from the Hubble Space Telescope. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the pictures released by NASA on Tuesday don't actually  
show planets, they give a look at disks of dust that circle young 
stars. Scientists believe that as stars age, this dust condenses to 
form planets. 
</P>
<P>
	Thus, the Hubble images may be offering a glimpse of what our  
solar system looked like 4.5 billion years ago when the Earth and 
other planets began to condense, the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration reported. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA said Hubble was able to photograph the disks edge-on,  
avoiding the glare from the young suns that can overpower the light 
reflected from the dust. 
</P>
<P>
	``While the existence of these disks has been known from prior  
infrared and radio observations, the Hubble images reveal important 
new details such as a disk's size, shape, thickness and 
orientation,'' said Deborah Padgett of the California Institute of 
Technology's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, 
Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Her group used Hubble cameras to look at six young stars 450  
light-years away in the constellation Taurus. Light-years, used for 
measurement in space, represent the distance light travels in a 
year, or nearly 6 trillion miles. 
</P>
<P>
	In all six cases, the researchers found evidence of dust bands  
crossing bright areas around the star. 
</P>
<P>
	The images ``show dark clumps and bright streamers above and  
below the dust lanes, suggesting that raw material is still falling 
into these disks and driving outflowing jets of gas from the 
forming stars,'' Padgett said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> Marlin Longs for 3rd Daytona Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Not long ago, Sterling Marlin was  
hoping to make history by winning the Daytona 500 three years in a 
row. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry Labonte would settle for just once.  
</P>
<P>
	And then he'd want more, insists Marlin, who won the crown jewel  
of stock car racing in 1994-95. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want it even more than I did then,'' Marlin said on the eve  
of a qualifying race that will determine where he starts Sunday. 
``It sure pays a lot more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed. Marlin collected $300,460 in 1995. The winner Sunday  
will get at least $1.1 million from a record purse of $8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Labonte -- three times a second-place finisher in 20 previous  
tries -- wouldn't mind counting the money. But for him, The Great 
American Race is not about finances. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to win very badly,'' the two-time Winston Cup champion  
said. ``Anybody would want to have this on their resume.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marlin has it on the top line of his, and feels like he's ready  
to take another shot at it in his second year with Team Sabco. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're much better than we were last year,'' he said. ``Since I  
won, I've been in some cars that were good enough to finish in the 
top 10, but not good enough to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``This year, the guys really went to work on the motor. We've  
got more power. Of course, I keep beating on them saying I need 
more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Labonte also feels good about his car.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's running real good right now,'' he said. ``But we've got  
to get better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both drivers will try to secure advantageous starting positions  
for Sunday in the first of two 125-mile qualifying races today on 
the 2 1/2-mile Daytona International Speedway oval. 
</P>
<P>
	Labonte says the qualifying races often result in surprises  
because some teams use them to experiment. His is among them, but 
at times the brevity of the qualifiers prevents teams from learning 
as much as they would hope. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can run 50 laps, it'll give us a good idea of how we  
stack up for the 500,'' he said. ``These races really set the 
stage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marlin expects to do less exploring than Labonte because he  
appears so satisfied with the way his car is running. His first 
priority is to find a drafting partner -- the key to staying near 
the front on the high-banked tri-oval. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't win it by yourself,'' said Marlin, who prevailed  
after starting 12th in one of the qualifiers a year ago. ``But I 
think we're going to be in good shape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marlin and Labonte are in the power-packed first qualifier led  
by reigning Winston Cup champion Jeff Gordon, who has the pole 
Sunday. Astride Gordon, a three-time DIS winner, is Ken Schrader, a 
three-time Daytona 500 pole-sitter. 
</P>
<P>
	Labonte starts fourth, outside Mark Martin, who broke an  
0-for-72 Daytona drought with a victory last Sunday in the 
non-points Bud Shootout. Marlin starts seventh. 
</P>
<P>
	The second qualifier has rookie Tony Stewart on the point. He  
starts second Sunday in his Winston Cup debut. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Skinner, who won the pole as a rookie in 1997, starts  
alongside Stewart today. Defending Daytona 500 champion Dale 
Earnhardt starts fifth, four spots ahead of two-time champion Dale 
Jarrett. 
</P>
<P>
	The qualifiers fill positions 3 through 30. The final 13  
starters will make the field Sunday on qualifying speeds or 
provisionals.

<HEADLINE> Listeriosis Outbreaks Worry Gov't </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Recent outbreaks of listeriosis are causing an  
``immediate public health problem,'' federal agriculture officials 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	They were reviewing how to address it, including whether to do  
more testing for the deadly bacterium. 
</P>
<P>
	At a daylong public meeting, officials said they had more  
questions than answers about a spike in outbreaks of listeriosis 
like the one traced to hot dogs and cold cuts at Michigan's Bil Mar 
Foods plant in December that has killed 16 people and sickened more 
than 70 in 14 states. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Agriculture Department officials said they would like more  
legal authority to focus on the danger to public health when they 
recommend recalls so the process of warning the public might be 
faster. 
</P>
<P>
	Listeria monocytogenes is a bacteria that healthy people usually  
fight off but sometimes can kill. Pregnant women, the newborn, 
older adults and people with weakened immune systems are especially 
at risk. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because we have an immediate public health problem, our first  
goal is to establish an immediate action plan to address 
improvements in the control of listeria,'' said Thomas Billy, 
administrator of USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service. 
</P>
<P>
	Farther ahead, the agency is considering whether industry should  
be required to do its own testing. It is also revisiting the shelf 
life of foods to see if the bacterium grows quickly at particular 
times or in particular foods after they are processed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new information based on this outbreak brings into  
question the adequacy of control procedures we've been relying 
on,'' Billy said. 
</P>
<P>
	The focus is on ready-to-eat foods such as luncheon meats  
because the bacterium can be killed if it is cooked until steaming 
hot, or past about 170 degrees. Fewer than 2,000 people in the 
United States report serious illness from listeriosis each year, 
but about one in four of them die from it. 
</P>
<P>
	Plant officials at Bil Mar voluntarily recalled about 35 million  
pounds of hot dogs and lunch meat on Dec. 22 in what agriculture 
officials are calling one of the largest recalls ever. 
</P>
<P>
	That recall, and one in January of about 30 million pounds of  
hot dogs and luncheon meat from the Thorn Apple Valley plant in 
Arkansas, represent most of the increase in the pounds pulled from 
shelves for listeria contamination in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1989, when the government implemented stricter policies  
for the bacterium, illnesses from listeria monocytogenes have 
dropped 44 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	At the meeting, federal officials also questioned whether they  
acted quickly enough in the Bil Mar recall. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the Centers for Disease Control had managed to  
trace 20 cases of food sickness to the Bil Mar plant by Dec. 18, 
and USDA officials said they met Bil Mar executives to urge them to 
consider a recall then. However, USDA officials said they did not 
feel comfortable recommending a recall until they found a package 
of unopened meat with the bacterium at the plant. That happened 
Dec. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	After several days of debate among medical experts, CDC  
officials clearly determined there was a public health threat on 
Dec. 22, the day of the recall, said Dr. Paul Mead of the CDC. 
</P>
<P>
	Phil Derfler, a USDA deputy director, suggested there should be  
legislation allowing the agency to require a recall ``based on the 
threat to public health rather than what it can show about the 
content of the food.''

<HEADLINE>  Olympic Report Finds Improper Perks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The U.S. Olympic Committee was linked for  
the first time to possible corruption and 10 more International 
Olympic Committee members were implicated for accepting extravagant 
gifts as part of a widening bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	A 300-page report issued Tuesday by a Salt Lake Organizing  
Committee ethics panel provides the first detailed glimpse of the 
way IOC members -- now numbered at 24, roughly a fifth of IOC 
membership -- had their hands out. The report said there were more 
than $1 million worth of cash payments, scholarships, shopping 
sprees, vacations and medical expenses as Salt Lake bid for the 
2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The extremes to which bid executives obliged, sharing another $1  
million worth of donated airfares, hotel rooms and shopping with 
IOC members, were unethical, the panel concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	But the panel's report also demonstrated that senior U.S.  
Olympic Committee staffers seemed willing to curry favor with an 
IOC member from Sudan, whose country's athletes were being trained 
in the United States with Salt Lake money. 
</P>
<P>
	And in yet another setback for Olympic leaders, a major sponsor,  
John Hancock Insurance, said it was canceling negotiations with NBC 
for $20 million in ads to protest the IOC's failure to deal with 
the growing scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah Gov. Mike Leavitt suggested every Olympic bid city undergo  
the wrenching self-scrutiny that Salt Lake City has suffered the 
past seven weeks on its path to setting a new standard of 
``forthrightness'' in the Olympic world. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know what happened here was not right. So we're setting it  
right and we're paving the way for others to do the same.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics panel report called on the IOC and USOC to reform,  
including prohibitions on bid cities from having National Olympic 
Committees such as the one that was the conduit for much of Salt 
Lake's excesses. The panel also urged rules with teeth on IOC 
member-bid city relations and regular reporting of money spent on 
IOC members by bid cities. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics panel blamed two men for the pandering: Tom Welch,  
bid committee president, and David Johnson, his vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	While Welch and Johnson were cast as the champions who brought  
the games to Salt Lake, the ethics report also cast them as two 
rogues who turned the city's legitimate lobbying effort into a 
secretive, no-holds-barred mission to win votes. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said the strategy had its roots in Salt Lake's  
four-vote loss to Nagano, Japan, for the 1998 Games. Welch, who 
told investigators he had turned down two offers of IOC influence 
for cash on the eve of that vote, apparently felt he had to up the 
ante if Salt Lake City was ever going to win the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Four IOC members have resigned and five others have been  
expelled so far, and IOC vice president Dick Pound has said his IOC 
commission may use information from Salt Lake City to advance its 
investigation. The resignations and ousters of IOC members in late 
January centered around a preliminary report on that investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the 10 newly implicated IOC members, Phillip Coles of  
Australia and Willi Kaltschmitt of Guatemala appear to have 
benefited the most. 
</P>
<P>
	The two men and their families made four vacation trips together  
to the United States, staying in expensive hotels and enjoying 
recreational outings. One of those trips was to the Super Bowl, and 
Welch and the bid committee picked up the $19,991 tab. 
</P>
<P>
	Austin Sealy of Barbados, another of the 10 newly named IOC  
members, received $3,000 monthly payments through a company 
affiliated with a consultant, according to bid records the panel 
reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
	The others newly implicated were Maj. Gen. Henry Edmund Olufemi  
Adefope, Nigeria; Ashwini Kumar, India; Shagdarjav Magvan, 
Mongolia; Anani Matthia, Togo; Rampaul Ruhee, Mauritius; Siuli Paul 
Wallwork, Western Samoa; and Mohamed Zerguini, Algeria. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the more disturbing findings in the board of ethics  
report provide examples of disgusting and disguised transactions 
and phony contracts,'' said Robert Garff, chairman of the Salt Lake 
Organizing Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The report cited the USOC's involvement by detailing a November  
1995 e-mail exchange among three USOC staff directors. It contained 
repeated references to an agreement to help train athletes from the 
Sudan at USOC facilities as part of Salt Lake City's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of promises were made to secure votes,'' wrote Alfredo  
La Mont, who, at the time, was the USOC's director for 
international relations. 
</P>
<P>
	When Jim Page, the USOC's deputy executive director for  
programs, balked at picking up Salt Lake's portion of the training 
cost after the city was awarded the 2002 Games, Tom Wilkinson, then 
assistant executive director, said it had to be paid because ``a 
deal is a deal and Sudan delivered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``May need Sudan again in future,'' Wilkinson wrote. ``Don't  
burn bridges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That appeared to be a reference to the Sudanese IOC member, Gen.  
Zein El Abdin Ahmed Abdel Gadir, one of the nine IOC delegates who 
have been expelled or resigned. 
</P>
<P>
	The USOC denied that it was part of any quid pro quo.  
</P>
<P>
	``We were committed to help Salt Lake's bid, and to the extent  
that finding places at our training center for qualified athletes 
might have helped convince Sudan's IOC member to vote for it, we 
were pleased to do so. That was proper,'' USOC spokesman Mike Moran 
said. ``But we did not take part in any effort to buy his vote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moran called Wilkinson's comments ``very unfortunate,'' but  
conceded that La Mont's reference to promises connected to votes 
should have triggered some sort of USOC inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	La Mont has since resigned his USOC position.  
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, David D'Alessandro, president and chief operations  
officer of John Hancock, was bitterly critical of most of the IOC 
leadership, including president Juan Antonio Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he stopped talks with NBC to pressure the network -- the  
single biggest revenue source for the IOC with a $3.57 billion 
rights contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to buy a nickel of advertising on NBC until we  
are confident the IOC is going in the right direction,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	While Jean-Claude Ganga, the IOC member from the Republic of  
Congo, got $250,000 -- the highest sum going to any IOC member's 
family -- it could not be determined whether he turned the money 
over to sporting groups in his country, as he claims, Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the committee's more unusual relationships, according to  
the report, were the efforts on behalf of Sonia Essomba, the 
daughter of Rene Essomba of Cameroon, who died in August. Not only 
did it give her $108,350 in tuition and living expenses, but Welch 
dispatched his secretary to help her move furniture to a new 
apartment in Washington and acted as her attorney in breaking her 
old lease. 
</P>
<P>
	Essomba himself got $60,000 in cash from the bid committee.  
</P>
<P>
	Welch and Johnson have denied wrongdoing and on Tuesday, Tom  
Schaffer, Welch's attorney, said the report reinforced what Welch 
has been contending: that there was no bribery, no exchange of 
gifts for votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch contends he was only building friendships with IOC  
members, not buying their votes, and that members of the bid 
committee board were aware of the spending. Leavitt, bid chairman 
Frank Joklik and others named by Welch have repeatedly denied 
knowledge of the details of the gift plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics panel inquiry is just one of five investigations into  
Olympic misconduct. The others include probes by the IOC, USOC, 
Justice Department and Utah attorney general. The General 
Accounting Office, Congress' investigative arm, is moving ahead 
with an inquiry into how the Salt Lake Games are benefiting by what 
is certain to be millions of dollars in federal aid. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics panel conducted hundreds of hours of interviews and  
reviewed 50,000 pages of documents before issuing its report. 
</P>
<P>
	The SLOC, which will stage the games beginning three years from  
this week, will be reorganized Thursday and take up recommendations 
from the ethics panel. Among the recommendations are that SLOC have 
twice yearly reviews of significant spending and that it create an 
ombudsman so employees can report suspicions about ethical lapses.

<HEADLINE> Lack of Small Farm Aid Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Agriculture Department hasn't made enough  
progress in its efforts to help small farmers, say several members 
of a USDA-appointed commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-four of 29 commissioners on USDA's National Commission on  
Small Farms issued a report card Tuesday grading the agency's 
efforts to implement a January 1998 commission report on small 
farms. The commissioners have organized themselves as the Time to 
Act Campaign, an independent effort to get implementation of the 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	Out of 10 categories rated, the agency received higher than a C  
in three areas. The agency rated a ``D'' for its efforts to ensure 
fair market access for those farmers and reach out to farmworkers. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency's highest scores, three ``Bs'', were for its efforts  
to bolster marketing opportunities for small farms, reach out to 
beginning farmers as well as make changes to the crop insurance 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	``In some cases, USDA has acted quickly and decisively,'' the  
report said. ``But in most areas, real change is slow to come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman defended the agency saying  
that while there is still work to do, improvements such as better 
loan programs for small farmers have been implemented. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we've done a lot of good things,'' Glickman said.  
``The fact is, the reversal of the trends towards concentration in 
agriculture and trying to increase family farm agriculture is a 
tough problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since the commission's report last year, thousands of small  
farms -- in both commodities and livestock -- have had a turbulent 
year that included low prices, falling exports and inclement 
weather. 
</P>
<P>
	Growing concern that small farms are being overtaken by big  
business have led to hearings in Congress on concentration in the 
industry, including one Thursday by the House Agriculture 
Committee. Attorney General Janet Reno is scheduled to meet later 
this month with a group of senators who have called for an 
investigation of concentration in all sectors of agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
	``The secretary has not provided strong enough leadership to  
overcome some of the resistance within the bureaucracy towards 
strong action and reversing some of the biases that exist towards 
large scale corporate agriculture,'' said Chuck Hassebrook, a 
commission member from Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
	Added Greg Gunthorp, a commission member and Indiana hog farmer,  
``I think the recommendations of the small farm commission would go 
a long way in promising a level playing field.'' 
</P>

	``We're not asking for somebody to throw a lot of money at the  
problem. We're just asking for a chance,'' Gunthorp said.

<P>
	Farmers could have a better chance if the department implemented  
mandatory price reporting, commissioners said, reiterating a call 
from last year. Under mandatory price reporting, meatpackers would 
have to report the price they pay for livestock. The issue failed 
in the last Congress and is scheduled to come up again this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioners said Glickman already has broad authority that  
would allow him to implement some form of price reporting, a 
provision they say would have helped hog producers now getting 
their lowest prices in 40 years. Glickman disagrees that he has 
such authority.

	3 GOP Sens. Favor Clinton Acquittal  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Three senators from the Northeast today became  
the first Republicans to publicly declare that they will vote to 
acquit President Clinton of both articles of impeachment. The 
announcement by Sens. James Jeffords of Vermont, Arlen Specter of 
Pennsylvania and John Chafee of Rhode Island was the clearest sign 
yet that the Senate would fail to convict Clinton on charges of 
perjury and obstruction of justice. Jeffords said enough 
Republicans may vote against the articles of impeachment to keep 
the final roll calls tomorrow or Friday short of even 51 votes. 
Meanwhile, a Democratic drive to censure Clinton sputtered under 
Republican opposition.

	Judge Orders Pilots To Halt Sickout  
</P>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- A federal judge ordered pilots at American  
Airlines to go back to work tomorrow and end a sickout that has 
grounded 2,500 flights. U.S. District Judge Joe Kendall warned the 
pilots that they could be held in contempt of court if they don't. 
The pilots began calling in sick and refusing overtime Saturday 
after talks broke down with the company about the salaries paid 
pilots of Reno Air, which AMR recently acquired. American pilots 
are barred by federal law from striking over the issue.

	Kosovo Peace Talks Still Divided  
</P>
<P>
	RAMBOUILLET, France (AP) -- After four days of talks, ethnic  
Albanian rebels and Serbs were still divided on a peace plan for 
Kosovo, and mediators have yet to broach the toughest part -- NATO 
deployment in the province. Serb-led Yugoslavia is demanding a 
formal pledge to keep the country's borders intact, while Albanian 
negotiators are calling for a referendum on independence, an 
immediate cease-fire and NATO guarantees for the eventual interim 
settlement. Sources from both sides said that so far, not a single 
line of a draft agreement drawn up by the United States, Russia, 
France, Britain, Germany and Italy has been approved.

	CHAMONIX, France (AP) -- Rescue workers used dogs and sensors  
today in the search for survivors of avalanches that swallowed 
mountain chalets and killed at least 10 people near this popular 
ski resort. At least two people were still missing a day after the 
avalanches roared down a mountainside. Two new avalanches struck 
the Chamonix area today, officials said, but no injuries or 
property damage was reported. Snow continued to fall in other parts 
of Europe, forcing evacuations and stranding thousands in 
Switzerland, Austria and Germany.

	Clinton Urges AmeriCorps Support

<P>
	COLLEGE PARK, Md. (AP) -- President Clinton urged Congress today  
to expand his AmeriCorps volunteerism program, saying young people 
deserve an opportunity to prove they are not ``a generation of 
cynics and slackers.'' AmeriCorps could be a springboard for 
volunteerism at home, much like the Peace Corps was for service 
overseas a generation ago, Clinton said. At a rally at the 
University of Maryland, the president said the number of AmeriCorps 
volunteers could increase by 25 percent if his fiscal 2000 budget 
proposal is approved.

	US Reading Tests Show Improvement

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The newest round of national reading test  
scores show the nation's middle and high school students are 
reading better after a decade of declining scores. The scores for 
12th-graders went up in all reading categories in the 1998 National 
Assessment of Educational Progress. Eighth-graders performed 
somewhat better at their grade level than in previous years. 
Fourth-graders' scores remained about the same. The reading test 
measures a student's ability to read for literary experience, to 
gain information and to perform a task.

rainforest is on the rise again after falling to a six-year low in 
1997, Brazilian scientists said. Preliminary figures from the

forest -- an area larger than Connecticut -- were destroyed last

today that he outlined possible gifts to IOC members in a memo a 
month before the city won the 1996 Games, but that the ideas were 
quickly dropped and never acted on. Payne said he could not recall 
whether he sent the memo, which was addressed to Olympic organizer 
Ginger Watkins, or how long it took before the ideas were rejected.

Jordan's royal family to the core. At the center of the storm is 
Hussein's brother, 51-year-old Prince Hassan, who had been groomed 
as the royal heir for more than three decades. Last month, Hussein 
picked his son, Abdullah, to take the throne after his death. 
Hassan's decision to stay away from the greeting ceremony for King 
Abdullah on Tuesday could show cracks emerging and has made some 
people nervous after 46 years of stability under Hussein. ``There 
is no room for any family rift because that will imperil national 
security and disturb the personal interests of the royal family,''

Senate after an eight-month Justice Department ethics 
investigation. But the veteran diplomat and peacemaker still faces 
hurdles on Capitol Hill. Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., chairman of the 
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, likely will use the nomination 
as an opportunity to press the Clinton administration to support an 
overhaul at the United Nations, congressional sources said Tuesday. 
Helms has not said whether he would support the nomination. 
However, Holbrooke is believed to have wide support in the Senate.

<HEADLINE>  Olympic Report Finds Improper Perks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The U.S. Olympic Committee was linked for  
the first time to possible corruption and 10 more International 
Olympic Committee members were implicated for accepting extravagant 
gifts as part of a widening bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	A 300-page report issued Tuesday by a Salt Lake Organizing  
Committee ethics panel provides the first detailed glimpse of the 
way IOC members -- now numbered at 24, roughly a fifth of IOC 
membership -- had their hands out. The report said there were more 
than $1 million worth of cash payments, scholarships, shopping 
sprees, vacations and medical expenses as Salt Lake bid for the 
2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The extremes to which bid executives obliged, sharing another $1  
million worth of donated airfares, hotel rooms and shopping with 
IOC members, were unethical, the panel concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	But the panel's report also demonstrated that senior U.S.  
Olympic Committee staffers seemed willing to curry favor with an 
IOC member from Sudan, whose country's athletes were being trained 
in the United States with Salt Lake money. 
</P>
<P>
	And in yet another setback for Olympic leaders, a major sponsor,  
John Hancock Insurance, said it was canceling negotiations with NBC 
for $20 million in ads to protest the IOC's failure to deal with 
the growing scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah Gov. Mike Leavitt suggested every Olympic bid city undergo  
the wrenching self-scrutiny that Salt Lake City has suffered the 
past seven weeks on its path to setting a new standard of 
``forthrightness'' in the Olympic world. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know what happened here was not right. So we're setting it  
right and we're paving the way for others to do the same.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics panel report called on the IOC and USOC to reform,  
including prohibitions on bid cities from having National Olympic 
Committees such as the one that was the conduit for much of Salt 
Lake's excesses. The panel also urged rules with teeth on IOC 
member-bid city relations and regular reporting of money spent on 
IOC members by bid cities. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics panel blamed two men for the pandering: Tom Welch,  
bid committee president, and David Johnson, his vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	While Welch and Johnson were cast as the champions who brought  
the games to Salt Lake, the ethics report also cast them as two 
rogues who turned the city's legitimate lobbying effort into a 
secretive, no-holds-barred mission to win votes. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said the strategy had its roots in Salt Lake's  
four-vote loss to Nagano, Japan, for the 1998 Games. Welch, who 
told investigators he had turned down two offers of IOC influence 
for cash on the eve of that vote, apparently felt he had to up the 
ante if Salt Lake City was ever going to win the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Four IOC members have resigned and five others have been  
expelled so far, and IOC vice president Dick Pound has said his IOC 
commission may use information from Salt Lake City to advance its 
investigation. The resignations and ousters of IOC members in late 
January centered around a preliminary report on that investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the 10 newly implicated IOC members, Phillip Coles of  
Australia and Willi Kaltschmitt of Guatemala appear to have 
benefited the most. 
</P>
<P>
	The two men and their families made four vacation trips together  
to the United States, staying in expensive hotels and enjoying 
recreational outings. One of those trips was to the Super Bowl, and 
Welch and the bid committee picked up the $19,991 tab. 
</P>
<P>
	Austin Sealy of Barbados, another of the 10 newly named IOC  
members, received $3,000 monthly payments through a company 
affiliated with a consultant, according to bid records the panel 
reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
	The others newly implicated were Maj. Gen. Henry Edmund Olufemi  
Adefope, Nigeria; Ashwini Kumar, India; Shagdarjav Magvan, 
Mongolia; Anani Matthia, Togo; Rampaul Ruhee, Mauritius; Siuli Paul 
Wallwork, Western Samoa; and Mohamed Zerguini, Algeria. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the more disturbing findings in the board of ethics  
report provide examples of disgusting and disguised transactions 
and phony contracts,'' said Robert Garff, chairman of the Salt Lake 
Organizing Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The report cited the USOC's involvement by detailing a November  
1995 e-mail exchange among three USOC staff directors. It contained 
repeated references to an agreement to help train athletes from the 
Sudan at USOC facilities as part of Salt Lake City's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of promises were made to secure votes,'' wrote Alfredo  
La Mont, who, at the time, was the USOC's director for 
international relations. 
</P>
<P>
	When Jim Page, the USOC's deputy executive director for  
programs, balked at picking up Salt Lake's portion of the training 
cost after the city was awarded the 2002 Games, Tom Wilkinson, then 
assistant executive director, said it had to be paid because ``a 
deal is a deal and Sudan delivered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``May need Sudan again in future,'' Wilkinson wrote. ``Don't  
burn bridges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That appeared to be a reference to the Sudanese IOC member, Gen.  
Zein El Abdin Ahmed Abdel Gadir, one of the nine IOC delegates who 
have been expelled or resigned. 
</P>
<P>
	The USOC denied that it was part of any quid pro quo.  
</P>
<P>
	``We were committed to help Salt Lake's bid, and to the extent  
that finding places at our training center for qualified athletes 
might have helped convince Sudan's IOC member to vote for it, we 
were pleased to do so. That was proper,'' USOC spokesman Mike Moran 
said. ``But we did not take part in any effort to buy his vote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moran called Wilkinson's comments ``very unfortunate,'' but  
conceded that La Mont's reference to promises connected to votes 
should have triggered some sort of USOC inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	La Mont has since resigned his USOC position.  
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, David D'Alessandro, president and chief operations  
officer of John Hancock, was bitterly critical of most of the IOC 
leadership, including president Juan Antonio Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he stopped talks with NBC to pressure the network -- the  
single biggest revenue source for the IOC with a $3.57 billion 
rights contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to buy a nickel of advertising on NBC until we  
are confident the IOC is going in the right direction,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	While Jean-Claude Ganga, the IOC member from the Republic of  
Congo, got $250,000 -- the highest sum going to any IOC member's 
family -- it could not be determined whether he turned the money 
over to sporting groups in his country, as he claims, Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the committee's more unusual relationships, according to  
the report, were the efforts on behalf of Sonia Essomba, the 
daughter of Rene Essomba of Cameroon, who died in August. Not only 
did it give her $108,350 in tuition and living expenses, but Welch 
dispatched his secretary to help her move furniture to a new 
apartment in Washington and acted as her attorney in breaking her 
old lease. 
</P>
<P>
	Essomba himself got $60,000 in cash from the bid committee.  
</P>
<P>
	Welch and Johnson have denied wrongdoing and on Tuesday, Tom  
Schaffer, Welch's attorney, said the report reinforced what Welch 
has been contending: that there was no bribery, no exchange of 
gifts for votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch contends he was only building friendships with IOC  
members, not buying their votes, and that members of the bid 
committee board were aware of the spending. Leavitt, bid chairman 
Frank Joklik and others named by Welch have repeatedly denied 
knowledge of the details of the gift plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics panel inquiry is just one of five investigations into  
Olympic misconduct. The others include probes by the IOC, USOC, 
Justice Department and Utah attorney general. The General 
Accounting Office, Congress' investigative arm, is moving ahead 
with an inquiry into how the Salt Lake Games are benefiting by what 
is certain to be millions of dollars in federal aid. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics panel conducted hundreds of hours of interviews and  
reviewed 50,000 pages of documents before issuing its report. 
</P>
<P>
	The SLOC, which will stage the games beginning three years from  
this week, will be reorganized Thursday and take up recommendations 
from the ethics panel. Among the recommendations are that SLOC have 
twice yearly reviews of significant spending and that it create an 
ombudsman so employees can report suspicions about ethical lapses.

<HEADLINE> Former Blues Executive Sues Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Former St. Louis Blues president Jack Quinn is  
suing the team, citing public criticism and the team's decision to 
stop salary payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Quinn contends the Blues owe him $800,000 in salary, $31,200 for  
a car allowance and $25,000 in medical benefits on a contract that 
he said was guaranteed through Jan. 13, 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	Quinn and former coach and general manager Mike Keenan were  
fired in December 1996. But the Blues retained Quinn as a 
consultant in a $250,000-a-year deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Quinn's lawyer, Merle Silverstein, said the Blues fired Quinn  
and cut off the payments last month after the NHL fined the team 
$1.5 million for alleged wrongdoing in the pursuit of New Jersey 
defenseman Scott Stevens in 1994. The penalty also included the 
loss of a No. 1 draft pick to the Devils. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the Blues must pay Quinn, Silverstein said.  
</P>
<P>
	``The contract was a guaranteed contract; they have to pay it,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A Blues spokesman did not immediately return phone calls seeking  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Quinn's lawsuit, filed Monday in St. Louis Circuit Court, also  
accuses the Blues of violating the ``non-disparagement'' clause of 
their contract with him. At issue are comments made by Blues 
chairman Jerry Ritter following the announcement of the penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blues' actions allegedly included the mailing of an offer  
sheet to Stevens' agent before Stevens became a free agent in 1994; 
and a then-undisclosed side agreement between Quinn and the agent 
to absolve the Blues of $500,000 of a deferred signing bonus owed 
to Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
	After the penalties were announced last month, Ritter said he  
was appalled at the severity of them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm more appalled at the legacy left to the Blues and their  
fans by the management team led by Mike Shanahan and Jack Quinn,'' 
Ritter said. Shanahan was the former chairman of the team.

<HEADLINE> Five Questions With Brendan Fraser </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Brendan Fraser was dug out of the ground in  
``Encino Man,'' ventured out of the jungle in ``George of the 
Jungle'' and, in his latest film, emerged from a bomb shelter after 
35 years in ``Blast From the Past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Indianapolis-born actor has built a reputation on his  
ability to inject some personality, even poignancy, into what could 
have been one-dimensional, fish-out-of-water characters in 
lightweight movies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess I have the market cornered on that role,'' he said in  
a recent interview. ``I gravitate toward it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his acting career, he's also a little on the outside.  
</P>
<P>
	Although his comedic turn as the accident-prone, vine-swinging  
hunk in ``George of the Jungle'' helped propel the Disney film to a 
$105 million domestic gross, Fraser, 30, has yet to reach 
Hollywood's upper echelon of stardom -- and the fat paychecks that 
come with it. 
</P>
<P>
	But that may all be changing.  
</P>
<P>
	Along with ``Blast From the Past,'' he appears in two upcoming  
major films, ``The Mummy'' and a live-action ``Dudley Do-Right.'' 
This follows his standout work in the low-budget independent film, 
``Gods and Monsters,'' in which he held his own against Oscar 
nominee Ian McKellen. 
</P>
<P>
	In this fictional story of horror director James Whale's final  
days, Fraser portrays a gardener who becomes the object of the 
openly gay director's affection. Shot in just 28 days, the film was 
``just a labor of real intense love,'' said Fraser, who calls 
McKellen ``arguably the best actor who walks the planet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The film also generated some behind-the-scenes controversy over  
Fraser's refusal to do a nude scene. Although there was talk he did 
this out of concern for his young fans of ``George of the Jungle,'' 
Fraser insisted his motives were purely artistic. 
</P>
<P>
	``The theme of the film never required for the actor to be  
completely nude on screen,'' he said. ``In the end, 
(director-screenwriter) Bill Condon did agree with me. It would 
strike a false note to have done that. That's not what the movie is 
about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In ``Blast From the Past,'' a comedy about a family that takes  
refuge in an elaborate bomb shelter, Fraser returns to familiar 
ground, as a gentle, good-willed outsider thrust into the modern 
world. Alicia Silverstone plays his love interest. 
</P>
<P>
	1: Describe Adam, your character in ``Blast From the Past.''  
</P>
<P>
	Fraser: Adam is a little bomb shelter naif. He's well brought-up  
by eclectic and eccentric parents. We're not sure if he's a 
testament to their parenting skills or an anomaly because he turns 
out to be such a gentlemen. I looked toward Dick Van Dyke for 
inspiration in this role. I like the energy that he played his 
character with. 
</P>
<P>
	2: Why are you interested in fish-out-of-water roles?  
</P>
<P>
	Fraser: I always find there's a sense of untapped discovery  
playing those sorts of roles. I enjoy it because it allows for 
really doing the actor's work. 
</P>
<P>
	3: How has ``George of the Jungle'' affected your life?  
</P>
<P>
	Fraser: I don't know a 9-year-old who walks the planet who isn't  
a fan right now. They run into me, literally. They come screaming 
and crash into me. It's changed my life immeasurably for the 
positive. It's a real delight. It warms the heart. Also, 'George' 
happened just at the cusp of movie technology, when (computer 
effects) and puppetry are fused. I hope I don't see the day that we 
lose actors altogether. We're almost there. We'll just sort of be 
speaking in microphones. 
</P>
<P>
	4: What was it like shooting ``Gods and Monsters''?  
</P>
<P>
	Fraser: We had 28 days, a budget in the $2.8 million ballpark,  
and when I arrived it was the 'Untitled Ian McKellen Project.' We 
had no film to waste. Every take had to be a bull's-eye. I did it 
because you want to take risks in acting choices sometimes. 'George 
of the Jungle' -- that's a risk in some ways. You can hurt yourself 
making a movie like that. Or like 'Gods and Monsters' -- a film that 
reminds us about how human we all are. 
</P>
<P>
	5: Although you kept your shirt on in ``Blast From the Past,''  
you seem to take a lot of roles requiring little clothing. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraser: That's just kind of the wardrobe. There is none.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls on Profit Taking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar fell against the yen and the euro  
Wednesday, with traders taking profits as Wall Street failed to 
rebound from Tuesday's steep downturn in the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders also were wary that Japan's central bank would succumb  
to noisy political pressure and change monetary policy to fit the 
government's way of fighting Japan's worst recession in decades. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 114.28  
Japanese yen, down from 114.39 late Tuesday. The euro was quoted at 
$1.1331, up from $1.1293. 
</P>
<P>
	With the dollar trading more than two yen above where it started  
the year, currency traders chose to take profits, discouraged by a 
declining Treasury bond market and a mixed showing in the stock 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	``Holding dollars just isn't all that appealing right now,''  
said Kevin Harris, an international economist at MCM Currencywatch. 
``It's time to take profits if you don't like the assets you can 
buy with the dollar.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investors also began positioning in advance of a three-day  
weekend due to Monday's observance of Presidents Day. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those who are cautious don't want to wait until (Thursday) to  
start cleaning up'' their accounts and getting rid of losing bets, 
Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders also noted that Japan's central bank has been under  
severe public pressure to shift its monetary policies to stop 
yields from rising on Japanese government bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on the most widely watched bond in Japan rose until this  
week, providing the yen with underlying strength against the 
dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	Those yields fell again Wednesday, ahead of the central bank's  
policy-making meeting Friday, where the bank may decide to buy its 
own bonds as a way to hike up their prices and lower yields. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's prime minister joined the chorus of top government  
officials Wednesday urging the Bank of Japan to act. The public 
squabble made investors uneasy. 
</P>
<P>
	``These things are supposed to be kept private,'' Harris said.  
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4073 Swiss francs, down from  
1.4211, and 1.4892 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4962. The British 
pound fell to $1.6292 from $1.6364. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on Wednesday's euro rate, the dollar was worth 1.7262  
German marks, down from 1.7319; 5.7904 French francs, down from 
5.80872; and 1,709.40 Italian lire, down from 1,715.27.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Dems To Engage GOP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton, recognizing ``the reality  
of the world,'' is urging fellow Democrats to engage Republicans 
over issues like Social Security as part of his party's effort to 
gain majority control of Congress in next year's elections. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, House Speaker Dennis Hastert says GOP  
congressional leaders would like to meet with Clinton after the 
Senate impeachment trial to discuss the legislative agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we're going to do anything at all and be productive, then  
we have to work with the president,'' Hastert, R-Ill., said on 
``Late Edition'' on CNN. ``That's what the American people, I 
think, expect us to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked how badly impeachment has diminished Clinton's ability to  
win legislation, Hastert told NBC's ``Today'': ``The president is 
still the president. ... He still has to sign bills or veto bills. 
... You have to work with the president to get things done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The remarks highlighted that even before this week's expected  
Senate acquittal of Clinton, both parties are focusing on the 
post-impeachment world. And they are doing so with markedly 
different attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know that you can ever pretend that none of this ever  
happened,'' White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said today. 
``But the reality of the world is Republicans control -- have a 
majority in Congress and we need to work with them and we plan 
to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Worried Republicans are eager to leave the unpopular impeachment  
proceedings behind them in hopes of improving their low standings 
in public opinion polls. Democrats are upbeat, convinced that a 
year spent discussing Social Security, education and other domestic 
issues is a year spent on Democratic terrain that can only help 
them regain the control of the House they lost in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 45-minute session Tuesday with House Democrats at the  
Wintergreen resort in rural western Virginia, Clinton thanked them 
for standing by him over the years and committed himself to helping 
them win in 2000, participants said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said, 'Thank you for all the support you've given me over  
time, going back to 1993, and I'm committed to you in your efforts 
to achieve a majority''' in Congress in next year's voting, said 
Rep. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., a member of the House Democratic 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said the party would be rewarded by voters next year if  
they engage Republicans on policies Americans want. 
</P>
<P>
	Maria Echaveste, the White House deputy chief of staff, said  
Clinton argued that Democrats must be seen as ``standing firm on 
our principles while engaging the Republicans. If we start looking 
for fights, the good will he has built up and the strong 
favorability that the Democrats currently enjoy over the 
Republicans would be put at risk. ... We can't be seen as the ones 
not willing to work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Democrats described a president fatigued from his trip to  
Jordan for King Hussein's funeral, from which he had returned just 
hours earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, they said Clinton discussed a wide range of issues, and  
thanked House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., for his 
decision last week to remain in the House and not challenge Vice 
President Al Gore for the 2000 Democratic presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he was fully committed to doing everything he could to  
make sure Gephardt's decision is rewarded with Gephardt becoming 
speaker,'' said one participant who spoke on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	House Republicans outnumber Democrats 222-211, with one  
Democratic-leaning independent and one vacancy. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert, whose CNN interview was taped Monday, provided few  
details of Republican hopes for meeting with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	But asked whether GOP leaders would accept a presidential  
invitation to visit the White House to discuss substantive issues, 
Hastert said, ``Senator Lott and I were going to ask him to come up 
to the Capitol and talk about the same things, but they may be a 
jump ahead of us. I don't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., is the Senate majority leader.  
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Barry Toiv did not rule anything out.  
</P>
<P>
	``We very much look forward to working with Republicans and  
Democrats,'' he said. ``We have an ambitious agenda to accomplish, 
but we haven't made specific plans at this time for any particular 
meetings.''

<HEADLINE> Prices Rise on Midwest Houses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Midwestern cities recorded some of the biggest  
increases in existing home prices in the nation last year while 
cities in the Northeast registered some of the smallest gains and 
some outright declines. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationally, the median resale price -- meaning half sold for more  
and half for less -- was $131,000 during the October-December 
quarter, up 4.9 percent from the same quarter a year earlier, the 
National Association of Realtors said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	For homeowners, that compares favorably to the fourth  
quarter-to-fourth quarter gain in consumer prices, 1.5 percent. The 
Realtors said median prices of existing homes rose faster than that 
inflation rate in 102 of 129 metropolitan areas. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Realtors' economist Fred Flick cautioned that ``much of  
the overall increase in home prices results from a greater mix of 
more expensive homes being sold.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Regionally, the Midwest showed the strongest gains, 7.1 percent  
to a median of $114,400; followed by the West, 6.9 percent to 
$174,400; the South, 5 percent to $115,300; and the Northeast, 2.9 
percent to $148,200. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the five cities with the largest gains were in  
Michigan. The five were: Lansing, Mich., 15.5 percent; Davenport, 
Iowa, 13.3 percent; Jackson, Miss., 13.2 percent; Kalamazoo, Mich.; 
12.5 percent; and Saginaw Bay, Mich., 12.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen of 129 metro areas reported median price declines. The  
five with the largest declines -- three of them in Florida -- were: 
Sarasota, Fla., 19.8 percent; Melbourne, Fla., 6.6 percent; West 
Palm Beach, Fla., 6.5 percent; Akron, Ohio, 6.2 percent; and 
Monmouth, N.J., 4.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The highest median home price in October-December 1998 was in  
San Francisco, $325,800; followed by Orange County, Calif., 
$264,500; Boston, $214,900; San Diego, $209,200; and Bergen, N.J., 
$208,200. 
</P>
<P>
	Areas with the lowest medians were Waterloo, Iowa, $70,900;  
Beaumont, Texas, $73,600; Ocala, Fla., $73,700; Syracuse, N.Y., 
$75,400; and Topeka, Kan., $76,400.

<HEADLINE> Timeline of Clinton's Poll Standing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Highlights of President Clinton's standing in the polls during a  
year of scandal, testimony and impeachment: 
</P>
<P>
	--January 1998: As the Monica Lewinsky matter surfaces, Clinton's  
job approval rating tops 70 percent, the highest of his presidency. 
Many are skeptical about accusations against him and angry about 
media coverage. Two-thirds remain confident in his leadership 
abilities. Half the population says he should be impeached if he 
lied under oath about the affair. 
</P>
<P>
	--March 1998: Clinton's job approval rating remains strong, with  
about two-thirds saying they approve even as CBS' ``60 Minutes'' 
airs former White House volunteer Kathleen Willey's allegation that 
Clinton made a sexual advance toward her. One-fourth of the public 
says there is enough evidence in the Lewinsky case to begin 
impeachment hearings. The number who say he should be impeached if 
he lied under oath dips to about 40 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--June 1998: The president's approval rating settles above 60  
percent, as a majority of Americans decide Independent Counsel 
Kenneth Starr is politically motivated. Strong job approval for 
Clinton closely tracks optimism over the economy. The number who 
want Clinton impeached, based on what they know about the scandal, 
is about one in five. 
</P>
<P>
	--August 1998: Clinton's approval rating remains above 60  
percent. Most people say they think the president lied about his 
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, but the number who say he should be 
impeached if he lied under oath levels off at just over 30 percent. 
It stays there through the impeachment process. 
</P>
<P>
	--September 1998: Clinton has a topsy-turvy month. After Starr  
releases his report, sentiment for Clinton's impeachment edges up 
to 35 percent and his job approval dips into the mid-50s. By the 
end of the month, the number favoring impeachment dips below 30 
percent after the videotape of the president's low-key testimony to 
the grand jury is broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
	--November 1998: With sentiment for impeachment still below 30  
percent, Democrats gain five House seats in the election. Clinton's 
job approval climbs back into the mid-60s. His ratings on personal 
trust and moral values are low. 
</P>
<P>
	--December 1998: Congress continues its impeachment proceedings  
despite public opinion that the matter should be dropped. After the 
House votes to impeach him, Clinton's job approval tops 70 percent 
for the first time since January. About one-third of Americans want 
him impeached and removed from office. 
</P>
<P>
	--January 1999: The president's job approval hovers in the  
mid-60s as he gives a well-received State of the Union address. 
Republicans acknowledge that impeachment efforts have hurt them in 
the polls. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings come from polls by the Pew Research Center for the  
People and the Press and CNN/USA Today/Gallup.

<HEADLINE> Iverson Slumps but 76ers Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Allen Iverson's eyes still light up when he  
gets the ball in his hands. His expression changes once he releases 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	The ball goes up and Iverson winces like a player in a major  
shooting slump. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the Philadelphia 76ers' star point guard is having fun  
lately. But it has nothing to do with 40- or 50-point games. The 
surprising 76ers are unbeaten even though Iverson is missing 73 
percent of his shots. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who knows what will happen when I play a good game,'' Iverson  
said. ``Whenever that may be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 76ers, 3-0 for the first time since 1984, are winning with  
defense and balanced scoring. Even Iverson can't believe it. Since 
Philadelphia made him the No. 1 pick in the draft in 1996, Iverson 
has been a raw, relentless scorer. 
</P>
<P>
	He had little help in his first two seasons, and the 76ers kept  
losing. 
</P>
<P>
	While making a push for the rookie of the year award in 1996, he  
made plenty of enemies when he broke Wilt Chamberlain's record with 
four straight 40-point games. He scored 50 in Cleveland in the 
record-breaking game, leaving a hostile crowd with no choice but to 
give him a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, the 76ers were well out of the playoff hunt by then,  
lending credence to Iverson's reputation as a supposedly selfish 
player who cared only about his stats. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, he's too busy winning games to worry about numbers -- even  
if his numbers are atrocious. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I came out and was scoring all those 40- and 50-point  
games, we were losing every time because nobody else was getting 
involved. ... I can't come out and score 35, 36 points every night 
and then come up with L's. I mean, we need other guys to play 
basketball,'' Iverson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Apparently, the 76ers listen to their 23-year-old leader.  
</P>
<P>
	A swarming defense is anchored by twin towers Theo Ratliff and  
Matt Geiger, who combined for eight of the team's season-high 13 
blocks in a 90-86 victory over the Detroit Pistons on Tuesday 
night. Harvey Grant, one of the top defensive forwards in the 
league, kept Grant Hill under control and had four blocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill, coming off a career-high 46 points against Washington,  
scored 32 points against the 76ers on 11-for-18 shooting. Iverson 
had 19 points, but was 6-for-20 from the field. He's averaging only 
16.7 points and has made only 15 of 55 shots in the three games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm resorting back to my high school ways where I used to miss  
shots and get frustrated,'' Iverson said. ``These last three games 
have been tough offensively for me, but I was just trying to do the 
other things on the court, just stay involved with everything. We 
have people who are putting the ball in the hole.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Geiger, who signed a $52 million, six-year contract as a free  
agent, is giving Ratliff some much needed help in the middle. 
Though disjointed and even clumsy at times, the 7-foot-1 center has 
allowed Ratliff to move to his natural position of power forward, 
where he is wreaking havoc with 11 blocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're definitely playing well, things are going good and we're  
winning ball games,'' Geiger said. ``But if we were 0-3, I wouldn't 
say we're the worst team and we're not going to make the playoffs. 
It's the same with 3-0. We're not going to win every game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Larry Brown's decision to move Tim Thomas from the  
starting lineup to the bench has paid off. Thomas had 10 points in 
15 minutes on Tuesday night after scoring 13 points in 14 minutes 
in a 95-75 victory over Orlando in the home opener. 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie Larry Hughes has looked overmatched at times, but he came  
off the bench to score 16 points against the Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson, whose nickname is the Answer because his line of shoes  
bears that name, isn't the only one any more. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy. I'm not frustrated at all,'' Iverson said. ``As  
long as there's tomorrow, everything's all right with me. I could 
play 10 more bad games in a row as long as we win.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	Five days into the NBA season, only four teams remain  
undefeated. 
</P>
<P>
	It's no surprise in the West that Utah and Seattle are both 3-0,  
but look who's unblemished in the East -- Milwaukee and 
Philadelphia! 
</P>
<P>
	The Jazz, Sonics, Bucks and 76ers all won Tuesday night to keep  
their perfect records intact. 
</P>
<P>
	Karl Malone scored 31 points as Utah improved to 3-0 for the  
first time in a decade by beating Dallas 90-79. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Payton scored 20 and the SuperSonics had an easy time  
against Golden State, beating the Warriors 90-71 for Seattle's 
first 3-0 start since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray Allen took a hard fall to the floor while battling for a  
rebound with Charles Oakley, but returned in the fourth quarter to 
start a game-breaking run as the Bucks (2-0) beat the Toronto 
Raptors 91-77. 
</P>
<P>
	Theo Ratliff had 10 points, nine rebounds and five of  
Philadelphia's season-high 13 blocks as the Sixers improved to 3-0 
for the first time since 1984-85 by defeating previously unbeaten 
Detroit 90-86. 
</P>
<P>
	In other NBA games, Boston defeated Miami 108-101, Minnesota  
plodded past San Antonio 74-70, Atlanta defeated Chicago 87-71 and 
Sacramento topped Phoenix 112-95. 
</P>
<P>
	``Utah may be the best team in the league now,'' said Cedric  
Ceballos of the Mavericks, whose team hung with the Jazz for 3 1/2 
quarters before Malone led a late charge that iced the win. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah, which also beat the Lakers and Bulls, has never started  
4-0 in the 25-year history of the franchise. That chance will come 
Thursday night at Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	Malone, who scored 21 and 28 points against the Bulls and  
Lakers, put the Jazz ahead 76-74 with a bucket with 6:37 to go, and 
Dallas folded after that. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just keep scratching and clawing for every victory,'' John  
Stockton said. ``We showed again we can play defense when we need 
to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Howard Eisley had 11 points for the Jazz, making him the only  
other Utah player in double figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas coach Don Nelson said Utah showed why it should be  
favored to win the NBA championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``They did what great teams are supposed to do,'' Nelson said.  
``They just picked up apart in the fourth quarter. We played very 
well for three quarters, but good teams turn it on in the fourth 
period.'' 
</P>
<P>
                     *SuperSonics 90, Warriors 71    	
</P>
<P>
	At Seattle, the Sonics took care of this one early, allowing the  
reserves to play the entire fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Rashard Lewis, the Sonics' second-round pick out of high school,  
punctuated the victory with 17 seconds left on a slam dunk off a 
feed by Moochie Norris. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle coach Paul Westphal gave Don MacLean and rookies  
Vladimir Stepania, Lewis and Jelani McCoy their first playing time 
of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was great to get a couple of minutes and get the feel of an  
NBA game,'' Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sonics center Olden Polynice made his first 3-pointer since the  
1995-96 season, and Vin Baker went 0-for-4 from the line -- making 
him 0-for-10 for the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're 3-0 and that's great. I look at myself and think about  
what we can do once I start clicking,'' Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
                        *Bucks 91, Raptors 77    	
</P>
<P>
	Toronto rookie Vince Carter led all scorers with 22 points and  
brought the 14,577 fans at Maple Leafs Garden to their feet by 
finishing off an alley-oop pass from Dee Brown to cut the Bucks' 
lead to 72-70 with 6:50 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	But Allen followed with a pair of free throws to start an 11-0  
run capped by Vinny Del Negro's uncontested layup for an 81-70 lead 
with 3:48 to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a fourth-quarter team,'' Allen said. ``If the game is up  
and down in the fourth, we're a shoo-in to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glenn Robinson finished with 16 points, Dell Curry added 15 and  
Terrell Brandon 14. 
</P>
<P>
                        *76ers 90, Pistons 86    	
</P>
<P>
	At Philadelphia, Matt Geiger had 16 points and three blocks, and  
Harvey Grant recorded the other four rejections in a swat-fest that 
handed the Pistons their first loss in four games.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Bronco Charged in Moose Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OGDEN, Utah (AP) -- Former Denver Broncos lineman Rulon Jones was  
charged with three misdemeanors in connection with the illegal 
shooting of a moose in the Ogden Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	Weber County Deputy Attorney Bill Daines said Wednesday the  
charges carry penalties of up to a $1,000 fine and six months in 
jail. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges also jeopardize Jones' state permit that allows him  
an extended hunting season on his private land in exchange for 
allowing a few public hunters to hunt his property without charge. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although the charges are all misdemeanors, they are serious  
enough that the council will give serious consideration to some 
kind of punitive action,'' said Richard Diamond, chairman of the 
advisory council for the Northern Region of the Division of 
Wildlife Resources. 
</P>
<P>
	The council approves permits for Jones' Ogden Valley wildlife  
management unit. 
</P>
<P>
	The moose kill took place Nov. 3; moose hunting season ended  
Oct. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	The hunter who shot the moose was not charged. The southern Utah  
man had drawn a public permit to hunt the moose on Jones' private 
property, but it was Jones' responsibility to provide information 
on when he could hunt, wildlife officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, who could not be reached for comment Wednesday, has said  
he only went out with the hunter to provide him the same kind of 
quality experience he provides his paying customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones has said the shooting of the moose after the hunting  
season had closed ``was an honest mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The charges include aiding and assisting in the unlawful taking  
of protected wildlife, failure to properly post a cooperative 
wildlife management unit and failure to provide written guidelines 
to each holder of an authorization or permit. 
</P>
<P>
	Northern Region wildlife supervisor Robert Hasenyager said he is  
glad charges have finally been filed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just hope it puts to rest the perception that Jones, because  
of his athletic fame, was receiving preferential treatment from our 
division,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, who played football at Utah State, was a Bronco defensive  
end from 1980-88.

<HEADLINE> Official: Wynette's Death Natural </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Tammy Wynette died from natural causes  
and there is no reason to exhume her body for an autopsy, a medical 
examiner said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the country singer's daughters asked Nashville Medical  
Examiner Bruce Levy to review the case. 
</P>
<P>
	They say they are suspicious because the police report said the  
only drugs Wynette was taking at the time of her death were 
antibiotics. They say she was on various prescribed pain 
medications, including Stadol, Valium, and Demerol. 
</P>
<P>
	Levy said he spoke with Wynette's physician, Dr. Wallis Marsh,  
and reviewed her medical records and has no doubt the cause of 
death was blood clots in her lungs. 
</P>
<P>
	Wynette's body was found by her husband-manager George Richey in  
their Nashville home last April. Marsh pronounced her dead. No 
autopsy was performed. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Warlick, the daughters' lawyer, said they would continue  
pushing for an autopsy. 
</P>
<P>
	Wynette, 55, had 20 No. 1 hits including ``Stand By Your Man.''

<HEADLINE> Some Tips for Your Small Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- In recent years, owners who want to incorporate  
their small business often are encouraged to elect the S 
corporation form for tax purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	But while the S corporation offers many advantages, C  
corporations may be a more appropriate choice at times, 
particularly when it comes to saving for retirement, says a 
retirement expert at the College for Financial Planning. And 
sometimes the tax advantages of the C corporation even outweigh 
those of the S corporation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The C corporation offers, in many cases, greater advantages to  
owners who wish to set aside significant funds for retirement and 
to fund certain benefits with before-tax dollars,'' says Jim Stone, 
an academic associate at the college. 
</P>
<P>
	The arguments for choosing the S corporation form for the small  
business are powerful. The biggest advantage is that profits are 
passed directly through the corporation to the owner (and any other 
shareholders), where they are taxed at the owner's level. This 
pass-through means the profits aren't taxed twice, unlike a C 
corporation, where profits are taxed first at the corporate level 
and then at the owner's level when they are passed on as dividends. 
The second advantage of the pass-through is that the profits passed 
on to the owner are not subject to FICA taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Attractive as this appears, there are disadvantages to the S  
corporation form, Stone cautions. ``For small companies, the chief 
disadvantage is the lack of tax-favored status for many benefits 
such as health insurance, disability insurance and cafeteria 
plans,'' Stone says. 
</P>
<P>
	Stone compares three scenarios showing the trade-offs between  
the S and C corporation forms. 
</P>
<P>
	Say you own a small business that has gross earnings for the  
year of $150,000, after you've paid all overhead expenses excluding 
your own salary. If you aren't interested in health benefits 
(perhaps they are available through your spouse's employer), 
retirement benefits or any other type of employee benefits, the S 
corporation is probably the best choice, Stone says. 
</P>
<P>
	Because S corporation owners can choose their own salary, with  
the remainder being distributed as ``K-1'' income, Stone chooses a 
scenario that pays a small salary of $31,000, with only a small 
retirement plan contribution and limited health benefits. After 
FICA taxes (on the salary), income taxes and other deductions, the 
owner ends up with roughly $96,000 in spendable income. 
</P>
<P>
	In a second scenario, the S corporation owner takes out a  
maximum salary of roughly $112,000. This time the owner contributes 
to a money purchase retirement plan of 25 percent of his earned 
income -- approximately $28,000 -- leaving him with a little over 
$75,000 in spendable income. 
</P>
<P>
	However, if the owner really wants the maximum in health and  
retirement benefits, ``then the C corporation begins to emerge as 
the best option,'' Stone says. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a C corporation, the owner could set aside for health  
insurance, medical reimbursement under a cafeteria plan, put 25 
percent of his earned income toward a retirement plan ($27,000) and 
still end up with $83,000 in spendable income. 
</P>
<P>
	Stone then takes the scenario a step further by calculating the  
kind of retirement nest egg the owner could build in these three 
situations. In each case, the nest egg earns an annual before-tax 
return of 10 percent for 16 years. The owner who takes out only a 
small salary and invests the remaining income on an after-tax (at 
7.2 percent) basis would generate roughly $842,000 by the end of 16 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking the maximum salary and contributing to the money purchase  
plan would build a nest egg of just over $1 million. But under the 
C corporation status, the owner would build a nest egg of over $1.2 
million, in addition to the superior employee benefit plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Stone emphasizes that not only are the retirement benefits under  
a C corporation often superior to those of an S corporation, 
sometimes even the tax benefits are superior despite the double 
taxation issue. 
</P>
<P>
	He takes the case of a couple whose combined income is $250,000.  
A company they own earns them an additional $100,000 in profit this 
year and $50,000 in profit in each of the next two years. Under the 
S corporation form, they'll pay roughly $116,000 in total taxes the 
first year, and slightly under $100,000 the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet under the C corporation, assuming the owners bonus $50,000  
each year to themselves, they pay only $107,000 in taxes the first 
year, and the same in taxes as the S corporation the next two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``The S-corporation election is more complicated than it  
appears,'' Stone says. ``As with every major business decision, the 
S or C corporation election should be analyzed from the aspect of 
the owner's goals and the potential advantages and disadvantages.''

<HEADLINE> NE Medical Mag Supports JAMA Editor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The editor in chief of a top U.S. medical journal says the  
firing of another publication's editor was ``an irrational decision 
and an ominous precedent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. George Lundberg was fired from the Journal of the American  
Medical Association on Jan. 15 for publishing a 1991 survey of 
college students on whether oral sex constitutes sex. 
</P>
<P>
	AMA executive vice president E. Ratcliffe Anderson Jr. accused  
Lundberg of inappropriately injecting the AMA into a political 
debate by deliberately running the study during President Clinton's 
impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	In an editorial in today's New England Journal of Medicine,  
editor in chief Dr. Jerome Kassirer said a medical journal should 
be a ``lively forum'' for the discussion of important issues, even 
if they involve medicine only indirectly. 
</P>
<P>
	He added: ``I believe that medical editors have an obligation to  
publish not only articles that are well-reasoned, informative and 
carefully reviewed, but also ones that are sufficiently timely to 
contribute to the development of public policy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kassirer cited several articles that he, too, ``put on a fast  
track in order to be topical.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview, however, he said that as far as the survey's  
scientific value, it was ``certainly something I never would have 
published.''

<HEADLINE>  2 GOP Sens. Say They'll Acquit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican support for convicting and removing  
President Clinton waned today as senators debated impeachment for a 
second day behind closed doors. Two GOP senators announced they 
would reject both the perjury and obstruction of justice charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Sens. James Jeffords of Vermont and Arlen Specter of  
Pennsylvania said they would not support allegations of perjury and 
obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Specter, citing the laws of Scotland, said there could be  
``three possible verdicts: guilty, not guilty, not proved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the option in this trial, I suspect many senators would  
choose 'not proved' instead of 'not guilty,''' the Pennsylvania 
Republican said in a statement that he planned to deliver on the 
Senate floor 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffords said Clinton had committed shameful acts but his  
offenses ``do not reach the high standard of impeachment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other senators' decisions announced today were not a surprise.  
Democrat Tom Harkin of Iowa left the chamber to read reporters his 
statement in favor of acquittal. Sen. Dick Lugar, R-Ind., said he 
would vote to convict on both articles. 
</P>
<P>
	Harkin said the House had presented ``a counterfeit case'' based  
on the efforts of ``an out-of-control independent counsel with a 
blank check.'' He predicted that only one-third of the Senate would 
vote for the perjury article. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said that ``if at  
all possible'' he would like to set a vote for 5 p.m. EST Thursday 
on whether to convict Clinton on the perjury and obstruction of 
justice charges -- votes that by all signs will fall far short of 
the two-thirds majority needed to oust the nation's 42nd president. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we still have speeches and we can't do it then we will  
certainly go over to Friday but I think we need to begin to talk 
about that goal,'' Lott said at the opening of today's trial 
session. The Senate sergeant at arms then closed the doors so the 
debate could begin in private for a second day. 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, spokesman Joe Lockhart said the president is  
``open to the idea of censure.'' But Lockhart added, ``I don't 
think it's appropriate for us to indicate or try to prescribe'' 
punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton will probably have something to say after the Senate  
votes, Lockhart said. The White House has been sensitive to 
possible criticism if Clinton appears to gloat over the likely 
acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
	Both inside and outside the chamber today, GOP senators raised  
doubts about support for a censure or rebuke of the president if he 
is acquitted on the two articles of impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's been very little mention of censure,'' Sen. Bill  
Frist, R-Tenn., said before today's proceedings. ``To me, the push 
for censure is losing steam.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Frist indicated that the debate Tuesday was lawyerly on the  
article alleging that Clinton committed perjury before a grand jury 
-- an accusation some Republicans have suggested they may not 
support in the final vote. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Frist's GOP colleagues, Slade Gorton of Washington,  
disclosed in the four-hour debate Tuesday he opposes the perjury 
article but supports the article accusing Clinton of obstruction of 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president should be removed from office for obstruction of  
justice,'' Gorton said during the debate. He released his remarks 
afterward. ``Although the president lied, this specific case of 
perjury does not rise to a level requiring removal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senators from both parties acknowledge Clinton is assured of  
acquittal because the two-thirds margin for conviction cannot be 
attained. Many were slow to get to the chamber this morning for the 
second day of deliberations, raising concerns from Sen. Patrick 
Leahy, D-Vt. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we're going to be off at committee meetings, I don't think  
that does service to the intent of this closed door hearing. ... 
Nothing could be more important than this on our agenda today and 
tomorrow,'' Leahy said. 
</P>
<P>
	For days, senators have been forecasting a stronger conviction  
vote on the obstruction-of-justice article than on a perjury count 
that might not attain even a majority. 
</P>
<P>
	If Clinton is acquitted as expected, several Republicans  
expressed a willingness Tuesday to end the impeachment ordeal 
without further action -- leaving it to historians, rather than a 
Senate censure, to judge his efforts to cover up an extramarital 
affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	The censure idea is ``a rose that is beginning to wilt,'' said  
Sen. Larry Craig of Idaho, a member of the Senate Republican 
leadership. Some Democrats, he said, want a censure because they're 
``seeking cover'' for their expected acquittal votes. 
</P>
<P>
	However, a censure resolution -- either immediately following the  
trial or later -- remained a possibility because Republican 
opposition was being countered by support from most Democrats and a 
handful of GOP senators. 
</P>
<P>
	To have a such a measure considered in the 100-member Senate,  
supporters would need 60 votes to hurdle an expected stalling 
action by Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, the leading opponent of a 
censure. He believes a censure violates the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Senate debated his fate Tuesday, Clinton traveled to  
western Virginia for a private meeting with House Democrats holding 
their annual retreat. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Robert Menendez of New Jersey, a member of the House  
Democratic leadership, said the president never overtly mentioned 
impeachment. But, ``He said, 'Thank you for all the support you've 
given me over time, going back to 1993, and I'm committed to you in 
your efforts to achieve a majority''' in the elections in 2000.

<HEADLINE> Airline On-Time Performance Studied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The airline told the government its plane left  
on time, but stopwatches held by federal investigators showed the 
cabin door had remained open for another eight minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Discrepancies such as that prompted the Transportation  
Department's inspector general to recommend Wednesday that the 
government revise the procedures it uses for gathering statistics 
to rate the airlines' on-time performances. 
</P>
<P>
	Inspectors found the 10 major airlines reporting departure  
information use four different methods for defining when their 
planes have ``departed.'' A similar inspector general report last 
year found problems with how airlines calculated flight arrival 
information. 
</P>
<P>
	Airlines regularly use the arrival results in their  
advertisements, and both the departure and arrival information is 
used in reports issued by the Transportation Department. 
</P>
<P>
	``Differences between these methods could result in an aircraft  
being reported as departing on time when another aircraft -- in the 
same situation -- could be reported as departing late,'' wrote 
Lawrence Weintrob, assistant inspector general for auditing. 
</P>
<P>
	An airline spokesman said carriers favor uniformity but question  
whether the departure discrepancies are a problem. ``Are people 
moving ahead in the rankings because of this?'' asked David Fuscus, 
spokesman for the Air Transport Association. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the inspector general said the rankings were not  
affected because they relate to arrival, not departure. 
</P>
<P>
	The inspection found that airlines use different standards for  
defining ``departure'': releasing an aircraft parking brake, 
rolling an aircraft's wheels, closing the passenger and-or cargo 
doors and closing its doors and releasing the parking brake. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators also went into the field and watched when doors  
closed and planes rolled away from the gate. They then compared 
that with the data the airline later supplied to the government. 
</P>
<P>
	In one case, an air carrier, which was not identified, reported  
that a plane's wheels were rolling eight minutes before inspectors 
saw the door closed and 10 minutes before they saw the wheels start 
to turn. 
</P>
<P>
	The inspectors said two air carriers, also not identified, may  
report inaccurate times because they rely on self-reporting by 
pilots rather than computerized data collection. 
</P>
<P>
	``An executive vice president of one of the air carriers pointed  
to the financial incentives for flight crews to report early 
departures,'' since on-time performance is rewarded, the report 
said.

</P>
<P>
	``There's been very little mention of censure,'' Sen. Bill  
Frist, R-Tenn., said before today's proceedings. ``To me, the push 
for censure is losing steam.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Frist indicated that the debate Tuesday was lawyerly on the  
article alleging that Clinton committed perjury before a grand jury 
-- an accusation some Republicans have suggested they may not 
support in the final vote. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Frist's GOP colleagues, Slade Gorton of Washington,  
disclosed in the four-hour debate Tuesday he opposes the perjury 
article but supports the article accusing Clinton of obstruction of 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president should be removed from office for obstruction of  
justice,'' Gorton said during the debate. He released his remarks 
afterward. ``Although the president lied, this specific case of 
perjury does not rise to a level requiring removal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senators from both parties acknowledge Clinton is assured of  
acquittal because the two-thirds margin for conviction cannot be 
attained. Many were slow to get to the chamber this morning for the 
second day of deliberations, raising concerns from Sen. Patrick 
Leahy, D-Vt. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we're going to be off at committee meetings, I don't think  
that does service to the intent of this closed door hearing. ... 
Nothing could be more important than this on our agenda today and 
tomorrow,'' Leahy said. 
</P>
<P>
	For days, senators have been forecasting a stronger conviction  
vote on the obstruction-of-justice article than on a perjury count 
that might not attain even a majority. 
</P>
<P>
	If Clinton is acquitted as expected, several Republicans  
expressed a willingness Tuesday to end the impeachment ordeal 
without further action -- leaving it to historians, rather than a 
Senate censure, to judge his efforts to cover up an extramarital 
affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	The censure idea is ``a rose that is beginning to wilt,'' said  
Sen. Larry Craig of Idaho, a member of the Senate Republican 
leadership. Some Democrats, he said, want a censure because they're 
``seeking cover'' for their expected acquittal votes. 
</P>
<P>
	However, a censure resolution -- either immediately following the  
trial or later -- remained a possibility because Republican 
opposition was being countered by support from most Democrats and a 
handful of GOP senators. 
</P>
<P>
	To have a such a measure considered in the 100-member Senate,  
supporters would need 60 votes to hurdle an expected stalling 
action by Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, the leading opponent of a 
censure. He believes a censure violates the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Senate debated his fate Tuesday, Clinton traveled to  
western Virginia for a private meeting with House Democrats holding 
their annual retreat. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Robert Menendez of New Jersey, a member of the House  
Democratic leadership, said the president never overtly mentioned 
impeachment. But, ``He said, 'Thank you for all the support you've 
given me over time, going back to 1993, and I'm committed to you in 
your efforts to achieve a majority''' in the elections in 2000.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Deliberations Resume </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With television cameras turned off and the  
public galleries emptied, senators returned today to their debate 
over whether to remove President Clinton from office amid signs 
that the perjury article and the idea of a post-trial censure may 
be losing support from some Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said that ``if at all  
possible'' he would like to set a vote for 5 p.m. EST Thursday on 
whether to convict Clinton on the perjury and obstruction of 
justice charges -- votes that by all signs will fall far short of 
the two-thirds majority needed to oust the nation's 42nd president. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we still have speeches and we can't do it then we will  
certainly go over to Friday but I think we need to begin to talk 
about that goal,'' Lott said at the opening of today's trial 
session. The Senate sergeant at arms then closed the doors so the 
debate could begin for a second day. 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, spokesman Joe Lockhart said the president is  
``open to the idea of censure.'' But Lockhart added, ``I don't 
think it's appropriate for us to indicate or try to prescribe'' 
punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton will probably have something to say after the Senate  
votes, Lockhart said. The White House has been sensitive to 
possible criticism if Clinton appears to gloat over the likely 
acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
	Both inside and outside the chamber today, GOP senators raised  
doubts about support for a censure or rebuke of the president if he 
is acquitted on the two articles of impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's been very little mention of censure,'' Sen. Bill  
Frist, R-Tenn., said before today's proceedings. ``To me, the push 
for censure is losing steam.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Frist indicated that the debate Tuesday was lawyerly on the  
article alleging that Clinton committed perjury before a grand jury 
-- an accusation some Republicans have suggested they may not 
support in the final vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there are strong arguments on both sides, both for  
perjury and against perjury. So I don't know what the outcome will 
be,'' the senator said. ``People are getting hung up on lawyerly 
talk and lawyer's language.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of Frist's GOP colleagues, Slade Gorton of Washington,  
disclosed in the four-hour debate Tuesday he opposes the perjury 
article but supports the article accusing Clinton of obstruction of 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president should be removed from office for obstruction of  
justice,'' Gorton said during the debate. He released his remarks 
afterward. ``Although the president lied, this specific case of 
perjury does not rise to a level requiring removal.''

trial or later -- remained a possibility because Republican 
opposition was being countered by support from most Democrats and a 
handful of GOP senators. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, said the proposal ``is  
waning as an option -- alive but on life support.'' But Sen. John 
Chafee, R-R.I., cautioned that ``No one should be compiling a dirge 
over censure; if anything, I believe we are picking up support on 
the both sides of the aisle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To have a such a measure considered in the 100-member Senate,  
supporters would need 60 votes to hurdle an expected stalling 
action by Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, the leading opponent of a 
censure. He believes a censure violates the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig said the closed-door speeches ``are not all ... dynamic,''  
and about four or five senators asked questions of their colleagues 
such as ``Why do you believe that?'' or ``Where did you find that'' 
in the trial record?'' 
</P>
<P>
	In all, 18 senators spoke the first day, Republicans alternating  
with Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are very respectful of one another. It's a very  
dignified climate,'' said Sen. Paul Wellstone, a Minnesota 
Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Senate debated his fate, Clinton traveled to western  
Virginia for a private meeting with House Democrats holding their 
annual retreat. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Robert Menendez of New Jersey, a member of the House

given me over time, going back to 1993, and I'm committed to you in 
your efforts to achieve a majority''' in the elections in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Senate galleries cleared, and House prosecutors and  
presidential lawyers barred, the first day of deliberations lasted 
from 1:52 p.m. until 6:27 p.m., with one short break. Each senator 
was allowed to speak for up to 15 minutes, but with the television 
cameras unplugged, not all were choosing to take all their time -- 
or speak at all. 
</P>
<P>
	All senators will be able to place statements explaining their  
votes in the Congressional Record after the trial -- or they could 
simply release their remarks as Gorton did.

<HEADLINE> Aides Attend Secret Senate Sessions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Like a skeleton crew operating a ship, a mere  
three dozen aides are in attendance as senators deliberate secretly 
in the waning days of the impeachment trial of President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Barred from their familiar perches on the Senate floor are the  
White House lawyers and House managers who prosecuted the case. 
Forbidden are aides from senators' personal staffs and committees, 
always bristling with technical information and armloads of paper. 
Even the teen-age pages who normally scurry around with documents 
and glasses of cold water for senators are gone. 
</P>
<P>
	And those who are allowed in have sworn to ``never divulge,  
publish or reveal by writing, word, conduct or otherwise, for any 
purpose'' anything that happens. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really buttoned down,'' said Sen. Frank Lautenberg,  
D-N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the 100 senators, Chief Justice William Rehnquist is  
there, accompanied by an assistant or two, participants say. Senate 
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and Senate Minority Leader Tom 
Daschle, D-S.D., have three aides apiece. No. 2 GOP leader Don 
Nickles of Oklahoma has two assistants, and No. 2 Democratic leader 
Harry Reid of Nevada has used one. 
</P>
<P>
	Two others familiar to television viewers of the trial also  
attend. They are James Ziglar, the sergeant-at-arms, who each day 
reads an ancient oath warning that disruptions will be met with 
``pain of imprisonment''; and the Rev. Lloyd Ogilvie, the 
sonorous-voiced Senate chaplain who opens each session with a 
prayer. 
</P>
<P>
	Stenographers rotate every 15 minutes, recording a transcript of  
proceedings that may never be shown to the public. The Senate's 
secretary, legal counsel, parliamentarian and members of their 
staffs also attend. 
</P>
<P>
	Also given floor privileges is an aide to Sen. Max Cleland,  
D-Ga., who needs help transferring from his wheelchair to his 
Senate chair. 
</P>
<P>
	As for senators' cold water, that still gets delivered to  
Republicans by David Hoppe and Eric Ueland, top aides respectively 
to Lott and Nickles. It could not be immediately learned who is 
performing that function on the Democratic side.

<HEADLINE> Lawyers Seek $15M in Smoking Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The same jury that awarded a former  
three-pack-a-day smoker $1.5 million in her lawsuit against Philip 
Morris Cos. was asked on Wednesday to award her $15 million in 
punitive damages to send a message to the tobacco giant. 
</P>
<P>
	Patricia Henley, 53, who was diagnosed last year with inoperable  
lung cancer, alleged the tobacco company hooked her on cigarettes 
when she was 15 and misled her about the dangers. 
</P>
<P>
	Henley's attorney, Madelyn Chaber, said punitive damages are the  
only way to get the attention of a $3.5 billion company. The jury 
Tuesday awarded compensatory damages of $1.5 million to cover 
medical costs, pain and suffering. 
</P>
<P>
	William Ohlemeyer, who represents the tobacco company, refused  
to comment until the case is over. 
</P>
<P>
	But Philip Morris stock fell 8.7 percent Wednesday as the most  
active issue on the New York Stock Exchange, dropping $3.93 3/4 to 
close at $41.43 3/4 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is California's first since the repeal of a 1987 state  
law that banned such lawsuits under the notion that the risks of 
smoking were well known. Dozens of cases pending at the time were 
dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, then-state Attorney General Dan Lungren joined justice  
officials in other states in suing the tobacco industry, and the 
Legislature responded to criticism of the ban by repealing it. 
</P>
<P>
	The tobacco industry came to a $206 billion legal settlement  
with states in November, but cigarette makers still face class 
action suits and individual suits by smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	However, jury awards in such cases are rare.  
</P>
<P>
	A Florida appeals court earlier this year overturned a  
Jacksonville jury's $1 million judgment for the family of a dead 
smoker against Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, another Jacksonville jury awarded $750,000 to a man who  
blamed his lung cancer on smoking. Last June, an appeals court 
threw out the verdict, saying the plaintiff waited too long after 
he fell ill to sue and that a 1969 federal law bars lawsuits from 
claiming the wording of cigarette warning labels is inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
	The first award against a tobacco company in a liability case  
was won in 1988 by the family of Rose Cipollone of New Jersey. But 
that $400,000 verdict was overturned on appeal, and the nine-year 
lawsuit was dropped when the family could no longer afford to 
continue.

<HEADLINE> Smoker Awarded $51.5M in Damages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A jury awarded a former three-pack-a-day  
smoker $50 million in punitive damages Wednesday in her lawsuit 
against a tobacco company, bringing the total award to $51.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	A day earlier, the jury ordered Philip Morris Cos. to pay $1.5  
million in compensatory damages to Patricia Henley to cover medical 
expenses, pain and suffering. 
</P>
<P>
	The total award was the largest to date in a tobacco liability  
lawsuit filed by an individual smoker. Other awards have been 
overturned on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel wonderful,'' said Henley, who pledged to donate any  
money she receives to educate youngsters about the dangers of 
smoking. ``This is a great day for the children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Henley, 52, of Los Angeles, was diagnosed last year with  
inoperable lung cancer. She alleged the tobacco company, which 
makes Marlboro and other brands, hooked her on cigarettes when she 
was 15 and misled her about the dangers. Her cancer is in remission 
after chemotherapy and radiation treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Before jurors deliberated for three hours Wednesday, Henley's  
attorney told them that punitive damages were the only way to get 
the attention of a $3.5 billion company. Madelyn Chaber asked the 
jury to award her client $15 million in punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
	William Ohlemeyer, who represents Philip Morris, said the  
company would appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The jurors unfortunately let their feelings of sympathy get in  
the way,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the 12 jurors, including jury foreman George Loudis,  
voted against awarding the $50 million in punitive damages. He 
supported punitive damages of $15 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our decision was based on a lot of evidence, the suppression  
of known facts by Philip Morris,'' Loudis said. ``They had a lot of 
information they just didn't give out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before the punitive award was announced, Philip Morris stock  
fell 8.7 percent Wednesday as the most active issue on the New York 
Stock Exchange, dropping $3.93 3/4 to close at $41.43 3/4 a share.

	Dr. Stanton A. Glantz, who published a book in 1996 that exposed  
once-secret tobacco industry documents, said he believes 
plaintiffs' lawyers have learned from mistakes made in those 
overturned cases and that Tuesday's decision may lead to an 
avalanche of personal injury suits. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you're just beginning to see the beginning of the dam  
burst,'' the University of California, San Francisco professor 
said. ``The evidence of wrongdoing by the industry is getting 
overwhelming.''

<HEADLINE>  Judge Orders Pilots To Halt Sickout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- A federal judge ordered pilots at American  
Airlines Wednesday to end a sickout that has grounded 2,500 
flights, stranded an estimated 200,000 travelers and left 
businesses scrambling to find new ways to ship cargo. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Joe Kendall chided the pilots union and the  
airline in issuing a temporary restraining order and told them to 
resume negotiating. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's silly for us to even be here,'' he said. ``It's like  
killing a gnat with a sledge hammer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall told the pilots to return to work Thursday and warned  
they could be held in contempt of court if they don't. ``When you 
call in sick and you're not really sick, you're a liar,'' said 
Kendall. He also placed some blame for the dispute on the airline. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you would look up bad labor relations in the dictionary,  
you would have an American Airlines logo beside it,'' Kendall said. 
</P>
<P>
	AMR Corp., the airline's parent company, had asked for the  
judge's order. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're threatening to bring the airline to a complete halt,''  
AMR attorney Dee Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilots began calling in sick and refusing overtime Saturday  
after talks broke down with the company about the salaries paid 
pilots of Reno Air, which AMR recently acquired. American pilots 
are barred by federal law from striking over the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Reno pilots make half the $164,000 a year that an  
experienced American pilot makes and the American pilots want AMR 
to add Reno pilots to the higher pay scale quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	AMR said that it will take about 12 to 18 months do that and the  
pilot union's demands would cost as much as $50 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline estimated that 2,400 of the 9,400 American pilots  
have called in sick since the talks broke off. 
</P>
<P>
	AMR spokesman Chris Chiames said the company believed the pilots  
would abide by the judge's order. ``We have never questioned a 
pilot that has called in sick. We just hope they will all get 
better soon,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Allied Pilots Association president Rich LaVoy said after the  
hearing that the union ``will be encouraging our pilots to get back 
in the cockpits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whether that will happen remains to be seen. During a previous  
pilot sickout against American in 1990, many failed to return 
despite a court order. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, passengers struggled through another day of  
delays. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Valentine and Kelly Young of Green Bay, Wis., found  
themselves stuck at Miami International Airport, worried they would 
miss their wedding in St. Lucia. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a three-day residency requirement in St. Lucia to get  
married,'' said Valentine, 37. ``If we don't get there today, our 
residency requirement won't be met.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Young, 33, added: ``Oh my God, I have a very sick feeling in  
my stomach. I'm just shaking. It's not exactly what I imagined for 
my wedding week. I have my bridal gown in my wardrobe bag ... and 
it's probably all wrinkled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Erin McGrath was angry at the pilots because she got stuck after  
a business trip to West Palm Beach, Fla. She waited in line at the 
Ft. Lauderdale airport Wednesday for a rental car so she could 
drive to Miami for a flight to San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm waiting for the time when unions and employees realize  
that they don't have to share in every penny of their company's 
profits. It seems like the only people they are hurting are the 
ones that pay their bills.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, some praised American employees for being friendly and  
helpful in getting them booked on other flights. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlie Hall of Dallas arrived in Chicago on a United flight  
that American helped him book. ``I can't complain except that I 
lost frequent flier miles,'' said Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss of American's cargo services was causing heartburn at  
Gladstone's 4 Fish restaurant in Malibu, Calif., where supplies of 
succulent dungeness crab from Alaska were dwindling. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of our food is fresh,'' said spokeswoman Christine Lloyd.  
``Our produce and fish is delivered daily, including Sunday. We 
rely heavily on things coming in every day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	TWA, Delta and other airlines accepted American tickets in the  
same price class and waived the customary change of flight fee, as 
part of a common pact made between airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're picking them up wherever we fly if American operates  
there, too,'' said Delta spokesman Bill Berry. 
</P>
<P>
	American said it also will waive fees to change tickets. The  
airline was also offering full refunds on tickets for travel 
through Feb. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Airline analyst Raymond Neidl with Furman Selz Inc., estimated  
American is losing about $19 million a day in revenue -- or $1.5 
million a day in profits. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he doubted the airline has alienated customers for the  
long term. 
</P>
<P>
	``The key question is how quickly will this business come back  
to American, and my guess is pretty quickly,'' he said.

	2 GOP Sens. Say They'll Acquit  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican support for convicting and removing  
President Clinton waned today as senators debated impeachment for a 
second day behind closed doors. Two GOP senators announced they 
would reject both the perjury and obstruction of justice charges. 
Sens. James Jeffords of Vermont and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania 
said they would vote to acquit the president of the charges.

	Bush Urged To Run for President  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Current and past Republican members of  
Congress are trying to persuade George W. Bush to run for 
president. They say the Texas governor's ``compassionate'' message 
will resonate with voters. ``He is the one that will appeal to the 
broadest spectrum of Americans,'' said former Rep. Gerald Solomon, 
R-N.Y., chairman of the Draft Bush 2000 Committee. Bush has said he 
will decide by early April whether to enter the race.

	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Jesse Jackson said today he didn't mean to  
imply that Gov. George Pataki was racist when he likened the 
second-term Republican to segregationists George Wallace and Orval 
Faubus. Jackson, in a telephone interview he initiated, said he was 
simply complaining yesterday about what he felt was Pataki's 
refusal to provide sufficient funds for New York's public schools, 
not the governor's views on racial issues.

	American Airlines Goes to Court  
</P>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- American Airlines asked a federal judge today to  
order its pilots to stop calling in sick in a dispute that forced 
the carrier to cancel 900 more flights today. AMR Corp., the 
airline's parent company, asked U.S. District Judge Joe Kendall for 
a temporary restraining order and asked that the pilots be held in 
contempt of court if they continued to call in sick. The latest 
strife between American and its pilots -- which has resulted in 
travel delays for more than 200,000 passengers -- has now grounded 
about than 2,500 flights since Saturday.

	Kaczynski Seeks New Trial  
</P>
<P>
	MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) -- Unabomber Theodore Kaczynski believes he  
was unfairly coerced into pleading guilty and has hired a new 
lawyer to help him win a second trial, a law professor said today. 
But a new trial could lead to the death penalty for the 
anti-technology former mountain recluse, who has been in a federal 
prison in Florence, Colo., since he was sentenced to life without 
possibility of parole last spring.

	UN Panel Calls for Iraq Inspections  
</P>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The International Atomic Energy Agency  
says it assumes Baghdad retains the capability to produce atomic 
weapons. The agency called for unannounced inspections to detect 
any signs of a renewed Iraqi nuclear program. In drafting a 
long-term nuclear monitoring program, the IAEA said it is prudent 
to assume ``that Iraq has retained documents of its clandestine 
nuclear program.''

	Viagra OK in Japan Draws Protest

	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's notoriously slow health ministry approved  
the impotence-treatment drug Viagra, sparking an uproar among 
birth-control pill advocates who demanded to know why its approval 
has been languishing for the past nine years. Since Viagra was 
given the OK in January, several major newspapers have carried 
articles suggesting a double-standard at the Health Ministry. 
Women's groups, not surprisingly, have been outraged.

	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Guard Ray Allen signed a $70.9 million,  
six-year extension today, becoming the highest-paid player in 
Milwaukee Bucks history, The Associated Press has learned. Allen 
negotiated directly with team owner Herb Kohl, the senior senator 
from Wisconsin. Although Allen didn't have an agent, he did hire 
celebrity lawyer Johnnie Cochran at $500 an hour to look over the 
contract.

	Censure Idea Said To Be 'Wilting'  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Several Republicans are expressing a  
willingness to let President Clinton walk away from his impeachment 
ordeal with an acquittal. That would leave judgment of his conduct 
to history rather than any Senate-approved rebuke. The censure idea 
is ``a rose that is beginning to wilt,'' said Sen. Larry Craig, 
R-Idaho, a member of the Senate Republican leadership. Some 
Democrats, he said, want a censure because they're ``seeking 
cover'' for their expected acquittal votes. 

</P>
<P>
	Senate To Continue Closed Trial  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senators have resumed deliberations in the  
impeachment trial of President Clinton. The closed-door 
deliberations will likely continue tomorrow, followed by votes on 
the two articles of impeachment. The outcome of acquittal appeared 
so evident yesterday that one Republican said ``bipartisan 
acquittal'' was possible by week's end. As the Senate debated his 
fate, Clinton traveled to West Virginia to meet with House 
Democrats holding their annual retreat. 

</P>
<P>
	U.S. Jets Fire on Iraqi Sites  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. aircraft fired weapons at two air defense  
sites in Iraq today after encountering some Iraqi violations in the 
southern ``no-fly'' zone, Pentagon officials said. The were no 
reports of activity over the northern zone, although patrols also 
were conducted there. Defense Department spokesman Bryan Whitman 
said U.S. pilots fired at air defense sites near Talil, about 170 
miles southeast of Baghdad, and near An Najaf, about 100 miles 
south of Baghdad.

	Europe Blanketed by Heavy Snow  
</P>
<P>
	CHAMONIX, France (AP) -- Two avalanches roared down a  
mountainside in the French Alps, burying chalets and killing at 
least 10 people, police said today. Heavy snow blanketed other 
parts of Europe, forcing evacuations and stranding thousands in 
Switzerland, Austria and Germany. A man who spent hours trapped 
under the snow and at least eight children were among those rescued 
after the avalanches swept through the area north of the popular 
ski resort of Chamonix.

	Pope Recalls Trip to Mexico, U.S.  
</P>
<P>
	VATICAN CITY (AP) -- Pope John Paul II said today his trip to  
Mexico and the United States was intended to ``defend life'' with 
his condemnations of abortion, euthanasia and the death penalty. In 
his first general audience since coming down with the flu 10 days 
ago, the 78-year-old pope called the defense of life and the family 
``the great challenge for the present and the future of humanity.''

	Chinese Detained in Buffalo, N.Y.

<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Border Patrol officers have detained six  
Chinese nationals who crept into the United States by crawling 
across a bridge with the Niagara River roaring 200 feet below. 
Three men and three women were captured about 12:30 a.m. yesterday 
on the American side of the Whirlpool Bridge. They were charged 
with illegal entry, a misdemeanor, and ordered held pending a 
detention hearing scheduled for today.

the smoking habit she took up as a teen-ager won $1.5 million in 
the first case to go to trial since California repealed a ban on 
individuals' lawsuits against tobacco companies. The compensatory 
damages awarded to Patricia Henley, 52, cover her medical costs, 
pain and suffering. The Superior Court jury was to consider 
punitive damages today.

arraigned on larceny charges for allegedly swiping the wills of 
deceased Boston-area baseball players. The documents had been held 
in a vault at the Suffolk County Courthouse where he worked. The 
court papers bear the signatures of some of baseball's earliest 
superstars. George Wright, Hugh Duffy and Tommy McCarthy, all Hall 
of Famers, played for Boston teams in the late 19th and early 20th 
centuries.

<HEADLINE>  Judge Orders Pilots To Halt Sickout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- A federal judge ordered pilots at American  
Airlines Wednesday to end a sickout that has grounded 2,500 
flights, stranded an estimated 200,000 travelers and left 
businesses scrambling to find new ways to ship cargo. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Joe Kendall chided the pilots union and the  
airline in issuing a temporary restraining order and told them to 
resume negotiating. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's silly for us to even be here,'' he said. ``It's like  
killing a gnat with a sledge hammer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall told the pilots to return to work Thursday and warned  
they could be held in contempt of court if they don't. ``When you 
call in sick and you're not really sick, you're a liar,'' said 
Kendall. He also placed some blame for the dispute on the airline. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you would look up bad labor relations in the dictionary,  
you would have an American Airlines logo beside it,'' Kendall said. 
</P>
<P>
	AMR Corp., the airline's parent company, had asked for the  
judge's order. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're threatening to bring the airline to a complete halt,''  
AMR attorney Dee Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilots began calling in sick and refusing overtime Saturday  
after talks broke down with the company about the salaries paid 
pilots of Reno Air, which AMR recently acquired. American pilots 
are barred by federal law from striking over the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Reno pilots make half the $164,000 a year that an  
experienced American pilot makes and the American pilots want AMR 
to add Reno pilots to the higher pay scale quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	AMR said that it will take about 12 to 18 months do that and the  
pilot union's demands would cost as much as $50 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline estimated that 2,400 of the 9,400 American pilots  
have called in sick since the talks broke off. 
</P>
<P>
	AMR spokesman Chris Chiames said the company believed the pilots  
would abide by the judge's order. ``We have never questioned a 
pilot that has called in sick. We just hope they will all get 
better soon,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Allied Pilots Association president Rich LaVoy said after the  
hearing that the union ``will be encouraging our pilots to get back 
in the cockpits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whether that will happen remains to be seen. During a previous  
pilot sickout against American in 1990, many failed to return 
despite a court order. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, passengers struggled through another day of  
delays. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Valentine and Kelly Young of Green Bay, Wis., found  
themselves stuck at Miami International Airport, worried they would 
miss their wedding in St. Lucia. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a three-day residency requirement in St. Lucia to get  
married,'' said Valentine, 37. ``If we don't get there today, our 
residency requirement won't be met.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Young, 33, added: ``Oh my God, I have a very sick feeling in  
my stomach. I'm just shaking. It's not exactly what I imagined for 
my wedding week. I have my bridal gown in my wardrobe bag ... and 
it's probably all wrinkled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Erin McGrath was angry at the pilots because she got stuck after  
a business trip to West Palm Beach, Fla. She waited in line at the 
Ft. Lauderdale airport Wednesday for a rental car so she could 
drive to Miami for a flight to San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm waiting for the time when unions and employees realize  
that they don't have to share in every penny of their company's 
profits. It seems like the only people they are hurting are the 
ones that pay their bills.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, some praised American employees for being friendly and  
helpful in getting them booked on other flights. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlie Hall of Dallas arrived in Chicago on a United flight  
that American helped him book. ``I can't complain except that I 
lost frequent flier miles,'' said Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss of American's cargo services was causing heartburn at  
Gladstone's 4 Fish restaurant in Malibu, Calif., where supplies of 
succulent dungeness crab from Alaska were dwindling. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of our food is fresh,'' said spokeswoman Christine Lloyd.  
``Our produce and fish is delivered daily, including Sunday. We 
rely heavily on things coming in every day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	TWA, Delta and other airlines accepted American tickets in the  
same price class and waived the customary change of flight fee, as 
part of a common pact made between airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're picking them up wherever we fly if American operates  
there, too,'' said Delta spokesman Bill Berry. 
</P>
<P>
	American said it also will waive fees to change tickets. The  
airline was also offering full refunds on tickets for travel 
through Feb. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Airline analyst Raymond Neidl with Furman Selz Inc., estimated  
American is losing about $19 million a day in revenue -- or $1.5 
million a day in profits. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he doubted the airline has alienated customers for the  
long term. 
</P>
<P>
	``The key question is how quickly will this business come back  
to American, and my guess is pretty quickly,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Jackson: Didn't Call Pakati Racist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Jesse Jackson said today he didn't mean to  
imply that Gov. George Pataki was racist when he likened the 
second-term Republican to segregationists George Wallace and Orval 
Faubus. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did not call him a racist, didn't even infer that,'' Jackson  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, in a telephone interview he initiated, said he was  
simply complaining Tuesday about what he felt was Pataki's refusal 
to provide sufficient funds for New York's public schools, not the 
governor's views on racial issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not about black and white, this is about right and  
wrong,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the case of Wallace and Faubus, these guys blocked doors of  
public education trying to appeal to an extremist element. That's 
the same thing Pataki is doing,'' Jackson said today. Wallace was 
governor of Alabama, Faubus of Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson said he planned to call Pataki at some point to discuss  
the issue, but not to apologize ``because I have not offended 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate comment from Pataki who is being touted  
by supporters as a potential candidate for president or vice 
president next year and has stepped up his out-of-state travel in 
an attempt to boost his national stature. 
</P>
<P>
	In his comments Tuesday, Jackson also invoked the name of former  
California governor Pete Wilson, chastising him for turning against 
affirmative action and cracking down on illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pataki is trying what Wallace tried, what Faubus tried, what  
Wilson tried, and they all failed,'' said Jackson, who testified 
Tuesday at a legislative hearing against Pataki's budget plans for 
education. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, the two-time Democratic presidential contender, said  
Pataki wanted to spend too much on prisons and not enough on 
classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether you're blocking school doors in Alabama and Arkansas  
or simply locking kids out of closed school doors in New York is 
not the wave of the American future,'' Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pataki spokesman Michael McKeon said Jackson's ``partisan  
attacks are so outrageous they don't even merit a response.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Faubus, who died in 1994, called out the National Guard in a  
1957 attempt to block the desegregation of Little Rock's schools. 
Wallace, who died last year, stood in the schoolhouse door in 1963 
in an attempt to keep blacks from enrolling at the University of 
Alabama. Years later, he repudiated his segregationist past and 
preached racial cooperation.

<HEADLINE> House Praises King Hussein </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House approved without dissent Wednesday a  
resolution praising the late King Hussein of Jordan for his 
``enlightened leadership'' and his efforts to bring peace to the 
Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
	The resolution, passed 420-0, also expressed U.S. support for  
the new government under Hussein's son, King Abdullah II. The 
Senate approved the resolution Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Ben Gilman, R-N.Y., the International Relations Committee  
chairman, who represented the House at Hussein's funeral Monday, 
said Hussein was a ``true survivor'' who ``succeeded through the 
sheer force of will as well as his dedication, his persistence and 
his vision for a brighter future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Minority Whip David Bonior, D-Mich., who also attended the  
funeral in Amman, Jordan, praised the king as ``a man of honor, a 
man of wisdom and, beyond anything else, a man of peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``King Hussein contributed to the cause of peace with tireless  
energy,'' the resolution said. Congress ``extends its deepest 
sympathy and condolences to the family of King Hussein and to all 
the people of Jordan in this difficult time,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	The resolution expresses ``support and best wishes for the new  
government of Jordan under King Abdullah'' and reiterates a U.S. 
commitment ``to strengthening the vital relationship between our 
two governments and people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The resolution is to be sent to Hussein's family after President  
Clinton signs it.

<HEADLINE> Sponsor Criticizes Olympic Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For the first time since the Salt Lake bribery  
scandal broke, criticism of Olympic leadership is coming from a key 
member of the tight-knit community that runs the games. 
</P>
<P>
	David D'Alessandro, the top official of Olympics sponsor John  
Hancock insurance, said Tuesday that the International Olympic 
Committee does not want to deal with the corruption case. 
D'Alessandro hinted that the IOC's president, Juan Antonio 
Samaranch, might be nearing the final days of his once-unchallenged 
reign. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still think Kenny Rogers said it best: `Know when to hold  
'em, know when to fold 'em, know when to walk away, know when to 
run,''' D'Alessandro said. ``I think Samaranch is getting close to 
the end of his `fold 'em' stage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president and chief operations officer of John Hancock said  
the IOC had become ``a cult of royals'' that was incapable of 
making the radical changes necessary to bounce back from the worst 
scandal in its history. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each day, the IOC loses a bit more credibility,'' he said.  
``It's clear the leaders of the IOC want to wake up, and this is 
all gone away and they have their club back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	D'Alessandro also said he was canceling negotiations with NBC  
for $20 million in ads to protest the IOC's failure to deal with 
the growing corruption scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to buy a nickel of advertising on NBC until we  
are confident the IOC is going in the right direction,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The move was meant to pressure the network, the single biggest  
revenue source for the IOC with a $3.57 billion rights contract, to 
try to convince the committee of the need for meaningful change. 
</P>
<P>
	``NBC tells them to change, you don't think the IOC will listen?  
What are they going to do, go find someone else?'' D'Alessandro 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC spokeswoman Maria Battaglia said the network was unaware of  
D'Alessandro's decision on the ads. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had no issues with other advertisers,'' she said.  
``We've continued to have tremendous interest in the Olympics and 
have closed major deals with several advertisers in the past few 
weeks. They've understood that the Olympics are about the games and 
the athletes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Lausanne, Switzerland, IOC marketing director Michael Payne  
downplayed the John Hancock move. 
</P>
<P>
	``They aren't withdrawing from their sponsorship,'' he said.  
``This issue is related to a media purchase which is separate from 
the sponsorship. ... The sponsors are standing, first of all, 
behind the games, and, second, behind the steps and action the IOC 
is taking'' to clean house. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Alessandro, whose company pays about $50 million to be the  
official life insurance and annuities sponsor of the Olympics and 
use the five-ring logo in its ads, said there have been only two 
high points for the IOC since the scandal broke in early December. 
</P>
<P>
	One, he said, was when vice president Dick Pound was appointed  
to investigate the Salt Lake allegations for the IOC ``instead of 
one of their ventriloquist dummies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The second, he continued, came when nine members of the IOC  
resigned or were expelled and Samaranch apologized for the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the first moment in which the sponsors correctly said,  
`Oh, he gets it,''' D'Alessandro said. ``You know what? That was 
the last moment when it could be correctly said, `Oh, he gets 
it.''' 
</P>
<P>
	For weeks, D'Alessandro has closed ranks with other sponsors and  
sports officials in defending Samaranch and the IOC, although 
warning that solid action was needed to save the value of the 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	But now, he said, he was putting together a plan to distance his  
company from the committee despite a contract that runs through the 
Sydney Games in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he has removed the Olympic rings from his company's  
annual report and from correspondence due to be sent out over the 
next few months. 
</P>
<P>
	The rings also have been removed from John Hancock billboards at  
Fenway Park in Boston and other stadiums and arenas, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to go to the expense of putting them back on,''  
he said. While the IOC contract offered no direct escape clause, 
``you don't have to promote it, you don't have to use the rings,'' 
D'Alessandro added. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said that if the rings become too devalued as an  
advertising tool, ``we would approach it as we would if we had 
bought the Olympic car. If that car does not operate properly and 
as expected, you no longer drive that car.''

<HEADLINE> Pharmacia and Upjohn Profit Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRIDGEWATER, N.J. (AP) -- Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn's operating profit  
jumped 28 percent in the fourth quarter amid surging sales of its 
glaucoma and growth hormone drugs, the company reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding a one-time expenses of $92 million to cover the final  
portion of a global restructuring begun in 1997, the company earned 
$235 million, or 45 cents per share, in the quarter, matching Wall 
Street forcasts, according to analysts surveyed by First Call. 
</P>
<P>
	In the same period a year ago, Pharmacia earned of $183 million,

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- There's been another face lift in Hollywood.  
</P>
<P>
	New life has been breathed into the 100-year-old Hollywood  
Memorial Park Cemetery -- renamed Hollywood Forever by its new 
owners -- and the graveyard's permanent celebrity residents are now 
showcased in a setting befitting their fame. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawns, roads and roofs have been repaired or replaced. There is  
a new look to the buildings, including the sun-splashed chapel 
leading into an elegant columbarium with glass-paned niches. Two 
decades of decay and neglect have been erased. 
</P>
<P>
	The once crumbling mausoleum where Benjamin ``Bugsy'' Siegel is  
entombed has been revitalized and pigeons have been shooed away. 
The road near the grave of Douglas Fairbanks Sr. has been repaved. 
The skylights over Rudolph Valentino's crypt have been fixed. 
</P>
<P>
	Palm trees sway over emerald lawns covering the graves of Peter  
Lorre, Tyrone Power, Harry Cohn, Cecil B. DeMille, John Huston, 
Nelson Eddy and Carl ``Alfalfa'' Switzer. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``That's All Folks'' epitaph on Mel Blanc's tombstone is now  
polished. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a place to be proud of again,'' said Tyler Cassity, who  
came to California to restore what he views as nothing less than a 
historic treasure. Cassity, whose father owns a mortuary chain in 
St. Louis, and his investors bought the cemetery for $375,000. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Hollywood sign looming in the distance, workers quietly  
go about completing the first phase of the $7 million 
rehabilitation project while relatives place flowers on graves, 
children play on lawns, and tourists wander the grounds clutching 
free maps to celebrity graves. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cemeteries aren't spooky anymore,'' the 28-year-old Cassity  
said. ``People want to see the old monuments and statues here. 
We're not like the lawn parks. The more people there are, the more 
alive it is. We're taking away that stigma of death. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you see a bunch of children frolicking on your grass, it  
makes you feel good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cassity welcomes tourists and fans, including the annual  
migration of Valentino fans on the anniversary of his death, but 
tour buses are forbidden on the 620-acre site behind Paramount 
Studios. 
</P>
<P>
	Hearses occasionally turn off busy Santa Monica Boulevard with  
new arrivals. 
</P>
<P>
	The cemetery's mortuary is up and running, and the crematory (45  
percent of California corpses go up in smoke) will be fired up 
soon. The Mamas &AMP; the Papas singer Cass Elliot was the last person 
cremated at the Hollywood cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
	New mausoleums are being added to increase capacity by 60,000 --  
mostly by eliminating some roads. There are 80,000 remains already 
at Hollywood Forever. 
</P>
<P>
	Several years ago, the Hollywood Cemetery Association, which  
owned the graveyard, filed for bankruptcy protection amid 
allegations of fiscal impropriety. Several purchase deals fell 
through before Cassity bought it last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Considered by many to be the cemetery's savior, Cassity is  
brimming with enthusiasm about the make-over. Early on, he saw 
promise in the bankrupt property. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was described to me as a total disaster,'' he said. ``When  
we came here monuments were face down. Thirty percent of the 
monuments needed to be reset. There was neglect, but I thought 
neglect was easy to correct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides decay and disrepair, considerable damage was caused by  
the 1994 earthquake, and the 1998 El Nino rains flooded ponds and 
the cemetery lake. Cassity has cleaned all that up, saying, ``I've 
been a strict cemeterian for a year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new owner has also introduced an array of video and digital  
services for families. 
</P>
<P>
	California, which has long pioneered innovative send-offs for  
the dearly departed, offered the perfect climate for this death 
business maverick. 
</P>
<P>
	Families can now enter a video kiosk -- a small viewing room --  
where a giant computer-activated television plays videotaped 
goodbyes and biographical epitaphs of the dead. Thousands of videos 
are already produced. 
</P>
<P>
	The dead can soon be downloaded from anywhere by tapping into  
the Hollywood Forever video library on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	A no-frills biography is $400, and the all-out production is  
about $5,000. But the average is about $1,100. 
</P>
<P>
	Cassity also wants to offer DNA analysis of the deceased for  
inscription on a CD-ROM. It would cost about $400 for the analysis. 
The CD and a lock of hair would be stored at the cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
	The way Cassity sees it, who knows what future advances will be  
made in science and technology? 
</P>
<P>
	``We treat it as a laboratory for ideas,'' he said.
